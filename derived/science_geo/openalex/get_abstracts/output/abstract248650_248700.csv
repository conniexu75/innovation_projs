https://openalex.org/W2108313755,"More than 300 labs worldwide are using the fungus Aspergillus nidulans as a model system for molecular genetics, and other species of this fungus are important in everyday life. A package of three genomics papers in this issue covers the Aspergillus field comprehensively. Galagan et al. report the genome sequence of the laboratory classic A. nidulans, and Nierman et al. have sequenced A. fumigatus, known chiefly as a human pathogen and allergen. And finally Machida et al. present genome sequencing and analysis of A. oryzae, focusing in particular on the expansion of genes in its genome, which is almost 25% bigger than the other two genomes. A. oryzae is used in traditional Chinese and Japanese food fermentation (think soy sauce) and also in enzyme production by biotechnologists. Aspergillus fumigatus is exceptional among microorganisms in being both a primary and opportunistic pathogen as well as a major allergen1,2,3. Its conidia production is prolific, and so human respiratory tract exposure is almost constant4. A. fumigatus is isolated from human habitats5 and vegetable compost heaps6,7. In immunocompromised individuals, the incidence of invasive infection can be as high as 50% and the mortality rate is often about 50% (ref. 2). The interaction of A. fumigatus and other airborne fungi with the immune system is increasingly linked to severe asthma and sinusitis8. Although the burden of invasive disease caused by A. fumigatus is substantial, the basic biology of the organism is mostly obscure. Here we show the complete 29.4-megabase genome sequence of the clinical isolate Af293, which consists of eight chromosomes containing 9,926 predicted genes. Microarray analysis revealed temperature-dependent expression of distinct sets of genes, as well as 700 A. fumigatus genes not present or significantly diverged in the closely related sexual species Neosartorya fischeri, many of which may have roles in the pathogenicity phenotype. The Af293 genome sequence provides an unparalleled resource for the future understanding of this remarkable fungus."
https://openalex.org/W2020994501,"The genome of Aspergillus oryzae, a fungus important for the production of traditional fermented foods and beverages in Japan, has been sequenced. The ability to secrete large amounts of proteins and the development of a transformation system have facilitated the use of A. oryzae in modern biotechnology. Although both A. oryzae and Aspergillus flavus belong to the section Flavi of the subgenus Circumdati of Aspergillus, A. oryzae, unlike A. flavus, does not produce aflatoxin, and its long history of use in the food industry has proved its safety. Here we show that the 37-megabase (Mb) genome of A. oryzae contains 12,074 genes and is expanded by 7-9 Mb in comparison with the genomes of Aspergillus nidulans and Aspergillus fumigatus. Comparison of the three aspergilli species revealed the presence of syntenic blocks and A. oryzae-specific blocks (lacking synteny with A. nidulans and A. fumigatus) in a mosaic manner throughout the genome of A. oryzae. The blocks of A. oryzae-specific sequence are enriched for genes involved in metabolism, particularly those for the synthesis of secondary metabolites. Specific expansion of genes for secretory hydrolytic enzymes, amino acid metabolism and amino acid/sugar uptake transporters supports the idea that A. oryzae is an ideal microorganism for fermentation."

Unlike neurons, white matter oligodendrocytes reportedly lack NMDA (N-methyl-d-aspartate) receptors. It is believed that glutamate damages oligodendrocytes, especially their precursor cells, by acting on calcium-permeable AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid)/kainate receptors alone or by reversing cystine-glutamate exchange and depriving cells of antioxidant protection. Here we show that precursor, immature and mature oligodendrocytes in the white matter of the cerebellum and corpus callosum exhibit NMDA-evoked currents, mediated by receptors that are blocked only weakly by Mg2+ and that may contain NR1, NR2C and NR3 NMDA receptor subunits. NMDA receptors are present in the myelinating processes of oligodendrocytes, where the small intracellular space could lead to a large rise in intracellular ion concentration in response to NMDA receptor activation. Simulating ischaemia led to development of an inward current in oligodendrocytes, which was partly mediated by NMDA receptors. These results point to NMDA receptors of unusual subunit composition as a potential therapeutic target for preventing white matter damage in a variety of diseases."

https://openalex.org/W2146696914,"Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bone loss through stimulation of osteoclastic bone resorption and inhibition of osteoblastic bone formation. Compared with the well established role of TNF in osteoclastogenesis, mechanisms by which TNF inhibits osteoblast function have not been fully determined. Runx2 is an osteoblast-specific transcription factor whose steady-state protein levels are regulated by proteasomal degradation, mediated by the E3 ubiquitin ligases, Smurf1 and Smurf2. We hypothesized that TNF inhibits osteoblast function through Smurf-mediated Runx2 degradation. We treated C2C12 and 2T3 osteoblast precursor cell lines and primary osteoblasts with TNF and found that TNF, but not interleukin-1, significantly increased Smurf1 and Smurf2 expression. TNF increased the degradation of endogenous or transfected Runx2 protein, which was blocked by treating cells with a proteasomal inhibitor or by infecting cells with small interfering (si)RNA against Smurf1 or Smurf2. TNF inhibited the expression of bone morphogenetic protein and transforming growth factor-β signaling reporter constructs, and the inhibition of each was blocked by Smurf1 siRNA and Smurf2 siRNA, respectively. Overexpression of Smurf1 and/or Smurf2 siRNAs prevented the inhibitory effect of TNF on Runx2 reporter. Consistent with these in vitro findings, bones from TNF transgenic mice or TNF-injected wild type mice had increased Smurf1 and decreased Runx2 protein levels. We propose that one of the mechanisms by which TNF inhibits bone formation in inflammatory bone disorders is by promoting Runx2 proteasomal degradation through up-regulation of Smurf1 and Smurf2 expression.

In patients with rheumatoid arthritis, TNF and other cytokines are overproduced in inflamed joints by various cells infiltrating the synovial membrane. This leads to severe local erosion of cartilage and bone, periarticular osteopenia, as well as systemic osteoporosis (1.Goldring S.R. Gravallese E.M. Curr. Opin. Rheumatol. 2000; 12: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 2.Srivastava S. Weitzmann M.N. Cenci S. Ross F.P. Adler S. Pacifici R. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 503-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, osteoblasts do not catch up with the accelerated bone resorption, indicating impaired osteoblast function (3.Nair S.P. Williams R.J. Henderson B. Rheumatology. 2000; 39: 821-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The inhibitory effects of TNF on bone formation in vitro were first described in 1987 in neonatal rat calvarial organ cultures (4.Canalis E. Endocrinology. 1987; 121: 1596-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies demonstrated that TNF inhibits recruitment of osteoblast progenitors, reduces expression of genes produced by mature osteoblasts, and promotes osteoblast apoptosis through nuclear factor-κB signaling pathway (5.Li Y.P. Stashenko P. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 788-794PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Taichman R.S. Hauschka P.V. Inflammation. 1992; 16: 587-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 7.Kitajima I. Soejima Y.

However, compared with our understanding of the role of TNF in osteoclast biology, little is known of the molecular mechanisms that mediate the effect of TNF on osteoblast inhibition. To date, the most important mechanistic finding of TNF-mediated osteoblast inhibition was the demonstration that TNF decreases Runt-related gene 2 (Runx2) expression and its DNA binding activity in osteoblasts (10.Gilbert L. He X. Farmer P. Rubin J. Drissi H. van Wijnen A.J. Lian J.B. Stein G.S. Nanes M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2695-2701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). This is partially through suppression of Runx2 gene transcription and destabilization of Runx2 mRNA through the TNF receptor 1 signaling pathway (10.Gilbert L. He X. Farmer P. Rubin J.

Physiol. 2005; 288: E1011-E1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). However, because TNF-induced reduction in nuclear Runx2 protein (more than 90%) was greater than expected, compared with the decrease in total Runx2 mRNA (50%), it has been predicted that TNF may also have post-transcriptional effects. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibitors of the cell survival-promoting kinases, Akt, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and extracellular signal-regulated kinases, fail to reverse the inhibitory effects of TNF on osteoblast differentiation in vitro (11.Abbas S. Zhang Y.H. Clohisy J.C. Abu-Amer Y. Cytokine. 2003; 22: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), suggesting that other signal pathways may be involved. In the past several years, ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation has been implicated in the regulation of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2 and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling pathways in various cell types (13.Izzi L. Attisano L. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2071-2078Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 14.Datto M. Wang X.F. Cell. 2005; 121: 2-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We and others have demonstrated that the E3 ubiquitin ligase, Smad ubiquitin regulatory factor (Smurf)1, regulates osteoblast differentiation by promoting proteasomal degradation of the BMP signaling protein, Smad1 and Smad5, and of the osteoblast transcription factor, Runx2 (15.Zhu H.

Smurf2, a closely related homolog of Smurf1, was shown to reduce the steady-state protein levels of Smad1 and 2, but not Smad3 and 4, in Smurf2-transfected cells (19.Lin X. Liang M. Feng X.H. J.

A. 2001; 98: 974-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Ectopic expression of Smurf1 in 2T3 osteoblast precursors and C2C12 myoblast/osteoblast precursors induces the proteasomal degradation of Smad1 and Runx2 proteins, leading to inhibition of osteoblast differentiation (17.Zhao M. Qiao M. Oyajobi B.O. Mundy G.R. Chen D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27939-27944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Smurf1 blocks BMP-induced osteogenic conversion of C2C12 cells and facilitates their myogenic differentiation by inducing degradation of Smad5 (16.Ying S.X. Hussain Z.J. Zhang Y.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39029-39036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In vitro, Smurf1 also targets a member of the Rho family of small GTPases, RhoA, for ubiquitination and degradation (21.Wang H.R. Zhang Y. Ozdamar B. Ogunjimi A.A. Alexandrova E. Thomsen G.H. Wrana J.L. Science. 2003; 302: 1775-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 22.Zhang Y. Wang H.R. Wrana J.L. Cell Cycle. 2004; 3: 391-392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In vivo, overexpression of Smurf1 in osteoblasts by the osteoblast-specific type I collagen (Col1a1) promoter leads to reduction in osteoblast proliferation and activity. Col1a1-Smurf1 transgenic mice have decreased bone formation rates and decreased Runx2 protein expression in osteoblasts (18.Zhao M. Qiao M. Harris S.E. Oyajobi B.O. Mundy G.R. Chen D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12854-12859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Smurf1 knock-out (Smurf1-/-) mice were generated recently. Although they survive to adulthood, they exhibit an age-dependent increase in bone mass (23.Yamashita M. Ying S.X. Zhang G.M. Li C. Cheng S.Y. Deng C.X. Zhang Y.E. Cell. 2005; 121: 101-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Interestingly, osteoblasts from Smurf1-/- mice have normal levels of the BMP receptors, Smad1, 2, 3, and 5, and Runx2, all of which have been defined previously as targets of Smurf1. Because Smurf1 and Smurf2 possess overlapping functions, it is possible that Smurf2 compensates for the loss of Smurf1 in these knock-out animals (19.Lin X. Liang M. Feng X.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36818-36822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 20.Zhang Y. Chang C. Gehling D.J. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Derynck R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 2000; 6: 1365-1375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar). Currently, the role of Smurf2 in osteoblast function in vivo and the role of Smurf E3 ligases in the pathogenesis of bone diseases remain poorly understood. Additionally, there is little information on the regulation of Smurfs expression under physiological and pathological conditions. To explore the molecular mechanisms of TNF-mediated osteoblast inhibition, we tested the hypothesis that TNF inhibits osteoblastic bone formation by up-regulating Smurf E3 ligases that degrade Runx2 protein. We found that TNF increased Smurf1 and Smurf2 expression in osteoblasts, leading to enhanced ubiquitination and degradation of Runx2 protein. This TNF-induced Runx2 degradation was reversed by proteasome inhibitors and by knocking down endogenous Smurf1 or Smurf2 using small interfering RNA (siRNA) against Smurf1 or Smurf2. Bones from TNF-overexpressing mice exhibited increased Smurf1 and decreased Runx2 protein levels. Taken together, our findings point to a novel molecular mechanism of TNF inhibition of osteoblasts, which involves post-transcriptional regulation of protein function through Smurf E3 ligase-mediated proteasomal degradation. Animals—TNF transgenic (Tg) mice in a CBA × C57BL/6 background (3647 TNF-Tg line) were obtained from Dr. G. Kollias. C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved all animal studies. Antibodies—Monoclonal antibodies specific for FLAG and β-actin were purchased from Sigma. Anti-Runx2 monoclonal antibody was from MBL (Woburn, MA). Anti-ubiquitin monoclonal antibody was from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-Smurf1 polyclonal antibody was from Abgent (San Diego, CA). Cell Culture and Transfection Conditions—C2C12 myoblast/osteoblast precursors were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and 2T3 osteoblast precursors were cultured in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 1% penicillin-streptomycin (all from Invitrogen) and 10% fetal calf serum (JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, KS). When cells were grown to 90% confluence, the cDNA expression plasmid, pCMV-FLAG-tagged Runx2 (F-Runx2) and/or a pCMV-Myc-tagged Smurf1 (M-Smurf1) were transiently transfected into the cells using Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total amounts of transfected plasmids in each group were equalized by the addition of empty vector. After transfection (24 h), the cells were cultured further in the presence and absence of murine TNF (R&D Systems) and subjected to reverse transcription (RT)-PCR or Western blot analysis. Bone Nodule Formation—Bone marrow cells were flushed from the tibiae and femur of wild type (wt) and TNF-Tg mice, and the cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 106/ml. The cells were cultured in 37 °C with a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. When the cells reached confluence (day 0), the medium was changed to an osteoblast-inducing medium (α-minimal essential medium-supplemented 10% fetal calf serum with 100 μg/ml l-ascorbic acid and 5 mm β-glycerophosphate) with or without 40 ng/ml BMP-2, and the medium was changed twice a week. After an 18-day incubation, the cells were fixed with 10% formalin and stained by the von-Kossa method. The area of mineralized bone nodules was determined under light microscopy by point counting, as described previously (25.Boyce B.F. Aufdemorte T.B. Garrett I.R. Yates A.J. Mundy G.R. Endocrinology. 1989; 125: 1142-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Quantitative Real Time RT-PCR—Cells were homogenized using 1 ml of TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and total RNA was extracted according to the manufacturer's protocol. cDNA was synthesized using 20 μl of reverse transcription reaction solution containing 1 μg of total RNA, 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.3), 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm deoxynucleoside triphosphates, 2.5 μm random hexamers, 20 units RNase inhibitor, and 50 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (all from Roche Applied Science). Quantitative real time PCR amplifications were performed in an iCycler real time PCR machine using iQ SYBR Green supermix (both from Bio-Rad Laboratories) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The sequences of primer sets for Smurf1, Smurf2, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), osteocalcin (OC), and β-actin mRNAs, target sites on mRNAs and product sizes by PCR are shown in Table 1. To minimize the background of products amplified from genomic DNAs, these primers were designed to exist on two different exons. The quantity of Smurf1, Smurf2, ALP, and OC mRNA in each sample was normalized using the CT (threshold cycle) value obtained for the β-actin mRNA amplifications.TABLE 1Sequences of primers used in the real time PCRGenesGenBank™ accession numberSequences of primersaF, forward primer; R, reverse primerTarget sites on genesProduct sizesbpSmurf1NM029438F: 5′-AGTTCGTGGCCAAATAGTGG-3′687-78599R: 5′-GTTCCTTCGTTCTCCAGCAG-3′Smurf2NM 025481F: 5′-GTGAAGAGCTCGGTCCTTTG-3′1041-1154114R: 5′-AGAGCCGGGGATCTGTAAAT-3′ALPAF285233F: 5′-CGGGACTGGTACTCGGATAA-3′550-706157R: 5′-ATTCCACGTCGGTTCTGTTC-3′OCAH004426F: 5′-CTTGGTGCACACCTAGCAGA-3′638-824186R: 5′-CTCCCTCATGTGTTGTCCCT-3′β-actinNM 001101F: 5′-AGATGTGGATCAGCAAGCAG-3′1134-1251118R: 5′-GCGCAAGTTAGGTTTTGTCA-3′a F, forward primer; R, reverse primer Open table in a new tab Western Blot Analysis—Cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and whole cell lysates were prepared by the addition of M-PER mammalian protein extraction reagent (Pierce) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Twenty μg of protein was loaded per lane and separated on a 10% polyacrylamide gel, followed by transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) by electroblotting. Membrane was blocked for nonspecific binding in 3% nonfat dry milk and followed by incubation with an antibody at 4 °C. After membrane was washed, the blots were probed with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Bio-Rad) and visualized by an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Ubiquitination of Runx2—2T3 cells were incubated in medium containing 7.5 ng/ml TNF for 72 h in the presence of PBS or 0.1 mm MG132 (Calbiochem) for the last 12 h of TNF treatment. For the immunoprecipitation, cell lysate was incubated with anti-Runx2 antibody overnight at 4 °C followed by the addition of protein G-agarose (Roche Applied Science) overnight at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0), containing 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.05% deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS, resuspended in 1 × reducing sample buffer, and subjected to Western blot analysis with an anti-ubiquitin antibody. The same membrane was stripped and reprobed for Runx2. siRNA and Virus Infection—Platinum-E cells were transfected with a retrovirus vector (pRetro-H1G) that encodes Smurf1 or Smurf2 siRNA, or an empty vector using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science). The sequences of Smurf1 and Smurf2 siRNAs are shown in Table 2. After 2 days, viral supernatants were harvested and filtered using a 0.45-μm membrane filter. 2T3 cells were infected with virus supernatant in the presence of Polybrene. After 4 h, 2 ml of α-minimal essential medium was added to the cells to dilute Polybrene. The cells were cultured for an additional 48 h in α-minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were then used for RNA extraction or Western blot analysis.TABLE 2Sequences of siRNA used in the infectionTarget genesaParentheses indicate GenBank™ accession numbersSequences of siRNAbsiRNAs are designated to encode two complementary sequences of 19 nucleotides homologous to a segment of Smurf1 or Smurf2 mRNA (underlined) separated by a nine-nucleotide space (small characters), and have a terminator signal (TTTTTTC) at a 3′ terminusTarget sites on mRNASmurfl (NM 029438)5′–GATTCGAACCTTGCAAAGAAAGAC ttcaagagaGTCTTTCTTTGCAAGGTTCTTTTTTC–3′372–390Smurf2 (NM 025481)5′–GATTCGACCAACAGCAACAGCAAG ttcaagagaCTTGCTGTTGCTGTTGGTCTTTTTTC–3′1199–1217a Parentheses indicate GenBank™ accession numbersb siRNAs are designated to encode two complementary sequences of 19 nucleotides homologous to a segment of Smurf1 or Smurf2 mRNA (underlined) separated by a nine-nucleotide space (small characters), and have a terminator signal (TTTTTTC) at a 3′ terminus Open table in a new tab Luciferase Assay—2T3 cells were transfected with the BMP, 12×SBE-OC-Luc (17.Zhao M.

Cell lysates were extracted, and luciferase activity was measured using a Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) and normalized by Renilla luciferase activity. Caspase-3 Assay—2T3 cells were treated with TNF (2.5, 5, and 7.5 ng/ml) for 24, 48, and 72 h and then lysed in a buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 200 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and aprotinin (0.27 mm trypsin inhibitor/ml). Caspase-3 activity was determined by incubation of cell lysate (containing 25 μg of total protein) with 50 μm fluorogenic substrate, N-acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (Calbiochem) in 200 μl of 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), containing 220 mm mannitol, 68 mm sucrose, 2 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KH2PO4, 0.5 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm pyruvate, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The release of fluorescent 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin was measured by spectrofluorometry (excitation/emission, 499/521 nm). MTT Cell Viability Assay—Cell viability was determined by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT, Sigma) dye reduction assay according to the method of Green et al. (26.Green L.M. Reade J.L. Ware C.F. J. Immunol. Methods. 1984; 70: 257-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). Briefly, after cells in 96-well plates were treated with various concentrations of TNF for 24, 48, or 96 h, 10 μl of MTT was added for 3 h, and the absorbance was read at 540 nm. Cell viability was calculated as the ratio of optical densities in wells with and without TNF. Statistics Analysis—All data are represented as the mean ± S.E. Comparisons of results were performed by paired Student's t tests, accepting p < 0.05 as the criterion of significance. All experiments were repeated at least twice with similar results. TNF-Tg Mice Have Reduced Osteoblast Function—The TNF transgenic mouse is a well established animal model of rheumatoid arthritis, which exhibits polyarthritis because of chronic exposure to low levels of TNF (27.Keffer J. Probert L. Cazlaris H. Georgopoulos S. Kaslaris E. Kioussis D. Kollias G. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4025-4031Crossref PubMed Scopus (1341) Google Scholar). At 3-4 months of age, TNF-Tg mice develop a moderate to severe form of rheumatoid arthritis-like joint inflammation and destruction. This is characterized by chronic inflammation, local bone and cartilage erosion, and increased circulating TNF levels (27.Keffer J. Probert L. Cazlaris H. Georgopoulos S. Kaslaris E. Kioussis D. Kollias G. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4025-4031Crossref PubMed Scopus (1341) Google Scholar, 28.Li P. Schwarz E.M. O'Keefe R.J. Ma L. Looney R.J. Ritchlin C.T. Boyce B.F. Xing L. Arthritis Rheum. 2004; 50: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Apart from these well described features, animals develop general osteoporosis as show in Fig. 1A. Trabecular bone is markedly reduced in the metaphysis of long bones of TNF-Tg mice, compared with wt littermates (Fig. 1B). To examine whether osteoblast function is altered in TNF-Tg mice, bone marrow stromal cells were isolated from 4-month-old TNF-Tg mice and wt littermates. Cells were cultured in osteoblast differentiation medium to form mineralized bone nodules. Compared with wt mice, cells from TNF-Tg mice formed significantly fewer and smaller nodules under basal conditions and in the presence of BMP-2 (Fig. 1, C and D), indicating reduced osteoblast function. TNF Increases Smurf1 Expression, Runx2 Degradation, and Ubiquitination of Runx2 Protein—Smurf1 is a negative regulator of the BMP signaling pathway and inhibits osteoblast function by promoting Runx2 degradation (17.Zhao M. Qiao M. Oyajobi B.O. Mundy G.R. Chen D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27939-27944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). To determine whether TNF affects Smurf1 expression, C2C12 myoblast/osteoblast precursor cells, 2T3 osteoblast precursors, and primary wt calvarial preosteoblasts were treated with PBS or 2.5-7.5 ng/ml TNF. Smurf1 expression was measured by real time RT-PCR at 24, 48, and 72 h. The highest dose of TNF (7.5 ng/ml) significantly increased Smurf1 mRNA levels at 24 h in both cell lines, with the highest indication being observed at 72 h. At this time, the lowest dose of TNF (2.5 ng/ml) also had increased Smurf1 mRNA expression (Fig. 2A). TNF-induced Smurf1 expression was similar in 2T3 and C2C12 cells. No significant increase in Smurf1 level was observed when the cells were treated with 7.5 ng/ml TNF for 2, 4, 8, and 12 h (data not shown). Consistent with these mRNA results, TNF increased Smurf1 protein expression in a dose-dependent manner after 24 h (Fig. 2B). Similarly, TNF also increased Smurf1 expression in primary preosteoblasts. TNF increased Smurf1 mRNA levels in these cells by 4-5-fold over the PBS-treated cells at 48 h (the ratio of Smurf1/β-actin in TNF-treated group versus that from PBS group: 4.7 ± 0.14, p < 0.002). To determine the specificity of TNF for Smurf1, C2C12 and 2T3 cells were treated with IL-1 or receptor activator NF-κB ligand (RANKL) that activate intracellular signaling pathways similar to those activated by TNF. They did not alter Smurf1 mRNA abundance (Fig. 2C). These doses of IL-1 and RANKL (10 ng/ml) stimulate osteoclast formation from osteoclast precursors (data not shown). To examine whether TNF-induced apoptosis is associated with increased Smurf1 expression, 2T3 cells were treated with various doses of TNF for 24, 48, and 72 h. Apoptosis was determined by measuring caspase-3 activity and cell viability by MTT assay. Smurf1 mRNA expression was examined by real time PCR in the same samples. At the doses (2.5-7.5 ng/ml) that TNF increased Smurf1 expression (data not shown), osteoblasts were morphological normal with normal caspase-3 activity (Fig. 2D). In contrast, cells treated with 10 and 20 ng/ml TNF induced cell apoptosis, and dead cells were detached from the culture plates (data not shown). To determine whether TNF induces Runx2 degradation, C2C12 or 2T3 cells were cotransfected with FLAG-tagged-Runx2 (F-Runx2) and/or Myc-tagged-Smurf1 (M-Smurf1) expression vectors or an empty vector in the presence of TNF. F-Runx2 expression was detected by Western blot analysis using an anti-FLAG antibody. As a positive control, Smurf1 overexpression decreased F-Runx2 protein levels. Similar to Smurf1 overexpression, TNF significantly reduced F-Runx2 protein levels in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2E). Smurf1 induces Runx2 degradation by increasing its ubiquitination (17.Zhao M. Qiao M. Oyajobi B.O. Mundy G.R. Chen D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27939-27944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). If TNF-induced Runx2 degradation is mediated by Smurf1, we should be able to detect increased ubiquitinated-Runx2 complexes in TNF-treated cells. To test this hypothesis, 2T3 cells were treated with TNF in the presence and absence of the proteasomal inhibitor MG132, and endogenous Runx2 protein was immunoprecipitated with an anti-Runx2 antibody and followed by Western blot analysis using an anti-ubiquitin antibody. MG132 treatment revealed small amounts of ubiquitinated Runx2 in vehicle-treated cells. These were greatly increased in the presence of TNF (Fig. 3), indicating that TNF induces ubiquitination of Runx2 protein, leading to its rapid breakdown through proteasomal degradation. TNF-induced Runx2 Degradation Is Dependent on Smurf1 and Smurf2—To determine whether TNF-induced Runx2 degradation is dependent on Smurf1, 2T3 cells were infected first with retroviral supernatant containing double-stranded siRNA specific for Smurf1 to knock down endogenous Smurf1. They were then transfected with F-Runx2 in the presence of TNF. Smurf1 siRNA decreased TNF-induced Smurf1 mRNA by 95% and reduced Smurf1 expression in PBS-treated cells to almost undetectable levels (Fig. 4A). Without changing the expression of Smurf2 mRNA (Fig. 4B), Smurf1 siRNA partially blocked TNF-mediated inhibition of ALP mRNA expression compared with the empty vector control (Fig. 4C) and reduced TNF-induced Runx2 degradation by 30% (by a densitometric analysis, Fig. 4D).

https://openalex.org/W2155670471,"Exposure of erythrocytes to osmotic shock, oxidative stress, and energy depletion activates Cl--sensitive and Ca2+-permeable cation channels. Subsequent Ca2+ entry triggers eryptosis, characterized by erythrocyte shrinkage, membrane blebbing, and phosphatidylserine exposure all features typical for apoptotic death of nucleated cells. Erythrocytes exposing phosphatidylserine are recognized, bound, engulfed, and degraded by macrophages. Eryptosis thus fosters clearance of affected erythrocytes from circulating blood. Iron deficiency leads to anemia, in part by decreasing erythrocyte life span. In this study, phosphatidylserine exposure, cell size, and cytosolic Ca2+ were measured by FACS analysis of annexin-V binding, forward scatter, and Fluo-3 fluorescence, respectively. Erythrocytes from mice on control diet were compared with erythrocytes from mice exposed 10 weeks to iron-deficient diet. Iron deficiency significantly (P<0.001) enhanced erythrocyte annexin-V binding (from 2.4 to 3.7%), decreased forward scatter (from 544 to 393), and increased cytosolic Ca2+ concentration. 45Ca2+ flux measurements and patch clamp experiments revealed enhanced Ca2+ uptake (by 2.3-fold) and cation channel activity. The half-life of fluorescence-labeled, iron-deficient, or Ca2+-loaded erythrocytes was significantly reduced compared with control erythrocytes. Thus, the experiments reveal a novel mechanism triggered by iron deficiency, which presumably contributes to accelerated clearance of erythrocytes in iron deficiency anemia."
https://openalex.org/W1966881442,"The post-perovskite phase of (Mg,Fe)SiO3 is believed to be the main mineral phase of the Earth's lowermost mantle (the D"" layer). Its properties explain numerous geophysical observations associated with this layer - for example, the D'' discontinuity, its topography and seismic anisotropy within the layer. Here we use a novel simulation technique, first-principles metadynamics, to identify a family of low-energy polytypic stacking-fault structures intermediate between the perovskite and post-perovskite phases. Metadynamics trajectories identify plane sliding involving the formation of stacking faults as the most favourable pathway for the phase transition, and as a likely mechanism for plastic deformation of perovskite and postperovskite. In particular, the predicted slip planes are (010) for perovskite (consistent with experiment) and (110) for postperovskite (in contrast to the previously expected (010) slip planes). Dominant slip planes define the lattice preferred orientation and elastic anisotropy of the texture. The (110) slip planes in post-perovskite require a much smaller degree of lattice preferred orientation to explain geophysical observations of shear-wave anisotropy in the D"" layer."

Increased urinary and plasma F2-isoprostane levels are associated with a number of human diseases. These metabolites are regarded as excellent markers of oxidant stress in vivo.

F2-isoprostanes (F2-IPs) 2The abbreviations used are: F2-IPs, F2-isoprostanes; PAF, platelet-activating factor; POVPC, 1-palmitoyl-2-(5-oxovaleroyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; PG, prostaglandin; IP, isoprostane; LCAT, lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase; PON-1, paraoxonase-1; HDL, high density lipoprotein; LDL, low density lipoprotein; BAL, bronchoalveolar lavage; GC-MS, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; tTS, tetracycline-controlled transcriptional silencer; tet, tetracycline. are a family of prostaglandin (PG)-like compounds produced in vivo primarily by a nonenzymatic, free radical-induced oxidation of arachidonic acid (1Morrow J.D. Hill K.E. Burk R.F. Nammour T.M. Badr K.F. Roberts II, L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9383-9387Crossref PubMed Scopus (1719) Google Scholar). These compounds are generated in situ esterified to phospholipids through the formation of PGH2-like bicyclic endoperoxide intermediates. These intermediates can either undergo rearrangement to E2/D2-IPs, isothromboxanes, and highly reactive isoketals or become reduced to F2-IPs that have been characterized in detail. Following in situ oxidation, IPs are released in free form by the action of phospholipase(s) activity. The measurement of F2-IPs in biological fluids has become one of the most accepted quantitative assessments of lipid peroxidation and oxidant stress reactions that occur in vivo (2Roberts L.J. Morrow J.D. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). This approach provides the advantage of being noninvasive, as F2-IPs circulate freely in plasma and are excreted in urine. Increased IP production has been observed in a number of human diseases associated with oxidant stress, including atherosclerosis, pulmonary and liver diseases, habitual smoking, neurological disorders, and diabetes (3Pratico D. Lawson J.A. Rokach J. FitzGerald G.A. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 12: 243-247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Pratico D. Rokach J. Lawson J. FitzGerald G.A. Chem. Phys.

In addition, exposure of experimental animals to increased oxidant stress also results in remarkable increases in the levels of free IPs in the urine and in plasma (2Roberts L.J. Morrow J.D. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar, 6Roberts II, L.J. Morrow J.D. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 808-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Perhaps more important than being excellent markers of oxidant stress, products of the IP pathway mediate diverse biological events that include vasoconstriction (7Hou X. Roberts II, L.J. Gobeil Jr., F. Taber D. Kanai K. Abran D. Brault S. Checchin D. Sennlaub F. Lachapelle P. Varma D. Chemtob S. Free Radic. Biol.

Biochem. 2003; 253: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The ability of IPs to engage receptors and mediate intracellular signaling events classifies this family of molecules as lipid messengers. A unique aspect of the genesis of IPs, compared with PGs formed as products of the cyclooxygenase enzyme, is that IPs are initially generated in situ, although the arachidonate precursor remains esterified in phospholipids, and are subsequently released in free form (9Morrow J.D. Awad J.A. Boss H.J. Blair I.A. Roberts II, L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10721-10725Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). The mechanism(s) responsible for the release of these mediators after generation in membrane phospholipids is, for the most part, unknown. Phospholipase A2 is likely involved, but the identity of the enzyme(s) is currently unknown. Here we tested the hypothesis that platelet-activating factor (PAF) acetylhydrolases release F2-IPs from esterified phosphatidylcholine precursors. The rationale was based on previous work that demonstrated high specificity of the plasma form of PAF acetylhydrolase (10Stremler K.E. Stafforini D.M. Prescott S.M. McIntyre T.M. J. Biol.

We found that both the secreted form of PAF acetylhydrolase and intracellular PAF acetylhydrolase II released F2-IPs from the sn-2 position of phosphatidylcholine with high affinity. For the first time, these results establish that PAF acetylhydrolases have the capacity to release F2-IPs esterified in phospholipids, thus expanding our understanding of the mechanism by which these enzymes may modulate oxidant stress in vivo. Plasma PAF Acetylhydrolase—Human recombinant PAF acetylhydrolase (Pafase®) was a kind gift from ICOS Corp., Bothell, WA. The specific activity of this preparation was 172 μmol/min/mg using PAF as the substrate, a value that compares favorably to those reported by Tew et al. (14Tew D.G. Southan C. Rice S.Q.

PAF Acetylhydrolase II Expression and Purification—The cDNA encoding human PAF acetylhydrolase II was amplified from a commercially available plasmid (American Type Culture Collection) using primers tagged with XbaI and EcoRI sites. The products were digested and then cloned into pcDNA 3.1/Zeo– (Invitrogen) for expression in mammalian cells. The sequence of the insert was verified and confirmed to be correct by automated sequence analysis. The cDNA (1 μg) was transfected into individual 35-mm wells coated with COS7 cells, using Lipofectamine, following the instructions provided by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). After 24–48 h, we harvested the cells using lysis buffer (Promega) and employed these extracts in enzymatic analyses that tested the suitability of PAF and esterified F2-IPs as substrates. The specific activity of these extracts was 46.7 nmol/min/mg using PAF as the substrate, a value that compares favorably to that reported previously by Hattori et al. (17Hattori K. Adachi H.

For purification, a FLAG epitope (MDYKDDDDK) was added to the amino terminus, using PCR and Pfu polymerase (Invitrogen). Extracts from transfected COS7 cells were subjected to purification using FLAG affinity chromatography, following the instructions provided by the manufacturer (Sigma). The purified preparation had a specific activity of 4.2 μmol/min/mg using PAF as the substrate, a value similar to that reported for PAF acetylhydrolase II purified from bovine liver (17Hattori K.

The isolated protein was >99% pure as judged by electrophoresis on SDS-PAGE (supplemental Fig. S1). Synthesis of POVPC—This compound was synthesized exactly as described by Itabe et al. (18Itabe H. Suzuki K. Hosoya R. Mori M. Higashi Y. Fujimoto Y. Takano T. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 285: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) using a mixture of 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (Avanti Polar Lipids) and the 2–1-14C-labeled compound (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as the starting materials. We purified [14C]POVPC by thin layer chromatography (18Itabe H. Suzuki K. Hosoya R. Mori M. Higashi Y. Fujimoto Y. Takano T. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 285: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) and then assessed the concentration of the final product by lipid phosphate analysis using the method of Ames and Dubin (19Ames B.N. Dubin D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 769-775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Release of Acetate from PAF and 5-Oxovaleraldehyde from POVPC— Enzyme activity levels were determined as described previously (20Stafforini D.M. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 187: 344-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) using either [acetyl-3H]PAF or [14C]POVPC, with minor modifications. These changes were necessary to standardize assays in which the use of esterified F2-IP substrates required the presence of detergents for solubilization. We supplemented CHAPS (final concentration 0.8 mm) to assays using the plasma form of PAF acetylhydrolase. For assays of intracellular PAF acetylhydrolase II, we supplemented CHAPS (2 mm) and dithiothreitol (2 mm). Isolation of Phospholipid-esterified F2-IPs and Measurement of Esterified and Free F2-IPs—Phospholipid esterified F2-IPs were extracted from livers of CCl4-treated rats and purified by normal phase high pressure liquid chromatography as described previously (9Morrow J.D. Awad J.A. Boss H.J. Blair I.A. Roberts II, L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10721-10725Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Free and esterified F2-IPs were measured by a stable isotope dilution GC-MS assay, as described (21Morrow J.D. Roberts II, L.J. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 300: 3-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). The percent of F2-IPs hydrolyzed from the phospholipids by PAF acetylhydrolases was determined by comparing the ratio of the amount of free F2-IPs to the total of free plus esterified F2-IPs. Release of F2-IPs from Esterified Phospholipids—The amount of substrate necessary for each set of assays was dried under a stream of nitrogen, resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.8–2 mm CHAPS (see below), and then sonicated for 10 min at room temperature. Unless indicated otherwise, the assays contained esterified F2-IPs (150 nm for plasma PAF acetylhydrolase and 300 nm for PAF acetylhydrolase II), CHAPS (0.8 mm for plasma PAF acetylhydrolase and 2 mm for PAF acetylhydrolase II), 2 mm dithiothreitol (for PAF acetylhydrolase II only), the enzyme source, and phosphate-buffered saline in a total volume of 50 μl. The addition of CHAPS at the indicated concentrations was necessary for optimal hydrolysis; omission of detergent from the assays resulted in poor rates of F2-IP release. Initial studies were conducted to optimize the assay conditions so that product release increased as a function of time and enzyme concentration in a linear fashion. Unless otherwise stated, the incubations were conducted for 30 min at 37 °C in a water incubator and then snap-frozen at –80 °C until F2-IP quantitation. The levels of free and total IPs were assessed in each sample. For Km determinations, substrate concentrations were calculated from the total amount of F2-IP in the assays, a value that was experimentally determined. These values were usually within 10–20% of the theoretical concentrations. The results were also corrected for a small amount of free F2-IP present in the substrate. Construction of Inducible Transgenic Mice for Expression of PAF Acetylhydrolase in Airway Epithelium—The human PAF acetylhydrolase cDNA was a gift of Dr. L. Tjoelker (ICOS Corp., Bothell, WA). A BstXI fragment was digested from a pRc/CMV vector. The overhanging ends of the fragment were filled in, and the resulting fragment was ligated into the EcoRV site within the multicloning region of a modified pBluescript II SK expression vector containing the (tet-O)7-CMV promoter that consists of seven copies of the tet operator DNA binding sequence linked to a minimal cytomegalovirus promoter (obtained from Dr. J. Whitsett, University of Cincinnati). The expression vector also contained human growth hormone polyadenylation sequences to ensure transcript termination. A 2.3-kb (tet-O)7-PAF acetylhydrolase microinjection fragment was released from the vector with an AscI digestion. To prevent basal leakiness of transgene expression, a construct expressing tetracycline-controlled transcriptional silencer (tTS) under the control of the Clara cell-specific CC10 promoter (CC10-tTS) was obtained from Dr. Jack Elias (Yale University, with permission from Andrew Farmer, Clontech). We purified both (tet-O)7-PAF acetylhydrolase and CC10-tTS constructs using a GELase™-agarose gel-digesting preparation kit following the manufacturer’s instructions (Epicenter, Madison, WI). These constructs were coinjected at the Vanderbilt Transgenic/ES Cell Shared Resource to generate transgenic lines of mice that have cointegrated both the (tet-O)7/CMV-PAF acetylhydrolase and CC10-tTS transgenes. The mice were generated on an FVB background. Transgenic mice were genotyped using DNA from tail biopsies. Founder animals were genotyped by Southern blot, and then further generations were genotyped by PCR analysis for increased efficiency. A 1318-bp BamHI/SphI fragment from the PAF acetylhydrolase construct and a 700-bp XbaI/BamHI fragment from the CC10-tTS construct were used as probes for Southern analysis. Primers used for PCR of the (tet-O)7/CMV-PAF acetylhydrolase transgene were as follows: 5′-primer, 5′-GGA GGC CTA TAT AAG CAG AGC-3′;3′-primer, 5′-TCC AAA GGG TGT CAA GGC GAT-3′. The product size was 548 bp. Primers used for identification of the CC10-tTS transgene were as follows: upstream, 5′-GAG TTG GCA GCA GTT TCT CC-3′; downstream, 5′-GAG CAC AGC CAC ATC TTC AA-3′. The product size was 472 bp. PCR protocols for both (tet-O)7/CMV-PAF acetylhydrolase and CC10-tTS were as follows: 1 cycle at 94 °C for 2 min; 30 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 56 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min; and 1 cycle at 72 °C for 10 min. Mice transgenic for CC10-tTS/(tet-O)7-CMV-PAF acetylhydrolase were mated with CC10-rtTA homozygous mice (obtained from Dr. J. Whitsett, University of Cincinnati) to generate triple transgenic mice. To induce transgene expression, mice were provided with 1–2 mg/ml doxycycline (Sigma) in 2% sucrose ad libitum in drinking water. The drinking bottle was wrapped with foil to prevent light-induced doxycycline degradation. Doxycycline water was replaced twice each week. Ovalbumin Sensitization—We sensitized mice to ovalbumin by intraperitoneal injection of ovalbumin/alum. Fourteen days later, we began an 8-day series of inhaled 1% ovalbumin challenges. Doxycycline (2 mg/ml) was supplemented to the drinking water for 7 days prior to treatment with aerosolized ovalbumin. A day after the last challenge, mice were anesthetized and underwent bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) for measurement of PAF-hydrolyzing capacity and F2-IP by GC-MS, as described above. All animal experiments were conducted with the approval of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and in accordance with their rules and regulations. Statistics—The data are reported as the means ± S.D. Unless otherwise indicated, the experiments were conducted twice using similar conditions. An Enzymatic Activity in Human Plasma Releases Free F2-IPs from Phospholipid-esterified Precursors—We initially explored whether the plasma fraction of blood contains an enzymatic activity that releases free F2-IPs from esterified precursors. We incubated human plasma samples (0.1 μl) or buffer with phospholipid-esterified F2-IPs (2 ng) for 30 min at 37 °C in a total volume of 50 μl. We found that 10.2 ± 3.0% of the substrate was hydrolyzed to free F2-IPs. Under the same assay conditions (30 min at 37 °C), PAF (4 μmol) and the oxidized phospholipid POVPC (0.9 μmol) were hydrolyzed by 9.5 ± 0.1 and 34 ± 1.6%, respectively. Thus, human plasma contains an enzymatic activity that releases F2-IPs from esterified phospholipids. The Enzymatic Activity That Hydrolyzes Esterified F2-IPs in Plasma Comigrates with PAF Acetylhydrolase on Density Gradients—Human plasma contains a number of esterolytic activities, including lecithin: cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), paraoxonase-1 (PON-1), and PAF acetylhydrolase. The first two enzymes associate with high density lipoprotein (HDL), whereas PAF acetylhydrolase is found in both HDL and low density lipoprotein (LDL) (11Stremler K.E. Stafforini D.M. Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5331-5334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Stafforini D.M. McIntyre T.M. Carter M.E. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4215-4222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We subjected human plasma to ultracentrifugation on a KBr density gradient and then assayed individual fractions for their ability to hydrolyze PAF, POVPC, and phospholipid-esterified F2-IPs. We found that the activities comigrated on density gradients and that the ratio between the HDL- and LDL-associated activities was the same using the three individual substrates (Fig. 1). Plasma from PAF Acetylhydrolase-deficient Subjects Fails to Release F2-IPs from the Esterified Parent Compounds—The results from our experiments suggest that PAF acetylhydrolase is the main phospholipase in plasma with the ability to release F2-IPs from esterified precursors. LCAT exhibits ∼1% of the hydrolytic activity of PAF acetylhydrolase using PAF as the substrate (23Liu M. Subbaiah P.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6035-6039Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). If this enzymatic activity had significantly contributed to F2-IP release, we would have observed altered ratios between the HDL- and LDL-associated activities using individual substrates. Thus, LCAT either does not contribute to F2-IP release, it does so to a much lower extent than PAF acetylhydrolase, or it requires additional components for optimal activity. PON-1 has been reported previously to utilize PAF (24Rodrigo L. Mackness B. Durrington P.N. Hernandez A. Mackness M.I. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), oxidized phospholipids (25Ahmed Z. Ravandi A. Maguire G.F. Emili A. Draganov D. La Du B.N. Kuksis A. Connelly P.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 391-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and esterified IPs (25Ahmed Z. Ravandi A. Maguire G.F. Emili A. Draganov D. La Du B.N. Kuksis A. Connelly P.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 391-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) as substrates. However, Marathe et al. (26Marathe G.K. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3937-3947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) demonstrated that minute contamination of PON-1 preparations with PAF acetylhydrolase account for the phospholipase activity previously ascribed to PON-1, a finding later confirmed by Connelly et al. (27Connelly P.W. Draganov D. Maguire G.F. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2005; 38: 164-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Thus, our data are consistent with the notion that PAF acetylhydrolase is the main phospholipase in plasma that catalyzes the release of F2-IPs from esterified sources and that neither LCAT nor PON-1 contribute, or do so to a much lower extent, to the HDL-associated F2-IP-releasing activity. To directly test the hypothesis that PAF acetylhydrolase is the only phospholipase in plasma with the ability to release F2-IPs from esterified precursors, we obtained plasma from Japanese subjects that were either partially or completely deficient in plasma PAF acetylhydrolase activity because of a point mutation (V279F) that introduces a critical change near the active site of this enzyme (28Stafforini D.M. Satoh K. Atkinson D.L. Tjoelker L.W. Eberhardt C. Yoshida H. Imaizumi T. Takamatsu S. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Gray P.W. Prescott S.M. J. Clin. Investig. 1996; 97: 2784-2791Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). We found that plasma from PAF acetylhydrolase-deficient subjects did not hydrolyze PAF or POVPC, as expected (28Stafforini D.M. Satoh K. Atkinson D.L. Tjoelker L.W. Eberhardt C. Yoshida H. Imaizumi T. Takamatsu S. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Gray P.W. Prescott S.M. J. Clin. Investig. 1996; 97: 2784-2791Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), and that F2-IPs were not released from esterified phosphatidylcholine (Fig. 2). In addition, plasma from heterozygous subjects had 50% of the hydrolytic capacity displayed by plasma from wild-type controls (Fig. 2). These results complement those reported above and demonstrate that PAF acetylhydrolase is the main plasma activity with the ability to release F2-IPs from esterified precursors. Intracellular PAF Acetylhydrolase Utilizes Esterified F2-IPs as Substrates—The occurrence of esterified F2-IPs in cellular as well as extracellular tissues prompted us to investigate phospholipase activities that could release F2-IPs from cellular precursors in the intracellular compartment. We reasoned that such activity(ies) are likely to share a number of structural features with the plasma form of PAF acetylhydrolase because they both should recognize similar substrates. The intracellular PAF acetylhydrolase II has similar substrate specificity and is 41% homologous to the plasma isoform (17Hattori K. Adachi H. Matsuzawa A. Yamamoto K. Tsujimoto M. Aoki J. Hattori M. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33032-33038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). We expressed the cDNA encoding FLAG-tagged PAF acetylhydrolase II in COS7 cells, and we then tested the ability of extracts from transfected cells to release acetate and F2-IPs. We found that extracts from cells transfected with the PAF acetylhydrolase II cDNA released F2-IPs from esterified precursors at a faster rate than cells transfected with empty vector (75.1 ± 2.2 and 24.3 ± 0.9 pmol/min/mg protein, respectively). The PAF acetylhydrolase-transfected cells hydrolyzed PAF efficiently (46.7 ± 1.2 nmol/min/mg protein). We detected virtually no enzymatic activity in the vector-transfected cell extracts. PAF acetylhydrolase II is the first reported intracellular phospholipase with the ability to release F2-IPs from esterified precursors. However, these data do not rule out the possibility that other intracellular phospholipase activities, such as cytosolic phospholipase A2, can also catalyze this reaction. F2-IP Levels in Transgenic Mice That Overexpress the Plasma Form of PAF Acetylhydrolase—Our next goal was to establish if the findings made using purified systems are recapitulated in vivo. We generated transgenic mice that overexpressed the plasma form of PAF acetylhydrolase under the control of the Clara cell-specific CC10 promoter. We sensitized the mice to ovalbumin and then challenged the animals with aerosolized ovalbumin, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” We found that BAL fluid from transgenic animals hydrolyzed PAF to a much larger extent compared with wild-type congenic controls, as expected (Fig. 3A). In addition, the level of F2-IPs in the nontransgenic BAL fluid was 0.053 ± 0.008 pg/ml (mean ± S.E., n = 8) versus 0.098 ± 0.010 in the transgenic mice (p < 0.003 by unpaired t test with Welch’s correction; Fig. 3B). These results are consistent with our in vitro biochemical data, and they demonstrate that PAF acetylhydrolase increases F2-IP release from esterified precursors in vivo. Kinetics of F2-IP-PC Hydrolysis by Plasma and Intracellular PAF Acetylhydrolases—To rigorously compare the relative efficiencies with which PAF, POVPC, and esterified F2-IPs are metabolized, we studied the kinetics of hydrolysis of each substrate using purified PAF acetylhydrolases in mixed micellar assays. We investigated the efficiency of hydrolysis of PAF, POVPC, and esterified F2-IPs at various substrate concentrations (Figs. 4 and 5). We found that the plasma form of PAF acetylhydrolase recognized esterified F2-IPs with much higher affinity relative to PAF and POVPC (Km values of 4.5 nm and 5.2 and 19.3 μm for F2-IP-PC, PAF, and POVPC, respectively; Fig. 4). Conversely, the rate of product release was much slower with F2-IP-PC versus PAF and POVPC (46.3 nmol/min/mg versus 172.4 and 116.3 μmol/min/mg, respectively). The much higher rate of PAF and POVPC versus F2-IP-PC hydrolysis was observed using enzyme sources at various stages of purification (not shown). However, the ratio of activities obtained using individual substrates increased after purification. In normal plasma, this ratio was 550 (Fig. 2), but in lipoproteins it increased to ∼1,000 (Fig. 1) and to over 2,000 using the purified recombinant protein (Fig. 4). The basis for this phenomenon is unknown. The possibility that purification results in the loss of additional activities that can hydrolyze F2-IP-PC is unlikely because we observed no F2-IP-PC hydrolysis in plasma from PAF acetylhydrolase-deficient subjects (Fig. 2). We speculate that lipid or lipoprotein components that are lost during purificati"

https://openalex.org/W2131755255,"Protein misfolding and aberrant aggregation are associated with many severe disorders, such as neural degenerative diseases, desmin-related myopathy (DRM), and congestive heart failure. Intrasarcoplasmic amyloidosis and increased ubiquitinated proteins are observed in human failing hearts. The pathogenic roles of these derangements in the heart remain unknown. The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) plays a central role in intracellular proteolysis and regulates critical cellular processes. In cultured cells, aberrant aggregation by a mutant (MT) or misfolded protein impairs the UPS. However, this has not been demonstrated in intact animals, and it is unclear how the UPS is impaired. Cross-breeding UPS reporter mice with a transgenic mouse model of DRM featured by aberrant protein aggregation in cardiomyocytes, we found that overexpression of MT-desmin but not normal desmin protein impairs UPS proteolytic function in the heart. The primary defect does not appear to be in the ubiquitination or the proteolytic activity of the 20S proteasome, because ubiquitinated proteins and the peptidase activities of 20S proteasomes were significantly increased rather than decreased in the DRM heart. Therefore, the defect resides apparently in the entry of ubiquitinated proteins into the 20S proteasome. Consistent with this notion, key components (Rpt3 and Rpt5) of 19S proteasomes were markedly decreased, while major components of 20S proteasomes were increased. Additional experiments with HEK cells suggest that proteasomal malfunction observed in MT-desmin hearts is not secondary to cardiac malfunction or to disruption of desmin filaments. Thus, UPS impairment may represent an important pathogenic mechanism underlying cardiac disorders with abnormal protein aggregation."

https://openalex.org/W2113268356,"Inhibition of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) function by TNF-α contributes to glucose and fatty acid metabolic disorders in inflammation and cancer, although the molecular mechanism is not fully understood. In this study, we demonstrate that nuclear translocation of HDAC3 is regulated by TNF-α, and this event is required for inhibition of transcriptional activity of PPARγ by TNF-α. HDAC3 is associated with IκBα in the cytoplasm. After IκBα degradation in response to TNF-α, HDAC3 is subject to nuclear translocation, leading to an increase in HDAC3 activity in the nucleus. This event leads to subcellular redistribution of HDAC3. Knock-out of IκBα, but not p65 or p50, leads to disappearance of HDAC3 in the cytoplasm, which is associated with HDAC3 enrichment in the nucleus. These data suggest that inhibition of PPARγ by TNF-α is not associated with a reduction in the DNA binding activity of PPARγ. Rather, these results suggest that IκBα-dependent nuclear translocation of HDAC3 is responsible for PPARγ inhibition by TNF-α."

Here, we found that restoration of RUNX3 expression in the cell line not expressing RUNX3 induced apoptosis and that it physically interacted with the Forkhead transcription factor FoxO3a/FKHRL1, known to be an important regulator of apoptosis and the cell cycle. Active unphosphorylated FoxO3a/FKHRL1 was expressed in the gastric cancer cell lines. RUNX3-induced apoptosis depended on the expression of Bim, a proapoptotic BH3-only protein, and both RUNX3 and FoxO3a/FKHRL1 were required for induction of Bim expression. Furthermore, we showed that interaction of RUNX3 and FoxO3a/FKHRL1 was also indispensable for Bim expression and apoptosis in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. In the Bim promoter, RUNX3 bound to two conserved RUNX-binding elements (RBE1 and RBE2), with RBE1 being immediately downstream of a FoxO-binding element. The physical interaction of RUNX3 and FoxO3a/FKHRL1 on the Bim promoter activated transcription of Bim.

They have a highly conserved Runt domain responsible for DNA binding and heterodimer formation with the β subunit (PEBP2β/CBFβ) (1Ito Y. Miyazono K. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2003; 13: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Three Runx transcription factors, Runx1, Runx2, and Runx3, have been identified in mammals. Although all these α subunits have closely related structures and biochemical properties and bind the same DNA-binding motifs (1Ito Y. Miyazono K. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2003; 13: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), they possess distinct biological functions in vivo. Runx1 is essential for definitive hematopoiesis, Runx2 plays critical roles in osteoblast maturation and osteogenesis, and Runx3 is ubiquitously expressed and involved in a variety of biological activities including development of gastrointestinal tract, neurogenesis, and lineage specification of thymocytes (1Ito Y. Miyazono K. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2003; 13: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Abnormalities in human Runx (RUNX) genes have been linked with some diseases (1Ito Y. Miyazono K. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2003; 13: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 2Balmain A. Nature. 2002; 417: 235-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). RUNX1/AML1 is an important translocation break-point in acute leukemias and heterozygous loss of RUNX2 causes cleidocranial dysplasia syndrome. RUNX3 is implicated as a tumor suppressor gene in gastric cancer. Runx3-deficient mice exhibit hyperplasias in gastric mucosa due to reduced apoptosis and stimulated proliferation of gastric epithelial cells. Gastric epithelial cells are less sensitive to the proapoptotic and growth inhibitory effects of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) (3Li Q.L. Ito K. Sakakura C. Fukamachi H. Inoue K. Chi X.Z.

Furthermore, RUNX3 is inactivated in 40% of early stage and in nearly 90% of advanced stage gastric carcinomas by hemizygous deletion and hypermethylation of its promoter (3Li Q.L. Ito K. Sakakura C. Fukamachi H. Inoue K. Chi X.Z. Lee K.Y. Nomura S. Lee C.W. Han S.B. Kim H.M. Kim W.J. Yamamoto H. Yamashita N. Yano T. Ikeda T. Itohara S. Inazawa J. Abe T. Hagiwara A. Yamagishi H. Ooe A. Kaneda A.

Among the three Runx transcription factors, Runx3 is predominantly induced by TGF-β to bind and activate the germ line Ig α promoter, thereby directing Ig class switching to IgA in splenic B cells and the surface IgM+ B cell line I.29μ (4Shi M.J. Stavnezer J. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6751-6760PubMed Google Scholar). RUNX3 interacts physically with Smad transcription factors (Smads), which are signal transducers of TGF-β, and induces TGF-β-dependent transcription of the germ line Ig α promoter in a cooperative manner (5Hanai J. Chen L.F. Kanno T. Ohtani-Fujita N. Kim W.Y. Guo W.H. Imamura T. Ishidou Y. Fukuchi M. Shi M.J. Stavnezer J. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Ito Y. J. Biol.

Although these findings suggest that RUNX3 cooperates with its putative cofactor to exert its role as a tumor suppressor by activating proapoptotic genes, little is known about the molecular mechanisms whereby RUNX3 induces apoptosis. Members of the FoxO subfamily of Forkhead transcription factors represent the mammalian orthologs of DAF-16, which regulates longevity in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. In mammals, FoxO subfamily members regulate diverse cell functions, such as apoptosis, cell cycle progression, and DNA repair (7Accili D. Arden K.C. Cell. 2004; 117: 421-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar). The serine/threonine kinase Akt/PKB (protein kinase B) regulates the activities of three FoxO proteins, FoxO1/FKHR, FoxO3a/FKHRL1, and FoxO4/AFX (8Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5410) Google Scholar). Akt/PKB rapidly phosphorylates FoxO proteins following its activation by phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). In turn, the phosphorylated FoxO proteins associate with 14-3-3 protein, which functions as a scaffold within the cytoplasm, and are sequestered within the cytosol, rendering them unable to bind to the promoters of their target genes in the nucleus to regulate their transcription. Recently, IκB kinase has also been shown to phosphorylate and inactivate FoxO3a in breast cancer cells (9Hu M.C. Lee D.F. Xia W. Golfman L.S. Ou-Yang F. Yang J.Y. Zou Y. Bao S. Hanada N. Saso H. Kobayashi R. Hung M.C. Cell. 2004; 117: 225-237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). In contrast, unphosphorylated FoxO proteins are active forms and are located in the nucleus where they bind to the promoters of their target genes. FoxO3a has been shown to mediate apoptosis by activating proapoptotic genes in a variety of cells. Overexpression of constitutively active FoxO3a induces apoptosis by activating the Fas ligand (FasL) expression and the Fas-FasL apoptotic pathway in the human leukemia T cell line Jurkat (8Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5410) Google Scholar). FoxO3a is responsible for Bim-mediated apoptosis in the interleukin (IL)-3-dependent pre-B cell line Ba/F3 and the IL-2-dependent T cell line CTLL-2 following the withdrawal of IL-3 and IL-2 from their cultures, respectively (10Dijkers P.F.

Coffer P.J. Burgering B.M. Medema R.H. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 5024-5031Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). FoxO3a also contributes to the nerve growth factor (NGF) deprivation-induced apoptosis of developing sympathetic neurons by activating Bim (12Gilley J. Coffer P.J. Ham J. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 613-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). The anti-cancer drug paclitaxel also induces Bim-dependent apoptosis by activating FoxO3a in MCF-7 breast cancer cells (13Sunters A. Fernández de Mattos S. Stahl M. Brosens J.J. Zoumpoulidou G. Saunders C.A. Coffer P.J. Medema R.H. Coombes R.C. Lam E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49795-49805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Moreover, FoxO3a increases expression of TRAIL (tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand), which is a proapoptotic member of the TNF family, and induces apoptosis downstream of the PTEN tumor suppressor in prostate cancer (14Modur V. Nagarajan R. Evers B.M. Milbrandt J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47928-47937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Thus, FoxO3a has generally been considered an inducer of apoptosis. However, expression of the constitutively active FoxO3a protects pheochromocytoma PC12 and the colon carcinoma DLD-1 cells from apoptosis induced by oxidative stress (15Nemoto S. Finkel T. Science. 2002; 295: 2450-2452Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar, 16Kops G.J. Dansen T.B. Polderman P.E. Saarloos I. Wirtz K.W. Coffer P.J. Huang T.T. Bos J.L. Medema R.H. Burgering B.M.

Med. 2005; 11: 666-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The biological consequences of FoxO3a depend on cell type and stimuli surrounding cells. The transcriptional activity of FoxO3a is modulated through interaction with its cofactors. Here, we address the mechanism through which RUNX3 exerts its tumor suppressor activity by inducing apoptosis in gastric cancer cells. RUNX3 is shown to physically interact with FoxO3a expressed in gastric cancer cell lines to activate Bim and induce apoptosis. The same interaction is also demonstrated in mouse embryonic fibroblasts, suggesting that Runx3 is involved in Bim-dependent apoptosis, which is transcriptionally regulated by FoxO3a in a variety of cell types.

For competition experiments, whole-cell lysates were preincubated with a 200-fold molar excess of unlabeled complementary oligonucleotide probes. Western Blot Analysis and Immunoprecipitation—After lysing cells on ice, whole-cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA). The membranes were sequentially probed with an appropriate primary antibody and a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK), and immunocomplexes were detected using ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). For immunoprecipitation, whole-cell lysates were incubated overnight with anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel Freezer-Safe (Sigma), and the immune complexes were analyzed by Western blot analysis.

To assess the proapoptotic role of RUNX3 in TGF-β-induced apoptosis, we generated an AGS-derived transfectant clone (AGS/RUNX3) that expressed FLAG-tagged RUNX3 in an ecdysone-inducible manner. AGS and AGS/RUNX3 cells were stimulated with an ecdysone analog, ponasterone A, in the presence or absence of TGF-β for 48 h and then analyzed for the expression of FLAG-RUNX3 and the induction of apoptosis. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR analyses showed that treatment with ponasterone A induced RUNX3 mRNA in AGS/RUNX3 cells but not AGS cells (Fig. 1A). The mRNA level of RUNX3 induced in AGS/RUNX3 cells was similar to that in the SNU16 human gastric cancer cell line that expresses endogenous RUNX3 (3Li Q.L. Ito K. Sakakura C. Fukamachi H. Inoue K.

Western blot analysis confirmed ponasterone A-induced expression of FLAG-RUNX3 in AGS/RUNX3 cells but not AGS cells (Fig. 1B). TGF-β did not affect the level of RUNX3 expression. The level of apoptosis was analyzed using annexin V staining. In the absence of TGF-β, the percentage of early apoptotic cells that were positively stained with annexin V but not with propidium iodide was increased from 3.67 to 27.7% following FLAG-RUNX3 expression in AGS/RUNX3 cells but was not increased in AGS cells (Fig. 1C). Cell death detection ELISA assays also showed that apoptosis was induced by ponasterone A but not by TGF-β in AGS/RUNX3 cells (Fig. 1D). The TGF-β stimulation did not increase the percentage of the apoptotic cells. It is important to note that in AGS/RUNX3 cells the induction of apoptosis was dependent on ponasterone A but not on TGF-β.FIGURE 1Restored RUNX3 induces apoptosis in the AGS gastric cancer cell line. A-D, AGS, AGS/RUNX3, SNU16, and MKN45 cells were unstimulated or stimulated with ponasterone A and/or TGF-β.

Luciferase assays were performed in the presence or absence of ponasterone A and/or TGF-β. The transcriptional activity of (CAGA)12MLP-Luc was not detected in the absence of TGF-β and was greatly increased in the presence of TGF-β (Fig. 1E). The ponasterone A stimulation did not increase the TGF-β-induced transcriptional activity of (CAGA)12MLP-Luc. These results indicated that Smads did not play a critical role in RUNX3-induced apoptosis in AGS/RUNX3 cells.

The detection of light echoes could allow us to pinpoint the supernova event both in position and age and, most importantly, permit the acquisition of spectra to determine the 'type' of the supernova centuries after the direct light from the explosion first reached Earth. Although echoes have been discovered around some nearby extragalactic supernovae, targeted searches have not found any echoes in the regions of historical Galactic supernovae. Here we report three faint variable-surface-brightness complexes with high apparent proper motions pointing back to three of the six smallest (and probably youngest) previously catalogued supernova remnants in the Large Magellanic Cloud, which are believed to have been thermonuclear (type Ia) supernovae. Using the distance and apparent proper motions of these echo arcs, we estimate ages of 610 and 410 years for two of them."

Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 1227-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar). The interaction of VWF with its platelet receptor glycoprotein (GP) Ibα in the GPIb-IX-V complex mediates platelet adhesion to extracellular matrices exposed at sites of vascular injury. This interaction is essential for thrombus formation at sites of high shear stress, as in microarterioles or in stenosed arteries. Mature VWF comprises a series of multimers that are composed of homodimers interlinked through disulfide bridges. The mature VWF subunit consists of four distinct types of internal homology present in two to three copies in the following order from the N terminus: D′-D3-A1-A2-A3-D4-B1-B2-B3-C1-C2-CK. Native VWF in solution has an extremely low affinity for GPIbα, suggesting the existence of specific regulatory mechanisms that maintain ligand and receptor in the same environment without adverse consequences. The affinity of VWF toward its primary receptor can be increased by artificial means, such as removal of sialic acid side chains (2Vermylen J. Donati M.B. De Gaetano G. Verstraete M.

Blood. 1989; 74: 1031-1035Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In pathophysiological conditions, however, binding is induced by immobilization of VWF or by elevated fluid shear stress, which is likely due to changes in interdomain interactions (5Siedlecki C.A.

Therefore, it is not unlikely to suppose that the remainder of VWF, outside the A1 domain, serves as a masking environment, preventing binding to GPIb-IX-V. Conformational changes in VWF upon immobilization or upon exposure to shear might relieve this possible shielding effect of neighboring domains in VWF and might thereby reveal the functional binding site in the A1 domain. This mode of action is supported by kinetic and crystal studies, which demonstrated a higher binding affinity of the isolated A1 domain for GPIb-IX-V compared with full-length VWF (9Miura S. Li C.Q.

As mentioned before, it is suggested that neighboring domains in VWF might impede the accessibility of the GPIbα binding region. We have previously described a monoclonal antibody (moAb), 1C1E7, directed against the aa 764–1035 region in the N-terminal D′D3 domains of VWF (15Tornai I. Arnout J. Deckmyn H. Peerlinck K. Vermylen J. J. Clin. Investig. 1993; 91: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Although this moAb interacts with a region distinct from the VWF A1 domain, it induces von Willebrand disease-type 2B-like alterations (16Ulrichts H. Harsfalvi J. Bene L. Matko J. Vermylen J. Ajzenberg N. Baruch D. Deckmyn H. Tornai I. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2004; 2: 1622-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). This would suggest that the binding region of 1C1E7 in VWF might have a modulatory role for the VWF/GPIbα interaction and could be a shielding region for the GPIbα binding domain. The objectives of this study were to obtain evidence for the functionality of the D′D3 region in VWF for GPIbα binding using deletion mutants, constructed VWF chimeras, and recombinant 1C1E7 as tools. Materials—Different moAbs against VWF were described previously. moAb 82D6A3 binds to the VWF A3 domain and inhibits VWF binding to collagen types I, III, and IV (17Vanhoorelbeke K. Depraetere H.

Girma (INSERM U143, le Kremlin-Bicêtre, Paris, France). moAbs 724 and 701 recognize the VWF A1 domain (18Depraetere H. Ajzenberg N. Girma J.P. Lacombe C. Meyer D. Deckmyn H. Baruch D. Blood. 1998; 91: 3792-3799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Obert B. Houllier A. Meyer D. Girma J.P. Blood. 1999; 93: 1959-1968Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas moAb 418 interacts with the first 106 aa in mature VWF (20Pietu G. Ribba A.S. Meulien P. Meyer D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 163: 618-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). VWF was purchased from the Red Cross (Brussels, Belgium). moAbs or VWF were biotinylated using EZ-link Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin (Perbio, Helsingberg, Sweden). Pooled plasma was prepared from the plasma of 25 healthy volunteers (21Vanhoorelbeke K. Cauwenberghs N. Vauterin S. Schlammadinger A. Mazurier C. Deckmyn H. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2000; 83: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The vector pSV2-dhfr (22Subramani S. Mulligan R. Berg P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1981; 1: 854-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) was obtained from American Type Cell Culture (Manassas, VA). Restriction endonucleases were from MBI Fermentas (Vilnius, Lithuania). Numbering of the aa sequence of VWF or the nucleotide sequence of the VWF gene starts with, respectively, the initiator methionine or the start codon as the +1 position. Recombinant VWF/D′A3 (aa 1–1874), VWF/D′D3 (aa 1–1247), and VWF/A1-CK (1260–2813) were expressed and purified as described before (23Lenting P.J. Westein E. Terraube V. Ribba A.S. Huizinga E.G.

For clarity, we renamed VWF/D′A3 and VWF/A1-CK as plusD′D3 and ΔD′D3, respectively. A representation of VWF, its fragments, and the binding sites of the moAbs is shown in Fig. 1. Construction and Expression of 1C1E7 Single-chain Variable Fragment—Total cell RNA was extracted from 1C1E7-expressing hybridoma cells using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Venlo, The Netherlands) and was reverse-transcribed in the ThermoScript reverse transcription-PCR system (Invitrogen) using oligo(dT)20 primers. The N-terminal sequence of the heavy and light chain of 1C1E7 was determined by TopLab (Martinsried, Germany). Based on these data, degenerate sense primers were designed for the heavy and the light chain variable regions (VH and VL, respectively), and framework-specific antisense primers were used in the subsequent PCR reactions (24Staelens S. Desmet J. Ngo T.H. Vauterin S. Pareyn I. Barbeaux P. Van R.I. Stassen J.M. Deckmyn H. Vanhoorelbeke K. Mol. Immunol. 2005; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, 25Sblattero D. Bradbury A. Immunotechnology. 1998; 3: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Amplification of VH was performed using Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and the resulting PCR product was ligated in the pCR®-Blunt vector (Invitrogen). VL was amplified with Platinum® Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen), and the resulting PCR product was ligated in the pCR®2.1-TOPO® vector (Invitrogen). For the construction of the 1C1E7 single-chain variable fragment (scFv), both VH and VL were extended such that the following splice overlapping extension PCR resulted in a VH-(G4S)3-VL scFv coding sequence. This PCR product was ligated in the pSecTag/FRT/V5-His vector (Invitrogen). The 1C1E7 scFv was expressed in Escherichia coli as a His-tag fusion protein. Briefly, NcoI and XhoI restriction sites were added to the 3′ and 5′ ends, respectively, by PCR using sequence-specific primers. The 1C1E7 scFv DNA was cloned in the pET26+ vector (Stratagene) using the NcoI and XhoI restriction sites. BL-21 E. coli were transformed with the construct and were induced for 2 h with 0.5 m isopropyl-β-d-galactoside. The bacteria were harvested (10,000 × g for 10 min), and cell proteins from the pellet were extracted with the BugBuster protein extraction reagent (Novagen, Merck). 1C1E7 scFv was expressed as inclusion bodies. To refold the scFv, inclusion bodies were dissolved in IB buffer (6 m guanidine-HCl, 1.5 m urea, 0.6 mm reduced glutathione, 0.3 mm oxidized glutathione in phosphate-buffered saline, PBS) (26Lilie H. Schwarz E. Rudolph R. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1998; 9: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). The solubilized proteins were subsequently dialyzed against a series of urea solutions (8, 6, 4, and 2 m overnight (ON) at 4 °C) and, finally against PBS. Ristocetin- and Botrocetin-induced Binding of VWF, ΔD′D3, plusD′D3, or Recombinant VWF to a Recombinant GPIbα Fragment (aa 1–289)—The ristocetin- and botrocetin-induced binding of VWF, ΔD′D3, plusD′D3, or recombinant VWF (see later) to a GPIbα fragment was performed as previously described (21Vanhoorelbeke K. Cauwenberghs N. Vauterin S. Schlammadinger A. Mazurier C. Deckmyn H. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2000; 83: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Briefly, microtiter plates were coated ON at 4 °C with anti-GPIbα moAb 2D4 (5 μg/ml in PBS) and blocked with Tris-buffered Saline (TBS) containing 3% milk powder. A recombinant N-terminal, VWF binding GPIbα fragment (aa 1–289) (rGPIbα) was expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells and purified as described (27Ulrichts H. Vanhoorelbeke K. Cauwenberghs S. Vauterin S. Kroll H. Santoso S. Deckmyn H. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 1302-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Wells were incubated for 1.5 h at 37 °C with rGPIbα (1 μg/ml in TBS, 0.1% Tween 20) and incubated for 1.5 h at 37 °C with a dilution series of ristocetin (abp, New York, NY) or botrocetin purified from crude Bothrops jararaca venom (Sigma) (28Fujimura Y.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1957-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) in the presence of a constant amount of purified VWF, ΔD′D3, plusD′D3, or recombinant VWF (0.5 μg/ml) and in the absence or presence of 12 μg/ml 1C1E7 IgG. Bound VWF, ΔD′D3, plusD′D3, or recombinant VWF was detected for 45 min at room temperature (RT) with a 1/3000 dilution of anti-VWF polyclonal antibodies labeled with horseradish peroxidase (anti-VWF-Ig-horseradish peroxidase, Dako, Glostrup, Denmark). Visualization was obtained with H2O2 and ortho-phenylenediamine (Sigma), and the coloring reaction was stopped with 4 m H2SO4, after which the absorbance was determined at 490 nm. Platelet Agglutination—Agglutination studies were performed in an Elvi-840 dual channel aggregometer (Pabish, Brussels, Belgium) with constant stirring at 1000 rpm at 37 °C. For the agglutination experiments using 1C1E7 scFv, blood was drawn from healthy volunteers on trisodium citrate, pH 7.5 (0.11 m, 10:1 v/v), and centrifuged at 180 × g for 10 min to obtain platelet-rich plasma. Platelet-rich plasma was incubated for 3 min with buffer and with 1C1E7 scFv or IgG, after which agglutination was induced by the addition of ristocetin. For the agglutination experiments using the VWF fragments, blood was collected on acid citrate dextrose (0.085 m trisodium citrate, 0.065 m citric acid, 0.110 m glucose, pH 4.5) (10:1.5 v/v). Platelets were washed twice and resuspended in PBS containing 1 mg/ml glucose and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. A final platelet concentration of 200,000 platelets/μl was used. ΔD′D3, plusD′D3, or VWF/D′D3 were added to a final concentration of 10 μg/ml, and the mixture was incubated for 3 min, after which agglutination was induced by the addition of ristocetin. Construction of Expression Plasmid for Chimeric Porcine/Human Recombinant VWF—An expression plasmid for a chimeric porcine/human recombinant VWF in which the aa 786–960 region of the human sequence was exchanged by the corresponding porcine sequence was constructed. This recombinant VWF construct is further referred to as VWF(aa786–960)PIG. Briefly, the expression vector pNUT-VWF cas (29van der Plas R.M. Gomes L. Marquart J.A. Vink T. Meijers J.C. de Groot P.G. Sixma J.J. Huizinga E.G. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2000; 84: 1005-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) was digested with the restriction endonuclease BglII, and the resulting 4.7-kilobase fragment was ligated subsequently in the unique BglII site of the vector pSV2-dhfr to give the vector pSV2-pNUT. RNA was isolated from a porcine umbilical cord using the mRNA isolation kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and cDNA was prepared with the Thermoscript™ reverse transcription-PCR system (Invitrogen) using the sequence specific primer RP3 (5′-CGC AGG TTC CTC TCC TCG CAG TTC-3′, nucleotides 3384–3408). cDNA was amplified by PCR using the sense primer P5 (5′-CGC AGC AAG AGG AGT CTG AGC TGC CGG CCC CCC ATG-3′, nucleotides 2279–2314) and the antisense primer RP3. The PCR product was ligated in the vector PCR4 Blunt-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). A unique EagI restriction site at position 2875 was introduced by PCR using the sense primer P5 and the point-mutated antisense primer P6.2 (5′-GAT GAA CCG GCC GGA TTC CAC3′, nucleotide 2867–2887). The PCR product was cloned in the pBAD-TOPO TA vector (Invitrogen) to give the vector pBAD-PIG. Subsequently, the XhoI-EagI fragment of the vector pBAD-PIG was ligated in XhoI-EagI-digested pSV2-pNUT to give the vector pSV2-pNUT-PIG. The vector pSV2-pNUT-PIG was digested with EcoRI and BglII. The resulting 4.7-kilobase fragment was exchanged by the corresponding sequence of pNUT-VWF cas to give the final expression vector pNUT-VWF PIG. Construction of Expression Plasmids for VWF Point or Double Mutants—Expression plasmids for human VWF or for VWF(aa786–960)PIG containing K968S, K991Q or S1009G,N1011S mutations were constructed starting from the plasmid pSV2-pNUT or pSV2-pNUT-PIG, respectively. Using the QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and specific primers, the desired mutations were introduced. The resulting vectors were digested with EcoRI and BglII, and the resulting 4.7-kilobase fragment was exchanged by the corresponding sequence of pNUT-VWF cas or pNUT-VWF PIG as described above to obtain expression plasmids for full-length VWF. Expression of Recombinant VWF—VWF was transiently expressed in COS-7 cells (30Sixma J.J. Schiphorst M.E. Verweij C.L. Pannekoek H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 196: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) or stably expressed in baby hamster kidney cells overexpressing furin (BHK-fur) as described before (6Lankhof H. Wu Y.P. Vink T. Schiphorst M.E. Zerwes H.G. de Groot P.G. Sixma J.J. Blood. 1995; 86: 1035-1042Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The VWF:Ag level was determined in a sandwich immunoassay as previously described (21Vanhoorelbeke K. Cauwenberghs N. Vauterin S. Schlammadinger A. Mazurier C. Deckmyn H. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2000; 83: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Binding of VWF to moAb 1C1E7—96-Well microtiter plates (Greiner, Frickenhausen, Germany) were coated ON at 4 °C with moAb 1C1E7 (10 μg/ml in PBS), blocked for 2 h at RT with TBS containing 3% milk powder, and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with a dilution series of VWF expression medium in TBS containing 0.3% milk powder. Bound VWF was detected as described above. Binding of VWF to Human Collagen Type III—96-Well microtiter plates were coated ON at 4 °C with 25 μg/ml human collagen type III (Sigma) in PBS. Wells were blocked with PBS containing 3% milk powder and incubated with a dilution series of purified recombinant VWF in PBS containing 0.3% milk powder. Bound VWF was detected as described above (24Staelens S. Desmet J. Ngo T.H. Vauterin S. Pareyn I. Barbeaux P. Van R.I. Stassen J.M. Deckmyn H. Vanhoorelbeke K. Mol. Immunol. 2005; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Multimeric Analysis—The multimeric pattern of VWF was determined essentially as described (31Ruggeri Z.M. Zimmerman T.S. Blood. 1981; 57: 1140-1143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.08 μg of VWF was separated on SDS 0.65% Seakem HGT, agarose gel (Cambrex, Bio Science Rockland, Inc., ME). Gels were fixed on Gelbond (Cambrex), and VWF was immunodetected using anti-VWF-Ig labeled with alkaline phosphatase (32Goudemand J. Mazurier C. Parquet-Gernez A. Goudemand M. Pathol. Biol. (Paris). 1977; 25: 241-243PubMed Google Scholar) and further revelation with the AP conjugate substrate kit (Bio-Rad). Cross-blocking Analysis for Antibody Binding to Immobilized VWF— 96-Well microtiter plates were coated ON at 4 °C with VWF (10 μg/ml in PBS) and blocked for 2 h at RT with TBS containing 3% milk powder. Wells were incubated for 1 h at 37°C with biotinylated moAb 418 (b-418) at its half-maximal binding concentration (0.15 μg/ml) in the presence of the competing moAbs 701, 724, 418, or 82D6A3 (15 μg/ml) using TBS containing 0.3% milk powder as buffer. Residual bound b-418 was detected for 45 min at RT with peroxidase-labeled streptavidin (1/10000 in TBS containing 0.3% milk powder). Visualization was performed as described above. Cross-blocking Analysis for Antibody Binding to “Soluble” VWF—96-Well microtiter plates were coated with moAb 418 (2 μg/ml in PBS) and blocked for 2 h at RT with TBS containing 3% milk powder. Biotinylated VWF (b-VWF, 6 μg/ml) was preincubated with one of the anti-VWF moAbs (0.5–60 μg/ml) for 1 h at 37°C after which this solution was transferred to the coated wells. After a further incubation of 30 min at 37 °C, residual bound b-VWF was detected with peroxidase-labeled streptavidin as described above. Statistics—In this study means and S.E. are shown. Statistical significance of differences between means was evaluated using Student’s t test. Functionality of VWF Lacking the D′D3 Region—It has been suggested that the remainder of VWF outside the A1 domain might shield the GPIbα binding region. However, the exact mechanism of this shielding has not been elucidated yet. The anti-VWF moAb 1C1E7 interacts with the aa 764–1035 region in the N-terminal D′D3 domains and modulates the binding of VWF to GPIbα. This would suggest a functional role of the D′D3 region in the binding of the A1 domain to its receptor. Therefore, we decided to study this putative modulatory role using VWF constructs lacking the D′D3 region. Recombinant ΔD′D3 (aa 1260–1874) is a dimer composed of two VWF monomers lacking the D′D3 region but still contains the N-terminal flanking region of the VWF A1 domain. We verified the ristocetin- and botrocetin-induced binding of this construct to a recombinant GPIbα fragment and compared its affinity to that of recombinant plusD′D3 (aa 1–1874). This construct is a dimer as well but lacks the C-terminal D4-B1-B2-B3-C1-C2-CK regions. In the presence of ristocetin as a modulator, ΔD′D3 interacted stronger with rGPIbα compared with plusD′D3 (Fig. 2A). Similar results were obtained with botrocetin (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that the D′D3 region has an inhibitory effect on the interaction of the A1 domain with GPIbα. The addition of 1C1E7 to plusD′D3 increased ristocetin-induced binding to rGPIbα to the level of ΔD′D3 while not affecting the GPIbα interaction of ΔD′D3 (Fig. 2A). This suggests that the observed effects are likely not due to a different affinity of the deletion mutants for the modulators used in the assay. We further identified the inhibitory role exhibited by the D′D3 region in VWF/GPIbα interaction in platelet agglutination experiments. Dimeric constructs were used because previous studies demonstrated the necessity of the use of at least dimeric molecules for sustaining platelet aggregation (33Sugimoto M. Ricca G. Hrinda M.E. Schreiber A.B. Searfoss G.H. Bottini E. Ruggeri Z.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5202-5209Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The threshold dose needed for ristocetin-induced agglutination of washed platelets was lower for ΔD′D3 than for plusD′D3 (Fig. 3A), also demonstrating the inhibitory effect of the D′D3 region on the interaction of VWF with GPIbα. In line with this, VWF/D′D3 inhibited the ristocetin-induced agglutination supported by ΔD′D3 while having no effect on the agglutination supported by plusD′D3 (Fig. 3B). These results show that the lack of inhibition by deletion of the D′D3 region in ΔD′D3 could be reverted by external addition of these isolated D′D3 domains. These experiments demonstrate the functionality of the D′D3 region in the interaction of VWF with GPIbα, strongly suggesting that this region shields the GPIbα binding site in VWF, restricting its accessibility and preventing spontaneous VWF binding to platelets. Epitope Mapping of moAb 1C1E7—To discover residues in the D′D3 region that would be responsible for its inhibitory effect, we identified the binding region of 1C1E7 in VWF. Previous studies demonstrated that 1C1E7 interacted with a tryptic fragment comprising the aa 764–1035 sequence in VWF, which is located in the D′D3 region (15Tornai I. Arnout J. Deckmyn H. Peerlinck K. Vermylen J. J. Clin. Investig. 1993; 91: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The location of the epitope was further corroborated by the fact that 1C1E7 failed to interact with ΔD′D3 but recognized the isolated D′D3 region (data not shown). Because 1C1E7 does interact with VWF in Western blot, this moAb probably recognizes a linear epitope. Therefore, the cross-reactivity of 1C1E7 with VWF of different species was verified to determine if differences in the primary structure of VWF have an effect on the binding of 1C1E7. 1C1E7 failed to recognize porcine plasma VWF but was still able to interact with canine VWF (data not shown). This suggests that some of the 35 residues in the aa 764–1035 region of human VWF that are not shared with the porcine VWF sequence might maintain the epitope of 1C1E7. To identify these residues, a chimeric recombinant VWF (VWF(aa786–960)PIG) in which the aa 786–960 region of the human sequence was exchanged by the corresponding porcine sequence was constructed. For cloning reasons, only this part of the N-terminal aa 764–1035 region in human VWF was exchanged. This construct, containing 23 residues differing from the human sequence, was transiently expressed in COS-7 cells, and the interaction with 1C1E7 was determined. 1C1E7 still interacted with VWF(aa786–960)PIG (Fig. 4A), suggesting that the aa 961–1035 region in VWF probably maintains the epitope of this moAb. Further comparison of the primary sequence of human VWF in this region with sequences of porcine, canine, and murine VWF highlighted residues Lys-968, Lys-991, Ser-1009, and Asn-1011 as possible candidates for maintaining the epitope of 1C1E7 (Fig. 4B). These residues are different between human and both porcine and murine VWF but are similar between the human and canine protein. VWF mutants in which these residues were exchanged for the porcine analogues were constructed and transiently expressed in COS-7 cells. 1C1E7 bound as strongly with the K991Q and S1009G, N1011S mutant as to WT VWF, suggesting that these residues are not important for maintaining the epitope. However, binding was completely abolished for the K968S point mutant, identifying this residue as critical for the interaction of 1C1E7 (Fig. 4A). Functionality of Chimeric Recombinant VWF—In a next step the ristocetin-induced binding of the recombinant full-length WT VWF and chimeric constructs to GPIbα was measured to verify if altering the structure in the D′D3 region might influence this interaction. Recombinant WT VWF, VWF(aa786–960)PIG, and VWF(aa786–960)PIG, in which a K968S point mutation was inserted (VWF(aa786–960)PIG-K968S), were expressed in BHK-fur (baby hamster kidney cells overexpressing furin) cells. The multimeric pattern of both mutants was similar to WT VWF with at least 16 detectable multimer bands (Fig. 5A). Binding characteristics of the mutants to anti-VWF moAbs 418, 82D6A3, 701, and 724 was similar to WT VWF (data not shown), suggesting a similar overall structural fold. Next, the functional effects of the exchange of several residues in the D′D3 region was verified. The interaction with fibr"

https://openalex.org/W2044001092,"The mechanisms of cell death and the progressive degeneration of neural tissue following traumatic brain injury (TBI) have come under intense investigation. However, the complex interactions among the evolving pathologies in multiple cell types obscure the causal relationships between the initial effects of the mechanical trauma at the cellular level and the long-term dysfunction and neuronal death. We used an in vitro model of neuronal injury to study the mechanisms of cell death in response to a well-defined mechanical insult and found that the majority of dead cells were apoptotic. We have previously reported that promotion of membrane repair acutely with the non-ionic surfactant poloxamer 188 (P188) restored cell viability to control values at 24 h postinjury. Here, we showed that P188 significantly inhibits apoptosis and prevents necrosis. We also examined the role of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) in cell death. There was a rapid, transient activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and p38s after mechanical insult. Of these, activation of the proapoptotic p38 was the greatest. Treatment with P188 inhibited p38 activation; however, direct inhibition of p38 by SB203580, which selectively inhibits the activity of the p38 MAPK, provided only partial inhibition of apoptosis and had no effect on necrosis. These data suggest that multiple signaling pathways may be involved in the long-term response of neurons to mechanical injury. Furthermore, that the membrane resealing action of P188 provides such significant protection from both necrosis and apoptosis suggests that acute membrane damage due to trauma is a critical precipitating event that is upstream of the many signaling cascades contributing to the subsequent pathology."
https://openalex.org/W1991703596,"During myelination of the peripheral nervous system, the myelin protein zero (Mpz) gene is induced to produce the most abundant protein component (P(0)) of mature myelin. Although the basal embryonic expression of Mpz in Schwann cells has been attributed to regulation by Sox10, the molecular mechanism for the profound up-regulation of this gene during myelination has not been established. In this study, we have identified a highly conserved element within the first intron of the Mpz gene, which contains binding sites for the early growth response 2 (Egr2/Krox20) transcription factor, a critical regulator of peripheral nerve myelination. Egr2 can transactivate the intron element, and the induction is blocked by two known repressors of Egr2 activity. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we find that Egr2 binds in vivo to the intron element, but not to the Mpz promoter. Known inducers of Mpz expression such as forskolin and insulin-like growth factor-1 also activate the element in an Egr2-dependent manner. In addition, we found that Egr2 can act synergistically with Sox10 to activate this intron element, suggesting a model in which cooperative interactions between Egr2 and Sox10 mediate a large increase in Mpz expression to the high levels found in myelinating Schwann cells."

https://openalex.org/W2018117935,"Sprouty family proteins are novel regulators of growth factor actions. Human Sprouty 2 (hSPRY2) inhibits the proliferation of a number of different cell types. However, the mechanisms involved in the anti-proliferative actions of hSPRY2 remain to be elucidated. Here we have demonstrated that hSPRY2 increases the amount of the tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) and decreases its phosphorylation. The resultant increase in PTEN activity is reflected in decreased activation of Akt by epidermal growth factor and serum. Consistent with increased PTEN activity, in hSPRY2-expressing cells, the progression of cells from the G1 to S phase is decreased. By using PTEN null primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts and their isogenic controls as well as small interfering RNA against PTEN, we demonstrated that PTEN is necessary for hSPRY2 to inhibit Akt activation by epidermal growth factor as well as cell proliferation. Overall, we concluded that hSPRY2 mediates its anti-proliferative actions by altering PTEN content and activity. Sprouty family proteins are novel regulators of growth factor actions. Human Sprouty 2 (hSPRY2) inhibits the proliferation of a number of different cell types. However, the mechanisms involved in the anti-proliferative actions of hSPRY2 remain to be elucidated. Here we have demonstrated that hSPRY2 increases the amount of the tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) and decreases its phosphorylation.

Over the past few years, the Sprouty (SPRY) 2The abbreviations used are: SPRY2, Sprouty 2; h, human; PMEF, primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts; EGF, epidermal growth factor; siRNA, small interfering RNA; d, Drosophila; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; HA, hemagglutinin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; PIP3, 3,4,5-trisphosphate. 2The abbreviations used are: SPRY2, Sprouty 2; h, human; PMEF, primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts; EGF, epidermal growth factor; siRNA, small interfering RNA; d, Drosophila; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; HA, hemagglutinin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; PIP3, 3,4,5-trisphosphate. family of proteins has emerged as an important modulator of growth factor actions. The ability of the Sprouty proteins to regulate the biological activity of growth factors has been conserved through evolution. Drosophila SPRY (dSPRY) was the first member of the family to be identified and has been shown to regulate tracheal branching in response to fibroblast growth factor (1Hacohen N. Kramer S. Sutherland D. Hiromi Y. Krasnow M.A. Cell. 1998; 92: 253-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). Later studies demonstrated that dSPRY also inhibited the actions of EGF (2Reich A. Sapir A. Shilo B. Development (Camb.). 1999; 126: 4139-4147PubMed Google Scholar). Like dSPRY, mammalian SPRY isoforms (SPRY1–4) have also been shown to modulate growth factor-mediated actions. For instance, mouse SPRY2 expression resulted in increased lung branching morphogenesis (3Tefft J.D. Lee M. Smith S. Leinwand M. Zhao J. Bringas Jr., P. Crowe D.L. Warburton D. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 219-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that SPRY proteins have conserved function to modulate respiratory morphogenesis. The ability of mouse SPRY4 to inhibit angiogenesis (4de Maximy A.A. Nakatake Y. Moncada S. Itoh N. Thiery J.P. Bellusci S. Mech. Dev. 1999; 81: 213-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) and cause pulmonary hypoplasia as well as the ability of SPRY2 and SPRY1 to decrease uteretic branching and kidney development (5Lee S.H.

Impagnatiello M.A. Christofori G. Whitsett J.A. Dev. Biol. 2003; 258: 154-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) also demonstrates that the SPRY proteins play a profound role in regulating tubular morphogenesis. Notably, however, SPRY proteins do not exclusively regulate tubular morphogenesis, but by opposing the actions of growth factors they may also play a role in the development of other organs, such as the brain and limbs (7Furthauer M. Reifers F. Brand M. Thisse B. Thisse C. Development (Camb.). 2001; 128: 2175-2186PubMed Google Scholar, 8Minowada G. Jarvis L.A. Chi C.L. Neubuser A. Sun X. Hacohen N. Krasnow M.A. Martin G.R.

At the cellular level, we and others have shown that overexpression of SPRY1 (10Impagnatiello M.A. Weitzer S. Gannon G. Compagni A. Cotten M. Christofori G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1087-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), SPRY2 (11Yigzaw Y. Cartin L. Pierre S. Scholich K. Patel T.B. J. Biol.

Treatment of cells with EGF results in translocation of the human SPRY2 (hSPRY2) protein from the vicinity of microtubules to membrane ruffles (11Yigzaw Y. Cartin L. Pierre S. Scholich K. Patel T.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22742-22747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 13Lim J. Wong E.S. Ong S.H. Yusoff P. Low B.C. Guy G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32837-32845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The abrogation of co-localization of hSPRY2 with microtubules or deletion of the region that is necessary for translocation to membrane ruffles obliterates the ability of the protein to inhibit cell migration and proliferation (11Yigzaw Y. Cartin L. Pierre S. Scholich K. Patel T.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22742-22747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that hSPRY2, in part, mediates its anti-migratory actions by increasing the amount of soluble protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) (14Yigzaw Y. Poppleton H.M. Sreejayan N. Hassid A. Patel T.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 284-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Moreover, we have shown that hSPRY2 decreases growth factor-mediated activation of Rac1 and that constitutively active Rac1 protects against the anti-migratory, but not the anti-proliferative, actions of hSPRY2. Although some tenable mechanisms of hSPRY2-mediated inhibition of migration have been described, the mechanisms or signaling proteins that mediate the anti-proliferative actions of hSPRY2 in cells remain to be elucidated and form the subject of this study. Here we demonstrate that hSPRY2 expression in HeLa cells increases the amount of the tumor suppressor PTEN. The phosphorylation of PTEN in hSPRY2-expressing cells is also decreased. Consistent with an increase in PTEN amount and activity in hSPRY2-expressing cells, the activation of Akt by EGF or serum is decreased. The ability of hSPRY2 to decrease Akt activation is ablated in PTEN null primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (PMEFs). Moreover, the ability of hSPRY2 to inhibit cell proliferation was also obliterated in PTEN null, but not the isogenic control, PMEFs, and in HeLa cells where PTEN levels were knocked down by using siRNA approaches. These findings demonstrate that PTEN plays a pivotal role in mediating the anti-proliferative actions of hSPRY2. Cells and Culture Conditions—Control and HA-hSPRY2-expressing stable HeLa cell lines were used as reported previously (11Yigzaw Y. Cartin L. Pierre S. Scholich K. Patel T.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22742-22747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and maintained in 800 μg/ml G418. TAT-HA-tagged hSPRY2 and GFP were purified and used as described previously (11Yigzaw Y. Cartin L. Pierre S. Scholich K. Patel T.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22742-22747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The PMEFs were derived from 14-day-old embryos of PtenloxP/loxP-mice. Following removal of the head and organs, embryos were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), minced, and digested with trypsin (0.05% trypsin containing 0.53 mm EDTA) for 20 min at 37 °C. Trypsin was inactivated by addition of PMEF medium (DMEM (4.5 g/liter glucose)) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 0.1 mm minimum Eagle’s medium nonessential amino acids, 0.1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin. Cells from single embryos were plated onto one 100-mm diameter culture dish and incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator. The PtenloxP/loxP PMEFs (passage 1) were infected with retrovirus to express either GFP or Cre recombinase-GFP fusion protein, and PTEN expression in these cells was monitored by Western analyses to confirm the Pten+/+ and Pten–/– phenotypes. Purified TAT-HA-hSpry2 or TAT-HA-GFP proteins (10 μg/ml, each) were then transduced into these cells before they were used again. PMEFs were used within passage 4. Western Analyses—Cell lysates were prepared in the Laemmli sample buffer (15Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207018) Google Scholar), and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane for 1 h at 100 V in the cold. Membranes were blocked either in TBS containing 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk with 0.1% Tween 20 or in PBS containing 3% (w/v) nonfat dry milk. The following primary antibodies were used: anti-HA (HA.11 monoclonal antibody, Covance Research Products, Berkeley, CA); anti-PTEN (MMAC1 Ab-5 polyclonal antibody, Labvision, Fremont, CA). The anti-phospho-PTEN (Ser-380/Thr-382/Thr-383 polyclonal antibody), anti-Akt (polyclonal antibody), and anti-phospho-Akt (Thr-380 polyclonal; Ser-473, 4E2 monoclonal) antibodies were from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Anti-phospho-Ser-370 and Ser-385 PTEN antibodies were from BIOSOURCE and AnaSpec Inc. (San Jose, CA), respectively. Monoclonal anti-actin antibody was from MP Biomedicals (Aurora, OH). Anti-Erk1/2 antibody was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Semi-quantitative and Quantitative Real Time PCR—Total RNA was isolated from semi-confluent control and hSPRY2-expressing HeLa cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Quality and integrity of the RNA were checked by the A260/280 ratio and on formaldehyde/agarose gel, respectively. Equal amounts of RNA were reverse-transcribed using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. For semi-quantitative PCR, equal amounts of reverse-transcribed RNA were used with the following PTEN primers: forward primer, 5′-ACC AGG ACC AGA GGA AAC CT-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-GCT AGC CTC TGG ATT TGA CG-3′. Three sets of PTEN primers were designed using the primer design software Primer3 (16Rozen S. Skaletsky H. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 132: 365-386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and were analyzed for sequence homology for related proteins. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) primers were used as endogenous control. Real time PCRs were performed on an Icycler iQ real time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad), and the data were analyzed using the provided Icycler software. The reaction mixture consisted of 5 μl of cDNA template, 25 μlof2× SyberGreen PCR master mixture (Roche Applied Science), 5 μlof4 μm forward primer, and 5 μlof4 μm reverse primer in a 50-μl reaction volume. The PCR protocol consisted of one 10-min denaturation cycle at 95 °C followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 15 s and annealing/extension at 60 °C for 1 min. Standard curves for both the PTEN and endogenous control GAPDH were used. The efficiency of PCR amplification was 100%, and the R2 value was between 0.991 and 0.994, whereas the slope was between –3.302 and –3.31 in the standard curves. All real time PCR data are expressed as fold change in PTEN mRNA levels in hSPRY2-expressing cells with respect to control cells after normalizing to the levels of GAPDH. Data represented are from three independent experiments done in triplicate. Stability of PTEN by Pulse-Chase Analyses—For pulse-chase analyses, semi-confluent control and hSPRY2-expressing HeLa cells were methionine-starved with methionine-free DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics for 1 h at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. Cells were radiolabeled with [35S]methionine (100 μCi/ml; EasyTag, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 4 h, and the newly synthesized radiolabeled proteins were subsequently chased with normal media containing 1 mm cycloheximide for the indicated times or were lysed immediately. The lysis buffer contained 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 1mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA and protease inhibitors. PTEN was immunoprecipitated from 300 μg of cell lysate with PTEN antibody (MMAC1 Ab-5 polyclonal antibody, Labvision, Fremont, CA) or rabbit IgG alone. Samples were resolved on SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography. The amount of radiolabeled PTEN at each time point was quantified by subtracting the background in each lane. Data are presented as the percent of PTEN at 0 h after cycloheximide addition. Cell Proliferation Assays—For proliferation studies Pten+/+ and Pten–/– PMEFs (30,000 cells/well) were grown in 24-well plates in triplicate for each condition. Cells were grown in MEF medium containing 10 μg/ml either TAT-HA-hSPRY2 or TAT-HA-GFP for 24 h. Media containing the TAT proteins were changed every 24 h. After 72 h of growth, cells were trypsinized and counted using a hemocytometer. PTEN Knockdown Using siRNA—HeLa cells were plated at 50% confluency in 35-mm dishes. PTEN was knocked down as described in the transitTKO (Mirus, MI) protocol. Briefly, in 200 μl of Opti-MEM, 6 μl of transitTKO reagent was mixed thoroughly and incubated for 12 min at room temperature. 2.4 μl of 10 μm PTEN siRNA or mutant PTEN siRNA were added to this and incubated at room temperature for a further 12 min before dropwise addition to the dishes containing 1 ml of media. Cells were incubated for 48 h before experimentation. The PTEN siRNA duplex sequence, 5′-GUU AGC AGA AAC AAA AGG AGA UAU CAA-3′ (sense)/5′-UUG AUA UCU CCU UUU GUU UCU GCU AAC-3′ (antisense), and the mutant siRNA duplex sequence, 5′-GUC AGC AGA ACA AAA GUA GTT-3′ (sense)/5′-CUA CUU UUG GUU CUG CUG ACT T-3′ (antisense), were custom-synthesized commercially. These sequences do not share homology with any known sequences in the data base. [3H]Thymidine Incorporation Assay—HeLa cells (50,000 cells/well) previously treated with Sham, siRNA, or mutant siRNA were plated in triplicate in a 24-well tissue culture plate. Cells were serum-starved overnight with DMEM containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin and antibiotics before treating with or without serum for 20 h. One μCi of [3H]thymidine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added to each well, and cells were incubated for 4 h at 37°C. At the end of this period, plates were placed on ice, and cells were washed three times each with ice-cold PBS, then with ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid, and finally with ethanol/ether (2:1). The cells were dissolved with 0.1% SDS in 0.1 n NaOH by incubating overnight at room temperature. Aliquots were counted for [3H], and protein concentration was determined by using the bicinchoninic acid method as described previously (14Yigzaw Y. Poppleton H.M. Sreejayan N. Hassid A. Patel T.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 284-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Cell Cycle Analyses—Control and hSPRY2-expressing cells (300,000 cells) were grown in 60-mm dishes. The cells were serum-starved for 24 h with DMEM containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin and antibiotics before the addition of EGF (50 nm) or vehicle. Twelve hours later, the cells were harvested, and single cell suspensions were prepared in PBS supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin. Cells were washed twice, resuspended at a concentration of 1–2 × 106 cells/ml, and fixed with 70% (v/v) ethanol for 1 h at –20 °C. They were then washed twice with PBS and then stained with propidium iodide solution (5 μg/ml) containing RNase A (100 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 20 min. Samples were analyzed on a flow cytometer. Previously, we have shown that the anti-migratory actions of hSPRY2 are mediated by an increase in the soluble, cytosolic PTP1B (14Yigzaw Y. Poppleton H.M. Sreejayan N. Hassid A. Patel T.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 284-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In hSPRY2-expressing HeLa cells, an increase in cytosolic PTP1B can also explain the decrease in tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins such as p130 Cas (14Yigzaw Y. Poppleton H.M. Sreejayan N. Hassid A. Patel T.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 284-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Therefore, we reasoned that an increase in activity of other phosphatases might also contribute to the negative modulation of growth factor actions by hSPRY2. In our search for phosphatases whose activity or amount may be elevated by hSPRY2, we observed that the amount of PTEN was elevated by at least 2-fold in HeLa cells overexpressing hSPRY2 (Fig. 1A). Likewise, hSPRY2 also increased the amount of PTEN in primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (PMEFs, Fig. 5C; discussed below). To determine the mechanisms that led to an increase in PTEN content, experiments were performed to determine whether the expression of hSPRY2 altered the turnover of the protein or increased PTEN transcript. As shown in Fig. 1B, by semi-quantitative RT-PCR, we determined that the amount of PTEN transcript is elevated in hSPRY2-expressing HeLa cells; by using real time PCR, we found that the PTEN mRNA content was increased by ∼5-fold. Measurements of PTEN stability (Fig. 1C) showed that, most surprisingly, the t½ of PTEN in hSPRY2-expressing cells was half (15 h) that of control cells. Thus, it would appear that despite a 2-fold increase in PTEN turnover in hSPRY2-expressing cells, the greater (5-fold) increase in PTEN transcript is responsible for the overall increase in PTEN content. The t½ of ectopically overexpressed PTEN has been reported to be ∼2–5 h (17Torres J. Pulido R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 993-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar, 18Valiente M. Andres-Pons A. Gomar B. Torres J. Gil A. Tapparel C. Antonarakis S.E. Pulido R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28936-28943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). However, the endogenous PTEN turns over with a significantly longer half-life (Fig. 1C), suggesting that the overexpressed protein is preferentially targeted to the degradation pathway in cells and does not really reflect the half-life of endogenous PTEN. PTEN has been shown to be phosphorylated on several residues in its C-terminal tail by casein kinase and other kinases (17Torres J. Pulido R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 993-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar, 19Vazquez F. Grossman S.R. Takahashi Y. Rokas M.V. Nakamura N. Sellers W.R. J. Biol.

The phosphorylation of PTEN by casein kinase 2 on Ser-370 and Ser-385 decreases its activity (21Miller S.J. Lou D.Y. Seldin D.C. Lane W.S. Neel B.G. FEBS Lett. 2002; 528: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Additionally, this post-translational modification interferes with the electrostatic membrane binding of PTEN and decreases its function (19Vazquez F. Grossman S.R. Takahashi Y. Rokas M.V. Nakamura N. Sellers W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48627-48630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 20Das S. Dixon J.E. Cho W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7491-7496Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the phosphorylation of PTEN on its C terminus also increases its stability (17Torres J. Pulido R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 993-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar, 19Vazquez F. Grossman S.R. Takahashi Y. Rokas M.V. Nakamura N. Sellers W.R. J. Biol.

A. 2003; 100: 7491-7496Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) and may also have other as yet unidentified effects on the enzyme. Because we observed an increased turnover of PTEN protein and because PTEN function can be altered by its phosphorylation, using antibodies that recognize the phospho-forms of PTEN, we monitored the phosphorylation status of PTEN in control and hSPRY2-overexpressing cells. Because signaling cascades activated by EGF may alter the phosphorylation of PTEN, we investigated whether this agonist altered the phosphorylation status of PTEN. Fig. 2A shows that the amount of phospho-Ser-380, -Thr-382, and -Thr-383 PTEN in hSPRY2-expressing cells was decreased to ∼50% that in control cells, and this phosphorylation status was not affected by EGF. According to the manufacturer (Cell Signaling, MA), this anti-phospho-PTEN Ser-380/Thr-382/Thr-383 antibody recognizes phospho-PTEN only when all three sites are phosphorylated. Total ERK1/2 shows equal loading of proteins. Because hSPRY2 decreased PTEN phosphorylation and increased PTEN content, we determined whether changes in phosphorylation status of PTEN altered the ability of the anti-PTEN antibody to recognize the protein. Essentially, we immunoblotted samples of cell lysates from control and hSPRY2-expressing cells before and after dephosphorylating the proteins with calf intestinal phosphatase. The data from these experiments (supplemental Fig. S1) demonstrated that the total PTEN content of hSPRY2-expressing cells was elevated even after PTEN was dephosphorylated; thus, the changes in PTEN content observed in Fig. 1A are not artifacts of changes in PTEN phosphorylation. By using antibodies against phospho-Ser-370 and phospho-Ser-385 PTEN, the two major casein kinase 2 phosphorylation sites (21Miller S.J. Lou D.Y. Seldin D.C. Lane W.S. Neel B.G. FEBS Lett. 2002; 528: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), we also observed that in hSPRY2-expressing cells the phosphorylation of PTEN on Ser-370 and Ser-385 was also decreased by 50% (Fig. 2, B and C). EGF did not alter the phosphorylation of PTEN on Ser-370 and Ser-385 in either control or hSPRY2-expressing cells (not shown). A decrease in the C-terminal phosphorylation of PTEN would be predicted to decrease PTEN stability (17Torres J. Pulido R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 993-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar, 19Vazquez F. Grossman S.R. Takahashi Y. Rokas M.V. Nakamura N. Sellers W.R. J. Biol.

A. 2003; 100: 7491-7496Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), consistent with the increased turnover of PTEN in the presence of hSPRY2. Phosphorylation may play a complex role in regulating PTEN activity, as decreased phosphorylation may also augment PTEN activity and function through enhanced association with membranes (19Vazquez F. Grossman S.R. Takahashi Y. Rokas M.V. Nakamura N. Sellers W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48627-48630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 20Das S. Dixon J.E. Cho W.

Presently, how hSPRY2 causes decrease in PTEN phosphorylation is unknown and remains the subject of future investigations.FIGURE 5hSPRY2 decreases Akt activation in Pten+/+ PMEFS but not in Pten–/– PMEFs. A, Pten–/– and Pten+/+ PMEFs were generated from PtenloxP/loxP PMEFs (passage 1) as described under “Materials and Methods.” The cells (250,000/35-mm plate) were serum-starved overnight in the presence of TAT-HA-GFP or TAT-HA-hSPRY2 and then treated with or without EGF (50 nm) for 5 min.

An increase in PTEN function would be expected to decrease PIP3 levels and thereby decrease the activation of downstream kinases such as AKT that depend upon increases in PIP3 levels for their activation (23Stambolic V.

Therefore, as a reporter of the functional significance of the increase in PTEN content and its decreased phosphorylation in hSPRY2-expressing cells, we monitored the ability of EGF to activate AKT. Although the amount of total AKT was not altered (Fig. 3A), the phosphorylation of AKT on Thr-308 (Fig. 3A) and Ser-473 (Fig. 3B) in response to EGF was markedly decreased in hSPRY2-expressing cells.

https://openalex.org/W2047569995,"Extracellular superoxide dismutase (SOD3), a secretory copper enzyme, plays an important role in atherosclerosis and hypertension by modulating the levels of extracellular superoxide anion (O2*-) in the vasculature. Little is known about the mechanisms by which SOD3 obtains its catalytic copper cofactor. Menkes ATPase (MNK) has been shown to transport cytosolic copper to the secretory pathway in nonvascular cells. We performed the present study to determine whether MNK is required for the activation of SOD3 in the vasculature. Here we show that MNK was highly expressed in the various vascular tissues and cells. Aortas and cultured fibroblasts from MNK mutant (MNK(mut)) mice showed a marked decrease in specific activity of SOD3, but not SOD1 (cytosolic form), which was partially restored by copper addition. Copper treatment in wild-type cells promoted the direct interaction and colocalization of SOD3 with MNK in the trans-Golgi network (TGN), suggesting that MNK transports copper to SOD3 in the TGN. Aortas of MNK(mut) mice revealed a decrease in activity of SOD3, but not SOD1, in association with a robust increase in O2*- levels. Finally, both MNK and SOD3 proteins were highly expressed in the intimal lesions of atherosclerotic vessels. In conclusion, vascular MNK plays an essential role in full activity of SOD3 through transporting copper to SOD3 in the TGN, thereby regulating O2*- levels in the vasculature. These studies provide a novel insight into vascular MNK as a critical modulator of ""superoxide"" stress, which may contribute to cardiovascular disease."

Bánhegyi G. Burchell A. NATO Science Series, Life and Behavioural Sciences. 363. IOS Press, Amsterdam2005Google Scholar). Because of the limited and selective permeability of the ER membrane and because of special intraluminal reactions, it differs from the cytosol in numerous parameters. One of the most characteristic differences is that luminal thiols (including protein thiols and glutathione) are present in a more oxidized state than the cytosolic ones. Although the ratio between reduced and oxidized glutathione is 100:1 in the cytosol, this value is around 1–2:1 in the ER lumen (2Hwang C. Sinskey A.J. Lodish H.F. Science. 1992; 257: 1496-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1604) Google Scholar). The redox potential calculated from these values is –0.24 and –0.18 V, respectively. Recent observations suggest an even larger difference between the redox potentials of the two compartments (3Bass R. Ruddock L.W. Klappa P. Freedman R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5257-5262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The typical redox potential of a given compartment is a major determinant of rate and direction of redox reactions. The oxidizing environment in the ER lumen is both a prerequisite and a consequence of the oxidative folding of secretory and membrane proteins (4Benham A.M. Cabibbo A. Fassio A. Bulleid N. Sitia R. Braakman I. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4493-4502Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Cabibbo A. Pagani M. Fabbri M. Rocchi M. Farmery M.R. Bulleid N.J. Sitia R. J. Biol.

By generalizing the observations related to the redox state of thiols found in the ER of cells engaged in protein secretion, it is now supposed that the redox conditions in the ER lumen are uniformly oxidizing. However, several intraluminal reactions have been described, which require reducing equivalents. Such reactions involve the isomerization of disulfide bonds (7Molteni S.N. Fassio A. Ciriolo M.R.

Chem. Biol. Interact. 2003; 143: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and the reactivation of steroids. One of the main sources of intraluminal reducing equivalents is hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (H6PDH), which generates NADPH at the expense of the oxidation of glucose 6-phosphate (10Clarke J.L. Mason P.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 415: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This phosphoester, produced in the cytosol, can reach the luminal compartment by the mediation of its specific transporter glucose 6-phosphate transporter (11van Schaftingen E. Gerin I. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 513-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). 11β-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11βHSD1) is an NADP(H)-dependent oxidoreductase of the ER lumen (12Ozols J. J. Biol.

Although the enzyme can catalyze both the reduction of cortisone and the oxidation of cortisol in vitro, it appears to act exclusively as a reductase in vivo (17Hewitt K.N. Walker E.A. Stewart P.M. Endocrinology. 2005; 146: 2539-2543Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). This circumstance suggests that pyridine nucleotides are predominantly present in the reduced form in the ER lumen, which implies a lack of electron transfer between (reduced) pyridine nucleotides and (oxidized) thiols. This would be in sharp contradiction with the situation present in the cytosol, where oxidized glutathione is reduced back at the expense of the reducing equivalents supplied by NADPH (18Kehrer J.P. Lund L.G. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1994; 17: 65-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Therefore, the aim of the present study was to directly prove the redox state of pyridine nucleotides and to explain the separate existence of the two redox systems in the ER lumen. Here we present evidence for the presence of a pyridine nucleotide pool in the ER lumen, which is indeed prevalently reduced and does not communicate with thiols/disulfides because of the absence of glutathione reductase. Preparation of Microsomal Vesicles and Subcellular Fractions from Rat Liver—Microsomes were prepared from livers of overnight fasted male Sprague-Dawley rats (180–230 g), using fractional centrifugation (19Bánhegyi G. Marcolongo P. Fulceri R. Hinds C. Burchell A. Benedetti A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13584-13590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The vesicles were washed and resuspended in MOPS-KCl buffer (100 mm KCl, 20 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2), then immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and kept in liquid nitrogen until use (within 6 months). The protein concentration in microsomal samples was determined using the method of Lowry et al. (20Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. The integrity of the microsomal membranes was assessed by using the mannose-6-phosphatase assay (21Burchell A. Hume R. Burchell B. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1988; 173: 183-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) and by measuring p-nitrophenol glucuronidation (22Fulceri R. Bánhegyi G. Gamberucci A. Giunti R. Mandl J. Benedetti A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 309: 43-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 23Csala M. Staines A.G. Bánhegyi G. Mandl J. Coughtrie M.W. Burchell B. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 68: 1353-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), which showed a latency greater than 95%. To evaluate the possibility that cytosolic pyridine nucleotides are entrapped within the microsomal vesicles during the transient disruption of the ER membrane, the whole fractionation procedure was also performed in the presence of radiolabeled NAD+. Therefore, 0.76 μCi of [14C]NAD+ (specific activity 55 Ci/mol) was added to 30 ml of the homogenization mixture containing 3 g of liver tissue, before or after the homogenization step. The radioactivity associated with the microsomal pellet (derived from 3 g of liver) was 2060 ± 100 and 2110 ± 150 (dpm ± S.D., n = 3) with the addition of [14C]NAD+ before and after the homogenization step, respectively. In both instances, the microsomal fraction contained about 0.12% of the radioactivity present in the homogenate, which corresponded to about 0.35 pmol/mg of microsomal protein of the added radiolabeled NAD+. This result excludes the possibility that cytosolic pyridine nucleotides would have been entrapped in the vesicles generated by the fragmentation of the ER network during the homogenization step. In some experiments, mitochondrial, cytosolic, and microsomal fractions were obtained by standard differential centrifugation from rat liver homogenate (24Szarka A. Stadler K. Jenei V. Margittai É. Csala M. Jakus J. Mandl J. Bánhegyi G. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2002; 34: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and were maintained in liquid N2 until used. The subcellular fractions were characterized by measuring marker enzyme activities (25Benedetti A. Fulceri R. Romani A. Comporti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3466-3473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The activity of cytochrome c oxidase, glucose-6-phosphatase, and 5′-nucleotidase in the microsomal fraction was 1.2 ± 0.3, 30.1 ± 5.0, and 6.0 ± 1.1, respectively (expressed as percent value of the corresponding activity measured in the whole homogenate; means ± S.D., n = 3). Rough and smooth microsomal vesicles were prepared and characterized as described previously in detail (25Benedetti A. Fulceri R. Romani A. Comporti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3466-3473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fluorimetric Detection of Reduced Pyridine Nucleotides—Reduced pyridine nucleotides were detected based on their characteristic fluorescent spectrum in microsomes. Fluorescence was monitored at a 350-nm excitation and a 460-nm emission wavelength by using a Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer (Varian). Transport Measurements by Light Scattering Technique—The permeability of the microsomal membranes toward various compounds was measured by the continuous detection of the osmotically induced changes in size and shape of microsomal vesicles (19Bánhegyi G. Marcolongo P. Fulceri R. Hinds C. Burchell A. Benedetti A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13584-13590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Briefly, microsomal vesicles (50 μg of protein/ml) were equilibrated for 2 h in a hypotonic medium (5 mm PIPES potassium salt, pH 7.0) at 22 °C. Light scattering of the microsomes was then monitored at 550 nm, using a Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer (Varian), equipped with a temperature-controlled cuvette holder (22 °C) and magnetic stirrer. Investigated compounds were added as a small volume (<5% of the total incubation volume) of a concentrated osmolyte solution (0.5 m in the case of NADP+, NADPH, and glucose 6-phosphate and 2 m in the case of sucrose). Upon the addition of osmolytes an increase in the light scattering signal can be observed, which is due to vesicle shrinking. In case of a nonpermeant compound, a sustained signal can be seen, although the influx of a permeant compound into the vesicles results in vesicular swelling and in the decrease of the signal. Transport Measurements by Rapid Sedimentation Method—Microsomes (10 mg of protein/ml) were incubated in the presence of 0.2 mm NADP+ in the MOPS-KCl buffer at 37 °C. At the indicated times 0.5-ml samples were withdrawn and mixed with 0.5 ml of ice-cold buffer containing 10% polyethylene glycol. Polyethylene glycol-aggregated microsomal vesicles were sedimented and washed twice by rapid (10 s) centrifugation, as reported previously in detail (32Bánhegyi G. Lusini L. Puskás F. Rossi R.

Washed microsomes were resuspended in the MOPS-KCl buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, and the NADP+ concentration of suspensions was determined enzymatically, on the basis of NADPH formation after the addition of 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6 milliunits/ml) and 6-phosphogluconate (20 mm). Measurement of Enzyme Activities—To measure the cortisone reductase activity of native microsomal vesicles, microsomes (1 mg of protein/ml) were incubated in the MOPS-KCl buffer containing 10 μm cortisone at 22 °C, and cortisol formation was detected by an enzyme-linked fluorescent assay (BioMérieux, Lyon, France), as reported previously (26Bánhegyi G. Benedetti A. Fulceri R. Senesi S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27017-27021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The activity of 11βHSD1 was also evaluated by fluorimetric detection of NADPH formation upon the addition of 10 μm cortisol and 1 mm NADP+ to microsomes that have been permeabilized with alamethicin (0.1 mg/mg protein) to allow the free access of the cofactor to the intraluminal enzyme (26Bánhegyi G. Benedetti A. Fulceri R. Senesi S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27017-27021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Glutathione reductase activity was measured according to Hino et al. (27Hino Y. Ishio S. Minakami S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 165: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 0.4 mm glutathione disulfide, 0.15 mm NADPH, 1 mm EDTA, and 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). Microsomal protein concentration was 0.4 mg/ml. The reaction was started with the addition of NADPH; its oxidation was followed in a Hitachi U-1500 spectrophotometer at 22 °C. Microsomes were permeabilized with 0.04 mg/ml alamethicin. Western Blot Analysis—Equal amounts of proteins (20Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of the subcellular fractions were resolved on 8 or 9% polyacrylamide gels and blotted on nitrocellulose (28Senesi S. Marcolongo P. Kardon T. Bucci G. Sukhodub A. Burchell A. Benedetti A. Fulceri R. Biochem. J. 2005; 389: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The loading of equal amounts of proteins was also verified by densitometry analysis of the protein bands (stained with Red Ponceau) on the blot membranes. Immunoblots were probed with the different antibodies and analyzed by enhanced chemiluminescence (28Senesi S. Marcolongo P. Kardon T. Bucci G. Sukhodub A. Burchell A. Benedetti A. Fulceri R. Biochem. J. 2005; 389: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Measurement of Microsomal Protein Thiols—Microsomes (1 mg of protein/ml) were incubated in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2) for 20 min at 37 °C, in the presence of the various compounds. At the end of the incubation, microsomal proteins were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid, washed three times by 70% acetone, and resuspended in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 8 m urea, and 2% SDS. Thiol content of the final protein solution was measured by the Ellman method (29Ellman G. Lysko H. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 93: 98-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Materials—Alamethicin, cortisol, cortisone, metyrapone, 6-phosphogluconate, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, glucose 6-phosphate and mannose 6-phosphate (potassium salts), glutathione, glutathione disulfide, UDP-glucuronic acid, NAD+, NADH, NADP+, NADPH, and MOPS were purchased from Sigma. [carbonyl-14C]Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ammonium salt was bought from Amersham Biosciences. The rabbit polyclonal antiserum against the N terminus of mouse 11βHSD1 was from Alpha Diagnostic International (San Antonio, TX). The rabbit polyclonal antiserum against the lactonase domain (residues 539–791) of human H6PDH was kindly provided by Dr. E. van Schaftingen (Laboratoire de Chimie Physiologique, ICP and UCL, Brussels B-1200, Belgium). The rabbit polyclonal antibody against the amino acid residues 415–429 of the human hepatic glucose 6-phosphate transporter protein was produced as described in detail earlier (28Senesi S. Marcolongo P. Kardon T. Bucci G. Sukhodub A. Burchell A. Benedetti A. Fulceri R. Biochem. J. 2005; 389: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The rabbit polyclonal antibody against glutathione reductase was purchased from Lab Frontier, Seoul, Korea (catalog number LF-PA0056). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit Ig-specific secondary antibody (sc-2004) was supplied by Amersham Biosciences. The enhanced chemiluminescence kit was from Amersham Biosciences, and the Western Lightning Chemiluminescent Reagent was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. All other reagents were of analytical grade. Rat Liver Microsomes Contain an Overwhelmingly Reduced Pyridine Nucleotide Pool—11βHSD1, an intraluminal enzyme of the hepatic ER, which uses pyridine nucleotides as cofactor, catalyzes the oxidoreduction of cortisol and cortisone. In vivo, the preferential direction of the reaction is the reduction of cortisone to cortisol (17Hewitt K.N. Walker E.A. Stewart P.M. Endocrinology. 2005; 146: 2539-2543Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), suggesting that the luminal pyridine nucleotides are at least partially in reduced form. In accordance with this assumption, addition of cortisone to native rat liver microsomes resulted in a rapid formation of cortisol, which reached a maximum within few minutes (Fig. 1). The permeabilization of microsomal vesicles by the pore-forming agent alamethicin almost completely abolished cortisone reduction (Fig. 1). A possible interpretation of these results is that some NADPH required for the reduction of cortisone by 11βHSD1 is present in the lumen of native microsomal vesicles. Upon permeabilization, the luminal NADPH is released into the incubation medium, and its concentration likely becomes too low for allowing the reduction of cortisone. Indeed, the intravesicular water space of liver microsomes is ∼3–4 μl per mg of protein (30Marcolongo P. Fulceri R. Giunti R. Burchell A. Benedetti A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 219: 916-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and 1 mg of microsomal protein was present in 1 ml of the incubation system in the experiments of Fig. 1. Moreover, the outer microsomal surface appeared to possess an NAD(P)H oxidase activity, which was likely responsible for the oxidation of NADPH released from the microsomal lumen to the incubation medium (see below). The results strongly suggested that rat liver microsomes maintained a luminal pyridine nucleotide pool during the separation procedures, i.e. the ER membrane is not permeable toward NAD(P)+ or NAD(P)H. Accordingly, a light scattering assay of the permeability of microsomal vesicles toward both NADP+ and NADPH (20 mm each, see Fig. 2, A and B) showed that a sustained elevation of the signal (i.e. a sustained osmotic shrinkage of vesicles) was observed upon their addition. This indicates that the microsomal membrane is hardly permeable for these compounds. As demonstrated in Fig. 2C, the shape of these traces was similar to that revealed upon the addition of sucrose, a prototypic nonpermeant compound (19Bánhegyi G. Marcolongo P. Fulceri R. Hinds C. Burchell A. Benedetti A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13584-13590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained with NAD(H) (data not shown). As a control, the addition of the permeant compound glucose 6-phosphate (19Bánhegyi G. Marcolongo P. Fulceri R. Hinds C. Burchell A. Benedetti A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13584-13590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) resulted in an increase in light scattering, which was followed by a recovery of the signal (i.e. by a swelling phase reflecting the permeation of the exose-phosphate; see Fig. 2D). In all the experiments (Fig. 2, A–D), the complete permeabilization of microsomal vesicles by alamethicin resulted in a maximal swelling. The microsomal permeability for lower physiological concentrations of pyridine nucleotides was investigated by using a rapid sedimentation method (26Bánhegyi G. Benedetti A. Fulceri R. Senesi S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27017-27021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In the presence of 200 μm NADP+, no uptake of the nucleotide was detectable at incubation times shorter than 15 min. At longer incubation times, a time-dependent uptake was observed (Fig. 2E). However, this uptake was not accounted for by the complete equilibration of the extravesicular and intravesicular NADP+ concentrations, even after 1 h of incubation. At that time, the calculated intravesicular NADP+ concentration was only one-third of the extravesicular one, assuming that the intravesicular microsomal water space is 3.6 μl/mg protein, as measured previously in similar microsomal preparations (19Bánhegyi G. Marcolongo P. Fulceri R. Hinds C. Burchell A. Benedetti A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13584-13590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To investigate the redox state of intraluminal pyridine nucleotides, microsomes were incubated in a fluorimeter cuvette, and reduced pyridine nucleotides were detected on the basis of their characteristic fluorescence (350-nm excitation and 460-nm emission wavelengths). Without any additions, a sustained signal was observed (see Fig. 3A and Fig. 4A), indicating that in the absence of exogenous substrates, but in the presence of oxygen, microsomal oxidoreductions did not affect the redox state of luminal pyridine nucleotides. This signal was reduced by the permeabilization of the microsomal membrane as well as by the addition of substrates that are expected to oxidize NADPH. These observations indicate that a measurable contribution to the fluorescence signal is accounted for by intraluminal reduced pyridine nucleotides.FIGURE 4Cortisone and its analogue metyrapone oxidize an intraluminal NAD(P)H pool. Microsomes (2 mg/ml protein) were incubated in a fluorimeter cuvette, and the reduced pyridine nucleotide content was monitored as reported under “Materials and Methods.” The effect of various concentrations of cortisone (A) or of 5 μm metyrapone (C) is shown. B shows microsomal spectra before (a) and after (b) the addition of 1 μm cortisone; the times of registrations are indicated on A by arrowheads.

The fluorescence spectra before and after addition of alamethicin are shown in Fig. 3B, and the difference between them (Fig. 3B, inset) corresponds to the fluorescence spectrum of reduced pyridine nucleotides. The loss in the signal caused by permeabilization of the microsomal membrane should reflect their contribution to the fluorescence spectrum of native microsomes. Indeed, once the intraluminal NAD(P)H is released, it should be rapidly oxidized by NAD(P)H oxidases present on the microsomal outer surface, as demonstrated by the fact that both NADH and NADPH exogenously added to intact microsomes are oxidized (Fig. 3C). By taking into account the increase in the fluorescence upon the addition of known amounts of NADPH (Fig. 3C), the decrease upon alamethicin permeabilization (Fig. 3A), and a microsomal luminal water space of 3.6 μl/mg protein, an ∼0.4 mm intravesicular NAD(P)H concentration can be calculated. The addition of cortisone, a substrate that is reduced by the intraluminal 11βHSD1, also resulted in a concentration-dependent decrease of the signal (Fig. 4A). The difference between the fluorescence spectra of microsomes before and after the addition of cortisone also corresponded to the spectrum of NADPH (Fig. 4B). Metyrapone, another substrate of 11βHSD1 (9Bannenberg G. Martin H.J. Bélai I. Maser E. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2003; 143: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), produced an effect similar to that of cortisone (Fig. 4C). The maximal decrease in the fluorescence caused by cortisone addition was 1.17 ± 0.11 (n = 5) (arbitrary units measured at 2 mg of microsomal protein per ml, means ± S.E.), and in the case of alamethicin permeabilization the decrease was 1.28 ± 0.18 (n = 4). These data indicate that the dominant intraluminal reduced pyridine nucleotide is NADPH, because 11βHSD1 activity is specific for NADP(H). In additional experiments, we observed that reducing agents caused only a moderate increase in the signal. Glucose 6-phosphate, which can reduce NADP+ by the action of the intraluminal H6PDH, caused a slight increase in the signal (Fig. 5A). However, glucose 6-phosphate could revert the effect of cortisone, and this activity was abolished by the specific inhibitor, S3483 (31Herling A.W. Burger H.J. Schwab D. Hemmerle H. Below P. Schubert G. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: G1087-G1093PubMed Google Scholar), of the ER transporter of the phosphoester (Fig. 5B). Addition of cortisol also resulted in a minor increase of the fluorescence signal (Fig. 5C). However, the addition of a high concentration of cortisol (10 μm) could revert the effect of 1 μm cortisone (Fig. 5D). Glutathione Does Not Affect the Redox State of Intraluminal Pyridine Nucleotides—To investigate the cross-talk between thiol/disulfide and NAD(P)H/NAD(P)+ redox systems, additional experiments were performed. We have shown previously that the most abundant cytosolic reducing agent GSH can enter liver microsomal vesicles, although GSSG is poorly permeant (32Bánhegyi G. Lusini L. Puskás F. Rossi R. Fulceri R. Braun L. Mile V. di Simplicio P. Mandl J. Benedetti A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12213-12216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). We also showed that GSH, once entered the microsomal lumen, is oxidized to GSSG likely at the expenses of protein disulfides (32Bánhegyi G. Lusini L. Puskás F. Rossi R. Fulceri R. Braun L. Mile V. di Simplicio P. Mandl J. Benedetti A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12213-12216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Despite its ability of crossing microsomal membranes, GSH did not alter the redox state of intraluminal pyridine nucleotides (Fig. 6). Moreover, GSH did not affect the ability of cortisone to oxidize intraluminal NADPH, as well the ability of glucose 6-phosphate to revert the oxidizing effect of cortisone (Fig. 6, compare traces a and b). The oxidizing effect of cortisone was concentration-dependent either in the presence or the absence of GSH (compare A and B). As expected, because of its poor permeability, GSSG was also ineffective (data not shown). Pyridine Nucleotides Do Not Influence the Intraluminal Redox State of Protein Thiols—The effect of pyridine nucleotides on the redox state of microsomal protein thiols/disulfides was evaluated in order to explore further a possible connection between the two redox systems.

Thus, these mutations circumvent the normal reciprocal epithelial-mesenchymal signaling restrictions (10Wang Y. Xiao R. Yang F. Karim B.O. Iacovelli A.J. Cai J. Lerner C.P. Richtsmeier J.T.

For example, FGF7 promotes mutant FGFR2 (S252W) signaling, but the binding affinity between FGF7 and mutant FGFR2c is negligible (8Yu K. Herr A.B. Waksman G. Ornitz D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The severity of the phenotype varies in Apert patients, although they carry the same FGFR2 (S252W) mutation. Furthermore, only certain tissues and organs are affected during development and in the adult. This may be due to ligand availability and to the modification of activity by specific GAG sequences.GAG sequences are not directly encoded by genes but are assembled in the Golgi by enzymes encoded by over 40 genes. Because of the vast expression repertoire of the GAG assembly enzymes, GAGs may have a sulfation pattern, chain length, and fine structure unique to each cell (25Esko J.D. Lindahl U. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). Cell surface GAGs turn over within one-eighth to one-third of a cell cycle (26Yanagishita M. Hascall V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9451-9454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This means their quantity and fine structures are able to rapidly change in response to a variety of environmental factors.Heparin and heparin oligosaccharides have been used in most studies of the effect of GAGs on FGF/FGFR signaling. Heparin, the most heavily sulfated HS, is made by mast cells and is usually stored in mast cell granules. The only obvious defect in heparin-deficient mice involves connective tissue-type mast cells (27Forsberg E. Pejler G. Ringvall M. Lunderius C. Tomasini-Johansson B. Kusche-Gullberg M. Eriksson I.

Chem. 2002; 277: 42815-42820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). CS-E, a highly sulfated CS, interacts with chemokines and growth factors (31Sugahara K. Mikami T. Uyama T. Mizuguchi S. Nomura K. Kitagawa H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2003; 13: 612-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). CS-E inhibits the herpes simplex virus infection better than heparin in a cell-based model system (32Bergefall K. Trybala E. Johansson M. Uyama T. Naito S. Yamada S. Kitagawa H. Sugahara K. Bergstrom T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32193-32199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar).Because of the essential role of GAGs in regulating FGF activity, we hypothesized that not only HS, but also the abundant CS-A, could differentially modulate the activity of wild-type and mutant FGFR2 (S252W). Because GAG regulates FGF/FGFR signaling in the extracellular environment, inhibitory GAGs that down-regulate FGF/FGFR signaling could be potentially useful drugs for treating Apert syndrome, especially the unique dermatological disorders (hyperhidrosis, hypopigmentation, and severe widespread acne) found in these patients. Based on the above observations, we predict that different GAGs can either activate or inhibit specific FGF/FGFR signaling. Here we test this in a cell-based model of Apert syndrome. We show that FGFs and GAGs are equally important partners in FGFR signaling in general and in Apert FGFR2 signaling in particular. Our results suggest that in the presence of multiple FGFs and FGFRs, cell- and tissue-specific GAGs select special FGF/FGFR pairs and regulate the degree of signaling.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGAGs—Heparin (H4784), heparan sulfate from bovine kidney (H9637), CS-A from bovine trachea (C8529), and CS-B from porcine intestinal mucosa (C3788) were purchased from Sigma. The major repeating disaccharide (90%) in CS-A is GlcUA-GalNAc4S.3 CS-B is also called dermatan sulfate. CS-B is enriched in IdoA-GalNAc4S repeating disaccharides. Squid cartilage CS-E was purchased from Calbiochem (catalog number 230690). About 60% of the repeating disaccharides in CS-E are GlcUA-GalNAc4S6S.3 The order of charge densities is heparin → CS-E → CS-B → CS-A → HS.FGF/FGFR-mediated Proliferation Assay—Wild-type and mutant FGFR activity was assayed in BaF3 cells. BaF3 cells are a lymphoid cell line that are dependent on the cytokine IL-3 for growth and have no intrinsic response to FGF. When stably transfected to express FGFRs, BaF3 cells will survive in IL-3-free medium only if FGF and heparin are both present. BaF3 cells die if only FGF or GAG is included in IL-3-free cell culture medium. Because BaF3 cells express no endogenous FGF, the background activity in the absence of added FGF is very low regardless of whether the cells express an FGFR. BaF3 cells make low levels of GAGs (∼74 ng/106 cells, ∼20% HS (∼14 ng/106 cells), and ∼80% CS (∼60 ng/106 cells)). 4K. Giljum, D. R. Studelska, and L. Zhang, unpublished results. In contrast, most mammalian cells make 50–500 ng/106 HS (33Shworak N.W. Methods Mol. Biol. 2001; 171: 79-89PubMed Google Scholar). Fetal bovine serum used in the cell culture also contains an appreciable amount of HS and CS. However, GAGs from either source have very low mitogenic activity. Therefore, BaF3 cells are a reliable system for detecting FGF- and GAG-dependent FGFR activities (34Ornitz D.M. Leder P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16305-16311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The BaF3 cells ectopically expressing wild-type or FGFR2b (S252W) or -2c (S252W) have been previously described (8Yu K. Herr A.B. Waksman G. Ornitz D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14536-14541Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The BaF3-FGFR cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Fisher) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 ng/ml IL-3 (PeproTech Inc., Rocky Hill, NJ), 2 mm l-glutamine, penicillin (50 IU/ml), streptomycin (50 μg/ml), 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol, and 400 μg/ml active G418.For mitogenic assays, BaF3 FGFR cells were washed three times with RPMI 1640 medium to remove IL-3 and were resuspended in assay medium without IL-3 with 5% fetal bovine serum. 30,000 live cells were plated per well in a 96-well plate in media containing GAGs, FGFs (PeproTech), or both in a total volume of 200 μl. The cells were then incubated at 37 °C for 40 h. Four to five hours before harvesting, an additional 50 μl of assay medium containing 1 μCi of [3H]thymidine (Amersham Biosciences) was added to each well. Cells were harvested by filtration through glass fiber paper (PerkinElmer). The incorporation of [3H]thymidine into DNA was determined by scintillation counting.GAG Quantification—GAGs were quantified by a reversed-phase HPLC separation of fluorescent isoindole derivatives of the glucosamine (GlcN) and galactosamine (GalN) released by acid hydrolysis (35Studelska D.R. Giljum K. McDowell L.M. Zhang L. Glycobiology. 2006; 16: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We found that 1 μg/ml of heparin equals 800 nm GlcN residue. Assuming the commercial heparin has an average molecular mass of 16,000 Da and the repeating disaccharide has a molecular mass of 600 Da, the average chain length should be 16,000/600 = 27 disaccharides, which is equivalent to 27 GlcN residues. Thus, 1 μg/ml of heparin equals 800 nm/27 = 30 nm heparin. Because our chemically and enzymatically synthesized HSs were originally derived from the same heparin, 27 GlcN/chain were used to calculate the HS molar concentration. However, the average chain lengths of HS from bovine kidney, CS-A, -B, and -E are unknown. Their concentrations were either expressed as μg/ml in Figs. 1 and 2 or μm GlcN or GalN in Fig. 4. One μg/ml HS equals 871 nm GlcN, 1 μg/ml CS-A is equivalent to 892 nm GalN, 1 μg/ml CS-B = 716 nm GalN, and 1 μg/ml CS-E = 333 nm GalN.FIGURE 2Ability of FGFR2c (S252W)-expressing BaF3 cells to be activated by inappropriate FGF ligands and GAGs.

Heparin, HS, CS-A, -B, and -E at 0, 0.1, 0.5, 2.5, 12.5, and 62.5 μm GlcN or GalN equivalent final concentrations were dispensed into 96-well plates. The same GAG solutions were used for all of the FGFs tested. FGFR2b (S252W)-expressing BaF3 cells (30,000 live cells/well) and FGF1, FGF2, FGF4, FGF7, FGF9, or FGF10 were then added to each of six plates at a final concentration of 2 nm. The cell proliferation was determined by [3H]thymidine incorporation into the DNA following 40 h in culture (see “Materials and Methods”). Data are mean ± range of duplicates.

Herr A.B. Waksman G. Ornitz D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14536-14541Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Wild-type or mutant FGFR2b-expressing BaF3 cells (Fig. 1) were treated with 2 nm FGF2, -7, or -9, and varying concentrations of GAGs (heparin, HS, CS-A, CS-B, or CS-E from 0 to 2 μg/ml). In the absence of GAGs, FGF2, -7, and -9 were unable to activate either wild-type or mutant FGFR2b (see the zero concentration point in each plot, Fig. 1). Consistent with previous studies, wild-type FGFR2b was only activated by FGF7 (8Yu K. Herr A.B. Waksman G. Ornitz D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14536-14541Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Relative to wild-type FGFR2b, FGFR2b (S252W) was more susceptible to activation induced by 0.125 μg/ml of heparin and FGF7 (90% of the maximum response for the mutant versus 75% for wild-type, Fig. 1, B and E), consistent with increased affinity of FGF7 and mutant FGFR2b (S252W) (8Yu K. Herr A.B. Waksman G. Ornitz D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14536-14541Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). CS-B (2 μg/ml) and FGF7 (Fig. 1B) also showed a detectable mitogenic activity on wild-type FGFR2b, which is consistent with previous reports (22Taylor K.R. Rudisill J.A. Gallo R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5300-5306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 23Trowbridge J.M. Rudisill J.A. Ron D. Gallo R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42815-42820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). However, FGFR2b (S252W) preferentially responded to distinct GAGs in the presence of the three FGFs (Fig. 1, D–F). Cell proliferation was stimulated by FGF9 plus heparin, FGF2 plus heparin or CS-B, and FGF7 plus heparin, CS-B, or HS.Although the same FGFR2b-expressing BaF3 cells were used in the experiments shown in Fig. 1 (top, wild-type; bottom, mutant), the background [3H]thymidine incorporation in the absence of added GAGs depended on the FGF ligand. FGF2 generated a higher background compared with that of FGF7 and FGF9.Similar experiments with BaF3 cell lines expressing FGFR2c showed changes in GAG specificity in the presence of the wild-type receptor (Fig. 2, top) and the S252W mutant receptor (Fig. 2, bottom). Wild-type FGFR2c/FGF2 (Fig. 2A) was most efficiently activated by heparin and CS-B, whereas FGFR2c (S252W)/FGF2 was activated by all five GAGs tested (Fig. 2D). In contrast, mutant (Fig. 2E), but not wild-type (Fig. 2B), FGFR2c/FGF7 was activated by heparin. Wild-type FGFR2c/FGF9 (Fig. 2C) was maximally activated by heparin and showed a modest response to CS-B (2 μg/ml). In contrast FGFR2c (S252W)/FGF9 (Fig. 2F) was activated by heparin, CS-B, and HS from bovine kidney. CS-E (2 μg/ml) also showed a detectable mitogenic effect on the mutant-expressing cell line (Fig. 2F). FGFR2c (S252W) required lower doses of GAGs for activation or was less selective with respect to GAGs than wild-type FGFR2c.The same mutant FGFR2c-expressing BaF3 cells were used in the experiments shown in Fig. 2, D–F. However, the background [3H]thymidine incorporation in the absence of added GAGs was high (FGF2, 32,000 cpm; FGF9, 22,000 cpm; and FGF7, 10,000 cpm). These results suggest that the proliferation was stimulated by intrinsic BaF3 and/or fetal bovine serum GAGs or resulted from FGF-dependent, but GAG-independent, activity. When BaF3 cells treated with both chondroitinase ABC and heparin lyases were assayed in AIM-V medium (which does not contain fetal bovine serum), the background was reduced by ∼50% (data not shown). We suspect that other sugar structures, such as undigested GAG linkage oligosaccharides on proteoglycan core proteins, GM1 ganglioside (37Rusnati M. Urbinati C. Tanghetti E. Dell'Era P. Lortat-Jacob H. Presta M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4367-4372Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), or other N-linked or O-linked sulfated sugars also contribute to the background mitogenic activity.Both Heparin and FGFs Are Necessary to Activate FGFR2b (S252W)-expressing BaF3 Cells—The data in Figs. 1 and 2 show that FGFR2b (S252W) and FGFR2c (S252W) were activated by a wider spectrum of GAGs than wild-type FGFR2. This parallels previous discoveries that the S252W mutation uncouples ligand binding specificity of both splice forms of the S252W receptor (8Yu K. Herr A.B. Waksman G. Ornitz D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14536-14541Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of FGFs versus GAGs in FGFR2 (S252W) activation, we compared the FGF and heparin dose response by either fixing the heparin concentration and varying the FGF concentration or vice versa (Fig. 3). FGFR2b (S252W)-expressing cells were not activated by FGF or heparin alone (see the zero concentration point in each plot). Both FGF and heparin exhibited dose-dependent activities. These results indicate that both FGFs and GAGs are required to activate FGFR2 (S252W).FIGURE 3Both heparin and FGFs are necessary to activate FGFR2b (S252W)-expressing BaF3 cells. FGFR2b (S252W)-expressing BaF3 cells were seeded in 96-well plates. In one experiment (black bars), the concentration of heparin was held constant at 15 nm, and the concentration of FGF was varied (0, 0.016, 0.08, 0.4, 2, and 10 nm). In another experiment (white bars), the concentration of FGF was held constant at 2 nm, and the concentration of heparin was varied (0, 3.75, 7.5, 15, 30, and 60 nm). The cell proliferation was determined by [3H]thymidine incorporation into the DNA following 40 h in culture (see “Materials and Methods”). Data are mean ± range of duplicates.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Unique FGF and GAG Combinations Are Required for the Mitogenic Activity of Mutant FGFR2b (S252W)—Maximum FGFR signaling in the presence of 2 nm FGFs was induced by 0.5 μg/ml heparin (Figs. 1 and 2). The highest GAG concentration used was 2 μg/ml. However, the physiological concentrations of GAGs are generally higher than those used in Figs. 1 and 2 and in most in vitro studies. For example, GAG concentrations in wound fluid ranged from 15 to 65 μg/ml (29Penc S.F. Pomahac B. Winkler T. Dorschner R.A. Eriksson E. Herndon M. Gallo R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28116-28121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). CS concentrations in growth plates varied from 10 to 14 mg/ml.3 The BaF3 proliferation assay was therefore used to examine the effect of more physiologically relevant GAG concentrations on FGF activity. GlcN or GalN equivalent concentrations of GAGs were 0, 0.1, 0.5, 2.5, 12.5, and 62.5 μm. The highest heparin concentration was increased from 2 μg/m1 (Figs. 1 and 2) to 78 μg/ml.Heparin activated every FGF (1, 2, 4, 7, 9, or 10) at low concentrations in FGFR2b (S252W)-expressing BaF3 cells (Fig. 4), but the dose-response curve differed from that of other GAGs (HS, CS-A, -B, and -E). FGF1, the universal FGF that activates all of the FGFRs, was activated by all the GAGs tested (at least at the highest concentrations). In contrast, FGF2 was not activated by HS. In fact, [3H]thymidine incorporation decreased with increased HS concentrations. Furthermore, HS at high concentrations inhibited heparin (0.5 μm)-induced [3H]thymidine incorporation of FGFR2b (S252W)-expressing BaF3 cells (data not shown). FGF4 and FGF10 were activated by heparin, CS-A, and CS-B. CS-B activated FGF10 better than CS-A, but CS-A activated FGF4 better than CS-B. CS-A reached the level of heparin activity for FGF4 at a GalN equivalent concentration of 500 μm (data not shown). In contrast, maximum CS-B activity for FGF4 was ∼50% that of heparin at a concentration of 100 μm (data not shown). In the presence of FGF7 or FGF9, FGFR2b (S252W)-expressing BaF3 cells were activated by heparin, HS, CS-A, and CS-B. CS-A and CS-B, at the highest concentration, were as effective as heparin in promoting FGF7-induced proliferation of FGFR2b (S252W)-expressing BaF3 cells. However, with FGF9, CS-A and CS-B were only 60% as effective as heparin at the highest concentrations.Inhibition of FGFR2b (S252W) by Modified HS—The mitogenic activation and inhibition of 6-O-desulfated heparin and the inhibition of 2-O-sulfate-enriched heparin oligosaccharides toward specific FGF/FGFR signaling have been reported (19Guimond S.

https://openalex.org/W2056461696,"Mutations in SHP-2 phosphatase that cause hyperactivation of its catalytic activity have been identified in human leukemias, particularly juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, which is characterized by hypersensitivity of myeloid progenitor cells to granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor and interleukin (IL)-3. However, the molecular mechanisms by which gain-of-function (GOF) mutations of SHP-2 induce hematopoietic malignancies are not fully understood. Our previous studies have shown that SHP-2 plays an essential role in IL-3 signal transduction in both catalytic-dependent and -independent manners and that overexpression (5–6-fold) of wild type (WT) SHP-2 attenuates IL-3-mediated hematopoietic cell function through accelerated dephosphorylation of STAT5. These results raised the possibility that SHP-2-associated leukemias are not solely attributed to the increased catalytic activity of GOF mutant SHP-2. GOF mutant SHP-2 must have gained additional capacities. To test this possibility, we investigated effects of a GOF mutation of SHP-2 (SHP-2 E76K) on hematopoietic cell function and IL-3 signal transduction by comparing with those of overexpressed WT SHP-2. Our results showed that SHP-2 E76K mutation caused myeloproliferative disease in mice, while overexpression of WT SHP-2 decreased hematopoietic potential of the transduced cells in recipient animals. The E76K mutation in the N-terminal Src homology 2 domain increased interactions of mutant SHP-2 with Grb2, Gab2, and p85, leading to hyperactivation of IL-3-induced Erk and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways. In addition, despite the substantial increase in the catalytic activity, dephosphorylation of STAT5 by SHP-2 E76K was dampened. Furthermore, catalytically inactive SHP-2 E76K with an additional C459S mutation retained the capability to increase the interaction with Gab2 and to enhance the activation of the PI3K pathway. Taken together, these studies suggest that in addition to the elevated catalytic activity, fundamental changes in physical and functional interactions between GOF mutant SHP-2 and signaling partners also play an important role in SHP-2-related leukemigenesis.

Hematopoietic cell fate is tightly controlled by environmental cues, such as growth factors, cytokines, and extracellular matrix, which exert their functions by activation of intracellular signaling mechanisms. Therefore, intracellular signaling processes play an important role in the determination of hematopoietic cell function. Dysregulation of signal transduction in hematopoietic cells by mutations in cell surface receptors or intracellular signaling components results in malfunction of hematopoietic cells, leading to blood disorders including leukemias.

Activating mutations in the Ras gene or homozygous inactivation of the neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) gene, whose product, neurofibromin 1, is a Ras-GTPase-activating protein (Ras-GAP), have been identified in ∼50% of JMML (3Cichowski K. Santiago S. Jardim M. Johnson B.W. Jacks T. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 449-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Due to activating Ras mutations or inactivation of NF1 mutations, hematopoietic progenitor cells in JMML are hypersensitive to granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interleukin (IL)-3 (4Birnbaum R.A.

GM-CSF, IL-3, and IL-5 are a small family of hematopoietic growth factors that induce intracellular signal transduction mainly through the common receptor β chains (6Okuda K. Foster R. Griffin J.D.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2532-2547Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). They regulate hematopoietic cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation via shared intracellular signaling pathways. Although GM-CSF-, IL-3-, and IL-5-triggered signal transduction has been extensively investigated, the precise regulation of their signaling mechanisms is still not well understood. IL-3 exerts its function through binding to two distinct high affinity receptors composed of a ligand-specific α subunit and one of two β subunits: a ligand-specific β chain (Aic2A) or a common β chain (Aic2B). Upon binding by ligands, IL-3 receptors heterodimerize and become quickly tyrosyl phosphorylated. Activated receptors, in particular, the common receptor β chains, then trigger a signal relay to the targets in the nucleus to induce cellular responses through shared Jak-STAT, Ras-Raf-MAP, PI3K, and Src kinase pathways (6Okuda K. Foster R. Griffin J.D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 872: 305-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 7Reddy E.P. Korapati A. Chaturvedi P. Rane S. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2532-2547Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Upon receptor engagement by IL-3, non-receptor tyrosine kinases such as Jak2 and Src family members are activated. Activated Jak2 and/or Src family kinases in turn phosphorylate the receptor β chains on multiple tyrosine residues, which thereafter serve as docking sites for other Src homology (SH) 2 or phosphotyrosine binding domain-containing signaling molecules, such as the Shc adaptor protein or SHP-2 phosphatase, to couple downstream signaling pathways (8Pratt J.C.

However, detailed signaling mechanisms downstream of the common receptor β chain and exact components involved in the signaling processes are still not fully characterized.

Overexpression (5–6-fold increase) of wild type (WT) SHP-2 enhances growth factor deprivation-induced apoptosis and compromises hematopoietic cell function in vitro, and this is achieved by direct dephosphorylation of STAT5 (20Chen J.

Recently, genetic lesions in SHP-2 that cause hyperactivation of its catalytic activity have emerged as major genetic events underlying the developmental disorder Noonan syndrome and JMML.

SHP-2 mutations and other JMML-associated Ras or NF1 mutations are mutually exclusive in leukemic patients. Moreover, a single SHP-2 GOF mutation (D61G) does induce myeloproliferative disease and Noonan syndrome in mice (25Araki T. Mohi M.G. Ismat F.A. Bronson R.T. Williams I.R. Kutok J.L. Yang W. Pao L.I.

These new findings underscore the importance of the role of SHP-2 in cellular processes, particularly hematopoietic cell development. However, the molecular mechanisms of JMML induced by SHP-2 GOF mutations and detailed signaling activities of SHP-2 GOF mutants in hematopoietic cells are not well characterized. The hallmark of JMML is hypersensitivity of myeloid progenitor cells to GM-CSF and IL-3 (4Birnbaum R.A. O'Marcaigh A. Wardak Z. Zhang Y.Y. Dranoff G. Jacks T. Clapp D.W. Shannon K.M. Mol.

Med. 1998; 187: 1893-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Since our previous studies showed that excessive WT SHP-2 in hematopoietic cells attenuated IL-3-induced cellular responses (20Chen J. Yu W.M. Bunting K.D. Qu C.K. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 3659-3669Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), we reasoned that SHP-2-associated JMML was not solely attributed to the increased phosphatase activity of mutant SHP-2. GOF mutant SHP-2 must have gained other capacities. To test this hypothesis and to gain more insight into the pathogenesis of SHP-2-associated leukemias, we investigated the consequences of SHP-2 E76K, the most frequent SHP-2 GOF mutation seen in JMML, on IL-3 signal transduction by comparing signaling activities of SHP-2 E76K to those of overexpressed WT SHP-2. Our results have suggested that profound changes in physical and functional interactions between GOF mutant SHP-2 and its signaling partners also play an important role in the pathogenesis of SHP-2-related JMML. Mice, Cell Line, and Reagents—WT C57BL/6 and congenic HW80 mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, MN). All animal procedures complied with the National Institutes of Health Guideline for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Ba/F3, an IL-3-dependent murine hematopoietic cell line, was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 10% conditioned medium containing mouse IL-3 (19Yu W.M. Hawley T.S.

Generation of SHP-2 E76K Retroviral Producer Cell Line and Transduction of Primary Bone Marrow Hematopoietic Stem/Progenitor Cells—SHP-2 E76K mutation was generated by PCR-based mutagenesis. The mutation was confirmed by cDNA sequencing. SHP-2 E76K cDNA was cloned into the MSCV-IRES-GFP retroviral vector (26Persons D.A. Allay J.A. Allay E.R. Ashmun R.A. Orlic D. Jane S.M. Cunningham J.M. Nienhuis A.W. Blood. 1999; 93: 488-499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) containing an internal ribosomal entry sequence (IRES) driving expression of a downstream green fluorescence protein (GFP) gene to facilitate tracking of transduced cells. Ecotropic GP+E86-based retroviral producer cell lines were generated by transduction with retroviral supernatant produced by 293T cells that were transiently co-transfected with pQEPAM3 (Minus E) packaging plasmid, pSrαG (vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein) envelope plasmid, and the recombinant SHP-2 E76K retroviral plasmid. To transduce primary hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells with SHP-2 E76K, nucleated bone marrow cells harvested from femurs of 4-week-old mice were prestimulated in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS, SCF (50 ng/ml), IL-3 (20 ng/ml), and IL-6 (50 ng/ml) for 2 days and then co-cultured with irradiated (1500 rads) retroviral producer cells in the presence of polybrene (6 μg/ml) for 48 h. Hematopoietic Progenitor Assay—Following retroviral-mediated gene transfer, transduction efficiencies of bone marrow cells were examined by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) based on expression of GFP. Transduced bone marrow cells (5 × 104 cells/ml) were then assayed for colony forming units in 0.9% methylcellulose Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s medium containing 30% FBS, glutamine (10–4m), β-mercaptoethanol (3.3 × 10–5m), and GM-CSF or IL-3 at the indicated concentrations. After 7 days of culture at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator, GFP-positive hematopoietic cell colonies were counted under an inverted fluorescence microscope. Colony-forming efficiencies were determined based on numbers of GFP-positive colonies and transduction efficiencies of the starting cells. Cell Cycle Analysis—Cell cycle analysis was performed as previously described (27Scully R. Chen J. Ochs R.L. Keegan K. Hoekstra M. Feunteun J. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 425-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Exponentially growing cells (2 × 106) were synchronized by serum starvation for 24 h and then cultured in serum-free IL-3-containing (1 ng/ml) RPMI medium for 24 h. Cells were pulsed with BrdUrd (10 μm) for 45 min, washed twice in cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and fixed in 75% ethanol at –20 °C overnight. After cells were suspended in 2 n HCl containing 0.5% Tween 20 at room temperature for 30 min, cells were washed twice in PBS (pH 7.4) to restore physiological pH and then resuspended with PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.5% Tween 20. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-BrdUrd monoclonal Ab (1 μg) was added and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Cells were washed twice in PBS, stained with propidium iodide (PI) (50 μg/ml) dissolved in PBS in the presence of 100 μg/ml of RNase A at room temperature for 30 min, and then analyzed by FACS using BD-LSR flow cytometry (BD Biosciences). Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm NaF, 2 mm Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Whole cell lysates (500 μg) were immunoprecipitated with 1–2 μg of purified Abs or 2 μl of antiserum Abs. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with HNTG buffer (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm Na3VO4) and resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with the indicated Abs. Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation—Bone marrow cells freshly harvested from C57BL/6 mice were transduced with SHP-2 E76K, WT SHP-2, or catalytically inactive SHP-2 C459S by using the retroviral producer cell lines as described above. Transduced cells were harvested and examined for transduction efficiencies by FACS based on GFP expression. Transduced cells (1–2 × 106 cells) were injected through lateral tail veins into congenic HW80 or isogenic C57BL/6 recipient mice that had been irradiated with γ-radiation (1100 rads). Animals were bled 3 months after transplantation for hematology analyses. Our previous studies have shown that although SHP-2 phosphatase plays an overall positive role in hematopoietic cell development and function (13Neel B.G. Gu H. Pao L. Trends Biochem.

Acta. 2002; 1592: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), overexpression (5–6-fold) of WT SHP-2 enhances growth factor deprivation-induced apoptosis in hematopoietic cells and decreases cellular responses to IL-3-induced proliferation and differentiation in bone marrow progenitor cells (20Chen J. Yu W.M. Bunting K.D. Qu C.K. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 3659-3669Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To confirm that overexpression of SHP-2 attenuates hematopoietic activity, we transduced bone marrow hematopoietic cells with WT SHP-2 as well as catalytically inactive SHP-2 C459S and then examined hematopoietic potential of the transduced cells in recipient animals. The bone marrow cell transduction efficiencies of WT SHP-2, SHP-2 C459S, and control vector were 28, 25, and 30%, respectively. Whole cell populations containing transduced and non-transduced cells were directly used for transplantation. As the catalytic activity of SHP-2 plays an important role in hematopoietic growth factor-induced activation of Erk kinase and Jak2 kinase (19Yu W.M. Hawley T.S. Hawley R.G. Qu C.K. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 5995-6004Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), inhibition of the catalytic activity of endogenous SHP-2 by overexpression of catalytically inactive SHP-2 C459S decreased hematopoietic potential of the transduced progenitor cells. Three months after transplantation, compared with the vector control, contribution of SHP-2 C459S-transduced cells to nucleated cells in peripheral blood of the recipient mice was dramatically decreased (Fig. 1A), even though the hematopoietic system of the recipients was well reconstituted by donor cells (including both SHP-2 C459S-transduced and non-transduced cells), as evidenced by high percentages (>95%) of donor-derived progeny cells (Ly5.1-positive) in peripheral blood (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, overexpression of WT SHP-2 also decreased hematopoietic activities of the transduced progenitor cells (Fig. 1A). Three months after transplantation, the percentages of nucleated cells derived from WT SHP-2-transduced progenitor cells in peripheral blood of the recipient animals decreased to 1–7% (Fig. 1A). These data suggest that WT SHP-2-overexpressing progenitor cells lost growth advantage when competing with non-transduced donor cells in recipient mice. GOF mutations in SHP-2 causing hyperactivation of its catalytic activity have recently been identified in human leukemias, in particular JMML (22Tartaglia M. Niemeyer C.M. Fragale A. Song X.

We generated SHP-2 E76K, the most common SHP-2 GOF mutant seen in JMML (22Tartaglia M. Niemeyer C.M. Fragale A. Song X. Buechner J. Jung A. Hahlen K. Hasle H. Licht J.D. Gelb B.D. Nat.

Transduced cells were assessed for their sensitivity to GM-CSF and IL-3 by hematopoietic colony assay. As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, SHP-2 E76K transduction increased cellular responses to GM-CSF and IL-3 in hematopoietic progenitor cells. Colony-forming capacities, in particular, at low concentrations of growth factors, were greatly enhanced by SHP-2 E76K transduction, consistent with recent reports (28Mohi M.G. Williams I.R.

Peripheral blood of these animals was examined three months after transplantation. In direct contrast to recipient mice transplanted with WT SHP-2-overexpressing cells (Fig. 1A), the contribution from SHP-2 E76K-transduced progenitors to the progeny cells in peripheral blood of all recipient mice was increased (Fig. 2C). These results suggest that SHP-2 E76K mutation confers hematopoietic progenitor cells growth advantages over non-transduced donor cells, consistent with the in vitro colony assay (Fig. 2A and 2B). Although E76K is an activating mutation and SHP-2 E76K phosphatase activity is about five times higher than that of WT SHP-2 (21Tartaglia M. Mehler E.L. Goldberg R. Zampino G. Brunner H.G.

We next decided to dissect signaling activities of SHP-2 E76K by comparing to overexpressed WT SHP-2. As SHP-2 E76K results in hypersensitivity to GM-CSF and IL-3 in myeloid progenitor cells (Fig. 2, A and B), we focused on IL-3 signal transduction. SHP-2 E76K was transduced into an IL-3-dependent hematopoietic cell line, Ba/F3 cells, and transduced cells were sorted based on GFP expression. Sorted cell pools and the WT SHP-2-overexpressing Ba/F3 cell pool that we previously generated (20Chen J. Yu W.M. Bunting K.D. Qu C.K. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 3659-3669Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) were used for subsequent signaling studies.

It has been suggested that the D-type structure (GlcA(2S)β1-3GalNAc(6S)) in CS contributes to the high affinity binding between PTPζ and pleiotrophin. Here, we analyzed the interaction of shark cartilage CS-D with pleiotrophin using a surface plasmon resonance biosensor to reveal the importance of D-type structure. CS-D was partially digested with chondroitinase ABC, and fractionated using a Superdex 75pg column. The ≥18-mer CS fractions showed significant binding to pleiotrophin, and the longer fractions had stronger affinity for pleiotrophin than the shorter ones. The ∼46-mer CS fraction bound to densely immobilized pleiotrophin with high affinity (KD = ∼30 nm), and the binding reactions fitted the bivalent analyte model. However, when the density of the immobilized pleiotrophin was lowered, the strength of affinity remarkably decreased (KD = ∼2.5 μm), and the reactions no longer fitted the model and were considered to be monovalent binding. The 20∼24-mer fractions showed low affinity binding to densely immobilized pleiotrophin (KD = 3∼20 μm), which seemed to be monovalent. When ∼22-mer CS oligosaccharides were fractionated by strong anion exchange HPLC, each fraction differed in affinity for pleiotrophin (KD = 0.36 ∼ >10 μm), and the affinity correlated with the amounts of D- and E- (GlcAβ1-3GalNAc(4S,6S)) type oversulfated structures. These results suggest that the binding of pleiotrophin to CS is regulated by multivalency with CS ∼20 mer as a unit and by the amounts of oversulfated structures.

These observations raise the possibility that multimers of pleiotrophin and midkine bind with PTPζ through CS inducing the dimerization of this receptor. Previously, we demonstrated that the structure of CS on phosphacan changed during development of rat brain, and even at the same developmental stage, the CS structure varied depending on the region of the brain (16Maeda N.

An analysis using a surface plasmon resonance biosensor indicated that phosphacan bearing the CS with D unit (GlcA(2S)β1-3GalNAc(6S)) had higher affinity for pleiotrophin than that without this structure (16Maeda N.

The binding of phosphacan with pleiotrophin and midkine was inhibited by various CS preparations (9Maeda N. Nishiwaki T. Shintani T. Hamanaka H. Noda M. J. Biol.

The binding was inhibited strongly by squid cartilage CS-E and shark cartilage CS-D, moderately by shark cartilage CS-C and very weakly by whale cartilage CS-A (9Maeda N. Nishiwaki T. Shintani T.

CS-E and CS-D contain large amounts of E-type (GlcAβ1-3GalNAc(4S,6S)) and D-type structures, respectively. C unit (GlcAβ1-3GalNAc(6S)) is the major component of CS-C, which additionally contains moderate amounts of D unit. On the other hand, the amounts of the oversulfated structures are very small in CS-A, in which A unit (GlcAβ1-3GalNAc(4S)) is the major component. These findings suggested that D- and E-type oversulfated structures in CS chains play important roles in the determination of the affinity of pleiotrophin and midkine for PTPζ. However, the contribution of the D unit in CS to the binding with these growth factors is yet to be clearly demonstrated. Some researchers reported that CS-E but not CS-D strongly bound with midkine and suggested that the E-type structure was the critical determinant of the binding affinity for midkine (17Ueoka C.

In the present study, we analyzed the interaction of CS-D with pleiotrophin to reveal the structural determinants involved in the pleiotrophin-CS interaction. We suggest that three parameters: chain length, amounts of oversulfated structures, and pleiotrophin multimerization, play important roles in determination of the binding affinity between CS and pleiotrophin. Materials—Human recombinant pleiotrophin and anti-human pleiotrophin antibody were purchased from R&D systems (Minneapolis, MN). CS-D from shark cartilage was provided by Dr. Nobuo Sugiura (Seikagaku Corp., Central Research Laboratories, Tokyo, Japan).

Maxisorp immunoplates were purchased from Nunc (Rochester, NY). The biosensing system used for surface plasmon resonance measurements consisted of a BIAcore 1000 and BIAevaluation software 4.1 (Biacore AB). Disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS) was obtained from Pierce. Phosphacan/6B4 proteoglycan was purified from P20 rat whole brain as described previously (22Maeda N. Hamanaka H. Oohira A. Noda M. Neuroscience. 1995; 67: 23-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Preparation and Fractionation of CS Oligosaccharides—First, 120 mg of shark cartilage CS-D (O unit (GlcAβ1-3GalNAc): A unit:C unit:D unit:E unit is 1.5:25.9:50.4:18.8:3.4; average molecular mass ∼20 kDa) was dissolved in 1.5 ml of 30 mm sodium acetate, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.8. The solution was incubated with 30 milliunits of protease-free chondroitinase ABC at 30 °C until the absorbance at 232 nm of the sample reached 8.5% of the value obtained after complete digestion. The sample was heated at 100 °C for 5 min and then applied to a column of Bio-Gel P-10 (1.6 × 90 cm) equilibrated with 0.4 m ammonium acetate. The fractions corresponding to Kav values of 0.16∼0.61 and 0.45∼0.77 were pooled. After lyophilization, the samples were applied to a Superdex 75pg column (1.6 × 60 cm) and eluted with 0.2 m NH4HCO3 at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The fractions were lyophilized and then dissolved in distilled water. The 22-mer fraction was further chromatographed using a Spherisorb S5 SAX column (4.6 × 250 mm) with a linear gradient of NaCl from 0.8 m to 1.35 m at pH 3.5 at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The fractions were desalted using a HiTrap desalting column equilibrated with 0.2 m NH4HCO3 and lyophilized. Characterization of CS—The disaccharide composition of CS was determined as follows. CS (2 μg) was diluted with 20 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 15 mm sodium acetate. The samples were incubated with 50 milliunits of chondroitinase ABC for 2 h at 37 °C,and then heated at 100 °C for 1 min. The samples were applied to a YMC PA-03 column (4.6 × 250 mm) and eluted with a linear gradient of NaH2PO4 from 16 to 500 mm over 60 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The eluates were monitored by absorbance at 232 nm. Chain lengths of CS (up to 24 mer) were determined using a Voyager DE-STR MALDI-TOF MS spectrometer. The chain lengths of CS larger than 24 mer were estimated from the Kav value of each fraction on the Superdex 75pg column with a standard curve generated using 6-20 mer of CS oligosaccharides. Solid Phase Binding Assay—Wells of Nunc Maxisorp immunoplates were coated with 2 μg/ml of pleiotrophin in 30 μl of 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8 at 4 °C overnight. The wells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin/PBS for 1 h at room temperature. CS oligosaccharides diluted with 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS (reaction buffer) were added to the wells (30 μl/well), and the plates were incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Then, 5 μlof1 μg/ml of phosphacan/6B4 proteoglycan were added to each well, and the plates were incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes with the reaction buffer, 35 μl of anti-6B4 proteoglycan (1:500) diluted in the reaction buffer were added to each well, and the plates were incubated for 30 min at room temperature. After three more washes, 35 μl of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:500) diluted in the reaction buffer were added to each well, and the plates were again incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The wells were washed three times with the reaction buffer, and 200 μl of 0.1 mg/ml of o-phenylenediamine, 0.006% H2O2 were added to each well. After ∼10 min, the reaction was stopped by adding 10 μl of 1 m HCl, and the absorbance at 450 nm was measured. Immobilization of Pleiotrophin on the Sensor Surface—Pleiotrophin was immobilized on the surface of a CM5 sensor chip by amine coupling, where the primary amino groups on the protein were coupled to the carboxymethylated dextran on a sensor chip surface. The carboxymethylated dextran on the sensor chip was activated by injection of 35 μl of N-ethyl-N′-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride/N-hydroxysuccinimide (0.2/0.05 m). Then, 20 μg/ml of pleiotrophin in 10 mm maleate buffer, pH 6.0, was injected onto the activated sensor surface. The remaining unreacted sites were blocked by injecting 35 μl of 1 m ethanolamine, pH 8.5. The amounts of pleiotrophin immobilized on the sensor surface were controlled within the range of 2,900 and 6,300 resonance units (RU) by changing the injection time. All steps were carried out in a continuous flow of a solution containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, and 0.005% Tween 20 (HBS running buffer) at 5 μl/min. Surface Plasmon Resonance Analysis—All experiments were carried out at a flow rate of 20 μl/min at 25 °C. Each sample was diluted in HBS running buffer and injected onto the sensor surface. The sensor surface was regenerated with 10 μl of 2 m NaCl after a dissociation phase. To correct for the bulk effects and the nonspecific binding of samples, the equivalent sample solutions were injected onto an untreated sensor surface, and the responses obtained were subtracted from the pleiotrophin-immobilized sensor surface data. The kinetic parameters were evaluated with BIAevaluation software 4.1 using a bivalent analyte model and Scatchard plot. The data are expressed as the mean ± mean absolute deviation of at least two independent measurements. Cross-linking Experiments—Pleiotrophin (0.3 μg) was incubated at room temperature with various concentrations of CS fractions in a final volume of 10 μl in 0.05% Tween 20/PBS. Then, 0.5 μl of 25 mm DSS was added to the each sample, which was incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The reactions were quenched for 30 min with 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, and the samples were analyzed by 12.5% SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Cross-linked pleiotrophin was detected using anti-human pleiotrophin antibody and ECL kit according to the supplier’s protocol. Binding of CS Oligosaccharides to Pleiotrophin—Previously, we demonstrated that shark cartilage CS-D bound to pleiotrophin with high affinity using the BIAcore system (16Maeda N. He J. Yajima Y. Mikami T. Sugahara K. Yabe T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35805-35811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Many of the chondroitin sulfate-dependent activities of pleiotrophin such as promotion of neurite extension and migration of embryonic neurons are mediated by substrate-bound form of this growth factor (1Muramatsu T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 132: 359-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 2Rauvala H. Huttunen H.J. Fages C. Kaksonen M. Kinnunen T. Imai S. Raulo E. Kilpelainen I.

Thus we immobilized pleiotrophin on the CM5 sensor chips by the amine coupling method because it seems that this closely models the active form of pleiotrophin. However, there was a possibility that this coupling method could destroy lysine residues that are essential for binding with CS. So we firstly immobilized pleiotrophin preincubated with excess amounts of CS oligosaccharides to protect CS binding basic amino acids. However, it became apparent that the sensorgrams of the binding of various CS preparations to pleiotrophin were essentially the same, whether or not pleiotrophin was preincubated with CS oligosaccharides (data not shown). Thus in the following experiments, pleiotrophin was coupled to the sensor chips without preincubation with CS oligosaccharides. To characterize the CS structure required for binding to pleiotrophin, we fractionated CS-D partially digested with protease-free chondroitinase ABC by Superdex 75 gel permeation chromatography. Each fraction (10 μg/ml as hexuronate) was applied to a CM5 sensor chip containing immobilized pleiotrophin (Fig. 1). In this assay, a saturated amount of pleiotrophin was immobilized on the sensor chip (5,942 RU) to maximize the sensitivity. As shown in Fig. 1A, CS fractions bound to pleiotrophin, but the binding decreased sharply as the chain length shortened. Although the 18-mer fraction showed slight binding to pleiotrophin, we could not detect any binding for ≤16-mer oligosaccharides in this assay system (Fig. 1B). In a previous study, we demonstrated that the binding of phosphacan to pleiotrophin was strongly inhibited by CS-D (10Maeda N. Ichihara-Tanaka K. Kimura T. Kadomatsu K. Muramatsu T. Noda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12474-12479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Using a solid phase binding assay, we next examined the inhibitory effects of CS oligosaccharides on the binding of phosphacan to pleiotrophin. The binding was inhibited efficiently by ≥20-mer oligosaccharides, moderately by 16-mer and 18-mer oligosaccharides, and not by 14-mer oligosaccharides (Fig. 2). These findings suggest that 16∼18 mer was the basic functional unit required for the binding to pleiotrophin. Multivalent Binding of CS to Pleiotrophin—The above experiments indicated that longer CS bound more efficiently to pleiotrophin than shorter ones. This suggests that the affinity of CS for pleiotrophin was increased by multivalent binding of long polysaccharides to multiple pleiotrophin immobilized on the sensor chip. To test this possibility, the ∼46-mer CS fraction (F-a, Fig. 1A) was applied to sensor chips immobilized with various densities of pleiotrophin. Three sensor chips were prepared, on which low (2,461 RU; low density condition), medium (2,905 RU; medium density condition), and high (4,753 RU; high density condition) amounts of pleiotrophin were immobilized. During the immobilization process, the amounts of immobilized pleiotrophin increased rapidly to ∼4,000 RU (∼4 ng/mm2). Then, the reaction became very slow with a maximum immobilization of ∼6,000 RU (∼6 ng/mm2) (data not shown). This suggests that pleiotrophin was immobilized sparsely on the sensor chips under the low and medium density conditions, and the density of immobilized pleiotrophin was semisaturated under the high density condition. Fig. 3 shows the binding of fraction F-a to the sensor chips immobilized with three different densities of pleiotrophin. Under the high density condition (Fig. 3A), CS associated relatively slowly with pleiotrophin, and the dissociation also proceeded gradually. In contrast, under the low density condition (Fig. 3E), fraction F-a associated with pleiotrophin very quickly and also dissociated quickly, showing “box-shaped” sensorgrams. The sensorgrams were intermediate between the two under the medium density condition (Fig. 3C). We analyzed these sensorgrams using various binding models in BIAevaluation software 4.1. Although the 1:1 (Langmuir) binding model is most commonly used, these sensorgrams did not fit this model well. On the other hand, the sensorgrams shown in Fig. 3, A and C fitted the bivalent analyte model well. The bivalent analyte model is schematically represented in Fig. 9A, in which one CS chain (C) binds with two pleiotrophin units (P) immobilized on the sensor chip. In this model, CS binds with one pleiotrophin unit (reaction 1) and then with another (reaction 2), and the kinetic parameters for each reaction can be calculated using the BIAevaluation software, in which the dissociation constant of the reaction 1 (KD1) characterizes the binding. The KD1 values for the interaction under the medium and high density conditions were calculated to be 2.2 and 0.5 μm, respectively (Table 1).TABLE 1Kinetic parameters for the interaction between the CS 46-mer fraction and various densities of PTN The KD, ka1, kdl, KD1, ka2, and kd2 values were calculated from the sensorgrams using six or more concentrations of analyte (CS) in two or three independent experiments.PTNScatchard analysis, KDBivalent analyte modelka1kdlKD1ka2kd2RUμM1/Ms1/sμM1/RUsI/s47530.062 ± 0.008(1.4 ± 0.6) × 1050.07 ± 0.020.5 ± 0.3(2.1 ± 0.5) × 10-5(10 ± 1) × 10-429050.4 ± 0.1(4.1 ± 2.0) × 1040.09 ± 0.022.2 ± 1.5(4 ± 3) × 10-5(6 ± 2) × 10-424612.5 ± 0.8—aThe values could not be determined because the sensorgrams did not fit the bivalent analyte model—aThe values could not be determined because the sensorgrams did not fit the bivalent analyte model—aThe values could not be determined because the sensorgrams did not fit the bivalent analyte model—aThe values could not be determined because the sensorgrams did not fit the bivalent analyte model—aThe values could not be determined because the sensorgrams did not fit the bivalent analyte modela The values could not be determined because the sensorgrams did not fit the bivalent analyte model Open table in a new tab Although KD1 represents the strength of the interaction between CS and one pleiotrophin unit, we cannot know from this value the overall strength of the binding between these molecules in a bivalent reaction. However, using a steady state analysis (Scatchard plot), we can reveal overall binding strength between CS and the immobilized pleiotrophin (KD, avidity), in which the sum of the binding strength of reaction 1 and reaction 2 is calculated. So, the sensorgrams were then analyzed by plotting steady state binding responses against concentrations of CS (Fig. 3, B, D, F). As shown in Table 1, the KD values for the interaction under the high, medium, and low density conditions were calculated to be 62 nm, 0.4 μm, and 2.5 μm, respectively. The KD values for the interactions under high and medium density conditions were 6∼8-fold smaller than the KD1 values, suggesting that bivalent binding of CS to two pleiotrophin units led to the stronger interaction between these molecules. The sensorgrams of the low density condition could not be analyzed with the bivalent model, and only the results of the Scatchard analysis were available (Fig. 3F). Chain Length-dependent Binding of CS to Pleiotrophin—The CS oligosaccharides of various chain lengths were applied to sensor chips immobilized with 5,942 RU of pleiotrophin. In this experiment, a saturated level of pleiotrophin was immobilized on the sensor chips to improve sensitivity for the binding of short oligosaccharides. The sensorgrams of the long CS (Fig. 4, A and B) were similar to that shown in Fig. 3A. On the other hand, shorter CS showed box-shaped sensorgrams (Fig. 4C). Scatchard analysis indicated that the affinity of CS fractions decreased as the chain length shortened (Table 2), and F-a (∼ 46 mer), F-c (∼ 34 mer), and F-e (∼28 mer) CS fractions showed KD values of 30, 170,"

The essential role of both RANKL and RANK in the osteoclastogenic process has been unambiguously demonstrated by the findings that mice lacking the gene for either protein develop osteopetrosis due to failure to form osteoclasts (13Kong Y.Y.

Because the unraveling of the RANKL/RANK system, enormous efforts have been focused on elucidating RANK-initiated intracellular signaling. RANK was identified as a member of the TNF receptor (TNFR) family (3Anderson D.M. Maraskovsky E. Billingsley W.L. Dougall W.C. Tometsko M.E. Roux E.R. Teepe M.C. DuBose R.F. Cosman D. Galibert L. Nature. 1997; 390: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1946) Google Scholar). Members of the TNFR family lack intrinsic enzymatic activity, and hence, they transduce intracellular signals by recruiting various adaptor proteins including TNF receptor-associated factors (TRAFs) through specific motifs in the cytoplasmic domain (16Locksley R.M. Killeen N. Lenardo M.J. Cell. 2001; 104: 487-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3018) Google Scholar, 17Chung J.Y. Park Y.C. Ye H. Wu H. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 679-688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Six TRAF proteins (TRAF1, -2, -3, -4, -5, and -6) have been identified so far, and they play important but distinct roles in TNFR member-induced intracellular signaling (17Chung J.Y. Park Y.C. Ye H. Wu H. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 679-688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Numerous in vitro studies demonstrated that RANK indeed interacts with various TRAF proteins (10Hsu H. Lacey D.L. Dunstan C.R.

Our recent functional study revealed that RANK contains three functional TRAF-binding sites (369PFQEP373, 559PVQEET564, and 604PVQEQG609) that redundantly play a role in osteoclast formation and function (23Liu W.

In particular, the 369PFQEP373 site mediates osteoclastogenesis by recruiting TRAF6 (24Ye H. Arron J.R. Lamothe B. Cirilli M. Kobayashi T. Shevde N.K. Segal D. Dzivenu O.K. Vologodskaia M. Yim M. Du K. Singh S. Pike J.W. Darnay B.G. Choi Y. Wu H. Nature. 2002; 418: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). Collectively, through these functional TRAF binding motifs, RANK activates six major signaling pathways NF-κB, JNK, ERK, p38, NFATc1, and Akt, which play important roles in osteoclast formation, function and/or survival (8Boyle W.J. Simonet W.S. Lacey D.L. Nature. 2003; 423: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (4929) Google Scholar, 9Feng X. Gene (Amst.). 2005; 350: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 23Liu W. Xu D.

However, several lines of evidence suggest that RANK may also activate novel pathways to regulate osteoclastogenesis. For example, although it has been established that both RANK and interleukin 1 (IL-1) receptor utilize TRAF6 to activate intracellular signaling pathways (26Inoue J. Ishida T. Tsukamoto N. Kobayashi N. Naito A. Azuma S. Yamamoto T. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 254: 14-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), administration of IL-1 to RANK–/– mice fails to promote osteoclast formation (15Li J. Sarosi I. Yan X.-Q. Morony S. Capparelli C. Tan H.-L. McCabe S. Elliott R. Scully S. Van G. Kaufman S. Juan S.-C. Sun Y. Tarpley J. Martin L. Christensen K. McCabe J. Kostenuik P. Hsu H. Fletcher F. Dunstan C.R. Lacey D.L. Boyle W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1566-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar). The complete absence of osteoclasts in the RANK–/– mice administrated with IL-1 suggests that RANK activates other novel signaling pathways essential for osteoclastogenesis. Similarly, two other reports demonstrated that IL-1 fails to stimulate osteoclastogenesis in vitro in the presence of M-CSF (27Azuma Y. Kaji K. Katogi R. Takeshita S. Kudo A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4858-4864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar, 28Kobayashi K. Takahashi N. Jimi E. Udagawa N. Takami M. Kotake S. Nakagawa N. Kinosaki M. Yamaguchi K. Shima N. Yasuda H. Morinaga T. Higashio K. Martin T.J. Suda T. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 275-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). Furthermore, RANK has a very long cytoplasmic domain (mouse RANK is 391-aa long, and human RANK is 383-aa long) that shares no homology with any known members of the TNFR family (3Anderson D.M. Maraskovsky E. Billingsley W.L. Dougall W.C. Tometsko M.E. Roux E.R. Teepe M.C. DuBose R.F. Cosman D. Galibert L. Nature. 1997; 390: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1946) Google Scholar), suggesting that it may activate downstream signals different from those arising from its cousins. In the present study we set out to identify the novel RANK signaling pathways essential for osteoclastogenesis by carrying out a detailed structure/function study of the RANK cytoplasmic domain. Using numerous internal deletion and point mutation constructs, we have identified a novel RANK motif (535IVVY538) that is essential for osteoclastogenesis. We further demonstrate that this novel RANK motif plays a crucial role in osteoclastogenesis by committing macrophages to the osteoclast lineage. In line with this notion, this RANK motif is not implicated in osteoclast function or survival. In addition, we have also shown that this motif is not involved in activating the signaling pathways previously known to be activated by RANK, indicating that the motif mediates a novel signaling pathway(s). Significantly, the identification of the novel RANK motif will provide a foundation for elucidating downstream novel signaling pathways essential for osteoclastogenesis. This novel RANK motif and its downstream signaling pathways may serve as specific and potent therapeutic targets for various bone disorders such as postmenopausal osteoporosis, inflammatory bone loss, and tumor-induced osteolysis. Chemicals and Reagents—Chemicals were purchased from Sigma unless indicated otherwise. Synthetic oligonucleotides were purchased from Sigma-Genosys (The Woodlands, TX). Blasticidin was from EMD Biosciences, Inc. (San Diego, CA). Antibodies against the external domain of mouse TNFR1 (for flow cytometry) (TNF-R1, sc-12746PE) and c-fos (sc-253) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Recombinant mouse TNFα (410-TRNC-050) was from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). The following antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Beverly, MA): antibodies against IκBα (#9242), phospho-IκBα (#9241), p44/42ERK (#9102), phospho-p44/42ERK (#9101), JNK (#9252), phospho-JNK (#9251), p38 (#9212), phospho-p38 (#9211), Akt (#9272), and phospho-Akt (#9271). Preparation of Retrovirus and Infection of Bone Marrow Macrophages (BMM)—We used the chimeric receptor construct (pMX-puro-TNFR1-RANK) and the retrovirus system described in Liu et al. (23Liu W. Xu D. Yang H. Xu H. Shi Z. Cao X. Takeshita S. Liu J. Teale M. Feng X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54759-54769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) for the present study. Plat-E cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum supplemented with puromycin and blasticidin as previously described (29Morita S. Kojima T. Kitamura T. Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 1063-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (1361) Google Scholar). pMX-puro-TNFR1-RANK and its various deletion/point mutation mutants were transiently transfected into Plat-E cells using Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen). Virus supernatant was collected at 48, 72, and 96 h after transfection. Bone marrow cells were isolated from long bones of 4–8-week-old TNFR1–/–R2–/– double knock-out mice (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) or wild-type mice (Harlan Industries, Indianapolis, IN) as described (30Feng X. Novack D.V. Faccio R. Ory D.S. Aya K. Boyer M.I. McHugh K.P. Ross F.P. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 1137-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). BMMs were prepared by culturing isolated bone marrow cells in α-minimal essential medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum in the presence of 0.1 volume of culture supernatant of M-CSF-producing cells for 2 days as previously described (31Takeshita S. Kaji K. Kudo A. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 1477-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Cells were then infected with virus for 24 h in the presence of 0.1 volume of culture supernatant of M-CSF-producing cells and 8 μg/ml Polybrene. Cells were further cultured in the presence of M-CSF and 2 μg/ml puromycin for selection and expansion of transduced cells. Selected cells were subsequently used for various studies. In Vitro Osteoclastogenesis Assays—Retrovirally infected BMMs were cultured in 24-well tissue culture plates (5×104 cells/well) in α-minimal essential medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum in the presence of 0.02 volume of culture supernatant of M-CSF-producing cells (final M-CSF concentration is 44 ng/ml) and 100 ng of glutathione S-transferase-RANKL (32Lam J. Takeshita S. Barker J.E. Kanagawa O. Ross F.P. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 106: 1481-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar). In osteoclast formation assays involving the use of the chimeric receptor, TNFα was added at concentrations as indicated in individual assays. Osteoclasts began to form on day 3, and cultures were stained for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase activity on day 6 using a commercial kit (Sigma, 387-A). In Vitro Bone Resorption and Osteoclast Survival Assays—To perform bone resorption assays, osteoclasts were generated on bovine cortical bone slices from infected or uninfected BMMs with the stimulation of M-CSF (44 ng/ml) and RANKL (100 ng/ml) for 4 days. After osteoclasts were formed, the cultures were then treated with different factors as indicated in the individual assays and then continued for 3 more days. Then, bone slices were harvested, and cells were removed from the bone slices with 0.25 m ammonium hydroxide and mechanical agitation. Bone slices were then subjected to scanning electron microscopy. The data were quantified by counting and statistically analyzing pits in 5 random resorption areas (at 30× magnification) and by measuring the percentage of the pits areas in 4 random resorption sites. The percentage of the pits area was determined using Metamorph software from Molecular Devices Corporation (Downingtown, PA). The osteoclast survival assays were performed by generating osteoclasts in tissue culture dishes from infected or uninfected BMMs with the stimulation of M-CSF (44 ng/ml) and RANKL (100 ng/ml) for 4 days. After osteoclasts were formed, the cultures were then treated with different factors as indicated in the individual assays and then continued for 6 more hours. The cultures were then stained for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase activity using a commercial kit (Sigma, 387-A). Survived osteoclasts were determined as those cells with strong tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase activity and intact plasma membrane. Flow Cytometric Analysis—Infected BMMs (up to 1 ×106 cells) were suspended in 200 μl phosphate-buffered saline/azide. Cells were then blocked with 1 μg of 2.4G2 antibody (33Unkeless J.C. J. Exp. Med. 1979; 150: 580-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (1091) Google Scholar) for 30 min on ice. Under dim light, 20 μl of TNFR1 antibody conjugated with phycoerythrin (Santa Cruz, sc-12746PE) or control IgG was added to the cell suspension, and cells were incubated on ice for 30 min. Cells were washed twice with 1 ml of cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)/azide and resuspended in 300 μl of cold PBS/azide. 200 μl of cold 0.5% paraformaldehyde solution was added to fix the cells. Flow cytometric analysis was performed using a BD Biosciences FACScan (BD Biosciences Immunocytometry Systems, Mountain View, CA). Construction of Deletion Mutants and Mutagenesis—Construction of internal deletion was performed based on a method described in by Barnhart (34Barnhart K.N. Biotechniques. 1999; 26: 624-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Briefly, to delete a region in the RANK cytoplasmic tail in TNFR1-RANK chimera, we used SK-TNFR1-RANK plasmid described in our previous study (23Liu W. Xu D. Yang H. Xu H. Shi Z. Cao X. Takeshita S. Liu J. Teale M. Feng X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54759-54769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) as the template and two primers to perform a PCR with Pfu polymerase (high fidelity polymerase). Both primers contain an MluI restriction site at its 5′ end and a sequence complementary to a desired region of the template. The PCR reaction generated a linear full-plasmid-length product lacking the desired sequence, and the product contained a MluI site at each of its ends. The PCR product was cut with MluI, religated, and sequenced to confirm that no mutations were introduced during PCR amplification. Then, the TNFR1-RANK construct containing the internal deletion was cut out and subcloned into pMX-puro retrovirus vector. Mutations were generated in SK-TNFR1-RANK using the Quik-Change™ Site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The mutated sites were confirmed by sequencing, and other regions in the chimeric cDNA were sequenced to confirm that no mutations were introduced by PCR amplification during the mutagenesis. The mutant chimeric cDNAs were then subcloned into pMX-puro plasmids. Western Analysis—BMMs infected with retrovirus or control BMMs (uninfected) were cultured in serum-free α-minimal essential medium in the absence of M-CSF for 16 h for IκB, JNK, ERK, and p38 assays or 4 h for Akt assays before treatment with RANKL or TNF-α for various times as indicated in individual experiments. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed in buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture 1 (Sigma, P-2850) and 1× protease inhibitor mixture 2 (Sigma, P-5726). Lysates were then subjected to Western analysis as described in our previous study (23Liu W. Xu D. Yang H. Xu H. Shi Z. Cao X. Takeshita S. Liu J. Teale M. Feng X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54759-54769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Membranes were washed extensively, and an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection assay was performed using SuperSignal West Dura kit from Pierce. Quantification of the blots was performed using ImageJ analysis software obtained from NIH (rsb.info.nih.gov/ij). Identification of a 40-aa RANK Intracellular Segment Essential for Osteoclastogenesis—Previously, we reported the characterization of three functional TRAF binding motifs in the RANK cytoplasmic domain by using a chimeric receptor consisting of mouse TNFR1 external domain linked to the transmembrane and intracellular domains of mouse RANK (23Liu W. Xu D. Yang H. Xu H. Shi Z. Cao X. Takeshita S. Liu J. Teale M. Feng X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54759-54769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In the current study we use the same chimeric receptor approach to identify novel RANK motifs involved in osteoclastogenesis. Mouse RANK has a 391-aa cytoplasmic domain. Initially, we generated 20 deletion mutants (D1–D20) (Fig. 1A). In D1, an 18-aa segment (from aa 235 to aa 252) was deleted. In D2-D19, a 20-aa segment was deleted. In D20, the last 13-aa of the RANK cytoplasmic domain was removed (Fig. 1A). Deletion of such small segments (20 aa or smaller) is to minimize the potential effect of the deletions on the three-dimensional structural integrity of the RANK cytoplasmic domain, which is critical for its function. To determine whether these mutants are capable of mediating osteoclastogenesis, we expressed wild-type chimera (WT) and the mutants in primary bone marrow macrophages (BMMs, namely, primary osteoclast precursors) derived from TNFR1–/–R2–/– double knock-out mice using a retroviral system as described in our previous study (23Liu W. Xu D. Yang H. Xu H. Shi Z. Cao X. Takeshita S. Liu J. Teale M. Feng X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54759-54769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Infected BMMs were selected with 2 μg/ml puromycin for 2 days, then selected BMMs expressing WT chimera or the mutants were treated with M-CSF (44 ng/ml) and TNF-α (10 ng/ml). The data indicate that all mutants except for D15 and D16 are able to mediate osteoclastogenesis, revealing that the regions deleted in D15 and D16 are functionally critical for osteoclastogenesis. Fig. 1B shows the cultures of negative control (uninfected BMMs), positive control (BMMs expressing WT chimera), D15, D16, and several representatives of ineffective mutants (D1, D5, D10, D14, D17, and D18). To rule out the possibility that the failure of D15 and D16 to form osteoclasts is caused by the inability of these two mutants to be expressed on cell surface, we performed flow cytometric analysis with antibody against the external domain of TNFR1, and our data demonstrated that both D15 and D16 were expressed on the cell surface of infected BMMs (Fig. 1C). Fig. 2A shows the schematic location and aa sequence of the segments deleted in D15 and D16. In support of the critical role of the segments deleted in D15 and D16 in osteoclastogenesis, these two segments are located within a RANK cytoplasmic region that is highly conserved between human and mouse (Fig. 2B). Moreover, these segments are not overlapped with the three functional TRAF binding motifs identified previously (23Liu W. Xu D. Yang H. Xu H. Shi Z. Cao X. Takeshita S. Liu J. Teale M. Feng X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54759-54769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B). Identification of a 4-aa Motif in the RANK Intracellular Region Essential for Osteoclastogenesis—To further identify specific motifs in the 40-aa RANK segment that are involved in osteoclastogenesis, we generated 10 more internal deletion mutants designated as SD1-SD10 (Fig. 3A). In each mutant four amino acids in the 40-aa segment were deleted (Fig. 3A). Then we performed osteoclastogenesis assays with these 10 mutants. As shown in Fig. 3B, when infected BMMs expressing these mutants were treated with M-CSF (44 ng/ml) and TNFα (10 ng/ml), SD4, SD5, SD6, and SD7 failed to mediate osteoclastogenesis, indicating that the residues deleted in these mutants are crucial for osteoclastogenesis. We repeated the assays with higher TNF-α concentrations (30 ng/ml). Although SD6 and SD7 still generated no osteoclasts in response to the higher dose of TNF-α, SD4 and SD5 cultures contained a few osteoclasts. This result indicates that the residues deleted in SD6 and SD7 are more critical for osteoclastogenesis than those deleted in SD4 and SD5. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that SD4, SD5, SD6, and SD7 were all expressed on cell surface (Fig. 3D), confirming that the failure of these mutants to form osteoclasts is not due to a defect in their cell surface expression. To identify specific amino acid residues in the eight-aa RANK segment (DIIVVYVS) mediating osteoclastogenesis, we prepared four point mutation mutants PM1, PM2, PM3, and PM4 (Fig. 4A). In each mutant, two residues are mutated. To minimize the effect of the point mutations on the three-dimensional structure of the RANK cytoplasmic domain, we converted each of the eight residues to another one with similar polarity, charge, and chemical structure. Osteoclastogenesis assays with these point mutants showed that only PM2 and PM3 failed to mediate osteoclast formation, revealing that four amino acid residues (IVVY) are essential for osteoclastogenesis. Flow cytometric analysis confirmed that PM2 and PM3 were expressed on the cell surface (Fig. 4C). The Novel RANK Motif Plays a Crucial Role in Osteoclastogenesis by Committing Macrophages to the Osteoclast Lineage—A previous study demonstrated that the RANKL/RANK system plays an important role in committing macrophages to the osteoclast lineage (32Lam J. Takeshita S. Barker J.E. Kanagawa O. Ross F.P. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 106: 1481-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar). Next, we investigated whether the novel RANK motif is involved in committing macrophages to the osteoclast lineage. To this end we sought to devise an experimental approach that enables us to activate the novel motif-mediated signal at the beginning o"

However, the signaling pathways mediating this response are still not fully understood. We show that inhibition of protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK) with Genistein and protein kinase A (PKA) with KT5720, decreased forskolin-stimulated amiloride-sensitive short circuit current (Isc) across H441 adult human lung epithelial cell monolayers. KT5720 also decreased basal Isc. Stable expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-labeled human αENaC in H441 cells was used to investigate dynamic changes in the cellular localization of this protein in response to forskolin. Reverse transcription-PCR and immunoblotting analysis revealed two clones expressing a truncated (αC3-5) and full-length (αC3-3) EGFP-hαENaC protein. Only the αC3-3 clone displayed dome formation and exhibited a 50% increase in basal and forskolin-stimulated amiloride-sensitive Isc indicating that the full-length protein was required for functional activity. Apical surface biotinylation and real-time confocal microscopy demonstrated that EGFP-hαENaC (αC3-3) translocated to the apical membrane in response to forskolin in a Brefeldin A-sensitive manner. This effect was completely inhibited by Genistein but only partially inhibited by KT5720. Forskolin also induced a reduction in the height of cells within αC3-3 monolayers, indicative of cell shrinkage. This effect was inhibited by KT5720 but not by Genistein or Brefeldin A. These data show that forskolin activates PKA-sensitive cell shrinkage in adult human H441 lung epithelial cell monolayers, which induces a PTK-sensitive translocation of EGFP-hαENaC subunits to the apical membrane and increases amiloride-sensitive Na+ transport.

Apical surface biotinylation and real-time confocal microscopy demonstrated that EGFP-hαENaC (αC3-3) translocated to the apical membrane in response to forskolin in a Brefeldin A-sensitive manner. This effect was completely inhibited by Genistein but only partially inhibited by KT5720. Forskolin also induced a reduction in the height of cells within αC3-3 monolayers, indicative of cell shrinkage. This effect was inhibited by KT5720 but not by Genistein or Brefeldin A. These data show that forskolin activates PKA-sensitive cell shrinkage in adult human H441 lung epithelial cell monolayers, which induces a PTK-sensitive translocation of EGFP-hαENaC subunits to the apical membrane and increases amiloride-sensitive Na+ transport. Transport of Na+ through the amiloride-sensitive Na+ channel (ENaC), 2The abbreviations used are: ENaC, amiloride-sensitive epithelial Na+ channel; PKA, protein kinase A; PTK, protein-tyrosine kinase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; RT, reverse transcription; IBMX, isobutylmethylxanthine; WGA, wheat germ agglutinin; FDLE, fetal distal lung epithelial. 2The abbreviations used are: ENaC, amiloride-sensitive epithelial Na+ channel; PKA, protein kinase A; PTK, protein-tyrosine kinase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; RT, reverse transcription; IBMX, isobutylmethylxanthine; WGA, wheat germ agglutinin; FDLE, fetal distal lung epithelial. found in the apical membrane of polarized lung epithelial cells, is considered the rate-limiting step for transepithelial Na+ movement and the regulation of lung fluid re-absorption via osmosis (1O'Brodovich H. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: C555-C564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ENaC comprises three subunits α, β, and γ (2Canessa C.M. Schild L. Buell G. Thorens B. Gautschi I. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1994; 367: 463-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the α-subunit is capable of forming an Na+-conducting pore and that β and γ augment its conductance (2Canessa C.M. Schild L. Buell G. Thorens B. Gautschi I. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1994; 367: 463-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar). Channels may be formed when αENaC is expressed independently of the β and γ subunits (3Jain L. Chen X.J. Malik B. Al-Khalili O. Eaton D.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: L1046-L1051Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Jain L. Chen X.J. Ramosevac S. Brown L.A. Eaton D.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: L646-L658Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For this reason, expression of the α-subunit is considered of critical importance. This has been demonstrated in αENaC knock-out mice where death of newborn mice lacking αENaC was shown to be the result of an inability to clear their lungs of fluid (5Hummler E. Barker P. Gatzy J. Beermann F. Verdumo C. Schmidt A. Boucher R. Rossier B.C. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 325-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar). A more recent study has extended these findings and indicated that the low mRNA abundance level of αENaC in nasal epithelium of premature infants is associated with respiratory failure (6Helve O. Pitkanen O.M. Andersson S. O'Brodovich H. Kirjavainen T. Otulakowski G. Pediatrics. 2004; 113: 1267-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar).At birth, the lungs undergo a transition from a fluid-filled to that of an air-filled (post-natal) state, a requirement for normal breathing and efficient gas-exchange. In the fetal sheep and guinea pig lung, a surge in plasma adrenaline around and during the time of birth has been shown to correlate with increased amiloride-sensitive fluid re-absorption (7Walters D.V. Olver R.E. Pediatr. Res. 1978; 12: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 8Finley N. Norlin A. Baines D.L. Folkesson H.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 972-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The ability of adrenaline to mediate lung fluid re-absorption has also been shown to be retained throughout adult life (9Norlin A. Baines D.L. Folkesson H.G. J. Physiol. 1999; 519: 261-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Adrenaline is thought to act through the cAMP second messenger system, and its effects on fluid absorption can be mimicked by agents that increase intracellular cAMP such as forskolin (10Saumon G. Basset G. Bouchonnet F. Crone C. Pflugers Arch. 1987; 410: 464-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 11Goodman B.E. Anderson J.L. Clemens J.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: L86-L93Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Walters D.V. Ramsden C.A. Olver R.E. J. Appl. Physiol. 1990; 68: 2054-2059Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In the rat fetal distal lung cell, the action of cAMP is thought to increase the recruitment of ENaC subunits to the apical membrane by increased trafficking via a Brefeldin A-sensitive pathway (13Ito Y. Niisato N. O'Brodovich H. Marunaka Y. Pflugers Arch. 1997; 434: 492-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This phenomenon is also upheld in adult human bronchiolar epithelial H441 cells (14Ramminger S.J. Richard K. Inglis S.K. Land S.C. Olver R.E. Wilson S.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: L411-L419Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) where the apical conductance of ENaC is also increased by cAMP (14Ramminger S.J. Richard K. Inglis S.K. Land S.C. Olver R.E. Wilson S.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: L411-L419Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 15Itani O.A. Auerbach S.D. Husted R.F. Volk K.A. Ageloff S. Knepper M.A. Stokes J.B. Thomas C.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: L631-L641PubMed Google Scholar, 16Lazrak A. Matalon S. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: L443-L450Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, which ENaC subunits are recruited to the apical membrane and the signaling pathways involved remains unclear in lung cells. Elevation of cAMP by β2-adrenoreceptor agonists is classically associated with activation of protein kinase A (PKA). However, evidence indicates that the effect of β2-adrenoreceptor activation on the trafficking of ENaC may not involve a direct effect of PKA and may utilize alternative pathways that involve protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK) (17Niisato N. Ito Y. Marunaka Y. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: L727-L736PubMed Google Scholar, 18Marunaka Y. Niisato N. Ito Y. J. Korean Med. Sci. 2000; 15: S42-S43Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The dissection of the mechanisms by which elevated cAMP increases ENaC subunit trafficking in the lung cell membrane is therefore the key to our understanding of how this channel contributes to the regulation of lung fluid homeostasis.In A6 renal epithelial cells, it has been shown by confocal microscopy that sub-membrane pools of ENaC protein exist that can be translocated to the membrane when stimulated with forskolin or insulin (19Blazer-Yost B.L. Butterworth M. Hartman A.D. Parker G.E. Faletti C.J. Els W.J. Rhodes S.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C624-C632Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Blazer-Yost B.L. Vahle J.C. Byars J.M. Bacallao R.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: C1569-C1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This indicates that active trafficking of ENaC subunit proteins to the membrane is an important regulatory process. Evidence also indicates that the trafficking of ENaC subunits to the apical membrane can also take place in a non-coordinate manner (21Weisz O.A. Wang J.M. Edinger R.S. Johnson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39886-39893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar).In this study, we have used a combination of complementary approaches to investigate the role of PKA and PTK in mediating the effects of forskolin-elevated cAMP on amiloride-sensitive Na+ transport in human lung epithelial cell monolayers. We have generated green fluorescent protein (GFP)-labeled human αENaC chimeric proteins and stably expressed them in H441 lung epithelial cells. Using measurement of short-circuit current, apical surface biotinylation, immunoblotting, and real-time confocal microscopy, we have investigated the relationship between dynamic changes in EGFP-hαENaC distribution and functional Na+ transport in lung cells in response to forskolin stimulation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—H441 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA) and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum (10%) (Immune Systems Ltd.), l-glutamine (2 mm), sodium pyruvate (1 mm), insulin (5 μg/ml), transferrin (5 μg/ml), sodium selenite (10 nm), and antibiotics (penicillin/streptomycin). Cells were seeded in 25-cm2 flasks and incubated in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2-95% O2 at 37 °C.Design of EGFP-human αENaC Construct—cDNA encoding human (h) αENaC was first subcloned into pGEMT Easy (Promega) using standard procedures. The expression vector EGFP-hαENaC (pαC3) was generated by amplifying the coding region of hαENaC using primers that incorporated the restriction enzyme sites XhoI/BamHI (sense, 5′-agagagctcgagggaattatggaggggaacaagctgga3′; antisense, 5′-tgtgtgtggatcccttaatcagggccccaggtggagga-3′).PCR products were then cloned directionally and in-frame into the XhoI/BamHI sites of pEGFP-C3 (Clontech). Plasmid sequences and reading frame were confirmed by DNA sequencing (Sequence Laboratories London Ltd.). Primers were also designed within regions of both the EGFP and hαENaC sequence for sequence analysis and RT-PCR amplification of EGFP-hαENaC mRNA sequences in transfected cells. From 5′-3′ these were β2S, atggtcctgctggagttcgt; ASH, acccgatgtatggaaactgct; ASHR, agcagtttccatacatcgggt; HCR, gtggatcccttaatcagggccccaggtggagga; EGFP(sense), ggtgagcaagggcgaggagctg; and EGFP(antisense), cccttcagctcgatgcggttca. β-Actin primers were obtained from Clontech.Transfections—H441 cells (1 × 105) were plated onto 6-well culture dishes and grown to ∼80% confluence. Transfection with the EGFP-hαENaC construct or EGFP alone (positive control) was accomplished by incubating the cells in serum-free medium containing DNA (3 μg/well) and Lipofectamine at a ratio of 4:1 for ∼5 h. Cells were then incubated overnight in 10% fetal bovine serum, which was replaced the following day. At 48-h post-transfection, cells were re-plated onto 6-well dishes at 103 cells/well in the presence of Geneticin (1 mg/ml, Invitrogen). After 1-2 weeks, independent Geneticin-resistant cell clones were expanded into 25-cm3 flasks and maintained in the presence of 500 mg/ml Geneticin.RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from control and transfected H441 cells using Tri-Reagent (Sigma). cDNA was synthesized from 2 μg of RNA using 1 unit of avian myeloblastosis virus-reverse transcriptase (Promega) and 100 nm oligo-dT15 primers. RT-PCR was performed using 20-bp primer sequences derived from regions within the pEGFP C3 vector and hαENaC coding regions in a PCR reaction mix (75 mm Tris, pH 9.0, 20 mm (NH4)2SO4, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1% Tween 20, 250 nm of each primer, and 0.2 unit of AGS gold Taq polymerase (Hybaid, Ashford, Middlesex, UK)) and a cycling protocol of 94 °C for 1 min, 56 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min for 40 cycles. PCR products were fractionated on 1.2% agarose gels and visualized by ethidium bromide staining and UV fluorescence.Surface Biotinylation—Control H441 cells or those stably expressing full-length EGFP-hαENaC (αC3-3) were seeded onto 24-mm Transwells (Costar Transwells, Corning) and cultured overnight. The following day, the serum in the medium was replaced with 4% charcoal-stripped serum, and the supplementations also included thyroxine (10 nm) and dexamethasone (200 nm). Cells were cultured for 6 days at air interface, and Transwells supporting resistive monolayers of cells (>500 Ω. cm-2) were treated bilaterally with 10 μm forskolin (activator of adenylyl cyclase) and 100 μm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX, phosphodiesterase inhibitor) for 30 min at 37 °C, or treated with vehicle only as a control. Forskolin and IBMX are both known to elevate cAMP levels (22Koh G. Suh K.S. Chon S. Oh S. Woo J.T. Kim S.W. Kim J.W. Kim Y.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 438: 70-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar); therefore, stimulation with these agents is referred to as “forskolin stimulation” throughout this report. Transwells were washed with ice-cold physiological salt solution (in mm): NaCl, 117; NaHCO3, 25; KCl, 4.7; MgSO4, 1.2; KH2PO4, 1.2; CaCl2, 2.5 (equilibrated with 5% CO2 to pH 7.3-7.4) then the apical membrane was biotinylated using 0.5 mg/ml S-S-biotin (Pierce) in borate buffer (in mm) (NaCl, 85; KCl, 4; Na2B4O7, 15), pH 9, for 20 min (23Butterworth M.B. Edinger R.S. Johnson J.P. Frizzell R.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2005; 125: 81-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The reaction was stopped by adding a double volume of fetal bovine serum-containing medium on the apical surface. Monolayers were then washed with ice-cold physiological salt solution, and cells were scraped into biotinylation lysis buffer (0.4% deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm EGTA, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4) containing 1% protease inhibitors (Sigma) and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. Non-solubilized protein was removed by centrifugation, and protein concentrations of the supernatants were determined (Bio-Rad). Similar concentrations of protein from treated and untreated Transwells (∼1 mg) were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 30 μl of immobilized streptavidin beads (Pierce). The following day, the beads were washed extensively in biotinylation lysis buffer, and protein was eluted in sample buffer containing reducing agent (Invitrogen, according to the manufacturer’s instructions). Samples were incubated for 30 min at room temperature, heated at 95 °C for 5 min, fractionated on SDS-PAGE gels, and immunoblotted with anti-αENaC (Abcam, UK). Immunostained proteins were visualized using ECL (Amersham Biosciences).Immunoprecipitation—H441 cells and clones were washed briefly with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and harvested into ice-cold tissue lysis buffer (in mm): Tris, 50 (pH 7.4); NaCl, 150; NaF, 50; sodium pyrophosphate, 5; EDTA, 1; EGTA, 1; dithiothreitol, 1; 1% v/v Triton X-100; and 1% protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Lysates were pre-cleared with 3% Protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) overnight at 4 °C on a rocker/roller. Pre-cleared supernatants were then incubated with anti-EGFP (Abcam) for 1 h on ice. Protein-antibody complexes were bound to a fresh column of beads for a further hour. After several washes in lysis buffer, proteins bound to the beads were eluted into sample buffer (as above) heated at 95 °C for 5 min, subjected to Western blot analysis, immunostained with anti-αENaC (Abcam), and visualized using ECL (Amersham Biosciences).Functional Experiments—Confluent flasks of H441 cell clones were seeded at 1:12 confluent density on Snapwell clear membranes (Costar Transwells, Corning) and treated as described for Transwells (see above). Because basal levels of ion transport across monolayers vary considerably between batches of cells, all experiments (treatments or otherwise) were carried out on cells that were plated on the same day, and results are compiled from at least three sets of paired data, analyzed in parallel. Monolayers, were pre-treated in culture (bilaterally) for 30 min with PKA inhibitor KT5720 (1 μm), PTK inhibitor Genistein (100 μm), or vehicle control. Snapwells supporting resistive monolayers of H441 cells (>500 Ω cm-2) were mounted in Ussing chambers, and Isc was measured as previously described (24Woollhead A.M. Scott J.W. Hardie D.G. Baines D.L. J Physiol. 2005; 566: 781-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Forskolin-stimulated Na+ transport was measured in H441 cell clones before and after pre-treatment with inhibitors (see above). 10 μm forskolin and 100 μm IBMX were added to the solution perfusing both the apical and basolateral side of the monolayer. Changes in Isc were monitored for 15-20 min until a new stable level had been reached. At this point, 10 μm amiloride (EC50, 0.7 μm) 3D. Baines, unpublished data. was added to the apical solution, and amiloride-sensitive Isc was calculated.Microscopy—Confluent monolayers of αC3-3 cells, grown on plastic, formed fluid-filled hemicysts or domes, which were imaged using an inverted Nikon Eclipse TE300 light microscope with a ×10 objective. For confocal microscopy, cells were either plated on glass coverslips (no. 1, BDH, UK) or grown on Snapwell clear membranes as described above. Cells grown on coverslips were treated in culture with 10 μm forskolin and 100 μm IBMX or vehicle for 30 min, washed in ice-cold phosphate buffered saline, and then incubated on ice with rhodamine-conjugated wheat germ agglutinin (WGA, 2 μg/ml, Molecular Probes) for 30 min prior to fixation with 1% paraformaldehyde (Sigma). Coverslips were mounted in fluorescent mounting medium (Mowiol, Calbiochem) ready to be imaged the following day. In the live cell studies, Snapwells supporting resistive monolayers of clones were either treated in culture with KT5720 (1 μm), Genistein (100 μm), or the vesicle trafficking inhibitor, Brefeldin A (1 μm) or left un-treated as control. Snapwell inserts were then placed on coverslips (no. 1, Nunc) secured on the stage-plate and filled with 500 μl of phenol-red-free culture media (Invitrogen) to bathe the apical side of the monolayer. Confocal microscopy was performed with an inverted Zeiss LSM 510 Meta microscope, equipped with an oil immersion objective (×40), which was used for all imaging. For the dual imaging of EGFP and WGA, fluorescent images were collected in the multichannel mode by exciting the fluorophores at 488 and 568 nm, respectively. The depth of the acquired z-series was defined by the EGFP-associated fluorescence within the cell. WGA, which was used to specifically label cell membranes, provided us with a means to identify z-planes in which the labeled surface proteins colocalized with EGFP-tagged proteins within the apical membrane. In fixed cells differential and heterogeneous staining was observed in both control H441 cells and those expressing EGFP-hαENaC or EGFP alone. In the live cell studies, WGA staining was not sufficient to provide optimal intensity and did not enable us to show high quality double stained images. These studies were conducted at 37 °C, which may have affected the association/dissociation of the WGA with its substrate. Similar problems with WGA have previously been reported in kidney epithelial cells (19Blazer-Yost B.L. Butterworth M. Hartman A.D. Parker G.E. Faletti C.J. Els W.J. Rhodes S.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C624-C632Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, fluorescence was sufficient to provide us with a means of localizing apical z-planes that contained both WGA and EGFP fluorescence. Furthermore, because EGFP-hαENaC is distributed throughout the cell, the entire cell could be visualized. The semi-permeable filter of the Snapwells also had an innate fluorescence allowing us to definitively orientate the cells. Sequential z-sections were acquired at 1-μm intervals from this point encompassing the entire monolayer. A time-series over a period of 40 min was acquired automatically at 5-min intervals. The time course for these experiments was increased compared with the functional studies as they were carried out at room temperature not 37 °C. Any microscope drift was compensated for by using the innate fluorescence of the filter as a reference point by which to align the image stacks. After the first z-series was acquired, 10 μm forskolin and 100 μm IBMX were added to the media bathing the cells, and sequential z-sections were acquired for a further 40 min. Cell movement through an optical plane was initially a confounding issue as the cells exhibited dynamic changes (shrinkage) during treatment. However, using the criteria outlined above we were able to track the apical z-plane. Images representing the apical surface of the cell in the x/y-plane were used to compile fluorescence intensity measurements from a number of independent cells (n = 11) within a monolayer. These included cells with both high and low levels of expression of the construct. Using Scion Image Software (National Institutes of Health) pixel intensity was measured for the area occupied by that cell in the apical z-plane before and after treatment with forskolin/IBMX. Images of the apical z-plane (x/y) field of view are used to show the multicellular response of the monolayer to treatments. Measurements of cell height from apical to basolateral regions (defined by EGFP-associated fluorescence and position of filter) were taken from cells in the y/z plane (side-on view).Statistical analysis was carried out using Student’s unpaired or paired t-tests where p values of < 0.05 were considered significant. Results are presented as mean ± S.E.RESULTSEffect of Forskolin on Ion Transport Processes across H441 Cell Monolayers—Application of forskolin/IBMX to H441 cell monolayers was carried out before and after application of amiloride (Fig. 1A, i and ii). Forskolin induced a significant rise in Isc from 10.9 ± 1.6 μA cm-2 to 14.1 ± 2.0 μA cm-2, p < 0.001, n = 10, that was inhibited by amiloride to 2.8 ± 0.4 μA cm-2, p < 0.001, n = 10. Pre-treatment with amiloride (control Isc, 9.7 ± 1.9 μA cm-2; amiloride, 2.6 ± 1.1 μA cm-2, p = 0.01, n = 5) prevented the forskolin-induced rise in Isc (1.5 ± 0.3 μA cm-2, p = 0.01, n = 3). The amiloride-sensitive component of Isc (Iamiloride) was significantly higher after forskolin treatment (p < 0.05, n = 10). In all experiments, there was no further visible blockade after basolateral application of ouabain (data not shown).Role of PKA and PTK in Regulating Ion Transport Processes across H441 Cell Monolayers—Forskolin induced a 34 ± 7% rise in amiloride-sensitive Isc (Iamiloride) from 9.7 ± 1.3 μA cm-2 to 13.2 ± 1.8 μA cm-2 (p < 0.05, n = 8) in H441 cell monolayers. This forskolin-stimulated rise in Iamiloride was significantly blocked by Genistein to 71 ± 8% of control currents (p < 0.01, n = 5) (Fig. 1B). KT5720 exhibited a more profound inhibition of Iamiloride to 58 ± 5% of control currents (p < 0.01, n = 4). Application of Genistein and KT5720 together also inhibited the forskolin stimulated rise in Iamiloride to 80 ± 22% (p < 0.05, n = 3) (Fig. 1B). Together these results indicate that both PKA- and PTK-dependent pathways are involved in mediating the forskolin-stimulated increase in Iamiloride in H441 cells, but their effect was not additive. Interestingly, KT5720 also significantly inhibited basal Isc in H441 cells (control: 9.7 ± 1.3 μA cm-2; KT5720: 4.6 ± 0.9 μA cm-2, p < 0.05, n = 4), whereas Genistein was without significant effect (n = 4).Stable Expression of EGFP-hαENaC in H441 Cells and RT-PCR—H441 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding EGFP-hαENaC (pαC3) or EGFP alone (pEGFP-C3). Geneticin-resistant clones were expanded and screened for EGFP fluorescence. Three clones (αC3-3, αC3-5, and GFP7) were chosen based on their homogeneity in terms of EGFP-associated fluorescence. RT-PCR amplification of the structural protein β-actin was carried out on all clones to control for RNA quality and abundance. A 450-bp β-actin product was amplified from αC3-3, αC3-5, and GFP7 at similar yield. RT-PCR analysis using primers to amplify sequences from EGFP (β2-sense) to the C-terminal of the hαENaC sequence (HCR), from β2-sense to an internal hαENaC sequence (ASHR) (reverse), and from this site (ASH) (forward) to HCR were used to confirm expression of full-length EGFP-hαENaC mRNA in the clones (Fig. 2, A and C). Products of the correct predicted size were amplified from the plasmid construct pαC3 and the αC3-3 clone but not from αC3-5, GFP7 (Fig. 2A), or untransfected cells (data not shown). Amplification of the full-length EGFP-hαENaC product from β2-sense-HCR resulted in a lower product yield from clone αC3-3 compared with that of the two shorter products (β2-sense-ASHR and ASH-HCR) that encompass either half of the construct. The yield of this product was also reduced when amplified from the control plasmid pαC3. Therefore, this finding most likely reflects a reduced efficiency of amplification rather than a reduced abundance of full-length mRNA product in αC3-3. RT-PCR using primers to amplify EGFP-coding region sequences showed that EGFP was present in GFP7 and αC3-5 cell clones (Fig. 2B). No transcripts for EGFP were detected in untransfected control cells. Taken together these data show that full-length EGFP-hαENaC mRNA was expressed in the αC3-3 clone but a genetically truncated product containing at least, EGFP, was present in the αC3-5 clone (Fig. 2C). GFP7, as expected expressed mRNA for EGFP alone.FIGURE 2RT-PCR analysis of EGFP-hαENaC mRNA expression in H441 cell clones. A, RT-PCR was used to amplify sequences from 200 ng of total RNA extracted from clones transfected with EGFP-hαENaC (αC3-3 and αC3-5) or EGFP alone (GFP7). PCR was used to amplify sequences from 10 ng of control EGFP-hαENaC plasmid DNA (pαC3). The position of the primer pairs used for the amplification reactions are shown in C and are detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” Amplification of β-actin was used as a reaction control. Amplified products were resolved on 1.2% agarose gels, stained with ethidium bromide, and visualized with UV light. DNA size markers are exhibited in the lane to the extreme left of the gels. Products corresponding to the expected sizes for β-actin (450 bp) were amplified from RNA extracted from all clones (αC3-3, αC3-5, and GFP7). EGFP-hαENaC sequences, β2s plus HCR (2095 bp), β2s plus ASHR (965 bp), and ASH plus HCR (1114 bp), were amplified from the plasmid pαC3, and RNA was extracted from the αC3-3 clone but not from αC3-5 or GFP7. B, RT-PCR amplification of EGFP sequences from αC3-5 and GFP7. B, products corresponding to EGFP (381 bp) were amplified from 10 ng of pαC3 DNA and 200 ng of RNA extracted from αC3-5 and GFP7 cells but not from untransfected controls (control). C, schematic diagram of the EGFP-hαENaC construct (pαC3) and the position of primers used in this study. The position of the anti-αENaC antibody binding site located at the N terminus of the protein (amino acids 20-42) is also indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Immunoprecipitation of EGFP-hαENaC Proteins from H441 Cell Clones—To confirm that EGFP-hαENaC proteins translated from the RNA transcripts were expressed in the clones, cell lysates (∼0.5 mg of total protein) were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-EGFP, separated by SDS-PAGE, and Western blotted with anti-αENaC (Fig. 3A). The anti-αENaC epitope is located at the N terminus of the hαENaC protein (Fig. 2C).

It is unclear how different cells can generate a signal of varying intensity and duration in response to the same cytokine. We investigated the role of the transcriptional activator and Smad1/4 cofactor OAZ in regulating bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling. We demonstrate that upon BMP4 stimulation, an OAZ-Smad1/4 complex binds to and activates the gene encoding Smad6, a specific inhibitor of the BMP pathway. Removal of endogenous OAZ from pluripotent embryonal carcinoma cells prevents the induction of Smad6 by BMP4 and extends the period of detection of phosphorylated Smad1 after BMP stimulation. Conversely, in cells that do not normally express OAZ, such as myoblasts and smooth muscle cells, forced OAZ expression leads to faster and higher Smad6 induction in response to BMP4, decrease of Smad1 phosphorylation, and attenuation of BMP-mediated responses. Our results demonstrate that OAZ can alter the intensity and duration of the BMP stimulus through Smad6 and indicate that the tissue-specific expression of OAZ is a critical determinant of the cellular response to the BMP signal.

Perturbations of signals evoked by TGFβs and transduced by Smad proteins have been implicated in several developmental disorders and in various human diseases, including cancer, fibrosis, autoimmunity, and pulmonary hypertension. Such diversity of effects and responses is caused in large part by the cell type specificity of the TGFβ signal, the local concentration of ligand, and the activity of other signal transduction pathways. Recent studies have provided insights into several of the determinants of specificity in the Smad signaling pathways, including combinatorial ligand-receptor associations, selective interactions between Smads and other pathway components that are mediated through defined binding motifs, and the regulation of duration and intensity of signaling. Typically, signaling initiates with TGFβs binding and activating specific dual cell surface receptors (type I and type II receptors) that have intrinsic serine/threonine kinase activity. Activated receptors phosphorylate receptor-regulated Smad proteins (R-Smads). Among the nine mammalian R-Smads, Smad1, Smad5, and Smad8 are phosphorylated by type I receptors specific for BMPs, whereas Smad2 and Smad3 are activated by TGFβs, activins, or Nodals. Upon phosphorylation, R-Smads form a complex with Smad4 (known as common partner of R-Smads or Co-Smad) and accumulate in the nucleus. Here the R-Smads·Co-Smad complex can bind DNA or be recruited by interactions with transcription factors to specific promoter elements of target genes. Low affinity direct binding can occur to the palindromic sequence GTCTAGAC, known as the Smad-binding element (SBE) (1Zawel L. Dai J.L. Buckhaults P. Zhou S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Kern S.E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 611-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). Several TGFβ-regulated promoters (e.g. plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, collagenase I, c-jun, IgA, and junB) contain one or multiple copies of the SBE half-site (5′-AGAC-3′), which has been shown to bind the Smad3-Smad4 complex. Activation of other promoters requires the cooperation of sequence-specific cofactors including FoxH1 family member (FAST1 and FAST2), Mixer/Milk, c-Jun/c-Fos, PEBP2/Runx, and TFII-I family members (TFII-I and BEN) (2Ku M.C. Sokol S.Y. Wu J. Tussie-Luna M.I. Roy A.L. Hata A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 7144-7157Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 3Massagué J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1759Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The interaction between Smads and cofactors provides Smads with increased sequence specificity and higher affinity to DNA. Because these cofactors are often expressed in a tissue-specific manner, specific Smads-cofactor complex formation is recognized as one of the determinants of specificity of the TGFβ signaling pathway (3Massagué J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1759Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Attisano L. Tuen Lee-Hoeflich S. Genome Biol. 2001; 2Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The first identified Smad-interacting transcription cofactor of the BMP signaling pathway was Xenopus OAZ (also known as EBFAZ, ROAZ, or ZNF423). OAZ is composed of 30 Krüppel-like zinc fingers; it can interact with the Smad1-Smad4 complex after BMP stimulation, bind to the promoter region of the Xenopus homeobox gene Vent-2, and activate its transcription. Two different sets of OAZ zinc fingers are involved in the interaction with Smads and in binding to DNA, and no intrinsic transcriptional stimulatory activity has been found (5Hata A. Seoane J. Lagna G. Montalvo E. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massague J. Cell. 2000; 100: 229-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (Parp1) was identified as a protein partner of OAZ by a yeast two-hybrid screen. The enzymatic activity of Parp1 is essential for BMP-mediated activation of the Xvent-2 promoter (6Ku M.C. Stewart S. Hata A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 311: 702-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), presumably because the poly(ADP-ribosylation) of OAZ, Smads, or other proteins facilitates the recruitment of cofactors or of the basal transcription machinery. XVent-2 is a transcriptional repressor that carries out several of the embryological effects of BMPs in Xenopus, such as ventralization of mesoderm and suppression of neuralization (5Hata A.

Development. 1998; 125: 1447-1456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The BMP response element (BRE) in the Xvent-2 promoter includes one SBE and one OAZ binding sequence (OBS; GCTCCA) (5Hata A. Seoane J. Lagna G. Montalvo E. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massague J. Cell. 2000; 100: 229-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). The essential role of OAZ and OBS in the regulation of Xvent-2 expression has been established by different approaches in Xenopus: 1) expression of a dominant-negative mutant form of OAZ into the ventral side of embryos leads to inhibition of Xvent-1 and Xvent-2 transcription and dorsalization of mesoderm (5Hata A. Seoane J. Lagna G. Montalvo E. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massague J. Cell. 2000; 100: 229-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar); and 2) in transgenic Xenopus embryos expressing the green fluorescence protein reporter gene under the regulation of the Xvent-2 promoter, mutation of the OBS in the Xvent-2 promoter leads to misexpression of green fluorescence protein (9Karaulanov E. Knochel W. Niehrs C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 844-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The human and mouse orthologs of OAZ are expressed in embryonic tissues responsive to BMP, suggesting that OAZ might be involved in BMP responses during early embryogenesis in mammals. However, a mammalian gene regulated by BMP through OAZ has not been identified. Recently, a protein structurally similar to OAZ, named Early Hematopoietic Zinc Finger protein (EHZF) (also known as Evi3 or ZNF521), has been identified (10Bond H.M. Mesuraca M. Carbone E. Bonelli P. Agosti V. Amodio N. De Rosa G. Di Nicola M. Gianni A.M. Moore M.A. Hata A. Grieco M. Morrone G. Venuta S.

Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2727-2731Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Both OAZ and EHZF contain 30 Krüppel-like zinc fingers and have an overall homology of 63.5% (10Bond H.M. Mesuraca M. Carbone E. Bonelli P. Agosti V. Amodio N. De Rosa G. Di Nicola M. Gianni A.M. Moore M.A. Hata A. Grieco M. Morrone G. Venuta S. Blood. 2004; 103: 2062-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The homology is lower (50% on average) in the region known to interact with the BRE of the Xvent-2 promoter (zinc fingers 9-13), as well as in some of the zinc fingers responsible for the interaction with Smads (zinc fingers 14-19) (10Bond H.M.

Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massague J. Cell. 2000; 100: 229-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 10Bond H.M. Mesuraca M. Carbone E. Bonelli P. Agosti V. Amodio N.

Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2727-2731Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Therefore, it has been speculated that OAZ and EHZF might recognize distinct arrays of molecular partners and regulate distinct sets of target genes. The mouse Smad6 gene was characterized as a target gene of the BMP signaling pathway (13Ishida W. Hamamoto T. Kusanagi K. Yagi K. Kawabata M. Takehara K. Sampath T.K. Kato M. Miyazono K. J. Biol.

Commun. 1998; 244: 26-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). With Smad7, Smad6 belongs to a distinct subclass of Smads (Inhibitory Smads or I-Smads) that antagonize R-Smads and inhibit signaling. Smad7 acts as a general inhibitor of TGFβ signaling by interacting with activated type I receptors and preventing their phosphorylation of R-Smad (4Attisano L. Tuen Lee-Hoeflich S. Genome Biol. 2001; 2Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Science. 2002; 296: 1646-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar, 16Massagué J. Annu. Rev.

Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 274-279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Smad7 can also recruit to the activated type I receptor a family of E3 ubiquitin ligases known as Smad ubiquitination regulatory factor (Smurf)-1 and Smurf-2, resulting in receptor ubiquitination and degradation and subsequent termination of signaling. Unlike Smad7, Smad6 acts as a specific inhibitor of BMP signaling by competing with Smad4 for complex formation with Smad1 (and presumably Smad5 and Smad8) (19Hata A. Lagna G. Massagué J. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 186-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 20Horiki M. Imamura T. Okamoto M. Hayashi M. Murai J. Myoui A. Ochi T. Miyazono K. Yoshikawa H.

Nature. 1997; 389: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). When overexpressed, Smad6 can also associate with type I receptors and inhibit Smad phosphorylation. In this report, we demonstrate that the BMP-mediated transcriptional activation of Smad6 requires OAZ as a cofactor. Down-regulation of OAZ in OAZ-positive embryonic carcinoma P19 cells leads to prolonged duration of the BMP signal because of a lack of Smad6 induction. Furthermore, misexpression of OAZ in OAZ-negative C2C12 myoblasts and primary pulmonary smooth muscle cells leads to early attenuation of the BMP signal and inhibition of BMP-dependent responses, such as osteoblastic differentiation and apoptosis, respectively. Cell Culture and DNA Transfection—Both P19 and C2C12 cell lines (American Type Culture Correction) were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FCS, Hyclone). C2C12 and P19 cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Human primary pulmonary smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) were purchased from Cambrex and were maintained in Sm-GM2 medium (Cambrex) containing 10% FCS. PASMCs were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Antibodies—BMP receptor-phosphorylated Smad1 was detected with anti-phospho-Smad1/5/8 rabbit monoclonal antibody (41D10, Cell Signaling Technology). OAZ was detected with goat anti-OAZ polyclonal antibodies (E-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Smad1 and Smad6 were detected with rabbit polyclonal antisera raised against synthetic peptides (Upstate Biotechnology and Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was detected with mouse anti-GAPDH monoclonal antibody (clone 1D4, COVANCE). Plasmid Constructs—A reporter containing three copies of the BRE of the mouse Smad6 promoter was generated by inserting the oligonucleotides containing the wild type or mutated BRE sequence into the pE1b-Luc vector (5Hata A. Seoane J. Lagna G. Montalvo E. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massague J. Cell. 2000; 100: 229-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). The wild type and mutant BRE sequences are: 5′-CGGGCCGCGCCGGCTCCAGGGCAGGAGCGGCCTTAA-3′ (WT), 5′-CGGTCCGCTCCGATCCAGGGCAGGAGCGGCCTTAA-3′ (MUT1), and 5′-CGGGCCGCGCCGAATCCAGGGCAGGAGCGGCCTTAA-3′(MUT2). Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR Assay—Cells were treated with 200 ng/ml BMP4 (R&D Systems) in 0.2% FCS and DMEM. Total RNA was extracted by TRIzol (Invitrogen), and 5 μg of total RNA was subjected to RT using a first-strand cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. One-tenth of the reaction mixture was used as template for each PCR. The products of semiquantitative PCR were separated on a SDS-PAGE. The quantitative analysis of the change in expression levels was calculated by real time PCR (Bio-Rad) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Primers used are: 5′-CCACTTGGAGACTTCTTCTTCTTCG-3′ and 5′-ATGTAGGGCAGCATCTGGTGCG-3′ for mouse Smad6, 5′-GTCGACCGAGGAGCCTCTTA-3′ and 5′-AAGCTCCTCTTGTCCTTGGAG-3′ for mouse Id3, and 5′-CACCCGCAGCTGTCCGAGAAGGC-3′ and 5′-CTCCACAGAGGCGCTGGAGTCGGG-3′ for mouse OAZ. Human GAPDH primers and mouse hypoxanthine-guanines phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) primers were described before (5Hata A. Seoane J. Lagna G. Montalvo E. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massague J.

RNA Interference—Synthetic small interference RNA (siRNA) was purified and annealed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Dharmacon). The siRNA sequence targeting OAZ corresponds to nucleotides 17-37 after the start codon. siRNA with a nontargeting sequence (Dharmacon) was used as a negative control. The siRNAs were transfected by OligofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 48 h after transfection, cells were treated with BMP4 and harvested. Transfection efficiencies as determined by fluorescent-labeled siRNA (Dharmacon) were in the range of 80-90%. Specific silencing of OAZ was confirmed by Western blotting using anti-Smad1 (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), anti-lamin A, and anti-vimentin antibodies as described previously (23Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Weber K. Tuschi T. Methods. 2002; 2: 199-213Crossref Scopus (1031) Google Scholar). Luciferase Assay—After transfection, the cells were reseeded onto 12-well plates and treated with 200 ng/ml BMP4 for 20 h in 0.2% FCS and DMEM. Luciferase assays were carried out essentially as described previously (5Hata A. Seoane J. Lagna G. Montalvo E. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massague J. Cell. 2000; 100: 229-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Immunoblot Assay—Cells were treated with 200 ng/ml BMP4 and lysed in TNE buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl). Proteins were separated on a SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, immunoblotted with antibodies, and visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Constructions of Recombinant Adenoviruses—Recombinant adenoviruses were constructed as described previously (24He T.-C. Zhou S. Da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3256) Google Scholar). Briefly, FLAG-epitope tagged OAZ and Smad6 cDNAs were subcloned into the pShuttle-CMV vector. The recombinant adenoviruses generated by homologous recombination were isolated, and high titer stocks of recombinant viruses were grown in 293 cells and purified. Infection of recombinant adenoviruses was performed at a multiplicity of infection of <8 × 102 plaque-forming units/cell. As a control, adenovirus driving β-galactosidase (LacZ) expression was used (Vector Biolabs, Inc.) Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—The chromatin immunoprecipitation assay was performed as described previously (25Shang Y. Hu X. DiRenzo J. Lazar M.A. Brown M. Cell. 2000; 103: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1457) Google Scholar, 26Seki K. Hata A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18544-18549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Chromatin was sheared to an average length of 400 bp. We used a set of PCR primers for the detection of the mSmad6 BRE (-901/-832) and a control set corresponding to the 5′-upstream region of mSmad6 (-2031/-1853). Alkaline Phosphatase Assay—Histochemical analysis of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity was performed in 12-well plates as described previously (27Katagiri T. Yamaguchi A. Komaki M. Abe E. Takahashi N. Ikeda T. Rosen V. Wozney J.M. Fujisawa-Sehara A. Suda T. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1755-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1302) Google Scholar, 28Fujii M. Takeda K. Imamura T. Aoki H.

After histochemical ALP analysis by phase contrast microscopy, the ALP activity was quantified by measuring the absorbance with the image documentation system Imagestore 7500 (Packard). Apoptosis Assay—Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay was performed following manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, PASMCs were cultured in serum-free DMEM for 48 h, followed by stimulation with 200 ng/ml BMP4 for 48 h. Cells were then subjected to TUNEL assay using a Cell Death Detection kit (Roche Applied Science). Statistical Analysis—Statistical significance was determined by analysis of variance and Fisher’s least significant difference, or by Student’s t test analysis (p < 0.05) as appropriate. All data are plotted as the mean ± S.E. A Putative OAZ Binding Sequence Is Conserved in the Mouse and Human Smad6 Promoters—Smad6 is a known direct BMP target gene in vertebrates. The BMP receptor-specific Smads, Smad1 and Smad5, as a complex with Smad4 (13Ishida W. Hamamoto T. Kusanagi K. Yagi K. Kawabata M. Takehara K. Sampath T.K. Kato M. Miyazono K. J. Biol.

To identify a conserved region of the Smad6 promoter potentially involved in BMP-mediated transcriptional regulation, we aligned the mouse Smad6 promoter with the promoter of its human ortholog (Fig. 1A). A 57-bp region (-891/-834) of the mouse Smad6 promoter is highly conserved in the human Smad6 promoter (-1062/-1003) (Fig. 1A, sequence highlighted). A 28-bp sequence (-874/-847) within this region (Fig. 1A, underlined) has been identified previously as a region critical for BMP-mediated activation of the mouse Smad6 promoter and has been named BMP response element (13Ishida W. Hamamoto T. Kusanagi K. Yagi K. Kawabata M. Takehara K. Sampath T.K. Kato M. Miyazono K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6075-6079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). We found two head-to-head repeats of a putative OBS, which was identified previously in the Xenopus BMP target genes Vent-2 and Vent-1B, in both the mouse and human Smad6 promoter (Fig. 1A, shown with arrows, and Fig. 1B, black boxes) (5Hata A. Seoane J. Lagna G. Montalvo E. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massague J. Cell. 2000; 100: 229-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). This observation suggests that OAZ might be involved in the transcriptional activation of Smad6 by the BMP signaling pathway. Furthermore, two sequences resembling the BREs found in the Xvent genes, comprising an OBS-like sequence adjacent to an SBE, were recently found in the Xenopus Id3 promoter by genome-wide in silico sequence analysis (Fig. 1B) (9Karaulanov E. Knochel W. Niehrs C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 844-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 29von Bubnoff A. Peiffer D.A. Blitz I.L. Hayata T. Ogata S. Zeng Q. Trunnell M. Cho K.W.Y. Dev. Biol. 2005; 281: 210-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Id3 is transcriptionally regulated by the BMP signaling pathway both in Xenopus embryos and P19 cells (29von Bubnoff A. Peiffer D.A. Blitz I.L. Hayata T. Ogata S. Zeng Q. Trunnell M. Cho K.W.Y. Dev. Biol. 2005; 281: 210-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). 3M. Ku and A. Hata, unpublished observation. Therefore, it is possible that Id3 might be regulated by BMP through the BRE in an OAZ-dependent manner. The Putative OAZ Binding Sequence Is Essential for Activation of Smad6 by BMP4—To test the functional significance of a putative OBS in the Smad6 promoter, we transfected a luciferase reporter construct containing three copies of the wild type Smad6 BRE sequence (-874/-847) from the mSmad6 promoter together with increasing amounts of an OAZ expression plasmid into the mouse embryonic carcinoma cell line P19 (Fig. 2A). P19 cells express all known BMP signaling molecules including OAZ (5Hata A. Seoane J. Lagna G. Montalvo E. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massague J. Cell. 2000; 100: 229-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Overexpression of OAZ weakly augmented the basal activity of the reporter, but the induction by BMP4 stimulation was strongly increased by OAZ in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2A, WT). In agreement with previous observations (13Ishida W. Hamamoto T. Kusanagi K. Yagi K. Kawabata M. Takehara K. Sampath T.K. Kato M. Miyazono K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6075-6079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), the reporter completely lost its responsiveness to BMP4 when both the upstream OBS and the 5′-GC-rich sequence of the BRE were mutated (Fig. 2A, MUT1) (13Ishida W.

Overexpression of OAZ did not alter its activity (Fig. 2A, MUT1). Similar results were obtained when mutations were introduced only in the upstream OBS (Fig. 2A, MUT2). Mutations at the 3′-end of the BRE did not alter its response to BMP4 and exogenous OAZ (Fig. 2A, MUT3) (13Ishida W. Hamamoto T. Kusanagi K. Yagi K. Kawabata M. Takehara K. Sampath T.K. Kato M. Miyazono K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6075-6079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). These results demonstrate that the upstream OBS in the SBE sequence is necessary for the BMP-OAZ-mediated activation of Smad6. We did not investigate the potential function of the downstream, inverted OBS; however, our results indicate that it is not sufficient to mediate OAZ or BMP activation of the reporter construct (Fig. 2A, MUT2). Recruitment of OAZ to OBS in Response to BMP4—Recruitment of OAZ to the BRE of the Smad6 promoter was confirmed in vivo by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Soluble chromatin was prepared after formaldehyde treatment of cells treated with BMP4 for 2 h. Antibodies against Smad1, Smad4, and OAZ were used to immunoprecipitate Smad1-, Smad4-, or OAZ-bound genomic DNA fragments. These genomic regions were analyzed by PCR using specific pairs of primers spanning the BRE of Smad6 (Fig. 2B, BRE). The negative control was provided by PCR primers corresponding to a 5′-upstream region of the BRE (-2031/-1853) which is not involved in the BMP-dependent regulation of mSmad6 and has no sequence homology with human Smad6 (Fig. 2B, control). No PCR signal was detected in BRE or control primers samples in the absence of BMP stimulation. However, in BMP4-treated cells, Smad1, Smad4, and OAZ were recruited to the BRE, but not to the 5′-control region (Fig. 2B). DNA fragments immunoprecipitated by nonspecific IgGs and amplified with the BRE primers yielded no signal (Fig. 2B), suggesting that recruitment of Smad1, Smad4, and OAZ to the BRE is specific. These results demonstrate that activation of Smad6 by BMP4 correlates with the recruitment of Smads and OAZ to the BRE. Thus, Smad6 is the first mammalian gene regulated directly by OAZ. OAZ Is Essential for the Activation of the Smad6 Gene in P19 Cells—To test whether OAZ is necessary for Smad6 induction by BMP4 in vivo, we decreased the expression of endogenous OAZ in P19 cells by RNA interference. A synthetic double-stranded siRNA complementary to the OAZ mRNA specifically down-regulated the expression of OAZ, but not of the control proteins Smad1, lamin A, and vimentin (Fig. 2C, left panel). We then measured by RT-PCR the mRNA level of Smad6 before and after BMP stimulation (Fig. 2C, right panel). In P19 cells treated with a control nontargeting siRNA (Fig. 2C, right panel, control), OAZ expression was unchanged, and Smad6 mRNA was strongly induced by BMP4 treatment. In OAZ siRNA-treated cells, OAZ expression was blocked, and Smad6 induction by BMP4 was abolished (Fig. 2C, right panel, OAZ siRNA). This result suggests that OAZ is essential for the activation of Smad6 by BMP4. Extended Duration of BMP Signal in P19 Cells by Down-regulation of OAZ—To assess the effect of OAZ-mediated regulation of Smad6 on the BMP signaling pathway, P19 cells were transiently transfected with control siRNA or OAZ-specific siRNA to down-regulate endogenous expression of OAZ, stimulated with BMP4, and subjected to anti-phospho-Smad1/5/8 Western blot. Cells treated with control siRNA showed a robust increase of phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8 between 30 min and 2 h after BMP treatment. However, the level of phospho-Smad1/5/8 was dramatically reduced after 4 h of treatment (Fig. 2D). The same membrane blotted with anti-Sma"

Here we report the characterization of the proximal promoter of the mouse gene (Col24a1) and its regulation in osteoblastic cells. Using well characterized murine models of osteoblast differentiation, we found that the Col24a1 gene is activated sometime before onset of the late differentiation marker osteocalcin. Additional analyses revealed that Col24a1 produces equal amounts of two alternatively spliced products with different 5′-untranslated sequences that originate from distinct transcriptional start sites. Cell transfection experiments in combination with DNA binding assays demonstrated that Col24a1 promoter activity in ROS17/2.8 osteosarcoma cells is under the control of an upstream cis-acting element, which is shared by both transcripts and is recognized by specific combinations of c-Jun, CREB1, ATF1, and ATF2 dimers. Consistent with these results, overexpression of c-Jun, ATF1, ATF2, or CREB1 in transiently transfected osteoblastic cells stimulated transcription from reporter gene constructs driven by the Col24a1 promoter to different degrees. Moreover, chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments showed that these nuclear factors bind the same upstream sequence of the endogenous Col24a1 gene. Collectively these data provide new information about transcriptional control of collagen fibrillogenesis, in addition to implicating for the first time CREB-AP1 protein complexes in the regulation of collagen gene expression in osteoblasts.

Vertebrate collagens represent a very large superfamily of extracellular proteins that impart specific physical properties to the connective tissue of virtually every organ system (1van der Rest M.

There are more than 42 collagen α-chains that form 27 distinct trimers or types, which in turn give rise to a large variety of specialized macroaggregates. The most abundant and ubiquitous collagen macroaggregates are the highly ordered banded fibrils made of the so-called fibrillar collagens (types I-III, V, and XI) (1van der Rest M. Garrone R.

All members of the fibrillar collagen family share a common structure that consists of a long triple helical domain, which is made of uninterrupted Gly-X-Y triplets and flanked at both ends by noncollagenous propeptides (1van der Rest M.

Unlike the vertebrate counterparts, invertebrate fibrillar collagens display short interruptions in the triple helices and unique structural features in the amino- and carboxyl-terminal propeptides (4Boot-Handford R.

These studies have also demonstrated the importance of heterotypic collagens I/V and II/XI fibrils in skeletal development and integrity. As a result of the Human Genome effort, several new collagens have been recently identified which had escaped prior biochemical detection. Two among them (types XXIV and XXVII) bear the structural characteristics of fibrillar collagens and specifically, of invertebrate fibrillar collagens (10Boot-Handford R.P. Tuckwell D.S. Plumb D.A.

In intramembranous ossification, mesenchymal cells condense and differentiate directly into collagen I-producing osteoblasts. In endochondral bone formation, cells at condensation sites differentiate into chondrocytes that form a cartilage (collagen II-rich) anlagen, which is replaced by a bony (collagen I-rich) matrix and bone marrow following chondrocyte hypertrophy, matrix calcification, and vascular invasion. At the same time, cells around the condensations form the perichondrial layer that gives rise to the osteoblast-forming periosteum and ultimately to cortical bone. Distinct transcriptional codes control osteoblastogenesis and chondrogenesis and thus, assembly of the collagen I-rich bone matrix and the collagen II-rich cartilage matrix (14Karsenty G. Wagner E.F.

By contrast, significantly less is known about the regulation of fibrillar collagen genes in osteoblasts. One of our research interests is the study of the regulation and function of fibrillar collagen genes in normal and diseased conditions. As part of this ongoing effort, the present study was designed to characterize the proximal promoter of the mouse Col24a1 gene using a combination of cell transfection and DNA binding assays. The results of these experiments suggest that Col24a1 is activated during the mid to late phase of osteoblast differentiation mostly through the binding of CREB 2The abbreviations used are: CREB, cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein; AP1, activator protein 1; ATF, activating transcription factor; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; CRE, cyclic AMP-responsive element; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; LUC, luciferase; MCC, mouse primary calvarial osteoblast cells; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; UTR, untranslated region. -AP1 complexes to an upstream sequence, which is shared by two alternative transcription start sites. This study therefore extends our knowledge of the transcriptional regulation of collagen fibrillogenesis, in addition to implicating for the first time CREB-AP1 protein complexes in the expression of a fibrillar collagen gene in osteoblasts. Cell Cultures—Rat osteosarcoma ROS17/2.8 and ROS25 cells, mouse fibroblast NIH-3T3, and mouse primary calvarial osteoblast cells (MCC) were used in this study. ROS17/2.8, ROS25 and NIH-3T3 were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in humidified 5% CO2 and 95% air (33Majeska R.J.

RNA Analyses—Total RNAs from the mouse eye, brain, and whole embryo were purchased from BD Biosciences. Total RNA was isolated from neonatal calvarias and from cultured cells using commercial kits (Stratagene and Invitrogen) according to the manufacturers’ recommendations. Reverse transcriptions were carried out using Omniscript reverse transcriptase (Qiagen GmbH, Germany) with oligo(dT) primer, and the resulting single-stranded cDNA molecules were PCR amplified using primers for Col24a1 (forward primer, 5′-ATGCATTTAGGAGCCTACAG-3′; reverse primer, 5′-TCACGAGAGGTGACTCAATA-3′), Col1a2 (forward primer, 5′-TGGTCCTCTGGGCATCTCAGGC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-GGTGAACCTGCTGTTGCCCTCA-3′), osteocalcin (forward primer, 5′-ATGAGGACCCTCTCTCTGCT-3; reverse primer, 5′-GGAGCTGCTGTGACATCCAT-3′), and Gapdh (forward primer, 5′-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3′). Amplification conditions included a cycle at 94 °C for 2 min followed by 25 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 56 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1.5 min, and a final elongation cycle at 72 °C for 5 min. To determine the transcriptional start sites, the oligonucleotide-capping RACE was performed using the GeneRacer kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Invitrogen) and with amplification primers corresponding to the sequences of exon 3 (5′-TCACGAGAGGTGACTCAAT-3′) and exon 1 (5′-TAGGCTCCTAAATGCAT-3′) of Col24a1. Amplification products were subcloned into the pCR4-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced. Cell Transfection Assays—Col24a1 promoter-luciferase (LUC) reporter gene constructs were derived from clone pBeroBAC RP23-205C6 using PCR amplification. Amplified products were cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI) and sequenced.

DNA-nuclear protein binding was carried out at 25 °C for 30 min in 25 μl of reaction buffer containing 3 μg of poly(dI-dC). DNA-bound protein complexes were separated in a 4.5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in 0.25% TBE buffer. For competition and antibody interference assays, unlabeled probes or antibodies were added to the reaction mixture for 1 h at 4°C before the addition of labeled probe. The anti-CREB1 antibody was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY), and the other antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA).

As a result, we found a 19-amino acid insertion in the noncollagenous amino-terminal sequence of the mouse compared with the human chain (see GenBank™ accession numbers AY244357 and DQ157748). These experiments were also instrumental in identifying the foremost exon of Col24a1 as consisting of a 5′-untranslated region (UTR) of undetermined length and a coding segment corresponding to the first 94 amino acid residues of the α-chain. The oligonucleotide-capping RACE approach was therefore employed to determine the Col24a1 start site of transcription and implicitly, the 5′-boundary of exon 1. As the source of template for the reaction, we utilized RNA purified from the eye and bone in which accumulation of Col24a1 transcripts has been found to be the highest (11Koch M. Laub F. Zhou P.

Sequencing of nearly 40 independent cDNA clones from each set of RNA samples revealed the presence of two different 5′-UTRs that upon subsequent analysis of genomic clones, were accounted for by a combination of alternative splicing and transcriptional start sites. To be precise, half of the cDNA clones contained a 353-nucleotide long 5′-UTR that is continuous with the genomic sequence of the exon originally identified as the first of exon of the human gene and which was now renamed exon 1a (Fig. 1A) (11Koch M. Laub F. Zhou P. Hahn R.A. Tanaka S. Burgeson R.E. Gerecke D.R. Ramirez F. Gordon M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43236-43244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The other half of the cDNA clones instead contained the 87 nucleotides immediately upstream of the ATG codon, in addition to an 80-nucleotide long 5′-UTR corresponding to an upstream exon (named exon 1b) that is separated from exon 1a by a 152-bp intervening sequence (Fig. 1A). Both transcripts 1a and 1b are spliced correctly into exon 2, leaving the open reading frame unaffected, and consequently, they are predicted to translate into identical α1(XXIV) chains (Fig. 1A). In summary, Col24a1 contains two alternative start sites of transcription, thereby identified as –1 (exon 1a) and +232 (exon 1b), two alternatively spliced transcripts with different 5′-UTRs, the shortest of which (transcript 1b) splices into nucleotide +509 of exon 1a, and the same start site of translation, located at nucleotide +586 (Fig. 1A). The functional significance of Col24a1 alternative promoters and 5′-UTR heterogeneity was not addressed in the present study. Comparison of the 5′-end sequences of the COL24A1 and Col24a1 genes revealed three segments of high homology which span from nucleotides –100 to +133, from +198 to +256, and from +470 to +632 (Fig. 1A). Collagen XXIV has been estimated to represent about 4% of the amount of collagen I in bone, thus slightly less than collagen V, the regulator of collagen I fibrillogenesis (11Koch M. Laub F. Zhou P. Hahn R.A. Tanaka S. Burgeson R.E. Gerecke D.R. Ramirez F. Gordon M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43236-43244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The estimate was based on gene expression analyses that in addition documented coexpression of collagens I and XXIV genes at ossification centers in the mouse embryo (11Koch M. Laub F. Zhou P.

Osteoblasts were therefore chosen as the experimental system in which to study the transcriptional regulation of Col24a1. Reverse transcription-PCR amplifications were used to assess the levels of Col24a1 expression in ROS17/2.8 and ROS25 osteosarcoma cell lines, which represent late and early stages of osteoblast differentiation, respectively (33Majeska R.J. Rodan G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 3362-3365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As positive and negative controls, PCR amplifications were also performed with RNAs purified from MCC and NIH-3T3 fibroblasts. Osteoblast-specific genes included Col1a2 (early osteoblast differentiation marker) and osteocalcin (late osteoblast differentiation marker), whereas the ubiquitous GAPDH gene served as the normalizing control. The results of these experiments suggested that the onset of Col24a1 expression occurs sometime after Col2a1 and prior to osteocalcin gene activation (Fig. 1B). Implicitly, they also identified ROS17/2.8 cells as the most suitable model in which to study the anatomy of the minimal Col24a1 promoter. A Short Upstream Sequence Promotes Col24a1 Transcription in Osteoblasts—Cell transfection experiments were initially employed to delineate the shortest promoter sequence of Col24a1 capable of directing transcription in ROS17/2.8 cells. To this end, we engineered two distinct sets of LUC reporter gene constructs representative of the alternative promoters of Col24a1. The first set of Col24a1 promoter-LUC constructs shared the same 3′-end at position + 509 and included both start sites of transcription, whereas the 3′-ends of the second set of Col24a1 promoter-LUC constructs was located at +80 and excluded the start site of transcript 1b (Fig. 2A). Both sets of promoter-LUC constructs included progressive 5′-deletions of the upstream Col24a1 sequence (Fig. 2A). Irrespective of the 3′-end of the promoter-LUC construct, cell transfection assays assigned maximal transcriptional activity to the region between nucleotides –144 and +80 (Fig. 2B). This promoter segment contains one of the three homology sequences of the COL24A1 and Col24a1 genes (Fig. 1A). Next, an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) was employed to identify potential DNA-nuclear protein interactions within the –144 to +81 segment of the Col24a1 promoter. To this end, four overlapping probes (p1–p4) spanning from nucleotide –163 to nucleotide +116 were each incubated with ROS17/2.8 nuclear extracts (Fig. 3A). Specific band shifts were only obtained with overlapping probes p2 and p3, which cover together the sequence between nucleotides –98 and +51 (Fig. 3A). To be precise, p2 yielded four retarded bands (b1–b4) of which p3 appeared to migrate as band b2 of probe p3 (Fig. 3A). In support of this postulate, band b2 disappeared from the p2 EMSA pattern when competed with a molar excess of unlabeled probe p3; conversely, formation of the p3 retarded band was eliminated by competition with a molar excess of the p2 sequence (Fig. 3B). Taken together, these results mapped the b1, b3, and b4 binding sites between nucleotides –98 and –33 and the binding site of b2 between nucleotides –33 and –15 (Fig. 4).FIGURE 4Functional contribution of the b1,3,4 and b2 binding sites to minimal promoter activity.

This confluence-dependent expression of HOXA1 was abrogated by incubation of cells with EGTA to produce loss of intercellular contact and rescued by extracellular addition of Ca2+. Increased HOXA1 expression at full confluence was prevented by an E-cadherin function-blocking antibody and attachment of non-confluent cells to a substrate by homophilic ligation of E-cadherin increased HOXA1 expression. E-cadherin-directed signaling increased HOXA1 expression through Rac1. Increased HOXA1 expression consequent to E-cadherin-activated signaling decreased apoptotic cell death and was required for E-cadherin-dependent anchorage-independent proliferation of human mammary carcinoma cells.

The growth and differentiation of different cell populations during development are achieved by the coordinated action of complex genetic programs. Alteration in such regulatory pathways results in oncogenic transformation and development of neoplastic lesions.

They exert genetic control by activating or repressing the localized expression of downstream effector genes. The effector genes of HOX genes include signaling molecules and transcription factors such as sonic hedgehog (3Briscoe J. Sussel L. Serup P. Hartigan-O'Connor D. Jessell T.M. Rubenstein J.L. Ericson J. Nature. 1999; 398: 622-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar), fibroblast growth factors (4Irving C. Mason I. Development. 2000; 127: 177-186PubMed Google Scholar), bone morphogenetic proteins (5Boersma C.J. Bloemen M. Hendriks J.M. van Berkel E.A. Olijve W. van Zoelen E.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. Res.

HOX genes possess a homeobox, which is a 183-bp DNA sequence that encodes a 61-amino acid sequence termed as the homeodomain usually situated at the terminal or subterminal position of the corresponding homeoprotein (7McGinnis W. Krumlauf R. Cell. 1992; 68: 283-302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2198) Google Scholar). All HOX genes bind DNA via this homeodomain, which is a helix-turn-helix DNA binding domain, and many of them have indistinguishable in vitro DNA recognition properties. In humans, there are 39 HOX genes present in four paralogous gene clusters named as the HOX-A, HOX-B, HOX-C, and HOX-D, which had been suggested to have resulted by duplication during the course of evolution. The HOX genes are arranged in a linear order and are shown to be responsible for patterning the body by control of cell identity, cell growth, cell differentiation (8Magli M.C. Barba P. Celetti A.

Biochem. 1998; 69: 377-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Recently altered expression of HOX genes have also been linked to a variety of human cancers, including those of kidney (including Wilms' tumor), colon, prostate, skin, and small-cell lung carcinoma (10Grier D.G. J. Pathol. 2005; 205: 154-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 11Maroulakou I.G. Spyropoulos D.D. Anticancer Res. 2003; 23: 2101-2110PubMed Google Scholar, 12Chen H. Sukumar S.

Neoplasia. 2003; 8: 159-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar).In the mammary gland HOX genes are expressed in a distinct pattern during development. For example HOXC6 is expressed during puberty and at maturity but is not expressed during pregnancy due to its regulation by steroid hormones (14Friedmann Y. Daniel C.A. Strickland P. Daniel C.W. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5981-5985PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been demonstrated that the expression level of certain HOX genes such as HOXA5 and HOXC6 are repressed in mammary adenocarcinoma (13Chen H. Sukumar S. J. Mammary Gland Biol. Neoplasia. 2003; 8: 159-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). HOXA5 has been demonstrated to stimulate mammary carcinoma cell apoptosis by both p53-dependent and -independent mechanisms (13Chen H. Sukumar S. J. Mammary Gland Biol. Neoplasia. 2003; 8: 159-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 16Chen H. Chung S. Sukumar S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 924-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In contrast, HOXA1 is not expressed in the differentiated mammary gland but is up-regulated in neoplastic lesions of the human mammary gland (17Chariot A. Moreau L. Senterre G. Sobel M.E. Castronovo V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 713-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 18Chariot A. Castronovo V. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Recently, we have demonstrated that autocrine human growth hormone, a major regulator of human mammary gland development and a potential human mammary epithelial oncogene (19Zhu T. Emerald B.S. Zhang X. Lee K.O. Gluckman P.D. Mertani H.C. Lobie P.E. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 317-324PubMed Google Scholar), up-regulated HOXA1 in the human mammary epithelial cell (20Mertani H.C. Zhu T. Goh E.L.

Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7580-7590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). HOXA1 stimulates the transcriptional activation of a number of pro-oncogenic molecules, including cyclinD1 and Bcl-2, thereby permitting increased proliferation and survival of human mammary carcinoma cells (21Zhang X. Zhu T. Chen Y. Mertani H.C. Lee K.O. Lobie P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7580-7590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). HOXA1 also governs the transcriptional program stimulated by autocrine human growth hormone required for autocrine human growth hormone-stimulated oncogenic transformation of human mammary epithelial cells, including transcriptional up-regulation of c-Myc, cyclin D1, and Bcl-2 (19Zhu T. Emerald B.S. Zhang X. Lee K.O. Gluckman P.D. Mertani H.C. Lobie P.E. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 317-324PubMed Google Scholar). Forced expression of HOXA1 is sufficient to oncogenically transform immortalized human mammary epithelial cells, with consequent soft agar colony formation and aggressive in vivo tumor formation (21Zhang X. Zhu T. Chen Y. Mertani H.C. Lee K.O. Lobie P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7580-7590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar).Survival of normal epithelial cells depends on signals generated by the interaction of cells with the basement membrane, and in the absence of anchorage the cells exhibit the molecular characteristics of apoptosis and are deleted (22Ruoslahti E. Reed J.C. Cell. 1994; 77: 477-478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar, 23Frisch S.M. Ruoslahti E. Curr Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 701-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar). This form of apoptosis is called anoikis, and it is believed to preclude epithelial cells from survival, reattachment, and proliferation outside the appropriate tissue context (24Frisch S.M. Francis H.J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (2749) Google Scholar, 25Meredith Jr., J.E. Winitz S. Lewis J.M. Hess S. Ren X.D. Renshaw M.W. Schwartz M.A. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 207-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In contrast, many carcinoma cells are anoikis-resistant and survive in the absence of contact with the basement membrane, inside three-dimensional tumor nests and in the absence of matrix attachment during metastasis (25Meredith Jr., J.E. Winitz S. Lewis J.M. Hess S. Ren X.D. Renshaw M.W. Schwartz M.A. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 207-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Some of the mechanisms that confer anoikis resistance on epithelial cells during tumor progression have been described (25Meredith Jr., J.E. Winitz S. Lewis J.M. Hess S. Ren X.D. Renshaw M.W. Schwartz M.A. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 207-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 26Frisch S.M. Screaton R.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar). Previous work has implicated E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion in protecting specific epithelium-derived cells from anoikis (27Kantak S.S. Kramer R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16953-16961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 28Shen X. Kramer R.H. Am. J. Pathol. 2004; 165: 1315-1329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In addition to mediation of intercellular adhesion, E-cadherin also stimulates intracellular signaling (29Yap A.S. Kovacs E.M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) and has been demonstrated to potentiate cell survival. It has been demonstrated that E-cadherin suppresses apoptosis of immortalized granulosa cells (30Peluso J.J. Pappalardo A. Fernandez G. Biol. Reprod. 2001; 64: 1183-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and that experimental truncation of E-cadherin results in potentiation of apoptotic cell death in prostate epithelial cells (31Rios-Doria J. Day M.L. Prostate. 2005; 63: 259-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). N-cadherin can also mediate cell survival in several cell types (32Li G. Satyamoorthy K. Herlyn M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3819-3825PubMed Google Scholar, 33Peluso J.J. Pappalardo A. Trolice M.P. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 1196-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 34Tran N.L. Adams D.G. Vaillancourt R.R. Heimark R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32905-32914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In addition, E-cadherin has been demonstrated to stimulate anchorage-independent growth and survival of squamous carcinoma cells (27Kantak S.S. Kramer R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16953-16961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar).During the course of our studies on the regulation of HOXA1 in human mammary carcinoma cells (21Zhang X. Zhu T. Chen Y. Mertani H.C. Lee K.O. Lobie P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7580-7590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), we noted that the expression and consequent transcriptional activity of HOXA1 was confluence-dependent, suggestive of possible E-cadherin-dependent regulation of HOXA1. Herein, we demonstrate that E-cadherin-directed signaling through Rac1 up-regulates HOXA1 in human mammary carcinoma cells. Increased HOXA1 expression stimulated by E-cadherin-activated signaling decreased apoptotic cell death and allowed anchorage-independent proliferation in human mammary carcinoma cells. Thus, E-cadherin-mediated intercellular adhesion utilizes HOXA1 to suppress apoptosis and promote anchorage-independent growth.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—The MCF-7 and MCF-10A cell lines were obtained from the ATCC. MCF-7 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm l-glutamine. MCF-10A cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% horse serum (Invitrogen) plus 2 mm glutamine, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 0.25 μg/ml ampicillin B, 100 ng/ml cholera toxin, 20 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), 0.5 μg/ml hydrocortisone (Calbiochem), and 10 μg/ml insulin. The MCF-7 cell line was stably transfected with a HOXA1 expression plasmid (pSG5-HOXA1) and pcDNA3 empty vector in a ratio of 5:1 by use of Effectene transfection reagent obtained from Qiagen as described previously (21Zhang X. Zhu T. Chen Y. Mertani H.C. Lee K.O. Lobie P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7580-7590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). pSG5-HOXA1 is the generous gift of Dr. Vincenzo Zappavigna (Milano, Italy). Positive transfectants were selected in 800 μg/ml G418 (Calbiochem). Individual colonies were selected to determine the HOXA1 expression level. The cell line MCF7-HOXA1 was established by pooling five individual colonies exhibiting forced expression of HOXA1. Likewise, MCF-7 cells, stably transfected with vector, were also established (MCF7-VECTOR) as control.Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—Extraction of total RNA and RT-PCR were performed as described previously (20Mertani H.C.

To compare the PCR products semi-quantitatively, 15-40 cycles of PCR (annealing temperature, 55 °C) were performed to determine the linearity of the PCR amplification, and the amplified β-actin cDNA served as an internal control for cDNA quantity and quality. All RNA samples were treated with DNase I to avoid genomic DNA contamination.The sequences of the oligonucleotide primers used for RT-PCR are as follows: HOXA1 (sense), 5′-GGGAAAGTTGGAGAGTACGGC-3′; HOXA1 (antisense), 5′-CCTCAGTGGGAGGTAGTCAG-3′; β-actin (sense), 5′-ATGATATCGCCGCGCTCG-3′; and β-actin (antisense), 5′-CGCTCGGTGAGGATCTTCA-3′.Luciferase Reporter Assay for EphA2-r42B and Bcl-2 Promoter Constructs—Cells were cultured in six-well plates. Transient transfection was performed by use of Effectene as described (20Mertani H.C. Zhu T. Goh E.L. Lee K.O. Morel G. Lobie P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21464-21475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.2 μg of the respective luciferase constructs (and other constructs as appropriate) were transfected per well in serum-free RPMI medium for 12 h before the medium was changed to fresh serum-free RPMI. 0.2 μg of β-galactosidase reporter vector was co-transfected as the control for transfection efficiency. After a further 24 h, cells were washed with PBS, and luciferase assays were performed as described previously (21Zhang X. Zhu T. Chen Y. Mertani H.C. Lee K.O. Lobie P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7580-7590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase activity was measured in the assay buffer (100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.3, 1 mm MgCl2, 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.665 mg/ml o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside). Results were normalized to the level of β-galactosidase activity and protein concentration in the samples. EphA2-r42B-LUC was a generous gift of Dr. Jin Chen (Nashville, TN). The Bcl-2 P1 promoter reporter plasmid was a kind gift of Dr. John Kurland (Houston, TX).Real-time PCR—Total RNA was isolated as described above, and the first strand cDNA synthesis with oligo(dT) primers was performed using a Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems, Newark, NJ) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Real-time PCR for HOXA1 (Inventoried Assay ID Hs00171793-m1, Applied Biosystems) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Inventoried Assay ID Hs99999905-m1, Applied Biosystems) were performed in triplicate on 1.00 μg of cDNA using Taq Man PCR Master Mix in a reaction volume of 25 μl. PCR amplification and detection was performed using an ABI Prism 7900 HT (Applied Biosystems). Exponential amplification of all PCR reactions ranged from 1.95 to 2.00 across seven serial log dilutions of template. Amplification of a single product for each primer set was confirmed by dissociation curve analysis, and all products were visualized after electrophoresis on 2% agarose gel. The comparative Ct method for relative quantification (2-ΔΔCt) was used to quantitative gene expression according to the recommendations of Applied Biosystems (7900 HT Real-Time fast and SDS enterprise and data base user guide). Expression of target genes was normalized to the level of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and the -fold difference was calculated.Western Blot Analysis—Cells were treated and harvested as described. Whole cell lysates were prepared according to the protocol described (20Mertani H.C. Zhu T. Goh E.L. Lee K.O. Morel G. Lobie P.E. J. Biol.

Proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide (12%) gel electrophoresis, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and blotted with the antibodies as indicated. The anti-β-actin, anti-HOXA1, anti-E-cadherin, anti-α-catenin, anti-β-catenin, and anti-γ-catenin antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); immunolabeling was visualized by using an ECL detection kit from Amersham Biosciences according to the manufacturer's instruction.Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy—MCF-7 and MCF10-A cells were grown in cavity slides to the appropriate confluence (60 or 100%), fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS, pH 7.4, washed, and blocked with BBX (PBS 0.1% Triton, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 250 mm NaCl). The cells were incubated with anti-HOXA1 and anti-E-cadherin antibodies overnight at 4 °C. They were again washed and blocked with BBX and incubated with the anti-Goat-TRITC and anti mouse-Alexa488 secondary antibodies in BBX and mounted. Cells were cultured to the appropriate confluence (60 or 100%) and treated with the E-cadherin function-blocking antibody DECMA-1 or control IgG and processed as above. Labeled cells were visualized with a Carl Zeiss 510 Meta confocal laser system. Images were converted to the tagged-information-file format and processed with Adobe Photoshop.5′-Bromo-2′-deoxyuridine Incorporation Assay—Mitogenesis was directly assayed by measuring the incorporation of BrdUrd as described (20Mertani H.C.

For incorporation of BrdUrd, subconfluent cells were pulse-labeled with 20 mm BrdUrd for 30 min, washed twice with PBS, and fixed in cold 70% ethanol for 30 min. BrdUrd detection was performed by use of the BrdUrd staining kit from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (San Francisco, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A total population of over three times 300 cells was analyzed in several arbitrarily chosen microscopic fields to determine the BrdUrd labeling index (percentage of cells synthesizing DNA).Measurement of Apoptosis—Apoptotic cell death was measured by fluorescent microscopic analysis of cell DNA-staining patterns with Hoechst 33258 from Sigma Co. (20Mertani H.C. Zhu T. Goh E.L. Lee K.O. Morel G. Lobie P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21464-21475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 21Zhang X. Zhu T. Chen Y.

Cells were trypsinized with 0.5% trypsin and washed twice with serum-free medium. The cells were then seeded to glass coverslips in six-well plates and incubated in serum-free medium with or without E-cadherin expression plasmid, HOXA1 expression plasmid, DECMA-1, and HOXA1 RNA interference (19Zhu T. Emerald B.S. Zhang X. Lee K.O. Gluckman P.D. Mertani H.C. Lobie P.E. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 317-324PubMed Google Scholar) as indicated. After a culture period of 24 h, the cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (pH 7.4) and stained with the karyophilic dye Hoechst 33258 (20 μg/ml) for 10 min at room temperature. Following washing with PBS, nuclear morphology was examined under a UV-visible fluorescence microscope (Zeiss Axioplan). Apoptotic cells were distinguished from viable cells by their nuclear morphology characterized by nuclear condensation and fragmentation as well as the higher intensity of the blue fluorescence of the nuclei. For statistical analysis, three times 300 cells were counted in eight random microscopic fields at ×400 magnification.Determination of Anchorage-independent Growth of Cells—Cells were trypsinized and dispensed as either single cells (non-aggregated) or in aggregated clumps by differential cycles of mechanical aspiration. Cells (5 × 104) in suspension culture were grown in 30-mm plastic bacteriological dishes (Sterilin, Teddington, UK). On the days indicated, cells were harvested and counted as for monolayers (21Zhang X. Zhu T. Chen Y. Mertani H.C. Lee K.O. Lobie P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7580-7590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar).Calcium Switch—For calcium switch experiments, MCF-7 cells were seeded into dishes, cultured for 24 h, and then the cells were serum-starved. After 24-h incubation, E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell contacts were disrupted by treatment with 4 mm EGTA at 37 °C for 30 min. Thereafter, intercellular contacts were allowed to reform in the presence of normal Ca2+ containing medium (CaCl2 ∼ 1.8 mm) at 37°C for various time points with or without E-cadherin function-blocking antibodies (DECMA clone-1 at 1:100 dilution, Sigma-Aldrich).E-cadherin Cell Adhesion Assays (hE/Fc Experiments)—The recombinant protein (hE/Fc) consisting of the complete ectodomain of human E-cadherin fused to the Fc region of IgG was produced as described (35Pujuguet P. Del Maestro L. Gautreau A. Louvard D. Arpin M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2181-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Substrata adsorbed with hE/Fc supported E-cadherin-specific adhesion and contact formation (36Kovacs E.M. Goodwin M. Ali R.G. Paterson A.D. Yap A.S. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 379-382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Using this model, E-cadherin engagement is induced without cell-cell contact (36Kovacs E.M. Goodwin M. Ali R.G. Paterson A.D. Yap A.S. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 379-382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). For hE/Fc experiments, bacterial 10-cm dishes (precoated with nitrocellulose) were coated with hE/Fc (50 μg/ml) for 2 h at room temperature. Blocking of nonspecific binding sites was performed with 1% bovine serum albumin in Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) supplemented with 5 mm CaCl2 for 1 h and 30 min at room temperature. Dishes were washed five times before addition of cells. MCF-7 cells were washed once with 10 mm EDTA in HBSS/CaCl2 for 1 min and directly trypsinized in 0.01% crystalline trypsin in HBSS/CaCl2 for 15 min at 37 °C. MCF-7 cells were then washed with HBSS/CaCl2 and resuspended in HBSS/CaCl2 supplemented with 0.05% fetal calf serum, seeded onto the 10-cm dishes and incubated at 37 °C. Thirty minutes after seeding, non-adhered cells were carefully removed by exchange of media. Five hours after seeding the cells onto the dishes, RNA and protein extraction were performed.Statistics—All experiments were repeated at least three to five times. All numerical data are expressed as mean ± S.D. Data were analyzed using the two-tailed t test or analysis of variance.RESULTSHOXA1 mRNA, Protein, and Transcriptional Activity Are Increased in Mammary Carcinoma Cells at Full Confluence—The level of HOXA1 mRNA in mammary carcinoma cells MCF-7 at varying degrees of confluence and at full confluence was first examined by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. Fig. 1A demonstrated an amplified fragment of the predicted size (359 bp) appropriate for HOXA1 mRNA in MCF-7 cells (21Zhang X. Zhu T. Chen Y. Mertani H.C. Lee K.O. Lobie P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7580-7590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). HOXA1 mRNA was increased in MCF-7 cells at full confluence (100% confluence) in comparison to subconfluent conditions (20%, 40%, 60%, and 80% confluences). The level of β-actin mRNA did not differ in MCF-7 cells at different degrees of confluency and was used as a control for RNA quality (Fig. 1A). To determine if the increased HOXA1 mRNA observed in MCF-7 cells at full confluence resulted in increased HOXA1 protein, we examined the level of HOXA1 protein in MCF-7 cells at the corresponding varying degrees of confluence by Western blot analysis. Both the 33-kDa and the 35-kDa forms of HOXA1 were detectable as described previously (21Zhang X. Zhu T. Chen Y. Mertani H.C. Lee K.O. Lobie P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7580-7590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B) with increased HOXA1 protein observed at 100% confluence. We next determined if HOXA1-mediated transcription was consequently increased in MCF-7 cells at full confluence, by luciferase reporter activity from the EphA2-r42B enhancer, which contains four HOX-PBX binding sites (37Chen J. Ruley H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24670-24675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). MCF-7 cells at full confluence (100% confluence) exhibited increased luciferase activity from the EphA2-r42B enhancer compared with MCF-7 cells at subconfluence (20%, 40%, 60%, and 80% confluences) (Fig. 1C), indicative of increased HOXA1 transcriptional activity.To verify the effect of confluence on HOXA1 mRNA expression in mammary epithelial derived cell lines we utilized quantitative real-time PCR analysis to determine the expression of HOXA1 at subconfluence (60%) and confluence (100%) in both MCF-7 cells and a mammary epithelial (MCF-10A) cell line. In this instance, the expression of HOXA1 was normalized to the expression of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The relative expression of HOXA1 mRNA was increased 19- and 7-fold in MCF-7 and MCF-10A cells, respectively, at confluence compared with subconfluence (Fig. 1D). Thus, confluent MCF-7 cells exhibited elevated HOXA1-mediated transcriptional activity compared with subconfluent cultures.The Increase in HOXA1 Expression in Mammary Carcinoma Cells at Full Confluence Is Cell-Cell Adhesion-dependent—The elevation in HOXA1 expression in confluent cultures of MCF-7 cells prompted us to examine the role of E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell attachment in the increase in HOXA1 expression that occurs at confluence. We first used EGTA addition to media to chelate Ca2+, thereby disrupting E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell contact (38Volberg T. Geiger B. Kartenbeck J. Franke W.W. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1832-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A, use of EGTA completely abrogated the increased expression of HOXA1 mRNA observed at full confluence in MCF-7 cells. Similarly, analysis of HOXA1 transcriptional activity by use of the EphA2-r42B enhancer demonstrated abrog"

Although the molecular details underlying Ca2+-dependent inactivation have been characterized, little is known about how this process might be modulated in excitable cells. Based on previous findings that Ca2+-dependent inactivation of Cav2.1 (P/Q-type) Ca2+ channels is suppressed by strong cytoplasmic Ca2+ buffering, we investigated how factors that regulate cellular Ca2+ levels affect inactivation of Cav2.1 Ca2+ currents in transfected 293T cells. We found that inactivation of Cav2.1 Ca2+ currents increased exponentially with current amplitude with low intracellular concentrations of the slow buffer EGTA (0.5 mm), but not with high concentrations of the fast Ca2+ buffer BAPTA (10 mm). However, when the concentration of BAPTA was reduced to 0.5 mm, inactivation of Ca2+ currents was significantly greater than with an equivalent concentration of EGTA, indicating the importance of buffer kinetics in modulating Ca2+-dependent inactivation of Cav2.1. Cotransfection of Cav2.1 with the EF-hand Ca2+-binding proteins, parvalbumin and calbindin, significantly altered the relationship between Ca2+ current amplitude and inactivation in ways that were unexpected from behavior as passive Ca2+ buffers. We conclude that Ca2+-dependent inactivation of Cav2.1 depends on a subplasmalemmal Ca2+ microdomain that is affected by the amplitude of the Ca2+ current and differentially modulated by distinct Ca2+ buffers.

Fidelity of Ca2+ signaling by Cav2.1 requires fine control of voltage-gated Ca2+ entry, in part by the Ca2+ ions that permeate the channel. Self-regulation of Cav2.1 channels by Ca2+ is manifest as an initial increase (facilitation) and gradual decrease (inactivation) in Ca2+ current amplitude during high frequency stimuli (6Forsythe I.D.

A fundamental distinction between CDF and CDI is their sensitivity to cytoplasmic Ca2+ buffering. The blockade of CDI, but not CDF, by high concentrations of the Ca2+ chelators EGTA and BAPTA (8Lee A. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 6830-6838Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Soong T.W. DeMaria C.D. Alvania R.S. Zweifel L.S. Liang M.C. Mittman S. Agnew W.S. Yue D.T. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 10142-10152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggests that the extent to which Cav2.1 channels undergo CDI may largely be influenced by factors that regulate intracellular Ca2+ concentrations. Such factors include parvalbumin (PV) and calbindin (CB), which are EF-hand Ca2+-binding proteins that alter the amplitude and time course of Ca2+ signals in some nerve and muscle cells (13Schmidt H. Stiefel K.M. Racay P. Schwaller B. Eilers J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 551: 13-32Crossref Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 14Li Z. Decavel C. Hatton G.I. J. Physiol.

Schwaller B. Neher E. J. Physiol. 2000; 525: 419-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Unlike calmodulin, which directly interacts with and confers Ca2+-dependent regulation to numerous effectors (18Chin D. Means A.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 322-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar), PV and CB were generally thought to act as passive Ca2+ buffers, which help protect cells from Ca2+ overloads. However, by modifying the spatial and temporal aspects of intracellular Ca2+ elevations, PV and CB can influence Ca2+ signals that modulate the activity of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (19John L.M. Mosquera-Caro M. Camacho P. Lechleiter J.D. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 535: 3-16Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 20Dargan S.L. Schwaller B. Parker I. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2004; 556: 447-461Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Similarly, PV and CB might physiologically regulate Ca2+-dependent modulation of Cav2.1, as PV and CB are concentrated in subsets of neurons, such as cerebellar Purkinje neurons, where Cav2.1 channels are also highly expressed (21Schwaller B. Meyer M. Schiffmann S. Cerebellum. 2002; 1: 241-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 22Kadowaki K. McGowan E. Mock G. Chandler S. Emson P.C. Neurosci.

Alseikhan B.A. Chang S.Y. Soong T.W. Yue D.T. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 8282-8294Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Previous studies implicate a role for PV and CB in modulating CDI of L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels in neurons (25Nagerl U.V. Mody I. Jeub M. Lie A.A. Elger C.E. Beck H. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 1831-1836Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Meuth S.G. Kanyshkova T. Landgraf P. Pape H.-C. Budde T. Pflugers Archiv. 2005; 450: 111-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), although whether these proteins also affect Cav2.1 (P/Q-type) channels is not known. In this study, we compared the effects of Ca2+ buffers (EGTA and BAPTA) and Ca2+-buffering proteins (PV and CB) on CDI of Cav2.1 in transfected 293T cells. Our analyses indicate that inactivation of Cav2.1 Ca2+ currents varies significantly with current amplitude and is more sensitive to Ca2+ buffering by EGTA than BAPTA. PV and CB do not simply replicate the effects of EGTA and BAPTA, but differentially altered the current dependence of CDI. These findings reveal the importance of cellular Ca2+-buffering mechanisms in the negative feedback regulation of Cav2.1 channels by Ca2+, which may further diversify the properties of these channels in different neuronal cell types (27Llinas R. Sugimori M. Hillman D.E. Cherksey B. Trends Neurosci. 1992; 15: 351-355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). cDNA Expression Constructs—Cav2.1 subunits used in electrophysiological experiments were α12.1 (rbA isoform), β2a, and α2δ (28Stea A.

Parvalbumin was subcloned into the HindIII/BamHI sites of pcDNA3.1+, and calbindin was subcloned into the BamHI/XhoI sites of pcDNA3.1-topo. The PVCDEF mutant containing amino acid substitutions D51A, E62V, D90A, and E101V was based on that described by Pauls et al. (31Pauls T.L. Durussel I. Berchtold M.W. Cox J.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10393-10400Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and generated by multiple rounds of QuikChange mutagenesis and subcloning into pcDNA3.1+. The identity of all cDNA constructs was confirmed by sequencing prior to use in electrophysiological experiments. Cell Culture and Transfection—293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C under 5% CO2. Cells plated in 35-mm tissue culture dishes were grown to 65–80% confluency and transfected with Gene-PORTER transfection reagent (Gene Therapy Systems Inc., San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol with a 1:1 molar ratio of cDNAs for Ca2+ channel subunits (total of 5 μg) and 0.7 μg of a CD8 expression plasmid for identification of transfected cells. Parvalbumin and calbindin cDNAs were transfected at a 1:1 molar ratio with Ca2+ channel subunits. Western Blots—293T cells, plated and transfected as for electrophysiological experiments, were homogenized in ice-cold lysis buffer (25 mm Tris, pH. 7.4), 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 0.1% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% Triton X-100) and stored at –20 °C until use. Cell lysates (50 μg) were electrophoresed on denaturing 4–20% Tris-glycine gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane that was blocked in 3% milk/TBS and incubated with antibodies against PV (1:1000, Chemicon International, Temecala, CA), or CB (1:1000, Chemicon International). Chemiluminescent detection was achieved with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:2000, Amersham Biosciences) and ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Electrophysiological Recordings—At least 48 h after transfection, 293T cells were incubated with CD8 antibody-coated microspheres (Dynal, Oslo, Norway) for identification of transfected cells. Ca2+ or Ba2+ currents were recorded in whole cell patch clamp recordings with a HEKA EPC-9 patch-clamp amplifier driven by PULSE software (HEKA Electronics, Lambrecht/Pfalz, Germany). Leak and capacitive transients were subtracted using a P/-4 protocol. Extracellular recording solutions contained (in mm): 150 Tris, 1 MgCl2, and 10 CaCl2 or 10 BaCl2. Intracellular recording solutions contained (in mm): 130 N-methyl-d-glucamine, 60 HEPES, 1 MgCl2, 2 Mg-ATP, and EGTA (0.5 mm) or BAPTA (0.5 mm or 10 mm). The pH of extracellular and intracellular recording solutions was adjusted to 7.3 with methanesulfonic acid. Because of shifts in the activation curve of –10 and +10 mV when extracellular Ba2+ or intracellular BAPTA were used, respectively, voltage protocols were adjusted to compensate for this difference as noted. Data Analysis—All data were analyzed using custom written procedures in IGOR Pro software (Wavemetrics, Portland, OR). Averaged data represent the mean ± S.E. Statistical differences in averaged inactivation (Ires/Ipk) between groups was determined by Student’s t test. I-V curves were fit with the function: g(V – E)/{1 + exp[(V – V1/2)/k] + b} where g is the maximum conductance, V is the test potential, E is the apparent reversal potential, V1/2 is the potential of half-activation, k is the slope factor, and b is the baseline. Linear and nonlinear regression and statistical analyses were done with Sigma Plot (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL). Significant deviations of percent inactivation data from regression models were determined by Runs test. Data describing current dependence of ICa inactivation were fit with a nonlinear regression equation, y = axb where y is % inactivation, x is the current amplitude, and a and b are constants. F-tests were used for comparisons of nonlinear regression curves, with statistical significance considered as p < 0.05. Current Dependence of CDI and Sensitivity to EGTA—Ca2+ microdomains near the pore of individual Ca2+ channels may reach micromolar concentrations, but are too short-lived to be significantly buffered by high concentrations of slow Ca2+ buffers such as EGTA or low concentrations of fast Ca2+ buffers such as BAPTA (32Stern M.D. Cell Calcium. 1992; 13: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). For this reason, the blockade of CDI of Cav2.1 by high intracellular concentrations of EGTA and BAPTA (10 mm) implies a requirement for a “global” Ca2+ signal that is supported by multiple open channels (8Lee A. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 6830-6838Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9DeMaria C.D. Soong T.W. Alseikhan B.A. Alvania R.S. Yue D.T.

Neurosci. 2002; 22: 10142-10152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A simple prediction of this model is that CDI should increase to some extent with the amplitude of the whole cell Ca2+ current (ICa). In support of this prediction, human splice variants of α12.1 with poor expression levels in transfected cells, as reflected by low amplitude ICa, exhibited less CDI than channel variants with higher mean current amplitudes (12Soong T.W. DeMaria C.D. Alvania R.S. Zweifel L.S. Liang M.C. Mittman S. Agnew W.S. Yue D.T. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 10142-10152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we also observed a similar relationship between current amplitude and CDI for channels containing the rat brain (rbA) α12.1 variant (Fig. 1). In transfected 293T cells, inactivation of currents carried by Ca2+ (ICa) or Ba2+ (IBa) was measured as Ires/Ipk, which was the amplitude of the current at the end of a 2-s pulse normalized to the peak current amplitude. With minimal Ca2+ buffering of the intracellular recording solution (0.5 mm EGTA), we found that inactivation was significantly greater (smaller Ires/Ipk) for large ICa (>0.4 nA) than for small ICa (<0.4 nA) (p < 0.01; Fig. 1, A and B) and that the increase in ICa inactivation with current amplitude was significantly nonlinear (p < 0.05) (Fig. 1C). Because Ba2+ does not support calmodulin-dependent conformational changes that underlie CDI of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (7Lee A. Wong S.T. Gallagher D. Li B. Storm D.R. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A.

A. 1999; 96: 2435-2438Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), Cav2.1 currents carried by Ba2+ ions did not vary significantly with current amplitude (Fig. 1B). High concentrations (10 mm) of BAPTA in the intracellular recording solution, which block CDI of Cav2.1 (7Lee A. Wong S.T. Gallagher D. Li B. Storm D.R. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Nature. 1999; 399: 155-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar, 8Lee A. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 6830-6838Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), also prevented the current-dependent increase in inactivation (Fig. 1B), such that the relationship between current amplitude and inactivation for ICa+ 10 mm BAPTA and for IBa did not significantly deviate from a straight line (p = 0.83 for ICa+10 BAPTA and p = 0.53 for IBa; Fig. 1C). The positive slope for the current dependence of IBa inactivation (0.02 ± 0.01) could have resulted from Ba2+-dependent effects on inactivation that have been described for L-type Ca2+ channels (37Ferreira G. Yi J. Rios E. Shirokov R. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 449-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). It is not clear why the corresponding relationship for ICa with 10 mm BAPTA exhibited a negative slope (–0.01 ± 0.01), although stimulatory effects of BAPTA on the amplitude of Cav2.1 currents, have been reported in previous studies (38Bodding M. Penner R. Pflugers Arch. 1999; 439: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 39Rousset M. Cens T. Gouin-Charnet A. Scamps F. Charnet P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14619-14630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The difference between inactivation for ICa and IBa, which reflects the magnitude of CDI, was significantly greater for larger currents (∼20%, p < 0.05, Fig. 1, A and B), primarily as a consequence of stronger, current-dependent inactivation of ICa. Our analyses demonstrate that Ca2+ influx and its intracellular accumulation cause nonlinear increases in Cav2.1 inactivation and that current-dependent variations in CDI should be considered when evaluating factors that regulate this process. To evaluate the modulatory potential of Ca2+ buffers on CDI, we compared the effects of BAPTA and EGTA at concentrations (0.5 mm) that are permissive for CDI. Whereas EGTA and BAPTA bind Ca2+ with nearly equal affinity, Ca2+ on- and off-rates for BAPTA are at least 100 times faster than for EGTA (40Tsien R.Y. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 2396-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1701) Google Scholar). Although BAPTA binds Ca2+ faster than EGTA, it will also retain it for shorter periods of time, such that CDI may be more evident with BAPTA than with EGTA. Consistent with this prediction, Ires/Ipk was significantly smaller with BAPTA (0.5 mm) than with the same concentration of EGTA (∼54% for ICa<0.4 nA and ∼60% for ICa>0.4 nA, p < 0.01; Fig. 2A). For ICa>0.4 nA, the rate of inactivation with BAPTA (0.5 mm) was significantly faster than with EGTA (∼36%, Table 1). The effect of BAPTA was evident as an upward shift in the relationship between ICa inactivation and current amplitude, which was significantly different from that with EGTA (p < 0.001, Fig. 2A). Greater inactivation with BAPTA than with EGTA was particularly apparent during repetitive depolarizations (Fig. 2B). With this voltage protocol and low EGTA (0.5 mm), ICa underwent initial facilitation, which is also calmodulin-dependent (8Lee A. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 6830-6838Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), followed by inactivation. However, with BAPTA (0.5 mm), only strong inactivation of ICa was observed, such that ICa was reduced ∼23% more by the end of the train compared with ICa recorded with EGTA (Fig. 2B). These results show that the ability of ICa to generate Ca2+ signals that cause CDI of Cav2.1 is greater in the presence of fast Ca2+ buffers like BAPTA than with slow Ca2+ buffers like EGTA.TABLE 1Effect of Ca2+ buffers on kinetics of inactivation of Cav2.1 Ca2+ currentIcaBuffersnτ(s)p value (relative to Cav2.1 + 0.5 EGTA)ICa<0.4 nACav2.1 + 0.5 EGTA121.237 ± 0.107-Cav2.1 + 0.5 BAPTA60.956 ± 0.0880.11Cav2.1 + 10 BAPTA181.532 ± 0.084<0.05Cav2.1 + PV91.690 ± 0.177<0.05Cav2.1 + CB171.884 ± 0.141<0.01ICa>0.4 nACav2.1 + 0.5 EGTA71.123 ± 0.098-Cav2.1 + 0.5 BAPTA50.721 ± 0.064<0.05Cav2.1 + 10 BAPTA131.771 ± 0.192<0.05Cav2.1 + PV50.747 ± 0.104<0.05Cav2.1 + CBaICa>0.4 nA for cells cotransfected with Cav2.1 + CB represents ICa greater than 0.4 nA but less than 0.8 nA.111.109 ± 0.0450.89a ICa>0.4 nA for cells cotransfected with Cav2.1 + CB represents ICa greater than 0.4 nA but less than 0.8 nA. Open table in a new tab Effects of PV on CDI of Cav2.1—To determine if Ca2+-buffering proteins might similarly regulate inactivation of Cav2.1 Ca2+ currents, we investigated the effect of coexpressing Cav2.1 with parvalbumin (PV, Fig. 3). We chose PV since its Ca2+ binding properties and effects on Ca2+ signals are well characterized (21Schwaller B. Meyer M. Schiffmann S. Cerebellum. 2002; 1: 241-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). The EF-hands of PV can bind Ca2+ with high affinity and Mg2+ with lower affinity (31Pauls T.L. Durussel I. Berchtold M.W. Cox J.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10393-10400Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 41Haiech J. Derancourt J. Pechere J.F. Demaille J.G. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2752-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Under resting conditions, the concentration of Mg2+ in cells is generally far greater than that for Ca2+ (42Li-Smerin Y. Levitan E.S. Johnson J.W. J. Physiol. 2001; 533: 729-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), so that the rate of Ca2+ binding is slow because of a requirement for Mg2+ to first unbind (43Hou T.T. Johnson J.D. Rall J.A. J. Physiol. 1991; 441: 285-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). As a consequence, PV is considered a slow Ca2+ buffer in cells, with similar Ca2+ binding kinetics as EGTA (21Schwaller B. Meyer M. Schiffmann S. Cerebellum. 2002; 1: 241-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Based on our results with EGTA and BAPTA, we expected that PV, like EGTA, should decrease ICa inactivation. Whereas this was true for ICa<0.4 nA (∼32% increase in Ires/Ipk for PV-transfected cells, p < 0.05; Fig. 3A), PV had the opposite effect for ICa>0.4 nA, causing significantly greater inactivation of ICa than in cells transfected with Cav2.1 alone (∼50% decrease in Ires/Ipk, p < 0.04; Fig. 3A). Kinetic analyses showed that these effects of PV were caused by a slowing and acceleration of the rate of inactivation for small and large amplitude currents, respectively (Table 1). The dual effects of PV on ICa inactivation resulted in a significant deviation in the relationship between ICa inactivation and current amplitude relative to that for Cav2.1 alone (p < 0.005, Fig. 3B). The peak ICa and shape of the I-V curves for cells transfected with Cav2.1 alone or cotransfected with PV were not different for either small or large ICa (Fig. 3C), excluding the possibility that the dual effects of PV on ICa inactivation were caused by alterations in voltage-dependent activation of Cav2.1, or variability in channel expression between groups. Western blots confirmed that PV was highly expressed in cotransfected cells but not in cells transfected with Cav2.1 alone (Fig. 3D). The effects of PV on the current dependence of ICa inactivation were especially apparent during trains of repetitive stimuli (Fig. 4). In these experiments, inactivation of ICa in cells transfected with Cav2.1 alone varied less with peak ICa amplitude than during sustained test pulses (Fig. 1). Because Ca2+-dependent facilitation as well as inactivation is evident with this voltage protocol, temporal overlap of both forms of Ca2+ regulation may have minimized the current dependence of ICa inactivation in cells transfected with Cav2.1 alone (Fig. 4A). However, in cells cotransfected with PV, the dependence of ICa inactivation on current amplitude was more pronounced (Fig. 4B). Consistent with results obtained with sustained test pulses (Fig. 3, A and B), PV inhibited inactivation of small ICa and had the opposite effect on large ICa. The net effect of PV was to significantly augment differences in inactivation for ICa of different peak amplitudes (Fig. 4B). The Ca2+-buffering properties of PV could account for the suppression of inactivation of small currents, but we wondered if the opposite effect of PV on large currents could have resulted from Ca2+ unbinding from PV. Large ICa through Cav2.1 channels could rapidly saturate the EF-hand Ca2+ binding sites on PV, and subsequent Ca2+ release from PV might then facilitate CDI. At the concentration of free intracellular Mg2+ in our experiments (∼ 1 mm), estimated rates of Ca2+ unbinding from PV (∼0.9/s, Ref. 44Schmidt H. Brown E.B. Schwaller B. Eilers J. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 2599-2608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) are consistent with the potential for Ca2+ release from PV to occur within the 2-s depolarizing pulse in our experiments (Fig. 3A). In this context, both the inhibitory and stimulatory effects of PV on ICa inactivation should depend critically on the ability of PV to bind Ca2+. To test this, we generated a PV construct with mutations in the second and third EF-hands (PVCDEF). Because these alterations prevent binding of Ca2+ and Mg2+ (31Pauls T.L. Durussel I. Berchtold M.W. Cox J.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10393-10400Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 45Pauls T.L. Durussel I. Cox J.A. Clark I.D. Szabo A.G. Gagne S.M. Sykes B.D. Berchtold M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20897-20903Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), PVCDEF should not replicate Ca2+-dependent effects of PV on Cav2.1 inactivation. In these experiments, Ires/Ipk for ICa was not affected by PVCDEF for either small or large amplitude ICa (p = 0.52 and 0.71, respectively), and the relationship between ICa inactivation and current amplitude was not significantly different from that for Cav2.1 channels expressed alone (p = 0.62, Fig. 5A). These results were not caused by limited expression levels of PVCDEF, because Western blots indicated similar amounts of PV and PVCDEF in lysates harvested from the cotransfected cells (not shown). The dual effects of wild-type PV on ICa inactivation were also not observed when CDI was blocked by a high intracellular concentration (10 mm) of BAPTA (p = 0.17 for ICa<0.4 nA, p = 0.45 for ICa>0.4 nA; Fig. 5B). Moreover, there was no effect of PV on the dependence of ICa inactivation on current amplitude in the presence of 10 mm BAPTA (Fig. 5B). These results argued against the possibility that PV influenced Ca2+-independent (i.e. voltage-dependent) mechanisms of Cav2.1 inactivation, because such actions would have been spared by BAPTA. We conclude that the opposing effects of PV on inactivation of large and small ICa are a consequence of Ca2+ binding to PV, which can either stabilize or diffuse Ca2+ pools that underlie CDI, depending on the amplitude of ICa. Effects of CB on CDI—We investigated further the role of Ca2+ buffer kinetics and CDI in cells cotransfected with calbindin-D28k (CB), a protein with physiological Ca2+ binding rates that are faster, by an order of magnitude, than those for PV (25Nagerl U.V. Mody I. Jeub M. Lie A.A. Elger C.E. Beck H. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 1831-1836Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CB also differs from PV in possessing four functional EF-hands, which have relatively low affinity for Ca2+ compared with those in PV, and do not significantly bind Mg2+ (25Nagerl U.V. Mody I. Jeub M. Lie A.A. Elger C.E. Beck H. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 1831-1836Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In analyses of ICa evoked by step depolarizations, CB significantly inhibited inactivation of ICa < 0.4 nA (∼35% increase in Ires/Ipk compared with Cav2.1 alone, p < 0.02, Fig. 6A) and caused an even greater slowing of inactivation rate than PV (∼52% for CB and ∼36% for PV, Table 1).

While flight studies are limited, the development of rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactors, such as the high aspect ratio vessel (HARV), has facilitated ground-based studies of the effects of modeled microgravity (MMG) on cell-mediated immunity. Astronauts regain immune function 3 days postflight, but this recovery has not yet been demonstrated following MMG. MMG eliminated phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated proliferation of PBMCs. Upon removal from HARV, full recovery was gradually achieved over a 72 h period, in agreement with postflight studies of astronauts. Recovery from MMG delayed, but did not reduce, the maximal proliferative response compared with PHA-activated stationary cultures. Likewise, peak expression of T cell surface activation markers CD69 and CD25 was delayed upon stimulation following exposure to MMG. MMG and recovery from MMG differentially affected the detection of IL-2 and IFN in supernatants. Further development of this model of immune recovery is important for investigating the mechanisms of immune suppression and recovery in space flight, as well as possible countermeasures to prevent immunosuppression or enhance recovery. Given the analogous immune suppression observed in microgravity, MMG, and aging, further investigation may also lead to advances in anti-aging medicine."
https://openalex.org/W2053517005,"The cytochrome c maturation protein CcmE is an essential membrane-anchored heme chaperone involved in the post-translational covalent attachment of heme to c-type cytochromes in Gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli. Previous in vitro studies have shown that CcmE can bind heme both covalently (via a histidine residue) and non-covalently. In this work we present results on the latter form of heme binding to a soluble form of CcmE. Examination of a number of site-directed mutants of E. coli CcmE by resonance Raman spectroscopy has identified ligands of the heme iron and provided insight into the initial steps of heme binding by CcmE before it binds the heme covalently. The heme binding histidine (His-130) appears to ligate the heme iron in the ferric oxidation state, but two other residues ligate the iron in the ferrous form, thereby freeing His-130 to undergo covalent attachment to a heme vinyl group. It appears that the heme ligation in the non-covalent form is different from that in the holo-form, suggesting that a change in ligation could act as a trigger for the formation of the covalent bond and showing the dynamic and oxidation state-sensitive ligation properties of CcmE."
