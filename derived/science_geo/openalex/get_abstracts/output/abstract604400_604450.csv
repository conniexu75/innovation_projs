https://openalex.org/W2786985471,"Both microbial and host genetic factors contribute to the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. There is accumulating evidence that microbial species that potentiate chronic inflammation, as in inflammatory bowel disease, often also colonize healthy individuals. These microorganisms, including the Helicobacter species, can induce pathogenic T cells and are collectively referred to as pathobionts. However, how such T cells are constrained in healthy individuals is not yet understood. Here we report that host tolerance to a potentially pathogenic bacterium, Helicobacter hepaticus, is mediated by the induction of RORγt+FOXP3+ regulatory T (iTreg) cells that selectively restrain pro-inflammatory T helper 17 (TH17) cells and whose function is dependent on the transcription factor c-MAF. Whereas colonization of wild-type mice by H. hepaticus promoted differentiation of RORγt-expressing microorganism-specific iTreg cells in the large intestine, in disease-susceptible IL-10-deficient mice, there was instead expansion of colitogenic TH17 cells. Inactivation of c-MAF in the Treg cell compartment impaired differentiation and function, including IL-10 production, of bacteria-specific iTreg cells, and resulted in the accumulation of H. hepaticus-specific inflammatory TH17 cells and spontaneous colitis. By contrast, RORγt inactivation in Treg cells had only a minor effect on the bacteria-specific Treg and TH17 cell balance, and did not result in inflammation. Our results suggest that pathobiont-dependent inflammatory bowel disease is driven by microbiota-reactive T cells that have escaped this c-MAF-dependent mechanism of iTreg-TH17 homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2787499237,"Many models of cognition and of neural computations posit the use and estimation of prior stimulus statistics: it has long been known that working memory and perception are strongly impacted by previous sensory experience, even when that sensory history is not relevant to the current task at hand. Nevertheless, the neural mechanisms and regions of the brain that are necessary for computing and using such prior experience are unknown. Here we report that the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) is a critical locus for the representation and use of prior stimulus information. We trained rats in an auditory parametric working memory task, and found that they displayed substantial and readily quantifiable behavioural effects of sensory-stimulus history, similar to those observed in humans and monkeys. Earlier proposals that the PPC supports working memory predict that optogenetic silencing of this region would impair behaviour in our working memory task. Contrary to this prediction, we found that silencing the PPC significantly improved performance. Quantitative analyses of behaviour revealed that this improvement was due to the selective reduction of the effects of prior sensory stimuli. Electrophysiological recordings showed that PPC neurons carried far more information about the sensory stimuli of previous trials than about the stimuli of the current trial. Furthermore, for a given rat, the more information about previous trial sensory history in the neural firing rates of the PPC, the greater the behavioural effect of sensory history, suggesting a tight link between behaviour and PPC representations of stimulus history. Our results indicate that the PPC is a central component in the processing of sensory-stimulus history, and could enable further neurobiological investigation of long-standing questions regarding how perception and working memory are affected by prior sensory information."

Although numerous chemical and biological signals have been identified that regulate stem-cell behaviour, whether stem cells can directly sense mechanical signals in vivo remains unclear. Here we show that mechanical stress regulates stem-cell differentiation in the adult Drosophila midgut through the stretch-activated ion channel Piezo. We find that Piezo is specifically expressed in previously unidentified enteroendocrine precursor cells, which have reduced proliferation ability and are destined to become enteroendocrine cells. Loss of Piezo activity reduces the generation of enteroendocrine cells in the adult midgut. In addition, ectopic expression of Piezo in all stem cells triggers both cell proliferation and enteroendocrine cell differentiation. Both the Piezo mutant and overexpression phenotypes can be rescued by manipulation of cytosolic Ca2+ levels, and increases in cytosolic Ca2+ resemble the Piezo overexpression phenotype, suggesting that Piezo functions through Ca2+ signalling. Further studies suggest that Ca2+ signalling promotes stem-cell proliferation and differentiation through separate pathways. Finally, Piezo is required for both mechanical activation of stem cells in a gut expansion assay and the increase of cytosolic Ca2+ in response to direct mechanical stimulus in a gut compression assay. Thus, our study demonstrates the existence of a specific group of stem cells in the fly midgut that can directly sense mechanical signals through Piezo."
https://openalex.org/W2786755330,"A crystal structure of DNMT3A and its regulatory partner DNMT3L bound to DNA reveals the mechanistic basis for DNMT3A-mediated DNA methylation and establishes its aetiological link to human disease. Methylation of DNA at CG dinucleotides is an important epigenetic regulatory event. It is associated with processes such as silencing of gene transcription, genomic imprinting and cell fate determination. DNA methylation is established by the de novo DNA methyltransferases DNMT3A and DNMT3B and is subsequently maintained by DNMT1. Here, Jikui Song and colleagues have determined a crystal structure of DNMT3A and its regulatory partner DNMT3L bound to DNA, revealing how the CG dinucleotide is specifically recognized by a DNMT3A–DNMT3L tetramer. They also analyse the effect of cancer-associated mutations in DNMT3A, showing that the DNA-binding residues of DNMT3A are crucial to establishing appropriate cellular DNA methylation patterns and are associated with deregulated proliferation. DNA methylation by de novo DNA methyltransferases 3A (DNMT3A) and 3B (DNMT3B) at cytosines is essential for genome regulation and development1,2. Dysregulation of this process is implicated in various diseases, notably cancer. However, the mechanisms underlying DNMT3 substrate recognition and enzymatic specificity remain elusive. Here we report a 2.65-ångström crystal structure of the DNMT3A–DNMT3L–DNA complex in which two DNMT3A monomers simultaneously attack two cytosine–phosphate–guanine (CpG) dinucleotides, with the target sites separated by 14 base pairs within the same DNA duplex. The DNMT3A–DNA interaction involves a target recognition domain, a catalytic loop, and DNMT3A homodimeric interface. Arg836 of the target recognition domain makes crucial contacts with CpG, ensuring DNMT3A enzymatic preference towards CpG sites in cells. Haematological cancer-associated somatic mutations of the substrate-binding residues decrease DNMT3A activity, induce CpG hypomethylation, and promote transformation of haematopoietic cells. Together, our study reveals the mechanistic basis for DNMT3A-mediated DNA methylation and establishes its aetiological link to human disease."

https://openalex.org/W2787054606,"Wild Australian magpies (Cracticus tibicen dorsalis) living in large groups show increased cognitive performance, which is associated with increased reproductive success. What determines general intelligence? Brain size, nutritional status and environmental factors play their part, but one of the most popular ideas is the 'social brain' hypothesis—that intelligence is related to societal complexity. Most studies, however, are confounded by the fact that different species are being compared. Benjamin Ashton and colleagues look at groups of different sizes in a single species, the cooperatively breeding Australian magpie. They show that wild Australian magpies living in larger groups solve puzzles more quickly than those living in smaller groups. Greater puzzle-solving performance is in turn related to reproductive success. The social intelligence hypothesis states that the demands of social life drive cognitive evolution1,2,3. This idea receives support from comparative studies that link variation in group size or mating systems with cognitive and neuroanatomical differences across species3,4,5,6,7, but findings are contradictory and contentious8,9,10. To understand the cognitive consequences of sociality, it is also important to investigate social variation within species. Here we show that in wild, cooperatively breeding Australian magpies, individuals that live in large groups show increased cognitive performance, which is linked to increased reproductive success. Individual performance was highly correlated across four cognitive tasks, indicating a ‘general intelligence factor’ that underlies cognitive performance. Repeated cognitive testing of juveniles at different ages showed that the correlation between group size and cognition emerged in early life, suggesting that living in larger groups promotes cognitive development. Furthermore, we found a positive association between the task performance of females and three indicators of reproductive success, thus identifying a selective benefit of greater cognitive performance. Together, these results provide intraspecific evidence that sociality can shape cognitive development and evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2787079193,"Brain functions rely on specific patterns of connectivity. Teneurins are evolutionarily conserved transmembrane proteins that instruct synaptic partner matching in Drosophila and are required for vertebrate visual system development. The roles of vertebrate teneurins in connectivity beyond the visual system remain largely unknown and their mechanisms of action have not been demonstrated. Here we show that mouse teneurin-3 is expressed in multiple topographically interconnected areas of the hippocampal region, including proximal CA1, distal subiculum, and medial entorhinal cortex. Viral-genetic analyses reveal that teneurin-3 is required in both CA1 and subicular neurons for the precise targeting of proximal CA1 axons to distal subiculum. Furthermore, teneurin-3 promotes homophilic adhesion in vitro in a splicing isoform-dependent manner. These findings demonstrate striking genetic heterogeneity across multiple hippocampal areas and suggest that teneurin-3 may orchestrate the assembly of a complex distributed circuit in the mammalian brain via matching expression and homophilic attraction."
https://openalex.org/W2787855209,"Inflammatory cell death, or pyroptosis, is triggered by pathogenic infections or events. It is executed by caspase-1 (in the canonical pyroptosis pathway) or caspase-11 (noncanonical pathway), each via production of a cell-lytic domain from the pyroptosis effector protein gasdermin D through specific and limited proteolysis. Pyroptosis is accompanied by the release of inflammatory mediators, including the proteolytically processed forms of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and IL-18. Given the similar inflammatory outcomes of the canonical and noncanonical pyroptosis pathways, we hypothesized that caspase-1 and -11 should have very similar activities and substrate specificities. To test this hypothesis, we purified recombinant murine caspases and analyzed their primary specificities by massive hybrid combinatorial substrate library (HyCoSuL) screens. We correlated the substrate preferences of each caspase with their activities on the recombinant natural substrates IL-1β, IL-18, and gasdermin D. Although we identified highly selective and robust peptidyl substrates for caspase-1, we were unable to do so for caspase-11, because caspase-1 cleaved even the best caspase-11 substrates equally well. Caspase-1 rapidly processed pro-IL-1β and -18, but caspase-11 processed these two pro-ILs extremely poorly. However, both caspase-1 and -11 efficiently produced the cell-lytic domain from the gasdermin D precursor. We hypothesize that caspase-11 may have evolved a specific exosite to selectively engage pyroptosis without directly activating pro-IL-1β or -18. In summary, comparing the activities of caspase-1 and -11 in HyCoSuL screens and with three endogenous protein substrates, we conclude that caspase-11 has highly restricted substrate specificity, preferring gasdermin D over all other substrates examined.

Together these caspase-1-mediated limited proteolytic events provide a rational explanation of how leaderless cytokines are activated and released from bacterially-infected macrophages, no export mechanism is required because the release is from N-GSDMD-permeabilized cells. Thus there exist three well-recognized substrates for caspase-1, and at least one substrate in common with caspase-11 (GSDMD). Genetic evidence based on induction of non-canonical pyroptosis indicates that caspase-1 and the canonical inflammasome components Nlrp3 and ASC are required for processing of pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 with the implication that caspase-11 does not, or cannot, process these cytokines (1Kayagaki N. Warming S. Lamkanfi M. Vande Walle L. Louie S. Dong J. Newton K. Qu Y. Liu J. Heldens S. Zhang J. Lee W.P. Roose-Girma M. Dixit V.M.

Given the 53% sequence identity in their catalytic domains of caspase-1 and -11 and the regulatory role caspase-11 has been implicated to play, a question that has remained unanswered is whether efficient catalysis of caspase-11 on pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18, the only two members of the interleukin family that are processed by caspase-1, differs from caspase-1 hydrolysis. The biochemical characterization of caspase-1 and -11 presented here addresses this dichotomy. Screening of proteolytic enzymes with short peptide substrate libraries is a common approach to define their inherent substrate preferences in the active site, and thus distinguish closely related proteases. Several chemical- and biological-based approaches have been developed to dissect protease preferences (26Poreba M. Drag M. Current strategies for probing substrate specificity of proteases.Curr. Med.

This seminal research provided a robust screening platform and a framework defining the major differences in specificity between inflammatory and apoptotic caspases. These tetrapeptides have served for many years as gold standards for developing substrates, inhibitors, and activity-based probes to study caspases (29Poreba M. Szalek A. Kasperkiewicz P. Rut W.

A substantial extension of PS-SCL termed hybrid combinatorial substrate library (HyCoSuL) (31Poreba M. Salvesen G.S. Drag M. Synthesis of a HyCoSuL peptide substrate library to dissect protease substrate specificity.Nat. Protoc. 2017; 12 (28933778): 2189-221410.1038/nprot.2017.091Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) employs a wide set of unnatural amino acids in peptide mixtures, allowing for detailed exploration of protease-active sites, as we have employed HyCoSuL to discriminate between human apoptotic caspases (32Poreba M. Kasperkiewicz P. Snipas S.J. Fasci D. Salvesen G.S. Drag M. Unnatural amino acids increase sensitivity and provide for the design of highly selective caspase substrates.Cell Death Differ. 2014; 21 (24832467): 1482-149210.1038/cdd.2014.64Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we employed HyCoSuL here to explore specificity differences between mouse caspase-1 and -11, and deployed the complementary technique of natural protein profiling and kinetics to address the individual roles of caspase-1 and -11 in pyroptosis and inflammatory cytokine activation. To explore and differentiate the substrate specificity of mouse caspase-1 and caspase-11, we expressed full-length C-terminally His-tagged versions of each enzyme as well as caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD)-deleted (ΔCARD) versions (Fig. 1). When expressed in Escherichia coli, the purified soluble material did not render a full-length enzyme (Fig. 1B). The purified material from ΔCARD constructs of caspase-1 and -11 revealed two species: an unprocessed catalytic domain comprised of large and small subunits, and processed large and small subunits (Fig. 1B). The identity of these ΔCARD caspase-11 derivatives was confirmed by MS/MALDI (Fig. 1B). MALDI analysis of caspase-11 recovered from full-length construct expression revealed removal of the CARD consistent with cleavage at Phe77/Ser78, which is likely due to cleavage by an endogenous E. coli protease. CARD-containing proteins belong to the death domain superfamily, which consists of 35 family members, all varying in solubility degree when expressed in E. coli (33Shen W. Yun S. Tam B. Dalal K. Pio F.F. Target selection of soluble protein complexes for structural proteomics studies.Proteome Sci. 2005; 3 (15904526): 310.1186/1477-5956-3-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The disappearance of CARDs from the full-length expression constructs raised three possibilities: 1) the overexpression resulted in autoprocessing and removal of the CARDs, 2) CARD is insoluble and was trapped in inclusion bodies; and/or 3) CARD is cleaved by an E. coli protease. To investigate these possibilities we dissolved cell pellets in 8 m urea and purified all His-tagged proteins under denaturing conditions. Immunoblotting revealed full-length versions of both enzymes (Fig. 1C), suggesting that the CARD rendered the full-length caspases insoluble upon expression in E. coli and we are thus only able to purify CARD-removed proteins. Although CARD-containing proteins, such as human ASC and ICEBERG, have been refolded from denatured preparations (33Shen W. Yun S. Tam B. Dalal K. Pio F.F. Target selection of soluble protein complexes for structural proteomics studies.Proteome Sci. 2005; 3 (15904526): 310.1186/1477-5956-3-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), our efforts to capture activity following denaturation and renaturation of caspase-1 or -11 were futile after following previously reported protocols (34Burgess R.R. Refolding solubilized inclusion body proteins.Methods Enzymol. 2009; 463 (19892177): 259-28210.1016/S0076-6879(09)63017-2Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Accordingly, because of higher yields, we decided to continue our work with the ΔCARD-purified derivatives of these enzymes. The enzymes were scanned using a HyCoSuL, which employs 19 natural amino acids and 110 unnatural amino acids (32Poreba M. Kasperkiewicz P. Snipas S.J. Fasci D. Salvesen G.S. Drag M. Unnatural amino acids increase sensitivity and provide for the design of highly selective caspase substrates.Cell Death Differ. 2014; 21 (24832467): 1482-149210.1038/cdd.2014.64Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This tactic allows us to explore in depth the chemical space represented by caspase-active sites. The general formula of the HyCoSuL library is Ac-P4-P3-P2-Asp-ACC where the primary specificity determinant (P1) is fixed as Asp, and the upstream P2–P4 positions are randomized. Caspase-1 and caspase-11 are not synonymous on this library and each displays characteristic differences, as visualized by comparison of preferences for natural amino acids (Fig. 2A). The analysis reveals caspase-1 and -11 both have a strong preference for histidine in the P2 position, and broad tolerance in the P3 position. Caspase-11 accepts a wide variety of residues at P3, but this position is more restrictive for caspase-1. At the P4 position caspase-1 prefers tryptophan, whereas caspase-11 favors valine. The region of endogenous substrates spanning the cleavage sites for caspase-1 and -11 (Fig. 2B) reveals that P4 and P3 somewhat match the optimal substrate sequence motifs, but that P2 does not, with the optimal histidine not utilized in endogenous protein substrates. Expanding the screen with unnatural amino acids reveals that in the P2 position caspase-11 can also recognize His(Bzl), whereas caspase-1 has much broader specificity recognizing multiple amino acids, including His(Bzl). Both enzymes present broad specificity in P3 with caspase-11 even tolerating d-amino acids to a small extent, however, several amino acids (Bip, Tyr(Bzl), Bpa) are significantly better recognized by caspase-11 than by caspase-1. The P4 position shows broad specificity for aliphatic and aromatic unnatural amino acids for both caspases with Trp(Me) being the best for caspase-1 and Tle (tert-leucine) being the most active toward caspase-11. Detailed amino acid screening profiles for caspase-1 and -11 are found in Figs. S1–S3. These characteristics suggested that we may be able to generate individual caspase-selective substrates, and to this end we synthesized the top hits for P2, P3, and P4 using natural amino acids and determined kcat/Km values (Table 1 and Table S1). WEHD and LEHD-based substrates had already been used to measure inflammatory caspase activity (35Garcia-Calvo M. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Vaillancourt J.P. Zamboni R. Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Purification and catalytic properties of human caspase family members.Cell Death Diff. 1999; 6: 362-36910.1038/sj.cdd.4400497Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), and thus served as prior indicators. Indeed, WEHD is the best substrate for caspase-1 with a kcat/Km of 522,000 m−1 s−1. We found the WQPD substrate sequence to be highly selective for caspase-1 over caspase-11 (selectivity factor >5,140), and over a panel of other caspases (Table S3). The best substrates for caspase-11 included PYHD and PMHD tetrapeptides, however, caspase-1 cleaved these substrates even more efficiently with 2–3-fold higher kcat/Km values. Based on these results, caspase-1 is a more active enzyme and outpaces caspase-11 on all substrates containing natural amino acids.Table 1Unique preferred substrates with natural amino acidsSubstrate sequence: Ac-P4-P3-P2-P1-ACCkcat/KmSelectivity factorCaspase-1Caspase-11m−1s−1Reference substratesWEHD522,0004,100127LEHD179,0003,85047Caspase-1 preferredWQPD257,000<50>5,140FEAD171,000<50>3,420WQVD328,0002441,340Caspase-11 preferredPYHD22,4007,0703.2PMHD16,1007,2002.2 Open table in a new tab Taking advantage of the unique side chains that unnatural amino acids present to explore the active sites of caspase-1 and -11, we synthesized distinctive substrates based on the preferred unnatural amino acid library screening results (Table 2, Table S2). To account for potential subsite cooperativity issues (36Ng N.M. Pike R.N. Boyd S.E. Subsite cooperativity in protease specificity.Biol.

We found several substrates that display significant selectivity for caspase-1 over caspase-11. All these substrates share some structural similarities: cyclic, aliphatic (Cha), or aromatic (Phe and Trp derivatives) amino acids at the P4 position, Glu or Met(O2) at P3, and Tic or His(Bzl) at P2. Despite the large diversity of unnatural amino acids used in HyCoSuL none of these substrates was more selective than the substrate containing the natural amino acids WQPD, and the Cha-Glu-Tic-Asp unnatural substrate was only slightly more active than the reference natural amino acid WEHD sequence.Table 2Unique preferred substrates with unnatural amino acidsSubstrate sequence: Ac-P4-P3-P2-P1-ACCkcat/KmSelectivity factorCaspase-1Caspase-11m−1s−1Caspase-1 preferredCha-Glu-Tic-Asp544,000609893Phe(2Cl)-Glu-Tic-Asp525,0001,010519Trp(Me)-Glu-His(Bzl)-Asp524,0001,700106Trp-Met(O2)-His-Asp512,0007,14072Caspase-11 preferredTle-Bpa-His(Bzl)-Asp89,000112,0000.80Tle-Bip-His-Asp80,200109,0000.74Pro-Bip-His(Bzl)-Asp25,90069,0000.38 Open table in a new tab In contrast to caspase-1, more success in obtaining better substrates for caspase-11 was achieved. We found that the use of branched, aliphatic amino acids (Tle) at P4, and large, aromatic amino acids (Bip, Bpa) at P3 generated substantially improved substrates, as the Ac-Tle-Bpa-His(Bzl)-Asp-ACC was hydrolyzed 15.6- and 27-fold faster than the best substrate containing natural amino acids (Ac-PMHD-ACC) and reference (Ac-WEHD-ACC) substrates, respectively (Fig. 3). The extended nature of the cyclic side chains that comprise these unnatural amino acids may indicate that they could reach surface hydrophobic pockets that natural amino acids cannot explore, much as seen in the case of binding of peptides based on unnatural amino acids to the serine protease neutrophil elastase (38Lechtenberg B.C. Kasperkiewicz P. Robinson H. Drag M. Riedl S.J. The elastase-PK101 structure: mechanism of an ultrasensitive activity-based probe revealed.ACS Chem.

Unfortunately, even the best caspase-11 substrates were also efficiently hydrolyzed by caspase-1 so we could not obtain a substrate reasonably selective for caspase-11. Nevertheless, we demonstrated that the application of unnatural amino acids is a good strategy to enhance catalysis for caspase-11. To compare the catalytic efficiency of mouse inflammatory caspases for endogenous substrates, we incubated the active site-titrated enzymes with 4 μm recombinant mouse pro-IL-1β, pro-IL-18, and GSDMD (Fig. 4).

Recently, it has been documented that MAR1 could ameliorate inflammation and insulin resistance in obese mice. These findings led us to investigate the effects of MAR1 on hepatic lipid metabolism. We found that MAR1 could stimulate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), thereby augmenting sarcoendoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase 2b (SERCA2b) expression. This stimulation suppressed lipid accumulation by attenuating the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in hepatocytes under hyperlipidemic conditions. Attenuation was mitigated by knockdown of AMPK or thapsigargin, a SERCA2b inhibitor. We also demonstrated that MAR1 administration resulted in increased hepatic AMPK phosphorylation and Serca2b mRNA expression, whereas hepatic ER stress was reduced in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. Moreover, MAR1 treatment suppressed hepatic lipid synthesis, thereby attenuating hepatic steatosis in HFD-fed mice. In conclusion, our results suggest that MAR1 ameliorates hepatic steatosis via AMPK/SERCA2b-mediated suppression of ER stress. Therefore, MAR1 may be an effective therapeutic strategy for treating non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) via regulation of ER stress-induced hepatic lipogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2785988319,"One of the strongest risk factors for dementia is the ε4 variant of the APOE gene. Yet, many who carry it never develop dementia. The current study examined for the first time whether positive age beliefs that are acquired from the culture may reduce the risk of developing dementia among older individuals, including those who are APOE ε4 carriers. The cohort consisted of 4,765 Health and Retirement Study participants who were aged 60 or older and dementia-free at baseline. As predicted, in the total sample those with positive age beliefs at baseline were significantly less likely to develop dementia, after adjusting for relevant covariates. Among those with APOE ε4, those with positive age beliefs were 49.8% less likely to develop dementia than those with negative age beliefs. The results of this study suggest that positive age beliefs, which are modifiable and have been found to reduce stress, can act as a protective factor, even for older individuals at high risk of dementia."
https://openalex.org/W2787073449,"The halo of gas around a galaxy at redshift 1 is clumpy and anisotropic, with little variation in gas velocity, suggesting that it consists of entrained recycled material. Star-forming galaxies are surrounded by haloes of gas that has been enriched with the 'metals' created in stars and supernovae. These haloes extend out at least 100 kiloparsecs, but the structure of the gas is poorly constrained. Sebastian Lopez and collaborators use a bright gravitationally lensed arc as a back light to study Mg ɪɪ absorption in a galaxy at a redshift of 0.98. They find that the absorption strength decreases with increasing distance from the galaxy, which is in good agreement with the limited results from earlier studies. However, they find that the gas is not isotropically distributed, and that the velocity varies little over a large area. Every star-forming galaxy has a halo of metal-enriched gas that extends out to at least 100 kiloparsecs1,2,3, as revealed by the absorption lines that this gas imprints on the spectra of background quasars4. However, quasars are sparse and typically probe only one narrow beam of emission through the intervening galaxy. Close quasar pairs5,6,7 and gravitationally lensed quasars8,9,10,11 have been used to circumvent this inherently one-dimensional technique, but these objects are rare and the structure of the circumgalactic medium remains poorly constrained. As a result, our understanding of the physical processes that drive the recycling of baryons across the lifetime of a galaxy is limited12,13. Here we report integral-field (tomographic) spectroscopy of an extended background source—a bright, giant gravitational arc. We can thus coherently map the spatial and kinematic distribution of Mg ɪɪ absorption—a standard tracer of enriched gas—in an intervening galaxy system at redshift 0.98 (around 8 billion years ago). Our gravitational-arc tomography unveils a clumpy medium in which the absorption strength decreases with increasing distance from the galaxy system, in good agreement with results for quasars. Furthermore, we find strong evidence that the gas is not distributed isotropically. Interestingly, we detect little kinematic variation over a projected area of approximately 600 square kiloparsecs, with all line-of-sight velocities confined to within a few tens of kilometres per second of each other. These results suggest that the detected absorption originates from entrained recycled material, rather than in a galactic outflow."
https://openalex.org/W156982620,"Many institutions worldwide are considering how to include uncertainty about future changes in sea-levels and storm surges into their investment decisions regarding large capital infrastructures. Here we examine how to characterize deeply uncertain climate change projections to support such decisions using Robust Decision Making analysis. We address questions regarding how to confront the potential for future changes in low probability but large impact flooding events due to changes in sea-levels and storm surges. Such extreme events can affect investments in infrastructure but have proved difficult to consider in such decisions because of the deep uncertainty surrounding them. This study utilizes Robust Decision Making methods to address two questions applied to investment decisions at the Port of Los Angeles: (1) Under what future conditions would a Port of Los Angeles decision to harden its facilities against extreme flood scenarios at the next upgrade pass a cost-benefit test, and (2) Do sea-level rise projections and other information suggest such conditions are sufficiently likely to justify such an investment? We also compare and contrast the Robust Decision Making methods with a full probabilistic analysis. These two analysis frameworks result in similar investment recommendations for different idealized future sea-level projections, but provide different information to decision makers and envision different types of engagement with stakeholders. In particular, the full probabilistic analysis begins by aggregating the best scientific information into a single set of joint probability distributions, while the Robust Decision Making analysis identifies scenarios where a decision to invest in near-term response to extreme sea-level rise passes a cost-benefit test, and then assembles scientific information of differing levels of confidence to help decision makers judge whether or not these scenarios are sufficiently likely to justify making such investments. Results highlight the highly-localized and context dependent nature of applying Robust Decision Making methods to inform investment decisions."
https://openalex.org/W2788048307,"Many studies project future bird ranges by relying on correlative species distribution models. Such models do not usually represent important processes explicitly related to climate change and harvesting, which limits their potential for predicting and understanding the future of boreal bird assemblages at the landscape scale. In this study, we attempted to assess the cumulative and specific impacts of both harvesting and climate-induced changes on wildfires and stand-level processes (e.g., reproduction, growth) in the boreal forest of eastern Canada. The projected changes in these landscape- and stand-scale processes (referred to as ""drivers of change"") were then assessed for their impacts on future habitats and potential productivity of black-backed woodpecker (BBWO; Picoides arcticus), a focal species representative of deadwood and old-growth biodiversity in eastern Canada. Forest attributes were simulated using a forest landscape model, LANDIS-II, and were used to infer future landscape suitability to BBWO under three anthropogenic climate forcing scenarios (RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5), compared to the historical baseline. We found climate change is likely to be detrimental for BBWO, with up to 92% decline in potential productivity under the worst-case climate forcing scenario (RCP 8.5). However, large declines were also projected under baseline climate, underlining the importance of harvest in determining future BBWO productivity. Present-day harvesting practices were the single most important cause of declining areas of old-growth coniferous forest, and hence appeared as the single most important driver of future BBWO productivity, regardless of the climate scenario. Climate-induced increases in fire activity would further promote young, deciduous stands at the expense of old-growth coniferous stands. This suggests that the biodiversity associated with deadwood and old-growth boreal forests may be greatly altered by the cumulative impacts of natural and anthropogenic disturbances under a changing climate. Management adaptations, including reduced harvesting levels and strategies to promote coniferous species content, may help mitigate these cumulative impacts."

We also found that MAZ is predominantly expressed in pancreatic cancer stem cells. Functional analysis indicated that MAZ depletion in PDAC cells inhibits invasive phenotypes such as the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, migration, invasion, and the sphere-forming ability of PDAC cells. Mechanistically, we detected no direct effects of MAZ on the expression of K-Ras mutants, but MAZ increased the activity of CRAF–ERK signaling, a downstream signaling target of K-Ras. The MAZ-induced activation of CRAF–ERK signaling was mediated via p21-activated protein kinase (PAK) and protein kinase B (AKT/PKB) signaling cascades and promoted PDAC cell invasiveness. Moreover, we found that the matricellular oncoprotein cysteine-rich angiogenic inducer 61 (Cyr61/CCN1) regulates MAZ expression via Notch-1–sonic hedgehog signaling in PDAC cells.

https://openalex.org/W2789520806,"Staphylococcus aureus is a versatile pathogen capable of causing a broad range of diseases in many different hosts. S. aureus can adapt to its host through modification of its genome (e.g. by acquisition and exchange of mobile genetic elements that encode host-specific virulence factors). Recently, the prophage φSaeq1 was discovered in S. aureus strains from six different clonal lineages almost exclusively isolated from equids. Within this phage, we discovered a novel variant of staphylococcal complement inhibitor (SCIN), a secreted protein that interferes with activation of the human complement system, an important line of host defense. We here show that this equine variant of SCIN, eqSCIN, is a potent blocker of equine complement system activation and subsequent phagocytosis of bacteria by phagocytes. Mechanistic studies indicate that eqSCIN blocks equine complement activation by specific inhibition of the C3 convertase enzyme (C3bBb). Whereas SCIN-A from human S. aureus isolates exclusively inhibits human complement, eqSCIN represents the first animal-adapted SCIN variant that functions in a broader range of hosts (horses, humans, and pigs). Binding analyses suggest that the human-specific activity of SCIN-A is related to amino acid differences on both sides of the SCIN-C3b interface. These data suggest that modification of this phage-encoded complement inhibitor plays a role in the host adaptation of S. aureus and are important to understand how this pathogen transfers between different hosts."
https://openalex.org/W2793105795,"Background Tuberculosis (TB) patients face substantial delays prior to treatment initiation, and out of pocket (OOP) expenditures often surpass the economic productivity of the household. We evaluated the pre-diagnostic cost and health seeking behaviour of new adult pulmonary TB patients registered at Primary Health Centres (PHCs) in Vellore district, Tamil Nadu, India. Methods This descriptive study, part of a randomised controlled trial conducted in three rural Tuberculosis Units from Dec 2012 to Dec 2015, collected data on number of health facilities, dates of visits prior to the initiation of anti-tuberculosis treatment, and direct OOP medical costs associated with TB diagnosis. Logistic regression analysis examined the factors associated with delays in treatment initiation and OOP expenditures. Results Of 880 TB patients interviewed, 34.7% presented to public health facilities and 65% patients sought private health facilities as their first point of care. The average monthly individual income was $77.79 (SD 57.14). About 69% incurred some pre-treatment costs at an average of $39.74. Overall, patients experienced a median of 6 days (3–11 IQR) of time to treatment initiation and 21 days (10–30 IQR) of health systems delay. Age ≤ 40 years (aOR: 1.73; CI: 1.22–2.44), diabetes (aOR: 1.63; CI: 1.08–2.44) and first visit to a private health facility (aOR: 17.2; CI: 11.1–26.4) were associated with higher direct OOP medical costs, while age ≤ 40 years (aOR: 0.64; CI: 0.48–0.85) and first visit to private health facility (aOR: 1.79, CI: 1.34–2.39) were associated with health systems delay. Conclusion The majority of rural TB patients registering at PHCs visited private health facilities first and incurred substantial direct OOP medical costs and delays prior to diagnosis and anti-tuberculosis treatment initiation. This study highlights the need for PHCs to be made as the preferred choice for first point of contact, to combat TB more efficiently."
https://openalex.org/W2786457716,"Although the functional role of chromatin marks at promoters in mediating cell-restricted gene expression has been well characterized, the role of intragenic chromatin marks is not well understood, especially in endothelial cell (EC) gene expression. Here, we characterized the histone H3 and H4 acetylation profiles of 19 genes with EC-enriched expression via locus-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by ultra-high–resolution (5 bp) tiling array analysis in ECs versus non-ECs throughout their genomic loci. Importantly, these genes exhibit differential EC enrichment of H3 and H4 acetylation in their promoter in ECs versus non-ECs. Interestingly, VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-1 show EC-enriched acetylation across broad intragenic regions and are up-regulated in non-ECs by histone deacetylase inhibition. It is unclear which histone acetyltransferases (KATs) are key to EC physiology. Depletion of KAT7 reduced VEGFR-2 expression and disrupted angiogenic potential. Microarray analysis of KAT7-depleted ECs identified 263 differentially regulated genes, many of which are key for growth and angiogenic potential. KAT7 inhibition in zebrafish embryos disrupted vessel formation and caused loss of circulatory integrity, especially hemorrhage, all of which were rescued with human KAT7. Notably, perturbed EC-enriched gene expression, especially the VEGFR-2 homologs, contributed to these vascular defects. Mechanistically, KAT7 participates in VEGFR-2 transcription by mediating RNA polymerase II binding, H3 lysine 14, and H4 acetylation in its intragenic region. Collectively, our findings support the importance of differential histone acetylation at both promoter and intragenic regions of EC genes and reveal a previously underappreciated role of KAT7 and intragenic histone acetylation in regulating VEGFR-2 and endothelial function."

Two other phosphate-responsive genes in S. pombe (pho1 and tgp1) had been shown to be repressed in cis by transcription of a long noncoding (lnc) RNA from the upstream flanking gene, but whether pho84 expression is regulated in this manner is unclear. Here, we show that repression of pho84 is enforced by transcription of the SPBC8E4.02c locus upstream of pho84 to produce a lncRNA that we name prt2 (pho-repressive transcript 2). We identify two essential elements of the prt2 promoter, a HomolD box and a TATA box, mutations of which inactivate the prt2 promoter and de-repress the downstream pho84 promoter under phosphate-replete conditions. We find that prt2 promoter inactivation also elicits a cascade effect on the adjacent downstream prt (lncRNA) and pho1 (acid phosphatase) genes, whereby increased pho84 transcription down-regulates prt lncRNA transcription and thereby de-represses pho1. Our results establish a unified model for the repressive arm of fission yeast phosphate homeostasis, in which transcription of prt2, prt, and nc-tgp1 lncRNAs interferes with the promoters of the flanking pho84, pho1, and tgp1 genes, respectively.

Here, we show that repression of pho84 is enforced by transcription of the SPBC8E4.02c locus upstream of pho84 to produce a lncRNA that we name prt2 (pho-repressive transcript 2). We identify two essential elements of the prt2 promoter, a HomolD box and a TATA box, mutations of which inactivate the prt2 promoter and de-repress the downstream pho84 promoter under phosphate-replete conditions. We find that prt2 promoter inactivation also elicits a cascade effect on the adjacent downstream prt (lncRNA) and pho1 (acid phosphatase) genes, whereby increased pho84 transcription down-regulates prt lncRNA transcription and thereby de-represses pho1. Our results establish a unified model for the repressive arm of fission yeast phosphate homeostasis, in which transcription of prt2, prt, and nc-tgp1 lncRNAs interferes with the promoters of the flanking pho84, pho1, and tgp1 genes, respectively."

Thus, to re-create this ternary protein system, we combined purified human Hsp70 with DnaJA2 and BAG2 and then screened 100,000 diverse compounds for those that inhibited co-chaperone–stimulated ATPase activity. This HTS campaign yielded two compounds with promising inhibitory activity. Interestingly, one inhibited the PPI between Hsp70 and DnaJA2, whereas the other seemed to inhibit the Hsp70–BAG2 complex. Using secondary assays, we found that both compounds inhibited the PPIs through binding to allosteric sites on Hsp70, but neither affected Hsp70’s intrinsic ATPase activity.

Such transfers of protons and electrons could occur sequentially or by proton-coupled electron transfer. Alternatively, homolytic scission of an Fe(III)coproheme–OOH bond could yield a hydroxyl radical (•OH) that is channeled by the active site toward a specific C–H bond on the reactive propionate. A mechanism of this type would be consistent with the proposed self-hydroxylation catalyzed by heme oxygenases (1Unno M. Matsui T. Ikeda-Saito M.

How the enzyme would convey a highly reactive •OH to specific sites of reaction on the two propionates is unclear. To distinguish among these pathways, EPR spectroscopy and kinetic methods were used to monitor the coproheme decarboxylation using WT, mutant, and site-selectively deuterated proteins as well as deuterium-labeled substrates. Strong experimental evidence is presented in support of a mechanism where the substrate iron activates H2O2, Tyr-145 forms a radical species via hydrogen atom transfer, and the resulting Tyr-145 radical (Tyr-145•) acts as the unique intermediary for hydrogen atom transfer from both reactive propionates. Deuterium-labeled coproporphyrinogen III (Fig. S1) was prepared in a single step by co-incubating 3,3,5,5-2H4-aminolevulinic acid (D4-ALA) 2The abbreviations used are: D4-ALA3,3,5,5-2H4-aminolevulinic acidμWmicrowatt(s)mWmilliwatt(s). and the enzymes HemB–E in buffer in an anaerobic chamber. Colorless d-coproporphyrinogen III was subsequently oxidized to pink d-coproporphyrin III using HemY and O2 from ambient air. The HPLC trace for the HemBCDEY reaction (Fig. S1) confirms that the product has a retention time matching a pure coproporphyrin III standard, with minimal detectable contaminants with absorbance in the 300–700-nm range. The predicted exact mass for the [M + H]+ ion (667.3 g/mol, M = C36H26D12N4O8) is observed in the mass spectrum (Fig. S1), with the same expected isotopic distribution reported previously for d-coproporphyrin (MS, [M + H]+: 667.3 Da, determined distribution: Mfull, 1.4%; Mfull-1D, 5.2%; Mfull-2D, 15.8%; Mfull-3D, 20.2%; Mfull-4D, 20.9%; Mfull-5D, 19.5%; Mfull-6D, 11%; Mfull-7D, 4.6%; Mfull-8D, 1.3%; Mfull-9D, 0.2%). The starting materials and products were subsequently analyzed by 1H NMR (Fig. S2). The data show loss of intensity in peaks associated with the four propionate β-carbons (4.55 ppm) and the four tetrapyrrole-bridging meso carbons (11.2–11.3 ppm), indicating that the protons at these positions have been substituted with deuterium. Consistent with prior work (11Layer G. Pierik A.J. Trost M. Rigby S.E. Leech H.K. Grage K. Breckau D. Astner I. Jänsch L. Heathcote P. Warren M.J. Heinz D.W. Jahn D.

Typical pure protein yields for the decarboxylase were ∼8 mg/liter culture. By contrast, pure d-Tyr-labeled enzyme was produced at 2 mg/liter culture, due to low levels of expression in the Tyr auxotrophic strain. Complete conversion of substrate to product required 400 eq of H2O2 (pH 7.4 potassium phosphate, 20 °C). Under those conditions, the reaction was complete within 1 min (Fig. S3). By contrast, prior work showed that ∼10 eq of H2O2 was sufficient to convert the WT/unlabeled enzyme–coproheme complex to heme b; the small excess of H2O2 was required due to competing side reactions between H2O2 and the protein/heme (7Celis A.I.

The decarboxylase–coproheme complex and 10 eq of H2O2 were manually mixed (pH 8.8, 20 °C) and subsequently freeze-trapped in EPR tubes at time points from 0.5 to 5 min. The resulting 77 K, X-band EPR spectra illustrated the formation of an EPR-active S = ½ species within 0.5 min that subsequently decayed nearly to baseline over the next 5 min (Fig. 2A). Although a full EPR kinetic time course is lacking, the appearance of the S = ½ species within 0.5 min of mixing and its subsequent decay within 300 s are kinetically consistent with its assignment as an intermediate in the conversion of coproheme to heme b, based on the expected reaction t½ = 140 s for heme b formation cited above (7Celis A.I.

Moreover, the 14-s half-life for the initial decarboxylation of P2 to yield harderoheme and the ∼300-s lifetime of the radical species overall suggest that the observed EPR signals most likely represent superimposed radical intermediate density from both the decarboxylations of P2 and P4, particularly at the later time points (7Celis A.I.

Double integration of the 0.5-min sample spectrum and comparison with a TEMPO standard curve indicated that it contained a 35 μm concentration of the EPR-active species per 100 μm decarboxylase–coproheme complex initially present, where the complex converts nearly stoichiometrically to decarboxylase–heme b under the conditions used. The spectrum showed a partially resolved four-line signal centered at g = 2.005 with a peak-to-trough line width of ∼20 G (Fig. S4), consistent with an amino acid side chain radical (see below) (12Barry B.A. el-Deeb M.K.

To gain more information about the radical species, spectra for the 0.5-min sample were measured as a function of applied microwave power and at varying temperatures (Fig. 2, B and C). Increasing power yielded a series of similar looking traces that diminished in intensity with P½ = 190 μW. A value in this range is consistent with an amino acid–based radical that is not strongly exchange-coupled to the electronic spin of a nearby paramagnetic metal. Coupling would enhance the spin-lattice relaxation for the radical and raise P½.

The isotropic diminution in spectral intensity with either increasing power or decreasing temperature is suggestive of a single organic radical rather than a distribution of species. To test whether the radical species was a tyrosyl, the protein was expressed with all of its tyrosine side chains carbon-deuterated. The deuterium nucleus has an integer spin (ID = 1) that couples weakly to the electron spin relative to the protium nucleus (IH = ½); perdeuteration consequently eliminates the doublet hyperfine splitting observed for 1H in the EPR spectra of tyrosyl radicals. Moreover, deuteration narrows the EPR peak-to-trough line width for free tyrosine from 21 to 8 G (12Barry B.A. el-Deeb M.K. Sandusky P.O. Babcock G.T.

Consistent with its assignment as a neutral tyrosyl radical, the spectrum measured for the Tyr-deuterated decarboxylase following reaction with 400 eq of H2O2 (<30 s) displayed no hyperfine features and a significantly narrowed line width (7 G) (Fig. 2D). Studies of site-specifically deuterated tyrosines have shown that the electron spin of the tyrosyl radical localizes on the ring 1, 3, and 5 carbons (12Barry B.A. el-Deeb M.K. Sandusky P.O.

Coupling of the electron spin to 1H on carbons 3 and 5 is weak and relatively insensitive to the protein environment. Doublet splitting due to each of the two methylene Cβ protons (HA and HB; Scheme 1), however, constitutes the major contributor to hyperfine structure and depends on each proton’s position relative to the pz orbital on the ring C1, according to Equation 1, AH=B0ρ+B1ρcos2θ(1) where AH is the isotropic hyperfine coupling due to Cβ-H for HA or HB, ρ is the ring carbon unpaired electron spin density (ranging over 0.35–0.42 for C1 for known protein tyrosyl radicals), and B1 is a constant (58 G for tyrosyl radicals) (12Barry B.A. el-Deeb M.K.

Inserting each of these angles and ρ = 0.35–0.42 into Equation 1 yielded predicted hyperfine coupling constants AHA = 10–12 G and AHB = 1.9–2.3 G. These ranges and g = 2.005 gave starting values for fitting the spectrum for the intermediate trapped at 30 s (Fig. S4). The fit refined to give AHA = 9.6 and AHB = 2.5 G, each of which is close to the predicted range. A small degree of g-anisotropy (g1 = 2.006, g2 = 2.005, g3 = 2.004) improved the fit, possibly reflecting small differences in the individual subunits of the homopentamer or delocalization of radical character onto other tyrosines (total of 9 per monomer). Hence, the spectrum appears to be consistent with a radical on residue Tyr-145. Accurate simulation of the X-band EPR spectrum, without making assumptions about the identity or structure of the tyrosine giving rise to the spectrum, the likely degree of g-anisotropy, or the range of values for ρ, will require further analysis of the corresponding high-field EPR spectrum, using gx to solve for θ and ρ, as described previously (19Svistunenko D.A.

Substitution of each of the latter three by redox-inactive residues had little or no effect on the number of H2O2 equivalents required to convert the enzyme–coproheme complex to heme b, although there were some differences in HPLC profiles of porphyrin-containing products versus [H2O2]. The W198F mutant, for example, accumulated relatively more harderoheme intermediate than WT, whereas the heme b product bound to Y113S was more susceptible to H2O2-mediated degradation. These differences suggested that Tyr-113, Trp-198, and Trp-157 may play some role in the coproheme/heme b conversion, but not as an essential catalytic component. The Y145S mutant, by contrast, exhibited no decarboxylase activity, regardless of the amount of H2O2 added (9Celis A.I. Gauss G.H. Streit B.R. Shisler K. Moraski G.C. Rodgers K.R. Lukat-Rodgers G.S.

Instead, after the addition of 3000 eq of H2O2, 90% of the initially present coproheme had degraded to a product without an observable UV-visible chromophore. These experiments suggested that Tyr-145 was possibly the site of a catalytic radical. To test this hypothesis and to determine whether the radical formed in a localized manner, coproheme complexes of the W198F, W157F, Y113S, and Y145S mutants were examined for their ability to form radicals during turnover with H2O2. Following reaction with 10 eq of H2O2, the W198F, W157F, and Y113S mutants formed radical species with EPR spectral features that were highly similar to each other and to WT (Fig. S4). Small discrepancies in the fitted g-values and hyperfine coupling constants suggest that the radical is sensitive to the changes in the chemical environment that these mutations produce (Table S1). Spin quantitation of the spectrum measured for the 30-s samples indicated 30, 30, and 42 μm concentrations of the radical species had formed in the W198F, W157F, and Y113S mutants (S.D. values for three measurements were ≤10% of the measured intensity). For comparison, the WT decarboxylase accumulated a 35 μm concentration of the radical species at 30 s. In each case, the radical species diminished in intensity over time, reaching ≤25% of the integrated intensity at 30 s by 150 s (Fig. 3, A–C) and receding to baseline within 300 s. By contrast, the Y145S–coproheme complex formed no appreciable radical species under the same reaction conditions. Following the addition of a large excess of H2O2 (300 eq), a small amount of an EPR-observable S = ½ species formed (3.8 μm/100 μm protein) (Fig. 3D). The peak-to-trough line width (11 G) was narrower than the spectra in Fig. 2A or Fig. 3 (A–C), the spectrum decayed to baseline more rapidly following the addition of H2O2 (within 150 s), and the spectrum measured at 30 s lacked any detectable hyperfine splitting (Fig. S5 and Table S1). Whereas the identity/nature of the radical in this mutant is currently unresolved, it is clear that this species is off the reaction pathway. The dependence of product formation on Tyr-145, the formation of an S = ½ radical whose microwave power and temperature dependences are consistent with an organic radical, and the temporal correlation of the radical decay with product formation support the conclusion that Tyr-145 is the site of a mechanistically crucial radical-based intermediate. Tyr-145• is well-positioned to remove a hydrogen atom from the coproheme propionate 2 on the carbon β to the tetrapyrrole (Fig. 1) (9Celis A.I. Gauss G.H. Streit B.R. Shisler K. Moraski G.C.

Methods We used clinical data from four high volume sites in the Interrupción Legal de Embarazo (ILE) program, 2007–2015. We used descriptive statistics to quantify the proportion of women who did not receive an abortion due to presenting past the gestational age limit. We used multivariable logistic regression to identify associations between women’s characteristics and presenting past the GA limit and calculated predicted probabilities of late presentation for key characteristics. Results Our sample included 52,391 women, 8.10% (n = 4,246) of whom did not receive abortion services due to presenting past the GA limit. Adolescents (12–17) made up 8.69% of the total sample and 13.40% of those presenting past the GA limit (p< 0.05). In multivariable analyses, all age groups of adult women had significantly lower odds than adolescents of presenting past the limit (aOR = 0.77, aOR = 0.63, aOR = 0.58 and aOR = 0.37 for 19–24, 25–29, 30–39, and > = 40 years’ old respectively). Women living in Mexico City and with higher levels of education had lower odds of presenting past the GA limit, and there was an educational gradient across all age groups. In the multivariable predicted probability models, adolescents at every level of education have significantly higher probabilities of not receiving an abortion due to presenting past the gestational age limit compared with adults (among women with a primary education: 11.75% adolescents vs. 9.02–4.26% across adult age groups). Conclusions Our results suggest that continued efforts are needed to educate women, especially younger and less educated women, about early pregnancy recognition. In addition, all women need information about the availability of first trimester legal abortion to ensure timely access to abortion services."
https://openalex.org/W2785420745,"Neurturin (NRTN) provides trophic support to neurons and is considered a therapeutic agent for neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease. It binds to its co-receptor GFRa2, and the resulting NRTN-GFRa2 complex activates the transmembrane receptors rearranged during transfection (RET) or the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM). We report the crystal structure of NRTN, alone and in complex with GFRa2. This is the first crystal structure of a GFRa with all three domains and shows that domain 1 does not interact directly with NRTN, but it may support an interaction with RET and/or NCAM, via a highly conserved surface. In addition, biophysical results show that the relative concentration of GFRa2 on cell surfaces can affect the functional affinity of NRTN through avidity effects. We have identified a heparan sulfate-binding site on NRTN and a putative binding site in GFRa2, suggesting that heparan sulfate has a role in the assembly of the signaling complex. We further show that mutant NRTN with reduced affinity for heparan sulfate may provide a route forward for delivery of NRTN with increased exposure in preclinical in vivo models and ultimately to Parkinson's patients."
https://openalex.org/W2787766562,"SINEUPs are antisense long noncoding RNAs, in which an embedded SINE B2 element UP-regulates translation of partially overlapping target sense mRNAs. SINEUPs contain two functional domains. First, the binding domain (BD) is located in the region antisense to the target, providing specific targeting to the overlapping mRNA. Second, the inverted SINE B2 represents the effector domain (ED) and enhances translation. To adapt SINEUP technology to a broader number of targets, we took advantage of a high-throughput, semi-automated imaging system to optimize synthetic SINEUP BD and ED design in HEK293T cell lines. Using SINEUP-GFP as a model SINEUP, we extensively screened variants of the BD to map features needed for optimal design. We found that most active SINEUPs overlap an AUG-Kozak sequence. Moreover, we report our screening of the inverted SINE B2 sequence to identify active sub-domains and map the length of the minimal active ED. Our synthetic SINEUP-GFP screening of both BDs and EDs constitutes a broad test with flexible applications to any target gene of interest."
https://openalex.org/W2791985135,"A major constraint in the treatment of cancer is inadequate oxygenation of the tumor mass, which can reduce chemotherapeutic efficacy. We hypothesize that polymerized human hemoglobin (PolyhHb) can be transfused into the systemic circulation to increase solid tumor oxygenation, and improve chemotherapeutic outcomes. By locking PolyhHb in the relaxed (R) quaternary state, oxygen (O2) offloading at low O2 tensions (<20 mm Hg) may be increased, while O2 offloading at high O2 tensions (>20 mm Hg) is facilitated with tense (T) state PolyhHb. Therefore, R-state PolyhHb may deliver significantly more O2 to hypoxic tissues. Biophysical parameters of T and R-state PolyhHb were used to populate a modified Krogh tissue cylinder model to assess O2 transport in a tumor. In general, we found that increasing the volume of transfused PolyhHb decreased the apparent viscosity of blood in the arteriole. In addition, we found that PolyhHb transfusion decreased the wall shear stress at large arteriole diameters (>20 μm), but increased wall shear stress for small arteriole diameters (<10 μm). Therefore, transfusion of PolyhHb may lead to elevated O2 delivery at low pO2. In addition, transfusion of R-state PolyhHb may be more effective than T-state PolyhHb for O2 delivery at similar transfusion volumes. Reduction in the apparent viscosity resulting from PolyhHb transfusion may result in significant changes in flow distributions throughout the tumor microcirculatory network. The difference in wall shear stress implies that PolyhHb may have a more significant effect in capillary beds through mechano-transduction. Periodic top-load transfusions of PolyhHb into mice bearing breast tumors confirmed the oxygenation potential of both PolyhHbs via reduced hypoxic volume, vascular density, tumor growth, and increased expression of hypoxia inducible genes. Tissue section analysis demonstrated primary PolyhHb clearance occurred in the liver and spleen indicating a minimal risk for renal damage."

Despite a large body of research, few practical and cost-effective farm-level interventions have been identified. In this study, a randomized controlled trial was conducted to assess the effect of reducing the level of water in automatically refilling water-troughs on fecal shedding of E. coli O157:H7 in feedlot cattle. Pens in a feedlot in the Texas Panhandle were randomly allocated as control (total number: 17) or intervention (total number: 18) pens. Fecal samples (2,759 in total) were collected both at baseline and three weeks after the intervention, and tested for the presence of E. coli O157:H7 using immunomagnetic bead separation and selective culture. There was a strong statistical association between sampling date and the likelihood of a fecal sample testing positive for E. coli O157:H7. Pen was also a strong predictor of fecal prevalence. Despite accounting for this high level of clustering, a statistically significant association between reduced water levels in the trough and increased prevalence of E. coli O157:H7 in the feces was observed (Odds Ratio = 1.6; 95% Confidence Interval: 1.2–2.0; Likelihood Ratio Test: p = 0.02). This is the first time that such an association has been reported, and suggests that increasing water-trough levels may be effective in reducing shedding of E. coli O157:H7 in cattle feces, although further work would be needed to test this hypothesis. Controlling E. coli O157:H7 fecal shedding at the pre-harvest level may lead to a reduced burden of human foodborne illness attributed to this pathogen in beef."
https://openalex.org/W2791891737,"Contemporary prosthetic feet are generally optimized for either daily or high-level activities. Prosthesis users, therefore, often require multiple prostheses to participate in activities that span a range of mobility. Crossover feet (XF) are designed to increase the range of activities that can be performed with a single prosthesis. However, little evidence exists to guide clinical prescription of XF relative to traditional energy storing feet (ESF). The objective of this study was to assess the effects of XF and ESF on health outcomes in people with transtibial amputation. A randomized crossover study was conducted to assess changes in laboratory-based (endurance, perceived exertion, walking performance) and community-based (step activity and self-reported mobility, fatigue, balance confidence, activity restrictions, and satisfaction) outcomes. Twenty-seven participants were fit with XF and ESF prostheses with standardized sockets, interfaces, and suspensions. Participants were not blinded to the intervention, and wore each prosthesis for one month while their steps were counted with an activity monitor. After each accommodation period, participants returned for data collection. Endurance and perceived exertion were measured with the Six-Minute Walk Test and Borg-CR100, respectively. Walking performance was measured using an electronic walkway. Self-reported mobility, fatigue, balance confidence, activity restrictions, and satisfaction were measured with survey instruments. Participants also reported foot preferences upon conclusion of the study. Differences between feet were assessed with a crossover analysis. While using XF, users experienced improvements in most community-based outcomes, including mobility (p = .001), fatigue (p = .001), balance confidence (p = .005), activity restrictions (p = .002), and functional satisfaction (p < .001). Participants also exhibited longer sound side steps in XF compared to ESF (p < .001). Most participants (89%) reported an overall preference for XF; others (11%) reported no preference. Results indicate that XF may be a promising alternative to ESF for people with transtibial amputation who engage in a range of mobility activities. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02440711"

A considerable overlap among these processes exists, but several of their key regulators remain unknown. To this end, here we investigated the role of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β in connecting these processes in glioma cells. We found that glucose starvation sensitizes glioma cells to IL-1β–induced apoptosis in a manner that depended on reactive oxygen species (ROS). Although IL-1β–induced JNK had no effect on cell viability under glucose deprivation, it mediated nuclear translocation of hexokinase 2 (HK2). This event was accompanied by increases in the levels of sirtuin 6 (SIRT6), nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2 (Nrf2), and xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR). SIRT6 not only induced ROS-mediated cell death but also facilitated nuclear Nrf2–HK2 interaction. Recruitment of the Nrf2–HK2 complex to the ARE site on XOR promoter regulated its expression. Importantly, HK2 served as transcriptional coactivator of Nrf2 to regulate XOR expression, indicated by decreased XOR levels in siRNA-mediated Nrf2 and HK2 knockdown experiments.

Moreover, IL-1β–induced HK2 in glioma is dependent on the relative abundance of HIF-1α–dependent SIRT6 levels (18Gupta P. Sheikh T. Sen E.

Furthermore, HIF-1α–dependent subcellular localization of HK2 regulates cytoskeletal organization to consequently affect MHC-I clustering under inflammatory conditions in glioma cells (19Ghosh S.

Disrupting glycolytic flux serves as a trigger for inflammation and cell death (20Sanman L.E. Qian Y. Eisele N.A. Ng T.M. van der Linden W.A. Monack D.M. Weerapana E. Bogyo M. Disruption of glycolytic flux is a signal for inflammasome signaling and pyroptotic cell death.eLife. 2016; 5 (27011353): e1366310.7554/eLife.13663Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Interestingly, glycolytic inhibitors and metabolic conditions that affect hexokinase function and localization induce inflammasome activation involved in IL-1β secretion (21Wolf A.J. Reyes C.N.

Xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR), involved in catalyzing purines to uric acid, regulates IL-1β secretion upon NLRP3 inflammasome activation (22Ives A. Nomura J. Martinon F. Roger T. LeRoy D. Miner J.N. Simon G. Busso N. So A. Xanthine oxidoreductase regulates macrophage IL1β secretion upon NLRP3 inflammasome activation.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6 (25800347): 655510.1038/ncomms7555Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Moreover, XOR is also known to regulate HIF-1α through ROS in glioma cells (23Griguer C.E. Oliva C.R. Kelley E.E. Giles G.I. Lancaster Jr, J.R. Gillespie G.Y. Xanthine oxidase-dependent regulation of hypoxia-inducible factor in cancer cells.Cancer Res. 2006; 66 (16489029): 2257-226310.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-3364Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Given that inflammation rewires energy metabolism in the tumor microenvironment (24Martinez-Outschoorn U.E. Curry J.M. Ko Y.H. Lin Z. Tuluc M. Cognetti D. Birbe R.C. Pribitkin E. Bombonati A. Pestell R.G. Howell A. Sotgia F. Lisanti M.P. Oncogenes and inflammation rewire host energy metabolism in the tumor microenvironment: RAS and NFκB target stromal MCT4.Cell Cycle. 2013; 12 (23860378): 2580-259710.4161/cc.25510Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), the prospect of targeting altered metabolism in inflammation has been suggested to have substantial therapeutic promise (25O'Neill L.A. Hardie D.G. Metabolism of inflammation limited by AMPK and pseudo-starvation.Nature. 2013; 493 (23325217): 346-35510.1038/nature11862Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). As there is a link among inflammation, metabolic status, and redox homeostasis, we investigated the effect of inflammation and glucose deprivation on oxidative stress in glioma cells. Although treatment with IL-1β or glucose deprivation alone had no effect on glioma cell viability, IL-1β triggered a significant decrease in cell viability under low-glucose conditions within 3 h (Fig. 1A). Death was accompanied by alteration in the expression of molecules associated with cell cycle progression (Fig. S1A) and an increase in cytochrome c and Bcl2 levels (Fig. S1B). Cancer cells exhibit glucose metabolism–dependent inhibition of cytochrome c–mediated apoptosis (26Huber H.J. Dussmann H. Kilbride S.M. Rehm M. Prehn J.H. Glucose metabolism determines resistance of cancer cells to bioenergetic crisis after cytochrome-c release.Mol. Syst. Biol. 2011; 7 (21364572): 47010.1038/msb.2011.2Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and glucose deprivation promotes ROS generation and death (6Graham N.A. Tahmasian M. Kohli B. Komisopoulou E. Zhu M. Vivanco I. Teitell M.A. Wu H. Ribas A. Lo R.S. Mellinghoff I.K. Mischel P.S. Graeber T.G. Glucose deprivation activates a metabolic and signaling amplification loop leading to cell death.Mol. Syst. Biol. 2012; 8 (22735335): 58910.1038/msb.2012.20Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). An increase in ROS generation was observed in glucose-deprived cells treated with IL-1β as compared with those exposed to low-glucose condition (Fig. 1B). As an elevated ROS level induces glioma cell apoptosis upon inhibition of glucose metabolism (7Dixit D. Ghildiyal R. Anto N.P. Sen E. Chaetocin-induced ROS-mediated apoptosis involves ATM-YAP1 axis and JNK-dependent inhibition of glucose metabolism.Cell Death Dis. 2014; 5 (24810048): e121210.1038/cddis.2014.179Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), we evaluated the role of elevated ROS in affecting glioma cell viability. The ability of ROS inhibitor N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) to rescue glucose-deprived cells from IL-1β–induced death suggested that apoptosis triggered by IL-1β under glucose starvation is ROS-mediated (Fig. 1C). However, pretreatment of cells with PEGylated catalase (an H2O2-decomposing enzyme) was unable to rescue death, indicating that H2O2 is not the major ROS species contributing to cell death (Fig. S1C). This was concomitant with no change in H2O2 levels in cells treated with IL-1β under glucose deprivation (Fig. S1D). We have previously demonstrated the importance of ROS-induced JNK activation in triggering glioma cell apoptosis (7Dixit D. Ghildiyal R. Anto N.P. Sen E. Chaetocin-induced ROS-mediated apoptosis involves ATM-YAP1 axis and JNK-dependent inhibition of glucose metabolism.Cell Death Dis. 2014; 5 (24810048): e121210.1038/cddis.2014.179Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). On investigating the status of JNK in IL-1β–treated glioma cells in the presence and absence of glucose, an increase in JNK phosphorylation was observed only in cells treated with IL-1β in the absence of glucose (Fig. 1D). However, JNK inhibitor SP600125 failed to rescue death in cells treated with IL-1β under conditions of glucose deprivation (Fig. 1E), suggesting non-involvement of JNK in the process. The induction of cell death in both U87MG (p53 wildtype) and T98G (p53 mutant) cell lines in response to inflammation and glucose deprivation suggested that induction of death under this condition is independent of p53 status. In addition to its function as a regulator of ROS generation (27Maksin-Matveev A. Kanfi Y. Hochhauser E. Isak A. Cohen H.Y. Shainberg A. Sirtuin 6 protects the heart from hypoxic damage.Exp. Cell Res. 2015; 330 (25066211): 81-9010.1016/j.yexcr.2014.07.013Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), SIRT6 also plays a dominant role in affecting energy balance through control of glucose homeostasis (15Zhong L. D'Urso A. Toiber D. Sebastian C. Henry R.E. Vadysirisack D.D. Guimaraes A. Marinelli B. Wikstrom J.D. Nir T. Clish C.B. Vaitheesvaran B. Iliopoulos O. Kurland I.

In addition, IL-1β increases SIRT6 levels in glioma cells (18Gupta P. Sheikh T. Sen E. SIRT6 regulated nucleosomal occupancy affects Hexokinase 2 expression.Exp. Cell Res. 2017; 357 (28478957): 98-10610.1016/j.yexcr.2017.05.005Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). An increase in SIRT6 levels was observed upon IL-1β treatment under glucose deprivation (Fig. 2A). On evaluating the contribution of elevated SIRT6 levels to IL-1β–induced death under glucose-deprived condition, viability of cells upon SIRT6 overexpression and depletion was determined. Although siRNA-mediated SIRT6 knockdown increased viability of IL-1β–treated cells under glucose deprivation (Fig. 2B), ectopic SIRT6 expression increased cell death (Fig. 2C). Given the known function of SIRT6 as a regulator of ROS generation (27Maksin-Matveev A. Kanfi Y. Hochhauser E. Isak A. Cohen H.Y. Shainberg A. Sirtuin 6 protects the heart from hypoxic damage.Exp. Cell Res. 2015; 330 (25066211): 81-9010.1016/j.yexcr.2014.07.013Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and the ability of SIRT6 to affect viability of IL-1β–treated glucose-deprived cells, ROS levels upon SIRT6 knockdown as well as overexpression were investigated. A decrease in ROS levels upon SIRT6 knockdown (Fig. 2D) and an increase upon ectopic SIRT6 expression (Fig. 2E) were observed. The increase in ROS levels was concomitant with a decrease in the expression of mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (SOD2), a critical detoxifier of mitochondrial ROS (Fig. 2F). This decrease in SOD2 levels in glucose-deprived cells treated with IL-1β was further diminished upon SIRT6 overexpression (Fig. 2F). Inhibiting HK2 activity by 2-deoxyglucose, which competitively inhibits cellular uptake and utilization of glucose, increases its nuclear localization (28Neary C.L. Pastorino J.G. Nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of hexokinase II in a cancer cell.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2010; 394 (20346347): 1075-108110.1016/j.bbrc.2010.03.129Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Because both JNK (7Dixit D. Ghildiyal R. Anto N.P. Sen E. Chaetocin-induced ROS-mediated apoptosis involves ATM-YAP1 axis and JNK-dependent inhibition of glucose metabolism.Cell Death Dis. 2014; 5 (24810048): e121210.1038/cddis.2014.179Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and SIRT6 (18Gupta P. Sheikh T. Sen E. SIRT6 regulated nucleosomal occupancy affects Hexokinase 2 expression.Exp.

Western blot analysis revealed a decrease in cytosolic (Fig. 3A) and an increase in nuclear (Fig. 3B) HK2 levels in IL-1β–treated cells upon glucose deprivation. SIRT6 enhances the expression of proinflammatory cyto-/chemokines (29Bauer I. Grozio A. Lasigliè D. Basile G. Sturla L. Magnone M. Sociali G. Soncini D. Caffa I. Poggi A. Zoppoli G. Cea M.

Reyes C.N. Liang W. Becker C. Shimada K. Wheeler M.L. Cho H.C. Popescu N.I. Coggeshall K.M. Arditi M. Underhill D.M. Hexokinase is an innate immune receptor for the detection of bacterial peptidoglycan.Cell. 2016; 166 (27374331): 624-63610.1016/j.cell.2016.05.076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). On investigating the status of NLRP3 and IL-1β in cells exhibiting heightened SIRT6 and nuclear HK2 levels, an increase in the mRNA expression of both was observed upon glucose deprivation only in the presence of IL-1β (Fig. 3C). As we have previously reported JNK-dependent regulation of HK2 in glioma cells (7Dixit D. Ghildiyal R. Anto N.P. Sen E. Chaetocin-induced ROS-mediated apoptosis involves ATM-YAP1 axis and JNK-dependent inhibition of glucose metabolism.Cell Death Dis. 2014; 5 (24810048): e121210.1038/cddis.2014.179Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and because JNK activation was dramatically elevated under conditions of increased nuclear HK2 translocation, the role of JNK in this shuttling was investigated. The IL-1β–induced increase in nuclear HK2 localization upon glucose deprivation was JNK-dependent as SP600125 prevented IL-1β–mediated HK2 accumulation in the nucleus under this condition (Fig. 3, D and E). HK2 determines cellular fate by affecting both cytoprotection and apoptosis induction based on the metabolic state (30Mergenthaler P. Kahl A. Kamitz A. van Laak V. Stohlmann K. Thomsen S. Klawitter H. Przesdzing I. Neeb L. Freyer D. Priller J. Collins T.J. Megow D. Dirnagl U.

To investigate the involvement of altered HK2 localization in affecting cell death, the viability of cells upon siRNA-mediated HK2 knockdown was determined. HK2 knockdown failed to rescue cell death (Fig. S2A), suggesting the non-involvement of HK2 in IL-1β–triggered cell death under glucose starvation. Although HK2 induces apoptosis upon glucose depletion, it is also known to protect cells from death during hypoxia (30Mergenthaler P. Kahl A. Kamitz A. van Laak V. Stohlmann K. Thomsen S. Klawitter H. Przesdzing I. Neeb L. Freyer D. Priller J. Collins T.J. Megow D. Dirnagl U.

Given the non-involvement of HK2 in death induction, we investigated whether its inability to rescue death could have stemmed from changes in HIF-1α levels. Interestingly, HK2 knockdown further heightened HIF-1α activation in IL-1β–treated cells deprived of glucose (Fig. S2B). This further confirmed our previous observation that a negative correlation exists between HK2 and HIF-1α levels in glioma cells (18Gupta P. Sheikh T. Sen E. SIRT6 regulated nucleosomal occupancy affects Hexokinase 2 expression.Exp. Cell Res. 2017; 357 (28478957): 98-10610.1016/j.yexcr.2017.05.005Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). SIRT6 regulates oxidative stress responses by serving as an Nrf2 coactivator (14Pan H. Guan D. Liu X. Li J. Wang L. Wu J. Zhou J. Zhang W. Ren R. Zhang W. Li Y. Yang J. Hao Y. Yuan T. Yuan G. et al.SIRT6 safeguards human mesenchymal stem cells from oxidative stress by coactivating NRF2.Cell Res. 2016; 26 (26768768): 190-20510.1038/cr.2016.4Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), and Nrf2 accumulation in cancer cells offers protection against oxidative stress (31Jaramillo M.C. Zhang D.D. The emerging role of the Nrf2-Keap1 signaling pathway in cancer.Genes Dev. 2013; 27 (24142871): 2179-219110.1101/gad.225680.113Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). Importantly, Nrf2 is translocated to the nucleus in response to pro-oxidant stimuli (32Theodore M. Kawai Y. Yang J. Kleshchenko Y. Reddy S.P. Villalta F. Arinze I.J. Multiple nuclear localization signals function in the nuclear import of the transcription factor Nrf2.J. Biol.

On determining Nrf2 levels in glucose-deprived IL-1β–treated cells exhibiting heightened ROS, an increase in nuclear Nrf2 levels was observed (Fig. 4A). As the increased nuclear Nrf2 level was concomitant with elevated SIRT6 levels, the role of SIRT6 in regulating Nrf2 levels was investigated. The ability of siRNA-mediated SIRT6 knockdown to decrease the nuclear Nrf2 level in glucose-deprived IL-1β–treated cells (Fig. 4B) further indicated the role of SIRT6 as a regulator of Nrf2. As the increased nuclear Nrf2 level was concomitant with increased nuclear HK2 accumulation, we investigated the association between the two. Immunoprecipitation revealed increased association between Nrf2 and HK2 under glucose-deprived conditions only in the presence of IL-1β (Fig. 4C). Moreover, not only did siRNA-mediated SIRT6 knockdown decrease the nuclear Nrf2 level in glucose-deprived IL-1β–treated cells, but it also abrogated Nrf2–HK2 interaction (Fig. 4C). These results provide strong evidence that Nrf2 is an interacting partner of HK2 and that SIRT6 is crucial in facilitating the interaction. Nuclear translocation of Nrf2 in response to oxidative stress triggers a transcriptional program through its binding to the antioxidant response element (ARE) of antioxidant genes associated with maintenance of cellular redox balance (33Malhotra D. Portales-Casamar E. Singh A. Srivastava S. Arenillas D. Happel C. Shyr C. Wakabayashi N. Kensler T.W. Wasserman W.W. Biswal S.

HK2 serves as an intracellular glucose sensor of yeast cells to affect gene regulation (34Vega M. Riera A. Fernández-Cid A. Herrero P. Moreno F. Hexokinase 2 is an intracellular glucose sensor of yeast cells that maintains the structure and activity of Mig1 repressor complex.J. Biol.

Lepidopteran females, such as the winter moth (Operophtera brumata), emit pheromones to attract males in the reproductive period. However, these chemical cues could also be eavesdropped by predators. To our knowledge, no studies have examined whether birds can detect pheromones of their prey. O. brumata adults are part of the winter diet of some insectivorous tit species, such as the great tit (Parus major) and blue tit (Cyanistes caeruleus). We performed a field experiment aimed to disentangle whether insectivorous birds can exploit the pheromones emitted by their prey for prey location. We placed artificial larvae and a dispenser on branches of Pyrenean oak trees (Quercus pyrenaica). In half of the trees we placed an O. brumata pheromone dispenser and in the other half we placed a control dispenser. We measured the predation rate of birds on artificial larvae. Our results show that more trees had larvae with signs of avian predation when they contained an O. brumata pheromone than when they contained a control dispenser. Furthermore, the proportion of artificial larvae with signs of avian predation was greater in trees that contained the pheromone than in control trees. Our results indicate that insectivorous birds can exploit the pheromones emitted by moth females to attract males, as a method of prey detection. These results highlight the potential use of insectivorous birds in the biological control of insect pests."

MinC is a dimer with each monomer consisting of functionally distinct MinCN and MinCC domains, both of which contact FtsZ. According to one model, MinCC/MinD binding to the FtsZ tail positions MinCN at the junction of two GDP-containing subunits in the filament, leading to filament breakage.

Here, we isolated minC mutations that impair MinCN function and analyzed FtsZ mutants resistant to MinC/MinD. Surprisingly, we found mutations in both minC and ftsZ that differentiate inhibition by MinC from inhibition by MinC/MinD.

ApoE proteolytic fragments are also present in the brain, but the enzymes responsible for apoE fragmentation are unknown, and the biological activity of specific apoE fragments remains to be determined. Here we utilized SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells differentiated into neurons with all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) to study extracellular apoE proteolysis. ApoE fragments were detectable in culture supernatants after 3 days, and their levels were increased for up to 9 days in the presence of ATRA.

The most abundant apoE fragments were 25- and 28-kDa N-terminal fragments that both contained sialylated glycosylation and bound to heparin. We detected apoE fragments only in the extracellular milieu and not in cell lysates, suggesting that an extracellular protease contributes to apoE fragmentation.

ApoE consists of a ∼25-kDa four-helix bundle N-terminal domain and a ∼10-kDa C-terminal domain. A short hinge region containing a single O-linked glycan separates these domains. The APOE genotype is the greatest known genetic risk factor for AD, whereby possession of one or two copies of the APOEε4 allele confers a 3- or 10-fold increase, respectively, in AD risk compared with APOEε3 homozygotes (2Corder E.H.

Although there are several postulated pathways whereby apoE may affect synaptic plasticity, axon guidance, neuron survival, Aβ homeostasis, and microtubule stability, the exact pathways by which apoE isoforms influence AD remain to be fully resolved (10Zhao N.

Previous studies indicate that lipidated apoE promotes the extracellular degradation of Aβ by insulin-degrading enzyme, targets Aβ for intracellular degradation in microglia, and facilitates Aβ clearance from the CNS via low-density lipoprotein receptor–related protein-1 (LRP1) (11Jiang Q.

It has also been reported that apoE may compete with Aβ for interaction with LRP1 (12Verghese P.B. Castellano J.M. Garai K. Wang Y. Jiang H. Shah A. Bu G. Frieden C. Holtzman D.M.

A complete understanding of the mechanisms by which apoE regulates AD risk therefore remains an unresolved question. We reported previously that apoE is proteolytically cleaved in the human brain (hippocampus, frontal cortex, and cerebellum, both gray and white matter) and that proteolytic processing of apoE3 generates a predominant stable ∼25-kDa fragment (14Elliott D.A.

The apoE 25-kDa fragment was not recognized by an apoE C-terminal antibody, and, based on the predicted sensitivity of the hinge region to proteolysis, we proposed that the apoE 25-kDa fragment represents the N-terminal four-helix bundle that contains the LDL receptor binding domain (14Elliott D.A.

As it is possible that apoE fragments, particularly the stable 25-kDa fragment (14Elliott D.A. Tsoi K. Holinkova S. Chan S.L. Kim W.S. Halliday G.M. Rye K.A. Garner B. Isoform-specific proteolysis of apolipoprotein-E in the brain.Neurobiol.

As mentioned above, astrocytes are the main source of apoE in the CNS under normal physiological conditions. However, the cell types responsible for the generation of the apoE 25-kDa fragment are unknown. Previous data suggest that a neuronal chymotrypsin-like protease or aspartic protease may be involved in apoE proteolytic fragmentation (19Harris F.M. Brecht W.J. Xu Q. Tesseur I. Kekonius L.

Either endogenous neuronal apoE or endocytosed apoE may be processed in the neuron and (re-)secreted as apoE proteolytic fragments. Of potential relevance, apoE re-secretion pathways have been described, at least in cells from peripheral tissues (21Heeren J. Grewal T. Jäckle S. Beisiegel U. Recycling of apolipoprotein E and lipoprotein lipase through endosomal compartments in vivo.J. Biol.

It may also be possible that neurons secrete apoE along with a protease that together result in extracellular apoE fragmentation or that apoE that is normally constitutively secreted by astrocytes (or microglia) is cleaved by a secreted neuronal protease. Consistent with the latter idea, rat hippocampal neurons secrete a serine protease that generates apoE proteolytic fragments with a very similar Mr profile to the fragments seen in human post-mortem brain samples (9Tamboli I.Y. Heo D. Rebeck G.W. Extracellular proteolysis of apolipoprotein E (apoE) by secreted serine neuronal protease.PLoS One. 2014; 9 (24675880)e9312010.1371/journal.pone.0093120Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Although the identity of the secreted enzyme responsible for the production of apoE proteolytic fragments by rat hippocampal neurons was not identified (9Tamboli I.Y. Heo D. Rebeck G.W. Extracellular proteolysis of apolipoprotein E (apoE) by secreted serine neuronal protease.PLoS One. 2014; 9 (24675880)e9312010.1371/journal.pone.0093120Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), a serine protease, high-temperature requirement serine peptidase A1 (HtrA1) has recently been shown to cleave recombinant apoE into fragments, including a predominant N-terminal apoE 25-kDa fragment (22Chu Q.

Heo D. Rebeck G.W. Extracellular proteolysis of apolipoprotein E (apoE) by secreted serine neuronal protease.PLoS One. 2014; 9 (24675880)e9312010.1371/journal.pone.0093120Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 14Elliott D.A.

In the present study, we examined apoE proteolytic fragmentation using the human SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cell line. This study provides a cellular model to assess apoE proteolysis, shows that HtrA1 regulates apoE 25-kDa fragment formation under physiological conditions, and reveals a new neurotrophic function for the apoE 25-kDa fragment. The SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cell line is an established in vitro model for human neurobiology studies. Chronic treatment of SK-N-SH cells with all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) induces a post-mitotic neuronal phenotype with cell monolayers containing a dense neurite network (23Preis P.N. Saya H. Nádasdi L. Hochhaus G. Levin V. Sadée W.

Biedler J.L. Ross R.A. Phenotypic diversification in human neuroblastoma cells: expression of distinct neural crest lineages.Cancer Res. 1989; 49 (2535691): 219-225PubMed Google Scholar). We examined the secretion of apoE from SK-N-SH cells and the possible influence of ATRA-mediated neuronal differentiation. Under standard culture conditions, apoE was clearly detected in cell-conditioned medium (Fig. 1A). Although the majority of apoE (∼80%) was present as full-length apoE, after 3 days in culture, small amounts of apoE fragments were also detected (Fig. 1). Treatment with ATRA time-dependently induced the production of apoE and also strongly increased the production of apoE fragments. Analysis of the apoE size distribution profiles indicated that apoE fragments at 25 and 28 kDa were produced at high levels with ATRA treatment (Fig. 1). After 9 days of ATRA treatment, the levels of the dominant apoE 28- and 25-kDa fragments were increased by ∼30% and 6-fold, respectively (Fig. 1B). There was very little change in the formation of apoE fragments by cells that were cultured for up to 9 days in the absence of ATRA (Fig. S1). In addition, examination of the full-length Western blots indicated that small amounts of apoE fragment at 30 kDa were detectable, and traces of fragments at a mass < 25 kDa (i.e. at ∼21, ∼15, and ∼12 kDa) were also detectable in the cell culture supernatants (Fig. S2). To assess the temporal association of apoE production with the development of the SK-N-SH neuronal phenotype, we analyzed cell lysates for apoE and for markers of synapse formation (PSD95) and neurite formation (SMI32). As expected, ATRA strongly increased PSD95 and SMI32 levels over the 9-day experiment (Fig. 2A). Phase-contrast images confirmed that the changes in these differentiation markers were associated with the development of a more neuronal phenotype (Fig. 2D). Consistent with the data in Fig. 1, cellular apoE levels were also time-dependently up-regulated by ATRA treatment (Fig. 2B). Intracellular apoE was detected as a doublet or triplet band that is consistent with previous studies of intracellular apoE maturation and glycosylation (25Zannis V.I. McPherson J. Goldberger G. Karathanasis S.K. Breslow J.L. Synthesis, intracellular processing, and signal peptide of human apolipoprotein E.J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259 (6325438): 5495-5499Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, no apoE fragmentation products were detected in cell lysates at any of the time points examined, in either the presence or absence of ATRA (Fig. S3). These data indicate that apoE is up-regulated in concert with ATRA-induced neuronal differentiation and suggest that apoE proteolytic fragmentation may only occur in the extracellular compartment. Based on our previous results from post-mortem human brain tissue (14Elliott D.A. Tsoi K. Holinkova S. Chan S.L. Kim W.S. Halliday G.M. Rye K.A. Garner B.

Aging. 2011; 32 (19278755): 257-27110.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2009.02.006Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), we predicted that the apoE 25–28-kDa fragments generated by ATRA-treated SK-N-SH cells may be N-terminal fragments. A protease-susceptible hinge domain separates the apoE N-terminal and C-terminal domains (Fig. 3A), and this is predicted to contain a number of enzyme cut sites. Using apoE N terminus–specific and C terminus–specific antibodies (recognizing residues 141–160 and 285–299, respectively), we confirmed that the two quantitatively dominant apoE fragments at 28 and 25 kDa were N-terminal fragments (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, the apoE N-terminal fragments both strongly bound to heparin (Fig. 3C), consistent with the known N-terminal heparin-binding domain comprising residues 143–146 (26Saito H. Dhanasekaran P. Nguyen D. Baldwin F. Weisgraber K.H. Wehrli S. Phillips M.C. Lund-Katz S. Characterization of the heparin binding sites in human apolipoprotein E.J. Biol.

These apoE fragments were also reduced slightly in Mr after treatment with neuraminidase, consistent with cleavage of terminal sialic acid residues from the O-linked glycan at Thr194 (Fig. 3D). The calculated molecular mass of the apoE N-terminal peptide, including Thr194, is 22,373 Da. Although the degree of CNS apoE sialylation is variable (25Zannis V.I. McPherson J. Goldberger G. Karathanasis S.K. Breslow J.L. Synthesis, intracellular processing, and signal peptide of human apolipoprotein E.J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259 (6325438): 5495-5499Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using the mass of one of the most abundant apoE O-glycan species at Thr194 (i.e. HexNAc-Hex(NeuAc)2) of 947 Da (27Nilsson J. Rüetschi U. Halim A. Hesse C. Carlsohn E. Brinkmalm G. Larson G. Enrichment of glycopeptides for glycan structure and attachment site identification.Nat. Methods. 2009; 6 (19838169): 809-81110.1038/nmeth.1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), the minimum predicted mass of a glycosylated apoE N-terminal fragment (residues 1–194) would therefore be ∼23.3 kDa (i.e. predicted to migrate to a position just below the 25-kDa PAGE marker protein, which is where the apoE 25-kDa fragment is detected) (Fig. 3B). To gain mechanistic information related to the extracellular formation of apoE N-terminal fragments, a selection of protease inhibitors was added to 9-day ATRA-differentiated SK-N-SH cell cultures for a period of 24 h. It is important to note that the degree of apoE fragmentation detected over the 24-h period used in these experiments is much lower than observed with 3-day culture periods (compare Fig. 4 (A and D) with Fig. 1A). The 24-h period was used to minimize nonspecific effects that the protease inhibitors may have on cellular metabolism. The presence of a broad-spectrum protease inhibitor mixture inhibited the formation of the major apoE N-terminal fragments at 25 kDa by 75% (p = 0.0002) and at 28 kDa by 75% (p = 0.0007) (Fig. 4, A and C, respectively), whereas the levels of full-length secreted or intracellular apoE were unaffected (Fig. 4, A–C). Similarly, the serine protease inhibitor 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride (AEBSF) inhibited the formation of the major apoE N-terminal fragments at 25 kDa by 81% (p = 0.0134) and at 28 kDa by 87% (p = 0.0033) (Fig. 4, D and F), whereas the levels of full-length apoE were unaffected (Fig. 4, D–F). These results suggest that an extracellular serine protease contributes to the production of apoE N-terminal fragments. These results are consistent with a previous study using rat hippocampal neuron-conditioned medium and exogenously added apoE in the presence or absence of a protease inhibitor mixture or the serine protease inhibitor phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (9Tamboli I.Y. Heo D. Rebeck G.W. Extracellular proteolysis of apolipoprotein E (apoE) by secreted serine neuronal protease.PLoS One. 2014; 9 (24675880)e9312010.1371/journal.pone.0093120Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In a recent study using recombinant proteins, the serine protease HtrA1 was shown to produce apoE N-terminal fragments in an apoE isoform–dependent manner (22Chu Q. Diedrich J.K. Vaughan J.M. Donaldson C.J. Nunn M.F. Lee K.F. Saghatelian A. HtrA1 proteolysis of ApoE in vitro is allele selective.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2016; 138 (27379525): 9473-947810.1021/jacs.6b03463Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Indeed, the HtrA1-mediated proteolysis of recombinant apoE3 produced a major apoE N-terminal fragment of ∼25 kDa that was shown to encompass amino acid residues 1–195 (22Chu Q. Diedrich J.K. Vaughan J.M. Donaldson C.J. Nunn M.F. Lee K.F. Saghatelian A. HtrA1 proteolysis of ApoE in vitro is allele selective.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2016; 138 (27379525): 9473-947810.1021/jacs.6b03463Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, in these studies, larger fragments of apoE (e.g. 28 kDa) were not generated (22Chu Q. Diedrich J.K. Vaughan J.M. Donaldson C.J. Nunn M.F. Lee K.F. Saghatelian A. HtrA1 proteolysis of ApoE in vitro is allele selective.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2016; 138 (27379525): 9473-947810.1021/jacs.6b03463Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the apoE 25-kDa fragment was more rapidly degraded further by HtrA1 to smaller fragments when the apoE4 recombinant protein was assessed, as compared with apoE3 recombinant protein (22Chu Q. Diedrich J.K. Vaughan J.M. Donaldson C.J. Nunn M.F. Lee K.F. Saghatelian A. HtrA1 proteolysis of ApoE in vitro is allele selective.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2016; 138 (27379525): 9473-947810.1021/jacs.6b03463Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This result is strikingly similar to what has been observed in human post-mortem brain tissues, in which carriers of the APOEε3/3 genotype had increased levels of the apoE 25-kDa fragment as compared with APOEε4/4 carriers (14Elliott D.A. Tsoi K. Holinkova S. Chan S.L. Kim W.S. Halliday G.M. Rye K.A. Garner B. Isoform-specific proteolysis of apolipoprotein-E in the brain.Neurobiol.

To test for a possible contribution of HtrA1 in the SK-N-SH–mediated production of the apoE N-terminal 25-kDa fragment, we first assessed the expression of HtrA1 in SK-N-SH cells. Quantitative RT-PCR indicated that HTRA1 mRNA was present in SK-N-SH cells under standard culture conditions and that levels were time-dependently increased by 7.4-fold (p = 0.0003) after 9 days in culture in the presence of ATRA (Fig. S4). This was also confirmed using standard semiquantitative PCR, where a 3.8-fold (p = 0.0003) up-regulation of HTRA1 mRNA level was observed (Fig. S5A). We also detected extracellular HtrA1 protein and found that the levels were significantly increased after 9 days in culture with ATRA treatment (Fig. S5). The HtrA1 Western blots identified two HtrA1 species at ∼50 and 38 kDa (Fig. S5D). This is consistent with previous studies that have shown that the 38 kDa band is an autocatalytic product of the full-length 50-kDa HtrA1 protein (28Lorenzi T. Lorenzi M. Altobelli E. Marzioni D. Mensà E. Quaranta A. Paolinelli F. Morroni M. Mazzucchelli R. De Luca A. Procopio A.D. Baldi A. Muzzonigro G. Montironi R. Castellucci M.

Overall, SK-N-SH–secreted HtrA1 protein levels were increased by 2.1-fold (p = 0.0002) after 9 days in culture with ATRA (Fig. S5B). To assess the role of HtrA1 in the SK-N-SH–mediated production of the apoE N-terminal 25-kDa fragment, we used an siRNA approach. HTRA1 mRNA levels were reduced by >90% relative to both vehicle control and scrambled siRNA (both p < 0.0001) following transfection of the cells with HTRA1 siRNA (Fig. 5, A and B). Similarly, extracellular HtrA1 protein levels w"

The pathogenesis of EHV-8 is relatively little studied and to date has only been associated with respiratory disease in donkeys in Australia and horses in China. A single EHV-8 genome sequence has been generated for strain Wh in China, but is apparently incomplete and contains frameshifts in two genes. In this study, the complete genome sequences of four EHV-8 strains isolated in Ireland between 2003 and 2015 were determined by Illumina sequencing. Two of these strains were isolated from cases of abortion in horses, and were misdiagnosed initially as EHV-1, and two were isolated from donkeys, one with neurological disease. The four genome sequences are very similar to each other, exhibiting greater than 98.4% nucleotide identity, and their phylogenetic clustering together demonstrated that genomic diversity is not dependent on the host. Comparative genomic analysis revealed 24 of the 76 predicted protein sequences are completely conserved among the Irish EHV-8 strains. Evolutionary comparisons indicate that EHV-8 is phylogenetically closer to EHV-9 than it is to EHV-1. In summary, the first complete genome sequences of EHV-8 isolates from two host species over a twelve year period are reported. The current study suggests that EHV-8 can cause abortion in horses. The potential threat of EHV-8 to the horse industry and the possibility that donkeys may act as reservoirs of infection warrant further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2787819575,"Apoptosis is mediated through the extrinsic or intrinsic pathway. Key regulators of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway are the family of B cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) proteins. The activity of the prototypical Bcl-2 protein is usually considered antiapoptotic. However, under some conditions, Bcl-2 associates with the orphan nuclear hormone receptors Nur77 and Nor-1, converting Bcl-2 into a proapoptotic molecule. Expression of Nur77 and Nor-1 is induced by a variety of signals, including those leading to apoptosis. Translocation of Nur77/Nor-1 to mitochondria results in their association with Bcl-2, exposing the Bcl-2 homology (BH) 3 domain and causing apoptosis. However, the molecular details of this interaction are incompletely understood. Here, through extensive Bcl-2 mutagenesis and functional assays, we identified residues within Bcl-2 that are essential for its interaction with Nur77/Nor-1. Although an initial report has suggested that an unstructured loop region between the Bcl-2 BH4 and BH3 domains is required for Bcl-2’s interaction with Nur77/Nor-1, we found that it is dispensable for this interaction. Instead, we found important interacting residues at the BH4 domain and crucial interacting residues between the BH1 and BH2 domains. Bcl-2 alanine mutants at this region could no longer interact with Nur77/Nor-1 and could not initiate Nur77/Bcl-2–mediated cell death. However, they still retained their anti-apoptotic capability in two different death assays. These results establish crucial residues in Bcl-2 required for Nur77/Nor-1–mediated apoptosis and point to potential new strategies for manipulating Bcl-2 function.

https://openalex.org/W2786856960,"Inflammasomes are cytosolic complexes that mature and secrete the inflammatory cytokines interleukin 1β (IL-1β) and IL-18 and induce pyroptosis. The NLRP3 (NACHT, LRR, and PYD domains-containing protein 3) inflammasome detects many pathogen- and danger-associated molecular patterns, and reactive oxygen species (ROS)/reactive nitrogen species (RNS) have been implicated in its activation. The phenazine pyocyanin (PCN) is a virulence factor of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and generates superoxide in cells. Here we report that PCN inhibits IL-1β and IL-18 release and pyroptosis upon NLRP3 inflammasome activation in macrophages by preventing speck formation and Caspase-1 maturation. Of note, PCN did not regulate the AIM2 (absent in melanoma 2) or NLRC4 inflammasomes or tumor necrosis factor (TNF) secretion. Imaging of the fluorescent glutathione redox potential sensor Grx1-roGFP2 indicated that PCN provokes cytosolic and nuclear but not mitochondrial redox changes. PCN-induced intracellular ROS/RNS inhibited the NLRP3 inflammasome posttranslationally, and hydrogen peroxide or peroxynitrite alone were sufficient to block its activation. We propose that cytosolic ROS/RNS inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome and that PCN's anti-inflammatory activity may help P. aeruginosa evade immune recognition."
https://openalex.org/W2794195170,"The rates of opioid prescription and use have continued to increase over the last few decades resulting in a greater number of opioid tolerant patients. Treatment of acute pain from surgery and injury is a clinical challenge for these patients. Several pain management strategies including prescribing increased opioids are used clinically with limited success; all currently available strategies have significant limitations. Many opioids are a substrate for p-glycoprotein (p-gp), an efflux transporter at the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Increased p-gp is associated with a decreased central nervous system uptake and analgesic efficacy of morphine. Our laboratory previously found that acute peripheral inflammatory pain (PIP) induces p-gp trafficking from the nucleus to the luminal surface of endothelial cells making up the BBB concomitant with increased p-gp activity and decreased morphine analgesic efficacy. In the current study, we tested whether PIP-induced p-gp trafficking could contribute to decreased opioid efficacy in morphine tolerant rats. A 6-day continuous dosing of morphine from osmotic minipumps was used to establish morphine tolerance in female rats. PIP induced p-gp trafficking away from nuclear stores showed a 2-fold increase in morphine tolerant rats. This observation suggests that p-gp trafficking contributes to the decreased morphine analgesic effects in morphine tolerant rats experiencing an acute pain stimulus. Attenuating p-gp trafficking during an acute pain stimulus could improve pain management by increasing the amount of opioid that could reach CNS analgesic targets and decrease the need for the dose escalation that is a serious challenge in pain management."

Guided by our previous results and a computer-generated domain-docking model, we assessed the importance of cross-domain charge interactions in the FMN-to-heme electron transfer in neuronal NOS (nNOS). We reversed the charge of three residues (Glu-762, Glu-816, and Glu-819) that form an electronegative triad on the FMN domain and then individually reversed the charges of three electropositive residues (Lys-423, Lys-620, and Lys-660) on the oxygenase domain (NOSoxy), to potentially restore a cross-domain charge interaction with the triad, but in reversed polarity. Charge reversal of the triad completely eliminated heme reduction and NO synthesis in nNOS. These functions were partly restored by the charge reversal at oxygenase residue Lys-423, but not at Lys-620 or Lys-660. Full recovery of heme reduction was probably muted by an accompanying change in FMN midpoint potential that made electron transfer to the heme thermodynamically unfavorable.

https://openalex.org/W2786645207,"Microfluidics are routinely used to study cellular properties, including the efficient quantification of single-cell biomechanics and label-free cell sorting based on the biomechanical properties, such as elasticity, viscosity, stiffness, and adhesion. Both quantification and sorting applications require optimal design of the microfluidic devices and mathematical modeling of the interactions between cells, fluid, and the channel of the device. As a first step toward building such a mathematical model, we collected video recordings of cells moving through a ridged microfluidic channel designed to compress and redirect cells according to cell biomechanics. We developed an efficient algorithm that automatically and accurately tracked the cell trajectories in the recordings. We tested the algorithm on recordings of cells with different stiffness, and showed the correlation between cell stiffness and the tracked trajectories. Moreover, the tracking algorithm successfully picked up subtle differences of cell motion when passing through consecutive ridges. The algorithm for accurately tracking cell trajectories paves the way for future efforts of modeling the flow, forces, and dynamics of cell properties in microfluidics applications."

These various functions of CS are attributed to its structural diversity. chondroitin sulfate dermatan sulfate GlcUAβ1–3GalNAc(4S,6S) hyaluronic acid glycosaminoglycan hexuronic acid Δ4,5-unsaturated hexuronic acid 2-O-sulfate 4-O-sulfate 6-O-sulfate chondroitinase 2-aminobenzamide l-iduronic acid HA and CS lyase CS-E–resisted HA/CS lyase recombinant HCLase Er. The backbone of the CS chain is composed of repeating disaccharide units of glucuronic acid (GlcUA) and N-acetyl-d-galactosamine (GalNAc) and is further modified by specific sulfotransferases at C-2 of GlcUA/l-iduronic acid and/or C-4 and/or C-6 of GalNAc to yield substantial structural diversity via differential sulfation patterns (18Mikami T.

Moreover, some GlcUA residues are epimerized into l-iduronic acid residues (IdoUA) by glucuronyl C-5 epimerase, and correspondingly, the chain containing repeating disaccharide units of -IdoUA-GalNAc- is designated dermatan sulfate (DS) (20Silbert J.E. Sugumaran G. Biosynthesis of chondroitin/dermatan sulfate.IUBMB Life. 2002; 54 (12512856): 177-18610.1080/15216540214923Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 21Maccarana M. Olander B.

Thus, CS and DS often exist in a single chain in a hybrid form (CS-DS) and are usually periodically distributed in a cell/tissue-specific manner. Several different sulfation modifications by a number of sulfotransferases result in the creation of a variety of CS disaccharide units, such as the O unit (GlcUAβ1–3GalNAc), the A unit (GlcUAβ1–3GalNAc(4S)), the C unit (GlcUAβ1–3GalNAc(6S)), the D unit (GlcUA(2S)β1–3GalNAc(6S)), the E unit (GlcUAβ1–3GalNAc(4S,6S)), and the T unit (GlcUA(2S)β1-3GalNAc(4S,6S)), where 2S, 4S, and 6S represent 2-O-, 4-O-, and 6-O-sulfate groups, respectively. CS chains containing the E unit have been found in mammalian tissues, including brain, liver, spleen, kidney, and malignant tumors, and they have been shown to be involved in various physiological and pathological processes through interactions with various growth factors or chemokines (22Sugahara K.

Compared with the complexity of polysaccharides, CS-E oligosaccharides are much more homogeneous in size and structure, which will greatly exclude the ambiguity of polysaccharides in a specific bioactivity, and they are more easily absorbed and utilized due to their low molecular mass. Thus, the ability to selectively prepare E unit–rich oligosaccharides from CS-E polysaccharides will be critical for the development of CS therapeutic agents. Various CS/DS-degrading enzymes from bacteria have been used for the structure–function studies and oligosaccharide preparations of CS/DS polysaccharides (33Sugahara K. Nadanaka S. Takeda K.

However, to date, no enzyme has been found that can effectively digest CS/DS domains/chains without degrading E unit–rich sequences and thereby selectively preserve E unit–rich oligosaccharides in the digests of polysaccharides. In this study, an endolytic GAG lyase was identified from a marine bacterium Vibrio sp. FC509. This enzyme efficiently digests HA, CS-A, CS-C, and CS-D into disaccharides but only partially degrades CS-E. Further study showed that the presence of an E unit, and particularly consecutive E units, is a strong resistant structure of the activity of this enzyme. Notably, this enzyme is the first to be identified with activity that is specifically inhibited by both 4-O- and 6-O-sulfation of GalNAc, and it will serve as a very useful tool for structure–function studies and bioactive oligosaccharide preparations of E unit-containing CS/DS. The putative GAG-degrading gene named hclase er (GenBankTM accession number MF458894) was 2973 bp in length and had a GC content of 50.6%. The predicted full-length protein was composed of 990 amino acid residues with a theoretical molecular mass of 108.4 kDa and an isoelectric point of 5.34. The Simple Modular Architecture Research Tool (SMART), SignalP 4.0, and LipoP 1.0 analyses indicated that HCLase Er contained a type I signal peptide composed of 21 amino acid residues at its N terminus.

A BLASTp search showed that HCLase Er shared a sequence identity of higher than 30% with a number of putative chondroitinases from bacteria such as the Vibrio, Bacteroides, Indibacter, Flavobacterium, and Pedobacter strains. However, of the proteins identified, HCLase Er shared the highest percentages of sequence identity (34%) with a chondroitinase AC lyase from Flavobacterium heparinum (36Féthière J. Eggimann B.

Notably, compared with the two identified GAG lyases, chondroitinase AC (ACU03008.1) and HCLase (AIL54323.1), there are two long extra fragments (Gly739–Gln796 and Val816–Lys990) at the C terminus of HCLase Er protein (Fig. 1B). The full-length sequence of the HCLase Er open reading frame was amplified directly from the genomic DNA of Vibrio sp. FC509. The PCR product was recovered and cloned into the pET-30a(+) vector after a T7 promoter. In this HCLase Er expression vector (pE30a-rHCLase Er), a His6 tag was added at the C terminus. SDS-PAGE analysis indicated that after induction with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, E. coli BL21(DE3) cells harboring the pE30-rHCLase Er plasmid could form soluble products (∼200 mg/liter) with a correct molecular mass of 108 kDa. The crude enzymes were extracted from the cultures of host cells by sonication and centrifugation. The recombinant enzymes were further purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid–affinity chromatography. As shown in Fig. 2, SDS-PAGE showed that the rHCLase Er protein could be eluted from the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column using a gradient of imidazole concentrations ranging from 50 to 250 mm. The molecular mass of the purified protein was consistent with the theoretical molecular mass, and the purified protein had a purity of >99%. The purified rHCLase Er was able to degrade HA, CS-A, CS-C, CS-D, and CS-E to produce oligosaccharides with an absorbance at 232 nm, which is characteristic of typical unsaturated oligosaccharides. However, rHCLase Er had no effect on DS and heparin (data not shown). These results showed that the HCLase Er protein was a GAG lyase with specificity to HA and CS. The rHCLase Er enzyme showed optimal activity at a temperature of 30 °C when either HA or CS-C was used as the substrate, and its activity rate rapidly decreased at temperatures higher than 30 °C, suggesting that this enzyme is temperature-sensitive, especially in the high-temperature region from 40 to 100 °C (Fig. 3A). The effects of pH on the reaction rate of rHCLase Er were investigated at the optimal temperature of 30 °C, and the results showed that the optimal pH was 8.0 when either HA or CS-C was used as the substrate, whereas the rate of enzymatic activity was much higher in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer than in 50 mm NaH2PO4·Na2HPO4 buffer (Fig. 3B). Moreover, the enzyme also exhibited pH sensitivity, and the activity was completely abolished at the outlying pH values of 5.0 and 10.0. To determine the effects of metal ions on the enzymatic activity, various metal ions were added to the basic reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)), and the reaction rate of rHCLase Er was measured at 30 °C. As shown in Fig. 3C, no metal ion exhibited a significant enhancing effect; however, most of the tested metal ions, such as Ag+, Co2+, Hg2+, Ni2+, Mn2+, Zn2+, and Pb3+, strongly inhibited the enzymatic activity. Additionally, the chelating regent EDTA exhibited no significant effect. The thermostability of this enzyme was assayed under the optimal conditions; the rate of HCLase Er activity gradually declined from 100 to 60% during 12 h, indicative of mild stability (Fig. 3D). Interestingly, this enzyme did not show a halophilic characteristic as previously found for HCLase (34Han W. Wang W. Zhao M. Sugahara K. Li F. A novel eliminase from a marine bacterium that degrades hyaluronan and chondroitin sulfate.J. Biol.

Under the optimal conditions of 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0) at 30 °C, the specific activity of rHCLase Er was measured using HA and various types of commercial CS variants as described under “Experimental procedures.” The specific activity of rHCLase Er using HA, CS-A, CS-C, CS-D, and CS-E was 13.8, 7.2, 6.7, 5.9, and 0.76 units/mg protein, respectively (Table 1). Notably, the activity of rHCLase Er against CS-E was relatively low compared with its activity against other CS variants. This result indicates that CS-E contains structures that confer resistance against digestion by rHCLase Er.Table 1Activity analysis for rHCLase Er and its mutantsrHCLase ErrHCLase Er-T815rHCLase Er-H243A, -Y252A, -R306A, -R310A, -T738, -T756units/mgunits/mgunits/mgHA13.812.9NDaND means not detected.CS-A7.27.3NDCS-C6.76.6NDCS-D5.95.7NDCS-E0.760.63NDa ND means not detected. Open table in a new tab To determine the action pattern of rHCLase Er against polysaccharides, the degradation of HA or CS-A (1 mg/ml) by rHCLase Er (0.03 unit/ml) was monitored at 30 °C. The digestion of HA (Fig. 4A) and CS-A (Fig. 4B) was tested at 0, 5, 10, and 30 min and 1 and 2 h. The digests were loaded onto a SuperdexTM peptide 10/300GL column and monitored by measuring the absorbance at 232 nm. Whenever HA or CS-A was used as the substrate, rHCLase Er initially produced higher molecular mass oligosaccharides followed by smaller oligomers with strong absorbance at 232 nm, suggesting that the HCLase Er protein is a GAG endolyase. Furthermore, commercial HA, CS-A, CS-C, CS-D, and CS-E were exhaustively digested with rHCLase Er to determine their final products. The resulting oligosaccharides were analyzed and assigned by gel-filtration analysis using HA- and CS-derived authentic unsaturated oligosaccharides. As shown in Fig. 5, non-sulfated and monosulfated disaccharides were the main final products for HA (Fig. 5A) and CS-A (Fig. 5B), respectively. The digests of CS-C (Fig. 5C) and CS-D (Fig. 5D) resulted in two main disaccharide peaks corresponding to monosulfated and disulfated disaccharides. However, only a small amount of monosulfated disaccharide as well as larger oligosaccharides was detected from the digest of commercial CS-E (Fig. 5E), which suggested that specific structures in CS-E might inhibit the enzymatic activity. Furthermore, the main final products of HA and CS-A were collected and analyzed by MS spectrometry as described under “Experimental procedures.” The detected major signals at m/z at 378.1029 and 458.0557 could be assigned by mass calculation to non-sulfated unsaturated Δ4,5HexUA-GlcNAc and monosulfated Δ4,5HexUA-GalNAc(4S), respectively, which confirmed that HCLase Er is a lyase cleaving GAG chains via β-elimination mechanism. To confirm the finding that the specific structure in CS-E might be resistant to the enzyme activity, commercial CS-E was degraded by commercial CSase ABC and a new HA/CS lyase HCLase identified from the same bacterium Vibrio sp. FC509 (34Han W. Wang W. Zhao M. Sugahara K. Li F. A novel eliminase from a marine bacterium that degrades hyaluronan and chondroitin sulfate.J. Biol.

The results clearly showed that CS-E could be completely digested into disaccharides with one or two sulfates by CSase ABC and HCLase but not by HCLase Er (Fig. 6). The E units (GlcUAβ1–3GalNAc(4S,6S)) are the major component (>60%) in the disaccharide composition of CS-E from squid cartilage (Seikagaku Corp.). Considering this unique structural feature, we speculated that E units might play a key role in the resistance of CS-E to HCLase Er action. To test this speculation, a preparation of low-sulfated CS-E polysaccharide from Dosidicus gigas cartilage, which contained ∼39% of E units (Table 2), was used as the substrate for digestion by HCLase Er. In a time-course experiment, we could see that the low-sulfated CS-E was gradually cut into a series of low-molecular-mass oligosaccharides over time (Fig. 7). However, we noted that the profile of the chromatogram showed no significant change after digestion for 48 h, and it still showed many peaks, indicating the presence of oligosaccharides larger in size than disaccharides even after digestion for 72 h.

https://openalex.org/W2790451877,"The reduced number of animals in most wild felid populations implies a loss of genetic diversity. The death of juveniles, prior to the production of mature sperm, represents a loss of potential genetic contribution to future populations. Since 2011 mouse testicular organ culture has introduced an alternative mechanism to produce sperm in vitro from immature tissue. However, extension of this technology to other species has remained limited. We have used the domestic cat (Felis catus) as a model for wild felids to investigate spermatogenesis initiation and regulation, with the mouse serving as a control species. Testicular tissue fragments were cultured in control medium or medium supplemented with knockout serum replacement (KSR), AlbuMax, beta-estradiol or AlbuMax plus beta-estradiol. Contrary to expectations, and unlike results obtained in mouse controls, no germ cell differentiation could be detected. The only germ cells observed after six weeks of culture were spermatogonia regardless of the initial stage of tubule development in the donor tissue. Moreover, the number of spermatogonia decreased with time in culture in all media tested, especially in the medium supplemented with KSR, while AlbuMax had a slight protective effect. The combination of AlbuMax and beta-estradiol led to an increase in the area occupied by seminiferous tubules, and thus to an increase in total number of spermatogonial cells. Considering all the media combinations tested the stimulus for felid germ cell differentiation in this type of system seems to be different from the mouse. Studies using other triggers of differentiation and tissue survival factors should be performed to pursue this technology for the genetic diversity preservation in wild felids."

https://openalex.org/W2785600517,"In all domains of life, proteasomes are gated, chambered proteases that require opening by activators to facilitate protein degradation. Twelve proteasome accessory factor E (PafE) monomers assemble into a single dodecameric ring that promotes proteolysis required for the full virulence of the human bacterial pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Whereas the best characterized proteasome activators use ATP to deliver proteins into a proteasome, PafE does not require ATP. Here, to unravel the mechanism of PafE-mediated protein targeting and proteasome activation, we studied the interactions of PafE with native substrates, including a newly identified proteasome substrate, the ParA-like protein, Rv3213c, and with proteasome core particles. We characterized the function of a highly conserved feature in bacterial proteasome activator proteins: a glycine–glutamine–tyrosine–leucine (GQYL) motif at their C termini that is essential for stimulating proteolysis. Using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), we found that the GQYL motif of PafE interacts with specific residues in the α subunits of the proteasome core particle to trigger gate opening and degradation. Finally, we also found that PafE rings have 40-A openings lined with hydrophobic residues that form a chamber for capturing substrates before they are degraded, suggesting PafE has a previously unrecognized chaperone activity. In summary, we have identified the interactions between PafE and the proteasome core particle that cause conformational changes leading to the opening of the proteasome gate and have uncovered a mechanism of PafE-mediated substrate degradation. Collectively, our results provide detailed insights into the mechanism of ATP-independent proteasome degradation in bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2787795052,"For nearly 30 years, coenzyme M (CoM) was assumed to be present solely in methanogenic archaea. In the late 1990s, CoM was reported to play a role in bacterial propene metabolism, but no biosynthetic pathway for CoM has yet been identified in bacteria. Here, using bioinformatics and proteomic approaches in the metabolically versatile bacterium Xanthobacter autotrophicus Py2, we identified four putative CoM biosynthetic enzymes encoded by the xcbB1, C1, D1, and E1 genes. Only XcbB1 was homologous to a known CoM biosynthetic enzyme (ComA), indicating that CoM biosynthesis in bacteria involves enzymes different from those in archaea. We verified that the ComA homolog produces phosphosulfolactate from phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), demonstrating that bacterial CoM biosynthesis is initiated similarly as the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent methanogenic archaeal pathway. The bioinformatics analysis revealed that XcbC1 and D1 are members of the aspartase/fumarase superfamily (AFS) and that XcbE1 is a pyridoxal 5′-phosphate–containing enzyme with homology to d-cysteine desulfhydrases. Known AFS members catalyze β-elimination reactions of succinyl-containing substrates, yielding fumarate as the common unsaturated elimination product. Unexpectedly, we found that XcbC1 catalyzes β-elimination on phosphosulfolactate, yielding inorganic phosphate and a novel metabolite, sulfoacrylic acid. Phosphate-releasing β-elimination reactions are unprecedented among the AFS, indicating that XcbC1 is an unusual phosphatase. Direct demonstration of phosphosulfolactate synthase activity for XcbB1 and phosphate β-elimination activity for XcbC1 strengthened their hypothetical assignment to a CoM biosynthetic pathway and suggested functions also for XcbD1 and E1. Our results represent a critical first step toward elucidating the CoM pathway in bacteria. For nearly 30 years, coenzyme M (CoM) was assumed to be present solely in methanogenic archaea.

https://openalex.org/W2786844875,"Diplozoidae (Monogenea) are blood-feeding freshwater fish gill ectoparasites with extraordinary body architecture and a unique sexual behaviour in which two larval worms fuse and transform into one functioning individual. In this study, we describe the body organisation of Paradiplozoon homoion adult stage using a combined approach of confocal laser scanning and electron microscopy, with emphasis on the forebody and hindbody. Special attention is given to structures involved in functional adaptation to ectoparasitism, i.e. host searching, attachment and feeding/metabolism. Our observations indicate clear adaptations for blood sucking, with a well-innervated mouth opening surrounded by sensory structures, prominent muscular buccal suckers and a pharynx. The buccal cavity surface is covered with numerous tegumentary digitations that increase the area in contact with host tissue and, subsequently, with its blood. The buccal suckers and the well-innervated haptor (with sclerotised clamps controlled by noticeable musculature) cooperate in attaching to and moving over the host. Putative gland cells accumulate in the region of apical circular structures, pharynx area and in the haptor middle region. Paired club-shaped sacs lying laterally to the pharynx might serve as secretory reservoirs. Furthermore, we were able to visualise the body wall musculature, including peripheral innervation, the distribution of uniciliated sensory structures essential for reception of external environmental information, and flame cells involved in excretion. Our results confirm in detail that P. homoion displays a range of sophisticated adaptations to an ectoparasitic life style, characteristic for diplozoid monogeneans."
https://openalex.org/W2789459983,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has a high prevalence rate in Germany and a further increase is expected within the next years. Although risk factors on an individual level are widely understood, only little is known about the spatial heterogeneity and population-based risk factors of COPD. Background knowledge about broader, population-based processes could help to plan the future provision of healthcare and prevention strategies more aligned to the expected demand. The aim of this study is to analyze how the prevalence of COPD varies across northeastern Germany on the smallest spatial-scale possible and to identify the location-specific population-based risk factors using health insurance claims of the AOK Nordost.To visualize the spatial distribution of COPD prevalence at the level of municipalities and urban districts, we used the conditional autoregressive Besag-York-Mollié (BYM) model. Geographically weighted regression modelling (GWR) was applied to analyze the location-specific ecological risk factors for COPD.The sex- and age-adjusted prevalence of COPD was 6.5% in 2012 and varied widely across northeastern Germany. Population-based risk factors consist of the proportions of insurants aged 65 and older, insurants with migration background, household size and area deprivation. The results of the GWR model revealed that the population at risk for COPD varies considerably across northeastern Germany.Area deprivation has a direct and an indirect influence on the prevalence of COPD. Persons ageing in socially disadvantaged areas have a higher chance of developing COPD, even when they are not necessarily directly affected by deprivation on an individual level. This underlines the importance of considering the impact of area deprivation on health for planning of healthcare. Additionally, our results reveal that in some parts of the study area, insurants with migration background and persons living in multi-persons households are at elevated risk of COPD."
https://openalex.org/W2794042976,"Background Anti-inflammatory drug development efforts for lung disease have been hampered in part by the lack of noninvasive inflammation biomarkers and the limited ability of animal models to predict efficacy in humans. We used 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) in a human model of lung inflammation to assess whether pioglitazone, a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ) agonist, and zileuton, a 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor, reduce lung inflammation. Methods For this single center, single-blind, placebo-controlled cohort study, we enrolled healthy volunteers sequentially into the following treatment cohorts (N = 6 per cohort): pioglitazone plus placebo, zileuton plus placebo, or dual placebo prior to bronchoscopic endotoxin instillation. 18F-FDG uptake pre- and post-endotoxin was quantified as the Patlak graphical analysis-determined Ki (primary outcome measure). Secondary outcome measures included the mean standard uptake value (SUVmean), post-endotoxin bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cell counts and differentials and blood adiponectin and urinary leukotriene E4 (LTE4) levels, determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, to verify treatment compliance. One- or two-way analysis of variance assessed for differences among cohorts in the outcome measures (expressed as mean ± standard deviation). Results Ten females and eight males (29±6 years of age) completed all study procedures except for one volunteer who did not complete the post-endotoxin BAL. Ki and SUVmean increased in all cohorts after endotoxin instillation (Ki increased by 0.0021±0.0019, 0.0023±0.0017, and 0.0024±0.0020 and SUVmean by 0.47±0.14, 0.55±0.15, and 0.54±0.38 in placebo, pioglitazone, and zileuton cohorts, respectively, p<0.001) with no differences among treatment cohorts (p = 0.933). Adiponectin levels increased as expected with pioglitazone treatment but not urinary LTE4 levels as expected with zileuton treatment. BAL cell counts (p = 0.442) and neutrophil percentage (p = 0.773) were similar among the treatment cohorts. Conclusions Endotoxin-induced lung inflammation in humans is not responsive to pioglitazone or zileuton, highlighting the challenge in translating anti-inflammatory drug efficacy results from murine models to humans.

https://openalex.org/W2808306638,"By means of a computational model, we study the relation between two complementary views of gelation, rheological tests against the characterization of a network of consecutive particles. The model we propose consists of slender, plane, colloidal sized particles, which we name laths, which self-assemble into long ordered aggregates of several particles; called whiskers in the literature. Within a whisker, the interaction potential is a minimum when: the planes of two consecutive laths are aligned, thus favoring their alignment; when the center of three consecutive laths lie in a straight line, thus favoring stacking; and when the center of two consecutive laths are located at a certain distance, which mimics excluded volume. A threshold value of the potential gives a condition for sticking free laths into whiskers, and for the breaking of whiskers. The simplicity of the model allows the simulation to reach large enough times, of the order of minutes, needed to simulate numerical rheology tests. We are able to characterize the whisker formation, as well as to simulate the gel transition, by means of an oscillatory shear numerical experiment. We conclude that according to the usual rheological definition a gel transition occurs at about 250K, even though there is no branching and less than 10% of whiskers are long enough as to percolate the system."
