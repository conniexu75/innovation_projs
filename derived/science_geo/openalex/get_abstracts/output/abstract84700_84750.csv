https://openalex.org/W2133508418,"We have isolated the component of human bladder carcinoma cell DNA that is able to transform mouse fibroblasts. The oncogenic sequence was isolated initially from a lambda phage genomic library made from DNA of a transfected mouse cell carrying the human oncogene. A subcloned insert of 6.6 kb that carried transforming activity was amplified in the plasmid vector pBR322. The subcloned oncogene has been used as a sequence probe in Southern blot analyses. The oncogene appears to derive from sequences present in normal cellular DNA. Structural analysis has failed so far to reveal differences between the oncogene and its normal cellular homolog. The oncogene is unrelated to transforming sequences detected in a variety of other types of human tumor cell lines derived from colonic and lung carcinoma and from neuroblastoma. In contrast, the EJ bladder oncogene appears closely related to one that is active in the human T24 bladder carcinoma cell line. The oncogene appears to have undergone little, if any, amplification in several bladder carcinoma cell lines."

https://openalex.org/W2011857798,"Cellular genes potentially capable of inducing oncogenic transformation have been identified by homology to the transforming genes of retroviruses and by the biological activity of cellular DNA's in transfection assays. DNA's of various tumors induce transformation with high efficiencies, indicating that oncogenesis can involve dominant genetic alterations resulting in activation of cellular transforming genes. The identification and characterization of cellular transforming genes and their possible involvement in naturally occurring cancers, is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1977437036,"We have constructed a linear yeast plasmid by joining fragments from the termini of Tetrahymena ribosomal DNA to a yeast vector. Structural features of the terminus region of the Tetrahymena rDNA plasmid maintained in the yeast linear plasmid include a set of specifically placed single-strand interruptions within the cluster of hexanucleotide (C4A2) repeat units. An artificially constructed hairpin terminus was unable to stabilize a linear plasmid in yeast. The fact that yeast can recognize and use DNA ends from the distantly related organism Tetrahymena suggests that the structural features required for telomere replication and resolution have been highly conserved in evolution. The linear plasmid was used as a vector to clone chromosomal telomeres from yeast. One Tetrahymena end was removed by restriction digestion, and yeast fragments that could function as an end on a linear plasmid were selected. Restriction mapping and hybridization analysis demonstrated that these fragments were yeast telomeres, and suggested that all yeast chromosomes might have a common telomere sequence. Yeast telomeres appear to be similar in structure to the rDNA of Tetrahymena, in which specific nicks or gaps are present within a simple repeated sequence near the terminus of the DNA."

https://openalex.org/W2126758146,"DNA unwinding induced by Escherichia coli RNA polymerase is measured for binary, initiation and ternary complexes formed from a unique promoter sequence on simian virus 40 DNA. At 37 degrees C the complexes all have an unwinding angle of 17 +/- 1 base pairs (580 degrees +/- 30 degrees). This unwinding is attributed to an enzyme-stabilized separation of the double helix at the promoter site, which is maintained throughout initiation and elongation. There is no heterogeneity in the unwinding angle of the ternary complex as it progresses down the helical template. The constant DNA unwinding during all phases of transcription leads us to propose the existence of unwindase and rewindase activities on the enzyme that allow it to travel down the helix like a nut on a DNA bolt. During elongation, the unwindase unwinds the DNA helix while the rewindase, lagging by 17 base pairs, displaces the RNA transcript and reseals the helix. Both activities induce a rotation in the DNA double helix relative to the polymerase. The RNA-DNA hybrid also rotates, maintaining both ends of that helix fixed relative to the catalytic and windase sites. Formation of an RNA-DNA hybrid which spans the distal end of the DNA unwound region is proposed as a possible mechanism for polymerase pausing and termination. This model requires that the polymerase direct the transcript past the noncoding DNA strand. Pausing occurs 16-20 nucleotides downstream from the centers of appropriately sized dyad symmetry elements."
https://openalex.org/W2166440742,"The multicopy yeast plasmid, 2mu circle, encodes a specialized recombination system. It contains two regions, each 599 bp in length, that are precise inverted repeats of each other and between which recombination occurs readily. In addition, this recombination requires the product of a 2mu circle gene, designated FLP. By examining the products of FLP-mediated recombination of plasmids containing single insertions within one of the repeated regions, we show that this recombination occurs only at a specific site within the repeat. This result was confirmed from analysis of the ability of plasmids containing various deletions within one of the repeated regions to serve as substrates for FLP-mediated recombination. These experiments limit the recombination site to a sequence of less than 65 bp. In addition, by mutational analysis of the recombination potential of a hybrid plasmid containing the entire 2mu circle genome, we have shown that FLP is only the 2mu circle gene necessary for this site-specific recombination. Finally, we describe a sensitive assay for recombination between the repeated sequences of 2mu circle; using it, we demonstrate that even in the absence of FLP gene product, recombination between the repeats occurs at a low but detectable level during meiosis."
https://openalex.org/W2111954586,"Nuclei and viral transcriptional complexes were prepared from cells infected with simian virus 40 and incubated in vitro in the presence of α-32P-UTP. The in vitro elongated viral RNA appeared with a peak of 5S in sucrose gradients and hybridized preferentially to a promoter-proximal region of SV40 DNA. Treatment of infected cells with proflavine led to transcription of elongated RNA, while treatment of cells with 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole, a drug known to enhance premature termination, augmented accumulation of the promoter-proximal RNA. The in vitro elongated RNA produced a major band of 93–95 nucleotides in length in acrylamide gel. This RNA was found to map between the major initiation site at nucleotide 243 and nucleotides 335–337. The significance of these observations with respect to the transcription termination signal and the control of SV40 gene expression is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1560944359,"H+ secretion by the turtle urinary bladder is produced by a proton pump located in the luminal membrane. We show that a microsomal fraction of these cells contains an electrogenic proton translocating ATPase that is inhibited by dicyclohexylcarbodiimide but not oligomycin or vanadate. On a sucrose density gradient, this ATPase co-migrated with luminal membranes labeled with concanavalin A, but was separate from a lysosomal marker. This enzyme is therefore the H+ ATPase that causes urinary acidification."
https://openalex.org/W2111489597,"Analysis of cultured Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells has shown that vimentin exists primarily as two 57,000 dalton isoelectric variants, a nonphosphorylated form and a slightly more acidic phosphorylated form. Similar analyses of CHO cells that were treated with colcemid show the presence of at least two to three additional, more acidic, phosphorylated vimentin isoelectric variants. An increasing 32P-specific activity of these variants suggests that this alteration involves increased phosphorylation. Analysis of 32P-labeled vimentin from colcemid-treated cells indicates that the amount of the additional phosphorylated variants correlates with the accumulation of cells in mitosis. CHO cells enriched in mitotic cells without antimitotic drugs demonstrate the same alteration in the isoelectric focusing pattern of phosphorylated vimentin. When mitotic cells are replated, the amount of additional phosphorylated variants is reduced within 30 min. The data suggest that an alteration in phosphorylated vimentin is temporally related to the alteration in the organization of intermediate filaments in mitotic cells."
https://openalex.org/W1978611782,"Small doses of endotoxin evoked a dramatic biphasic response of opioid peptide secretion into blood in sheep. The first phase began within minutes and coincided with a brief hypertensive response to endotoxin well before the appearance of fever or hypotension. The ratio of beta-endorphin to beta-lipotropin fell abruptly at the onset of the second phase of release, suggesting early depletion of a pool rich in beta-endorphin and subsequent emergence of a pool rich in unprocessed precursor. The concentration of cerebrospinal fluid opioids increased tenfold during the second phase. Naloxone administration augmented endotoxin-induced opioid secretion in both early and late phases, suggesting a short-loop feedback regulation of stress-induced endorphin secretion."
https://openalex.org/W1603766333,"Chicken gizzard smooth muscle contains large amounts of Ca2+-activated protease activity. Approximately 15 mg of purified enzyme can be obtained from 1 kg of fresh muscle. The enzyme consists of two subunits (Mr = 80,000 and 30,000) present in a 1:1 molar ratio. In the presence of CaCl2, the 80,000/30,000-dalton heterodimer (form I) is rapidly converted by limited autolysis to a 76,000/18,000-dalton species (form II). Both the 80,000- and 30,000-dalton subunits are degraded simultaneously. Moreover, the Ca2+ dependence for autolysis (K0.5 = 300 microM) is identical for both subunits. Neither the time course nor the Ca2+ dependence of the autolytic conversion reaction is altered by 10- and 20-fold molar excesses of substrate. Limited autolysis markedly reduces the Ca2+ requirement for substrate degradation. Using N-[ethyl-2-3H]maleimide-labeled 27,000-dalton cardiac myosin light chains as substrate, the Ca2+ requirement of form I was found to be quite high (K0.5 = 150 microM). Under similar conditions, the Ca2+ requirement of form II was 30-fold lower (K0.5 = 5 microM). Limited autolysis did not alter the specific activity of the enzyme. Our results demonstrate that smooth muscle contains an abundant amount of Ca2+-activated protease. Moreover, autolysis of this enzyme may play an important regulatory role by converting the native form to a species that is fully active at physiological levels of intracellular calcium ion."

https://openalex.org/W37774318,"Ca2+ causes less than 2-fold elevations of guinea pig sperm cyclic AMP concentrations when cells are incubated in a minimal culture medium in the absence of bicarbonate (HCO3-). However, in the presence of HCO3-, Ca2+ increases cyclic AMP by as much as 25-fold within 1 min. The (Ca2+, HCO3-)-induced elevations occur in either the presence or absence of the permeant anions, pyruvate and lactate. In the absence of extracellular Ca2+, HCO3- elevates cyclic AMP only slightly. The effect of HCO3- is concentration-dependent, with maximal responses obtained at concentrations of greater than 25 mM. Ca2+ (25 mM HCO3-) at concentrations of less than 100 microM causes one-half-maximal elevations of cyclic AMP. The (Ca2+, HCO3-)-induced elevations of cyclic AMP are observed at various extracellular pH values (7.5-8.5) and in the presence or absence of extracellular Na+ or K+. NH4Cl does not elevate sperm cyclic AMP concentrations and does not greatly alter the (Ca2+, HCO3-)-induced elevations. the putative Ca2+ transport antagonist, D-600 (100 microM), completely blocks the (Ca2+, HCO3-)-induced elevations of cyclic AMP. A23187, in the presence but not in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, increases sperm cyclic AMP but does not further elevate cyclic AMP in HCO3(-)-treated cells. These studies establish that Ca2+-dependent elevations of cyclic AMp in guinea pig spermatozoa are dependent on the presence of HCO3- and suggest that HCO3- is required for the uptake (exchange) or membrane sequestration of small amounts of physiologically active Ca2+."

https://openalex.org/W1577865969,"Glucocorticoid receptor in rat liver cytosol is inactivated (rendered unable to bind steroid) by incubation with calf intestine alkaline phosphatase or highly purified rabbit muscle phosphoprotein phosphatase (phosphorylase phosphate, protein phosphatase C). The receptor is inactivated by both enzymes even when 10 mM sodium molybdate is present. Receptors that are inactivated by phosphatases in the presence of molybdate can be reactivated to the steroid-binding state by addition of dithiothreitol, but receptors that are inactivated in the absence of molybdate cannot be reactivated. These observations suggest that dephosphorylation leads to oxidation of a moiety (-SH) on the receptor that is required for steroid binding. Molybdate apparently preserves the receptor in a form such that reduction returns the receptor to the steroid binding state. We would propose that molybdate may act by complexing with sulfur groups on the receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2018253479,"Myotubes of a mouse muscle-cell line (C2) synthesize in culture a 16S form of acetylcholinesterase that is normally found only in regions of adult mouse muscle that contain endplates. The 16S enzyme in C2 cell extracts has the properties expected of acetylcholinesterase forms that have a collagen-like tail. In intact cells, the active site of the 16S acetylcholinesterase is protected by a membrane-impermeable inhibitor, and this form of the enzyme can be removed by treatment of the cells with collagenase. Thus the enzyme is extracellular. Its extraction by high ionic strength solutions lacking detergent suggests that the 16S form is associated with the extracellular matrix by ionic interactions. Histochemical staining shows focal patches of acetylcholinesterase activity on the cell surface. Collagenase treatment, which removes only the 16S form, abolishes this staining pattern, indicating that the patches consist of the 16S enzyme. We conclude that the 16S enzyme in C2 myotubes occurs in focal patches on the cell surface, where it is associated with the extracellular matrix."
https://openalex.org/W2041991587,Concentrations of prolactin and growth hormone in the serum of rats were significantly increased by morphine. Dose response studies demonstrated that maximum prolactin release required lower doses of morphine than those needed for the maximum growth hormone response. Selective blockade of mu 1 (high affinity) opiate receptor with the irreversible antagonist naloxazone reduced morphine-induced peak concentrations of prolactin by 80 percent while increasing peak growth hormone levels by 250 percent. These results suggest different receptor mechanisms for the opiate modulation of the two hormones. The mu 1 (high affinity) receptor sites appear to mediate the morphine-induced release of prolactin but not growth hormone.
https://openalex.org/W1596795466,"Antibodies against pure human pancreatic ribonuclease (RNase) were used to study ribonuclease levels in human tissues and body fluids. The antibodies completely inhibit the activity of purified RNase as well as ribonuclease activity in crude pancreatic extracts. RNase activity is inhibited by 70-80% in serum and urine, indicating that a significant proportion of the RNases in these preparations are structurally like the pancreatic enzyme. In contrast, inhibition of RNase activities from spleen (8%) and liver (30%) was inefficient suggesting that most of the RNases in these tissues are structurally unlike the pancreatic enzyme. A competitive binding radioimmunoassay (RIA), sensitive in the range of 1-100 ng of RNase, was developed to quantitate the pancreatic like enzymes. The RIA of crude tissue preparations and samples fractionated by gel filtration was compatible with inhibition results. Enzymes structurally like pancreatic RNase could be quantitated despite the presence of other RNase activities. Immunological quantitation of pancreatic like RNases was also found to be much more simple and precise than enzymatic assays comparing RNA and polycytidylate substrates. We suggest the immunological assays will be useful in the quantitation and definition of tissue of origin of RNases in serum of patients with pancreatic carcinoma."

https://openalex.org/W2007545671,"Approximately 25 percent of resting energy utilization in isolated nerve endoneurium is inhibited by medium containing defatted albumin and selectively restored by arachidonic acid but is unaffected by indomethacin or nordihydroguaiaretic acid. The same component of energy utilization is inhibited by small decreases in endoneurial myo-inositol, which decrease incorporation of carbon-14-labeled arachidonic acid into phosphatidylinositol. The fraction of the resting oxygen uptake inhibited by ouabain is decreased 40 to 50 percent by a reduced tissue myo-inositol concentration or by defatted albumin. Metabolic regulation by rapid, basal phosphatidylinositol turnover is dependent on the maintenance of normal tissue myoinositol concentrations."
https://openalex.org/W1500362340,"The O2 dependence of cytochrome oxidase, cellular ATP/ADP ratio, and drug sulfation and glucuronidation were studied in isolated hepatocytes to examine secondary biochemical changes of hypoxia related to decreased cytochrome oxidase function. A decrease in cytochrome oxidase function as well as in cellular ATP/ADP ratio occurred at low O2 concentrations and their O2 dependencies gave p50 values of 3.2 and 2.8 microM O2, respectively. Changes in the ATP/ADP ratio corresponded directly with changes in the oxidation-reduction state of cytochrome oxidase. The p50 value for sulfation of acetaminophen (2.5 microM O2) corresponded with the values for ATP/ADP ratio and cytochrome oxidase. Addition of compounds that lowered cellular ATP/ADP ratio caused a corresponding inhibition of sulfation. Selective use of ethionine, an adenosyl-trapping agent, demonstrated that the O2 dependence of sulfation related directly to a decrease in the absolute ATP concentration. The p50 value for glucuronidation (5.2 microM O2) was higher than that for sulfation, but in spite of this difference, glucuronidation also correlated well with cellular ATP/ADP ratio when this ratio was decreased by either O2 limitation or metabolic inhibitors. These results demonstrate that the predominant limitation of drug sulfation and glucuronidation during hypoxia is due to decreased cytochrome oxidase function."

https://openalex.org/W2070014028,"In chimpanzee hepatitis B virus (HBV) carriers, the mechanism of viral persistence has been examined by analyzing viral DNA molecules in liver and serum. Chimpanzee liver DNA contained two extrachromosomal HBV DNA molecules migrating on hybridization blots at 4.0 kb and 2.3 kb. There was no evidence for integration of HBV DNA into the host genome. The extrachromosomal molecules were distinct from Dane particle DNA and were converted to linear 3.25 kb full-length double-stranded HBV DNA on digestion with Eco RI. Nucleases S1 and Bal 31 converted ""2.3 kb"" HBV DNA to 3.25 kb via an intermediate of ""4.0 kb"" apparent length. The HBV DNA molecule that migrated at 2.3 kb represents a supercoiled form I of the HBV genome, and the molecule that migrated at 4.0 kb represents a full-length ""nicked,"" relaxed circular form II. Evidence for supercoiled HBV DNA in serum Dane particles was obtained by production of form II molecules upon digestion with nuclease S1 or Bal 31. It is proposed that most Dane particles represent interfering noninfectious virus containing partially double-stranded DNA circles and that particles containing supercoiled HBV DNA may represent infectious hepatitis B virus."
https://openalex.org/W1513925096,"The ability of the major neutrophil-derived lipoxygenase metabolites of arachidonic acid to increase the rate of 45Ca influx in rabbit neutrophils was examined. The results obtained demonstrate that (5S),(12R)-dihydroxy-6,8,11,14-(cis,trans,trans,cis)-eicosatetraenoic acid (leukotriene B4) is the most active of the arachidonic acid metabolites. The activity of leukotriene B4 is highly stereospecific in that its three nonenzymatically derived isomers are essentially inactive. The omega-hydroxylation of leukotriene B4 results in a compound that is nearly as active as leukotriene B4 as far as its ability to stimulate calcium influx and neutrophil aggregation while being a much weaker secretagogue. The further conversion of leukotriene B4 into a dicarboxylic acid removes all detectable biological activity. 5,6-Oxido-7,9,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid (leukotriene A4) methyl ester was also found to increase the rate of calcium influx, while the degradation products of native leukotriene A4 were essentially inactive. These results demonstrate that a close correlation exists between the ability of the various lipoxygenase products to alter calcium homeostasis in rabbit neutrophils and their biological activities."

https://openalex.org/W1606635212,"Siderophore iron transport was followed in Ustilago sphaerogena using isotope transport assays coupled with EPR spectroscopy. EPR spectroscopy was used as a quantitative tool to follow the rate of reduction of siderophore iron(III) to iron(II) in the cell suspension by following the disappearance of the signal at g = 4.3. This rate was compared with the rate of iron transport, measured by the disappearance of radioactively labeled iron from the medium. The transport of three iron chelates was examined: the ferric siderophores ferrichrome and ferichrome A, and iron(III) chelated to excess citrate. For the transport of ferrichrome, an iron(III) ionophore, the rate of reduction of iron(III) to iron(II) was significantly lower than the rate of uptake of isotope from the medium supernatant, which is consistent with the established mechanism of uptake of the entire complex followed by intracellular reduction to remove the iron from the ligand. However, the rate of reduction of ferrichrome A, a non-ionophore, was identical with the rate of transport of iron into the cell. Iron(III) citrate was reduced at a rate slightly lower than the rate of transport. These data suggest that reduction of iron(III) is involved in the transport of iron from ferichrome A and possibly from iron(III) citrate."
https://openalex.org/W1999335679,"Transposition of genetic elements involves coupled replication and integration events catalyzed in part by a class of proteins called transposases. We have asked whether the transposase activity of bacteriophage Mu (the Mu A protein) is stable and capable of catalyzing multiple rounds of coupled replication/integration, or whether its continued synthesis is required to maintain Mu DNA replication. Inhibition of protein synthesis during the lytic cycle with chloramphenicol inhibited Mu DNA synthesis with a half-life of approximately 3 min, demonstrating a need for continued protein synthesis to maintain Mu DNA replication. Synthesis of specific Mu-encoded proteins was inhibited by infecting a host carrying a temperature-sensitive suppressor, at permissive temperature, with Mu amber phages, then shifting to nonpermissive temperature. When Aam phages were used, Mu DNA replication was inhibited with kinetics essentially identical to those with chloramphenicol addition; hence, it is likely that continued synthesis of the Mu A protein is required to maintain Mu DNA replication. The data suggest that the activity of the Mu A protein is unstable, and raise the possibility that the Mu A protein and other transposases may be used stoichiometrically rather than catalytically."

https://openalex.org/W1544771910,"Exonuclease VII has been purified 7,500-fold to 87% homogeneity from Escherichia coli K12 using a new purification procedure. The enzyme has been shown to be composed of two nonidentical subunits of 10,500 and 54,000 daltons. This has been confirmed by restoration of exonuclease VII activity after renaturation of denatured and purified subunits. The structure of the native enzyme consists of one large subunit and four small subunits. We have previously isolated exonuclease VII mutant strains containing defects which map at two distinct loci. Subunit-mixing experiments utilizing wild type enzyme and temperature-sensitive enzyme produced by an xseB mutant strain have shown that the xseB gene codes for the small subunit of the enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1501502189,"The glycosylation of the G-protein was analyzed in vesicular stomatitis virus-infected baby hamster kidney cells incubated in the absence of glucose. The results indicate that the G-protein in glucose-starved cells is initially glycosylated from a lipid donor with a glucosylated oligosaccharide which is resistant to endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H and partially susceptible to alpha-mannosidase. With longer times, the protein-bound carbohydrate chain becomes much more sensitive to alpha-mannosidase while remaining endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H-resistant. Purified virions from glucose-starved baby hamster kidney cells, labeled with [35S]methionine and isolated on a sucrose gradient, contain altered forms of the G-protein, whereas the other viral proteins remain unchanged. These altered forms could also be radiolabeled with [3H]mannose, and upon analysis of labeled glycopeptides by chromatography on concanavalin A-Sepharose and Bio-Gel P-6, it was apparent that modification of the oligosaccharide portion of the G-protein occurs in baby hamster kidney cells, leading to aberrant mature carbohydrate chains."
https://openalex.org/W1506081958,"The stoichiometry of reducing equivalents per protomer for the complex molybdoflavoprotein xanthine oxidase has been re-examined by reductive titrations with sodium dithionite and anaerobic reoxidation with cytochrome c and phenazine methosulfate of dithionite- or photo-reduced enzyme. It is found that 8.0 +/- 0.1 reducing equivalents are taken up (or given up) by the enzyme, a value of 2 eq greater than expected on the basis of the known oxidation-reduction centers in the enzyme. The reaction of reduced xanthine oxidase with [14C]iodoacetate indicates that, in the reduced form of the enzyme, additional cysteine residues are available for reaction. These results, in conjunction with the observation that reaction of oxidized enzyme with sulfite results in the appearance of an additional equivalent of thiol capable of reacting with 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) or iodoacetate, indicate the presence of a disulfide linkage in the enzyme that can be reduced by dithionite or photochemically employing EDTA and 5-deazaflavin. Neither xanthine nor lumazine, however, is capable of reducing this oxidation-reduction center, suggesting that the disulfide does not play a role in the catalytic reactions of the enzyme. These results resolve discrepancies in the literature which indicated that greater than 6 reducing equivalents were consistently needed to bring about the complete reduction of xanthine oxidase."
https://openalex.org/W1573690649,"High affinity cell surface receptors for low density lipoproteins (LDL) are inducible in cultured human lung fibroblasts by the removal of lipoproteins from the cell culture medium. The binding, uptake, and degradation of 125I-LDL by fibroblasts decrease with increasing number of population doublings. The affinity of LDL receptor binding, however, remained unchanged at different population doublings levels. Hence, the difference in LDL binding activity in the aging fibroblasts can be attributed to a reduction in the number of receptor sites on the cell membrane. Cellular uptake of [4-14C]cholesterol and 2-deoxy-D-[1-14C]glucose mediated through mechanisms independent of the LDL receptor pathway revealed no significant difference in early and late passage fibroblasts. This suggests that the alteration in the LDL receptor binding in serially passaged fibroblasts is an phenomenon. The late population doubling fibroblasts require more LDL in the culture medium for feedback inhibition of LDL receptor synthesis. Thus, aging fibroblasts are both progressively less inducible and less suppressible in the regulation of their cell membrane LDL receptors. Similar results were also obtained with respect to the regulation of DL-3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase in the aging fibroblasts in culture; the enzyme has become less inducible and less supressible as the fibroblasts approach the limit of their in vitro lifespan. These age-related alterations in the cellular metabolism of LDL and cholesterol might contribute to our understanding of the increased risk of athlerosclerosis in our aging population."
https://openalex.org/W1595378945,"The role of phospholipids in the activity of UDP-Glc-NAc:dolichol phosphate GlcNAc-1-phosphate transferase of rat lung microsomes has been investigated. Treatment of microsomes with phospholipase A2 in the presence of delipidated bovine serum albumin resulted in a time-dependent loss of 65 to 75% of the enzyme activity and approximately 30% of the phospholipids. Addition of phosphatidylglycerol to the enzyme assay system containing phospholipase A2-treated microsomes restored activity to that obtained with native microsomes and phosphatidylglycerol. Addition of phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylcholine, or cardiolipin resulted in only partial restoration of activity, whereas phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine were without effect. Triton X-100 was not by itself capable of restoring activity, but was required for the phospholipid effect. Measurements of the phospholipase A2 hydrolysis products released from the microsomes during digestion, and other control experiments of adding fatty acids and lysophospholipids to the enzyme assay system, indicated that the loss of UDP-GlcNAc:dolichol phosphate GlcNAc-1-phosphate transferase activity was not due to product inhibition."

To facilitate studies of the interactions of 45 protein with the T4 DNA replication complex and with RNA polymerase, we have determined the primary structure of 45 protein. The amino acid sequence of 45 protein has been determined by correlating nucleotide sequence analysis of gene 45 with protein chemistry studies of 45 protein. Our studies indicate that gene 45 codes for a polypeptide containing 227 amino acids, with a calculated Mr = 24,710. The coding region of gene 46 is preceded by a putative promoter containing sequences which are homologous to Escherichia coli RNA polymerase recognition and binding regions. In addition, there are sequence similarities in the translation initiation regions of gene 45 and the rIIB gene, which may relate to their common regulation by regA protein."
https://openalex.org/W1514244637,"The single glycoprotein species of vesicular stomatitis virus exhibits heterogeneity in isoelectric focusing. Short term radioisotopic labeling of infected cells revealed that this heterogeneity is acquired after synthesis and glycosylation of the protein, during the period of oligosaccharide processing from the high mannose to the complex form. In this process, radioactive sulfate is incorporated randomly into different glycoprotein molecules, conferring unequal amounts of negative charge upon them. Since the virus glycoprotein is processed by cellular pathways, it is likely that differential sulfation is responsible for much of the charge heterogeneity displayed by cellular glycoproteins."
https://openalex.org/W1661569481,"The incorporation of the leucine analog, beta-hydroxyleucine, or the isoleucine analog, 4-thiaisoleucine, into the MPOC-46B kappa chain interfered with the processing of the oligosaccharide moiety of newly synthesized light chains. Analog-containing chains were secreted with endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H-sensitive oligosaccharides instead of the normal complex, endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H-resistant oligosaccharide. The incorporation of the analogs did not significantly decrease the overall secretion of the MPOC-46B-related proteins. These data form the basis for the hypothesis that the presence of the analog in the protein alters the peptide configuration sufficiently to prevent the processing of precursor high mannose oligosaccharides to complex oligosaccharides."

https://openalex.org/W1578900014,"The 55 S mammalian mitochondrial ribosome (referred to hereafter as mitoribosome) is protein-rich, containing nearly twice as much protein as the Escherichia coli ribosome. In order to produce soluble mitochondrial proteins and protein-deficient subribosomal particles for use in functional and structural studies, the proteins of bovine mitoribosomes were extracted by washing in a series of buffers containing increasing concentrations of LiCl as the only chaotropic agent. LiCl disruption is used in order to preserve the solubilized proteins in a substantially native configuration. The extraction mixtures were characterized by sucrose density gradient analysis and the compositions of the stripped protein and residual pellet fractions were determined by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In order to analyze the behavior or individual proteins, the intensity of Coomassie blue stain for each protein was normalized against the intensity of stain for the same protein in a control sample. Buffers with 1, 2, and 4 M LiCl each extract a specific subset of mitoribosomal proteins, while another group of proteins remains in the residual pellet fraction. Although very few proteins are detected in only one condition, most proteins are specifically enriched in one fraction. This LiCl procedure, therefore, produces fractionated groups of mitoribosomal proteins which can be used directly as a source for those proteins in which they are enriched, or they can be used as a starting point in further purification procedures. In contrast to results with E. coli ribosomes, several mitoribosomal proteins remain core-associated, indicating a different structural organization in these ribosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1501508768,"Cell surface proteins and glycoproteins of the CHO-K1 clone of Chinese hamster ovary cells were radiolabeled by surface-specific reactions as well as by metabolic incorporation of glycoprotein precursors. After the proteins were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, they were quantified according to the amount of radioactivity which was associated with individual proteins spots. A glycoprotein of 133,000 daltons (P133-11) wa found to increase severalfold by the elevation of the cytoplasmic level of adenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate. In this paper, we report that the increase of P133-11 was more efficient in dense cultures than in sparse cultures. The use of conditioned medium or frequent medium changes during the treatment with the cyclic nucleotide did not influence the efficiency of the increase of the glycoprotein, indicating that the enrichment or exhaustion of diffusible materials was not responsible for this density-dependent phenomenon. The same conclusion was drawn from an experiment in which the amount of P133-11 was compared between homogeneously plated sparse cultures and cultures containing the same number of cells in the form of colonies with well contacted cells at an average density of 400 cells/colony. The increase of the protein was higher in the latter type of cell cultures. We, therefore, propose that the interaction of surface components upon cell-cell contact plays a role in the expression of P133-11 surface glycoprotein."

The small intervening sequence of both beta-globin pre-mRNAs was removed in one step, although minor amounts of incompletely spliced RNA were detected. During the processing of the large intervening sequence of beta major globin pre-mRNA two internal splice sites were clearly detected. On the contrary, the beta minor globin pre-mRNA did not show any internal splice sites. A model of processing of the mouse adult beta major globin pre-mRNA is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1563628446,"ATP sulfurylase catalyzes the synthesis of ATP from adenosine 5'-phosphosulfate and magnesium pyrophosphate with inversion of configuration at phosphorus. This implies an line displacement mechanism in the ternary complex and effectively eliminates both an adjacent mechanism followed by pseudorotation and a double displacement mechanism involving an adenylyl-enzyme intermediate. The double displacement mechanism had been invoked previously to account for a number of observations, including the ability of the enzyme to catalyze the hydrolysis of MgATP to AMP and MgPPi, and the exchange of Mg32PPi into MgATP in the absence of sulfate."
