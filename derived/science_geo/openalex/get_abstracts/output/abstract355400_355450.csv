https://openalex.org/W2034831897,"Gene silencing in plants, in which an endogenous gene is suppressed by introduction of a related transgene, has been used for crop improvement. Observations that viruses are potentially both initiators and targets of gene silencing suggested that this phenomenon may be related to natural defense against viruses. Supporting this idea, it was found that nepovirus infection of nontransgenic plants induces a resistance mechanism that is similar to transgene-induced gene silencing."

https://openalex.org/W1979674827,"DNA methylation is an indispensible epigenetic modification required for regulating the expression of mammalian genomes. Immunoprecipitation-based methods for DNA methylome analysis are rapidly shifting the bottleneck in this field from data generation to data analysis, necessitating the development of better analytical tools. In particular, an inability to estimate absolute methylation levels remains a major analytical difficulty associated with immunoprecipitation-based DNA methylation profiling. To address this issue, we developed a cross-platform algorithm-Bayesian tool for methylation analysis (Batman)-for analyzing methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) profiles generated using oligonucleotide arrays (MeDIP-chip) or next-generation sequencing (MeDIP-seq). We developed the latter approach to provide a high-resolution whole-genome DNA methylation profile (DNA methylome) of a mammalian genome. Strong correlation of our data, obtained using mature human spermatozoa, with those obtained using bisulfite sequencing suggest that combining MeDIP-seq or MeDIP-chip with Batman provides a robust, quantitative and cost-effective functional genomic strategy for elucidating the function of DNA methylation."

Here we report the development of a new, miniaturized diagnostic magnetic resonance (DMR) system for multiplexed, quantitative and rapid analysis. By using magnetic particles as a proximity sensor to amplify molecular interactions, the handheld DMR system can perform measurements on unprocessed biological samples. We show the capability of the DMR system by using it to detect bacteria with high sensitivity, identify small numbers of cells and analyze them on a molecular level in real time, and measure a series of protein biomarkers in parallel. The DMR technology shows promise as a robust and portable diagnostic device."

https://openalex.org/W1992670654,"Limitation of infarct size is a major goal of therapy for acute coronary syndromes, and research has focused on achieving rapid patency of infarct-related vessels. However, new understandings of epigenetic modifications during ischemia suggest additional targeted approaches that have not been extensively explored. Here, we show that ischemia induces histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity in the heart with deacetylation of histones H3/4 in vitro and in vivo. We show, utilizing a standard murine model of ischemia-reperfusion, that chemical HDAC inhibitors significantly reduce infarct area, even when delivered 1 h after the ischemic insult. We demonstrate that HDAC inhibitors prevent ischemia-induced activation of gene programs that include hypoxia inducible factor-1alpha, cell death, and vascular permeability in vivo and in vitro, thus providing potential mechanisms to explain reduced vascular leak and myocardial injury. In vitro, siRNA knockdown experiments implicate HDAC4 as a mediator of the effects in ischemic cardiac myocytes. These results demonstrate that HDAC inhibitors alter the response to ischemic injury in the heart and reduce infarct size, suggesting novel therapeutic approaches for acute coronary syndromes."
https://openalex.org/W1971727807,"Saffron, the processed stigma of Crocus sativus, is characterized by the presence of several apocarotenoids that contribute to the color, flavor, and aroma of the spice. However, little is known about the synthesis of aroma compounds during the development of the C. sativus stigma. The developing stigma is nearly odorless, but before and at anthesis, the aromatic compound β-ionone becomes the principal norisoprenoid volatile in the stigma. In this study, four carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase (CCD) genes, CsCCD1a, CsCCD1b, CsCCD4a, and CsCCD4b, were isolated from C. sativus. Expression analysis showed that CsCCD1a was constitutively expressed, CsCCD1b was unique to the stigma tissue, but only CsCCD4a and -b had expression patterns consistent with the highest levels of β-carotene and emission of β-ionone derived during the stigma development. The CsCCD4 enzymes were localized in plastids and more specifically were present in the plastoglobules. The enzymatic activities of CsCCD1a, CsCCD1b, and CsCCD4 enzymes were determined by Escherichia coli expression, and subsequent analysis of the volatile products was generated by GC/MS. The four CCDs fell in two phylogenetically divergent dioxygenase classes, but all could cleave β-carotene at the 9,10(9′,10′) positions to yield β-ionone. The data obtained suggest that all four C. sativus CCD enzymes may contribute in different ways to the production of β-ionone. In addition, the location and precise timing of β-ionone synthesis, together with its known activity as a fragrance and insect attractant, suggest that this volatile may have a role in Crocus pollination.

In addition, the location and precise timing of β-ionone synthesis, together with its known activity as a fragrance and insect attractant, suggest that this volatile may have a role in Crocus pollination. Crocus sativus is a triploid sterile plant characterized by its long red stigmas. These stigmas, when desiccated, constitute the spice known as saffron. Saffron is considered a complex mixture of volatile and non-volatile compounds that contribute to its overall aroma and flavor. The main components of saffron responsible for coloring strength are the derived carotenoids cis- and trans-crocins, picrocrocin, and its degradation product, the odor-active safranal that composes up to 70% of total volatiles (1Tarantilis P.A. Polissiou M. Manfait M. J. Chromatogr. 1994; 664: 55-61Crossref Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In addition to safranal, 150 volatile compounds are estimated to be present in the spice, and ∼60 constituents have been identified (2Winterhalter P. Straubinger M. Food Rev. Int. 2000; 16: 39-59Crossref Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The structures of several of these reveal an isoprenoid-based origin like safranal, and are assumed to be the products of the oxidative cleavage of carotenoids. In recent years, a family of enzymes that cleave carotenoid substrates at different double bond positions have been described in plants. This family, the carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases (CCDs), 2The abbreviations used are:CCDcarotenoid cleavage dioxygenaseNCED9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenaseABAabscisic acidRTreverse transcriptaseGFPgreen fluorescent proteinHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyRACErapid amplification of cDNA ends. 2The abbreviations used are:CCDcarotenoid cleavage dioxygenaseNCED9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenaseABAabscisic acidRTreverse transcriptaseGFPgreen fluorescent proteinHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyRACErapid amplification of cDNA ends. are specific for the location of the double bond in the molecule they cleave, but many are promiscuous in their carotenoid substrate choice (3Schwartz S.H.

Plant Biol. 2006; 9: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). The founding member of the CCD family was Vp14, a 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (NCED). This and other closely related dioxygenases catalyze the cleavage at the 11,12 double bond of both 9-cis-violaxanthin and 9-cis-neoxanthin to produce xanthoxin (5Schwartz S.H. Tan B.C. Gage D.

Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 343-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), which is subsequently converted into the phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA). Homology to VP14 allowed the discovery of other enzymes in different plant species that could be distinguished based on their specific cleavage sites. Among them, two groups have been expanded in the last year, the CCD1 and the CCD4 groups of enzymes. CCD1 enzymes symmetrically cleave the 9,10(9′,10′) double bonds of multiple carotenoid substrates to produce a C14 dialdehyde and two C13 cyclohexenone derivatives (4Auldridge M.E. McCarty D.R. Klee H.J. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2006; 9: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). More recently, an additional cleavage activity for CCD1 at the 5,6(5′,6′) double bonds of lycopene has been reported (8Vogel J.T. Tan B.C. McCarty D.R. Klee H.J. J. Biol.

Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 47-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). These CCD1 enzymes seem to be localized in the cytoplasm, in contrast with the CCD4 enzymes that showed a plastid targeting sequence. Among the latter, AtCCD4 has recently been localized in plastoglobules (15Ytterberg A.J. Peltier J.B. van Wijk K.J. Plant Physiol. 2006; 140: 984-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar), although the cleavage activity and resulting products for the CCD4 group are still to be identified (4Auldridge M.E.

We describe here the isolation of four CCD genes from C. sativus (CsCCD1a, CsCCD1b, CsCCD4a, and CsCCD4b). All four cDNAs were isolated by homology taking advantage of conservation of carotenoid dioxygenase motifs. Using in vivo bacterial expression assays, we found that all four CsCCD enzymes were able to cleave different carotenoid substrates at their 9,10(9′,10′) double bonds. To study the possible involvement of these CsCCDs in the synthesis of C13-norisoprenoids in C. sativus stigma, the expression patterns of the four CsCCDs were followed during stigma development and compared with the changes in the C13-norisoprenoid levels. Plant Material and Stress Treatments—Plant tissues and stigmas from C. sativus grown under field conditions in Tarazona de la Mancha, Spain, were used throughout the experiments. Stigmas were collected at developmental stages defined as follows: yellow stigma, closed bud inside the perianth tubes (around 0.3 cm in length); orange stigma, closed bud inside the perianth tubes (around 0.4 mm in length); red stigma, closed bud inside the perianth tubes (0.8 cm in length); -2da, 2 days before anthesis, dark red stigmas in closed bud outside the perianth tubes (3 cm); da, day of anthesis, dark red stigmas (3 cm); +1da, 1 day after anthesis, dark red stigmas; and +3da, 3 days after anthesis, dark red stigmas. Petals, style, and stamens were collected from flowers at the time of anthesis. Young and senescent leaves, roots, and corms were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C until required. To determine stress-induced gene expression in leaves, whole leaves were collected from plants growing in fields, cut in 1-cm long pieces and transferred to 24-well plates containing 1 ml of water supplemented with ABA (100 μm), 200 mm CaCl2, or distilled water that was used as a control; and incubated under normal conditions (16 h light/8 h dark cycles at 22 °C). Heat stress was applied by raising the temperature in the growth chamber to 38 °C for 6 h. Leaf tissue was collected 24 h after and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C until required. For the dehydration experiments leaf pieces were subjected to dehydration in Petri dishes on Whatman No. 3MM paper (Whatman International, Maidstone, England) at 60% relative humidity and 22 °C, under dim light (100 lux), and collected at 2, 5, and 10 h. Seeds from Arabidopsis wild type ecotype Columbia (Col) and transgenic lines were sown in pots containing vermiculite and watered with nutrient solution under a controlled environment with 16-h light/8-h dark cycles at 22 °C. Seeds from transformed Arabidopsis plants were surface sterilized by rinsing them in 70% (v/v) ethanol for 1 min, followed by a 15-min treatment in 10% (v/v) bleach + 0.05% (v/v) Triton X-100 and three rinses in sterile-distilled water. Cloning of C. sativus CCD cDNAs—Total RNA and mRNA were isolated from developed C. sativus stigma in two different developmental stages by using Ambion PolyAtrack® and following the manufacturer's protocols (Ambion, Inc.). The first-strand cDNAs were synthesized by RT from 2 μg of total RNA using a first-strand cDNA synthesis kit (GE Healthcare) and an oligo(dT) primer. These cDNAs were used as templates for PCR using degenerate primers: 5′-TT(T/C) GA(T/C) GGN GA(T/C) GGN ATG G-3′; and 5′-GC(A/G) TTC CAN AG(A/G) TG(A/G) AA(A/G) CA(A/G) AA(A/G) CA(A/G) TC-3′. The design of these primers was based on the conserved regions of the bean (AAK38744), tomato (Z97215), and maize (U95953) proteins. Conditions for RT were as follows: 65 °C for 5 min, followed by 37 °C for 1 h, followed by 75 °C for 5 min. Thermal cycling parameters were 2 min at 95 °C, 10 times at 30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 55 °C-0.3 °C/cycles, and 1 min 30 s at 72 °C; 35 times at 30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 50 °C, and 1 min 30 s at 72 °C; and finally 5 min at 72 °C. The PCR products were separated in an agarose gel, purified, ligated into pGEMTeasy (Promega, Madison, WI), and then introduced into E. coli DH5α. In total three different clones were obtained. The full-length clones were obtained by a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction of 3′ and 5′ amplification ends (SMART-RACE cDNA Amplification kit, Clontech) using RNA from stigma tissue, and several primer combinations (Table 1).TABLE 1Primer sequences used for CsCCD gene cloning and analysiscDNASequencePrimerPrimers for CCDs isolationCsCCDsCAYGAYTTYGCNATHACNGRACASenseCCRTGAAANCCRTANGGNACTCGAntisenseCsCCD1a5′–ATGGGAGAAGTAGCGAAGAG–3′Sense5′–TACGTCGGTTTGCTGCCACTGGA–3′AntisenseCsCCD1b5′–ATGGCAAATAAGGAGGAGGCA–3′Sense5′–GTCATGTCTCTGCTTGGTGCT–3′AntisenseCsCCD45′–ATGCAGGTGGACCCAACCAAG–3′Sense5′–CTGCTGTGACAGCAGCTCAGC–3′AntisensePrimers for 3′ and 5′ RACE-PCRsCsCCD1a5′–ATGTACAAGGTATCTTTGACT–3′Sense5′–CAAGCATTAGCATTATGGAAT–3′SenseCsCCD1b5′–TGTGGTTCAGAGGCAATATTTGT–3′Antisense5′–ACAAATATTGCCTCTGAACCACA–3′Antisense5′–TGTGTGTTGATTTCACCCCACAA–3′Antisense5′–AAGACACACCGATACGAGCTC–3′Sense5′–TCAGTAATAGCGAAATCATG–3′AntisenseCsCCD45′–TTCGGTGTGGGATGTTTCGGA–3′Sense5′–GCTTCTACACGATCTGGATG–3′Antisense5′–CGTCGCCCTCGAAGAGGTGGT–3′Sense5′–GATCTTCCTCAGCGTCTTCTC–3′AntisensePrimers for cloning in expression vectorsCsCCD1a5′–GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTTCGAAGGAGATAGAACCATGGGAGAAGTAGCGAAGGA–3′Sense5′–GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTCCTACTCTGCTTGGTGCTTCTGAAGTTC–3′AntisenseCsCCD1b5′–GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTTCGAAGGAGATAGAACCATGGCAAATAAGGAGGAGGCAGA–3′Sense5′–GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTCCTAGTCTCTGCTTGGTGCTTCTG–3′AntisenseCsCCD4a/b5′–GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTTCGAAGGAGATAGAACCATGCAGGTGGACCCAACCAAGG–3′Sense5′–CCGGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTTACTGCTGTGACAGCAGCTCAGC–3′AntisenseCsCCD4a-2115′–GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTTCGAAGGAGATAGAACCATGCAGGTGGACCCAACCAAGG–3′Sense5′GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTCCTACTGCTGTGACAGCAGCTCAGCTTC–3′AntisensePrimers for RT-PCR expression analysisCsCCD1a5′–ATGGGAGAAGTAGCGAAGGAGG–3′Sense5′–TACGTCGGTTTGCTGCCACTGGAG–3′AntisenseCsCCD1b5′–CATCCGTCGCAGTGGACTTAC–3′Sense5′–AGGCATGGAATCCATATGGAAC–3′AntisenseCsCCD4a5′–CAATCTCAAGTATTAGCATTC–3′SenseCsCCD4b5′–CACTACCCATCTCATCAAGA–3′SenseCsCCD4a/b5′–CTGCTGTGACAGCAGCTCAGC–3′AntisensePrimers for location analysisCsCCD45′–GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTGAACCATGGATTATCGGTTGTCATCCTC–3′SenseCsCCD45′–GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTCCTGCTGTGACAGCAGCTCAGCT–3′Antisense Open table in a new tab DNA Sequencing and Analysis of DNA Sequences—Plasmids were sequenced using an automated DNA sequencer (ABI Prism 310, PerkinElmer Life sciences). Computer analyses of the DNA and amino acid sequences were carried out using the WU-BLAST program at ExPASy. Multisequence alignment of the amino acid sequences was carried out using the Clustal W program at the PBIL (npsa-pbil.ibcp.fr). Relative molecular masses and pI values were calculated from the deduced amino acid compositions with the Compute pI/Mw tool available at the ExPASy Molecular Biology Web server (Geneva, Switzerland). Subcellular sorting was predicted at the PSORT Web server for analyzing and predicting protein-sorting signals at the Institute for Molecular and Cellular Biology (Osaka, Japan). Both the phylogenetic analysis and tree construction were carried out using the Clustal W program and the Phylodendron program. Expression Analysis—Gene-specific oligos were designed to be used for the expression analysis (Table 1). For RT-PCR, total RNA was isolated from C. sativus anthers, corms, leaves, petals, roots, stigmas, and style, by grinding fresh tissue in liquid nitrogen to a fine powder and extracting in 1 ml of TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) per 100 mg of fresh tissue weight, according to the protocol of the manufacturer. The RNA was resuspended in 100 μl of RNase-free water and treated with RQ1 RNase-free DNase (Promega, Madison, WI). The DNase was heat inactivated before RT-PCR. The RNA was quantified with a spectro-photometer at OD of 260 and 280 and stored at -80 °C. First-strand cDNAs were synthesized by RT from 2 μg of total RNA using a first-strand cDNA synthesis kit (Amersham Biosciences) and random primers (Promega). As an internal control, the mRNA level of the constitutively expressed ribosomal protein 18 was used (16Rubio A. Fernández P. Fernández J.A. Gomez-Gomez L. Planta. 2004; 219: 955-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). For the determination of semi-quantitative RT-PCR conditions, we carried out PCR for a different number of amplification cycles (20, 25, 30, 35, 40, and 45) using cDNA from yellow, red, anthesis, and postanthesis stigmas (1 μl from a 0.5 dilution from the original RT reaction), and specific primers for CsCCD1a, CsCCD1b, CsCCD4a, CsCCD4b, and RPS18. For quantization, the RT-PCR products were imaged using a UV gel documentation system. Densitometry was performed on each band by application of the IP-010-SD photodocumentation system program (Vilber Lourmat). Exponential amplification for these genes occurred during cycles 30–35. Therefore, 35 cycles were performed for each expression analysis. Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy and Image Analysis— Confocal laser microscopy analysis was performed with stable transgenic Arabidopsis lines. Arabidopsis leaves from 60-week-old plants were observed using a Leica TCS-SL confocal laser scanning microscope. For green fluorescent protein (GFP) detection, the excitation source was an argon ion laser at 488 nm and emission was observed between 510 and 530 nm. Chloroplast autofluorescence was detected between 660 and 700 nm. Expression and Enzymatic Activity—For expression of CsCCD1a, CsCCD1b, CsCCD4, and CsCCD4a-211 the cDNAs were amplified with the att-primers (Table 1) and introduced into the vector pDONR™221 (Invitrogen) by a BP recombination reaction, and from this vector to the destination vector pDES14 by a LR recombination reaction, using Gateway Technology (Invitrogen). The recombinant clones were co-transformed in the E. coli BL21-AI strain with plasmids for the production of β-carotene and zeaxanthin. Positive colonies were selected from the Luria-Bertani medium containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (40 μg/ml) and grown in liquid or solid Luria-Bertani medium before being induced with 2% (w/v) arabinose. Carotenoid-derived metabolites from pelleted or scraped bacteria were extracted and analyzed by HPLC as previously described (17Schwartz S.H. Qin X. Loewen M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46940-46945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 18Castillo R. Fernandez J.A. Gomez-Gomez L. Plant Physiol. 2005; 139: 674-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). For volatile analysis, bacteria were grown and analyzed as described (12Simkin A.J. Underwood B.A. Auldridge M. Loucas H.M. Shibuya K. Schmelz E. Clark D.G. Klee H.J. Plant Physiol. 2004; 136: 3504-3514Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Desorption tubes filled with 200 mg of tenax TA were used instead of SuperQ columns. Volatile organic compounds retained in the tenax tube were thermally desorbed in a Turbomatrix Thermal Desorber (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Primary desorption was performed at 300 °C for 10 min under an 80 ml/min helium flow, without inlet split, maintaining the cold trap at -30 °C. Secondary desorption was performed at 300 °C for 1 min, with a total flow of 22.5 ml/min and a 20 ml/min outlet split. Vector Construction and Plant Transformation—To produce transgenic plants in which GFP-tagged CsCCD4a protein was expressed under the control of the 35S promoter, vector pGWB5 was used (19Nakagawa T. Kurose T. Hino T. Tanaka K. Kawamukai M. Niwa Y. Toyooka K. Matsuoka K. Jinbo T. Kimura T. Biosci. Bioeng. 2007; 104: 34-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar). The strategy followed for cloning CsCCD4a in this vector was based on Gateway Technology, and the oligonucleotides used are indicated in Table 1. The amplified fragment was introduced into the vector pDNOR221 by a BP recombination reaction (Invitrogen), and from this vector to the destination vector pGWB5 by a LR recombination reaction. The recombinant pGWB5 vector was transferred into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101 by electroporation and bacteria were selected on YEB agar with 50 μgml-1 kanamycin and hygromicin and 100 μgml-1 rifampicin and 25 μgml-1 gentamicin. Arabidopsis plants were transformed by floral dipping (20Clough S.J. Bent A.F. Plant J. 1998; 16: 735-743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and transformants selected on Murashige and Skoog agar with 50 μgml-1 kanamycin and hygromicin. Volatile Collection and Analysis from Fresh Stigma Tissue— HS-SPME extraction conditions were used: 10 mg of C. sativus stigma from different stages were introduced into a 22-ml crimp cap vial, together with 10 μl of a 1 ppm methylsalicylate solution as an internal standard. Then 65-μm PDMS/DVB fiber (polydimethylsiloxane/divinylbenzene) (Supelco, Pennsylvania, PA) was exposed to the headspace for 1 h at 30 °C while being shaken at 300 rpm. After sampling, the fiber was immediately thermally desorbed in the GC injector. A desorption time of 1 min at 250 °C was used in the splitless mode. Before sampling, each fiber was reconditioned for 5 min in a GC injector port at 250 °C. Triplicate analyses were performed on each stage. Volatile organic compounds were analyzed by GC/MS using a Clarus 600 gas chromatograph from PerkinElmer, equipped with a ZB-5ms capillary column (30 m, 0.25 mm, 0.25 μm) (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA). Oven programming conditions were 40 °C for 2 min, 5 °C/min ramp until 180 °C, 15 °C/min ramp until 250 °C, then 5 min at 250 °C. Helium was used as the carrier gas at a constant pressure of 19.5 psi. Detection was performed by a PerkinElmer Clarus 600T mass spectrometer in the EI mode (ionization energy, 70 eV; source temperature, 150 °C). The acquisition was made in scan mode (m/z range 35–250). The identification of peaks was initially determined by mass spectrometry of the collected volatiles and subsequently by co-elution with a known standard (Sigma), except for megastigma-4,6,8-triene, which was identified by comparison with mass spectra in the NIST05 library. Cloning and Characterization of cDNAs from C. sativus Stigmas Coding CCD Enzymes—To identify dioxygenases involved in apocarotenoid production, we have used a homology-based strategy, taking advantage of specific carotenoid dioxygenase motifs. Two populations of cDNAs were prepared by reverse transcription of poly(A)+ from total RNA isolated from C. sativus stigmas at the yellow and scarlet stages. DNA fragments were amplified by degenerate primers CCD-F and CCD-R. Initially three fragments were obtained, and subsequently labeled CsCCD1a, CsCCD1b, and CsCCD4 (GenBank™ accession numbers AJ416712, AJ416713, and AJ416714). Specific oligonucleotides were designed to obtain the full-length clones by RACE-PCR (Table 1). Complete cDNA clones were obtained for each dioxygenase and 100% identity was found between CsCCD1a and the previously isolated CsCCD (14Bouvier F. Suire C. Mutterer J. Camara B. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 47-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), and 70% between CsCCD1b and CsCCD. Two different full cDNA clones were obtained for CsCCD4: CsCCD4a and CsCCD4b. A 98% identity was obtained between CsCCD4a and CsCCD4b that can be considered as allelic variants, due to the triploid nature of C. sativus. CsCCD4a (580 amino acids) and CsCCD4b (569 amino acids) showed 100 and 98% similarity in 369 amino acids with the previously isolated CsZCD (369 amino acids) (14Bouvier F. Suire C. Mutterer J. Camara B. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 47-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), respectively. However, CsCCD4a and -b are more than 200 amino acids longer than CsZCD. A typical cleavable plastid transit peptide was predicted for all three CsCCD4 enzymes (21Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4923) Google Scholar). The location prediction program PSORT predicted that all the CsCCD4 enzymes would be localized at the chloroplast. Because the stigmas do not have chloroplasts, chromoplasts seem to be the most likely location for these enzymes. The subcellular localization of CsCCD4 enzymes was experimentally tested using fusions to the GFP. Because CsCCD4a and CsCCD4b proteins are identical in the N-t signal plastid transit peptide and in general very similar, we performed the location experiments only with one of them. Confocal imaging of the 35S-driven CsCCD4a-GFP fusion protein in 5-week-old transgenic Arabidopsis plants confirmed the plastid location of the protein in mature leaves (Fig. 1A). CsCCD4a-GFP accumulates in plastids in concentrated foci, as have been previously observed for other plastoglobule-localized proteins (22Naested H. Holm A. Jenkins T. Nielsen H.B. Harris C.A.

Interestingly, no signal was detected in young seedlings, neither in the cotyledons nor in the first young leaves. This fact is in agreement with the variation in the number and size of plastoglobules observed during the development of leaves in Arabidopsis (25Kaup M.T. Froese C.D. Thompson J.E. Plant Physiol. 2002; 129: 1616-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). It is probable that the small size and low number of plastoglobules in young leaves did not allow the detection of the GFP signal by confocal imaging. Plastoglobules are ubiquitously found in all types of plastids (26Lichtenthaler H.K. Endeavor. 1968; 27: 144-149Google Scholar, 27Vishnevetsky M. Ovadis M. Vainstein A.

Peltier J.B. van Wijk K.J. Plant Physiol. 2006; 140: 984-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar), in addition to their well known function of carotenoid storage and sequestration (24Vidi P.A.

A dioxygenase from Arabidopsis, At4g19170 (assigned CCD4 for carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase; but also named NCED4 for 9-cis-epoxy-carotenoid dioxygenase) was also localized in chloroplast plastoglobules (15Ytterberg A.J. Peltier J.B. van Wijk K.J. Plant Physiol. 2006; 140: 984-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Sequence alignment of CsCCD1a (CsCCD), CsCCD1b, CsCCD4a, and CsCCD4b with known NCEDs involved in ABA biosynthesis and other plant CCDs was performed using the ClustalW program, thus generating a phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1B). The phylogenetic tree showed four different groups. One included NCED proteins, another included CCD1 enzymes; a third class included the Arabidopsis enzymes CCD7 and CCD8, implicated in synthesis of a novel apocarotenoid hormone that controls lateral shoot growth (28Booker J.

CsCCD1a (CsCCD) is inside the CCD1 cluster, where some of its members are shown to cleave zeaxanthin at the 9,10(9′,10′) positions (14Bouvier F. Suire C. Mutterer J. Camara B. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 47-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), whereas CsCCD1b is closely related to the CCD1 cluster. Activity of CsCCD Proteins in E. coli—To determine the potential function of CsCCD1a, CsCCD1b, and CsCCD4a/b, the cDNAs were cloned into the E. coli expression vector pDEST14, and the recombinant proteins were expressed in E. coli strains that accumulate different carotenoid compounds (30Cunningham F.X.

https://openalex.org/W1965663626,"Epidemiological studies suggest that complex mental activity may reduce the risk for dementia, however an underlying mechanism remains unclear. Our objective was to determine whether individual differences in lifespan complex mental activity are linked to altered rates of hippocampal atrophy independent of global measures of neurodegeneration.Thirty seven healthy older individuals had their complex mental activity levels estimated using the Lifetime of Experiences Questionnaire (LEQ) and completed serial MRI investigations at baseline and three years follow-up. Hippocampal volume and semi-automatic quantitation of whole brain volume (WBV) and white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) were compared at both time points.Higher LEQ scores were correlated with hippocampal volume independent of covariates at the three year follow-up stage (r = 0.43, p = 0.012). Moreover, those with higher LEQ scores experienced less hippocampal atrophy over the follow-up period (r = 0.41, p = 0.02). High LEQ individuals had less than half the hippocampal volume decline of low LEQ individuals in a multivariate analysis (F = 4.47, p = 0.042). No parallel changes were found in measures of WBV and WMHs.High level of complex mental activity across the lifespan was correlated with a reduced rate of hippocampal atrophy. This finding could not be explained by general differences in intracranial volume, larger hippocampi at baseline, presence of hypertensive disease, gender or low mood. Our results suggest that neuroprotection in medial temporal lobe may be one mechanism underlying the link between mental activity and lower rates of dementia observed in population-based studies. Additional studies are required to further explore this novel finding."
https://openalex.org/W2058249580,"Complex I has reactive thiols on its surface that interact with the mitochondrial glutathione pool and are implicated in oxidative damage in many pathologies. However, the Cys residues and the thiol modifications involved are not known. Here we investigate complex I thiol modification within oxidatively stressed mammalian mitochondria, containing physiological levels of glutathione and glutaredoxin 2. In mitochondria incubated with the thiol oxidant diamide, complex I is only glutathionylated on the 75-kDa subunit. Of the 17 Cys residues on the 75-kDa subunit, 6 are not involved in iron-sulfur centers, making them plausible candidates for glutathionylation. Mass spectrometry of complex I from oxidatively stressed bovine heart mitochondria showed that only Cys-531 and Cys-704 were glutathionylated. The other four non-iron-sulfur center Cys residues remained as free thiols. Complex I glutathionylation also occurred in response to relatively mild oxidative stress caused by increased superoxide production from the respiratory chain. Although complex I glutathionylation within oxidatively stressed mitochondria correlated with loss of activity, it did not increase superoxide formation, and reversal of glutathionylation did not restore complex I activity. Comparison with the known structure of the 75-kDa ortholog Nqo3 from <i>Thermus thermophilus</i> complex I suggested that Cys-531 and Cys-704 are on the surface of mammalian complex I, exposed to the mitochondrial glutathione pool. These findings suggest that Cys-531 and Cys-704 may be important in preventing oxidative damage to complex I by reacting with free radicals and other damaging species, with subsequent glutathionylation recycling the thiyl radicals and sulfenic acids formed on the Cys residues back to free thiols."
https://openalex.org/W2098417675,"Despite extensive literature on vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression and regulation by steroid hormones, the lack of clear understanding of the mechanisms of angiogenesis in the endometrium is a major limitation for use of antiangiogenic therapy targeting endometrial vessels. In the current work, we used the rhesus macaque as a primate model and the decidualized mouse uterus as a murine model to examine angiogenesis during endometrial breakdown and regeneration. We found that blockade of VEGF action with VEGF Trap, a potent VEGF blocker, completely inhibited neovascularization during endometrial regeneration in both models but had no marked effect on preexisting or newly formed vessels, suggesting that VEGF is essential for neoangiogenesis but not survival of mature vessels in this vascular bed. Blockade of VEGF also blocked reepithelialization in both the postmenstrual endometrium and the mouse uterus after decidual breakdown, evidence that VEGF has pleiotropic effects in the endometrium. In vitro studies with a scratch wound assay showed that the migration of luminal epithelial cells during repair involved signaling through VEGF receptor 2-neuropilin 1 (VEGFR2-NP1) receptors on endometrial stromal cells. The leading front of tissue growth during endometrial repair was strongly hypoxic, and this hypoxia was the local stimulus for VEGF expression and angiogenesis in this tissue. In summary, we provide novel experimental data indicating that VEGF is essential for endometrial neoangiogenesis during postmenstrual/postpartum repair."
https://openalex.org/W2003036700,"Resistance to cell death is a hallmark of cancer. Autophagy is a survival mechanism activated in response to nutrient deprivation; however, excessive autophagy will ultimately induce cell death in a nonapoptotic manner. The present study demonstrates that CCL2 protects prostate cancer PC3 cells from autophagic death, allowing prolonged survival in serum-free conditions. Upon serum starvation, CCL2 induced survivin up-regulation in PC3, DU 145, and C4-2B prostate cancer cells. Both cell survival and survivin expression were stunted in CCL2-stimulated PC3 cells when treated either with the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 (2 μm) or the Akt-specific inhibitor-X (Akti-X; 2.5 μm). Furthermore, CCL2 significantly reduced light chain 3-II (LC3-II) in serum-starved PC3; in contrast, treatment with LY294002 or Akti-X reversed the effect of CCL2 on LC3-II levels, suggesting that CCL2 signaling limits autophagy in these cells. Upon serum deprivation, the analysis of LC3 localization by immunofluorescence revealed a remarkable reduction in LC3 punctate after CCL2 stimulation. CCL2 treatment also resulted in a higher sustained mTORC1 activity as measured by an increase in phospho-p70S6 kinase (Thr389). Rapamycin, an inducer of autophagy, both down-regulated survivin and decreased PC3 cell viability in serum-deprived conditions. Treatment with CCL2, however, allowed cells to partially resist rapamycin-induced death, which correlated with survivin protein levels. In two stable transfectants expressing survivin-specific short hairpin RNA, generated from PC3, survivin protein levels controlled both cell viability and LC3 localization in response to CCL2 treatment. Altogether, these findings indicate that CCL2 protects prostate cancer PC3 cells from autophagic death via the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt/survivin pathway and reveal survivin as a critical molecule in this survival mechanism.

Extensive research has emerged in recent years revealing the roles of cytokines and chemokines, not only in their involvement in chemotaxis but also in tumorigenesis and cancer cell proliferation, survival, adhesion, and invasion (1Reiland J.

The CC class of chemokines, named for the first two conserved cysteine residues, have been shown to be highly involved in mechanisms of tumorigenesis within the skeletal systems, specifically osteoclastic resorption, osteoblast induction, and bone remodeling (4Bar-Shavit Z. J. Cell. Biochem. 2007; 102: 1130-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). These cytokine-mediated interactions in the bone microenvironment are critical to the promotion of cell survival and proliferation of metastatic tumors, which inevitably result in patient morbidity and mortality (5Logothetis C.J. Lin S.H. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 6Pienta K.J. Loberg R. Clin.

The CC chemokine, CCL2 (MCP-1 (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1)), although expressed only at low levels in prostate cancer cell lines, is highly secreted by human bone marrow endothelial cells. It is found in the microenvironment of prostate cancer bone metastases, where it has multiple effects on both tumor and host cells (7Loberg R.D. Day L.L. Harwood J. Ying C. St. John L.N. Giles R. Neeley C.K. Pienta K.J. Neoplasia. 2006; 8: 578-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). CCL2 dose-dependently induces prostate cancer cell proliferation and invasion (8Lu Y. Cai Z.

Chemokine-mediated signal transduction is initiated through binding to seven-transmembrane domain heterotrimeric G-protein-coupled receptors (10O'Boyle G. Brain J.G. Kirby J.A. Ali S. Mol.

Immunol. 2005; 175: 1599-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Specifically, CCL2 interacts with the CCR2B integral membrane receptor, which is responsive to all members of the CC chemokine family (10O'Boyle G. Brain J.G. Kirby J.A. Ali S. Mol.

The current proposed mechanism suggests that CCL2 stimulation activates a signaling cascade, in which the Gβγ subunits dissociate from the heterotrimeric Gαβγ-receptor complex. Following dissociation, the Gβγ heterodimer will either rapidly activate, by direct interaction, two phosphoinositide-specific lipase isoenzymes, PLCβ2 and PLCβ3, or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) 3The abbreviations used are:PI3Kphosphatidylinositol 3-kinasemTORmammalian target of rapamycinLC3light chain 3FBSfetal bovine serumAkti-XAkt-specific inhibitor-XPBSphosphate-buffered salinePIpropidium iodidesiRNAsmall interfering RNAshRNAshort hairpin RNAIAPinhibitors of apoptosisIGFinsulin-like growth factor. γ, resulting in downstream activation of protein kinase C and protein kinase B (Akt) or the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade, respectively (13Thelen M. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). In addition, G-protein complex dissociation induces activation of PI3K via the Gα subunit, which, in turn, either activates PKB/Akt via phosphorylation at Thr308 and Ser473 by PDK1 and PDK2, respectively, or the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade via intermediate cytoskeleton-associated kinases (10O'Boyle G.

Macroautophagy (referred to as autophagy herein) is a highly evolutionarily conserved catabolic mechanism responsible for the removal and breakdown of cellular materials as a means to maintain intracellular homeostasis (17Codogno P. Meijer A.J. Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 1509-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar, 18Levine B. Kroemer G. Cell. 2008; 132: 27-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5589) Google Scholar). Functioning at normal basal levels, autophagy is one of the major mechanisms for the degradation of proteins, macromolecules, damaged organelles, and other unwanted structures (19Pattingre S. Espert L. Biard-Piechaczyk M. Codogno P. Biochimie (Paris). 2008; 90: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). However, autophagosome formation can also be stimulated as a response to stresses, such as oxidative damage and nutrient deprivation, functioning to remove protein aggregates and provide required amino acids essential for metabolic processes and cell survival (17Codogno P. Meijer A.J. Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 1509-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar, 18Levine B. Kroemer G. Cell. 2008; 132: 27-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5589) Google Scholar). Excessive autophagy will also inevitably trigger autophagic cell death or “type II programmed cell death” (type I programmed cell death being apoptosis). Due to emerging links between autophagic aberrations and cancer, there is rapidly growing support that this type II programmed cell death may also function as a suppressor of tumorigenesis (18Levine B. Kroemer G. Cell. 2008; 132: 27-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5589) Google Scholar). Autophagic degradation of intracellular materials is initiated by the formation of double membrane-bound vacuoles, termed autophagosomes, which consume part of the cell's cytoplasm, including elements to be degraded. Digestion is completed upon autophagosome maturation, via fusion with endocytic lysosomes. This process requires activation of the downstream product of class III PI3K. Conversely, products of class I PI3K, phosphatidylinositol-3,4-biphosphate, and phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate exhibit an inhibitory effect (17Codogno P. Meijer A.J. Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 1509-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar). When nutrients are abundant, class I PI3K promotes activation of the Ser/Thr protein kinase, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), through receptor tyrosine kinases; mTOR thereby suppresses autophagosome formation (18Levine B. Kroemer G. Cell. 2008; 132: 27-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5589) Google Scholar). On the other hand, LY294002-mediated inhibition of PI3K and negative regulation of mTOR by rapamycin both significantly induce autophagy. mTOR activates downstream Ser/Thr kinase P70S6, which thereafter phosphorylates ribosomal protein S6 (17Codogno P. Meijer A.J. Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 1509-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar, 18Levine B. Kroemer G.

Biochimie (Paris). 2008; 90: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar), which is reliably detectable by immunoblotting and serves as an accurate measure of cellular autophagy for this study. During autophagosome formation, cytosolic microtubule-associated protein light chain 3-I (LC3-I) is conjugated with phosphatidylethanolamine and converted to LC3-II. This phosphatidylethanolamine-conjugated LC3-II, detectable by immunoblotting, is present specifically on isolation membranes and autophagosomes (20Mizushima N. Yoshimori T. Autophagy. 2007; 3: 542-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (1974) Google Scholar) and therefore serves a second and widely accepted approach to monitoring autophagic flux for this study. Although CCL2 is widely accepted to play a direct role in inflammation, tumorigenesis, and chemotaxis, its role in cell survival has not been extensively examined. In the present study, we demonstrate that CCL2 confers a distinct survival advantage to PC3 prostate cancer cells by regulation of autophagic death. Furthermore, we have established that CCL2 functions primarily through a PI3K/Akt-dependent pathway following up-regulation of the survival gene, survivin (BIRC5). Cell Lines—The androgen-independent human prostate cancer cell lines, PC3 and DU 145 were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA). Cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Invitrogen) and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic (Invitrogen). The human prostate C4-2B cells (UroCor, Inc., Oklahoma City, OK) were derived from LNCaP cells through several passages via castrated nude mice and isolated from the tumor that metastasized to bone (21Wu T.T. Sikes R.A. Cui Q. Thalmann G.N. Kao C. Murphy C.F. Yang H. Zhau H.E. Balian G. Chung L.W. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 77: 887-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The C4-2B cells were maintained in T medium supplemented with 10% FBS (Invitrogen) and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic (Invitrogen). Regular passaging was performed at 70-80% confluence by trypsinization, using 1× trypsin and 0.05% EDTA, followed by resuspension in complete medium. Cells were grown and maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2, 95% air atmosphere. WST-1 Cell Viability Assay—Dye conversion at 440 nm of 4-[3-(4-Idophenyl)-2-(4-nitrophenyl)-2H-5-tetrazolio]-1,3-benzene disulfonate to formazan (Cell Proliferation Reagent WST-1; Roche Applied Science) was used to assess cell viability and chemosensitivity of PC3 cells. Cells were grown to 80% confluence and then serum-starved for 16-18 h. Synchronized cells were plated at 104 cells/well into 96-well flat bottom tissue culture plates (catalog number 3596; Costar) and were allowed to attach for 6 h. Cells were then treated with increasing concentrations of inhibitors and/or CCL2 chemokine (Apollo Cytokine Research) or IGF-1 (catalog number 291-G1; R&D Systems) and incubated for 24-168 h. WST-1 reagent was added following the manufacturer's instructions, and plates were returned to 37 °C for 105 min. Dye conversion at an absorbance of 440 nm was ascertained by the VERSAmax Microplate Reader and analyzed using Softmax Pro 3.12 software. The aforementioned technique was applied to dose-response and time course assays to evaluate the effects of the following inhibitors: LY294002 phosphoinsitide-3-kinase inhibitor (catalog number 709920; Cayman Chemical) and Akt inhibitor X (Akti-X; catalog number 124020; Calbiochem) (22Thimmaiah K.N.

Rapamycin (catalog number 553211; Calbiochem) was also assessed using this technique; however, prior to treatment, PC3 cells were incubated for 24 h, and the cell viability was evaluated 24 h post-treatment. LIVE/DEAD® Cell Viability Assay—PC3 cells were serum-starved in RPMI 1640 medium for 16-18 h and then plated into Lab-Tek II dual chamber slides (catalog number 155379; Nalge Nunc International) at a density of 2.5 × 105 cells/ml. Cells were allowed to attach for 6 h, and CCL2 (100 ng/ml) was added to one chamber of each slide. Cells were then incubated for 24-168 h, and viability of CCL2-treated and untreated PC3 cells was evaluated using the LIVE/DEAD® viability/cytotoxicity kit for mammalian cells (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunofluorescence was visualized using an Olympus IX71 microscope. Images were captured using a ×20 objective at 560- and 535-nm excitation wave-lengths and 645- and 610-nm emission wavelengths, respective to each reagent dye. Real Time PCR—cDNA was generated from control and CCL2-treated PC3 cells at 72 h using the High Capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (catalog number 4368814; Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Real time PCR analysis was performed using Taqman Gene Expression Master Mix (catalog number 4369016; Applied Biosystems) and a survivin-specific Taqman predesigned probe assay (catalog number Hs00977611_g1; Applied Biosystems). Finally, mRNA expression analysis was completed by the University of Michigan Microarray Core Facility, using the ABI 7900 HT sequence detection system. Western Blot Analysis—Prostate cancer cells (PC3, DU 145, and C4-2B) were grown to 80% confluence on 150-cm2 tissue culture flasks (Falcon) in appropriate medium, supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic. FBS-containing medium was removed, and flasks were washed four times with Hanks' buffered medium (Invitrogen). PC3 and DU145 cells were synchronized by starvation in serum-free RPMI 1640 for 16-18 h at 37 °C. Cells were detached with mild treatment, using 0.25 mm EDTA pH 8.0 (Invitrogen), at 37 °C for 20-25 min, and then plated in either 6-well or 100-mm culture plates at a density of 2.5 × 105 cells/ml. Cells were allowed to attach for 6 h prior to treatment with inhibitors (as specified above) and/or CCL2/IGF-1 (100 ng/ml). C4-2B cells were plated in complete medium, and 16 h later the medium was replaced by serum-free T-medium containing CCL2 (100 ng/ml). After treatment, cells were harvested at increasing time points in radioimmune precipitation cell lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris base, pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 20% SDS, 1 μm okadaic acid, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin). Protein samples were sonicated, followed by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min. Supernatants were collected, and protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Protein lysates were electrophoresed through 4-20% Tris-glycine SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride according to the instructions of Invitrogen. Membranes were blocked in 5% milk-TBST (Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween) for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary (rabbit) antibodies (Cell Signaling), diluted 1:1000 in blocking solution. 16-24 h later, membranes were washed three times with TBST and incubated for 1 h with goat anti-rabbit IgG, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (catalog number 7074; Cell Signaling), diluted 1:2000 in blocking solution. Protein expression was visualized by ECL chemiluminescence (Millipore). Finally, β-actin monoclonal antibody (catalog number 4967L; Cell Signaling) was used as a loading control for all membranes. Cell Cycle Analysis—PC3 cells were serum-starved in RPMI 1640 for 16 h and then plated (2 × 106 cells/plate) into 100-mm tissue culture plates. Cells were allowed to attach for 6 h. One-half of the plates were then treated with CCL2 (100 ng/ml), and cells from both treated and untreated groups were collected at 48, 72, 96, and 120 h, following standard trypsinization procedure. Collected cells were resuspended in 500 μl of PBS (Invitrogen) and fixed by adding 500 μl of 100% EtOH (equilibrated to -20 °C). Fixed cells were stored for a minimum of 20 min at 4 °C until samples from all aforementioned time points were collected. Following fixation, cells were pelleted, EtOH/PBS was decanted, and cells were resuspended in 500 μl of propidium iodide (PI)-RNase solution (50 μg/ml propidium iodide (Invitrogen), 100 μg/ml RNase A (Qiagen), diluted in PBS) and then incubated at room temperature for 20 min. PI-stained samples were analyzed on a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) with Cell Quest Pro (BD Biosciences) software. Viable cells were gated based upon forward scatter and side scatter parameters. PI fluorescence was detected in the FL2 channel on a logarithmic scale and in the FL3 channel on a linear scale. Voltage adjustments were performed for each sample to place the G0/G1 peak at a standard of 400 on the linear scale. For each sample, 104 events were collected for analysis as the Boolean intersection of viable cells, based upon forward scatter/side scatter gate. Single cell analysis was based upon the FL3 width versus FL3 area doublet discrimination gate. The relative percentages of cells found within each phase of the cell cycle were determined with ModFit LT cell cycle analysis software (Verity House). A linearity factor (G2/G1) of 1.84 was used for all samples. Sub-G0/G1 DNA content (apoptotic cells) was assessed by analysis of PI fluorescence detected in the FL2 channel. Transient Transfections—PC3 cells were synchronized in 150-cm2 tissue culture flasks, as previously described, and then plated in serum-free RPMI 1640 at 104 cells/well, in 96-well plates. Plates were incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 overnight. The following day, cells were transfected with either survivin-specific or nonsilencing siRNA at both 50 and 100 nm, according to instructions provided with the SignalSilence (R) survivin siRNA Kit (catalog number 6350S; Cell Signaling). Cells were transfected in replicates of 10 for each concentration of siRNA. Following transfection, plates were incubated for an additional 24 h. CCL2 (100 ng/ml) was then added, and the cells were further incubated for 72 h. Finally, cell viability was assessed by WST-1 dye conversion, as previously described. Generation of Stable Cell Lines—Two independent survivin short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) (shS-1 and shS-2; catalog numbers RHS4430-98520325 and RHS4430-99140887, respectively; Open Biosystems) were packaged into lentivirus by the University of Michigan Vector Core, using psPAX2 and pMD2.G mammalian expression lentiviral helper plasmids (catalog numbers 12260 and 12259; Addgene). PC3 cells were trypsinized and seeded at 106 cells/100-mm tissue culture plate in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic. Cells were allowed to grow in complete medium for 24 h. Following incubation, medium was replaced with 10 ml/plate of fresh FBS-containing RPMI 1640. To transfect PC3, 200 μl of each lentiviral shRNA (shS-1 and shS-2, 10× concentrated) was added dropwise to previously seeded cells, in triplicate. Plates were transferred immediately to 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 24 h. Cells were then trypsinized and plated in complete medium, containing 5 μg/ml puromycin (P9620-10ML; Sigma) and incubated for 48 h. Following incubation, cells were washed three times with Hanks' balanced salt solution to remove unattached cells, and medium was replaced with 10 ml of RPMI 1640, containing 2 μg/ml puromycin. Cells were supplemented with this medium every 3-4 days, until GFP-expressing colonies were observed. GFP immunofluorescence was assessed using the Olympus IX71 microscope (×20 magnification) fitted with a 560-nm excitation and 645-nm emission filter. Visible colonies were trypsinized and plated into 100-mm tissue culture plates and then grown to 80% confluence in the presence of 2 μg/ml puromycin prior to cell viability and Western blot analysis, as described above. Stable cell lines were named shS-1 and shS-2, corresponding to transfected survivin shRNA. Immunofluorescence—PC3, shS-1, and shS-2 cells were serum-starved in RPMI 1640 medium for 16 h at 37 °C and then plated into Lab-Tek II dual chamber culture slides (catalog number 177380; Nunc) and allowed to attach at 37 °C for 6 h. Cells were then either left untreated or treated with CCL2 (100 ng/ml) and incubated for 72 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed briefly with PBS and then fixed with 3% formaldehyde-PBS for 15 min. Fixed cells were then incubated with LC3B primary antibody (diluted 1:200 in PBS/Triton) for 24 h, as per the procedures recommended by Cell Signaling. Following incubation, cells were washed as per the manufacturer's instructions and then incubated with fluorochrome secondary antibodies (diluted 1:200 in PBS/Triton) for 2 h at room temperature in the dark. For parental PC3 cells, AlexaFluor 488-conjugated goat-anti-rabbit IgG (catalog number A11034; Invitrogen) was used as secondary antibody, whereas for shS-1 and shS-2 cells the secondary antibody was replaced by AlexaFluor 647-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (catalog number A21245; Invitrogen) to prevent fluorescence interference with the GFP incorporated during stable transfection. Following secondary staining, coverslips were applied with Prolong® Gold Antifade reagent (catalog number P-36930; Invitrogen), and slides were transferred to 4 °C for at least 24 h prior to immunofluorescence analysis. Images were obtained using an Olympus IX-71 FluoView 500 laser-scanning confocal microscope at ×60 magnification with a PlanApo N oil immersion lens, with a numerical aperture of 1.42. Flow View TIEMPO software version 4.3 was used to obtain all Z-stack images and the corresponding maximum intensity projections. Immunoprecipitation—PC3 cells were grown to 80% confluence and then synchronized for 16 h by serum starvation. 3.5 × 105 cells were plated into 100-mm tissue culture plates (catalog number 83.1802; Sarstedt) and allowed to attach for 6 h at 37 °C. Following attachment, plates were treated or not with CCL2 (100 ng/ml) for 48 h at 37 °C. Cells with or without CCL2 were harvested in 300 μl/plate cell lysis buffer (catalog number 9803; Cell Signaling), containing 1 μm okadaic acid. Cell extracts were obtained by sonication and centrifugation for 20 min at 13,000 rpm. 50 μl of cell lysate from each condition (with or without CCL2) was removed and stored at -20 °C for the analysis of inputs. Samples were precleared for 2 h at 4 °C with 150 μl, per condition, of Dynabeads Protein G (catalog number 100.04D; Invitrogen). After preclearing, survivin rabbit monoclonal antibody (catalog number 2808; Cell Signaling) or normal rabbit IgG (catalog number 2729S; Cell Signaling) antibodies were added to cell lysates at 1:100 or 1:200 dilutions and incubated at 4 °C overnight. Dynabeads were washed with cell lysis buffer and placed onto Dynal MPC™ magnets (catalog number 120.20D; Invitrogen) for 2 min to remove wash. Samples were added to washed beads, and the immunoprecipitation was carried out following the recommended procedures of Invitrogen; however, all washes were performed using cell lysis buffer (Cell Signaling). Immunoprecipitates and inputs were separated by electrophoresis on a 4-20% SDS-PAGE and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes following standard Western blotting procedure. Membranes were incubated overnight with LC3B antibody (catalog number 2775; Cell Signaling), diluted 1:1000 in 5% milk-TBST, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (catalog number 7074; Cell Signaling). Membranes were also probed with survivin monoclonal antibody (Cell Signaling) to verify efficiency and specificity. Statistical Analysis—All average values are presented as means ± S.E. Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism software and one-way analysis of variance combined with Bonferroni's test. A probability level of less than 0.05 was considered significant. CCL2 Signaling Protects PC3 Cells from Death upon Serum Deprivation—The identification of CCL2-mediated up-regulation in the tumor-bone microenvironment of prostate cancer metastases (7Loberg R.D. Day L.L. Harwood J. Ying C. St. John L.N. Giles R. Neeley C.K. Pienta K.J. Neoplasia. 2006; 8: 578-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) requires a greater understanding of the role this chemokine plays in the development and progression of prostate cancer. The studies here reveal that CCL2 is a powerful inducer of PC3 cell survival upon serum deprivation. Survival was analyzed at different times by a WST-1 assay. At concentrations of 50 and 100 ng/ml, CCL2 maintained cell viability up to 168 h of serum starvation (Fig. 1A). This result was further corroborated using the Live/Dead® viability/cytotoxicity assay, which allows simultaneous determination of live (green) and dead (red) cells. CCL2 protection from cell death was evidenced by a higher average ratio (3-5 times) of live/dead cells as compared with control cells (Fig. 1, B and C). After 2 weeks, the majority of cells exposed to CCL2 were able to survive in contrast to control cells, suggesting that CCL2 confers an advantage upon PC3 cells to survive in adverse conditions, such as limited nutrients and growth factors (Fig. 1D). Furthermore, after 4 weeks in serum-free medium, CCL2-stimulated cells responded to the readdition of complete medium (10% FBS)"

https://openalex.org/W2015603830,"Cells can show not only spontaneous movement but also tactic responses to environmental signals. Since the former can be regarded as the basis to realize the latter, playing essential roles in various cellular functions, it is important to investigate spontaneous movement quantitatively at different physiological conditions in relation to a cell's physiological functions. For that purpose, we observed a series of spontaneous movements by Dictyostelium cells at different developmental periods by using a single cell tracking system. Using statistical analysis of these traced data, we found that cells showed complex dynamics with anomalous diffusion and that their velocity distribution had power-law tails in all conditions. Furthermore, as development proceeded, average velocity and persistency of the movement increased and as too did the exponential behavior in the velocity distribution. Based on these results, we succeeded in applying a generalized Langevin model to the experimental data. With this model, we discuss the relation of spontaneous cell movement to cellular physiological function and its relevance to behavioral strategies for cell survival."
https://openalex.org/W2092672926,"Tankyrases are proteins with poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase activity. Human tankyrases post-translationally modify multiple proteins involved in processes including maintenance of telomere length, sister telomere association, and trafficking of glut4-containing vesicles. To date, however, little is known about in vivo functions for tankyrases. We recently reported that body size was significantly reduced in mice deficient for tankyrase 2, but that these mice otherwise appeared developmentally normal. In the present study, we report generation of tankyrase 1-deficient and tankyrase 1 and 2 double-deficient mice, and use of these mutant strains to systematically assess candidate functions of tankyrase 1 and tankyrase 2 in vivo. No defects were observed in development, telomere length maintenance, or cell cycle regulation in tankyrase 1 or tankyrase 2 knockout mice. In contrast to viability and normal development of mice singly deficient in either tankyrase, deficiency in both tankyrase 1 and tankyrase 2 results in embryonic lethality by day 10, indicating that there is substantial redundancy between tankyrase 1 and tankyrase 2, but that tankyrase function is essential for embryonic development."
https://openalex.org/W1986281170,"Epidemiological studies have linked maternal infection during pregnancy to later development of neuropsychiatric disorders in the offspring. In mice, experimental inflammation during embryonic development impairs behavioral and cognitive performances in adulthood. Synaptic dysfunctions may be at the origin of cognitive impairments, however the link between prenatal inflammation and synaptic defects remains to be established.In this study, we show that prenatal alteration of microglial function, including inflammation, induces delayed synaptic dysfunction in the adult. DAP12 is a microglial signaling protein expressed around birth, mutations of which in the human induces the Nasu-Hakola disease, characterized by early dementia. We presently report that synaptic excitatory currents in mice bearing a loss-of-function mutation in the DAP12 gene (DAP12(KI) mice) display enhanced relative contribution of AMPA. Furthermore, neurons from DAP12(KI) P0 pups cultured without microglia develop similar synaptic alterations, suggesting that a prenatal dysfunction of microglia may impact synaptic function in the adult. As we observed that DAP12(KI) microglia overexpress genes for IL1beta, IL6 and NOS2, which are inflammatory proteins, we analyzed the impact of a pharmacologically-induced prenatal inflammation on synaptic function. Maternal injection of lipopolysaccharides induced activation of microglia at birth and alteration of glutamatergic synapses in the adult offspring. Finally, neurons cultured from neonates born to inflamed mothers and cultured without microglia also displayed altered neuronal activity.Our results demonstrate that prenatal inflammation is sufficient to induce synaptic alterations with delay. We propose that these alterations triggered by prenatal activation of microglia provide a cellular basis for the neuropsychiatric defects induced by prenatal inflammation."

Mutations in CGI-58 are shown to be responsible for a rare genetic disorder known as Chanarin-Dorfman syndrome, characterized by an excessive accumulation of triacylglycerol in several tissues and ichthyosis. We have earlier reported that YLR099c encoding Ict1p in Saccharomyces cerevisiae can acylate lysophosphatidic acid to phosphatidic acid. Here we report that human CGI-58 is closely related to ICT1. To understand the biochemical function of cgi-58, the gene was overexpressed in Escherichia coli, and the purified recombinant protein was found to specifically acylate lysophosphatidic acid in an acyl-CoA-dependent manner. Overexpression of CGI-58 in S. cerevisiae showed an increase in the formation of phosphatidic acid resulting in an overall increase in the total phospholipids. However, the triacylglycerol level was found to be significantly reduced. In addition, the physiological significance of cgi-58 in mice white adipose tissue was studied. We found soluble lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase activity in mouse white adipose tissue. Immunoblot analysis using anti-Ict1p antibodies followed by mass spectrometry of the immunocross-reactive protein in lipid droplets revealed its identity as cgi-58.

Adiposomes are specialized subcellular structures in adipocytes and are ubiquitously present in most of the cell types of vertebrates. LDs are implicated in several pathological conditions including obesity, inflammation, ichthyosis, myopathy, atherosclerosis, and neurological abnormalities (2Brasaemle D.L. J. Lipid Res. 2007; 48: 2547-2559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). It is known that various proteins associated with LDs regulate their dynamics.

In this study, we show that cgi-58 is a homologue of Ict1p and has an acyl-CoA-dependent LPA-specific acyltransferase activity. In addition, we also demonstrate that cgi-58 is a primary source for the soluble LPA acyltransferase activity observed in white adipose tissue of mice. Materials—Human CGI-58 clone was obtained from Open Biosystems. S. cerevisiae (BY4741: MATa; his 3Δ1; leu2Δ0; met15Δ0; ura3Δ0) and deletion mutant strain of ICT1 (BY4741 background) were obtained from Invitrogen. [1-14C]Oleoyl-CoA (54 mCi/mmol) and [3H]1-oleoyl LPA (47 Ci/mmol) were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Silica gel 60F254 TLC plates were from Merck. Oligonucleotide primers, chemicals, and solvents were purchased from Sigma. Polyclonal antibodies were raised against the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity-purified recombinant Ict1p as described (10Ghosh A.K. Ramakrishnan G. Rajasekharan R. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 9768-9775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). White Adipose Tissue—White adipose tissues surrounding the reproductive tract of mice were dissected, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C for further use. Frozen tissue (1 g) was thawed and homogenized in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) containing 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). The components were homogenized with four to five strokes in a Potter-Elvehjem glass-Teflon homogenizer, and the homogenate was centrifuged at 300 × g for 15 min. Supernatant was subjected to centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min. The floating layer was washed twice with PBS followed by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g. The washed floating layer was used as lipid droplets. The 10,000 × g supernatant thus obtained was further centrifuged at 240,000 × g for 60 min to obtain cytosol (soluble fraction). The pellet was washed with PBS and centrifuged again at 240,000 × g for 60 min to obtain total membranes. All of the operations were carried out at 4 °C (11Gangar A. Karande A.A. Rajasekharan R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10290-10298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Size Exclusion Chromatography— The cytosol from mice white adipose tissue (4 mg of protein) was applied to a Superdex-200 FPLC column fitted to AKTA-FPLC system (GE Healthcare). The column was pre-equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 0.1 m NaCl. The fractions (1 ml each) were collected at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min and assayed for LPA acyltransferase activity. The column was calibrated with standard molecular mass markers: thyroglobulin (669 kDa), aldolase (232 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), and chymotrypsin (25 kDa). Immunoblotting—Proteins were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Rabbit anti-Ict1p antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:1000 in 0.05% gelatin in PBS. Purification of Recombinant cgi-58—pCMV-SPORT6 vector containing CGI-58 open reading frame was used as a template for amplification of the gene. Forward primer (5′-CCCGGATCCATGGCGGCGGAGGAGGAG-3′) and reverse primer (5′-CCCCTCGAGTCAGTCCACAGTGTCGCAGATCTCC-3′) were used. PCR (1 min of denaturation at 94 °C, 1 min of annealing at 55 °C, and 1 min of elongation at 72 °C) was performed using Pfu polymerase for 30 cycles with 10 pmol concentration of each primer. The purified PCR product and pRSET A vector (N-terminal histidine tag) were digested with BamHI and XhoI and ligated directionally. The construct was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells and induced with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 4 h at 37 °C. The cell pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 300 mm NaCl. The cells were disrupted by sonication. The 10,000 × g supernatant was allowed to bind to the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid matrix. The column was washed with lysis buffer containing 25 mm imidazole. The bound protein was eluted with 250 mm imidazole in lysis buffer. Fractions (1 ml each) were collected and analyzed on 12% SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. LPA Acyltransferase Assay—The reaction mixture contained 10 μm [1-14C]oleoyl-CoA (110,000 dpm/assay), 1–15 μg of enzyme source, and 50 μm LPA (1-oleoyl) in lysis buffer with a total volume of 100 μl. The reaction was carried out at 30 °C for 10 min, and the reaction was terminated by extracting the lipids (10Ghosh A.K. Ramakrishnan G. Rajasekharan R. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 9768-9775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In addition, acyltransferase activity was also assayed using 50 μm [1-oleoyl-9,10-3H]LPA (220,000 dpm/assay) and 20 μm acyl-CoA. The lipids were separated on a TLC plate using chloroform: methanol:acetone:acetic acid:water (50:10:20:15:5, v/v/v/v/v) as the solvent system. The lipids were also analyzed by two-dimensional TLC using chloroform:methanol:ammonia (65:25:5, v/v/v) as the first dimensional solvent system and chloroform:methanol:acetic acid:water (40:20:5:0.5, v/v/v/v) as the second dimensional solvent system (10Ghosh A.K. Ramakrishnan G. Rajasekharan R. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 9768-9775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Individual phospholipids were identified by comparing the Rf values of the unknown with the Rf values of the standards. The TLC plates were subjected to autoradiography, and the PA spots were scraped and counted with toluene-based scintillation mixture. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Mutations (Q130P and E260K) in cgi-58 were introduced using the following primers: forward primer for Q130P, 5′-AGAAGAAGTGGAGAATCCGTTTGTGGAATCCATTGA-3′ and reverse primer for Q130P, 5′-TCAATGGATTCCACAAACGGATTCTCCACTTCTTCT-3′; forward primer for E260K, 5′-TGCAGACTCCAAGTGGTAAGACAGCTTTCAAGAAT-3′; and reverse primer for E260K, 5′-ATTCTTGAAAGCTGTCTTACCACTTGGAGTCTGCA-3′. Wild type CGI-58 template (80 ng) and primers (25 pmol each) were added to PCR tubes containing 0.2 mm dNTPs, 1 mm MgSO4, 2.5 units of Pfu polymerase, and 1× reaction buffer. Amplification was done using the following conditions: denaturation of the template at 94 °C for 4 min followed by 20 cycles at 94 °C for 45 s (denaturation), 52 °C for 1 min (annealing) and 72 °C for 6 min (extension). The reaction was continued for another 20 min at 72 °C to complete the extension. The product was treated with DpnI at 37 °C for 6 h to digest the methylated template and transformed into E. coli DH5α strain, and the mutants were confirmed by sequencing. Overexpression of cgi-58 in S. cerevisiae—Full-length CGI-58 cDNA was subcloned from pRSET A to pYES2 vector at the BamHI-XhoI site and transformed into yeast cells by the lithium chloride method (12Schiestl R.H. Gietz R.D. Curr. Genet. 1989; 16: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1776) Google Scholar). Transformants were selected on synthetic minimal medium devoid of uracil (SM-U) containing 2% glucose and were grown to the late log phase. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and inoculated at an A600 level of 0.4 in SM-U medium containing 2% galactose and grown for 24 h. To confirm the expression, cells (A600 = 5) were resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2% SDS and then lysed using glass beads. The proteins were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The overexpression of cgi-58 was confirmed using anti-Ict1p antibodies at a dilution of 1:1000 (v/v). Preparation of Yeast Cell Lysate—To measure the enzymatic activity of S. cerevisiae overexpressing cgi-58 and vector control, the cell extracts were prepared by lysing with glass beads followed by centrifugation at 1000 × g to remove glass beads and unbroken cells. Cell-free extract was used as the enzyme source. [32P]Orthophosphate Incorporation into Phospholipids— pYES2-CGI-58 and pYES2 transformants were grown to late log phase in 5 ml of SM-U containing 2% glucose and then transferred to 50 ml of the same medium, such that the absorbance is 0.1. The cells were grown till the absorbance reached 3. For labeling of total cellular phospholipids, A600 = 0.4 of the cells were inoculated in a fresh medium containing 2% galactose and 200 μCi of [32P]orthophosphate and grown for 24 h. The cells (A600 = 25) were harvested by centrifugation, and the lipids were extracted and analyzed by two-dimensional TLC. The solvents for the first dimension were chloroform:methano-l:ammonia (65:25:5, v/v/v); solvents for the second dimension were chloroform:methanol:acetone:acetic acid:water (50:10:20: 15:5, v/v/v/v/v) (10Ghosh A.K. Ramakrishnan G. Rajasekharan R. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 9768-9775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). [14C]Acetate Incorporation into Neutral Lipids—The transformants (pYES2-CGI-58 and pYES2) were grown to late log phase in 5 ml of SM-U containing 2% glucose and then transferred to 10 ml of the fresh medium with an absorbance of 0.1. The cells were grown till the absorbance reached 3. For neutral lipid labeling, A600 = 0.4 of the cells were inoculated in a fresh medium containing 2% galactose and 4 μCi/ml of [14C]acetate and grown for 24 h. The cells (A600 = 10) were harvested, and the lipids were extracted and separated on a silica TLC using chloroform:methanol:acetic acid (98:2:0.5, v/v/v) as the solvent system. Identification of cgi-58 by Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption Ionization (MALDI) Mass Spectrometry—Protein from LDs were separated on 12% SDS-PAGE and stained by Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The band of interest was excised, rehydrated with water, washed thrice for 15 min each with 50% acetonitrile in 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8.0), and dried. The sample was digested with 0.80 ng/ml proteomics grade trypsin (Promega) in 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8.0) for 12 h at 37 °C. The tryptic fragments were then extracted with 50% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, dried, resuspended in saturated 4-hydroxy-cyanocinnamic acid in 50% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and applied to a MALDI sample plate that was dried and washed with water to remove excess buffer salts. MALDI mass spectrometry analysis was performed on the ULTRA FLEX TOF-TOF, Bruker Daltonics instrument equipped with a pulsed N2 laser and analyzed in the reflectron mode using a time delay of 90 ns, accelerating voltage of 25 kV in the positive ion mode. Initially spectra of 200 laser shots were acquired, and the spectra were calibrated externally to a spectrum of peptide mixture of known masses ranging from 1046 to 2465 Da. The intense peaks in the spectrum were selected for fragmentation by laser-induced dissociation using the LIFT program of ULTRA FLEX TOF-TOF instrument. cgi-58 was identified by subjecting the peptide masses obtained to Mascot version 2.1 (Matrix Science) search engine. CGI-58 Is Homologous to ICT1—BLAST analysis of Ict1p in the nonredundant data base of NCBI revealed that Ict1p is a close homologue of cgi-58. Clustal W analysis of Ict1p with human cgi-58 and its homologues in Mus musculus and Xenopus suggests a wide phyletic distribution of cgi-58, thereby indicating an evolutionary conserved function (Fig. 1). However, most of the human orthologues have not been characterized. A close homologue of cgi-58 is abhd4, which has been found to be important in endocannabinoid biosynthesis (13Simon G.M. Cravatt B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 26465-26472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). cgi-58, a 350-amino acid protein, is a member of α/β-hydrolase family of proteins. In addition to the hydrolase domain, cgi-58 possesses an esterase (pfam 00756), hydrolase/acyltransferase domain (COG 0596), and lysophospholipase domain (COG 2267). The GXSXG motif of cgi-58 is highly conserved in majority of the known lipases, phospholipases, lysophospholipases, esterases, and serine proteases; however, the conserved Ser is replaced by an Asn in this case. A distinct structural motif HX4D is also present in cgi-58 at the C-terminal region. Hydropathy plot of cgi-58 predicted the absence of any transmembrane domain (data not shown). cgi-58 Encodes LPA Acyltransferase—Human CGI-58 was cloned in pRSET A and expressed in BL21 (DE3) cells. Immunoblot analysis using anti-His6 antibody was done to confirm the expression. Recombinant protein was purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column chromatography (Fig. 2A). To confirm whether anti-Ict1p antibodies cross-react with human cgi-58, immunoblot analysis was performed. Anti-Ict1p antibody did cross-react with human cgi-58 (Fig. 2B). LPA acyltransferase activity of cgi-58 was analyzed, and the enzymatic product was confirmed by two-dimensional TLC as PA (Fig. 2C). To assess acyl acceptor specificity, lysophosphatidylcholine, lysophosphatidylethanolamine, lysophosphatidylserine, and lysophosphatidylinositol were used. The recombinant cgi-58 showed no significant activity toward these substrates. These data suggest that cgi-58 is an acyl-CoA-dependent LPA-specific acyltransferase (Fig. 2D). The recombinant cgi-58 showed no lipase activity with 3H-labeled triolein and phospholipase D activity toward 14C-labeled PC and 14C-labeled PE (data not shown). Characterization of the Recombinant cgi-58—The enzyme showed a protein-dependent (Fig. 3, A and B) and time-dependent (Fig. 3C) increase in the incorporation of [14C]oleoyl-CoA into LPA to form PA. To study the effect of other phospholipids on the LPA acyltransferase activity, the assay was performed in the presence of other lysophospholipids and phospholipids. The activity was inhibited by the high concentrations of all phospholipids studied. However, the effect of lysophosphatidylcholine was most prominent. Lysophosphatidylcholine inhibited 68% of the enzyme activity at 30 μm (Fig. 3D). To assess the preference of acyl-CoA by the enzyme, the assays were performed using palmitoyl-, oleoyl-, and stearoyl-CoAs as acyl donors and [3H]LPA as an acyl acceptor. A slightly higher activity was observed with oleoyl-CoA (14.75 nmol of PA formed per min/mg of protein) as compared with palmitoyl-CoA (12.20 nmol of PA formed per min/mg of protein). When stearoyl-CoA was used as an acyl donor, only 33% of the activity was found under the standard assay conditions (Fig. 3E). Based on the above observations, we suggest that cgi-58 is a soluble LPA acyltransferase, which plays an important role in PA biosynthesis. Acylation and Coactivation Functions Are Segregated in cgi-58—Q130P and E260K mutations in cgi-58 (Fig. 4A) were shown earlier to have a debilitating effect on the activation of ATGL (4Lass A. Zimmermann R. Haemmerle G. Riederer M. Schoiswohl G. Schweiger M. Kienesberger P. Strauss J.G. Gorkiewicz G. Zechner R. Cell Metabolism. 2006; 3: 309-319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). These are also two of the several mutations found in Chanarin-Dorfman syndrome patients (9Lefevre C. Jobard F. Caux F. Bouadjar B. Karaduman A. Heilig R. Lakhdar H. Wollenberg A. Verret J.L. Weissenbach J. Ozguc M. Lathrop M. Prud'homme J.F. Fischer J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2001; 69: 1002-1012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). To assess the role of these mutations on LPA acyltransferase activity, mutants and wild type proteins were purified. Western blotting with anti-His6 antibody confirmed the purity (Fig. 4B), and acyltransferase activity was analyzed. Q130P and W260K did not have a significant effect on the acyltransferase activity (Fig. 4C), suggesting that LPA acyltransferase activity is functionally segregated from its role as a coactivator. cgi-58 Overexpression Enhances Phospholipids in S. cerevisiae— To study the effect of cgi-58 overexpression on cellular phospholipids, S. cerevisiae was transformed with pYES2-CGI-58. Immunoblotting with anti-Ict1p antibodies confirmed the overexpression of the protein (Fig. 5A). Overexpression of human cgi-58 in yeast led to an increase in the major phospholipids (Fig. 5B). Total radioactivity in the chloroform fraction of pYES2-CGI-58 cells showed a 5-fold increase in the incorporation, when compared with the pYES2 vector control yeast cells (Fig. 5C). When we analyzed the chloroform extract in a two-dimensional TLC (excluding origin), the overall increase in phospholipids alone was found to be 3.6-fold (Fig. 5D). PA showed a ∼2-fold increase as compared with the vector control (Fig. 5D). To our surprise, the amount of labeled PC and PE was found to be ∼3.3- and ∼4.7-fold higher than the vector control, respectively (Fig. 5D). It is worth noting that overexpression of cgi-58 led to an increased biosynthesis of all the major phospholipids. To test whether human cgi-58 can complement the PA biosynthetic defect in Δict1 cells (10Ghosh A.K. Ramakrishnan G. Rajasekharan R. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 9768-9775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), cells were transformed with pYES2-CGI-58, and [32P]orthophosphate incorporation into lipids, in particular to PA, was studied. CGI-58 overexpression in Δict1 cells was found to rescue the metabolic defect of the mutant (supplemental Fig. S1). Cell-free extracts of transformants (pYES2-CGI-58) were prepared and assayed for the LPA acyltransferase activity, which showed nearly a 1.8-fold increase in acylation when compared with the vector control (Fig. 5E), suggesting a possible role for cgi-58 in phosphatidic acid biosynthesis. To understand the fate of neutral lipid biosynthesis, [14C]acetate labeling study was performed in pYES2-CGI-58 transformed yeast cells. Overexpression of cgi-58 in S. cerevisiae decreased the TAG levels by 2-fold and showed a corresponding increase in the DAG level (Fig. 5, F and G). PA Formation in WAT Cytosol—PA can be synthesized by three different routes (i) phosphorylation of DAG by DAG kinase, (ii) acylation of LPA by LPA acyltransferase, and (iii) hydrolysis of phosphoalcohol head group from phospholipids by phospholipase D. To determine the contribution of each of these routes to the total PA pool, cytosol of mice WAT was used. DAG kinase was assayed in the presence of DAG, [γ-32P]ATP, MgCl2, phosphatidylserine, octyl-β-glucopyranoside, 500 μm [γ-32P]ATP, and 20 μg of cellular protein (14Bunting M. Tang W. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10230-10236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Commercially available DAG kinase (CalBiochem) was used as the positive control. There was no formation of labeled PA, suggesting that the DAG kinase is not involved in the formation of PA in the cytosol of mice WAT. Hydrolysis of 14C-labeled PC and 14C-labeled PE were monitored using cytosol as the enzyme source. There was no significant formation of labeled PA (data not shown). LPA acylation by the cytosol showed a time-dependent incorporation of [14C]oleoyl-CoA (data not shown). These results suggest that mice WAT cytosol has PA biosynthesizing activity, which is attributed to LPA acyltransferase. Distribution of PA Biosynthetic Activity—We investigated the PA formation in WAT and found that the cytosol (240,000 × g supernatant), lipid droplets and membrane fractions were capable of synthesizing PA. Table 1 summarizes the LPA acylation in these fractions. Interestingly, cytosol had 28% of the total LPA acyltransferase activity, whereas LDs and membrane fraction had 15 and 57% activity, respectively (Table 1). These results indicate that there is a PA biosynthetic pathway in the cytosol. To demonstrate that this activity is not due to the nonsedimentable membrane fragments generated during fractionation, a gel exclusion FPLC column (Superdex-200) was used. Most of the LPA acyltransferase activity eluted around 232 kDa (Fig. 6A), and this could be due to specific/nonspecific association of cgi-58 with other proteins. However, the identity of these proteins is not clear. The association of cgi-58 with other proteins was confirmed by immunoblotting with anti-ict1p antibodies (data not shown). These results indicate that the PA forming activity is also present in the cytosol of white adipose tissue.TABLE 1Distribution of LPA acyltransferase activity in white adipose tissueFractionProteinTotal activitySpecific activityTotal activitymgpmol/minpmol/min/mg%Cytosol8.03603.6175.16 ± 11.0928.35 ± 2.38Lipid droplets0.81328.30471.21 ± 1.9815.42 ± 1.41Membranes1.761196.64648.80 ± 1.1156.23 ± 3.65 Open table in a new tab Identification of cgi-58 in Mice WAT—Our studies on S. cerevisiae showed that Ict1p, a cytosolic protein, could acylate LPA to PA (10Ghosh A.K. Ramakrishnan G. Rajasekharan R. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 9768-9775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To identify Ict1p-like proteins, we resorted to immunoblotting of WAT subcellular fractions. Immunoreactive bands were observed in the LDs and cytosol when probed with anti-Ict1p antibodies (Fig. 6B). The band (Fig. 6C) corresponding to ∼45 kDa in LDs was found to be cgi-58 by MALDI mass spectrometry analysis. These findings suggest that the cytosolic LPA acyltransferase activity is contributed by cgi-58. The present study is based on our earlier report on Ict1p, a protein that is highly expressed upon organic solvent stress in S. cerevisiae. Ict1p was found to acylate specifically LPA to PA, and this function was found to be important for membrane lipid biosynthesis and repair on organic solvent stress. BLAST analysis of Ict1p revealed that cgi-58 is a close relative of Ict1p. cgi-58 is a member of the α/β-hydrolase family of proteins containing a highly conserved tertiary fold of alternating α-helices and β-sheets. It is found to be conserved from bacteria to humans. Human cgi-58 is a soluble protein with α/β-hydrolase domain-containing hydrolase/acyltransferase/esterase/lipase and phospholipase motifs (5Akiyama M. Sawamura D. Nomura Y. Sugawara M. Shimuzu H. J.

Mutations in cgi-58 are known to be associated with Chanarin-Dorfman syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive disorder, characterized by the accumulation of TAG in various tissues and ichthyosis (5Akiyama M.

The exact biochemical function of cgi-58 and its role in lipid metabolism still remains elusive. Amino acids 69–87 in cgi-58 form a highly hydrophobic region corresponding to the lipid-binding motif of the protein (5Akiyama M. Sawamura D. Nomura Y. Sugawara M. Shimuzu H. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2003; 121: 1029-1034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The presence of this domain suggests that the enzyme could utilize lysophospholipids. However, phospholipase and lysophospholipase activities in the purified recombinant cgi-58 were not observed, probably because of the absence of Ser residue in the active site (18Hilton S. Buckley J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 997-1000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, it has a distinct structural motif, HX4D, observed in some acyltransferases. Histidine in the HX4D motif abstracts a proton from the hydroxyl group of an acyl acceptor, thereby facilitating the nucleophilic attack on thioester of an acyl donor (19Heath R.J. Rock C.O. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1425-1430Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The bacterially expressed, purified recombinant human cgi-58 was examined for the possible acyltransferase activities. It was found to specifically acylate LPA in an acyl-CoA-dependent manner to form PA. It showed a preference for both palmitoyl- and oleoyl-CoAs. It is known that Gln130 and Glu260 in cgi-58 are important residues involved in the interaction with ATGL, and these interactions are important for normal physiology of the cell (4Lass A. Zimmermann R. Haemmerle G. Riederer M. Schoiswohl G. Schweiger M. Kienesberger P. Strauss J.G. Gorkiewicz G. Zechner R. Cell Metabolism. 2006; 3: 309-319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). The two point mutations (Q130P and E260K) did not have any effect on the acyltransferase activity, thereby suggesting that the ATGL coactivation and LPA acylation by cgi-58 are unrelated. Our results provide evidence for the presence of a soluble acyl-CoA:LPA acyltransferase in the eukaryotic system. Overexpression of cgi-58 in yeast enhances the PA level and thereby overall phospholipid biosynthesis. Our study on the fate of neutral lipids indicates a significant reduction in the TAG level on cgi-58 overexpression in yeast. Similar studies in COS-7, Hep-G2, or McA-RH7777 cells suggest a decrease in TAG level on cgi-58 overexpression (4Lass A. Zimmermann R. Haemmerle G. Riederer M. Schoiswohl G. Schweiger M.

Rudel L.L. Yu L. J. Lipid Res. 2007; 48: 2295-2305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The decrease in TAG could be because of the coactivation of ATGL-like lipase by cgi-58 in yeast (20Kurat C.F. Natter K. Petschnigg J. Wolinski H. Scheuringer K. Scholz H. Zimmermann R. Leber R. Zechner R. Kohlwein S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 491-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). PA is the major intermediate in membrane and storage lipid biosyntheses. It is possible that cgi-58 could be involved in providing PA for glycerolipid biosynthesis (7Igal R.A. Coleman R.A. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 31-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Ghosh A.K. Ramakrishnan G. Rajasekharan R. J. Biol.

CGI-58 overexpression studies in Hep-G2 or McA-RH7777 cells suggest a minor change in the levels of phospholipids and cholesteryl esters (8Brown J.M. Chung S. Das A. Shelness G. Rudel L.L. Yu L. J. Lipid Res. 2007; 48: 2295-2305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, studies involving fibroblasts from Chanarin-Dorfman syndrome patients indicate that although there was no apparent lipolysis defect in those cell lines, accumulations of some major phospholipids and sphingomyelins were decreased when compared with normal fibroblast cells (7Igal R.A. Coleman R.A. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 31-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was shown earlier that β-adrenergic stimulation releases cgi-58 from its interacting protein (perilipin), which thereafter traverses into the cytoplasm. However, the precise role of cgi-58 in the cytoplasm remains unknown (2Brasaemle D.L. J. Lipid Res. 2007; 48: 2547-2559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). It is possible that cgi-58 can associate with ATGL and facilitate lipolysis (4Lass A. Zimmermann R. Haemmerle G. Riederer M. Schoiswohl G. Schweiger M. Kienesberger P. Strauss J.G. Gorkiewicz G.

Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 31-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), thereby maintaining the TAG homeostasis. To understand the physiological significance of cgi-58 in vivo, we resorted to mice white adipose tissue. We provide a direct evidence for the presence of PA biosynthetic activity in cytosol of mammalian system based on the following observations. First, subcellular distribution studies indicate that more than 60% of the total activity is associated with the membranes (Table 1). Second, the enzyme involved in PA synthesis is permeable in the gel filtration column. The presence of soluble enzymes that provide important precursors for glycerolipid biosynthesis is well documented. Cytosolic monoacylglycerol acyltransferase (22Tumaney A.W. Sekhar S.

Using a two-tiered approach, they have developed a functional assay for the classification of BRCA2 sequence variants of unknown importance. The assay may serve as a model to generate functional assays for other human disease genes. Individuals with mutations in breast cancer susceptibility genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 have up to an 80% risk of developing breast cancer by the age of 70. Sequencing-based genetic tests are now available to identify mutation carriers in an effort to reduce mortality through prevention and early diagnosis. However, lack of a suitable functional assay hinders the risk assessment of more than 1,900 BRCA1 and BRCA2 variants in the Breast Cancer Information Core database that do not clearly disrupt the gene product. We have established a simple, versatile and reliable assay to test for the functional significance of mutations in BRCA2 using mouse embryonic stem cells (ES cells) and bacterial artificial chromosomes and have used it to classify 17 sequence variants. The assay is based on the ability of human BRCA2 to complement the loss of endogenous Brca2 in mouse ES cells. This technique may also serve as a paradigm for functional analysis of mutations found in other genes linked to human diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1980379135,"SLIT-2 is considered as a candidate tumor suppressor gene, because it is frequently inactivated in various cancers due to hypermethylation of its promoter region and allelic loss. However, the exact mechanism of its tumor-suppressive effect has not been elucidated. Here, we observed that Slit-2-overexpressing breast cancer cells exhibited decreased proliferation and migration capabilities compared with control cells under in vitro conditions. These results were confirmed in vivo in mouse model systems. Mice injected with MCF-7/Slit-2 cells showed a 60–70% reduction in tumor size compared with mice injected with MCF-7/VC cells both in the absence and presence of estrogen. Upon further elucidation, we observed that Slit-2 mediates the tumor-suppressive effect via a coordinated regulation of the β-catenin and PI3K signaling pathways and by enhancing β-catenin/E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion. Our study for the first time reveals that Slit-2-overexpressing breast cancer cells exhibit tumor suppressor capabilities through the novel mechanism of β-catenin modulation.

Buhr H.J. Bhargava S. Oncol. Rep. 2006; 15: 1437-1443PubMed Google Scholar). This indicates that Slit/Robo signaling may play important roles in cancer development. Mutation studies and expression analysis of the SLIT-2 gene have revealed loss of heterozygosity, a couple of missense substitutions in one of the EGF-like domains, and rearrangement at its genomic locus (4p15.2) in a significant proportion of human cancers (3Dallol A. Da Silva N.F. Viacava P. Minna J.D. Bieche I. Maher E.R. Latif F. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 5874-5880PubMed Google Scholar, 4Dallol A. Krex D. Hesson L. Eng C. Maher E.R. Latif F.

Bieche I. Krex D. Morton D. Maher E.R. Latif F. Br. J. Cancer. 2004; 91: 2071-2078Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Moreover, primary breast tumors and a majority of breast tumor cell lines have been reported to exhibit reduced or absent SLIT-2 expression (3Dallol A. Da Silva N.F. Viacava P. Minna J.D. Bieche I. Maher E.R. Latif F. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 5874-5880PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, analysis of the Slit-2 promoter region in these tumor cells showed the presence of extensive hypermethylation of the SLIT-2 5′-cytosine-guanine (CpG) island (3Dallol A. Da Silva N.F. Viacava P. Minna J.D. Bieche I. Maher E.R. Latif F. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 5874-5880PubMed Google Scholar). Lack or reduced expression of SLIT-2 was correlated with CpG hypermethylation, and further treatment with the demethylating agent 5′-azacytidine restored SLIT-2 expression (3Dallol A. Da Silva N.F. Viacava P. Minna J.D. Bieche I. Maher E.R. Latif F. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 5874-5880PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, Slit-2-overexpressing breast cancer cells or Slit-2-treated breast cancer cells showed decreased colony formation (3Dallol A. Da Silva N.F. Viacava P. Minna J.D. Bieche I. Maher E.R. Latif F. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 5874-5880PubMed Google Scholar). Although these studies indicate that SLIT-2 can act as a tumor suppressor gene, its tumor-suppressive effect under in vivo conditions and the exact mechanisms of its anti-tumor property are not yet known. One of the pathways through which Slit-2 mediates its function may be by modulating β-catenin/wnt signaling, because the Slit family of proteins were identified as conserved targets of the β-catenin/wnt signaling pathway and interaction between Slit/Robo signaling and wnt signaling was observed during ureteric bud development (30Katoh Y. Katoh M. Oncol. Rep. 2005; 14: 1351-1355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Stuart R.O. Bush K.T. Nigam S.K. Kidney Int. 2003; 64: 1997-2008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). β-Catenin is a critical regulatory molecule of the wnt signaling pathway and also plays an important role in cadherin-based cell-cell adhesion by indirectly linking cadherins to the actin cytoskeleton (32Nagafuchi A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 600-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 33Vasioukhin V. Fuchs E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 76-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). In the cytoplasm, serine and threonine phosphorylation regulated the stability of β-catenin by targeting it to GSK-3β/Axin/adenomatous polyposis coli complex-mediated proteasomal degradation or its translocation to the nucleus. In the nucleus, β-catenin interacts with members of the LEF/TCF family of transcriptional activators (34Rubinfeld B. Albert I. Porfiri E. Fiol C. Munemitsu S. Polakis P. Science. 1996; 272: 1023-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (1296) Google Scholar, 35Papkoff J. Rubinfeld B. Schryver B. Polakis P. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 2128-2134Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Several β-catenin/TCF target genes (such as matrix metalloproteases, cytoskeletal proteins, and angiogenic cytokines) have been implicated in cancer progression (36Crawford H.C. Fingleton B.M.

Breast Cancer Res. 2000; 2: 252-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Thus, β-catenin is considered to be an oncogene, and its deregulation or mutational activation can lead to cancer (42Bukholm I.K. Nesland J.M. Karesen R. Jacobsen U. Borresen-Dale A.L. J. Pathol. 1998; 185: 262-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 43Van Aken E. De Wever O. Correia da Rocha A.S. Mareel M.

Invest. 2002; 109: 987-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Furthermore, up-regulation of β-catenin has been shown in various cancer tissues, including breast cancer (42Bukholm I.K. Nesland J.M. Karesen R. Jacobsen U. Borresen-Dale A.L. J. Pathol. 1998; 185: 262-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Here, we report for the first time that the overexpression of Slit-2 in breast cancer cells inhibits breast cancer growth in two in vivo mouse model systems, both in the absence and presence of estrogen. We have also shown that Slit-2 induces its tumor suppressor activity by a coordinated regulation of the β-catenin/TCF and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways as well as by enhancing β-catenin/E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion. Cell Lines—The Slit-2-overexpressing MCF-7 (MCF-7/Slit-2) stable cell line and vector control cell line (MCF-7/VC) were provided by Dr. Farida Latif (University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK). These cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 μg/ml Zeocin, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2 (3Dallol A. Da Silva N.F. Viacava P. Minna J.D. Bieche I. Maher E.R. Latif F. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 5874-5880PubMed Google Scholar). MDA-MB-231 cells were generously provided by Hava Avraham (Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston) and maintained in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Microarray Analysis—Total RNA was collected from both MCF-7/Slit-2 and MCF-7/VC cell lines by using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), per the manufacturer's protocol. Microarray analysis was performed at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center genomics core facility by using an Affymetrix Microarray gene chip containing 40,000 human genes. Proliferation Assay—Cells (5 × 103), seeded on 96-well plates, were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 0.2% fetal bovine serum and 50 ng/ml of EGF. The number of viable cells was quantified at various time points by using the CellTiter 96®Aqueous kit (Promega, Madison, WI), as per the manufacturer's instructions. Chemotaxis Assay—A chemotaxis assay was performed in 24-well cell culture chambers with 8-μm pore inserts, as described previously (45Prasad A. Fernandis A.Z. Rao Y. Ganju R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9115-9124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Membranes were pre-coated with fibronectin (2.5 μg/ml). Breast cancer cells were suspended in chemotaxis buffer (DMEM/0.1% bovine serum albumin/12 mm HEPES) at 2.5 × 106 cells/ml. 150 μl of cell suspension was loaded onto the upper chamber. 0.6 ml of medium containing CXCL12 (5 nm) was then loaded onto the lower chamber. The plates were incubated for 6 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. After incubation, the inserts were removed carefully and cells were fixed, stained, and counted using standard procedures. Soft-agar Colony Formation Assay—Cells (2 × 104) suspended in medium containing 0.4% Ultra pure agarose (Invitrogen) were layered on top of 1 ml of medium containing 0.8% agarose in 6-well culture plates. Cells were incubated with 1 ml of DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. After 2 weeks of incubation, the colonies were stained with 0.005% Crystal Violet for 1 h, and colonies were counted by using a Nikon Diaphot 300 inverted microscope. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis were done as described elsewhere (45Prasad A. Fernandis A.Z. Rao Y. Ganju R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9115-9124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). According to the particular experiment, equal amounts of protein (1 mg) were bound with specific antibodies. Then, the immune complexes were precipitated with Protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) and were Western blotted with the relevant antibodies. Extractions of Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Fractions—Nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were collected by using NE-PER™ Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagents (Pierce), as per the manufacturer's protocol. The purity of fractionation was determined with Oct-1 antibody. Small Interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated Knockdown—siRNA-mediated knockdown of β-catenin and Robo-1 was performed using β-catenin SMART pool siRNA reagents and ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool Robo-1 siRNA reagents (Dharmacon, Inc., Boulder, CO) respectively, according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, MCF-7 cells were electroporated with 100 nm siRNA using the Amaxa Nucleofector™ device (Amaxa Biosystems, Cologne, Germany), as per the manufacturer's protocol. The respective non-targeted siRNA SMARTpool was used as a control. β-Catenin siRNA-mediated knockdown was estimated by detecting β-catenin expression 48 h after the initial transfection by using Western blot analysis. Robo-1 siRNA-mediated knockdown was estimated by detecting Robo-1 receptor expression 48 h after the initial transfection by using flow cytometry. Constructs and Transfections—ORF Clone of Homo sapiens slit homolog 2 (Drosophila) (SLIT2) was purchased from OriGene Technologies Inc. (Rockville, MD) and subcloned into pcDNA 3.1/V5-His Vector (Invitrogen). 2 μg of pcDNA 3.1/V5-His-SLIT-2 plasmid was mixed with the cellular suspensions, transferred to a 2.0-mm electroporation cuvette, and nucleofected using the Amaxa Nucleofector™ device (Amaxa Biosystems) as per manufacturer's protocol. Transfection efficiency was monitored by Western blotting procedures by using anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen). Confocal Microscopy—MCF-7/VC and MCF-7/Slit-2 cells were cultured in chamber slides. Then slides were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. The cells were washed thrice with PBS, blocked with 5% normal goat serum in PBS/Triton for 60 min, and treated with rabbit anti-β-catenin antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), and monoclonal anti-E-cadherin antibody (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) overnight at 4 °C. The slides were washed thrice with PBS and stained with Alexa Fluor 568-labeled anti-rabbit IgG antibodies, Alexa Fluor 568-labeled anti-mouse IgG antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), or fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-rabbit IgG antibody. The cells were washed thrice in PBS, and slides were mounted by using Prolong Gold Antifade with DAPI (Invitrogen). The cells were then examined under a Zeiss confocal microscope, and the images were acquired by using LSM510 software. Nuclear staining was quantitated by using Volocity Software at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Microscopy Core Facility. Luciferase Reporter Assay—To determine luciferase reporter activity, TCF luciferase constructs (0.5 μg), containing the wild-type (pTOPFLASH) or mutant (pFOPFLASH; Upstate, Charlottesville, VA) TCF binding sites, were transfected into MCF-7/VC and MCF-7/Slit-2 cells (5 × 105 per well). Transfection experiments were carried out in triplicate using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following the instructions of the manufacturer. In addition, the cells were cotransfected with an internal control (0.1 μg of pRL-TK Renilla luciferase vector, Promega, Madison, WI). The cells were incubated for 48 h after the transfection and then treated with EGF (100 ng/ml) for 24 h. The cells were washed with PBS and lysed in 1× passive lysis buffer (Dual Luciferase kit, Promega). To measure the activities of firefly and Renilla luciferase, 20-μl aliquots of the supernatant were transferred into a 96-well plate and assayed in a Wallac Victor2 counter luminometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using reagents from the Dual Luciferase kit (Promega). The firefly (TOPFLASH or FOPFLASH) luciferase activity was corrected for Renilla luciferase activity (pRL-TK) to control for transfection efficiency. TOPFLASH activity was also normalized to the FOPFLASH activity. Data are expressed as the mean of triplicate values of the normalized TOPFLASH activity. In Vivo Tumor Models—Female CB17/SCID and nude (nu/nu) mice, obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA), were housed under specific pathogenfree conditions. The in vivo experiments were performed in accordance with the guidelines of our Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Cells from each stable cell line were concentrated to 3 × 106 per 200 μl and injected subcutaneously into the flank of each mouse. One group of mice was injected subcutaneously with 2.5 μg of β-estradiol 17-valerate in 50 μl of Sesame oil twice a week. Tumor size was assessed once a week, and tumor volume was calculated. At the end of the 4th week for the SCID mice and 6th week for nude mice, the animals were scanned under a Micro CT scanner (GE eXplore Locus Micro CT), and the final tumor volume was assessed. Tumors were excised, minced homogenized in modified RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and a mixture protease inhibitors, Roche Applied Science), and clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were subjected to Western blot analysis. In this study, to analyze the tumor suppressor property of Slit-2 gene, we have used myc-tagged human SLIT-2 plasmid stably expressing MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Initially, we confirmed Slit-2 overexpression in two clones of Slit-2-overexpressing MCF-7 cells. Both cell lysates (Fig. 1A, upper panel) showed the overexpression of Slit-2-myc. Clone 2 exhibited more Slit-2-myc expression than clone 1. Because Slit-2 mediates its function by binding to specific receptor roundabout-1 (Robo-1), we also analyzed the expression of this receptor in control and Slit-2-overexpressing clones of MCF 7 and observed that MCF-7 cells and Slit-2-overexpressing MCF-7 cells express moderate level of Robo-1 receptor (Fig. 1A, middle panels). Because Slit-2 is a secretory protein we also confirmed its expression in cell supernatant concentrates of both clones (Fig. 1A, lower panel). Slit-2-overexpressing Cells Exhibit Inhibited Proliferation and Migration—Increased proliferation, migration, and adhesion are important properties of tumorigenesis and the metastasis of cancer cells (46Zlotnik A. Int. J. Cancer. 2006; 119: 2026-2029Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Dallol et al. (3Dallol A. Da Silva N.F. Viacava P. Minna J.D. Bieche I. Maher E.R. Latif F. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 5874-5880PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that Slit-2-overexpressing breast cancer cells and breast cancer cells treated with Slit-2-conditioned medium have decreased colony-forming activity. When we studied the proliferation rate of Slit-2-overexpressing MCF-7 (MCF-7/Slit-2) breast cancer clones in the presence of EGF, we found that the MCF-7/Slit-2 cells showed significantly decreased proliferation as compared with the MCF-7 vector control (MCF-7/VC) cells (Fig. 1B). These clones also exhibited decreased chemotaxis toward CXCL12 (Fig. 1C). CXCL12 has been shown to play an important role in cancer metastasis. We also observed that the number and size of the colonies formed by the Slit-2-overexpressing cells were drastically reduced compared with the vector control-expressing cells (Fig. 1, D and E). These data support the notion that Slit-2-overexpression in MCF-7 cells significantly inhibits the proliferation of these cells. Consistent with Slit-2 expression, MCF-7/Slit-2 clone 2 exhibited more decreased proliferation and migration properties than clone 1, we have used clone 2 for our further experiments. Further, to analyze the role of Robo-1 in Slit-2-overexpressing MCF-7 cells, we knocked down Robo-1 by using an siRNA technique and studied the Slit-2-induced effects in MCF-7/Slit-2 cells. As shown in Fig. 2A, ∼55–60% knockdown of Robo-1 was observed in the MCF-7/Slit-2 (c2) cells transfected with the Robo-1 siRNA, as compared with cells transfected with the control (non-targeted) siRNA. We found significant increase in proliferation (Fig. 2B) of Robo-1siRNA-transfected MCF-7/Slit-2 cells compared with control-transfected cells. These results indicate that Slit-2 may function in an autocrine manner. Slit-2 Overexpression Inhibits Tumor Growth in a Xenograft Model—To further evaluate the tumor-suppressive effects of Slit-2, we used a xenograft model for tumor growth. MCF-7/Slit-2 (Clone 2) and MCF-7/VC cells (3 × 106) were injected subcutaneously into the flanks of female CB17/SCID mice. After the second week of injection, tumor volume was measured every week for up to 5 weeks. A dramatic decrease in tumor size was observed in mice, which were injected with Slit-2-overexpressing cells compared with mice injected with vector control cells (Fig. 3A). At the end of the fifth week, animals were scanned under a Micro CT scanner to calculate the exact tumor volume. Tumor volume in mice injected with the MCF-7/Slit-2 cells was ∼175–220 mm3 compared with mice injected with the MCF-7/VC cells, which had a tumor volume of ∼650–800 mm3. Because MCF-7 cells are estrogen receptor-positive, we further examined whether Slit-2 can overcome the tumor-sustaining effects of estrogen. For this study, we injected mice with 2.5 μg of β-estradiol 17-valerate twice weekly starting from 1 week prior to cell injection. Although tumor volume in mice"
https://openalex.org/W2054635321,"Individual differences in social behaviour may have consequences for mate choice and sexual signalling, because partners should develop preferences for personalities that maximize reproductive output. Here we propose that behavioural traits involved in sexual advertisement may serve as good indicators of personality, which is fundamental for sexual selection to operate on temperament. Bird song has a prominent and well-established role in sexual selection, and it displays considerable variation among individuals with a potentially strong personality component. Therefore, we predicted that features of song would correlate with estimates of personality.In a field study of free-living male collared flycatchers, Ficedula albicollis, we characterised personality based on the exploration of an altered breeding environment, and based on the risk taken when a potential predator was approaching during a simulated territorial interaction. We found that explorative and risk-taker individuals consistently sang at lower song posts than shy individuals in the presence of a human observer. Moreover, males from lower posts established pair-bonds relatively faster than males from higher posts.Our results may demonstrate that risk taking during singing correlates with risk taking during aggression and with exploration, thus personality may be manifested in different contexts involving sexual advertisement. These findings are in accordance with the hypothesis that the male's balance between investment in reproduction and risk taking is reflected in sexual displays, and it may be important information for choosy females that seek partners with personality traits enhancing breeding success."
https://openalex.org/W2034699234,"The adult neural parenchyma contains a distinctive extracellular matrix that acts as a barrier to cell and neurite motility. Nonneural tumors that metastasize to the central nervous system almost never infiltrate it and instead displace the neural tissue as they grow. In contrast, invasive gliomas disrupt the extracellular matrix and disperse within the neural tissue. A major inhibitory component of the neural matrix is the lectican family of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans, of which brevican is the most abundant member in the adult brain. Interestingly, brevican is also highly up-regulated in gliomas and promotes glioma dispersion by unknown mechanisms. Here we show that brevican secreted by glioma cells enhances cell adhesion and motility only after proteolytic cleavage. At the molecular level, brevican promotes epidermal growth factor receptor activation, increases the expression of cell adhesion molecules, and promotes the secretion of fibronectin and accumulation of fibronectin microfibrils on the cell surface. Moreover, the N-terminal cleavage product of brevican, but not the full-length protein, associates with fibronectin in cultured cells and in surgical samples of glioma. Taken together, our results provide the first evidence of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that may underlie the motility-promoting role of brevican in primary brain tumors. In addition, these results underscore the important functional implications of brevican processing in glioma progression."
https://openalex.org/W2157628131,"This study examined the effects on cognitive behaviors of giving normal adult gerbils three compounds, normally in the circulation, which interact to increase brain phosphatides, synaptic proteins, dendritic spines, and neurotransmitter release. Animals received supplemental uridine (as its monophosphate, UMP; 0.5%) and choline (0.1%) via the diet, and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 300 mg/kg/day) by gavage, for 4 wk, and then throughout the subsequent period of behavioral training and testing. As shown previously, giving all three compounds caused highly significant (P<0.001) increases in total brain phospholipids and in each major phosphatide; giving DHA or UMP (plus choline) produced smaller increases in some of the phosphatides. DHA plus choline improved performance on the four-arm radial maze, T-maze, and Y-maze tests; coadministering UMP further enhanced these increases. (Uridine probably acts by generating both CTP, which can be limiting in phosphatide synthesis, and UTP, which activates P2Y receptors coupled to neurite outgrowth and protein synthesis. All three compounds also act by enhancing the substrate-saturation of phosphatide-synthesizing enzymes.) These findings demonstrate that a treatment that increases synaptic membrane content can enhance cognitive functions in normal animals."
https://openalex.org/W2087058916,"Background Epithelial ovarian cancer is a significant cause of mortality both in the United States and worldwide, due largely to the high proportion of cases that present at a late stage, when survival is extremely poor. Early detection of epithelial ovarian cancer, and of the serous subtype in particular, is a promising strategy for saving lives. The low prevalence of ovarian cancer makes the development of an adequately sensitive and specific test based on blood markers very challenging. We evaluated the performance of a set of candidate blood markers and combinations of these markers in detecting serous ovarian cancer. Methods and Findings We selected 14 candidate blood markers of serous ovarian cancer for which assays were available to measure their levels in serum or plasma, based on our analysis of global gene expression data and on literature searches. We evaluated the performance of these candidate markers individually and in combination by measuring them in overlapping sets of serum (or plasma) samples from women with clinically detectable ovarian cancer and women without ovarian cancer. Based on sensitivity at high specificity, we determined that 4 of the 14 candidate markers-MUC16, WFDC2, MSLN and MMP7-warrant further evaluation in precious serum specimens collected months to years prior to clinical diagnosis to assess their utility in early detection. We also reported differences in the performance of these candidate blood markers across histological types of epithelial ovarian cancer. Conclusions By systematically analyzing the performance of candidate blood markers of ovarian cancer in distinguishing women with clinically apparent ovarian cancer from women without ovarian cancer, we identified a set of serum markers with adequate performance to warrant testing for their ability to identify ovarian cancer months to years prior to clinical diagnosis. We argued for the importance of sensitivity at high specificity and of magnitude of difference in marker levels between cases and controls as performance metrics and demonstrated the importance of stratifying analyses by histological type of ovarian cancer. Also, we discussed the limitations of studies (like this one) that use samples obtained from symptomatic women to assess potential utility in detection of disease months to years prior to clinical detection."
https://openalex.org/W2047478551,"Background Protein ubiquitination and/or degradation by the ubiquitin/proteasome system (UPS) have been recognized as critical mechanisms in the regulation of numerous essential cellular functions. The importance of the UPS in viral pathogenesis has become increasingly apparent. Using murine cardiomyocytes, we have previously demonstrated that the UPS plays a key role in the replication of coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), an important human pathogen associated with various diseases. To further elucidate the underlying mechanisms, we examined the interplay between the UPS and CVB3, focusing on the role of ubiquitination in viral lifecycle. Methodology/Principal Findings As assessed by in situ hybridization, Western blot, and plaque assay, we showed that proteasome inhibition decreased CVB3 RNA replication, protein synthesis, and viral titers in HeLa cells. There were no apparent changes in 20S proteasome activities following CVB3 infection. However, we found viral infection led to an accumulation of protein-ubiquitin conjugates, accompanied by a decreased protein expression of free ubiquitin, implicating an important role of ubiquitination in the UPS-mediated viral replication. Using small-interfering RNA, we demonstrated that gene-silencing of ubiquitin significantly reduced viral titers, possibly through downregulation of protein ubiquitination and subsequent alteration of protein function and/or degradation. Inhibition of deubiquitinating enzymes apparently enhances the inhibitory effects of proteasome inhibitors on CVB3 replication. Finally, by immunoprecipitation, we showed that coxsackieviral polymerase 3D was post-translationally modified by ubiquitination and such modification might be a prerequisite for its function in transcriptional regulation of viral genome. Conclusion Coxsackievirus infection promotes protein ubiquitination, contributing to effective viral replication, probably through ubiquitin modification of viral polymerase."

Column eluents were monitored by ESI/MS/MS using a TSQ Quantum 700 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. Freshly isolated samples of rat spleen, kidney, or brain (1 g each) were homogenized in CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1) containing half a volume of aqueous 0.15 m KCl and a mixture of the 1- and 2-positional isomers of synthetic 13C3-labeled 11,12- and 14,15-EG (30 ng each) as internal standards. After low speed centrifugation, the organic phases were collected and evaporated under argon. The dry extracts were suspended in a minimal volume of 30% ethyl ether, 49.5% hexane, 0.5% HOAc and loaded onto a SiO2 column (0.5 × 5 cm), and the column was washed with the same solvent to remove free fatty acids and nonesterified eicosanoids. The sample EGs were then eluted using a mixture of 92.5% hexane, 7% EtOH, 0.5% HOAc and, after solvent evaporation, purified by reversed phase HPLC on a Dynamax C18 column (150 × 4.6 mm; 5 μm), using a liner solvent gradient from 49.9% H2O, 50% CHCN3, 0.1% HOAc to 99.9% CHCN3, 0.1% HOAc in 40 min at 1 ml/min.

The hCB1 expression plasmids, hCB2 expression plasmids, or empty vector alone were transfected into CHO cells, respectively, using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen), as we described previously (6Chen J.K.

The cells were deprived of serum overnight before being used for signaling studies or isolation of plasma membranes for radioligand binding assays.Radioligand Binding Assay—Sprague-Dawley rat cerebellum, spleen, or CHO cells transfected with human CB1 or CB2 receptor were Dounce-homogenized in a freshly prepared, ice-cold buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and the membranes were pelleted from the post-nuclear supernatant at 90,000 × g for 20 min, washed, and then resuspended in a freshly prepared, ice-cold binding buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 3 mm CaCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate. Binding of [3H]CP55940 (specific activity 168 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) to plasma membranes (50 μg of membrane protein/150-μl reaction) was performed essentially as described previously (25Munro S. Thomas K.L. Abu-Shaar M. Nature. 1993; 365: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (4074) Google Scholar). Different concentrations of unlabeled CP55940, 2-EGs, EETs, arachidonic acid, 2-AG, AM251, or AM630 were used to conduct competition binding in the presence of 0.5 nm [3H]CP55940. Specific binding was determined by subtracting the nonspecific binding component measured in the presence of excess unlabeled CP55940 (1 μm). Competition binding data were analyzed using Prism 4.01 software (GraphPad) by entering Kd values of 2.3 and 0.608 nm as determined for [3H]CP55940 in cell membranes expressing either CB1 or CB2 receptors, respectively (26Pertwee R.G. Pharmacol. Ther. 1997; 74: 129-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar).Immunoblotting—CHO cells transfected with human CB1 or CB2 receptor were treated with the indicated agents, and cell lysates were prepared and subjected to immunoblotting analysis with the indicated antibodies as described previously (6Chen J.K.

Each animal was used only once in the sequential experiments. 2-EG, 2-AG, or vehicle alone was administered by tail-vein injection. Core temperature was determined by a thermistor probe (inserted 25 mm) and a telethermometer (Yellow Springs Instrument Co.); the difference in temperature before and 30 min after injection was calculated for each animal. The open field mobility experiments were performed at the Vanderbilt Murine Neurobehavioral Core Laboratory of the Center for Molecular Neuroscience, essentially as described previously (27Schramm N.L. McDonald M.P. Limbird L.E. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 4875-4882Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mice were placed individually in the center of each open field activity chamber equipped with three vectors of infrared photo beam emitters and detectors spaced 1.5 cm apart (Med Associates). Spontaneous locomotor activity was recorded as the total distance traveled in cm for each 5-min block of the continuous 30-min session.Vasodilatory Response of the Renal Glomerular Afferent Arteriole to 2-EG—Experiments were conducted using the in vitro perfused juxtamedullary nephron preparation as described (28Imig J.D. Navar L.G. Roman R.J. Reddy K.K. Falck J.R. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1996; 7: 2364-2370PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the isolated rat kidney was perfused with a reconstituted red blood cell-containing solution, and renal artery perfusion pressure was set to 100 mm Hg. Effects of 2-11,12-EG or 2-14,15-EG on glomerular afferent arterioles preconstricted with 500 nm norepinephrine were determined with or without pretreatment by the CB receptor antagonists, AM251 or AM630 (each at 1 μm for 20 min), respectively. Data are presented as percentage relaxation, with 100% relaxation equal to the control diameter before the addition of norepinephrine (28Imig J.D. Navar L.G. Roman R.J. Reddy K.K. Falck J.R. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1996; 7: 2364-2370PubMed Google Scholar).Bradykinin-increased 2-EG Production in Renal Microvessels—Renal microvessels were isolated as we described previously (29Imig J.D. Falck J.R. Wei S. Capdevila J.H. J. Vasc. Res. 2001; 38: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and incubated at 37 °C in a vial containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium solution gassed with 95% O2 and 5% CO2 for 30 min to determine 2-EG levels. In a subset of renal microvessel incubations, 1 μm bradykinin was included. Incubations were terminated by placing the samples on ice and adding 5 mg of triphenylphosphine. Samples were then snap frozen in liquid N2, and lipids were extracted and analyzed for 2-EG levels using LC/MS/MS.Cell Migration Assay—HL-60 cells were treated with 100 nm 1,25-(OH)2 vitamin D3 for 5 days to induce differentiation into macrophage-like cells. 1 × 106 differentiated cells suspended in 0.1 ml of RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin were plated into each Transwell™ insert (pore size, 5 μm) with 0.6 ml of the same cell-free medium in the lower compartment of 24-well culture plates (Corning Costar), followed by the addition of increasing concentrations of 2-11,12-EG, 2-14,15-EG, 11,12-EET, 14,15-EET, 2-AG, or vehicle (0.1% ethanol) alone to the lower compartment. After a 4-h treatment at 37 °C in the cell culture incubator (95% air and 5% CO2), cells that migrated from the upper compartment to the lower compartment were counted using a hemocytometer. For the experiments with inhibitors, the cells were pretreated with or without either AM251 or AM630 at 1 μm for 15 min or pertussis toxin (100 ng/ml) for 18 h before exposure to 1 μm 2-11,12-EG or 11,12-EET.Statistical Analysis—Data are presented as means ± S.E. for at least four separate experiments (each in triplicate). An unpaired Student's t test was used for statistical analysis, and analysis of variance and Bonferroni t tests were used for multiple group comparisons. A value of p < 0.05 in comparison was considered statistically significant.RESULTSCharacterization of the Mass Spectral Properties of Synthetic 2-EG—Our initial experiments characterized the mass spectral properties of synthetic 2-14,15-EG and 2-11,12-EG using Ag+ cationization and positive ion ESI/LC/MS/MS analysis. Since 2-acyl-glycerols isomerize spontaneously to mixtures of the corresponding 1- and 2-acyl-derivatives, the synthetic standards contain variable mixtures of the 1- and 2-positional isomers. As shown in Fig. 1 (A and B), collision-induced dissociation of the 107Ag adduct of synthetic 11,12- and 14,15-EG produced molecular ions at m/z 501.3 ([M + 107Ag]+) and yielded common ion fragments at m/z 427.2 (base peak, loss of glycerol) and 273. Regioisomer-specific EG fragments originating from transannular cleavage of the oxido functions are found at m/z 302.9 and 342.9, which are diagnostic for 11,12-EG (Fig. 1A) and 14,15-EG (Fig. 1B), respectively. A similar analysis using [13C3]glycerol-labeled 11,12- and 14,15-EG yielded the corresponding molecular ions at m/z 504.3 ([M + 107Ag] + 3) and the same common and diagnostic ion fragments observed with both the unlabeled standards (Fig. 1, A and B) and fragments generated after the loss of [13C3]glycerol from the m/z 504.3 molecular ion.Identification of Endogenous 2-EG in Fresh Tissues by ESI/LC/MS/MS Analysis—We then utilized collision-induced fragmentation of the m/z 501.3 ion ([M + 107Ag]+) and selective reaction monitoring (SRM) at m/z 342.5–343.5 (for 14,15-EG), 302.5–303.5 (for 11,12-EG), and 426.5–427.5 (common for both EG isoforms) to analyze an equimolar mixture of 11,12-EG and 14,15-EG (2 ng each). As shown by the HPLC elution profiles of the total ion current (TIC) and of the common ion at m/z 427.2, the mixture of synthetic 11,12- and 14,15-EG was partially resolved into three fractions eluting from the column between 8.6 and 9.8 min and containing the 1- and 2-glycerol positional isomers of 14,15-EG, followed by those derived from 11,12-EG (Fig. 2A). By monitoring the elution profiles of the respective diagnostic ion fragments, 11,12-EG was able to be selectively detected in the presence of 14,15-EG, and vice versa (Fig. 2A). These results confirmed the validity of the diagnostic ESI/LC/MS/MS SRM method for the analysis of mixtures of these EGs in biological samples. SRM monitoring of EG diagnostic ions derived from the collision-induced fragmentation of the 13C3-labeled (internal standard; m/z 504.3) and unlabeled (biological; m/z 501.3) 11,12- and 14,15-EG and comparisons of HPLC retention times and diagnostic ion intensities at m/z 342.5–343.5 and 302.5–303.5 provided evidence for the presence of mixtures of the glycerol 1- and 2-positional isomers of these EGs in samples extracted from rat spleen (Fig. 2B) and kidney (Fig. 2C). By comparison of diagnostic ion intensities for the labeled and nonlabeled 2-EGs, we detected 750 and 1500 pg of 2-EGs (320 and 700 pg of 11,12-EG and 430 and 800 pg of 14,15-EG)/g of rat kidney and spleen tissues, respectively (Fig. 2D). In contrast, only 11,12-EG was detected in rat brain (210 pg/g of tissue) (Fig. 2D). The presence of endogenous 2-EG in rat kidney, spleen, and brain was confirmed in additional experiments in which the EG pools were extracted and purified by reversed HPLC and then submitted to hydrolysis in methanolic KOH (30Capdevila J.H. Dishman E. Karara A. Falck J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 206: 441-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The resulting products were then converted to the corresponding pentafluorobenzyl esters by reaction with pentafluorobenzyl bromide and characterized as EETs using NICI/GC/MS (data not shown) (30Capdevila J.H. Dishman E. Karara A. Falck J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 206: 441-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar).FIGURE 2Identification of endogenous 2-EG in fresh spleen and kidney tissues by ESI/LC/MS/MS analysis. A, HPLC elution profile of product ions derived from the collision induced fragmentation of mixtures of synthetic 11,12- and 14,15-EG. Shown are the ion products derived from the fragmentation of the EG molecular ions at m/z 501.3 ([M + 107Ag]+) and detected by SRM at m/z 426.5–427.5 (for 11,12- and 14,15-EG), 302.5–303.5 (for 11,12-EG), and 342.5–343.5 (for 14,15-EG).

The HPLC elution profiles of the TIC and of the common ion at m/z 427.2 are also shown (B1, C1 and B6, C6), respectively; shown are representative data from four separate experiments with similar results. D, levels of endogenous 11,12- and 14,15-EG present in rat kidney, spleen, and brain quantified from the ratios of intensities of the diagnostic ion fragments originated for the internal standard and the biological EG isomers (n = 3–6).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To compare the endogenous levels of 2-EGs with that of 2-AG, we measured the levels of 2-AG in the same tissues using the same methodology side by side. By comparison with the internal 2-AG standard, we detected 7.41, 11.42, and 5.21 ng of 2-AG in each gram of fresh kidney, spleen, and brain tissues, respectively (the values are mean of n = 3 animals).2-EG but Not EET Bound both CB1 and CB2 Cannabinoid Receptors with High Affinity—After confirmation of the existence of endogenous 2-EG in multiple tissues, we attempted to identify potential receptors for these cP450-dependent arachidonic acid metabolites. Radioligand binding experiments revealed that both 2-11,12-EG and 2-14,15-EG dose-dependently competed with [3H]CP55940 for binding to cerebellar plasma membranes (Fig. 3A), which express high levels of CB1 receptors (31Matsuda L.A. Lolait S.J. Brownstein M.J. Young A.C. Bonner T.I. Nature. 1990; 346: 561-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (4160) Google Scholar), with a Ki value of 23 ± 3 and 40 ± 5 nm, respectively. [3H]CP55940 is a well characterized synthetic ligand specific for both CB1 and CB2 cannabinoid receptor subtypes with equally high affinity (26Pertwee R.G. Pharmacol. Ther. 1997; 74: 129-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar, 32Thomas B.F. Gilliam A.F. Burch D.F. Roche M.J. Seltzman H.H. J Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 285: 285-292PubMed Google Scholar). Since the spleen is the organ that expresses the highest levels of CB2 receptor (25Munro S. Thomas K.L. Abu-Shaar M. Nature. 1993; 365: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (4074) Google Scholar), we also isolated plasma membranes from rat spleen and performed competition binding assays. As shown in Fig. 3B, both 2-EG isoforms also competed with [3H]CP55940 for binding to spleen plasma membranes, with a Ki of 75 ± 6 nm for 2-11,12-EG and 138 ± 9 nm for 2-14,15-EG. As indicated in Table 1, both 2-11,12-EG and 2-14,15-EG bind CB1 and CB2 receptors with an affinity comparable with 2-AG, a well established endogenous ligand for both CB1 and CB2 receptors (33Mechoulam R.

In contrast, neither arachidonic acid nor EETs competed with [3H]CP55940 for binding to CB1 receptors (Fig. 3C) or CB2 receptors (Fig. 3D). Included as positive controls, the CB1-selective antagonist AM251 and the CB2-selective antagonist AM630, each at 1 μm, almost completely blocked 0.5 nm [3H]CP55940 binding to CB1 receptors (Fig. 3C) and CB2 receptors (Fig. 3D), respectively. Thus, these new cP450-dependent arachidonate metabolites are endogenous ligands for both CB1 and CB2 receptors.FIGURE 32-EG but not EET bound both CB1 and CB2 receptors with high affinity.

https://openalex.org/W2076962290,"Aquaporins (AQPs) have previously been associated with increased expression in solid tumors. However, its expression in hematologic malignancies including CML has not been described yet. Here, we report the expression of AQP5 in CML cells by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. While normal bone marrow biopsy samples (n = 5) showed no expression of AQP5, 32% of CML patient samples (n = 41) demonstrated AQP5 expression. In addition, AQP5 expression level increased with the emergence of imatinib mesylate resistance in paired samples (p = 0.047). We have found that the overexpression of AQP5 in K562 cells resulted in increased cell proliferation. In addition, small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting AQP5 reduced the cell proliferation rate in both K562 and LAMA84 CML cells. Moreover, by immunoblotting and flow cytometry, we show that phosphorylation of BCR-ABL1 is increased in AQP5-overexpressing CML cells and decreased in AQP5 siRNA-treated CML cells. Interestingly, caspase9 activity increased in AQP5 siRNA-treated cells. Finally, FISH showed no evidence of AQP5 gene amplification in CML from bone marrow. In summary, we report for the first time that AQP5 is overexpressed in CML cells and plays a role in promoting cell proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis. Furthermore, our findings may provide the basis for a novel CML therapy targeting AQP5."
https://openalex.org/W2123293350,"The endothelium lining blood vessels serves as a barrier against vascular hyperpermeability, and its maintenance is critical to organ health. Inflammatory mediators evoke tissue edema by disrupting the expression of membrane junctional proteins, which mediate binding between endothelial cell membranes. Endothelial cell-cell junctions form a diffusion barrier between the intravascular and interstitial space. To prevent the morbidity and mortality caused by exaggerated vascular permeability associated with pathological states (e.g., inflammatory and hypersensitivity disorders, pulmonary edema, traumatic lung injury, cerebral edema resulting from stroke, and others), it is important to develop therapeutic approaches to stabilize these interendothelial junctions. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a potent proangiogenic cytokine, was first described as vascular permeability factor (VPF). Doxycycline, a tetracycline derivative, has been shown to inhibit angiogenesis in both humans and animal models. We now report that oral doxycycline prevents VPF/VEGF-induced vascular permeability, interleukin-2-induced pulmonary edema, and delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) in mice. Remarkably, doxycycline also inhibits tumor growth and tumor-associated vascular hyperpermeability. Finally, we show that doxycycline targets the adherens junction in vascular endothelial cells by inducing the total amount of VE-cadherin expression while decreasing the degree of its phosphorylation. The potential of doxycyline as a therapeutic inhibitor of vascular hyperpermeability in human clinical conditions is promising and warrants further studies."

Most plant RKs are serine/threonine kinases and can be classified into several groups based on their extracellular domain. The leucine-rich repeat (LRR)-RKs comprise the largest family (1Shiu S.H. Bleecker A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10763-10768Crossref PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar). One of the most thoroughly characterized plant LRR-RKs is Arabidopsis CLAVATA1 (CLV1) (2Clark S.E. Williams R.W. Meyerowitz E.M. Cell. 1997; 89: 575-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar). This protein, with 21 LRRs in its extracellular domain, acts to control cell proliferation and cell differentiation in shoot apical meristem. Interacting partners of CLV1, such as the receptor-like protein CLV2 and the ligand peptide CLV3, have been isolated; many aspects of this signaling pathway are thus relatively well understood (3Fletcher L.C. Brand U. Running M.P. Simon R. Meyerowitz E.M. Science. 1999; 283: 1911-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar, 4Jeong S. Trotochaud A.E. Clark S.E. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 1925-1933Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar).The Leguminoseae is the third largest family of flowering plants and includes agronomically and economically important crops, such as soybeans (Glycine max (L.) Merr), peas (Pisum sativum), and beans (Phaseolus vulgaris). Most legumes can engage in symbiosis with nitrogen-fixing soil bacteria, collectively called rhizobia, leading to a sustainable input of nitrogen into the cropping system for food, feed, and fuel production through formation of root nodules. Interestingly, once early cell division for nodule development is induced, autoregulation of nodulation (AON) controls a homeostatic scheme to regulate the nodule number at a level that balances the burden on the plant with the benefits of symbiosis (5Kinkema M. Scott P.T. Gresshoff P.M. Funct. Plant Biol. 2006; 33: 707-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To investigate nodule initiation and AON, research in several legume species has led to the isolation of genes involved in nodulation, such as those encoding Nod factor receptor kinase 1 and 5 (NFR1 and NFR5), symbiosis receptor kinase (SYMRK), ion channels CASTOR and POLLUX from the model legume Lotus japonicus, nodule autoregulation receptor kinase (NARK) from soybean, and the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (DMI3) from Medicago truncatula (6Madsen E.B.

Gresshoff P.M. Funct. Plant Biol. 2006; 33: 707-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). If AON is interrupted, supernodulation or hypernodulation occurs. The NARK gene in soybean (and homologues in other legumes) plays a central role in AON. It encodes an LRR-RK composed of a signal peptide, 19 tandem LRRs, a transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic kinase domain (8Searle I.R. Men A.E. Laniya T.S. Buzas D.M. Iturbe-Ormaetxe I.

However, no biochemical evidence of the kinase activity of any AON LRR-RKs has yet been reported, although autophosphorylation and transphosphorylation ability would be predicted to play a critical role in AON. To date, autophosphorylation of some plant RKs (expressed in and purified from Escherichia coli) has been confirmed, and the phosphorylation sites of some of those RKs, such as BRI1, SERK1, XA21, and SYMRK, have been identified (15Wang X.L.

Plant J. 1997; 12: 83-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 26van der Knaap E. Song W.Y. Ruan D.L. Sauter M. Ronald P.C. Kende H. Plant Physiol. 1999; 120: 559-569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), no homologue of KAPP had been identified in legume genomes up to now. The KAPP protein is composed of three major domains: an N-terminal type 1 signal anchor, a kinase-interacting (KI) domain containing a forkhead-associated (FHA) domain, and a type 2C protein phosphatase (PP2C) domain. The N-terminal signal anchor localizes Arabidopsis KAPP to the cytoplasmic surface of the plasma membrane. The KI domain has been demonstrated to bind in vitro to catalytic domains of several RKs in a phosphorylation-dependent manner (21Stone J.M. Collinge M.A. Smith R.D. Horn M.A. Walker J.C. Science. 1994; 266: 793-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 22Braun D.M. Stone J.M. Walker J.C. Plant J. 1997; 12: 83-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 24Shah K. Russinova E. Gadella Jr., T.W. Willemse J. De Vries S.C. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1707-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The minimal KI domain of Arabidopsis KAPP was defined as a 119-amino acid (aa) segment (27Li J. Smith G.P. Walker J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7821-7826Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). It has been hypothesized that the KAPP KI domain brings the KAPP PP2C domain close to its phosphorylated RK target to attenuate RK signaling by dephosphorylation (28Li J. Lee G.I. Van Doren S.R. Walker J.C. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4143-4149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Here, we investigated the biochemical properties of NARK. Residues in the NARK protein important for its kinase activity were defined by coupling site-directed mutagenesis and in vitro phosphorylation assays. In addition, NARK regions containing phosphate modifications were determined by mass spectrometry. Furthermore, we isolated two soybean KAPP genes, KAPP1 and KAPP2, and demonstrated that KAPP1 and KAPP2 are phosphorylated by NARK and that in turn they are capable of dephosphorylating NARK in vitro.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESNARK-KD Constructs—The kinase catalytic domain (aa 663–987) of NARK (GenBank™ accession number AY166655) was amplified from leaf cDNA by PCR using the forward primer 5′-GGCGGTGACGGAATTCTAGTGTACATGATGAGGAGGAGGAA-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-GCTTAACTATGTCGACCTAGAGATTAATTAGGTTGTGAGTGTGA-3′. The product was ligated into the EcoRI/SalI sites of the glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion vector, pGEX-KG (29Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1637) Google Scholar), resulting in GST-NARK-KD, which is composed of the juxtamembrane domain, the kinase domain, and the C-terminal region. Also, the same region of the NARK kinase catalytic domain (as for the GST fusion) was amplified by PCR using the forward primer 5′-GGCGGTGACGGAATTCGTGTACATGATGAGGAGGAGGAA-3′ and the same reverse primer as described above. The PCR product was digested with EcoRI and SalI and cloned into the maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion vector, pMALc2x (New England Biolabs), resulting in MBP-NARK-KD, which is composed of the juxtamembrane domain, the kinase domain, and the C-terminal region.GST-NARK-KD and MBP-NARK-KD Mutant Constructs—Mutations were introduced in GST-NARK-KD or MBP-NARK-KD using PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis (30Adereth Y. Champion K.J. Hsu T. Dammai V. BioTechniques. 2005; 38: 864-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). PCR products containing the mutations K724E, S731A, S861A, T872A, S936A, and T963A were cloned into pGEX-KG using EcoRI/SalI sites, resulting in the GST-NARK-K724E, GST-NARK-S731A, GST-NARK-S861A, GST-NARK-T872A, GST-NARK-S936A, and GST-NARK-T963A constructs. PCR products containing the mutations K724E, E741K, V837A, and R961K were cloned into pMALc2x vector using EcoRI/SalI sites, resulting in MBP-NARK-K724E, MBP-NARK-E741K, MBP-NARK-V837A, and MBP-NARK-R961K.Isolation of KAPP1 and KAPP2 from Soybean—Partial sequences encoding KAPP1 and KAPP2 were identified from a soybean expressed sequence tag data base by the tBLASTn program (31Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69088) Google Scholar) using the Arabidopsis KAPP protein sequence (U09505) as a template. The KAPP1 and KAPP2 genes were partially amplified from soybean genomic DNA by PCR and labeled with [α-32P]dATP. Bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones 0111O22 and 0015J20, containing the KAPP1 and KAPP2 genes, respectively, were isolated from a BAC library (GM_PBa) derived from soybean line PI437654 (Clemson University Genomics Institute) by filter hybridization to 32P-labeled probes. Total RNA was isolated from soybean leaves, and whole cDNA sequences of KAPP1 and KAPP2 were determined by 5′- and 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) (Invitrogen). cDNA sequences of KAPP1 and KAPP2 were amplified by PCR and cloned into the pCR2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). Genomic sequences were determined from BAC clones listed above. Both genomic and cDNA sequences of KAPP1 and KAPP2 were deposited in GenBank™: KAPP1 genomic sequence, EU350557; KAPP1 cDNA sequence, EU350554; KAPP2 genomic sequence, EU350558; KAPP2 cDNA sequence, EU350555.KAPP1 and KAPP2 Constructs—cDNAs encoding aa 46–576 for KAPP1 and aa 46–578 for KAPP2 (corresponding to the proteins lacking the N-terminal signal anchor) were amplified by PCR using the forward primer 5′-CTCCATCAAGGGCTCTAGACGAGCTAGAGCGGCCCCTTTT-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-CTAATTCATAGTCGACCTAGGATTCAACTTTACAAGAGAATCTG-3′. The PCR products of KAPP1 and KAPP2 were digested with XbaI and SalI and cloned into the pGEX-KG vector, resulting in GST-KAPP1 and GST-KAPP2, respectively.Expression and Purification of Recombinant Fusion Proteins—Each construct for protein expression was transformed into E. coli strain Rosetta (Novagen®; EMD Biosciences). A 10-ml overnight culture was transferred to 500 ml of LB for GST constructs and to rich medium (1% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, and 0.5% NaCl) containing 0.2% glucose for MBP constructs. The cells were cultured at 37 °C to a density of about 0.8 A600. Expression of GST and MBP recombinant fusion proteins was induced with 0.1 mm and 1.0 mm isopropyl-d-thiogalactopyranoside, respectively, for 16 h at 20 °C. The cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in the lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine for GST fusion proteins and 10 mm Na2PO4 (pH 7.2), 500 mm NaCl, 0.25% Tween 20, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine for MBP fusion proteins). All GST and MBP fusion proteins were purified by affinity chromatography on either glutathione-Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare) for GST or amylose resin (New England Biolabs) for MBP as described by Horn and Walker (32Horn M.A. Walker J.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1208: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. The cleared extract was incubated for 2–4 h at 4 °C, and the beads were collected and washed by the lysis buffer on a column. The GST or MBP recombinant fusion proteins were eluted by adding either GST elution buffer (50 mm HEPES and 15 mm glutathione (pH 8.0) or MBP elution buffer (10 mm Na2PO4 (pH 7.2), 500 mm NaCl, 0.25% Tween 20, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm maltose), respectively. GST-NARK-S861A was eluted in the GST elution buffer with the addition of 150 mm NaCl. The purified recombinant fusion proteins, excluding GST-NARK-KD and the GST-NARK-KD mutants, were dialyzed against 20 mm TES (pH 7.2) and then stored in 10% glycerol at -20 °C. The GST-NARK-KD and GST-NARK-KD mutant proteins were stored directly in 10% glycerol at -20 °C.Autophosphorylation and Transphosphorylation Assays—Autophosphorylation assays were performed by incubating either 500 ng of GST-NARK-KD proteins or 1 μg of MBP-NARK-KD proteins in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MnCl2,50 μm unlabeled ATP, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in a 20-μl reaction at 25 °C for 1 h. The reaction was terminated by adding SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiling at 95 °C for 5 min, and then protein samples were separated by 10 or 12% SDS-PAGE. The gels were stained by Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250, destained, and dried using a gel dryer. The radioactivity was quantified by a PhosphorImager (STORM™; GE Healthcare), and data were analyzed using the ImageQuant program (GE Healthcare). Transphosphorylation assays were carried out under the same condition as described above with the reaction buffer containing 10 mm MgCl2 and either 1 μg of a GST fusion protein or 1 μg of nonnatural substrates (e.g. casein, histone, or myelin basic protein (MyBP)). The transphosphorylation assays between GST-NARK-KD and MBP-NARK-KD mutants were performed by incubation at 25 °C for 90 min. GST-NARK-S861A was eluted in a buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, whereas no salt was used for other proteins. To confirm whether the difference of the salt concentration in the elution buffer affected the results of phosphorylation assays, we repeated the phosphorylation assay in the presence of salt and found it had no effect (data not shown). Here and throughout, all experiments were repeated independently at least twice.Dephosphorylation Assay—Cells containing the GST-NARK-KD construct were induced, and the expressed protein was purified on glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin as described above. Before eluting the protein, the resin-bound kinase was autophosphorylated with [γ-32P]ATP for 90 min at 25 °C. Unbound label was removed by washing four times with 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). The phosphorylated GST-NARK-KD was eluted with a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES and 15 mm glutathione (pH 8.0) and stabilized with 10% glycerol. Aliquots of the phosphorylated GST-NARK-KD were incubated with 1.5 μg of GST-KAPP1, GST-KAPP2, or GST in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.0), 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, and 10 mm divalent cation at 25 °C for 4 h. For the time course assay, aliquots were taken at time intervals of 0, 120, and 240 min. The radioactivity was quantified as described above.Tertiary Structure Predictions—The tertiary structure of the NARK kinase domain (aa 666–987) was predicted using the TASSER-Lite package (available on the World Wide Web) (33Skolnick J. Kihara D. Zhang Y. Proteins. 2004; 56: 502-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 34Zhang Y. Skolnick J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7594-7599Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) consisting of TASSER, PROSPECTOR_3, SPICKER, and PULCHRA programs and as a template a Protein Data Bank file with the best score (type I transforming growth factor β serine/threonine receptor (Protein Data Bank code 1b6c) (35Huse M. Chen Y.G. Massague J. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1999; 96: 425-436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar) with Z-score of 19.289). The structure was visualized using the Swiss-Pdb Viewer program (36Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9467) Google Scholar).Mass Spectrometry and Phosphopeptide Purification—The identity and properties of wild-type GST and MBP-NARK-KD fusion proteins were determined prior to and after the addition of ATP using an ABI 4800 MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems) (37Djordjevic M.A. Oakes M. Li D.X. Hwang C.H. Hocart C.H. Gresshoff P.M. J. Proteome Res. 2007; 6: 3771-3779Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Individual protein bands of the fusion proteins were excised from one-dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gels stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G250, trypsin-digested, and, if necessary, subjected to C18 Zip tip clean up before analysis (38Natera S.H.A. Guerreiro N. Djordjevic M.A. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 2000; 13: 995-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 39Djordjevic M.A. Chen H.C. Natera S. Van Noorden G. Menzel C. Taylor S. Renard C. Geiger O. Weiller G.F. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 2003; 16: 508-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Phosphopeptides were enriched from trypsin-digested samples of fusion proteins with and without exposure to ATP using PhosTrap beads following the manufacturer's protocols (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Putative phosphopeptides enriched by the PhosTrap beads were identified by mass spectrometry and confirmed by neutral loss of multiples of 98 Da. Proteins were identified using Mascot software (Matrix Science, London, UK) at the Australian Proteomic Computational Facility (available on the World Wide Web), by searching against the soybean expressed sequence tag data base (Soy gene index 12.0; September 2004) and the non-redundant data base (MSDB). The mass tolerance was set at 0.3 Da with variable modifications allowed for cysteine (carbamidomethyl) and methionine (oxidation) and one or two trypsin miscleavages. Protein matching and phosphopeptide analysis were done from at least three independent samples.RESULTSCharacterization of NARK Kinase Activity—We expressed the kinase catalytic domain of NARK as GST and MBP fusion proteins in E. coli. We first determined the dependence on divalent cations of GST-NARK-KD for autophosphorylation activity. In this assay, either the chloride salt of Mg2+, Mn2+, or Ca2+ or a combination of two of the ions were used (Fig. 1A). The results indicate that the autophosphorylation activity of GST-NARK-KD requires MnCl2 for its maximum activity, followed by MgCl2. Autophosphorylation activity was not observed when the GST-NARK-KD protein was incubated with CaCl2 or in the absence of cations (data not shown). The addition of either MgCl2 or CaCl2 to MnCl2 neither promoted nor inhibited GST-NARK-KD autophosphorylation activity. Autophosphorylation of GST-NARK-KD was increased in a time-dependent manner in a standard condition containing 10 mm MnCl2 (Fig. 1B). The phosphorylation activity of NARK was also tested using nonnatural substrates known to be modified by other kinases. The GST-NARK-KD protein was incubated with either casein, histone, or MyBP in a kinase buffer containing both 10 mm MgCl2 and 10 mm MnCl2. The results showed that both casein and MyBP were strongly phosphorylated by the GST-NARK-KD, whereas histone was a poor substrate (Fig. 1C).The six domains of the predicted NARK protein are shown in Fig. 2A. Although all AON LRR-RKs, including NARK, SUNN, and HAR1, are predicted to have the same structural characteristics, no tertiary structures of AON RKs have as yet been reported. To help understand the structure-function relationship of such AON kinases, a model of the NARK kinase catalytic domain was built by the TASSER-Lite program suite (33Skolnick J. Kihara D. Zhang Y. Proteins. 2004; 56: 502-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 34Zhang Y. Skolnick J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7594-7599Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), which performs a threading template assembly/refinement approach. PROSPECTOR_3 in the suite identified a set of 20 homologous templates for the NARK catalytic domain model with high Z-scores. The highest scoring template was the cytoplasmic domain of the type I transforming growth factor β serine/threonine receptor (Protein Data Bank code 1b6c) (35Huse M. Chen Y.G. Massague J. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1999; 96: 425-436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). The best of five cluster models generated by the TASSER-Lite program was selected, and the positions of the mutations from nark, har1, sym29, and sunn mutants (Table 1) were mapped onto this tertiary structure (Fig. 2B). Most of the mutations in the kinase catalytic domain of AON RKs are likely to affect the kinase activities. To demonstrate this experimentally, E740K, V837A, and R950K mutants based on existing super- or hypernodulation mutants, har1-5, nts1116, and sunn1 (14Schnabel E. Journet E.P. de Carvalho-Niebel F. Duc G. Frugoli J. Plant Mol. Biol. 2005; 58: 809-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 40Carroll B.J. McNeil D.L. Gresshoff P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Plant Physiol. 2003; 131: 998-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), were selected, and the corresponding residues were mutated in the MBP-NARK-KD, resulting in MBP-NARK-E741K, -V837A, and -R961K mutants. Another mutant (K724E) was created by changing a conserved lysine in subdomain II to a glutamic acid (Fig. 2C). All of the protein mutants had greatly reduced autophosphorylation activity. The relative autophosphorylation activity of the MBP-NARK-K724E, -E741K, -V837A, and -R961K mutant proteins was 1.2, 7.2, 2.5, and 1.5% of the wild-type MBP-NARK-KD protein activity (based on a relative ImageQuant volume obtained after PhosphorImager scanning of the gel containing the radiolabeled proteins). Moreover, the mutant proteins migrated differently from the wild-type protein on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2C); the differences of protein migration were most likely to be caused by the differential phosphorylation status.FIGURE 2Mutations affect the phosphorylation activity of NARK.

https://openalex.org/W2135562131,"Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) exerts either a protective or a deleterious role in the immune response to different pathogens. We analyzed herein the role of MIF in the host control of toxoplasmosis using MIF(-/-) mice backcrossed to either the BALB/c or the C57BL/6 genetic backgrounds. Both, wild-type (WT) BALB/c and MIF(-/-) BALB/c mice were susceptible to infection with highly virulent RH as well as moderately virulent ME49 strains of T. gondii. MIF(-/-) mice, however, showed greater liver damage and more brain cysts, produced less proinflammatory cytokines, and succumbed significantly faster than WT mice. Bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) from MIF(-/-) mice produced less interleukin-1beta, interleukin-12, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha than WT BMDCs after stimulation with soluble Toxoplasma antigen (STAg). Similar observations were made in CD11c(+) low-density cells isolated from the spleens of MIF(-/-) mice challenged with STAg. MIF(-/-) C57BL/6 mice succumbed to ME49 infection faster than their WT counterparts. C57BL/6 mice that succumbed to infection with the ME49 strain produced less MIF than resistant BALB/c mice similarly infected. Interestingly, an analysis of brains from patients with cerebral toxoplasmosis showed low levels of MIF expression. Together, these findings demonstrate that MIF plays a critical role in mediating host resistance against T. gondii."
https://openalex.org/W2151609026,"Background Hypertrophic (HCM) and dilated (DCM) cardiomyopathies result from sarcomeric protein mutations, including cardiac troponin T (cTnT, TNNT2). We determined whether TNNT2 mutations cause cardiomyopathies by altering cTnT function or quantity; whether the severity of DCM is related to the ratio of mutant to wildtype cTnT; whether Ca2+ desensitization occurs in DCM; and whether absence of cTnT impairs early embryonic cardiogenesis. Methods and Findings We ablated Tnnt2 to produce heterozygous Tnnt2+/− mice, and crossbreeding produced homozygous null Tnnt2−/− embryos. We also generated transgenic mice overexpressing wildtype (TGWT) or DCM mutant (TGK210Δ) Tnnt2. Crossbreeding produced mice lacking one allele of Tnnt2, but carrying wildtype (Tnnt2+/−/TGWT) or mutant (Tnnt2+/−/TGK210Δ) transgenes. Tnnt2+/− mice relative to wildtype had significantly reduced transcript (0.82±0.06[SD] vs. 1.00±0.12 arbitrary units; p = 0.025), but not protein (1.01±0.20 vs. 1.00±0.13 arbitrary units; p = 0.44). Tnnt2+/− mice had normal hearts (histology, mass, left ventricular end diastolic diameter [LVEDD], fractional shortening [FS]). Moreover, whereas Tnnt2+/−/TGK210Δ mice had severe DCM, TGK210Δ mice had only mild DCM (FS 18±4 vs. 29±7%; p<0.01). The difference in severity of DCM may be attributable to a greater ratio of mutant to wildtype Tnnt2 transcript in Tnnt2+/−/TGK210Δ relative to TGK210Δ mice (2.42±0.08, p = 0.03). Tnnt2+/−/TGK210Δ muscle showed Ca2+ desensitization (pCa50 = 5.34±0.08 vs. 5.58±0.03 at sarcomere length 1.9 µm, p<0.01), but no difference in maximum force generation. Day 9.5 Tnnt2−/− embryos had normally looped hearts, but thin ventricular walls, large pericardial effusions, noncontractile hearts, and severely disorganized sarcomeres. Conclusions Absence of one Tnnt2 allele leads to a mild deficit in transcript but not protein, leading to a normal cardiac phenotype. DCM results from abnormal function of a mutant protein, which is associated with myocyte Ca2+ desensitization. The severity of DCM depends on the ratio of mutant to wildtype Tnnt2 transcript. cTnT is essential for sarcomere formation, but normal embryonic heart looping occurs without contractile activity."
https://openalex.org/W2061671159,"The large subunit rRNA in eukaryotes contains an unusually dense cluster of 8–10 pseudouridine (Ψ) modifications located in a three-helix structure (H37–H39) implicated in several functions. This region is dominated by a long flexible helix (H38) known as the “A-site finger” (ASF). The ASF protrudes from the large subunit just above the A-site of tRNA binding, interacts with 5 S rRNA and tRNA, and through the terminal loop, forms a bridge (B1a) with the small subunit. In yeast, the three-helix domain contains 10 Ψs and 6 are concentrated in the ASF helix (3 of the ASF Ψs are conserved among eukaryotes). Here, we show by genetic depletion analysis that the Ψs in the ASF helix and adjoining helices are not crucial for cell viability; however, their presence notably enhances ribosome fitness. Depleting different combinations of Ψs suggest that the modification pattern is important and revealed that loss of multiple Ψs negatively influences ribosome performance. The effects observed include slower cell growth (reduced rates up to 23% at 30 °C and 40–50% at 37 °C and 11 °C), reduced level of the large subunit (up to 17%), impaired polysome formation (appearance of half-mers), reduced translation activity (up to 20% at 30 °C and 25% at 11 °C), and increased sensitivity to ribosome-based drugs. The results indicate that the Ψs in the three-helix region improve fitness of a eukaryotic ribosome.

The results indicate that the Ψs in the three-helix region improve fitness of a eukaryotic ribosome. A common feature of ribosomal RNAs is the presence of several types of modified nucleotides that are formed at the precursor level, perhaps before transcription is completed. Three general classes of modification occur: isomerization of uridine to pseudouridine (Ψ), 3The abbreviations used are: ΨpseudouridinesnoRNPsmall nucleolar ribonucleoprotein complexsnRNAsmall nuclear RNAsnoRNAsmall nucleolar RNALSUlarge subunitASFA-site fingerSSUsmall subunit. 3The abbreviations used are: ΨpseudouridinesnoRNPsmall nucleolar ribonucleoprotein complexsnRNAsmall nuclear RNAsnoRNAsmall nucleolar RNALSUlarge subunitASFA-site fingerSSUsmall subunit. methylation of ribose groups (Nm), and methylation of different positions in base moieties (mN). The Ψ nucleotides constitute the largest single subset of modification, and these and the other modifications are heavily concentrated in regions of the ribosome known or predicted to be functionally important (1Ofengand J. FEBS Lett. 2002; 514: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 2Decatur W.A. Fournier M.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 344-351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). The conserved nature of the distribution patterns argues that the modifications have important roles in ribosome structure and function. Consistent with this view, it has been shown that blocking the formation of Ψ or Nm at the global level in yeast rRNA creates a nearly lethal growth phenotype (3Tollervey D. Lehtonen H. Jansen R.

Most such modifications in eukaryotes are formed by small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein complexes (snoRNPs), and synthesis was disrupted in these latter experiments by point mutations in the snoRNP protein that catalyzes the modification reaction (3Tollervey D. Lehtonen H. Jansen R. Kern H. Hurt E.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 443-457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 4Zebarjadian Y. King T. Fournier M.J. Clarke L. Carbon J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 7461-7472Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In general, loss of single rRNA modifications from yeast or Escherichia coli has had only minor or no detectable affect on growth, indicating that most individual modifications provide beneficial effects that are not essential (1Ofengand J. FEBS Lett. 2002; 514: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 5Conrad J. Sun D. Englund N. Ofengand J. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1988; 8: 3150-3159Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The bases of these benefits are all but unknown, because only a few studies have been extended beyond examining effects on growth. In one such case, depleting different combinations of 1–6 Ψs from the peptidyl transferase center region in yeast revealed both negative, synergistic effects on growth rate for multiple depletions and a substantial reduction (20%) in translation rate with loss of a particular modification implicated in tRNA binding at the A-site (7King T.H. Liu B. McCully R.R. Fournier M.J. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 425-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Another study has shown that depleting modifications from an intersubunit bridge region in the large subunit (helix H69) impairs ribosome accumulation (8Liang X.H. Liu Q. Fournier M.J. Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 965-977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The present study is of this new generation of modification depletion analyses, in which modifications are blocked in a systematic, combinatorial fashion from a selected rRNA region and effects are examined at the levels of ribosome synthesis and function. Region-specific depletions of this type became possible and practical with the advent of high resolution crystal structures of the ribosome, and the discoveries that most Ψ and Nm modifications in eukaryotes (and archaea) are formed by snoRNPs. The snoRNP complexes contain site-specific guide snoRNAs, and genetic depletion of the snoRNA blocks formation of the corresponding snoRNP (9Kiss-Laszlo Z. Henry Y. Bachellerie J.P.

Here, we characterize the importance of a remarkable cluster of Ψ modifications in the large subunit (LSU) rRNA of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Indeed, the region of interest is the richest in Ψs in rRNA and is also known to be functionally important. The target region is located in domain II of yeast 25 S rRNA and consists of consecutive helices H37, H38, and H39 (E. coli numbering). The three helices are organized into a highly folded, compact structure in mature ribosomes and likely have interrelated functions (Fig. 1 and see below). On this basis we reasoned the three helices should be examined as one structural unit. Helices H37 and H39 are relatively short, whereas H38 is a long hinged helix. The hinge in H38 is a kink-turn, and the portion from the hinge to the distal loop (∼100 Å) is best known as the A-site finger (ASF), because it lies above the A-site of tRNA binding in the large subunit (14Stark H. Orlova E.V. Rinke-Appel J. Junke N. Mueller F. Rodnina M. Wintermeyer W. Brimacombe R. van Heel M. Cell. 1997; 88: 19-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 15Razga F. Koca J. Sponer J. Leontis N.B. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 3466-3485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The terminal 30% portion of the ASF protrudes from the central protuberance and participates in formation of an intersubunit bridge (B1a) (Fig. 1A) (16Culver G.M. Cate J.H. Yusupova G.Z. Yusupov M.M. Noller H.F. Science. 1999; 285: 2133-2136Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This bridge was proposed to be an essential path for signal transmission between functional centers in the small and large subunits (17Sergiev P.V. Kiparisov S.V. Burakovsky D.E. Lesnyak D.V. Leonov A.A. Bogdanov A.A. Dontsova O.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 353: 116-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 18Rakauskaite R. Dinman J.D. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 26: 8992-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The distal part of the ASF helix also contacts the elbow of tRNA (D loop) in the A-site (19Rinke-Appel J. Junke N. Osswald M. Brimacombe R. RNA (N. Y.). 1995; 1: 1018-1028PubMed Google Scholar, 20Osswald M. Doring T. Brimacombe R.

Science. 2001; 292: 883-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (1644) Google Scholar). Notably, this portion is often disordered in three-dimensional structure models, reflecting its dynamic nature (Fig. 1D) (22Ban N. Nissen P. Hansen J. Moore P.B. Steitz T.A. Science. 2000; 289: 905-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (2761) Google Scholar, 23Schuwirth B.S. Borovinskaya M.A. Hau C.W. Zhang W. Vila-Sanjurjo A. Holton J.M. Cate J.H. Science. 2005; 310: 827-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar). The location of the ASF above the A-site and its contact with tRNA at this site suggests that it may have a role in tRNA movement in the ribosome, in addition to subunit joining. Consistent with this activity, point mutations in the ASF of yeast altered ribosome affinity for aminoacyl-tRNA and decoding fidelity (18Rakauskaite R. Dinman J.D. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 26: 8992-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Interestingly, eubacterial ribosomes lacking the terminal portion of the ASF exhibited increases in translation activity and tRNA translocation (from the A- to P-site) in vitro (24Komoda T. Sato N.S. Phelps S.S. Namba N. Joseph S. Suzuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 32303-32309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Support for the prediction that the three-helix cluster H37–H39 might function in some connected fashion comes from crystal structures of the ribosome showing the helices are organized into a compact unit, with apparent couplings between helices. A more centrally located portion of the ASF, as well as the loop of H39, interacts with 5 S rRNA (21Yusupov M.M. Yusupova G.Z. Baucom A. Lieberman K. Earnest T.N. Cate J.H. Noller H.F. Science. 2001; 292: 883-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (1644) Google Scholar, 22Ban N. Nissen P. Hansen J. Moore P.B. Steitz T.A. Science. 2000; 289: 905-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (2761) Google Scholar, 23Schuwirth B.S. Borovinskaya M.A. Hau C.W. Zhang W. Vila-Sanjurjo A. Holton J.M. Cate J.H.

Both the ASF and H39 make contact with H81. Additionally, H81 interacts with the P-loop, which interacts directly with the CCA end of P-site bound tRNA. However, the loop of H37 makes contact with the stem of H80 (P-loop) (22Ban N. Nissen P. Hansen J. Moore P.B. Steitz T.A. Science. 2000; 289: 905-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (2761) Google Scholar, 26Nissen P. Ippolito J.A. Ban N. Moore P.B. Steitz T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4899-4903Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structures make clear that the ASF and adjoining helices have a close relationship to the peptidyl transferase center and tRNAs in the A- and P-binding sites (Fig. 1B, and see instruction for three-dimensional visualization in the supplemental materials). This information adds strong support for suggestions made earlier that the ASF may have overlapping roles in inter-subunit communication and tRNA accommodation and movement. In S. cerevisiae, helices H37–H39 contain a total of 10 Ψ modifications, making it the richest region of Ψs in yeast rRNA. High frequencies of Ψ occur in the corresponding regions of other rRNAs as well, in particular other eukaryotes (27Ofengand J. Bakin A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 246-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 28Piekna-Przybylska D. Decatur W.A. Fournier M.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: D178-D183Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Indeed, 6 of the 10 Ψs in the yeast 3-helix region are conserved in higher eukaryotes (Fig. 1C). In yeast the Ψs are distributed as follows: six occur in the middle and lower portions of the ASF helix (the distal ∼30% is free of modifications). One Ψ occurs at the base of H38 (H39 side). H37 contains two Ψs, and H39 has one Ψ (Fig. 1C). The fact that the Ψs in the ASF occur only in the lower (proximal) two-thirds of the helix suggests that these modifications are most beneficial in this portion. The Ψs in H37, H39, and the segment of H38 below the kink-turn can be expected to affect the structures of these helices too and perhaps alter their interactions. Interestingly, the nucleotides in H37 and H39 that interact with the stem of H80 (P-loop) and H81, correspond to the Ψs conserved in eukaryotes (Fig. 1C) (22Ban N. Nissen P. Hansen J. Moore P.B. Steitz T.A. Science. 2000; 289: 905-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (2761) Google Scholar). We tested the functional importance of the yeast modifications by blocking the formation of specific Ψs individually and in combinations and searched for effects on ribosome synthesis and activity. Modification reactions were blocked by genetically disrupting expression (or activity) of the snoRNAs that guide the modifications of interest. The results demonstrate that the Ψs in the ASF region are indeed important for ribosome function. The most substantial effects occurred with loss of multiple Ψs and the specific distribution patterns are important. Yeast Strains, Plasmids, and Oligonucleotides—The initial set of 13 test strains (supplemental Fig. S1) was constructed by sequential disruption of snoRNA coding sequences for snR5, snR8, snR33, snR44, and snR81, using PCR products (29Kaiser C. Michaelis C. Mitchell A. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1994Google Scholar). Construction of the improved strains (Table 1) involved two types of manipulations: 1) complementing disrupted snoRNA coding units with plasmids that express the same snoRNA, but with Ψ guide elements for the ASF region specifically inactivated, and 2) restoring a protein (Rps22B) lost on disruption of a snoRNA coding unit embedded in an intron of the same mRNA, as well as a Ψ in U2 snRNA targeted by a different snoRNA (supplemental Fig. S2). In this last situation, complementation was achieved with a plasmid-borne variant of this locus in which the snoRNA coding segment (snR44) was replaced with an artificial variant that restores two Ψs that are not part of the study. One Ψ (located in 18 S rRNA) is normally specified by snR44, the other (in U2 snRNA) is specified by a guide motif in snR81 that was moved into snR44, to replace a guide motif that targets a Ψ to the region of interest (supplemental Fig. S2D). Because genetic markers were limiting in our strategy, complementations were achieved with one or two plasmids bearing two or three expression cassettes for snoRNA genes (supplemental Figs. S2, B and D). Descriptions of the plasmid constructions and genotypes of the initial set of strains and improved strains are in the supplemental material.TABLE 1Modification patterns of Ψ-depletion strains examined The structure of the H37–H39 region is shown in two- and three-dimensional formats, with the locations of the Ψ modification highlighted. The ASF has been dissected into three portions, corresponding to base- and mid-portions that contain Ψs and a (dynamic) distal portion that lacks modifications. Modification maps are shown for a preliminary set of eight depletion strains used in these studies (A) and six additional strains used to refine and analysis (see text) (B). Open table in a new tab General Procedures—Media and culturing methods have been described (29Kaiser C. Michaelis C. Mitchell A. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1994Google Scholar), as have methods for preparing yeast total RNA (30Balakin A.G. Schneider G.S. Corbett M.S. Ni J. Fournier M.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5391-5397Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and Northern blot analysis of snoRNAs (31Chanfreau G. Rotondo G. Legrain P. Jacquier A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3726-3737Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The intensity of ethidium bromide staining of RNA was quantified with Multi Gauge software using the Kodak EDAS 290 imaging system. The presence of Ψ was detected by primer extension screening of total RNA pretreated with 1-cyclohexyl-3-(morpholinoethyl)carbodiimide metho-p-sulfonate (32Bakin A. Ofengand J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9754-9762Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Growth Studies—Growth rate measurements were carried out in triplicate in SD medium without adenine and uracil and supplemented with 60 mg/liter each of tryptophan, histidine, and leucine. Synthetic medium SD is 0.67% yeast nitrogen base (without amino acids) and 2% glucose; supplemented here with adenine, uracil, and a complete mixture of amino acids at concentrations described elsewhere (29Kaiser C. Michaelis C. Mitchell A. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1994Google Scholar). Growth Competition Assays—Competition growth studies were done with selective liquid medium, i.e. SD without adenine, uracil, and supplemented with 60 mg/liter each of tryptophan, histidine, and leucine was used. All steps were performed as reported elsewhere (7King T.H. Liu B. McCully R.R. Fournier M.J. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 425-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), with cell counting done after plating samples of the co-culture onto SD without adenine, uracil and SD without adenine, uracil, and leucine. Antibiotic Sensitivity Test—Sensitivity to anisomycin, sparsomycin, and paromomycin was analyzed by a disk diffusion assay (13Decatur W.A. Liang X.H. Piekna-Przybylska D. Fournier M.J. Methods Enzymol. 2007; 425: 283-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Here, 20 μl of the drug (1 mg/ml anisomycin, 0.5 mg/ml sparsomycin, and 250 mg/ml paromomycin) was dispensed onto a sterile 0.25-inch paper filter disk (Whatman) on solid medium that had been seeded with the strain to be analyzed (0.3 ml of cells at A600 of 0.4 per plate, well spread). The plates were incubated at 30 °C. In Vivo [35S]Methionine Incorporation—For analysis of translation rate, cells were grown in selective medium SD (without adenine, uracil, and methionine) at 30 °C to an A600 of 0.8. Amino acid incorporation assays were done essentially as reported elsewhere (13Decatur W.A. Liang X.H. Piekna-Przybylska D. Fournier M.J. Methods Enzymol. 2007; 425: 283-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). For measurement of translation rate at a lower temperature, cells were cultured at 30 °C to A600 of 0.8, and then transferred for 1 h to 11 °C. Triplicate samples were analyzed for each strain at each time point, and average values for each point are shown. The analysis was repeated three times. Sucrose Gradient Analysis—Polysome and ribosomal subunits patterns were examined as reported previously (13Decatur W.A. Liang X.H. Piekna-Przybylska D. Fournier M.J. Methods Enzymol. 2007; 425: 283-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). When analyzing polysome patterns, cell lysates were normally prepared from cells cultured at 30 °C to A600 of 0.8. For lower (and higher) temperatures, cells were grown to A600 of 0.8 at 30 °C and then shifted to 11 °C for 1 h, or to A600 of 0.7, and then shifted to 37 °C for 45 min. Lysates were prepared in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 30 mm MgCl2, 100 μg/ml cycloheximide, and 200 μg/ml heparin. Ribosome patterns were examined on linear 7–47% sucrose gradients with centrifugation at 39,000 rpm for 2.5 h in a Beckman SW41-Ti rotor (4 °C). To analyze the relative amounts of subunits, cell lysates were prepared in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol, and the subunits were fractioned on linear 7–47% sucrose gradients with centrifugation at 41,000 rpm for 3 h in a Beckman SW41Ti rotor (4 °C). The polysome, monosome, and subunit patterns were determined by monitoring absorbance at 254 nm with a UV-5 detector (ISCO). Computational Analysis of Ribosome Structure—The crystal structure of the 70 S Thermus thermophilus (PDB: 1GIY and 1GIX (21Yusupov M.M. Yusupova G.Z. Baucom A. Lieberman K. Earnest T.N. Cate J.H. Noller H.F. Science. 2001; 292: 883-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (1644) Google Scholar)) and 50 S subunit of the Haloarcula marismortui ribosome (PDB: 1FFK (22Ban N. Nissen P. Hansen J. Moore P.B. Steitz T.A. Science. 2000; 289: 905-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (2761) Google Scholar)) were visualized and analyzed with bioinformatics tools available from the Fournier laboratory through the University of Massachusetts-Amherst website (12Piekna-Przybylska D. Decatur W.A. Fournier M.J. RNA. 2007; 13: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), in conjunction with Protein Explorer (33Martz E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 107-109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The two-dimensional and three-dimensional modification maps of human 28 S rRNA can be found at a complementary website described elsewhere (28Piekna-Przybylska D. Decatur W.A. Fournier M.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: D178-D183Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Depletion of Ψs in the ASF Region: a Two-stage Strategy—The ten Ψs in helices H37, H38, and H39 are guided by eight different snoRNAs. Among these, four also guide Ψs to other regions of the ribosome, one guides a Ψ to U2 snRNA, and one is encoded in an intron of a gene for a ribosomal protein (Rps22B). This complexity requires more tedious depletion approaches with re-engineering of coding regions for several snoRNAs. Because of these complications our depletion analysis was carried out in two stages. In the first stage, we sequentially disrupted coding sequences of five snoRNAs, which together target the formation of 7 of the 10 Ψs in the H37–H39 region (supplemental Fig. S1). In a second stage of analysis we created an improved strain collection that only lacked pseudouridines in the region of interest. Construction of new strains included restoring the missing ribosomal protein and the Ψs located outside of the test region, in both cases using expression plasmids. The multiguide snoRNAs were engineered to contain only the desired guide elements (supplemental Fig. S2). Subsequent analyses focused on strains with different Ψ contents and patterns in the ASF alone or in combination with Ψ depletions from H37 and H39. Rather than attempting to examine all combinations of depletions, we sought to discover modification effects that would be informative within the confines of a practical study. Our goal was to determine if the Ψsinthe greater ASF region are, in fact, important, and if so, to obtain good insights into the importance of the content and pattern of Ψs. Fuller descriptions would be a matter for the future, when results from sensitive functional assays can be correlated with changes in ribosome structure that accompany Ψ modification. Most of the functional results that follow were derived from eight principal test strains. Where indicated, results are included for six other strains developed in the course of the study for further refinement. The depletion patterns for the eight primary strains are shown schematically in Table 1A, and those used in the refinement analyses are depicted in Table 1B. Both the Number and Pattern of Ψs Influence Cell Growth and Ribosome Level—We focused initially on H38, because the ASF segment is already known to be functionally important. The six Ψs in the lower two-thirds of the ASF portion are distributed somewhat evenly (Fig. 1, C and D). As noted above no modifications are present in the distal stem-loop portion. Three of the modifications, in the mid-portion of the ASF, are positionally conserved in several other organisms, including humans (Ψ1004, Ψ1042, and Ψ1052, Fig. 1C). Because of their implied importance, we evaluated the Ψs in this segment first. Two test strains were examined, one lacking the three conserved Ψs in the mid-portion of the ASF, and the other lacking these and two additional Ψs in the base-portion; the strains are designated (-)3Ψa and (-)5Ψa, respectively (Table 1A). In growth rate analyses in selective liquid medium at 30 °C, which is normally optimal temperature, the strain lacking the three conserved Ψs grew slower than control cells (doubling times of ∼170 min versus ∼130 min in the exponential phase) (Fig. 2A, left panel). When two of the Ψs were restored to this strain (Ψ1004 and Ψ1052, but not Ψ1042), a growth curve similar to the control cells (Ys602 with empty marker plasmids) was obtained, i.e. strain (-)1Ψ (data not shown). Interestingly, the strain lacking 5 Ψs was less impaired for growth (generation time of ∼145 min versus ∼170 min), despite that fact that the three conserved Ψs are also missing from this strain. In a competition growth experiment, the (-)3Ψa strain was out-competed by the (-)5Ψa strain in a mixed culture (Fig. 2B, left panel). Because the growth of the (-)5Ψa cells is less impaired, the results suggest the slower growth of the (-)3Ψa cells is due to a combination of loss of the conserved Ψs and the pattern of remaining Ψs. We note that strains (-)3Ψa and (-)5Ψa were created from two different parental strains, and these unexpected results could occur as an indirect consequence of constructing multiply deleted strains. To gain additional insight we also analyzed strains with other combinations of depletions. In addition to strain (-)1Ψ, which lacks only Ψ1042, we created strain (-)2Ψa lacking two Ψs (Ψ1042 and Ψ1052) in the mid-portion of the ASF, two strains (-)3Ψb and (-)3Ψc missing three Ψs in the ASF, but in different combinations than strain (-)3Ψa. Additionally, we also created two strains (-)6Ψ and (-)7Ψ lacking 6 and 7 Ψs from the three helices (described in Table 1A and see below). These new strains contain one or two plasmids expressing wild-type or mutant snoRNAs to create particular patterns of Ψ depletions. We note that (-)1Ψ and (-)2Ψa are strains in which Ψs have been restored by complementation with plasmid-encoded guide snoRNAs (see “Experimental Procedures” and supplemental material). No effect on growth rate was seen for the ASF mutant lacking two conserved Ψs, i.e. (-)2Ψa (data not shown). However, slightly slower growth rates were observed for two strains lacking three Ψs from the ASF, in combinations that differ from the strain that lacks only the conserved Ψs, i.e. the (-)3Ψa strain. These variants lack two conserved Ψs: Ψ1004 and Ψ1052 in (-)3Ψb, and Ψ1004 and Ψ1042 in (-)3Ψc, and one, Ψ986, from the base portion of the ASF. Unlike mutant (-)3Ψa these mutants have growth rate profiles similar to that of the (-)5Ψa strain (Fig. 2A, right panel). In competition growth experiments with the (-)5Ψa strain both strains comprised about half of the mixed culture after six cycles (Fig. 2B, middle and right panels). Interestingly, increasing the number of depletions in the three-helix region to a total of six and seven Ψs resulted in slower growth (doubling time of ∼160 min), but to a similar extent seen for the strain missing the three conserved Ψs, i.e. mutant (-)3Ψa. The depletions in the (-)6Ψ and (-)7Ψ cells include depletions of four and five Ψs in the ASF, and additional depletions in the flanking helices (Fig. 2A, right panel). Thus, extending the depletion series to the single Ψs in the neighboring helices H37 and H39 did not increase growth impairment significantly nor exceed the effect seen for the slowest growing (-)3Ψa strain. Taken together, the results suggest that the Ψs"

Aqp11(-/-) mice neonatally suffer from polycystic kidneys derived from the proximal tubule. Its onset is proceeded by the vacuolization of ER. However, the mechanism for the formation of vacuoles and cysts remains to be clarified. Here, we show that Aqp11(-/-) mice and polycystic kidney disease (PKD) animals share a common pathogenic mechanism of cyst formation. We performed microarray analyses and histochemical staining to characterize the effects of the disruption of Aqp11 on kidneys of 1-wk-old mice. Microarray analyses revealed that the significantly changed functional categories in Aqp11(-/-) mice were similar to those in PKD animals. Histochemical studies showed expression changes of 3 genes, Myc, Egfr, Egf, which are assumed to be involved in the proliferation of cystic cells in PKD. We actually confirmed the activation of cell proliferation in the proximal tubule cells with vacuolized ER. Furthermore, three genes associated with the remodeling of the extracellular matrix, Mmp12, Timp1, Tgfb1, were up-regulated in the fibroblasts. We also demonstrated the activation of apoptosis via the ER-stress pathway in the proximal tubule cells with vacuolized ER. These results provide new insights into the physiological roles of AQP11."
https://openalex.org/W2003858793,"Background Current guidelines encourage the use of statins to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease in diabetic patients; however the impact of these drugs on diabetic retinopathy is not well defined. Moreover, pleiotropic effects of statins on the highly specialised retinal microvascular endothelium remain largely unknown. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of clinically relevant concentrations of simvastatin on retinal endothelium in vitro and in vivo. Methods and Findings Retinal microvascular endothelial cells (RMECs) were treated with 0.01–10 µM simvastatin and a biphasic dose-related response was observed. Low concentrations enhanced microvascular repair with 0.1 µM simvastatin significantly increasing proliferation (p<0.05), and 0.01 µM simvastatin significantly promoting migration (p<0.05), sprouting (p<0.001), and tubulogenesis (p<0.001). High concentration of simvastatin (10 µM) had the opposite effect, significantly inhibiting proliferation (p<0.01), migration (p<0.01), sprouting (p<0.001), and tubulogenesis (p<0.05). Furthermore, simvastatin concentrations higher than 1 µM induced cell death. The mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy was used to investigate the possible effects of simvastatin treatment on ischaemic retinopathy. Low dose simvastatin(0.2 mg/Kg) promoted retinal microvascular repair in response to ischaemia by promoting intra-retinal re-vascularisation (p<0.01). By contrast, high dose simvastatin(20 mg/Kg) significantly prevented re-vascularisation (p<0.01) and concomitantly increased pathological neovascularisation (p<0.01). We also demonstrated that the pro-vascular repair mechanism of simvastatin involves VEGF stimulation, Akt phosphorylation, and nitric oxide production; and the anti-vascular repair mechanism is driven by marked intracellular cholesterol depletion and related disorganisation of key intracellular structures. Conclusions A beneficial effect of low-dose simvastatin on ischaemic retinopathy is linked to angiogenic repair reducing ischaemia, thereby preventing pathological neovascularisation. High-dose simvastatin may be harmful by inhibiting reparative processes and inducing premature death of retinal microvascular endothelium which increases ischaemia-induced neovascular pathology. Statin dosage should be judiciously monitored in patients who are diabetic or are at risk of developing other forms of proliferative retinopathy."
https://openalex.org/W2052461283,"TNF-related lymphotoxin alpha (LTalpha) is essential for the development of Plasmodium berghei ANKA (PbA)-induced experimental cerebral malaria (ECM). The pathway involved has been attributed to TNFR2. Here we show a second arm of LTalpha-signaling essential for ECM development through LTbeta-R, receptor of LTalpha1beta2 heterotrimer.LTbetaR deficient mice did not develop the neurological signs seen in PbA induced ECM but died at three weeks with high parasitaemia and severe anemia like LTalphabeta deficient mice. Resistance of LTalphabeta or LTbetaR deficient mice correlated with unaltered cerebral microcirculation and absence of ischemia, as documented by magnetic resonance imaging and angiography, associated with lack of microvascular obstruction, while wild-type mice developed distinct microvascular pathology. Recruitment and activation of perforin(+) CD8(+) T cells, and their ICAM-1 expression were clearly attenuated in the brain of resistant mice. An essential contribution of LIGHT, another LTbetaR ligand, could be excluded, as LIGHT deficient mice rapidly succumbed to ECM.LTbetaR expressed on radioresistant resident stromal, probably endothelial cells, rather than hematopoietic cells, are essential for the development of ECM, as assessed by hematopoietic reconstitution experiment. Therefore, the data suggest that both functional LTbetaR and TNFR2 signaling are required and non-redundant for the development of microvascular pathology resulting in fatal ECM."
https://openalex.org/W2057798607,"A 2-His-1-carboxylate triad of iron binding residues is present in many non-heme iron oxygenases including the Fe(II) and 2-oxoglutarate (2OG)-dependent dioxygenases. Three variants (D201A, D201E, and D201G) of the iron binding Asp-201 residue of an asparaginyl hydroxylase, factor inhibiting HIF (FIH), were made and analyzed. FIH-D201A and FIH-D201E did not catalyze asparaginyl hydroxylation, but in the presence of a reducing agent, they displayed enhanced 2OG turnover when compared with wild-type FIH. Turnover of 2OG by FIH-D201A was significantly stimulated by the addition of HIF-1alpha(786-826) peptide. Like FIH-D201A and D201E, the D201G variant enhanced 2OG turnover but rather unexpectedly catalyzed asparaginyl hydroxylation. Crystal structures of the FIH-D201A and D201G variants in complex with Fe(II)/Zn(II), 2OG, and HIF-1alpha(786-826/788-806) implied that only two FIH-based residues (His-199 and His-279) are required for metal binding. The results indicate that variation of 2OG-dependent dioxygenase iron-ligating residues as a means of functional assignment should be treated with caution. The results are of mechanistic interest in the light of recent biochemical and structural analyses of non-heme iron and 2OG-dependent halogenases that are similar to the FIH-D201A/G variants in that they use only two His-residues to ligate iron."
https://openalex.org/W2062402512,"Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) has long been implicated in regulating vascular development via endothelial cell-expressed G protein-coupled receptors. However, because of a lack of notable vascular defects reported in LPA receptor knockout mouse studies, the regulation of vasculature by LPA receptors in vivo is still uncertain. Using zebrafish as a model, we studied the gene expression patterns and functions of an LPA receptor, LPA(1), during embryonic development, in particular, vascular formation. Whole-mount in situ hybridization experiments revealed that zebrafish lpa(1) (zlpa(1)) was ubiquitously expressed early in development, and its expression domains were later localized to the head region and the vicinity of the dorsal aorta. The expression of zlpa(1) surrounding the dorsal aorta suggests its role in vasculature development. Knocking down of zLPA(1) by injecting morpholino (MO) oligonucleotides at 0.625-1.25 ng per embryo resulted in the absence of thoracic duct and edema in pericardial sac and trunk in a dose-dependent manner. These zlpa(1)-MO-resulted defects could be specifically rescued by ectopic expression of zlpa(1). In addition, overexpression of vegf-c, a well-known lymphangiogenic factor, also partially ameliorated the inhibition of thoracic duct development. Taken together, these results demonstrate that LPA(1) is necessary for lymphatic vessel formation during embryonic development in zebrafish."

The pleiotropic activity of Gro/TLE depends on context-specific interactions with a variety of DNA-binding proteins. Most of those factors engage Gro/TLE through two different types of short peptide motifs, the WRP(W/Y) tetrapeptide and the Engrailed homology 1 (Eh1) sequence (FXIXXIL).

The regulation of neuronal differentiation was one of the first functions of Gro/TLE proteins to be characterized. During Drosophila neural development, Gro participates in the Notch-mediated lateral inhibition mechanism that restricts the number of committed neuroblasts within proneural clusters containing initially equipotential presumptive neural progenitor cells (7Heitzler P. Bourouis M. Ruel L. Carteret C. Simpson P. Development. 1996; 122: 161-171PubMed Google Scholar, 8Bray S.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 678-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1970) Google Scholar). Neuroblasts undergoing commitment activate the Notch receptor in adjacent cells, resulting in the transcriptional induction of genes encoding basic helix loop helix (bHLH) proteins of the Hairy/Enhancer of split (Hes) family. These DNA-binding proteins recruit Gro to form complexes that repress the expression, as well as biochemical activity, of proteins that promote neuronal differentiation, like the bHLH factors encoded by achaete-scute complex and atonal genes (9Paroush Z.

Mammalian Gro/TLE proteins also perform anti-neurogenic functions. Gro/TLE1 and Gro/TLE3 are expressed in undifferentiated neural progenitor cells of the ventricular zone of the telencephalic vesicles (12Dehni G. Liu Y. Husain J. Stifani S. Mech.

Forced expression of Gro/TLE1 in the forebrain of transgenic mice causes an inhibition/delay of neuronal development in vivo (15Yao J. Liu Y. Lo R. Tretjakoff I. Peterson A. Stifani S. Mech. Dev. 2000; 93: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Similarly, exogenous expression of Gro/TLE1 in primary cultures of undifferentiated neural progenitor cells from the dorsal telencephalon causes decreased neuronal differentiation and an accumulation of proliferating progenitor cells (14Nuthall H.N.

The molecular mechanisms underlying Gro/TLE-mediated inhibition of neuronal differentiation in the mammalian fore-brain remain to be defined. Gro/TLEs form complexes, and repress transcription, with a number of DNA-binding proteins expressed during forebrain neuronal differentiation.

Most transcription factors that bind to Gro/TLE interact with the C-terminal WD40 repeat (WD) domain of the latter and can be grouped into two main classes based on the fact that they utilize two different types of short peptide sequences to recruit Gro/TLE co-repressors. Those “repressor peptides” belong to either the WRP(W/Y) (termed WRPW hereafter) or Engrailed homology 1 (Eh1; FXIXXIL) motif families (1Buscarlet M. Stifani S. Trends Cell Biol. 2007; 17: 353-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Although different in sequence, both WRPW and Eh1 peptides bind to an overlapping, but not completely identical, site on the surface of the Gro/TLE WD domain (25Jennings B.H. Pickles L.M. Wainwright S.M. Roe S.M. Pearl L.H. Ish-Horowicz D. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 645-655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Here we describe studies aimed at determining the contribution of different groups of transcription factors to the ability of Gro/TLE1 to inhibit the differentiation of cerebral cortex (cortical) neural progenitor cells into neurons. Our results show that Gro/TLE1 recruitment via repressor peptides of the WRPW family is essential for Gro/TLE1-mediated inhibition of neuronal differentiation. In contrast, the ability to interact with proteins that either contain repressor peptides of the Eh1 type or bind to the Gro/TLE N terminus is not sufficient to mediate Gro/TLE1 anti-neurogenic function. These results characterize the mechanisms underlying Gro/TLE1 activity during cortical neurogenesis.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3016-3027Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) have revealed that residues implicated in protein-protein interactions are preferentially located at similar positions on the external surface surrounding the central channel of the β-propeller. Multiple blades and residues are implicated in those interactions. More specifically, surface residues located at the start of the first β-sheet or just after the second one are often implicated in protein-protein interactions (32Wu G. Xu G. Schulman B.A. Jeffrey P.D. Harper J.W. Pavletich N.P. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1445-1456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). In agreement with those findings, analysis of the crystal structure of the Gro/TLE1 WD domain demonstrated that one side of the central pore of the β-propeller harbors overlapping binding sites for both WRPW and Eh1 peptides (25Jennings B.H.

This common transcription factor-binding pocket contains key surface residues located within separate blades of the β-propeller. Some of those residues are essential for interaction with both WRPW and Eh1 peptides, while others are required for binding to the former but not the latter (25Jennings B.H. Pickles L.M.

Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 6023-6028Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) to select five residues within the WD domain of Gro/TLE1 as in vitro mutagenesis targets (Fig. 1, A-C). More specifically, we generated the following mutations: V486S (similar to the Gro mutations V435A and V435L), C488R (analogous to mutations C348R in Tup1 and C437M in Gro), R534A (analogous to mutation R483H in Gro), E550K (analogous to mutations E463N in Tup1, E394K in UNC-37, and E499A in Gro), and L743F (analogous to mutation L692F in Gro) (Fig. 1D). Based on crystallographic data (25Jennings B.H. Pickles L.M. Wainwright S.M. Roe S.M. Pearl L.H. Ish-Horowicz D. Mol.

Structure. 2002; 10: 751-761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), these mutations were not expected to disrupt the overall structure of the WD domain. In agreement with this prediction, we observed that all mutated proteins migrated on denaturing polyacrylamide gels like wildtype Gro/TLE1 (Fig. 1E), were able to translocate to the nucleus (Fig. 1F), and retained the ability to repress transcription from a basally active promoter when expressed as fusion proteins with the DNA-binding domain of the yeast protein GAL4 (Fig. 2). Together, these results demonstrate that the point mutations in the WD domain of Gro/TLE1 selected for this study do not significantly perturb the structure and biochemical activity of Gro/TLE1. Different Effects of WD Domain Mutations on the Ability of Gro/TLE1 to Interact with WRPW or Eh1 Repressor Peptides—To assess the possible effects of the WD domain mutations on the anti-neurogenic activity of Gro/TLE1, we first determined whether they would block Gro/TLE1 interaction with different transcription partners. Several Gro/TLE-binding factors that contain either WRPW or Eh1 motifs are expressed during cortical neuron development in cells where Gro/TLE1 is also expressed (18Yao J. Lai E. Stifani S. Mol.

We therefore selected specific Gro/TLE1 transcription partners that would represent examples of different categories of proteins. The bHLH factor Hes1 was selected as a prototypical WRPW motif-bearing protein. Moreover, Hes1 is a critical regulator of cortical neurogenesis (40Sasai Y. Kageyama R. Tagawa Y. Shigemoto R. Nakanishi S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2620-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 41Ishibashi M. Moriyoshi K. Sasai Y. Shiota K. Nakanishi S. Kageyama R.

Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 3136-3148Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Engrailed1 (En1) was chosen as a typical example of a protein that uses an Eh1 motif to recruit Gro/TLE proteins (43Jimenez G. Paroush Z. Ish-Horowicz D. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3072-3082Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). We also examined Tcf3, as an example of a transcription partner that interacts with the N terminus, and not the WD domain, of Gro/TLE (44Brantjes H. Roose J. van De Wetering M. Clevers H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1410-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Co-transfections followed by pull-down (Fig. 3A) or co-immunoprecipitations (Fig. 3, B and C) assays showed that separate WD mutations had different effects on Gro/TLE1 ability to interact with those proteins. All mutations completely blocked or severely reduced the interaction with Hes1 (Fig. 3A), suggesting that each of those residues is important for optimal WRPW peptide recognition. In contrast, the interaction of Gro/TLE1 with En1 was disrupted only by mutations C488R, R534A, and E550K, but not by the V486S and L743F mutations (Fig. 3B). These findings show that WRPW- and Eh1 motif recognition by the WD domain of Gro/TLE1 is mediated by both overlapping and separate residues. In particular, the contribution of Leu-743 is essential for WRPW peptide binding but not for Eh1 motif recognition. In contrast to the results with Hes1 and En1, all Gro/TLE1 WD mutations retained the ability to bind to Tcf3 (Fig. 3C). In agreement with this finding, each mutated protein repressed trans-activation mediated by β-catenin/Tcf complexes in transfected cells (data not shown). These results are consistent w"

SEA-ORCHID (South East Asia Optimising Reproductive and Child Health In Developing countries) is evaluating whether a multifaceted intervention to strengthen capacity for research synthesis, evidence-based care and knowledge implementation improves adoption of best clinical practice recommendations leading to better health for mothers and babies. In this study we assessed current practices in perinatal health care in four South East Asian countries and determined whether they were aligned with best practice recommendations.We completed an audit of 9550 medical records of women and their 9665 infants at nine hospitals; two in each of Indonesia, Malaysia and The Philippines, and three in Thailand between January-December 2005. We compared actual clinical practices with best practice recommendations selected from the Cochrane Library and the World Health Organization Reproductive Health Library. Evidence-based components of the active management of the third stage of labour and appropriately treating eclampsia with magnesium sulphate were universally practiced in all hospitals. Appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis for caesarean section, a beneficial form of care, was practiced in less than 5% of cases in most hospitals. Use of the unnecessary practices of enema in labour ranged from 1% to 61% and rates of episiotomy for vaginal birth ranged from 31% to 95%. Other appropriate practices were commonly performed to varying degrees between countries and also between hospitals within the same country.Whilst some perinatal health care practices audited were consistent with best available evidence, several were not. We conclude that recording of clinical practices should be an essential step to improve quality of care. Based on these findings, the SEA-ORCHID project team has been developing and implementing interventions aimed at increasing compliance with evidence-based clinical practice recommendations to improve perinatal practice in South East Asia."

Recently, gene expression profiling of diaphragm muscle from laminin α2 chain-deficient dy/dy dystrophic mice was reported (8van Lunteren E. Moyer M. Leahy P. Physiol. Genomics. 2006; 25: 85-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Predominantly augmented gene expression was reported, and approximately half of the genes that were shown to be up-regulated in dystrophic muscle encode proteins involved in muscle development and cell motility. Nevertheless, the diaphragm might have different molecular signatures compared with limb muscles. Hence, in this study, we have compared hind limb skeletal muscles from dy3K/dy3K mice, which completely lack expression of laminin α2 chain, with hind limb skeletal muscles from wild-type mice. In the present study, we report that the most strikingly up-regulated genes in laminin α2 chain deficient leg muscle encode specific isoforms of proteins that are transiently expressed during normal muscle development and regeneration and genes that encode cell adhesion and extracellular matrix proteins, whereas those being down-regulated mainly participate in diverse metabolic processes and kinase activities. One of the down-regulated genes, Cib2, encodes a protein called Cib2 (calcium- and integrin-binding protein 2). Virtually nothing is known about the expression and function of this protein. However, it is closely related to Cib1, which interacts with a diverse range of biological targets. For example, Cib1 binds to integrin αIIb in platelets and to several protein kinases (FAK and PAK1) (9Naik U.P. Patel P.M. Parise L.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4651-4654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 10Naik M.U. Naik U.P. Blood. 2003; 102: 3629-3636Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Moreover, Cib1 binds the Rho GTPase Rac3 and the antiapoptotic caspase-2 splice variant caspase-2S (11Yamniuk A.P. Vogel H.J. Calcium Bind. Protein. 2006; 1: 150-155Google Scholar). The functional consequences of these interactions are to a large extent unknown, but Cib1 has been implicated in hemostasis, DNA damage response, and apoptosis (11Yamniuk A.P. Vogel H.J. Calcium Bind. Protein. 2006; 1: 150-155Google Scholar). Of particular interest is the finding that Cib1 participates in outside-in signaling via αIIbβ3 in platelet precursors, possibly by acting as an inhibitor of αIIbβ3 activation (12Yuan W. Leisner T.M. McFadden A.W. Wang Z. Larson M.K. Clark S. Boudignon-Proudhon C. Lam S. C.-T. Parise L.V. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Integrin α7β1 is one of the major laminin α2 chain-binding receptors of muscle cells, and the absence of integrin α7 both in humans and mice leads to myopathy (13Mayer U. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14587-14590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Both α7 and β1 chains occur in several splice isoforms. The cytoplasmic domain of integrin α7 has at least two splice forms, A and B, and integrin β1 is also alternatively spliced in the regions encoding intracellular domains, giving rise to the major β1A and β1D isoforms (13Mayer U. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14587-14590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Notably, the signaling cascades induced by laminin α2 chain binding to integrin α7β1 are largely unknown. Investigating cellular signaling pathways that may be changed due to laminin α2 chain deficiency offers an approach to identifying molecular targets for MDC1A therapy. Here, we demonstrate that Cib2, whose expression is down-regulated in dystrophic dy3K/dy3K muscle, is a novel integrin α7Bβ1D-binding protein. We hypothesize that Cib2 might be involved in outside-in and/or inside-out signaling via integrin α7Bβ1D subunit in skeletal muscle. Animals—Wild-type (WT), laminin α2 chain-deficient (dy3K/dy3K), and dy3KLNα1TG mice were previously described (14Miyagoe Y. Hanaoka K. Nonaka I. Hayasaka M. Nabeshima Y. Arahata K. Nabeshima Y. Takeda S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 415: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 15Gawlik K. Miyagoe-Suzuki Y. Ekblom P. Takeda S. Durbeej M. Hum. Mol. Gen. 2004; 13: 1775-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Mdx breeder pairs were purchased from Jackson Laboratories. Animals were maintained in the animal facilities of the Biomedical Center (Lund) according to animal care guidelines, and permission was given by the regional ethical board. Preparation of Total RNA—Total RNA was isolated from normal adult mouse tissues and from all hind limb skeletal muscles of WT, dy3K/dy3K, dy3KLNα1TG and mdx mice (frozen mdx skeletal muscle was also generously provided by Dr. Rachelle Crosbie, UCLA) using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and further purified using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturers' instructions. RNA quality was analyzed by A260/A280 ratios and agarose gel analyses. Isolated total RNA was used for microarray, reverse transcription (RT)-PCR, and Northern blot analyses. Microarray—Total RNA was isolated independently from all hind limb muscles of three WT and three dy3K/dy3K mice (5 weeks old). After a quality control with an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent®), RNA was processed for microarray hybridization to Affymetrix MOE430 2.0 mouse GeneChips at Swegene Microarray Resource Centre (Lund, Sweden). Data Analysis and Visualization— dChip 2004 software was used for the analysis of microarray raw data, which was normalized, and the model-based expression values were calculated using the PM-only model (16Li C. Wong W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2001; 98: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (2690) Google Scholar). To identify differentially expressed genes, the following criteria were chosen: (i) an absolute and average -fold change of >2, (ii) a p value of <0.05 by t testing, and (iii) a present call in all WT replicates when computing the dy3K/dy3K down-regulated genes or a present call in all dy3K/dy3K replicates when computing the dy3K/dy3K up-regulated genes. The false discovery rate was assessed by 50 random permutations of the samples. The median false discovery rate of 50 permutations was 1.2%. After normalization and calculation of expression value, the samples were hierarchically clustered, which provides a quality control for the three independent biological replicates. Microarray data were deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus database, accession number GSE12049. Functional Classification—Expression Analysis Systematic Explorer (EASE) software (17Hosack D.A. Dennis Jr., G. Sherman B.T. Lane H.C. Lempicki R.A. Genome Biol. 2003; 4: R70Crossref PubMed Google Scholar (available on the World Wide Web) was used to classify genes into and find overrepresented categories of biological processes, cellular components, and molecular functions. In order to make an EASE analysis for a set of differentially expressed genes, the Affymetrix probe set IDs were translated to a list of nonredundant GeneIDs. Those probe set IDs lacking a GeneID were not considered in the EASE analysis. The LocusLink-mouse data set was used as background. GeneIDs not present in the background were removed from the analysis. An EASE score of <0.05 was considered significantly overrepresented. RT-PCR—Total RNA was reverse-transcribed using SuperScript II RT (Invitrogen). PCR amplification of specific fragments was performed with the following primers: Cib2, forward (TCTGTGCTCTCTGCGAATCAGC) and reverse (GCGATCATGTCCTCAAAGTCA); Cib3, forward (GGCTGTTCTATCGATACCAGGA) and reverse (GGTCTCCATCTGCTTCATCC); Rps18, forward (GGGCTGGAGAACTCACGGAGGAT) and reverse (GGCCCAGAGACTCATTTCTTCTT). Amplified fragments were 236, 380, and 300 bp, respectively. Quantitative Real Time PCR—Quantitative real time PCR was performed on a LightCycler (Roche Applied Science). We used Maxima SYBR Green qPCR Master Mix (Fermentas) to detect amplification products. Amplification efficiency was evaluated through amplification of serially diluted template cDNAs (1:5 to 1:125). We calculated the relative expression of Cib2 relative to housekeeping gene Tbp (encoding TATA box-binding protein) by the formula 2Δn, where Δn = nCib2 - nTbp. Primer pairs for Cib2 were as described above, and the primer pair for Tbp was GCTCTGGAATTGTACCGCAG (forward) and CTGGCTCATAGCTCTTGGCTC (reverse). The PCR conditions were 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 45 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. Northern Blot Analysis—The Cib2-specific probe was amplified by PCR using cDNA prepared from adult mouse skeletal muscle. Total RNA (20 μg) from different tissues was fractionated on a standard formaldehyde gel (1.2% agarose) and transferred to a nylon membrane (Bio-Rad) by capillary blotting. The ready made membrane with RNA isolated from skeletal muscle at various ages was from Zyagen. Twenty-five ng of the Cib2 probe was labeled with [32P]dCTP, using the Megaprime DNA Labeling System (GE Healthcare). Hybridization was performed for 1 h at 68 °C using ExpressHyb hybridization solution (Clontech). After washing (3 × 10 min with 2× SSC, 0.05% SDS at room temperature, and 2 × 20 min with 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 50 °C), the membrane was exposed to Hyperfilm MP (Amersham Biosciences) and then developed (Curix 60; AGFA). Whole Mount in Situ Hybridization—The entire coding region of Cib2 cDNA was subcloned into pYX-Asc vector (RZPD GmbH). Digoxigenin-labeled (Roche Applied Science) sense and antisense Cib2 riboprobes were synthesized by linearization with NotI and EcoRI and transcription with T7 and T3 polymerases, respectively. Probes were purified with the RNeasy minikit (Qiagen). For whole mount in situ hybridization, embryonic day 12.5–13.5 mouse embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight, dehydrated in methanol series, and kept at -20 °C in 100% methanol until used. Whole mount RNA in situ hybridization was carried out as described previously (18Pizard A. Haramis A.G. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.M. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Stuhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2004: 14.9.1-14.9.24Google Scholar). All steps before prehybridization were performed on ice except for the proteinase K treatment. Generation of Antibodies—Polyclonal antibodies (PEDRO and TANNI) were produced against a GST-Cib2 fusion protein (for expression of the fusion protein, see below). Immunization was performed by Agrisera AB (Vännäs, Sweden). Antibodies were purified from the sera using polyvinylidene difluoride strips. Briefly, polyvinylidene difluoride strips containing Cib2-GST and GST, respectively, were blocked in 5% BSA/PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Sera were incubated with strips overnight at 4 °C and washed 3 × 10 min with 500 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 1 × 10 min with 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. GST-Cib2 and GST strips were separated, and antibodies were eluted with 2 ml of 50 mm glycine, pH 2.5, at 4 °C. 200 μl of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, was added to bring the pH to 7.4. Immunofluorescence—Immunofluorescence was performed as previously described (15Gawlik K. Miyagoe-Suzuki Y. Ekblom P. Takeda S. Durbeej M. Hum. Mol. Gen. 2004; 13: 1775-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Quadriceps muscles were collected and analyzed from three mice of each genotype. Sections were incubated with rabbit polyclonal antibodies against Cib2 and integrin α7B chain (19Cohn R.D. Mayer U. Saher G. Herrmann R. van der Flier A. Sonnenberg A. Sorokin L. Voit T. J. Neurol. Sci. 1999; 163: 140-152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), respectively. For detection of neuromuscular junctions, samples were simultaneously incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated α-bungarotoxin (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Protein Extraction and Western Blot Analysis—Total protein extracts were isolated from all hind limb skeletal muscles of three WT (3.5 weeks old), three dy3K/dy3K (3.5 weeks old), and three dy3KLNα1TG mice (4.5 weeks old). All samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and reduced to powder. Samples were homogenized in preheated SDS-lysis buffer (80 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% SDS, 0.12 m sucrose, 5 mm EDTA) and a mixture of proteases inhibitors (Complete; 1:50; Roche Applied Science) and heated for 15 min at 56 °C. Protein extracts were quantified using the BCA assay kit (Pierce) following the manufacturer's instructions. Prior to loading on the gel, 30 μg of proteins were freshly diluted in loading buffer (61 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol) and heated to 94 °C for 5 min. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE using 15% acrylamide gels and blotted on nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond-C; Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were boiled for 30 min in deionized water and then blocked for 1 h in 1 × TBS containing 0.01% Tween 20, 5% milk, 3% BSA and incubated overnight at 4 °C with rabbit polyclonal serum anti-Cib2 (1:100, in 1× TBS, 0.01% Tween 20, 3% BSA). Blots were washed three times for 20 min each with 1× TBS containing 0.01% Tween 20 and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated polyclonal swine anti-rabbit immunoglobulins (1:2000 in 1× TBS, 0.01% Tween 20, 3% BSA, P0217; Dako) for 40 min and then exposed to ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Each membrane was also hybridized with mouse monoclonal anti-α-actinin (1:3000; clone EA-53; Sigma) for loading normalization following the same procedure as above using a secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (1:4000; sc-2005; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). The quantifications were performed using the ImageJ 1.40 software (available on the World Wide Web; developed by Wayne Rasband, National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD). Expression of GST Fusion Protein—Mouse Cib2 cDNA (GenBank™ accession number BC005739) was used as a template for PCR. The Cib2 cDNA was amplified by PCR using primers AAGAATTCAATGGGGAACAAGCAGACCAT (forward) and TTGCGGCCGCAGGCCCCCACGGCCTTGGCA (reverse) containing restriction sites EcoRI and NotI, respectively. The amplified product (590 bp) was digested with EcoRI and NotI and ligated into the vector pGEX-6P-1 (Amersham Biosciences). The in-frame fusion was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The GST fusion protein and GST were purified by glutathione-Sepharose according to the manufacturer's instructions, as previously described (20Kalamajski S. Oldberg Å J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 26740-26745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined using a BCA assay (Pierce). 45Ca2+ Binding—GST-Cib2 and GST were loaded and separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Hybond; 0.45-μm pore size; Amersham Biosciences). Blots were overlaid with 45Ca2+ (1 μCi/ml) for 10 min as previously described (9Naik U.P. Patel P.M. Parise L.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4651-4654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) with or without an excess of unlabeled CaCl2 (10 mm). The membranes were exposed to Hyperfilm MP for 5 days at -70 °C and then developed (Curix 60; AGFA). Solid Phase Binding Assay—Microtiter wells (Nunc) were coated with 50 μl of protein solution (5 μg/ml GST-Cib2 in PBS) or with BSA (40 μg/ml in PBS) or with laminin-111 (5 μg/ml in PBS; Chemicon) and incubated at 4 °C overnight. Wells were blocked with 100 μl of 1% BSA (1 mg of BSA/ml of PBS) at room temperature for 2 h and then washed three times with wash solution (0.5% BSA, 0.1% Tween 20). Fifty μl of 1% Nonidet P-40-extracted protein lysates from adult mouse skeletal muscle (5 μg/ml protein lysates in 0.5% BSA, 0.1% Tween 20) were added and incubated at room temperature for 60 min. The wells were washed three times with wash solution, and then primary antibodies against integrin α7A, α7B, β1A, and β1D (diluted 1:200 in 0.5% BSA, 0.1% Tween 20) were applied to separate wells and incubated for 60 min at room temperature. After washing three times, 50 μl of secondary antibody (rabbit IgG antibody, ab6722 Abcam, 1:500 in 0.5% BSA, 0.1% Tween 20) was added and incubated for 60 min. After additional washings, the amount of bound proteins was detected with phosphatase substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma). Protein binding to GST-Cib2/BSA was measured at A405. Data were analyzed using an unpaired t test. Intrinsic Tryptophan Fluorescence (ITF)—N-terminally acetylated peptides corresponding to the C-terminal portions of integrin α7A (GWDSSSGRSTPRPPCPSTTG) and α7B (LAADWHPELGPDGHPVPATA) were synthesized and purified (Innovagen). GST was cleaved off from GST-Cib2 using PreScission Protease (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The binding of Cib2 to the integrin peptides was studied under the following experimental conditions: 20 mm Hepes, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, pH 7.5, at 20 °C. Increased intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of the integrin peptides was monitored as a function of Cib2 concentration using a SPEX (Jobin Yvon) FluoroMax-3 spectrofluorometer in a 1-cm quartz cell. Fluorescence emission spectra were collected between 320 and 430 nm, selectively exciting the only present tryptophan residue at 295 nm. Point titrations were performed on 100 nm integrin peptides at increasing concentrations of Cib2, monitoring the fluorescence intensity change (increase) at the wavelength corresponding to the peak of the emission spectrum of the integrin peptide. Three independent titration data sets were collected, with no significant differences in the results. The data were analyzed according to the model of a single class of binding sites (21Eftink M.R. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 278: 258-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) upon correction for the amount of Cib2 actually free in solution. Array Data—In order to investigate the gene expression differences between WT and laminin α2 chain-deficient muscle, we compared hind limb muscles at 5 weeks of age. A gene was considered differentially expressed if it met the criteria described under “Experimental Procedures.” We present the top 40 genes with the highest significant positive and negative -fold changes, respectively (Tables 1 and 2). The clustering dendogram (supplemental Fig. 1) revealed that the WT samples comprised a distinct subgroup, whereas the dy3K/dy3K muscle samples were subgrouped together. Thus, hierarchical clustering correctly grouped the replicates by their appropriate genotype. We used EASE to facilitate the biological interpretations from the results of the microarray experiments, and genes with altered expression were classified within specific gene ontology categories of 1) biological processes, 2) cellular components, and 3) molecular functions. Among the up-regulated genes, the most overrepresented biological processes were muscle development, cell motility, cell adhesion, muscle contraction, and acute phase response, whereas the most overrepresented cellular components were extracellular, extracellular space, extracellular matrix, and actin cytoskeleton. The molecular function categories with the highest overrepresentation involved the theme of binding (heparin, glycosaminoglycan, metal ion, and calcium ion binding and enzyme regulator activity) (Table 1 and data not shown). Among the genes with decreased expression, themes concerning metabolism were overrepresented in the category of biological processes (oxidation of organic compounds, energy pathways, carbohydrate metabolism, glucose metabolism, and main pathways of carbohydrate metabolism). The most overrepresented cellular components were cytoplasm, mitochondrion, and unlocalized. The most overrepresented molecular functions were calmodulin-regulated protein kinase activity, kinase activity, catalytic activity, oxidoreductase activity, and calmodulin binding (Table 2) (data not shown). It is interesting to note that laminin α2 chain mRNA was only reduced ∼2.6-fold (Table 2). However, Guo et al. (22Guo L.T. Zhang X.U. Kuang W. Xu H. Liu L.A. Vilquin J.-T. Miyagoe-Suzuki Y. Takeda S. Ruegg M.A. Wewer U. Engvall E. Neuromuscul. Disord. 2003; 13: 207-215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) have shown that dy3K/dy3K muscles are completely devoid of laminin α2 chain, in contrast to other mouse models for laminin α2 chain deficiency. Thus, the remaining mRNA appears not to encode a protein.TABLE 1Top 40 up-regulated genes in laminin α2 chain-deficient skeletal muscleGene nameGeneIDSymbolChange-foldMyosin, heavy polypeptide 3, skeletal muscle, embryonic17883Myh355.35Sarcolipin66402Sln29.21Myosin, light polypeptide 4, alkali; atrial, embryonic17896Myl421.21Troponin T2, cardiac21956Tnnt218.79Ankyrin repeat domain 1 (cardiac muscle)107765Ankrd117.15Angiotensin II receptor, type 211609Agtr215.94Metallothionein 217750Mt215.63Myosin, heavy polypeptide 8, skeletal muscle, perinatal17885Myh810.84Delta-like 1 homolog (Drosophila)13386Dlk18.81Lectin, galactose binding, soluble 316854Lgals37.66C1q and tumor necrosis factor-related protein 381799C1qtnf37.33Metallothionein 117748Mt17.12Procollagen, type VIII, α112837Col8a17.03Tubulin, β2b73710Tubb2b6.95Leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor, subfamily B, member 414728Lilrb46.92Macrophage-expressed gene 117476Mpeg16.83S100 calcium-binding protein A420198S100a46.80C-type (calcium-dependent, carbohydrate recognition domain) lectin, superfamily member 1256644Clec7a6.62GTL2, imprinted maternally expressed untranslated mRNA17263Meg36.28Double cortin and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase-like 113175Dclk16.08Ectodysplasin A2 isoform receptor245527Eda2r6.03RIKEN cDNA 6030416H16 gene777126030416H16Rik6.02Expressed sequence AW551984244810AW5519845.53Cathepsin S13040Ctss5.24Cartilage intermediate layer protein, nucleotide pyrophosphohydrolase214425Cilp5.21ATPase (Na+)/K+-transporting, β4 polypeptide67821Atp1b44.99Proteoglycan 4 (megakaryocyte-stimulating factor, articular superficial zone protein)65022Prg44.99Serine (or cysteine) proteinase inhibitor, clade A, member 3N20716Serpina3n4.97Procollagen, type XIX, α112823Col19a14.65CD44 antigen12505Cd444.63RIKEN cDNA 1110006E14 gene762861110006E14Rik4.63Periostin, osteoblast-specific factor50706Postn4.58Insulin-like growth factor 216002Igf24.54Thrombospondin 421828Thbs44.26Glycoprotein (transmembrane) nmb93695Gpnmb4.23RIKEN cDNA 1110002H13 gene661394.20Potassium voltage-gated channel, Isk-related family, member 1-like66240Kcne1l4.12Cytochrome P450, family 2, subfamily f, polypeptide 213107Cyp2f24.09Kruppel-like factor 512224Klf53.87A disintegrin and metalloprotease domain 811501Adam83.85 Open table in a new tab TABLE 2Top 40 down-regulated genes in laminin α2 chain-deficient skeletal muscleGene nameGeneIDSymbolChange-foldRIKEN cDNA 2310065F04 gene741842310065F04Rik–6.2Spermine oxidase228608Smox–4.84Immunoglobulin heavy chain 6 (heavy chain of IgM)16019Igh-6–4.53D-Aspartate oxidase70503Ddo–4.29Exocyst complex component 3-like 274463Exoc3l2–4.04RIKEN cDNA 9330159F19 gene2124489330159F19Rik–4.03Glutamic pyruvate transaminase (alanine aminotransferase) 2108682Gpt2–3.82Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 626399Map2k6–3.81RIKEN cDNA 2310010M20 gene695762310010M20Rik–3.73Calcium- and integrin-binding family member 256506Cib2–3.69Aquaporin 411829Aqp4–3.66Prostaglandin E receptor 3 (subtype EP3)19218Ptger3–3.59RIKEN cDNA 6430571L13 gene2355996430571L13Rik–3.4Solute carrier family 37 (glycerol 6-phosphate transporter), member 414385Slc37a4–3.36Tubulin, α853857Tuba8–3.35Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II α12322Camk2a–3.34Expressed sequence AU040377268780Egflam–3.27cDNA sequence BC018222235135Tmem45b–3.26JTV1 gene231872Jtv1–3.18RIKEN cDNA 2010110I21 gene702602010110I21Rik–3.18Ganglioside-induced differentiation-associated-protein 114545Gdap1–3.05HRAS-like suppressor27281Hrasls–3Protein kinase, AMP-activated, β2 noncatalytic subunit108097Prkab2–2.92Nuclear receptor subfamily 4, group A, member 115370Nr4a1–2.89ADP-ribosylation factor-like 6-interacting protein 256298Arl6ip2–2.79Leu"
https://openalex.org/W2032784080,"Alterations of brain and plasma alpha-synuclein levels and SNCA gene variability have been implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). We therefore measured alpha-synuclein protein levels in postmortem PD and control cerebellum tissue using Western blot and investigated whether the levels correlated to SNCA genotype. We found markedly decreased alpha-synuclein levels in PD patients (n=16) compared to gender- and age-matched controls (n=14; P=0.004) normalized to alpha-tubulin. We also performed an association study of the noncoding polymorphisms rs2737029 (A/G) and rs356204 (A/G) (intron 4), and of rs356219 (T/C) (3'-region) of SNCA in a Swedish PD case-control material. Using a two-sided chi(2) test, we found significant association of rs2737029 (P=0.003; chi(2)=9.07) and rs356204 (P=0.048; chi(2)=3.91) with disease, strengthening the involvement of SNCA polymorphisms in sporadic PD. Stratification of the human postmortem brain material by genotype of the three investigated polymorphisms, did not indicate any influence of genotype on alpha-synuclein protein levels when comparing PD with controls. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that the investigated Parkinson patients have markedly reduced levels of alpha-synuclein in cerebellum, and that this reduction is general, rather then correlated to the investigated polymorphisms, although two of the polymorphisms also associated with disease in a Swedish material."
https://openalex.org/W2166012863,"Besides its well established role in control of cellular cholesterol homeostasis, the liver X receptor (LXR) has been implicated in the regulation of hepatic gluconeogenesis. We investigated the role of the major hepatic LXR isoform in hepatic glucose metabolism during the feeding-to-fasting transition in vivo. In addition, we explored hepatic glucose sensing by LXR during carbohydrate refeeding. Lxrα-/- mice and their wild-type littermates were subjected to a fasting-refeeding protocol and hepatic carbohydrate fluxes as well as whole body insulin sensitivity were determined in vivo by stable isotope procedures. Lxrα-/- mice showed an impaired response to fasting in terms of hepatic glycogen depletion and triglyceride accumulation. Hepatic glucose 6-phosphate turnover was reduced in 9-h fasted Lxrα-/- mice as compared with controls. Although hepatic gluconeogenic gene expression was increased in 9-h fasted Lxrα-/- mice compared with wild-type controls, the actual gluconeogenic flux was not affected by Lxrα deficiency. Hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity were similar in Lxrα-/- and wild-type mice. Compared with wild-type controls, the induction of hepatic lipogenic gene expression was blunted in carbohydrate-refed Lxrα-/- mice, which was associated with lower plasma triglyceride concentrations. Yet, expression of “classic” LXR target genes Abca1, Abcg5, and Abcg8 was not affected by Lxrα deficiency in carbohydrate-refed mice. In summary, these studies identify LXRα as a physiologically relevant mediator of the hepatic response to fasting. However, the data do not support a role for LXR in hepatic glucose sensing.

LXRs can be activated by oxidized cholesterol metabolites (oxysterols), which have been identified to be their natural ligands. Hence, LXRs act as intracellular “cholesterol sensors” (3Lehmann J.M.

Both SREBP-1c and ChREBP are involved in control of the conversion of glucose into fatty acids. Thus, LXRs coordinate the interactions between sterol and fatty acid metabolism, for instance to enable cholesterol ester formation during cellular cholesterol overload. In the past years, several studies have been published that point toward a role of LXRs in the control of glucose homeostasis. These studies showed that pharmacological LXR activation improves glycemic control in diabetic rodent models by increasing peripheral glucose disposal (8Grefhorst A. Van Dijk T.H.

To explore the physiological relevance of LXR in hepatic glucose metabolism we subjected mice deficient for Lxrα, the major hepatic isoform, to a fasting-refeeding protocol. Lxrα-/- mice showed an impaired hepatic fasting response in terms of glycogen depletion and triglyceride (TG) accumulation. Although gluconeogenic gene expression was increased in 9-h fasted Lxrα-/- mice compared with wild-type mice, stable isotope infusion revealed the actual gluconeogenic flux was not affected by Lxrα deficiency. G6P turnover was reduced in Lxrα-/- mice compared with wild-type mice. In carbohydraterefed Lxrα-/- mice, the hepatic lipogenic response was blunted while changes in the expression of the LXR target genes Abca1, Abcg5, and Abcg8 were similar in wild-type and Lxrα-/- mice. Taken together, these data imply an important role for LXRα in the control of hepatic glucose metabolism upon fasting, but they do not support the hypothesis that Lxrα acts as a hepatic glucose sensor. Animals and Diets—F2 male Lxrα-/- mice and their wild-type littermates on a Sv129/OlaHsd C57Bl/6J mixed background (17van der Veen J.N. Havinga R. Bloks V.W. Groen A.K. Kuipers F. J. Lipid Res. 2007; 48: 337-347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) were housed in a light- and temperature-controlled facility (lights on 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., 21 °C). They were fed standard laboratory chow ad libitum (RMH-B, Abdiets, Woerden, The Netherlands) and had free access to water. All experiments were approved by the Ethics Committee for Animal Experiments of the University of Groningen. Fasting and Refeeding Experiments—For fasting experiments we studied separate groups of mice. All mice were killed by cardiac puncture under isoflurane anesthesia at 8 a.m., either without being fasted, after a 9-h fast, or after a 24-h fast. For the refeeding experiments, mice were killed at 8 a.m. after a 24-h refeeding period with free access to high carbohydrate chow (38.5% w/w sucrose, Abdiets) following a 24-h fasting period. Plasma Metabolite Concentrations—Blood glucose concentrations were measured using a EuroFlash glucose meter (Lifescan Benelux, Beerse, Belgium). Plasma insulin concentrations were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Ultrasensitive Mouse Insulin kit, Mercodia, Uppsala, Sweden). Plasma non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA), β-hydroxybutyrate (β-HB), TG, and cholesterol concentrations were determined using commercially available kits (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany and Wako Chemicals, Neuss, Germany). Hepatic Metabolite Content and Gene Expression Levels—Livers were quickly removed, weighed, freeze-clamped, and stored at -80 °C. A small piece of liver was fixed in 4% formalin in phosphate-buffered saline for histological analysis. Blood was centrifuged (4000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C), and plasma was stored at -20 °C. Frozen liver was homogenized in ice-cold saline. Hepatic TG concentrations were analyzed using a commercially available kit (Roche Diagnostics) after lipid extraction according to Bligh and Dyer (18Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (41848) Google Scholar). Hepatic G6P and glycogen content were determined as described previously (19Hohorst H.J. Bergmeyer H.U. Methoden der Enzymatischen Analyse. Verlag Chemie, Weinheim, Germany1970: 1200-1204Google Scholar, 20Keppler D. Decker K. Bergmeyer H.U. Methoden der Enzymatischen Analyse. Verlag Chemie, Weinheim, Germany1970: 1089-1094Google Scholar). In addition, hepatic glycogen disposition was visualized by periodic acid-Schiff staining of 3-μm-thick liver slices. RNA was extracted from frozen liver using TRI reagent (Sigma) and subsequently converted into cDNA by a reverse transcription procedure using Moloney murine leukemia virus transcriptase and random primers according to the manufacturer's protocol. For real-time PCR, cDNA was amplified using the appropriate primers and probes. Primer and probe sequences for 18S, ATP binding cassette a1/g5/g8 (Abca1/g5/g8), carbohydrate response element binding protein (Chrebp), fatty acid synthase (Fas), fructose-1,6-biphosphatase 1 (Fbp1), glucose-6-phosphate hydrolase (G6ph), glucose-6-phosphate translocase (G6pt), peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma co-activator 1 alpha (Pgc-1α), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (Pepck), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (Pdk4), stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (Scd1), and sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c (Srebp-1c) have been published previously (www.LabPediatricsRug.nl). For acetyl-CoA carboylase 1 (Acc1) the following primer/probes were used: sense, CCA TCC AAA CAG AGG GAA CAT C; antisense, CTA CAT GAG TCA TGC CAT AGT GGT T; probe, ACG CTA AAC AGA ATG TCC TTT GCC TCC AAC (accession number NM_133360.2).

All mRNA levels were normalized for 18S expression. In Vivo Flux Measurements—Mice were equipped with a permanent catheter in the right atrium via the jugular vein (21Kuipers F. Havinga R. Bosschieter H. Toorop G.P. Hindriks F.R. Vonk R.J. Gastroenterology. 1985; 88: 403-411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and were allowed a recovery period of at least 3 days. After the recovery period, the mice were placed in experimental cages and were fasted from 11 p.m. to 8 a.m. with drinking water available. All infusion experiments were performed in conscious, unrestrained mice. To determine hepatic carbohydrate fluxes, mice were infused with a solution containing [U-13C]glucose (7 μm), [2-13C]glycerol (82 μm), [1-2H]galactose (17 μm), and paracetamol (1 mg/ml) during 6 h at an infusion rate of 0.6 ml/h as described previously (22Van Dijk T.H.

Blood and urine spots were collected every 60 min on filter paper. In total, 80–90 μl of blood was withdrawn per animal from the tail vein during these experiments. Hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamps were performed in a separate group of mice as described earlier (8Grefhorst A. Van Dijk T.H. Hammer A. van der Sluijs F.H. Havinga R. Havekes L.M. Romijn J.A.

Mice were fasted from 11 p.m. to 8 a.m. the next day with drinking water available. During 6 h, they were infused with two solutions. The first solution contained bovine serum albumin (1% w/v, Sigma), somatostatin (40 μg/ml, UCB, Breda, The Netherlands), insulin (110 milliunits/ml, Actrapid, Novo Nordisk, Bagsvaerd, Denmark), glucose (1111 mm), and [U-13C]glucose (33 mm, 99% 13C atom percent excess, Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Andover, MA) and was infused at a rate of 0.135 ml/h. The second solution consisted of glucose (1111 mm) containing [U-13C]glucose (33 mm). The infusion rate of this solution was variable to maintain euglycemia. Blood glucose concentrations were measured every 15 min. Every 30 min, a bloodspot was collected. In total, 150–170 μl of blood was withdrawn per animal from the tail vein during these experiments. Analytical procedures for extraction of glucose from blood spots, derivatization of the extracted compounds and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry measurements of derivatives were performed according to van Dijk et al.

To balance input and output of hepatic G6P, minor adaptations were made to the published equations (26Derks T.G. Van Dijk T.H. Grefhorst A. Rake J.P. Smit G.P. Kuipers F. Reijngoud D.J. Hepatology. 2008; 47: 1032-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The equations are given in supplemental Table S1. Glucose production and metabolic clearance rates during hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamps were calculated according to Grefhorst et al. (8Grefhorst A. Van Dijk T.H. Hammer A. van der Sluijs F.H. Havinga R. Havekes L.M. Romijn J.A. Groot P.H. Reijngoud D.J. Kuipers F. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2005; 289: E829-E838Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Statistics—All data are presented as mean values ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS for Windows software (SPSS 12.02, Chicago, IL). Analysis of data obtained in Lxrα-/- versus wild-type mice was assessed by Mann-Whitney U test for plasma and liver parameters. In vivo flux data were analyzed by analysis of variance for repeated measurements. The null hypothesis was rejected at the 0.05 level of probability, except for the fasting-refeeding experiments, where this p value was adjusted for multiple comparisons. The Fasting Response Is Hampered in Lxrα-/- Mice—We compared the changes in metabolic parameters in fasted Lxrα-/- mice and wild-type littermate controls. Upon fasting, blood glucose and plasma insulin concentrations decreased while plasma NEFA and β-hydroxybutyrate concentrations increased, without differences between Lxrα-/- and wild-type mice (Table 1). Plasma TG concentrations increased upon fasting in both genotypes while plasma cholesterol concentrations were not affected. Compared with wild-type mice, hepatic G6P content tended to be higher in 9-h fasted Lxrα-/- mice (Fig. 1A, +73%, p = 0.26). Twenty-four hours of fasting decreased hepatic G6P content in both phenotypes, but this drop was less pronounced in Lxrα-/- mice. Hepatic glycogen content decreased upon fasting in both groups (Fig. 1B). However, in wild-type mice hepatic glycogen content already reached its lowest level after a 9-h fast, whereas in 9-h fasted Lxrα-/- mice it was similar to what observed in the fed state. Histological analysis revealed that the glycogen in the 9-h fasted Lxrα-/- mice was mainly located in the periportal zone (Fig. 1C). After 24 h of fasting, hepatic glycogen stores were similarly depleted in both genotypes (Fig. 1B). Hepatic TG content increased upon fasting, but to a markedly less extent in Lxrα-/- mice compared with wild-type controls (Fig. 1D).TABLE 1Plasma and liver parameters in Lxrα–/– mice and their wild-type littermates Mice were fasted for 0, 9, or 24 hours.

We therefore determined whether the increased hepatic glycogen content in the 9-h fasted Lxrα-/- mice was paralleled by an increased expression of genes encoding enzymes involved in hepatic gluconeogenesis. Compared with wild-type mice, hepatic expression of Pgc-1α, Pepck, Fbp1, and G6ph (encoding G6P hydrolase, one component of the multiprotein complex G6Pase) were all increased in 9-h fasted Lxrα-/- mice (Fig. 2A). Expression of genes encoding other major enzymes involved in hepatic carbohydrate metabolism (G6pt, Gk, Pk, Pdk4, and Gp, except for Gs, Fig. 2, A and B) was not affected by Lxrα deficiency. Moreover, the lipogenic gene expression profile was similar in 9-h fasted wild-type and Lxrα-/- mice, except for a reduction of Acc2 and Scd1 expression (Fig. 2C). Impaired Hepatic G6P Metabolism in 9-h Fasted Lxrα-/- Mice Is Associated with Decreased Glucose Turnover and Increased Hepatic G6P Content—A 9-h fast uncovered major differences in hepatic adaptive response between wild-type and Lxrα-/- mice. To determine whether the increased gluconeogenic gene expression was a cause of the observed differences in hepatic glycogen and G6P content between 9-h fasted wild-type and Lxrα-/- mice, we determined glucose turnover, disposal, and individual hepatic carbohydrate fluxes using stable isotope techniques (22Van Dijk T.H.

During the infusion of the stable isotopes, blood glucose concentrations were lower in Lxrα-/- mice compared with wild-type littermates (Fig. 3A). Steady-state isotope enrichment was reached from 3 h of infusion onwards. Isotope dilution data during this steady-state situation are shown in Table 2. Glucose cycling and endogenous glucose production were reduced in Lxrα-/- mice compared with their wild-type littermates (Fig. 3B), resulting in a decreased total glucose production. Metabolic glucose clearance was similar in both groups of mice (Fig. 3C).TABLE 2Primary isotopic parameters during steady state infusion (t = 180–360 min) in 9-h fasted Lxrα–/– mice and their wild-type littermates The parameters were calculated using the equations listed in supplemental Table S1.

In addition, the compartmentation of newly synthesized G6P toward glucose (86 ± 1% in both Lxrα-/- and wild-type mice) and glycogen (14 ± 1% in both Lxrα-/- and wild-type mice) was comparable in both genotypes. However, glucose phosphorylation (glucokinase flux), dephosphorylation (glucose-6-phosphatase flux), glycogen synthesis (glycogen synthase flux), and glycogen breakdown (glycogen phosphorylase flux) were reduced in Lxrα-/- mice compared with wild-type mice (Table 3).

https://openalex.org/W2054306159,"Taste and olfaction are each tuned to a unique set of chemicals in the outside world, and their corresponding sensory spaces are mapped in different areas in the brain. This dichotomy matches categories of receptors detecting molecules either in the gaseous or in the liquid phase in terrestrial animals. However, in Drosophila olfactory and gustatory neurons express receptors which belong to the same family of 7-transmembrane domain proteins. Striking overlaps exist in their sequence structure and in their expression pattern, suggesting that there might be some functional commonalities between them. In this work, we tested the assumption that Drosophila olfactory receptor proteins are compatible with taste neurons by ectopically expressing an olfactory receptor (OR22a and OR83b) for which ligands are known. Using electrophysiological recordings, we show that the transformed taste neurons are excited by odor ligands as by their cognate tastants. The wiring of these neurons to the brain seems unchanged and no additional connections to the antennal lobe were detected. The odor ligands detected by the olfactory receptor acquire a new hedonic value, inducing appetitive or aversive behaviors depending on the categories of taste neurons in which they are expressed i.e. sugar- or bitter-sensing cells expressing either Gr5a or Gr66a receptors. Taste neurons expressing ectopic olfactory receptors can sense odors at close range either in the aerial phase or by contact, in a lipophilic phase. The responses of the transformed taste neurons to the odorant are similar to those obtained with tastants. The hedonic value attributed to tastants is directly linked to the taste neurons in which their receptors are expressed."
https://openalex.org/W2077987278,"Background The vaccinia-related kinase 1 (VRK1) protein, an activator of p53, can be proteolytically downregulated by an indirect mechanism, which requires p53-dependent transcription. Principal Findings In this work we have biochemically characterized the contribution of several p53 transcriptional cofactors with acetyl transferase activity to the induction of VRK1 downregulation that was used as a functional assay. Downregulation of VRK1 induced by p53 is prevented in a dose dependent manner by either p300 or CBP, but not by PCAF, used as transcriptional co-activators, suggesting that p53 has a different specificity depending on the relative level of these transcriptional cofactors. This inhibition does not require p53 acetylation, since a p53 acetylation mutant also induces VRK1 downregulation. PCAF can not revert the VRK1 protection effect of p300, indicating that these two proteins do not compete for a common factor needed to induce VRK1 downregulation. The protective effect is also induced by the C/H3 domain of p300, a region implicated in binding to several transcription factors and SV40 large T antigen; but the protective effect is lost when a mutant C/H3Del33 is used. The protective effect is a consequence of direct binding of the C/H3 domain to the transactivation domain of p53. A similar downregulatory effect can also be detected with VRK2 protein. Conclusions/Significance Specific p53-dependent effects are determined by the availability and ratios of its transcriptional cofactors. Specifically, the downregulation of VRK1/VRK2 protein levels, as a consequence of p53 accumulation, is thus dependent on the levels of the p300/CBP protein available for transcriptional complexes, since in this context this cofactor functions as a repressor of the effect. These observations point to the relevance of knowing the cofactor levels in order to determine one effect or another."

Daniele Piomelli explores how recent clinical trials testing rimonabant, an inhibitor of endocannabinoid signaling, for weight loss emerged from studies of individuals with schizophrenia; such trials have spurred basic research into how endocannabinoids affect both energy use and mood. Beat Lutz and Krisztina Monory examine how rimonabant might prove useful for preventing the development of adult epilepsy in response to fever-induced seizures in infants and young children."
https://openalex.org/W1984876194,"The alpha-subunits of the trimeric Go class of GTPases, comprising the splice variants Go1alpha and Go2alpha, are abundantly expressed in brain and reside on both plasma membrane and synaptic vesicles. Go2alpha is involved in the vesicular storage of monoamines but its physiological relevance is still obscure. We now show that genetic depletion of Go2alpha reduces motor activity induced by dopamine-enhancing drugs like cocaine, as repeated injections of cocaine fail to provoke behavioral sensitization in Go2alpha(-/-) mice. In Go2alpha(-/-) mice, D1 receptor signaling in the striatum is attenuated due to a reduced expression of Golf alpha and Gs alpha. Following cocaine treatment, Go2alpha(-/-) mice have lower D1 and higher D2 receptor amounts compared to wild-type mice. The lack of behavioral sensitization correlates with reduced dopamine levels in the striatum and decreased expression of tyrosine hydroxylase. One reason for the neurochemical changes may be a reduced uptake of monoamines by synaptic vesicles from Go2alpha(-/-) mice as a consequence of a lowered set point for filling. We conclude that Go2alpha optimizes vesicular filling which is instrumental for normal dopamine functioning and for the development of drug-induced behavioral sensitization."

https://openalex.org/W2050444606,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system of unknown etiology with both genetic and environmental factors playing a role in susceptibility. To date, the HLA DR15/DQ6 haplotype within the major histocompatibility complex on chromosome 6p, is the strongest genetic risk factor associated with MS susceptibility. Additional alleles of IL7 and IL2 have been identified as risk factors for MS with small effect. Here we present two independent studies supporting an allelic association of MS with polymorphisms in the ST8SIA1 gene, located on chromosome 12p12 and encoding ST8 alpha-N-acetyl-neuraminide alpha-2,8-sialyltransferase 1. The initial association was made in a single three-generation family where a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs4762896, was segregating together with HLA DR15/DQ6 in MS patients. A study of 274 family trios ( affected child and both unaffected parents) from Australia validated the association of ST8SIA1 in individuals with MS, showing transmission disequilibrium of the paternal alleles for three additional SNPs, namely rs704219, rs2041906, and rs1558793, with p = 0.001, p = 0.01 and p = 0.01 respectively. These findings implicate ST8SIA1 as a possible novel susceptibility gene for MS."

https://openalex.org/W2038960720,"It is becoming increasingly clear that the soluble protofibrillar species that proceed amyloid fibril formation are associated with a range of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson diseases. Computer simulations of the processes that lead to the formation of these oligomeric species are starting to make significant contributions to our understanding of the determinants of protein aggregation. We simulate different systems at constant concentration but with a different number of peptides and we study the how the finite number of proteins affects the underlying free energy of the system and therefore the relative stability of the species involved in the process. If not taken into account, this finite size effect can undermine the validity of theoretical predictions regarding the relative stability of the species involved and the rates of conversion from one to the other. We discuss the reasons that give rise to this finite size effect form both a probabilistic and energy fluctuations point of view and also how this problem can be dealt by a finite size scaling analysis."

https://openalex.org/W1967439544,"Homology modeling is the most commonly used technique to build a three-dimensional model for a protein sequence. It heavily relies on the quality of the sequence alignment between the protein to model and related proteins with a known three dimensional structure. Alignment quality can be assessed according to the physico-chemical properties of the three dimensional models it produces. In this work, we introduce fifteen predictors designed to evaluate the properties of the models obtained for various alignments. They consist of an energy value obtained from different force fields (CHARMM, ProsaII or ANOLEA) computed on residue selected around misaligned regions. These predictors were evaluated on ten challenging test cases. For each target, all possible ungapped alignments are generated and their corresponding models are computed and evaluated. The best predictor, retrieving the structural alignment for 9 out of 10 test cases, is based on the ANOLEA atomistic mean force potential and takes into account residues around misaligned secondary structure elements. The performance of the other predictors is significantly lower. This work shows that substantial improvement in local alignments can be obtained by careful assessment of the local structure of the resulting models."
