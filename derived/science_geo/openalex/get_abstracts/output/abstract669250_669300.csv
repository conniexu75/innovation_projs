https://openalex.org/W3131890445,"Background Since 2010, nationwide networks of reference centers for sarcomas (RREPS/NETSARC/RESOS) collected and prospectively reviewed all cases of sarcomas and connective tumors of intermediate malignancy (TIM) in France. Methods The nationwide incidence of sarcoma or TIM (2013–2016) was measured using the 2013 WHO classification and confirmed by a second independent review by expert pathologists. Simple clinical characteristics, yearly variations and correlation of incidence with published clinical trials are presented and analyzed. Results Over 150 different histological subtypes are reported from the 25172 patients with sarcomas (n = 18712, 74,3%) or TIM (n = 6460, 25.7%), with n = 5838, n = 6153, n = 6654, and n = 6527 yearly cases from 2013 to 2016. Over these 4 years, the yearly incidence of sarcomas and TIM was therefore 70.7 and 24.4 respectively, with a combined incidence of 95.1/10 6 /year, higher than previously reported. GIST, liposarcoma, leiomyosarcomas, undifferentiated sarcomas represented 13%, 13%, 11% and 11% of tumors. Only GIST, as a single entity had a yearly incidence above 10/10 6 /year. There were respectively 30, 64 and 66 different histological subtypes of sarcomas or TIM with an incidence ranging from 10 to 1/10 6 , 1–0.1/10 6 , or &lt; 0.1/10 6 /year respectively. The 2 latter incidence groups represented 21% of the patients with 130 histotypes. Published phase III and phase II clinical trials (p&lt;10 −6 ) are significantly higher with sarcomas subtypes with an incidence above 1/10 6 per. Conclusions This nationwide registry of sarcoma patients, with exhaustive histology review by sarcoma experts, shows that the incidence of sarcoma and TIM is higher than reported, and that tumors with a very low incidence (1&lt;10 6 /year) are less likely to be included in clinical trials."
https://openalex.org/W3130321562,"Background The long-term clinical and physiological consequences of COVID-19 infection remain unclear. While fatigue has emerged as a common symptom following infection, little is known about its links with autonomic dysfunction. SARS-CoV-2 is known to infect endothelial cells in acute infection, resulting in autonomic dysfunction. Here we set out to test the hypothesis that this results in persistent autonomic dysfunction and is associated with post-COVID fatigue in convalescent patients. Methods We recruited 20 fatigued and 20 non-fatigued post-COVID patients (median age 44.5 years, 36/40 (90%) female, median time to follow up 166.5 days). Fatigue was assessed using the Chalder Fatigue Scale. These underwent the Ewing’s autonomic function test battery, including deep breathing, active standing, Valsalva manoeuvre and cold-pressor testing, with continuous electrocardiogram and blood pressure monitoring, as well as near-infrared spectroscopy-based cerebral oxygenation. 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was also conducted, and patients completed the generalised anxiety disorder-7 questionnaire. We assessed between-group differences in autonomic function test results and used unadjusted and adjusted linear regression to investigate the relationship between fatigue, anxiety, and autonomic test results. Results We found no pathological differences between fatigued and non-fatigued patients on autonomic testing or on 24-hour blood pressure monitoring. Symptoms of orthostatic intolerance were reported by 70% of the fatigued cohort at the time of active standing, with no associated physiological abnormality detected. Fatigue was strongly associated with increased anxiety (p &lt;0.001), with no patients having a pre-existing diagnosis of anxiety. Conclusions These results demonstrate the significant burden of fatigue, symptoms of autonomic dysfunction and anxiety in the aftermath of COVID-19 infection, but reassuringly do not demonstrate pathological findings on autonomic testing."

Three beliefs focus on contextual factors: class size, classroom setup, and teaching evaluations; three focus on individual factors: security of employment, research activity, and prior exposure. The analysis indicates that instructors in all situations can and do employ active learning in their courses. However, with the exception of security of employment, trends in the data are consistent with beliefs about the impact of these factors on usage of active learning. We discuss implications of these results for institutional and departmental policies to facilitate the use of active learning."
https://openalex.org/W3129270918,"Knowing how many donkeys there are in specific countries where welfare is compromised is a key concern for targeting efforts to improve donkey welfare. Additionally, accurate population estimates are vital for providing evidence and addressing the impact of population threats. The FAO annually report the number of donkeys and mules in each country. The last paper to investigate global and region trends dates back to 2000 and used FAO data from 1961 to 1997. This paper is an update focusing on global, regional and country level donkey and mule populations to understand if there have been any changes in the trends reported by the previous study between 1997 and 2018. Results show that the general trend identified between 1961 and 1997 is continuing with the number of donkeys globally increasing at a rate of ~1% per annum whilst mule populations are in decline at a rate of ~2% per annum. Results also suggest that the trend identified in the original paper are still evident today with the largest increases in donkey population seen in the sub-Saharan African region and greatest reduction noted in Eastern Europe with these two regions having different socio-economic drivers influencing these changes. These results highlight the multifaceted socio-economic drivers influence changes in donkey and mule populations demonstrating the complexity of designing targeted one-welfare approaches. Whilst the FAO donkey and mule datasets are the best available for understanding spatial-temporal distributions in populations there needs to be greater effort to promote the communication of information from the country level to the FAO. This can be directly supported by NGO’s by promoting the robustness of the FAO process for collating and disseminating this information. NGO’s should also seek to highlight the importance of this information for understanding global regional and country level drivers for equid population changes and potential threats to welfare as well as using this information to facilitate projects that support one-welfare approaches."
https://openalex.org/W3130213149,"The purpose of this work is to provide an effective social distance monitoring solution in low light environments in a pandemic situation. The raging coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has brought a global crisis with its deadly spread all over the world. In the absence of an effective treatment and vaccine the efforts to control this pandemic strictly rely on personal preventive actions, e.g., handwashing, face mask usage, environmental cleaning, and most importantly on social distancing which is the only expedient approach to cope with this situation. Low light environments can become a problem in the spread of disease because of people’s night gatherings. Especially, in summers when the global temperature is at its peak, the situation can become more critical. Mostly, in cities where people have congested homes and no proper air cross-system is available. So, they find ways to get out of their homes with their families during the night to take fresh air. In such a situation, it is necessary to take effective measures to monitor the safety distance criteria to avoid more positive cases and to control the death toll. In this paper, a deep learning-based solution is proposed for the above-stated problem. The proposed framework utilizes the you only look once v4 (YOLO v4) model for real-time object detection and the social distance measuring approach is introduced with a single motionless time of flight (ToF) camera. The risk factor is indicated based on the calculated distance and safety distance violations are highlighted. Experimental results show that the proposed model exhibits good performance with 97.84% mean average precision (mAP) score and the observed mean absolute error (MAE) between actual and measured social distance values is 1.01 cm."
https://openalex.org/W3129241087,"Rapid urban expansion has important health implications. This study examines trends and inequalities in undernutrition and overnutrition by gender, residence (rural, urban slum, urban non-slum), and wealth among children and adults in India. We used National Family Health Survey data from 2006 and 2016 (n = 311,182 children 0-5y and 972,192 adults 15-54y in total). We calculated differences, slope index of inequality (SII) and concentration index to examine changes over time and inequalities in outcomes by gender, residence, and wealth quintile. Between 2006 and 2016, child stunting prevalence dropped from 48% to 38%, with no gender differences in trends, whereas child overweight/obesity remained at ~7–8%. In both years, stunting prevalence was higher in rural and urban slum households compared to urban non-slum households. Within-residence, wealth inequalities were large for stunting (SII: -33 to -19 percentage points, pp) and declined over time only in urban non-slum households. Among adults, underweight prevalence decreased by ~13 pp but overweight/obesity doubled (10% to 21%) between 2006 and 2016. Rises in overweight/obesity among women were greater in rural and urban slum than urban non-slum households. Within-residence, wealth inequalities were large for both underweight (SII -35 to -12pp) and overweight/obesity (+16 to +29pp) for adults, with the former being more concentrated among poorer households and the latter among wealthier households. In conclusion, India experienced a rapid decline in child and adult undernutrition between 2006 and 2016 across genders and areas of residence. Of great concern, however, is the doubling of adult overweight/obesity in all areas during this period and the rise in wealth inequalities in both rural and urban slum households. With the second largest urban population globally, India needs to aggressively tackle the multiple burdens of malnutrition, especially among rural and urban slum households and develop actions to maintain trends in undernutrition reduction without exacerbating the rapidly rising problems of overweight/obesity."
https://openalex.org/W3130044647,"There has been a relative reduction of tobacco consumption between Global Adult Tobacco Survey-India (GATS-India) 2009–10 and GATS-India 2016–17. However, in terms of absolute numbers, India still has the highest number of tobacco consumers. Therefore, this paper aims to examine the socioeconomic correlates and delineate the factors contributing to a change in smoking and smokeless tobacco use from GATS (2009–10) to GATS (2016–17) in India. We used multivariable binary logistic regressions to examine the demographic and socioeconomic correlates of smoking and smokeless tobacco use for both the rounds of the survey. Further decomposition analysis has been applied to examine the specific contribution of factors in the decline of tobacco consumption over a period from 2009 to 2016. Results indicated that the propensity component was primarily responsible for major tobacco consumption decline (smoking- 41%, smokeless tobacco use- 81%). Most of the decrease in propensity to smoke has been explained by residential type and occupation of the respondent. Age of the respondent contribute significantly in reducing the prevalence of smokeless tobacco consumption during the seven-year period, regardless of change in the composition of population. To achieve the National Health Policy, 2017 aim of reducing tobacco use up to 15% by 2020 and up to 30% by 2025, targeted policies and interventions addressing the inequalities identified in this study, must be developed and implemented."
https://openalex.org/W3132423117,"Spatial datasets of building footprint polygons are becoming more widely available and accessible for many areas in the world. These datasets are important inputs for a range of different analyses, such as understanding the development of cities, identifying areas at risk of disasters, and mapping the distribution of populations. The growth of high spatial resolution imagery and computing power is enabling automated procedures to extract and map building footprints for whole countries. These advances are enabling coverage of building footprint datasets for low and middle income countries which might lack other data on urban land uses. While spatially detailed, many building footprints lack information on structure type, local zoning, or land use, limiting their application. However, morphology metrics can be used to describe characteristics of size, shape, spacing, orientation and patterns of the structures and extract additional information which can be correlated with different structure and settlement types or neighbourhoods. We introduce the foot package, a new set of open-source tools in a flexible R package for calculating morphology metrics for building footprints and summarising them in different spatial scales and spatial representations. In particular our tools can create gridded (or raster) representations of morphology summary metrics which have not been widely supported previously. We demonstrate the tools by creating gridded morphology metrics from all building footprints in England, Scotland and Wales, and then use those layers in an unsupervised cluster analysis to derive a pattern-based settlement typology. We compare our mapped settlement types with two existing settlement classifications. The results suggest that building patterns can help distinguish different urban and rural types. However, intra-urban differences were not well-predicted by building morphology alone. More broadly, though, this case study demonstrates the potential of mapping settlement patterns in the absence of a housing census or other urban planning data."
https://openalex.org/W3132980025,"Background Diabetes is one of the most prevalent non-communicable diseases globally, which rapidly is increasing in developing countries. Ethiopia is also facing growing morbidity and mortality related to diabetes complications. Thus, dealing with glycemic control is essential for controlling the development of devastating acute and chronic complications related to diabetes. Therefore, this study aims to assess the magnitude and predictors of poor glycemic control among diabetic patients in western Ethiopia. Methods The cross-sectional study design was employed on a sample of 423 diabetic patients. A systematic random sampling method was employed. An interviewer-administered structured questionnaire was used. The data entered into Epi data version 3.1 and exported into Statistical Package for the Social Sciences window version 24 for analysis. All variables significant at p-&lt;0.25 in bivariate were entered into multivariate analysis. The multivariable logistic regressions were used to determine predictors’ poor glycemic control by considering the Adjusted Odds Ratio at CI 95% and the significance level was set at p &lt;0.05. Results The magnitude of poor glycemic control was 64.1%. Being females (AOR = 1.684,95%CI = 1.066,2.662), duration of diabetes &gt;8years (AOR = 2.552,95%CI = 1.397, 4.665), presence of diabetes complication (AOR = 2.806,95%CI = 1.594,4.941), negligence of blood glucose test at home (AOR = 1.720, 95%CI = 1.078, 2.743), poor self-care behavior (AOR = 1.787, 95%CI = 1.083,2.959) and poor self-efficacy (AOR = 1.934, 95%CI = 1.078,3.469) were significant predictors of poor glycemic control. Conclusion The proportion of poor glycemic control was high which was nearly comparable to that reported from many countries. This could be due to factors that were significantly associated with poor glycemic control like lack of home blood glucose test, increased duration of diabetes, presence of diabetes complications, poor self-efficacy, and poor self-care behaviors. Each were significant independent predictors of poor glycemic control. Thus, we recommend patients with diabetes and health care providers enhancing self-monitoring practices, and preventing potential complications should be a priority concern to improve blood glucose levels. Further studies are also recommended to explore important factors which were not identified by the current study."
https://openalex.org/W3129989893,"Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is the most frequent motor neuron disorder, with a significant social and economic burden. ALS remains incurable, and the only drugs approved for its treatments confers a survival benefit of a few months for the patients. Missense mutations in superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), a major cytoplasmic antioxidant enzyme, has been associated with ALS development, accounting for 23% of its familial cases and 7% of all sporadic cases. This work aims to characterize in silico the structural and functional effects of SOD1 protein variants. Missense mutations in SOD1 were compiled from the literature and databases. Twelve algorithms were used to predict the functional and stability effects of these mutations. ConSurf was used to estimate the evolutionary conservation of SOD1 amino-acids. GROMACS was used to perform molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of SOD1 wild-type and variants A4V, D90A, H46R, and I113T, which account for approximately half of all ALS-SOD1 cases in the United States, Europe, Japan, and United Kingdom, respectively. 233 missense mutations in SOD1 protein were compiled from the databases and literature consulted. The predictive analyses pointed to an elevated rate of deleterious and destabilizing predictions for the analyzed variants, indicating their harmful effects. The ConSurf analysis suggested that mutations in SOD1 mainly affect conserved and possibly functionally essential amino acids. The MD analyses pointed to flexibility and essential dynamics alterations at the electrostatic and metal-binding loops of variants A4V, D90A, H46R, and I113T that could lead to aberrant interactions triggering toxic protein aggregation. These alterations may have harmful implications for SOD1 and explain their association with ALS. Understanding the effects of SOD1 mutations on protein structure and function facilitates the design of further experiments and provides relevant information on the molecular mechanism of pathology, which may contribute to improvements in existing treatments for ALS."
https://openalex.org/W3130235226,"Premature mortality and undernutrition rates in Pakistan are among the highest in the world. Inadequate infant and young child feeding are the major causes of premature mortality and undernutrition. Yet, very little is known about the determinants of complementary feeding practices in Pakistan. Therefore, this study aims to identify the determinants of inadequate complementary feeding practices among children aged 6 to 23 months in Pakistan by using the latest nationally representative data from the Pakistan Demographic and Health Survey (2017–18). The results show that only 12% of children consume a minimum acceptable diet, 21% achieve minimum dietary diversity, and 38% reach minimum meal frequency. Multivariate regression analysis shows that child age, child weight at birth, mother’s access to newspapers/magazines at the individual level, wealth at the household level, and prenatal visits at the community level are significant predictors of complementary feeding practices among children aged 6–23 months in Pakistan. These findings show that, in addition to poverty alleviation, raising awareness through health practitioners, increasing access to media, and expanding access to child and maternal healthcare can improve complementary feeding practices in Pakistan. This consequently reduces premature mortality and undernutrition."
https://openalex.org/W3130743775,"Background Understanding patients’ trust in health information sources is critical to designing work systems in healthcare. Patient-centered communication during the visit might be a major factor in shaping patients’ trust in information sources. Objective The purpose of this paper is to explore relationships between patient ratings of clinician communication during the visit and patient trust in health information sources. Methodology We conducted a secondary analysis of the nationally-representative Health Information National Trends Surveys; HINTS4 Cycle1 (2011), HINTS4 Cycle4 (2014), and HINTS5 Cycle1 (2017), and HINTS5 Cycle2 (2018). We created a composite score of patient-centered communication from five questions and dichotomized at the median. We created multivariable logistic regression models to see how patient-centered communication influenced trust in different information sources across cycles. Consecutively, we used hierarchical analysis for aggregated data. Results We analyzed data from 14,425 individuals. In the adjusted logistic models for each cycle and the hierarchical model, clinicians’ perceived patient-centered communication skills were significantly associated with increased trust in the clinicians as an information source. Conclusion Clinicians still represent an essential source of trustworthy information reinforced by patient-centered communication skills. Given that trust helps build healing relationships that lead to better healthcare outcomes, communication sets an essential foundation to establish necessary trust. Interpreting information from the internet sources for patients is likely to remain a vital clinician function."
https://openalex.org/W3133263908,"The exploitation of petroleum oil generates a considerable amount of “produced water or petroleum waste effluent (PWE)” that is contaminated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), including Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP). PWE is characterised by its high salinity, which can be as high as 30% NaCl, thus the exploitation of biodegradation to remove PAHs necessitates the use of active halophilic microbes. The strain 10SBZ1A was isolated from oil contaminated soils, by enrichment experiment in medium containing 10% NaCl (w/v). Homology analyses of 16S rRNA sequences identified 10SBZ1A as a Staphylococcus haemoliticus species, based on 99.99% homology ( NCBI , accession number GI : MN388897 ). The strain could grow in the presence of 4–200 μmol l -1 of BaP as the sole source of carbon, with a doubling time of 17–42 h. This strain optimum conditions for growth were 37 o C, 10% NaCl (w/v) and pH 7, and under these conditions, it degraded BaP at a rate of 0.8 μmol l -1 per day. The strain 10SBZ1A actively degraded PAHs of lower molecular weights than that of BaP, including pyrene, phenanthrene, anthracene. This strain was also capable of removing 80% of BaP in the context of soil spiked with BaP (10 μmol l -1 in 100 g of soil) within 30 days. Finally, a metabolic pathway of BaP was proposed, based on the identified metabolites using liquid chromatography-high resolution tandem mass spectrometry. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a halophilic BaP degrading bacterial strain at salinity &gt; 5% NaCl."
https://openalex.org/W3130650620,"Phosphate-solubilizing bacteria (PSB) have beneficial effects on plant health and soil composition. To date, studies of PSB in soil have largely been performed under field or greenhouse conditions. However, less is known about the impact of introducing indigenous PSB in the field, including their effects on the local microbial community. In this study, we conducted greenhouse and field experiments to explore the effects of the addition of indigenous PSB on the growth of Chenmou elm ( Ulmus chenmoui ) and on the diversity and composition of the bacterial community in the soil. We obtained four bacterial isolates with the highest phosphate-solubilizing activity: UC_1 ( Pseudomonas sp.), UC_M ( Klebsiella sp.), UC_J ( Burkholderia sp.), and UC_3 ( Chryseobacterium sp.). Sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq platform showed that the inoculated PSB did not become the dominant strains in the U . chenmoui rhizosphere. However, the soil bacterial community structure was altered by the addition of these PSB. The relative abundance of Chloroflexi decreased significantly in response to PSB application in all treatment groups, whereas the populations of several bacteria, including Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes , increased. Network analysis indicated that Chloroflexi was the most strongly negatively correlated with Proteobacteria , whereas Proteobacteria was strongly positively correlated with Bacteroidetes . Our findings indicate that inoculation with PSB (UC_1, UC_M, UC_J, and UC_3) can improve the growth of U . chenmoui and regulate its rhizosphere microbial community. Therefore, inoculation with these bacterial strains could promote the efficient cultivation and production of high-quality plant materials."
https://openalex.org/W3130011572,"Inadequate menstrual hygiene management (MHM) practices have been associated with adverse health outcomes. This study aimed to describe MHM practices among schoolgirls from rural Gambia and assess risk factors associated with urogenital infections and depressive symptoms. A cross-sectional study was conducted among adolescent schoolgirls in thirteen schools in rural Gambia. A questionnaire was used to collect information on socio-demographics, MHM practices and clinical symptoms of reproductive and urinary tract infections (UTIs). A modified Beck Depression Inventory-II was used to screen for depressive symptoms. Mid-stream urine samples were collected to assess for UTIs. Modified Poisson regression analysis was used to determine risk factors for symptoms of urogenital infections and depression among adolescent girls. Three hundred and fifty-eight girls were recruited. Although, 63% of the girls attended schools providing free disposable pads, reusable cloths/towels were the commonest absorbent materials used. Heavy menstrual bleeding was associated with depressive symptoms (adjusted prevalence ratio, aPR 1.4 [95% CI 1.0, 1.9]), while extreme menstrual pain (aPR 1.3 [95% CI 1.2, 1,4]), accessing sanitary pads in school (aPR 1.4 [95% CI 1.2, 1.5]) and less access to functional water source at school (aPR 1.4 [95% CI 1.3, 1.6]) were associated with UTI symptoms. Conversely, privacy in school toilets (aPR 0.6 [95% CI 0.5, 0.7]) was protective for UTI symptoms. Heavy menstrual bleeding (aPR 1.4 [95% CI 1.1, 2.0]) and taking &lt;30 minutes to collect water at home were associated with RTI symptoms (aPR 1.2 [95% CI 1.0, 1.5]) while availability of soap in school toilets (aPR 0.6 [95% CI 0.5, 0.8] was protective for RTI symptoms. Interventions to ensure that schoolgirls have access to private sanitation facilities with water and soap both at school and at home could reduce UTI and RTI symptoms. More attention is also needed to support girls with heavy menstrual bleeding and pain symptoms."
https://openalex.org/W3131411906,"Introduction Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is effective in reducing HIV transmission among key populations. In India, where PrEP is not currently part of the national HIV program, little is known about PrEP awareness, willingness to use PrEP, and barriers to uptake among people who inject drugs (PWID) and men who have sex with men (MSM). Methods We used respondent-driven sampling to accrue PWID and MSM in 22 sites from August 2016 to May 2017. Participants were asked about awareness of PrEP, willingness to use PrEP (following a brief description) and reasons why they might not be willing to use PrEP. Participants were also queried on preferences for PrEP delivery modality (oral vs. injectable). Multi-level logistic regression models were used to determine participant correlates of willingness to use PrEP. Estimates were weighted for the sampling method. Results A total of 10,538 PWID and 8,621 MSM who self-reported being HIV-negative were included in the analysis. Only 6.1% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.9, 6.3) of PWID and 8.0% of MSM (95% CI: 7.7, 8.4) were aware of PrEP. However, willingness to use PrEP was substantially higher in both groups: 52.4% of PWID and 67.6% of MSM. Participants commonly cited a perceived low risk for acquiring HIV infection, being perceived by others as being HIV-positive, and side effects as reasons why they would be unwilling to use PrEP. Among PWID, sharing needles and hazardous alcohol use were associated with increased willingness to use PrEP. Among MSM, having a main male partner and injection drug use were associated with increased willingness to use PrEP. Preference for daily oral or monthly injectable PrEP was similar among MSM (39.6%% vs. 41.7%,), while PWID were more likely to prefer oral to injectable administration routes (56.3% vs. 31.1%). Conclusions As India plans to roll-out of PrEP in the public sector, our multi-city survey of PWID and MSM highlights the need for key population-focused education campaigns about PrEP and self-assessment of risk."
https://openalex.org/W3133136431,"Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) cause mild to severe respiratory infection. Most of the common cold illnesses are caused by one of four HCoVs, namely HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43. Several studies have applied global transcriptomic methods to understand host responses to HCoV infection, with most studies focusing on the pandemic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) and the newly emerging SARS-CoV-2. In this study, Next Generation Sequencing was used to gain new insights into cellular transcriptomic changes elicited by alphacoronavirus HCoV-229E. HCoV-229E-infected MRC-5 cells showed marked downregulation of superpathway of cholesterol biosynthesis and eIF2 signaling pathways. Moreover, upregulation of cyclins, cell cycle control of chromosomal replication, and the role of BRCA1 in DNA damage response, alongside downregulation of the cell cycle G1/S checkpoint, suggest that HCoV-229E may favors S phase for viral infection. Intriguingly, a significant portion of key factors of cell innate immunity, interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and other transcripts of early antiviral response genes were downregulated early in HCoV-229E infection. On the other hand, early upregulation of the antiviral response factor Apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme catalytic subunit 3 B (APOBEC3B) was observed. APOBEC3B cytidine deaminase signature (C-to-T) was previously observed in genomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 but not HCoV-229E. Higher levels of C-to-T mutations were found in countries with high mortality rates caused by SARS-CoV-2. APOBEC activity could be a marker for new emerging CoVs. This study will enhance our understanding of commonly circulating HCoVs and hopefully provide critical information about still-emerging coronaviruses."
https://openalex.org/W3132014031,"The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of ankle and hip muscle fatigue on motor adjustments (experiment 1) and symmetry (experiment 2) of postural control during a quiet standing task. Twenty-three young adults performed a bipedal postural task on separate force platforms, before and after a bilateral ankle and hip muscle fatigue protocol (randomized). Ankle and hip muscles were fatigued separately using a standing calf raise protocol (ankle fatigue) on a step and flexion and extension of the hip (hip fatigue) sitting on a chair, at a controlled movement frequency (0.5Hz), respectively. In both experiments, force, center of pressure, and electromyography parameters were measured. The symmetry index was used in experiment 2 to analyze the postural asymmetry in the parameters. Our main findings showed that muscle fatigue impaired postural stability, regardless of the fatigued muscle region (i.e., ankle or hip). In addition, young adults used an ankle motor strategy (experiment 1) before and after both the ankle and hip muscle fatigue protocols. Moreover, we found increased asymmetry between the lower limbs (experiment 2) during the quiet standing task after muscle fatigue. Thus, we can conclude that the postural motor strategy is not muscle fatigue joint-dependent and a fatigue task increases postural asymmetry, regardless of the fatigued region (hip or ankle). These findings could be applied in sports training and rehabilitation programs with the objective of reducing the fatigue effects on asymmetry and improving balance."
https://openalex.org/W3131268576,"Background Early childhood dental caries (ECC), a serious public health problem lacks information on the association between ECC, risk factors and nutritional status among children in Tanzania. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the prevalence of ECC, risk factors and nutritional status among 3-5-year-old preschool children and to assess its correlation with the form, visible plaque scores in upper anterior teeth, total sugar exposure, anthropometric measures, and socio demographic attributes. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted on 831 children registered in public preschools in Kisarawe District. Assessment of ECC used the WHO (2013) criteria and anthropometric measures used the WHO Child Growth Standards (2006). Structured questionnaires were completed by children’s parents through an interview. Collected information on socio-demographic attributes including oral hygiene and sugar exposure to their children was analyzed. Results Only 459 children (55.2%) were recognized as caries-free. Dental caries experience in terms of decayed, missing and filled teeth (dmft) index was 2.51. Children with visible plaque were the majority (56.1%). The dmft score index was negatively and significantly associated with weight-for-age z-score [Coefficient: -0.11 (95% CI: -0.76, -0.11)] and positively significantly associated with visible plaque score index [Coefficient: 0.16 (95% CI: 0.18, 0.52)] and total sugar exposure [Coefficient: 0.19 (95% CI: 0.15, 0.38)] in the adjusted model. The prevalence of underweight was 4.2% [95% CI: (3.0–5.8)] and severe underweight was 0.2% [95% CI: (0.1–0.9)] while prevalence of stunting was 1.6% [95% CI: (0.9–2.7)] and severe stunting was 0.4% [95% CI: (0.1–1.1)]. Conclusion This study demonstrated a significant negative relationship between ECC and children’s anthropometric measures indicated by weight-for-age, and positive relationship with sugar exposure and poor oral hygiene indicated by visible plaque on upper anterior teeth. Controlling risk factors will reduce the occurrence of ECC thereby catering for a healthy population of well-nourished children."
https://openalex.org/W3131625146,"Introduction The work environment of healthcare professionals is important for good patient care and is receiving increasing attention in scientific research. A clear and unambiguous understanding of a positive work environment, as perceived by healthcare professionals, is crucial for gaining systematic objective insights into the work environment. The aim of this study was to gain consensus on the concept of a positive work environment in the hospital. Methods This was a three-round Delphi study to establish consensus on what defines a positive work environment. A literature review and 17 semi-structured interviews with experts (transcribed and analyzed by open and thematic coding) were used to generate items for the Delphi study. Results The literature review revealed 228 aspects that were clustered into 48 work environment elements, 38 of which were mentioned in the interviews also. After three Delphi rounds, 36 elements were regarded as belonging to a positive work environment in the hospital. Discussion The work environment is a broad concept with several perspectives. Although all 36 elements are considered important for a positive work environment, they have different perspectives. Mapping the included elements revealed that no one work environment measurement tool includes all the elements. Conclusion We identified 36 elements that are important for a positive work environment. This knowledge can be used to select the right measurement tool or to develop interventions for improving the work environment. However, the different perspectives of the work environment should be considered."
https://openalex.org/W3131212268,"The aim of the study is to evaluate the progression of visual field (VF) defects over 16 years of observation and to assess abnormalities in vessels and retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) thickness in patients with optic disc drusen (ODD). Both static automated perimetry (SAP) and semi-automated kinetic perimetry (SKP) were performed in 16 eyes of 8 patients (mean age 54 years) with ODD among 26 eyes of 13 patients examined 16 years before. The area of I2e, I4e, III4e, and V4e isopters was measured in deg 2 . The MD and PSD parameters were estimated using SAP. Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A) was additionally performed in 16 ODD eyes and 16 eyes of 8 healthy subjects to estimate the RNFL thickness and vessel density of the optic nerve disc and the macula. The differences in all isopter areas of SKP and SAP parameters after 16 years were not significant. The analysis of OCT-A showed a significant reduction of the vessel density and RNFL of the peripapillary area in each segment in patients with ODD, compared with the control group. The highest reduction of RNFL was observed in the superior segment of the optic disc area (92.56μm vs 126.63μm) also the macular thickness was decreased in ODD patients, compared with the control group. In the macula, there was a significant vascular defect in the whole superficial layer and in the parafoveal deep layer. A strong significant correlation of the parafoveal deep plexus with MD and PSD parameters was detected. In conclusion, VF loss due to ODD after 16 years of the follow-up was not significant both in SKP and SAP. ODD caused a reduced vessel density and RNFL, as well as macular thickness in OCT-A. SAP parameters were influenced by parafoveal deep plexus."

We assessed HIV incidence and its correlates among MSM and TGW in SSA enrolled in the prospective, multi-country HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN) 075 study, conducted from 2015 to 2017. Participants were enrolled at four sites in SSA (Kisumu, Kenya; Blantyre, Malawi; Cape Town and Soweto, South Africa). Eligible participants reported male sex assignment at birth, were 18 to 44 years of age, and had engaged in anal intercourse with a man in the preceding three months. Participation involved five study visits over 12 months. Visits included behavioral assessments and testing for HIV and sexually transmitted infections. Twenty-one of 329 persons acquired HIV during the study [incidence rate: 6.96/100 person-years (PY) (95% CI: 4.3, 10.6)]. Among TGW, HIV incidence was estimated to be 8.4/100 PY (95% CI: 2.3, 21.5). Four participants were found to have acute HIV infection at their first HIV-positive visit. HIV incidence varied among the four study sites, ranging from 1.3/100 PY to 14.4/100 PY. In multivariate longitudinal analysis, factors significantly associated with HIV acquisition were engagement in unprotected receptive anal intercourse [adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) 5.8, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.4, 14.4] and incident rectal gonorrhea and/or chlamydia (AHR: 2.7, 95% CI: 1.1, 6.8). The higher HIV incidence in Cape Town compared to Blantyre could be explained by the higher prevalence of several risk factors for HIV infection among participants in Cape Town. Annual HIV incidence observed in this study is substantially higher than reported HIV incidence in the general populations in the respective countries and among MSM in the United States. Intensification of HIV prevention efforts for MSM and TGW in SSA is urgently needed."
https://openalex.org/W3132809098,"Background Effective management of the vaccine cold chain system at all levels is one of the crucial factors for maintaining vaccine potency. Vaccines require more complex handling and storage requirements due to increased temperature sensitivity and complicated immunization schedules. This urges adequate knowledge, attitude, and practice. This study assessed the knowledge, attitude, and practice of vaccinators and vaccine handlers’ in public health facilities. Methodology An institutional-based cross-sectional study design was used to assess the knowledge, attitude, and practice of 127 vaccinators and vaccine handlers in public health facilities of Oromia Special Zone, from September 1 to 30, 2019. Data were collected using self-administered questionnaires and a structured observation checklist. Descriptive and inferential statistics were made using the statistical package for social sciences version 20. Variables with a p-value &lt;0.05 were taken as statistically significant. Result The response rate was (96.94%). Sixty-eight (53.5%; 95% CI: 46.5%, 61.4%), 58 (45.7%; 95% CI: 37.8%, 53.5%) and 62 (48.8%: 95% CI; 41.7%, 56.7%) vaccinators and vaccine handlers had satisfactory knowledge, positive attitude and good practice respectively. Receiving training on cold chain management had a statistically significant association with the level of knowledge on cold chain management (AOR = 3.04, 95% CI: 1.04–8.88). Conclusions More than half of vaccinators and vaccine handlers had satisfactory knowledge, while below half of vaccinators and vaccine handlers had a positive attitude and good practice. The determinants of knowledge in cold chain management were receiving training on cold chain management. Providing regular technical support and on the job training on vaccine cold chain management will improve the knowledge, attitude, and practice of vaccinators and vaccine handlers."
https://openalex.org/W3131188573,"Background Although hypertension, the largest modifiable risk factor in the global burden of disease, is prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa, rates of awareness and control are low. Since 2011 village health workers (VHWs) in Kisoro district, Uganda have been providing non-communicable disease (NCD) care as part of the Chronic Disease in the Community (CDCom) Program. The VHWs screen for hypertension and other NCDs as part of a door-to-door biannual health census, and, under the supervision of health professionals from the local district hospital, also serve as the primary providers at monthly village-based NCD clinics. Objective/Methods We describe the operation of CDCom, a 10-year comprehensive program employing VHWs to screen and manage hypertension and other NCDs at a community level. Using program records we also report hypertension prevalence in the community, program costs, and results of a cost-saving strategy to address frequent medication stockouts. Results/Conclusions Of 4283 people ages 30–69 screened for hypertension, 22% had a blood pressure (BP) ≥ 140/90 and 5% had a BP ≥ 160/100. All 163 people with SBP ≥ 170 during door-to-door screening were referred for evaluation in CDCom, of which 91 (59%) had repeated BP ≥ 170 and were enrolled in treatment. Of 761 patients enrolled in CDCom, 413 patients are being treated for hypertension and 68% of these had their most recent blood pressure below the treatment target. We find: 1) The difference in hypertension prevalence between this rural, agricultural population and national rates mirrors a rural-urban divide in many countries in sub-Saharan Africa. 2) VHWs are able to not only screen patients for hypertension, but also to manage their disease in monthly village-based clinics. 3) Mid-level providers at a local district hospital NCD clinic and faculty from an academic center provide institutional support to VHWs, stream-line referrals for complicated patients and facilitate provider education at all levels of care. 4) Selective stepdown of medication doses for patients with controlled hypertension is a safe, cost-saving strategy that partially addresses frequent stockouts of government-supplied medications and patient inability to pay. 5) CDCom, free for village members, operates at a modest cost of 0.20 USD per villager per year. We expect that our data-informed analysis of the program will benefit other groups attempting to decentralize chronic disease care in rural communities of low-income regions worldwide."
https://openalex.org/W3131515745,"Background The Chinese government’s early handling of COVID-19 has been perceived as aggressive and oppressive. Many of the most radical measures were adopted in Henan province, immediately north of Hubei, the pandemic’s epicentre in China. However, little is known about how rural residents—a group systematically disadvantaged in Chinese society—responded to authorities’ draconian restrictions. Methods To understand the lockdown measures and rural community responses at the grassroots level, face-to-face interviewers were conducted with both village cadres and villagers from two Henan villages in May and June 2020. The interviews were analysed with qualitative content analysis methods, with the coding process guided by the concepts of resilience, vulnerability and adaptability from the literature on disaster risk reduction. Results We found that the lockdown measures were indeed radical and disproportionate relative to the level of risk presented; however, they were largely accepted by villagers. This contradiction can be explained by two key contributing factors: (i) shared interests of individual villagers and the converged goal of government and civil society, and (ii) tacit flexibility in COVID-19 adaption strategies to tackle conflict resulting from goal diversion between citizens and local governments. Conclusions These findings highlight the nuances of ground-level politics. Despite their ‘radical’ nature, the lockdown measures were not implemented as simple top-down coercion. Instead, they involved, importantly, the bottom-up, localised response of villagers, and they were negotiated and adapted according to local circumstances."
https://openalex.org/W3132497941,"The analysis and simulation of the interactions that occur in group situations is important when humans and artificial agents, physical or virtual, must coordinate when inhabiting similar spaces or even collaborate, as in the case of human-robot teams. Artificial systems should adapt to the natural interfaces of humans rather than the other way around. Such systems should be sensitive to human behaviors, which are often social in nature, and account for human capabilities when planning their own behaviors. A limiting factor relates to our understanding of how humans behave with respect to each other and with artificial embodiments, such as robots. To this end, we present CongreG8 (pronounced ‘con-gre-gate’), a novel dataset containing the full-body motions of free-standing conversational groups of three humans and a newcomer that approaches the groups with the intent of joining them. The aim has been to collect an accurate and detailed set of positioning, orienting and full-body behaviors when a newcomer approaches and joins a small group. The dataset contains trials from human and robot newcomers. Additionally, it includes questionnaires about the personality of participants (BFI-10), their perception of robots (Godspeed), and custom human/robot interaction questions. An overview and analysis of the dataset is also provided, which suggests that human groups are more likely to alter their configuration to accommodate a human newcomer than a robot newcomer. We conclude by providing three use cases that the dataset has already been applied to in the domains of behavior detection and generation in real and virtual environments. A sample of the CongreG8 dataset is available at https://zenodo.org/record/4537811 ."
https://openalex.org/W3130930727,"Silver nanoparticle (Ag-NP) is well known for its high antibacterial efficacy. However, its toxicity toward mammalian cells is still a concern in clinical applications. The aim of our study was to evaluate the composition effects of Ag-NP supported by silicate nanoplatelet (NSP) with respect to the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity, and was in reference to the poly (styrene-co-maleic anhydride)-supported Ag-NP (Ag-NP/SMA). The NSP at the geometric dimension of averaged 80 x 80 x 1 nm 3 was prepared from the exfoliation of natural clays and used to support different weight ratio of Ag-NP. The supporting limitation of NSP on Ag-NP was below the weight ratio of 15/85 (Ag-NP to NSP), and the detached Ag-NP from the Ag-NP/NSP (30/70) and Ag-NP/SMA hybrids were observed by TEM. Ames test was performed to assess the mutagenic potential of different compositions of Ag-NP/NSP, only Ag-NP/NSP (30/70) and Ag-NP/SMA hybrids exhibited mutagenicity when the concentration was 1.09 ppm or higher. In viewing of cytotoxicity using MTT tests toward HaCaT cells, the IC30 of Ag-NP/NSP (1/99, 7/93 and 15/85) were 1416.7, 243.6, and 148.9 ppm respectively, while Ag-NP/SMA was 64.8 ppm. The IC30 of Ag-NP/NSP (1/99, 7/93 and 15/85) were at least 833, 78 and 7 folds higher than their corresponding minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) respectively, and whereas Ag-NP/SMA was 6.4 folds. The Ag-NP/NSP and Ag-NP/SMA hybrids had been further investigated for genotoxicity by chromosomal aberrations and in vivo micronucleus assay within the concentration at IC10 and IC30, only Ag-NP/SMA showed a higher frequency of chromosomal aberrations. Our findings indicated that the viability of utilizing the NSP to maintain Ag-NP for antimicrobial activity, and the high-surface area of NSP served as an excellent support for associating Ag-NP and consequently rendering the mitigation of the inherent toxicity of Ag-NP in clinical uses."
https://openalex.org/W3131846357,"Central venous catheters are widely used in haemodialysis therapy, having to respect design requirements for appropriate performance. These are placed within the right atrium (RA); however, there is no prior computational study assessing different catheter designs while mimicking their native environment. Here, a computational fluid dynamics model of the RA, based on realistic geometry and transient physiological boundary conditions, was developed and validated. Symmetric, split and step catheter designs were virtually placed in the RA and their performance was evaluated by: assessing their interaction with the RA haemodynamic environment through prediction of flow vorticity and wall shear stress (WSS) magnitudes (1); and quantifying recirculation and tip shear stress (2). Haemodynamic predictions from our RA model showed good agreement with the literature. Catheter placement in the RA increased average vorticity, which could indicate alterations of normal blood flow, and altered WSS magnitudes and distribution, which could indicate changes in tissue mechanical properties. All designs had recirculation and elevated shear stress values, which can induce platelet activation and subsequently thrombosis. The symmetric design, however, had the lowest associated values (best performance), while step design catheters working in reverse mode were associated with worsened performance. Different tip placements also impacted on catheter performance. Our findings suggest that using a realistically anatomical RA model to study catheter performance and interaction with the haemodynamic environment is crucial, and that care needs to be given to correct tip placement within the RA for improved recirculation percentages and diminished shear stress values."
https://openalex.org/W3132085687,"Objectives In Jang-jeom, a small village in Hamra-myeon, Iksan-si, Jeollabuk-do, South Korea, residents raised concerns about a suspected cancer cluster that they attributed to a fertilizer plant near the village. We aimed to investigate whether the cancer incidence in the village was higher than that in the general Korean population when the factory was in operation (2001–2017) and whether living in the village was associated with a higher risk of cancer. Methods Using national population data and cancer registration data of South Korea, we estimated the standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) in the village to investigate whether more cancer cases occurred in the village compared to other regions. The SIRs were standardized by age groups of 5 years and sex. In order to investigate whether residence in the village increased the risk of cancer, a retrospective cohort was constructed using National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) databases. We estimated the cancer hazard ratios (HRs) using the Cox proportional hazard model, and defined the exposed area as the village of Jang-jeom, and the unexposed or control area as the village neighborhood in Hamra-myeon. We considered potential confounding variables such as age, sex, and income index in the models. Additionally, we measured polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and tobacco-specific nitrosamines (TSNAs), suspected carcinogens that may have caused the cancer cluster, in samples collected from the plant and the village. Results Twenty-three cancer cases occurred in Jang-jeom from 2001 to 2017. Between 2010 and 2016, the incidence rates of all cancers (SIR: 2.05, except thyroid cancer: 2.22), non-melanoma skin cancer (SIR: 21.14, female: 25.41), and gallbladder (GB) and biliary tract cancer in men (SIR: 16.01) in the village were higher than those in the national population in a way that was statistically significant. In our cohort analysis that included only Hamra-myeon residents who have lived there for more than 7 years, we found a statistically significant increase in the risk of all cancers (HR: 1.99, except thyroid cancer: 2.20), non-melanoma skin cancer (HR: 11.60), GB and biliary tract cancer (HR: 15.24), liver cancer (HR: 6.63), and gastric cancer (HR: 3.29) for Jang-jeom residents compared to other Hamra area residents. We identified PAHs and TSNAs in samples of deposited dust and residual fertilizer from the plant and TSNAs in dust samples from village houses. Conclusions The results of the SIR calculation and cancer risk analyses of Jang-jeom village residents from the retrospective cohort design showed consistency in the effect size and direction, suggesting that there was a cancer cluster in Jang-jeom. This study would be a good precedent for cancer cluster investigation."
https://openalex.org/W3133159409,"The dairy industry in Senegal is growing and evolving against a backdrop of rapid urbanisation and increasing consumer demand for dairy products. Consideration of appropriate cattle healthcare delivery and disease control in these evolving farming systems is of paramount importance given the risks posed by zoonotic pathogens and the economic consequences of disease for livestock keepers. Planning and implementation of disease control and healthcare delivery generally follows a top down approach. Often this does not take into account the views and perceptions of the farmers it impacts and who must behave in the expected way for successful outcomes to materialise. In this study, we asked 76 farmers to discuss their experience and opinions of farming milk producing cattle in 11 focus group discussions conducted in two peri-urban areas of Senegal. The objectives were to investigate farmers’ perceptions of the current conditions in farming, to understand how these might impact the future direction of this particular system and how this might affect the feasibility and appropriate methods of cattle healthcare delivery and disease control. The data collected were subjected to thematic analysis and four themes were identified; 1. Revered cattle, 2. The changing face of livestock keeping, 3. Powerlessness, 4. Optimism for the future. Farmers in our study had a deep affinity with their cattle, they respected the traditions surrounding cattle keeping at the same time as striving for advances within the system and their animal’s productivity. Within strong social groupings and hierarchical structures they recognised the inherent challenges they face but were hopeful and optimistic about growth and opportunity in the future of milk production. A holistic approach to embedding healthcare delivery and disease control within the broader context in which farmers operate may prove successful. This could involve consideration of funding channels for farmers, access to appropriate inputs and utilising the strong community spirit and social norms of farmers to initiate and facilitate change."
https://openalex.org/W3129373833,"Sugi ( Cryptomeria japonica D. Don) is an important conifer used for afforestation in Japan. As the genome of this species is 11 Gbps, it is too large to assemble within a short timeframe. Transcriptomics is one approach that can address this deficiency. Here we designed a workflow consisting of three stages to de novo assemble transcriptome using Oases and Trinity. The three transcriptomic stage used were independent assembly, automatic and semi-manual integration, and refinement by filtering out potential contamination. We identified a set of 49,795 cDNA and an equal number of translated proteins. According to the benchmark set by BUSCO, 87.01% of cDNAs identified were complete genes, and 78.47% were complete and single-copy genes. Compared to other full-length cDNA resources collected by Sanger and PacBio sequencers, the extent of the coverage in our dataset was the highest, indicating that these data can be safely used for further studies. When two tissue-specific libraries were compared, there were significant expression differences between male strobili and leaf and bark sets. Moreover, subtle expression difference between male-fertile and sterile libraries were detected. Orthologous genes from other model plants and conifer species were identified. We demonstrated that our transcriptome assembly output (CJ3006NRE) can serve as a reference transcriptome for future functional genomics and evolutionary biology studies."
https://openalex.org/W3132049219,"Objective To find preoperative screening criteria for dry eye syndrome (DES) that present after successful endoscopic dacryocystorhinostomy (EDCR). Methods We retrospectively analyzed medical records of 110 patients who underwent EDCR for nasolacrimal duct obstruction. DES diagnostic criteria were defined as tear break-up time (TBUT) less than 10 seconds, and ocular surface disease index (OSDI) score greater than 13 points. After EDCR, patients were divided into DES group and control group according to the DES diagnostic criteria. Preoperative OSDI score alone or in combination of preoperative TBUT and OSDI score were used to find screening criteria, which could discriminate the two groups preoperatively with a high positive predictive value (PPV). Criteria A was set same as the diagnostic criteria of DES, and Criteria B and C were set to improve PPV by increasing specificity while maintaining similar sensitivity to Criteria A. Results Thirty patients (27.3%) were diagnosed with DES after EDCR, while 80 patients (72.7%) were normal. In patients with DES, preoperative TBUT was not different (p = 0.851), but OSDI score was significantly higher (p&lt;0.001). Criteria A showed a sensitivity of 73.3%, specificity of 55.0%, and PPV of 38.0%. Criteria B and C excluded preoperative TBUT, which had no difference between the two groups, and set screening criteria with preoperative OSDI score alone. Criteria B (preoperative OSDI score of 19.6 points or more) showed a sensitivity of 75.0%, specificity of 60.6%, PPV of 41.7% and AUC of 0.739 (p &lt; 0.001). Criteria C was consisted of 5 out of 12 OSDI items that showed significant differences between the two groups; blurred vision, reading, working with a computer, low humidity, and air conditioning. Criteria C (preoperative 5-item OSDI score of 24.4 points or more) was a better predictability, with a sensitivity of 75.0%, specificity of 71.3%, PPV of 49.5%, and AUC of 0.804 (p &lt; 0.001). The AUC of Criteria C was significantly higher than that of Criteria B (p = 0.0037). Conclusion DES occurred after successful EDCR in 27.3% of patients, and an OSDI questionnaire helped to screen DES. The predictability could improve using the modified OSDI score which showed noticeable difference in five OSDI items before and after EDCR."
https://openalex.org/W3132952713,"The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of diet crude protein (CP) content and metabolisable energy (ME) intake on skeletal growth and associated parameters of growing steers prior to and during compensatory growth in weight and catch-up growth in skeletal elongation. The experiment was a factorial design with two cattle genotypes [Brahman crossbred (BX, 178 ± 6 kg) and Holstein-Friesian (HF, 230 ± 34 kg)] and three nutritional treatments; high CP content and high ME intake (HCP-HME), high CP content and low ME intake (HCP-LME) and low CP content and low ME intake (LCP-LME) with the ME intake of HCP-LME matched to that of LCP-LME. Nutritional treatments were imposed over a 103 d period (Phase 1), and after this, all steers were offered ad libitum access to the HCP-HME nutritional treatment for 100 d (Phase 2). Steers fed the high CP content treatment with a low ME intake, showed higher hip height gain ( P = 0.04), larger terminal hypertrophic chondrocytes ( P = 0.02) and a higher concentration of total triiodothyronine in plasma ( P = 0.01) than steers with the same ME intake of the low CP content treatment. In addition, the low CP treatment resulted in significant decreases in bone volume ( P = 0.03), bone surface area ( P = 0.03) and the concentration of bone-specific alkaline phosphatase in plasma ( P &lt; 0.001) compared to steers fed the HCP-HME treatment. A significant interaction between genotype and nutritional treatment existed for the concentration of thyroxine (T4) in plasma where HF steers fed LCP-LME had a lower T4 concentration in plasma ( P = 0.05) than BX steers. All steers with a restricted ME intake during Phase 1 demonstrated compensatory growth during Phase 2. However, HF steers fed the LCP treatment during Phase 1 showed a tendency ( P = 0.07) for a greater LWG during Phase 2 without any increase in dry matter intake. Results observed at the growth plate and hip height growth suggest that catch-up growth in cattle may also be explained by the growth plate senescence hypothesis. Contrary to our initial hypothesis, the results demonstrate that greater CP intake during ME restriction does not increase compensatory gain in cattle during re-alimentation."
https://openalex.org/W3133186380,"The suppression of distracting information in order to focus on an actual cognitive goal is a key feature of executive functions. The use of brain imaging methods to investigate the underlying neurobiological brain activations that occur during conflict processing have demonstrated a strong involvement of the fronto-parietal attention network (FPAN). Surprisingly, the directional interconnections, their time courses and activations at different frequency bands remain to be elucidated, and thus, this constitutes the focus of this study. The shared information flow between brain areas of the FPAN is provided for frequency bands ranging from the theta to the lower gamma band (4–40 Hz). We employed an adaptation of the Simon task utilizing Magnetoencephalography (MEG). Granger causality was applied to investigate interconnections between the active brain regions, as well as their directionality. Following stimulus onset, the middle frontal precentral cortex and superior parietal cortex were significantly activated during conflict processing in a time window of between 300 to 600ms. Important differences in causality were found across frequency bands between processing of conflicting stimuli in the left as compared to the right visual hemifield. The exchange of information from and to the FPAN was most prominent in the beta band. Moreover, the anterior cingulate cortex and the anterior insula represented key areas for conflict monitoring, either by receiving input from other areas of the FPAN or by generating output themselves. This indicates that the salience network is at least partly involved in processing conflict information. The present study provides detailed insights into the underlying neural mechanisms of the FPAN, especially regarding its temporal characteristics and directional interconnections."
https://openalex.org/W3133394611,"The gene SON is on human chromosome 21 (21q22.11) and is thought to be associated with hematopoietic disorders that accompany Down syndrome. Additionally, SON is an RNA splicing factor that plays a role in the transcription of leukemia-associated genes. Previously, we showed that mutations in SON cause malformations in human and zebrafish spines and brains during early embryonic development. To examine the role of SON in normal hematopoiesis, we reduced expression of the zebrafish homolog of SON in zebrafish at the single-cell developmental stage with specific morpholinos. In addition to the brain and spinal malformations we also observed abnormal blood cell levels upon son knockdown. We then investigated how blood production was altered when levels of son were reduced. Decreased levels of son resulted in lower amounts of red blood cells when visualized with lcr :GFP transgenic fish. There were also reduced thrombocytes seen with cd41 :GFP fish, and myeloid cells when mpx :GFP fish were examined. We also observed a significant decrease in the quantity of T cells, visualized with lck :GFP fish. However, when we examined their hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), we saw no difference in colony-forming capability. These studies indicate that son is essential for the proper differentiation of the innate and adaptive immune system, and further investigation determining the molecular pathways involved during blood development should elucidate important information about vertebrate HSPC generation, proliferation, and differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W3129428902,"Animal carcasses are often brought into tidal flats where they are at the boundary between terrestrial and marine ecosystems. Since these carcasses act as microhabitats with large amounts of energy and nutrients, they likely develop unique bacterial assemblages in the ambient sediment, which in turn may stimulate colonization of other organisms such as protozoans. However, little is known about the microbial assemblages colonized in sediment around animal carcasses in the tidal zone. Herein we examined the bacterial and ciliophoran assemblages developed in association with fish carcasses by incubating the carcasses in the Higashiyachi tidal flat (Sendai, Japan). We collected sediment samples at 2, 9, and 42 days of incubation and analyzed the bacterial and ciliophoran assemblages by 16S and 18S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. We observed significant differences in the composition and relative abundance of bacterial and ciliophoran operational taxonomic units (OTUs) between the sediments with and without the carcasses. Our analyses suggest that these unique assemblages were created through the direct effects of the carcass and indirect effects through interactions between bacteria and ciliophorans. These results also suggest that animal carcasses developed a temporally unique microbial food web in the sediments close to the carcasses, although it disappeared for several weeks."
https://openalex.org/W3131435647,"The search persists for a safe and effective agent to lyse arterial thrombi in the event of acute heart attacks or strokes due to thrombotic occlusion. The culpable thrombi are composed either primarily of platelets and von Willebrand Factor (VWF), or polymerized fibrin, depending on the mechanism of formation. Current thrombolytics were designed to target red fibrin-rich clots, but may be not be efficacious on white VWF-platelet-rich arterial thrombi. We have developed an in vitro system to study the efficacy of known and proposed thrombolytic agents on white clots formed from whole blood in a stenosis with arterial conditions. The agents and adjuncts tested were tPA, ADAMTS-13, abciximab, N-acetyl cysteine, and N,N’-Diacetyl-L-cystine (DiNAC). Most of the agents, including tPA, had little thrombolytic effect on the white clots. In contrast, perfusion of DiNAC lysed thrombi as quickly as 1.5 min, which ranged up to 30 min at lower concentrations, and resulted in an average reduction in surface area of 71 ± 20%. The clot burden was significantly reduced compared to both tPA and a saline control ( p &lt;0.0001). We also tested the efficacy of all agents on red fibrinous clots formed in stagnant conditions. DiNAC did not lyse red clots, whereas tPA significantly lysed red clot over 48 h ( p &lt;0.01). These results lead to a novel use for DiNAC as a possible thrombolytic agent against acute arterial occlusions that could mitigate the risk of hyper-fibrinolytic bleeding."

We used the Taiwan National Health Research Insurance Database from 1997 to 2013 to examine trends in medical care needs for patients who received HHC, and the gender and income gaps in medical care needs, which were represented by resource utilization groups (RUG). We aimed to clarify three questions: 1. Are women at a higher level of medical care needs for HHC than men, 2. Does income relate to medical care needs? 3. Is the interaction term (gender and income) related to the likelihood of medical care needs? Results showed that the highest level of medical care need in HHC was reducing whereas the basic levels of medical care need for HHC are climbing over time in Taiwan during 1998 and 2013. The percentages of women with income-dependent status in RUG1 to RUG4 are 26.43%, 26.24%, 30.68%, and 32.07%, respectively. Women were more likely to have higher medical care needs than men (RUG 3: odds ratio, OR = 1.17, 95% confidence interval, CI = 1.10-1.25; RUG4: OR = 1.13, 95% CI = 1.06-1.22) in multivariates regression test. Compared to the patients with the high-income status, patients with the income-dependent status were more likely to receive RUG3 (OR = 2.34, 95% CI = 1.77-3.09) and RUG4 (OR = 1.98, 95% CI = 1.44-2.71). The results are consistent with the perspectives of fundamental causes of disease and feminization of poverty theory, implying gender and income inequalities in medical care needs. Policymakers should increase public spending for delivering home-based integrated care resources, especially for women with lower income, to reduce the double burden of female poverty at the higher levels of medical care needs for HHC."
https://openalex.org/W3129422158,"Pulsed-electromagnetic-field (PEMF) treatment was found to enhance cellular differentiation of the mouse preosteoblast, MC3T3-E1, to a more osteoblastic phenotype. Differentiation genes such as Alp , BSPI , cFos , Ibsp , Osteocalcin , Pthr1 and Runx2 showed increased expression in response to PEMF stimulation. Detailed molecular mechanisms linking PEMF to the activation of these genes are limited. Two adenosine receptors known to be modulated in response to PEMF, Adora2A and Adora3 , were functionally impaired by CRISPR-Cas9-mediated gene disruption, and the consequences of which were studied in the context of PEMF-mediated osteoblastic differentiation. Disruption of Adora2A resulted in a delay of Alp mRNA expression, but not alkaline phosphatase protein expression, which was similar to that found in wild type cells. However, Adora3 disruption resulted in significantly reduced responses at both the alkaline phosphatase mRNA and protein levels throughout the PEMF stimulation period. Defects observed in response to PEMF were mirrored using a chemically defined growth and differentiation-inducing media (DM). Moreover, in cells with Adora2A disruption, gene expression profiles showed a blunted response in cFos and Pthr1 to PEMF treatment; whereas cells with Adora3 disruption had mostly blunted responses in AlpI , BSPI , Ibsp , Osteocalcin and Sp7 gene activation. To demonstrate specificity for Adora3 function, the Adora3 open reading frame was inserted into the ROSA26 locus in Adora3 disrupted cells culminating in rescued PEMF responsiveness and thereby eliminating the possibility of off-target effects. These results lead us to propose that there are complementary and parallel positive roles for adenosine receptor A 2A and A 3 in PEMF-mediated osteoblast differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W3130148376,"Websites have become the primary means by which the US federal government communicates about its operations and presents information for public consumption. However, the alteration or removal of critical information from these sites is often entirely legal and done without the public’s awareness. Relative to paper records, websites enable governments to shape public understanding in quick, scalable, and permissible ways. During the Trump administration, website changes indicative of climate denial prompted civil society organizations to develop tools for tracking online government information sources. We in the Environmental Data &amp; Governance Initiative (EDGI) illustrate how five data visualization techniques can be used to document and analyze changes to government websites. We examine a large sample of websites of US federal environmental agencies and show that between 2016 and 2020: 1) the use of the term “climate change” decreased by an estimated 38%; 2) access to as much as 20% of the Environmental Protection Agency’s website was removed; 3) changes were made more to Cabinet agencies’ websites and to highly visible pages. In formulating ways to visualize and assess the alteration of websites, our study lays important groundwork for both systematically tracking changes and holding officials more accountable for their web practices. Our techniques enable researchers and watchdog groups alike to operate at the scale necessary to understand the breadth of impact an administration can have on the online face of government."
https://openalex.org/W3130869368,"Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are part of the innate and adaptive immune system, and form a critical interface between both systems. Studying the metabolic profile of PBMC could provide valuable information about the response to pathogens, toxins or cancer, the detection of drug toxicity, in drug discovery and cell replacement therapy. The primary purpose of this study was to develop an improved processing method for PBMCs metabolomic profiling with nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. To this end, an experimental design was applied to develop an alternative method to process PBMCs at low concentrations. The design included the isolation of PBMCs from the whole blood of four different volunteers, of whom 27 cell samples were processed by two different techniques for quenching and extraction of metabolites: a traditional one using organic solvents and an alternative one employing a high-intensity ultrasound probe, the latter with a variation that includes the use of deproteinizing filters. Finally, all the samples were characterized by 1 H-NMR and the metabolomic profiles were compared by the method. As a result, two new methods for PBMCs processing, called Ultrasound Method (UM) and Ultrasound and Ultrafiltration Method (UUM), are described and compared to the Folch Method (FM), which is the standard protocol for extracting metabolites from cell samples. We found that UM and UUM were superior to FM in terms of sensitivity, processing time, spectrum quality, amount of identifiable, quantifiable metabolites and reproducibility."
https://openalex.org/W3131431211,"Background/Aims Post-filter ionized calcium (iCa) measured on a blood gas analyzer (BGA) during regional citrate anticoagulated continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) are needed to control the regime. This increases the workload and requires attention including interpretation of blood analyses. Two algorithms were developed to calculate the post-filter iCa instead. The first algorithm used measured systemic total calcium and the second used a selected set of values from an initial blood gas sample as input. Methods Calculated post-filter iCa values were compared to real blood gas analyses. 57 patients treated at the intensive care unit at Skåne University Hospital in Lund during 2010–2017 were included after applying inclusion and exclusion criteria. Clinical and machine parameters were collected from the electronic medical records. Non-quality checked data contained 1240 measurements and quality checked data contained 1034 measurements. Results The first algorithm using measured systemic total calcium resulted in slightly better precision and trueness with an average difference between the predicted and measured post-filter iCa concentration of 0.0185±0.0453 mmol/L for quality checked data, p&lt;0.001. Neither algorithm could detect all instances requiring intervention. Conclusion The algorithms were able to estimate in range postfilter iCa values with great trueness and precision. However, they had some difficulties to estimate out-of-range postfilter iCa values. More work is needed to improve the algorithms especially in their citrate-modelling."
https://openalex.org/W3131445875,"Split-belt treadmill walking allows researchers to understand how new gait patterns are acquired. Initially, the belts move at two different speeds, inducing asymmetric step lengths. As people adapt their gait on a split-belt treadmill, left and right step lengths become more symmetric over time. Upon returning to normal walking, step lengths become asymmetric in the opposite direction, indicating deadaptation. Then, upon re-exposure to the split belts, step length asymmetry is less than the asymmetry at the start of the initial exposure, indicating readaptation. Changes in step length symmetry are driven by changes in step timing and step position asymmetry. It is critical to understand what factors can promote step timing and position adaptation and therefore influence step length asymmetry. There is limited research regarding the role of visual feedback to improve gait adaptation. Using visual feedback to promote the adaptation of step timing or position may be useful of understanding temporal or spatial gait impairments. We measured gait adaptation, deadaptation, and readaptation in twenty-nine healthy young adults while they walked on a split-belt treadmill. One group received no feedback while adapting; one group received asymmetric real-time feedback about step timing while adapting; and the last group received asymmetric real-time feedback about step position while adapting. We measured step length difference (non-normalized asymmetry), step timing asymmetry, and step position asymmetry during adaptation, deadaptation, and readaptation on a split-belt treadmill. Regardless of feedback, participants adapted step length difference, indicating that walking with temporal or spatial visual feedback does not interfere with gait adaptation. Compared to the group that received no feedback, the group that received temporal feedback exhibited smaller early deadaptation step position asymmetry ( p = 0.005). There was no effect of temporal or spatial feedback on step timing. The feedback groups adapted step timing and position similarly to walking without feedback. Future work should investigate whether asymmetric visual feedback also results in typical gait adaptation in populations with altered step timing or position control."
https://openalex.org/W3132557850,"Introduction Medicines used at Danish public hospitals are purchased through tendering. Together with drug shortage, tendering result in drug changes, known to compromise patient safety, increase medicine errors and to be resource demanding for healthcare personnel. Details on actual resources required in the clinic setting to manage drug changes are unknown. The aim of the study is to explore time spend by hospital personnel in a drug change situation when dispensing medicine to in- and outpatients in a hospital setting in the Capital Region of Denmark. Method A time and motion study, using direct observation combined with time-registration tools, such as eye-tracking, video recording and manual time tracking. Data were obtained from observing nurses and social and health care assistants with dispensing authority while dispensing or extraditing medicine before and after the implementation of drug changes in two clinical setting; a cardiology ward and a rheumatology outpatient clinic. Results Hospital personnel at the cardiology inpatient ward spent 20.5 seconds on dispensing a drug, which was increased up to 28.4 seconds by drug changes. At the rheumatology outpatient clinic, time to extradite medicine increased from 8 minutes and 6 seconds to 15 minutes and 36 seconds by drug changes due to tender. Similarly, drug changes due to drug shortage prolonged the extradition time to 16 minutes and 54 seconds. Statistical analysis reveal that drug changes impose a significant increase in time to dispense a drug for both in- and outpatients. Conclusion Clinical hospital personnel spent significantly longer time on drug change situations in the dispensing of medicine to in- and outpatients in a hospitals. This study emphasizes that implementing drug changes do require extra time, thus, the hospital management should encounter this and ensure that additional time is available for the hospital personnel to ensure a safe drug dispensing process."
https://openalex.org/W3131996726,"Background Water quality monitoring at the dialysis units (DU) is essential to ensure an appropriate dialysis fluid quality and guarantee an optimal and safe dialysis treatment to patients. This paper aims to evaluate the effectiveness, economic and organizational impact of automation, digitalization and remote water quality monitoring, through a New Water Technology (NWT) at a hospital DU to produce dialysis water, compared to a Conventional Water Technology (CWT). Methods A before-and-after study was carried out at the Hospital Clínic Barcelona. Data on CWT was collected during 1-year (control) and 7-month for the NWT (case). Data on water quality, resource use and unit cost were retrospective and prospectively collected. A comparative effectiveness analysis on the compliance rate of quality water parameters with the international guidelines between the NWT and the CWT was conducted. This was followed by a cost-minimization analysis and an organizational impact from the hospital perspective. An extensive deterministic sensitivity analysis was also performed. Results The NWT compared to the CWT showed no differences on effectiveness measured as the compliance rate on international requirements on water quality (100% vs. 100%), but the NWT yielded savings of 3,599 EUR/year compared to the CWT. The NWT offered more data accuracy (daily measures: 6 vs. 1 and missing data: 0 vs. 20 days/year), optimization of the DU employees’ workload (attendance to DU: 4 vs. 19 days/month) and workflow, through the remote and continuous monitoring, reliability of data and process regarding audits for quality control. Conclusions While the compliance of international recommendations on continuous monitoring was performed with the CWT, the NWT was efficient compared to the CWT, mainly due to the travel time needed by the technical operator to attend the DU. These results were scalable to other economic contexts. Nonetheless, they should be taken with caution either when the NWT equipment/maintenance cost are largely increased, or the workforce involvement is diminished."
https://openalex.org/W3133334876,"Genetic selection in parental broiler breeders has increased their susceptibility to metabolic disorders and reproductive dysfunction. We have recently shown that maternal dietary grape seed extract (GSE) supplementation in hens improves fertility parameters, egg quality, oxidative stress in different tissues and the quality of F1 chicks. Here, we analysed the growth and fertility (both female and male) of the F1 generation animals and the quality of their offspring (F2 generation). Eggs issued from hens supplemented with GSE presented lower ROS production than control hens, suggesting a change in the embryonic environment. However, this did not affect the growth nor the body composition of male and female F1s from hatching to adulthood (37 weeks of age). At 37 weeks of age, the biochemistry analysis of the GSE-F1 muscle has revealed an increase in sensitivity to oxidative stress and a slight change in lipid composition. Both male and female F1-GSE groups presented a delay in puberty with a lower testis volume at 30 weeks of age and lower ovary development at 26 weeks of age. Adult GSE-F1 males did not present histological alterations of seminiferous tubules or semen production, but the semen quality was degraded due to higher oxidative stress and DNA-damaged spermatozoa compared with control F1 animals. In adult GSE-F1 females, despite the delay in puberty, the females laid more eggs of better quality (fewer broken eggs and a higher hatching rate). At hatching, the weight of the chicks from GSE-F1 females was reduced, and this effect was stronger in F2 male chicks (F2) compared with F2 control chicks (F2), because of the lower muscle volume. In conclusion, we can raise the hypothesis that maternal dietary GSE supplementation produces eggs with change in embryonic metabolism, which may affect in adulthood the fertility. The data obtained from the F1-GSE group pointed to a sex-specific modification with higher egg quality in females but semen sensitive to stress in males. Finally, male F2 chicks were leaner than control chicks. Thus, maternal dietary grape seed extract (GSE) supplementation in hens may impact on the fertility of the offspring in a sex-specific manner in subsequent generations."
https://openalex.org/W3129988517,"Background This study aimed to investigate the clinical significance of hypoalbuminemia (HA) in patients with scrub typhus complicated by acute kidney injury (AKI). Methods From 2009 to 2018, 611 patients were diagnosed with scrub typhus. We divided the patients into two groups [normoalbuminemia (NA) vs. HA] based on the serum albumin level of 3.0 g/dL and compared the incidence, clinical characteristics, and severity of AKI based on the RIFLE classification between the two groups. Results Of the total 611 patients, 78 (12.8%) were categorized into the HA group. Compared to patients in the NA group, patients in the HA group were older (73 ± 9 vs. 62 ± 14 years, P&lt;0.001). The HA group had a significantly longer hospital stay (9.6 ± 6.2 vs 6.2 ± 3.1 days, p&lt;0.001) and a higher incidence of complications in respiratory and cardiovascular systems. Furthermore, AKI developed significantly more in patients in the HA group (58% vs. 18%, p&lt;0.001) as compared to the NA group. The overall incidence of AKI was 23.1%; of which, 14.9%, 7.0%, and 1.2% of cases were classified as Risk, Injury, and Failure, respectively. The serum albumin level correlated with AKI severity (3.4 ± 0.5 vs 3.0 ± 0.5 vs 2.6 ± 0.3, p&lt;0.05). In a multivariate logistic regression analysis for predicting AKI, age, presence of co-morbidities such as chronic kidney disease, total bilirubin, leukocytosis, and hypoalbuminemia were significant predictors for AKI. Conclusion Serum albumin level is helpful to predict the development and severity of scrub typhus-associated AKI."
https://openalex.org/W3131226883,"Understanding animals’ aversion is important to improving their welfare. Aversion is often assessed using an approach-avoidance (AA) test in which animals have to forfeit a reward if they want to avoid an event or environment presented in the same place. However, sometimes the event/environment suspected to be aversive may physically impair the animal’s ability to withdraw from that place (i.e. its ability to express aversion), leading to incorrect interpretations. Combining AA with a Conditioned-Stimulus that predicts the event/environment may overcome this problem by allowing animals to demonstrate aversion without exposure to the stimulus. We aimed to validate this paradigm for testing aversion in chickens. Seven Hyline-Brown chickens were trained to obtain a food reward from a coloured bowl located in the test chamber (TC) of a two-chambered box; the reward was presented in a green bowl with an inactivated air canister or a red bowl with the canister activated to deliver an air puff. Two 5-minute tests were conducted, one with each bowl colour and both with the canister inactivated. All chickens entered TC with the green bowl. With the red bowl, two chickens entered on their first attempt, one fully entered after a partial entry (3/7 fully entered), two made only partial entries and two made no attempts to enter. Chickens spent less time in the TC with the red bowl (median 31s, IQR 7–252) compared to the green bowl (293s, IQR 290–294; p = 0.008). The higher ratio of partial to full entries, failure to enter the TC and less time spent in TC reflected chickens’ aversion to the air puff, signalled by the red bowl. The paradigm allowed chickens to demonstrate aversion without exposure to the aversive stimulus during testing."
https://openalex.org/W3133183593,"Although most fatalities in tsunami-related disasters are conjectured to be a result of drowning, injury risk owing to collision with other floating debris or fixed buildings has not been studied sufficiently. In this study, the impact force corresponding to the collision of a concrete block and drifting test body in a tsunami wave was experimentally investigated, and the injury risk was evaluated in terms of different biomechanical indexes; specifically, maximum acceleration, head injury criterion, and impact force. The injury risk indicated by the considered indexes was reasonably low. It was noted that if a healthy adult collided with a concrete wall under a velocity of 2.5 m s -1 and wave height of 0.59 m, the adult would likely not be critically injured. However, a similar collision impact poses considerable risk to infants and children, as well as the more sensitive regions of the adult body. Moreover, in the case of large tsunamis, such as that in the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake, a drifting person may be at considerable risk for injuries. The collision impact occurring on the tip of a surge flow is notably significantly larger than that on a bore flow. This is because a surge flow, which arrives at the concrete block earlier than a bore flow, forms a certain water layer along the concrete wall and that layer acts as a cushion for any body drifting on the bore flow, indicating the importance of such a buffering effect. These findings can provide practical guidance regarding the formulation of effective tsunami-protection measures."
