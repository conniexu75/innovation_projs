https://openalex.org/W1566584097,"Differential and density gradient centrifugation were used to prepare a vesicular membrane fraction from hog gastric mucosa enriched 17-fold with respect to cation-activated ATPase and 5'-AMPase. Fractionation of the gradient material by free flow electrophoresis resulted in a fraction 35-fold enriched in cation-activated ATPase and essentially free of 5'-AMPase and Mg2+ATPase. The addition of ATP to either fraction resulted in H+ uptake and Rb+ efflux. The ionophoric and osmotic sensitivity showed that these ion movements were due to transport rather than binding. The cation selectivity sequences, substrate specificities and action of inhibitors indicated that the transport was a function of K+ATPase activity. The characteristics of the ATP-dependent enhancement of SCN- uptake and 8-anilinonapthalene-1-sulfonate fluorescence in the presence of valinomycin and the action of ionophores and lipid-permeable ions suggested that the energy dependent K+:H+ exchange was effectively nonelectrogenic. Thus these vesicles contain a nonelectrogenic (H+ + K+)-ATPase, hence acid secretion by the stomach is probably due to an ATP-dependent H+ + K+ exchange."

https://openalex.org/W2085113049,"A dopamine-sensitive adenylate cyclase with characteristics similar to those measured in the striatum is present in the rat substantia nigra. Destruction of dopamine cell bodies by intranigral 6-hydroxydopamine application failed to abolish the response of nigral adenylate cyclase to dopamine. In contrast, brain hemitransection between the striatum and substantia nigra, or a more circumscribed lesion of striatonigral pathways, abolished the dopamine stimulation of adenylate cyclase in the substantia nigra. These results suggest that dopamine receptors within the substantia nigra are not located on dopamine cell bodies but are associated with a pathway, containing γ-aminobutyric acid or substance P, which projects from forebrain structures to the substantia nigra."
https://openalex.org/W2038961110,"Upon exposure to 0.1 mM N-phosphonacetyl-L-aspartate (PALA), a transition state analog inhibitor of aspartate transcarbamylase, most cells of a simian virus 40 (SV40)-transformed Syrian hamster line are killed within a few days, but resistant mutants form spontaneously with frequency 2–5 × 10−5 in a stochastic process not dependent upon the presence of the inhibitor. The resistant phenotype is stable for many months in the absence of PALA. Other cell lines also give resistant mutants, but with substantially lower frequencies. Serial selection with PALA at concentrations up to 25 mM has yielded clones with more than 100 times the original aspartate transcarbamylase activity. The activities of carbamyl-P synthetase and dihydroorotase, which co-purify with aspartate transcarbamylase as a three-enzyme complex, increase in parallel with aspartate transcarbamylase activity in each resistant clone tested, but there is no substantial change in the activities of the last three enzymes of the de novo pathway, which are not in this complex. In each of the three resistant clones tested, there is an increase in the number of aspartate transcarbamylase active sites, determined by titration with 3H-PALA, which closely parallels the increase in enzyme activity. In one resistant clone tested, there is no change in the Ki for PALA or the Km for carbamyl-P. The only mechanism detected for achieving resistance to PALA is an increase in the steady state amount of the three enzyme complex."

https://openalex.org/W1527783640,"1. Despite the same methionine-sulfur:heme-iron:imidazole-nitrogen hemochrome structure observed by x-ray crystallography in four of the seven c-type eukaryotic and prokaryotic cytochromes examined, and the occurrence of the characteristic 695 nm absorption band correlated with the presence of a methionine-sulfur:heme-iron axial ligand in all seven proteins, they fall into two distinct classes on the basis of their EPR and optical spectra. The horse, tuna, and bakers' yeast iso-1 cytochromes c have a predominant neutral pH EPR form with g1=3.06, g2=2.26, and g3=1.25, while the bakers' yeast iso-2 and Euglena cytochromes c, the Rhodospirillum rubrum cytochrome c2, and the Paracoccus denitrificans cytochrome c550 all have a predominant neutral pH EPR form with g1=3.2, g2=2.05, and g3=1.39. The ferricytochromes with g1=3.06 have a B-Q splitting that is approximately 150 cm-1 larger than the ferricytochromes with g1=3.2. 2. Each of the cytochromes displays up to four low spin EPR forms that are in pH-dependent equilibrium and can all be observed at near neutral pH. As the pH is raised the predominant neutral pH form is converted into two forms with g1=3.4 and g1=3.6, identified by comparsion with model compounds and other heme proteins as epsilon-amino:heme-iron:imidazole and bis-epsilon-amino:heme-iron ferrihemochromes, respectively. 3. The pK for the conversion of the predominant neutral pH EPR form into the alkaline pH forms is the same as the pK for the disappearance of the 695 nm absorption band for the cytochromes, even though these pK values range over 2 pH units. This confirms that the g1=3.06 and g1=3.2 forms contain the methionine-sulfur:heme-iron axial ligand while the g1=3.4 and the g1=3.6 forms do not. 4. At extremes of pH, the horse and bakers' yeast iso-1 proteins display several high and low spin forms that are identified, showing that a variety of protein-derived ligands will coordinate to the heme iron including methionine and cysteine sulfur, histidine imidazole, and lysine epsilon-amine. 5. The spectrum of horse cytochrome c with added azide, cyanide, hydroxide, or imidazole as axial ligands has also been examined. 6. From a comparison of the EPR and optical spectral characteristics of these groups of cytochromes with model compounds, it is suggested that the difference between them is due to a change in the hydrogen bonding or perhaps even in the protonation of N-1 of the heme iron-bound histidine imidazole."

The enzyme possesses a specific activity of 45 mumol/mg/min as tested with the substrate Z-Gly-Pro-Leu-Gly (Km = 6.0 X 10(-5)), has a molecular weight of 115,000, is comprised of two subunits with a molecular weight of 57,000, and exhibits maximal activity at pH 7.5 to 8.0. With the exception of the -Pro-Pro linkage, the -Pro-X-peptide bond (X equals L- and D-amino acid residues) located internally in the peptide sequence can be hydrolyzed (cleavage occurs faster when X = lipophilic side chain as compared to X = acidic side chain). The appropriate -Pro-X- bonds in zinc-free porcine insulin, oxytocin, arginine vasopressin, angiotensin II, bradykinin-potentiating factor were cleaved. Human gastrin, adrenocorticotropic hormone, denatured guinea pig skin collagen, and ascaris cuticle collagen were not degraded. Dipeptides with the structure Z-Pro-LD-X competitively inhibit post-proline cleaving enzyme."

The enzyme was shown to be a single polypeptide chain with an estimated molecular weight of approximately 38,000. The three electrophoretic forms of erythrocyte adenosine deaminase purified simultaneously by this technique were indistinguishable by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions. Several properties of the highly purified adenosine deaminase including pH optimum, Km for substrate, Ki for product, Stokes radius, sedimentation coefficient, and apparent substrate specificity were identical with the properties observed with an impure preparation of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1488287286,"Under anaerobic conditions, cells of Entamoeba histolytica grown with bacteria produce H2 and acetate while cells grown axenically produce neither. Aerobically, acetate is produced and O2 is consumed by amebae from either type of cells. Centrifuged extracts, 2.4 x 106 x g x min, from both types of cells contain pyruvate synthase (EC 1.2.7.1) and an acetate thiokinase which, together, form a system capable of converting pyruvate to acetate. Pyruvate synthase catalyzes the reaction: pyruvate + CoA leads to CO2 + acetyl-CoA + 2E. Electron acceptors which function with this enzyme are FAD, FMN, riboflavin, ferredoxin, and methyl viologen, but not NAD or NADP. The amebal acetate thiokinase catalyzes the reaction acetyl-CoA + ADP + Pi leads to acetate + ATP + CoA. For this apparently new enzyme we suggest the trivial name acetyl-CoA-synthetase (ADP-forming). Extracts from axenic amebae do not contain hydrogenase, but extracts from cells grown with bacteria do. It is postulated that in bacteria-grown amebae electrons generated at the pyruvate synthase step are utilized anaerobically to produce H2 via the hydrogenase and that the acetyl-CoA is converted to acetate in an energy-conserving step catalyzed by amebal acetyl-CoA synthetase. Aerobically, cells grown under either regimen may utilize the energy-conserving pyruvate-to-acetate pathway since O2 then serves as the ultimate electron acceptor."

The affinity columns were prepared in two steps: (a) direct reductive amination of the disaccharide and aminoethyl gel with sodium cyanoborohydride in aqueous solution at pH 9; (b) N-acetylation of excess amino groups. Affinity columns prepared by reductive amination of lactose, melibiose, maltose, and di-N-acetylchitobiose were used to purify the following lectins: lactose, peanut, castor bean; melibiose, Bandeiraea simplicifolia; maltose, jack bean, common lentil; di-N-acetylchitobiose, wheat germ. These columns are extremely stable, have good flow rates, and high binding capacities."
https://openalex.org/W1604356881,"Position beta 82 in human hemoglobin (Hb) is normally occupied by lysine, a positively charged residue that is involved in the binding of anionic cofactors. This residue is substituted by a neutral residue in Hb Providence Asn and by a negatively charged residue in Hb Providence Asp. Hb Providence Asp shows more differences from Hb A than does Hb Providence Asn in studies of the kinetics and equilibria of ligand binding. For both forms, homotropic (cooperative) interactions are normal with n values of 2.5 to 2.7, while heterotropic (pH and anion) interactions are reduced greatly. The reduction in anion sensitivity is attributed to the absence of a positive residue at position beta 82. Reduction in pH sensitivity may be due to a ligand-linked change in the pK of a neighboring residue, beta 143 histidine, which normally is not a Bohr group. This change in pK would act in opposition to the normal Bohr effect. Reduction in the net positive charge of the central cavity has a further consequence. Relative to Hb A, both Hb Providence Asn and Hb Providence Asp show decreased oxygen affinities at neutral pH in the absence of cofactors. This suggests that in Hb A the binding of anionic cofactors directly influences the oxygen affinity by neutralizing the charged groups of the diphosphoglycerate binding site and thus stabilizing the low affinity (T) conformation. From pH 6 to 9 in the presence of 1 M NaCl, where all the charged groups may be masked, the oxygen-binding properties of Hb A and the Hb Providence mutants are identical. Moreover, subunit dissociation of the liganded Hb Providence mutants appears to be increased, as is known to occur for Hb A in the presence of high salt. The results obtained with Hb Providence Asn and Hb Providence Asp illustrate how single amino acid substitutions can modify hemoglobins' pH and anion interactions without altering cooperative interactions between subunits. The alteration in cofactor effects observed with these mutants also illustrates differences between the allosteric effects induced by organic and inorganic anions."
https://openalex.org/W1954275670,"Isolated rat hepatocytes converted mevalonolactone into sterol intermediates and fatty acids 6- to 8-fold faster than mevalonate salt at concentrations less than 6 X 10(-4) M. Incubation of hepatocytes for 3 h normally results in induction of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase. This increase in enzyme activity was inhibited by mevalonolactone and by mevalonate salt; at each concentration between 6 X 10(-4) M and 6 X 10(-8) M the lactone was a more effective inhibitor than the salt. The increase in enzyme activity was completely prevented by 6 X 10(-4) M lactone, and at this concentration the cells synthesized from the lactone an amount of sterol per hour which approximated that leavingthe cells in the same period. Administration of mevalonolactone to intact rats resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of hepatic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase activity. At the highest dose (400 mg of (RS)-mevalonolactone/200 g of rat) enzyme activities declined 85% within 45 min and were still suppressed below normals after 28 h. Mevalonolactone treatment resulted in increases in liver cholesterol content and in the cholesterol ester concentration of liver microsomes. The results demonstrate that the activity of hepatic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase can be controlled by the rate of endogenous sterol synthesis both in vitro and in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1529738243,"Gaucher's disease is a lysosomal storage disease caused by a deficiency in the enzyme glucocerebrosidase. A small, heat-stable glycoprotein first obtained from Gaucher spleen (Ho, M. W., and O'Brien, J. S. (1971) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.A. 68, 2810-2813) has been observed to stimulate the activity of glucocerebrosidase isolated from normal tissue. It has been suggested that this material might be important in the physiological catabolism of glucocerebroside in normal individuals (Ho, M. W. (1974) in Enzyme Therapy in Lysosomal Storage Diseases (Tager, J. M., Hooghwinkel, G. J. M., and Daems, W. Th., eds) pp.239-246, North-Holland Publishing Co., Amsterdam). In order to investigate this suggestion, glucocerebrosidase activating factors were isolated and purified from control and Gaucher spleen and characterized. Although approximately the same mass of activator was isolated from both spleens, the two activators differ from one another in a number of important respects: (a) the activator from the control spleen is only 6 per cent as active (on a protein basis) as the activator from Gaucher spleen; (b) the amino acid compositions of the purified activators are significantly different; and (c) carbohydrate analysis of the purified activators indicates that the activator from Gaucher spleen is a glycoprotein, while that from control spleen is not. Comparative kinetic studies demonstrate that the anionic detergent, sodium taurocholate, and the acidic phospholipid, phosphatidylinositol, both stimulate glucocerebrosidase activity to a larger extent than the activator substance from Gaucher spleen. The activator from Gaucher spleen and human liver glucocerebrosidase both appear to contain significant hydrophobic character. We conclude that the activator is probably not physiologically important in the catabolism of glucocerebroside in normal tissues. The significance of the occurrence of this apparently unique glycoprotein activator in Gaucher spleen remains obscure; however, its presence represents another interesting aspect of Gaucher's disease that warrants further investigation."

https://openalex.org/W1493274974,"D-Pencillamine is believed to inhibit collagen cross-link biosynthesis by forming thiazolidine rings with lysyl-derived aldehydes that are intermediates in bifunctional cross-link synthesis. Recently, we showed that aldehyde biosynthesis catalyzed by lysyl oxidase occurs after the onset of fibril formation and that nascent aldehydes form Schiff-base cross-links rapidly in fibrils. This suggested that the accessibility of D-penicillamine to most aldehydes formed during cross-link synthesis might be limited. To study this, reconstituted chick bone collagen fibrils were incubated in vitro with highly purified lysyl oxidase and D-penicillamine. As reported in previous studies in vivo, allysine content increased and polyfunctional cross-link synthesis decreased with D-penicillamine. However, the concentration of bifunctional cross-links increased rather than decreased due to a 2-fold increase in N6:6'-dehydro-5,5'-dihydroxylysinonorleucine. Hydroxyallysine, an intermediate in formation of this Schiff base, decreased. A time study indicated that allysine levels increased primarily after the bulk of Schiff base synthesis. These results indicate that D-penicillamine does not inhibit bifunctional cross-link synthesis as previously suggested. Its principal effect is to block synthesis of polyfunctional cross-link products from Schiff base cross-link precursors and to cause accumulation of these precursors. This effect may be due to interference with the close molecular packing required for polyfunctional cross-link synthesis. These results also suggest a mechanism for the relative insensitivity of tissues such as bone with high hydroxylysine content to D-penicillamine. In this study, D-penicillamine caused selective accumulation of allysyl and not hydroxyallysyl residues. In bone as opposed to soft tissues, hydroxyallysyl residues are intermediates in synthesis of almost all cross-links."

Within minutes of ingestion by a mosquito the gametocytes transform into mature gametes in the process of ""exflagellation.""

https://openalex.org/W1992434138,"A protease associated with purified calf thymus chromatin has been found to act exclusively upon histone H2A, yielding a single new protein species, cH2A. This fragment migrates faster than H2A in acrylamide gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions. The cH2A was purified and subjected to amino acid analysis and partial sequencing by the use of carboxypeptidase A. These studies demonstrated that cH2A had been derived from the removal of fifteen amino acids from the carboxy-terminal end of the intact H2A molecule, and that valine114 was its new carboxy-terminal residue. This cleavage does not occur under low ionic strength conditions, where H2A is believed to approximate a random coil; rather, it requires high ionic strength conditions similar to those under which the H2A molecule undergoes radical secondary and tertiary structural changes. This dependence upon ionic strength implies that the proteolytic cleavage is conformation- as well as sequence-specific. The H2A-specific protease is of nuclear origin, since isolation of nuclei by methods designed to maximize or minimize cytoplasmic contamination does not affect the level of proteolytic activity associated with purified chromatin. This nuclear protease appears to be tightly associated with the chromatin in vivo, for 0.6 M NaCl will not free it from isolated chromatin. A concentration of 1.2 M NaCl is required to dissociate the protease as well as its substrate from chromatin. The relationship of this enzyme to previously reported chromatin-bound proteases is discussed."

The procedure is based upon affinity chromatography with agarose-epsilon-aminocaproyl-fucosamine. The isolated enzyme was found to be pure by a number of different analytical gel techniques and is essentially free of other lysosomal gylcosidases. The purified enzyme exhibits a positive periodic acid-Schiff stain, suggesting that it is a glycoprotein. The purified enzyme has a pH optimum of 5.7 to 5.9, a Vmax of 27 mumol/min/mg of protein, and a Km of 0.19 mM with p-nitrophenyl alpha-L-fucopyranoside as substrate. L-Fucose was the only possibly physiological effector of the enzyme which was identified; it exhibited a Ki of 1.6 mM, with p-nitrophenyl alpha-L-fucopyranoside as substrate. The enzyme has a subunit molecular weight of approximately 55,000 by Na dodecyl-SO4 electrophoresis in a variety of gel systems. The molecular weight of the native enzyme was indicated to be approximately 160,000 by sucrose density centrifugation, 300,000 by molecular sieve chromatography on Sephadex G-200, and 217,000 by sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation. The weight of evidence suggests that the enzyme is a tetramer. Incubation on the absence of sulfhydryl reagents under appropriate conditions generates a second alpha-L-fucosidase activity band on gels corresponding to a molecular weight of approximately 40,000 to 50,000. This result suggests that the subunit is relatively stable and may reassociate to form active enzyme. Alpha-L-Fucosidase requires a high concentration of protein and the presence of a sulfhydryl reagent for stabilization. It is rapidly inactivated by p-chloromercuriphenyl sulfonic acid, this inactivation being rapidly reversible by the addition of 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol. The enzyme catalyzed the hydrolysis of 1 leads to 2, 1 leads to 3, and 1 leads to 4 fucosyl linkages and was found to be active on glycopeptides but not on native glycoproteins. The amino acid and carbohydrate composition of the enzyme was determined. The native enzyme contains the following sugars (residues per tetramer): fucose (3.5), mannose (32), galactose (8), glucose (9), glucosamine (32), and sialic acid (8). Rat liver lysosomal alpha-glucosidase, also produced in the rapid isolation procedure described herein, contained less than 0.1 residue of sialic acid per subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1497621800,"The dissociations of porcine heart mitochondrial, bovine heart mitochondrial, and porcine heart cytoplasmic malate dehydrogenase dimers (L-malate: NAD+oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.1.37) have been examined by Sephadex G-100 gel filtration chromatography and sedimentation velocity ultracentrifugation. The porcine mitochondrial enzyme was found to chromatograph as subunits when applied to a gel filtration column at a concentration of .02 muM or less at pH 7.0. The presence of coenzymes shifted the dissociation equilibrium at low enzyme concentrations in favor of dimer formation. Monomer formation was also favored when procine mitochondrial enzyme was incubated at pH 5.0 even at concentrations as high as 120 muM. This shift in equilibrium has been correlated with the increased rate and specificity of sulfhydryl residue modification with N-ethylmaleimide at pH 5.0 (Gregory, E.M., Yost, F.J.,Jr., Rohrbach, M.S., and Harrison, J.H. (1971)J. Biol. Chem. 246, 5491-5497). Bovine mitochondrial enzyme did not exhibit a concentration-dependent disociation under the conditions examined. However, at pH5.0 monomer formation was favored, and correlations could again be drawn with sulfhydryl residue modification (Gregory, E.M. (1975)J.Biol. Chem. 250, 5470-5474). In both mitochondrial enzymes, coenzyme binding was found capable of overcoming the effects of pH on the dissociation equilibrium, and dimer formation was favored. Unlike either of the above mentioned enzymes, porcine cytoplasmic malate dehydrogenase did not dissociate into its monomeric form under any conditions investigated."
https://openalex.org/W1621751326,"The phosphorylation of pig liver pyruvate kinase by cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate-dependent protein kinase has been studied. For comparison, mixed histone and a synthetic heptapeptide were also used as substrates. Protein kinase was purified by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, hydroxyapatite, and Sephadex G-200. The enzyme was stimulated by cyclic AMP with apparent Ka values of 2.5 and 0.8 x 10-7 M for pyruvate kinase and histone substrates, respectively. Divalent cations were essential for the activity of the protein kinase. Variation of the concentration of ATP resulted in approximately straight lines in Lineweaver-Burk plots for the phosphorylation of both pyruvate kinase and mixed histone. The apparent Km values for ATP were 21 and 11 muM, respectively. The phosphorylation rate increased with the concentration of pyruvate kinase even at a concentration of 2 muM pyruvate kinase. At a high ionic strength, the phosphorylation rate of both pyruvate kinase and histone decreased. The phosphorylation rate varied markedly with pH in imidazole/HC1 and Tris/HC1 buffers. At slightly alkaline pH values, pyruvate kinase was phosphorylated at a much higher rate than pH7, but this was not the case for histone. At pH 8.5, the phosphorylation rate of pyruvate kinase was 3.5 times the rate at pH 7, while the corresponding increase for the histone phosphorylation was 50 per cent. In potassium phosphate buffers, the phosphorylation rate of both substrates did not change significantly over the pH range studied. Arrhenius' plots of the protein kinase reaction resulted in a break at about 10 degrees when pyruvate kinase was used as substrate, whereas a straight line was obtained when using histone. The negative allosteric effectors of pyruvate kinase, alanine, and phenylalanine, increased the phosphorylation rate of pyruvate kinase at pH 8 by 50 and 120 per cent, respectively. The same effectors did not influence the phosphorylation rate of mixed histone or a synthetic heptapeptide. It is concluded that the conformations adopted by pyruvate kinase in the presence of allosteric inhibitors make it a better substrate for the protein kinase."

Receptor saturation was demonstrated and a linear response to receptor concentration over at least a 30-fold rang obtained. By means of the assay it was shown that (a) all assayable receptors of rat basophil leukemia cells are cell surface expressed; (b) receptor specificity remains intact during solubilization; (c) the binding constants of the solubilized IgE receptors are similar to those determined on intact cells. Utilizing agarose gel filtration, preliminary estimates of the molecular weight of the active free solubilized receptor and of its complex with IgE suggest that the receptor is univalent."
https://openalex.org/W1524380663,"This paper reports on the discovery of a protein kinase activity associated with the inner membrane of mammalian mitochondria. The enzyme does not respond to addition of cyclic AMP or cyclic GMP and has a preference for whole histone as phosphate acceptor. Some standard assay systems for the cyclic nucleotide-dependent cytosol protein kinases would be unable to pick up this activity of the orthophosphate concentration is higher than 25 mM and the pH or the assay lower than pH 6.5. The enzyme described here has an apparent pH optimum of 8.5. Activity in liver mitochondria is not evident unless the mitochondria are disrupted by either sonication or freezing and thawing. Distribution of kinase activity in centrifugal fractions of both liver and heart mitochondrial sonicates was parallel to that of the two inner membrane marker enzymes succinic dehydrogenase and cytochrome oxidase and quite different from that of the matrix enzyme malic dehydrogenase. Experiments with preparations enriched in outer or inner membranes confirmed the contention that this enzyme is located on the inner membrane. Since disruption of the inner membrane by a freeze-thaw treatment (after the outer membrane had been disrupted by swelling in phosphate) was necessary for full expression of activity by this enzyme, the tentative conclusion was reached that substrate is accepted only from the matrix side of the inner membrane."

Several products, which probably differed in the size of the oligosaccharide moiety, were labeled. These could be partially resolved by thin layer chromatography and DEAE-cellulose chromatography. The labeled lipid-bound oligosaccharides were retained on DEAE-cellulose more strongly than synthetic dolichyl alpha-D-[14C]mannopyranosyl phosphate. They were stable to mild alkali, but labile to acid and hot alkali. Acid treatment yielded a neutral 14C-labeled oligosaccharide fraction which was estimated by gel filtration to have a minimum of 8 monosaccharide residues. Hot alkali treatment yielded a mixture of neutral and acidic 14C-labeled oligosaccharides which could be transformed into neutral products by alkaline phosphatase. The D-[14C]mannose residues were alpha-linked at the nonreducing terminus of the oligosaccharides since they could be removed completely with alpha-mannosidase. Most of the D-[14C]mannose-labeled oligosaccharides were retained on concanavalin A Sepharose and eluted with methyl alpha-D-mannopyranoside. Pancreatic dolichyl beta-D-[14C]mannopyranosyl phosphate incubated with calf pancreas microsomes in the presence of sodium taurocholate was efficiently utilized as donor of alpha-D-mannosyl residues in lipid-bound oligosaccharides. The products formed from dolichyl beta-D-[14C]mannopyranosyl phosphate were identical with those formed from GDP-D-[14C]mannose, and evidence was obtained to show that the dolichyl beta-D-[14C]mannopyranosyl phosphate was serving as donor without prior conversion to GDP-D-[14C]mannose. Transfer of mannose from dolichyl beta-D-[14C]mannopyranosyl phosphate to lipid-bound oligosaccharides took place at a pH optimum of 7.3, whereas transfer to the precipitate containing glycoproteins was greatest at pH 6.0 in Tris/maleate buffer. The addition of divalent cation was not required, but low concentrations of EDTA were extremely inhibitory. The carbohydrate composition of the lipid-bound oligosaccharides of microsomal membranes was investigated by gas-liquid chromatography and by reduction with sodium borotritide. A heterogeneous mixture of oligosaccharides containing N-acetyl-D-glucosamine, D-mannose, and D-glucose varying in proportions from approximately 1/2.5/0.5 to 1/5/1.5 was obtained with glucosamine at the reducing end. Acid treatment of the lipid-bound oligosaccharide fraction yielded dolichyl pyrophosphate, suggesting that at least some of the oligosaccharides were linked to dolichol through a pyrophosphate group."

The pKa of the protein-fluorescence quenching curve is shifted toward 7.6 in the presence of NAD+, and the ternary complex formation with NAD+ and trifluoroethanol results in a pH-independent maximal quench. At pH (pD) 10.5, the rate constant for NAD+ binding was 2.6 times faster in D2O2 than in H2O due to the shift of the pKa. Based on these results, a scheme has been proposed in which the state of protonation of an enzyme functional group with a pKa of 9.8 controls the conformational state of the enzyme. NAD+ binds to the acid conformation and subsequently causes another conformational change resulting in the perturbation of the pKa to 7.6. Alcohol then binds to the unprotonated form of the functional group with a pKa of 7.6 in the binary enzyme-NAD+ complex and converts the enzyme to the alkaline conformation. Thus, at neutral pH liver alcohol dehydrogenase undergoes two conformational changes en route to the ternary complex in which hydride transfer occurs."
https://openalex.org/W1597354900,"A membrane fraction enriched in parathyroid hormone (PTH)-sensitive adenylate cyclase and sodium and potassium ion-activated (Na+, K+)-ATPase was prepared from bovine kidney. Tritiated PTH binding to this membrane fraction was dependent on both hormone and membrane protein concentration. Both total and specific binding of the hormone decreased significantly after 5 to 10 min of incubation at 22 degrees. PTH binding was highly specific, being sensitive to inhibition only with active forms of unlabeled hormone (native and 1-34 PTH). Specific binding showed a pH optimum of 7.3 to 7.5. Inhibition of binding of tritiated hormone by unlabeled PTH was also highly effective at pH 6.0, but this apparently specific binding was also inhibited by adrenocorticotropic hormone, insulin, glucagon, and vasopressin. Dissociation of bound hormone was demonstrated, and an apparent dissociation constant of 4.6 X 10(-2) min-1 was obtained. Specific binding was eliminated by pretreatment of the membranes with trypsin. The concentration dependence for inhibition of binding with unlabeled PTH was identical to that for activation of adenylate cyclase in this membrane preparation, and binding was also inhibited by concentrations of calcium in the 0.5 to 2 mM range."
https://openalex.org/W1942083149,"The formation of deoxyhemoglobin was examined by measuring the heme spectral change that accompanies the aggregation of isolated alpha and beta chains. At low hemeconcentrations (less than 10(-5) M), tetramer formation can be described by two consecutive, second order reactions representing the aggregation of monomers followed by the association of alphabeta dimers. At neutral pH, the rates of monomer and dimer aggregation are roughly the same, approximately 5 X 10(5) M(-1) X(-1) at 20 degrees. Raising or lowering the pH results in a uniform decrease of both aggregation rates due presumably to repulsion of positively charged subunits at acid pH and repulsion of negatively charged subunits at alkaline pH. Addition of p-hydroxymercuribenzoate to alpha chains lowers the rate of monomer aggregation whereas addition of mercurials to the beta subunits appears to lower both the rate of monomer and the rate of dimer aggregation. At high heme concentrations (greater than 10(-5) M) or in the presence of organic phosphates, the rate of chain aggregation becomes limited, in part, by the slow dissociation of beta chain tetramers. In the case of inositol hexaphosphate, the rate of hemoglobin formation exhibits a bell-shaped dependence on phosphate concentration. When intermediate concentrations of inositol hexaphosphate (approximately 10(-4 M) are preincubated with beta subunits, a slow first order time course is observed and exhibits a half-time of about 8 min. As more inositol hexaphosphate is added, the chain aggregation reaction begins to occur more rapidly. Eventually at about 10(-2) M inositol hexaphospate, the time course becomes almost identical to that observed in the absence of phosphates. The increase in the velocity of the chain aggregation reaction at high phosphate concentrations suggests strongly that inositol hexaphosphate binds to beta monomers and, if added in sufficiently large amounts, promotes beta4 dissociation. A quantitative analysis of these results showed that the affinity of beta monomers for inositol hexaphosphate is the same as that of alphabeta dimers. Only when tetramers are formed, either alpha2beta2 or beta4, is a marked increase in affinity for inositol hexaphosphate observed."
https://openalex.org/W1509666552,"Cultured human skin fibroblasts from normal and glucosylceramidotic subjects are found to contain one beta-glucoside hydrolase as compared with multiple enzymes in other tissues. The fibroblast enzyme has an approximate molecular weight of 150,000 under isotonic conditions, as determined by gel filtration. It occurs as a large aggregate at low ionic strength. Ceramide, 4-methylumbelliferyl, and p-nitrophenyl beta-glucosides are active as substrates. The enzyme in whole cell homogenates is membrane-bound and is solubilized by a combination of Triton X-100 and sodium taurocholate. It has a pH optimum at 4.2 and no demonstrable divalent cation requirement. The cultured fibroblast beta-glucosidase displays close similarity to one of the forms of beta-glucosidase in human spleen, specifically that form which is affected in Gaucher's disease. 4-Methylumbelliferyl beta-glucosidase activity in homozygous fibroblasts from infantile and adult forms of Gaucher's disease are reduced to 9 and 14%, respectively, of normal fibroblast activity. The residual activity in the lipidotic cells shows increased heat lability, but cannot be distinguished from that in normal cells with respect to gel exclusion properties, Michaelis constant, and pH dependence."
https://openalex.org/W1537703755,"Hydroxylamine actived guanylate cyclase in particulate fraction of cerebral cortex of rat. Activation was most remarkable in crude mitochondrial fraction. When the crude mitochondrial fraction was subjected to osmotic shock and fractionated, guanylate cyclase activity recovered in the subfractions as assayed with hydroxylamine was only one-third of the starting material. Recombination of the soluble and the particulate fractions, however, restored guanylate cyclase activity to the same level as that of the starting material. When varying quantities of the particulate and soluble fractions were combined, enzyme activity was proportional to the quantity of the soluble fraction. Heating of the soluble or particulate fraction at 55 degrees for 5 min inactivated guanylate cyclase. The heated particulate fraction markedly activated guanylate cyclase activity in the native soluble fraction, while the heated soluble fraction did not stimulate enzyme activity in the particulate. The particulate fraction preincubated with hydroxylamine at 37 degrees for 5 min followed by washing activated guanylate cyclase activity in the soluble fraction in the absence of hydroxylamine. Further fractionation of the crude mitochondrial fraction revealed that the factor(s) needed for the activation by hydroxylamine is associated with the mitochondria. The mitochondrial fraction of cerebral cortex activated guanylate cyclase in supernatant of brain, liver, or kidney in the presence of hydroxylamine. The mitochondrial fraction prepared from liver or kidney, in turn, activated soluble guanylate cyclase in brain. Activation of guanylate cyclase by hydroxylamine was compared with that of sodium azide. Azide activated guanylate cyclase in the synaptosomal soluble fraction, while hydroxylamine inhibited it. The particulate fraction preincubated with azide followed by washing did not stimulate guanylate cyclase activity in the absence of azide. The activation of guanylate cyclase by hydroxylamine is not due to a change in the concentration of the substrate GTP, Addition of hydroxylamine did not alter the apparent Km value of guanylate cyclase for GTP. Guanylate cyclase became less dependent on manganese in the presence of hydroxylamine. Thus the activation of guanylate cyclase by hydroxylamine is due to the change in the Vmax of the reaction."
https://openalex.org/W2070125078,Twelve strains of encapsulated pneumococci isolated from patients with pneumococcal disease were examined for the presence of bacteriophage. Four of the strains yielded phage lytic for a noncapsulated indicator strain of pneumococcus. Three of the newly isolated bacteriophages differ serologically from pneumococcus bacteriophages described previously. The ability to yield lytic phage was lost by two of the lysogenic pneumococcal strains on repeated subculture.
https://openalex.org/W1490213951,"Binding studies of various nucleotides to the purified coupling factor-latent ATPase from Mycobacterium phlei have been carried out using gel filtration, equilibrium dialysis, and ultrafiltration methods. The purified latent ATPase binds 3 mol of ADP per mol of the enzyme with an apparent dissociation constant of 68 muM. Binding of nucleotides occurred in the decreasing order: ADP, epsilon-ATP, epsilon-ADP, UDP, adenyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate (AMP-P(NH)P), IDP, and adenosine 5'-(alpha,beta-methylene)diphosphate (AdoP(CH2)P). AMP-P(NH)P inhibits both soluble (Ki = 77 muM) and membrane-bound latent ATPase activity. However, AMP-P(NH)P does not affect oxidative phosphorylation in membrane vesicles of M. phlei. AMP-P(NH)P exhibits one binding site per molecule of the enzyme with a dissociation constant of 71 muM. After trypsin treatment of the enzyme, the binding of ADP decreases 35%, while AMP-P(NH)P binding remains unchanged. Moreover, AMP-P(NH)P binding was not displaced by ADP. Studies with sulfhydryl agents showed that, in contrast to AMP-P(NH)P, binding of at least 1 mol of ADP requires the participation of sulfhydryl groups. The results indicate that AMP-P(NH)P and ADP do not share a common binding site and that the latent ATPase enzyme has separate sites for ATP hydrolysis and ATP synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1569108294,"There exist at least two kinds of CO-binding hemoproteins in microsomal fractions of germinating pea (Pisum sativum) seeds. One of them is cytochrome P-450 and the other is also a protoheme protein (judged from its pyridine hemochrome spectrum), which is not hitherto reported. The content of the new hemoprotein is much higher than that of cytochrome P-450 in the early stage of germination. During germination the former decreases and the latter increases. The new hemoprotein is not appreciably reduced by sodium dithionite alone within a few minutes, but, it is easily reduced by dithionite in the presence of methyl viologen and also by hydrogen peroxide when CO is present. The addition of hydrogen peroxide to pea microsomes in the absence of CO causes destruction of the hemoprotein and also decolorization of endogenous carotenoid. Destruction of these components is brought about by organic hydroperoxides independently of the presence of CO. In the presence of hydroxylamine, the addition of hydroperoxides to the microsomes results in the formation of an absorption spectrum similar to the spectra of ferrous-NO complexes of protoheme proteins. When N,N-dimethyl p-phenylenediamine is present, the reaction of pea microsomes with hydroperoxides gives a spectrum similar to that of the ferryl form of myoglobin. The reactions of the hemoprotein with hydroperoxides are inhibited by alpha,alpha'-dipyridyl and aniline, with which pea microsomes form binding spectra. The microsomes form a rather stable difference spectrum with hydroxylamine. However, the hemoprotein is destroyed when hydroxylamine is added to the microsomes in the reduced state."
https://openalex.org/W1572473809,"Electrophoretically homogeneous coupling factor 1 from spinach chloroplasts binds ADP and converts the bound ADP to bound ATP and AMP. That this transphosphorylation of enzyme-bound ADP is catalyzed by the coupling factor itself, and not be a conventional adenylate kinase which might possibly contaminate preparations of the coupling factor, is supported by the following evidence. 1. The procedure for isolatio of the coupling factor is designed to separate this large (approximately 13 S) enzyme from the smaller (4.2 S) conventional adenylate kinase of spinach chloroplasts. The conventional adenylate kinase cannot be detected in purified preparations of the coupling factor by biochemical assay or by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 2. The activity of spinach adenylate kinase is completely dependent upon magnesium ions. However, the production of bound ATP and AMP from bound ADP by the coupling factor can be assayed in the total absence of added magnesium ions or even in the presence of added EDTA. 3. Comparative studies with inhibitors show that the coupling factor can produce bound ATP from ADP under conditions where the activity of adenylate kinase is strongly inhibited. Conversely, the coupling factor is prevented from synthesizing bound ATP from ADP under other conditions where the conventional adenylate kinase has high levels of activity. 4. AMP, when added in solution to the coupling factor, does not bind to this enzyme, even in the presence of APT. Thus, it is unlikely that the appearance of AMP bound to the coupling factor after its incubation with ADP is due to the production of free AMP by contaminating adenylate kinase. These results demonstrate that the isolated, homogeneous coupling factor from spinach chloroplasts has the intrinsic capacity to perform a phosphoryl group transfer between two bound ADP molecules and thus to synthesize ATP. This reaction may have an important role in the photosynthetic production of ATP by the chloroplast, as is discussed in this communication."

It is a nonspecific endoribonuclease that can cleave rRNA, poly(U), and poly(C) to small oligonucleotides and 5'-mononucleotides. It requires monovalent cations and is inhibited by divalent cations. It is suggested that this enzyme plays a role in the decay of rRNA,under various starvation conditions and perhaps in the decay of mRNA."

https://openalex.org/W1485789521,"Streptococcus faecalis 8043 concentrates extracellular [3H]pyridoxal or [3H]pyridoxamine primarily as the corresponding 5'-phosphates. Accumulation of pyridoxamine requires an exogenous energy source and is inhibited by glycolysis inhibitors. A membrane potential is not required for transport of pyridoxamine, and an artificially generated potential does not drive uptake in this organism. Based on this and other evidence, it is concluded that S. faecalis accumulates pyridoxamine by facilitated diffusion in conjunction with trapping by pyridoxal kinase. Pyridoxamine-P is not concentrated, but equilibrates with that provided externally. Lactobacillus casei 7469 concentrates radioactivity only from pyridoxal, which appears internally as pyridoxal-P, suggesting that it too absorbs the vitamin by facilitated diffusion plus trapping. The specificity of the growth requirement of S. faecalis and L. casei for vitamin B6 parallels the specificity of the transport systems for this vitamin in these organisms. Lactobacillus delbrueckii 7469, however, which specifically requires pyridoxamine-P or pyridoxal-P for growth, accumulates both these compounds and pyridoxine-P from the medium, apparently by active transport, but not pyridoxine, pyridoxamine, or pyridoxal. While pyridoxal-P and pyridoxamine-P are interconvertible in this organism, pyridoxine-P is not further metabolized, thus accounting for the specificity of the growth requirement. These and previous results show (a) that different organisms may employ quite different transport machinery in utilization of a given external nutrient, and (b) that the specificity of the growth requirement for a given form of a vitamin frequently arises from the specificity of transport, but that internal metabolism of the compounds also plays a significant role in some organisms."

https://openalex.org/W1502250996,"The lysine-fermenting Clostridium SB4 is shown to contain a new type of beta-keto acid-degrading enzyme that converts 3-keto-5-aminohexanoate and acetyl-CoA reversibly to L-3-aminobutyryl-CoA and acetoacetate. Following the development of a sensitive radiochemical assay the enzyme was purified 175-fold to about 90% homogeneity in 44% yield. The specific activity of the purified enzyme is 44 IU/mg of protein at 30 degrees. The equilibrium constant for the forward reaction was found to be 0.68 at 30 degrees and pH 7.0, corresponding to a deltaG0' of 0.23 kcal/mol. The enzyme is highly substrate-specific. Of several substrate analogs tested in the forward and back reactions only beta-alanyl-CoA and D-3-aminobutyryl-CoA are utilized about 130% and 1.7% as fast as L-3-aminobutyryl-CoA, respectively. The product formed from beta-alanyl-CoA and acetoacetate is a neutral beta-keto acid, presumably 3-keto-5-aminopentanoic acid; its borohydride reduction product was partially characterized as a hydroxy-amino acid by various chromatographic and ion exchange methods. The activity of the purified enzyme is increased about 5-fold by addition of 0.1 mM Co2+ and to a lesser extent by Mn2+. Activity is inhibited by orthophosphate, thiol reagents, and EDTA; however, exposure of the enzyme to the latter compound prior to addition of Co2+ increases activity, presumably by removing competing divalent cations. Tracer experiments have shown that carbon atoms 1 and 2 of acetoacetate are derived from carbon atoms 1 and 2 of 3-keto-5-aminohexanoate whereas carbon atoms 3 and 4 are derived from acetyl-CoA. The amino acid moiety of 3-aminobutyryl-CoA is derived from carbon atoms 3 to 6 of 3-keto-5-aminohexanoate. Since no evidence for covalent enzyme-substrate intermediates could be obtained by the study of four possible group exchange reactions, a concerted reaction between 3-keto-5-aminohexanoate and acetyl-CoA is considered. The enzyme has a molecular weight of about 97,000 and probably contains four identical subunits. The relatively high specific activity of the enzyme in extracts of Clostridium SB4 indicates it functions in the main pathway of lysine degradation. This relatively stable enzyme provides a convenient and specific method for the quantitative estimation of nanomolar amounts of L- and D-3-aminobutyryl-CoA and beta-alanyl-CoA."
https://openalex.org/W1665801610,"Treatment of Escherichia coli formylmethionine tRNA with 2 M sodium bisulfite, pH 7.0, in 10 mM MgCl2 at 25 degrees results in formation of uridine/bisulfite adducts at U18 in the dihydrouridine loop, U37 in the anticodon, and U48 in the variable loop. Two products, corresponding to the two diastereoisomers of 5,6-dihydrouridine-6-sulfonate, are formed at each reactive site in the tRNA. Although none of the modifications cause complete loss of methionine acceptor activity, the modified tRNA is amino-acylated at a reduced rate and has a decreased affinity for E. coli methionyl-tRNA synthetase. Aminoacylation of [35S]bisulfite-labeled tRNAfMet with a limiting amount of purified enzyme followed by separation of the acylated and unacylated molecules and structural analysis has shown that the presence of a specific diastereoisomer of the uridine/bisulfite adduct in the anticodon base U37 alters the kinetic parameters for aminoacylation of tRNAfMet."
https://openalex.org/W1600283911,"Bovine kidney plasma membranes containing parathyroid hormone-sensitive adenylate cyclase activity were dispersed with 1% Triton X-100 and centrifuged at 150,000 X g for 2 h. Approximately 40% of the total membrane protein was extracted by this procedure. The extraction greatly reduces the fluoride-stimulated and the parathyroid hormone-sensitive adenylate cyclase activity of the membranes and yields a supernatnat which binds biologically active, tritiated parathyroid hormone. Hormone binding is stable for up to 15 h and has a linear dependence on protein concentration in the extract. Binding of the labeled hormone at concentrations of 5 to 10 nM is inhibited by preincubation with unlabeled min, and displays a dependence on temperature, time, and pH. Binding specificity is maximal at physiological pH, being inhibited by only the native hormone or its synthetic 1-34 NH2-terminal, biologically active fragment. Binding increases dramatically at pH 6.0, but is nonspecific in character. Half-maximal inhibition of the binding was achieved at 3.2 X 10(-7) M concentrations of the native hormone and 5.0 X 10(-7) M concentrations of the synthetic 1-34 NH2-terminal fragment. Calcium does not inhibit either total or specific binding. Inhibition, kinetic, and pH dependence data suggest that the extracted component(s) represent the parathyroid hormone binding protein(s) formerly identified in particulate membrane preparations."
https://openalex.org/W1522570444,"The latency of inosine-5'-diphosphatase has been studied in microsomes isolated from rat liver. The appearance of latent activity was the result of an increase in the Vmax of the enzyme. This was observed when assays were carried out in the presence of sodium deoxycholate, after microsomes were treated wtih phospholipase C, or at pH 10.3 and after microsomes were subjected to nitrogen cavitation. The apparent Km of inosine-5'-diphosphatase for IDP was unchanged when microsomes were treated with phospholipase C or at pH 10.3 after both these treatments approximately 85% of the enzyme remained bound to the membrane. In contrast, when microsomes were treated with phospholipase C or at pH 10.3 after both these treatments approximately 85% of the enzyme remained bound to the membrane. In contrast, when microsomes were treated with sodium deoxycholate or subjected to nitrogen cavitation, approximately 75% of the inosine-5'-diphosphatase activity was released from the membrane, and the apparent Km of the enzyme for IDP increased 4- and 2-fold, respectively. Microsomal cisternae were loaded with lead phosphate by incubation with glucose-6-P and Pb2+, and the release of this lead phosphate following the addition of EDTA to the medium was determined to estimate the permeability of the microsomal membrane. When microsomes were treated with sodium deoxycholate, phospholipase C, or at alkaline pH, the microsomal membrane became almost completely permeable to EDTA under conditions where there was little or no increase in the activity of inosine-5'-diphosphatase. Microsomes were treated at pH 10.3 and then adjusted slowly to pH 7.5. The activity of inosine-5'-diphosphatase decreased to the same activity observed in untreated preparations. The results seem of exclude the possibility that latent inosine-5'-diphosphatase activity is the result of an increased permeability of the membrane to IDP. They are, however, consistent with the presence of a noncompetitive inhibitor of the enzyme in the microsomal membrane."

The tissue contains a single isozyme of adenylate kinase, the enzyme from cytoplasmic and mitochondrial compartments (90 and 10% of total activity, respectively) being identical in physical and kinetic properties. Molecular weight was found to be 27,000 +/- 400. The enzyme shows a pH optimum of 8.2 in the forward (APD utilizing) and 7.4 in the reverse direction. Michaelis constants for ADP, ATP, and AMP are 0.70, 0.13, and 0.15 mM, respectively, with optimal Mg2+:adenylate ratios being 1:2 for ADP and 1:1 for ATP. A comparison of mass action ratios with the equilibrium constant indicated that squid adenylate kinase is held out of equilibrium in resting, but not active, muscle. A search for metabolic modulators of adenylate kinase revealed that NADH (Ki of 0.1 mM) was the only modulator which exerted a significant effect within its in vivo concentration range. The data presented indicate that NADH inhibition is the factor maintaining adenylate kinase in a nonequilibrium state in resting muscle and that release of this inhibition can serve to integrate adenylate kinase into the known scheme of intermediary metabolism in this tissue. A sharp drop in NADH levels at the onset on muscular work co-ordinates that activation of aerobic metabolism in this tissue and allows adenylate kinase to return to equilibrium function. At equilibrium, the enzyme can function to ampligy the concentration of AMP, a potent activator and deinhibitor of key glycolytic and Krebs cycle enzymes. The effect of modulators of adenylate kinase in preventing denaturation by heat or proteolysis revealed that NADH and substrates induced conformational changes in the enzyme which rendered it less susceptible to denaturation. The conformation state induced by NADH differed from that induced by substrate."
