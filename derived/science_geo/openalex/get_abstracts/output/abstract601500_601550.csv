https://openalex.org/W2777786283,"Cellular senescence is a stress-responsive cell-cycle arrest program that terminates the further expansion of (pre-)malignant cells. Key signalling components of the senescence machinery, such as p16INK4a, p21CIP1 and p53, as well as trimethylation of lysine 9 at histone H3 (H3K9me3), also operate as critical regulators of stem-cell functions (which are collectively termed 'stemness'). In cancer cells, a gain of stemness may have profound implications for tumour aggressiveness and clinical outcome. Here we investigated whether chemotherapy-induced senescence could change stem-cell-related properties of malignant cells. Gene expression and functional analyses comparing senescent and non-senescent B-cell lymphomas from Eμ-Myc transgenic mice revealed substantial upregulation of an adult tissue stem-cell signature, activated Wnt signalling, and distinct stem-cell markers in senescence. Using genetically switchable models of senescence targeting H3K9me3 or p53 to mimic spontaneous escape from the arrested condition, we found that cells released from senescence re-entered the cell cycle with strongly enhanced and Wnt-dependent clonogenic growth potential compared to virtually identical populations that had been equally exposed to chemotherapy but had never been senescent. In vivo, these previously senescent cells presented with a much higher tumour initiation potential. Notably, the temporary enforcement of senescence in p53-regulatable models of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and acute myeloid leukaemia was found to reprogram non-stem bulk leukaemia cells into self-renewing, leukaemia-initiating stem cells. Our data, which are further supported by consistent results in human cancer cell lines and primary samples of human haematological malignancies, reveal that senescence-associated stemness is an unexpected, cell-autonomous feature that exerts its detrimental, highly aggressive growth potential upon escape from cell-cycle blockade, and is enriched in relapse tumours. These findings have profound implications for cancer therapy, and provide new mechanistic insights into the plasticity of cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2774168073,"Plants intimately associate with diverse bacteria. Plant-associated bacteria have ostensibly evolved genes that enable them to adapt to plant environments. However, the identities of such genes are mostly unknown, and their functions are poorly characterized. We sequenced 484 genomes of bacterial isolates from roots of Brassicaceae, poplar, and maize. We then compared 3,837 bacterial genomes to identify thousands of plant-associated gene clusters. Genomes of plant-associated bacteria encode more carbohydrate metabolism functions and fewer mobile elements than related non-plant-associated genomes do. We experimentally validated candidates from two sets of plant-associated genes: one involved in plant colonization, and the other serving in microbe-microbe competition between plant-associated bacteria. We also identified 64 plant-associated protein domains that potentially mimic plant domains; some are shared with plant-associated fungi and oomycetes. This work expands the genome-based understanding of plant-microbe interactions and provides potential leads for efficient and sustainable agriculture through microbiome engineering."
https://openalex.org/W2780388729,"Carbon stocks in vegetation have a key role in the climate system. However, the magnitude, patterns and uncertainties of carbon stocks and the effect of land use on the stocks remain poorly quantified. Here we show, using state-of-the-art datasets, that vegetation currently stores around 450 petagrams of carbon. In the hypothetical absence of land use, potential vegetation would store around 916 petagrams of carbon, under current climate conditions. This difference highlights the massive effect of land use on biomass stocks. Deforestation and other land-cover changes are responsible for 53-58% of the difference between current and potential biomass stocks. Land management effects (the biomass stock changes induced by land use within the same land cover) contribute 42-47%, but have been underestimated in the literature. Therefore, avoiding deforestation is necessary but not sufficient for mitigation of climate change. Our results imply that trade-offs exist between conserving carbon stocks on managed land and raising the contribution of biomass to raw material and energy supply for the mitigation of climate change. Efforts to raise biomass stocks are currently verifiable only in temperate forests, where their potential is limited. By contrast, large uncertainties hinder verification in the tropical forest, where the largest potential is located, pointing to challenges for the upcoming stocktaking exercises under the Paris agreement."
https://openalex.org/W2778806019,"Although genetic factors contribute to almost half of all cases of deafness, treatment options for genetic deafness are limited. We developed a genome-editing approach to target a dominantly inherited form of genetic deafness. Here we show that cationic lipid-mediated in vivo delivery of Cas9-guide RNA complexes can ameliorate hearing loss in a mouse model of human genetic deafness. We designed and validated, both in vitro and in primary fibroblasts, genome editing agents that preferentially disrupt the dominant deafness-associated allele in the Tmc1 (transmembrane channel-like gene family 1) Beethoven (Bth) mouse model, even though the mutant Tmc1Bth allele differs from the wild-type allele at only a single base pair. Injection of Cas9-guide RNA-lipid complexes targeting the Tmc1Bth allele into the cochlea of neonatal Tmc1Bth/+ mice substantially reduced progressive hearing loss. We observed higher hair cell survival rates and lower auditory brainstem response thresholds in injected ears than in uninjected ears or ears injected with control complexes that targeted an unrelated gene. Enhanced acoustic startle responses were observed among injected compared to uninjected Tmc1Bth/+ mice. These findings suggest that protein-RNA complex delivery of target gene-disrupting agents in vivo is a potential strategy for the treatment of some types of autosomal-dominant hearing loss."
https://openalex.org/W2779962245,"Piezo1 and Piezo2 are mechanically activated ion channels that mediate touch perception, proprioception and vascular development. Piezo proteins are distinct from other ion channels and their structure remains poorly defined, which impedes detailed study of their gating and ion permeation properties. Here we report a high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy structure of the mouse Piezo1 trimer. The detergent-solubilized complex adopts a three-bladed propeller shape with a curved transmembrane region containing at least 26 transmembrane helices per protomer. The flexible propeller blades can adopt distinct conformations, and consist of a series of four-transmembrane helical bundles that we term Piezo repeats. Carboxy-terminal domains line the central ion pore, and the channel is closed by constrictions in the cytosol. A kinked helical beam and anchor domain link the Piezo repeats to the pore, and are poised to control gating allosterically. The structure provides a foundation to dissect further how Piezo channels are regulated by mechanical force."
https://openalex.org/W2740637836,"Neuroticism is a relatively stable personality trait characterized by negative emotionality (for example, worry and guilt)1; heritability estimated from twin studies ranges from 30 to 50%2, and SNP-based heritability ranges from 6 to 15%3–6. Increased neuroticism is associated with poorer mental and physical health7,8, translating to high economic burden9. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of neuroticism have identified up to 11 associated genetic loci3,4. Here we report 116 significant independent loci from a GWAS of neuroticism in 329,821 UK Biobank participants; 15 of these loci replicated at P < 0.00045 in an unrelated cohort (N = 122,867). Genetic signals were enriched in neuronal genesis and differentiation pathways, and substantial genetic correlations were found between neuroticism and depressive symptoms (rg = 0.82, standard error (s.e.) = 0.03), major depressive disorder (MDD; rg = 0.69, s.e. = 0.07) and subjective well-being (rg = –0.68, s.e. = 0.03) alongside other mental health traits. These discoveries significantly advance understanding of neuroticism and its association with MDD. Analysis of 329,000 individuals in the UK Biobank identifies 116 loci associated with neuroticism. Genes implicated are enriched in neuronal differentiation pathways, and genetic correlations between neuroticism and other mental health traits are elucidated."
https://openalex.org/W2774047286,"The observed electromagnetic emission from GW170817 suggests that a ‘cocoon’ of mildly relativistic material was released as a jet transferred its energy to the neutron-rich dynamical ejecta from the merger. On 17 August 2017, the detection of a gravitational-wave signature of merging neutron stars preceded that of a weak, short γ-ray burst. The source was quickly localized to the galaxy NGC 4993, and a range of telescopes measuring different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum followed the source, which was fading at most wavelengths. The radio emission, however, has continued to increase. Kunal Mooley and colleagues report continuing radio observations that are inconsistent with the off-axis relativistic jet that was initially believed to explain the optical, X-ray and γ-ray data. Instead, the radio data are best explained by a mildly relativistic wide-angle outflow. GW170817 was the first gravitational-wave detection of a binary neutron-star merger1. It was accompanied by radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum and localized2 to the galaxy NGC 4993 at a distance of 40 megaparsecs. It has been proposed that the observed γ-ray, X-ray and radio emission is due to an ultra-relativistic jet being launched during the merger (and successfully breaking out of the surrounding material), directed away from our line of sight (off-axis)3,4,5,6. The presence of such a jet is predicted from models that posit neutron-star mergers as the drivers of short hard-γ-ray bursts7,8. Here we report that the radio light curve of GW170817 has no direct signature of the afterglow of an off-axis jet. Although we cannot completely rule out the existence of a jet directed away from the line of sight, the observed γ-ray emission could not have originated from such a jet. Instead, the radio data require the existence of a mildly relativistic wide-angle outflow moving towards us. This outflow could be the high-velocity tail of the neutron-rich material that was ejected dynamically during the merger, or a cocoon of material that breaks out when a jet launched during the merger transfers its energy to the dynamical ejecta. Because the cocoon model explains the radio light curve of GW170817, as well as the γ-ray and X-ray emission (and possibly also the ultraviolet and optical emission)9,10,11,12,13,14,15, it is the model that is most consistent with the observational data. Cocoons may be a ubiquitous phenomenon produced in neutron-star mergers, giving rise to a hitherto unidentified population of radio, ultraviolet, X-ray and γ-ray transients in the local Universe."

https://openalex.org/W2777934057,"Calcium-selective transient receptor potential vanilloid subfamily member 6 (TRPV6) channels play a critical role in calcium uptake in epithelial tissues. Altered TRPV6 expression is associated with a variety of human diseases, including cancers. TRPV6 channels are constitutively active and their open probability depends on the lipidic composition of the membrane in which they reside; it increases substantially in the presence of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. Crystal structures of detergent-solubilized rat TRPV6 in the closed state have previously been solved. Corroborating electrophysiological results, these structures demonstrated that the Ca2+ selectivity of TRPV6 arises from a ring of aspartate side chains in the selectivity filter that binds Ca2+ tightly. However, how TRPV6 channels open and close their pores for ion permeation has remained unclear. Here we present cryo-electron microscopy structures of human TRPV6 in the open and closed states. The channel selectivity filter adopts similar conformations in both states, consistent with its explicit role in ion permeation. The iris-like channel opening is accompanied by an α-to-π-helical transition in the pore-lining transmembrane helix S6 at an alanine hinge just below the selectivity filter. As a result of this transition, the S6 helices bend and rotate, exposing different residues to the ion channel pore in the open and closed states. This gating mechanism, which defines the constitutive activity of TRPV6, is, to our knowledge, unique among tetrameric ion channels and provides structural insights for understanding their diverse roles in physiology and disease."
https://openalex.org/W2780843582,"Genomic sequencing has driven precision-based oncology therapy; however, the genetic drivers of many malignancies remain unknown or non-targetable, so alternative approaches to the identification of therapeutic leads are necessary. Ependymomas are chemotherapy-resistant brain tumours, which, despite genomic sequencing, lack effective molecular targets. Intracranial ependymomas are segregated on the basis of anatomical location (supratentorial region or posterior fossa) and further divided into distinct molecular subgroups that reflect differences in the age of onset, gender predominance and response to therapy. The most common and aggressive subgroup, posterior fossa ependymoma group A (PF-EPN-A), occurs in young children and appears to lack recurrent somatic mutations. Conversely, posterior fossa ependymoma group B (PF-EPN-B) tumours display frequent large-scale copy number gains and losses but have favourable clinical outcomes. More than 70% of supratentorial ependymomas are defined by highly recurrent gene fusions in the NF-κB subunit gene RELA (ST-EPN-RELA), and a smaller number involve fusion of the gene encoding the transcriptional activator YAP1 (ST-EPN-YAP1). Subependymomas, a distinct histologic variant, can also be found within the supratetorial and posterior fossa compartments, and account for the majority of tumours in the molecular subgroups ST-EPN-SE and PF-EPN-SE. Here we describe mapping of active chromatin landscapes in 42 primary ependymomas in two non-overlapping primary ependymoma cohorts, with the goal of identifying essential super-enhancer-associated genes on which tumour cells depend. Enhancer regions revealed putative oncogenes, molecular targets and pathways; inhibition of these targets with small molecule inhibitors or short hairpin RNA diminished the proliferation of patient-derived neurospheres and increased survival in mouse models of ependymomas. Through profiling of transcriptional enhancers, our study provides a framework for target and drug discovery in other cancers that lack known genetic drivers and are therefore difficult to treat."
https://openalex.org/W2774699268,"Enhancers act to regulate cell-type-specific gene expression by facilitating the transcription of target genes. In mammalian cells, active or primed enhancers are commonly marked by monomethylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me1) in a cell-type-specific manner. Whether and how this histone modification regulates enhancer-dependent transcription programs in mammals is unclear. In this study, we conducted SILAC mass spectrometry experiments with mononucleosomes and identified multiple H3K4me1-associated proteins, including many involved in chromatin remodeling. We demonstrate that H3K4me1 augments association of the chromatin-remodeling complex BAF to enhancers in vivo and that, in vitro, H3K4me1-marked nucleosomes are more efficiently remodeled by the BAF complex. Crystal structures of the BAF component BAF45C indicate that monomethylation, but not trimethylation, is accommodated by BAF45C’s H3K4-binding site. Our results suggest that H3K4me1 has an active role at enhancers by facilitating binding of the BAF complex and possibly other chromatin regulators. The authors conduct mass spectrometry experiments identifying H3K4me1-associated proteins, including members of the BAF chromatin-remodeling complex. They show that H3K4me1 augments association of the BAF complex with enhancers in vivo and that H3K4me1-marked nucleosomes are more efficiently remodeled by the BAF complex in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W2780809400,"Understanding global patterns of biodiversity change is crucial for conservation research, policies and practices. However, for most ecosystems, the lack of systematically collected data at a global level limits our understanding of biodiversity changes and their local-scale drivers. Here we address this challenge by focusing on wetlands, which are among the most biodiverse and productive of any environments and which provide essential ecosystem services, but are also amongst the most seriously threatened ecosystems. Using birds as an indicator taxon of wetland biodiversity, we model time-series abundance data for 461 waterbird species at 25,769 survey sites across the globe. We show that the strongest predictor of changes in waterbird abundance, and of conservation efforts having beneficial effects, is the effective governance of a country. In areas in which governance is on average less effective, such as western and central Asia, sub-Saharan Africa and South America, waterbird declines are particularly pronounced; a higher protected area coverage of wetland environments facilitates waterbird increases, but only in countries with more effective governance. Our findings highlight that sociopolitical instability can lead to biodiversity loss and undermine the benefit of existing conservation efforts, such as the expansion of protected area coverage. Furthermore, data deficiencies in areas with less effective governance could lead to underestimations of the extent of the current biodiversity crisis."
https://openalex.org/W3100032050,"DNA methylation regulates eukaryotic gene expression and is extensively reprogrammed during animal development. However, whether developmental methylation reprogramming during the sporophytic life cycle of flowering plants regulates genes is presently unknown. Here we report a distinctive gene-targeted RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) activity in the Arabidopsis thaliana male sexual lineage that regulates gene expression in meiocytes. Loss of sexual-lineage-specific RdDM causes mis-splicing of the MPS1 gene (also known as PRD2), thereby disrupting meiosis. Our results establish a regulatory paradigm in which de novo methylation creates a cell-lineage-specific epigenetic signature that controls gene expression and contributes to cellular function in flowering plants."
https://openalex.org/W2772547114,"Application of an electric field changes the transport and optical properties of samarium nickelate submerged in water, making it a suitable passive sensor of weak electric fields in salt water. Detecting and measuring electric fields in salt water requires materials that do not corrode across a wide range of acidities, temperatures and salt concentrations, yet are not completely inert so that measurable property changes occur in response to electrical signals. Now, Shriram Ramanathan and colleagues show that, in the presence of an electric field, proton insertion into samarium nickelate (SmNiO3) from water (with reduction of Ni) is accompanied by drastic changes in the transport and optical properties of the material. This enables very weak electric fields to be detected, owing to the change in resistivity of SmNiO3. Because it is also stable against salt water and in acidic and basic conditions, the authors propose that SmNiO3 could be used as a passive sensor for weak electric and bioelectric signals in oceanic environments. Designing materials to function in harsh environments, such as conductive aqueous media, is a problem of broad interest to a range of technologies, including energy, ocean monitoring and biological applications1,2,3,4. The main challenge is to retain the stability and morphology of the material as it interacts dynamically with the surrounding environment. Materials that respond to mild stimuli through collective phase transitions and amplify signals could open up new avenues for sensing. Here we present the discovery of an electric-field-driven, water-mediated reversible phase change in a perovskite-structured nickelate, SmNiO35,6,7. This prototypical strongly correlated quantum material is stable in salt water, does not corrode, and allows exchange of protons with the surrounding water at ambient temperature, with the concurrent modification in electrical resistance and optical properties being capable of multi-modal readout. Besides operating both as thermistors and pH sensors, devices made of this material can detect sub-volt electric potentials in salt water. We postulate that such devices could be used in oceanic environments for monitoring electrical signals from various maritime vessels and sea creatures."
https://openalex.org/W2771422081,"Unlike pluripotent cells, which generate only embryonic tissues, totipotent cells can generate a full organism, including extra-embryonic tissues. A rare population of cells resembling 2-cell-stage embryos arises in pluripotent embryonic stem (ES) cell cultures. These 2-cell-like cells display molecular features of totipotency and broader developmental plasticity. However, their specific nature and the process through which they arise remain outstanding questions. Here we identified intermediate cellular states and molecular determinants during the emergence of 2-cell-like cells. By deploying a quantitative single-cell expression approach, we identified an intermediate population characterized by expression of the transcription factor ZSCAN4 as a precursor of 2-cell-like cells. By using a small interfering RNA (siRNA) screen, we identified epigenetic regulators of 2-cell-like cell emergence, including the non-canonical PRC1 complex PRC1.6 and the EP400-TIP60 complex. Our data shed light on the mechanisms that underlie exit from the ES cell state toward the formation of early-embryonic-like cells in culture and identify key epigenetic pathways that promote this transition."
https://openalex.org/W2775643473,"Abstract Mutations that add, subtract, rearrange, or otherwise refashion genome structure often affect phenotypes, although the fragmented nature of most contemporary assemblies obscures them. To discover such mutations, we assembled the first new reference-quality genome of Drosophila melanogaster since its initial sequencing. By comparing this new genome to the existing D. melanogaster assembly, we created a structural variant map of unprecedented resolution and identified extensive genetic variation that has remained hidden until now. Many of these variants constitute candidates underlying phenotypic variation, including tandem duplications and a transposable element insertion that amplifies the expression of detoxification-related genes associated with nicotine resistance. The abundance of important genetic variation that still evades discovery highlights how crucial high-quality reference genomes are to deciphering phenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W2774070426,"Mapping the three-dimensional trajectory of a Neptune-mass exoplanet across the disk of its cool star reveals that its orbit is nearly perpendicular to the stellar equator, implying the existence of a yet-undetected outer companion planet. GJ 436b is a Neptune-sized planet orbiting a cool M dwarf star. Rather unusually, it has a large exosphere—the outer layer of the atmosphere that merges into space. Vincent Bourrier and colleagues have determined the orbit of the planet to be very eccentric and almost perpendicular to the spin of its parent star, which is unusual for orbits around a cool star. Under normal conditions, the orbit of a planet is fairly closely aligned with the star's spin, as is true in the Solar System. The authors suggest that the planet was dynamically scattered into its present orbit by another—as yet unseen—planet and that its movement closer to the cool star could have caused the atmospheric escape that drives such an enormous exosphere. The angle between the spin of a star and the orbital planes of its planets traces the history of the planetary system. Exoplanets orbiting close to cool stars are expected to be on circular, aligned orbits because of strong tidal interactions with the stellar convective envelope1. Spin–orbit alignment can be measured when the planet transits its star, but such ground-based spectroscopic measurements are challenging for cool, slowly rotating stars2. Here we report the three-dimensional characterization of the trajectory of an exoplanet around an M dwarf star, derived by mapping the spectrum of the stellar photosphere along the chord transited by the planet3. We find that the eccentric orbit of the Neptune-mass exoplanet GJ 436b is nearly perpendicular to the stellar equator. Both eccentricity and misalignment, surprising around a cool star, can result from dynamical interactions (via Kozai migration4) with a yet-undetected outer companion. This inward migration of GJ 436b could have triggered the atmospheric escape that now sustains its giant exosphere5."
https://openalex.org/W2771155712,"Selenium-binding protein 1 (SELENBP1) has been associated with several cancers, although its exact role is unknown. We show that SELENBP1 is a methanethiol oxidase (MTO), related to the MTO in methylotrophic bacteria, that converts methanethiol to H2O2, formaldehyde, and H2S, an activity not previously known to exist in humans. We identified mutations in SELENBP1 in five patients with cabbage-like breath odor. The malodor was attributable to high levels of methanethiol and dimethylsulfide, the main odorous compounds in their breath. Elevated urinary excretion of dimethylsulfoxide was associated with MTO deficiency. Patient fibroblasts had low SELENBP1 protein levels and were deficient in MTO enzymatic activity; these effects were reversed by lentivirus-mediated expression of wild-type SELENBP1. Selenbp1-knockout mice showed biochemical characteristics similar to those in humans. Our data reveal a potentially frequent inborn error of metabolism that results from MTO deficiency and leads to a malodor syndrome. Ron Wevers and colleagues report that mutations in the methanethiol oxidase gene SELENBP1 cause chronic extraoral halitosis. They find that enzyme deficiency leads to increased levels of methanethiol and dimethylsulfide in the breath and that knockout mice have similar biochemical phenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W2778330153,"Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) are a class of copper-containing enzymes that oxidatively degrade insoluble plant polysaccharides and soluble oligosaccharides. Upon reductive activation, they cleave the substrate and promote biomass degradation by hydrolytic enzymes. In this study, we employed LPMO9C from Neurospora crassa, which is active toward cellulose and soluble β-glucans, to study the enzyme-substrate interaction and thermal stability. Binding studies showed that the reduction of the mononuclear active-site copper by ascorbic acid increased the affinity and the maximum binding capacity of LPMO for cellulose. The reduced redox state of the active-site copper and not the subsequent formation of the activated oxygen species increased the affinity toward cellulose. The lower affinity of oxidized LPMO could support its desorption after catalysis and allow hydrolases to access the cleavage site. It also suggests that the copper reduction is not necessarily performed in the substrate-bound state of LPMO. Differential scanning fluorimetry showed a stabilizing effect of the substrates cellulose and xyloglucan on the apparent transition midpoint temperature of the reduced, catalytically active enzyme. Oxidative auto-inactivation and destabilization were observed in the absence of a suitable substrate. Our data reveal the determinants of LPMO stability under turnover and non-turnover conditions and indicate that the reduction of the active-site copper initiates substrate binding."

https://openalex.org/W2778138625,"Introduction Innate lymphoid cells (ILC) have been implicated in the initiation of inflammation and fibrosis in mice. However, ILC have not been characterized in inflamed human liver tissue. Methods Human intrahepatic lymphocytes were isolated by mechanical digestion and phenotyped by flow cytometry. Conditioned medium from cultures of primary human biliary epithelial cells, stellate cells, fibroblasts and inflamed human liver tissue was used to model the effects of the inflammatory liver environment of ILC phenotype and function. Results All three ILC subsets were present in the human liver, with the ILC1 (CRTH2negCD117neg) subset constituting around 70% of intrahepatic ILCs. Both NCRpos (NKp44+) and NCRneg ILC3 (CRTH2negCD117pos) subsets were also detected. ILC2 (CRTH2pos) frequency correlated with disease severity measured by model of end stage liver disease (MELD) scoring leading us to study this subset in more detail. ILC2 displayed a tissue resident CD69+ CD161++ phenotype and expressed chemokine receptor CCR6 allowing them to respond to CCL20 secreted by cholangiocytes and stellate cells. ILC2 expressed integrins VLA-5 and VLA-6 and the IL-2 and IL-7 cytokine receptors CD25 and CD127 although IL-2 and IL-7 were barely detectable in inflamed liver tissue. Although biliary epithelial cells secrete IL-33, intrahepatic ILC2 had low expression of the ST2 receptor. Intrahepatic ILC2 secreted the immunoregulatory and repair cytokines IL-13 and amphiregulin. Conclusions Intrahepatic ILC2 express receptors allowing them to be recruited to bile ducts in inflamed portal tracts. Their frequencies increased with worsening liver function. Their secretion of IL-13 and amphiregulin suggests they may be recruited to promote resolution and repair and thereby they may contribute to ongoing fibrogenesis in liver disease."

It is proposed that UbiD activation requires oxidative maturation of the cofactor, for which two distinct isomers, prFMNketimine and prFMNiminium, have been observed. It also has been suggested that only the prFMNiminium form is relevant to catalysis, which requires transient cycloaddition between substrate and cofactor.

On the other hand, efficient catalysis was highly dependent on an intact Glu–Arg–Glu network, as only Glu → Asp substitutions retain activity. Surprisingly, oxidative maturation to form the prFMNiminium species is severely affected only for the R173A variant.

https://openalex.org/W2778615271,"Histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6), a class IIb HDAC, plays an important role in many biological and pathological processes. Previously, we found that ERK1, a downstream kinase in the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway, phosphorylates HDAC6, thereby increasing HDAC6-mediated deacetylation of α-tubulin. However, whether HDAC6 reciprocally modulates ERK1 activity is unknown. Here, we report that both ERK1 and -2 are acetylated and that HDAC6 promotes ERK1 activity via deacetylation. Briefly, we found that both ERK1 and -2 physically interact with HDAC6. Endogenous ERK1/2 acetylation levels increased upon treatment with a pan-HDAC inhibitor, an HDAC6-specific inhibitor, or depletion of HDAC6, suggesting that HDAC6 deacetylates ERK1/2. We also noted that the acetyltransferases CREB-binding protein and p300 both can acetylate ERK1/2. Acetylated ERK1 exhibits reduced enzymatic activity toward the transcription factor ELK1, a well-known ERK1 substrate. Furthermore, mass spectrometry analysis indicated Lys-72 as an acetylation site in the ERK1 N terminus, adjacent to Lys-71, which binds to ATP, suggesting that acetylation status of Lys-72 may affect ERK1 ATP binding. Interestingly, an acetylation-mimicking ERK1 mutant (K72Q) exhibited less phosphorylation than the WT enzyme and a deacetylation-mimicking mutant (K72R). Of note, the K72Q mutant displayed decreased enzymatic activity in an in vitro kinase assay and in a cellular luciferase assay compared with the WT and K72R mutant. Taken together, our findings suggest that HDAC6 stimulates ERK1 activity. Along with our previous report that ERK1 promotes HDAC6 activity, we propose that HDAC6 and ERK1 may form a positive feed-forward loop, which might play a role in cancer.

Interestingly, an acetylation-mimicking ERK1 mutant (K72Q) exhibited less phosphorylation than the WT enzyme and a deacetylation-mimicking mutant (K72R). Of note, the K72Q mutant displayed decreased enzymatic activity in an in vitro kinase assay and in a cellular luciferase assay compared with the WT and K72R mutant. Taken together, our findings suggest that HDAC6 stimulates ERK1 activity. Along with our previous report that ERK1 promotes HDAC6 activity, we propose that HDAC6 and ERK1 may form a positive feed-forward loop, which might play a role in cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2777778851,"Coastal habitats provide important benefits to people, including habitat for species targeted by fisheries and opportunities for tourism and recreation. Yet, such human activities also can imperil these habitats and undermine the ecosystem services they provide to people. Cumulative risk assessment provides an analytical framework for synthesizing the influence of multiple stressors across habitats and decision-support for balancing human uses and ecosystem health. To explore cumulative risk to habitats in the U.S. Northeast and Mid-Atlantic Ocean Planning regions, we apply the open-source InVEST Habitat Risk Assessment model to 13 habitats and 31 stressors in an exposure-consequence framework. In doing so, we advance the science priorities of EBM and both regional planning bodies by synthesizing the wealth of available data to improve our understanding of human uses and how they affect marine resources. We find that risk to ecosystems is greatest first, along the coast, where a large number of stressors occur in close proximity and secondly, along the continental shelf, where fewer, higher consequence activities occur. Habitats at greatest risk include soft and hard-bottom nearshore areas, tidal flats, soft-bottom shelf habitat, and rocky intertidal zones—with the degree of risk varying spatially. Across all habitats, our results indicate that rising sea surface temperatures, commercial fishing, and shipping consistently and disproportionally contribute to risk. Further, our findings suggest that management in the nearshore will require simultaneously addressing the temporal and spatial overlap as well as intensity of multiple human activities and that management in the offshore requires more targeted efforts to reduce exposure from specific threats. We offer a transparent, generalizable approach to evaluating cumulative risk to multiple habitats and illustrate the spatially heterogeneous nature of impacts along the eastern Atlantic coast and the importance of spatial scale in estimating such impacts. These results offer a valuable decision-support tool by helping to constrain the decision space, focus attention on habitats and locations at the greatest risk, and highlight effect management strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2778671674,"Spontaneous decidualization of the endometrium in response to progesterone signaling is confined to menstruating species, including humans and other higher primates. During this process, endometrial stromal cells (EnSCs) differentiate into specialized decidual cells that control embryo implantation. We subjected undifferentiated and decidualizing human EnSCs to an assay for transposase accessible chromatin with sequencing (ATAC-seq) to map the underlying chromatin changes. A total of 185,084 open DNA loci were mapped accurately in EnSCs. Altered chromatin accessibility upon decidualization was strongly associated with differential gene expression. Analysis of 1533 opening and closing chromatin regions revealed over-representation of DNA binding motifs for known decidual transcription factors (TFs) and identified putative new regulators. ATAC-seq footprint analysis provided evidence of TF binding at specific motifs. One of the largest footprints involved the most enriched motif-basic leucine zipper-as part of a triple motif that also comprised the estrogen receptor and Pax domain binding sites. Without exception, triple motifs were located within Alu elements, which suggests a role for this primate-specific transposable element (TE) in the evolution of decidual genes. Although other TEs were generally under-represented in open chromatin of undifferentiated EnSCs, several classes contributed to the regulatory DNA landscape that underpins decidual gene expression.-Vrljicak, P., Lucas, E.

https://openalex.org/W2778590979,"To test the genetic association between Japanese patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) and the previously reported POAG susceptibility loci and to perform genotype-phenotype analysis.Genetic associations for 27 SNPs from 16 loci previously linked to POAG were assessed using genome-wide SNP data of the primary cohort (565 Japanese POAG patients and 1,104 controls). Reproducibility of the assessment was tested in 607 POAG cases and 455 controls (second cohort) with a targeted genotyping approach. For POAG-associated variants, a genotype-phenotype correlation study (additive, dominant, recessive model) was performed using the objective clinical data derived from 598 eyes of 598 POAG patients.Among 27 SNPs from 16 loci previously linked to POAG, genotypes for total of 20 SNPs in 13 loci were available for targeted association study. Among 8 SNPs in 3 loci that showed at least nominal association (P < 5.00E-02) in the primary cohort, a representative SNP for each loci (rs2157719 for CDKN2B-AS1, rs33912345 for SIX6, and rs9913911 for GAS7) were selected. For these SNPs the association was found significant in both the second cohort analysis and meta-analysis. The genotype-phenotype analysis revealed significant correlations between CDKN2B-AS1 (rs2157719) and decreased intraocular pressure (β = -6.89 mmHg, P = 1.70E-04; dominant model) after multiple corrections. In addition, nominal correlation was observed between CDKN2B-AS1 (rs2157719) and optic nerve head blood flow (β = -0.54 and -0.67 arbitrary units (AU), P = 2.00E-02 and 1.39E-02), between SIX6 (rs33912345) and decreased total peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (β = -2.16 and -2.82 μm, P = 4.68E-02 and 2.40E-02, additive and recessive model, respectively) and increased optic nerve head blood flow (β = 0.44 AU, P = 2.20E-02; additive model) and between GAS7 (rs9913911) and increased cup volume (β = 0.03 mm3, P = 4.60E-02) and mean cup depth (β = 0.03 mm3, P = 4.11E-02; additive model) and decreased pattern standard deviation (β = -0.87 dB, P = 2.44E-02; dominant model).The association between SNPs near GAS7 and POAG was found in Japanese patients for the first time. Clinical characterization of the risk variants is an important step toward understanding the pathology of the disease and optimizing treatment of patients with POAG."

Notably, amphibian macrophages (Mϕs) are important to both the Fv3 infection strategies and the immune defense against this pathogen. However, the mechanisms underlying amphibian Mϕ Fv3 susceptibility and resistance remain unknown. Mϕ differentiation is mediated by signaling through the colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF-1R) which is now known to be bound not only by CSF-1, but also by the unrelated interleukin-34 (IL-34) cytokine. Pertinently, amphibian (Xenopus laevis) Mϕs differentiated by CSF-1 and IL-34 are highly susceptible and resistant to Fv3, respectively. Accordingly, in the present work, we elucidate the facets of this Mϕ Fv3 susceptibility and resistance. Because cellular resistance to viral replication is marked by expression of antiviral restriction factors, it was intuitive to find that IL-34-Mϕs possess significantly greater mRNA levels of select restriction factor genes than CSF-1-Mϕs. Xenopodinae amphibians have highly expanded repertoires of antiviral interferon (IFN) cytokine gene families, and our results indicated that in comparison with the X. laevis CSF-1-Mϕs, the IL-34-Mϕs express substantially greater transcripts of representative IFN genes, belonging to distinct gene family clades, as well as their cognate receptor genes. Finally, we demonstrate that IL-34-Mϕ–conditioned supernatants confer IFN-mediated anti-Fv3 protection to the virally susceptible X. laevis kidney (A6) cell line.

Moreover, we examined the ability of CSF-1-Mϕ– and IL-34-Mϕ–conditioned supernatants to restrict Fv3 growth in an otherwise highly Fv3-susceptible X. laevis kidney epithelial cell line (A6). We previously demonstrated that X. laevis Mϕs differentiated with IL-34 are resistant to Fv3 infection, whereas CSF-1-derived Mϕs are significantly more susceptible to this virus (5Grayfer L.

Accordingly, to examine whether CSF-1-Mϕs support greater Fv3 replication than IL-34-Mϕs, we differentiated IL-34- and CSF-1-Mϕs from X. laevis bone marrow cells, challenged them with Fv3, and assessed the viral loads and expression of Fv3 82R (immediate early, IE), Fv3 95R (delayed early, E), and Fv3 93L (late, L) genes in these respective Mϕ populations. As previously noted, CSF-1-Mϕs possessed significantly greater Fv3 loads than detected in the IL-34-Mϕs (Fig. 1A). Moreover, CSF-1-Mϕs possessed substantially greater magnitudes of Fv3-82R, -95R, and -93L gene expression than detected in IL-34-Mϕs (Fig. 1B). Of the examined Fv3 genes, 93L exhibited the greatest expression differences between CSF-1- and IL-34-Mϕ (Fig. 1B). Because our results indicated that IL-34-Mϕs are more restrictive to Fv3 infection while the expression of appropriate restriction factors is crucial to adequate cellular arrest of viral replication (24Badia R.

To examine the extent to which restriction factor expression correlates with the Fv3 susceptibility of these Mϕ populations, we examined the expression of the same panel of restriction factor–encoding genes as above, in peritonea-derived CSF-1- and IL-34-Mϕs (Fig. 2B). Of the examined genes and in comparison with peritonea-derived CSF-1-Mϕs, the peritoneal IL-34-Mϕs only expressed greater levels of apobec2 (Fig. 2B). Xenopodinae encode highly expanded repertoires of phylogenetically distinct intron containing and intronless type I and type III IFNs (ifn, ifnx, ifnl, and ifnlx, respectively (17Sang Y. Liu Q.

Accordingly, to define the possible mechanisms conferring the disparities in IL-34- and CSF-1-Mϕ-Fv3 resistance, we generated CSF-1- and IL-34-Mϕs, challenged them with Fv3, and examined their gene expression of type I and III IFNs belonging to each of the distinct clades, described in recent reports (17Sang Y.

https://openalex.org/W2779600720,"Proteolytic systems exert an important role in vertebrate muscle controlling protein turnover, recycling of amino acids (AA) or its use for energy production, as well as other functions like myogenesis. In fish, proteolytic systems are crucial for the relatively high muscle somatic index they possess, and because protein is the most important dietary component. Thus in this study, the molecular profile of proteolytic markers (calpains, cathepsins and ubiquitin-proteasome system (UbP) members) were analyzed during gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata) myogenesis in vitro and under different AA treatments. The gene expression of calpains (capn1, capn3 and capns1b) decreased progressively during myogenesis together with the proteasome member n3; whereas capn2, capns1a, capns1b and ubiquitin (ub) remained stable. Contrarily, the cathepsin D (ctsd) paralogs and E3 ubiquitin ligases mafbx and murf1, showed a significant peak in gene expression at day 8 of culture that slightly decreased afterwards. Moreover, the protein expression analyzed for selected molecules presented in general the same profile of the mRNA levels, which was confirmed by correlation analysis. These data suggest that calpains seem to be more important during proliferation, while cathepsins and the UbP system appear to be required for myogenic differentiation. Concerning the transcriptional regulation by AA, the recovery of their levels after a short starvation period did not show effects on cathepsins expression, whereas it down-regulated the expression of capn3, capns1b, mafbx, murf1 and up-regulated n3. With regards to AA deficiencies, the major changes occurred at day 2, when leucine limitation suppressed ctsb and ctsl expression. Besides at the same time, both leucine and lysine deficiencies increased the expression of mafbx and murf1 and decreased that of n3. Overall, the opposite nutritional regulation observed, especially for the UbP members, points out an efficient and complementary role of these factors that could be useful in gilthead sea bream diets optimization."

While multiple axes of sphingolipid metabolism have been investigated to delineate mechanisms regulating ulcerative colitis, the role of acid ceramidase (AC) in intestinal inflammation is yet to be characterized. Here we demonstrate that AC expression is elevated selectively in the inflammatory infiltrate in human and murine colitis. To probe for mechanistic insight into how AC up-regulation can impact intestinal inflammation, we investigated the selective loss of AC expression in the myeloid population. Using a model of intestinal epithelial injury, we demonstrate that myeloid AC conditional knockout mice exhibit impairment of neutrophil recruitment to the colon mucosa as a result of defective cytokine and chemokine production. Furthermore, the loss of myeloid AC protects from tumor incidence in colitis-associated cancer (CAC) and inhibits the expansion of neutrophils and granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells in the tumor microenvironment. Collectively, our results demonstrate a tissue-specific role for AC in regulating neutrophilic inflammation and cytokine production. We demonstrate novel mechanisms of how granulocytes are recruited to the colon that may have therapeutic potential in intestinal inflammation, IBD, and CAC—Espaillat, M. P., Snider, A.

This study aims to identify factors affecting synthesis and secretion of VLDL-TAG using the growth hormone–deficient Ames dwarf mouse model, which has reduced serum TAG. Proteomic analysis coupled with a bioinformatics-driven approach revealed that these mice express greater amounts of hepatic cathepsin B and lower amounts of liver fatty acid–binding protein (LFABP) than their wildtype littermates. siRNA-mediated knockdown of cathepsin B in McA-RH7777 cells resulted in a 39% increase in [3H]TAG associated with VLDL secretion. Cathepsin B knockdown was accompanied by a 74% increase in cellular LFABP protein levels, but only when cells were exposed to 0.4 mm oleic acid (OA) complexed to BSA.

This important physiological process helps to distribute energy-rich triglycerides to peripheral tissues and to maintain triglyceride balance within the hepatocyte. The secretion process is tightly regulated, as the development of hepatic steatosis leads to defective secretion of VLDL (1Ota T. Gayet C. Ginsberg H.N. Inhibition of apolipoprotein B100 secretion by lipid-induced hepatic endoplasmic reticulum stress in rodents.J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118 (18060040): 316-33210.1172/JCI32752Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Steatosis is characterized by the formation of triglyceride-rich lipid droplets within the cell, which may progress into non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. When triglyceride availability is high VLDL, synthesis may continue unimpeded (2Fisher E.A. The degradation of apolipoprotein B100: multiple opportunities to regulate VLDL triglyceride production by different proteolytic pathways.Biochim. Biophys.

Triglycerides are derived from the esterification of free fatty acids (FFA) to glycerol. FFA are delivered from the portal vein, chylomicron remnants, and lipolysis in adipose tissue and can be synthesized de novo in the liver (5Tiwari S. Siddiqi S.A. Intracellular trafficking and secretion of VLDL.Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2012; 32 (22517366): 1079-108610.1161/ATVBAHA.111.241471Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Import of FFA across the plasma membrane is mediated by CD36, also known as free fatty acid translocase (6Coburn C.T. Hajri T. Ibrahimi A. Abumrad N.A. Role of CD36 in membrane transport and utilization of long-chain fatty acids by different tissues.J. Mol. Neurosci. 2001; 16 (discussion 151–117) (11478366): 117-12110.1385/JMN:16:2–3:117Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). After membrane translocation, triglyceride synthesis occurs in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum membrane, where liver fatty acid–binding protein (LFABP) delivers the fatty acid substrate to avoid the detergent-like effects of non-esterified free fatty acids within the cell (7Storch J. McDermott L. Structural and functional analysis of fatty acid-binding proteins.J.

Very-low-density lipoprotein production begins with the simultaneous synthesis and translocation of apolipoprotein B100 (apoB100) on the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER). For the stability of this molecule to be maintained, initial lipidation by microsomal triglyceride transfer protein must occur in the rough ER (8Shelness G.S. Ingram M.F. Huang X.F. DeLozier J.A. Apolipoprotein B in the rough endoplasmic reticulum: translation, translocation and the initiation of lipoprotein assembly.J. Nutr. 1999; 129 (10064309): 456S-462SPubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of sufficient triglyceride, the poorly lipidated apoB100 molecule is sorted for degradation, which is the fate of most apoB100 molecules (2Fisher E.A. The degradation of apolipoprotein B100: multiple opportunities to regulate VLDL triglyceride production by different proteolytic pathways.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2012; 1821 (22342675): 778-78110.1016/j.bbalip.2012.02.001Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Thus, the availability of LFABP-delivered FFA for triglyceride synthesis in the ER represents the first line in regulating VLDL assembly. Regulation of VLDL secretion, lipolysis, and gene expression by growth hormone has been long established in vivo (9Keller U. Miles J.M. Growth hormone and lipids.Horm. Res. 1991; 36 (1806482): 36-4010.1159/000182186Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Exogenous administration of growth hormone, which has been used commercially as an anti-aging product, medically as a form of hormone replacement, and industrially for the growth of livestock, has been shown to increase VLDL secretion as well as triglyceride esterification by hepatocytes in vitro (10Elam M.B. Wilcox H.G. Solomon S.S. Heimberg M. In vivo growth hormone treatment stimulates secretion of very low density lipoprotein by the isolated perfused rat liver.Endocrinology. 1992; 131 (1446613): 2717-272210.1210/endo.131.6.1446613Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Growth hormone increases triglyceride availability for VLDL synthesis, as both VLDL secretion and cellular triglyceride content increase in parallel (11Frick F. Lindén D. Améen C. Edén S. Mode A. Oscarsson J. Interaction between growth hormone and insulin in the regulation of lipoprotein metabolism in the rat.Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol.

The exact molecular mechanism by which exogenous growth hormone regulates fatty acid availability for triglyceride synthesis has not been established and warrants further study due to the importance of this process in maintaining lipid homeostasis. Interestingly, cathepsin B knockout mice are resistant to diet-induced hepatic steatosis (12Feldstein A.E. Werneburg N.W. Canbay A. Guicciardi M.E. Bronk S.F. Rydzewski R. Burgart L.J. Gores G.J.

Despite being initially characterized as a lysosomal protease, cytosolic localization of cathepsin B in response to oleic acid and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) in a Bax-dependent manner has been observed (13Feldstein A.E.

Liver Physiol. 2006; 290 (16484678): G1339-G134610.1152/ajpgi.00509.2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). This suggests an intimate relationship between the cytosolic activity of cathepsin B and VLDL secretion, as both processes depend upon hepatic free fatty acid flux. Compounding the blatant nature of this association is the fact that cytosolic localization of cathepsin B correlates with disease severity in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (12Feldstein A.E. Werneburg N.W. Canbay A. Guicciardi M.E. Bronk S.F. Rydzewski R. Burgart L.J. Gores G.J. Free fatty acids promote hepatic lipotoxicity by stimulating TNF-α expression via a lysosomal pathway.Hepatology. 2004; 40 (15239102): 185-19410.1002/hep.20283Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that in this population, decreased hepatic cathepsin B levels accompany increased serum triglycerides, suggesting a role for cathepsin B in worsening dyslipidemia. Cathepsin B has also been described previously as the β-secretase responsible for cleaving amyloid precursor protein in Alzheimer’s disease, which provided insight into possible targets of cathepsin B degradation (12Feldstein A.E. Werneburg N.W. Canbay A. Guicciardi M.E. Bronk S.F. Rydzewski R. Burgart L.J. Gores G.J. Free fatty acids promote hepatic lipotoxicity by stimulating TNF-α expression via a lysosomal pathway.Hepatology. 2004; 40 (15239102): 185-19410.1002/hep.20283Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar, 14Hook V.

After cross-referencing this sequence with the VLDL transport vesicle (VTV) proteome, we identified LFABP as a candidate protein that may be regulated by cathepsin B cleavage (15Rahim A. Nafi-valencia E. Siddiqi S. Basha R. Runyon C.C. Siddiqi S.A. Proteomic analysis of the very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) transport vesicles.J. Proteomics. 2012; 75 (22449872): 2225-223510.1016/j.jprot.2012.01.026Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In the present study, we sought to identify the mechanism by which growth hormone regulates triglyceride availability for VLDL synthesis in vitro. Ames dwarf mice lack an anterior pituitary gland and growth hormone secretion due to a naturally occurring mutation in the prop-1 gene (16Brown-Borg H.M. Borg K.E. Meliska C.J. Bartke A. Dwarf mice and the ageing process.Nature. 1996; 384 (8900272): 3310.1038/384033a0Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar). This deficiency of growth hormone leads to reduced VLDL triglyceride secretion compared with wildtype littermates (17Masternak M.M. Bartke A. Growth hormone, inflammation and aging.Pathobiol. Aging Age Relat. Dis. 2012; 2 (22953033)10.3402/pba.v2i0.17293PubMed Google Scholar), which makes the model an exceptional candidate for identifying factors that relate growth hormone to VLDL secretion. To identify proteins that may be related to reduced VLDL secretion, we performed two-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) analysis of hepatocyte whole-cell lysates isolated from Ames dwarf mice compared with their wildtype littermates. Our data indicate that Ames dwarf mouse liver expresses greater amounts of cathepsin B and less LFABP than wildtype littermates. With this information, we proceeded to examine the role of cathepsin B in VLDL secretion and regulation of FFA-trafficking protein expression in rat hepatoma cells (McA-RH7777 cells) in vitro. We report that cathepsin B regulates FFA availability for triglyceride synthesis by degradation of LFABP and regulation of CD36 expression, which occurs in conjunction with oleic acid exposure. This in turn regulates the rate of VLDL secretion in an oleic acid–dependent manner. In an attempt to identify factors that affect synthesis and secretion of VLDL-TAG, we decided to use the Ames dwarf mice because these growth hormone–deficient mice have reduced serum TAG along with increased hepatic TAG levels (18Wang Z. Al-Regaiey K.A. Masternak M.M. Bartke A. Adipocytokines and lipid levels in Ames dwarf and calorie-restricted mice.J. Gerontol. A Biol. Sci. Med. Sci. 2006; 61 (16611697): 323-33110.1093/gerona/61.4.323Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). We first sought to identify proteins that were differentially expressed in Ames dwarf mice livers that could explain their reduced VLDL secretion and serum TAG when compared with their wildtype littermates. Differential analysis of protein expression in Ames dwarf mice livers was performed by 2D-DIGE against matched samples from their wildtype littermates. Cy3 dye (green) was used to label Ames dwarf whole-cell lysates, and wildtype samples were labeled with Cy5 dye (red). Of several proteins that were uniquely or highly expressed in Ames dwarf mice, we identified a protein spot (white circle; Fig. 1) at ∼25 kDa with an isoelectric point of 5.0–5.5, which was putatively identified as cathepsin B by cross-referencing with the ExPASy protein data bank. This protein was of particular interest because of its relevance to the current study. Our results indicate that Ames dwarf liver (Fig. 1) expresses greater amounts of cathepsin B than wildtype littermates. We validated this observation with immunoblot analysis, which shows 227% increased expression of cathepsin B in (df/df) whole cell lysates when compared with wildtype littermates (Fig. 2, A and B). We decided to further investigate the potential role of cathepsin B in regulating VLDL assembly due to its robust expression in the liver of Ames dwarf mice and previous studies indicating that cathepsin B knockout mice are resistant to diet-induced hepatic steatosis (19Guicciardi M.E. Miyoshi H. Bronk S.F. Gores G.J. Cathepsin B knockout mice are resistant to tumor necrosis factor-α-mediated hepatocyte apoptosis and liver injury: implications for therapeutic applications.Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 159 (11733355): 2045-205410.1016/S0002-9440(10)63056-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the previously reported phenotype of reduced VLDL secretion may be in part due to increased expression of cathepsin B, leading to decreased expression of VLDL and FFA trafficking proteins as a result of cathepsin B cleavage. Interestingly, we observed a 56% decrease in expression of the FFA-trafficking protein LFABP in (df/df) hepatocyte whole-cell lysates when compared with wildtype littermates (Fig. 2, A and B). Previous studies have established that cathepsin B cleaves the proteins at the Val-Lys-Met (VKM) sequence in vitro (14Hook V. Funkelstein L. Wegrzyn J. Bark S. Kindy M. Hook G. Cysteine cathepsins in the secretory vesicle produce active peptides: cathepsin L generates peptide neurotransmitters and cathepsin B produces β-amyloid of Alzheimer's disease.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2012; 1824 (21925292): 89-10410.1016/j.bbapap.2011.08.015Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Our laboratory has previously published a comprehensive proteomic analysis of the VTV (15Rahim A. Nafi-valencia E. Siddiqi S. Basha R. Runyon C.C. Siddiqi S.A. Proteomic analysis of the very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) transport vesicles.J. Proteomics. 2012; 75 (22449872): 2225-223510.1016/j.jprot.2012.01.026Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), which was used to compile a list of relevant proteins containing this sequence, which were all retrieved from the UniProt protein data bank. We were able to identify the VKM cleavage sequence within LFABP (Fig. 2C), a protein that has been implicated in trafficking fatty acids to the ER from the cell surface receptor CD36, also known as FFA translocase (20Storch J. Corsico B. The emerging functions and mechanisms of mammalian fatty acid-binding proteins.Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2008; 28 (18435590): 73-9510.1146/annurev.nutr.27.061406.093710Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). It is well-established that apoB translation occurs at a somewhat steady rate and that apoB stability depends upon ER TAG availability (5Tiwari S. Siddiqi S.A. Intracellular trafficking and secretion of VLDL.Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2012; 32 (22517366): 1079-108610.1161/ATVBAHA.111.241471Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Thus, we proposed a mechanism in which cathepsin B restricts the flow of FFA to the ER for TAG synthesis by cleavage of LFABP. This would lead to reduced VLDL secretion by limiting ER TAG availability. This observation provides a potential mechanistic basis for the observed decrease in VLDL secretion seen in Ames dwarf mice as well as the increased rate of TAG esterification and VLDL secretion induced by GH administration. These observations may also provide insight into the role of the cathepsin B in the progress of NAFLD from simple steatosis by disrupting normal secretion of VLDL and uptake of FFA. To substantiate this hypothesis, we wanted to determine whether genetic knockdown of cathepsin B would lead to increased LFABP protein levels. Treatment with cathepsin B–specific siRNA delivered by Lipofectamine resulted in an 80% decrease in expression of the cathepsin B protein when compared with whole-cell lysates from control siRNA–treated cells (Fig. 3, A and B). Under the conditions of cathepsin B knockdown in McA-RH7777 cells, 1 h of 0.4 mm OA complexed with BSA treatment led to a 74% increase in levels of LFABP protein when compared with control siRNA–treated cells (Fig. 3, A and B). The observed difference in LFABP protein levels was not observed when cells were deprived of oleic acid stimulation (data not shown). This provides evidence for a mechanism in which cathepsin B cleavage of cytosolic LFABP occurs in an oleic acid–dependent manner. A pulse-labeling approach was used to determine whether cathepsin B knockdown increases VLDL secretion. We tested this under the conditions of treatment with 0.4 mm OA complexed with BSA for 24 h as well as treatment with 0.2 mm BSA alone in PBS to analyze the impact of cathepsin B knockdown under conditions of elevated and reduced FFA availability, respectively. Interestingly, McA-RH7777 cells treated with 0.4 mm OA complexed with BSA for 24 h and cathepsin B–specific siRNA express a 70% greater amount of the cell surface FFA translocase CD36 when compared with OA-treated cells transfected with control siRNA (Fig. 3, C and D). Without pretreatment with 0.4 mm OA complexed with BSA, cathepsin B knockdown alone resulted in a 31.5% increase in CD36 expression relative to control siRNA (Fig. 3, C and D). Under conditions of OA pretreatment and cathepsin B knockdown, we observed a 39% increase in TAG secretion into the medium after 1 h when compared with control siRNA (Fig. 4A) as measured by [3H]TAG dpm counting. The observed increase in [3H]TAG was maintained above 20% through the 2-, 4-, and 6-h time points (Fig. 4A). Without 24-h OA pretreatment, we observed a 15% increase in TAG secretion after 1 h relative to the control siRNA (Fig. 4A), which remained above 10% through the 2-, 4-, and 6-h time points but did not meet statistical significance. We then sought to determine whether the increase in TAG secretion observed under conditions of cathepsin B knockdown was due to an increased number of VLDL particles secreted. The VLDL particle contains only one apoB molecule, whereas TAG content may vary slightly (21Elovson J. Chatterton J.E. Bell G.T. Schumaker V.N. Reuben M.A. Puppione D.L. Reeve Jr., J.R. Young N.L. Plasma very low density lipoproteins contain a single molecule of apolipoprotein B.J. Lipid Res. 1988; 29 (3241122): 1461-1473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As such, the number of VLDL particles secreted will be proportional to apoB secretion. Medium time points analyzed in the pulse-labeling experiment were subjected to immunoblotting, and the results show that cathepsin B knockdown resulted in a 115% increase in secretion of apoB into the medium relative to cells treated with control siRNA at the 1-h time point (Fig. 4B), which was consistent across the remaining time points. These results indicate that cathepsin B knockdown leads to an increased number of VLDL secreted from McA-RH7777 cells, which is in line with our proposed mechanism. With this established, we sought to determine to what extent cathepsin B knockdown would impact cellular TAG content in McA-RH7777 cells after the 24-h chase period. An equal mass of whole-cell lysate (50 μg) from knockdown and control siRNA–treated samples was subjected to TAG extraction, and the final organic phase containing TAG was analyzed by [3H]TAG dpm counting. Cathepsin B knockdown resulted in a 32% decrease in cellular [3H]TAG content after a 1-h chase period (Fig. 4C). This result is expected and occurs as a result of increased VLDL-TAG secretion, which was observed under these conditions (Fig. 4, A and B). These data suggest that the observed increase in VLDL secretion is a result of increased LFABP and CD36 levels (Fig. 3, A–D), secondary to cathepsin B knockdown. This promotes greater FFA availability for TAG synthesis in the ER, which leads to increased stability of nascent VLDL, resulting in increased secretion of VLDL. This process occurred in an oleic acid–dependent manner, suggesting cleavage of LFABP that requires translocation of cathepsin B from the lysosome. To increase our confidence in the proposed mechanism, we decided to overexpress cathepsin B in McA-RH7777 cells. We optimized an overexpression protocol using the pCI-Neo vector containing the cathepsin B gene insert. After transfection with the plasmid-containing insert, we observed a significant (240%) increase in cathepsin B expression relative to control cells transfected with the empty vector (Fig. 5, A and B). To determine the effects of cathepsin B overexpression on LFABP and CD36, we treated McA-RH7777 cells (cathepsin B–overexpressing and control) with 0.4 mm OA complexed with BSA for 1 h and carried out immunoblotting. Our immunoblot analysis of McA-RH7777 whole-cell lysates clearly indicated that cells that were overexpressing cathepsin B and treated with 0.4 mm OA complexed with BSA for 1 h expressed significantly less LFABP than control cells treated similarly and expressing only the empty vector (Fig. 5, A and B). The same conditions resulted in significantly decreased CD36 expression (Fig. 5, A and B). We speculated that cells overexpressing cathepsin B would secrete a reduced VLDL as a result of decreased FFA uptake and TAG synthesis. We performed a similar pulse-labeling protocol as was described for siRNA treatment, with the exception of withholding 24-h OA-BSA pretreatment. Secretion of TAG into the medium was decreased by 24% after 2 h in cells overexpressing cathepsin B, as measured by [3H]TAG dpm counts, and remained above a 15% decrease through the 6- and 24-h time points (Fig. 5C). This result is in line with the proposed mechanism in which LFABP cleavage by cathepsin B results in reduced TAG availability for VLDL secretion. With this in mind, we sought to determine the impact of cathepsin B overexpression on cellular retention of our [3H]TAG. We found that overexpression of cathepsin B led to a 23% decrease in cellular [3H]TAG compared with control cells expressing only the empty vector after the 24-h pulse chase (Fig. 5D). We surmised that this could be attributed to reduced uptake of the [3H]oleic acid during the pulse phase. This suggests that the observed reduction on [3H]TAG secretion seen under conditions of cathepsin B overexpression can be attributed to decreased FFA uptake as a result of cathepsin B regulation of LFABP and CD36 protein levels. Thus far, we have established that knockdown of cathepsin B leads to increased LFABP and CD36 when cells are treated with physiologically relevant concentrations of 0.4 mm OA complexed with BSA. We have also established that this leads to increased VLDL secretion, as measured by [3H]TAG dpm counts and VLDL-apoB100, and a decrease in cellular [3H]TAG. Furthermore, cathepsin B overexpression leads to decreased FFA uptake and reduced VLDL secretion as a by-product of this mechanism. In our proposed mechanism, cytosolic cathepsin B regulates LFABP, which in turn regulates TAG availability for VLDL secretion. Our next goal was to visualize interaction of LFABP with apoB (a VLDL core protein) and cathepsin B. Dual labeling of McA-RH7777 cells was performed to test whether LFABP co-localizes with apoB as well as cathepsin B. Co-localization of LFABP with apoB and cathepsin B was performed with or without 0.4 mm OA complexed with BSA (OA-BSA) pretreatment to determine what impact these conditions have on interaction between the two proteins. In the absence of OA, when cells were treated with 0.4 mm BSA alone (BSA), co-localization of LFABP with apoB was determined based on the presence of a yellow (Fig. 6A, top right) staining pattern in the merged LFABP/apoB image. However, we did not observe any difference in co-localization of LFABP and apoB when cells were treated with OA-BSA for 1 h (Fig. 6A, bottom right). To ascertain co-localization of LFABP with apoB, we quantified our data. As shown in Fig. 6F, a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.92 was observed between LFABP and apoB after BSA treatment (no OA-BSA treatment), whereas 1 h after OA-BSA treatment, a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.94 was observed. These data suggest that LFABP co-localizes with apoB independent of OA treatment. Interestingly, no co-localization of LFABP and cathepsin B was observed when cells were treated with BSA alone (Fig. 6B, top right corner), indicating that under these conditions, the two proteins are segregated from each other in McA-RH7777 cells. However, when cells were subjected to 1 h of OA-BSA treatment, two very important changes in protein distribution occur. The staining pattern of LFABP formed a distinctive ring with a Golgi-like pattern, which is not evident with BSA-alone treatment (Fig. 6B, top left and middle left), and cathepsin B staining became diffuse and consistent with a cytosolic distribution (Fig. 6B, second column from the left, bottom two panels). Co-localization of LFABP and cathepsin B was observed in a diffuse cytosolic pattern as well as a more concise and distinctive pattern, which is consistent with localization to the Golgi apparatus (Fig. 6B, far right middle panel). In both dual-labeling experiments, OA-BSA treatment resulted in nuclear redistribution of LFABP, which is consistent with"

Previously, we found that VP3, the T7 family phage of the Vibrio cholerae serogroup O1 biotype El Tor, can adsorb the core oligosaccharide (OS) of lipopolysaccharides of V. cholerae. However, some wildtype strains of V. cholerae possessing the intact OS gene cluster still have VP3 binding but are resistant to VP3 infection. Moreover, an OS gene–deletion mutant still exhibits weak VP3 binding, suggesting multiple factors are possibly involved in VP3 binding to V. cholerae. Here, we report that the outer-membrane protein TolC of V. cholerae is involved in the host adsorption of VP3. We observed that TolC directly interacts with the VP3 tail fiber protein gp44 and its C-terminal domains, and we also found that three amino acid residues in the outside loops of TolC, at positions 78, 290, and 291, are critical for binding to gp44. Among the VP3-resistant wildtype V. cholerae strains, frequent amino acid residue mutations were observed in the loops around the sites 78, 290, and 291, which were predicted to be exposed to the cell surface. These findings reveal a co-receptor–binding mechanism for VP3 infection of V. cholerae and that both outer-membrane TolC and OS are necessary for successful VP3 infection of V. cholerae. We conclude that mutations on the outside loops of the receptor may confer V. cholerae strains with VP3 phage resistance, enabling these strains to survive in environments containing VP3 or related phages.

Cholera is an acute diarrheal disease caused by Vibrio cholerae. Although 210 serogroups in V. cholerae have been identified according to its O antigen variability, only serogroups O1 and O139 are associated with known cholera epidemics and pandemics. Serogroup O1 includes two biological types, classical and El Tor (1Feeley J.C. Classification of Vibrio cholerae (Vibrio comma), including El Tor vibrios, by infrasubspecific characteristics.J. Bacteriol. 1965; 89 (14273642): 665-670Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subtyping protocols of bacterial pathogens, including serotyping, phage typing, and molecular typing, are widely used in microbiological and epidemiological studies. A phage-biotyping scheme for El Tor strains of V. cholerae serogroup O1 was established in the 1970s to divide the epidemic strains into subtypes and distinguish them from environmental non-toxigenic strains (2Gao S. Gao S.W. Liu B. Characteristics of typing phages of Vibrio cholerae biotype El Tor.Fu Huo Luan Zi Liao Hui Bian. 1984; 4: 237-245Google Scholar). Five lytic phages (VP1 to VP5) are included in the phage-typing scheme, and four other biotypes are included in the biotyping scheme. The phage-biotyping scheme has played an important role in cholera surveillance in China since the 1970s (3Disease Control Bureau of the Ministry of Health of China 2013 Manual of Cholera Prevention (6th Ed.).

In phage–host interactions, host receptor mutations can confer phage resistance to the bacteria and improve survival in environments with phage. This bacteria–phage competition is relevant to ecological niches, food industries, and even phage therapy. Identification of host receptors allows us to understand the host specificity of a phage and the genetic basis of phage typing. Among the typing phages in the phage-biotyping scheme for the V. cholerae El Tor strains, our previous studies have identified the O antigen portion of LPS as receptor for VP4 (15Xu J. Zhang J. Lu X. Liang W. Zhang L. Kan B. O antigen is the receptor of Vibrio cholerae serogroup O1 El Tor typing phage VP4.J. Bacteriol. 2013; 195 (23222721): 798-80610.1128/JB.01770-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and OmpW as receptor for VP5 (24Xu D. Zhang J. Liu J. Xu J. Zhou H. Zhang L. Zhu J. Kan B. Outer membrane protein OmpW is the receptor for typing phage VP5 in the Vibrio cholerae O1 El Tor biotype.J. Virol. 2014; 88 (24719419): 7109-711110.1128/JVI.03186-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The typing phage VP3 is a lytic V. cholerae phage belonging to the T7 superfamily (32Li W. Zhang J. Chen Z. Zhang Q. Zhang L. Du P. Chen C. Kan B. The genome of VP3, a T7-like phage used for the typing of Vibrio cholerae.Arch.

Diao B. Zhang L. Kan B. The core oligosaccharide and thioredoxin of Vibrio cholerae are necessary for binding and propagation of its typing phage VP3.J. Bacteriol. 2009; 191 (19201789): 2622-262910.1128/JB.01370-08Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), but a core oligosaccharide mutant strain was still bound by VP3 at lower efficiency under high VP3 concentrations. In addition, some wild El Tor V. cholerae strains have intact OS components but are resistant to VP3. These findings raise the question whether additional components on the V. cholerae cell surface play a role in VP3 adsorption. In this study, our data show that the successful infection of VP3 requires the outer-membrane protein TolC in addition to the OS of LPS, TolC may interact directly with the tail fiber protein of VP3. Our study reveals a complicated two-receptor adsorption process with the phage of T7 family to V. cholerae. VP3 is used as a typing phage for the subtype of V. cholerae O1 El Tor strains. Its adsorption on the surface of its host cell was observed by electron microscopy (Fig. 1). The head of VP3 has an icosahedral structure. In our previous study (16Zhang J. Li W. Zhang Q. Wang H. Xu X. Diao B. Zhang L. Kan B. The core oligosaccharide and thioredoxin of Vibrio cholerae are necessary for binding and propagation of its typing phage VP3.J. Bacteriol. 2009; 191 (19201789): 2622-262910.1128/JB.01370-08Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), the V. cholerae wav genes VC0229 and VC0231, involved in the synthesis of core oligosaccharides (OS) of lipopolysaccharide, were identified to be related to the resistance to VP3 infection, and OS was recognized as the receptor of VP3. However, we found that some wildtype El Tor strains possessing intact OS gene clusters can bind the tail fiber protein gp44 of VP3 but are still resistant to VP3 by the double-layer plaque assay; additionally, using a phage-binding assay, it was observed that VP3 still bound to the OS gene mutant strain C29 at lower efficiency. 3F. Fan, J. Zhang, and B. Kan, unpublished data. We thus suspected that other bacterial surface components of V. cholerae might be involved in VP3 infection. In this study, we newly constructed a larger transposon mutant library to screen the mutants generating resistance to VP3 infection. More than 7,000 transposon insertion mutants of the El Tor strain N16961 were generated with the plasmid pSC123. During the co-incubation of the individual mutant strain with phage VP3, five mutants (24-H5, 61-A10, 17-B3, 26-A5, and 53-D9, see Table 1) showed growth rates comparable with that of the control (strain N16961 with no VP3 added). The sensitivity of these mutants to VP3 was further verified by double-layer plaque assays. Then, the transposon insertion sites in the genomes of these five strains were identified by arbitrary PCR. Five inserted genes other than the previously reported genes (16Zhang J. Li W. Zhang Q. Wang H. Xu X. Diao B. Zhang L. Kan B. The core oligosaccharide and thioredoxin of Vibrio cholerae are necessary for binding and propagation of its typing phage VP3.J.

One mutant (24-H5) had a transposon insertion within gene VC2436, which encodes the outer-membrane protein TolC. In Gram-negative bacteria, TolC forms a conserved, negatively charged entrance for virulence proteins and is also involved in antibiotic efflux to the external environment during infection (33Wandersman C.

https://openalex.org/W2949588982,"We present a proof of principle for the phenomenon of the tragedy of the commons that is at the center of many theories on the evolution of cooperation. Whereas the tragedy is commonly set in a game theoretical context, and attributed to an underlying Prisoner’s Dilemma, we take an alternative approach based on basic mechanistic principles of species growth that does not rely on the specification of payoffs which may be difficult to determine in practice. We establish the tragedy in the context of a general chemostat model with two species, the cooperator and the cheater. Both species have the same growth rate function and yield constant, but the cooperator allocates a portion of the nutrient uptake towards the production of a public good -the “Commons” in the Tragedy- which is needed to digest the externally supplied nutrient. The cheater on the other hand does not produce this enzyme, and allocates all nutrient uptake towards its own growth. We prove that when the cheater is present initially, both the cooperator and the cheater will eventually go extinct, hereby confirming the occurrence of the tragedy. We also show that without the cheater, the cooperator can survive indefinitely, provided that at least a low level of public good or processed nutrient is available initially. Our results provide a predictive framework for the analysis of cooperator-cheater dynamics in a powerful model system of experimental evolution."

We examined how body mass index (BMI) and physical activity, and changes in these, are associated with blood pressure in primary school-aged children. Data are from 1223 children aged 9 years (Year 4) in Bristol, UK, 685 of whom had been assessed at 6 years (Year 1). Child height and weight were measured, and children wore accelerometers for five days, from which average counts per minute, and moderate-to-vigorous-intensity physical activity and sedentary minutes per day were derived. At age 9 years, blood pressure was measured. Multiple imputation of missing data and adjusted linear regression models were used to examine associations. Child BMI at 9 years was cross-sectionally associated with higher systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure (mean difference [95% CI]: 1.10 [0.34, 1.87] mmHg and 0.86 [0.13, 1.60] mmHg, respectively, per SD of BMI). Prospective associations of BMI at age 6 with blood pressure at age 9 were consistent with these cross-sectional associations. However, change in BMI between 6 and 9 years was not strongly associated with subsequent SBP or DBP (0.68 [-0.61, 1.98] mmHg and 1.23 [-0.09, 2.54] mmHg, respectively). There was little evidence that physical activity or sedentary time were associated with blood pressure in either cross-sectional or prospective analyses. Greater childhood BMI is associated with higher blood pressure, and this association persists over several years. Prevention of excessive bodyweight from early childhood may be important in stemming the development of cardiovascular risk."
https://openalex.org/W2778920172,"Members of the TGF-β superfamily take part in the control of folliculogenesis. Vasorin (Vasn) is a newly identified negative regulator of TGF-β signaling whose possible involvement in ovarian physiology has never been studied. Here, we demonstrate that Vasn is expressed in the ovary by somatic cells of follicles, and that its expression is up-regulated by LH. We established a conditional knockout (cKO) mouse model in which Vasn is deleted specifically in granulosa cells of growing follicles from the secondary stage onwards. Using this model, we show that, upon hormonal stimulation, follicle ovulation size is almost 2-fold higher. This enhanced ovulatory response is associated with overactivation of the TGF-β signaling pathway and a lower number of atretic antral follicles. Of importance, we demonstrate that the number of primordial follicles is reduced in prepubertal cKO mouse ovaries, which suggests that the production of VASN by growing follicles protects the ovarian reserve. Finally, analysis of systemic KO mice revealed that the ovarian reserve is almost 2.5-fold higher, which implies that Vasn may also play a role in primordial follicle formation. Overall, our findings reveal that Vasn is a new regulator that exerts an effect on several key ovarian functions, including folliculogenesis, maintenance of the ovarian reserve, and ovulation.— Rimon-Dahari, N., Heinemann-Yerushalmi, L., Hadas, R., Kalich-Philosoph, L., Ketter, D., Nevo, N., Galiani, D., Dekel, N.

https://openalex.org/W2780783149,"Prion diseases include a number of progressive neuropathies involving conformational changes in cellular prion protein (PrPc) that may be fatal sporadic, familial or infectious. Pathological evidence indicated that neurons affected in prion diseases follow a dying-back pattern of degeneration. However, specific cellular processes affected by PrPc that explain such a pattern have not yet been identified. Results from cell biological and pharmacological experiments in isolated squid axoplasm and primary cultured neurons reveal inhibition of fast axonal transport (FAT) as a novel toxic effect elicited by PrPc. Pharmacological, biochemical and cell biological experiments further indicate this toxic effect involves casein kinase 2 (CK2) activation, providing a molecular basis for the toxic effect of PrPc on FAT. CK2 was found to phosphorylate and inhibit light chain subunits of the major motor protein conventional kinesin. Collectively, these findings suggest CK2 as a novel therapeutic target to prevent the gradual loss of neuronal connectivity that characterizes prion diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2777071929,"Our recent work uncovered novel roles for activated Gαi signaling in the regulation of neutrophil polarity and adhesion. GαiGTP-mediated enhancement of neutrophil polarization was dependent on inhibition of cAMP/PKA signaling, whereas reversal of Gβγ-stimulated adhesion was cAMP/PKA independent. To uncover the mechanism for Gαi regulation of adhesion, we analyzed the effects of constitutively active Gαi1(Q204L) expression on adhesion driven by constitutively active Rap1a(G12V) or its downstream effector Radil in neutrophil-like HL-60 cells, or in HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cells. In HT-1080 cells, Rap1a(G12V) or Radil cause an increase in cell spreading and adhesion to fibronectin, which are both reversed by Gαi1(Q204L) but not WT Gαi1. In contrast, Gαi1(Q204L) did not reverse Rap1-GTP–interacting adaptor molecule (RIAM)–dependent increases in cell adhesion. This indicates that adhesion regulation by Gαi-GTP occurs downstream of Rap1a and Radil, but is upstream of components such as integrins and talin that are regulated by both Radil and RIAM. HL-60 neutrophil-like cells expressing Rap1a(G12V) or Radil have an elongated phenotype because of enhanced uropod adhesion as they attempt to migrate on fibronectin. This elongated phenotype driven by Rap1a(G12V) or Radil is reversed by Gαi1(Q204L), but not by WT Gαi1 expression, suggesting that Gαi-GTP also regulates adhesion in immune cells at the level of, or downstream of, Radil. These data identify a novel role of Gαi-GTP in regulation of cell adhesion and migration. Cell migration involves cycles of adhesion and de-adhesion, and we propose that the dynamic spatiotemporal balance between Gβγ-promoted adhesion and Gαi-GTP reversal of adhesion is important for this process.

https://openalex.org/W2779319562,"Many membrane proteins are known to form higher-order oligomers, but the degree to which membrane regions could facilitate protein complex assembly remains largely unclear. Clusters of chemotaxis receptors are among the most prominent structures in the bacterial cell membrane, and they play important functions in processing of chemotactic signals. Although much work has been done to elucidate mechanisms of cluster formation, it almost exclusively focused on cytoplasmic interactions among receptors and other chemotaxis proteins, whereas involvement of membrane-mediated interactions was only hypothesized. Here we used imaging of constructs composed of only a fluorescent protein and the TM helices of Tar to demonstrate that interactions between the lipid bilayer and transmembrane (TM) helices of Escherichia coli chemoreceptors alone are sufficient to mediate clustering. We found that the ability to cluster depends on the sequence or length of the TM helices, implying that certain conformations of these helices facilitate clustering, whereas others do not. Notably, observed sequence specificity was apparently consistent with differences in clustering between native E. coli receptors, with the TM sequence of better-clustering high-abundance receptors being more efficient in promoting membrane-mediated complex formation. These results indicate that being more than just membrane anchors, TM helices could play an important role in the clustering and organization of membrane proteins in bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2779783475,"Current approaches to dynamic community detection in complex networks can fail to identify multi-scale community structure, or to resolve key features of community dynamics. We propose a targeted node removal technique to improve the resolution of community detection. Using synthetic oscillator networks with well-defined “ground truth” communities, we quantify the community detection performance of a common modularity maximization algorithm. We show that the performance of the algorithm on communities of a given size deteriorates when these communities are embedded in multi-scale networks with communities of different sizes, compared to the performance in a single-scale network. We demonstrate that targeted node removal during community detection improves performance on multi-scale networks, particularly when removing the most functionally cohesive nodes. Applying this approach to network neuroscience, we compare dynamic functional brain networks derived from fMRI data taken during both repetitive single-task and varied multi-task experiments. After the removal of regions in visual cortex, the most coherent functional brain area during the tasks, community detection is better able to resolve known functional brain systems into communities. In addition, node removal enables the algorithm to distinguish clear differences in brain network dynamics between these experiments, revealing task-switching behavior that was not identified with the visual regions present in the network. These results indicate that targeted node removal can improve spatial and temporal resolution in community detection, and they demonstrate a promising approach for comparison of network dynamics between neuroscientific data sets with different resolution parameters."
https://openalex.org/W2776236211,"Intestinal fructose uptake is mainly mediated by glucose transporter 5 (GLUT5/SLC2A5). Its closest relative, GLUT7, is also expressed in the intestine but does not transport fructose. For rat Glut5, a change of glutamine to glutamic acid at codon 166 (p.Q166E) has been reported to alter the substrate-binding specificity by shifting Glut5-mediated transport from fructose to glucose. Using chimeric proteins of GLUT5 and GLUT7, here we identified amino acid residues of GLUT5 that define its substrate specificity. The proteins were expressed in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts, and their activities were determined by fructose radiotracer flux. We divided the human GLUT5 sequence into 26 fragments and then replaced each fragment with the corresponding region in GLUT7. All fragments that yielded reduced fructose uptake were analyzed further by assessing the role of individual amino acid residues. Various positions in the first extracellular loop, in the fifth, seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth transmembrane domains (TMDs), and in the regions between the ninth and tenth TMDs and tenth and 11th TMDs were identified as being important for proper fructose uptake. Although the p.Q167E change did not render the human protein into a glucose transporter, molecular dynamics simulations revealed a drastic change in the dynamics and a movement of the intracellular loop connecting the sixth and seventh TMDs, which covers the exit of the ligand. Finally, we generated a GLUT7–GLUT5 chimera consisting of the N-terminal part of GLUT7 and the C-terminal part of GLUT5.

https://openalex.org/W2776432890,"Mice overexpressing galectin-8 [gal-8 transgenic (Tg)], a secreted mammalian lectin, exhibit enhanced bone turnover and reduced bone mass, similar to cases of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Here, we show that gal-8 knockout (KO) mice have increased bone mass accrual at a young age but exhibit accelerated bone loss during adulthood. These phenotypes can be attributed to a gal-8-mediated increase in receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) expression that promotes osteoclastogenesis, combined with direct inhibition of osteoblast differentiation, evident by reduced bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling, reduced phosphorylation of receptor regulated mothers against decapentaplegic homolog (R-SMAD) and reduced expression of osteoblast differentiation markers osterix, osteocalcin, runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2), dentin matrix acidic phosphoprotein-1 (DMP1), and alkaline phosphatase. At the same time, gal-8 promotes expression of estrogen receptor α (ESR1). Accordingly, the rate of bone loss is accelerated in ovariectomized, estrogen-deficient gal-8 Tg mice, whereas gal-8 KO mice, having low levels of ESR1, are refractory to ovariectomy. Finally, gal-8 mRNA positively correlates with the mRNA levels of osteoclastogenic markers RANKL, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase, and cathepsin K in human femurs. Collectively, these findings identify gal-8 as a new physiologic player in the regulation of bone mass.-Vinik, Y., Shatz-Azoulay, H., Hiram-Bab, S., Kandel, L., Gabet, Y., Rivkin, G., Zick, Y.

https://openalex.org/W2778396600,"Introduction The incidence of unplanned dialysis initiation (DI) with consequent increased comorbidity, mortality and reduced modality choice remains high, but the optimal timing of dialysis initiation (DI) remains controversial, and there is a lack of studies of specific reasons for DI. We investigated why and when physicians prescribe dialysis and hypothesized that physician motivation for DI is an independent factor which may have clinical consequences. Methods In the Peridialysis study, an ongoing multicenter prospective study assessing the causes and timing of DI and consequences of unplanned dialysis, physicians in 11 hospitals were asked to describe their primary, secondary and further reasons for prescribing DI. The stated reasons for DI were analyzed in relation to clinical and biochemical data at DI, and characteristics of physicians. Results In 446 patients (median age 67 years; 38% females; diabetes 25.6%), DI was prescribed by 84 doctors who stated 23 different primary reasons for DI. The primary indication was clinical in 63% and biochemical in 37%; 23% started for life-threatening conditions. Reduced renal function accounted for only 19% of primary reasons for DI but was a primary or contributing reason in 69%. The eGFR at DI was 7.2 ±3.4 ml/min/1.73 m2, but varied according to comorbidity and cause of DI. Patients with cachexia, anorexia and pulmonary stasis (34% with heart failure) had the highest eGFR (8.2–9.8 ml/min/1.73 m2), and those with edema, “low GFR”, and acidosis, the lowest (4.6–6.1 ml/min/1.73 m2). Patients with multiple comorbidity including diabetes started at a high eGFR (8.7 ml/min/1.73 m2). Physician experience played a role in dialysis prescription. Non-specialists were more likely to prescribe dialysis for life-threatening conditions, while older and more experienced physicians were more likely to start dialysis for clinical reasons, and at a lower eGFR. Female doctors started dialysis at a higher eGFR than males (8.0 vs. 7.1 ml/min/1.73 m2). Conclusions DI was prescribed mainly based on clinical reasons in accordance with current recommendations while low renal function accounted for only 19% of primary reasons for DI. There are considerable differences in physicians´ stated motivations for DI, related to their age, clinical experience and interpretation of biochemical variables. These differences may be an independent factor in the clinical treatment of patients, with consequences for the risk of unplanned DI."
https://openalex.org/W2777005829,"Agonists at the nicotinic acetylcholine alpha 7 receptor (nAChR α7) subtype have the potential to treat cognitive deficits in patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) or schizophrenia. Visuo-spatial paired associates learning (vsPAL) is a task that has been shown to reliably predict conversion from mild cognitive impairment to AD in humans and can also be performed by nonhuman primates. Reversal of scopolamine-induced impairment of vsPAL performance may represent a translational approach for the development of nAChR α7 agonists. The present study investigated the effect of treatment with the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, donepezil, or three nAChR α7 agonists, BMS-933043, EVP-6124 and RG3487, on vsPAL performance in scopolamine-treated cynomolgus monkeys. Scopolamine administration impaired vsPAL performance accuracy in a dose- and difficulty- dependent manner. The impairment of eventual accuracy, a measure of visuo-spatial learning during the task, was significantly ameliorated by treatment with donepezil (0.3 mg/kg, i.m.), EVP-6124 (0.01 mg/kg, i.m.) or BMS-933043 (0.03, 0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg, i.m.). Both nAChR α7 agonists showed inverted-U shaped dose-effect relationships with EVP-6124 effective at a single dose only whereas BMS-933043 was effective across at least a 10 fold dose/exposure range. RG3487 was not efficacious in this paradigm at the dose range examined (0.03–1 mg/kg, i.m.). These results are the first demonstration that the nAChR α7 agonists, EVP-6124 and BMS-933043, can ameliorate scopolamine-induced cognitive deficits in nonhuman primates performing the vsPAL task."

The goal of our research was to examine whether elevation of plasma FFA impairs mitochondrial function and alters PGC-1α promoter methylation. METHODS In this uncontrolled, change from baseline study design, insulin sensitivity and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion were measured in 9 normal glucose tolerant subjects before and after 3 day lipid infusion to elevate plasma FFA concentration. Vastus lateralis muscle biopsies were obtained and mitochondrial function, PGC-1α expression, and PGC-1α promoter methylation were quantitated. RESULTS Increased plasma FFA (440±93 μmol/Lto 997±242 μM, p<0.001) decreased insulin-stimulated total glucose disposal (TGD) by 25% (p = 0.008), impaired suppression of endogenous glucose production (p = 0.01), and reduced mitochondrial ATP synthesis with complex 1 (34%, p<0.05) and complex 2 (30%, p<0.05) substrates. Lipid infusion had no effect on muscle PGC-1α RNA expression, total methylation or non-CpG methylation, but methylation of the alternative PGC-1α promoter decreased (1.30±0.30 to 0.84±0.15% methylated residues/patient•strand, p = 0.055). Within PGC-1α promoter there was demethylation of CpT residues (0.72±0.16 vs. 0.28±0.10 methylated residues/patient•strand) (p = 0.002), which was inversely correlated with PGC-1α mRNA expression (r = -0.94, p<0.0001) and ATP synthesis with complex 1 (r = -0.80, p<0.01) and complex 2 (r = -0.69, p<0.05) substrates. Lipid infusion increased DNMT-3B (methyltransferase associated with PGC-1α promoter non-CpG methylation) mRNA expression (0.87 ± 0.09 to 1.62 ± 0.22 arbitrary units, p = 0.005), which correlated inversely with CpT demethylation (r = 0.67, p<0.05). CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION Physiologic plasma FFA elevation in NGT individuals has opposing effects on PGC-1α non-CpG residue methylation (CpT demethylation and increased DNMT-3B expression), which is correlated with changes in PGC-1α expression and skeletal muscle mitochondrial function."
https://openalex.org/W2780514718,"Domestic fowl in small groups are assumed to establish hierarchical systems based on individual recognition. Conversely, interactions in large groups are modulated by badges of status. Previous studies suggested that birds differing in phenotypic appearance (PA) became targets for aggression, possibly mistaking altered PA for badges of status. We evaluated the impact of altering PA on 0, 30, 50, 70 or 100% of the birds’ house at three experimental group sizes (GS). Tested GS were 10, 20 or 40 (8 birds/m2, 3 pens/GSxPA, 45 total). Thus, for each GS we had groups initially homogenous (100U, U = Unmarked; 100M, M = Marked), or heterogeneous M and U phenotypes coexisting in different proportions: 30M/70U, 50M/50U, and 70M/30U, remaining unchanged until 33 weeks of age. Then, homogeneous groups (100U and 100M) were sequentially altered by marking or unmarking 30, 50 and 70% of birds at 34, 38 and 44 weeks, respectively. Aggressive interactions were observed before applying changes at 27–28 weeks (T0), and after each sequential PA change on week 35–36 (T1), 39–40 (T2) and 45–46 (T3). Frequency of aggressive interactions in altered groups at T1, T2, and T3 were compared with non-altered heterogeneous controls. Results indicate no differences across initial PA and GS treatments (T0; P>0.05). However, aggression escalation was observed at T1 immediately after the first PA manipulation (Tukey P<0.05 altered vs controls). Aggression in altered groups remained high at T2 when compared to controls (Tukey, P<0.05), although by T3 interactions declined to almost initial levels (Tukey, P>0.05 altered vs controls). Aggressive interactions at T1 and T2 were predominantly directed from un-altered towards recently altered birds, irrespectively of their initial phenotype and of the GS. These results demonstrate that a sudden change in PA affects group dynamics. Altered birds were exposed to escalated aggression even in small groups, where individual recognition was presumed."
https://openalex.org/W2777198301,"The activation of insulin gene transcription depends on multiple nuclear proteins, including the transcription factors PDX-1 and NEUROD1, which form a transcriptional complex. We recently reported that hepatitis B X-interacting protein (HBXIP, also termed LAMTOR5) can modulate glucose metabolism reprogramming in cancer cells. However, the physiological role of HBXIP in the modulation of glucose metabolism in normal tissues is poorly understood. Here, we report that Hbxip is an essential regulator of the effect of the Pdx-1/Neurod1 complex on insulin gene transcription in murine pancreatic β-cells in vitro and in vivo. We found that pancreatic β-cell–specific Hbxip-knockout mice displayed higher fasting blood glucose levels and impaired glucose tolerance. Furthermore, Hbxip was involved in the regulation of insulin in the pancreas islets and increased insulin gene expression in rat pancreatic β-cells. Mechanistically, Hbxip stimulated insulin enhancer activity by interacting with Pdx-1 and recruiting Neurod1 to Pdx-1. Functionally, we provide evidence that Hbxip is required for Pdx-1/Neurod1-mediated insulin expression in rat pancreatic β-cells. Collectively, these results indicate that Hbxip is involved in the transcription of insulin by increasing the levels of the Pdx-1/Neurod1 complex in animal pancreatic β-cells. Our finding provides the insight into the mechanism by which Hbxip stimulates the transcription of the insulin gene."

The subcellular distribution of girdin was detected in a human breast cancer cell line and in >800 samples of human breast tissue by clinical pathologic analysis. In this study, we discovered for the first time that girdin could attach to chromatin and interact with topoisomerase-IIα in nucleus. Cytoplasmic and nuclear girdin exhibited different roles in prognosis of breast cancer: cytoplasmic girdin expression was an independent prognostic factor for progression-free survival (PFS), whereas nuclear girdin expression was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (OS). More important, combination cytoplasmic and nuclear girdin was an independent prognosis factor of both OS and PFS.

They received community-based support through the project staff, in addition to the routine domiciliary care provided by NTP staff. Each project township had a project nurse exclusively for MDR-TB and a community volunteer who provided evening directly observed therapy (in addition to morning directly observed therapy by NTP).To determine the effect of CBMDR-TBC project on death and unfavourable outcomes during the intensive phase of MDR-TB treatment.In this cohort study involving record review, all patients diagnosed with MDR-TB between January 2015 and June 2016 in project townships and initiated on treatment till 31 Dec 2016 were included. CBMDR-TBC status was categorized as ""receiving support"" if project initiation in patient's township was before treatment initiation, ""receiving partial support"" if project initiation was after treatment initiation, and ""not receiving support"" if project initiation was after intensive phase treatment outcome declaration. Time to event analysis (censored on 10 April 2017) and cox regression was done.Of 261 patients initiated on treatment, death and unfavourable outcomes were accounted for 13% and 21% among ""receiving support (n = 163)"", 3% and 24% among ""receiving partial support (n = 75)"" and 13% and 26% among ""not receiving support (n = 23)"" respectively. After adjusting for other potential confounders, the association between CBMDR-TBC and unfavourable outcomes was not statistically significant. However, when compared to ""not receiving support"", those ""receiving support"" and ""receiving partial support"" had 20% [aHR (0.95 CI: 0.8 (0.2-3.1)] and 90% lower hazard [aHR (0.95 CI: 0.1 (0.02-0.9)] of death, respectively. This was intriguing. Implementation of CBMDR-TBC coincided with implementation of decentralized MDR-TB centers at district level. Hence, patients that would have generally not accessed MDR-TB treatment before decentralization also started receiving treatment and were also included under CBMDR-TBC ""received support"" group. These patients could possibly be expected to sicker at treatment initiation than patients in other CBMDR-TBC groups. This could be the possible reason for nullifying the effect of CBMDR-TBC in ""receiving support"" group and therefore similar survival was found when compared to ""not receiving support"".CBMDR-TBC may prevent early deaths and has a scope for expansion to other townships of Myanmar and implications for NTPs globally. However, future studies should consider including data on extent of sickness at treatment initiation and patient level support received under CBMDR-TBC."

Demographic and clinical data were retrieved from the Danish nationwide database (DANBIO). Logistic regression analyses were performed to test for associations.One-hundred eighty-four patients were eligible for analysis. Haplogroup frequencies were: H (n = 88; 47.8%), U (n = 37; 20.1%), T (n = 22; 12.0%), J (n = 16; 8.7%), K (n = 11; 5.9%), HV (n = 6; 3.3%) and V (n = 4; 2.2%).
