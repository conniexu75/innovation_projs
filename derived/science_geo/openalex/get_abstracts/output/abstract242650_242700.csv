https://openalex.org/W2086227770,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are generated by a two-step processing pathway to yield RNA molecules of approximately 22 nucleotides that negatively regulate target gene expression at the post-transcriptional level1. Primary miRNAs are processed to precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs) by the Microprocessor complex2,3,4. These pre-miRNAs are cleaved by the RNase III Dicer5,6,7,8 to generate mature miRNAs that direct the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) to messenger RNAs with complementary sequence9. Here we show that TRBP (the human immunodeficiency virus transactivating response RNA-binding protein10), which contains three double-stranded, RNA-binding domains, is an integral component of a Dicer-containing complex. Biochemical analysis of TRBP-containing complexes revealed the association of Dicer–TRBP with Argonaute 2 (Ago2)11,12, the catalytic engine of RISC. The physical association of Dicer–TRBP and Ago2 was confirmed after the isolation of the ternary complex using Flag-tagged Ago2 cell lines. In vitro reconstitution assays demonstrated that TRBP is required for the recruitment of Ago2 to the small interfering RNA (siRNA) bound by Dicer. Knockdown of TRBP results in destabilization of Dicer and a consequent loss of miRNA biogenesis. Finally, depletion of the Dicer–TRBP complex via exogenously introduced siRNAs diminished RISC-mediated reporter gene silencing. These results support a role of the Dicer–TRBP complex not only in miRNA processing but also as a platform for RISC assembly."

https://openalex.org/W2029333308,"Quantum degenerate Fermi gases provide a remarkable opportunity to study strongly interacting fermions. In contrast to other Fermi systems, such as superconductors, neutron stars or the quark-gluon plasma of the early Universe, these gases have low densities and their interactions can be precisely controlled over an enormous range. Previous experiments with Fermi gases have revealed condensation of fermion pairs. Although these and other studies were consistent with predictions assuming superfluidity, proof of superfluid behaviour has been elusive. Here we report observations of vortex lattices in a strongly interacting, rotating Fermi gas that provide definitive evidence for superfluidity. The interaction and therefore the pairing strength between two 6Li fermions near a Feshbach resonance can be controlled by an external magnetic field. This allows us to explore the crossover from a Bose–Einstein condensate of molecules to a Bardeen–Cooper–Schrieffer superfluid of loosely bound pairs. The crossover is associated with a new form of superfluidity that may provide insights into high-transition-temperature superconductors. A clear signature for superfluidity — the frictionless flow seen in some liquids at temperatures close to absolute zero — is the formation of a lattice of quantum vortices in a rotating system. This ‘smoking gun’ has been observed for the first time in an ultracold gas of lithium-6 atoms, confirming the prediction that these quantum gases are superfluids. This system could be a useful model for studies on high-temperature superconductivity and exotic matter such as quark–gluon plasma or neutron stars."

Some of these pathways involve natural opiates but now an endocannabinoid-based equivalent has been found. The enzymes that break up these natural marijuana-like compounds may be important therapeutic targets for stress-related disorders. Acute stress suppresses pain by activating brain pathways that engage opioid or non-opioid mechanisms. Here we show that an opioid-independent form of this phenomenon, termed stress-induced analgesia1, is mediated by the release of endogenous marijuana-like (cannabinoid) compounds in the brain. Blockade of cannabinoid CB1 receptors in the periaqueductal grey matter of the midbrain prevents non-opioid stress-induced analgesia. In this region, stress elicits the rapid formation of two endogenous cannabinoids, the lipids 2-arachidonoylglycerol2 (2-AG) and anandamide3. A newly developed inhibitor of the 2-AG-deactivating enzyme, monoacylglycerol lipase4,5, selectively increases 2-AG concentrations and, when injected into the periaqueductal grey matter, enhances stress-induced analgesia in a CB1-dependent manner. Inhibitors of the anandamide-deactivating enzyme fatty-acid amide hydrolase6, which selectively elevate anandamide concentrations, exert similar effects. Our results indicate that the coordinated release of 2-AG and anandamide in the periaqueductal grey matter might mediate opioid-independent stress-induced analgesia. These studies also identify monoacylglycerol lipase as a previously unrecognized therapeutic target."

We found that mammalian GSK-3β is expressed in the suprachiasmatic nucleus and liver of mice and that GSK-3β phosphorylation exhibits robust circadian oscillation. Rhythmic GSK-3β phosphorylation is also observed in serum-shocked NIH3T3 cells. Exposing serum-shocked NIH3T3 cells to lithium chloride, a specific inhibitor of GSK-3β, increases GSK-3β phosphorylation and delays the phase of rhythmic clock gene expression. On the other hand, GSK-3β overexpression advances the phase of clock gene expression. We also found that GSK-3β interacts with PERIOD2 (PER2) in vitro and in vivo. Recombinant GSK-3β can phosphorylate PER2 in vitro. GSK-3β promotes the nuclear translocation of PER2 in COS1 cells.

Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 645-649PubMed Google Scholar).The stability and the activity of circadian molecules are dependent on several factors such as kinase. Positional cloning has revealed that the tau locus (that shortens circadian rhythms) in hamsters is encoded by casein kinase 1ϵ (CK1ϵ) (20Lowrey P.L. Shimomura K. Antoch M.P. Yamazaki S. Zemenides P.D. Ralph M.R. Menaker M. Takahashi J.S. Science. 2000; 288: 483-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar), a homologue of the Drosophila clock gene double-time. The double-time gene product phosphorylates PER and causes protein degradation in Drosophila (21Young M.W. Science. 2000; 288: 451-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). CK1ϵ phosphorylates PER1, PER2, and PER3, then renders them unstable in mammals (22Keesler G.A. Camacho F. Guo Y. Virshup D. Mondadori C. Yao Z.

Cell. 2001; 105: 769-779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). The gene product SHAGGY (SGG) has serine/threonine kinase activity, and it affects phosphorylation of the Drosophila clock protein TIMELESS (TIM). The overexpression of SGG shortens, whereas reduced expression lengthens, the period of circadian locomotor activity, indicating that SGG activity plays an intrinsic role in circadian rhythmicity of Drosophila. The overexpression of SGG in vivo converts hypophosphorylated TIM to a hyperphosphorylated protein, and SGG might phosphorylate TIM in vitro. The proposed ortholog of shaggy in mammals is glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β), the activity of which is down-regulated through phosphorylation of an NH2-terminal serine residues (Ser-9) (26Stambolic V. Woodgett J.R. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 701-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 27Harwood A.J. Cell. 2001; 105: 821-824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). It is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a key role in many signaling pathway (28Woodgett J.R. Science's STKE. 2001; (2001): RE12PubMed Google Scholar, 29Weston C.R. Davis R.J.

However, whether GSK-3β can affect the mammalian circadian clock has not yet been determined. Thus, we characterized the role of GSK-3β activity in the mammalian circadian clock.MATERIALS AND METHODSAnimals—ICR mice were entrained in a 12 h light:12 h dark cycle for at least 2 weeks. At selected times, mice were killed, and SCN and livers were dissected and frozen on dry ice.Plasmid Construction—To generate eukaryotic expression constructs of rGSK-3β (a gift from Dr. K. Ishiguro (31Planel E. Yasutake K. Fujita S.C. Ishiguro K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34298-34306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar)), the cDNA encoding PCR-amplified fragments were cloned into pFLAG-CMV2 (Sigma). The expression constructs encoding full-length rPER2, amino-terminal of rPER2 (amino acids 1–512) and carboxyl-terminal of rPER2 (amino acids 512–1257) have been described previously (32Miyazaki K. Mesaki M. Ishida N. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 6651-6659Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The rPER2 fragments (amino acids 1–171, 1–319, 172–319, 320–512, and 372–512) were amplified by PCR and cloned into pFLAG-CMV2. Full-length mCry1 and mCry2 (provided by Dr. T. Todo) were cloned into pcDNA3.1-His-V5 (Invitrogen), mClock into pFLAG-CMV2, mBMAL1 (provided by Dr. M. Ikeda) into pcDNA3.1-His-Xpress (Invitrogen), and hPer1 (provided by Dr. H. Tei) into pCXN2. All constructs were verified by automated sequencing.Cell Culture and Transfection—COS1 and NIH3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and a mixture of penicillin and streptomycin in a humidified incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2. COS1 cells were transfected using Lipofectamine PLUS (Invitrogen) or FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics) according to the protocols supplied by the manufacturers. NIH3T3 cells were transfected using Polyfect (Qiagen). The cells were washed twice with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) after 24 h post-transfection and suspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40) containing Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics). Lysates were incubated for 30 min on ice and then clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C.Western Blotting—The amount of protein was determined using DC protein assay (Bio-Rad), and the same amounts of proteins were normalized for total protein. The protein samples were boiled in SDS sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). Nonspecific binding was blocked with 3% dry milk in PBS and proteins were probed with anti-hPER1, anti-rPER2 (provided by Dr. T. Nagase), anti-Xpress (Invitrogen), anti-V5(Invitrogen), and anti-FLAG (SIGMA), all diluted 1:5000; anti-GSK-3β (Transduction Laboratories) diluted 1:2500; or antiphospho-GSK-3β (Cell Signaling) diluted 1:1000.Immunoprecipitation—Transfected COS1 cells were lysed as described above. A slurry of antibody and protein A/G PLUS-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added to clarified supernatants. After an overnight incubation at 4 °C, immune complexes were washed twice with lysis buffer, mixed in SDS sample buffer, and analyzed by Western blotting. To generate the data shown in Fig. 4C, fresh mouse brains (0.5 g) at ZT2 and ZT14 were dissected and then homogenized in 1 ml of extraction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.4 m NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5% glycerol) containing phosphatase inhibitor mixture 1 (Sigma) and Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture. The resulting homogenate was separated by centrifugation and the supernatant was immnoprecipitated using anti-rPER2 antiserum.Serum Shock and Northern Blotting—Two days after seeding ∼5 × 105 cells/6-cm Petri dish (Iwaki), confluent NIH3T3 cells were serum-shocked by a 24-h incubation in serum-free medium as described (18Balsalobre A. Damiola F. Schibler U. Cell. 1998; 93: 929-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1543) Google Scholar). At time 0, the medium was changed to DMEM containing 50% horse serum (Invitorogen), and 2 h later, this medium was replaced with DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin. At the indicated times, the cells were washed twice with PBS, and total RNA was extracted using ISOGEN reagent (Nippon Gene). The Northern blotting proceeded as described (15Oishi K. Sakamoto K. Okada T. Nagase T. Ishida N. Neurosci. Lett. 1998; 256: 117-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Samples were normalized by comparison with the amount of GAPDH mRNA.Kinase Assay—rPER2 and mCLOCK were expressed in COS1 cells, and the cells were shattered in lysis buffer. Proteins were immunoprecipitated by incubating the cell lysates with the appropriate antibodies and protein A/G-agarose beads overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed twice with lysis buffer and once with kinase reaction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2.5mm dithiothreitol). The washed beads were incubated with kinase reaction buffer containing 25 ng of recombinant GSK-3β (Upstate Biotechnology) and then with 200 μm ATP, 5μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) for 15 min at 30 °C. To exclude the effect of endogenous CK1 in COS1 cells, we added 400 μm CK1–7 (Seikagaku Corp.), a specific inhibitor of CK1 at the same time. The beads were washed twice with PBS, and proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer. After proteins were separated by 6% SDS-PAGE, vacuum-dried gels were analyzed with a BAS2500 imaging analyzer.Immunocytochemistry and RNA Interference—COS1 cells cultured on glass coverslips in 12-well plates were transfected using FuGENE 6. Twenty-four hours later, the cells were rinsed twice with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min, and permeabilized with 0.05% Triton X-100 in PBS including 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma) for 15 min. Anti-rPER2 antiserum or anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) was diluted 1:3000 in blocking solution (5% bovine serum albumin in PBS) and incubated with the cells for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were washed three times with 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS (T-PBS) and incubated with a fluorescent secondary antibody. Coverslips containing stained cells were washed with T-PBS and mounted for fluorescence microscopy.For RNA interference experiments, short interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting GSK-3β (GSK-3β Validated Stealth RNA interference, Invitrogen) was transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) 3 h after COS1 cells were transfected. Thirty-six hours post-transfection, nuclear translocation of rPER2 was examined by immunocytochemical means as described above.RESULTSCyclic Regulation of GSK-3β Phosphorylation—The Drosophila homologue of mammalian GSK-3β, the clock protein SGG, is putative kinase that phosphorylates TIM (25Martinek S. Inonog S. Manoukian A.S. Young M.W. Cell. 2001; 105: 769-779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). If GSK-3β is important for mammalian circadian clock function, then it should exhibit circadian expression in the SCN and the liver, sites of the master and peripheral clocks, respectively. The circadian nature of GSK-3β expression (phosphorylation) should be determined because that activity of GSK-3β is regulated through its own phosphorylation (27Harwood A.J. Cell. 2001; 105: 821-824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 28Woodgett J.R. Science's STKE. 2001; (2001): RE12PubMed Google Scholar, 30Frame S. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1266) Google Scholar). We first evaluated GSK-3β expression and phosphorylation levels in the SCN and the liver by Western blotting. Circadian changes in total GSK-3β were undetectable, but the phosphorylation level at Ser-9 (pGSK-3β) changed in a circadian manner in both the SCN and the liver (Fig. 1A). The phase angle of circadian changes of GSK-3β phosphorylation differed between the SCN and the liver. The phosphorylation of GSK-3β in the SCN reached a nadir at ZT14 and peaked at ZT2 (Fig. 1B). In contrast, the phosphorylation level of GSK-3β in the liver was minimal at ZT20 and reached maximum at ZT11.Fig. 1GSK-3β phosphorylation exhibits circadian changes in SCN and liver. A, Western blots of total proteins from SCN or liver of wild type (ICR) mice. Mice were entrained on a light = 12 h:dark = 12 h cycle, and the tissues were dissected at indicated circadian time. SCN or liver extracts were Western blotted and probed for anti-phospho-GSK-3β (pGSK-3β) and anti-GSK-3β antibodies. B, the expression or phosphorylation of GSK3β is quantified by ImageJ software and plotted as pGSK-3β/GSK-3β signal ratios. The highest ratio was arbitrarily established as 100% and results are represented as percent ± S.E. (n = 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In cultured fibroblasts, serum-rich medium triggers the rhythmicity of several genes (proteins), the activity of which also oscillates in vivo (18Balsalobre A. Damiola F. Schibler U. Cell. 1998; 93: 929-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1543) Google Scholar, 19Akashi M. Nishida E. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 645-649PubMed Google Scholar). We examined whether GSK-3β phosphorylation undergoes circadian changes in serum-shocked mouse fibroblast NIH3T3 cells. We then recorded the profile of GSK-3β expression and phosphorylation for 52 h following serum shock. The total level of GSK-3β protein did not appear to undergo circadian changes, but the phosphorylation level of GSK-3β changed in a circadian manner like that in the SCN and the liver (Fig. 2).Fig. 2GSK-3β phosphorylation exhibits circadian changes in serum-shocked NIH3T3 cells. Cells were incubated for 2 h in medium containing 50% horse serum, then this was replaced with medium with (+) or without (–) 20 mm LiCl. Total protein prepared at the indicated times was Western blotted and probed for anti-phospho-GSK-3β (pGSK-3β), anti-GSK-3β, or anti-actin antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Lithium Chloride (LiCl) specifically inhibits GSK-3β, and it can cause increased phosphorylation of GSK-3β on Ser-9 (33De Sarno P.

Chem. 2003; 278: 33067-33077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). We therefore examined GSK-3β expression and phosphorylation in the presence of 20 mm LiCl, which inhibited GSK-3β activity with 80–90% inhibition (35Stambolic V. Ruel L. Woodgett J.R. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1664-1668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Klein P.S. Melton D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8455-8459Crossref PubMed Scopus (2064) Google Scholar). The levels of total GSK-3β expression were similar to those in the absence of LiCl, but GSK-3β phosphorylation was elevated during the 52 h following serum shock (Fig. 2).Inhibition of GSK-3β Activity Delayed the Phase of Clock Gene Expression in Serum-shocked NIH3T3 Cells—To determine whether GSK-3β affects the circadian oscillation of core clock components, we examined mPer2, BMAL1, and DBP mRNA rhythmic expression in serum-shocked NIH3T3 cells in the presence of LiCl. After transient exposure to 50% serum, the expression levels of various genes oscillated with a period length of about 24 h in confluent cells (18Balsalobre A. Damiola F. Schibler U. Cell. 1998; 93: 929-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1543) Google Scholar, 19Akashi M. Nishida E. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 645-649PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of mPer2 mRNA peaked at 23.56 ± 0.64 h in the absence of LiCl (Fig. 3, A, upper panel, and B, solid line). The expression of mPer2 mRNA peaked in the cells at 25.80 ± 0.46 h in the presence of 10 mm LiCl with a phase delay of 2.2 h (Fig. 3, A, center panel, and B, dashed black line). Furthermore, when cells were incubated with 20 mm LiCl, mPer2 mRNA expression peaked at 28.04 ± 0.18 h with a 4.4-h phase delay (Fig. 3, A, lower panel, and B, dashed gray line). The expression of BMAL1 and DBP mRNA was also delayed like mPer2 when LiCl was added (supplemental Fig. 1A). These results indicate that the inhibition of GSK-3β activity delayed the mRNA expression of core clock components in serum-shocked NIH3T3 cells.Fig. 3Inhibition and overexpression of GSK-3β activity, respectively, delayed and advanced the phase. A, cells were shifted to medium containing 50% horse serum at time 0 and incubated for 2 h, then the medium was replaced with that containing 0, 10, or 20 mm LiCl. Total RNA was prepared at indicated times, and relative levels of mPer2 and GAPDH mRNA were determined by Northern blotting. B, levels of mPer2 mRNA were quantified with a BAS2500 imaging analyzer and plotted as mPer2/GAPDH mRNA signal ratio. The value at time = 2 h was set to 100%. C, twenty-four hours after cells were transfected with rGSK-3β or empty vector, cells were shifted to medium containing 50% horse serum at time 0 and incubated for 2 h, and then the medium was replaced. Total RNA prepared at the indicated times was analyzed by Northern blotting. Expression profiles of mPer2 and GAPDH mRNA are shown. D, signals obtained from Northern blots to detect mPer2 mRNA were quantified and normalized to those obtained for GAPDH mRNA. The value at time = 2 h was set to 100%.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In the presence of LiCl, the expression levels of mPer2, but not of BMAL1 or DBP, dose-dependently increased (supplemental Fig. 2). The mPer2 expression levels in cells incubated in 5, 10, 15, or 20 mm LiCl were 1.2-, 1.5-, 1.8-, and 2.3-fold increased, respectively, as compared with control (absence of LiCl).Overexpression of rGSK-3β Advanced the Phase of mPer2, BMAL1, and DBP mRNA Expression in Serum-shocked NIH3T3 Cells—Inhibitory experiments alone were insufficient to confirm that GSK-3β affects the circadian clock. We therefore tested the effects of rGSK-3β gene overexpression to the phase of the clock gene expressions in NIH3T3 cells transfected with rGSK-3β. mPer2, BMAL1, and DBP mRNA expression peaked at 22.25 ± 0.05, 34.23 ± 0.33, and 20.02 ± 0.18 h, respectively, in cells overexpressing rGSK-3β (Fig. 3, C and D, and supplemental Fig. 1B). The phase of all three genes was advanced by 1.4 h in cells overexpressing rGSK-3β compared with vector control. The results demonstrated that rGSK-3β overexpression advanced the mRNA phase of core oscillators in serum-shocked NIH3T3 cells.GSK-3β Physically Interacts with PER2 in Vitro and in Vivo—We examined the possible physical interactions of GSK-3β with each component of the mammalian circadian feedback loop to search for specific GSK-3β targets. We co-transfected hPer1, rPer2, mCry1, mCry2, mClock, or mBmal1 with rGSK-3β in COS1 cells and 24 h later immunoprecipitated cell lysates with anti-GSK-3β antibody and immunoblotted them against appropriate antibodies. Fig. 4A shows that rPER2 co-precipitated with rGSK3β. To confirm the interaction between rPER2 and rGSK3β, cell lysates immunoprecipitated with anti-rPER2 antiserum were blotted against anti-GSK-3β antibody. Fig. 4B shows that rGSK-3β co-precipitated with rPER2.To examine interactions between PER2 and GSK-3β in vivo, we immunoprecipitated brain extracts with anti-rPER2 antiserum and then probed the resulting immune complexes for GSK-3β by Western blotting (Fig. 4C). We focused on the periods before (ZT2) and during (ZT14) the expected PER2 peaks. As shown in Fig. 4C, GSK-3β co-precipitated with PER2 at ZT14. The data suggested that immunoprecipitated GSK-3β binding to PER2 was more abundant at ZT14 than at ZT2.Identification of the rGSK-3β Binding Site in rPER2—To determine the specific region of rPER2 required for rGSK-3β binding, we constructed various fragments of rPER2 (Fig. 5A) and analyzed the binding activity of rPER2 mutants with rGSK-3β. We co-transfected rPER2 fragments with rGSK-3β in COS1 cells. At 24 h post-transfection, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with tagged GSK-3β antibody and then immunoblotted PER2 fragments against appropriate antibodies. As shown in Fig. 5B, the amino-terminal fragments of rPER2 (amino acids 1–512, 1–319, and 1–171), PASA region of rPER2 (amino acids 172–319), and PASB region of rPER2 (amino acids 320–512) co-immunoprecipitated with rGSK-3β(Fig. 5B, lanes 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7). In contrast, the carboxyl-terminal fragments of rPER2 (amino acids 512–1257) and NES region of rPER2 (amino acids 372–512) did not co-immunoprecipitate (Fig. 5B, lanes 3 and 8). These results indicate that rGSK-3β binds to at least amino acids residus 1–372 on rPER2. This region is not overlapped with CRY or CK1ϵ binding sites (23Vielhaber E. Eide E. Rivers A. Gao Z.H.

CK1ϵ and CRY1 binding sites on PER2 are indicated. B, full-length rPER2 (amino acids 1–1257), amino-terminal of rPER2 (amino acids 1–512), were co-transfected with FLAG-tagged rGSK-3β. Cells were lysed 24 h later, immunoprecipitated with M2 anti-FLAG antibody, and immunoblotted using anti-rPER2 antiserum. FLAG-tagged carboxyl terminus of rPER2 (amino acids 512–1257), amino terminus of rPER2 (amino acids 1–319), PASA region of rPER2 (amino acids 172–319), small amino terminus of rPER2 (amino acids 1–171), PASB region of rPER2 (amino acids 320–514), and NES region of rPER2 (amino acids 372–514) were co-expressed with hemagglutinin-tagged rGSK-3β. Cells were lysed 24 h post-transfection, immunoprecipitated with anti-hemagglutinin antibody, and immunoblotted against M2 anti-FLAG antibody. The asterisks indicate immunoprecipitated rPER2 fragments, and the arrowheads indicate the nonspecific band.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Phosphorylation of rPER2 in Vitro by GSK-3β—To investigate whether GSK-3β phosphorylates rPER2, recombinant GSK-3β was assayed for kinase activity using immunoprecipitated rPER2 from transfected COS1 cells as substrates. Because PER2 was phosphorylated by endogenous CK1 in cultured cells (37Eide E.J. Vielhaber E.L. Hinz W.A. Virshup D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17248-17254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), we added CK1–7, a specific inhibitor of CK1 to reduce the phosphorylation by co-precipitating endogenous CK1. Under these conditions, rPER2 was phosphorylated by GSK-3β (Fig. 6A, lanes 4 and 5). The phosphorylation of rPER2 was decreased to 62.7% in the presence of 20 mm LiCl, which inhibits GSK-3β (Fig. 6, A, lanes 5 and 6, B). Immunoprecipitated mCLOCK was used as a negative control. mCLOCK was not phosphorylated by GSK-3β (Fig. 6A, lanes 7 and 8) as expected. These results suggest that GSK-3β phosphorylates rPER2.Fig. 6Phosphorylation of rPER2 by GSK-3β. Kinase assays of rPER2 or mCLOCK using GSK-3β and [γ-32P]ATP are shown. A, COS1 cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding whole rPER2 (lanes 4–6), vector control of rPER2 (lanes 1–3), or mCLOCK as a negative control (lanes 7–9). These proteins were immunoprecipitated and incubated with [γ-32P]ATP, without (lanes 1, 4, and 7) or with GSK-3β (lanes 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, and 9) and without (lanes 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8) or with LiCl (lanes 3, 6, and 9). Proteins were resolved on 6% SDS-PAGE gels and analyzed with a BAS2500 imaging analyzer. The same amounts of protein were loaded on another set of gels and Western blotted as loading controls (lanes 1′–9′). B, quantitation of PER2 phosphorylation shown in A (lanes 4–6). The results shown are the average of three independent experiments (±S.E.). The value of PER2 phosphorylation by GSK-3β without LiCl was set to 100%.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Regulation of rPER2 Nuclear Localization—When expressed alone, PER1 was shown to localize predominantly in the nuclei of transfected cells (23Vielhaber E.

https://openalex.org/W2029980267,"Despite profound musculoskeletal differences, hummingbirds (Trochilidae) are widely thought to employ aerodynamic mechanisms similar to those used by insects. The kinematic symmetry of the hummingbird upstroke and downstroke has led to the assumption that these halves of the wingbeat cycle contribute equally to weight support during hovering, as exhibited by insects of similar size. This assumption has been applied, either explicitly or implicitly, in widely used aerodynamic models and in a variety of empirical tests. Here we provide measurements of the wake of hovering rufous hummingbirds (Selasphorus rufus) obtained with digital particle image velocimetry that show force asymmetry: hummingbirds produce 75% of their weight support during the downstroke and only 25% during the upstroke. Some of this asymmetry is probably due to inversion of their cambered wings during upstroke. The wake of hummingbird wings also reveals evidence of leading-edge vortices created during the downstroke, indicating that they may operate at Reynolds numbers sufficiently low to exploit a key mechanism typical of insect hovering. Hummingbird hovering approaches that of insects, yet remains distinct because of effects resulting from an inherently dissimilar-avian-body plan."

To avoid treatment with any detergent or dye, we compared organization of the respiratory chain in intact mitochondria from wild type and cardiolipin-lacking cells by using a functional analysis developed previously for the study of the organization of the respiratory chain of S. cerevisiae (Boumans, H., Grivell, L.

Dependence of the kinetics of NADH oxidation via complexes III, IV, and cytochrome c on the concentration of the complex III-specific inhibitor antimycin A was studied. A linear relationship between respiratory activity and saturation of complex III with antimycin A was obtained for wild type mitochondria consistent with single functional unit kinetics of the respiratory chain. Under the same conditions, cardiolipin-lacking mitochondria displayed a hyperbolic relationship indicating cytochrome c pool behavior. No release of cytochrome c from cardiolipin-lacking mitochondria or mitoplasts under our standard experimental conditions was detected. Identical cytochrome c pool behavior was observed for both wild type and cardiolipin-lacking mitochondria in the presence of a chaotropic agent, which disrupts the interaction between respiratory complexes. The results demonstrate that cardiolipin is essential for association of complexes III and IV into a supercomplex in intact yeast mitochondria.

The results demonstrate that cardiolipin is essential for association of complexes III and IV into a supercomplex in intact yeast mitochondria. Cardiolipin, a phospholipid exclusively found in bacterial membranes and the inner membrane of mitochondria, supports structural integrity and modulates activity of many multimeric complexes of these energy-transducing membranes (1Schlame M.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14966-14972Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). It was demonstrated by blue native (BN)-PAGE that complexes III and IV form a supercomplex in yeast and mammalian mitochondria composed of a heterodimer of individual homodimers of complex III and complex IV that remains intact after detergent solubilization (8Cruciat C.M.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1777-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar). Using BN-PAGE analysis of digitonin extracts from Saccharomyces cerevisiae mitochondria, we previously found that, in contrast to wild type yeast, complexes III and IV do not associate to form a supercomplex in mitochondrial extracts from cardiolipin-lacking yeast mutants (crd1Δ). Expression in the crd1Δ mutant of a low copy plasmid carrying a “tet-off”-regulated CRD1 gene (that encodes cardiolipin synthase) allowed us to demonstrate that the level of the supercomplex in the digitonin extracts was dependent on the cardiolipin content of the mitochondria. We suggested a specific role for cardiolipin in supporting a critical interaction between complexes III and IV in vivo that cannot be substituted by the elevated levels of phosphatidylglycerol in the mutant (10Zhang M. Mileykovskaya E. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43553-43556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Although BN-PAGE analysis was developed to study native assembly of mitochondrial complexes (11Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1918) Google Scholar), the possible dissociation of loosely bound subunits of the supercomplex caused by the anionic dye Coomassie Blue (Serva Blue G) in the absence of cardiolipin was suggested (12Pfeiffer K. Gohil V. Stuart R.A. Hunte C. Brandt U. Greenberg M.L. Schagger H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52873-52880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Colorless native (CN)-PAGE might be a preferred method to identify membrane protein complexes in cardiolipin-lacking mutants, because low levels of nonionic detergent normally replace the anionic dye in the gel (13Krause F. Reifschneider N.H. Vocke D. Seelert H. Rexroth S. Dencher N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48369-48375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In a comparative study, no significant amount of the supercomplex was detected in the mutant lacking cardiolipin when using BN-PAGE, whereas mainly supercomplex was found in the same mutant when CN-PAGE was employed in the absence of detergent (12Pfeiffer K. Gohil V. Stuart R.A. Hunte C. Brandt U. Greenberg M.L. Schagger H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52873-52880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). It was concluded that the anionic dye induced dissociation of the loosely associated complexes III and IV in the absence of cardiolipin and that the supercomplex still existed in the mutant mitochondria, although cardiolipin was essential for its stabilization. On the other hand, because no detergent or anionic dye was introduced during gel separation, the possibility of aggregation between detergent-solubilized membrane components resulting in loss of components was not excluded. In this study, we employed CN-PAGE at concentrations of digitonin in the gel that were much lower than that used to extract the supercomplex. Next, we investigated the cardiolipin-dependent association of complexes III and IV into a supercomplex in intact yeast mitochondria. To avoid treatment of mitochondria with any detergent or dye, we compared the organization of the respiratory chain in wild type and cardiolipin-lacking mitochondria using a functional, kinetic analysis developed previously for the study of the organization of the respiratory chain of S. cerevisiae (14Boumans H. Grivell L.A. Berden J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4872-4877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In that study, titration with the complex III-specific inhibitor antimycin A was used to distinguish the organization of the respiratory chain into a single functional unit from independent localization of the redox components of the respiratory chain in the lipid bilayer connected by randomly diffusing small carriers, Coenzyme Q (CoQ) and cytochrome c, which behave in the membrane as homogeneous diffusible pools. It was found that the S. cerevisiae respiratory chain was titrated as a single functional unit (14Boumans H. Grivell L.A. Berden J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4872-4877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), which is in good agreement with a supercomplex model in wild type mitochondria. Using the same kinetic analysis, we report here that the cytochrome c in the respiratory chain in intact mitochondria lacking cardiolipin displays pool behavior. This result is consistent with our previous observation based on the molecular organization of solubilized components of the respiratory chain (10Zhang M. Mileykovskaya E. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43553-43556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar) and demonstrates for the first time that cardiolipin plays an essential role in supercomplex formation in intact mitochondria, rather than merely providing added stability to the supercomplex. Yeast Strain and Growth Media—Wild type yeast strain DL1 and its CRD1 null derivatives (crd1Δ) lacking cardiolipin, YZD5 (15Zhang M. Su X. Mileykovskaya E. Amoscato A.A. Dowhan W. J. Biol.

Mitochondrial Isolation—Mitochondria were isolated as previously described (16Glick B.S. Pon L.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Cells were grown in YPEG media to the mid-exponential phase of growth, harvested at 1500 × g (GSA rotor, Sorval) for 5 min at 4 °C, washed with cold water, and resuspended in 100 mm Tris-SO4 (pH 9.4) at a ratio of 2 ml/g wet weight cells. Thereafter, the cells were incubated with 10 mm dithiothreitol at 30 °C for 15 min with gentle shaking, centrifuged at 2000 × g (Sorval, SS-34 rotor here and later, if not specified) for 5 min, washed with 2 ml of 1 m cold sorbitol/1 g of cells, and digested with Zymolase-20T (25 mg/g of wet weight cells) in buffer containing 1 m sorbitol, 20 mm potassium Pi buffer (pH 7.2) at 37 °C for ∼30–40 min. Spheroplasts were washed with 1 m cold sorbitol and lysed at 4 °C by Dounce homogenization in 0.5 m sorbitol, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.02% bovine serum albumin supplemented with 1/1000 volume of Protease Inhibitor Mixture Set IV (Calbiochem®). After homogenization, the samples were centrifuged at 1500 × g for 5 min, and then the supernatant was transferred to a new tube and centrifuged again at 1500 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was once again centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min. Pellets were washed with 20 ml of SE buffer (250 mm sucrose, 10 mm MOPS, 1 mm EDTA (pH 7.2)) and centrifuged at 1500 × g for 5 min. Supernatant from the last centrifugation was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Mitochondria (pellets) were suspended in SE buffer and frozen in 0.1-ml aliquots at –80 °C. Protein concentration was measured using the Bradford method (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Mitoplast Preparation—Isolated mitochondria in SE buffer were diluted 15-fold with hypotonic buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.4)). After incubating on ice for 30 min, the mitoplasts were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and redissolved in SE buffer (17Glick B.S. Brandt A. Cunningham K. Muller S. Hallberg R.L. Schatz G. Cell. 1992; 69: 809-822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 18Glick B.S. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 224-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Changes in the ratio of mitochondrial outer membrane porin (voltage-dependent anion channel or VDAC) to subunit 2 of complex IV were estimated by Western blotting with antibody to these proteins (Molecular Probes) and were used as an indicator of mitoplast formation. CN-PAGE—Mitochondria (75 μg of protein) were solubilized in 15 μl of buffer containing 1% digitonin (w/v recrystallized digitonin), 50 mm potassium acetate, 30 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.4), 10% glycerol, 0.1 mg/ml α2-macroglobulin, 0.1% (v/v) protease inhibitor mixture set IV for 30 min on ice. After solubilization, the samples were centrifuged at 125,000 × g for 30 min (Beckman TL-100 ultracentrifuge, TLA100.3 rotor). The supernatant (15 μl) was transferred to a new tube, supplemented with 1.5 μl of sample buffer containing 500 mm aminocaproic acid, and subjected to electrophoresis in a 4–8% polyacrylamide gradient gel at 80 V for 1 h and then for 4 h at 200 V at 4 °C, cathode buffer (50 mm Tricine, 15 mm BisTris (pH 7.0)) and anode buffer (50 mm BisTris, pH 7.0). Low concentrations of the mild detergent digitonin (0.003 or 0.01%, w/v) were added into the gel to achieve separation of the protein complexes in the gel. After CN-PAGE, the gel was soaked in Western blotting buffer (20% methanol (v/v), 0.02% SDS, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 0.15 m glycine) with gentle shaking for 60 min. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose sheets using a semidry apparatus (MilliBlot™-Graphite Electroblotter I, Millipore Corporation) at 40 V for 1.5 h at 4 °C. Cathode buffer was used as the buffer during transfer. Proteins were then specifically located using monoclonal antibody (Molecular Probes) specific for subunit 3 (Cox3p) of complex IV or polyclonal antibody (Gottfried Schatz, Biozentrum, Basel, Switzerland) specific for the cytochrome b component (Cobp) of complex III. Final detection was with secondary antibodies linked to horseradish peroxidase using SuperSignal® West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) and a Bio-Rad Fluor-S™Max MultiImager for quantification. High molecular mass native markers from Amersham Biosciences were used as standards and included thyroglobulin (669 kDa) and ferritin (440 kDa). Cytochrome b Concentration in Mitochondria—The cytochrome b concentration was determined spectroscopically (Hitachi U-3000) from the absorption difference spectra. Either solid dithionite or 10 μm ferricyanide was added to either reduce or oxidize the cytochrome, respectively, and the visible difference spectrum (reduced versus oxidized) was determined. An absorbance coefficient of 28.0 for the maximum (at 563 nm) minus the minimum (at 577 nm) difference was used to determine cytochrome b concentration (19Berden J.A. Slater E.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 216: 237-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Electron Transfer Activity of Complex III—Q2H2 (reduced CoQ2): cytochrome c oxidoreductase activity of isolated mitochondria (0.02–0.1 mg/ml) was determined at 30 °C by measuring the reduction of 18 μm yeast ferricytochrome c at 550 nm by 25 μm Q2H2 in 20 mm potassium Pi (pH 7.4), 2 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm KCN in the presence of different concentrations of antimycin A (14Boumans H. Grivell L.A. Berden J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4872-4877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) using a Hitachi U-3000 spectrophotometer. An extinction coefficient for reduced cytochrome c at 550 nm of 18.5 mm–1 cm–1 was used to calculate the reductase activity (20Kubota T. Yoshikawa S. Matsubara H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 111: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Respiratory Activity of Isolated Mitochondria—Oxygen consumption rates were measured at 30 °C with a Clark oxygen electrode. Rates were determined from the slope of a plot of O2 concentration versus time. Mitochondria (0.03–0.06 mg/ml) were incubated in buffer containing 0.6 m sorbitol, 25 mm potassium Pi (pH 7.0), 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm MgCl2 in a final volume of 3 ml. After 2 min of preincubation with antimycin A (dissolved in methanol), 0.5 mm NADH was added to the reaction chamber (14Boumans H. Grivell L.A. Berden J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4872-4877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Control samples had an equal volume of methanol. Titrations with antimycin A were carried out at least three times. Definition and Kinetics of Pool Function of Cytochrome c—As established by Boumans et al. (14Boumans H. Grivell L.A. Berden J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4872-4877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), the kinetic behavior of the respiratory chain of yeast is consistent with an ordered molecular assembly, which means that the number of subsequent acceptors a carrier, such as CoQ or cytochrome c, can reach is limited to 1. As organization of the system deviates from an ordered array, the number of subsequent acceptors increases from 1, dependent on the degree of pool function of a freely diffusing carrier. When cytochrome c is present as a pool, respiratory activity (Vo) can be described as a function of the maximum rate of reduction (Vred) of cytochrome c and the maximum rate of oxidation (Vox) of cytochrome c by equation 1 (14Boumans H.

Chem. 1998; 273: 4872-4877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), which targets the quinone reduction site of the complex and binds in a 1:1 ratio (22Tsai A.L. Palmer G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 681: 484-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In this case, antimycin A titrates the reduction rate of cytochrome c (Vred). The respiratory chain of S. cerevisiae, unlike that of mammals, does not contain complex I (23de Vries S. Marres C.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 895: 205-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Instead, inner membrane-bound NADH dehydrogenases Ndi1p (internal, faces the matrix) and Nde1p (external, faces the intermembrane space) are present, which transfer the electrons without translocation of protons across the membrane (24Marres C.A. de Vries S. Grivell L.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 195: 857-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). When NADH is used as a substrate in isolated S. cerevisiae mitochondria, it reduces CoQ via external NADH dehydrogenase and provides the highest reduction rate for cytochrome c, which was previously established (14Boumans H. Grivell L.A. Berden J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4872-4877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) to be a necessary prerequisite for measuring cytochrome c pool function. The titrated respiratory activity, Vx, can be described by equation 2, where Vx is the activity at a given antimycin A concentration and x is the fraction of complex III inhibited at a given antimycin A concentration (14Boumans H. Grivell L.A. Berden J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4872-4877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Equation 3 is derived from equation 2 by dividing both sides by Vo (initial respiratory activity without antimycin A) and was used to fit the data using the Kaleida Graph program. The y-axis on graphs (Fig. 3) represents the relative NADH oxidase activity (Vx/Vo). The x-axis represents the fractional saturation by antimycin A. Saturation with antimycin A was determined in the fitting procedure of the experimental data, with equation 3 as the concentration of antimycin A at which the curve crosses the x-scale (Vx/Vo = 0; complete inhibition) and was set to 1. Vred/Vo, the maximum rate of reduction (which is titrated with antimycin A) relative to the Vo, is referred to as Vtitr in Table I. The values of this coefficient for curves represented in Fig. 3 were obtained in the fitting procedure of the experimental data using equation 3 in the Kaleida Graph program. If the value for Vtitr is close to 1, the above hyperbolic relationship (equation 3) approximates a straight line relationship between relative NADH oxidase activity and relative saturation by antimycin A. This would be consistent with complex III, cytochrome c, and complex IV functioning as a single unit. The deviation of Vtitr from 1 reflects the degree of pool function of cytochrome c and represents its ability to provide interconnection between individual complexes III and IV randomly embedded in the membrane (for details, see Ref. 14Boumans H.

Open table in a new tab Cytochrome c Release from Mitochondria or Mitoplast—Mitochondria (5 mg/ml protein) or mitoplasts (5 mg/ml protein) isolated from both wild type and crd1Δ cells after exponential growth at 30 °C in YPEG were resuspended in mitochondrial respiratory buffer containing either 0.6 m sorbitol, 25 mm potassium Pi (pH 7.0), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, or the above buffer plus 300 mm KCl (pH 7.0). The samples were supplemented with 0.5 mm NADH and the same concentration of methanol as described under “Experimental Procedures” to mimic the exact conditions of the oxygen consumption measurement. After incubation under the same condition as in the respiration experiment for the indicated time, the samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min. Supernatants were centrifuged once more to avoid mitochondrial contamination and concentrated by 10% trichloroacetic acid precipitation in the presence of 0.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. The resulting supernatants (released cytochrome c) and pellets (mitochondrial-bound cytochrome c) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting (15Zhang M. Su X. Mileykovskaya E. Amoscato A.A. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35204-35210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) with a monoclonal anticytochrome c antibody (BD Biosciences) for the presence of cytochrome c. The same amount of total pellet protein in sufficient amounts for detection was loaded in each lane, whereas all the protein recovered from the supernatant was loaded in each lane. Lack of Supercomplex Formation between Complexes III and IV as Detected by CN-PAGE—The anionic dye Coomassie Blue used in BN-PAGE analysis may result in the dissociation of weakly bound complexes (12Pfeiffer K.

Therefore, a gentler technique of CN-PAGE in which the anionic dye is replaced by low levels of nonionic detergent was employed to verify the results obtained by BN-PAGE (10Zhang M. Mileykovskaya E. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43553-43556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). To minimize nonspecific membrane protein aggregation in the absence of the anionic dye, low concentrations of mild detergent digitonin (0.01 or 0.003% w/v), which were much lower then those used for extraction (1%), were added during CN-PAGE. In CN-PAGE, the direction and mobility of protein complexes are determined by the intrinsic charge of the complexes and their apparent molecular size, whereas in BN-PAGE, the presence of the protein-bound anionic dye is assumed to normalize all protein components to the same charge to mass ratio, so that electrophoretic mobility within the gel is dependent only on apparent molecular size. Consistent with the results using BN-PAGE analysis (10Zhang M. Mileykovskaya E. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43553-43556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar, 12Pfeiffer K. Gohil V. Stuart R.A. Hunte C. Brandt U. Greenberg M.L. Schagger H. J. Biol.

Digitonin extracts of mitochondria isolated from crd1Δ cells showed primarily bands in which mobilities were consistent with a homodimer of complex III (∼600 kDa) (Fig. 1, lane 4) and a homodimer of complex IV (∼400 kDa, Fig. 1, lane 2). No supercomplex was observed using CN-PAGE analysis of mitochondria lacking cardiolipin (Fig. 1, lanes 2 and 4), but trace amounts of intermediate molecular species containing both Cox3p and Cobp were present. In the experiment presented in Fig. 1, 0.003% (w/v) digitonin was introduced into the gel for CN-PAGE. A gel with 0.01% (w/v) digitonin displayed the same protein pattern (data not shown). Titration of Q2H2:Cytochrome c Oxidoreductase Activity in Mitochondria with Antimycin A—To establish the lack of supercomplex formation between complexes III and IV in cardiolipin-lacking (crd1Δ) intact mitochondria, as suggested by CN-PAGE, we used an independent kinetic approach that avoids membrane solubilization by digitonin and the introduction of charged dyes. We first compared the sensitivity of complex III to antimycin A in wild type and cardiolipin-deficient mitochondria. Antimycin A is a specific inhibitor of complex III, which binds to the complex in a 1:1 ratio (22Tsai A.L. Palmer G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 681: 484-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Because it was shown previously for purified complex III that delipidation can change the affinity of the complex for antimycin A (25Tsai A.L. Palmer G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 852: 100-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), we tested whether antimycin A has the same inhibitory effect on complex III in mitochondria from wild type (CRD1) and crd1Δ strains. The concentration of cytochrome b was measured by absorption difference spectra as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Both CRD1 and crd1Δ mitochondria contained cytochrome b at a concentration of ∼0.2 nmol/mg protein. Mitochondria from both strains had a similar Q2H2:cytochrome c oxidoreductase activity (500–600 nmoles/min/mg). Under the conditions of our experiments, a linear relationship between antimycin A concentration and electron transfer activity was observed in both wild type, as reported by Ref. 14Boumans H. Grivell L.A. Berden J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4872-4877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, and cardiolipin-deficient mitochondria. In both cases, the relative inhibition of complex III activity by antimycin A can be viewed directly as the relative saturation of the complex with the antimycin A, suggesting that lack of cardiolipin did not alter the sensitivity of complex III to antimycin A (Fig. 2). Pool Versus Non-Pool Behavior of Cytochrome c—The kinetic characterization of the electron carrier cytochrome c between complexes III and IV should provide evidence of whether mitochondria lacking cardiolipin contain a physiologically functional supercomplex or individual complexes. Mitochondria from both CRD1 and crd1Δ cells were analyzed for oxygen consumption using NADH as the substrate. If, as in wild type cells, complexes III and IV are associated into a supercomplex with channeling of cytochrome c, a linear relationship (Vtitr approaching 1) between the saturation of complex III with antimycin A and inhibition of the relative respiratory activity should be observed, because inhibition of complex III would reflect the inhibition of the whole supercomplex. If complexes III and IV exist as individual complexes, then cytochrome c would mediate electron transfer between them as a freely diffusible carrier producing interconnection between non-inhibited complexes III and comple"

Where it thrives, a native fish on the endangered list, the European cyprinid Leucaspius delineatus, declines. The disappearing fish are victims of an infectious pathogen, probably carried by healthy Asian fish. The signs are that this might affect other fish species in Europe and also have implications for commercial aquaculture. The deliberate introduction of new species can have unexpected negative consequences1,2 and we show here how a recently introduced fish, the invasive Asian cyprinid Pseudorasbora parva, is causing increased mortality and totally inhibiting spawning in an already endangered native fish, the European cyprinid Leucaspius delineatus. This threat is caused by an infectious pathogen, a rosette-like intracellular eukaryotic parasite that is a deadly, non-specific agent. It is probably carried by healthy Asian fish, and could decrease fish biodiversity in Europe, as well as having implications for commercial aquaculture."

So far, because of the impairment of maturation and of the targeting process, transfecting DUOX into nonthyroid cell lines has not led to the expression of a functional H2O2-generating system at the plasma membrane. For the first time, we investigated the H2O2-generating activity in the particulate fractions from DUOX2- and DUOX1-transfected HEK293 and Chinese hamster ovary cells. The particulate fractions of these cells stably or transiently transfected with human or porcine DUOX cDNA demonstrate a functional NADPH/Ca2+-dependent H2O2-generating activity. The immature Duox proteins had less activity than pig thyrocyte particulate fractions, and their activity depended on their primary structures. Human Duox2 seemed to be more active than human Duox1 but only half as active as its porcine counterpart. TPO co-transfection produced a slight increase in the enzymatic activity, whereas p22phox, the 22-kDa subunit of the leukocyte NADPH oxidase, had no effect. In previous studies on the mechanism of H2O2 formation, it was shown that mature thyroid NADPH oxidase does not release O2·¯ but H2O2. Using a spin-trapping technique combined with electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, we confirmed this result but also demonstrated that the partially glycosylated form of Duox2, located in the endoplasmic reticulum, generates superoxide in a calcium-dependent manner. These results suggest that post-translational modifications during the maturation process of Duox2 could be implicated in the mechanism of H2O2 formation by favoring intramolecular superoxide dismutation.

Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1995; 18: 775-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (1069) Google Scholar). NAD(P)H oxidases are a major source of ROS. Phagocyte oxidase is the oxidase that has been investigated most thoroughly (2Babior B.M. Blood. 1999; 93: 1464-1476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It catalyzes the production of superoxide by the one-electron reduction of oxygen, using NADPH as the electron donor. The catalytic moiety of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase is gp91phox, a plasma membrane-associated flavohemoprotein. Recently, it was discovered that gp91phox belongs to a family consisting of several very similar oxidases. Seven NOX (NADPH oxidase) and DUOX/ThOX (dual oxidase/thyroid oxidase) genes have been identified that encode different NADPH oxidases with differing mRNA tissue expression. The Nox family comprises gp91phox, now known as Nox2; Nox1, which is predominantly expressed in the colon (3Suh Y.A. Arnold R.S. Lassegue B. Shi J. Xu X. Sorescu D. Chung A.B. Griendling K.K.

FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1502-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that Duox2, which was identified by purifying thyroid NADPH oxidase, may constitute the catalytic core of this enzyme and generate the H2O2 used by Tpo to catalyze the biosynthesis of thyroid hormones at the apical surface of the thyrocytes (13Dupuy C. Ohayon R. Valent A. Noel-Hudson M.S. Deme D. Virion A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37265-37269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Although no functional Duox-based H2O2-generating system has yet been reconstituted (21De Deken X. Wang D. Dumont J.E. Miot F. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 273: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), this proposal is corroborated by a recent report of permanent and severe congenital hypothyroidism in a patient with a biallelic inactivating mutation in the DUOX2 gene (22Moreno J.C. Bikker H. Kempers M.J. van Trotsenburg A.S. Baas F. de Vijlder J.J. Vulsma T. Ris-Stalpers C. N. Engl. J. Med. 2002; 347: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Because Duox2 is also co-expressed with lactoperoxidase in the salivary gland and rectum, it has been suggested that it may be the source of H2O2 for lactoperoxidase-catalyzed reactions implicated in a host defense mechanism (15Geiszt M. Witta J. Baffi J. Lekstrom K. Leto T.L. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1502-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). A Duox-based enzyme is also involved in stabilizing the cuticle of Caenorhabditis elegans by the peroxidase-catalyzed formation of tyrosine-tyrosine bonds (23Edens W.A. Sharling L. Cheng G. Shapira R. Kinkade J.M. Lee T Edens H.A. Tang X. Sullards C. Flaherty D.B. Benian G.M. Lambeth J.D. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 879-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). This means that Duox2 must generate H2O2 for peroxidase reactions catalyzed either by distinct peroxidases, such as Tpo and lactoperoxidase, or by the peroxidase-like ectodomain of Duox2 itself (23Edens W.A. Sharling L. Cheng G. Shapira R. Kinkade J.M. Lee T Edens H.A. Tang X. Sullards C. Flaherty D.B. Benian G.M. Lambeth J.D. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 879-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). On the basis of their homology with gp91phox/Nox2, the Duox proteins are believed to generate superoxide anions that could dismute into H2O2 (24Lambeth J.D. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (2492) Google Scholar). Here, using particulate fractions from DUOX2-transfected nonthyroid cells, we provide data showing for the first time that the partially N-glycosylated form of the Duox2 protein generates H2O2 via dismutation of the superoxide anion ( O2·¯) in a NADPH/Ca2+-dependent manner. Interestingly, we found that the level of H2O2 formation activity depended on the primary structure of the Duox proteins, since human Duox1 appeared to be less active than human Duox2, and porcine Duox2 was twice as active as its human counterpart. Tpo, found recently to be associated with Duoxs in human thyrocyte (25Wang D. De Deken X. Milenkovic M. Song Y. Pirson I. Dumont J.E. Miot F. J. Biol.

Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 1241-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), 1% penicillin, 1% streptomycin, 1% Fungizone, and 100 μg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen). The human NOX5b-transfected and control-transfected HEK293 cells (kind gift of K. H. Krause, Biology of Aging Laboratories, University of Geneva) (7Banfi B. Molnar G. Maturana A. Steger K. Hegedus B. Demaurex N. Krause K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37594-37601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar) were cultured in the presence or absence of 400 μg/ml G418 instead of Zeocin. Stable and Transient Cell Transfection—The stable human DUOX1- and DUOX2-expressing cell lines were established using the Flp-In system (Invitrogen). The protocol accompanying the kit was used without modification. Human DUOX1 and DUOX2 cDNAs were subcloned in pcDNA5/FRT vector (Invitrogen) designed for use with the Flp-In system. When cotransfected with the pOG44 Flp recombinase expression plasmid into an Flp-In-293 cell line, the pcDNA5/FRT vector containing DUOX1 or DUOX2 cDNA was integrated in an Flp recombinase-dependent manner into the genome. Stable cell lines were established by exposure to 100 μg/ml hygromycin. In transient cell transfection experiments, HEK293 cells reaching 50–60% confluence were transfected using the calcium phosphate precipitation procedure and the Invitrogen protocol. HEK293 cells were incubated overnight with calcium phosphate in the presence of 50 μgof pcDNA3.1-human DUOX2 or pcDNA3.1-porcine DUOX2. 24 h after transfection, 20 μm hemin was added to the medium. After 48 h, the cells were harvested. CHO cells were transiently transfected, using the FuGENE (Roche Applied Science) transfection reagent instead of the calcium phosphate procedure. The pcDNA3.1-GFP vector was purchased from Invitrogen. Full-length 3060-kilobase pair human TPO cDNA (kindly provided by B. Rapoport, Cedars-Sinai Research Institute, Los Angeles, CA) was cloned into the vector pcDNA3.1 as previously described (29Fayadat L. Niccoli-Sire P. Lanet J. Franc J.L. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4277-4285Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The human p22phox cDNA (kindly provided by M. Dinauer, Cancer Research Institute R4, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN) was cloned into the EcoRI sites of the vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). The Flp-In-293 cells stably expressing the human Duox2 were incubated overnight with calcium phosphate in the presence of 50 μg of pcDNA3.1-h TPO or pcDNA3.1-hp22phox or both. 24 h after transfection, 20 μm hemin was added to the medium. After 48 h, the cells were harvested. Preparation of the Cellular Particulate Fraction—Cells were washed with PBS and scraped into the same solution supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors (5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 157 μg/ml benzamidine). After centrifuging at 200 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the cell pellet was homogenized using a motor-driven Teflon pestle homogenizer in 2 ml of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer containing 0.25 m sucrose, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EGTA (pH 7.2), and the mixture of protease inhibitors. After centrifuging at 200,000 × g for 30 min, the pellet was resuspended in 0.5 ml of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm MgCl2, and the mixture of protease inhibitors. The same protocol was used to obtain follicular particulate fractions, except that follicles from two Petri dishes (about 2 × 107 cells) were collected by centrifuging at 200 × g for 7 min before being resuspended in 2 ml of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer containing 0.25 m sucrose, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EGTA (pH 7.2), and the mixture of protease inhibitors. Preparation of Thyroid Plasma Membranes—The preparation of plasma membranes was as previously described (30Dupuy C. Kaniewski J. Deme D. Pommier J. Virion A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 185: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Fresh porcine thyroid glands (150 g) were obtained immediately after slaughter and transferred to the laboratory on ice. Fat and connective tissues were removed. The glands were cut into small pieces and homogenized, first with a Sorvall Omni mixer (30 s, 11,000 rpm) in 150 ml of 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, containing 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 16 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (buffer A) and then with an Ultra-Turrax (45 s, 60% Vmax/150 ml) after dilution to 600 ml with buffer A. The homogenate was filtered through six layers of cheesecloth and centrifuged at 4200 × g for 15 min. The pellet was resuspended in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, containing 2 mm MgCl2 and 0.25 m sucrose (buffer B) and washed twice by centrifugation at 4200 × g for 15 min. The final pellet was resuspended in buffer B and mixed with 47 ml of a stock Percoll solution (1 volume of 2.5 m sucrose plus 9 volumes of Percoll); the volume was adjusted to 222 ml with buffer B. After centrifugation in a Sorvall SS34 rotor at 13,000 rpm (20,000 × g) for 30 min, the turbid layer sedimenting at about 1 cm from the top of the gradient was collected and washed with 0.1 m KCl in buffer B by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 15 min. The final pellet was resuspended in 15 ml of buffer B (membrane preparation) quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C. Western Blot Analysis—SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analyses were performed as described previously (31Caillou B. Dupuy C. Lacroix L. Nocera M. Talbot M. Ohayon R. Deme D. Bidart J.M. Schlumberger M. Virion A. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 86: 3351-3358PubMed Google Scholar). Depending on the experiments, an anti-Duox antibody raised against a 14-amino acid peptide encompassing the Leu410–Thr423 portion of human Duox2, which is exactly conserved in porcine Duox2, or raised against the first intracellular domain Glu636–Arg1039 of human Duox2, were used to probe the immunoblots. Immune complexes were detected with an alkaline phosphatase-coupled, anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Promega). Human Duox1 was immunodetected using anti-Duox1 antibody kindly given by F. Miot, Institut de Recherche Interdisciplinaire en Biologie Humaine et Moléculaire (IRIBHM), Université Libre de Bruxelles, Brussels) (14De Deken X. Wang D. Many M.C. Costagliola S. Libert F. Vassart G. Dumont J.E. Miot F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23227-23233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Human thyroperoxidase was immunodetected with a polyclonal rabbit anti-porcine Tpo antibody (dilution 1:2000) obtained as previously described (32Virion A. Courtin F. Deme D. Michot J.L. Kaniewski J. Pommier J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 242: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The anti-GFP antibody was purchased from Invitrogen. The anti-p22phox antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz (Tebu-France). Determination of the Protein Content—The protein content was determined using the Bradford method (33Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Measurement of the H2O2 Production of the Particulate Fractions— The NADPH-dependent H2O2-generating activity of the particles was determined as previously described (34Leseney A.M. Deme D. Legue O. Ohayon R. Chanson P. Sales J.P. Pires de Carvalho D. Dupuy C. Virion A. Biochimie (Paris). 1999; 81: 373-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Samples of cellular particulate fraction were incubated at 30 °C in 0.5 ml of 200 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm NaN3, 1 mm EGTA, 1.5 mm CaCl2, and 0.1 μm FAD. The reaction was started by adding 100 μm NADPH. 100-μl samples were collected at times up to 30 min and mixed with 10 μl of 3 n HCl to stop the reaction by destroying the remaining NAD(P)H. The Ca2+ dependence of the H2O2 formation was determined by assaying parallel samples without Ca2+ in the presence of 1 mm EGTA. The amount of H2O2 in each sample was measured in 200 mm, pH 7.8, phosphate buffer by monitoring the decrease in 0.25 μm scopoletin fluorescence in the presence of horseradish peroxidase in a Hitachi F-2000 spectrofluorimeter. In some experiments, the fluorescence (excitation 320 nm; emission, 420 nm) was measured in a Fluostar spectrofluorimeter (BMG LabTech) after adding to each aliquot 90 μlof200 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 500 μm homovanilic acid and 3 μg/ml horseradish peroxidase. 10 μlof3 n NaOH was added to neutralize the medium after incubating for 15 min with HCl. The activity was measured using a standard curve obtained by incubating increasing amounts of H2O2 (0–10 μm) in the same solution. Both methods measured the H2O2 produced either directly or through O2·¯ dismutation and gave the same results. All superoxide anions that could have been generated during incubation spontaneously disproportionated to form H2O2 before horseradish peroxidase and its substrate (scopoletin or homovanilic acid) were added. Measurement of H2O2 Release from Open Follicles and Cells—The H2O2 released by porcine cells and HEK293 transiently transfected cells in the medium was determined by measuring the oxidation of homovanilic acid into its fluorescent derivative in the presence of horseradish peroxidase (28Morand S. Chaaraoui M. Kaniewski J. Deme D. Ohayon R. Noel-Hudson M.S. Virion A. Dupuy C. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 1241-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Cells and follicles from six wells were washed twice with Hepes-buffered Earle's solution and incubated for 45 min at 37 °C in 0.8 ml of Hepes-buffered Earle's solution containing 0.44 mm homovanilic acid, 10 μg/ml (2 units/ml) horseradish peroxidase, and 1 mm sodium azide, with or without 5 μm ionomycin. At the end of the incubation, 200 μl of medium from each well was collected, and the fluorescence level was measured (320- and 420-nm excitation and emission, respectively). The H2O2 release was determined using a standard curve obtained by incubating increasing amounts of H2O2 (0–25 μm) in the same solution. Generation of Duox2 Constructs—Eight cysteine residues are present in the N-terminal domain of the pig Duox2, and their roles have been analyzed in a previous study (35Morand S. Agnandji D. Noel-Hudson M.S. Nicolas V. Buisson S. Macon-Lemaitre L. Gnidehou S. Kaniewski J. Ohayon R. Virion A. Dupuy C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30244-30251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These cysteine residues were replaced by glycines by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. Deletion of the extracellular domain of Duox2 was also created using the same kit with the pig DUOX2-pcDNA3.1 vector as a template. The Δ151–555 deletion was created using 5′-GACGTGGTGCTGCCCTTCCAGAGGTCCAGTGCCCTGCAGCCCAATGTC-3′ and 5′-GACATTGGGCTGCAGGGCACTGGACCTCTGGAAGGGCAGCACCACGTC-3′ as mutagenic oligonucleotides. The constructs were confirmed by sequencing. Measurement of Superoxide Formation by Spin Trapping and Electron Paramagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (EPR)—The spin trap 5-tert-butyloxycarbonyl 5-methyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (BMPO) was synthesized using the procedure described by Zhao et al. (36Zhao H. Joseph J. Zhang H. Karoui H. Kalyanaraman B. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). A typical incubation mixture contained 0.1 mm NADPH, 1 mm NaN3, 1 mm EDTA, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 0.1 μm FAD, and 50 mm BMPO in 200 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4. Proteins from particulate fractions of HEK293 cells stably transfected with human NOX5b (25 μg) or from particulate fractions of HEK293 cells transiently transfected with porcine Duox2 (370 μg) were mixed with the previous mixture and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C (total incubation volume 700 μl). The reaction mixture was quenched by freezing in liquid nitrogen and thawed and centrifuged for 5 min at 10,000 rpm at 4 °C just before EPR analysis. The supernatant was rapidly transferred into the Aqua-X sample cell fitted in an shq001 cavity (Bruker, Wissembourg, France), and data accumulation was started immediately. To analyze superoxide production in the thyroid cell, pig thyroid follicles were used for the EPR experiment. Open follicles (∼2 × 106 cells) were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in 0.8 ml of Hepes-buffered Earle's solution (pH 7.2) containing 1 mm sodium azide, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 μm ionomycin, and 50 mm BMPO. The reaction mixture was analyzed as indicated above. All measurements were carried out at 20 °C in a Bruker EPR Elexsys 500 spectrometer operating at X-band frequency (9.82 GHz). The following instrument settings were used: field modulation frequency, 100 kHz; field modulation amplitude, 0.2 milliteslas; time constant, 0.081 s; microwave power, 5.1 milliwatts; scan time, 41.9 s; averaged scans, 9. BMPO-OOH and BMPO-OH spectra were identified by comparison with incubations performed in the presence of xanthine/xanthine oxidase (for BMPO-OOH) as previously described (36Zhao H. Joseph J. Zhang H. Karoui H. Kalyanaraman B. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). As expected, the BMPO-OOH spin adduct spontaneously decomposed to the BMPO-OH spin adduct with a half-life of about 15 min (36Zhao H. Joseph J. Zhang H. Karoui H. Kalyanaraman B. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), and its formation was completely abolished in the presence of SOD. The relative amounts of BMPO-OOH and BMPO-OH adducts observed in the incubation mixtures were estimated by Xsophe software simulations (Bruker). The second peaks of the BMPO-OOH and BMPO-OH adducts are superimposed (maximum, 348.8 milliteslas; minimum, 349.2 milliteslas), and the amplitude of this peak was used to quantify the amounts of superoxide generated in our incubations. The term “BMPO-OOH spin adduct” will be used instead of “BMPO-OOH and BMPO-OH spin adducts” throughout this work for brevity's sake. NADPH/Ca2+-dependent H2O2 Generation Catalyzed by Duox2 and Duox1—Using the Flp-In system, two stable, isogenic HEK293 cell lines were generated expressing human Duox1 and Duox2, respectively. This system has the advantage of making it possible to integrate DUOX1 and DUOX2 into the cells at the same specific genomic location, thus generating two cell lines with comparable expression of DUOX1 and DUOX2. Two antibodies directed against the median domain of each of these proteins were used to evaluate their respective levels of expression by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1A). The antibodies revealed Duox1/2 as two bands with apparent molecular masses of 150 and 165 kDa, corresponding to the nonglycosylated and partially glycosylated form, respectively (21De Deken X. Wang D. Dumont J.E. Miot F. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 273: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 28Morand S. Chaaraoui M. Kaniewski J. Deme D. Ohayon R. Noel-Hudson M.S. Virion A. Dupuy C.

https://openalex.org/W2001075170,"Haemoglobin C, which carries a glutamate-to-lysine mutation in the beta-globin chain, protects West African children against Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Mechanisms of protection are not established for the heterozygous (haemoglobin AC) or homozygous (haemoglobin CC) states. Here we report a marked effect of haemoglobin C on the cell-surface properties of P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes involved in pathogenesis. Relative to parasite-infected normal erythrocytes (haemoglobin AA), parasitized AC and CC erythrocytes show reduced adhesion to endothelial monolayers expressing CD36 and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). They also show impaired rosetting interactions with non-parasitized erythrocytes, and reduced agglutination in the presence of pooled sera from malaria-immune adults. Abnormal cell-surface display of the main variable cytoadherence ligand, PfEMP-1 (P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein-1), correlates with these findings. The abnormalities in PfEMP-1 display are associated with markers of erythrocyte senescence, and are greater in CC than in AC erythrocytes. Haemoglobin C might protect against malaria by reducing PfEMP-1-mediated adherence of parasitized erythrocytes, thereby mitigating the effects of their sequestration in the microvasculature."
https://openalex.org/W2068912108,"Endogenously expressed canonical transient receptor potential (TRPC) homologs were investigated for their role in forming store-operated, 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-<i>sn</i>-glycerol-stimulated, or carbachol (CCh)-stimulated calcium entry pathways in HEK-293 cells. Measurement of thapsigargin-stimulated Ba<sup>2+</sup> entry indicated that the individual suppression of TRPC1, TRPC3, or TRPC7 protein levels, by small interfering RNA (siRNA) techniques, dramatically inhibited (52–68%) store-operated calcium entry (SOCE), whereas suppression of TRPC4 or TRPC6 had no effect. Combined suppression of TRPC1-TRPC3, TRPC1-TRPC7, TRPC3-TRPC7, or TRPC1-TRPC3-TRPC7 gave only slightly more inhibition of SOCE (74–78%) than seen with suppression of TRPC1 alone (68%), suggesting that these three TRPC homologs work in tandem to mediate a large component of SOCE. Evidence from co-immunoprecipitation experiments indicates that a TRPC1-TRPC3-TRPC7 complex, predicted from siRNA results, does exist. The suppression of either TRPC3 or TRPC7, but not TRPC1, induced a high Ba<sup>2+</sup> leak flux that was inhibited by 2-APB and SKF96365, suggesting that the influx is via leaky store-operated channels. The high Ba<sup>2+</sup> leak flux is eliminated by co-suppression of TRPC1-TRPC3 or TRPC1-TRPC7. For 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-<i>sn</i>-glycerol-stimulated cells, siRNA data indicate that TRPC1 plays no role in mediating Ba<sup>2+</sup> entry, which appears to be mediated by the participation of TRPC3, TRPC4, TRPC6, and TRPC7. CCh-stimulated Ba<sup>2+</sup> entry, on the other hand, could be inhibited by suppression of any of the five endogenously expressed TRPC homologs, with the degree of inhibition being consistent with CCh stimulation of both store-operated and receptor-operated channels. In summary, endogenous TRPC1, TRPC3, and TRPC7 participate in forming heteromeric store-operated channels, whereas TRPC3 and TRPC7 can also participate in forming heteromeric receptor-operated channels."
https://openalex.org/W2004996851,"Site-specific DNA recombination is important for basic cellular functions including viral integration, control of gene expression, production of genetic diversity and segregation of newly replicated chromosomes, and is used by bacteriophage lambda to integrate or excise its genome into and out of the host chromosome. lambda recombination is carried out by the bacteriophage-encoded integrase protein (lambda-int) together with accessory DNA sites and associated bending proteins that allow regulation in response to cell physiology. Here we report the crystal structures of lambda-int in higher-order complexes with substrates and regulatory DNAs representing different intermediates along the reaction pathway. The structures show how the simultaneous binding of two separate domains of lambda-int to DNA facilitates synapsis and can specify the order of DNA strand cleavage and exchange. An intertwined layer of amino-terminal domains bound to accessory (arm) DNAs shapes the recombination complex in a way that suggests how arm binding shifts the reaction equilibrium in favour of recombinant products."
https://openalex.org/W2164678187,"The molecular mechanisms regulating the sexual development of malaria parasites from gametocytes to oocysts in their mosquito vector are still largely unexplored. In other eukaryotes, NIMA-related kinases (Neks) regulate cell cycle progression and have been implicated in the regulation of meiosis. Here, we demonstrate that Nek-4, a new Plasmodium member of the Nek family, is essential for completion of the sexual cycle of the parasite. Recombinant Plasmodium falciparum Nek-4 possesses protein kinase activity and displays substrate preferences similar to those of other Neks. Nek-4 is highly expressed in gametocytes, yet disruption of the nek-4 gene in the rodent malaria parasite P. berghei has no effect on gamete formation and subsequent fertilization. However, further differentiation of zygotes into ookinetes is abolished. Measurements of nuclear DNA content indicate that zygotes lacking Nek-4 fail to undergo the genome replication to the tetraploid level that precedes meiosis. Cell cycle progression in the zygote is identified as a likely precondition for its morphological transition to the ookinete and for the successful establishment of a malaria infection in the mosquito."

https://openalex.org/W2115662076,"Phosphorylation of keratin intermediate filaments (IF) is known to affect their assembly state and organization; however, little is known about the mechanisms regulating keratin phosphorylation. In this study, we demonstrate that shear stress, but not stretch, causes disassembly of keratin IF in lung alveolar epithelial cells (AEC) and that this disassembly is regulated by protein kinase C δ-mediated phosphorylation of keratin 8 (K8) Ser-73. Specifically, in AEC subjected to shear stress, keratin IF are disassembled, as reflected by their increased solubility. In contrast, AEC subjected to stretch showed no changes in the state of assembly of IF. Pretreatment with the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor, bisindolymaleimide, prevents the increase in solubility of either K8 or its assembly partner K18 in shear-stressed AEC. Phosphoserine-specific antibodies demonstrate that K8 Ser-73 is phosphorylated in a time-dependent manner in shear-stressed AEC. Furthermore, we showed that shear stress activates PKC δ and that the PKC δ peptide antagonist, δ V1-1, significantly attenuates the shear stress-induced increase in keratin phosphorylation and solubility. These data suggested that shear stress mediates the phosphorylation of serine residues in K8, leading to the disassembly of IF in alveolar epithelial cells.

They are assembled as obligate heteropolymers of type I (K9-K20) and type II (K1-K8) IF proteins (1Moll R. Franke W. Schiller D.L. Geiger B. Krepler R. Cell. 1982; 31: 11-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4534) Google Scholar, 2Herrmann H. Aebi U. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 3Coulombe P.A.

In simple epithelia, such as those found in lung, liver, intestine, and pancreas, combinations of K7, K8, K18, K19, and K20 are expressed in a type I/type II stoichiometric ratio of 1:1 (1Moll R. Franke W. Schiller D.L. Geiger B. Krepler R. Cell. 1982; 31: 11-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4534) Google Scholar). For example, lung alveolar epithelial cells (AEC) express primarily K8 and K18 with variable levels of K7 and K19 (4Paine R. Ben-Ze'ev A. Farmer S.R. Brody J.S. Dev.

Dis. 1989; 139: 343-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The prototype structure of all IF proteins, including keratins, consists of a structurally conserved central coiled-coil α-helix termed the “rod” that is flanked by non-α-helical N-terminal “head” and C-terminal “tail” domains (2Herrmann H. Aebi U. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Most of the structural heterogeneity of the different keratins resides in their head and tail domains, which also contain all of the known phosphorylation sites. Phosphorylation of keratins at specific sites affects their assembly state, and it has been suggested that these modifications play a role in cell signaling (6Ku N. Liao J. Chou C. Omary M. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1996; 15: 429-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). For example, phosphorylation of the N-terminal Ser-33 on K18 enables a cell cycle-dependent interaction between K8 and K18 IFs with members of the 14-3-3 protein family, promotes depolymerization of K8 and K18 in vitro (7Liao J.

More recently, it has been shown that soluble K8 is phosphorylated by p38 kinase upon FasR stimulation (11He T. Stepulak A. Holmstrom T.H. Omary M.B. Eriksson J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10767-10774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of K8 involves three major sites in vivo identified as: Ser-23, Ser-431, and Ser-73. Ser-23 is a highly conserved site among all type II keratins, suggesting a common function for this modification, whereas phosphorylation at Ser-431 increases during mitosis and upon exposure to epidermal growth factor in association with filament reorganization (13Ku N.O. Omary M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7556-7564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). During a variety of cellular stresses, including heat and drug exposure, Ser-73 is phosphorylated, whereas under normal conditions, it remains dephosphorylated. Mechanical stimuli are important modulators of cellular function in tissues, especially in the mechanically ventilated lungs of patients with acute lung injury. Shear stress is a key physical force experienced by AEC in lungs that are fluid-filled and atelectatic. Shear stress is created by the cyclic opening and closing of the edematous, surfactant-depleted, collapsed alveoli. Another physical force experienced by alveolar epithelial cells is stretch, which occurs in the uninjured regions of the lung that are subjected to mechanical ventilator-induced overdistension. Mechanical stimuli, such as shear stress and stretch, are known to activate kinases, such as protein kinase C (14Liu M. Tanswell A.K. Post M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: L667-L683PubMed Google Scholar, 15Cheng J.J. Wung B.S. Chao Y.J. Wang D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31368-31375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Shear stress has also been shown to activate phospholipase C (16Nollert M.U. Eskin S.G. McIntire L.V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 170: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), resulting in the cleavage of phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate into inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, a calcium-mobilizing second messenger, and diacylglycerol, an activator of PKC. Indeed, recent studies have implicated PKC in shear stress-mediated release of nitric oxide (17Wedgwood S. Bekker J.M. Black S.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: L490-L498Google Scholar), shear stress-mediated ERK1/2 activation (18Traub O. Monia B.P. Dean N.M. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31251-31257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and cytoskeletal reorganization. With respect to the latter, external forces such as shear stress can induce rapid and global changes in the patterns of IF in various cell types (19Helmke B.P. Goldman R.D. Davies P.F. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 745-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 20Helmke B.P. Thakker D.B. Goldman R.D. Davies P.F. Biophys.

Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 503-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The importance of IF in maintaining the structural integrity of cells such as AEC derives in part from the unique viscoelastic properties of IF that are not shared by microfilaments and microtubules in vitro (22Janmey P.A. Euteneuer U. Traub P. Schliwa M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). In support of this, it has been shown in situ that fluid shear stress across the apical surface of cultured cells induces a rapid deformation/displacement of vimentin and keratin IF networks in endothelial and epithelial cells, respectively (19Helmke B.P. Goldman R.D. Davies P.F. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 745-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 20Helmke B.P. Thakker D.B. Goldman R.D. Davies P.F. Biophys.

Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 503-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The rapid responses of IF networks to external forces is consistent with the suggestion that the IF cytoskeleton transmits mechanical signals from the cell surface to all regions of the cytoplasm. In this report, we have examined the effects of shear stress and stretch on the assembly state of keratin IF in AEC. We demonstrated that shear stress, but not stretch, results in the disassembly of keratin IF. This disassembly is mediated by the activation of protein kinase C, specifically PKC δ, which selectively phosphorylates Ser-73 on K8. Inhibition of PKC δ prevents the disassembly of keratin IF in shear-stressed AEC. These results showed that PKC is involved in the regulation of the assembly of K8/K18 IF in AEC in response to a mechanical stimulus. Materials—Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA; Sigma) and GF109203x (bisindolylmaleimide; Calbiochem) were used in some experiments. [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) was used for kinase activity assays. PKC antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) and BD Transduction Laboratories. All other reagents were commercial products of the highest grade available. Isolation and Culture of Alveolar Epithelial Cells—Human and rat AEC were used. Human A549 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 50 μg/ml gentamicin, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were incubated in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air at 37 °C. Rat alveolar epithelial type II cells were isolated from pathogen-free male Sprague-Dawley rats (200-225 g), as described previously (23Ridge K.M. Dada L. Lecuona E. Bertorello A.M. Katz A.I. Mochly-Rosen D. Sznajder J.I. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1381-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Briefly, the lungs were perfused via the pulmonary artery, lavaged, and digested with elastase (30 units/ml, Worthington Biochemical Corp.). AEC were purified by differential adherence to IgG-pretreated dishes, and cell viability was assessed by trypan blue exclusion (>95%). Cells were suspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum with 2 mm l-glutamine, 40 μg/ml gentamicin, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin and placed in culture for 2 days prior to the start of all experimental conditions. Cells were incubated in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air at 37 °C. Identification of AEC cells was based on the presence of lamellar inclusions by tannic acid staining (23Ridge K.M. Dada L. Lecuona E. Bertorello A.M. Katz A.I. Mochly-Rosen D. Sznajder J.I. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1381-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In vitro models for cyclic stretch and shear stress were used to examine the effect of these physical forces on keratin IF in AEC. AEC were cultured on 25 × 75 × 1 mm glass slides and subjected to continuous laminar flow to generate shear stress (7.5, 15, and 30 dynes/cm2) using the Flexcell streamer device. Alternatively, AEC were grown on laminin-coated Silastic membrane plates and exposed to cyclic stretch (20% strain; 30 cycles/min) using the Flexcell 4000T system (24Waters C.M. Ridge K.M. Sunio G. Venetsanou K. Sznajder J.I. J. Appl. Physiol. 1999; 87: 715-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Intracellular Peptide Delivery by Transient Permeabilization of AEC—Peptides PKC ϵ (ϵV1-2) and PKC δ (δV1-1 peptide) were synthesized and purified (>95%) at the Stanford Protein and Nucleic Acid Facility (25Johnson J.A. Gray M.O. Karliner J.S. Chen C.H. Mochly-Rosen D. Circ. Res. 1996; 9: 1086-1099Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 26Stebbins E.G. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29644-29650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The peptides were either unmodified or cross-linked via an N-terminal Cys-Cys bond to the Drosophila Antennapedia homeodomain-derived carrier peptide (C-RQIKIWFQNRRMKWKK). Peptides were introduced into cells by either transient permeabilization by using saponin as described previously (23Ridge K.M. Dada L. Lecuona E. Bertorello A.M. Katz A.I. Mochly-Rosen D.

Investig. 2003; 111: 1057-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) with sham permeabilization as control or as carrier-peptide conjugates with a carrier-carrier dimer as control (control peptide). Permeabilization carried out according to these protocols did not alter AEC viability as assayed by lactate dehydrogenase. Immunofluorescence—AEC grown on glass slides or Silastic membranes were rinsed 3× in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed in either methanol (-20 °C) for 4 min or 3.5% formaldehyde at room temperature for 7 min. Following formaldehyde fixation, cells were permeabilized with 0.05% Tween 20 for 5 min. Cells were then washed 3× with PBS and processed for indirect immunofluorescence as described previously (28Yoon M. Moir R.D. Prahlad V. Goldman R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 29Prahlad V. Yoon M. Moir R.D. Vale R.D. Goldman R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 159-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Following staining, the glass slides or Silastic membranes were washed in PBS and mounted in gelvatol containing 100 mg/ml 1,4-diazabicyclo (2.2.2) octane (Aldrich (28Yoon M. Moir R.D. Prahlad V. Goldman R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar)). Images of fixed, stained preparations were taken with a Zeiss LSM 510 microscope (Carl Zeiss) (28Yoon M. Moir R.D. Prahlad V. Goldman R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Protein Isolation, Immunoblotting, and Immunoprecipitation Analysis—Total cell lysates were obtained from AEC after solubilization in Laemmli sample buffer. Keratin-enriched cytoskeletal preparations were made according to previously published procedures (28Yoon M. Moir R.D. Prahlad V. Goldman R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 29Prahlad V. Yoon M. Moir R.D. Vale R.D. Goldman R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 159-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Briefly, the resulting Triton X-100-soluble or Triton X-100-insoluble fractions were prepared by solubilizing cells for 10 min at 4 °C with buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, and a protease inhibitor mix (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm leupeptin, 10 μm pepstatin, and 25 μg/ml aprotinin) in PBS (pH 7.4) followed by centrifugation (16,000 × g, 10 min). The supernatant was collected as the soluble fraction. The pellet was homogenized in 1 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 140 mm NaCl, 1.5 m KCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, and the protease inhibitor mix. After 30 min (4 °C), the homogenate was pelleted (16,000 × g; 10 min), and the pellet (insoluble fraction) was rehomogenized with 5 mm EDTA in PBS, pH 7.4, pelleted (Triton X-100 insoluble fraction), and dissolved in Laemmli sample buffer containing 1% β-mercaptoethanol, sonicated, and boiled for 5 min (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar). The samples were separated on 7.5 or 10% polyacrylamide gels according to the method of Ref. 30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar. Equal amounts of proteins were loaded on 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and blotted with the primary antibodies as follows: 1) LJ4-anti-pK8Ser-73 epitope (11He T. Stepulak A. Holmstrom T.H. Omary M.B. Eriksson J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10767-10774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) (1:1000 in TBS); 2) anti-K8/18 monoclonal antibody (Research Diagnostics, Inc.; 1:500 in TBS); 3) anti-PKC (1:1000 in TBS); 4) anti-phosphoserine antibody (1:2000 TBS); and 5) 5B3-anti-pK8Ser-431 (1:500 in TBS). Membranes were washed three times with TBS containing 0.1% of Tween for 30 min and then incubated with secondary antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase (in dilutions recommended by the supplier) and visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). For immunoprecipitation studies, cells were solubilized in modified RIPA buffer. After pelleting (16,000 × g; 15 min), keratin was immunoprecipitated from the supernatant using an anti-K8 antibody coupled to protein A/G-Sepharose. The beads were washed once with RIPA buffer and twice with PBS (3 mm EDTA). Proteins were solubilized in 3× Laemmli sample buffer and then immunoblotted as described above with the relevant antibodies. PKC Translocation Assay—Following the exposure of AEC cells to shear stress, cells were scraped into a lysis buffer containing: 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 20 μm leupeptin, 100 nm microcystin and homogenized for 2 min. Lysates were then centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min to obtain P1: nuclear and supernatant fractions. The supernatant fraction was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min to obtain the P2: membrane fraction and the S: cytosol fraction. The P2 fraction was suspended in lysis buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 20 min and centrifuged (16,000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C) to separate the detergent-insoluble and -soluble material. Twenty to 50 μg of cytosolic and membrane fractions were then subjected to immunoblotting using isozyme-specific anti-PKC antibodies. Specificity of membrane fractionation was determined by histone H1, a nuclear protein that mainly localizes in the P1: nuclear fraction, and MEK-1, a marker of cytosol protein, present in the S: cytosol fraction but not in the P1 or P2 fractions (23Ridge K.M.

Sznajder J.I. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: L1099-L1107Google Scholar). Miscellaneous—ATP levels were measured by the luciferin/luciferase method using an ATP bioluminescence assay kit HS II (Roche Applied Science). Lactate dehydrogenase release was measured using a commercially available assay (cytotoxicity detection kit, Roche Pharmaceuticals). Protein kinase C activity was measured using a commercially available assay (SignaTECT, Promega, Madison, WI). Protein content was determined according to Bradford (34Prekeris R. Mayhew M.W. Cooper J.B. Terrian D.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 77-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) using a commercial dye reagent (Bio-Rad Laboratories) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot using a Western Lightning chemiluminescence reagent Plus kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Quantification of phosphorylation by PKC was carried out with a phosphorimaging device (Bio-Rad). Statistical Analysis—Comparisons were performed using the unpaired Student's t test. One-way analysis of variance with Tukey's test was used to analyze the data. p < 0.05 values were considered significant. Effect of Stretch and Shear Stress on the Assembly State of Keratin IF—No differences in cell viability (Fig. 1A) or ATP levels (Fig. 1B) were observed in AEC exposed to shear stress (30 dynes/cm2, 24 h) or in AEC exposed to cyclic stretch at strain conditions equivalent to 20% deformation for 24 h. AEC exposed to shear stress (30 dynes/cm2) for 0, 4, and 24 h exhibited a time-dependent decrease in the amount of pelletable (i.e. filamentous) K8 and K18, which coincided with significant increases in the soluble (disassembled) keratin protein detected in the supernatant (Fig. 2A and see “Experimental Procedures”). Keratin assembly depends on the degree of shear stress because in AEC exposed to 0, 7.5, 15, and 30 dynes/cm2 for 24 h, there was a shear stress-dependent decrease in insoluble K8 and K18 protein (Fig. 2B). In contrast, AEC exposed to cyclic stretch at strain conditions equivalent to 20% deformation for 24, 48, and 72 h did not have any detectable effects on the assembly state of keratin IF as monitored by changes in their overall solubility. In control and stretched cells, >95% of the keratin IF protein was found in the insoluble pellet fraction (filamentous), and only a small amount of keratin was detected in the supernatant (Fig. 2C).Fig. 2Effects of mechanical strain on keratin IF solubility. A, AEC were exposed to shear stress (30 dynes/cm2) for 4 and 24 h and compared with static control (CT) cells. Keratin-enriched cytoskeletal preparations were separated into Triton X-100 (TX-100) -soluble and -insoluble fractions. Equal amounts of protein were separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted with anti-K8 and -K18 antibodies. A representative immunoblot shows an increased solubility of both K8 and K18 upon exposure to shear stress (n = 4). B, AEC were exposed to 7.5, 15, or 30 dynes/cm2 for 24 h and compared with static control cells. Equal amounts of protein were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted with anti-K8 and -K18 antibodies. A representative immunoblot shows an increased solubility of both K8 and K18 upon exposure to 15 and 30 dynes/cm2 as compared with control (n = 4). S, soluble; IS, insoluble. C, AEC were exposed to cyclic stretch (20% strain; 30 cycles/min) for 24, 48, and 72 h and compared with static control cells. Equal amounts of protein were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted with anti-K8 and -K18 antibodies. A representative immunoblot shows no change in solubility of both K8 and K18 upon exposure of AEC to stretch (n = 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Activation of Protein Kinase C by Stretch and Shear Stress— Physical forces, such as cyclic stretch and shear stress, are known to activate protein kinases, such as protein kinase C (14Liu M.

As shown in Fig. 3, AEC that were exposed to shear stress, cyclic stretch, or the phorbol ester PMA (used as a positive control) showed increased PKC activity as compared with control AEC. It is known that AEC express several isozymes of PKC, including PKC α, βI, βII, δ, ϵ, θ, and ζ (23Ridge K.M. Dada L. Lecuona E. Bertorello A.M. Katz A.I. Mochly-Rosen D. Sznajder J.I. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1381-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). PKC isozymes become activated by translocating from the cytosol to new subcellular sites, including the plasma membrane (32Shoji M. Girard P.R. Mazzei G.J. Vogler W.R. Kuo J.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1986; 135: 1144-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), nucleus (33Soh J.W. Lee E.H. Prywes R. Weinstein I.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1313-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), and cytoskeletal elements (34Prekeris R. Mayhew M.W. Cooper J.B. Terrian D.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 77-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). To determine which PKC isozymes were activated, AEC were exposed to either shear stress or cyclic stretch and then subfractionated into cytosol, membrane, and cytoskeletal fractions. The classical PKCs, PKC α and β, were not activated in response to either shear stress or stretch at any time point (data not shown). The novel and atypical PKCs, PKC δ, PKC ϵ, and PKC ζ, were activated in shear-stressed AEC, but only PKC δ was translocated to the cytoskeletal fraction following 4, 12, and 24 h of shear stress (data not shown). Effects of Mechanical Stimuli on the Phosphorylation of K8 — The state of phosphorylation is known to regulate keratin IF assembly and their dynamic properties (10Ku N.O. Michie S.A. Soetikno R.M.

Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 23-33Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the effects of mechanical stimuli on keratin phosphorylation were determined. Changes in phosphorylation were assessed by immunoprecipitating K8 from AEC exposed to shear stress or cyclic stretch followed by immunoblotting with a phosphoserine antibody. As shown in Fig. 4, AEC exposed to shear stress resulted in a time-dependent increase in phosphorylation of Ser K8, as compared with control AEC (Fig. 4A). These changes in phosphorylation corresponded to the shear stress-mediated increase in keratin IF solubility (Fig. 1). Pretreatment with bisindolymaleimide, a PKC inhibitor, prevented the shear stress-mediated increase in K8 phosphorylation. Additionally, treatment with a PKC activator, PMA (1 μm, 15 min), increased K8 phosphorylation (Fig. 4A). In contrast, AEC exposed to cyclic stretch for 24 h exhibited increased levels of keratin phosphorylation, which was not affected by the pretreatment with bisindolymaleimide (Fig. 4A). To determine whether PKC mediated the shear stress-dependent increase in keratin IF solubility, AEC were treated with bisindolymaleimide, a general PKC inhibitor. As shown in Fig. 4B, bisindolymaleimide prevented the shear stress-induced increase in keratin IF solubility (i.e. disassembly). Protein Kinase C-mediated Phosphorylation of K8 on Ser-73 in Shear-stressed AEC—To determine which PKC isozymes mediate keratin IF disassembly, AEC were pretreated with the PKC peptide inhibitors (PKC δ V1-1 and PKC ϵ V1-2 peptide; gifts from Daria Mochly-Rosen) and then exposed to shear stress for 24 h. The PKC δ peptide antagonist attenuated the shear stress-mediated increase in keratin IF solubility as shown by Western blot analysis (Fig. 5A). There was no effect on the basal expression of keratin protein in cells treated with the PKC peptide inhibitors alone (data not shown). Pretreatment with the PKC ϵ peptide antagonist or scrambled peptide (used as a negative control) did not prevent the shear stress-mediated increase in keratin IF solubility (data not shown). Three major phosphorylation sites were identified in K8: Ser-23, Ser-73, and Ser-431. To determine whether these sites were phosphorylated in response to shear stress and activation of PKC δ, AEC were exposed to shear stress for 4 and 24 h. K8 immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with phospho-specific monoclonal antibodies against K8 pSer-431 and K8 pSer-73. As shown in Fig. 5B, shear stress induced the phosphorylation of K8 pSer-73 at 4 and 24 h but not of K"
https://openalex.org/W2125336665,"Bax is a cytosolic protein, which in response to stressing apoptotic stimuli, is activated and translocates to mitochondria, thus initiating the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. In spite of many studies and the importance of the issue, the molecular mechanisms that trigger Bax translocation are still obscure. We show by computer simulation that the two cysteine residues of Bax may form disulfide bridges, producing conformational changes that favor Bax translocation. Oxidative, nonapoptogenic treatments produce an up-shift of Bax migration compatible with homodimerization, which is reverted by reducing agents; this is accompanied by translocation to mitochondria. Dimers also appear in pure cytosolic fractions of cell lysates treated with H2O2, showing that Bax dimerization may take place in the cytosol. Bax dimer-enriched lysates support Bax translocation to isolated mitochondria much more efficiently than untreated lysates, indicating that dimerization may promote Bax translocation. The absence of apoptosis in our system allows the demonstration that Bax moves because of oxidations, even in the absence of apoptosis. This provides the first evidence that Bax dimerization and translocation respond to oxidative stimuli, suggesting a novel role for Bax as a sensor of redox imbalance."
https://openalex.org/W2156246185,"The ADAM10 gene encodes a membrane-bound disintegrin-metalloproteinase, which, after overexpression in an Alzheimer disease (AD) mouse model, prevents amyloid pathology and improves long-term potentiation and memory. Because enhancing ADAM10 expression appears to be a reasonable approach for treatment of AD, we functionally analyzed the ADAM10 gene. Both human and mouse ADAM10 genes comprise approximately 160 kbp, are composed of 16 exons, and are evolutionarily highly conserved within 500 bp upstream of either translation initiation site. By using luciferase reporter assays, we demonstrate that nucleotides -2179 to -1 upstream of the human ADAM10 translation initiation site represent a functional TATA-less promoter. Within this region we identified and examined several single nucleotide polymorphisms, but did not detect significant differences in their appearance between AD and nondemented control subjects. By deletion analysis, site-directed mutagenesis, transcription factor overexpression and electrophoretic mobility shift assays, we identified nucleotides -508 to -300 as the core promoter and found Sp1, USF, and retinoic acid-responsive elements to modulate its activity. Finally, we identified vitamin A acid (RA) as an inducer of human ADAM10 promoter activity. This finding suggests that pharmacologic targeting of RA receptors may increase the expression of the alpha-secretase ADAM10 with beneficial effects on AD pathology."
https://openalex.org/W1978637210,"Fever is the most common manifestation of the innate immune response to invading pathogens. Animals prevented from developing fever have increased morbidity and mortality to infection. We now show that early life events can program this innate immune response, in that rats that have been challenged neonatally with the immune stimulant lipopolysaccharide (LPS) have both suppressed febrile responses to LPS as adults and significantly reduced nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB activation in peripheral immune organs. This was associated with reduced levels of proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the plasma after adult LPS challenge, compared with animals that have received saline neonatally. In contrast, adult LPS challenge elicited higher corticosterone levels in the animals that had been treated neonatally with LPS. When this increased corticosterone response was negated by adrenalectomy or by administration of the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU-486, both the cytokine and febrile responses were normalized. This study indicates that the innate immune response can be programmed by a neonatal LPS challenge, whereby an amplified hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal response causes reduced cytokine synthesis and an attenuated febrile response to an adult immune challenge. In light of the importance of fever in the host defense response, these alterations may have deleterious consequences on an individual's ability to combat disease later in life."
https://openalex.org/W1998702348,"Type 2 diabetics have an increased risk of developing atherosclerosis, suggesting the mechanisms that cause this disease are enhanced by insulin resistance. In this study we examined the effects of gene knock-out (KO) of lipocalin-type prostaglandin D(2) synthase (L-PGDS), a protein found at elevated levels in type 2 diabetics, on diet-induced glucose tolerance and atherosclerosis. Our results show that L-PGDS KO mice become glucose-in-tolerant and insulin-resistant at an accelerated rate when compared with the C57BL/6 control strain. Adipocytes were significantly larger in the L-PGDS KO mice compared with controls on the same diets. Cell culture data revealed significant differences between insulin-stimulated mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-2, protein-tyrosine phosphatase-1D, and phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase expression levels in L-PGDS KO vascular smooth muscle cells and controls. In addition, only the L-PGDS KO mice developed nephropathy and an aortic thickening reminiscent to the early stages of atherosclerosis when fed a diabetogenic high fat diet. We conclude that L-PGDS plays an important role regulating insulin sensitivity and atherosclerosis in type 2 diabetes and may represent a novel model of insulin resistance, atherosclerosis, and diabetic nephropathy."
https://openalex.org/W2127637463,"The molecular events controlling glutamate receptor ion channel gating are complex. The movement of transmembrane domain M3 within N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunits has been suggested to be one structural determinant linking agonist binding to channel gating. Here we report that covalent modification of NR1-A652C or the analogous mutation in NR2A, -2B, -2C, or -2D by methanethiosulfonate ethylammonium (MT-SEA) occurs only in the presence of glutamate and glycine, and that modification potentiates recombinant NMDA receptor currents. The modified channels remain open even after removing glutamate and glycine from the external solution. The degree of potentiation depends on the identity of the NR2 subunit (NR2A < NR2B < NR2C,D) inversely correlating with previous measurements of channel open probability. MTSEA-induced modification of channels is associated with increased glutamate potency, increased mean single-channel open time, and slightly decreased channel conductance. Modified channels are insensitive to the competitive antagonists D-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (APV) and 7-Cl-kynurenic acid, as well as allosteric modulators of gating (extracellular protons and Zn(2+)). However, channels remain fully sensitive to Mg(2+) blockade and partially sensitive to pore block by (+)MK-801, (-)MK-801, ketamine, memantine, amantadine, and dextrorphan. The partial sensitivity to (+)MK-801 may reflect its ability to stimulate agonist unbinding from MT-SEA-modified receptors. In summary, these data suggest that the SYTANLAAF motif within M3 is a conserved and critical determinant of channel gating in all NMDA receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2027927035,"The structure of apoA-I on discoidal high density lipoprotein (HDL) was studied using a combination of chemical cross-linking and mass spectrometry. Recombinant HDL particles containing 145 molecules of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and two molecules of apoA-I with a 96-A diameter were treated with the lysine-specific cross-linker, dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate) at varying molar ratios from 2:1 to 200:1. At low molar ratios of dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate) to apoA-I, two products were obtained corresponding to ∼53 and ∼80 kDa. At high molar ratios, these two products merged, yielding a product of ∼59 kDa, close to the theoretical molecular mass of dimeric apoA-I. To identify the intermolecular cross-links giving rise to the two different sized products, bands were excised from the gel, digested with trypsin, and then analyzed by liquid chromatography-electrospray-tandem mass spectrometry. In addition, tandem mass spectrometry of unique cross-links found in the 53- and 80-kDa products suggested that a distinct conformation exists for lipid-bound apoA-I on 96-A recombinant HDL, emphasizing the inherent flexibility and malleability of the N termini and its interaction with its C-terminal domain."
https://openalex.org/W2008659646,"Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) can increase thelial vascular endogrowth factor A (VEGF-A) production but the mechanisms involved are unclear. Here we characterized the transcriptional mechanisms involved in human airway smooth muscle cells (HASMC). PGE2 increased VEGF-A mRNA and protein but not mRNA stability. PGE2 stimulated the activity of a transiently transfected 2068-bp (–2018 to +50) VEGF-A promoter-driven luciferase construct. Functional 5′ deletional analysis mapped the PGE2 response element to the 135-bp sequence (–85/ +50) of the human VEGF-A promoter. PGE2-induced luciferase activity was reduced in cells transfected with a 135-bp VEGF promoter fragment containing mutated Sp-1 binding sites but not in cells transfected with a construct containing mutated EGR-1 binding sites. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay confirmed binding of Sp-1 to the VEGF promoter. PGE2 increased phosphorylation of Sp-1 and luciferase activity of a transfected Sp-1 reporter construct. PGE receptor agonists EP2 (ONO-AE1 259) and EP4 (ONO-AE1 329) mimicked the effect of PGE2, and reverse transcription-PCR, Western blotting, and flow cytometry confirmed the presence of EP2 and EP4 receptors. VEGF protein release and Sp-1 reporter activity were increased by forskolin and isoproterenol, which increase cytosolic cAMP, and the cAMP analogue, 8-bromoadenosine-3′,5′-cyclophosphoric acid.

Henzel W.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 161: 851-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (2001) Google Scholar). VEGF plays a critical role in physiological and pathological angiogenesis in most biological systems (2Ferrara N. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 2000; 55: 15-35PubMed Google Scholar). VEGF is implicated in tumor neovascularization and in angiogenesis associated with a number of chronic inflammatory diseases, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid and osteoarthritis (3Kanazawa H.

VEGF is secreted by a variety of cell types, but not by endothelial cells themselves and mesenchymal cells serve as an important source of VEGF in a number of inflammatory and neoplastic processes (8Berse B. Brown L.F. van de Water L. Dvorak H.F. Senger D.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 211-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). There are at least five members of the VEGF family including placental growth factor, VEGF-A, VEGF-B, VEGF-C, and VEGF-D (9Achen M.G. Stacker S.A. Int. J. Exp. Pathol. 1998; 79: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The most potent angiogenic factor in vivo is VEGF-A, which has six splice variants: 121, 145, 165, 183, 189, and 204 amino acids (10Keyt B.A. Berleau L.T. Nguyen H.V. Chen H. Heinsohn H. Vandlen R.

A number of stimuli are capable of increasing VEGF release in different biological systems. Inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1β and transforming growth factor-β increased VEGF release in human cholangiocellular carcinoma cells, synovial fibroblasts, cardiac myocytes, and airway smooth muscle cells (11Benckert C. Jonas S. Cramer T. Von Marschall Z. Schafer G. Peters M. Wagner K. Radke C. Wiedenmann B. Neuhaus P. Hocker M. Rosewicz S. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 1083-1092PubMed Google Scholar, 12Inoue H. Takamori M.

We have previously shown that the pro-inflammatory asthma mediator, bradykinin, increased VEGF production in human airway smooth muscle cells (HASMC) (15Knox A.J. Corbett L. Stocks J. Holland E. Zhu Y.M. Pang L. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2480-2488Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). A number of studies have shown that the products of COX-2, the inducible form of cyclooxygenase, may mediate the effect of cytokines and mediators on the release of chemokines and cytokines in an autocrine manner through a mechanism involving endogenous prostanoid production. Recent work suggests that this is also true of VEGF. Autocrine PGE2 increases VEGF release in response to interleukin-1β in synovial fibroblasts and in response to bradykinin in HASMC (12Inoue H. Takamori M. Shimoyama Y. Ishibashi H. Yamamoto S. Koshihara Y. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 136: 287-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 15Knox A.J. Corbett L. Stocks J. Holland E. Zhu Y.M. Pang L. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2480-2488Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Furthermore, exogenous PGE2 increases VEGF expression in fibroblasts and osteoblasts (16Harada S. Nagy J.A.

These studies are consistent with the known role of COX products in angiogenesis (19Gately S. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2000; 19: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 20Gately S. Li W.W. Semin. Oncol. 2004; 31: 2-11Crossref PubMed Google Scholar): COX-2-derived thromboxane A2, prostacyclin, and PGE2 stimulate endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis (21Daniel T.O. Liu H. Morrow J.D. Crews B.C. Marnett L.J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4574-4577PubMed Google Scholar), whereas COX inhibitors have protective effects on angiogenesis in experimental models (22Jones M.K. Wang H.

Anticancer Res. 1986; 6: 251-253PubMed Google Scholar). In asthma both COX-2 and VEGF are increased but the two have not been firmly linked (24Pang L. Pitt A. Petkova D. Knox A.J. Clin. Exp. Allergy. 1998; 28: 1050-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 25Hoshino M. Takahashi M. Aoike N. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2001; 107: 295-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Collectively these studies suggest that PGE2 can contribute to angiogenesis via increased VEGF production but the molecular mechanisms involved have not been studied in detail, particularly the balance between transcriptional and post-transcriptional events. The VEGF promoter contains the hypoxia response element, hypoxia inducible factor-1α, p53/Von Hippel Lindau, NFκB, and AP-1 as well as several potential transcription factor binding sites for Sp-1 and AP-2 (26Tischer E. Mitchell R. Hartman T. Silva M. Gospodarowicz D. Fiddes J.C. Abraham J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11947-11954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PGE2 binds to G protein-coupled membrane receptors, the E prostanoid (EP) receptors. Four subtypes of EP receptors have been described, EP1, EP2, EP3, and EP4, encoded by different genes (27Coleman R.A. Smith W.L. Narumiya S. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 205-229PubMed Google Scholar). Each subtype is tissue-specific and uses different intracellular signaling mechanisms suggesting potentially different inflammatory responses depending on receptor subtype binding (28Narumiya S. Sugimoto Y. Ushikubi F. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1193-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The receptor used by PGE2 to increase VEGF is unknown. Here we determined the molecular mechanisms involved in the transcriptional regulation of the VEGF promoter by exogenous PGE2 in human airway smooth muscle cells. Mutational and deletional analysis of the VEGF promoter showed that Sp-1 transcription factor binding was essential for the increase in VEGF promoter activity produced by PGE2. PGE2 caused phosphorylation of Sp-1 and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) demonstrated that PGE2 increased Sp-1 binding to the VEGF promoter. Furthermore, studies with EP2 and EP4 receptor subtype agonists, the cAMP analogue 8-bromoadenosine-3′,5′-cyclophosphoric acid (8-Br-cAMP), forskolin, which increases adenylyl cyclase activity, and the β2 receptor agonist isoproterenol, showed that PGE2-induced activation of Sp-1 was mediated by EP2 and EP4 receptors via cAMP. Cell Culture—Human tracheas were obtained from three post-mortem individuals. Primary cultures of human ASM cells were prepared from explants of ASM according to methods previously reported (29Pang L. Knox A.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: L1132-L1140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Pang L. Knox A.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 121: 579-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Cells at passage 6 were used for all experiments. We have previously shown that cells grown in this manner depict the immunohistochemical and light microscopic characteristics of typical ASM cells (30Pang L. Knox A.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 121: 579-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Experimental Protocol—The cells were cultured to confluence in 24-well culture plates in a humidified, 5% CO2, 37 °C incubator using Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Seralab, Crawly Down, Sussex, UK), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 4 mm l-glutamine, and 2.5 μg/ml amphotericin B (Sigma). The cells were growth-arrested in serum-free medium for 24 h prior to experiments. Immediately before each experiment, fresh serum-free medium containing PGE2 or ethanol vehicle (Sigma) was added. In time course experiments cells were incubated with 1 μm PGE2 for 2–24 h. In the concentration response experiments cells were incubated for 24 h with 1 nm to 10 μm PGE2. In subsequent experiments, 24-h incubation times were used. At the indicated times, the culture media were harvested and stored at –20 °C. The highly selective EP2 and EP4 receptor subtype agonists ONO-AE1 259 and ONO-AE1 329, which were a gift from ONO Pharmaceuticals, Osaka, Japan, were used in the PGE2 receptor studies (31Maruyama T.

The cAMP analogue 8-Br-cAMP, the PKA inhibitor H-89, and forskolin and isoproterenol, which increase cytosolic cAMP, were purchased from Sigma. Mithramycin was purchased from Tocris Cookson Ltd. (Avonmouth, Bristol, UK). The cells were preincubated for 1 h with the inhibitors. VEGF-A Assay—The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to measure VEGF-A (R&D Systems, Abingdon, Oxon, UK) according to the manufacturer's instructions and has been described by us in detail elsewhere (15Knox A.J. Corbett L. Stocks J. Holland E. Zhu Y.M. Pang L. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2480-2488Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). RNA Isolation and Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)—Cells in 6-well plates were treated with PGE2 and collected at time 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 24 h, respectively. Total RNA was isolated by using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, West Sussex, UK) following the manufacturer's protocol with on-column DNase digestion. 1 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed in a total volume of 20 μl including 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI), 25 units of RNase inhibitor (Promega), 0.5 μg of oligo(dT)15 primer, 0.5 mm of each dNTPs, and 1× first-strand buffer provided by Promega. The reaction was incubated at 42 °C for 90 min. Aliquots of the RT products were subsequently used for PCR amplification. 10 μl of RT products was brought to a volume of 50 μl containing 1 mm MgCl2, 0.12 mm of each dTNPs, 1 unit of Taq polymerase (Promega), 0.5 μm of both the upstream and downstream PCR primers, and 1× PCR buffer, provided by Promega. Amplification was carried out with a PTC-100 programmable thermal controller (MJ Research Inc., Watertown, MA) after an initial denaturation at 94 °C for 3 min. This was followed by 35 cycles of PCR using the following temperature and time profile: denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, primer annealing at 56 °C for 1 min, primer extension at 72 °C for 1 min, and a final extension of 72 °C for 10 min. The following primers were used: EP2-R sense 5′-TCCAATGACTCCCAGTCTGAGGA-3′, antisense 5′-TCAAAGGTCAGCCTGTTTAC-3′; EP4-R sense 5′-TCTGACCTCGGTGTCCAAAAATCG-3′, antisense 5′-TGGGTACTGCAGCCGCGAGCTA-3′ (33Clarke D.L.

The PCR products were visualized by electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel in 0.5× TBE buffer after staining with 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide. The ultraviolet (UV)-illuminated gels were photographed, and the densitometry was analyzed using a GeneGenius gel documentation and analysis system (Syngene, Cambridge, UK). Quantitative Real-time RT-PCR—VEGF-A expression was determined using primer sequences: sense 5′-CTTGCCTTGCTGCTCTACC-3′ and antisense 5′-CACACAGGATGGCTTGAAG-3′ (34Schafer G. Cramer T. Suske G. Kemmner W. Wiedenmann B. Hocker M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8190-8198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). β2-Microglobulin was used as the housekeeping gene (35Pallisgaard N. Clausen N. Schroder H. Hokland P. Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1999; 26: 355-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). 1 ng of reverse-transcribed cDNA was subjected to real-time PCR using Excite Real-time Mastermix with SYBR green (Biogene, Cambridge, UK) and the ABI Prism 7700 detection system (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, Cheshire, UK). Each reaction consisted of 1× Excite mastermix, SYBR green (1:60000 final concentration), 40 nm of both sense and antisense primers, 1.6 μl of DNA (or dH2O), and H2O to a final volume of 20 μl. Thermal cycler conditions included incubation at 95 °C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. Integration of the fluorescent SYBR green into the PCR product was monitored after each annealing step. Amplification of one specific product was confirmed by melting curve analysis, where a single melting peak eliminated the possibility of primer-dimer association. For melting curve analysis to be performed the products were heated from 60 to 95 °C over 20 min after the 40 cycles. To enable the levels of transcripts to be quantified, standard curves were generated using serial dilutions of KG1a cDNA. Negative controls consisting of no template were included, and all reactions were set up in triplicate. VEGF-A expression was normalized to the housekeeping gene by dividing the mean of the VEGF-A triplicate value by the mean of the β2-microglobulin triplicate value. This was then expressed as -fold increase over unstimulated cells at each time point. Flow Cytometric Analysis of EP4 Receptors—HASMC were detached using a sterile scraper, washed, and incubated with polyclonal rabbit anti-human EP4-R (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI). The cells were washed twice and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Sigma). Preimmune rabbit serum was used as the negative control (Sigma). Using the FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and logarithmic amplification of the green fluorescence channel (FL-1), 10,000 events were acquired and analyzed with CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). Western Blotting—The nuclear protein fractions were prepared using Nu-Clear extraction kit (Sigma) following the manufacturer's protocol. Western blotting was performed as described previously using a specific polyclonal rabbit anti-human EP2 receptor antibody (Cayman Chemical) or mouse monoclonal anti-human Sp1 antibody (1C6; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (DakoCytomation, Ely, Cambridgeshire, UK) (33Clarke D.L. Belvisi M.G. Smith S.J. Hardaker E. Yacoub M.H. Meja K.K. Newton R. Slater D.M. Giembycz M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: L238-L250Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The human histiocytic lymphoma cell line U937, which is known to express EP2 receptors, was used as the positive control. The human T lymphoblastic leukemia cell line Jurkat was used as a positive Sp-1 control. Cell Viability—The toxicity of all the chemicals and vehicles used in this study was determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltertrazolium bromide assay (29Pang L. Knox A.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: L1132-L1140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At the end of the experiment the culture media was removed and replaced with 250 μl of media containing 1 mg/ml thiazolyl blue, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltertrazolium bromide (Sigma) and incubated for 20 min in 37 °C. This medium was removed and 250 μl of Me2SO was added to solubilize the blue-colored tetrazolium. The optical density was read at 550 nm in a TECAN GENios (Tecan UK Limited, Theale, Reading, UK) microplate reader. Viability was set as 100% in control cells. Transfection with VEGF Promoter-driven Luciferase Constructs and Sp-1 Reporter Luciferase Construct—Cells were cultured in 24-well plates to confluence, growth arrested for 24 h, and transfected using 1 μl of LF2000 (Lipofectamine LF2000, Invitrogen) and 0.8 μg of DNA per well according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were cotransfected with 1 ng/well of the internal control plasmid pRL-SV40 (Promega UK, Southampton, UK) containing the Renilla luciferase gene. After 24 h incubation with or without 1 μm PGE2, the cells were harvested and the firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were measured using the Dual Luciferase Assay System Kit (Promega) and Microlumat Plus LB 96V luminometer (Berthold Technologies GmbH & Co. KG, Bad Wildbag, Germany). The VEGF promoter-driven luciferase constructs were a kind gift from Professor Dieter Marmé, Institute of Molecular Oncology, Tumor Biology Center, Freiburg, Germany (36Finkenzeller G. Technau A.

The Sp-1 reporter construct containing 6 Sp-1 binding sites was a kind gift from Professor Jeffrey E. Kudlow, School of Medicine, The University of Alabama at Birmingham (37Biggs J.R. Kudlow J.E. Kraft A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 901-906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). EMSA—The nuclear protein fractions for EMSA were prepared using the Nu-Clear extraction kit (Sigma) following the manufacturer's protocol. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay. Consensus Sp-1, AP-2, and EGR-1 oligonucleotides were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. VEGF promoter-specific oligonucleotides that recognized the –85/–50 binding region: sense 5′-CCCGGGGCGGGCCGGGGGCGGGGTCCCGGCGGGGCGGAG-3′ and antisense 5′-CTCCGCCCCGCCGGGACCCCGCCCCCGGCCCGCCCCGGG-3′ were purchased from Sigma. All oligonucleotides were labeled using [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega). Fifteen micrograms of nuclear protein, 32P-labeled double-stranded probe (40,000 counts per min/ng), and 2 μl of 5× binding buffer (20% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 250 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.25 mg/ml poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC)) were mixed in a total volume of 10 μl. In competition assays, 50× unlabeled competitors were added at the same time of probe addition. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 min, then loaded on a 5% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE buffer, and subjected to electrophoresis for 60 min. The gel was dried and exposed for autoradiography on Kodak XAR film at –70 °C for 19–48 h. Supershift were performed using 4 μg of specific goat polyclonal anti-human Sp-1 (PEP 2), AP-2 (C-18), or EGR-1 (588) antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). ChIP Assay—HASM cells were cultured to confluence in 75-cm2 flasks, growth arrested, and incubated with ethanol vehicle or 1 μm PGE2 for 30 min. The ChIP assay was performed using the ChIP-IT kit (Active Motif, Rixensart, Belgium) following the manufacturer's protocol and using 4 μg of goat anti-human polyclonal Sp-1 antibody (PEP 2) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for each immunoprecipitation. The VEGF primers used yielded a 202-bp product corresponding to –199 to +3 of the VEGF gene promoter and were: forward 5′-GGTCGAGCTTCCCCTTCA-3′, and reverse 5′-GATCCTCCCCGCTACCAG-3′. Forty cycles of a two-step PCR program, 95 °C for 1 min and 60 °C for 1 min, in the presence of 6% Me2SO and 1 m betaine using Red Taq and 2.5 mm magnesium chloride (Sigma, Poole, Dorset, UK) were used (38Stoner M. Wormke M. Saville B. Samudio I. Qin C. Abdelrahim M. Safe S. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 1052-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Potential problems with PCR resulting from high melting temperatures were reduced by addition of Me2SO (39Chakrabarti R. Schutt C.E. BioTechniques. 2002; 32 (868, 870–872, 874): 866Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and the amplification of GC-rich templates was enhanced by betaine (40Henke W. Herdel K. Jung K. Schnorr D. Loening S.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3957-3958Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). The PCR products were visualized by electrophoresis on 2% agarose gel in 0.5× TBE buffer after staining with 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide. The ultraviolet-illuminated gels were photographed, and densitometry was performed using the GeneGenius gel documentation and analysis system (Syngene, Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, UK). Statistical Analysis—VEGF ELISA and luciferase levels were expressed as the mean of triplicate or quadruplicate wells for that experiment. The experiments were repeated at least three times and the results shown represent the mean ± S.E. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to determine significant differences. A p value of <0.05 (2-tailed) was regarded as statistically significant. PGE2 Increases VEGF-A165 Protein Production—There was a significant increase in VEGF release above control in cells cultured for 24 h with concentrations of PGE2 ranging from 1 nm to 1 μm (Fig. 1A). Cells treated with 1 μm PGE2 for 2, 4, 8, 16, and 24 h also showed significantly increased VEGF levels compared with unstimulated control cells (Fig. 1B). PGE2 Increased VEGF Is Transcriptional—Real-time RT-PCR showed that PGE2 increased VEGF-A mRNA levels with time with a 6-fold increase at 60 min and a peak 12-fold increase by 4 h compared with controls at these times (Fig. 2A). To confirm that this was because of VEGF-A gene transcription rather than stabilization of mRNA, the cells were cultured for 30 min with 5 μg/ml actinomycin D, an inhibitor of RNA polymerase II, followed by 1 μm PGE2. Pretreatment with actinomycin D prevented the PGE2-induced increase in VEGF mRNA (Fig. 2A). The cells were transfected with a 2068-bp VEGF promoter fragment (–2018 to +50) ligated to firefly luciferase. There was a 5.6 ± 0.48-fold increase in luciferase activity in cells treated with 1 μm PGE2 compared with unstimulated cells (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that induction of VEGF by PGE2 is transcriptional and not mediated by post-transcriptional stabilization of PGE2 mRNA. Mutations in the Sp-1 Binding Sites in the VEGF Promoter Reduce PGE2-stimulated Luciferase Activity—To determine which transcription factors are involved, the cells were transfected with 2068 bp of the wild type VEGF promoter and a series of deletion constructs ligated to a firefly luciferase reporter plasmid. A diagram representing the VEGF promoter showing the key transcription factor binding sites and the positions where the restriction enzymes cleave the promoter to generate the series of deletions is shown in Fig. 3A. One micromolar PGE2 increased the luciferase levels 4.2 ± 0.65 in cells transfected with the 2068 construct. There was a significant PGE2-mediated increase in luciferase activity with all of the deletions series except the smallest 102-bp fragment of the VEGF promoter (Fig. 3B). However, deleting the sequences between –1286 and –789 bp resulted in a reduction in the stimulatory effect of the PGE2. This suggests that the upstream AP-1, AP-2, or hypoxia-inducible factor-1α sequences may also be involved in PGE2-mediated VEGF increase. Transfection studies using the wild type construct and a construct containing mutations of the three Sp-1 (–88/–50) binding sites showed a significant reduction in luciferase activity (Fig. 4, A and B), suggesting that these factors were necessary for VEGF induction by PGE2. PGE2 Increases Sp-1 Binding to the VEGF Promoter—We used EMSA to determine whether PGE2 treatment increased Sp-1 binding to the VEGF promoter. Incubation with 1 μm PGE2 for 60 min induced binding activity with Sp-1 consensus and VEGF promoter oligonucleotides (Fig. 5, A and E). This was not seen with AP-1 and EGR-1 consensus oligonucleotides (Fig. 5, B and C). Supershift studies using a monoclonal antibody to Sp-1 produced gel retardation with the consensus sequence (Fig. 5A) and a reduction in binding with the VEGF promoter-specific primers (Fig. 5F). Competition with 50-fold excess unlabeled VEGF promoter oligonucleotides blocked transcription factor binding, whereas excess irrelevant AP-1 oligonucleotides did not block Sp-1 transcription factor binding, demonstrating that the binding was specific (Fig. 5E). There was no transcription factor binding in experiments using mutated consensus Sp-1 oligonucleotides (Fig. 5D). ChIP—The PGE2-mediated increase in Sp-1 binding to the VEGF promoter demonstrated by EMSA was confirmed using the ChIP ass"

We describe key findings for the roles of essential transcription factor SL1 and activator upstream binding factor (UBF). We demonstrate that human SL1 can direct accurate Pol I transcription in the absence of UBF and can interact with the rDNA promoter independently and stably, consistent with studies of rodent SL1 but contrary to previous reports of human SL1. UBF itself does not bind stably to rDNA but rapidly associates and dissociates. We show that SL1 significantly reduces the rate of dissociation of UBF from the rDNA promoter. Our findings challenge the idea that UBF activates transcription through recruitment of SL1 at the rDNA promoter and suggest that the rate of pre-initiation complex (PIC) formation is primarily determined by the rate of association of SL1, rather than UBF, with the promoter. Therefore, we propose that SL1 directs PIC formation, functioning in core promoter binding, RNA polymerase I recruitment, and UBF stabilization and that SL1-promoter complex formation is a necessary prerequisite to the assembly of functional and stable PICs that include the UBF activator in mammalian cells.

Basal transcription factors and (co-)activators of transcription cooperate in this function in eukaryotes where three classes of highly related enzymes, Pol I, Pol II, and Pol III, catalyze the transcription of specific sets of genes. With few exceptions, a complex of TBP and TBP-associated factor (TAF) proteins is required for the accurate initiation of transcription by all three polymerases (1Hernandez N. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1291-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). The particular complement of TAFs in each complex, although variable in Pol II transcription, is specific to each class of genes. There is evidence that binding of certain TAF subunits to TBP precludes the binding of TAFs from a different class (2Comai L. Zomerdijk J.C. Beckmann H. Zhou S. Admon A. Tjian R. Science. 1994; 266: 1966-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The precise roles of the TBP-TAF complexes in mediating a specific interaction between the polymerases and their respective promoters are distinct. In mammalian Pol II transcription, the TBP-TAF complex TFIID can bind at the promoter by virtue of the specific interaction of TBP with TATA boxes and the specific interactions of the TAF proteins with other promoter sequences, whereupon Pol II and other factors are recruited to form the pre-initiation complex (PIC) (3Verrijzer C.P. Tjian R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 338-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). The initial phases of mammalian Pol III transcription from the different types of Pol III promoters converge on the recruitment of the TBP-TAF complex TFIIIB and the Pol III enzyme in formation of the PIC (4Geiduschek E.P. Kassavetis G.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 5Schramm L. Hernandez N. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2593-2620Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Loading of promoter type-specific TFIIIB at the promoter DNA occurs with the assistance of the specific DNA binding capabilities of TFIIIA and TFIIIC or TFIIIC alone or the multisubunit complex PBP/PTF/SNAPC, depending on the Pol III promoter type. In mammalian Pol I transcription (reviewed in Ref. 6Russell J. Zomerdijk J.C.B.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 87-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) the TBP-TAF complex selectivity factor SL1 (murine TIF-IB), which is composed of TBP and at least three TAFIs, is essential for Pol I transcription (2Comai L.

Springer Verlag, New York1998: 67-73Google Scholar). The species promoter selectivity of SL1, in which SL1 from humans and mice are not interchangeable between these systems, in contrast to Pol I and the activator UBF, suggests a specific interaction between SL1 and its cognate rDNA core promoter (reviewed in Ref. 10Heix J. Grummt I. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 652-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Indeed, TIF-IB (mouse SL1) and rat SL1 can bind their cognate rDNA promoters independently of UBF (11Schnapp A. Grummt I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24588-24595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Smith S.D. O'Mahony D.J. Kinsella B.T. Rothblum L.I. Gene Expr. 1993; 3: 229-236PubMed Google Scholar). However, this had not been demonstrated for the human system (13Learned R.M. Learned T.K. Haltiner M.M. Tjian R.T. Cell. 1986; 45: 847-857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 14Bell S.P. Learned R.M. Jantzen H.M. Tjian R.

SL1 interacts with the hRRN3 protein (murine TIF-IA), a component of initiation-competent Pol Iβ, and this interaction is essential for the recruitment of Pol I by SL1 to the rDNA promoter (16Miller G. Panov K.I. Friedrich J.K. Trinkle-Mulcahy L. Lamond A.I. Zomerdijk J.C.B.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1373-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). There is a cooperative interaction between SL1 and UBF at the human rDNA promoter, which can occur prior to the recruitment of Pol I (14Bell S.P. Learned R.M. Jantzen H.M. Tjian R. Science. 1988; 241: 1192-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 15Jantzen H.M. Chow A.M. King D.S. Tjian R.

UBF binds as a dimer to the rDNA promoter at the upstream control element (UCE) and core element via interaction of its high mobility group (HMG) boxes 1–3 with the DNA minor groove. UBF binding induces bending of the DNA, a single dimer organizing ∼140 bp in a loop of 360°, comprising an enhancesome, and the formation of tandem enhancesomes is proposed to juxtapose the UCE and core (18Bazett Jones D.P. Leblanc B. Herfort M. Moss T. Science. 1994; 264: 1134-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 19Stefanovsky V.Y. Pelletier G. Bazett-Jones D.P. Crane-Robinson C. Moss T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3241-3247Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that UBF directs PIC formation, binding at both the UCE and the core regions of the promoter and facilitating the recruitment and binding of SL1, which interacts with the bound UBF at both sites, with the recruitment of Pol I culminating in initiation of transcription (reviewed in Refs. 20Grummt I. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1691-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 21Moss T. Stefanovsky V.Y. Cell. 2002; 109: 545-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). This model holds that UBF stabilizes the interaction of SL1 with the rDNA promoter (13Learned R.M. Learned T.K. Haltiner M.M. Tjian R.T. Cell. 1986; 45: 847-857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 14Bell S.P. Learned R.M. Jantzen H.M. Tjian R. Science. 1988; 241: 1192-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) and was largely born from the finding that human SL1 alone does not produce a DNase I footprint on the rDNA promoter whereas UBF does produce a footprint, which is both extended and altered in the presence of SL1 (13Learned R.M. Learned T.K. Haltiner M.M. Tjian R.T. Cell. 1986; 45: 847-857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 14Bell S.P. Learned R.M. Jantzen H.M. Tjian R.

However, a specific role for UBF in nucleating PIC formation at the promoter is inconsistent with the finding that UBF binds rather indiscriminately (23Hu C.H. McStay B. Jeong S.W. Reeder R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2871-2882Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 24Copenhaver G.P. Putnam C.D. Denton M.L. Pikaard C.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2651-2657Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and extensively across the rDNA in vivo (25O'Sullivan A.C. Sullivan G.J. McStay B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 657-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Here we have shown that human SL1 can bind the human rDNA promoter independently and direct the initiation of transcription specifically from the rDNA promoter in the absence of UBF. UBF interacts dynamically with the rDNA, and we have demonstrated that SL1 stabilizes UBF binding at the rDNA promoter. Our data, together with data from rodent systems (11Schnapp A. Grummt I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24588-24595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Smith S.D. O'Mahony D.J. Kinsella B.T. Rothblum L.I. Gene Expr. 1993; 3: 229-236PubMed Google Scholar, 26Smith S.D.

Biol. 1990; 10: 3105-3116Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), imply that SL1 drives or nucleates PIC formation at the rDNA promoter, challenging the model that UBF executes this role. SL1, Pol I, and UBF Purification—Human SL1 was purified as outlined in supplemental Fig. 1. Nuclear extracts from HeLa cells were prepared essentially as described (27Dignam J.D. Martin P.L. Shastry B.S. Roeder R.G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 582-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar), except that NaCl was substituted for KCl. The resulting extract was precipitated by 60% saturation with ammonium sulfate and then centrifuged at 35,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The pellet was then resuspended in TM20 buffer (50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.9, 0.05 m KCl, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 0.015% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm sodium metabisulfite, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin) and dialyzed against TM10/0.1 (TM buffer with 10% glycerol and 0.1 m KCl). Soluble protein from the nuclear extract at ∼40 mg/ml was then applied to a Heparin-Sepharose fast flow column (column volume (CV) of 60 ml; Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in TM10/0.1 and eluted in three steps at 0.2, 0.4 and 0.7 m KCl, as described previously (7Comai L. Tanese N. Tjian R. Cell. 1992; 68: 965-976Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). A 200-ml G25 Sephadex column was washed with 1.2 CVs of TM10/0.2, and the 0.7 m Heparin-Sepharose fraction was loaded at 5 ml/min. The protein peak was eluted at a flow rate of 5 ml/min and a single fraction collected as judged by absorbance (A280) reading exceeding 100 milliabsorbance units. The desalted SL1 fraction was then loaded onto a Mono S HR 5/5 column (CV 0.98 ml; Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in TM10/0.2. A linear salt gradient of 0.2–1 m KCl was then applied over 25 CVs, and 1-ml fractions were collected. Fractions were assayed for SL1 activity by in vitro transcription with Pol I and UBF. The SL1 activity eluted at 0.27–0.46 m KCl and was pooled and diluted to 0.2 m KCl with TM10/0. A POROS Heparin 20 column (CV 1.66 ml; Perspective) was equilibrated in TM10/0., and the pooled Mono S fractions were loaded. SL1 was eluted with a linear salt gradient of 0.2–1.0 m KCl over 30 CVs. 1-ml fractions were collected, and fractions were assayed for SL1 activity. SL1 peak fractions were reapplied to the POROS Heparin 20 columns in a second round of purification, but this time SL1 was eluted in a single step at 1.0 m KCl, resulting in ∼6-fold concentration. The SL1 sample was further concentrated by a NanoSep 10-kDa molecular mass cutoff concentrator (Flowgen, UK) to a 200-μl volume. A Superose 6 HR 10/30 column (CV 23.6 ml; Amersham Biosciences) was equilibrated with TM10/0.35 at 0.1 ml/min, and these conditions were maintained following loading of the SL1 sample. The column was developed with 1.2 CV of TM10/0.35. Fractions of 0.6 ml were collected and assayed for SL1 activity. Pol I (free of UBF) was purified as described (16Miller G. Panov K.I. Friedrich J.K. Trinkle-Mulcahy L. Lamond A.I. Zomerdijk J.C.B.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1373-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Human UBF1 was extensively purified from Sf9 cells (4 × 108) infected with recombinant UBF baculoviruses at a multiplicity of infection of 10. 2K. I. Panov, J. K. Friedrich, J. Russell, and J. C. B. M. Zomerdijk, submitted for publication. Cells were harvested 40 h post-infection and lysed by sonication in 50 ml of TM10/0.4 buffer (50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.9, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm sodium metabisulfite, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.4 m KCl). The lysate was cleared at 70,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and ammonium sulfate was added to 60% over 1 h. Precipitated proteins were collected at 70,000 × g for 40 min at 4 °C, and the pellet was resuspended in 1 m (NH4)2SO4 in buffer A (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 0.1 m KCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium metabisulfite, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin) and stirred for 2 h on ice. Solution was cleared at 70,000 × g for 40 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was loaded on a Phenyl-Sepharose HP column (XK26/20, 66 ml; Amersham Biosciences). The column was washed with 3 column volumes of 1 m (NH4)2SO4 in buffer A, and step-eluted with 1 volume of buffer A. The fraction was desalted on Sephadex G25 (Amersham Biosciences) in TM10/0.05, loaded on a DEAE-Sepharose FF column (XK26/20, 60 ml; Amersham Biosciences); this column was then developed with a linear gradient of 0.05–0.40 m KCl in TM10 over 20 column volumes. UBF peak fractions were pooled, and an equal volume of 2 m (NH4)2SO4 in buffer A was added and subsequently applied to a Phenyl-Sepharose HP column (7.5 ml; Amersham Biosciences), which was step-eluted with 1.5 column volume of buffer A. Following desalting on Sephadex G25 in TM10/0.2, the sample was loaded on a POROS Heparin 20 column (4.6 × 15 mm; Perceptive), which was then developed with a linear gradient of 0.2–1.0 m KCl in TM10 over 30 column volumes. UBF1 eluted as a single peak at 0.5 m KCl. The final purification step involved a POROS HQ10 column (4.6 × 15 mm; Perceptive), which was developed with a linear gradient of 0.2–1.0 m KCl in TM10 over 40 column volumes. UBF eluted as a single peak at 0.68 m KCl, and this fraction was concentrated on a 10-kDa cutoff concentrator (Filtron). SDS-PAGE and silver staining revealed a single protein species of 97 kDa in the UBF peak fraction that was active in transcription (data not shown).

The pseudo-WT rDNA template (in Fig. 4) contains the prHu3 promoter sequence but diverges from it at +10 relative to the transcription start site into sequences unrelated to rDNA (29Smale S.T.

The nonspecific DNA fragment of 423 bp (unrelated to rDNA) was generated by PCR with a biotinylated primer and was a kind gift from Chris Stockdale. Protein binding studies with the immobilized promoter templates were performed as described (30Panov K.I. Friedrich J.K. Zomerdijk J.C. Mol. Cell.

Reconstituted Transcription—Protein factors used were as follows: recombinant human UBF, highly purified Pol I (16Miller G. Panov K.I. Friedrich J.K. Trinkle-Mulcahy L. Lamond A.I. Zomerdijk J.C.B.M.

In vitro transcription reactions were performed as previously described (30Panov K.I. Friedrich J.K. Zomerdijk J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2641-2649Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Supercoiled plasmid DNA or immobilized linear DNA fragments were used as templates in transcription reactions. The transcripts were analyzed by S1 nuclease protection as described (30Panov K.I. Friedrich J.K. Zomerdijk J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2641-2649Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), with 0.1 pmol 5′-end 32P-labeled S1 oligonucleotide probe (WT protected region +1 to +40 or pseudo-WT protected region +1 to +32). Basal Transcription Initiation in Vitro by SL1 and Pol I—We first tested a highly purified human SL1 preparation free from UBF (see supplemental material) in combination with recombinant human UBF and extensively purified Pol I (free of UBF) for the ability to direct rRNA synthesis from the human ribosomal promoter. A high level of α-amanitin-resistant transcription initiation was achieved with UBF, SL1, and Pol I (Fig. 1, lane 1) from the rDNA promoter template (–515 to +1548). Importantly, Pol I transcription can also occur in the absence of UBF, albeit at lower levels (Fig. 1, compare lanes 1 and 2) but with an absolute requirement for SL1 (compare lanes 2 and 3). (Note that the faint band in lane 3 is transcription-unrelated; it can occur in control samples where no transcription occurs, including a negative control, for instance where no factors are added (data not shown)). Consistent with previous transcription analysis with promoter mutants in crude extracts (32Haltiner M.M. Smale S.T. Tjian R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 227-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 33Learned R.M. Smale S.T. Haltiner M.M. Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3558-3562Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), “basal” levels of transcription directed by SL1 and Pol I were supported by the core promoter element (Fig. 1, lanes 4 and 6, –83 template), whereas a partial deletion of the essential core element abolished transcription (Fig. 1, lane 5, –26 template). Removal of only the UCE resulted in basal levels of transcription in the presence of UBF, SL1, and Pol I (compare lanes 7 and 9); thus, UBF activation was entirely dependent on the UCE. Collectively, the data suggest that human SL1 can interact with the core promoter element independently of UBF and that this SL1-DNA complex directs specific transcription initiation by Pol I. SL1 Can Bind the Ribosomal Promoter Independently of UBF—So, does SL1 bind the promoter independently or does it bind only when in complex with Pol I? To address this question, an immobilized rDNA template was incubated with the highly purified fraction of SL1, which is free from UBF and Pol I. The immobilized DNA was washed to remove unbound SL1, and half the DNA templates were analyzed in a reconstituted transcription reaction to assess whether SL1 was specifically associated with the rDNA promoter elements. The other half was analyzed for bound SL1 subunits following immunoblotting (Fig. 2A). The SL1-rDNA complexes directed specific transcription initiation by Pol I in an SL1 dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2B). SL1 bound to a nonspecific DNA fragment had no detectable effect on end-to-end transcription by Pol I (data not shown). Consistent with the transcription results, the amount of TAFI110 detected on the rDNA template followed the increased amount of SL1 loaded onto the template, which demonstrated that SL1 could interact with the rDNA promoter independently (Fig. 2C, lanes 2-4). SL1 bound to a lesser extent to a similarly sized DNA fragment that is unrelated to rDNA (lanes 6-8). Similar results were obtained with TAFI63- and TBP-specific antibodies, which were more sensitive than those for TAFI110 (Fig. 2D). Importantly, there is a correlation between the level of transcription and the amount of SL1 on the rDNA template, suggesting that, although some SL1 is bound to the DNA template non-specifically and indeed SL1 displays a relaxed sequence-specificity, a proportion of the rDNA-bound SL1 is accurately positioned to function in transcription (Fig. 2, C and D, graphs). Taken together, these results demonstrate the autonomous binding of human SL1 to the rDNA promoter and support the concept of UBF-independent basal transcription initiation in vitro. SL1 Commits an rDNA Promoter Template for Transcription by Pol I—Immunoblotting of an immobilized rDNA promoter detects all SL1 bound, specifically and non-specifically, whereas the transcription assay detects only the promoter-bound fraction of SL1. Therefore, to study the stability of promoter-bound SL1, we performed template commitment assays (Fig. 3). In the assays, we used two promoter templates (Fig. 3A), transcription from which was distinguishable due to divergence of the template sequences at +10 and to the use of different length specific probes in the S1 nuclease protection assay. Transcription initiated from WT and pseudo-WT rDNA templates, in the presence of Pol I, SL1, UBF, and nucleotides, when incubated separately (Fig. 3B, lanes 2 and 1, respectively) or together (lane 5). However, when SL1 was pre-bound to the WT template and then this protein-DNA complex was incubated with the pseudo-WT template, little or no transcription was detected from the pseudo-WT template following the addition of Pol I, UBF, and nucleotides even after incubation with the pseudo-WT template for up to 30 min (Fig. 3B, lanes 6-9). The weak band observed with the pseudo-WT template (lanes 6-9), which does not increase with increasing time of incubation with the pseudo-WT template, might represent low levels of transcription supported either by a small amount of unstably bound SL1 or unbound SL1 not removed in the wash step. We conclude that SL1 binds stably to an rDNA promoter template and commits the template for transcription by Pol I. Dynamic Interactions of the Pol I Transcription Factors at the rDNA Promoter—We next considered the possibility that UBF could activate transcription by affecting the rate of formation or the stability of SL1-rDNA complexes during ordered PIC assembly at the promoter. SL1 and/or UBF were incubated with an excess of immobilized template rDNA, and the amount of each factor bound to the rDNA was determined at various time points (Fig. 4). Progressively more SL1 was bound to the rDNA over time, and it appeared that most if not all SL1 input had bound after 30 min (Fig. 4A, panel I, and 4B), consistent with stable binding of SL1 to the template DNA. UBF binding to the rDNA reached equilibrium after 1–2.5 min at 50% of the input UBF (Fig. 4A, panel II, and 4C), suggesting a high association and dissociation rate for UBF alone (Fig. 4A, compare panels I and II). Strikingly, UBF failed to increase the rate at which SL1 binds the rDNA (Fig. 4A, compare panels I and III, and 4B). Significantly, however, the dynamic equilibrium of UBF-DNA binding is shifted by SL1, as a result of which ∼100% of the UBF input was associated with the rDNA template after 30 min (Fig. 4A, compare panels II and III, and 4C). Collectively, these data suggest that SL1 stabilizes UBF at the rDNA promoter. SL1 Reduces the Dissociation of UBF from DNA—Stabilization by SL1 of UBF at the rDNA promoter may result from the ability of SL1 to decrease the rate of dissociation of UBF from the rDNA. To test this, we analyzed the dissociation of UBF and/or SL1 over time from preassembled rDNA promoter-protein complexes in the presence of an excess of nonspecific DNA, which serves as a “sink” for dissociated factors (Fig. 5). To reaffirm the correlation between the level of transcription and the amount of SL1 and/or UBF on the rDNA template, and thereby demonstrate that a fraction of the SL1 and/or UBF bound was specifically associated with the rDNA promoter, we performed binding studies and transcription assays using rDNA promoter templates with binding sites for both proteins. UBF dissociated rapidly from the rDNA when incubated with the rDNA template prior to the addition of SL1 and Pol I (Fig. 5A, panel I). The dissociation of UBF from the rDNA, as reflected in the reduced signals for UBF following immunoblotting of the protein-DNA complexes, correlated with decreased levels of transcription achieved in reconstituted transcription assays (Fig. 5A, panel II), suggesting that the UBF-promoter DNA complexes observed were primarily functional. Interestingly, the time taken for UBF to completely dissociate from the rDNA (<2.5 min) is similar to that required to reach equilibrium between the association and dissociation of UBF with the rDNA template (Figs. 5A, panel I, 4A, panel II, and 4C). This reaffirms a dynamic interaction of UBF with the rDNA in the absence of other factors, where rates of promoter association and dissociation appear similar, resulting in rapid exchange of UBF on the promoter. In contrast to the transient association of UBF with the promoter, SL1-rDNA complexes appear less dynamic. The SL1 complex remains relatively stably bound to its target DNA (Fig. 5B, panel I), again reflected in the levels of transcription achieved in reconstituted transcription assays (panel II). SL1 starts to dissociate detectably from the template following 5 min of exposure to an excess of calf thymus DNA (Fig. 5B, lanes 4-7). Incubation of SL1 and UBF together with the rDNA template significantly reduces the dissociation rate of UBF (Fig. 5, compare UBF binding in A, panel I, and C, panel I). Because SL1 itself is relatively stably bound to DNA, only a relatively small effect of UBF on SL1-rDNA complex stability was detectable (Fig. 5, compare B, panels I and II, with C, panels I and II). Taken together, these data confirm previous findings that SL1 and UBF interact in a cooperative manner at the promoter. Importantly, SL1 reduces the dissociation of UBF from the rDNA promoter. Therefore, SL1-promoter complex formation appears to be a necessary prerequisite to the assembly of functional and stable PICs that include the UBF activator. The TBP-TAF complex SL1 and UBF are required for efficient Pol I transcription initiation, and these proteins exhibit a cooperative interaction at the rDNA promoter. DNase I footprinting experiments had led to the proposal that UBF functions to recruit human SL1 to the promoter during PIC assembly (13Learned R.M. Learned T.K. Haltiner M.M. Tjian R.T.

However, UBF binding to DNA is neither sequence-specific nor restricted to the rDNA promoter region in vivo (25O'Sullivan A.C. Sullivan G.J. McStay B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 657-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar); therefore it is unclear how SL1 would be targeted specifically to the promoter by UBF. Furtherm"
https://openalex.org/W2144552075,"Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) is a genetic disorder in which patient cells exhibit lysosomal accumulation of cholesterol and sphingolipids (SLs) caused by defects in either NPC1 or NPC2 proteins. We previously demonstrated that NPC1 human skin fibroblasts overexpressing endosomal Rab proteins (Rab7 or Rab9) showed a correction in the storage disease phenotype. In the current study, we used protein transduction to further investigate Rab9-mediated reduction of stored lipids in NPC cells. Recombinant human Rab9 fused with the herpes simplex virus VP22 protein fragment was overexpressed, purified, and added to culture medium to induce protein transduction. When VP22-Rab9 was transduced into NPC1 fibroblasts, nearly all cells showed significant reduction in cellular free cholesterol levels, with no cytotoxicity up to 5 microM. A fraction of the VP22-Rab9 that was transduced into the cells was shown to bind to rab GDP dissociation inhibitor, suggesting that this pool of VP22-Rab9 had become prenylated. The reduction in cellular free cholesterol was associated with correction of abnormal intracellular trafficking of BODIPY-lactosylceramide and an increase of sterols in the culture media. The clearance of lysosomal free cholesterol was also associated with a decrease in LDL-receptor levels. In addition, we demonstrated reduction of intracellular cholesterol by VP22-Rab9 transduction in NPC2 fibroblasts and in cultured mouse NPC1 neurons. These observations provide important new information about the correction of membrane traffic in NPC cells by Rab9 overexpression and may lead to new therapeutic approaches for treatment of this disease."

F0F1-ATP synthase is a molecular rotary motor that is responsible for aerobic synthesis of ATP. It exhibits a headpiece (catalytic sector), a base piece (membrane sector), and two connecting stalks. Sector F1 containing the headpiece is a water-soluble unit that retains the ability to hydrolyze ATP when in soluble form. F0 is embedded in the membrane and is mainly composed of hydrophobic subunits forming a specific proton-conducting pathway. When the F1 and F0 sectors are coupled, the enzyme functions as a reversible H+-transporting ATPase or ATP synthase (1Senior A. Nadanaciva S. Weber J. Biochim. Biophys.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7971-7978Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), all identified in the S. cerevisiae enzyme (11Velours J. Arselin G. J. Bioenerg.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7170-7178Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Some of these subunits are not required for ATP synthesis function, but are involved in the dimerization/oligomerization of the mitochondrial ATP synthase (13Arnold I. Pfeiffer K. Neupert W.

These subunits are small hydrophobic proteins that have only one spanning segment with a N terminus inside the matrix, and the C terminus in the intermembrane space (12Arnold I. Bauer M.F. Brunner M. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 16Belogrudov G.I. Tomich J.M. Hatefi Y. J. Biol.

Tomich J.M. Hatefi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20340-20345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar).The subunits g and e have a conserved putative dimerization GXXXG motif located in the membrane-spanning segment. In subunit e, its alteration led to the loss of subunit g and the loss of dimeric and oligomeric forms of the yeast ATP synthase. The presence of a cysteine residue (Cys28) placed after the membrane domain of subunit e made it possible to establish, by cross-linking experiments, that two subunits e are close to each other in the membrane. This disulfide bond was shown to significantly stabilize ATP synthase dimerization/oligomerization in intact mitochondria (17Arselin G. Giraud M.F. Dautant A. Vaillier J. Brethes D. Coulary-Salin B. Schaeffer J. Velours J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1875-1884Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The subunit e also contains a putative coiled-coil region in its C-terminal part, which is involved in the stabilization of the dimeric forms of the detergent-solubilized ATP synthase complexes (18Everard-Gigot V. Dunn C. Dolan B. Brunner S. Jensen R. Stuart R. Eukaryotic Cells. 2005; 4: 346-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The study of subunits g and e is also important because the dimerization/oligomerization process of ATP synthase complex is linked to cristae biogenesis and mitochondrial morphology (13Arnold I. Pfeiffer K. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Schagger H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7170-7178Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 15Paumard P. Vaillier J. Coulary B. Schaeffer J. Soubannier V. Mueller D.M. Brethes D. di Rago J.P. Velours J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar).The most highly studied, and apparently widespread, mode of helix-helix association is mediated by the so-called GXXXG motif, which is known to act as a universal scaffold for the assembly of two transmembrane helices (19Russ W.P. Engelman D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 911-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). The GXXXG is a motif where two glycine residues are separated by any three amino acids on a helical framework. This arrangement of glycine residues allows the close approach of interacting helices, whereupon extensive packing interactions take place between pairs of surrounding residues. Despite the high occurrence of the GXXXG motif in transmembrane helices, the transmembrane peptide of glycophorin A is the only dimer mediated by a GXXXG motif for which the structure has been determined to high resolution (20Senes A. Ubarretxena-Belandia I. Engelman D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9056-9061Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Thus, it is not clear whether alternate structures for transmembrane dimers exist. Moreover, it is not known how residues surrounding GXXXG motifs “tailor” the affinity of their helix-helix interactions for required structural and functional purposes (21Melnyk R.A. Kim S. Curran A.R. Engelman D.M. Bowie J.U. Deber C.M. J. Biol.

Oligonucleotides were purchased from MWG-BIOTECH. All other reagents were of reagent grade quality.Yeast Strains and Nucleic Acid Techniques—The S. cerevisiae strain D273-10B/A/H/U (MATα, met6, ura3, his3) was the wild-type strain. The yeast mutants with a point mutation were named as (name of the subunit) (one-letter code of wild-type residue) (residue number) (mutant residue) (i.e. eC28S). The null mutant in the ATP20 gene (Δg) was constructed by PCR-based mutagenesis, and the kanr gene was removed. The gene ATP20 encoding subunit g was obtained by PCR amplification of genomic DNA and the resulting 1178-bp EcoRI-XhoI DNA fragment was cloned in the shuttle vector pRS313. A 1586-bp PvuII-EcoRV DNA fragment containing kanr was isolated from the pUG6 vector and inserted into the EcoRV site in the 3′ region of the ATP20 gene. The mutations gQ93A, gY98A, gG101L, g102A, gG105L, and gC75S/L109C were introduced by a PCR mutagenesis procedure into the resulting vector. The strains containing modified versions of subunit g were obtained by integration at the chromosomic locus of a 2777-bp EcoRI-ApaI DNA fragment, bearing the mutated versions of the ATP20 gene, in the Δg strain, and were selected for their resistance to geneticin. The strain containing the subunit gC75S/L109C(His)6 was constructed according to the following strategy. Two complementary oligonucleotides, 5′-TATAAACATCACCACCACCACCACCACCACTAAGCTTTT-3′ and 5′-GAATTAAAAAGCTTAGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGATG-3′, were used to introduce the (His)6 sequence into the C terminus of subunit gC75S/L109C by the PCR mutagenesis procedure. The point mutant eC28S was constructed by integration of the mutated version of the TIM11 gene at the chromosomic locus in the deleted-disrupted yeast strain (17Arselin G. Giraud M.F. Dautant A.

Protein amounts were determined according to Lowry et al. (22Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol.

The ATPase activity was measured at pH 8.4 in the presence of 0.375% Triton X-100 to remove the endogenous inhibitor of F1 (23Velours J. Vaillier J. Paumard P. Soubannier V. Lai-Zhang J. Mueller D.M.

The pellet was suspended at a protein concentration of 5 mg ml-1 in 0.1 m mannitol, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, containing either 5 mm EDTA and 5 mm NEM 1The abbreviations used are: NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; BN-PAGE, blue native-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. for the control experiment or 2 mm CuCl2 for cross-linking experiments. Incubations were performed at 4 °C for 30 min, and the reaction was stopped by addition of 5 mm EDTA and 5 mm NEM. Mitochondrial membranes were then dissociated in the presence of 20 mm NEM for SDS-gel electrophoresis and Western blot analysis. For BN-PAGE analyses of cross-linked products, mitochondrial membranes were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C after incubation with either 5 mm NEM or 2 mm CuCl2. Then proteins were extracted with a digitonin solution containing 5 mm NEM.Electrophoretic and Western Blot Analyses—Molecular mass markers (Benchmark Prestained Protein Ladder) were from Invitrogen.

Polyclonal antibodies against subunits g, e, and i were raised against amino acid residues 31-45, 69-82, and 39-51, respectively. Antibodies against subunits g, e, and i were used with dilutions of 1:5,000, 1:10,000, and 1:50,000, respectively. Membranes were incubated with peroxidase-labeled antibodies and visualized with 10 ml of 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 20 μm p-coumaric acid, 1.25 mm luminol, and 16.5 mm H2O2. When the visualization for subunit g and subunit e was necessary, membranes were stripped with 2% SDS, 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 67.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, for 20 min at 60 °C before incubation with the second antibody. BN-PAGE experiments were performed as described previously (26Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1886) Google Scholar). Mitochondria (1 mg of protein) were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with 0.1 ml of digitonin solution with the indicated digitonin/protein ratio. The extracts were centrifuged at 4 °C for 15 min at 40,000 × g, and aliquots (30 μl) were loaded on the top of a 3-13% polyacrylamide slab gel. After electrophoresis, the gel was incubated in a solution of 5 mm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.05% lead acetate, 50 mm glycine/NaOH, pH 8.4, to reveal the ATPase activity (27Grandier-Vazeille X. Guerin M. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 242: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar).RESULTSThe Dimerization Motif GXXXG of the Membrane-spanning Segment of Subunit g—The subunit g is 115 amino acids long, exposing the main part of the sequence in the matricial space of mitochondria and a short C-terminal domain (the last 10 residues) in the intermembrane space. Although this supernumerary subunit is not involved in ATP synthesis, its association with the ATP synthase complex and its participation in the dimerization of the mitochondrial ATP synthase has been well documented (15Paumard P. Vaillier J. Coulary B. Schaeffer J. Soubannier V. Mueller D.M. Brethes D. di Rago J.P. Velours J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). Subunit g has been identified in numerous organisms and a multiple alignment shows a limited number of fully conserved amino acid residues all located in the C-terminal part (Fig. 1A). They are the Gly101 and Gly105 residues (Fig. 1B) that lay in a predicted membrane-spanning segment beginning with Leu85 and ending with Gly105. The Tyr112, which is in the intermembrane space, is also conserved. In addition, positions 93, 98, 102, and 106, which display E/Q, F/Y, E/Q, and K/R residues, respectively are semiconservative. The transmembrane segment of subunit g displays a dimerization motif, GXXXG, found in glycophorin A (19Russ W.P. Engelman D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 911-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar) at position GEIIG (residues 101 to 105). The full conservation of the glycine residues suggested their involvement in a transmembrane helix-helix interaction. To address whether the conserved amino acid residues have a role in a dimerization process of the ATP synthase, several mutants were constructed. Mitochondria were prepared from the truncated mutants gV100stop, gR106stop, and gY112stop, from the gG101L and gG105L strains where the small residue was replaced by a large residue, and from mutant g102A having an alanine residue inserted after Gly101 to disrupt a helix-helix packing interface. The phenotypes and ATPase activities are reported in Table I.Table IPhenotypic analyses of the yeast strains used The wild-type strain was D273-10B/A/H/U. Yeast cells were grown on complete medium containing 2% lactate as carbon source. The doubling time was calculated for a 10-h period during the logarithmic growing phase. The rho- cell production in cultures was measured on glycerol plates supplemented with 0.1% glucose. ATPase activities and sensitivity to oligomycin (6 μg/ml) were measured in the presence of Triton X-100 to remove the F1 inhibitor.StrainsDoubling time% of rho- cells in culturesATPase activitiesControl+ OligomycinInhibitionmin%μmol of Pi/min/mg of protein%Wild type18216.68 ± 0.290.51 ± 0.1092gC75S/L109C16816.78 ± 0.030.53 ± 0.0592eC28S/gC75S/L109C17026.66 ± 0.190.60 ± 0.0691gQ93A244256.49 ± 0.302.02 ± 0.0369gQ93E18616.60 ± 0.090.51 ± 0.0992gY98A364376.98 ± 0.062.36 ± 0.0666gV100stop238286.98 ± 0.052.83 ± 0.0259gG101L283296.67 ± 0.052.58 ± 0.0861g102A306306.72 ± 0.372.78 ± 0.0859gG105L283276.87 ± 0.052.78 ± 0.0259gR106stop250176.03 ± 0.422.47 ± 0.0959gY112stop17816.56 ± 0.020.45 ± 0.0493 Open table in a new tab With the exception of the mutant gY112stop all other mutants cited above displayed an increase in the doubling time with lactate as the carbon source. In addition, a spontaneous conversion into rho- cells was observed. As reported previously (15Paumard P. Vaillier J. Coulary B. Schaeffer J. Soubannier V. Mueller D.M. Brethes D. di Rago J.P. Velours J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar, 17Arselin G. Giraud M.F. Dautant A. Vaillier J. Brethes D. Coulary-Salin B. Schaeffer J. Velours J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1875-1884Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), there is a correlation between the increase in the spontaneous rho- cell conversion (rho- cells that are devoid of oxidative phosphorylation are unable to grow with lactate as carbon source) and the increase in the generation time of mutant strains. It is also possible to correlate the increase in the spontaneous rho- cell conversion with the increase in the insensitivity of the mitochondrial ATPase activity of the five mutants toward oligomycin (an inhibitor of membranous domain of the mitochondrial ATP synthase) under the experimental conditions used (pH 8.4 and Triton X-100) (Table I).If the GXXXG motif is juxtaposed in a dimer interface, facilitating close helix-helix approach, a right-handed or a left-handed dimer could be obtained. In a right-handed dimer the semiconservative Gln93 residue could be near the Gln93 in the other subunit g of the dimer, making an interhelical hydrogen bond, an interaction capable of mediating the association of membrane-embedded helices (28Dawson J.P. Melnyk R.A. Deber C.M. Engelman D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 331: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In a left-handed dimer, the Tyr98, which is also a semiconservative residue, could be involved (Fig. 1B). Two additional mutations in these semiconservative positions were constructed. The Gln93 was replaced either for an alanine residue or a glutamate residue, an amino acid residue found in subunits g of other species. Whereas substitution of Gln93 by a glutamate did not alter the doubling time and did not increase the rho- cell conversion, gQ93A replacement affected generation time, conversion into rho- cells, and sensitivity to the F0 inhibitor. When Tyr98 was replaced by alanine the effects observed under the doubling time and the conversion into rho- cells were significantly more pronounced than in all other mutations (Table I).Conserved Amino Acid Residues of Subunit g Are Essential for the Presence of Subunit g in the Mitochondrial Membranes—Subunit g is an unstable protein that disappears upon alteration of either subunits e or subunit 4 (b) (14Soubannier V.

As a consequence, the presence of subunit g in mutant mitochondria was examined by Western blot analysis. The blots were probed with polyclonal antibodies raised against subunits g or e. Subunit i, which is a component of the yeast F0, was used as control. The gQ93A, gY98A, gG101L, g102A, and gG105L mutant mitochondria were fully devoid of subunit g (Fig. 2), and subunit e was found principally as a dimer, resulting from the oxidation of Cys28, an observation that has been already reported in mutants devoid of subunit g (29Giraud M.F. Paumard P. Soubannier V. Vaillier J. Arselin G. Salin B. Schaeffer J. Brethes D. di Rago J.P. Velours J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1555: 174-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In addition, an unidentified product involving subunit e was observed in the molecular mass range of 17 kDa. A small amount of subunit g was found in gV100stop and gR106stop mitochondria, thus showing that a subunit g at least 106 amino acids long is required for its presence in the mitochondrial membrane. However, the truncated mutant gY112stop has no alterations in physiological parameters (Table I). It shows a normal amount of the modified subunit g as revealed by Western blot (not shown), indicating that conserved residue Tyr112 is not involved in a stabilizing function. Whereas an alanine residue could not replace Gln93, a glutamate residue (gQ93E) altered neither the generation time (Table I) nor the presence of subunit g in the mitochondrial membrane. These data are in agreement with the presence of a glutamate residue at this position in other subunits g (Fig. 1A).Fig. 2Mitochondria isolated from yeast cells having mutations in the membrane-spanning segment of subunit g are deficient in subunit g. Mitochondria isolated from wild-type (lane 1) gV100stop (lane 2), gR106stop (lane 3), null-mutant Δg (lane 4), null-mutant Δg containing the nonintegrative vector pRS313 bearing the ATP20 gene (lane 5), gQ93A (lane 6), gQ93E (lane 7), gY98A (lane 8), gG101L (lane 9), g102A (lane 10), and gG105L (lane 11) were treated with NEM as described under “Experimental Procedures” to prevent disulfide bond formation during the dissociation with SDS. Aliquots (50 μg of protein) were analyzed by Western blot.

Therefore, the presence of supramolecular species of the ATP synthase in the mitochondrial digitonin extracts of gV100stop and gR106stop mutants was examined by BN-PAGE. The digitonin extracts were loaded on a 3-13% acrylamide slab gel, and the mitochondrial complexes were separated under native conditions. The gel was incubated with ATP-Mg2+ and Pb2+ to reveal the ATPase activity (Fig. 3). As reported previously, the wild-type digitonin extracts contained the dimeric and oligomeric forms of the enzyme that were destabilized upon increasing the digitonin-to-protein ratio (13Arnold I.

The mitochondrial digitonin extracts of mutant strains did not display any oligomeric form of the ATP synthase. Whatever the digitonin-to-protein ratio used, the monomeric form of the enzyme was predominant, although a small amount of dimeric form was found, as already observed for null mutants devoid of either subunit e or subunit g (13Arnold I.

Because the two glycine residues are essential for the structure of this motif, a target was chosen outside the motif but in the alignment of the glycine residues if this part of the protein were a α-helix-like glycophorin A (19Russ W.P. Engelman D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 911-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). As a consequence, a cysteine residue was placed at position 109. In addition, the unique endogenous Cys75 of subunit g was replaced by a serine residue. To prevent disulfide bond formation between subunits e and g, the unique endogenous Cys28 of subunit e was also replaced by a serine residue. Western blot analysis of CuCl2-treated eC28S/gC75S/L109C mitochondria showed the presence of a 26-kDa band that was absent in mutant gC75S, thus indicating the involvement of L109C in the formation of a g - g adduct (Fig. 5, lanes 1 and 2). To demonstrate that the 26-kDa band corresponded to a homodimer of subunit g resulting from the formation of a disulfide bond between the two subunit g, the two following strains were constructed: strain eC28S/gC75S/L109C(His)6 contained a (His)6 tag in the C-terminal part of subunit g. The second mutant was constructed from the eC28S/gC75S/L109C strain by complementation with a pRS316 shuttle vector bearing the gene encoding"
https://openalex.org/W2027092355,"Cysteine string protein (CSP) is an abundant regulated secretory vesicle protein that is composed of a string of cysteine residues, a linker domain, and an N-terminal J domain characteristic of the DnaJ/Hsp40 co-chaperone family. We have shown previously that CSP associates with heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins (G proteins) and promotes G protein inhibition of N-type Ca2+ channels. To elucidate the mechanisms by which CSP modulates G protein signaling, we examined the effects of CSP1–198 (full-length), CSP1–112, and CSP1–82 on the kinetics of guanine nucleotide exchange and GTP hydrolysis. In this report, we demonstrate that CSP selectively interacts with Gαs and increases steady-state GTP hydrolysis. CSP1–198 modulation of Gαs was dependent on Hsc70 (70-kDa heat shock cognate protein) and SGT (small glutamine-rich tetratricopeptide repeat domain protein), whereas modulation by CSP1–112 was Hsc70-SGT-independent. CSP1–112 preferentially associated with the inactive GDP-bound conformation of Gαs. Consistent with the stimulation of GTP hydrolysis, CSP1–112 increased guanine nucleotide exchange of Gαs. The interaction of native Gαs and CSP was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation and showed that Gαs associates with CSP. Furthermore, transient expression of CSP in HEK cells increased cellular cAMP levels in the presence of the β2 adrenergic agonist isoproterenol. Together, these results demonstrate that CSP modulates G protein function by preferentially targeting the inactive GDP-bound form of Gαs and promoting GDP/GTP exchange. Our results show that the guanine nucleotide exchange activity of full-length CSP is, in turn, regulated by Hsc70-SGT.

G proteins constitute a family of heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins that act as transducers in a variety of transmembrane signaling systems. G proteins are composed of α, β, and γ subunits that dissociate into Gα and Gβγ upon activation. Activation of G proteins involves an exchange of GDP for GTP on Gα subunits and the release of GTP-bound Gα and Gβγ to interact with effector molecules. Effector molecules include adenylate cyclase, phospholipases, phosphodiesterases, and ion channels. Several modulators of G proteins have been identified and are thought to play crucial roles in the kinetics of G protein signaling (e.g. guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), 1The abbreviations used are: GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; CSP, cysteine string protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate); SGT, small glutamine-rich tetratricopeptide. guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors, and GTPase-activating proteins). Our previous work has identified cysteine string protein (CSP) as a novel modulator of G proteins (1Magga J.M. Jarvis S.E. Arnot M.I. Zamponi G.W. Braun J.E.

Although the functional parallels between CSP and established G protein modulators are evident, the molecular mechanism by which CSP regulates G proteins is not yet known. CSPs are secretory vesicle proteins of 34 kDa that contain three conserved domains: a J domain, a linker domain, and a cysteine string region (Fig. 1A). The J domain is a 70-amino acid region of homology shared by DnaJ (a well characterized bacterial co-chaperone) and many otherwise unrelated eukaryotic proteins. The linker domain is a 30-amino acid domain conserved between human and Drosophila CSP. CSP, so called because it contains a cysteine-rich domain that in rats consists of a string of nine cysteine residues flanked on the C-terminal side by three additional cysteines, is localized on synaptic vesicles (4Mastrogiacomo A. Parsons S.M. Zampighi G.A. Jenden D.J. Umbach J.A. Gundersen C.B. Science. 1994; 263: 981-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), zymogen granules (5Braun J.E. Scheller R.H.

Chem. 1996; 271: 19514-19517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Most of the cysteine residues are palmitoylated and are required for membrane attachment to the secretory vesicle (7Gundersen C.B. Mastrogiacomo A. Faull K. Umbach J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19197-19199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Chamberlain L.H. Burgoyne R.D. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In contrast to the conserved J domain, linker domain, and cysteine string regions, the C terminus diverges among CSP isoforms (9Evans G.J. Morgan A. Burgoyne R.D. Traffic. 2003; 4: 653-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). CSP plays a crucial role in neurotransmitter release; however, its function is controversial. Deletion of the CSP gene in Drosophila melanogaster severely impairs central and presynaptic transmission (10Zinsmaier K.E. Eberle K.K. Buchner E. Walter N. Benzer S.

The small number of flies that survive to adulthood is characterized by spasmic jumping, intense shaking, temperature-sensitive paralysis, and premature death. Deletion of CSP in mice results in severe impairment of synaptic transmission and neurodegeneration with no survival beyond 3 months (13Fernandez-Chacon R. Wolfel M. Nishimune H. Tabares L.

Age- and temperature-dependent deterioration of CSP null mutants suggests a chaperone role for CSP in regulating conformation and the activity of synaptic protein(s). Indeed, CSP has been proposed to function as a trimeric complex with two molecular chaperones, Hsc70 (70-kDa heat shock cognate protein) (14Braun J.E. Wilbanks S.M. Scheller R.H. J. Biol.

However, the involvement of Hsc70 and SGT in the CSP modulation of G protein function has not yet been examined. We have shown that CSP associates with G proteins and promotes Gβγ inhibition of N-type Ca2+ channels (1Magga J.M. Jarvis S.E. Arnot M.I. Zamponi G.W. Braun J.E.

N-type Ca2+ channels are effectors of Gβγ such that direct binding of G protein βγ subunits to the Ca2+ channel α1 subunit results in a stabilization of the deep closed states of the channel (18Jarvis S.E.

The mechanism by which CSP modulates G protein function has not yet been fully evaluated. A striking feature of CSP is that it contains two G protein binding sites (Fig. 1). The region of CSP encoded by amino acids 83–112 associates with Gβ and/or Gαβγ (2Miller L.C. Swayne L.A. Kay J.G. Feng Z.P. Jarvis S.E. Zamponi G.W. Braun J.E.A. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 2967-2974Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In contrast, an N-terminal site binds Gα subunits but not Gβγ subunits (1Magga J.M. Jarvis S.E. Arnot M.I. Zamponi G.W. Braun J.E. Neuron. 2000; 28: 195-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). These binding sites do not have homology with established modulators of G proteins. Each CSP binding site independently modulates G protein inhibition of N-type Ca2+ channels, and we have shown that they do this by distinct but yet to be determined molecular mechanisms (2Miller L.C. Swayne L.A. Kay J.G. Feng Z.P. Jarvis S.E. Zamponi G.W. Braun J.E.A. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 2967-2974Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Here we examine GTPase activity of Gαs and Gαi in the presence of CSP and CSP truncations encoding one or both G protein binding sites. Our findings demonstrate that CSP stimulates GDP/GTP exchange of Gαs and that modulation of G proteins by CSP is, in turn, regulated by the molecular chaperones Hsc70-SGT.

The beads were spun down and washed four times with 1 ml of the same buffer containing 10 μm GDP, or 10 μm GDP, 30 μm AlCl3, and 10 mm NaF, or 10 μm GTPγS. Bound proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer and separated on 12% SDS-gels. GTPase Assay—Steady-state GTPase reactions were performed using Gαs or Gαi1 subunits (0.3 μm) in the presence or absence of various concentrations of GST-CSP1–82 or GST-CSP1–112 and 0.6 μm Gβ1γ1 (21Kleuss C. Pallast M. Brendel S. Rosenthal W. Schultz G. J. Chromatogr. 1987; 407: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). GTPase activity measurements were initiated by mixing proteins with 20 μm [γ-32P]GTP (5 μCi) in 100 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) buffer containing 130 mm NaCl and 10 mm MgSO4. Aliquots (20 μl) were withdrawn at the indicated times and transferred to 100 μl of 7% perchloric acid. Nucleotides were precipitated using 700 μl of 10% (w/v) charcoal suspension in phosphate-buffered saline. 32Pi formation was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Results were fit with linear regression. GTPγS Binding Assay—Gαs and Gαi1 subunits (0.3 μm) were incubated for 5 min at 25 °C in 200 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) buffer containing 130 mm NaCl and 10 mm MgSO4 in the presence of a 1 μm concentration of GST, GST-CSP1–82, or GST-CSP1–112. Binding reactions were started by the addition of 5 μm [35S]GTPγS (2 μCi). Aliquots of 20 μl were withdrawn at the indicated times, mixed with 1 ml of the same buffer containing 1 mm GTP and passed through Whatman cellulose nitrate filters (0.45 μm). The filters were then washed three times with 3 ml of the same buffer and counted in a liquid scintillation counter. The apparent rate constant (kapp) values for the binding reactions were calculated by fitting the data to the following equation: GTPγS bound (%) = 100% · (1 - e-kt), where t is time of reaction. Preparation of Rat Brain Homogenate—Rat brains were homogenized in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 2 mm MgSO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and EDTA-free inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The homogenate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C to obtain soluble fractions (Fig. 6, S). The pellet was washed twice with the same buffer and solubilized in the same buffer containing 1% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (Calbiochem) for 60 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant (100,000 × g, 1 h, 4 °C) constituted solubilized membrane fraction (Fig. 6, M). Protein concentrations were determined by a Bio-Rad protein assay using bovine serum albumin as the standard. All of the procedures were carried out in strict accordance with a protocol approved by the University of Calgary Animal Care Committee. Immunoprecipitations—CSP polyclonal antibodies raised against the peptide sequence corresponding to amino acids 182–198 of rat CSP and the entire CSP recombinant protein were described previously (5Braun J.E. Scheller R.H. Neuropharmacology. 1995; 34: 1361-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The membrane fraction solubilized by 1% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside was precleared by incubation with GammaBind G-Sepharose (30-μl bed volume) in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH7.4) buffer containing 130 mm NaCl and 2 mm MgSO4 for 30 min at 25 °C. Immunoprecipitation was achieved by incubating the precleared membrane fraction with the indicated antibodies overnight at 4 °C followed by GammaBind G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) (20-μl bed volume) for 30 min at 25 °C. The mixtures were then centrifuged, and the pellets were washed three times with 200 μl of incubation buffer containing 50 μm GDP. Samples were washed and resuspended in 30 μl of sample buffer prior to immunoblotting. Immunoblotting—Proteins were transferred electrophoretically at 70 V for 45 min from polyacrylamide gels to 0.45 μm of nitrocellulose in 20 mm Tris, 150 mm glycine, and 12% methanol. Transferred proteins were visualized with Ponceau S. Nitrocellulose membranes were blocked for nonspecific binding using 5% milk, 0.1% Tween 20, and phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.3) (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4, 1.4 mm KH2PO4) prior to a 2-h incubation with primary antibody. The membranes were washed three times in the above milk/Tween/phosphate-buffered saline solution and incubated with goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse IgG-coupled horseradish peroxidase. Antigen was detected using chemiluminescent horseradish peroxidase substrate (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Immunoreactive bands were visualized following exposure of the membranes to Amersham Hyperfilm-MP. cAMP Assays—Human embryonic kidney tsa-201 (HEK) cells were seeded into 12-well plates and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. At 70% confluency, cells were transfected with pcDNA3/Rous sarcoma virus/His-hemagglutinin-β2-adrenergic receptor (gift from M. Bouvier, University of Montreal), pMT2-CSP (1Magga J.M. Jarvis S.E. Arnot M.I. Zamponi G.W. Braun J.E. Neuron. 2000; 28: 195-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), or a combination of both using FuGENE 6 according to the manufacturer's directions. Forty-eight h post-transfection, cells were incubated for three min at 37 °C with serum-free medium, 50 μm isoproterenol, or 100 μm forskolin. Medium was then aspirated, and cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were lysed with 280 μl of 0.1 m HCl. Lysates were centrifuged at 600 × g, and the supernatant was collected. cAMP levels of the supernatant (100 μl) were quantified using a Direct cAMP Enzyme Immunoassay kit (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. CSP Stimulates Steady-state Hydrolysis of GTP by Gαs—To begin to investigate the mechanism by which CSP modulates G proteins, we evaluated GTPase steady-state activity in the presence of purified recombinant full-length CSP (CSP1–198). Fig. 1B shows that the GTP hydrolysis by Gαs was not altered in the presence of CSP. In contrast, GTP hydrolysis was increased ∼4-fold in the presence of the proposed trimeric chaperone complex CSP1–198-Hsc701–646-SGT1–314. In the absence of CSP, Hsc70-SGT did not alter GTPase activity, indicating that CSP is required for the Gαs modulation. Binary complexes of CSP1–198-Hsc701–646 and CSP1–198-SGT1–314 both triggered an increase in steady-state GTPase activity but to a lesser extent than the trimeric complex. The addition of 50 μm ATP to the assay required for Hsc70 activity did not alter GTP hydrolysis (data not shown). Neither the ATPase, Hsc70 (not shown) nor the proposed trimeric chaperone complex Hsc70-SGT-CSP was observed to stimulate GTP hydrolysis in the absence of Gαs, which demonstrates that the chaperone complex does not hydrolyze GTP. Thus, stimulation of the GTPase activity of Gαs by CSP is specific and requires Hsc70-SGT but cannot be attributed to a generalized folding/refolding chaperone-like action on Gαs by Hsc70-SGT. To further evaluate the modulation of Gα by CSP, we utilized full-length CSP and purified recombinant truncations of CSP containing either one G protein binding site (CSP1–82) or both G protein binding sites (CSP1–112). Fig. 2 demonstrates that CSP1–112 triggered a large increase in the rate of GTP hydrolysis by Gαs but not Gαi, whereas CSP1–82 had a modest effect on Gαs. SGT and Hsc70 did not further enhance the GTP hydrolysis by Gαs in the presence of either CSP1–112 or CSP1–82 (data not shown). In agreement with the data shown in Fig. 1, CSP did not stimulate Gαs above basal levels in the absence of Hsc70-SGT. The use of CSP1–82 and CSP1–112 truncations rather than full-length CSP eliminates any potential influence from the cysteine string region of full-length recombinant CSP in the GTPase assay, given that interactions can occur with this region that are not characteristic of native palmitoylated CSP (22Swayne L.A. Blattler C. Kay J.G. Braun J.E.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 300: 921-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). A dose dependence of the effect of CSP1–112 on the GTPase activity of Gαs revealed a relatively strong affinity between the two proteins (EC50 415 nm) and a maximal stimulation of ∼8-fold (Fig. 3). Taken together, these results indicate that CSP directly and specifically modulates the GTPase activity of Gαs through a region encoded by amino acids 1–112, that this region is autoinhibited in full-length CSP, and that autoinhibition is removed by Hsc70-SGT.Fig. 3Dose-dependent effects of CSP1–112 on steady-state GTPase activities of Gαs and heterotrimeric Gαsβ1γ1. Steady-state GTPase activities of Gαs alone (▪, 0.3 μm) or preincubated with Gβ1γ1 (▾, 0.6 μm) for 10 min at 25 °C were measured following the additions of indicated concentrations of GST-CSP1–112. Turnover numbers for the GTPase reactions were plotted as functions of CSP1–112 concentration and fit with the sigmoidal dose response equation. The calculated EC50 values were (mean ± S.D.): Gαs, 415 ± 30 nm; Gαsβγ, 740 ± 40 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Next we examined the effect of CSP1–112 on GTPase activity of heterotrimeric Gs. Gαs was first preincubated with Gβ1γ1 followed by the addition of CSP1–112. Consistent with the previous report (23Graziano M.P. Freissmuth M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 409-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the addition of Gβ1γ1 decreased the basal steady-state GTP hydrolysis by Gαs (Fig. 3). The dose dependence for the effect of CSP1–112 on heterotrimeric Gs was shifted to the right (EC50 740 nm), whereas the maximal effect was proportional to the stimulation of monomeric Gαs (Fig. 3). This suggests that because of a partial overlap of the Gβγ and CSP1–112 binding sites on Gαs, CSP is a more potent modulator of the monomeric Gα subunit. CSP Stimulates the Nucleotide Exchange of Gαs—The rate of GTP hydrolysis by G protein α subunits under steady-state conditions is believed to be limited by the rate of guanine-nucleotide exchange due to slow release of GDP. Because CSP1–112 was more effective in stimulating GTPase activity of Gαs, the effects of GST-CSP1–112 on guanine nucleotide exchange of Gαs and Gαi were tested using the GTPγS binding assay. CSP1–112 increased the initial rate of GTPγS binding to Gαs but not Gαi (Fig. 4). Conformational Selectivity of CSP—G proteins switch between two main conformations: inactive GDP-bound and active GTP-bound. To examine in detail the conformational selectivity of the Gα-CSP association, we investigated the binding of CSP1–82 and CSP1–112 GST fusion proteins to GαsGTPγS, GαsGDPAlF4, and GαsGDP. The binding of GST fusion proteins was analyzed by coprecipitation of Gαs with the CSP truncations using glutathione-agarose beads. The amounts of coprecipitated Gαs were assessed with Coomassie Blue-stained gels. The full-length GST-CSP was not included in this assay as it co-migrates with Gαs on SDS-PAGE. Fig. 5 demonstrates that both CSP1–82 and CSP1–112 bind tightly to GαsGDP but not to GαsGTPγS. CSP1–112 also bound GαsGDPAlF4, reflective of the transition state between inactive and active states; however, CSP1–82 did not interact with GαsGDPAlF4. This evidence demonstrates that CSP preferentially associates with inactive GDP-bound conformations of Gαs subunits. Association of Native Gαs and CSP—Next, we evaluated the interaction of native Gαs-CSP. To investigate the association of Gαs-CSP in brain tissue, we solubilized rat brain in 1% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside and performed immunoprecipitations. The immunoprecipitations were resolved by SDS-PAGE and were analyzed for the presence of Gαs and Hsc70 by Western blotting. Fig. 6 demonstrates that anti-CSP polyclonal (peptide), anti-CSP polyclonal (protein), and anti-Gαs (Santa Cruz) were capable of precipitating Gαs. These results are consistent with our previous reports demonstrating the association of Gα and recombinant CSP (1Magga J.M. Jarvis S.E. Arnot M.I. Zamponi G.W. Braun J.E. Neuron. 2000; 28: 195-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 2Miller L.C. Swayne L.A. Kay J.G. Feng Z.P. Jarvis S.E. Zamponi G.W. Braun J.E.A. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 2967-2974Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) that have been confirmed by others (24Evans G.J. Wilkinson M.C. Graham M.E. Turner K.M. Chamberlain L.H. Burgoyne R.D. Morgan A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47877-47885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In contrast, Gαs did not coprecipitate significantly with rabbit nonimmune serum, GammaBind G-Sepharose, or IgG1. Hsc70 was absent from the Gαs-CSP complexes precipitated with anti-CSP (peptide) and anti-CSP (protein) but present in the Gαs-CSP complexes precipitated with anti-Gαs polyclonal. In agreement with these results, we have reported previously that the CSP/Hsc70 interaction is transient (1Magga J.M. Jarvis S.E. Arnot M.I. Zamponi G.W. Braun J.E. Neuron. 2000; 28: 195-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 14Braun J.E. Wilbanks S.M. Scheller R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25989-25993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). A nonspecific band representing IgG heavy chains is observed in Fig. 6, lane 6. As expected, Gαs was significantly enriched in the membrane-bound fraction, and Hsc70 was present in both the membrane and cytosol fractions. CSP Stimulates cAMP Generation—To further evaluate the role of CSP in G protein signaling, we examined the ability of transiently expressed CSP to stimulate cAMP production. Human endothelial kidney cells were transfected with CSP, β2 adrenergic receptor, or CSP + β2 adrenergic receptor. Stimulation of β2 adrenergic receptor-transfected cells with isoproterenol evoked a 10-fold increase in cellular cAMP levels. In cells expressing full-length CSP and the β2 adrenergic receptor, isoproterenol evoked a 27-fold increase in cAMP levels (Fig. 7). In the absence of isoproterenol, small increases in cAMP levels were observed in cells transfected with CSP compared with control cells; however, these increases were not significant. Likewise, only slight effects of CSP were observed on forskolin-induced cAMP production, which does not require Gαs; however, these increases were not found to be significant. These data are consistent with the conclusions that CSP enhances Gαs-mediated signaling by functioning as a GEF. In summary, we have provided the first evidence that the DnaJ/Hsp40 family member and secretory vesicle protein CSP modulates the GDP/GTP exchange of Gαs. Data presented here indicate that upon activation by Hsc70-SGT, CSP is a direct GEF for Gαs. We have found that CSP, a secretory vesicle protein, is able to significantly enhance the GTP hydrolysis of Gαs by stimulating GDP/GTP exchange. CSP is selective for Gαs and, as such, is the first GEF to be identified for Gαs. The CSP-Gαs complex was detectable by immunoprecipitation and affinity chromatography. In addition, expression of CSP in HEK cells increased isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP levels, demonstrating that CSP enhances signaling through Gαs. Data presented here show that the molecular chaperones, Hsc70 and SGT, serve as a molecular switch, turning on the GEF activity of CSP. Indeed, we have shown previously that CSP strongly activates the ATPase activity of Hsc70 via its J domain (14Braun J.E. Wilbanks S.M. Scheller R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25989-25993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that SGT interacts with the C terminus of both Hsc70 and CSP and increases the ATPase activity of Hsc70 (17Tobaben S. Thakur P. Fernandez-Chacon R. Sudhof T.C. Rettig J. Stahl B. Neuron. 2001; 31: 987-999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Consistent with our results showing that stimulation of Gαs is greater for the trimeric CSP-Hsc70-SGT complex than the CSP-Hsc70 and CSP-SGT binary complexes (Fig. 1), the trimeric complex has been reported to have greater Hsc70 ATPase activity than the binary complexes (17Tobaben S. Thakur P. Fernandez-Chacon R. Sudhof T.C. Rettig J. Stahl B. Neuron. 2001; 31: 987-999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Based on our observation that deletion of the C terminus of CSP (amino acids 113–192) increases GEF activity and makes it independent of Hsc70 and SGT (Fig. 2 and data not shown), we speculate that the C terminus of CSP serves as a regulatory domain that autoinhibits the GEF activity of CSP. C terminus autoinhibition of GEF activity is switched off in the presence of Hsc70 and SGT. We hypothesize that distinct regions of CSP serve as both the activator (J domain) and target (C terminus) for Hsc70 and SGT and that a conformational change in CSP unmasks the GEF activity (J domain and linker region) for Gαs. Notably, four CSP isoforms have been identified in mammals with variable C termini but highly conserved J domains, linker regions, and cysteine string regions. Perhaps autoinhibition by amino acids 113–198 and removal of the inhibition by Hsc70-SGT is unique to CSP1 (the isoform examined in this study). Consistent with our domain analysis, recen"

In this report, we demonstrated that calmodulin (CaM) co-immunoprecipitates with the 5-HT2A receptor in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts in an agonist-dependent manner and that the receptor contains two putative CaM binding regions. The putative CaM binding regions of the 5-HT2A receptor are localized to the second intracellular loop and carboxyl terminus. In an in vitro binding assay peptides encompassing the putative second intracellular loop (i2) and carboxyl-terminal (ct) CaM binding regions bound CaM in a Ca2+-dependent manner. The i2 peptide bound with apparent higher affinity and shifted the mobility of CaM in a nondenaturing gel shift assay. Fluorescence emission spectral analyses of dansyl-CaM showed apparent KD values of 65 ± 30 nm for the i2 peptide and 168 ± 38 nm for the ct peptide. The ct CaM-binding domain overlaps with a putative protein kinase C (PKC) site, which was readily phosphorylated by PKC in vitro. CaM binding and phosphorylation of the ct peptide were found to be antagonistic, suggesting a putative role for CaM in the regulation of 5-HT2A receptor phosphorylation and desensitization. Finally, we showed that CaM decreases 5-HT2A receptor-mediated [35S]GTPγS binding to NIH-3T3 cell membranes, supporting a possible role for CaM in regulating receptor-G protein coupling.

Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 230-237PubMed Google Scholar). In essentially all cases, activation of downstream signaling molecules has been shown to be mediated by heterotrimeric G proteins. Calmodulin (CaM) is a small (148 amino acids, ∼17 kDa), soluble protein, which functions as the major calcium sensor in most cells (27Saimi Y. Kung C. Ann. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 289-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). As a prototypical member of the EF-hand family of Ca2+-binding proteins, CaM can bind up to four Ca2+ ions, which subsequently extend the protein to expose hydrophobic patches capable of binding cellular targets (28Babu Y.S.

J. 1998; 74: 1622-1639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). These targets number well over one hundred and include enzymes, ion channels, transcription factors, and cytoskeletal proteins. Recently, CaM has been shown to bind to several plasma membrane receptors, including the epidermal growth factor receptor, platelet glycoprotein VI, and some GPCRs (30Li H. Villalobo A. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 499-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 31Andrews R.K. Suzuki-Inoue K. Shen Y. Tulasne D. Watson S.P. Berndt M.C. Blood. 2002; 99: 4219-4221Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The first GPCR that was shown to interact with CaM was the metabotropic glutamate subtype 5 receptor, which contains a CaM-binding site in a region of the extended carboxyl terminus of the receptor also known to bind G protein βγ subunits (32El Far O. Bofill-Cardona E. Airas J.M. O'Connor V. Boehm S. Freissmuth M. Nanoff C. Betz H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30662-30669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the interaction of CaM with the third intracellular loop of D2-dopamine and μ-opioid receptors was shown to regulate receptor coupling to Pertussis toxin-sensitive heterotrimeric G proteins (33Bofill-Cardona E. Kudlacek O. Yang Q. Ahorn H. Freissmuth M. Nanoff C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32672-32680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 34Wang D. Sadee W. Quillan J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22081-22088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), whereas Nickols et al. (35Nickols H.H. Shah V.N. Chazin W.J. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46969-46980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) showed that the interaction of CaM with the V2-vasopressin receptor modulates ligand-induced elevations in intracellular calcium. Our group recently showed that CaM interacts with the Gi/o-coupled 5-HT1A receptor at two distinct sites in the receptor third intracellular loop in regions that overlap with protein kinase C phosphorylation sites (36Turner J.H. Gelasco A.K. Raymond J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17027-17037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Interestingly, binding of CaM to synthetic peptides corresponding to these regions prevented phosphorylation of the peptides by protein kinase C. Furthermore, binding of CaM to the 5-HT1A receptor decreases G protein coupling as assayed by GTPγS binding to crude membrane preparations. 2J. H. Turner and J. R. Raymond, unpublished data. These examples indicate that CaM interactions may play important and diverse roles in GPCR signaling. CaM has previously been shown to be a major target for 5-HT2A receptor signaling. Agonist-mediated up-regulation of the 5-HT2A receptor is dependent upon both CaM and CaM-dependent kinase 2 (37Iken K. Cheng S. Fargin A. Goulet A.C. Kouassi E. Cell. Immunol. 1995; 163: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Berg et al. (38Berg K.A. Clarke W.P. Chen Y. Ebersole B.J. McKay R.D. Maayani S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 826-836PubMed Google Scholar) showed that CaM is required for 5-HT2A receptor-mediated formation of cAMP in A1A1 cells. Likewise, the CaM-dependent enzymes CaM-dependent kinase 2 and calcineurin (a CaM-dependent phosphatase) play roles in 5-HT-induced cyclooxygenase 2 mRNA expression in renal mesangial cells (39Stroebel M. Goppelt-Struebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22952-22957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Goppelt-Struebe M. Hahn A. Stroebel M. Reiser C.O. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Finally, the 5-HT2A receptor activates extracellular signal-regulated mitogen-activated protein kinases through the intermediate action of Ca2+/CaM (1Quinn J.C. Johnson-Farley N.N. Yoon J. Cowen D.S. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 303: 746-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Our group previously reported that CaM interacts with the Gi/o-coupled 5-HT1A receptor third intracellular loop at two distinct sites and that the interaction of CaM with those sites may play a role in regulating receptor phosphorylation and desensitization induced by protein kinase C (36Turner J.H. Gelasco A.K. Raymond J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17027-17037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We were interested in establishing whether the Gq/11-coupled 5-HT2A receptor could also interact with CaM, and if so, what consequences this binding might have on receptor function. In the current work, we report that, in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts, CaM co-immunoprecipitates in an agonist-dependent manner with the 5-HT2A receptor. A search of the primary sequence revealed that the 5-HT2A receptor contains two novel CaM-binding motifs, located in the second intracellular loop and the juxtamembrane region of the carboxyl terminus of the receptor. Both motifs contain consensus phosphorylation sites and are important for G protein coupling, indicating that interaction of CaM with those sites could play roles in regulating receptor function. In this report, we sought to characterize the putative CaM-binding sites in the 5-HT2A receptor and to determine their functional significance. Materials—Purified bovine brain calmodulin, biotinylated calmodulin, and purified rat brain PKC were obtained from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against the amino terminus (amino acids 22–41) of the rat 5-HT2A receptor was purchased from Calbiochem. Rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against the carboxyl terminus of the rat 5-HT2A receptor (amino acids 428–443) was kindly provided by Ryan Strachan (Cleveland, OH) and Dr. Bryan Roth (Cleveland, OH). Mouse anti-CaM antibodies were from Upstate Biotechnology (Charlottesville, VA). Dansyl chloride was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR) and [35S]GTPγS was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Synthesis of 5-HT2A Receptor Peptides—Peptides derived from the amino acid sequence of the second intracellular loop (amino acids 183–202, HSRFNSRTKAFLKIIAVWTI) and carboxyl terminus (amino acids 377–396, PLVYTLFNKTYRSAFSRYIQ) of the human 5-HT2A receptor were synthesized using standard solid-phase methods on a Rainin PS3 automated peptide synthesizer by the Medical University of South Carolina Peptide Synthesis Facility. Peptide sizes and purity were verified using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time-of-flight mass spectrometry. When necessary, peptides were purified on a Waters Delta Prep 3000 chromatography system using a C-18 silica column and elution across a linear gradient of acetonitrile in water containing 0.1% (w/v) trifluoroacetic acid (Emory University Microchemical Facility, Atlanta, GA). Cell Culture—NIH-3T3 cells were maintained in minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and penicillin (100 units/ml). Cells were incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2-enriched, humidified atmosphere. 24–48 h before each experiment, cells were switched to serum-free medium containing 0.5% fatty acid free bovine serum albumin (Sigma). Immunoprecipitation—Quiescent NIH-3T3 cell monolayers grown on 100-mm dishes were treated with agonist (1 μm 5-HT) or vehicle for the appropriate time then lysed in 500 μl of modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin). Lysates were homogenized, clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min, then pre-cleared by incubation with protein A/G-agarose for 30 min at 4 °C. Pre-cleared lysates were then incubated with commercial anti-5-HT2A receptor antibody overnight at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were captured by incubation with protein A/G-agarose for 2 h at 4 °C, collected by centrifugation, and washed three times with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and twice with phosphate-buffered saline. Immunoprecipitates were then resuspended in 2× Laemmli sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Gels were analyzed by immunoblot with either anti-CaM antibody or a second anti-5-HT2A receptor antibody. Gel Shift Assays—Gel shift analyses of CaM-peptide complexes were performed using urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, as described by Erickson-Viitanen and Delgrado (41Erickson-Viitanen S. DeGrado W.F. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 139: 455-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Reactions (30 μl of total volume) containing 300 pmol of CaM (∼5 μg) and increasing amounts of peptide (0–3000 pmol) were incubated in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 4 m urea and either 0.1 mm CaCl2 or 1 mm EGTA at 22 °C for 30 min. 15 μl of a 50% glycerol/0.1% bromphenol blue loading buffer was added to each reaction, and the samples were resolved on 14% polyacrylamide gels containing 4 m urea and either 0.1 mm CaCl2 or 1 mm EGTA in the running buffer. Protein was visualized by staining with Gel-code blue (Pierce) staining reagent. Blot Overlay Assays—Peptides (1–100 nmol) were immobilized to PVDF membranes by slot blot and washed twice with 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The membranes were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature, and then were incubated with 0.5 μg/ml biotinylated CaM in the presence of either 0.1 mm CaCl2 or 1 mm EGTA overnight at 4 °C. The PVDF membranes were then washed 3× in the same buffer without CaM, followed by incubation with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated avidin for 1 h at room temperature. Detection was with a chemiluminescent reagent. Fluorometric Measurements with Dansyl-CaM—Dansyl-CaM was synthesized according to the method of Bertrand et al. (42Bertrand B. Wakabayashi S. Ikeda T. Pouyssegur J. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13703-13709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 mg of CaM was incubated with ∼1 mg of dansyl chloride for 1 h at 4 °C. Dansyl-CaM was purified from unincorporated dye using a Centricon™ concentrator with a molecular mass cutoff of 10,000 Da. Measurement of absorbance at 340 nm (molar extinction coefficient, 3,400 m–1 cm–1) gave an incorporation of ∼1.3 dansyl units per CaM molecule. Fluorescence emission spectra of dansyl-CaM were measured from 400–600 nm using a SLM 8000™ C spectrofluorometer (AMINCO-Bowman) with an excitation wavelength of 340 nm. Test peptides (0–2 μm) were incubated with dansyl-CaM in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, supplemented with 0.1 mm CaCl2 for 2 h at room temperature. The concentration of dansyl-CaM (0.1–0.5 μm) was varied, and concentration-response curves were generated for fluorescence enhancement at each dansyl-CaM concentration. The apparent KD values for each concentration of dansyl-CaM were fit to the Hill equation by linear regression to calculate true affinities. In Vitro Kinase Assays—Thirty-five ng (∼0.06 unit) of purified rat brain PKC was incubated with increasing concentrations of ct peptide (0–6 μm) in kinase buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 25 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mg/ml phosphatidylserine, 0.01 mg/ml diacylglycerol, 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP) in a total volume of 25 μl. In some cases, purified bovine brain calmodulin (0–20 μm) was added to reactions. Assays were started by the addition of 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and then incubated at 30 °C for 1 h. Reactions were then transferred to nitrocellulose squares, washed several times with 0.75% phosphoric acid, followed by a final wash with 100% acetone. Bound radioactivity was measured using liquid scintillation counting. Preparation of NIH-3T3/5-HT2A Receptor Cell Membranes—NIH-3T3 cells overexpressing the human 5-HT2A receptor (8 pmol/mg) were kindly provided by Dr. Elaine Sanders-Bush (Nashville, TN). Cells were grown to confluence in 100-mm dishes, incubated in serum-free medium for 16–24 h, scraped into lysis buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 1 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin), then subjected to homogenization by twenty strokes in a Dounce homogenizer. Lysed cells were centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min to remove whole cells and nuclear debris, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 37,000 × g for 20 min. The resulting pellet was washed twice in lysis buffer and resuspended in 50 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.4, 2.5 mm MgCl2 at a final protein concentration of ∼4 mg/ml. Membranes were frozen by immersion in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C for future use. [35S]GTPγS Binding to NIH-3T3/5-HT2A Receptor Cell Membranes— The protocol for measurement of [35S]GTPγS binding to crude cell membranes was adapted from the methods of Cussac et al. (43Cussac D. Newman-Tancredi A. Duqueyroix D. Pasteau V. Millan M.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 578-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and Adlersberg et al. (44Adlersberg M. Arango V. Hsiung S. Mann J.J. Underwood M.D. Liu K. Kassir S.A. Ruggiero D.A. Tamir H. J. Neurosci. Res. 2000; 61: 674-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Briefly, 50-μg aliquots of NIH-3T3/5-HT2A receptor cell membranes were added to 500 μl of assay buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 6 mm MgCl2, 50 μm GDP, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm CaCl2), in the presence or absence of increasing concentrations of i2 or ct peptides, CaM, or S-100 protein, and then incubated for 15 min to allow for GDP loading. Reactions were initiated by the addition of [35S]GTPγS (1250 Ci/mmol) to a final concentration of 200 pm, in the presence or absence of 10 μm 5-HT, and incubated for an additional 1 h at 25 °C. Bound and free nucleotides were then separated by filtration over glass fiber filters, and bound radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. Statistical Analysis—Results shown represent the means ± S.E. of the number of experiments indicated in each case. Statistical analysis was performed by Student's t test. Interaction of CaM with the 5-HT2A Receptor in NIH-3T3 Fibroblasts—Several groups, including ours, have previously shown that CaM plays a role in numerous 5-HT2A receptor signaling pathways, including the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (1Quinn J.C. Johnson-Farley N.N. Yoon J. Cowen D.S. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 303: 746-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and Na+/H+ exchange (26Garnovskaya M.N. Nebigil C.G. Arthur J.M. Spurney R.F. Raymond J.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 230-237PubMed Google Scholar, 45Garnovskaya M.N. Mukhin Y.V. Turner J.H. Vlasova T.M. Ullian M.E. Raymond J.R. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7178-7187Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). As a receptor that couples to Gq/ll type proteins, the 5-HT2A receptor is capable of stimulating phosphoinositide turnover and to subsequently increase intracellular Ca2+ levels. We wondered whether the 5-HT2A receptor might exert some of its Ca2+-sensitive and/or -insensitive intracellular effects by directly interacting with CaM. Other GPCRs, including the D2 dopamine (32El Far O. Bofill-Cardona E. Airas J.M. O'Connor V. Boehm S. Freissmuth M. Nanoff C. Betz H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30662-30669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), μ-opioid receptors (34Wang D. Sadee W. Quillan J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22081-22088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), and 5-HT1A receptor (36Turner J.H. Gelasco A.K. Raymond J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17027-17037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), have been shown to directly interact with CaM through their third intracellular loops. We treated wild-type NIH-3T3 cells and NIH-3T3 cells overexpressing the 5-HT2A receptor, with 1 μm serotonin for 5 min, and immunoprecipitated the receptor with a commercial 5-HT2A receptor antibody. As shown in Fig. 1, a CaM-specific mouse monoclonal antibody detected a band at ∼19 kDa in NIH-3T3–5HT2AR cell immunoprecipitates, which corresponds to the Ca2+-bound form of CaM. This immunoreactive band was only moderately detectable in immunoprecipitates from untreated NIH-3T3/5-HT2AR cells, but was significantly increased in immunoprecipitates from cells treated with 5-HT. A second anti-5-HT2AR antibody detected an immunoreactive band at ∼60 kDa in immunoprecipitates from receptor-expressing NIH-3T3 cells that was unchanged after treatment with 5-HT. No immunoreactive bands were detected with either antibody in immunoprecipitates from wild-type NIH-3T3 cells. These data suggest that the 5-HT2A receptor can complex with CaM in an agonist-dependent manner in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts. Identification of Putative CaM Binding Regions in the 5-HT2A Receptor—NMR studies have shown that CaM binds target peptides via hydrophobic interactions and via salt bridges typically involving glutamate residues in the EF-hand regions (47Meador W.E. Means A.R. Quiocho F.A. Science. 1992; 257: 1251-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar, 48Ikura M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Zhu G. Klee C.B. Bax A. Science. 1992; 256: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (1179) Google Scholar). Predictably, identified CaM binding regions conform to short peptides that form amphipathic α-helices composed of hydrophobic and positively charged amino acid residues (49O'Neil K.T. DeGrado W.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 59-64Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). Using a web-based computer search program, which identifies such regions based on evaluation criteria such as hydropathy, α-helical propensity, residue charge, helical class, residue weight, and hydrophobic residue content (50Yap K.L. Kim J. Truong K. Sherman M. Yuan T. Ikura M. J. Struct. Funct. Genomics. 2000; 1: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar), we identified two putative CaM binding regions in the protein sequence of the 5-HT2A receptor. The illustration in Fig. 2A indicates that the putative CaM-binding domains are localized to the second intracellular loop and the juxtamembrane region of the carboxyl terminus of the receptor. Both regions contain a propensity of hydrophobic and basic amino acids, typical of standard CaM binding regions. Although CaM binding regions do not conform to a linear arrangement of amino acids, several different CaM-binding motifs have been identified based on distances between key hydrophobic residues. The CaM binding region in the second intracellular loop of the 5-HT2A receptor was classified as a 1-8-14 motif, which consists of hydrophobic residues at positions 1, 8, and 14; whereas the putative CaM-binding domain in the carboxyl terminus of the 5-HT2A receptor was classified as a 1-10 motif (Fig. 2B), with key hydrophobic residues separated by eight amino acids. As shown in Fig. 2B, the 5-HT2A receptor CaM binding regions could be aligned with other well defined CaM binding motifs from other proteins. To illustrate the amphipathic nature of the putative CaM-binding sequences of the 5-HT2A receptor, we created helical wheel diagrams using a web-based modeling program (50Yap K.L. Kim J. Truong K. Sherman M. Yuan T. Ikura M. J. Struct. Funct. Genomics. 2000; 1: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). As expected, like most CaM-binding sites, both helical wheels showed clusters of positively charged amino acids on one side of the α-helix, with mostly hydrophobic amino acids concentrated on the opposite side (data not shown). CaM Binds to Peptides Derived from the Second Intracellular Loop and Carboxyl Terminus of the 5-HT2A Receptor—Using synthetic peptides encompassing amino acids 183–202 (i2) and 377–396 (ct) of the 5-HT2A receptor, we tested the ability of either or both regions to interact with CaM with a modified blot overlay technique. Increasing amounts of each peptide (1–100 nmol) were slot-blotted to PVDF membranes and incubated with biotinylated CaM. To separate specific from nonspecific binding, we used a negative control peptide corresponding to the 17-amino acid CaM binding region of myosin light chain kinase, which contains a point mutation that renders it unable to bind CaM. Both the i2 and ct peptide bound biotinylated CaM in buffer containing 0.1 mm Ca2+, whereas the myosin light chain kinase control peptide showed no binding (Fig. 3). Binding was significantly reduced when Ca2+ was removed from the b"

In addition to the two main structural components, epidermis and dermis, one critical apparatus of the skin is a capillary network that guarantees adequate perfusion of nutrients and oxygen. The aim of the present study was to develop an in vitro coculture system that assumed the human dermal-epidermal architecture and included a microcapillary network in a three-dimensional biomaterial that guaranteed ease of handling in a clinical setting. Endothelialized skin (ES) was prepared by coculturing three human cell types: keratinocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells, obtained from human full-thickness skin samples, in scaffolds produced from modified hyaluronic acid. Results were evaluated by histological and immunohistochemical analyses at different time points. In vitro, engineered skin obtained with this composite culture developed into a well-differentiated upper layer of stratified keratinocytes lining a dermal-like structure, in which fibroblasts, extracellular matrix and a microvascular network were present. Furthermore, the biodegradable fabric produced from hyaluronic acid and used as the scaffolding support for this in vitro constructed skin graft greatly facilitated handling in the perioperative period."

Using the three-dimensional model we studied the docking of the substrate, 25-hydroxyvitamin D3, into the substrate binding pocket of CYP27B1. In this study, we focused on the amino acid residues whose point mutations cause vitamin D-dependent rickets type 1, especially unconserved residues among mitochondrial CYPs such as Gln65 and Thr409. Recently, we successfully overexpressed mouse CYP27B1 by using a GroEL/ES co-expression system. In a mutation study of mouse CYP27B1 that included spectroscopic analysis, we concluded that in a 1α-hydroxylation process, Ser408 of mouse CYP27B1 corresponding to Thr409 of human CYP27B1 forms a hydrogen bond with the 25-hydroxyl group of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3.

The mutated amino acid residues seemed to play important roles in the function of 1α-hydroxylase, such as substrate binding, activation of molecular oxygen, interaction with adrenodoxin, and folding of the P450 structure (10Omdahl J.L.

Biochem. 2001; 268: 6607-6615Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To investigate the mutations in depth, spectral analyses including reduced CO-difference spectra and substrate-induced difference spectra are indispensable. However, the expression levels of wild type and CYP27B1 mutants were too low to carry out spectral analyses (11Sawada N. Sakaki T. Kitanaka S. Kato S. Inouye K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 6607-6615Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 12Sawada N. Sakaki T. Kitanaka S. Takeyama K. Kato S. Inouye K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 950-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Thus, enhancement of the expression level of CYP27B1 is essential for structure-function analysis of CYP27B1. Recently, we successfully overexpressed mouse CYP27B1 by using a GroEL/ES co-expression system (13Uchida E. Kagawa N. Sakaki T. Urushino N. Sawada N. Kamakura M. Ohta M. Kato S. Inouye K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 323: 505-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The expression level of CYP27B1 is sufficient for the preparation of large amounts of wild type and CYP27B1 mutants for structural analyses. In addition, we successfully constructed a three-dimensional structure of CYP27B1 by the homology modeling technique using the structure of rabbit microsomal CYP2C5 as a template, which is the first solved x-ray structure as a eukaryotic CYP (14Yamamoto K.

The three-dimensional model of CYP27B1 provided much information about the roles of amino acid residues at the mutated positions seen in VDDR1 patients. In this study, we focused on the mutants from VDDR1 whose mutated amino acids are not conserved among six mitochondorial P450s (Fig. 1). We demonstrate which amino acid residue is responsible for substrate binding by mutation studies that include spectral analysis of CYP27B1.

Construction of Expression Plasmids—The expression plasmid for mouse CYP27B1 with the His tag at the C terminus, pKCHis-m1α, was constructed as described (6Kitanaka S. Takeyama K. Murayama A. Sato T. Okumura K. Nogami M. Hasegawa Y. Niimi H. Yanagisawa J. Tanaka T. Kato S. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 338: 653-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The expression plasmids for CYP27B1 mutants (S408I, S408T, S408V, S408A, Q65H, Q65E, Q65A, Q65L, Q65N) were generated by the QuikChange™ Site-directed Mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (Amsterdam, the Netherlands) according to the instruction manual. The oligonucleotide primers for mutagenesis are shown in Table I. Corrected generation of the desired mutations was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Cultivation of the Recombinant E. coli Cells—The E. coli DH5α harboring pGro12 was transformed with the expression plasmid for wild type CYP27B1 (pKCHis-m1α) or its mutants. Recombinant E. coli cells were grown in TB media (pH 7.0) containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 25 μg/ml kanamycin at 26 °C under good aeration for 24 h. The induction of transcription of CYP27B1 cDNA and the GroEL/ES gene was initiated by addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and arabinose at a final concentration of 1 mm and 4 mg/ml, respectively. δ-Aminolevulinic acid was also added at a final concentration of 1 mm. Solubilization of Wild Type and CYP27B1 Mutants by CHAPS—The recombinant E. coli cells were suspended in 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 1% CHAPS, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 20% glycerol, and disrupted by sonication for 15 min at 4 °C. Cell debris was removed at 1,200 × g for 10 min. Then the supernatant was ultracentrifugated at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The resultant supernatant was used for spectral and enzymatic analyses. Measurement of Reduced CO-difference Spectra—Reduced CO-difference spectra were measured by a Shimadzu UV-2200 spectrophotometer (Kyoto, Japan) as described previously (16Kondo S. Sakaki T. Ohkawa H. Inouye K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 273-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The concentration of CYP27B1 was determined from the reduced CO-difference spectrum using a difference of extinction coefficient at 446 and 490 nm of 91 mm-1 cm-1 by Omura and Sato (17Omura T. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 118: 397-404Google Scholar). Measurement of Substrate-induced Difference Spectra—Substrate-induced difference spectra of wild type and CYP27B1 mutants were measured in the presence of 1.0 μm 25-(OH)D3 by a Shimadzu UV-2200 spectrophotometer (Kyoto, Japan). Western Blot Analysis of Gln65 Mutants—Anti-CYP27B1 antiserum was prepared using a purified sample of mouse CYP27B1 as antigen (13Uchida E. Kagawa N. Sakaki T. Urushino N. Sawada N. Kamakura M. Ohta M. Kato S. Inouye K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 323: 505-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The purified CYP27B1 (0.1 mg) was mixed with an equal volume of Freund's complete adjuvant and injected intradermally into a young male Japan White rabbit. At 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks after the first injection, the rabbit was boosted with additional injections of 0.1 or 0.2 mg each of the antigen mixed with Freund's incomplete adjuvant. The rabbit was bled 1 week after the final injection, and antiserum was prepared. The solubilized fractions of wild type and CYP27B1 mutants containing 0.6 μg of protein were subjected to electrophoresis on 5-20% linear gradient polyacrylamide sodium dodecyl sulfate gels, and transferred electrophoretically from the gel to poly(vinylidene difluoride) membrane. The membrane was probed with the anti-CYP27B1 antiserum mentioned above, and then reacted with horseradish peroxidase-labeled rabbit IgG. The immobilized proteins were detected by treating the membrane with a mixture of 4-chloro-1-naphtol and hydrogen peroxide. Measurement of Hydroxylation Activity Toward 25-(OH)D3, 1α-(OH)D3, and Vitamin D3—The 1α-hydroxylation activity toward 25-(OH)D3 was measured in a reconstituted system consisting of the solubilized CYP27B1 or each of its mutants (0.5-6.0 nm), 2.0 μm adrenodoxin, 0.2 μm NADPH-adrenodoxin reductase, 0.025-1.0 μm substrate, 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 0.2% glycerol, and 0.1% CHAPS in a final volume of 0.5 ml. The 25-hydroxylation activity toward 1α-(OH)D3 was measured in a similar manner except for the concentrations of 1α-(OH)D3 (0.05-1.0 μm) and CYP27B1 (2.5 nm) or S408V (50 nm). The vitamin D3 metabolism was measured in a reconstituted system consisting of 2.0 μm adrenodoxin, 0.2 μm NADPH-adrenodoxin reductase, 46 nm of the purified sample of the wild type (13Uchida E. Kagawa N. Sakaki T. Urushino N. Sawada N. Kamakura M. Ohta M. Kato S. Inouye K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 323: 505-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), or 50 nm of the purified sample of S408V, 1.0 μm vitamin D3, 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 0.2% glycerol, and 0.1% CHAPS. The concentration of CHAPS was determined on the basis of our previous study (13Uchida E. Kagawa N. Sakaki T. Urushino N. Sawada N. Kamakura M. Ohta M. Kato S. Inouye K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 323: 505-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). After incubation at 37 °C for 3 min, the reaction was initiated by adding NADPH at a final concentration of 1 mm. The reaction was terminated by adding 2 ml of chloroform/methanol (3:1, v/v). After extraction, the organic phase was recovered and dried. The resulting residue was solubilized with acetonitrile and applied to HPLC under the following conditions: column, YMC-Pack ODS-AM (4.6 × 300 mm) (YMC Co., Tokyo, Japan); column temperature, 40 °C; mobile phase, linear gradient of 70-100% acetonitrile aqueous solution per 15 min; flow rate, 1.0 ml/min; UV detection, 265 nm. The kinetic parameters, Km and kcat, were calculated by the nonlinear regression analysis using the KaleidaGraph (Synergy software). Other Methods—The concentrations of vitamin D3 derivatives were estimated by their molar extinction coefficient of 1.80 × 104 m-1 cm-1 at 264 nm (18Hiwatashi A. Nishi Y. Ichikawa Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 105: 320-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Total protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Mouse CYP27B1, human CYP27B1, and rabbit CYP2C5 were aligned by using ClustalW interfaced with Clustal X (version 1.81) for Windows. Docking of 25-(OH)D3 into CYP27B1—The three-dimensional structure of CYP27B1, which was constructed and reported in our previous paper (14Yamamoto K. Masuno H. Sawada N. Sakaki T. Inouye K. Ishiguro M. Yamada S. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2004; 89-90: 167-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), gave abundant insights in regards to the function of each residue. We are greatly interested in how the CYP27B1 recognizes 25-(OH)D3 and binds it as a substrate. We noted amino acid residues whose point mutant cause VDDR1 (Fig. 1). Fig. 1 shows comparison of the residues of CYP27B1 with other human mitochondrial CYPs at the mutated positions seen in patients with VDDR1. Residues conserved in these CYPs are thought to be responsible for common roles among mitochondrial CYPs, whereas residues not conserved are thought to be involved in specific roles of each enzyme such as substrate binding. Thus, we focused on mutants Q65H, P143L, E189L, S323Y, T409I, and R429P. The three-dimensional structure of CYP27B1 demonstrated that P143L, E189L, S323Y, and R429P are responsible for protein folding as previously reported (14Yamamoto K. Masuno H. Sawada N. Sakaki T. Inouye K. Ishiguro M. Yamada S. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2004; 89-90: 167-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2a). On the other hand, Gln65 and Thr409 are lining the end of broad cavity above heme in the three-dimensional model of CYP27B1 (Fig. 2a). In the docking study of 25-(OH)D3 into the pocket, it is important to determine the substrate binding site and the conformation of 25-(OH)D3. Considering the importance of Gln65 and Thr409 whose mutations cause VDDR1, we selected the substrate binding site where 25-(OH)D3 can form the hydrogen bond between the 25-OH group and Gln65 and/or Thr409. We docked 25-(OH)D3 as follows: 1) the A-ring of 25-(OH)D3 was superimposed on 1R-camphor accommodated in the substrate binding pocket of the P450cam protein (Protein Data Bank code 1DZ4) (19Schlichting I. Berendzen J. Chu K. Stock A.M. Maves S.A. Benson D.E. Sweet R.M. Ringe D. Petsko G.A. Sligar S.G. Science. 2000; 287: 1615-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (1219) Google Scholar), because, structurally and biologically, the best characterized P450 is P450cam and we analyzed the docking modes of camphor into P450cam and found the modes being approximately conserved. In addition, P450cam belongs to the class 1 enzyme in the P450 superfamily as well as mitochondrial CYPs. 2) The side chain of 25-(OH)D3 was positioned near Gln65 and Thr409. 3) Spatial location of 25-(OH)D3 was manually adjusted so as to minimize the van der Waals bump between the substrate vitamin and the amino acid residues lining the substrate binding pocket. The resulting structure of CYP27B1 and 25-(OH)D3 complex is shown in Fig. 2a. The distances between the 25-hydroxyl group and Gln65 and the 25-hydroxyl group and Thr409 are 2.83 and 2.82 Å, respectively. This suggests that the 25-hydroxyl group forms pincer-type hydrogen bonds with Gln65 and Thr409. The 1α-hydrogen of 25-(OH)D3, which will be subjected to hydroxylation, orients to the iron atom as a constituent of heme in the CYP (Fig. 2b). Conformation of 25-(OH)D3 Accommodated in CYP27B1—As shown in Fig. 2c, 25-(OH)D3 is docked with a stable conformation in which the A-ring adopts the chair form and the side chain adopts the gauche(+) conformation (43°) at C(16-17-20-22) and the following anti-conformation from C(20) to the terminal methyl group. A-ring adopts β-form. In this conformation, the distance between C(1) and iron is 4.3 Å and between hydrogen at the 1α-position and iron is 3.3 Å (Fig. 2b), which are consistent with the distances observed in the crystal structures: C(5)-iron (4.2 Å) and H(5)-iron (3.2 Å) in the camphor-P450cam complex (1DZ4) (19Schlichting I. Berendzen J. Chu K. Stock A.M. Maves S.A. Benson D.E. Sweet R.M. Ringe D. Petsko G.A. Sligar S.G. Science. 2000; 287: 1615-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (1219) Google Scholar); C(5)-iron (3.9 Å) and H(5)-iron (3.3 Å) in the camphor-P450cam complex (1AKD) (20Schlichting I. Jung C. Schulze H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 415: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar); C(1)-iron (3.8 Å) and H(1)-iron (2.9 Å) in the androstenedione-P450eryF complex (1EUP) (21Cupp-Vickery J. Anderson R. Hatziris Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3050-3055Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). If the A-ring of 25-(OH)D3 adopts the α-form, distances of C(1)-iron and C(2)-iron are 3.9 and 3.8 Å, respectively, resulting in the absence of a rational explanation for the selective hydroxylation that occurred at the 1α-position but not the 2-position. Thus, our docking model well explains the stereospecific hydroxylation at the 1α-position of 25-(OH)D3. Expression of Wild Type and CYP27B1 Mutants with GroEL/ES Co-expression System—Molecular modeling study of CYP27B1 strongly suggests that Ser408 of mouse CYP27B1 corresponding to Thr409 of human CYP27B1, and/or Gln65 are involved in substrate binding (Fig. 3). To reveal each function of the mutated amino acid residues, we generated multiple forms of CYP27B1 mutants at positions 408 (409 in human CYP27B1) and 65. As shown in Fig. 4, mutant S408I showed the reduced CO-difference spectra similar to wild type. S408T and S408A, and S408V, also showed similar spectra (data not shown). The expression level of the wild type of CYP27B1 was 200-300 nmol/liter of culture, as described previously (13Uchida E. Kagawa N. Sakaki T. Urushino N. Sawada N. Kamakura M. Ohta M. Kato S. Inouye K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 323: 505-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The expression levels of Ser408 mutants, S408I and S408A, were nearly the same as the wild type, whereas those of S408T and S408V were higher (400-450 nmol/liter of culture). On the other hand, the expression levels of Gln65 mutants (Q65H, Q65E, Q65A, Q65L, Q65N) were too low to be determined by the reduced CO-difference spectra. However, Q65E showed a substrate-induced difference spectrum. Thus, the expression level of the Q65E hemoprotein was estimated to be 10 nmol/liter based on the assumption that Q65E shows a substrate-induced difference spectrum similar to wild type. In contrast, Western blot analysis showed that the distinct bands reacted with anti-CYP27B1 antiserum in the Gln65 mutants. The expression levels of the Gln65 mutants were not so different from that of the wild type (Fig. 5). These results suggest that most Gln65 mutants are expressed as apoproteins without a heme molecule in E. coli cells.Fig. 4Reduced CO-difference spectra of wild type mouse CYP27B1 (—), and the mutant S408I (- - -).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 5Western blot analysis of wild type and Gln65 mutants of mouse CYP27B1.

The magnitude of ΔA390-420 in S408T was slightly larger than the wild type of CYP27B1. In contrast, the magnitude of ΔA390-420 in S408V and S408A was quite small, but S408I showed no detectable spectral change. These results suggest that the substrate, 25-(OH)D3, can remove the H2O molecule as the sixth axial ligand of the heme iron of wild type CYP27B1 and mutant S408T. In addition, the hydroxyl group at the side chain of the amino acid at position 408 appears to be essential for removal of the H2O molecule. It should be noted that S408I corresponding to T409I from patients with VDDR1 cannot remove the H2O molecule by 25-(OH)D3. Analysis of 1α-Hydroxylation Activity of Wild Type and CYP27B1 Mutants toward 25-(OH)D3—The 1α-hydroxylation activity toward 25-(OH)D3 was examined using solubilized CYP27B1 by CHAPS as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Table II, kinetic parameters, Km and kcat, of the wild type CYP27B1 were estimated to be 0.28 μm and 23.1 min-1, respectively. The kcat and Km values of S408T were significantly lower than those of the wild type CYP27B1. However, S408T appeared to have enough activity as a 1α-hydroxylase for 25-(OH)D3 based on its kcat/Km value. On the other hand, S408A and S408V showed much smaller kcat values than the wild type. As expected by spectral analysis, S408I showed the smallest activity among the mutants. Note that S408A, S408V, and S408I showed Km values not so different from the wild type.Table IIKinetic parameters of wild type and CYP27B1 mutants for 25(OH)D3 1α-hydroxylation activityCYP27B1kcatKmkcat/Kmmin−1μmWild type23.1 ± 0.90.28 ± 0.0684 ± 19S408T5.9 ± 1.60.13 ± 0.0346 ± 11S408A0.34 ± 0.060.24 ± 0.041.5 ± 0.3S408V0.78 ± 0.400.54 ± 0.181.5 ± 0.7S408I0.050 ± 0.0200.18 ± 0.060.31 ± 0.10 Open table in a new tab In the same way, 1α-hydroxylation activity toward 25-(OH)D3 of Gln65 mutants was measured. Mutant Q65E showed only a small activity, although other Gln65 mutants showed no detectable activity. The Km value of Q65E was estimated to be 0.80 μm, which is considerably higher than those of Ser408 mutants (Table II). Because the concentration of Q65E hemoprotein was not determined from reduced CO-difference spectrum probably because of its unstability, the kcat value was not determined. On the assumption that Q65E shows a substrate-induced difference spectrum similar to wild type, kcat was estimated to be 0.55 min-1. Analysis of 1α-(OH)D3 25-Hydroxylation Activity of the Wild Type and S408V—We consider that the mutant T409I of human CYP27B1 corresponds to S408I of mouse CYP27B1. However, it might be possible that the conversion of Thr to Ile corresponds to the conversion of Ser to Val, judging from their chemical structure. Thus, enzymatic properties of S408V were compared with those of the wild type. As shown in Table III, the kinetic parameters, Km and kcat, of the wild type for 1α-(OH)D3 25-hydroxylation was estimated to be 0.52 μm and 0.60 min-1, respectively. Thus, the kcat/Km value was only 1.3% 1α-(OH)D3 25-hydroxylation. Ser408 showed a similar Km value but a much smaller kcat value than wild type. These results are quite similar to those for 25-(OH)D3 1α-hydroxylation, suggesting that Ser408 is involved in the binding of not only 25-(OH)D3 but also 1α-(OH)D3.Table IIIKinetic parameters of wild type and mutant S408V for 1α(OH)D3 25-hydroxylation activityCYP27B1kcatKmkcat/Kmmin−1μmWild type0.60 ± 0.120.52 ± 0.051.1 ± 0.1S408V0.022 ± 0.0100.66 ± 0.090.033 ± 0.009 Open table in a new tab Vitamin D3 Metabolism by the Wild Type and S408V—Fig. 7 shows the HPLC profiles of vitamin D3 by wild type CYP27B1 and S408V. Both 1α-(OH)D3 and 1-α,25(OH)2D3 were detected in the metabolism by the wild type. However, 25-(OH)D3 was not detected as reported previously (13Uchida E. Kagawa N. Sakaki T. Urushino N. Sawada N. Kamakura M. Ohta M. Kato S. Inouye K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 323: 505-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). On the other hand, S408V showed a clear peak of 25-(OH)D3 in addition to those of 1α-(OH)D3 and 1α,25-(OH)2D3. LC-MS analysis confirmed that this metabolite is 25-(OH)D3 (data not shown). It is possible to assume that 25-(OH)D3 is not detected as an intermediate because of its rapid conversion to 1α,25-(OH)2D3 by the wild type CYP27B1, but 25-(OH)D3 is detected because of its slow conversion by S408V. Fig. 8 shows the time courses of vitamin D3 metabolism. In the metabolism of wild type CYP27B1, 1α-(OH)D3 increased up to 10 min and thereafter reached plateau, whereas 1α,25-(OH)2D3 continued increasing. On the other hand, 25-(OH)D3 was not detected as described previously (13Uchida E. Kagawa N. Sakaki T. Urushino N. Sawada N. Kamakura M. Ohta M. Kato S. Inouye K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 323: 505-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In contrast, 25-(OH)D3 was detected as a metabolite of vitamin D3 by S408V. As shown in Fig. 7, 25-(OH)D3 increased up to 10 min and thereafter reached plateau, whereas 1α-(OH)D3 continued increasing. On the other hand, 1α,25-(OH)2D3 appeared at 10 min, and then the rate of 1α,25-(OH)2D3 formation increased with increasing time. Vitamin D3 metabolism together with 25-(OH)D3 1α-hydroxylation and 1α-(OH)D3 25-hydroxylation by S408V strongly indicated that S408V has a dual pathway to produce 1α,25-(OH)2D3 from vitamin D3 as shown in Fig. 9. Although 25-(OH)D3 was not detected in the wild type-dependent metabolism of vitamin D3, it is possible that the wild type has a dual pathway as well as S408V.Fig. 8Time courses of vitamin D3 metabolism by wild type (A) and S408V (B).

Biochem. 1999; 265: 950-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) showed 1α-hydroxylase activity toward 25-(OH)D3. Thus, the mutated amino acid residues seemed to play important roles in the function of 1α-hydroxylase. Our previous study (11Sawada N. Sakaki T. Kitanaka S. Kato S. Inouye K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 6607-6615Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) suggested that Arg107, Gly125, and Pro497 destroyed the tertiary structure of the substrate-heme pocket. It was also suggested that Arg389 and Arg453 of CYP27B1 were involved in heme-propionate binding and that Asp164 stabilized the 4-helix bundle consisting of D, E, I, and J helices, possibly by forming a salt bridge. Thr321 was found to be responsible for the activation of molecular oxygen. As shown in Fig. 1, amino acid residues at positions 65, 143, 189, 323, 409, and 429 of human CYP27B1 were not conserved among mitochondorial P450s. Of these mutations, P143L, E189G(K,L), and R429P are assumed to disrupt protein folding because Pro and Gly residues are known to be helix breakers. In addition, S323Y in the I helix appears to play an important role in protein folding because the side chain of the amino acid residue at position 323 is oriented to the opposite side of a heme molecule, buried inside the protein structure (14Yamamoto K. Masuno H. Sawada N. Sakaki T. Inouye K. Ishiguro M. Yamada S. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2004; 89-90: 167-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure model of CYP27B1 implied that Gln65 and/or Thr409 interacts with 25-(OH)D3, probably by forming a hydrogen bond with the 25-hydroxyl group of the substrate. We have not successfully overexpressed human CYP27B1 yet, but we have successfully overexpressed mouse CYP27B1 by using a GroEL/ES co-expression system. Thus, we generated mouse CYP27B1 mutants for Gln65 and Ser408, corresponding to Thr409 of human CYP27B1. The substitution of Ser408 to Thr did not cause significant alterations in substrate binding and 1α-hydroxylation activity toward 25-(OH)D3. However, the substitutions to Ala, Val, and Ile dramatically decreased 1α-hydroxylation activity and changed the substrate binding manner. Judging from the Km values of S408A, S408V, and S408I, these mutants have significant affinity for 25-(OH)D3. However, based on their substrate-induced manner, their binding mode of the substrate appears unsuitable for displacement of H2O as the distal ligand. Because the displacement of the H2O molecule by the substrate is essential for P450 reactions, good correlation between the magnitude of ΔA390-420 in Fig. 5 and kcat value in Table II is quite reasonable. Note that S408V has much lower activity than S408T. The difference in the side chain of Val from Thr is the difference between a methyl and a hydroxyl group. Thus, the hydroxyl group is responsible for substrate binding for the P450 reaction. It is possible to assume that the hydroxyl group of Ser408 of mouse CYP27B1 or Thr409 of human CYP27B1 interacts with the 25-OH group of the substrate through a hydrogen bond. The high affinity of S408A, S408V, and S408I for 25-(OH)D3 may suggest that another amino acid residue takes the place of Ser408 through a hydrogen bond with the substrate. It is noted that not only 25-(OH)D3 1α-hydroxylation but also 1α-(OH)D3 25-hydroxylation by S408V was much less than those of the wild type CYP27B1. These results suggest that the hydroxyl group of Ser408 of mouse CYP27B1 is involved in substrate binding of both substrates. Note that the substrate is fixed in the opposite direction in the substrate binding pocket of CYP27B1 between 1α- and 25-hydroxylations. Thus, it appears that the hydroxyl group of Ser408 interacts with the 1α-hydroxyl group of 1α-(OH)D3. On the other hand, 1α-hydroxylation and 25-hydroxylation activities of S408V toward vitamin D3 appear to be similar to those of the wild type, based on the time courses of the metabolites shown in Fig. 7. These results are consistent with the fact that vitamin D3 has no hydroxyl groups at positions C-1α and C-25 to interact with the hydroxyl group of the amino acid at position 408. The significantly higher Km and lower kcat values of Q65E than the wild type are consistent with an involvement of Gln65 in binding of the substrate. However, Western blot and spectral analyses of Gln65 mutants indicated that most Gln mutants were expressed as apoproteins without heme molecules, whereas Q65E showed a small amount of hemoprotein and the activity. These results strongly suggest that Gln65 is involved in protein folding. In this study, we revealed that Ser408 and Gln65 play important roles in substrate binding and the folding of mouse CYP27B1, respectively. The reasons why mutations T409I and Q65H of human CYP27B1 cause VDDR1 were also clearly understood. It is noteworthy that the predictions derived from the three-dimensional model showed good agreement with the experimental data. Thus, this three-dimensional model gives essential information on the structure-function relationship of CYP27B1."

A large body of research has defined the primary role of this acidic motif as a specific recognition site for enteropeptidase, the physiological activator of trypsinogen. In addition, the acidic stretch was shown to contribute to the suppression of autoactivation. In the present study, we determined the relative importance of these two activation peptide functions in human cationic trypsinogen. Individual Ala replacements of Asp19-22 had minimal or no effect on trypsinogen activation catalyzed by human enteropeptidase. Strikingly, a tetra-Ala19-22 trypsinogen mutant devoid of acidic residues in the activation peptide was still a highly specific substrate for human, but not for bovine, enteropeptidase. In contrast, an intact Asp19-22 motif was critical for autoactivation control. Thus, single Ala mutations of Asp19, Asp20 and Asp21 resulted in 2-3-fold increased autoactivation, whereas the Asp22 → Ala mutant autoactivated at a 66-fold increased rate. These effects were multiplicative in the tri-Ala19-21 and tetra-Ala19-22 mutants. Structural modeling revealed that the conserved hydrophobic S2 subsite of trypsin and the unique Asp218, which forms part of the S3-S4 subsite, participate in distinct inhibitory interactions with the activation peptide. Finally, mutagenesis studies confirmed the significance of the negative charge of Asp218 in autoactivation control. The results demonstrate that in human cationic trypsinogen the Asp19-22 motif per se is not required for enteropeptidase recognition, whereas it is essential for maximal suppression of autoactivation. The evolutionary selection of Asp218, which is absent in the large majority of vertebrate trypsins, provides an additional mechanism of autoactivation control in the human pancreas.

The evolutionary selection of Asp218, which is absent in the large majority of vertebrate trypsins, provides an additional mechanism of autoactivation control in the human pancreas. Digestive trypsins are synthesized and secreted by the pancreas as inactive precursors. Physiological activation of trypsinogen takes place in the duodenum, where enteropeptidase (enterokinase) specifically cleaves the Lys23-Ile24 peptide bond (see Refs. 1Light A. Janska H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1989; 14: 110-112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 2Lu D. Sadler J.E. Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D. Woessner J.F. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes.

The activating cleavage removes a typically 8-amino acid-long activation peptide. In vertebrate trypsinogens, the activation peptide contains a highly conserved tetra-aspartate sequence next to the scissile peptide bond (Fig. 1). Experiments with synthetic peptides and protein substrates indicated that the acidic residues are required for enteropeptidase recognition and cleavage (1Light A. Janska H. Trends Biochem.

Due to its highly specific extended subsite interactions, in analogy to restriction endonucleases, enteropeptidase became known as a restriction protease, and the Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys recognition site has been widely utilized as a protein engineering tool for the specific cleavage of fusion proteins. Definitive evidence that the Asp19-22 motif of the activation peptide participates in essential subsite interactions with enteropeptidase came from the crystal structure of the bovine enteropeptidase catalytic subunit complexed with an inhibitor analog of the activation peptide, Val-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys-chloromethane (8Lu D. Futterer K. Korolev S. Zheng X. Tan K. Waksman G. Sadler J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 361-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The structure demonstrated that the P2 and P4 Asp residues (corresponding to Asp22 and Asp20 in Fig. 1) formed salt bridges with Lys99 (chymo#), a unique basic exosite on the catalytic subunit of enteropeptidase. In addition, the P3 Asp (Asp21 in Fig. 1) was hydrogen-bonded to the hydroxyl group of Tyr174 (chymo#). The P5 Asp (Asp19 in Fig. 1) was disordered in the structure. In accordance with structural predictions, mutation of Lys99 in the catalytic subunit of enteropeptidase abolished trypsinogen activation. Although the crystal structure suggested an important role for at least 3 of the 4 Asp residues in enteropeptidase recognition, a number of studies using various protein substrates or synthetic peptides indicated that a minimal recognition sequence for enteropeptidase consists of a Lys/Arg at P1 and an Asp/Glu at P2, whereas the P3-P5 acidic residues might enhance activity (1Light A.

Consistent with the critical role of the P2 Asp was the recent observation that the D22G mutant of human cationic trypsinogen was resistant to activation by bovine enteropeptidase (9Chen J.M. Kukor Z. Le Maréchal C. TÓth M. Tsakiris L. Raguénès O. Férec C. Sahin-TÓth M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2003; 20: 1767-1777Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The inhibitory function of the trypsinogen activation peptide on trypsin-mediated trypsinogen activation (autoactivation) was first demonstrated by chemical modification of the Asp residues in the activation peptide, which greatly enhanced autoactivation (10Radhakrishnan T.M. Walsh K.A. Neurath H. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 4020-4027Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Subsequently, tryptic digestion of synthetic model peptides indicated that Asp residues are not favored in the P2-P5 positions (11Delaage M. Desnuelle P. Lazdunski M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 29: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 12Abita J.P. Delaage M. Lazdunski M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1969; 8: 314-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). More recently, biochemical characterization of pancreatitis-associated activation peptide mutations in human cationic trypsinogen confirmed the importance of Asp residues in the activation peptide in autoactivation control. A model peptide with the D22G mutation was cleaved by bovine trypsin at a higher rate compared with the wild type activation peptide (13Teich N. Ockenga J. Hoffmeister A. Manns M. Mössner J. Keim V. Gastroenterology. 2000; 119: 461-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), and recombinant human trypsinogens carrying the D19A or D22G mutations exhibited markedly increased autoactivation (9Chen J.M. Kukor Z. Le Maréchal C. TÓth M. Tsakiris L. Raguénès O. Férec C. Sahin-TÓth M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2003; 20: 1767-1777Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Taken together with previous data, these findings indicated that the tetra-Asp sequence in the mammalian trypsinogen activation peptides has evolved for both efficient inhibition of trypsinogen autoactivation within the pancreas and optimal enteropeptidase recognition in the duodenum. However, to provide further experimental support to this notion, quantitative comparison of enteropeptidase- and trypsin-mediated trypsinogen activation, combined with systematic mutagenesis of the trypsinogen activation peptide, was necessary. In the present study, the role of the Asp19-22 motif in the dual functionality of the activation peptide was investigated by site-directed mutagenesis in human cationic trypsinogen. This human trypsinogen isoform exhibits an unusually high propensity for autoactivation, to the extent that inborn mutations that moderately increase autoactivation cause hereditary pancreatitis (14Whitcomb D.C.

Our findings demonstrate that the primary function of the tetra-Asp sequence in the activation peptide of human cationic trypsinogen is suppression of autoactivation. Two inhibitory interactions have been identified: one between Asp22 of trypsinogen and the conserved hydrophobic S2 subsite of trypsin and another between the unique Asp218 exosite and Asp19-21 of the activation peptide. Together, these interactions can suppress the rate of autoactivation by more than 2 orders of magnitude. In contrast, the Asp19-22 sequence is not required for enteropeptidase recognition and confers only a modest catalytic improvement to enteropeptidase-mediated trypsinogen activation in humans. Materials—N-Benzyloxycarbonyl-Gly-Pro-Arg-p-nitroanilide was from Sigma, and ultrapure bovine enterokinase was from Biozyme Laboratories (San Diego, CA). Recombinant human proenteropeptidase was from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Human proenteropeptidase (0.07 mg/ml stock solution; 641 nm concentration) was activated with 50 nm human cationic trypsin in 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm CaCl2, and 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (final concentrations) for 30 min at room temperature and diluted 10-fold to obtain a working stock solution of 64 nm enteropeptidase concentration in 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm CaCl2, and 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The inclusion of bovine serum albumin was essential for the long term stability of enteropeptidase. Soybean trypsin inhibitor was purchased from Fluka and purified to homogeneity on a bovine trypsin affinity column followed by MonoQ ion exchange chromatography. Nomenclature—The common names “cationic trypsinogen” and “anionic trypsinogen” are used to denote the two major human trypsinogen isoforms (19Chen J.M. Férec C. Cooper D.N. Nature Encyclopedia of the Human Genome. Macmillan, London, UK2003: 645-650Google Scholar). Note that these names reflect only the relative isoelectric points of the proenzymes, and, in fact, all human trypsinogens are anionic. Autoactivation of trypsinogen is a bimolecular self-amplifying process in which trypsin activates trypsinogen to trypsin (trypsin + trypsinogen → 2trypsin). The term “autoactivation” is used throughout this study to describe trypsin-mediated trypsinogen activation. Amino acid residues in the human trypsinogen sequences are denoted according to their actual position in the native, wild-type preproenzyme, starting with Met1. Where indicated by the “chymo#” prefix, the chymotrypsin-based conventional numbering is also used. Expression Plasmids and Mutagenesis—Construction of expression plasmids harboring the human cationic (protease, serine, 1 gene; PRSS1) and anionic (PRSS2) trypsinogen genes was described previously (16Sahin-TÓth M.

Single or combined mutations D20A, D21A, D22A, D19E, D20E, D21E, D22E, A3D (D19A/D20A/D21A), A4 (D19A/D20A/D21A/D22A), D218Y, D218H, D218S, D218E, and S200A in the PRSS1 gene and mutation Y218D in the PRSS2 gene were introduced by oligonucleotide-directed site-specific PCR mutagenesis. Mutant D19A was constructed previously (9Chen J.M. Kukor Z. Le Maréchal C. TÓth M. Tsakiris L. Raguénès O. Férec C. Sahin-TÓth M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2003; 20: 1767-1777Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The PCR products were digested with restriction endonucleases XhoI and SacI (D218Y, D218H, D218S, D218E, Y218D, and S200A) or with NcoI and EcoRI (D20A, D21A, D22A, D19E, D20E, D21E and D22E) and ligated into the similarly treated expression plasmids. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Trypsinogens—Trypsinogen mutants were expressed in the E. coli Rosetta (DE3) strain as cytoplasmic inclusion bodies. Trypsinogen was solubilized in guanidine HCl, renatured in vitro, and purified to homogeneity using ecotin affinity chromatography, as reported previously (16Sahin-TÓth M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22750-22755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Trypsinogen preparations were stored on ice, in 50 mm HCl. Concentrations of cationic and anionic trypsinogen solutions were calculated from their UV absorbance at 280 nm, using theoretical extinction coefficients of 36,160, 37,440, 37,320, and 36,040 m-1 cm-1 for wild-type cationic trypsinogen, D218Y cationic trypsinogen mutant, wild-type anionic trypsinogen, and Y218D anionic trypsinogen mutant, respectively. The molecular masses of recombinant cationic and anionic trypsinogens were 25,149.3 and 25,077 Da, respectively. Autoactivation Assays—Trypsinogen in 50 mm HCl was diluted to a 2 μm final concentration in the appropriate buffer, and the HCl was neutralized with NaOH, resulting in a 15 mm NaCl concentration. Buffers were used at 0.1 m final concentration, sodium acetate at pH 4.0 and pH 5.0, Na-MES at pH 6.0, Na-HEPES at pH 7.0, and Tris-HCl at pH 8.0. As inert protein, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin was included in the autoactivation mixtures. The albumin was extensively dialyzed against distilled water before use. Because commercial albumin preparations slightly inhibit human anionic trypsin, but not cationic trypsin (20Kukor Z. TÓth M. Sahin-TÓth M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 2047-2058Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), in the autoactivation experiments with anionic trypsinogen, bovine serum albumin was omitted. Autoactivation reactions were initiated by the addition of 10 nm trypsin (final concentration), and reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2 (wild-type and mutant cationic trypsinogens) or 10 mm CaCl2 (wild-type and mutant anionic trypsinogens). These Ca2+ concentrations were previously found optimal for autoactivation of the two trypsinogen isoforms (20Kukor Z. TÓth M. Sahin-TÓth M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 2047-2058Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). At given times, 2-μl aliquots were removed for trypsin activity assay. Trypsin activity was determined using the synthetic chromogenic substrate, N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Gly-Pro-Arg-p-nitroanilide (0.14 mm final concentration) in a 200-μl volume. One-minute time courses of p-nitroaniline release were followed at 405 nm in 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm CaCl2, at room temperature using a Spectramax Plus 384 microplate reader (Molecular Devices).

Biochem. 1983; 130: 134-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar, 22Zimmerle C.T. Frieden C. Biochem. J. 1989; 258: 381-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) was used to estimate the second-order rate constant of the “trypsin + trypsinogen → 2trypsin” reaction (see discussion in Ref. 23Wu J.-W. Wu Y. Wang Z.-X. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1547-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Initial rates were then obtained by multiplying the rate constant with the initial concentrations of the reactants (i.e. 10 nm trypsin and 2000 nm trypsinogen), and rates were expressed as nm trypsin generated per min (nm/min). Under the conditions used in this study, degradation of cationic trypsin(ogen) during autoactivation was minimal, and this side reaction was ignored in the calculations. Autoactivation of the less stable anionic trypsinogen was always measured in the presence of 10 mm Ca2+, which provides sufficient protection against autolysis (20Kukor Z. TÓth M. Sahin-TÓth M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 2047-2058Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Activation of S200A Trypsinogen Mutants—Trypsinogens (2 μm concentration) carrying the S200A mutation were activated with 10 nm human cationic trypsin, 50 ng/ml (0.45 nm) bovine enteropeptidase, or 14 ng/ml (0.13 nm) human enteropeptidase at 37 °C in 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 1 mm CaCl2 (final concentrations). To eliminate the effect of potential trypsin contamination, the enteropeptidase activation reactions were carried out in the presence of 0.12 μm soybean trypsin inhibitor (final concentration), unless indicated otherwise. Aliquots were withdrawn from the activation mixtures, and trypsinogen was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid (10% final concentration). The precipitate was recovered by centrifugation and dissolved in Laemmli sample buffer containing 100 mm dithiothreitol (final concentration), and samples were heat-denatured at 95 °C for 5 min. Electrophoretic separation was performed on 13% SDS-polyacrylamide minigels in standard Tris-glycine buffer. For the A3D/S200A and A4/S200A mutants, the conventional 13% reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel did not resolve trypsinogen from trypsin; therefore, 21% gels and nonreducing conditions were used for separation. Gels were stained with Brilliant Blue R for 30 min; destained with 30% methanol, 10% acetic acid; and dried. Densitometric quantitation of bands was carried out as described in Ref. 20Kukor Z. TÓth M. Sahin-TÓth M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 2047-2058Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar. Activated trypsin concentrations were determined from the density of the trypsin band, plotted as a function of time, and rates were estimated from linear fits to the initial portions of the reactions. Zymogen Activation with Human and Bovine Enteropeptidase—To study the significance of the Asp19-22 residues (Fig. 1) in zymogen activation, individual Ala and Glu replacements were carried out in recombinant human cationic trypsinogen, yielding single Ala mutants D19A, D20A, D21A, and D22A and single Glu mutants D19E, D20E, D21E, and D22E. In addition, tri-Ala replacement of the Asp19-21 segment (mutant A3D) and tetra-Ala replacement of the entire Asp19-22 motif (mutant A4) were also performed. Because of the strong autoactivation of cationic trypsinogen, specific rates of enteropeptidase activation could not be determined with catalytically competent proenzymes. Therefore, the catalytic Ser200 (chymo# Ser195) was replaced with Ala in wild-type (mutant S200A) and mutant trypsinogens. Activation of S200A trypsinogen mutants by the enteropeptidase holoenzyme was performed at 37 °C in 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm CaCl2, followed by SDS-PAGE analysis and densitometric quantitation. To inhibit any possible trypsin carryover or contamination from the enteropeptidase preparations, the activation experiments were carried out in the presence of 0.12 μm soybean trypsin inhibitor (Kunitz), which abolishes trypsin activity but does not affect enteropeptidase. Kinetic analysis of trypsinogen activation by human enteropeptidase yielded a Km of 1.4 μm and a kcat of 35.1 s-1 (Table I). The Km value is in good agreement with previous reports, whereas the kcat is almost 10-fold higher, probably due to the ultrapure recombinant enteropeptidase preparation or to the different reaction conditions used (see Table I). Subsequently, the activation assays were carried out with 2 μm trypsinogen concentration, which corresponds to the approximate Km value of the activation reaction. Unexpectedly, rates of activation of wild-type trypsinogen or mutants D19A, D20A, and D21A were identical when activated with human enteropeptidase (Fig. 1). Activation with bovine enteropeptidase proceeded ∼4-fold slower (note the different enzyme concentrations used; also see Table I), but no measurable difference was detected between wild-type and D19A, D20A, and D21A trypsinogens. The data indicate that the Asp19-Asp20-Asp21 segment does not play any significant role in enteropeptidase recognition. However, a markedly different picture emerged when mutant D22A was activated with human or bovine enteropeptidase. Bovine enteropeptidase exhibited 24-fold decreased activity for the D22A mutant relative to wild-type trypsinogen, whereas activation by human enteropeptidase was only 1.2-fold slower. Clearly, Asp22 plays a critical role for recognition by bovine enteropeptidase; however, it contributes only minimally to activation by the cognate human enzyme. The remarkable species specificity observed here underscores the importance of studying physiologically relevant enteropeptidase-trypsinogen pairs to understand the evolutionary processes that shaped zymogen activation.Table IKinetic parameters of trypsinogen activation by human and bovine enteropeptidase Rates of enteropeptidase-mediated S200A trypsinogen activation were determined at six different substrate concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 14 μm.

The data also raise the possibility that, in fact, acidic residues within the activation peptide are entirely dispensable for enteropeptidase recognition and cleavage. To address this question, mutant A3D, in which only Asp22 is present as a single acidic residue, and mutant A4, which is completely devoid of Asp residues, were activated with enteropeptidase. A number of technical difficulties hindered these experiments. First, removal of the Asp residues from the activation peptide abolished the mobility shift routinely observed on reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and trypsinogen and trypsin migrated at identical positions. To visualize the activation reaction, activated trypsinogens were resolved on 21% gels, under nonreducing conditions. As shown in Fig. 2, in this electrophoresis system, the mobility shift becomes apparent again. Using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, we have confirmed that the gel shift was caused by the removal of the activation peptide (not shown). Second, mutant A4 was extremely trypsin-sensitive, and even minute amounts of trypsin(ogen) contamination originating from the affinity column or labware could result in significant trypsin-mediated activation. This problem was overcome by inclusion of soybean trypsin inhibitor in the activation reactions, and experiments were carried out with 0.12, 0.5, 1, and 2 μm inhibitor concentrations, with identical results. Fig. 2A demonstrates that both human and bovine enteropeptidase activated A3D trypsinogen. When compared with activation of wild-type trypsinogen (cf. Fig. 1), the rate of A3D trypsinogen activation by human enteropeptidase was identical, whereas activation by bovine enteropeptidase was 2-fold decreased. This observation was consistent with the findings in Fig. 1, indicating that the Asp19-21 triplet is not required for recognition by enteropeptidase from either species. Strikingly, A4 trypsinogen was also activated by human enteropeptidase with a rate that was ∼2-fold decreased relative to wild-type trypsinogen. In contrast, bovine enteropeptidase did not cleave A4 trypsinogen to any detectable degree (Fig. 2B). Kinetic analysis of A4 trypsinogen activation by human enteropeptidase revealed a slightly increased Km (2.1 μm) and an ∼3-fold decreased kcat (11.2 s-1; Table I). Therefore, A4 trypsinogen is still a specific enteropeptidase substrate, which is cleaved with"

Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-1 is a member of a family comprising six secreted proteins (designated IGFBP-1 1The abbreviations used are: IGFBP-1, insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-binding protein-1; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; SFM, serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation.1The abbreviations used are: IGFBP-1, insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-binding protein-1; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; SFM, serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation. to IGFBP-6) that can modulate upon binding the availability and thus the biological effects of insulin-like growth factors I and II (IGF-I and IGF-II). Both inhibition and enhancement of the hormone action have been described, and several mechanisms, including binding of IGFBPs to the extracellular matrix, phosphorylation, and proteolysis, have been shown to modulate their affinity for IGFs. Moreover, an increasing number of reports indicate that IGFBPs can regulate cellular functions independently of their ability to interact with IGFs (1Baxter R.C. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2000; 278: 967-976Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Firth S.M. Baxter R.C. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 824-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (1432) Google Scholar). Each IGFBP polypeptide chain, ranging in length from 216 to 289 amino acids, may be divided into three distinct domains of approximately equal size. The N- and C-terminal portions exhibit a high primary sequence identity across the six IGFBPs and contain spatially conserved cysteine residues that form intra-domain disulfide bonds. The central domain is the least conserved region and in some of the proteins contains post-translational modifications and proteolytic cleavage sites. On the basis of their sequence homology it is assumed that IGFBPs share a common overall fold and have very similar IGF binding pockets. The N-and C-terminal domains are known to be involved in IGF binding (3Clemmons D.R. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1998; 140: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar), and recently the x-ray structure of the ternary complex of the two domains of IGFBP-4 and IGF-I has been reported (4Siwanowicz I.

In this complex the C-terminal domain was partially disordered, and therefore, a detailed model of this part of the molecule could not be produced. The structure of the N-terminal domain of IGFBP-5, both isolated (NMR data (5Kalus W. Zweckstetter M. Renner C. Sanchez Y. Georgescu J. Grol M. Demuth D. Schumacher R. Dony C. Lang K. Holak T.A.

Headey S.J. Keizer D.W. Bach L.A. Norton R.S. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 11187-11195Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), but there is no x-ray model available of the C-terminal domain of any member of this protein family, although the C-terminal fragment of IGFBP-4 was crystallized recently (9Fernandez-Tornero C. Lozano R.M. Rivas G. Jimenez M.A. Standker L. Diaz-Gonzalez D. Forssmann W.G. Cuevas P. Romero A. Gimenez-Gallego G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18899-18907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Proteolytic cleavage at the mid-region between the two domains of the protein is considered the predominant mechanism for IGF release from all IGFBPs (10Bunn R.C. Fowlkes J.L. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 14: 176-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), but several studies indicate that the resulting N- and C-terminal fragments still retain the ability to inhibit IGF activity (11Mark S. Kubler B. Honing S. Oesterreicher S. John H. Braulke T. Forssmann W.G. Standker L. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 3644-3652Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Additionally, recent reports suggest that proteolysis of IGFBPs results in fragments with potential functional properties that differ from those of the intact protein (9Fernandez-Tornero C. Lozano R.M. Rivas G. Jimenez M.A. Standker L. Diaz-Gonzalez D. Forssmann W.G. Cuevas P. Romero A. Gimenez-Gallego G. J. Biol.

IGFBP-1 is normally expressed in a tissue-specific manner in the liver, kidney, decidualized endometrium, and luteinizing granulosa cells (12Lee P.D. Giudice L.C. Conover C.A. Powell D.R. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1997; 216: 319-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). It is the predominant IGFBP in amniotic fluid (13Drop S.L. Kortleve D.J. Guyda H.J. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1984; 59: 899-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), a major IGF-binding protein in fetal plasma, and its concentration is increased in maternal circulation during pregnancy. Several studies indicate that the protein plays a relevant role in embryonic growth as a local modulator of IGFs bioavailability at the maternal-fetal interface (14Han V.K. Bassett N. Walton J. Challis J.R. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 81: 2680-2693Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 15Kajimura S. Aida K. Duan C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1240-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Moreover, the up-regulation of IGFBP-1 was demonstrated in breast human tumors and was associated with the malignant transformation of breast tissue (16Pekonen F. Nyman T. Ilvesmaki V. Partanen S. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 5204-5207PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, IGFBP-1 contains an Arg-Gly-Asp tripeptide that can bind to the recognition site of α5β1 integrin, leading to the stimulation of migration in various cell species (17Irving J.A. Lala P.K. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 217: 419-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 18Jones J.I. Gockerman A. Busby Jr., W.H. Wright G. Clemmons D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Metab. 2001; 86: 2484-2493Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The mature polypeptide chain of IGFBP-1 is composed of 234 amino acids (the unprocessed precursor is 259 amino acids long) and is phosphorylated at three serine residues, 126, 144, and 194 (we will follow the sequence numbering of the unprocessed precursor) (21Jones J.I. Busby Jr., W.H. Wright G. Smith C.E. Kimack N.M. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1125-1131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pregnancy-associated proteolysis of several other binding proteins has been described (22Davies S.C. Holly J.M. Coulson V.J. Cotterill A.M. Abdulla A.F. Whittaker P.G. Chard T. Wass J.A. Clin. Endocrinol. 1991; 34: 501-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and recent studies have focused on the cleavage of IGFBP-1 by matrix metalloproteases present in amniotic fluid and conditioned medium from decidualized endometrial cells (23Gibson J.M. Aplin J.D. White A. Westwood M. Mol. Hum. Reprod. 2001; 7: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 24Coppock H.A. White A. Aplin J.D. Westwood M. Biol. Reprod. 2004; 71: 438-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) In this study we describe the isolation of the C-terminal domain of IGFBP-1 from human amniotic fluid and its structural characterization by x-ray crystallography to 1.8 Å resolution. We also show that the C-terminal fragment, which contains the Arg-Gly-Asp tripeptide, retains the capability of the intact protein to stimulate cell migration and that it binds the ferrous ion through the only histidine residue present in the chain. Protein Purification and Electrophoretic Analysis—Human amniotic fluid was obtained from discarded amniocentesis samples collected in the weeks 16-18. The pooled fluid (3 liters) was saturated to 90% with ammonium sulfate, and the precipitated proteins, after centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 1 h, were dissolved in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, dialyzed against the same buffer, and fractioned by gel filtration on a 4 × 100-cm Sephadex G100 column. Proteins eluting after the albumin peak were pooled, equilibrated in 6.25 mm Bis-Tris-propane, pH 7.5, and separated on a 2.6 × 30-cm high performance Q-Sepharose column equilibrated with the same buffer (buffer A) and connected to an Åkta Purifier system (Amersham Biosciences). The elution was performed with a 375-min linear gradient from 0 to 100% of 6.25 mm Bis-Tris-propane, pH 9.5, 350 mm NaCl (buffer B) and monitored at 280 nm. The fractions containing the C-terminal fragment of IGFBP-1 were pooled, concentrated, and submitted to gel filtration on a Superdex G75 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated and eluted with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl. Intact IGFBP-1 was isolated by gel filtration on a Superdex G75 column followed by ion exchange chromatography on a Mono Q HR 5/5 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and resolved with a gradient from 0 to 0.5 m NaCl in the same buffer. The homogeneity of the proteins was checked by SDS-PAGE analysis under reducing and non-reducing conditions and by N-terminal sequence determination in a Hewlett-Packard model G 1000 A sequencer (Centro Grandi Strumenti, University of Pavia). Isoelectric focusing was performed using the immobilized pH gradient system on a laboratory-made polyacrylamide gel cast on GelBond with a non-linear 4-10 pH gradient (25Gianazza E. Giacon P. Sahlin B. Righetti P.G. Electrophoresis. 1985; 6: 53-56Crossref Scopus (125) Google Scholar) obtained with acrylamido buffer solutions (Fluka). The pI values were determined by comparison with marker proteins. Analytical polyacrylamide slab gel electrophoresis in the presence of SDS was performed as reported by Laemmli (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206620) Google Scholar) using a Mini PROTEAN II Cell (Bio-Rad). For dephosphorylation 5-μg aliquots of each of the three isoforms of IGFBP-1 and of the C-terminal fragment in 0.05 m Tris HCl, pH 8.5, containing 0.5 mm MgCl2 were exposed to 200 units of alkaline phosphatase (Sigma) at 37 °C for 1 h. The reaction mixtures and samples containing the untreated proteins were diluted 1:1 with the 8 m urea solution containing 0.5% carrier ampholites and submitted to analytical isoelectric focusing. Antibody Production and Western Blot Analysis—For polyclonal antibody production against IGFBP-1, BALB/c mice were injected intraperitoneally five times at 1-week intervals with 100 μg of the purified IGFBP-1. The antigen was emulsified with an equal volume of complete Freund's adjuvant for the first immunization followed by four injections in incomplete adjuvant. The mice were bled, and the sera were tested for reactivity to the purified IGFBP-1 and its C-terminal fragment using ELISA and Western blot. The specific IgGs were purified by affinity chromatography on protein A-Sepharose columns according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Amersham Biosciences). Antibody titers were assayed either by ELISA or immunoblotting. For Western blot analyses electrophoreses were run on 17% SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were transferred by electroblotting to Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore) using a Mini Protean II apparatus (Bio-Rad). The membrane was blocked with 5% w/v skim milk and probed with the mouse antiserum diluted 1:1000. Immunoreactive spots were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse immunoglobulin and developed by the enhanced chemiluminescence method (ECL system, Amersham Biosciences). Analysis of Cell Migration—Normal human skin fibroblasts (Promo-Cell Gmbh, Germany) were used for cell culture experiments. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 1 mg/ml streptomycin (complete medium) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. Purified IGFBP-1 and its C-terminal fragment were dissolved in 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 containing 0.15 m NaCl and diluted with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium at the indicated concentrations. Cells were plated in 35-mm Petri dishes and allowed to grow to confluency. The confluent monolayers were “wounded” by scraping cells in the center of the culture dishes using a rubber policeman to generate an acellular area (27Chen P. Gupta K. Wells A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 547-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). After repeated rinses with PBS, the monolayers were examined and photographed under an inverted microscope and incubated for 48 h in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (SFM) with and without 1 μg/ml IGFBP-1 or its C-terminal fragment. At the end of the incubation the cells were fixed in methanol for 15 min at -20 °C, examined, and photographed. The plates were previously marked to ensure that the same area was recorded. Cell migration was also evaluated in Transwell inserts (8-μm pore size, Nunc, Denmark); 5 × 104 fibroblasts were seeded into the upper wells in 500 μl of SFM alone or with 1 μg/ml IGFBP-1 or its C-terminal fragment. The lower wells contained 500 μl of SFM. Cells were allowed to migrate through the filters for 48 h; non-migrating cells were removed from the upper surface using a cotton swab, and the cells that had migrated to the bottom surface of the inserts were fixed and stained with the Diff-Quick staining kit (Medion Diagnostic GmbH, Switzerland) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Migration was quantified by counting the stained cells in 10 non-overlapping fields using a light microscope fitted with a grid eyepiece. The data are the means ± S.D. of triplicate wells from at least two different protein preparations. For the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay cells (20,000 cells/well) were plated on 96-well plates and grown for 48 h. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthyazol-2-yl)-2,5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide) (Sigma) was added to 1 mg/ml for 4 h followed by extraction as reported (20Gleeson L.M. Chakraborty C. McKinnon T. Lala P.K. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 86: 2484-2493Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Production of Recombinant IGF-II—The cDNA coding for mature IGF-II (residues 25-91) was amplified by PCR using specific primers designed to introduce BamHI and HindIII restriction sites and a sequence coding for a thrombin cleavage site at the end of the protein chain. The fragment was digested and ligated in the pQE50 vector (Qiagen), which expresses a C-terminal His6-tagged fusion protein. Escherichia coli BL21 cells, transformed with the IGF-II-pQE50 construct, were grown at 37 °C in LB medium, and protein expression was induced overnight by the addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The cells were harvested and sonicated. Inclusion bodies containing the recombinant IGF-II were washed twice with 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl containing 0.1% Triton X-100, and the protein was solubilized in the same buffer containing 6 m guanidine HCl and 20 mm reduced glutathione. The solution was clarified by centrifugation, and the supernatant was applied to a Ni2+-Sepharose column equilibrated in the same buffer. On-column refolding was carried out with a linear 6-0 m guanidine HCl gradient in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl containing 10 mm imidazole. The recombinant His6-tagged protein was eluted with a linear 10 mm-0.5 m imidazole gradient. The fractions containing the recombinant IGF-II were collected, concentrated, and further purified by gel filtration chromatography on a Superdex G75 column. The final purity was checked by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with an anti-His6 horseradish peroxidase-conjugated monoclonal antibody (Sigma). The protein was concentrated to 1 mg/ml, dialyzed against saline phosphate buffer (PBS), and stored at - 80 °C. ELISA Assays—To examine the binding of IGFBP-1 and its C-terminal domain to IGF-II by ELISA, microtiter wells were coated for 90 min at 37 °C with 100 μl of 1 μg/ml IGF-II in 50 mm sodium carbonate, pH 9.5. After washing in PBST (PBS containing 0.1% v/v Tween 20), the wells were blocked at 4 °C overnight with 200 μl of 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS. For the binding assay, 1 μg of IGFBP-1 and 0.5 μg of its C-terminal fragment in 100 μl of 0.1 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, were added to the coated wells and incubated for 60 min at room temperature. For the inhibition assay, IGFBP-1 and its C-terminal fragment were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 100 μm FeCl2 dissolved in 0.1 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, before addition to the coated wells. Dose dependence was tested by incubating the intact protein with different concentrations of FeCl2. The plates were then extensively washed with PBST and incubated for 90 min with 1 μg of mouse anti-IGFBP-1 IgG dissolved in PBS with 2% bovine serum albumin. After washing 5 times with PBST, the microtiter wells were incubated for 1 h with rabbit anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:1000 dilution; Dako, Gostrup, Denmark). Finally, the conjugated enzyme was treated with o-phenylethylenediamine dihydrochloride (Sigma), and the absorbance at 492 nm was monitored with a micro-plate reader (Bio-Rad). Crystallization and X-ray Data Collection—Screening for crystallization conditions was performed with the hanging drop method at 4 and 20 °C using Hampton Research Screens and mixing 1 μl of the protein solution and the same volume of precipitating solution and equilibrating versus 0.3 ml in the reservoir. Larger diffraction quality crystals could be obtained by using bigger volumes with the sitting drop method. The crystals grow by mixing equal volumes of 35% dioxane, and the protein dissolved in 0.02 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, at a concentration of 20 mg/ml. The crystals are orthorhombic, space group P21212, with unit cell parameters a = 38.54 Å, b = 60.39 Å, and c = 31.24 Å and contain one C-terminal domain of IGFBP-1 in the asymmetric unit. The diffraction data were collected from crystals frozen at 100 K after a brief immersion in a mixture of 70% of the mother liquor and 30% glycerol. The data for the native crystals and the two heavy atom derivatives were obtained using copper Kα radiation from a Rigaku RU-300-rotating anode x-ray generator with a Mar345 imaging plate area detector. The data for the co-crystal with FeSO4 were collected at the XRD1 beamline of the Elettra synchrotron in Trieste (λ = 1.00 Å). The two heavy atom derivatives were prepared by overnight soaking of a crystal in mother liquor with the addition of the two compounds at a final concentration of about 1 mm. The data were indexed, integrated, and reduced using the programs MOSFLM (28Leslie A.G.W. Joint CCP4/ESF-EACMB Newslett. Protein Crystallogr. 1992; 26: 27-33Google Scholar) and AUTOMAR and Scala (29Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

The two platinum sites were located in a difference Patterson map (30Sheldrick G.M. Wolf W. Evans P.R. Leslie A.G.W. Isomorphous Replacement and Anomalous Scattering: Proceedings of the CCP4 Study Weekend, January 25-26, 1991.

D. 1994; 50: 760-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (19730) Google Scholar). The single isomorphous replacement phases were used to locate the most significant mercury site in the difference Fourier map. These two major sites (one site from each of the two derivatives) were used as input for the program autoSHARP (31Bricogne G. Vonrhein C. Flensburg C. Schiltz M. Paciorek W. Acta. Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 2023-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar) that was used to locate the minor sites of the two derivatives and for density modification and final phasing. The electron density map thus produced was of excellent quality and could be readily interpreted. The initial model was built in the high quality map at 2.3 Å resolution using the program O (32Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13006) Google Scholar) and was subsequently refined with the program REFMAC (33Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13815) Google Scholar). During the process of refinement and model building, the quality of the model was controlled with the program PROCHECK (34Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Solvent molecules were added to the model in the final stages of refinement according to hydrogen-bond criteria and only if their B factors refined to reasonable values and if they improved the Rfree. The final model contains 642 non-hydrogen protein atoms and has very reasonable geometry (see Table I), with 87.5% of the residues in the most favored regions of the Ramachandran plot and the remaining 12.5% in the additionally allowed region. The iron in the co-crystal was modeled into a difference Fourier map phased by the refined, unliganded structure, and the model was refined with REFMAC using the same criteria followed in the refinement of the apoprotein. The final statistics of the co-crystals are also given in Table I. Isolation of IGFBP-1 C-terminal Fragment and Intact IGFBP-1 from Human Amniotic Fluid—The purification protocol used in the present work was developed with the aim of isolating a large number of components from human amniotic fluid. Proteins were thus precipitated with up to 90% ammonium sulfate concentration, and after a preliminary fractionation by gel filtration chromatography, the low molecular mass components were resolved by anion exchange chromatography and further purified by gel filtration (data not shown). The fractions showing the presence of a single band, when checked by SDS gel electrophoresis, were submitted to N-terminal sequence determination. The first 15 residues of a homogeneous 11-kDa polypeptide chain were VTNIKKWKEPCRIEL, and a search in the SWISSPROT data bank revealed that this sequence was identical to an internal amino acid sequence of IGFBP-1 starting from residue 166 (the numbering corresponds to the full-length precursor, SWISSPROT accession number P08833). The apparent molecular mass of the fragment accounts for the entire C-terminal domain (spanning residues 176-259) and the last portion of the central domain (residues 166-175). The recovery of the fragment was estimated in 1.5 mg/liter of amniotic fluid, using the extinction coefficient calculated from the amino acid composition. Three components showing an apparent molecular mass of 30 kDa were identified as isoforms of the intact IGFBP-1 on the basis of their unique N-terminal sequence, APWQCAPCSAEKLAL (residues 26-40 in the SWISSPROT numbering). It is known that during pregnancy decidual cells produce the non-phosphorylated as well as the differently phosphorylated IGFBP-1 forms characteristic of human pregnancy plasma (23Gibson J.M. Aplin J.D. White A. Westwood M. Mol. Hum. Reprod. 2001; 7: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 35Westwood M. Gibson J.M. Davies A.J. Young R.J. White A. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1994; 79: 1735-1741Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The anion exchange chromatography retention times of the isoforms correlate with their more acidic pI values, and both acquire the same net charge of the non-phosphorylated protein after treatment with alkaline phosphatase. These results show that the IGFBP-1 isoforms present in human amniotic fluid are differently phosphorylated forms of the protein. The C-terminal fragment was submitted to analytic isoelectric focusing before and after the alkaline phosphatase treatment, and its mobility shift upon removal of the phosphate group revealed that it is phosphorylated as well. The pI values measured for the unmodified intact protein and its C-terminal fragment were 5.2 and 7.2, respectively, in agreement with the theoretical values calculated on the basis of their amino acid composition. The intact IGFBP-1 was used to produce polyclonal antibodies in mouse that were found to react with both the intact protein and the C-terminal region. A fresh sample of amniotic fluid was then resolved by SDS gel electrophoresis and, after electroblotting, probed with the anti-IGFBP-1 antibodies that recognized a single band corresponding to the molecular mass of the intact protein. This result shows that the cleavage producing the C-terminal fragment occurred in the amniotic fluid either during the long-term storage or during the purification procedure. Although the isolation of the C-terminal portion of IGFBP-1 from a natural source has not been reported before, amniotic fluid is known to contain several proteases belonging to different classes that can cleave IGFBPs. The IGFBP-1 C-terminal Fragment Promotes Cell Migration—IGFBP-1 stimulates cell migration in an IGF-independent manner through the binding of its RGD motif to α5β1 integrin (17Irving J.A. Lala P.K.

Here, we determined the 1.7-Å resolution crystal structure of the Thermus thermophilus ValRS editing domain. A comparison of the structure with the previously reported tRNA complex structure revealed conformational changes of the editing domain upon accommodation of the terminal A76; the “GTG loop” moves to expand the pocket, and the side chain of Phe-264 on the GTG loop rotates to interact with the A76 adenine ring. If these conformational changes did not occur, then C75 and A76 of the tRNA would clash with Phe-264. To elucidate the mechanism of the threonine side-chain recognition, we determined the crystal structure of the editing domain bound with [N-(l-threonyl)-sulfamoyl]adenosine at 1.7-Å resolution. The γ-OH of the threonyl moiety is recognized by the Lys-270, Thr-272, and Asp-279 side chains, which may reject the cognate valyl moiety. Accordingly, ValRS mutants with an Ala substitution for Lys-270 or Asp-279 synthesized significant amounts of Thr-tRNAVal. The misproduced Thr-tRNAVal was hydrolyzed efficiently by the wild-type ValRS, but this post-transfer editing activity was drastically impaired by the Ala substitutions for Lys-270 and Asp-279 and was also decreased by those for Arg-216, Phe-264, and Thr-272. These results indicate that the threonyl moiety and A76 of Thr-tRNAVal are recognized by the Lys-270, Thr-272, and Asp-279 side chains and by the Phe-264 side chain, respectively, of the ValRS editing domain.

The accuracy of protein synthesis depends on the specific recognition of amino acids and tRNAs by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (1Freist W. Sternbach H. Cramer F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 173: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 2Martinis S.A. Plateau P. Cavarelli J. Florentz C. Biochimie (Paris). 1999; 81: 683-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The aminoacylation of tRNA occurs in two steps. In the first step the amino acid is condensed with ATP to create an aminoacyl adenylate. In the second step the activated aminoacyl moiety is transferred to the 3′-end of its cognate tRNA (3Fersht A.R. Kaethner M.M. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3342-3346Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Some aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases must discriminate their cognate amino acid from very similar ones. For example, isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase (IleRS) 1The abbreviations used are: IleRS, isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase; ValRS, valyl-tRNA synthetase; LeuRS, leucyl-tRNA synthetase; Thr-AMS, [N-(l-threonyl)sulfamoyl]adenosine; Thr-2AA, 2′-(l-threonyl)amino-2′-deoxyadenosine. should discriminate between the cognate isoleucine and the noncognate valine, which differs by only a single methylene group. Valyl-tRNA synthetase (ValRS) should discriminate the cognate valine from the non-cognate, isosteric threonine, which has a quite similar shape and size as valine and a hydroxyl group in its side chain instead of a methyl group. Leucyl-tRNA synthetase (LeuRS) should discriminate leucine from isoleucine and methionine. However, these enzymes reportedly misactivate and subsequently mis-aminoacylate the noncognate amino acids at various rates (3Fersht A.R. Kaethner M.M.

To maintain high translational fidelity, these aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases catalyze proofreading (editing) reactions in which the misproducts are hydrolyzed. In the “post-transfer editing” reaction, the enzyme deacylates misacylated tRNA (Fig. 1). A large domain (named the editing domain) is responsible for the editing activity (4Schmidt E. Schimmel P.

The crystal structures revealed that the editing domain is a discrete domain and is located more than 30 Å away from the aminoacylation site (6Fukunaga R. Yokoyama S. J. Mol.

In the two tRNA-complexed crystal structures, the Staphylococcus aureus IleRS-tRNAIle complex (14Silvian L.F. Wang J. Steitz T.A. Science. 1999; 285: 1074-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar) and the Thermus thermophilus ValRS-tRNAVal complex (11Fukai S. Nureki O. Sekine S. Shimada A. Tao J. Vassylyev D.G. Yokoyama S. Cell. 2000; 103: 793-803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), the 3′-CCA end of the tRNA is directed toward the editing active site rather than the aminoacylation active site. These observations suggested that when a non-cognate amino acid is mischarged to a tRNA, the tRNA acceptor stem flips from the aminoacylation site to the editing site, whereas the rest of the tRNA remains bound (14Silvian L.F. Wang J. Steitz T.A. Science. 1999; 285: 1074-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). In the T. thermophilus ValRS-tRNAVal complex structure (11Fukai S. Nureki O. Sekine S. Shimada A. Tao J.

The post-transfer editing mechanisms seem to be distinct between ValRS and IleRS. In the post-transfer editing the non-cognate amino acid may be hydrolyzed from the ribose 2′-OH in ValRS (and LeuRS), but in IleRS it may be hydrolyzed from the ribose 3′-OH (5Lincecum T.L. Tukalo M.

Actually, some of the editing site residues are distinctly conserved between ValRS and IleRS (Fig. 1D). There is another difference between ValRS and IleRS. In addition to the post-transfer editing reaction, IleRS catalyzes the “pre-transfer editing” reaction, where the misactivated aminoacyl adenylate is hydrolyzed (17Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 1025-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). A misrecognized non-cognate amino acid is cleared if either a pre- or post-transfer editing reaction occurs. IleRS reportedly performs editing reactions mainly (80-90%) via the pre-transfer pathway (17Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 1025-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Structure-based mutational experiments suggested the existence of two proximal, but distinct binding pockets in the IleRS editing domain for the pre- and post-transfer editing substrates (11Fukai S.

On the other hand, ValRS rejects a non-cognate amino acid, threonine, mainly by the post-transfer pathway (3Fersht A.R. Kaethner M.M. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3342-3346Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 19Jakubowski H. Fersht A.R.

Structural studies revealed how the pre- and post-transfer editing substrates bind in the editing domain of the bacterial LeuRS (the noncognate amino acid is norvaline in this case) (5Lincecum T.L. Tukalo M. Yaremchuk A. Mursinna R.S. Williams A.M. Sproat B.S. Van Den Eynde W. Link A. Van Calenbergh S. Grotli M. Martinis S.A. Cusack S. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 951-963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). However, the editing mechanism of bacterial LeuRS is thought to be different from those of ValRS and IleRS, since its editing domain is inserted at a different location in the enzyme, and its rotational orientation differs by nearly 180° relative to those of IleRS and ValRS (6Fukunaga R.

ValRS is the only enzyme for which a fully ordered tRNA-complexed structure has been reported, but a complex structure with editing substrates or analogues has not yet been solved. Therefore, the mechanism in which the editing active site specifically recognizes the non-cognate threonine without misrecognizing the cognate valine has remained unknown. In this study we have solved the high resolution crystal structures of the editing domain from T. thermophilus ValRS at 1.7-Å resolutions. A comparison of this structure with the tRNAVal complex structure (11Fukai S. Nureki O. Sekine S. Shimada A. Tao J. Vassylyev D.G. Yokoyama S. Cell. 2000; 103: 793-803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) revealed that the conformational changes of the Phe-264 side chain and the loop where Phe-264 is located (the GTG loop) are crucial to accommodate the adenosine base of the tRNA terminal A76 into the editing site. This conformation change mainly occurs because of the steric hindrance of C75 with Phe-264 in the tRNA-free form. Therefore, a non-hydrolyzable analogue of threonyl-adenosine (a minimal substrate analogue for the post-transfer editing) cannot bind by itself in the editing domain in the crystal. Instead, we succeeded in solving the editing domain structure complexed with a Thr-AMP analog, [N-(l-threonyl)sulfamoyl]-adenosine (Thr-AMS), at 1.7-Å resolution. The side-chain γ-OH of Thr-AMS is located in the hydrophilic pocket composed of Lys-270, Thr-272, and Asp-279, which is the structural basis for the specific discrimination of the noncognate, hydrophilic threonine, from the cognate, hydrophobic valine. Mutational analyses showed that these residues are crucial for the hydrolysis of Thr-tRNAVal, indicating that the revealed threonine side-chain recognition mechanism of Thr-AMS reflects that of the post-transfer editing. Protein Preparation—The gene fragment encoding the T. thermophilus ValRS editing domain (amino acids 195-337 with the initiating methionine) was subcloned into pET26b (Novagen). The plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) codon PLUS (Stratagene). For protein overexpression the cells were grown to an A600 of 0.6-0.8, and the expression was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 4 h. The cells were harvested and sonicated in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The insoluble cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was heat-treated at 70 °C for 30 min to denature the E coli proteins and then centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Then, 3.5 m (NH4)2SO4 was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 1.3 m. The mixture was applied to a butyl-Toyopearl column (Tosoh) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 1.3 m (NH4)2SO4, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol (buffer A). The editing domain was eluted with a linear gradient of 1.3-0 m (NH4)2SO4. The fractions were dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 5 mm MgCl2 and 1 mm dithiothreitol and loaded onto a ResourceQ column (Amersham Biosciences). The enzyme did not bind to this column. The flow-through fraction was loaded onto a unoQ column (Bio-Rad), and the enzyme was eluted with a linear gradient of 0-1.0 m NaCl. The fractions were collected, and 3.5 m (NH4)2SO4 was added to a final concentration of 1.3 m. The sample was applied to a ResourcePHE column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer A and was eluted with a linear gradient of 1.3-0 m (NH4)2SO4 in buffer A. The fractions were dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 5 mm MgCl2 and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol and were concentrated to 10 mg/ml. The final purity of the proteins, as monitored by SDS-PAGE and UV spectroscopy, was more than 98%. About 5 mg of purified protein were obtained from 1 liter of the cell culture. The protein sample was stored at 4 °C until use. Crystallization and Data Collection—For crystallization, the hanging drop vapor diffusion method was used by mixing 1 μl of the protein preparation and 1 μl of the reservoir solution (100 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 1.15 m trisodium citrate and 5% 2-propanol) at 20 °C. To obtain co-crystals, a protein solution containing 20 mm [N-(l-threonyl)sulfamoyl]adenosine, Thr-AMS (RNA-TEC), was used. The diffraction datasets were collected at the beamline BL26B1 at SPring-8 (Harima). A single crystal flash-frozen at a temperature of -173 °C was used for each experiment. Before flash-cooling, the crystals were transferred into a cryoprotective solution containing 20% (v/v) ethylene glycol. The data sets were processed using the HKL2000 program (20Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38573) Google Scholar). Structure Determination and Refinement—We carried out molecular replacement with MOLREP (21Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 39: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4153) Google Scholar) starting with the coordinates of the editing domain from the full-length T. thermophilus ValRS, which we previously determined at 2.9-Å resolution (PDB code 1GAX) (11Fukai S.

The model refinement was carried out using the program CNS (22Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J.

Several rounds of Cartesian coordinate energy minimization simulated annealing, B factor refinement, and automatic water-picking, and manual revision of the model using the program O (23Jones T.A.

As for the Thr-AMS-bound structure, after building the ligand model, further rounds of refinement were performed. A Ramachandran plot analysis using the program PROCHECK (24Laskowski R.A.

The omit map for the Thr-AMS was calculated at the end of the refinement. Data collection and structure refinement statistics are summarized in Table I.

This plasmid encodes ValRS with a His tag on its C-terminal end. The mutations R216A, F264A, K270A, T272A, D276A, and D279A were introduced using a QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Plasmids were transformed into E coli strain BL21(DE3) codon PLUS. The cells were cultured and harvested by the same procedure used for producing the editing domain. The cells were sonicated in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and were centrifuged to precipitate the insoluble cell debris. The supernatants were heated at 70 °C for 20 min and subsequently centrifuged remove the denatured E coli proteins. Imidazole was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 20 mm, and the sample solution was applied to a 1-ml HisTrap column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 20 mm imidazole). After the column was washed with buffer B, the proteins were eluted with 30 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 500 mm imidazole, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol and were dialyzed against 150 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 150 mm KCl and 10 mm MgCl2. The final purity of the proteins was monitored by SDS-PAGE and UV spectroscopy. Enzyme Assays—T. thermophilus tRNAVal was transcribed in vitro and purified. Val-tRNAVal and Thr-tRNAVal formation reactions were carried out at 37 °C in 60 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 10 mm MgCl2, 3 mm ATP, 5 μm tRNAVal,20 μm [14C]valine (300 cpm/pmol), and 30 nm ValRS (20 μm [14C]threonine (300 cpm/pmol) and 500 nm ValRS in Thr-tRNAVal formation). Aliquots were removed at specific time points and quenched on filter papers (Whatman, 3 mm) equilibrated with 10% trichloroacetic acid. The filters were washed 3 times with 5% ice-cold trichloroacetic acid and once with 100% ethanol. The radioactivities of the precipitates were quantitated by scintillation counting. [14C]Thr-tRNAVal was prepared by incubating reaction mixtures containing 60 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2,20 μm [14C]threonine (300 cpm/pmol), 10 μm tRNAVal, 4 mm ATP, and 2 μm D279A mutant ValRS at 65 °C for 5 min. The [14C]Thr-tRNAVal thus produced was purified as described (4Schmidt E. Schimmel P. Science. 1994; 264: 265-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 25Giege R. Kern D. Ebel J.P. Grosjean H. de Henau S. Chantrenne H. Eur. J Biochem. 1974; 45: 351-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The Thr-tRNAVal deacylation reactions (post-transfer editing) were carried out at 37 °C in 60 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 10 mm MgCl2, 2 μm [14C]Thr-tRNAVal, and 3 nm ValRS. Aliquots were removed at specific time points and quenched on filter papers (Whatman, 3 mm) equilibrated with 10% trichloroacetic acid. The filters were washed, and the radioactivities of the precipitates were quantitated as described above. The editing activity was determined by measuring the ATP hydrolysis activity essentially as described (4Schmidt E. Schimmel P. Science. 1994; 264: 265-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures (50 μl; 60 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm threonine, 2 μm tRNAVal, 3 mm [γ-32P]ATP (13 cpm/pmol), 0.5 units of pyrophosphatase, and 1 μm ValRS) were incubated at 37 °C. A 4.5-μl aliquot of the reaction was quenched with 500 μl of 0.4% HCl, 1.4% HClO4, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and 5% activated charcoal (Sigma). The [32P]pyrophosphate released as a result of ATP hydrolysis was separated from the charcoal-bound ATP/AMP by centrifugation. The radioactivity in a 100-μl aliquot of supernatant was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. Substrate-free State—We determined the high resolution crystal structure of the isolated T. thermophilus ValRS editing domain at 1.7-Å resolution (PDB code 1WK9) (Fig. 2A). The root mean square deviation between the isolated editing domain and the editing domain in the full-length ValRS (determined at 2.9-Å resolution, PDB code 1GAX) (11Fukai S. Nureki O. Sekine S. Shimada A. Tao J. Vassylyev D.G. Yokoyama S. Cell. 2000; 103: 793-803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) over all Ca atoms is as small as 1.01 Å. The secondary structures are the same, and therefore, the structure of the editing domain in this study reflects that of the full-length ValRS (Fig. 2B). All of the residues are well ordered, and the side-chain conformations were determined unambiguously (Fig. 2C), whereas the side chains of some editing domain residues were disordered in the full-length enzyme (11Fukai S. Nureki O. Sekine S. Shimada A. Tao J. Vassylyev D.G. Yokoyama S. Cell. 2000; 103: 793-803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The average B factors of the atoms in the editing domain structures determined in this study are 26.68 Å and are much smaller than that of the editing domain in the tRNA-complexed full-length ValRS (65.28 Å). Plenty of water molecules were identified, especially in the editing active site (Fig. 2C). tRNA-induced Conformation Change—There is a significant difference between the structures of the editing domain determined in this study and that of the tRNA-complexed ValRS (11Fukai S. Nureki O. Sekine S. Shimada A. Tao J. Vassylyev D.G. Yokoyama S. Cell. 2000; 103: 793-803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The loop consisting of the residues from Lys-262 to Ala-268 (the GTG loop) has the Gly-265—Thr-266—Gly-267 motif that is strongly conserved in ValRS/IleRS/LeuRS and Phe-264 that is conserved specifically in ValRS (Fig. 1D). The GTG loop and the Phe-264 side chain undergo conformational changes to expand the tRNA binding pocket (Fig. 2D). If the Phe-264 residue assumed the same location and conformation as observed in the tRNA-free state, then it would clash significantly with C75 and somewhat with A76 in the tRNA complex structure (Fig. 2D). Thus, the changes in both the main-chain conformation of the GTG loop and the side-chain conformation of Phe-264 are necessary for accommodating the tRNA 3′-terminal region. The B factors of the Phe-264 side-chain atoms are relatively high, suggesting that the side chain can move. The location of the Phe-264 residue (Fig. 1D), preceding the Gly-265 residue of the GTG motif, may enable it to move. Therefore, the editing site binds the C75-A76 region by an “induced-fit” mechanism, which has now been revealed by the determination of the tRNA-free structure. Thr-AMS-bound State—In the ValRS post-transfer editing, the noncognate threonine is hydrolyzed from the ribose 2′-OH (Fig. 1A) (15Nordin B.E. Schimmel P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20510-20517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 16Tardif K.D. Horowitz J. RNA. 2004; 10: 493-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). We attempted to determine the structures of the editing domain complexed with a post-transfer editing substrate analogue, 2′-(l-threonyl)amino-2′-deoxyadenosine (Thr-2AA), mimicking the 3′-end of the aminoacyl-2′ ester Thr-tRNAVal. However, although the editing domain was crystallized in the presence of a high concentration of Thr-2AA, no electron densities corresponding to Thr-2AA were observed in the determined crystal structure. The reason may be that some context of the tRNA 3′-end nucleotides, especially C75, is needed for the aforementioned conformational changes of the GTG loop and Phe-264, and the analogue of Thr-A76 is not sufficient for the conformational change. Free l-threonine also did not bind to the editing domain in the crystal, probably because it is the product of the editing reactions. Instead, we succeeded in determining the co-crystal structure of the editing domain complexed with a proposed pretransfer editing substrate analogue, Thr-AMS, at 1.7-Å resolution (PDB code 1WKA) (Fig. 3). A clear electron density that could be attributed to the Thr-AMS molecule in the editing active site is observed (Fig. 2B). Overall, the domain structure is also similar to that in the full-length ValRS except for the aforementioned Phe-264 conformation. The editing active site is formed mainly by two β-strands (β2 and β6) and two loops (before and after β6) (Fig. 3A). Thr-AMS assumes a quite distorted and compact conformation in the site (Figs. 3, B and C). Adenosine Recognition—The adenine ring is sandwiched between the hydrophobic side chains of Phe-264 and Leu-269 and forms hydrogen bonds with the main chains of Glu"

Aequorin mutants showing increased intensity or slow decay of bioluminescence were isolated by in vitro evolution combining DNA shuffling and functional screening in bacteria. Luminescence decay mutants were isolated at the first round of screening and carried mutations located in EF-hand calcium binding sites or their vicinity. During in vitro evolution, the luminescence intensity of the population of mutants increased with the frequency of effective mutations whereas the frequency of other amino acid substitutions remained roughly stable. Luminescence intensity mutations neighbored the His-16 or His-169 coelenterazine binding residues or were located in the first EF-hand. None of the selected mutants exhibited an increase in photon yield when examined in a cell-free assay. However, we observed that two mutants, Q168R and L170I, exhibited an increase of the photoprotein lifetime at 37 °C that may underlie their high luminescence intensity in bacteria. Further analysis of Q168R and L170I mutations showed that they increased aequorin thermostability. Conversely, examination of luminescence decay mutants revealed that the F149S substitution decreased aequorin thermostability. Finally, screening of a library of random Gln-168 and Leu-170 mutants confirmed the involvement of both positions in thermostability and indicated that optimal thermostability was conferred by Q168R and L170I mutations selected through in vitro evolution. Our results suggest that Phe-149 and Gln-168 residues participate in stabilization of the coelenterazine peroxide and the triggering of photon emission by linking the third EF-hand to Trp-129 and His-169 coelenterazine binding residues.

Here, we used a random mutagenesis and in vitro evolution approach based on DNA shuffling (28Stemmer W.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10747-10751Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar) to isolate functional aequorin mutants with a simple bacterial screening system. This resulted in the selection of aequorin mutants characterized by an increased luminescence in bacterial screening (Bright mutants) or by slow decay kinetics of bioluminescence (SloDK mutants). Most of the Bright and SloDK mutants selected exhibited modifications of Ca2+ sensitivity and/or decay kinetics that will be described elsewhere. In the present study we investigated the stability of the coelenterazine-apoaequorin complex formed by Bright and SloDK mutants. Our results provide insights into mechanisms that stabilize the apoaequorin-coelenterazine complex and enable calcium-dependent photon emission. Random Mutagenesis and in Vitro Evolution of Aequorin—Random mutagenesis by DNA shuffling was performed essentially as described previously (28Stemmer W.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10747-10751Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar). Our WT 2The abbreviations used are: WT, wild type; RTS, rapid translation system; RLU, relative luminescence units. apoaequorin (GenBank™ accession number AY601106, kind gift from Dr. T. Pozzan) differs from the natural gene product by 10 additional amino acids at the N terminus. However, we retained the sequence numbering of the natural gene product (6Inouye S. Noguchi M. Sakaki Y. Takagi Y. Miyata T. Iwanaga S. Miyata T. Tsuji F.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3154-3158Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Three μg of the WT apoaequorin cDNA (coding sequence, 600 bp) was digested with DNase I (1 ng/μl) at 25 °C for 7 min. DNA fragments between 50 and 300 bp were purified from a 2% agarose gel using the Qiaquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany), and 1 μg was used in a primerless PCR (35 cycles: 94 °C, 30 s; 45 °C, 30 s; 72 °C, 30 s) for DNA shuffling. A 2.5-μl aliquot of the shuffling reaction was used in a new PCR (20 cycles: 94 °C, 30 s; 58 °C, 30 s, 72 °C, 40 s) with sense primer UpAeq 5′-CGGGTACCGATGCTTTATGATGTTCCTGAT-3′ and antisense primer LoAeq 5′-TGGAATTCTTAGGGGACAGCTCCAC-3′ to obtain a pool of mutant full-length cDNA (start and stop codons underlined). After digestion by KpnI and EcoRI, mutant apoaequorin cDNAs were inserted into the bacterial expression plasmid pPD16 (29Fire A. Harrison S.W. Dixon D. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 93: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar) under control of the Plac promoter and used to transform the XL1 Escherichia coli strain (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Bacteria were grown overnight at 37 °C on an LB agar plate containing ampicillin, 100 μg/ml. Next, single colonies were transferred to 96-well plates either manually or using a QBot automated colony picker (Genetix, New Milton, UK). Every second plate contained only 95 mutant colonies plus 1 colony of WT aequorin as a control. Colonies were grown overnight at 37 °C in 200 μl of a medium supplemented with ampicillin containing (in g/liter): bacto-tryptone, 26; bacto yeast extract, 10; NaCl, 5; K2HPO4, 0.27; KH2PO4, 7.16; sodium citrate, 2; MgSO4·7H2O, 0.1; (NH4)2SO4, 0.9; glycerol, 50. Finally, 96-well plate replicas were grown for 4-6 h at 37 °C in 50 μl of LB ampicillin medium. Aequorin was then reconstituted by adding 50 μl of a solution containing 100 mm Tris (pH 8), 90 mm NaCl, 5 μm coelenterazine (Prolume, Pinetop, AZ) and incubating overnight at 4 °C in the dark. After equilibration at room temperature for 15 min, screening was performed in a PhL microplate luminometer (Mediator, Vienna, Austria) upon addition of 100 μl of a solution containing Triton X-100, 0.75% and CaCl2, 15 mm. Luminescence amplitudes are given in relative luminescence units (RLU), with 1 RLU corresponding to 1000 photomultiplier counts/s. Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. After screening, selected clones were plated, and single colonies were grown in 96-well plates as duplicate or triplicate in parallel with WT aequorin. Their bioluminescence was then compared again with that of WT aequorin using the above protocol. For in vitro evolution of Bright mutants, the apoaequorin cDNAs of the 40 mutants showing the highest light intensity were mixed in equal proportions and co-amplified using the UpAeq and LoAeq primers. 3 μg of the amplification product was used for the next round of shuffling-screening as described above. Library of Gln-168 and Leu-170 Mutants—First, a unique MluI site (bold in following primers) was created upstream of the Gln-168 codon by introducing silent mutations in the WT apoaequorin cDNA carried by the plasmid pPD16. Then, mutagenesis of the Gln-168 and Leu-170 positions (underlined) was performed by a PCR step with sense primer, 5′-GAGATGACGCGTNN(C/G)CATNN(C/G)GGATTTTGGT-3′, and the LoAeq antisense primer (20 cycles: 94 °C, 30s, 50 °C, 30s, 72 °C, 30s). The PCR product was used for a further PCR with sense primer, 5′-ATGTTGATGAGATGACGCGT-3′ and LoAeq (5 cycles: 94 °C, 30 s, 50 °C, 30 s, 72 °C, 30 s) to avoid mismatches at the Gln-168 and Leu-170 codons. Finally, mutated fragments were inserted between MluI and EcoRI sites of the pPD16-apoaequorin plasmid. The resulting library was processed and screened as described above for shuffled aequorin mutants, except aequorin was reconstituted by adding 50 μl of a solution containing 100 mm Tris (pH 8), 90 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 5 μm coelenterazine. A heat shock (55 °C, 30 min) was applied to aequorin-containing bacteria before light intensity was measured. Functional Analysis of Apoaequorin Mutants—The KpnI-EcoRI full-length coding sequences of WT and mutant apoaequorins were sub-cloned into the pRSETc expression vector (Invitrogen). This resulted in the addition of 40 amino acids at the N terminus, including a His6 tag for purification. Cell-free expression of apoprotein was performed using the Rapid Translation System (RTS, Roche Diagnostics). The reaction proceeded for 24 h at 30 °C, with stirring at 135 rpm, using 10 μg of recombinant pRSETc plasmid. The product of the reaction was then diluted 1:1 in glycerol, and this working stock was stored at -20 °C. Relative amounts of WT and mutant apoaequorins in RTS reaction products were determined by immuno-Western blot analysis using an anti-His6 peroxidase antibody (Roche Diagnostics) revealed with the ECL Western blotting analysis system (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Relative maximum photon yield of WT and mutant aequorins was determined by normalizing the integral of the light emitted at saturating Ca2+ concentration to relative amounts of the corresponding apoproteins. Aequorin was reconstituted for 1 h at 4 °C in the presence of 10 mm 1,4-dithiothreitol, 50 mm Tris (pH 8), 5 mm EDTA, and 5 μm coelenterazine and then diluted 20 times into Tris (pH 8, 50 mm) and EDTA (5 mm) to minimize luminescence background because of unincorporated coelenterazine. Fifty μl of this solution (corresponding to 0.2 μl of apoaequorin working stock) was used per well for functional analysis performed in 96-well plates with a PhL microplate luminometer. For investigation of aequorin lifetime at 37 °C, all aliquots were initially stored at 4 °C and sequentially transferred at 37 °C so as to stop all incubations simultaneously. For thermostability at different temperatures, aliquots were incubated at 25, 37, 42, 48, 54, or 60 °C for 30 min. For recovery from thermal inactivation, undiluted aequorin aliquots were incubated at 60 °C for 30 min. Then, aequorin was reconstituted for 1 h at 4 °C by adding 10 mm 1,4-dithiothreitol and 5 μm coelenterazine. These aliquots were then diluted as described above, and their activity was compared with that of control aliquots kept at 4 °C during the heat shock and reconstitution process. Following equilibration at room temperature for 15 min, aequorin activity was measured at 22 °C by injecting 100 μl of a solution containing 50 mm Tris (pH 8), 15 mm CaCl2, and 5 mm EDTA. Luminescence data were collected with 0.1 s integration time. In our PhL luminometer, injection of 100 μl of solution required 280 ms, and recording started 365 ms after the beginning of injection during the decay phase after luminescence onset (∼10 ms, see Ref. 12Hastings J.W. Mitchell G. Mattingly P.H. Blinks J.R. Van Leeuwen M. Nature. 1969; 222: 1047-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Hence, bioluminescence intensities were measured at the start of the recording unless otherwise stated. Each value represents the mean of at least two experiments performed in triplicate. Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. Some of the lifetime and thermostability experiments presented in this study for RTS-expressed apoaequorins were confirmed with purified proteins that yielded the same results (WT, K17R, and Q168R). Purified apoaequorins were obtained from recombinant pRSETc plasmids expressed in the BL21DE3(pLys) strain of E. coli, using the Xpress purification kit (Invitrogen) with a His6 affinity Probond column (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Purified proteins were used as described above for RTS-expressed apoaequorin. Local Environments of Residues at Amino Acid Positions 149 and 168—Distances between atoms were obtained from the crystal structure of WT aequorin (Protein Data Bank code 1EJ3, see Ref. 11Head J.F. Inouye S. Teranishi K. Shimomura O. Nature. 2000; 405: 372-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) or from the predicted three-dimensional structures of the Q168R and F149S aequorin mutants. Predictions were performed by homology modeling through the Geno3D server (see Ref. 30Combet C. Jambon M. Deleage G. Geourjon C. Bioinformatics. 2002; 18: 213-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar) based on spatial restraints in the crystal structure of WT aequorin. Isolation of Bright and SloDK Aequorin Mutants—A library of aequorin mutants was generated by DNA shuffling and expressed in E. coli (see “Materials and Methods”). The mean number of nucleotide mutations was 1 per molecule, as determined by sequencing 16 randomly picked clones (TABLE ONE). In this sample, the occurrence of A→ G or T→ C substitutions was highest, whereas C→ G or G→ C substitutions were not found. The absence of these latter substitutions in apoaequorin mutants selected through functional screening confirmed their low occurrence in the library. The distribution of these nucleotide substitutions spanned most of the aequorin sequence (Fig. 1C). No nucleotide deletion or addition was observed in any clone sequenced in this study.TABLE ONERandom mutagenesis and in vitro evolution of Bright aequorin mutantsSelected Bright clonesRandom, 1st round1st round2nd round3rd roundSequenced clones14343416Total mutations197210516Mean of total per clone1.362.123.091.00Bright mutations1250770Silent mutations411195Amino acid substitutions other than Bright311911Mean of other substitutions per clone0.210.320.260.69Nucleotide substitutionA→G or T→C1552819A→T or T→A0471A→C or T→G0212C→G or G→C0000C→A or G→T1171C→T or G→A31393 Open table in a new tab After reconstitution with coelenterazine, 15,853 clones were screened in a luminometer by applying a Ca2+-Triton solution onto intact bacteria (see “Materials and Methods”). The light emitted during the first 4 s after injection (L0-4) and during the 4 following s (L4-8) was measured. As aequorin flash bioluminescence follows an exponential decay, the L4-8/L0-4 ratio is an index of decay kinetics. Screening is illustrated in Fig. 1A for a sample of 1146 clones. This sample population exhibited lower activity (640 ± 30 RLU) and slower kinetics (L4-8/L0-4 = 0.39 ± 0.01) than WT (1433 ± 417 RLU and 0.10 ± 0.01, respectively, n = 6). Given a mean number of one mutation per molecule, this indicates that a large proportion of amino acid substitutions affects aequorin bioluminescence and its kinetics. Mutants showing a high L0-4 activity as compared with WT aequorin were selected and termed Bright. Mutants with a high L4-8/L0-4 value as compared with WT, i.e. with slow decay kinetics, were termed SloDK. Selected SloDK mutants showed strikingly slower decay kinetics than WT (not shown). The 20 SloDK mutants showing the highest L4-8/L0-4 and L0-4 values were sequenced. Clones contained a single substitution that consisted of the E35G, V44A, D117G, E128G, F149S, or D153G mutation, located in EFs or their vicinity (Fig. 1C). Four of six types of SloDK mutations consisted of an Asp or Glu to Gly substitution at the end of EF1-3. These mutations presumably affect EF Ca2+ affinity, but they also increase the flexibility of the EF peptide bond to its neighboring α-helix. Detailed characterization of the decay kinetics and Ca2+ sensitivity of SloDK mutants will be reported elsewhere. The large standard deviation of luminescence amplitudes obtained for WT aequorin (Fig. 1A) suggested that screening stringency was too low to accurately select Bright mutants. This was confirmed by the occurrence of WT aequorin among selected Bright clones (n = 2 of 14 clones sequenced). This prompted us to perform two additional rounds of DNA shuffling and screening aimed at segregating Bright mutants by in vitro evolution. The 40 Bright mutants showing the highest L0-4 activity were used for the next round of shuffling-screening (see “Materials and Methods”). Two additional rounds were performed, with 19,100 and 17,859 clones screened in the second and third rounds, respectively. Fig. 1B shows that two mutations, K17R and Q168R, selected during the in vitro evolution process, eventually combined and spread to be present in 33 of 34 Bright clones selected at the third round. The mean activity of the population increased concomitantly with the relative occurrence of the K17R and Q168R mutations. Consistently, the highest activity was found in the double K17R/Q168R Bright mutant that showed a 25 ± 9-fold higher activity than WT in our bacterial system (TABLE TWO), indicating that successful adaptation of aequorin to bacterial expression occurred during in vitro evolution. Other Bright mutations obtained were V25A, V25I, N26D, H27N, and L170I. TABLE TWO describes their relative activities versus WT aequorin, either as single mutants or in combinations found in selected mutants. All Bright mutations were observed in at least two independently selected clones, with V25A showing the lowest occurrence (n = 2). The mean number of Bright mutations per molecule increased during in vitro evolution to reach 2.26 at the third round (TABLE ONE), with K17R and N26D remaining as the only single Bright mutations in third round mutants selected. In contrast with N26D and H27N that persisted throughout the in vitro evolution process, the V25A and V25I mutations disappeared at the third round suggesting a lower efficiency, at least in combination with other mutations. The increasing number of silent mutations found in selected clones suggests that further mutations were introduced at each round of shuffling (TABLE ONE). Nonetheless, the frequency of other-than-Bright amino acid substitutions remained roughly stable (TABLE ONE), showing that the mutational load was eliminated during in vitro evolution, presumably because of deleterious effects on bioluminescence.TABLE TWORelative bioluminescence in bacteria of Bright mutants compared with that of WT aequorinBright mutationI0-4 activity/WTK17R13 ± 2 (n = 21)V25A10 ± 2 (n = 3)N26D13 ± 2 (n = 16)H27N18 ± 3 (n = 5)Q168R11 ± 3 (n = 6)L170I16 ± 4 (n = 4)K17R + N26D14 ± 2 (n = 8)K17R + Q168R25 ± 9 (n = 22)K17R + L170I8 ± 2 (n = 8)V25I + Q168R20 ± 8 (n = 3)V25I + L170I24 ± 3 (n = 4)N26D + Q168R8 ± 1 (n = 16)H27N + Q168R13 ± 5 (n = 4)K17R + N26D + Q168R14 ± 3 (n = 8)K17R + H27N + Q168R11 ± 2 (n = 12)KR + HN + QR + LI14 ± 3 (n = 4) Open table in a new tab Bright mutations of aequorin were all found in EF1 or close to coelenterazine binding residues (Fig. 1C). Indeed, the K17R mutation was flanked by His-16 and Met-19, which are coelenterazine binding residues. Similarly, the Q168R and L170I mutations were located within an α-helix containing a cluster of residues (Met-165, Thr-166, His-169, and Trp-173) that bind coelenterazine (11Head J.F. Inouye S. Teranishi K. Shimomura O. Nature. 2000; 405: 372-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The K17R, N26D, Q168R, and L170I substitutions affected residues conserved among members of the calcium-activated photoprotein family (31Fagan T.F. Ohmiya Y. Blinks J.R. Inouye S. Tsuji F.I. FEBS Lett. 1993; 333: 301-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 32Illarionov B.A. Bondar V.S. Illarionova V.A. Vysotski E.S.

In contrast with SloDK mutants, no amino acid substitution expected to decrease EF affinity was observed in the Bright mutants. The distribution of other-than-Bright amino acid substitutions found in selected Bright mutants delineated mutation-free regions of apoaequorin (Fig. 1C) in which modification may be deleterious to bioluminescence. In particular, none of the coelenterazine binding residues (11Head J.F. Inouye S. Teranishi K. Shimomura O. Nature. 2000; 405: 372-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) or the essential Cys-145, Cys-152, or Cys-180 residues (18Tsuji F.I. Inouye S. Goto T. Sakaki Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8107-8111Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) were affected. Indeed, only 13 positions were affected by other-than-Bright substitutions, much less than the 23 silent mutations that distributed more evenly across the sequence. However, the absence of mutation in some parts of the sequence (e.g. between amino acid positions 95 and 115) suggests that amino acid substitution at all possible aequorin positions have not been explored in this study. Thermostable Shuffled Mutants—The functional properties of Bright mutants were next examined with the aim of identifying changes that may explain their increased luminescence in bacteria. Detailed characterizations of K17R, N26D, Q168R, and L170I were carried out in cell-free assays on RTS-expressed proteins (see “Materials and Methods”). None of these mutants showed a higher maximum photon yield than WT (not shown). Given large number of clones (n = 52,992) screened during in vitro evolution, this suggests that the quantum yield of WT aequorin cannot be increased by single amino acid substitutions. We first noticed that, in bacteria, the Bright mutants Q168R and L170I showed an extended lifetime at 37 °C as compared with WT (not shown), which could explain their selection by in vitro evolution. This property was confirmed in the cell-free assay (Fig. 2A). This was more prominent for the Q168R mutation, and the effects of each mutation were additive in the double Q168R/L170I mutant that retained ∼50% of its activity after 72 h at 37 °C (4 h for WT). Free energies deduced from inactivation curves of photoproteins at 37 °C were 98.7 ± 0.2, 99.9 ± 0.1, 103.6 ± 0.2, and 105.2 ± 0.3 kJ/mol for WT, L170I, Q168R, and Q168R/L170I aequorins, respectively. The K17R mutant showed a lifetime at 37 °C identical to that of WT aequorin. Thermostability was next investigated by applying a 30-min heat shock at different temperatures. Consistent with their extended lifetime, the Q168R and L170I mutants were resistant to higher temperatures than WT (Fig. 2B). This effect was more pronounced for Q168R, and the effects of each mutation were additive in the double Q168R/L170I mutant, which retained 77 ± 1% of its activity after a 54 °C heat shock (Fig. 2B). Temperatures for 50% inactivation (T50%) interpolated from thermostability curves of WT and mutant aequorins are given in TABLE THREE. The thermostabilities of the K17R and N26D mutants were identical to that of WT aequorin. The same lifetime and thermostability experiments performed on purified WT, K17R, and Q168R aequorins (see “Materials and Methods”) yielded similar results (not shown).TABLE THREETemperature for 50% inactivation of aequorin bioluminescence by a 30-min heat shockAequorinsT50%°CWT44E35G44V44A45D117G49E128G46F149S39D153G51Q168R (RHL)53L170I48Q168R + L170I (RHI)57Q168R + L170V (RHV)57Q168R + L170M (RHM)51.5Q168A + L170V (AHV)51.5Q168K + L170V (KHV)51.5 Open table in a new tab The increased stability conferred by the Q168R and L170I mutations presumably resulted from stabilization of the local aequorin structure surrounding His-169 and other C-terminal coelenterazine binding residues.

To begin to quantitate these interactions, L11 from Bacillus stearothermophilus has been overexpressed and its properties compared with those of L11-C76 alone in a fluorescence assay for protein-rRNA binding. The assay relies on 2′-amino-butyryl-pyrene-uridine incorporated in a 58-nucleotide rRNA fragment, which gives ∼15-fold enhancement when L11 or L11-C76 is bound. Although the pyrene tag weakens protein binding, unbiased protein-RNA association constants were obtained in competition experiments with untagged RNA. It was found that (i) intact B. stearothermophilus L11 binds rRNA with K ≈ 1.2 × 109 m-1 in buffers with 0.2 m KCl, about 100-fold tighter than Escherichia coli L11; (ii) the N-terminal domain makes a small, salt-dependent contribution to the overall L11-RNA binding affinity (∼8-fold enhancement at 0.2 m KCl), (iii) L11 stimulates thiostrepton binding by 2.3 ± 0.6 × 103-fold, predicting an overall thiostrepton affinity for the ribosome of ∼109 m-1, and (iv) the yeast homolog of L11 shows no stimulation of thiostrepton binding. The latter observation resolves the question of why eukaryotes are insensitive to the antibiotic. These measurements also show that it is plausible for thiostrepton to compete directly with EF-G·GDP for binding to the L11-RNA complex, and provide a quantitative basis for further studies of L11 function and thiostrepton mechanism.

L11 is associated with a highly conserved 58-nucleotide domain of large subunit ribosomal RNA (referred to here as the L11 binding domain RNA (L11 BD RNA)), 1The abbreviations used are: L11 BD RNA, nucleotides 1051-1108 of the 23 S rRNA (E. coli numbering) that constitute the minimal binding domain for protein L11; L11-NTD, N-terminal domain of L11; L11-C76, C-terminal RNA binding domain of L11; THS, thiostrepton; EF-G, elongation factor G; DTT, dithiothreitol; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropane-sulfonic acid; py-U1082; RNA, L11 BD RNA modified at position U1082 with 2′-amino-butyryl-pyrene-uridine.1The abbreviations used are: L11 BD RNA, nucleotides 1051-1108 of the 23 S rRNA (E. coli numbering) that constitute the minimal binding domain for protein L11; L11-NTD, N-terminal domain of L11; L11-C76, C-terminal RNA binding domain of L11; THS, thiostrepton; EF-G, elongation factor G; DTT, dithiothreitol; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropane-sulfonic acid; py-U1082; RNA, L11 BD RNA modified at position U1082 with 2′-amino-butyryl-pyrene-uridine. which constitutes a “knob” on the surface of the large subunit (4Schmidt F.J.

A C-terminal domain of the protein, L11-C76, sits in the distorted minor groove of the L11 BD RNA (Fig. 1), binds the folded RNA with high affinity (8Conn G.L. Draper D.E. Lattman E.E. Gittis A.G. Science. 1999; 284: 1171-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 9Xing Y. GuhaThakurta D. Draper D.E. Nat. Struct.

Biochemical evidence and direct observation by cryoelectron microscopy have suggested that the N-terminal domain of L11 (L11-NTD) occupies different positions during the ribosome cycle and variously contacts elongation factor G (EF-G) (11Agrawal R.K. Linde J. Sengupta J. Nierhaus K.H. Frank J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 777-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), release factors 1 and 2 (12Tate W.P. McCaughan K.K. Ward C.D. Sumpter V.G.

Genet. 1976; 144: 111-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). E. coli cells lacking L11-NTD (i.e. having only L11-C76) grow 2-fold more slowly than wild type (13Van Dyke N. Murgola E.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 9-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). It thus appears that both domains of L11 are important for optimum ribosome function, one domain stabilizing a necessary tertiary structure and the other promoting the function of protein factors.The functional importance of the L11-RNA region of the ribosome is also suggested by the fact that it is a target for the thiazole class of antibiotics. The best studied of these, thiostrepton, binds to ribosomal RNA fragments with affinities on the order of 106 m-1 (6Ryan P.C. Lu M. Draper D.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 1257-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 16Draper D.E. Xing Y. Laing L. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), although its affinity for rRNA is greatly stimulated when the N-terminal domain of L11 is present (17Xing Y. Draper D.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1581-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Structure probing and NMR studies place thiostrepton near the hairpin loop containing A1067 (Fig. 1), but structural details of the thiostrepton-L11-rRNA complex are unresolved (10Bowen W.S.

Whether thiostrepton inhibits translation by competing with EF-G for ribosome binding or by stabilizing an EF-G·ribosome complex is also unresolved; there is experimental support for each model (20Rodnina M.V.

An additional intriguing question is why eukaryotic ribosomes are insensitive to thiostrepton, an observation that has variously been attributed to rRNA sequence differences (23Uchiumi T. Wada A. Kominami R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29889-29893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) or occlusion of the ribosome thiostrepton binding site by the eukaryotic L11 homolog (24Thompson J. Musters W. Cundliffe E. Dahlberg A.E. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1499-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar).To enable quantitative studies of the roles of L11 in ribosome function, we have begun to characterize N-terminal domain interactions with ribosome components. Here we describe the development of a fluorescence assay that allows accurate measurement of RNA affinities for L11 or L11-C76 under a wide variety of solution conditions and in the presence or absence of thiostrepton. Using this assay, we show that the bacterial L11-NTD contributes a small, salt-dependent free energy to L11-rRNA binding affinities, and enhances thiostrepton-rRNA interactions by factors of more than 103. This cooperative interaction does not take place with a eukaryotic L11 homolog, which accounts for the resistance of eukaryotic ribosomes to the drug.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBuffers and Materials—The standard buffer for the various titration experiments was 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 5% Me2SO, and the indicated concentration of KCl in mm; e.g. M5K200D contains 200 mm KCl. 1 mm DTT was also present in all titrations that included L11.Thiostrepton was purchased from Calbiochem. Stock solutions were made in Me2SO using an extinction coefficient of 0.027 cm-1 μm-1 at 280 nm (25Ryan P.C. Draper D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6308-6312Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To obtain reproducible titration data, solutions were made fresh on the day of use. The identity of the sample was confirmed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry in positive mode.Cloning and Purification of BstL11—BstL11 was cloned from genomic DNA in two steps. First, the portion of the B. stearothermophilus genome containing the conserved gene cluster rpmG-secE-nusG-rplK-rplA was PCR-amplified and cloned. The following DNA oligomers were designed and synthesized: GT(G,C)AA(C,T)AT(C,T)AC(A,C,G)(C,T)TGGC(G,C)TG(C,T)AC(A,C,G)GA(A,G)TG(C,T)GG, on the basis of a conserved amino acid sequence of L33 (rpmG), and AAACGTGACCGTGCGGGTTTTCGG, based on a known segment of rplA. 2W. Liu and D. E. Draper, unpublished observations. 30 rounds of PCR were performed using Taq polymerase. The PCR product was purified by extraction from a 1% agarose gel and ligated into TOPO TA plasmid (Invitrogen). The L11 gene was sequenced from the TOPO plasmid, and a PCR fragment containing the L11 coding sequence was cloned into a T7 promoter-based expression plasmid, pMFT, using NdeI and BamHI restriction sites (26Chen J. Li Y. Wang E. Wang Y. Protein Expr. Purif. 1999; 15: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar).To purify BstL11, a single colony of BL21(DE3) transformed with the pMFT L11 expression plasmid was grown to mid-log phase in 1 liter of broth, induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and harvested 4 h later. The cells were resuspended in 20 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, with 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 100 μm benzamidine added as protease inhibitors) and lysed by three passes through a French Press at 750 p.s.i. L11 was found in the supernatant after pelleting cell debris. The supernatant was dialyzed against 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.0, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm benzamidine, and 0.1 mm PMSF at 4 °C. The dialyzed protein was loaded onto a sulfopropyl cation exchange high performance liquid chromatography column (21.5 × 150 mm TSK SP-5PW; ToyoHaas) and eluted with a 500-ml gradient of 0-200 mm KCl in dialysis buffer without the protease inhibitors. Protein was dialyzed into 10 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 3 mm MgCl2,50mm KCl, 1 mm DTT and stored at -80 °C. A single cysteine in the L11 N-terminal domain causes dimerization of the protein if adequate concentrations of a reducing agent are not present. The overall yield was ∼30 mg of protein from 1 liter of cell culture; no impurities could be detected on a heavily over-loaded SDS gel.Protein concentration was determined by absorbance at 230 nm using an extinction coefficient of 45 × 103 m-1 cm-1, based on an average extinction per peptide bond (27Jensen D.E. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 7198-7214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and on quantatitive nitrogen analysis (AAA Service Laboratory, Inc., Boring, OR). The C-terminal RNA binding domain of BstL11, L11-C76, was purified as described (17Xing Y. Draper D.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1581-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar).Cloning and Purification of Saccharomyces cerevisiae L11 homolog—The S. cerevisiae gene rpl12A was amplified from yeast DNA by PCR and cloned into the inducible expression vector pET11a (Novagen). Upon transformation into BL21(DE3) cells and induction of T7 RNA polymerase with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, the protein was expressed at moderate levels but remained insoluble. The crude protein was redissolved in buffers containing 6 m urea, 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.5, and 5 mm DTT, and purified by cation exchange chromatography as described for BstL11, with the exceptions that the salt gradient was run from 0 to 400 mm KCl and the ion exchange buffers contained 6 m urea.Purified protein was stored at -80 °C in the same buffer used for redissolving the protein from cell lysates. Before use in RNA binding experiments, it was diluted 10-fold with the buffer of interest and warmed at 37 °C for 30 min. The protein is fully active in binding its rRNA target; a more detailed account of its rRNA binding properties will be reported elsewhere. 3E. Poliakova and D. E. Draper, manuscript in preparation. The naming of ribosomal proteins is not consistent between bacteria and eukaryotes. To avoid confusion with the acidic ribosomal protein also called L12, here we call the S. cerevisiae L11 homolog yL11.Fluorescence Titrations—An RNA fragment based on nucleotides 1051-1108 of the E. coli 23 S rRNA sequence was synthesized and purified by Dharmacon Research, Inc. (Lafayette, CO). The RNA sequence contained the stabilizing mutation U1061A (28Lu M. Draper D.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 572-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and a modified nucleoside, 2′-amino-butyryl-pyrene-uridine, at U1082 (py-U1082 RNA). Unlabeled RNA of the same sequence (U1061A RNA) was transcribed from a plasmid DNA template by phage T7 RNA polymerase and purified by gel electrophoresis as described (29Conn G.L. Gutell R.R. Draper D.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11980-11988Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Before use, RNAs were heated in renaturation buffer (10 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 20 mm MgCl2, 175 mm KCl) at 65 °C for 5 min and then cooled to 25 °C for 15 min.Buffers used for fluorescence experiments contained 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, various concentrations of MgCl2 and KCl, 1 mm DTT, 5% Me2SO, and 0.4 μm ovalbumin (Sigma). Ovalbumin was necessary to prevent loss of L11 or L11-C76 on the cuvette walls. Measurements were performed on an Aviv Instruments ATF105 fluorimeter. Pyrene fluorescence was monitored with an excitation wavelength of 345 nm and an emission of 395 nm. All titrations reported here were conducted at 25 °C in 1 × 1-cm cuvettes. For binding studies with only L11 or L11-C76, the sample was incubated with stirring for 10 min between protein additions. Fluorescence binding data were fit to hyperbolic binding isotherms with the equilibrium constant and fluorescence intensity of the protein-RNA complex as variables (30Draper D.E. Deckman I.C. Vartikar J.V. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 164: 203-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).For binding studies with L11 and thiostrepton, a fixed concentration of thiostrepton, usually 7 nm, was present during the titration. For the first data points, the increase in fluorescence intensity was monitored for 30 min after addition of protein. After the RNA became ∼50% saturated with protein, this time was reduced to 15 min. The time course of fluorescence increase was fit to a first-order rate equation; each fluorescence intensity point on the equilibrium binding curve was calculated from an extrapolated of the rate equation to infinite time. Thiostrepton alone had no effect on py-U1082 RNA fluorescence in control titrations.In the course of these titrations, three complexes between RNA, thiostrepton, and L11 are potentially formed, as shown by the Schemes I and II equilibria under “Results.” The polynomial expression that relates the concentrations of these different species to equilibrium constants and initial conditions cannot be solved for the fraction of RNA bound to L11 as a function of added protein. To generate equilibrium binding curves for comparison with titration data, a quadratic equation derived from the mass action and mass conservation equations was solved to give the free concentration of thiostrepton as a function of the equilibrium constants, total concentrations of thiostrepton and RNA, and various free concentrations of L11. The corresponding free concentrations of thiostrepton and L11 were then substituted in a binding polynomial describing all possible complexes of free and bound RNA, from which the fraction of RNA bound to L11 (with or without thiostrepton) was calculated. This latter value was then used to find the total L11 concentration supporting the calculated extent of RNA binding. These calculations were conveniently carried out in a spreadsheet on which a range of free L11 concentrations could be chosen to generate a binding curve over the appropriate range of total L11 concentrations for a particular titration.The low solubility of thiostrepton prompted us to measure the maximum concentration that could be achieved under our experimental conditions. To do this, a concentrated stock of thiostrepton in Me2SO was diluted with stirring into M5K200D buffer (5% final Me2SO concentration) to a nominal concentration of 20 μm. Although the solution appeared clear to the eye, light scattering was detectable in the spectrometer or fluorimeter. After stirring for 2 h at room temperature, the solution was centrifuged. The absorbance of the supernatant indicated that 5 μm thiostrepton remained soluble.Salt-back Titrations and Data Analysis—The salt dependence of either L11 or L11-C76 affinities for py-U1082 RNA was determined by salt-back titrations, in which the pre-formed protein-RNA complex was titrated with KCl while keeping other buffer components constant. The fluorescence at each point defines the binding constant at that salt concentration, provided that the fluorescence intensities of the protein-RNA complex and the unbound RNA, which may vary with salt concentration, are known. Control titrations of py-U1082 RNA alone showed that there is a negligible change in the pyrene fluorescence as salt is added. To correct for potential salt dependence of the protein-RNA fluorescence signal, salt-back titrations done at two or three protein:RNA ratios were analyzed simultaneously (31García-García C. Draper D.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 331: 75-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In all cases, all the curves were fit with the same salt dependence when the protein-RNA fluorescence was assumed to be independent of salt concentration.CD and UV Experiments—Circular dichroism (CD) spectra were obtained on a Jasco J-810, using 22 μm L11-C76 or 36 μm L11 protein in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 175 mm KCl, and 1 mm DTT.Melting experiments were performed on a Cary 400 spectrophotometer at a heating rate of 0.8 °C/min and RNA concentration of ∼1 μm as previously described (29Conn G.L. Gutell R.R. Draper D.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11980-11988Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 32Laing L.G. Draper D.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 237: 560-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Py-U1082 RNA or U1061A RNA were renatured before use as described above for fluorescence titrations. 1 μm L11-C76 was included in some experiments. The buffer for all melting experiments was 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 3 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl.RESULTSCloning and Purification of L11—The L11 gene from B. stearothermophilus was previously cloned and expressed (17Xing Y. Draper D.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1581-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) based on a sequence of ribosome-purified protein reported by the Wittman-Liebold laboratory (33Liljas A. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1991; 124: 103-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In alignments of eubacterial L11 homologs, this protein was unique in its lack of approximately eight amino acids at the N terminus. To see whether this was an unusual feature of the BstL11 protein or an error in protein sequencing, a B. stearothermophilus chromosomal DNA fragment containing the L11 gene (rplK) was cloned and sequenced; the gene in fact encodes eight N-terminal amino acids not present in the originally reported amino acid sequence (see “Experimental Procedures”). It is possible that truncation of the previously reported sequence was an artifact of protease contamination, a problem if protease inhibitors are not present during L11 purification.The full-length BstL11 was easily overexpressed and purified without the use of denaturing conditions previously required to obtain the truncated protein. The L11 CD spectrum showed a significant increase in β-sheet content, as compared with the protein missing the eight N-terminal amino acids (data not shown). Consistent with this observation, NMR studies of Thermus thermophilus L11 have suggested that there are three segments of extended strand conformation in the N-terminal domain, including residues 4-12 (34Markus M.A. Triantafillidou D. Choli-Papadopoulou T. Torchia D.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 20: 293-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of Thermatoga maritima L11 also shows a three-strand β-sheet at about the same positions, although residues 1-7 are unresolved (35Wimberly B.T. Guymon R. McCutcheon J.P. White S.W. Ramakrishnan V. Cell. 1999; 97: 491-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). It is plausible that the eight-residue truncation present in the previously described B. stearothermophilus L11 substantially destabilized the β-sheet structure of this domain.Characterization of Pyrene-labeled L11 BD RNA—The filter binding assay previously used to measure L11-RNA binding affinities cannot be used to detect L11 binding in the presence of thiostrepton, because thiostrepton itself retains the RNA fragment on filters (6Ryan P.C. Lu M. Draper D.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 1257-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). To develop an alternative assay, 2′-amino-butyryl-pyrene-uridine was introduced at position U1082 of the L11 BD RNA fragment (Fig. 1); this tagged 58-nucleotide RNA fragment is called py-U1082 RNA. U1082 was chosen because it is close to an α-helix in the C-terminal domain of RNA-bound L11 (Fig. 1B) (8Conn G.L. Draper D.E. Lattman E.E. Gittis A.G. Science. 1999; 284: 1171-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar).Py-U1082 RNA is a derivative of the U1061A variant of the E. coli 23 S rRNA, which has an unusually stable tertiary structure (8Conn G.L. Draper D.E. Lattman E.E. Gittis A.G. Science. 1999; 284: 1171-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 28Lu M. Draper D.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 572-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Py-U1082 RNA and U1061A RNA were compared in UV melting experiments to determine whether the pyrene tag disrupts the RNA structure. The unfolding of the tertiary structure in this RNA is characterized by a transition showing hyperchromicity at 260 nm but not at 280 nm (28Lu M. Draper D.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 572-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Tertiary structure in the U1061A variant is very stable and unfolds at high temperature simultaneously with some of the secondary structure (Fig. 2A). The pyrene tag has clearly destabilized the RNA: the melting profile of py-U1082 RNA is much broader than that of the U1061A RNA, and a comparison of the 260- and 280-nm melting profiles gives no evidence for the presence of a tertiary unfolding transition (Fig. 2A). However, melting of py-U1082 RNA in the presence of L11-C76 shows a transition at about 50 °C with the expected ratio of hyperchromicities at 260 and 280 nm (Fig. 2B). In agreement with previous experiments (17Xing Y. Draper D.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1581-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), the U1061A RNA tertiary transition was also stabilized by L11-C76, although to a higher temperature than the L11-C76-py-1082U RNA complex (Fig. 2B). It thus appears that the pyrene tag destabilizes the RNA tertiary structure, but that L11-C76 can, nevertheless, bind the tagged RNA and induce correct folding of the tertiary structure. Specific L11-C76 binding was not observed when the pyrene tag was placed in the wild type E. coli sequence, which has a much less stable tertiary structure than the U1061A variant (data not shown). Presumably this RNA was too drastically misfolded or destabilized for the protein to bind well.Fig. 2UV melting profiles of py-U1082 RNA (gray) and U1061A RNA (black) in M3K100 buffer. Melting profiles are shown at two wavelengths, 260 nm (—) and 280 nm (- - -). A, py-U1082 RNA or U1061A RNA alone.

An ∼15-fold enhancement in the intensity of pyrene fluorescence is seen with either protein. Competition experiments were performed to determine the degree to which the pyrene tag perturbs L11 or L11-C76 binding to the 1051-1108 rRNA fragment. Titrations of equal concentrations of U1061A RNA and py-U1082 RNA with the proteins are shown in Fig. 4 for buffer containing 700 mm KCl; similar experiments were also done at 200 mm KCl (Table I). A lag at the beginning of the titration curves indicates preferential binding of the proteins to unlabeled U1061A RNA. The titrations in buffer containing 700 mm KCl were fit by theoretical curves that assume 8-fold greater protein affinity for U1061A RNA over py-U1082 RNA (see “Experimental Procedures”). At lower salt the preference of the proteins for unlabeled RNA is ∼20-fold. Because the pyrene tag destabilizes the RNA tertiary structure that is recognized by L11, weaker protein binding to py-1082 RNA was expected. The diminished effect of the tag at higher salt concentration is consistent with salt stabilizing the correctly folded RNA structure. The fact that L11 and L11-C76 binding affinities are weakened to the same degree suggests that the tag does not affect any interactions of the L11 N-terminal domain with RNA.Fig. 3Representative fluorescence binding curve of L11 (•) or L11-C76 (○) to py-U1082 RNA in M5K700D.

The expression of putative target genes in a physiologic range of transcription factor concentration, however, is often not examined. Heterozygous Nkx2-5 knockout (Nkx2-5+/-) mice have no more than half-normal levels of Nkx2-5 protein. We therefore measured the mRNA expression of four putative targets of the cardiac transcription factor Nkx2-5 in wild-type and Nkx2-5+/- animals in a variety of developmental and pathologic states. Wild-type and Nkx2-5+/- embryonic hearts expressed similar levels of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), the RNA helicase Csm, and homeodomain only protein HOP. In the failing adult ventricle, ANF and BNP were up-regulated to the same extent in wild-type and Nkx2-5+/- myocardium. Csm and HOP were down-regulated in heart failure, and Nkx2-5+/- hearts expressed about half-normal levels in healthy and failing states. No consistent relationship existed between the expression of putative transcriptional targets and Nkx2-5 gene dosage in the physiologically relevant range. Any dependence of gene expression on Nkx2-5 gene dosage is affected by factors specific to the individual gene and the physiologic context."

The RuvAB complex utilizes the energy of ATP hydrolysis to promote branch migration of Holliday junctions. The crystal structure of RuvB from Thermus thermophilus (Tth) HB8 showed that each RuvB monomer has three domains (N, M, and C). This study is a structure-function analysis of the three domains of RuvB. The results show that domain N is involved in RuvA-RuvB and RuvB-RuvB subunit interactions, domains N and M are required for ATP hydrolysis and ATP binding-induced hexamer formation, and domain C plays an essential role in DNA binding. The side chain of Arg-318 is essential for DNA binding and may directly interact with DNA. The data also provide evidence that coordinated ATP-dependent interactions between domains N, M, and C play an essential role during formation of the RuvAB Holliday junction ternary complex.

Homologous recombination enhances genetic diversity, contributes to genomic stability, and plays an important role in DNA repair. In prokaryotes, RuvA, RuvB, and RuvC proteins process a central intermediate of homologous recombination, the Holliday junction, in a late stage of homologous recombination (1Holliday R. Genet.

RuvB samples contained intact RuvB, RuvB-N, or RuvB-NM. The truncated RuvBs containing RuvB-M, RuvB-MC, and RuvB-C were applied to a Superdex-75 column. Protein peaks were monitored by absorbance at the wavelengths 225 and 280 nm. The assay to examine RuvB hexamer formation was carried out as described previously (27Hishida T. Iwasaki H. Yagi T.

The linear glycerol gradient from 15 to 35% in the same buffer as that used for gel filtration. Marker proteins for molecular size, Stokes' radii, and sedimentation coefficiency were as follows: aldolase (158 kDa, 48.1 Å, 7.6 S), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa, 35.5 Å, 4.31 S), ovalbumin (43 kDa, 30.5 Å, 3.66 S), chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa, 20.9 Å, 2.55 S), ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa, 16.4 Å), and aprotinin (6.5 kDa). For calculation of native molecular sizes by the Siegel-Montry equation (33Siegel L.M. Monty K.J. Biochim. Biophys.

Kunishima N. Mayanagi K. Ohnishi T. Nishino T. Iwasaki H. Shinagawa H. Morikawa K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1442-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A) and each of these domains may have distinct or overlapping functional and/or structural roles in RuvB. The role(s) of each RuvB domain was examined using ruvB mutants that lack one or more of these domains (Fig. 1B). These mutants are called RuvB-N, -NM, -M, -MC, and -C, where the letter indicates the intact domain(s) of the truncated variant. RuvB mutants were tested for complementation of the DNA repair deficiency of E. coli strain HRS2300 (ΔruvB) and for dominant negative character in wild-type AB1157 at 37 or 26 °C. Repair deficiency was assayed by treating wild type and mutant cells with or without UV irradiation. Truncated mutants were expressed in vivo from high copy number expression plasmids constructed with vector pAF101 (see “Experimental Procedures”).Fig. 1, C and D, shows the characteristics of each RuvB truncation mutant. None of the RuvB truncation mutants complemented the UV light sensitivity phenotype of ΔruvB at 37 or 26 °C (Fig. 1C), but the positive control (wild-type RuvB) did complement the DNA repair defect. In addition, RuvB-N and RuvB-NM demonstrated dominant negative effects on wild-type cells, and the dominant negative phenotype was more severe at 26 than at 37 °C (Fig. 1D). The dominant negative phenotype was stronger in cells overexpressing RuvB-NM than in cells overexpressing RuvB-N. RuvB-M, RuvB-MC, and RuvB-C had no dominant negative effects on wild-type cells at 37 or 26 °C.Domain Requirements for RuvB ATPase—To examine the biochemical properties of the mutant RuvB proteins, truncated RuvB mutants were purified by affinity chromatography as GST fusion proteins. After affinity chromatography, the recombinant RuvB moiety was separated from the GST moiety using precision protease cleavage of the fusion protein linker. When overexpressed in E. coli at 37 °C, RuvB-NM and RuvB-N were largely insoluble. However, the solubility of these proteins was significantly higher when they were overexpressed at 26 instead of 37 °C (data not shown), suggesting that the mutant proteins may fold incorrectly at the higher temperature. This result is consistent with the observation that the dominant negative effects of RuvB-NM and RuvB-N are more severe at 26 than at 37 °C.RuvB ATPase activity is required for RuvAB-catalyzed branch migration at Holliday junctions. RuvB ATPase is stimulated by the addition of RuvA or DNA and simultaneous addition of RuvA and DNA synergistically activates the RuvB ATPase (9Iwasaki H. Takahagi M. Nakata A. Shinagawa H.

Unlike wild-type RuvB, RuvB-NM ATPase is stimulated equally by RuvA or RuvA-DNA and is not stimulated by DNA alone. RuvB-NM also has a temperature-sensitive ATPase that is much weaker than the ATPase of wild-type RuvB at 37 °C, but equivalent to the basal wild-type ATPase at 26 °C (Fig. 2B). This result may reflect the higher solubility of RuvB-NM at 26 than at 37 °C. RuvB-N, -M, -MC, and -C had no detectable ATPase activity at 26 °C (Fig. 2C), suggesting that domains N and M are each required but neither is sufficient for RuvB ATPase.Fig. 2ATPase activity of wild-type RuvB and the truncated RuvB mutants. A, ATPase assays were carried out in the presence of 1 μm wild-type RuvB or RuvB-NM in the absence of DNA and RuvA (diamond), in the presence of 0.6 μm RuvA (square), in the presence of 100 μm (nucleotide moles) supercoiled DNA (triangle) or in the presence of RuvA and supercoiled DNA (circle) for the indicated times at 37 °C. B, reactions were carried out in the presence of 1 μm wild-type RuvB, or RuvB-NM in the absence of DNA and RuvA for 60 min at 37 or at 26 °C. Ratio of ATPase activity of RuvB-NM relative to those of wild-type RuvB are shown. The actual values of ATP hydrolysis determined for the wild-type controls at 37 and 26 °C were 1.8 and 0.8 nm, respectively. C, reactions were carried out in the presence of 1 μm wild-type or truncated RuvB mutants in the absence of DNA and RuvA at 26 °C. The data are means of at least three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Domain Requirements for RuvB Branch Migration—The capacity of RuvB truncation mutants to carry out branch migration in vitro was assessed using a synthetic Holliday junction as a substrate. Wild-type RuvB dissociated the Holliday junction efficiently at 26 °C in the presence of ATP and RuvA; in contrast, none of the RuvB truncation mutants were capable of promoting branch migration or dissociating the synthetic Holliday junction under identical conditions (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, RuvB-N and RuvB-NM inhibited wild-type RuvAB-catalyzed branch migration (Fig. 3B, lanes h-t). This result may reflect the same mechanism that leads to the dominant negative phenotype of RuvB-N and RuvB-NM with respect to repair of UV-induced DNA damage in vivo.Fig. 3Branch migration activity of truncated RuvB mutants. A, RuvB was incubated at various concentration (50, 100, and 200 nm) with a synthetic Holliday junction (10 nm in Holliday junction moles) and 50 nm RuvA. Reactions were carried out at 26 °C for 30 min. The reaction products were analyzed by 9% PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. WT, wild type. B, inhibition of branch migration activity of wild-type RuvB by the truncated RuvB mutants. Branch migration activity was assayed by incubating 10 nm synthetic Holliday junctions (HJ) with 50 nm RuvA and the indicated concentration of RuvB.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Interaction between Truncated RuvB Mutants and RuvA—The capacity of RuvB truncation mutants to interact with RuvA was examined using gel filtration analysis in the presence or absence of ATP and Mg2+. In the absence of ATP and Mg2+, RuvA, wild-type RuvB and the RuvAB complex eluted at positions of 120, 100, and 280 kDa (Fig. 4A), respectively (27Hishida T. Iwasaki H. Yagi T. Shinagawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25335-25342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). RuvB-N eluted at 70 kDa and the RuvB-N complex with RuvA eluted at 190 kDa (Fig. 4B). RuvB-NM eluted at 90 kDa and the RuvB-NM complex with RuvA eluted at 250 kDa (Fig. 4C). These results indicate that RuvB-N and RuvB-NM form complexes with RuvA. RuvB-M, RuvB-MC, and RuvB-C eluted at 6.7, 6.9, and 5.8 kDa, which may correspond to their predicted molecular sizes of 8, 17, and 9 kDa, suggesting that these proteins probably exist in solution as monomers. The elution of RuvB-MC at 6.9 kDa seems somewhat anomalous; however, the sedimentation coefficiency of RuvB-MC was estimated to be 2.24 S, which predicts a native molecular size of 12 kDa (data not shown). RuvB-MC may take a structure deviated from a sphere in solution. None of the three RuvB truncation mutants, RuvB-M, RuvB-MC, and RuvB-C, showed any shift in the elution positions by the addition of RuvA (Fig. 4, D-F), indicating that they do not form complexes with RuvA.Fig. 4Interaction of the truncated RuvB mutants with RuvA. RuvB was incubated with RuvA in the absence of ATP and Mg2+ and analyzed by gel filtration. Gel filtration chromatography of wild-type (WT) RuvB (A), RuvB-N (B), and RuvB-NM (C) was performed with Superdex-200. Blue dextran (void volume), ferritin (440 kDa), catalase (252 kDa) aldorase (158 kDa), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), and chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa) were eluted at 31.2, 38.6, 43.8, 47.0, 53.1, and 61.4 min, respectively. Gel filtration chromatography of RuvB-M (D), RuvB-MC (E), and RuvB-C (F) was performed with Superdex-75. Blue dextran (void volume), ovalbumin (43 kDa), chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa), ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa), and aprotinin (6.5 kDa) were eluted at 30.5, 35.5, 43.4, 46.0, and 55.7 min, respectively. The gel filtration profiles (Superdex-200) of truncated RuvB mutants in the presence of 10 mm MgCl2 and 0.25 mm ATP are shown in (G).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Domain N Is Required for RuvB-RuvB Intersubunit Interaction—The results of gel filtration analysis of RuvB, RuvB-N, and RuvB-NM indicate that they form oligomers larger than a monomer. Previous sedimentation analysis indicated that RuvB exists as a dimer in the absence of ATP and Mg2+ (35Shiba T. Iwasaki H. Nakata A. Shinagawa H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 237: 395-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Glycerol gradient sedimentation analysis was used here to calculate the native molecular size of RuvB truncation variants by the method of Siegel and Monty (33Siegel L.M. Monty K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 112: 346-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar) (Table I). These data indicate that RuvB, RuvB-N, and RuvB-NM form dimers with the calculated native molecular sizes of 74, 39, and 59 kDa, respectively. These results suggest that domain N includes an interface required for RuvB dimer formation in the absence of ATP and Mg2+.Table IEstimation of the molecular mass of RuvB mutantsStokes' radiusaK"
https://openalex.org/W1996853613,"Neural stem cells (NSCs) obtained from the midbrain region of embryonic (E14) mice were initially cultured with basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), Sonic hedgehog, and FGF-8 in a serum-free N-2 culture medium to foster differentiation into a serotonergic-like phenotype. During the initial differentiating phase, these progenitor cells expressed En1, Pax3, and Pax5 mRNA. Subsequently, a single serotonin [5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)] and tryptophan hydroxylase-positive clone was isolated, which gave rise to cells that developed serotonergic properties. Sixty percent of these progenitor cells expressed the serotonin transporter (SERT), as indicated by specific ligand binding of [125I]-RTI-55. To further evaluate SERT functionality, we showed that these progenitor cells possessed specific [3H]-5-HT uptake activity. Implantation of the serotonergic-like progenitors into the hippocampus of adult mice genetically lacking SERT was followed by migration of these cells into adjacent brain regions, and survival of the cells at 8 weeks was accompanied by a gradual increase in density of SERT protein expression, which was not found in vehicle-injected, control mice. These findings suggest that this serotonergic-like NSC model will be a useful contribution to the development of cell biotechnology in regard to the expression of missing genes such as SERT in the adult brain."
https://openalex.org/W2025721662,"Bovine leukemia virus (BLV) <i>tax</i> is an essential gene involved in the transcriptional activation of viral expression. Tax is also believed to be implicated in leukemogenesis because of its ability to immortalize primary cells <i>in vitro</i>. To gain insight into the molecular pathways mediating the activities of this important gene, we identified cellular proteins interacting with Tax. By means of a two-hybrid approach, we show that Tax specifically interacts with MSX2, a general repressor of gene expression. GST pull-down experiments and co-immunoprecipitation assays further confirmed binding specificity. Furthermore, the N-terminal residues 1-79 of MSX2 are required for binding, whereas the C-terminal residues 201-267 of MSX2 do not play a critical role. Whereas the oncogenic potential of Tax in primary cells was only slightly affected by overexpression of MSX2, the other function of Tax, namely LTR-dependent transcriptional activation, was inhibited by MSX2 in human HeLa and bovine B-lymphoblastoid (BL3) cell lines. This MSX2 repression function can be counteracted by overexpression of transcription factors CREB2 and RAP74. The Tax/MSX2 interplay thus results in repression of viral transcriptional activation possibly acting as a regulatory feedback loop. Importantly, this viral gene silencing is not strictly associated with a concomitant loss of Tax oncogenicity as measured by its ability to immortalize primary cells. And interestingly, MSX2 also interacts with and inhibits the transactivation function of the related Tax1 protein encoded by the Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1)."
https://openalex.org/W2019703377,"The Michaelis constant (Km) and Vmas (E0kcat) values for two mutant sets of enzymes were studied from the viewpoint of their definition in a rapid equilibrium reaction model and in a steady state reaction model. The “AMP set enzyme” had a mutation at the AMP-binding site (Y95F, V67I, and V67I/L76V), and the “ATP set enzyme” had a mutation at a possible ATP-binding region (Y32F, Y34F, and Y32A/Y34A). Reaction rate constants obtained using steady state model analysis explained discrepancies found by the rapid equilibrium model analysis. (i) The unchanged number of bound AMPs for Y95F and the wild type despite the markedly increased Km values for AMP of the AMP set of enzymes was explained by alteration of the rate constants of the AMP step (k+2, k–2) to retain the ratio k+2/k–2. (ii) A 100 times weakened selectivity of ATP for Y34F in contrast to no marked changes in Km values for both ATP and AMP for the ATP set of enzymes was explained by the alteration of the rate constants of the ATP steps. A similar alteration of the Km and kcat values of these enzymes resulted from distinctive alterations of their rate constants. The pattern of alteration was highly suggestive. The most interesting finding was that the rate constants that decided the Km and kcat values were replaced by the mutation, and the simple relationships between Km, kcat, and the rate constants of Km1=k+1/k-1 and kcat = kf were not valid.

Adenylate kinase (ADK) 1The abbreviation used is: ADK, adenylate kinase. 1The abbreviation used is: ADK, adenylate kinase. is a two-substrate enzyme, ATP and AMP, and acts by a random Bi Bi mechanism. One Vmax and four Km values can be determined for ADK reactions for many mutant enzyme reactions but do not give consistent explanations of the relationship between mutational cause and effects (1Yan H.

By using this assumption, enzyme reactions must fulfill conditions that are markedly restrictive; the minimum condition is the presence of a rate-limiting step and a high value of a rate constant corresponding to Km values. Whether the required conditions by using a rapid equilibrium assumption are fulfilled is not clear. Therefore, by using an analysis based on the work by Briggs and Haldane (6Briggs G.E. Haldane J.B.S. Biochem. J. 1925; 19: 338-339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the assumption of the steady state condition is disputed. The analysis of this study has no restriction on rate constants and is more generally applicable, so the analysis of the ADK mutant reactions by the two methods and a comparison of the results will give a consistent view of Km and kcat values, and their alteration with mutations as far as the problem is with the rate constants.In this study, two groups of mutant enzymes were used for the following reasons. ADK catalyzes the transfer of the γ-phosphate group of ATP to α-phosphate of AMP or vice versa. Two nucleotide-binding sites, one for AMP and the other for ATP, have been assigned on the basis of three-dimensional structures found by using x-ray crystallography (7Schultz G.E. Elzinga M. Marx F.

The assigned site for AMP is near Tyr-95, and the ATP site is assigned near Arg-128 of yeast ADK (17Müller C.W. Schulz G.E. J. Mol.

Type I ADK, including porcine muscle-type enzymes, has no such site corresponding to Arg-128 in the yeast enzyme. Thus, the assignment of the ATP-binding site in type I ADK is an issue to be clarified. As with many enzymes (19Bedouelle H. Carter P. Waye M.M. Winter G. Lowe D.M. Wilkinson A.J. Fersht A.R.

Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1577-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), a mutant enzyme in which residues are replaced by other residues is an effective tool to identify the role of a residue in enzymatic functions. To explore the binding processes of ATP and AMP, two sets of mutants for the two binding sites were chosen. 1) For an AMP site mutant set (Y95F, V67I, and V67I/L76V), Tyr-95 is replaced by Phe, because Tyr-95 has been assumed to participate in the binding of one of the substrates, and Leu-76 and Val-67 are near the active site Tyr-95. 2) For a possible ATP-binding region mutant set (Y32F, Y34F, and Y32A/Y34A), Tyr-32 and Tyr-34 are replaced by Phe or both by Ala, because these Tyr are in the cleft where the hydrophobic substance binds, such as the ATP analogue 1-anilino-8-naphthalene sulfonate (23Radda G.K. Samadi D.R. Current Topics in Bioenergetics. 4. Academic Press, New York1971: 81-126Google Scholar, 24Augustin J. Hasselbach W. Eur. J.

Biochem. 1974; 49: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The ATP-binding site of this study is not the currently determined one but was chosen because the site was once suggested to be a binding site of AMP (26Pai E.F. Sachenheimer W. Schirmer R.H. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 114: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) and also to be a site of ATP (12Fry D.C. Kuby S.A. Mildvan A.S.

A. 1986; 83: 907-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). If these residues participate in substrate binding, the kinetic behavior of the mutants would be different from the wild type enzyme and should be discriminated among kinetic parameters.The advantage of kinetic measurements is that the dynamic aspect of an enzyme molecule is given by kinetic parameters, and the events not included in its activity are automatically omitted. The importance of the linkage between dynamics and enzyme catalysis was indicated in a recent study of adenylate kinase (27Watz M.W. Thai V. Wildman K.H. Hadjipavlou G. Eisenmesser E.Z. Kern D. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 945-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Kinetic parameters should be those that can describe the dynamic aspects of the enzyme and not the static binding of substrates. The results of the analysis of the two mutant sets by using rapid equilibrium and steady state methods are discussed, and their comparison shows advantages and disadvantages of each method.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—The enzyme was ADK in porcine skeletal muscle obtained as a recombinant protein by expressing its cDNA. Enzymes for gene manipulation and deoxyribonucleotides were purchased from Toyobo Co. Ltd. and Takara Shuzo Co. Ltd. Substrate nucleotide species were purchased from Sigma and Roche Applied Science. All other chemicals were purchased from Wako Pure Chemicals Co. and Nacalai Tesque Inc.Preparation of Mutants—Site-directed mutagenesis was done by using the methods described previously (28Kunkel T.A.

The primer DNAs were prepared by using high pressure liquid chromatography with a C18 reversed phase column on a 0.1–1 m KH2PO4 linear gradient system of 30% CH3CN solution and on 20% PAGE after 5′-phosphorylation.Alteration of the target nucleotide sequences was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Substitutions of amino acid residues were confirmed by amino acid composition analysis by using an automated amino acid analyzer (Beckman System 7300).Mutated ADK proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli JM109 using the pMK2 expression vector (31Hibino T. Misawa S. Wakiyama M. Maeda S. Yazaki K. Kumagai I. Ooi T. Miura K. J. Biotechnol. 1994; 32: 139-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) at 37 °C for 36 h. For Y95F, V67I, and V67I/L76V mutants, preliminary cultivation was done at 20, 25, 30, and 37 °C at various cultivation periods from 18 to 72 h. The optimal temperature and period of cultivation were 25 °C and 36 h, respectively, for Y95F mutant ADK and 30 °C and 24 h, respectively, for V67I and V67I/L76V mutant ADKs. The expressed ADK was extracted, purified, and refolded as described previously (32Barzu O. Michelson S. FEBS Lett. 1983; 153: 280-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The expressed wild type and six mutant proteins, as inclusion bodies, were obtained as a single band protein by using SDS-PAGE (18%) analysis.CD and Protein Concentration Measurements—The CD of the enzyme solution having extinction A280 = 1.0 was recorded by using a CD spectrometer (Jasco J-100) with a 1-cm light path for 250–300 nm and a 0.2-mm light path for 200–250 nm wavelength region. The molar concentration of the enzyme solution was measured with the extinction coefficient of 1.16 × 104 m–1cm–1 for the wild type. Extinction coefficients for mutant enzymes were obtained as coefficients of the wild type value multiplied by the ratio of combined extinction coefficients of amino acid residues for mutant enzymes to that for the wild type.CD spectra of the 220 nm region of Y95F and the other mutant enzymes were the same as for the wild type (data not shown). CD spectra in the 280 nm region of Y95F and the other mutant proteins lacking Tyr were less negative than for the wild type, presumably due to the substitution of Tyr by Phe. Thus, conformations of mutants had no effect due to the replacement of every target amino acid residue in the mutant enzymes.Kinetic Measurements—Kinetic measurements were done as described previously (33Agarwal K.C. Miech R.P. Parks R.E. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 51: 483-490Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar) at pH 7.0 and 25 °C. Sets of concentrations of both ATP and AMP used as substrates were as follows: 100, 150, 200, 300, 500, 800, 1000, 2000, and 5000 (μm) for the reactions of wild type enzyme; 50, 100, 150, 250, 500, 1000, and 4000 (μm) for the reactions of Y34F, Y95F, V67I, and V67I/L76V; 50, 100, 150, 200, 300, 400, 500, 700, 1000, and 4000 (μm) for Y32A/Y34A; 50, 100, 200, 300, 500, 700, 1000, 2000, and 5000 (μm) for the reactions of Y95F. Fig. 1 shows initial reaction rates but omits data that showed inhibitory effects by ATP or AMP. These reaction rates were further analyzed by using the random Bi Bi model with rapid equilibrium or steady state assumptions. For measurements of substrate specificity, reactions of many kinds of nucleotide substrates, which are described under “Results,” were analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography with a DEAE column (DEAE-2SW, TOSOH) in a 0.1-0.8 m NaH2PO4 (pH 3.0, 30% CH3CN) gradient buffer system. The experimental conditions and composition of the reaction mixture were the same as for the kinetic measurements above (34Hamada M. Kuby S.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1978; 190: 772-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), except for omitting coupling enzymes and their substrates.Applied Reaction Models and Rate Equations—Fig. 1 shows a schematic representation of the random Bi Bi model of this enzyme reaction. In the case of the rapid equilibrium model based on the rapid equilibrium assumption (35King E.L. Altman C. J. Phys. Chem. 1956; 60: 1375-1387Crossref Scopus (746) Google Scholar), the ratio k–n/k+n of the rate constants of the same step n in Fig. 1 are replaced by one Michaelis constant, Knm, and the rate constant for the chemical step, kf, is replaced by kcat. Each step is discriminated by a single decimal number, n, at the suffix of rate constants or the superfix of Michaelis constants. The rate equation of the rapid equilibrium model at a steady state is described by Equation 1 with four Michaelis constants and one Vmax, where SM and ST are the concentrations of AMP and ATP, respectively, and Vmax is equal to kcat [E]0.

The condition of the steady state is written as shown in Equation 2, ∂e→/∂t=Ae→≡0→(Eq. 2) where e→ is an enzyme species vector t([E],[ET],[EM],[ETM]), 0→ is a zero vector, and A is the transformation matrix of the reaction described in Fig. 1. A≡-k+1-k+2k-1k-2kfk+1-k-1-k+3k-3k+2-k-2-k+4k-4k+3k+4-kf-k-3-k-4Parameter representation is the same as shown in Fig. 1. Because each element is a rate, the secondary rate constants, k+n, contain an appropriate substrate concentration to give a rate when multiplied by the enzyme concentration (i.e. k+1 ≡ k+1 × ST), but ST and SM are not described explicitly for simplicity of expression in this section.Each row of matrix A calculates a change in the amount of enzyme species during unit time, i.e. the top row calculates a change in free enzyme species as shown in Equation 3. ∂[E]/∂t=-(k+1+k+2)[E]+k-1[ET]+k-2[EM]+kf[ETM](Eq. 3) By replacing an arbitrary row of matrix A by a unit vector and replacing a corresponding element of the zero vector by [E]0, which establishes conservation of the enzyme molecules [E]0 = [E] + [ET] + [EM]+ [ETM], the equation is transformed into A'e→=E→0, where A′ is the matrix replaced by a kth (arbitrary) row, and E→0 is a modified zero vector of which the kth element is [E]0, and the other elements are zero. The enzyme species vector is calculated as e→=A'-1E→0 and the concentration of ternary complex species is obtained by the lth element of e→. So the reaction rate equation in the steady state model at a steady state (35King E.L. Altman C. J. Phys. Chem. 1956; 60: 1375-1387Crossref Scopus (746) Google Scholar, 36King E.L. J. Phys. Chem. 1956; 60: 1378-1384Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar) is derived as shown in Equation 4, v=kfdettAkl'¯detA'(Eq. 4) where detA′ is the determinant of matrix A′, and tA′kl is the cofactor matrix of (l,k) element of transposed A′; k is the number of the row replaced by a unit vector, and l is the number of enzyme species with which the reaction rate is expressed as kf[El]. (l is 4 in the model of this study.) [E]0 is omitted from the equation by making its value unity.The calculation of every kinetic constant was done as described previously (34Hamada M. Kuby S.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1978; 190: 772-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) for a rapid equilibrium model, and by the least square minimization of the function F = Σ(vo – vc)2 for a steady flow model, where vo is an experimentally observed reaction rate; vc is a rate calculated by Equation 4, and F is a summation of the square of the differences between them for all experimental points (36King E.L. J. Phys. Chem. 1956; 60: 1378-1384Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). For the minimization, the hybrid method of Powell (37Powell M.J.D. Computer J. 1964; 7: 155-162Crossref Google Scholar, 38Powell M.J.D. Rabinowitz P. A Hybrid Method for Nonlinear Equations, Numerical Methods for Nonlinear Algebraic Equations. 115–161, Gordon and Breach Science Publishers, Inc., New York1970: 87-114Google Scholar) was used. Correction vectors for the Gauss-Newton algorithm and for the steepest direction were calculated by using the Jacobian matrix derived from the analytically coded δ(detA)/δk. The program was allowed to run until the correction vector decreased to a threshold value. A weighting function that decreases with increasing reaction rate was also used for the function F and the Jacobian matrix.Equilibrium Dialysis—Experiments of equilibrium binding for the Y95F mutant and wild type enzymes were done by using a handmade equilibrium dialysis instrument with 200-μl chambers. Each chamber was divided into two 100-μl parts by a dialysis membrane (Spectrum Pore 6, cut-off molecular weight 10,000; Spectrum Medical Industries, Inc.) and was rotated at 10 rpm. Chambers on one side contained weak radiolabeled ATP or AMP (370 MBq/mmol) at one of the following concentrations: 50, 100, 200, 300, 400, and 500 (μm); the chambers on the other side contained the nucleotide and enzyme (100 nmol in each chamber). Substrate binding to the Y34F mutant was checked at 300 μm ATP and AMP. The amount of enzymes in the chambers was estimated as for the CD measurement. The equilibration was established by overnight dialysis at 25 °C. The difference in radioactivity between the two sides was calculated by using a liquid scintillation counter (LKB model 2000), and the number of bound nucleotides was estimated without including the enzyme volume in the calculation.RESULTSPreparation of Enzymes—The amino acid compositions of purified enzymes indicated a corresponding alteration to every amino acid residue in the mutant proteins.Enzymatic Reactions—Profiles of the reaction rates for fixed AMP concentrations and increasing ATP concentrations were divided into two regions based on critical ATP concentrations at which concentration the reaction rate was largest for the fixed AMP concentration. In the ATP concentration range lower than the critical value, 1/v increased with 1/[ATP] linearly (Fig. 2b), but in the concentration range higher than the critical value, 1/v increased with increase in [ATP], indicating inhibition effects. An apparent Ki was calculated for this inhibition as the ATP concentration at which the reaction rate was half the largest value. The same profiles were obtained for all enzymes used in this study. Table I lists the critical ATP concentration and apparent values of Ki for the wild type and other mutant enzymes; these values were several hundred μm and a few mm, respectively. The reaction rates for the wild type and six other mutant enzymes in the lower concentration range than these critical values were plotted against the ATP concentration (Fig. 2, a and c–h); these reaction rates were used for further analysis.Fig. 2Linear part of catalytic reactions for wild type (a and b), Y32F(c), Y34F(d), Y32A/Y34A(e), Y95F(f), V67I(g), and V67I/L76V (h). AMP concentrations used were 100, 150, 200, 300, 500, 800, 1000, 2000, and 5000 μm from the bottom to the top, respectively, for the wild type-catalyzed reaction; 50, 100, 200, 300, 500, 1000, 2000, and 5000 μm for Y32F; 50, 100, 150, 250, 500, 1000, and 4000 μm for Y34F, Y95F, and V67I, V67I/L76V; 50, 100, 150, 200, 300, 500, 700, and 1000 μm for Y32A/Y34A. Solid rate lines on the rate plots were calculated by Equation 4 with the obtained rate constants as described in the text following Equation 4 and Fig. 1 for each enzyme reaction. The rates of 5000 μm for AMP of the Y32F reaction are plotted with rectangles because they cross the rate line for AMP 2000 μm. b, double-reciprocal plots of the wild type reactions are shown in the same concentration range used in a. Linear dependence of inversed rates, slopes, and ordinate sections of their rate lines for inversed ATP, inversed AMP, and inversed AMP concentrations, respectively, shows that the random Bi Bi mechanism on rapid equilibrium assumption is applicable to this enzyme reaction.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table IKinetic parameters determined by the rapid equilibrium modelEnzymeKm1Km2Km3Km4kcat/s-1ATPaATP is a critical ATP concentration above which the inhibition dominates in the ADK reaction.

Open table in a new tab Kinetic Behavior with the Random Bi-Bi Model Using the Rapid Equilibrium Assumption—The rate equation by the rapid equilibrium model (Equation 1) was simplified as shown in Equation 5. 1/v=αSMST+βSM(Eq. 5) By comparing Equation 5 with Equation 1, slope αSM (apparent Km/Vmax) and intercept βSM (apparent 1/Vmax) of the rate equation were written as shown in Equation 6 and Equation 7, respectively. αSM=(Km1Km3/SM+Km4)/Vmax(Eq. 6) βSM=(Km3/SM+1)/Vmax(Eq. 7) For the rapid equilibrium model, these two parameters were calculated by using the reaction rates of increasing ATP concentration from 50 μm to 1 mm ATP and fixed AMP concentrations for wild type, Y32F, Y34F, Y32A/Y34A, Y95F, V67I, and V67I/L76V mutant enzyme reactions. Then αSM and βSM for increasing ATP were plotted against 1/[AMP] for these seven enzyme reactions (data not shown). Because all plots, including the wild type, lie on linear lines, the rapid equilibrium model was applicable in the concentration ranges used here despite modification of the respective sites, and Kmn and Vmax values were calculated from the slopes and intercepts of αSM and βSM plots by using Equations 6 and 7. Km2, which is not in Equations 6 and 7, was calculated using the relation Km1Km3=Km2Km4, which represents an identity of two states of enzyme species bound by ATP and AMP produced by two different reaction pathways.Table I lists the calculated kinetic parameters. Km values of Y32F, Y34F, and Y32A/Y34A mutant enzymes for ATP ( Km1 and Km4) were about one, two, and two times, respectively, larger than for the wild type. The Km values for AMP ( Km2 and Km3) of these ATP site mutant enzymes were about one to two times larger than for the wild type. Among them Km3 of 800 μm for the Y32A/Y34A mutant was the largest. The catalytic rates were from 1.8 × 10–3 s–1 for the wild type to 1.6 × 100 s–1 for the Y32A/Y34A mutant enzyme, i.e. the rate constant of Y32A/Y34A was about 10–3 times that of the wild type enzyme. For Y95F, only a few parameters were derived because the intersections of the plots of αSM against 1/[AMP] were negative or zero within experimental error, and therefore no reasonable values were obtained for Km2. The intercept of βSM against 1/[AMP] was positive but very small for the Y95F mutant enzyme and was therefore assigned as zero. Accordingly, Km2 for Y95F was estimated as 6.5 mm from the slope of αST and the intercept of βST, using the rate equation of the rapid equilibrium model. Y95F, V67I, and V67I/L76V, the mutant enzymes near the AMP site, had markedly larger values of Km for AMP ( Km2 and Km3) (Table I), but values of Km for ATP did not change appreciably. In particular, Y95F showed the most marked change in Km values for AMP, indicating that Tyr-95 participates directly in the AMP site in ADK. These results, together with the increase in Ki for ATP, imply that Tyr-95, Val-67, and Leu-76 have inhibitory roles in addition to being a binding site for AMP.Specificity of Substrates—To analyze the specificity of the enzyme reaction for several kinds of substrate nucleotides, double-reciprocal plots of initial velocities against the inverse of a substrate concentration were made for the wild type, Y32F, Y34F and Y32A/Y34A (Fig. 3, a–d, respectively). These plots were linear for many kinds of nucleotide species and for all applied enzyme reactions, except for CMP of the wild type (Fig. 3a). The inverse of the reaction rate for the wild type enzyme with a substrate set of ATP and CMP depended on the square of 1/[CMP], but for other mutant enzymes on the same substrate set it was linearly dependent on 1/[CMP]. Nucleotide species (UTP, GTP, and CTP for Y34F and CMP for Y32A/Y34A) showed an inhibitory effect (i.e"
