By using orcein we have been able to demonstrate such structures (Fig. 1) in the macronuclear anlage of Stylonychia muscorum Kahl (a hypotrichous ciliate). According to our preliminary observations, there are in this species 50–60 giant chromosomes which show a great diversity in both size and banding. They range from 15µ to 55µ, in length, and from 0.8µ to 2.5µ in width."

Based on these findings and on the mosaicism observed for X-linked factors in female mice, Lyon4,5 proposed a relationship between DNA condensation and metabolic inactivation of one of the two X chromosomes of females."

https://openalex.org/W2002572407,A LINC digital computer was used to generate an autoregressive schedule of reinforcement. On such a schedule the probability of reinforcement is a function of the similarity in duration of the intervals between successive responses. A detailed analysis of the data obtained from monkeys on this schedule demonstrated two distinct tendencies in their behavior: a tendency for periodic response and a tendency for serial dependence between successive interresponse times.

https://openalex.org/W2066566299,"In mathematical models of concept learning it has consistently been assumed that positive reinforcement cannot lead to a change of the hypothesis determining the overt response. When hypotheses are experimentally identified and recorded along with positive and negative reinforcements of stimulus-response pairs, it can be shown that hypotheses may change after a positive reinforcement. Positive reinforcement has an information content for subjects that has not yet been adequately recognized in concept formation studies."

https://openalex.org/W1985245041,"SOME, but not all, pairs of proteins which are oppositely charged combine with and precipitate each other when mixed in salt-free solutions1. The precipitates usually dissolve when salt is added, presumably because anions and cations of the salt substitute the negatively and the positively charged proteins, respectively, in the compound formed by electrostatic attraction."
