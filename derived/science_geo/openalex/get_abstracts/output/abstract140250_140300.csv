https://openalex.org/W2004026630,"Although insects have proven to be valuable models for exploring the function, organization, and development of the olfactory system, the receptor molecules that bind odors have not been identified in any insect. We have developed a novel search algorithm, used it to search the Drosophila genomic sequence database, and identified a large multigene family encoding seven transmembrane domain proteins that are expressed in olfactory organs. We show that expression is restricted to subsets of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) for a number of these genes. Different members of the family initiate expression at different times during antennal development. Some of the genes are not expressed in a mutant of the Acj6 POU-domain transcription factor, a mutant in which a subset of ORNs show abnormal odorant specificities."

Single polysaccharide molecules were covalently anchored between a surface and an AFM tip and then stretched until they became detached. By using different surface chemistries for the attachment, it was found that the silicon-carbon bond ruptured at 2.0 ± 0.3 nanonewtons, whereas the sulfur-gold anchor ruptured at 1.4 ± 0.3 nanonewtons at force-loading rates of 10 nanonewtons per second. Bond rupture probability calculations that were based on density functional theory corroborate the measured values."

The probability distribution for the molecular extension was determined as a function of shear rate, gamma;, for two different polymer relaxation times, tau. In contrast to the behavior in pure elongational flow, the average polymer extension in shear flow does not display a sharp coil-stretch transition. Large, aperiodic temporal fluctuations were observed, consistent with end-over-end tumbling of the molecule. The rate of these fluctuations (relative to the relaxation rate) increased as the Weissenberg number, gamma;tau, was increased."

Activation of NF-κB is thought to be required for cytokine release from LPS-responsive cells, a critical step for endotoxic effects. Here we investigated the role and involvement of interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) signal transducer molecules in LPS signaling in human dermal microvessel endothelial cells (HDMEC) and THP-1 monocytic cells. LPS stimulation of HDMEC and THP-1 cells initiated an IL-1 receptor-like NF-κB signaling cascade. In transient cotransfection experiments, dominant negative mutants of the IL-1 signaling pathway, including MyD88, IRAK, IRAK2, and TRAF6 inhibited both IL-1- and LPS-induced NF-κB-luciferase activity. LPS-induced NF-κB activation was not inhibited by a dominant negative mutant of TRAF2 that is involved in TNF signaling. LPS-induced activation of NF-κB-responsive reporter gene was not inhibited by IL-1 receptor antagonist. TLR2 and TLR4 were expressed on the cell surface of HDMEC and THP-1 cells. These findings suggest that a signal transduction molecule in the LPS receptor complex may belong to the IL-1 receptor/toll-like receptor (TLR) super family, and the LPS signaling cascade uses an analogous molecular framework for signaling as IL-1 in mononuclear phagocytes and endothelial cells.

LPS is a potent activator of cells of the immune and inflammatory systems, including macrophages, monocytes, and endothelial cells, and contributes to systemic changes known as septic shock (1Wenzel R.P.

On the other hand, vascular endothelial cells do not express mCD14 and respond to LPS only in the presence of soluble CD14 (4Arditi M. Zhou J. Dorio R. Rong G.W. Goyert S.M. Kim K.S. Infect.

Activation of NF-κB is required for release of proinflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) (16Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D.

However, the molecular mechanisms of the signaling cascade induced by LPS to activate NF-κB are unknown. Furthermore, the signaling LPS receptor is still unidentified. The toll gene controls dorsoventral pattern formation during the early embryonic development of Drosophila melanogaster (18Belvin M.P. Anderson K.V. Annu. Rev. Cell. Dev.

Cell. Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 393-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). The toll family of receptors is defined by homology to the Drosophila toll protein (19Chaudhary P.M. Ferguson C.

Biol. 1996; 12: 393-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). Five other mammalian family members (toll-like receptors 1 through 5, TLR1–5) have been identified, but their function is uncertain. Several TLRs, similar to IL-1R, have been observed to signal through the NF-κB pathway (19Chaudhary P.M. Ferguson C. Nguyen V. Blood. 1998; 91: 4020-4027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Heguy A.

Nature. 1997; 388: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (4458) Google Scholar). LPS signaling also leads to activation of NF-κB, and recent studies suggested that a toll-like receptor (TLR) might be a signaling receptor that is activated by LPS (22Medzhitov R. Preston-Hurlburt P. Janeway Jr., C.A. Nature. 1997; 388: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (4458) Google Scholar, 23Yang R.-B. Mark M.R. Gray A. Huang A. Xie M.H. Zhang M. Goddard A. Wood W.I. Gurney A.L. Godowski P.J. Nature. 1998; 395: 284-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar). In these reports, expression of TLR2 in LPS-unresponsive human embryonic kidney cells (293 cells) enabled these cells to respond to LPS stimulation (22Medzhitov R. Preston-Hurlburt P. Janeway Jr., C.A. Nature. 1997; 388: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (4458) Google Scholar, 23Yang R.-B. Mark M.R. Gray A. Huang A. Xie M.H. Zhang M. Goddard A. Wood W.I. Gurney A.L. Godowski P.J. Nature. 1998; 395: 284-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar). These investigators observed that LPS binds to a TLR2 extracellular domain and suggested that TLR2 is a candidate for a long sought LPS receptor, although the data were generated from a transfected and normally LPS-unresponsive cell line (22Medzhitov R. Preston-Hurlburt P. Janeway Jr., C.A. Nature. 1997; 388: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (4458) Google Scholar, 23Yang R.-B. Mark M.R. Gray A. Huang A. Xie M.H. Zhang M. Goddard A. Wood W.I.

A recent study in the LPS-resistant C3H-HeJ mice has implicated another toll homologue (TLR4) as a signal-transducing component in the LPS receptor complex (24Kirschning C.J. Wesche H. Ayres T.M. Rothe M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 2091-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). It is known that the IL-1 signaling pathway in mammals is strikingly similar to the toll signaling pathway in Drosophila(19Chaudhary P.M. Ferguson C. Nguyen V. Blood. 1998; 91: 4020-4027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Heguy A. Baldari C.T. Macchia G. Telford J.L. Melli M. J. Biol.

The molecular events linking the IL-1 receptor (IL-1R) signaling complex to the induction of NF-κB have been recently characterized. Upon binding of IL-1 to its receptors (IL-1R), IL-1R associates with the IL-1 receptor accessory protein (IL-1RAcP) (26Huang J. Gao X. Li S. Cao Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12829-12832Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar,27Croston G.E. Cao Z. Goeddel D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16514-16517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The complex then recruits and activates an adapter protein myeloid differentiation protein (MyD88) (28Wesche H. Henzel W.J. Shillinglaw W. Li W. Cao Z.

J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12203-12209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). MyD88 in turn recruits two distinct putative serine-threonine kinases, namely IL-1 receptor-activated kinase (IRAK) and IRAK2, to the receptor complex (30Muzio M. Ni J. Feng P. Dixit V.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1612-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar). IRAK and IRAK2 interact subsequently with the adapter molecule, TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) (31Cao Z. Xiong J. Takeuchi M. Kurama T. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1996; 383: 443-446Google Scholar, 32Muzio M. Natoli G. Saccani S. Levrero M. Mantovani A. J. Exp.

Rothe M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9792-9796Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). NIK activates the IκB kinase complex (IKKα and IKKβ) that directly phosphorylates IκB (34DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M.

The phosphorylation of IκB initiates ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated degradation and liberates and activates NF-κB (16Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D.

On the other hand, TNF and its receptor complex activate TRAF2, but not TRAF6 (37Rothe M. Sarma V. Dixit V.M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1995; 269: 1421-1427Crossref Scopus (980) Google Scholar, 38Takeuchi M. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V. J. Biol.

In this study, we tested the hypothesis that LPS activates NF-κB through IL-1 signaling molecules, namely MyD88, IRAK, IRAK2, and TRAF6 in two LPS-responsive cell types. Dominant negative mutants of these signaling elements were transfected into human monocytes (THP-1 cells) and human dermal endothelial cells together with a NF-κB-responsive reporter gene, and LPS-induced NF-κB luciferase activity was measured. Our results indicate that LPS transduces signals of NF-κB activation utilizing the IL-1 signaling molecules in both monocytic and endothelial cells. Human THP-1 cells (from ATCC) were cultured in RPMI medium with 10% fetal calf serum. The immortalized human dermal endothelial cells (generous gift of Dr. Candal of the Center for Disease Control, Atlanta) were cultured in MCDB-131 medium with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 100 μg/ml penicillin and streptomycin in 6-well plates. Dominant negative expression vectors of MyD88, IRAK, IRAK2, TRAF2, TRAF6, and NIK have been characterized and described before (30Muzio M. Ni J. Feng P. Dixit V.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1612-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar, 32Muzio M. Natoli G. Saccani S. Levrero M. Mantovani A. J. Exp.

A. 1997; 94: 9792-9796Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Cells were used for transfection with FuGene 6 Transfection Reagent (Boehringer Mannheim) following the manufacturer's instructions in RPMI with 10% serum. Reporter genes pCMV-β-galactosidase (0.5 μg) and ELAM-NF-κB-luciferase (2 μg) and pcDNA3 empty vector or dominant negative mutants of MyD88, IRAK, TRAF6, TRAF2, and NIK (3 μg each) were used. After a 24-h transfection, cells were stimulated for 6 h with 100 ng/ml LPS. Cells were then lysed, and luciferase activity was measured with a Promega kit (Promega, Madison, WI) and a luminometer. β-Galactosidase activity was determined by the calorimetric method to normalize transfection efficiency as described earlier (30Muzio M. Ni J. Feng P. Dixit V.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1612-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar). Data shown are means of two independent experiments. Transfection was carried out using the same method described above. The amount of NF-κB luciferase construct DNA was 1.5 μg, and empty vector and various dominant negative constructs were 2 μg each. Cells were transfected for 24 h and stimulated for 6 h with 100 ng/ml LPS, human TNF-α (200 units/ml, Genzyme, Cambridge, MA), recombinant human IL-1β (400 units/ml, Genzyme), and recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist (100 ng/ml, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) in 2 ml of serum-containing MCDB-131 medium. Total RNA was isolated from HDMEC and THP-1 cells using a Qiagen kit (Valencia, CA) and treated with RNase-free DNase I. For RT reaction, the SuperScriptTM Preamplification system (Life Technologies, Inc.) was applied. PCR amplification was performed withTaq polymerase (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) for 28 cycles at 95 °C for 40 s, 54 °C for 40 s, and 72 °C for 1 min. PCR primers for TLR2 were 5′-GCCAAAGTCTTGATTGATTGG and 5′-TTGAAGTTCTCCAGCTCCTG. PCR primers for TLR4 were 5′-TGGATACGTTTCCTTATAAG and 5′-GAAATGGAGGCACCCCTTC. GAPDH primers were obtained from CLONTECH. Smeared THP-1 cell and cultured HDMEC on slides were fixed with acetone for 5 min and then stained with rabbit anti-TLR2 and TLR-4 antibody (1:100) and rabbit IgG following the instructions on a DACO immunostaining kit. The anti-TLR2 and anti-TLR4 antisera were raised against synthetic peptides (extracellular domains of TLR2 and TLR4) by BABCO (Richmond, CA). The sequence of the synthetic peptide for TLR2 was a 27-amino acid peptide, starting at amino acid residue 277 of the mature hTLR2 (FRASDNDRVIDPGKVETLTIRRLHIPR), whereas the peptide for TLR4 was a 23-amino acid peptide, starting at amino acid 201 of mature hTLR4 (FKEIRHKLTLRNNFDLSLNVMKT). Following immunoperoxidase staining, the representative fields were photographed. THP-1 and HDMEC cells were lysed in Laemmli buffer and separated with a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. The protein was then transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and then the membrane was probed with anti-TLR2, anti-TLR4 antibodies, and prebleeds corresponding to each antibody (1:2,000). After incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody, the membrane was developed with an enhanced chemiluminescence ECL detection kit. A series of defense mechanisms are triggered in vertebrates and invertebrates in response to Gram-negative bacterial infections by sensing the presence of LPS (1Wenzel R.P. Pinsky M.R. Ulevitch R.J.

To date, the identification of a functional, signal-transducing component of the putative LPS receptor complex and the signaling pathways involved in LPS-induced activation of NF-κB have remained elusive. Recent findings suggested that LPS might use signaling molecules of the TLR and IL-1R superfamilies to transduce signals (23Yang R.-B. Mark M.R. Gray A. Huang A. Xie M.H. Zhang M. Goddard A.

To investigate the potential involvement of IL-1 and TNF signal transducers in LPS signaling in two LPS-responsive cell types, HDMEC and THP-1 cells, we cotransfected dominant negative constructs of various components of the NF-κB signaling cascades for IL-1 and TNF together with NF-κB-luciferase reporter gene. LPS induced the activation of NF-κB in a time- (Fig.1 A) and dose-dependent (Fig. 1 B) manner in THP-1 cells. Activation of NF-κB reached a maximum at a LPS concentration of 100 ng/ml and when cells were stimulated with LPS for 6 h (Fig. 1,A and B). Similar results were also obtained from endothelial cells. A mutant version of MyD88 (ΔMyD88), encoding only for the COOH-terminal toll-IL-1R-like domain, which abrogates IL-1R-induced NF-κB activation (30Muzio M. Ni J. Feng P. Dixit V.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1612-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar), inhibited both LPS- and IL-1-mediated NF-κB activation (Figs. 1 C and 2, A and B) but not TNF-induced NF-κB activation (Fig.2 C). IRAK and IRAK-2 are two additional proximal mediators of the IL-1R signaling complex (30Muzio M. Ni J. Feng P. Dixit V.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1612-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar). Dominant negative constructs of IRAK (ΔIRAK) and IRAK2 (ΔIRAK2) inhibited both LPS- (Figs. 1 D and 2 A) and IL-1R-mediated NF-κB activation (Fig. 2 B), but not TNF-induced NF-κB activation (Fig. 2 C). NF-κB activation induced by various cytokine receptors is mediated by members of the TRAF adapter family. While TRAF2 plays a crucial role in NF-κB activation by TNFR-1 and TNFR-2 (37Rothe M. Sarma V. Dixit V.M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1995; 269: 1421-1427Crossref Scopus (980) Google Scholar, 38Takeuchi M. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19935-19942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), TRAF6 has been implicated in IL-1 signaling (31Cao Z. Xiong J. Takeuchi M. Kurama T. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1996; 383: 443-446Google Scholar, 32Muzio M. Natoli G. Saccani S. Levrero M. Mantovani A. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 2097-2101Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Therefore, we next determined whether dominant negative versions of TRAF6 (ΔTRAF6) or TRAF2 (ΔTRAF2) could act to inhibit LPS-induced NF-κB activity. ΔTRAF-6 but not ΔTRAF2 significantly impaired LPS-induced NF-κB activation, suggesting that TRAF6 may act as an additional downstream mediator of LPS-induced NF-κB activation cascade (Figs. 1 D and2 A). ΔTRAF2 blocked TNF-induced NF-κB activation in endothelial cells (Fig. 2 C), but not LPS-induced NF-κB activation (Figs. 1 D and 2 A). Because the pathways for IL-1 and TNF-α signaling converge at the level of NIK for NF-κB activation, we next investigated whether dominant negative NIK mutant (ΔNIK) would block LPS-induced, as well as IL-1- and TNF-induced, NF-κB activation. As expected, ΔNIK blocked NF-κB activation induced by LPS, IL-1, and TNF-α (Fig. 2). IL-1 receptor antagonist had no effect on LPS-induced NF-κB activation (Fig. 2 A) but inhibited IL-1-induced NF-κB activation in endothelial cells (Fig. 2 B). This observation suggests that NF-κB activation that we measured following 6 h of LPS stimulation of cells is not due to an autocrine effect such as LPS-induced IL-1 release from endothelial cells. These data suggest that LPS stimulation of endothelial cells and THP-1 cells triggers an IL-1R-like signal relay leading to activation of NF-κB (Fig. 5). Further support for this concept is provided by the observation of a 15-year-old girl with recurrent infections who was found to be resistant to both LPS and IL-1 stimulation in vivo and in vitro (39Kuhns D.B. Long Priel D.A. Gallin J.I. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 3959-3964PubMed Google Scholar). The authors suggested that resistance to LPS and IL-1 was due to a defect very early in the common signaling pathway for LPS and IL-1 (39Kuhns D.B. Long Priel D.A. Gallin J.I. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 3959-3964PubMed Google Scholar). The experiments with IL-1R antagonist also suggest that LPS does not use IL-1 receptor to transduce signals in endothelial cells. Although recent findings imply that TLR2 or other members of the TLR family, which use the IL-1R signaling pathway, might be an important mediator for LPS signaling (23Yang R.-B. Mark M.R. Gray A.

Beutler and coworkers (25Poltorak A. He X. Smirnova I. Liu M.-Y. Van Huffel C. Du X. Birdwell D. Alejos E. Silva M. Galanos C. Freudenberg M. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Layton B. Beutler B. Science. 1998; 282: 2085-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (6478) Google Scholar) recently reported that TLR4 is the protein encoded by the LPS gene, which is mutated in the LPS-non-responsive C3H-HeJ mice. To investigate the expression of the TLR2 and TLR4 message in HDMEC and THP-1 cells, we used RT-PCR. Human THP-1 and HDMEC were found to express significant levels of both TLR2 and TLR4 mRNA (Fig.3). Expression levels of TLR2 appeared to be stronger in THP-1 whereas the expression level of TLR4 appeared to be stronger in HDMEC. Expression of TLR2 and TLR4 was confirmed with Northern analysis in THP-1 cells. Immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting data demonstrate that TLR2 and TLR4 proteins are expressed on THP-1 cells and HDMEC (Fig.4). Staining was absent in THP-1 and HDMEC incubated without the first antibody or incubated with rabbit IgG. These results suggest that TLR2 and TLR4 are expressed in endothelial and monocytic cells and may represent a signaling component of a cellular receptor for LPS which signals through an IL-1-like pathway (Fig. 5).Figure 4Immunostaining and immunoblotting. Inpanel A, THP-1 cells (a, c, and e) and HDMEC cells (b, d, andf) were immunostained with rabbit IgG (a andb), anti-TLR2 (c and d), and anti-TLR4 (e and f) (1:100). In panel B, THP-1 and HDMEC cell lysates were resolved with SDS-PAGE and probed with anti-TLR2, anti-TLR4 antibodies, and corresponding prebleeds. Molecular mass markers are indicated at theright. The apparent molecular masses for TLR2 and TLR4 were 85 kDa and 92 kDa, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In summary, we have demonstrated in endothelial and THP-1 cells that LPS-induced NF-κB activation is mediated by IL-1R signaling molecules, namely MyD88, IRAK, IRAK2, and TRAF6, but not the TNF signaling molecule, TRAF2. We have also shown that TLR2 and TLR4 are expressed on the cell surface of two LPS-responsive cell types, endothelial cells and THP-1 cells. These data strongly suggest that a crucial signaling component in the LPS receptor complex may belong to the IL-1 receptor/TLR superfamily, and the LPS signaling cascade uses an analogous molecular framework for signaling as IL-1. MyD88 appears to represent the most upstream mediator of the LPS-mediated signaling cascade, which ultimately activates NF-κB, thus driving transcriptional activation of several cytokines. Thus, MyD88 may represent a potentially useful therapeutic target to control the molecular switch from innate to the adaptive immune response."

This peptide was referred to as the non-amyloid component of senile plaques (NAC)1 and its precursor protein, i.e. α-synuclein, was designated NACP (5Uéda K. Fukushima H. Masliah E. Xia Y. Iwai A.

Because α-synuclein is in close proximity to and is loosely associated with presynaptic vesicles, it may modulate the function of synaptic vesicles (6George J.M. Jin H. Woods W.S. Clayton D.F.

Significantly, these lesions are pathological hallmarks of PD and DLB (13Forno L.S. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1996; 55: 259-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1244) Google Scholar, 14McKeith I.G.

Furthermore, a second pathogenic mutation in α-synuclein (Ala30 → Pro) also was reported in another familial PD kindred (25Krüger R. Kuhn W. Müller T. Woitalla D. Graeber M. Kösel S. Przuntek H.

Since it is unclear how α-synuclein, a very soluble protein, ends up in cellular inclusions, we carried out studies to determine whether wild type (WT) and/or mutants of α-synuclein can self-aggregatein vitro. Here, we report that the SDS solubility of wild type and mutant α-synucleins is reduced after incubation in aqueous solution at physiological temperature and this change in physical property was attributed to the formation of elongated filaments. Human WT, A30P, and A53T α-synuclein cDNAs subcloned into the bacterial expression vector pRK172 were expressed in Escherichia coliBL21 (DE3). Bacterial pellets were resuspended in high-salt lysis buffer (0.75 m NaCl, 100 mm MES, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA) containing a mixture of protease inhibitors, heated to 100 °C for 10 min, and centrifuged at 70,000 ×g for 30 min. The supernatants were dialyzed against 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, applied to a Mono Q column, and eluted with a 0–0.5 m NaCl gradient. Protein concentration was determined using the bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce) and bovine serum albumin as a standard. Proteins were resolved on slab gels by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar) and electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher and Schuell) in buffer containing 48 mm Tris, 39 mm glycine, and 10% methanol. Membranes were blocked with a 1% solution of powdered skim milk dissolved in Tris buffered saline-Tween (50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20), incubated with anti-α-synuclein antibody LB509 (15Baba M. Nakajo S. Tu P.H. Tomita T. Nakaya K. Lee V.M.-Y. Trojanowski J.Q. Iwatsubo T. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 152: 879-884PubMed Google Scholar), followed with a goat anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) and developed with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine. Following incubation at 37 °C in 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 7.0, with continuous shaking, samples were centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 30 min, SDS-sample buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 1 mmEDTA, 40 mm dithiothreitol, 1% SDS, 10% sucrose) was added to pellets and supernatants and heated to 100 °C for 15 min. α-Synuclein was resolved on SDS-PAGE, stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, and quantified by densitometry. SNL-1 and SNL-4 are affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against peptides corresponding to amino acid residues 104–119 and 2–12 in α-synuclein, respectively. Syn 202, Syn 204, Syn 205 and Syn 208 are novel mouse monoclonal antibodies raised to synucleins, as described previously (20Tu P.H. Galvin J.E. Baba M. Giasson B. Tomita T. Leight S. Nakajo S. Iwatsubo T. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.-Y. Ann. Neurol. 1998; 44: 415-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). The epitopes for Syn 202 and 205 are localized to amino acid residues 130–140, while the Syn 204 and 208 epitopes map to residues 87–110. The relative activities of the antibodies were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using α-synuclein as the antigen and by performing serial dilutions of the antibodies. α-Synuclein filaments were decorated with anti-α-synuclein antibodies and negative stained with uranyl acetate as described previously (27Balin B.J. Clark E.A. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.-Y. Brain Res. 1991; 556: 181-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Briefly, assembled α-synuclein filaments were absorbed to 300 mesh carbon coated copper grids and stained with 1% uranyl acetate or labeled with antibodies to α-synuclein followed by secondary antibodies conjugated to 10 nm gold and staining with 1% uranyl acetate. The purity of recombinant α-synuclein proteins was demonstrated in Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE gels (Fig.1 A). No contaminating proteins were seen even when 100 μg of purified recombinant α-synucleins were loaded in separate lanes of an SDS-PAGE gel (data not shown). Incubation of 5 mg/ml WT α-synuclein at 37 °C for 48 h in a number of different buffers resulted in the aggregation of α-synuclein as reflected by decreased mobility on SDS-PAGE (Fig.1 B). Diffuse smears of the incubated proteins on SDS-PAGE gels may reflect the rapid association/dissociation of α-synuclein in the presence of SDS. Temperature was a major determinant of α-synuclein aggregation, since under the same conditions, incubation at 37 °C generated abundant aggregation that was not significantly detected when the protein was incubated at room temperature (Fig.1 B). WT (Fig. 1 C), A30P (Fig. 1 D), and A53T (Fig. 1 E) α-synucleins demonstrated a similar ability to aggregate, although A53T α-synuclein seemed to aggregate to a slightly greater extent at lower concentrations. The ability of α-synuclein to polymerize was confirmed with centrifugal sedimentation experiments (Fig. 2). WT, A30P, and A53T α-synuclein polymerization was concentration- and time-dependent, and the A53T mutant had a greater propensity to polymerize.Figure 2α-Synuclein polymerization is time- and concentration-dependent. WT, A30P, and A53T α-synucleins were incubated at 37 °C in 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 7.0, for 0–48 h. The proteins were sedimented as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and the percentage of each protein in the pellet is indicated on the y axis. The protein concentrations used for each incubation are indicated at thebottom of each bar graph; n = 2.The range for each set of experiments was less than ±13% from the mean.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Electron microscopic analysis of wild type and mutant α-synucleins postincubation revealed that they formed elongated filaments that frequently attained lengths of several microns (Fig.3). In some fields, a plethora of α-synuclein filaments filled the whole area on the grid (Fig.3 A). Interestingly, the morphology of the different synuclein filaments varied. For example, WT α-synuclein mainly formed straight filaments, although twisted filaments were also observed (Fig.3 B). In contrast, A53T α-synuclein predominantly formed twisted filaments that appeared to contain two protofilaments in a regular helical fibril (Fig. 3 C), while A30P α-synuclein formed filaments that were straight (Fig. 3 D). WT and A30P α-synuclein filaments had diameters ranging between 10 and 15 nm (mean = 12 ± 1.4 nm) and 11–16 nm (mean = 13 ± 1.4 nm), respectively, whereas A53T α-synuclein filaments were slightly wider with widths ranging between 16 and 19 nm (mean = 17 ± 1.1 nm). α-Synuclein filaments were only modestly labeled with antibodies to the N terminus (SNL-4) (Fig.4 A) or the C-terminal region (SNL-1; Syn 202 and Syn 205) (Fig. 4, B and C; data not shown) of α-synuclein. However, antibodies to epitopes within the central part of α-synuclein (Syn 204 and Syn 208) demonstrated very strong labeling (Fig. 4, D–F). Antibodies SNL-1, SNL-4, Syn 202, and Syn 205 were used at 10–20-fold higher relative immunoreactiveactivity than antibodies Syn 204 and Syn 208. Thus, these results may suggest that the N- and C-terminal regions of α-synuclein are less accessible than the central region within these filaments, and this may imply that both ends of the polypeptide are involved in polymer formation and embedded within the filaments. Despite the fact that α-synuclein is a small soluble synaptic protein that is largely devoid of secondary structure in aqueous buffer, we show here that mutant and WT recombinant α-synucleins polymerize into morphologically distinct filaments under a variety ofin vitro conditions. Furthermore, α-synuclein polymerization is temperature-, concentration-, and time-dependent, and the protein subunits are topographically organized within these polymers as reflected by the paucity of immunoreactivity for antibodies to α-synuclein epitopes at both ends of the polypeptide relative to those in the central region. Although a recent report demonstrated that wild-type α-synuclein forms Thioflavin-S-reactive aggregates and filaments, especially at elevated temperature (28Hashimoto M. Hsu L.J. Sisk A. Xia Y. Takeda A. Sundsmo M. Masliah E. Brain Res. 1998; 799: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), our studies substantially extend these preliminary observations by comparing the morphology of filaments formed from WT and mutant α-synucleins as well as the topography of α-synuclein in these filaments. A possible model consistent with these observations is that α-synuclein exists in numerous conformational states in aqueous solution, but when molecules with conformations compatible with dimerization interact, they may stabilize each other in this dimerized conformation, and these dimers may then serve as seeds for polymerization. The findings presented here and in previous reports suggest that α-synuclein is the major building block of the filaments that form LBs. First, anti-α-synuclein antibodies stain LBs more intensely and consistently than any other antibodies, including anti-ubiquitin antibodies (12Spillantini M.G. Schmidt M.L. Lee V.M.-Y.

Third, neurofilaments, another filamentous component of LBs (29Goldman J.E. Yen S.H. Chiu F.C. Peress N.S. Science. 1983; 221: 1082-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 30Schmidt M.L.

Acta Neuropathol. 1992; 83: 525-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and most anti-neurofilament antibodies only label a subset of LBs (30Schmidt M.L. Murray J. Lee V.M.-Y. Hill W.D. Wertkin A. Trojanowski J.Q. Am. J. Pathol. 1991; 139: 53-65PubMed Google Scholar). However, at least one anti-neurofilament antibody that is specific for the mid-size neurofilament subunit (RMO32) labels nearly all cortical LBs (30Schmidt M.L. Murray J. Lee V.M.-Y. Hill W.D. Wertkin A. Trojanowski J.Q. Am. J. Pathol. 1991; 139: 53-65PubMed Google Scholar). Fourth, the filaments generated in vitro from WT and mutant α-synucleins are morphologically similar to the LB filaments visualized in situ (30Schmidt M.L. Murray J. Lee V.M.-Y. Hill W.D. Wertkin A.

Jakes R. Hasegawa M. Goedert M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6469-6473Crossref PubMed Scopus (2420) Google Scholar), while normal neurofilaments have side arms (27Balin B.J. Clark E.A.

Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 1523-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar) that are not seen in LB fibrils (31Hill W.D. Lee V.M.-Y. Hurtig H.I. Murray J.M. Trojanowski J.Q. J. Comp.

LB filament formation in vivo may result from α-synuclein accumulation, and this may be due to a reduction in the fast axonal transport (35Jensen P.H. Nielson M.S. Jakes R. Dotti C.G. Goedert M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26292-26294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar) or overexpression of α-synuclein. Furthermore, once α-synuclein reaches a critical intracellular concentration, it may polymerize into filaments that aggregate into LBs or LB precursors which entrap other cytoplasmic components, and similar mechanisms may lead to the formation of Lewy neurites. Additionally, the reduced ability of A30P α-synuclein to bind vesicles (35Jensen P.H. Nielson M.S. Jakes R. Dotti C.G. Goedert M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26292-26294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar) may play a mechanistic role in the onset/progression of some forms of familial PD, while the A53T mutation may be pathogenic because it increases the propensity of α-synuclein to polymerize into LB filaments (see Figs.1, C–E, and 2). The accelerated formation of filaments as a consequence of the A53T mutation has also been observed in a recent publication by Conway et al. (42Conway K.A. Harper J.D. Lansbury P.T. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1318-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (1263) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Crowtheret al. (43Crowther R.A. Jakes R. Spillantini M.G. Goedert M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar) have reported that carboxyl-terminally truncated α-synuclein may be more prone to form filaments than the full-length protein. Although the pathological implications of the latter finding is still unclear, it is possible that aberrant proteolysis of α-synuclein may create a pool of these shorter products that may play a role in initiating α-synuclein filament assembly. Although α-synuclein has been reported to be expressed predominantly in neurons, it also is a major component of GCIs and NCIs in MSA brains (20Tu P.H. Galvin J.E. Baba M. Giasson B. Tomita T.

Sci. 1989; 94: 79-100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar), but some GCIs appear to contain tubular filaments (38Kato S. Nakamura H. Hirano A. Ito H. Llena J.F. Yen S.-H. Acta Neuropathol. 1991; 82: 488-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 41Papp M.I. Kahn J.E. Lantos P.L. J. Neurol.

Acta Neuropathol. 1992; 84: 273-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Recently, the filaments in GCIs have been shown to be intensely labeled with anti-α-synuclein antibodies at the ultrastructural level (15Baba M. Nakajo S. Tu P.H. Tomita T. Nakaya K. Lee V.M.-Y. Trojanowski J.Q. Iwatsubo T. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 152: 879-884PubMed Google Scholar, 23Arima K. Uéda K. Sunohara N. Arakawa K. Hirai S. Nakamura M. Tonozuka-Uehara H. Kawai M. Acta Neuropathol. 1998; 96: 439-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), and Sarkosyl-insoluble α-synuclein filaments with straight and twisted morphologies similar to our synthetic filaments also have been observed in extracts of MSA brains (21Spillantini M.G. Crowther R.A. Jakes R. Cairns N.J. Lantos P.L. Goedert M. Neurosci. Lett. 1998; 251: 205-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). Perhaps the tubular appearance of some GCI fibrils is due to the incorporation of other proteins into α-synuclein filaments or these tubular fibrils may reflect the presence of microtubules trapped within bundles of α-synuclein filaments. This uncertainty notwithstanding, we speculate that the anomalous expression, accumulation, and subsequent polymerization of α-synuclein lead to the formation of GCIs in MSA brain. However, future research will be needed to determine whether α-synuclein polymers serve as a proteinaceous trap and if α-synuclein co-assembles with other proteins previously co-localized in LBs and GCIs in situ. Finally, efforts to over express WT and mutant α-synucleins in vivo will help to elucidate the role of α-synuclein filaments in the pathogenesis of PD, DLB, MSA, and related α-synucleinopathies.

Mena-deficient mice are viable; however, axons projecting from interhemispheric cortico-cortical neurons are misrouted in early neonates, and failed decussation of the corpus callosum as well as defects in the hippocampal commissure and the pontocerebellar pathway are evident in the adult.

We studied single excitatory synapses between hippocampal neurons in culture. Focal glutamate application at individual postsynaptic sites evoked currents (Iglu) with little variability compared with quantal excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs). The maximal Iglu was >2-fold larger than the median EPSC. Thus, variations in [glu]cleft are the main source of variability in EPSC size, and glutamate receptors are generally far from saturation during quantal transmission. This conclusion was verified by molecular antagonism experiments in hippocampal cultures and slices. The general lack of glutamate receptor saturation leaves room for increases in [glu]cleft as a mechanism for synaptic plasticity."

Here, we show that α3β1 integrin is necessary for neuron–glial recognition during neuronal migration and that αV integrins provide optimal levels of the basic neuron–glial adhesion needed to maintain neuronal migration on radial glial fibers. A gliophilic-to-neurophilic switch in the adhesive preference of developing cortical neurons occurs following the loss of α3β1 integrin function. Furthermore, the targeted mutation of the α3 integrin gene results in abnormal layering of the cerebral cortex. These results suggest that α3β1 and αV integrins regulate distinct aspects of neuronal migration and neuron–glial interactions during corticogenesis."

Parasympathetic innervation of the lacrimal and submandibular salivary gland is dramatically reduced in NTN-/- mice, indicating that Neurturin is a neurotrophic factor for parasympathetic neurons. GFR alpha2-expressing cells in the trigeminal and dorsal root ganglia are also depleted in NTN-/- mice.

The impact of dendritic morphology and active conductances on input summation is still unknown. To study this, we use glutamate iontophoresis and synaptic stimulation to position pairs of excitatory inputs throughout the apical, oblique, and basal dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons in rat hippocampal slices. Under a variety of stimulation regimes, we find a linear summation of most input combinations that is implemented by a surprising balance of boosting and shunting mechanisms. Active conductances in dendrites paradoxically serve to make summation linear. This ""active linearity"" can reconcile predictions from cable theory with the observed linear summation in vivo and suggests that a simple arithmetic is used by apparently complex dendritic trees."

The function of Abl in this pathway is dependent on an intact catalytic domain. We also show that the Abl phosphoprotein substrate Enabled (Ena) is required for choice point navigation. Both Abl and Ena proteins associate with the Dlar cytoplasmic domain and serve as substrates for Dlar in vitro, suggesting that they play a direct role in the Dlar pathway.

https://openalex.org/W2026526608,"Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) increases the production of interleukin-12 (IL-12) from mouse macrophages via a κB site within the IL-12 p40 promoter. In this study, we found that retinoids inhibit this LPS-stimulated production of IL-12 in a dose-dependent manner. The NFκB components p50 and p65 bound retinoid X receptor (RXR) in a ligand-independent manner in vitro, and the interaction interfaces involved the p50 residues 1–245, the p65 residues 194–441, and the N-terminal A/B/C domains of RXR. Activation of macrophages by LPS resulted in markedly enhanced binding activities to the κB site, which significantly decreased upon addition of retinoids, as demonstrated by the electrophoretic mobility shift assays. In cotransfections of CV-1 and HeLa cells, RXR also inhibited the NFκB transactivation in a ligand-dependent manner, whereas a mutant RXR lacking the AF2 transactivation domain, which serves as ligand-dependent binding sites for transcription integrators SRC-1 and p300, was without any effect. In addition, coexpression of increasing amounts of SRC-1 or p300 relieved the retinoid-mediated inhibition of the NFκB transactivation.

Inducible expression of IL-12 has been documented in macrophages and dendritic cells after stimulation by microbial antigens or via CD40-CD40L interaction (8Cella M. Scheidegger D. Palmer-Lehmann K.

In lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- and IFN-γ-treated monocytes, the expression of IL-12 p40 has been shown to be primarily regulated at the transcriptional level, which involved at least two transcription factors that belong to the NFκB and Ets families (10Murphy T.L. Cleveland M.G. Kulesza P. Magram J. Murphy K.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5258-5267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Ma X. Chow J.M. Gri G. Carra G. Gerosa F. Wolf S.F. Dzialo R. Trinchieri G. J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 6431-6438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Expression of IL-12 p35 is also known to be subject to similar transcriptional regulation, although characterized to a much lesser extent than p40 (13Tone Y. Thompson S.A. Babik J.M. Nolan K.F.

Immunol. 1996; 156: 1082-1088PubMed Google Scholar). The transcription factor NFκB is important for the inducible expression of a wide variety of cellular and viral genes (reviewed in Ref. 15Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5515) Google Scholar). NFκB is composed of homo- and heterodimeric complexes of members of the Rel (NFκB) family of polypeptides. In vertebrates, this family comprises p50, p65 (RelA), c-Rel, p52, and RelB. These proteins share a 300-amino acid region, known as the Rel homology domain, which binds to DNA and mediates homo- and heterodimerization. This domain is also a target of the IκB inhibitors, which include IκBα, IκBβ, IκBγ, Bcl-3, p105, and p100 (16Gilmore T.D. Morin P.J. Trends Genet. 1993; 9: 427-433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In the majority of cells, NFκB exists in an inactive form in the cytoplasm, bound to the inhibitory IκB proteins. Treatment of cells with various inducers results in the degradation of IκB proteins. The bound NFκB is released and translocates to the nucleus, where it activates appropriate target genes. The nuclear receptor superfamily is a group of ligand-dependent transcriptional regulatory proteins that function by binding to specific DNA sequences named hormone response elements in the promoters of target genes (reviewed in Ref. 17Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schutz G. Umesono K. Blumberg B. Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 835-839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6002) Google Scholar). The superfamily includes receptors for a variety of small hydrophobic ligands such as steroids, T3, and retinoids, as well as a large number of related proteins that do not have known ligands, referred to as orphan nuclear receptors. In particular, at least six distinct receptors have been extensively characterized for retinoids; retinoic acid receptor (RAR) α, β, and γ and retinoid X receptor (RXR) α, β, and γ (reviewed in Ref. 18Chambon P. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 940-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (2575) Google Scholar). Functional analysis of nuclear receptors has shown that there are two major activation domains. The N-terminal domain (AF1) contains a ligand-independent activation function, whereas the extreme C-terminal region of the ligand binding domain (AF2) exhibits ligand-dependent transactivation and undergoes an allosteric change upon ligand binding. The AF2 region plays a critical role in mediating transactivation by a ligand-dependent interaction with transcription coactivators such as functionally conserved proteins CREB-binding protein (CBP) and p300 (reviewed in Ref. 19Goldman P.S. Tran V.K. Goodman R.H. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1997; 52: 103-119PubMed Google Scholar) and SRC-1 (20Onate S.A. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.M. Science. 1995; 270: 1354-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (2039) Google Scholar). Accordingly, deletion or point mutations in this region impair transcriptional activation without changing ligand and DNA binding affinities (21Cavailles V. Dauvois S. L'Horset F. Lopez G. Hoare S.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3667-3675Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar). CBP/p300 and SRC-1 have also been shown to be essential for the activation of transcription by a large number of regulated transcription factors, including CREB, NFκB, STATs, SRF, p53, and AP-1 (19Goldman P.S.

Based on this broad spectrum of action, these coactivator proteins were termed transcription integrators. Interestingly, members of steroid receptors including glucocorticoid receptor (28Ray A.

Since RelA represses ligand-dependent activation of steroid receptor-regulated promoters, a mutually inactive complex formed by a direct protein-protein interaction of steroid receptors and RelA has been proposed. In this report, we found that retinoids inhibit the LPS-stimulated production of IL-12 from mouse macrophages through direct physical interactions of retinoid receptors with NFκB, like steroid receptors. The experimental results indicated that retinoid-mediated suppression of the IL-12 production from LPS-activated macrophages may involve both inhibition of the NFκB-DNA interactions and competitive recruitment of CBP/p300 and SRC-1 between NFκB and RXR. Female DBA/2 mice were obtained from Japan SLC, Inc. (Tokyo, Japan) and used at 6–10 weeks of age. RAW264.7 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified air atmosphere. CV-1 cells as well as spleen cell populations and macrophages from mice were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% FBS and antibiotics (Life Technologies, Inc.). For transfections, cells were grown in 24-well plates with medium supplemented with 10% FBS for 24 h and transfected with indicated plasmid in the presence of Superfect according to the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen). After 12 h, cells were washed and refed with DMEM containing 10% FBS. Cells were harvested 24 h later, luciferase activity was assayed as described (34Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates, New York1995Google Scholar), and the results were normalized to LacZ expression. Similar results were obtained in more than two separate experiments. Anti-IL-12 p40 mAbs C17.8 and C15.6 were purified from ascitic fluid by ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by DEAE-Sephagel chromatography (Sigma). Anti-IL-12 p35 mAb Red-T/G297–289, anti-IL-10 mAbs JES-2A5 and SXC-1, as well as recombinant mIL-10 were obtained from PharMingen (San Diego, CA). Recombinant murine IL-12 was generously provided by Dr. Stanley Wolf (Genetics Institute, Cambridge, MA). Retinoids (9-cis-RA, TTNPB, and LG69) and LPS (from E. coli 0111:B4) were purchased from Sigma. The −689/+98 fragment of mIL-12 p40 promoter from pXP2 (11Ma X. Chow J.M. Gri G. Carra G. Gerosa F. Wolf S.F. Dzialo R. Trinchieri G. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar) was subcloned into KpnI/XhoI sites of pGL3-basic luciferase vector (Promega Co., Madison, WI). All the deletion mutants were generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using an upstream primer containing BamHI site. A linker-scanning mutant was generated by a two-step PCR procedure with overlapping internal primers that contain mutated sequences for the NFκB site. A vector expressing Gal4/p65 fusion protein was constructed by subcloning an appropriate p65 PCR fragment intoEcoRI/XhoI sites of pCMXGal4/N (35Forman B.M. Umesono K. Chen J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 541-550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). Mammalian expression vectors for SRC-1, p300, p50, p65, RXRα and RXRΔAF2, the reporter constructs TREpal-LUC and κB-LUC, and the transfection indicator construct pRSV-β-gal were as described previously (25Na S.-Y.

The non-adherent cells were removed by washing with warm DMEM until visual inspection revealed a lack of lymphocytes (>98% of the cell population). The adherent cells were removed from plates by incubating for 15 min with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline solution and rinsing repeatedly. The isolated adherent cell population was stimulated with 5 μg/ml LPS in the absence or presence of retinoids at 10−8, 10−7, and 10−6m at 1 × 105 cells/well in 96-well culture plates for 48 h. The quantities of IL-12 p40, IL-12 p70, and IL-10 in culture supernatants were determined by a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using mAbs specific for each cytokine, as described previously (36Kim T.S. DeKruyff R.H. Rupper R. Maecker H.T. Levy S. Umetsu D.T. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 4137-4144PubMed Google Scholar). The mAbs for coating the plates and the biotinylated second mAbs were as follows: for IL-12 p40, C17.8 and C15.6; for IL-12 p70, Red-T/G297–289 and C17.8; for IL-10, JES-2A5 and SXC-1. Standard curves were generated using recombinant cytokines. The lower limit of detection was 30 pg/ml for IL-12 p40, 50 pg/ml for IL-12 p70, and 0.2 ng/ml for IL-10. The nuclear extracts were prepared from the cells, as described previously (37Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9132) Google Scholar). An oligonucleotide containing an NFκB-binding site within the Ig κ-chain (5′-CCG GTT AAC AGA GGG GGC TTT CCG AG-3′) was used as a probe. Labeled oligonucleotides (10,000 cpm) were incubated for 30 min at room temperature, along with 10 μg of nuclear extracts, in 20 μl of binding buffer (10 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.6, 500 mm KCl, 10 mm EDTA, 50% glycerol, 100 ng of poly(dI-dC), and 1 mm dithiothreitol). The reaction mixture was analyzed by electrophoresis on a 4% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× Tris borate buffer. Specific binding was confirmed by competition experiments with a 50-fold excess of unlabeled, identical oligonucleotides or cAMP response element-containing oligonucleotides. Student's t test was used to determine the statistical differences between various experimental and control groups. A p value of <0.01 was considered as significant. We examined the effect of various retinoids including 9-cis-RA, TTNPB, and LG69 on the production of IL-12 by primary macrophages stimulated with LPS. 9-cis-RA is a pan-agonist for both RARs and RXRs, whereas TTNPB and LG69 are specific agonists for RARs and RXRs, respectively (38Irving H. Lovat P.E. Hewson Q.C. Malcolm A.J. Pearson A.D. Redfern C.P. Eur. J. Cancer. 1998; 34: 111-117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). LPS readily induced production of IL-12 heterodimer as well as the p40 subunit, as expected. However, retinoids inhibited this LPS-induced IL-12 production in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.1). Interestingly, 9-cis-RA and LG69 were significantly more effective than TTNPB (p < 0.01 at 10−6m RA). In contrast, treatment with retinoids did not influence IL-10 production from LPS-stimulated macrophages, suggesting that the retinoid effects were not the result of a general dampening of cellular activation. An IL-12 p40 subunit was known as the highly inducible and tightly regulated component of IL-12 (5Trinchieri G. Int. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 365-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). To identify the region involved in these retinoid actions, we generated a series of luciferase reporter constructs containing the p40 promoter sequences from positions −689, −231, and −185 to +98 relative to the transcription initiation site (Fig. 2 A). Mouse RAW264.7 monocytic cells were transfected with each of these constructs and stimulated with LPS either in the absence or presence of retinoids, and the luciferase activity was determined. All of these constructs showed strong stimulation with LPS in the absence of retinoids but impaired stimulation with retinoids (Fig. 2 B). In particular, deleting sequences to –185 (p40/185) did not diminish the LPS-dependent promoter activities and the inhibitory effect of retinoids was still observed, suggesting that the target site for retinoids should reside within this region. To directly test the role of a κB site found between –121 and –131 of the p40 promoter in the retinoid-mediated inhibitory actions, we introduced a linker scanning mutation into the κB site within the context of the −689/+98 construct (p40/LS). The LPS-dependent promoter activation was still observed with p40/LS, although significantly reduced (Fig. 2 B), consistent with the previous findings in which the κB site was shown to be important for the LPS induction of p40 promoter (10Murphy T.L. Cleveland M.G. Kulesza P. Magram J. Murphy K.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5258-5267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, addition of retinoids to LPS-stimulated cells did not have any repressive effects with p40/LS, clearly indicating that the inhibitory effect of retinoids on IL-12 production was mediated through the κB site. With the precedent of direct physical interactions of NFκB with steroid receptors (28Ray A. Prefontaine K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1996; 271: 24151-24156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that associations of NFκB with retinoid receptors may have led to the NFκB-inhibitory action of retinoids. Indeed, in vitro translated, labeled RXR interacted with GST fusions to the NFκB components p50 and p65 but not with GST alone, in a ligand-independent manner (Fig.3 A). Similarly, RXRΔAF2, deleted for the C-terminal AF2 domain (39Zavacki A.M. Lehmann J.M. Seol W. Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A. Moore D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7909-7914Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and RXR-ABC containing only the N-terminal A/B/C domains also interacted with GST fusions to p50 and p65. In contrast, RXR-LBD, which contains only the hinge and ligand binding domains, did not bind any of these GST proteins. The RXR interaction domains were also mapped to the p50 residues 1–245 and the p65 residues 194–441 by using a series of C-terminal deletions introduced into p50 and p65 (Fig. 3 B). Similarly, RAR also interacted with the p50 residues 1–245 and the p65 residues 194–441 (data not shown). Steroid receptors have been shown to inhibit NFκB binding to κB sites in a ligand-dependent manner (28Ray A. Prefontaine K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 752-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar, 29Scheinman R.I. Gualberto A. Jewell C.M. Cidlowski J.A. Baldwin A.S. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1996; 271: 24151-24156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). To examine whether retinoid-mediated inhibition of the NFκB transactivation also exploits similar mechanisms, we analyzed the κB binding activity present in nuclear extract of unstimulated or LPS-stimulated primary macrophages, either in the absence or presence of retinoids. As expected, nuclear extracts from LPS-stimulated macrophages exhibited strong κB binding activity in the electrophoretic mobility shift assays using a labeled oligonucleotide containing a consensus Ig-κB site (40Goldfeld A.E. Doyle C. Maniatis T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9769-9773Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4 A). The binding was specific as it was competed with an unlabeled, identical oligonucleotide, but not with unrelated, nonspecific oligonucleotide, and was absent with nuclear extracts from nonstimulated cells. Similar to steroid receptors, nuclear extracts from macrophages stimulated by LPS in the presence of various retinoids showed much diminished κB binding activities in a retinoid-dose dependent manner (Fig.4 A). To rule out the possibility that these inhibitory actions of retinoids are the results of retinoid-directed gene expressions of a third component, retinoids were directly added to the binding reactions, along with nuclear extracts from LPS-stimulated macrophages. In these experiments, the κB binding activities decreased in a retinoid-dose dependent manner, suggesting that the retinoid-bound receptor may directly modulate the NFκB-DNA interactions by forming a complex with NFκB that is unable to bind κB sites (Fig. 4 B). To test if this retinoid-mediated inhibition of NFκB activities in macrophages are generally observed in other cell types, we employed a reporter construct κB-LUC, previously characterized to efficiently mediate the NFκB-dependent transactivations in various cell types, that consists of a minimal promoter from the IL-2 gene and four upstream κB sites from the IL-6 gene (41Kim C.H. Song Y.-H. Park K. Oj Y. Lee T.H. J. Inflamm. 1995; 45: 312-322PubMed Google Scholar). Cotransfection of CV-1 cells with RXR had a minimal effect on the p65-induced reporter gene expression in the absence of retinoids. In the presence of retinoids, however, increasing amounts of cotransfected RXR inhibited the reporter gene expression in an RXR dose-dependent manner (Fig.5 A). Similar results were also obtained with the LPS- or TNFα-induced level of transactivations in various cell types, including HeLa cells (data not shown). Similarly, cotransfection of increasing amounts of p50 or p65 also inhibited the 9-cis-RA-dependent transactivation by RXR (Fig.5 B). These results suggest that the interactions of NFκB-RXR may lead to a formation of transcriptionally inactive complex in vivo, regardless of the nature of DNA binding sites. Interestingly, cotransfection of CV-1 cells with RXRΔAF2, a mutant RXR lacking the C-terminal AF2 domain, moderately enhanced the reporter gene expression in the absence of retinoids, whereas it appeared unable to inhibit the NFκB transactivation in the presence of 9-cis-RA (Fig.6 A). The AF2 domain serves as ligand-dependent binding sites for a number of transcription coactivator molecules such as SRC-1 (20Onate S.A. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.M. Science. 1995; 270: 1354-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (2039) Google Scholar) and CBP (19Goldman P.S. Tran V.K. Goodman R.H. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1997; 52: 103-119PubMed Google Scholar), which were also shown to function as transcription coactivators for NFκB (25Na S.-Y. Lee S.-K. Han S.-J. Choi H.-S. Im S.Y. Lee J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10831-10834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 42Perkins N.D. Felzien L.K. Betts J.C. Leung K. Beach D.H. Nabel G.J.

A. 1997; 94: 2927-2932Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). Thus, competition for limiting amounts of SRC-1 and p300 could account for the mutual inhibitions between NFκB and liganded RXR. Indeed, the inhibitory effects of NFκB by liganded RXR were largely relieved upon addition of increasing amounts of SRC-1 and p300 expression vectors (Fig. 6 B). Similar results were also obtained with NFκB-mediated inhibition of the RXR transactivation (data not shown). Since the RXR binding sites involved the DNA binding Rel domain of both p50 and p65 (Fig. 3), we tested whether the NFκB-inhibitory actions of retinoids require κB site bindings. Thus, we expressed a Gal4 fusion protein to p65 (Gal4/p65) in CV-1 cells, along with a reporter construct controlled by upstream Gal4 sites (35Forman B.M. Umesono K. Chen J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 541-550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). Consistent with previous findings (44Bull P. Morley K.L. Hoekstra M.F. Hunter T. Verma I.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5473-5485Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), Gal4/p65 directed a strong activation of the reporter gene expression (Fig.7). Cotransfection of increasing amount of RXR expression vector was without any significant effects in the absence of retinoids. In contrast, however, liganded RXR directed inhibition of the Gal4/p65 transactivation in an RXR dose-dependent manner (Fig. 7). These results, along with the results shown in Fig. 6, suggest that the inhibitory actions of retinoids can also operate without κB site bindings and involve the AF2-dependent factors. Inhibiting the action of IL-12 has been shown to prevent development and progression of disease in experimental models of autoimmunity (45Caspi R.R. Clin. Immunol.

These findings have raised great interest in identifying inhibitors of IL-12 production for the treatment of Th1-mediated diseases such as type-1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and acute graft-versus-host disease. Recently, corticosteroids have been shown to enhance the capacity of macrophages to induce IL-4 synthesis in CD4+ T cells by inhibiting IL-12 production (46DeKruyff R.H. Fang Y. Umetsu D.T. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2231-2237PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, captopril and lisinopril, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, were also shown to suppress IL-12 production from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (47Constantinescu C.S. Goodman D.B. Ventura E.S. Immunol. Lett. 1998; 62: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Phosphodiesterase inhibitor pentoxifylline (48Moller D.R. Wysocka M. Greenlee B.M. Ma X. Wahl L.

Karp C.L. J.

Interestingly, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 was also shown to inhibit IL-12 production, presumably by down-regulating the NFκB activities from human IL-12 p40 gene (51D'Ambrosio D. Cippitelli M. Gabriella C. Mazzeo D. Lucia P.D. Lang R. Sinigaglia F. Panina-Bordignon P. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 252-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). In this report, we added retinoids to the list of hydrophobic compounds that inhibit production of IL-12 through specific nuclear receptors (17Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schutz G. Umesono K. Blumberg B. Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. Evans R.M.

Immunol. 1998; 160: 2231-2237PubMed Google Scholar) and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (51D'Ambrosio D. Cippitelli M. Gabriella C. Mazzeo D. Lucia P.D. Lang R. Sinigaglia F. Panina-Bordignon P. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 252-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). As was the case with corticosteroids and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, this inhibition was also mapped to a region in the p40 promoter containing a binding site for NFκB (Fig. 2) and may involve direct physical interactions of retinoid receptors with NFκB (Fig. 3). However, it is interesting to note that NFκB constitutively interacted with RXR (Fig. 3), whereas the inhibitory actions were absolutely ligand-dependent (Figs.1, 2, and 5). Thus, NFκB may exist constitutively associated with RXRin vivo, and this complex becomes transcriptionally inactive upon addition of retinoids, in which ligand-dependent interactions with transcription coactivators may play important roles (as summarized in Fig. 8). This notion is consistent with the inability of the AF2-mutant RXR to inhibit the NFκB transactivation as well as derepression of the inhibitory actions by coexpressed SRC-1 and p300 (Fig. 6). However, it is not certain whether these coactivators remain complexed with NFκB in the presence of liganded RXR. In addition, retinoids also inhibited the κB binding activities of NFκB in vitro (Fig. 4), suggesting that the liganded RXR/NFκB complex is unable to recognize κB sites. However, it is not currently known why this liganded RXR/NFκB complex loses its ability to bind κB sites. It is possible that conformational change brought into this complex, along with the transcription coactivators SRC-1 and CBP/p300, upon addition of retinoids may become propagated to the Rel homology domain of NFκB, resulting in inability to bind κB sites. However, the inhibitory actions of retinoids can also operate in the absence of κB site bindings by NFκB, as demonstrated by the results shown in Fig. 7, in which transactivation mediated by Gal4/p65 was shown to be inhibited by retinoids. Overall, these results are similar to previously described results with steroid receptors (28Ray A. Prefontaine K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Since the NFκB interactions were subsequently mapped to the DNA binding C domain of the GR, the requirement for the GR LBD may have also reflected the importance of the AF2-dependent transcription coactivators (i.e. SRC-1 and CBP/p300). The retinoid receptor-NFκB interactions are likely to have wide implications in various aspects of retinoid and NFκB biology, not limited to the regulation of IL-12 production in macrophages described in this study. Both retinoids and NFκB have been shown to be involved with a wide variety of biological processes, including immunomodulation, embryonic development, spermatogenesis, and inhibition of cancer cell proliferation (reviewed in Ref. 52Rogers M.B. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 1997; 35: 1-46Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, this negative cross-talk could be relevant for tumor inhibitory actions of retinoids. Several lines of evidence suggested that constitutive activation of NFκB contributes to the malignant phenotype of tumor cells. A naturally occurring splice variant of RelA was shown to transform Rat-1 cells (53Narayanan R. Klement J.F. Ruben S.M. Higgins K.A. Rosen C.A. Science. 1992; 256: 367-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), whereas antisense oligonucleotides to RelA were shown to inhibit proliferation and tumorigenicity of several tumor cell lines, including the human breast cancer cell lines MCF7 and T47D (54Higgins K.A. Perez J.R. Coleman T.A. Dorshkind K. McComas W.A. Sarmiento U.M. Rosen C.A. Narayanan R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9901-9905Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). In addition, activation of NFκB through the disruption of IκBα regulation was shown to result in malignant transformation (55Beauparlant P. Kwan I. Bitar R. Chou P. Koromilas A.E. Sonenberg N. Hiscott J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3189-3197PubMed Google Scholar). In conclusion, we have shown that retinoid receptors form a transcriptionally inhibitory complex with NFκB. With the NFκB transactivation, in particular, this retinoid-mediated inhibitory action appeared to involve inhibition of the NFκB-DNA interactions as well as competitive recruitment of transcription integrators between NFκB and RXR. This transrepression between NFκB and retinoid receptors could play an important role in a large variety of biological processes. We thank Drs. Stanley Wolf and Yong Kyung Choe for reagents."

Several cofactors are crucial for the stimulation or the silencing of nuclear receptor transcriptional activities. The two homologous cofactors p300 and CREB-binding protein (CBP) have been shown to co-activate the ligand-dependent transcriptional activities of several nuclear receptors as well as the ligand-independent transcriptional activity of the androgen receptor. We show here that the interaction between p300/CBP and PPARγ is complex and involves multiple domains in each protein. p300/CBP not only bind in a ligand-dependent manner to the DEF region of PPARγ but also bind directly in a ligand-independent manner to a region in the AB domain localized between residue 31 to 99. In transfection experiments, p300/CBP could thereby enhance the transcriptional activities of both the activating function (AF)-1 and AF-2 domains. p300/CBP displays itself at least two docking sites for PPARγ located in its N terminus (between residues 1 and 113 for CBP) and in the middle of the protein (between residues 1099 and 1460).

PPARγ is an important transcription factor involved in adipocyte differentiation and glucose metabolism. The PPARγ gene gives rise to two different PPARγ proteins, i.e. PPARγ1 and PPARγ2. PPARγ2 differs from PPARγ1 by the presence at its N terminus of an additional 28-amino acid domain whose function is so far unknown (2Fajas L. Auboeuf D. Raspé E. Schoonjans K. Lefebvre A.-M.

To date, we have only a limited insight into the molecular basis by which PPARs control gene expression. Like other nuclear receptors, PPARs are suggested to have a modular structure consisting of six functional domains, A/B, C, D, and E/F (4Schoonjans K. Staels B. Auwerx J. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 907-925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The A/B and E/F regions are each endowed with transcriptional activities: the activating functions (AF)-1 and -2, respectively. The E/F region also the ligand binding domain (LBD) and the AF-2 is ligand-dependent. Classically it is suggested that ligand binding facilitates the heterodimerization of PPAR with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) and the binding of the PPAR/RXR heterodimers to peroxisome proliferator-responsive elements. Consecutively the ligand-activated heterodimer stimulates transcription of the target gene. In addition to this ligand-dependent regulation, it was recently demonstrated that the transcriptional activity of PPARs could be also altered by covalent modifications such as phosphorylation (5Hu E.

Furthermore, the transcriptional activity of nuclear receptors can be influenced by cofactors, such as co-activators or co-repressors, which modulate signaling and interaction with the basal transcription machinery (10Glass C.K. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 222-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Among the cofactors shown to modulate nuclear receptor transcriptional activities, p300 and the CREB-binding protein (CBP), two homologous co-activators, have recently attracted interest because of the pivotal role they play in the cross-talk between different signal transduction pathways (11Chakravarti D.

Acting as factors capable of both influencing chromatin structure and establishing contacts between the nuclear receptors and the basal transcription machinery, p300 and CBP provide a model to explain how nuclear receptors exert their effect on gene expression (14Abraham S.E.

Commun. 1997; 240: 61-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), using a yeast two-hybrid system, have shown an interaction between the ligand binding domain of PPARγ and CBP, they did not provide any evidence for a co-activation function or a physiological role for CBP in this interaction. The aim of this work was to evaluate more precisely the role of p300 and CBP in PPARγ-mediated gene expression. A detailed analysis of the interaction domains between PPARγ and p300/CBP revealed for the first time that PPARγ contacts p300/CBP not only through its DEF domain in a ligand-dependent manner but also through its AB domain in a ligand-independent manner. CBP itself contacts PPARγ through several domains located in its N terminus and in a region located in the middle of the protein. As a consequence, in transfection experiments, p300 was able to co-activate independently the AF-1- and AF-2-mediated transcriptional activities of PPARγ when its ABC domain, on the one hand, and its DEF domain, on the other hand, were fused to the yeast Gal4 DNA-binding domain. The finding that the interaction between a cofactor such as p300/CBP and nuclear receptors involves numerous domains in both partners might help to understand how the N terminus region is able to regulate the whole activity of nuclear receptors.

The p300Nt-GST, CBP-GST, and SRC1 fusion proteins were generated by cloning the N-terminal part of the p300 protein (aa 2 to 516), or different domains of CBP, or the domain comprised between amino acids 568 and 780 of SRC-1 downstream of the glutathioneS-transferase (GST) protein in the pGex-T1 vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Orsay, France). The p300Nt-GST and CBP-GST fusion proteins were then expressed in Escherichia coli and purified on a glutathione affinity matrix (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The PPARγ2AB1–146 (aa 1 to 146 of PPARγ), the PPARγ2ABC1–181 (aa 1 to 181 of PPARγ), and the PPARγ2DEF204–507 (aa 204 to 507 of PPARγ) proteins were produced following the same procedure, and the GST domain was removed by thrombin digestion. Polyclonal antibodies (5 μg) directed against the AB domain of PPARγ were added to nuclear extracts (150 μg at 0.5 mg/ml) prepared as described previously (32Dignam J.P. Lebowitz R.M. Roeder R.G.

The beads were then washed four times in pull-down buffer and boiled in 2× sample buffer. The samples were separated by 12% acrylamide SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Blots were developed with antibodies directed against PPARγ2AB or PPARγ2DEF. Different domains of hPPARγ2 were cloned in the pBDGal4 vector for the construction of bait plasmids (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA); the different parts of the ABC region as well as PPARγ2DEF181–507 were cloned by polymerase chain reaction amplification on the pSG5-PPARγ2 construct of the corresponding domains. The three PPARγ2DEF deletion constructs PPARγDEF181–501, PPARγDEF181–281, and PPARγDEF181–224 were generated by removing the 3′-ends of the PPARγ2DEF181–507 insert located downstream of theSalI, EcoRI, and BglII sites, respectively. The N-terminal part of p300 (aa 2 to 516) was cloned in the pADGal4 vector (Stratagene). The pADGal4-SV40 construct was purchased from Stratagene. YRG-2 competent yeasts (Stratagene) were transformed with different combinations of expression vectors following the instructions of the manufacturer and grown at 30 °C on synthetic medium agar plates in the presence of the appropriate amino acids for selection. When the Gal4-chimera proteins interact, induction of theHIS3 and the LacZ genes occur, and the yeasts can grow on histidine-deficient media. The β-galactosidase assay was performed as described before (30Vu-Dac N. Schoonjans K. Kosykh V. Dallongeville J. Fruchart J.-C. Staels B. Auwerx J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar) but with yeast lysates from saturated yeast cultures lyzed with acid-washed beads (Sigma). As p300 has been shown to co-activate the transcriptional activity of several nuclear receptors, we first addressed the question of whether the co-activator p300 could also enhance PPARγ2-mediated gene expression. HeLa cells were therefore co-transfected with the proliferator-responsive element-driven reporter construct pGL3-(Jwt)3TKCAT (30Vu-Dac N. Schoonjans K. Kosykh V. Dallongeville J. Fruchart J.-C. Staels B. Auwerx J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar), together with an expression vector for human PPARγ2 (pSG5-hPPARγ2) (2Fajas L. Auboeuf D. Raspé E.

Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 869-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar), in the presence or absence of BRL 49,653, a synthetic PPARγ ligand (33Lehmann J.M. Moore L.B. Smith-Oliver T.A. Wilkison W.O. Willson T. Kliewer S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12953-12956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3459) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). PPARγ transcriptional activity is stimulated in a dose-dependent way by co-transfection with the CMV p300-CHA expression vector. This effect is maximal in presence of 0.8 μg of CMV p300-CHA. To clarify the role of p300 toward each of the two PPARγ2 transcriptional activities (AF-1 and AF-2), we performed transfections with expression vectors coding for chimeric proteins composed of either the A, B, and C or the D, E, and F domains of hPPARγ2 fused to the binding domain of the Gal4 yeast transcription factor (BDGal4-hPPARγABC and BDGal4-hPPARγDEF, respectively, Fig. 2 A). These vectors were co-transfected in HeLa cells together with increasing amounts of CMV p300-CHA. Whereas we observed a significant stimulation of the transcriptional activity of the chimeric BDGal4-hPPARγABC protein by co-transfected p300, the stimulation of the DEF chimera was extremely weak (Fig. 2, Band C). These activities are maximally increased 2.4 times for BDGal4-hPPARγABC and 1.5 times for BDGal4-hPPARγDEF in presence of 60 and 100 ng of co-transfected pCMV p300-CHA, respectively. The AF-1 activity was stimulated in the absence of ligand, whereas BRL 49,653 was required for the stimulation of the AF-2 activity. Surprisingly, the BDGal4-hPPARγDEF chimera, lacking the ABC region, not only was weakly co-activated by p300 but also needed higher amounts of BRL 49,653 than the full-length receptor to be fully activated (10−6 versus 10−7m,respectively). The enhancement of PPARγ transcriptional activity by p300 suggested that the two molecules are part of the same protein complex driving gene expression. To verify this, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were carried out. HeLa cells were therefore transfected with different combinations of the pSG5hPPARγ2 and CMV p300-CHA expression constructs and of the corresponding empty expression vectors. PPARγ was then immunoprecipitated from the cell nuclear extracts with antibodies directed against its AB domain, either in presence or in absence of BRL 49,653. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-HA antibodies (Fig.3). A clear band corresponding to the p300-CHA protein with an approximate molecular mass of 270 kDa was observed only for the immunoprecipitates from cells co-transfected with both PPARγ and p300-CHA. For the immunoprecipitates from cells which had been transfected either by PPARγ or p300-CHA alone, no clear band was visible in the immunoblot. This specific co-immunoprecipitation of p300-CHA with PPARγ suggests that PPARγ and p300 associate in the cell. A 2-fold increase in the amount of immunoprecipitated p300-CHA was observed when BRL 49,653 was added. The association of p300 with PPARγ in a cellular environment could be due either to a direct interaction between the two molecules or to the interaction of both of them with a third partner, either a cofactor such as SRC-1, or a nuclear receptor such as RXR. To test the hypothesis of a direct interaction, pull-down experiments with purified proteins were carried out. The domain by which p300 interacts with the LBDs of other nuclear receptors has been localized in the N-terminal part of the protein (11Chakravarti D. LaMorte V.J. Nelson M.C. Nakajima T. Schulman I.G. Juguilon H. Montminy M. Evans R.M. Nature. 1996; 383: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar, 12Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss B. Lin S.-C. Heyman R.A. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. et al.Cell. 1996; 85: 403-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1923) Google Scholar). To verify that the same domain is involved in the interaction of p300 with PPARγ, the N-terminal part of p300 (amino acids from 2 to 516) was produced as a GST fusion protein in E. coli and purified. The PPARγ2AB1–146 (aa from 1 to 146 of PPARγ), the PPARγ2ABC1–181 (aa from 1 to 181 of PPARγ), and the PPARγ2DEF204–507 (aa from 204 to 507 of PPARγ) proteins were also produced and purified following the same procedure. The GST part of these proteins was then removed by thrombin cleavage. p300Nt-GST interacted with both the AB and the DEF domains of PPARγ2 but following two different modes: in a ligand-independent way with the AB domain (Fig. 4 A) and in a ligand-dependent way with the DEF domain of PPARγ2 (Fig. 4 B). The ligand-dependent interaction between the PPARγ2DEF and p300Nt-GST was enhanced by increasing amounts of BRL 49,653. Similar data were obtained when another synthetic PPARγ ligand, troglitazone, was used (data not shown). No interaction was detected with the GST protein alone. As each sub-region of PPARγ2 apparently displayed different properties for the binding to p300Nt, we studied the overall mode of interaction between the full-length receptor and its co-activator. In a pull-down experiment, full-length PPARγ2 produced with rabbit reticulocyte lysates or purified PPARγ2DEF were incubated with p300Nt-GST in presence or absence of BRL 49,653. Nonprogrammed reticulocyte lysate was added to the samples with purified PPARγ2DEF to rule out any artifact because of the potential presence of a PPARγ ligand in this crude lysate (used for the full-length PPARγ). In presence of ligand, both full-length PPARγ2 and PPARγ2DEF interacted with p300Nt (Fig.4 C), but in absence of ligand, only the interaction between full-length PPARγ2 and p300Nt was substantial, indicating that the ABC domain was also involved in the interaction of the full-length nuclear receptor with its co-activator and giving a potential explanation for the important ligand-independent association of p300 and PPARγ2 observed in the co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Because the direct interaction in vitro of p300/CBP with the ABC domain of a nuclear receptor had never been studied so far, we investigated more precisely the regions in CBP susceptible to contact this part of the receptor. We performed pull-down experiments using the purified PPARγ2ABC1–181or PPARγ2AB1–146 proteins and different sub-regions of CBP fused to the GST protein (Fig. 5,A and B). p300 and CBP contact the ABC domain of PPARγ2 mainly through their N-terminal part, i.e. aa from 2 to 516 for p300 (Fig. 5 A, lane 2), and aa from 1 to 113 for CBP (Fig. 5 B, lane 4). Surprisingly, another domain located between amino acids 1099 and 1460 of CBP displayed a weaker though unambiguous interaction with the ABC domain of PPARγ2 (Fig. 5 A, lanes 9 and 10). It appears therefore that p300/CBP and PPARγ2 can associate through multiple contact points. A constitutive interaction occurs in absence of any ligand because of the presence of the ABC domain. Upon ligand binding, the DEF domain also contacts the co-activator, thereby strengthening the association. It is noteworthy that the domain in the SRC-1 co-activator known to interact with the PPARγ ligand-binding domain (24Zhu Y. Qi C. Calandra C. Sambasiva R. Janardan K.R. Gene Expression. 1996; 6: 185-195PubMed Google Scholar) did not interact with the PPARγ N-terminal domain (Fig.5 B, lane 6), suggesting that the interaction observed with p300/CBP is specific. The yeast two-hybrid system provides a very sensitive and functional test to study interactions between p300 and PPARγ. Therefore, the N-terminal part of p300 (aa from 2 to 516) was cloned downstream of the activating domain of the Gal4 transcription factor (pADGal4-p300Nt), whereas different parts of hPPARγ were cloned downstream of the DNA binding domain of the Gal4 protein (Figs.6 A and7 A. In yeast, the BDGal4-PPARγ2DEF181–507 and the ADGal4-p300Nt fusion proteins interact without addition of any PPARγ ligand. It is unclear whether this interaction is because of the presence of potential PPARγ ligands in the yeast cells or whether a constitutive interaction between the DEF domain of PPARγ and the N-terminal part of p300 can actually occur in absence of any ligand in vivo(Fig. 6 A). This interaction is disrupted when the AF-2 domain of PPARγ is deleted, pointing to an important role for this domain in the interaction between the two molecules.Figure 7The N-terminal part of p300 interacts with the ABC domain of PPARγ in the yeast two-hybrid system. A, yeasts were co-transformed with bait vectors containing different parts of the ABC domain of hPPARγ2 (pBDGal4 constructs) and with the pADGal4-p300Nt or pADGal4-SV40 constructs. Growth on a histidine-deficient media is indicated by a “+.”B, yeasts were co-transformed with the pBDGal4-PPARγ2ABC1–182 bait vector and the pADGal4-p300Nt or pADGal4-SV40 constructs and grown in absence or presence of BRL 49,653 (10−6m). The β-galactosidase activity was then measured in each yeast culture lysate. Data are presented as means of triplicates ± S.D. The mean activity for the lysates from yeasts transformed with the pADGal4 vector and grown without BRL 49,653 was set to be 1.

The different constructs used suggest that the interaction domain in PPARγ2 is located between aa 31 and 99 and that the B exon of PPARγ2 is not required for this interaction. Beside the HIS3 reporter system, YRG-2 yeast cells also have a Gal4-dependent lacZ reporter system that can be quantified more easily. We used that quantitative system to further investigate the effect of the presence of a PPARγ ligand on the strength of the interaction between p300Nt and PPARγ2DEF181–507 or PPARγ2ABC1–182(Figs. 6 B and 7 B). Similar to the pull-down experiments, two distinct mechanisms of interaction for the two domains of PPARγ2 and p300 were observed.

In situ hybridization in adjacent coronal sections of rat parietal cortex using 35S-labeled antisense riboprobes indicates that mRNAs for both gb1 and gb2 receptors are coexpressed in this brain region (Fig. 1,A and B). No hybridization signal was detected with the control 35S-labeled sense gb1 and gb2 riboprobes (data not shown). To examine expression at the cellular level, digoxigenin-labeled gb1 and radiolabeled gb2 riboprobes were hybridized to the same sections (Fig. 1, C and D). Overlay of the gb1 and gb2 hybridization signals revealed that messages for both receptors are generally expressed in the same neurons (Fig.1 E). In other major brain regions, including the hippocampus, thalamus, and cerebellum,3 gb2 and gb1 receptor mRNAs are colocalized with ≥95% of gb2 expressing cells also expressing gb1. This suggests that their coexpression may be required for activity in these neurons. In melanophores transiently cotransfected with the mgb1a and hgb2 receptors, GABA mediated a dose-dependent pigment aggregation response with an IC50 value of 3–7 μM (n = 3), which is absent in mock-transfected cells and cells transfected with the mgb1a or hgb2 alone (Fig. 2). The GABA-mediated inhibitory activity represented 42–56% (n = 3) of a control Gi-coupled CB2 cannabinoid receptor response (Fig.2, inset). GABA activity could be inhibited by the CGP71872 antagonist (n = 3), indicating that this was GABAB receptor-specific (Fig. 2). To confirm the observations that functional GABAB receptor results from the coexpression of gb1a and gb2 receptors and that it is Gi-coupled, we directly examined modulation of cAMP levels in HEK-293 cells. In cell lines stably expressing the individual receptors we observed small and inconsistent responses in assays to examine agonist-mediated modulation of cAMP synthesis (Fig.3). However, transient hgb2 transfection of HEK-293 cells stably expressing rgb1a (rgb1a-50) and transient rgb1a transfection of HEK-293 cells stably expressing hgb2 (hgb2-42) significantly enhanced the ability of baclofen and GABA to inhibit forskolin-stimulated cAMP synthesis. Hgb2-42/rgb1a and rgb1a-50/hgb2 cells exhibited 28 and 34% reductions in forskolin-stimulated cAMP synthesis with 30 μm baclofen and 40 and 43% decreases with 30 μm GABA, respectively (Fig. 3). Although inhibition of cAMP synthesis was sometimes observed with rgb1a-50/rgb1a and hgb2-42/hgb2, these effects were relatively small (0–20% inhibition; Fig. 3) when compared with those observed with the coexpressing cells. Neither baclofen nor GABA in the absence of forskolin had any effect on cAMP synthesis (Fig. 3). In addition, wild-type HEK-293 cells did not exhibit baclofen- or GABA-mediated inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP synthesis (Fig. 3). These data demonstrate that the functional GABAB receptor requires both the gb1 and gb2 receptors for signaling via adenylyl cyclase. Native functional GABAB receptors have been reported to couple to Kirs (3Misgeld U. Bijak M. Jarolimek W. Prog. Neurobiol. 1995; 46: 423-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Co-expression of the mgb1a and hgb2 with Kir 3.1/3.2 resulted in a significant stimulation of Kir current in response to GABA (301 ± 20.6% (n = 3) increase over control current) measured at −80 mV, which could subsequently be washed out with control solution (Fig. 4) or blocked with the CGP71872 antagonist (data not shown).Modulation of Kir 3.1/3.2 was not seen in oocytes expressing mgb1a or hgb2 individually even in the presence of Giα1 (Fig. 4). The dependence of functional GABAB receptor activity on the coexpression of gb1a and gb2 suggests that these receptors may undergo heterodimerization. Immunoblot analysis revealed selective expression of mgb1a monomers and homodimers in mgb1a and mgb1a/FLAG-gb2 expressing cells and expression of FLAG-gb2 receptors in FLAG-gb2 and mgb1a/FLAG-gb2 expressing cells (Fig.5, lanes 1–8). To demonstrate the existence of gb1a-gb2 heterodimers, we utilized a differential co-immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting strategy. Anti-gb1 receptor antibodies were used to blot receptors immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibodies (Fig. 5, lanes 9–12). No mgb1a immunoreactivity was detected in samples prepared from mock vector transfected cells, FLAG-gb2 expressing cells, and mgb1a receptor expressing cells as expected because these species could not be immunoprecipitated with the anti-FLAG antibody and detected with the anti-gb1 antibody (Fig. 5, lanes 9–11). Immunoreactive ∼250- (representing the mgb1a-gb2 heterodimer) and ∼130-kDa species (representing the mgb1a monomer) were detected only in cells coexpressing the mgb1a and FLAG-gb2 receptors, demonstrating that gb1a and gb2 can only be co-immunoprecipitated as part of a complex (Fig. 5,lane 12). Similar demonstration of gb1a-gb2 heterodimerization was obtained when coexpressed receptors were immunoprecipitated first with anti-gb1 antibodies followed by immunoblotting with the anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 5, lane 16). The ∼250-kDa species represents the heterodimer, whereas the ∼130-kDa species represents the FLAG-gb2 monomer. No FLAG-gb2 immunoreactivity was detected in samples prepared from mock vector transfected cells, FLAG-gb2 expressing cells and mgb1a receptor expressing cells as expected because these species could not be immunoprecipitated with the anti-gb1 antibody and detected with the anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 5, lanes 13–15). The gb1a-gb2 heterodimer, which is stable in SDS, might result from SDS-resistant intermolecular transmembrane interactions as reported for the formation of β2-adrenergic and dopamine D2 receptor homodimers (5Ng G.Y.K.

Loisel T.P. Bichet D.G. Barret C. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 272: 29229-29327Google Scholar). The monomer presumably results from partial disruption of protein-protein binding domains (Sushi Repeats) or C-terminal α-helical domains in mgb1a.2 Disulfide bonds may also contribute to dimer formation as has been reported for the structurally related metabotropic glutamate receptor (7Romano C. Yang W. O'Malley K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28612-28616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). We have shown in three disparate expression systems that coexpression of the gb1 and gb2 receptors is required for functional GABAB receptor activity. That the two receptors are co-immunoprecipitated is consistent with the formation of heterodimers. We cannot rule out the possibility that either receptor may function as a monomeric or homodimeric receptor in the appropriate native cells. Indeed there are regions of the brain, such as caudate/putamen, where gb1 mRNA is abundant and gb2 mRNA is undetectable (Fig. 1,A and B). In such regions gb1 would either require a different subunit or function as a monomer or homodimer. However, our in situ hybridization analysis indicates that in brain regions expressing gb2, gb1 is expressed in a majority of the same neurons, suggesting that native receptors are heterodimers in these cells. GPCRs are commonly thought of as monomeric receptors. However, in light of our functional data and in situhybridization findings, it seems appropriate to consider the gb1 and gb2 receptor proteins to be subunits of a functional GABABreceptor.

https://openalex.org/W2035771357,"The ability of neuronal growth cones to be guided by extracellular cues requires intimate communication between signal transduction systems and the dynamic actin-based cytoskeleton at the leading edge. Profilin, a small, actin-binding protein, has been proposed to be a regulator of the cell motility machinery at leading edge membranes. However, its requirement in the developing nervous system has been unknown. Profilin associates with members of the Enabled family of proteins, suggesting that Profilin might link Abl function to the cytoskeleton. Here, genetic analysis in Drosophila is used to demonstrate that mutations in Profilin (chickadee) and Abl (abl) display an identical growth cone arrest phenotype for axons of intersegmental nerve b (ISNb). Moreover, the phenotype of a double mutant suggests that these components function together to control axonal outgrowth."

Mutation of d-axin resulted in the accumulation of cytoplasmic Armadillo and one of the Wingless target gene products, Distal-less. Ectopic expression of d-axin inhibited Wingless signaling. Hence, D-Axin negatively regulates Wingless signaling by down-regulating the level of Armadillo.

We have found that neuronal identity relies on the abnormal chemosensory jump 6 (acj6) gene, originally identified by a defect in olfactory behavior. Physiological analysis of individual olfactory neurons shows that in acj6 mutants, a subset of neurons acquires a different odorant response profile. Certain other neurons do not respond to any tested odors in acj6. Molecular analysis of acj6 shows that it encodes a POU-domain transcription factor expressed in olfactory neurons. Our data suggest that the odor response spectrum of an olfactory neuron, and perhaps the choice of receptor genes, is determined through a process requiring the action of Acj6."
https://openalex.org/W2078075441,Segregation Distorter (SD) in Drosophila melanogaster is a naturally occurring meiotic drive system in which the SD chromosome is transmitted from SD/SD+ males in vast excess over its homolog owing to the induced dysfunction of SD+-bearing spermatids. The Sd locus is the key distorting gene responsible for this phenotype. A genomic fragment from the Sd region conferred full distorting activity when introduced into the appropriate genetic background by germline transformation. The only functional product encoded by this fragment is a truncated version of the RanGAP nuclear transport protein. These results demonstrate that this mutant RanGAP is the functional Sd product.
https://openalex.org/W2000769863,"The two homologous presenilins are key factors for the generation of amyloid β-peptide (Aβ), since Alzheimer's disease (AD)-associated mutations enhance the production of the pathologically relevant 42-amino acid Aβ (Aβ42), and a gene knockout of presenilin-1 (PS1) significantly inhibits total Aβ production. Presenilins undergo proteolytic processing within the domain encoded by exon 9, a process that may be closely related to their biological and pathological activity. An AD-associated mutation within the PS1 gene deletes exon 9 (PS1Δexon9) due to a splicing error and results in the accumulation of the uncleaved full-length protein. We now demonstrate the unexpected finding that the pathological activity of PS1Δexon9 is independent of its lack to undergo proteolytic processing, but is rather due to a point mutation (S290C) occurring at the aberrant exon 8/10 splice junction. Mutagenizing the cysteine residue at position 290 to the original serine residue completely inhibits the pathological activity in regard to the elevated production of Aβ42. Like PS1Δexon9, the resulting presenilin variant (PS1Δexon9 C290S) accumulates as an uncleaved protein and fully replaces endogenous presenilin fragments. Moreover, PS1Δexon9 C290S exhibits a significantly increased biological activity in a highly sensitive in vivo assay as compared with the AD-associated mutation. Therefore not only the increased Aβ42 production but also the decreased biological function of PS1Δexon9 is due to a point mutation and independent of the lack of proteolytic processing.

Aβ peptides were immunoprecipitated using antibody 6E10 (Senetek) according to established protocols (21Haass C. Schlossmacher M. Hung A.Y. Vigo-Pelfrey C. Mellon A. Ostaszewski B. Lieberburg I.

Zweckbronner I. Jakubek C. Grünberg J. Haass C. Genes Funct. 1997; 1: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Transgenic lines were established by microinjection of plasmid DNA mixtures into the C. elegans germ line to create extrachromosomal arrays as described previously (22Baumeister R. Leimer U. Zweckbronner I. Jakubek C. Grünberg J. Haass C. Genes Funct. 1997; 1: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). All plasmids used in this study were injected at a concentration of 20 ng/μl intosel-12(ar171) or sel-12(ar171)unc-1(e538) hermaphrodites along with ttx-3:GFP as a cotransformation marker. Successful transformation was monitored by the expression of GFP in the AIY interneurons of F1 and F2 generation animals. Four independent lines from the progeny of F2 generation animals were established. As the sel-12(ar171) animals never lay eggs (23Levitan D. Greenwald I. Nature. 1995; 377: 351-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar), rescue of the sel-12 defect can be quantified by scoring egg laying behavior in transgenic animals (22Baumeister R. Leimer U.

Consequently, for each transgenic line, we examined 50 transgenic animals for their ability to lay eggs and determined their brood size. The number of eggs laid by individual transgenic animals was counted and placed into four categories: “Egl+++,” robust egg laying, more than 30 eggs laid (wt phenotype); “Egl++,” 15–30 eggs laid; “Egl+,” 5–15 eggs laid; “Egl−,” no eggs laid. The PS1Δexon9 mutation changes a G to a T at the splice site for exon 9. It therefore destroys the minimal required consensus sequence for the splice acceptor site (8Perez-Tur J. Froehlich S. Prihar G. Crook R. Baker M. Duff K. Wragg M. Busfield F. Lendon C. Clark R.F. Roques P. Fuldner R.A. Johnston J. Cowburn R. Forsell C. Axelman K. Lilius L. Houlden H. Karran E. Roberts G.W. Rossor M. Adams M.D. Hardy J. Goate A. Lannfelt L. Hutton M. Neuroreport. 1995; 7: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), which then results in an aberrant deletion of the domain encoded by exon 9 (Ref. 8Perez-Tur J. Froehlich S. Prihar G. Crook R. Baker M. Duff K. Wragg M. Busfield F. Lendon C. Clark R.F. Roques P. Fuldner R.A. Johnston J. Cowburn R. Forsell C. Axelman K. Lilius L. Houlden H. Karran E. Roberts G.W. Rossor M. Adams M.D. Hardy J. Goate A. Lannfelt L. Hutton M. Neuroreport. 1995; 7: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar; Fig.1 A). However, the mutation also changes codon 290 at the exon 8/10 splice junction from a serine to a cysteine (Ref. 8Perez-Tur J. Froehlich S. Prihar G. Crook R. Baker M. Duff K. Wragg M. Busfield F. Lendon C. Clark R.F. Roques P. Fuldner R.A. Johnston J. Cowburn R. Forsell C. Axelman K. Lilius L. Houlden H. Karran E. Roberts G.W. Rossor M. Adams M.D. Hardy J. Goate A. Lannfelt L. Hutton M. Neuroreport. 1995; 7: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar; Fig. 1 A). We therefore have investigated if the single amino acid exchange or the deletion of the domain required for proteolytic processing is responsible for the pathological activity of the PS1Δexon9 mutation in regard to Aβ42 generation. For this purpose we mutagenized amino acid 290 of PS1Δexon9 to a serine (PS1Δexon9 C290S), thus correcting the point mutation (Fig. 1 A). cDNAs encoding PS1Δexon9 and PS1Δexon9 C290S were stably transfected into kidney 293 cells overexpressing βAPP containing the Swedish mutation. This cell line was used previously to determine the pathological effect of PS mutations on Aβ production (12Steiner H. Capell A. Pesold B. Citron M. Kloetzel P.-M. Selkoe D. Romig H. Mendla K.

Untransfected K293 cells expressing endogenous PS, as well as cell lines overexpressing PS1Δexon9 and PS1Δexon9 C290S were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine for 1 h, and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibody 3027 to the large loop of PS1. Both PS1Δexon9 and PS1Δexon9 C290S accumulated as full-length proteins (Fig. 1 B). As reported previously (9Thinakaran G. Borchelt D.R. Lee M.K. Slunt H.H. Spitzer L. Kim G. Ratovitsky T.

It has been shown before that overexpression of PS proteins results in the replacement of endogenous PS fragments and the accumulation of PS1Δexon9 prevents the formation of stable PS fragments (9Thinakaran G.

To prove that overexpression of PS1Δexon9 C290S still allows the reduction of endogenous PS fragments, cell lysates from unlabeled cells were immunoprecipitated with antibodies specific to the PS1 or PS2 loop domain (see “Experimental Procedures”), and PS fragments were identified with the PS1/PS2-specific monoclonal antibodies BI.3D7 and BI.HF5C (see “Experimental Procedures”). Whereas cell lines expressing endogenous presenilins produced PS1 as well as PS2 C-terminal fragments (Fig. 1, C and D), overexpression of PS1Δexon9 and PS1Δexon9 C290S inhibited the formation of endogenous PS1 and PS2 fragments (Fig. 1, C andD). This demonstrates that PS1Δexon9 C290S, like PS1Δexon9, fully replaced presenilins derived from the endogenous genes and also proves that PS1Δexon9 C290S does not undergo proteolytic processing but rather accumulates as an uncleaved full-length protein. In order to investigate the pathological activity of the mutant PS derivatives on Aβ production, control cells as well as cells overexpressing PS1Δexon9 and PS1Δexon9 C290S were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine, and Aβ40 and Aβ42 peptides were immunoprecipitated from the conditioned medium using antibody 6E10. This antibody is raised to Aβ1–17 and therefore recognizes Aβ40 as well as Aβ42 (see “Experimental Procedures”). Isolated Aβ peptides were then separated on a previously described gel system, which allows the specific resolution of Aβ40 and Aβ42 (25Klafki H.-W. Wilfang J. Staufenbiel M. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 237: 24-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.2A, cells overexpressing PS1Δexon9 secreted elevated levels of Aβ42 as compared with control cells. In contrast, the cell line stably transfected with PS1Δexon9 C290S produced significantly lower amounts of Aβ42 as cells expressing the Alzheimer's disease-associated PS1Δexon9 mutation. This suggests that the pathological activity of the PS1Δexon9 mutation is due to the point mutation generated at the aberrant splice junction. In order to quantitate Aβ42 and Aβ40 production, we used a previously described specific ELISA (12Steiner H. Capell A. Pesold B. Citron M. Kloetzel P.-M. Selkoe D. Romig H. Mendla K. Haass C. J.

In contrast, the cell line stably overexpressing PS1Δexon9 C290S showed no increased Aβ42/Aβtotal ratio (Fig. 2 B). Therefore using two different approaches we can show that the pathological activity of PS1Δexon9 is independent of its lack of proteolytic processing but is rather caused by the single amino acid change at the aberrant splice junction. Having demonstrated that PS1Δexon9 C290S is pathologically inactive, we also wanted to test if this protein is sufficient to rescue alin-12-mediated signaling defect that is a result of a mutant PS homologue (sel-12) in Caenorhabditis elegans (23Levitan D. Greenwald I. Nature. 1995; 377: 351-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). As reported previously, transgenic expression of human presenilins rescues the phenotype caused by mutations ofsel-12 (22Baumeister R. Leimer U. Zweckbronner I. Jakubek C. Grünberg J. Haass C. Genes Funct. 1997; 1: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 24Levitan D. Doyle T. Brousseau D. Lee M. Thinakaran G. Slunt H. Sisodia S. Greenwald I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14940-14944Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). In contrast, transgenic expression of the PS1Δexon9 variant in C. elegans resulted in an incomplete rescue of the sel-12 mutant phenotype, as indicated by a significantly reduced brood size and reduced egg laying (Refs. 22Baumeister R. Leimer U. Zweckbronner I. Jakubek C. Grünberg J. Haass C. Genes Funct. 1997; 1: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar and24Levitan D. Doyle T. Brousseau D. Lee M. Thinakaran G. Slunt H.

In order to assess the in vivo function of PS1Δexon9 C290S, we tested its ability to rescue the putative sel-12 null allelear171 (23Levitan D. Greenwald I. Nature. 1995; 377: 351-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Four independent transgenic strains expressing PS1Δexon9 C290S displayed robust egg laying (Table I). Based on both numbers of laid progeny and numbers of eggs in utero, the phenotype of these strains is almost indistinguishable of that of wild type worms (Table I). These results demonstrate that PS1Δexon9 C290S rescues the egg laying phenotype of the sel-12(ar171) mutant animals significantly better than PS1Δexon9 (Table I). Therefore, the reduced biological activity of PS1Δexon9 is also due to a single point mutation and completely independent of the lack of proteolytic processing.Table IRescue of the sel-12 egg laying defect by human PS genes expressed from the sel-12 promoterStrainTransgeneGenotypeEgg laying behavior++++++−N2Wild type50000BR1029Vectorsel-12(ar171)00050BR1083PS1Δexon9sel-12(ar171)311630BR1092PS1Δexon9 C290Ssel-12(ar171)49010BR1093PS1Δexon9 C290Ssel-12(ar171)47210BR1094PS1Δexon9 C290Ssel-12(ar171)47300BR1095PS1Δexon9 C290Ssel-12(ar171)49100For 50 transgenic animals each, the numbers of progeny were counted and grouped in the following categories: +++, over 30 progeny laid by individual animal; ++, 15–30 progeny laid; +, 5–15 progeny laid; −, no progeny laid.

It was backcrossed several times from the strain originally published (23Levitan D. Greenwald I. Nature. 1995; 377: 351-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Open table in a new tab For 50 transgenic animals each, the numbers of progeny were counted and grouped in the following categories: +++, over 30 progeny laid by individual animal; ++, 15–30 progeny laid; +, 5–15 progeny laid; −, no progeny laid.

It was backcrossed several times from the strain originally published (23Levitan D. Greenwald I. Nature. 1995; 377: 351-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that the pathological effect of the PS1Δexon9 mutation is independent of its lack of proteolytic cleavage and the deletion of the exon 9-encoded domain. Reverting the cysteine residue generated by the exon 8/10 splice junction at codon 290 back to its wt residue (serine) still inhibits its proteolytic processing, causes an accumulation of the uncleaved protein, and prevents formation of endogenous PS fragments. Although the artificially generated PS1Δexon9 C290S variant behaves like PS1Δexon9 in regard to the characteristic biochemical features described above, it does not allow pathological overproduction of Aβ42. Moreover, PS1Δexon9 C290S regains full biological activity in a very sensitive in vivoassay system. This demonstrates that not only the pathological overproduction of Aβ42 but also the reduced biological function is due to the single amino acid exchange. Therefore, similar to all other known PS mutations, the pathological effect of the PS1Δexon9 mutation is due to a rather subtle amino acid exchange at a single highly conserved codon whereas the large deletion of the complete domain encoded by exon 9 does not affect the biological and pathological function. However, consistent with our previous results (27Capell A. Grünberg J. Pesold B. Diehlmann A. Citron M. Nixon R. Beyreuther K. Selkoe D. Haass C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3205-3211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), we suggest that PS molecules lacking the domain encoded by exon 9 mimic a proteolytically processed and biologically active PS complex and therefore rescue the phenotype of the mutant nematode. Consequently, the rescuing activity of PS1Δexon9 is significantly enhanced when the pathologically relevant point mutation at codon 290 is reverted to the wt residue. It remains to be shown if the mutation at codon 290 is also pathologically active within the full-length protein like all other AD-associated point mutations. It may however be possible that the mutation only exhibits a pathological activity if it is aberrantly flanked by the domains encoded by exons 8 and 10. Structural changes that may specifically occur in the PS1Δexon9 molecule (12Steiner H. Capell A. Pesold B. Citron M. Kloetzel P.-M. Selkoe D. Romig H. Mendla K. Haass C. J. Biol.

Based on our results it would be interesting to investigate if the point mutations in the PS genes require the endoproteolytic cleavage for their pathological activity. Therefore artificial PS molecules should be generated containing an AD associated mutation as well as the smallest possible alteration of the sequence at the cleavage site which would inhibit PS processing. However, such mutations might be very difficult to generate since PS can be cleaved at multiple sites (10Podlisny M. Citron M. Amarante P. Sherrington R. Xia W. Zhang J. Diehl T. Levesque G.

Synchrotron radiation measurements, performed on C 60 samples quenched from 13 gigapascals and 820 kelvin, yield unambiguous proof for the existence of a three-dimensional (3D) polymerized C 60 derivative. Moreover, unusual ellipsoidal Debye-Scherrer diffraction patterns are observed, which shows that the giant anisotropic deformation induced by the nonhydrostatic compression is retained in the quenched samples. The multiple bonding possibilities of the highly symmetrical C 60 allow the retention (down to ambient pressure) of the deformation, a phenomenon reported previously only under high pressure."

Neuron. 1997; 19: 735-741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). A cell labeling method is reported here that combines the site specificity conferred by genetically encoded targeting sequences with the excellent spectral and indicator properties of small chemical fluorophores. The strategy is to express a high affinity “receptor” at a specified intracellular location to trap a conjugate of a fluorophore linked to a receptor “ligand” (Fig.1 a). We chose a single-chain antibody (sFv) (12Chestnut J.D. Baytan A.R. Russell M. Chang M. Bernard A. Maxwell I.H. Hoeffler J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1996; 193: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) as the receptor and a hapten (phOx) as the ligand. Although many receptor-ligand pairs are possible, the antibody-hapten pair was selected because of the simple ligand-probe chemistry and high affinity interaction without interference from cellular factors. For sFv targeting, cells are transfected with cDNAs encoding sFv in fusion with targeting sequences. Fluorophore-hapten conjugates are added to the extracellular solution at low concentrations, diffuse to sites of sFv expression, and bind to the sFv. Conjugates of different indicator and spectral properties were synthesized (Fig.1 b), including phOx-Bodipy FL (green fluorescent), phOx-fluorescein (green fluorescent, pH-sensitive), and phOx-tetramethylrhodamine (red fluorescent). The flexible linkers were designed to permit stacking of the unbound hapten with its covalently attached fluorophore to form a dark complex and reduce background fluorescence. The ability to label cellular sites with fluorescent probes with varied spectral and indicator properties was demonstrated, and the phOx-fluorescein conjugate was applied to measure pH in the Golgi lumen. Here we report the first in vivo measurement of the regulation of the pump rate of the vacuolar H+/ATPase by Golgi lumenal pH to test the thermodynamic model (13Rybak S.L. Lanni F. Murphy R.F. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 674-687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) of how the resting pH is set in organelles such as the Golgi. The cDNA encoding the sFv (25-kDa protein) and two c-Myc epitopes was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the plasmid pHook1 (12Chestnut J.D. Baytan A.R. Russell M. Chang M. Bernard A. Maxwell I.H. Hoeffler J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1996; 193: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) (Invitrogen) as template, with sense primer (5′GGAATTCGCCGAGGTCAAGCTGCAGGAG3′) containing an EcoRI site (underlined) and antisense primer containing an XbaI site (underlined) (5′GCTCTAGACTGGCCCACAGCATTCAGATCCTC3′). For ER and Golgi targeting, the cDNA was subcloned at EcoRI andXbaI sites in expression plasmid pCDNA3.1 containing specific targeting sequences as described in Ref. 6Kneen M. Farinas J. Li Y. Verkman A.S. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 1591-1600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar. Plasma membrane targeting was achieved with the pHook1 plasmid (12Chestnut J.D. Baytan A.R. Russell M. Chang M. Bernard A. Maxwell I.H. Hoeffler J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1996; 193: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). CHO cells (ATCC CRL 9618) were transfected with plasmids encoding targeted sFv using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described previously (6Kneen M. Farinas J. Li Y. Verkman A.S. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 1591-1600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). A flexible linker was added to phOx (Sigma) by reaction of 50 mg of phOx with 14.3 μl of 1,5-diaminopentane (Aldrich) in 2.5 ml of acetone for 1 h. The disubstituted aminopentane was precipitated by the addition of 2 volumes of 50 mm borate buffer (pH 9.2), leaving the product in solution. A more rigid linker was added to phOx by reaction of trans-1,4-diaminocyclohexane (Aldrich) (5.1 mg in 0.5 ml of Me2SO) and phOx (10 mg in 0.5 ml of acetone) for 2 h. The disubstituted diaminocyclohexane was precipitated by the addition of an equal volume of water, leaving the product in solution. phOx-Bodipy FL was prepared by reaction of excess Bodipy FL succinimidyl ester (Molecular Probes) with 1 mmphOx-aminopentane in borate buffer for 2 h. The product was obtained as a precipitate. PhOx-tetramethylrhodamine was prepared by reaction of excess tetramethylrhodamine succinimidyl ester (Molecular Probes) with 5 mm phOx-aminocyclohexane in borate buffer for 6 h. The product was obtained as a precipitate. phOx-fluorescein was prepared by reaction of equimolar amounts of phOx (0.5 mg in 25 μl of acetone) and fluorescein cadaverine (1 mg in 50 μl of dimethylformamide; Molecular Probes) for 1 h. Phosphate-buffered saline was added, unreacted phOx was removed by hexane extraction, and the product was extracted with butanol. phOx-ethanolamine was prepared by reaction of 1 mg of phOx with 0.3 μl of ethanolamine in 10 ml of ethanol for 1 h. Reactions were conducted at room temperature. Products were judged to be >95% pure by TLC, and structures were confirmed by mass spectrometry. Cells were labeled at 2 days after transfection by incubation with low concentrations (<100 nm) of the conjugates. Unless otherwise indicated, cells were observed in the absence of the conjugate in the bathing media. Images were recorded at room temperature on a K2 BIO microscope (Technical Instruments) equipped with a 60× PlanApo objective (Nikon, N.A. 1.4), coaxial-confocal attachment, and cooled CCD camera. Dual excitation ratio images of fluorescein were acquired using 440- and 490-nm excitation filters and a 520-nm long pass emission filter. Continuous recordings of the fluorescence time course were obtained on a Nikon Diaphot epifluorescence microscope equipped with a 100× PlanApo objective (Nikon, N.A. 1.4), a photomultiplier using a 530-nm bandpass emission filter, and an optical filter changer (model 10-C, Sutter Instrument Co.) containing 440- and 490-nm excitation filters. Cuvette fluorescence measurements were conducted on an SLM 8000c fluorometer (SLM Aminco). Spectra were recorded with 4-nm slit widths; time courses were acquired with 495-nm excitation and 510-nm long pass emission filters. For effective targeting, the requirements of the sFv/hapten-fluorophore system include: bright fluorescence of the bound conjugate, high affinity binding of the conjugate to sFv, stability of the conjugate, minimal cellular toxicity, strong cellular expression of functional sFv, and membrane permeability of the conjugate. These requirements were fulfilled for cellular sFv expression (using the Golgi, ER, and plasma membrane vectors) and binding of the conjugates in Fig. 1 c. Fluorescence spectra of phOx-fluorescein bound to sFv and of unbound phOx-fluorescein in solution had similar spectral shapes (Fig. 1 c). As intended, the fluorescence of the unbound conjugate was decreased considerably (by 5-fold) over that of the bound conjugate. Images of CHO cells expressing sFv at the plasma membrane were acquired with increasing concentration of phOx-fluorescein. The fluorescence from sFv-bound phOx-fluorescein gave a dissociation constant (K d) of 6.8 nm(Fig. 1 d). This agrees with the value of 5.5 nmobtained in CHO cell suspensions expressing sFv at the plasma membrane (not shown). At 10 nm phOx-fluorescein, fluorescence from free dye was 75 times lower than that of bound dye. No significant fluorescence from non-sFv-expressing cells was seen. The toxicity and stability of the conjugates were investigated. There were no differences in cell growth as assessed by cell counting and viability as assessed by trypan blue exclusion between control cells and cells incubated for 24 h with 200 nm of each conjugate. The stability of the imine bond in the conjugates was determined in cells. In freshly prepared phOx-fluorescein and phOx-fluorescein incubated with cell suspensions for up to 7 h, the imine bond was hydrolyzed in 0.5 m NaOH, resulting in increased fluorescence. The fluorescence increase after treatment with NaOH was the same in both samples, indicating that the imine bond was not hydrolyzed in cells. The various sFv targeting constructs and phOx conjugates were studied in CHO cells. Fig. 2 a shows a fluorescence image of living cells expressing the sFv at the plasma membrane and labeled with phOx-rhodamine. A plasma membrane staining pattern was found. Fig. 2 b shows staining of sFv in the same cells with a fluorescein-labeled anti-c-Myc antibody. Comparison with Fig. 2 a demonstrates that only sites of sFv expression were significantly labeled with phOx-rhodamine. There was no significant staining of adjacent cells that did not express sFv (Fig.2 c). Fig. 2 d shows specific phOx-Bodipy staining of Golgi. Staining was reversed by addition of 1 μmphOx-ethanolamine (Fig. 2 e) but not by 1 μmethanolamine. Fig. 2 f shows phOx-Bodipy staining of ER, seen as a characteristic reticular pattern. The high expression level of the sFv, the relatively high affinity of the hapten/sFv, and the low fluorescence of the unbound conjugate allowed images to be obtained in the presence of <10 nm of unbound conjugate with little contribution from free conjugate. Leakage out of the Golgi, which required dissociation from the sFv and diffusion through lipid membranes and unstirred layers, had a half-time of tens of minutes. The subcellular location of expressed sFv was confirmed by immunofluorescence. Cells transfected with the Golgi-sFv construct showed perinuclear staining by a fluorescein-labeled, anti-c-Myc antibody (Fig. 2 g), which colocalized with staining by antibodies against the Golgi marker 58-kDa protein (14Bloom G.S. Brashear T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16083-16092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig.2 h). Cells transfected with the ER-sFv construct showed a reticular staining pattern with the c-Myc antibody (Fig.2 i), which colocalized with staining by fluorescein-labeled concanavalin A, an ER marker (15Virtanen I. Ekblom P. Laurila P. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 85: 429-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 j). The membrane permeability of the conjugates was high enough to load cells by incubation at 37 °C for 4 h for phOx-fluorescein, 2 h for phOx-rhodamine, or 10 min for the less polar phOx-Bodipy. Cells could be loaded at 4 °C, indicating that the conjugate entered the cells primarily by transmembrane diffusion and not by endocytosis. These results demonstrate the selective targeting of fluorescent probes to expressed sFv in living cells. Organelle-specific sFv targeting was applied to measure Golgi pH using phOx-fluorescein as the probe. Ratio images were calculated from images of Golgi labeled with phOx-fluorescein acquired at 440- and 490-nm excitation wavelengths. To convert ratios to absolute pH, cells were perfused with “calibration buffers” at different pH values containing high K+ and the ionophore monensin to equalize extracellular and Golgi lumenal pH. The dependence of the fluorescence ratio on pH was measured for Golgi and plasma membrane-expressed sFv (Fig. 3 a). The apparent pK a of 6.56 of bound phOx-fluorescein was not different from that of unbound phOx-fluorescein in solution (pK a = 6.54). The average Golgi fluorescence ratio of 1.05 ± 0.05 corresponds to a pH of 6.25 ± 0.06, in agreement with previous estimates (7Llopis J. McCaffery J.M. Miyawaki A. Farquhar M.G. Tsien R.Y Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6803-6808Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar, 16Seksek O. Biwersi J. Verkman A.S. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1387-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The Golgi-targeted phOx-fluorescein was used to detect continuous changes in lumenal pH in individual cells. Fig. 3 b shows that the fluorescence ratio increases upon addition of the vacuolar H+ pump inhibitor bafilomycin A1. The ratios measured using calibration buffers were used to convert fluorescence ratios to pH (scale at right). Golgi pH initially at ∼6.3 promptly alkalinized after the addition of bafilomycin A1. It has been proposed that the steady-state Golgi pH is determined thermodynamically by the free energy of ATP hydrolysis used by the vacuolar H+/ATPase to pump H+ against an electrochemical gradient (13Rybak S.L. Lanni F. Murphy R.F. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 674-687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To test the model prediction that the H+ pump rate is 0 at steady-state pH, the rates of Golgi H+ pump and leak were measured as a function of Golgi lumenal pH. After Golgi alkalinization by a 20 mm sodium acetate prepulse, H+ pumping into the Golgi restores steady-state pH (Fig. 3 c). The initial rate of pH change (dashed line) is the difference between pump and leak rates: dpH/dt = (dH+/dt leak − dH+/dt pump)/β. The buffer capacity, β, was measured by the NH4Cl pulse method (18Roos A. Boron W.F. Physiol. Rev. 1981; 61: 296-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (2290) Google Scholar) to be constant (38 ± 3 mm/pH units) in the pH range 6–7 (not shown). The H+ leak rate, dH+/dt leak, was measured from the pH change (Fig. 3 c, solid line) after an identical 20 mm sodium acetate prepulse with the H+ pump inhibited by bafilomycin A1. Similar prepulse measurements were done at different Golgi pH by varying sodium acetate and NH4Cl concentrations. There should be little effect of acetate or NH4+ on H+ transport in the prepulse method because these ions have left the cell by the time of the H+ transport measurements (18Roos A. Boron W.F. Physiol. Rev. 1981; 61: 296-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (2290) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 d shows that the computed H+ pump rate increases sharply with Golgi pH and that the pump rate is not 0 at the Golgi steady-state pH of ∼6.25. Although it is recognized that the prepulse method used to alter Golgi pH also alters cytoplasmic pH, it has been reported that the H+ pump rate is relatively insensitive to cytoplasmic pH in both mammalian (17Kim J.H. Lingwood C.A. Williams D.B. Furuya W. Manolson M.F. Grinstein S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1387-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and plant (19Davies J.M. Hunt I. Sanders D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8547-8551Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) systems. In the steady state, H+ pump rate must equal H+leak rate. The dependence of the leak rate on Golgi pH was measured from the kinetics of pH change after bafilomycin A1addition as shown in Fig. 3 b. The data for different pH are summarized in Fig. 3 d, showing decreased H+ leak as Golgi pH increases. The intersection of the H+ pump and leak curves predicts correctly the observed steady-state Golgi pH, supporting a balanced pump/leak mechanism for setting Golgi pH. The fluorophore targeting method reported here provides a new strategy for cellular labeling that complements existing methods. Of the current methods, GFP is the easiest to use because it does not require exogenously added reagents or cofactors. However, the available GFP mutants are limited in terms of spectral properties (brightness and excitation and emission wavelengths) and indicator sensitivities. Recently, a method was developed for covalently labeling proteins in living cells with a fluorescein derivative (FLASH) (20Griffin B.A. Adams S.R. Tsien R.Y. Science. 1998; 281: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). Addition of an arseno-fluorescein derivative to the cells leads to covalent attachment of the derivative to a short α-helix containing 4 cysteines added to the protein of interest. An advantage of FLASH over GFP and the current approach is the significantly smaller size of the protein tag; however, FLASH is currently limited to the use of fluorescein as the probe. The addition of labeled macromolecules either requires microinjection (21Swedlow J.R. Sedat J.W. Agard D.A. Cell. 1993; 73: 97-108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) or is limited to compartments that are accessible by endocytosis (22Demaurex N. Furuya W. D'Souza S. Bonifacino J.S. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2044-2051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) or retrograde transport through the secretory pathway (17Kim J.H. Lingwood C.A. Williams D.B. Furuya W. Manolson M.F. Grinstein S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1387-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). GFP, FLASH, and the receptor-mediated targeting methods use genetically encoded targeting sequences to localize fluorophores to virtually any cellular site, provided that the targeted protein is able to fold properly. Although strong sFv expression was found in plasma membranes and various intracellular compartments (Fig. 2, above), preliminary experiments suggest that functional sFv expression is relatively poor in reducing environments (data not shown). If disulfide bond formation is critical to sFv folding, it may be possible to generate sFv mutants lacking disulfide bonds that fold well in reducing environments (23Proba K. Wörn A. Honegger A. Plückthun A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The ability to target fluorophores of varied spectral properties is a distinct advantage of the receptor-mediated targeting approach over GFP. The receptor-mediated targeting method utilizes fluorescent probes with a potentially wide range of excitation and emission wavelengths and other optical properties. The use of multiple probes with well separated excitation and emission spectra allows simultaneous labeling of multiple sites. For measurements of important cellular parameters, small chemical probes sensitive to ions (Ca2+, Na+, K+, H+, Cl−), viscosity, and membrane potential are available. Receptor-mediated targeting of a hapten-fluorescein conjugate was used to label the Golgi with a fluorescent pH indicator permitting the measurement of the dependence of the vacuolar H+/ATPase pump rate on Golgi pH. The pump rate increased and the leak rate decreased as Golgi pH increased. The steep dependence of pump rate on pH is in agreement with measurements of ATPase activity (24Arai K. Shimaya A. Hiratani N. Ohkuma S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5649-5660Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of the vacuolar H+/ATPase made in vitro and of the pump rate made in phagosomes (25Lukacs G.L. Rotstein O.D. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24540-24548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to the predictions of a thermodynamic model of pH regulation in the Golgi, the net pump rate was not 0 at the resting Golgi pH. Thus, the resting pH is determined by the kinetics of proton leak versus pump. Shifts in the leak or pump curves could account for the differences in resting pH in organelles of the secretory pathway. In summary, the receptor-mediated probe targeting strategy allows the labeling of specified cellular structures with fluorescent or other indicator molecules. This targeting method can readily be extended to deliver conjugates containing magnetic resonance probes, caged compounds, or chemical cross-linkers. Finally, the use of cell-specific promoters and gene transfer should allow the in vivotargeting of hapten-probe complexes to specific cell types in multicellular organisms. We thank Dr. J. Biwersi for help with organic synthesis and Drs. T. Ma and Y. Li for help in vector construction."

Furthermore, a substantial fraction of the cells exhibited odor-specific firing patterns prior to odor presentation, when the animal arrived at a location associated with that odor. These findings suggest that neurons in the OF encode cross-modal associations between odors and locations within long-term memory."

For example, both neurogranin and neuromodulin have been shown to regulate CaM-dependent nitric oxide synthase activity through sequestration of CaM (24Martzen M.R. Slemmon J.R. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 92-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 25Slemmon J.R. Martzen M.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5653-5660Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Conversely, nitric oxide modifies neurogranin, reducing its ability to bind CaM or to be phosphorylated by PKC (26Sheu F.-S. Mahoney C.W. Seki K. Huang K.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22407-22413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Neurogranin and neuromodulin are also in vitrosubstrates for phosphorylase kinase and may interact with membrane phospholipids (27Paudel H.K. Zwiers H. Wang J.H. J. Biol.

It has also been hypothesized that neuromodulin and neurogranin may play pivotal roles in LTP by releasing CaM. Free CaM could then activate enzymes, including CaM kinases or adenylyl cyclases, that regulate synaptic plasticity (30Roberson E.D. Sweatt J.D. Behav.

However, it has not been demonstrated that neurogranin binds CaM in vivo, and the possibility that neurogranin may interact with other proteins has not been investigated. Here, we utilized yeast two-hybrid technology to detect neurogranin-binding proteins and to characterize neurogranin/CaM interactions in vivo.DISCUSSIONNeurogranin and the related IQ domain protein, neuromodulin, are hypothesized to regulate neuronal CaM levels in response to PKC phosphorylation and increases in intracellular Ca2+ (3Repressa A. Deloulme J.C. Sensenbrenner M. Ben-Ari Y. Baudier J. J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 3782-3792Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Alexander K.A. Cimler B.M. Meier K.E. Storm D.R. J. Biol.

Therefore, it has been important to determine whether these proteins bind CaM and are phosphorylated by PKC in vivo. Both neurogranin and neuromodulin are phosphorylated by PKC in vivo (8Baudier J.

The objectives of this study were to determine if neurogranin binds CaM in vivo through its IQ domain and to determine if other neurogranin-binding proteins can be detected by yeast two-hybrid technology. The discovery of other neurogranin-binding proteins would provide mechanistic insights concerning the role of neurogranin in signal transduction and would suggest alternative biochemical mechanisms for neurogranin in neurons.Our data indicate that neurogranin and CaM are also in vivobinding partners and that the interaction occurs primarily through the IQ domain of neurogranin. The Ile-33 → Gln mutation completely inhibited the CaM/neurogranin interaction, illustrating the importance of hydrophobic interactions for CaM binding to neurogranin. Reduced binding of CaM to the Ser-36 → Asp mutant of neurogranin is consistent with the hypothesis that introduction of negative charge at Ser-36 by PKC phosphorylation lowers CaM binding affinity.CaM was the only neurogranin-interacting protein isolated from the rat and mouse brain two-hybrid screens. In addition, neurogranin-binding proteins were not detected using neurogranin mutant proteins that do not bind CaM. It is interesting that other two-hybrid screens performed on IQ domain proteins have yielded similar results. After extensive testing, CaM was the only protein found to interact with neuromodulin (45Chao S. Benowitz L.I. Krainc D. Irwin N. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 40: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and it was also the only protein isolated using Igloo, a Drosophila neuromodulin homologue, as bait (47Neel V.A. Young M.W. Development. 1994; 120: 2235-2243PubMed Google Scholar). In a screen of IQGAP1, a human putative Ras GTPase-activating protein that contains four IQ domains, CaM was the most frequent interacting protein identified (48Brill S. Li S. Lyman C.W. Church D.M. Wasmuth J.J. Weissbach L. Bernards A. Snijders A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4869-4878Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Yeast two-hybrid screens do not necessarily detect all significant interactions. For example, although neurogranin and neuromodulin are PKC substrates, yeast two-hybrid screens did not identify PKC as an interacting protein with either neuromodulin or neurogranin. Nevertheless, our data indicate that CaM is the only neurogranin-binding protein detectable by an extensive yeast two-hybrid screen; no other neurogranin-interacting proteins other than PKC have been identified in vitro or in vivo.If neuromodulin and neurogranin regulate free CaM levels, these proteins should regulate the activity of CaM-stimulated enzymes. In support of this hypothesis, both neurogranin and neuromodulin have been shown to regulate the activity of CaM-dependent enzymes (24Martzen M.R. Slemmon J.R. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 92-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 25Slemmon J.R. Martzen M.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5653-5660Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Addition of neurogranin or neuromodulin to Ca2+/CaM-activated nitric oxide synthase reduces NO synthase activity. This inhibition is not seen when neurogranin or neuromodulin are phosphorylated, or at high Ca2+concentrations, indicating that sequestration of CaM by neurogranin or neuromodulin regulates the activity of CaM-stimulated enzymes. Our results show that neurogranin may also regulate calmodulin-stimulated targets in vivo. When co-expressed with neurogranin, the calcium/calmodulin-stimulated activities of adenylyl cyclases AC1 and AC8 were inhibited. As both AC1 and AC8 are expressed in brain, they may represent physiological targets for neurogranin.The existence of presynaptic and postsynaptic CaM-binding proteins that may regulate free CaM in neurons has led to the interesting hypothesis that these proteins may play a pivotal role during synaptic plasticity,e.g. long term potentiation (LTP) (30Roberson E.D.

For example, neurogranin and neuromodulin are both phosphorylated by PKC during LTP (49Ramakers G.M.J. De Graan P.N.E. Urban I.J.A. Kraay D. Tang T. Pasinelli P. Oestreicher A.B. Gispen W.H. J. Biol.

There are several forms of mechanistically distinct LTP expressed in the hippocampus and other areas of brain, including forms that are predominantly presynaptic and others that are hypothesized to be postsynaptic (54Nicoll R.A. Malenka R.C. Nature. 1995; 377: 115-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). In either case, initial increases in intracellular Ca2+ arising because of activation of voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels or glutamate receptors are thought to initiate signal transduction cascades leading to enhanced synaptic efficacy (55Malenka R.C. Kauer J.A. Zucker R.S. Nicoll R.A. Science. 1988; 242: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar, 56Kauer J.A. Malenka R.C. Nicoll R.A.

CaM-stimulated enzymes including CaM kinases, NO synthase (58Son H. Hawkins R.D. Martin K. Kiebler M. Huang P.L. Fishman M.C. Kandel E.R.

Neurosci. 1998; 18: 3186-3194Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) are thought to play major roles in the initiation, maintenance, and propagation of LTP. Consequently, neuromodulin and neurogranin may be critical components of the molecular machinery used for modulation of synaptic plasticity and the development of learning and memory in vertebrates. Our demonstration that neurogranin can regulate brain adenylyl cyclases through its interactions with calmodulin is consistent with this theory. Neurogranin (RC3, BICKS) is a postnatal expressed brain-specific protein that is localized postsynaptically in neuronal cell bodies and dendrites of the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and striatum (1Gerendasy D.D.

PKC phosphorylation within the IQ domain inhibits CaM binding, and conversely, CaM binding inhibits PKC phosphorylation at the serine within the IQ domain (21Gerendasy D.D. Herron S.R. Jennings P.A.

Consequently, neuromodulin and neurogranin may be critical components of the molecular machinery used for modulation of synaptic plasticity and the development of learning and memory in vertebrates. Our demonstration that neurogranin can regulate brain adenylyl cyclases through its interactions with calmodulin is consistent with this theory. Neurogranin and the related IQ domain protein, neuromodulin, are hypothesized to regulate neuronal CaM levels in response to PKC phosphorylation and increases in intracellular Ca2+ (3Repressa A. Deloulme J.C. Sensenbrenner M. Ben-Ari Y. Baudier J. J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 3782-3792Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Alexander K.A. Cimler B.M. Meier K.E. Storm D.R. J. Biol.

Therefore, it has been important to determine whether these proteins bind CaM and are phosphorylated by PKC in vivo. Both neurogranin and neuromodulin are phosphorylated by PKC in vivo (8Baudier J. Deloulme J.C. Van Dorsselaer A. Black D. Matthes H.W.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 229-237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Chapman E.R. Estep R.P. Storm D.R. J. Biol.

Neural Biol. 1985; 43: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), and recently it was shown that neuromodulin binds CaM in vivo (45Chao S. Benowitz L.I. Krainc D. Irwin N. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 40: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 46Gamby C. Waage M.C. Allen R.G. Baizer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26698-26705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The objectives of this study were to determine if neurogranin binds CaM in vivo through its IQ domain and to determine if other neurogranin-binding proteins can be detected by yeast two-hybrid technology. The discovery of other neurogranin-binding proteins would provide mechanistic insights concerning the role of neurogranin in signal transduction and would suggest alternative biochemical mechanisms for neurogranin in neurons. Our data indicate that neurogranin and CaM are also in vivobinding partners and that the interaction occurs primarily through the IQ domain of neurogranin. The Ile-33 → Gln mutation completely inhibited the CaM/neurogranin interaction, illustrating the importance of hydrophobic interactions for CaM binding to neurogranin. Reduced binding of CaM to the Ser-36 → Asp mutant of neurogranin is consistent with the hypothesis that introduction of negative charge at Ser-36 by PKC phosphorylation lowers CaM binding affinity. CaM was the only neurogranin-interacting protein isolated from the rat and mouse brain two-hybrid screens. In addition, neurogranin-binding proteins were not detected using neurogranin mutant proteins that do not bind CaM. It is interesting that other two-hybrid screens performed on IQ domain proteins have yielded similar results. After extensive testing, CaM was the only protein found to interact with neuromodulin (45Chao S. Benowitz L.I. Krainc D. Irwin N. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 40: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and it was also the only protein isolated using Igloo, a Drosophila neuromodulin homologue, as bait (47Neel V.A. Young M.W. Development. 1994; 120: 2235-2243PubMed Google Scholar). In a screen of IQGAP1, a human putative Ras GTPase-activating protein that contains four IQ domains, CaM was the most frequent interacting protein identified (48Brill S. Li S. Lyman C.W. Church D.M. Wasmuth J.J. Weissbach L. Bernards A. Snijders A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4869-4878Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Yeast two-hybrid screens do not necessarily detect all significant interactions. For example, although neurogranin and neuromodulin are PKC substrates, yeast two-hybrid screens did not identify PKC as an interacting protein with either neuromodulin or neurogranin. Nevertheless, our data indicate that CaM is the only neurogranin-binding protein detectable by an extensive yeast two-hybrid screen; no other neurogranin-interacting proteins other than PKC have been identified in vitro or in vivo. If neuromodulin and neurogranin regulate free CaM levels, these proteins should regulate the activity of CaM-stimulated enzymes. In support of this hypothesis, both neurogranin and neuromodulin have been shown to regulate the activity of CaM-dependent enzymes (24Martzen M.R. Slemmon J.R. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 92-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 25Slemmon J.R. Martzen M.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5653-5660Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Addition of neurogranin or neuromodulin to Ca2+/CaM-activated nitric oxide synthase reduces NO synthase activity. This inhibition is not seen when neurogranin or neuromodulin are phosphorylated, or at high Ca2+concentrations, indicating that sequestration of CaM by neurogranin or neuromodulin regulates the activity of CaM-stimulated enzymes. Our results show that neurogranin may also regulate calmodulin-stimulated targets in vivo. When co-expressed with neurogranin, the calcium/calmodulin-stimulated activities of adenylyl cyclases AC1 and AC8 were inhibited. As both AC1 and AC8 are expressed in brain, they may represent physiological targets for neurogranin. The existence of presynaptic and postsynaptic CaM-binding proteins that may regulate free CaM in neurons has led to the interesting hypothesis that these proteins may play a pivotal role during synaptic plasticity,e.g. long term potentiation (LTP) (30Roberson E.D.

https://openalex.org/W2074022264,"Activity-dependent competition is thought to guide the normal development of specific patterns of neural connections. Such competition generally favors more active inputs, making them larger and stronger, while less active inputs become smaller and weaker. We pharmacologically inhibited the activity of visual cortical cells and measured the three-dimensional structure of inputs serving the two eyes when one eye was occluded. The more active inputs serving the open eye actually became smaller than the deprived inputs from the occluded eye, which were similar to those in normal animals. These findings demonstrate in vivo that it is not the amount of afferent activity but the correlation between cortical and afferent activity that regulates the growth or retraction of these inputs."

Nairn A.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 513-518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The actual pore of the chloride channel is presumably formed by portions of the two membrane spanning domains of CFTR, each consisting of six transmembrane segments (13Cheung M. Akabas M.H. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 289-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), with an ohmic conductance of ∼8 pS in 200 mm KCl solution (14Xie J. Drumm M.L. Ma J. Davis P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28084-28096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 15Ma J. Tasch J. Tao T. Zhao J. Xie J. Drumm M.L. Davis P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 271: 7351-7356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (42) Google Scholar). An early study by Richet al. (16Rich D.P. Gregory R.J. Anderson M.P. Manavalan P. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. Science. 1991; 253: 205-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) showed that deletion of amino acids 708–835 from the R domain (ΔR) renders the CFTR channel PKA independent. The open probability of ΔR-CFTR is approximately one-third that of the wt channel and does not increase upon PKA phosphorylation (17Ma J. Zhao J. Drumm M.L. Xie J. Davis P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 273: 28133-28141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 18Winter M.C. Welsh M.J. Nature. 1997; 398: 294-296Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Based on these different gating properties of the wt and ΔR channels, we set out to test the intermolecular interactions of CFTR by constructing tandem cDNAs between the wt-CFTR and the ΔR-CFTR. Our rationale is as follows. If a monomer of CFTR is sufficient to form an 8-pS chloride channel, the dimeric CFTR molecules would form either a 16-pS chloride channel or two 8-pS chloride channels that may gate independently or together. On the other hand, if two CFTR molecules are required to function as a chloride channel, we expected the tandem construct to form a single 8-pS chloride channel, provided that the linker sequence does not affect the CFTR channel function. Furthermore, we predicted that the wt-ΔR (or ΔR-wt) channel should exhibit mixed properties of the wt and ΔR channels. The wild type and ΔR (708–835) CFTR cDNAs were cloned into theNheI/XhoI sites of the pCEP4 expression vector (14Xie J. Drumm M.L. Ma J. Davis P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28084-28096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 17Ma J. Zhao J. Drumm M.L. Xie J. Davis P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 273: 28133-28141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The tandem constructs, wt-wt, wt-ΔR, ΔR-wt, and ΔR-ΔR, were generated in three steps. First, site-directed mutageneses were used to remove the stop codon and to introduce aBssHII restriction site at the 3′ end of the CFTR cDNA, to create C-BssH. Second, similar approach was taken to remove the Kozak sequence and to introduce a BssHII site at the 5′ end of the CFTR cDNA, to yield N-BssH. Third, the entire CFTR cDNA from N-BssH was released from the pCEP4 vector through digestion with BssHII and XhoI and ligated into the BssHII/XhoI sites of the C-BssH, to create the wt-wt dimer. This represents a direct head-to-tail linkage of two CFTR cDNAs. A double stranded oligonucleotide containing the recognition sequence for thrombin (underlined), Arg-Ala-Ala-Ser-Leu-Val-Pro-Arg-Gly-Ser-Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly,was ligated to the BssHII site of wt-wt, to yield the wt-e-wt construct. The human embryonic kidney (HEK 293) cells were used for expression of CFTR proteins. The different CFTR cDNAs were introduced into the HEK 293 cells using the LipofectAMINE reagent. Two days after transfection, the cells were used for Western blot assay, SPQ measurement, or isolation of membrane vesicles followed by reconstitution studies in the lipid bilayer membranes, as described previously (14Xie J. Drumm M.L. Ma J. Davis P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28084-28096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 15Ma J. Tasch J. Tao T. Zhao J. Xie J. Drumm M.L. Davis P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 271: 7351-7356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The CFTR-mediated chloride transport was measured by SPQ assay with HEK 293 cells expressing the wt, ΔR, wt-wt, ΔR-ΔR, and wt-ΔR CFTR proteins, following the procedure described previously (14Xie J. Drumm M.L. Ma J. Davis P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28084-28096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Basically, the cells were loaded with SPQ dye (Molecular Probes) using hypotonic shock, and chloride flux across the plasma membrane was measured upon stimulation with 10 μm forskolin. The procedure for single channel measurements of CFTR using the lipid bilayer reconstitution technique has been described elsewhere (17Ma J. Zhao J. Drumm M.L. Xie J. Davis P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 273: 28133-28141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Briefly, microsomal membrane vesicles were isolated from HEK 293 cells transiently expressing either the wt-, ΔR-, wt-wt, wt-ΔR, ΔR-wt, or ΔR-ΔR proteins and added to the cis (intracellular) solution containing 200 mm KCl, 2 mm Mg-ATP, 10 mm HEPES-Tris (pH 7.4). The trans solution contained 50 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES-Tris (pH 7.4). To study the PKA-dependent regulation of the CFTR channel, 100 units/ml of the catalytic subunit of PKA was added to thecis solution. Single channel currents were recorded using an Axopatch 200A patch clamp unit (Axon Instruments). Data acquisition and pulse generation were performed with a 486 Computer and a 1200 Digidata A/D-D/A converter. The currents were sampled at 1–2.5 ms/point and filtered at 100 Hz. Single channel analysis were performed with the pClamp7 software. Fig. 1 A shows a Western blot of CFTR expressed in HEK 293 cells. Both fully glycosylated (∼170 kDa) and core glycosylated (∼140 kDa) proteins can be detected in cells transfected with the wt-CFTR cDNA (lane 1). The corresponding bands for the ΔR-CFTR run at apparent molecular masses of ∼150 and ∼120 kDa (lane 2), reflecting the deletion of 128 amino acids from the R domain (amino acids 708–835). The wt-wt protein has molecular masses of ∼340 and ∼280 kDa (lane 4), as expected for a dimer of the wt-CFTR. Similarly, the wt-ΔR (lane 5), ΔR-wt (lane 6), and ΔR-ΔR (lane 7) proteins can all be expressed in HEK 293 cells, with the expected size as dimers. To be able to manipulate the oligomerization state of the CFTR proteins, we engineered an enzymatic digestion site for thrombin in the linker sequence of the wt-wt dimer. This construct is named wt-e-wt (Fig.1 A, lane 10). Digestion of wt-e-wt with thrombin resulted in reduction of the apparent size from dimer to monomers (lane 9), whereas thrombin had no effect on the wt monomer (lane 8) or the wt-wt dimer (lane 11). SPQ assays indicate that the wt-wt dimer, similar to the wt monomer, supports chloride transport in HEK 293 cells upon stimulation with forskolin (Fig. 1 B). Those cells expressing the ΔR and ΔR-ΔR proteins exhibit basal chloride transport activities without stimulation with forskolin, which is consistent with the studies of Rich et al. (16Rich D.P. Gregory R.J. Anderson M.P. Manavalan P. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. Science. 1991; 253: 205-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the cells expressing wt-ΔR have basal chloride transport activity in the absence of forskolin, which became significantly higher upon stimulation by forskolin (relative changes in fluorescence per minute, 0.095 ± 0.010, −forskolin; 0.203 ± 0.007, +forskolin, n= 65). These results indicate that CFTR dimers can traffic properly to the plasma membrane of HEK 293 cells. To study the single channel functions of the CFTR dimers, microsomal membrane vesicles containing the wt-wt or ΔR-ΔR proteins are incorporated into the lipid bilayer membrane. Fig.2 A shows representative current traces from the wt, wt-wt, ΔR, and ΔR-ΔR channels, and their corresponding current-voltage relationships are plotted in Fig.2 B. As can be seen, all four constructs give rise to chloride channels with unitary conductances of ∼8 pS. In 9 out of 13 experiments with wt-wt, and 8 out of 12 experiments with ΔR-ΔR, we only observed openings of a single channel (not two channels) in the bilayer membrane. Similar to the wt channel, opening of the wt-wt channel absolutely requires the presence of both ATP and PKA in the cytosolic solution; and similar to ΔR, opening of the ΔR-ΔR channel is independent of PKA phosphorylation. Interestingly, the activity of the wt-wt channel appears to be significantly lower than that of the wt channel (Fig. 2 C). Studies from other laboratories have shown that the amino- and carboxyl-terminal tails of CFTR contribute to the overall function of the CFTR channel (19Loo M.A. et al.Pediatr. Pulmonol. Suppl. 1997; 14: 212Google Scholar, 20Naren A.P. et al.Pediatr. Pulmonol. Suppl. 1998; 17: 94Google Scholar). We speculate that the head-to-tail connection in the dimeric construct probably constrains the movement of the amino- and carboxyl-terminal portions of CFTR, reducing activity of the wt-wt channel (see also Fig.4).Figure 4Effect of thrombin on the wt-e-wt CFTR channel. A, selected current traces at −100 mV from a single wt-e-wt channel in the presence of 2 mm ATP and 100 units/ml of PKA (control), and 3 min after the addition of 10 units of thrombin to the intracellular solution (+thrombin). Treatment of the wt-e-wt channel with thrombin resulted in significant increase of P o from 0.186 ± 0.045 (n = 11, control) to 0.456 ± 0.064 (n = 7, +thrombin), without affecting the distribution of single channel conductance states, i.e. the number of channels in the bilayer remained unchanged. B, time-dependent effect of thrombin on the wt-e-wt channel. Following stable incorporation of a single wt-e-wt channel in the bilayer membrane, 10 units of thrombin was first added to the cis solution. The second addition of thrombin was 40 units.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Thus, it appears that the dimeric constructs of CFTR form functional chloride channels with conduction properties that are indistinguishable from the monomers of CFTR, i.e. all of them have single channel conductance of ∼8 pS. The dimeric constructs could in principle have two separate pores with conductance of 8 pS for chloride ions, and because of some physical constraint due to the linker sequence, opening of one pore could prevent opening of the other pore, which would result in the overall appearance of a single CFTR channel. The other possibility is that the 8-pS channel normally recorded in single channel measurements (2Bear C.E. Li C. Kartner N. Bridges R.J. Jensen T.J. Ramjeesingh M. Riordan J.R. Cell. 1992; 68: 809-818Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar, 4Tabcharani J.A. Rommens J.M. Hou Y.X. Chang X.B. Tsui L.C. Riordan J.R. Hanrahan J.W.

Data from the following sets of experiments support the latter hypothesis. The heterodimers of CFTR, wt-ΔR and ΔR-wt, also form functional chloride channels with unitary conductance of 8 pS, which display mixed gating properties of the wt and ΔR channels (Fig.3). First, opening of the wt-ΔR and ΔR-wt channels exhibit bursting kinetics, but unlike either the wt or ΔR channels, these bursting patterns are interrupted by fast closing transitions (compare traces of Fig. 3, A and B,with Fig. 2 A). The wt channel has an average open lifetime of τo = 96.0 ± 9.3 ms, and the ΔR channel has a τo = 54.2 ± 6.5 ms (17Ma J. Zhao J. Drumm M.L. Xie J. Davis P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 273: 28133-28141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (69) Google Scholar), whereas the wt-ΔR channel has a τo = 24.4 ± 5.8 ms (n= 9), and the ΔR-wt channel has a τo = 32.4 ± 3.4 ms (n = 7). Second, open probability of the wt-ΔR and ΔR-wt channels display a clear PKA dependence (Fig. 3 C). The channels exhibit constitutive activity in the absence of PKA, which becomes significantly higher upon PKA phosphorylation (Fig.2 C). In contrast, open probabilities of the ΔR and ΔR-ΔR channels are completely independent of PKA phosphorylation (Fig. 3 D). Fig. 4 shows the effect of thrombin on the wt-e-wt channel. Compared with the wt-wt and wt-ΔR constructs, the wt-e-wt dimer contains 14 extra amino acids in the linker sequence corresponding to the thrombin cleavage site (underlined) (R-A-A-S-L-V-P-R-G-S-G-G-G-G). As shown in Fig.4 A, the wt-e-wt channel opens predominantly to a single 8-pS conductance state, with an average P o of 0.186 ± 0.045 (n = 11) at −100 mV. 3–5 min following the addition of 10 units/ml of thrombin to the cytosolic solution, the activity of the wt-e-wt channel increases approximately 4-fold, but the apparent number of channels in the bilayer membrane remains unchanged. During the course of the experiment, simultaneous opening of two channels were never observed, even though open probability of the thrombin-treated wt-e-wt channel was as high asp = 0.723 (Fig. 4 B). Thrombin would separate the halves of the CFTR dimer and presumably remove constraints on the movement of the amino- and carboxyl-terminal tails of CFTR. If such constraints limit channel openings, this may explain why the wt-wt channel has a lower open probability than the wt channel (Fig.2 C). Taken together, we have shown that the dimeric constructs of CFTR can be expressed in the plasma membrane of HEK 293 cells, and these CFTR dimers form functional chloride channels with unitary conductance of 8 pS, similar to the native CFTR channel (2Bear C.E. Li C. Kartner N. Bridges R.J. Jensen T.J. Ramjeesingh M. Riordan J.R. Cell. 1992; 68: 809-818Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar, 4Tabcharani J.A. Rommens J.M. Hou Y.X. Chang X.B. Tsui L.C. Riordan J.R. Hanrahan J.W. Nature. 1993; 366: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The gating properties of the wt-wt and ΔR-ΔR channels are similar to the wt and ΔR channels, whereas the wt-ΔR and ΔR-wt channels exhibit mixed properties of the wt and ΔR channels. The fact that both wt-ΔR and ΔR-wt channels exhibit similar PKA dependence and similar gating kinetics (Fig. 3, A and B) suggests that both halves of the CFTR dimer are properly expressed and inserted in the membrane of HEK 293 cells. The tandem linkage of CFTR apparently reduces the overall activity of the chloride channel due to physical constraints introduced at the junction of the two CFTR molecules, but does not affect the conduction property of the chloride channel, since cleavage of wt-e-wt with thrombin did not change the conductance state of the channel. Our data suggest that two CFTR molecules are required for the chloride channel to open to the 8-pS conductance state. Marshall et al. (21Marshall J. Fang S. Ostedgaard L.S. O'Riordan C.R. Ferrara D.

It may be that the intermolecular interactions between the CFTR molecules are weak and do not survive strong detergent solubilization (i.e. SDS) or that the CFTR dimers only represent a small percentage of the total CFTR proteins that could not be detected by the co-immunoprecipitation procedure. A recent study by Eskandari et al. (22Eskandari S. Wright E.M. Kreman M. Starace D.M. Zampighi G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11235-11240Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) established structural evidence for a dimeric complex with the CFTR proteins. These investigators used freeze fracture electron microscopy to investigate the oligomeric assembly of membrane proteins expressed in Xenopus oocytes, and they concluded that the intramembrane structure of CFTR was consistent with a dimeric assembly of 12-transmembrane helix of the CFTR monomers. Besides being of fundamental importance in understanding the mechanism by which the CFTR channel works, the concept that CFTR functions as a dimer may have implication for persons who are compound heterozygotes for CFTR mutations. Some mutant pairs may be able to complement each other thereby increasing the overall CFTR function, but other mutant pairs may not. This may explain some of the phenotypic variations in patients with CFTR mutations, especially those with some residual function. It will be important to know at what stage in the biosynthetic pathway of CFTR the dimers are formed, i.e.before leaving the endoplasmic reticulum or after trafficking to the apical membrane. More specifically, which portions of the CFTR molecule are involved in the contact interaction or constitute the binding site(s) for accessory proteins that could interact with CFTR? We thank Drs. M. L. Drumm, J. W. Hanrahan, and D. C. Gadsby for helpful discussions."

The triple-helix conformation consists of three extended polyproline II-like chains supercoiled around each other as determined by x-ray fiber diffraction, crystallography, and NMR (3Rich A.

The three chains are staggered by one residue with respect to each other and stabilized by interchain hydrogen bonding (5Bella J. Eaton M. Brodsky B. Berman H.M.

This conformation requires that every third residue must be a glycine, generating a repeating (Gly-Xaa-Yaa)n pattern, and that a high proportion of residues are the imino acids proline and hydroxyproline. Gly-Pro-Hyp is indeed the most common and stabilizing tripeptide found in collagens. 1Standard three-letter nomenclature is used to describe peptide sequences with Hyp representing 4-hydroxyproline. In the standard one-letter code for amino acids, O is used to represent 4-hydroxyproline. Host-guest peptides are named by the sequence of their guest triplet. The folding of the collagen triple helix in vivo is a multistep process involving chain association, registration, nucleation, and propagation (10Engel J. Prockop D.J. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1991; 20: 137-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 11McLaughlin S.H. Bulleid N.J. Matrix Biol. 1997; 16: 369-377Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 12Bulleid N.J. Cell. Dev.

Fibril-forming collagens are synthesized at the rough endoplasmic reticulum membrane in a precursor form, procollagen, containing both N- and C-terminal propeptides terminating the long central triple helix. Proper chain selection and registration is initiated by the association of the C-propeptide domains into trimers followed by nucleation of the correctly aligned triple helix (15Lees J.F. Tasab M. Bulleid N.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 908-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 16Bulleid N.J. Dalley J.A. Lees J.F.

Biochem. 1980; 106: 619-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In the unfolded state, most proline residues in the Yaa position of Gly-Xaa-Yaa triplets are enzymatically hydroxylated, and the resulting hydroxyproline (Hyp) residues are required for the formation and stabilization of the triple helix (18Sakakibara S.

Folding studies on mature collagens are complicated by their length and varied sequences; these complicating features can be reduced by the use of natural or synthetic peptides. Collagen fragments have been used to better define the folding process, e.g. the observation of third-order kinetics for a 36-residue cyanogen bromide fragment of collagen type I (19Piez K.A. Sherman M.S. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 4134-4140Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Synthetic peptide models of the triple helix allow the sequence dependence of folding to be investigated systematically by varying both the design and the composition of the Gly-Xaa-Yaa sequences. Investigations on synthetic model peptides, such as (Pro-Pro-Gly)n, which adopt a stable triple-helical structure, have allowed quantitation of third-order rate constants, the effect of length and the testing of sophisticated theoretical models including folding intermediates resulting from incorrectly staggered chains (20Sutoh K. Noda H. Biopolymers. 1974; 13: 2477-2488Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar,21Weidner H. Biopolymers. 1975; 14: 763-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Here we present data on the refolding of a set of homologous peptides that contain one variable Gly-Xaa-Yaa guest triplet embedded in a Gly-Pro-Hyp-rich host sequence. This design allows the analysis of the effect of a single triplet sequence on different triple-helix properties.

This study reports folding rates for a set of host-guest peptides that provide information on the relative propensities of different tripeptide sequences to promote nucleation of the triple helix. Peptides were synthesized on an Applied BioSystems 430A synthesizer using the standard FastMoc (Applied BioSystems) method on a N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl (Fmoc)-RINK resin as described previously (22, 23). Peptides were purified to >90% purity by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography on a C-18 column eluted with a binary 10–30% (v/v) acetonitrile/water gradient containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Peptide identity was confirmed by laser desorption mass spectrometry and amino acid analysis. Peptides were placed in vacuoover P2O5 for more than 48 h before weighing, dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (10 mmsodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.0), and stored at 4 °C. Measurements were performed on an AVIV Model 62DS CD2spectrophotometer equipped with a thermoelectric temperature control in 1-mm-path length quartz cells. Peptides were denatured in glass test tubes at 70 °C for 20 min and then rapidly cooled to 15 °C, unless otherwise specified, by quenching in an ice-water bath before transfer into the cuvette, kept at 15 °C. Quenching time was ∼5 s, and the time needed for sample transfer was ∼15 s. The ellipticity at 225 nm was monitored as a function of time over at least 30 min and until the fraction of folded peptides exceeded 0.5 (see below), with data intervals and averaging times of 1 to 60 s, depending on concentration and folding speed. Experiments repeated for some peptides indicated a deviation between their half-times of less than 10%. The fraction of folded peptide (F) is defined as F=(θobs−θm)/(θt−θm)Equation 1 where θobs, θt, and θmrepresent the observed, the triple helix, and monomer ellipticity, respectively. θt was measured directly before denaturation at the temperature used for refolding. θm was determined by extrapolating the initial data points to time zero. This θmvalue was slightly lower than that resulting from linear extrapolation of the monomer ellipticity observed in the high temperature region of equilibrium melting curves, but the use of either value gave similar results. To compare the data of different peptides independent of the folding mechanism, the time (t 12) at which F = 0.5 was determined. The concentration of monomer [A] at any given time was calculated as [A]=(1−F)[A0]Equation 2 with [A]0 denoting the initial monomeric peptide concentration, which was assumed to be equal to the total peptide concentration. Data were fitted to a single-step first (Eq. 3)-, second (Eq. 4)-, or third (Eq. 5)-order kinetics: ln[A]=ln[A0]−k1tEquation 3 1/[A]=1/[A0]+2k2tEquation 4 1/[A]2=1/[A0]2+6k3tEquation 5 Rate constants k i were calculated after linearization from the slope resulting from linear least squares fit. Curves were categorized as of ith order based on maximum linear correlation coefficients. Host-guest peptides of the form acetyl-(Gly-Pro-Hyp)3-Gly-Xaa-Yaa-(Gly-Pro-Hyp)4-Gly-Gly-amide provide a useful template to evaluate the contribution of individual Gly-Xaa-Yaa triplets to triple-helix properties (22Shah N.K.

To assure formation of a stable triple-helix, the guest triplet is flanked by stabilizing Gly-Pro-Hyp triplets. The N and C termini are blocked by acetylation and amidation, respectively, to ensure that the only ionizable groups, if any, would be those introduced in the guest triplet and to eliminate charge repulsion at the ends of the triple helix. The peptide length is designed to be short enough so that the effects of a single guest triplet would not be masked by the constant part of the structure but long enough to ensure triple-helix stability (22Shah N.K. Ramshaw J.A.M. Kirkpatrick A. Shah C. Brodsky B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10262-10268Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Because imino acids are found at high frequency in triple helices, guest triplets of the form Gly-Xaa-Hyp, Gly-Pro-Yaa, and Gly-Xaa-Yaa were considered, with the Xaa and Yaa residues occupied by the most common nonpolar residues, and charged residues found in collagens. In the following, we refer to the different peptides by their guest triplet sequence. This design allows analysis of the effects on folding of a single residue within a defined triple-helical environment. CD measurements of all host-guest peptides indicate triple-helical structures at low temperature. The spectra show a characteristic maximum near 225 nm with a mean residue ellipticity in the order of 4,000 deg cm2 dmol−1, which decreases upon unfolding (Fig. 1, inset). Equilibrium unfolding curves exhibit a highly cooperative behavior with melting temperatures ranging from 20 to 45 °C, depending on the identity of the guest triplet (22Shah N.K. Ramshaw J.A.M. Kirkpatrick A. Shah C. Brodsky B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10262-10268Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 23Chan V.C. Ramshaw J.A.M. Kirkpatrick A. Beck K. Brodsky B. J. Biol.

Biol. 1998; 122: 86-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The curves can be fitted to a two-state trimer to monomer transition, an assumption supported by analytical ultracentrifugation experiments performed on closely related peptides (26Long C.G. Braswell E. Zhu D. Apigo J. Baum J. Brodsky B. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11688-11695Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Refolding rates were measured for a total of 21 host-guest peptides (concentration = 1 mg/ml). Despite the variations in stability of the host-guest peptides, a common folding temperature of 15 °C was selected. At this temperature all peptides showed a fraction of folded peptide close to one in their equilibrium melting curves, and little dependence of the folding rate on temperature of folding was observed at 5, 10, 15, and 20 °C (data not shown). As an example, the signal recovery for peptide Gly-Ala-Hyp at 15 °C is shown in Fig. 1, which also illustrates the determination of t 12values as a common measure to compare the refolding behavior of the different peptides. Thet 12 values for the host-guest peptides varied between 6 and 110 min, revealing that the folding rate critically depends on the sequence of the guest triplet (TableI). For example, the folding half-times of peptides Gly-Pro-Hyp, Gly-Ala-Hyp, Gly-Pro-Ala, and Gly-Ala-Ala are 6.0, 8.3, 12, and 21 min, respectively, at 15 °C (Fig.2). The fast folding of Gly-Pro-Hyp is decreased slightly by the substitution of Pro by Ala in the Xaa position and somewhat more when the Hyp is replaced by an Ala.Table ISequence dependence of refoldingGly-Xaa-Hypt 1/2Gly-Pro-Yaat 1/2Gly-Xaa-Yaat 1/2Gly-Pro-Hyp6.0Gly-Pro-Pro11Gly-Ala-Hyp8.3Gly-Pro-Ala12Gly-Ala-Ala21Gly-Leu-Hyp12Gly-Pro-Leu40Gly-Leu-Ala35Gly-Ala-Leu86Gly-Asn-Hyp8.3Gly-Pro-Asn38Gly-Asp-Hyp8.6Gly-Pro-Asp98Gly-Asp-Ala83Gly-Gln-Hyp9.4Gly-Pro-Gln22Gly-Glu-Hyp6.1Gly-Pro-Glu27Gly-Pro-Lys29Gly-Pro-Arg15Gly-Ala-Arg15Refolding of the indicated peptides (concentration = 1 mg/ml) after denaturation at 70 °C for 20 min was monitored at 15 °C, and half-times t 1/2 (in min) were determined. Peptides are sorted in complementary sets. Open table in a new tab Refolding of the indicated peptides (concentration = 1 mg/ml) after denaturation at 70 °C for 20 min was monitored at 15 °C, and half-times t 1/2 (in min) were determined. Peptides are sorted in complementary sets. Guest triplets with Hyp in the Yaa position (Gly-Xaa-Hyp) fold fastest and show only a small dependence on the identity of the residue in the Xaa position. Gly-Pro-Yaa guest triplets with Pro in the Xaa position show a larger range of folding rates and a stronger influence of the identity of the Yaa residue. In the Gly-Pro-Yaa peptides, the residues glutamine and glutamic acid have a very similar influence on the kinetic behavior (t 12 = 22 min for Gln and 27 min for Glu), whereas an exchange of aspartic acid for asparagine drastically slows down the refolding (t 12 = 38 min for Asn and 98 min for Asp). The combination of nonimino acids in both the Xaa and Yaa positions (Gly-Xaa-Yaa) leads to a broad distribution oft 12 values, with peptides Gly-Ala-Leu and Gly-Asp-Ala folding particularly slowly. In general, leucine was observed to decrease the folding rate compared with Ala, with the effect being most striking in the Yaa position. To understand the influence of the single guest triplet on the folding mechanism, the folding data at 1 mg/ml was analyzed by fitting to first-, second-, and third-order kinetics (Equations Equation 3, Equation 4, Equation 5). Considering the full folding process, some peptides showed best fits when assuming a first-order kinetics, whereas others showed best fits when either second- or third-order kinetics were assumed. Analyses of the folding curves of several peptides in which only the late data points were fitted to third-order kinetics (Equation 5) revealed that these regions show a reasonably straight line in 1/[A]02(t) plots (data not shown). This suggests that at a sufficiently low monomer concentration, the third-order step, which relates to chain association and/or nucleation, becomes the rate-limiting step for trimer formation. Folding via a third-order kinetic process should show a profound dependence on concentration, whereas the first-order kinetics of propagation should be independent of concentration. Measurements of the kinetics of folding for a set of 8 peptides at a concentration of 0.4 mg/ml (Fig. 3 A) indicated that at this lower concentration all but the very early time points (t < 10 to 300 s) followed a straight line when plotted as 1/[A]02 (t), giving a good fit to third-order kinetics (Fig. 3 B). This indicates that at a sufficiently low monomer concentration, chain association/nucleation becomes the rate-limiting kinetic step in triple-helix folding. The apparent third-order rate constants derived from the slopes varied from 470 to 16,000 m−2 s−1, with S.D. of approximately ± 10%. The lowest third-order rate constants were found for peptides Gly-Ala-Leu and Gly-Pro-Asp, and the largest was found for Gly-Pro-Hyp (Table II). The Gly-Pro-Pro peptide had a slower folding rate than Gly-Pro-Hyp, showing the effect of a hydroxyl group at one position. The large variation in the rate constants suggests that for these relatively short peptides, the chain association/nucleation step critically depends on the identity of the single guest triplet, and at this low concentration, any other processes like helix propagation have only a marginal contribution.Table IIEffect of sequence on third-order rate constantsPeptidek 3m−2 s−1Gly-Pro-Hyp16,000Gly-Pro-Pro12,000Gly-Ala-Hyp6,000Gly-Pro-Ala4,700Gly-Leu-Ala1,500Gly-Ala-Ala950Gly-Ala-Leu500Gly-Pro-Asp470Refolding of the indicated peptides (concentration = 0.4 mg/ml) after denaturation at 70 °C for 20 min was monitored at 15 °C.

Third-order rate constants k 3 were determined according to Equation 5 as outlined in Fig. 4 B. The folding of collagen molecules in vivo is an intricate and coordinated process (10Engel J. Prockop D.J. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1991; 20: 137-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 12Bulleid N.J. Cell. Dev. Biol. 1996; 7: 667-672Google Scholar, 27Brodsky B. Gierasch L. King J. The Protein Folding Problem. American Association for the Advancement of Science, Washington, D. C.1990: 55-62Google Scholar). The formation of a trimer requires association and registration of three chains, which is mediated for fibril-forming collagens by the globular C-terminal propeptide domain (10Engel J. Prockop D.J. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1991; 20: 137-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 11McLaughlin S.H. Bulleid N.J.

C-propeptide trimerization constrains the three chains at the C terminus such that nucleation can occur at the C terminus of the triple-helical region. Nucleation is considered to be the process in which a series of tripeptide units from the three chains adopt appropriate collagen-like ϕ,ψ angles and form interchain hydrogen bonds. At the C termini of fibril-forming collagens are 5–6 sequential triplets of the form Gly-Xaa-Hyp (often Gly-Pro-Hyp units), which are thought to constitute all or part of the nucleation site. For example, in collagen type III, C-terminal Gly-Xaa-Hyp triplets are required for nucleation, and deletion experiments showed that as long as two Gly-X-Hyp triplets are retained, nucleation is effective, and triple-helix folding is complete (16Bulleid N.J. Dalley J.A. Lees J.F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6694-6701Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Following nucleation, propagation proceeds in a zipper-like manner from the C to N terminus. The rate-limiting step of propagation is cis-transisomerization at imino acid peptide bonds, which have a significant proportion of cis bonds in unfolded chains (17Bächinger H.P. Bruckner P. Timpl R. Prockop D.J. Engel J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 106: 619-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 28Bächinger H.P. Bruckner P. Timpl R. Engel J. Eur. J.

The studies reported here on a set of host-guest peptides demonstrate that the folding rate of the triple helix critically depends on the sequence of a single guest triplet. Analysis of our data indicates that the folding proceeds via a mechanism involving more than a single reaction step and that the folding involves a third-order process that becomes rate-limiting at low concentrations. The steps requiring the involvement of three polypeptide chains are chain association and nucleation. Although the association process, which is limited by diffusion, is unlikely to be significantly affected by sequence, triple-helix nucleation is known to be facilitated by the presence of conformationally restricted imino acids and is thus expected to be sequence-dependent (30Von Hippel P.H. Harrington W.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1959; 36: 427-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4). In the present study, the magnitude of the third-order rate constant is strongly affected by the identity of the guest triplet and is greater for imino acid-containing triplets, suggesting it is the nucleation step itself reflected by these values. NMR studies on peptides with specific 15N labels indicated that nucleation can occur at (Gly-Pro-Hyp)nsites at either end of a peptide (31Liu X. Siegel D.L. Fan P. Brodsky B. Baum J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4306-4313Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). For the Gly-Pro-Hyp-enriched host-guest peptides, it is realistic to assume that nucleation could begin at any tripeptide unit in the chain (32Weidner H. Engel J. Fietzek P.P. Blout E.R. Bovey F.A. Goodman M. Lotan N. Peptides, Polypeptides, and Proteins. Wiley, New York1974: 419-435Google Scholar) (Fig. 4). Previous findings suggest the nucleation domain is as long as six triplets in noncovalently linked peptides (20Sutoh K. Noda H. Biopolymers. 1974; 13: 2477-2488Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 21Weidner H. Biopolymers. 1975; 14: 763-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), making this a dominant event in short peptides. The third-order rate constants and half-times of folding yield information concerning the relative propensity of different residues in the Xaa and Yaa position to initiate triple-helix nucleation. Entropic factors are likely to play an important role in nucleation because imino acids are sterically constrained to dihedral angles similar to those found in collagen. Gly-Pro-Hyp is the fastest folding triplet, and all Gly-Xaa-Hyp triplets are very favorable. The Hyp residue appears more favorable than Pro, as seen in the faster folding rate of Gly-Pro-Hyp versus Gly-Pro-Pro. It has been suggested that the OH of Hyp has an inductive effect, leading to a decrease in thecis:trans isomer ratio compared with Pro in the unfolded state (33Eberhardt E.S. Panasik Jr., N. Raines R.T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 12261-12266Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). A decrease in the cis isomer concentration could accelerate the propagation step. In addition, the decreased cis:trans ratio could promote nucleation by making it more likely to find a stretch of contiguous all-trans tripeptide units and by creating a more rigid monomer chain (34Bansal M. Ananthanarayanan V.S. Biopolymers. 1988; 27: 299-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Although Pro in the Xaa position also can lead to favorable folding, the identity of the nonimino acid residue in the Yaa position of Gly-Pro-Yaa triplets has a very strong influence. For example, Gly-Pro-Ala is a fast folding peptide, whereas Gly-Pro-Asp has the slowest folding rate observed. In addition to entropic factors, the influence of specific side chains in promoting nucleation may relate to steric factors, electrostatic interactions, and hydrogen bonding. The difficulty in packing bulky residues such as Leu in the Yaa position (35Bansal M. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1977; 9: 224-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), which is less exposed than the Xaa position, may contribute to the slow folding of Gly-Pro-Leu and Gly-Ala-Leu peptides. Despite its large side chain, arginine in the Yaa position is favorable in promoting chain nucleation as well as for stabilization (24Yang W. Chan V.C. Kirkpatrick A. Ramshaw J.A.M. Brodsky B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28837-28840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and both features may be related to its ability to form multiple hydrogen bonds combined with its restricted mobility (36Richardson J.S. Richardson D. Fasman G.D. Prediction of Protein Structure and the Principles of Protein Conformation. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1989: 1-98Crossref Google Scholar, 37Vitagliano L. Nemethy G. Zagari A. Scheraga H.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7354-7359Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Gly-Pro-Asp is the slowest folding peptide, suggesting an unfavorable effect of aspartic acid in the Y position. It was previously observed that aspartic acid in the Yaa position had a destabilizing effect on the triple helix. Both the decreased folding rate and low stability may be related to the restricted rotational freedom of Asp in the triple helix, hindering its participation in interchain hydrogen bond formation (23Chan V.C. Ramshaw J.A.M. Kirkpatrick A. Beck K. Brodsky B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31441-31446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The systematic exchange of single guest triplets embedded in an otherwise constant environment allows their influence on folding to be related to their contribution to triple-helix stability. The relationship between folding half-times and the melting temperatures of the host-guest peptide concentrations set at 1 mg/ml was considered (Fig. 5). All Gly-Xaa-Hyp peptides have fast folding rates and high stabilities, with a small range for botht 12 values and melting temperature values. The Gly-Pro-Yaa peptides show a broad range for both folding half-times (12–98 min) and melting temperatures (30–45 °C), with the more stable peptides tending to fold faster. For Gly-Xaa-Yaa triplets with no imino acids, four peptides with similar thermal stabilities were found to have very different folding times. This suggests the interactions determining folding differ from those important for stability for tripeptides with no imino acids. The host-guest peptide set shows the wide range in effectiveness of Gly-Xaa-Yaa tripeptides in a fixed Gly-Pro-Hyp environment to facilitate or depress nucleation. The nucleation step of peptides differs from that of collagen in that this step occurs in three independent peptides, whereas triple-helix nucleation in collagen occurs in a molecule that is linked together by the association of disulfide-linked C-propeptides (Fig. 4). Despite this difference, it is likely that the propensity of individual tripeptides to nucleate a peptide triple helix can be applied to the ability of different sequences at the C terminus of collagen to serve as a nucleation site. In addition, it is possible that interruptions in the (Gly-Xaa-Yaa)n-repeating sequence, as found normally in basement membrane collagen or for osteogenesis imperfecta Gly→Xaa mutations in type I collagen, may terminate propagation (38Bächinger H.P. Morris N.P. Davis J.M. Am. J. Med. Genet. 1993; 45: 152-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 39Liu X. Kim S. Dai Q.-H. Brodsky B. Baum J. Boichemistry. 1998; 37: 15528-15533Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), making a renucleation event necessary to complete triple-helix formation. Information on the propensity of different Gly-Xaa-Yaa triplets to promote nucleation will aid in the identification of such renucleation sequences.

https://openalex.org/W2047244190,"Engrailed is expressed in subsets of interneurons that do not express Connectin or appreciable Neuroglian, whereas other neurons that are Engrailed negative strongly express these adhesion molecules. Connectin and Neuroglian expression are virtually eliminated in interneurons when engrailed expression is driven ubiquitously in neurons, and greatly increased when engrailed genes are lacking in mutant embryos. The data suggest that Engrailed is normally a negative regulator of Connectin and neuroglian. These are the first two “effector” genes identified in the nervous system of Drosophila as regulatory targets for Engrailed. We argue that differential Engrailed expression is crucial in determining the pattern of expression of cell adhesion molecules and thus constitutes an important determinant of neuronal shape and perhaps connectivity."

We found that the monomeric mutant L37A-PLB is a more potent inhibitor than wt-PLB, supporting the previous proposal that PLB monomer is the inhibitory species. On the other hand, C41L-PLB, which has a monomeric fraction comparable to that of wt-PLB on SDS-PAGE at 25 °C, has no inhibitory activity when assayed at 25 °C. However, at 37 °C, a 3-fold increase in the monomeric fraction of C41L-PLB on SDS-PAGE resulted in inhibitory activity comparable to that of wt-PLB. Upon increasing the temperature from 25 to 37 °C, no change in fraction monomer or inhibitory activity for wt-PLB and L37A-PLB was observed. Based on these results, the extent of inhibition of Ca-ATPase by PLB or its mutants appears to depend not only on the propensity of PLB to dissociate into monomers but also on the relative potency of the particular PLB monomer when interacting with the Ca-ATPase.

Although the expression of PLB is largely restricted to cardiac SR, to a lesser extent its presence is reported in slow-twitch skeletal muscle SR (7Briggs F.N. Lee K.F. Wechsler A.W. Jones L.R. J.

Cell Calcium. 1990; 11: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In its unphosphorylated form, PLB inhibits the rate of Ca2+ pumping and ATP hydrolysis by the Ca-ATPase at subsaturating [Ca2+]. Upon phosphorylation of PLB by cAMP-dependent protein kinase A or Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, this inhibition is relieved (4Colyer J. Cardiovasc.

Systematic replacement of single hydrophobic amino acid residues, Leu or Ile, by Ala in the membrane-spanning region transformed PLB from pentameric to monomeric form on SDS-PAGE (19Simmerman H.K.B.

Based on these results, a model for a tightly packed coiled-coil pentamer (19Simmerman H.K.B. Kobayashi Y.M. Autry J.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol.

Monomeric mutants of PLB were shown to be more potent inhibitors of the cardiac isoform of the Ca-ATPase (SERCA2a) when coexpressed in a heterologous system (22Autry J.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15872-15880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 23Kimura Y. Kurzydlowski M. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol.

By using EPR spectroscopy, it was shown that PLB exists in an average oligomeric size of 3.5 in DOPC vesicles, and upon phosphorylation the average oligomeric size increased to 5.3 (26Cornea R.L. Jones L.R. Autry J.M. Thomas D.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2960-2967Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). This study suggested the existence of a dynamic equilibrium between PLB subunits in the lipid bilayer and that the regulation of the oligomeric state of PLB is critical for its regulation of the Ca-ATPase. This led to the hypothesis that the active inhibitory species of PLB is the monomer and that increased oligomerization of PLB upon phosphorylation contributes to relief of the inhibition (22Autry J.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15872-15880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 23Kimura Y. Kurzydlowski M. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol.

However, there are several unanswered questions as follows. (a) So far only pentamer/monomer (e.g. native PLB) and purely monomeric (e.g. L37A-PLB) structural mutants of PLB and their functional effects have been reported (22Autry J.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15872-15880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 23Kimura Y. Kurzydlowski M. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15061-15064Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), but this does not exclude the possibility of other oligomeric forms of PLB as inhibitory species. (b) In a coexpression system the relative ratios of PLB and Ca-ATPase may vary, so it is possible that the apparent enhanced inhibition of the pump by the monomeric mutants is due to variation in expression levels of PLB mutants and Ca-ATPase. In the present study, we have tested the inhibitory function of recombinant wild type-PLB (wt-PLB) and two different structural mutants, a phospholamban monomer and tetramer (19Simmerman H.K.B. Kobayashi Y.M. Autry J.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5941-5946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), using an in vitro co-reconstitution system (15Reddy L.G.

Stokes D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14964-14970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We have characterized the inhibitory function of these structural mutants as a function of increasing molar ratios of PLB/Ca-ATPase and as a function of temperature. The correlation of these results with the oligomeric states of these mutants, as indicated by SDS-PAGE, provides new insight into the structural basis of Ca-ATPase regulation by PLB. The reagents used were octaethylene glycol monododecyl ether (C12E8), β-octyl glucoside (β-OG), and Biobeads SM2 were purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine (DOPC), dioleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE), egg yolk phosphatidylcholine (EYPC), and egg yolk phosphatidic acid (EYPA) were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). The reagents for SDS-PAGE (16.5% Tris/Tricine ready gels and the Tris/Tricine gel running buffer) and the PVDF membrane used for immunoblots were from Bio-Rad. Anti-PLB monoclonal antibody (2D12) was prepared as described previously (7Briggs F.N. Lee K.F. Wechsler A.W. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26056-26061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Reddy L.G. Jones L.R. Cala S.E. O'Brian J.J. Tatulian S.A. Stokes D.L. J. Biol.

Horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-mouse antibody was supplied by Fisher (Southern Biotechnology Laboratories, Inc.). The substrate for horseradish peroxidase, 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB) reagent, and Reactive Red affinity column were purchased from Sigma. All the other reagents were of highest purity available and were purchased from Sigma. Recombinant wt-PLB and the mutants were expressed in Sf21/baculovirus insect cell system and purified by monoclonal antibody (2D12) affinity column chromatography as described previously (15Reddy L.G.

The concentration of PLB was determined by the Amido Black assay (29Schaffner W. Weissman C. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 56: 502-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (1954) Google Scholar). The purified protein was stored at −70 °C at a protein concentration of 1.5–2.5 mg/ml, in a buffer (“OG buffer”) containing 88 mm MOPS, 18 mm glycine, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.92% β-octyl glucoside (β-OG) at pH 7.2. Rabbit skeletal sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca-ATPase was purified from light SR using the reactive-red affinity chromatography method (30Stokes D.L. Green N.M Biophys. J. 1990; 57: 1-14Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The method used for functional reconstitution of Ca-ATPase with PLB has been described previously (15Reddy L.G. Jones L.R.

In short, the required amount of PLB (5–25 μg) in OG buffer was dried (lyophilized) and solubilized in 80 μl of CHCl3 containing 20 μl of 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol and 0.8 mg of DOPC/DOPE (20% DOPE, by weight) for ATP hydrolysis measurements, or EYPC/EYPA (20% EYPA, by weight) for Ca2+ uptake measurements. The solvent was dried under nitrogen and the residual solvent was removed by pumping the sample under vacuum. The dried film of lipid and PLB was hydrated with 50 μl of 20 mmimidazole, pH 7.0, by vortexing throughly followed by a brief sonication. The resulting vesicles, containing lipid and PLB, were made to 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 0.1 m KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol; then 1.6 mg of β-OG was added followed by 20 μg of purified Ca-ATPase, in a final volume of 100 μl with buffer. For Ca2+ uptake rate measurements, the buffer contained 0.1 m K2 oxalate instead of KCl. The detergent was then removed by incubation with 40 mg of wet Biobeads (25 mg of Biobeads SM2/1 mg of detergent) for 3 h at room temperature. The resultant Ca-ATPase/PLB lipid vesicles were separated from Biobeads and immediately assayed for Ca2+ uptake or ATP hydrolysis activity. Prior to the assay, the reconstituted vesicles were incubated with or without PLB monoclonal antibody, 2D12 (22Autry J.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15872-15880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), at a molar ratio of PLB/Ab = 1, for 15 min on ice. 45Ca2+uptake measurements were carried using the microfiltration method (31Martonosi A. Feretos R. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 648-658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as described previously (15Reddy L.G. Jones L.R. Cala S.E. O'Brian J.J. Tatulian S.A. Stokes D.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 14964-14970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) at 25 °C. Each assay was done in duplicate at pCa 5.4 and 6.8 in a volume of 0.25 ml which contained 1–2 μg of Ca-ATPase (10–20 μl of vesicles after the addition of PLB antibody), 50 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 0.095m K2SO4, 5 mmMgCl2, 5 mm NaN3, 5 mmK2 oxalate, 0.5 mm EGTA, and different concentrations of CaCl2 to obtain pCa values of 5.4 and 6.8; free calcium concentrations were calculated by the method of Fabiato and Fabiato (32Fabiato A. Fabiato F. J. Physiol. (Paris). 1979; 75: 463-505PubMed Google Scholar). The final 45Ca2+in the assay mix was 30 to 50 μCi. The assay mixture also contained 1 μm each of carbonyl cyanidep-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone and valinomycin to dissipate gradients of pH and K+, respectively, and thus to collapse any membrane potential that develops (33Levy D. Gulik A. Bluzart A. Rigaud J.-L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1107: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Ca2+uptake was initiated by the addition of 5 mm ATP. Aliquots of 100 μl were filtered at 30 s and 2 min (pCa 5.4) or 6 min (pCa 6.8) after the addition of ATP (we found that these time points gave linear calcium uptake) using 0.22-μm filters (GS type, Millipore) and were washed twice with 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 100 mm K2SO4, 10 mm MgCl2, and 3 mmLaCl3. Quantitation of 45Ca2+ was done by scintillation counting, and the initial calcium uptake rate was calculated from the slope of the line joining the two time points. ATPase activity was assayed by measuring the inorganic phosphate released from the hydrolysis of ATP by Ca-ATPase at 25 and 37 °C, using the method of Lanzetta et al. (34Lanzetta P.A. Alvarez L.J. Reinach P.S. Candia O.A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1821) Google Scholar). Each assay was done in triplicate at pCa 5.4 and 6.8 in a volume of 0.12 ml that contained 0.5–1.0 μg of Ca-ATPase (5–10 μl of vesicles), 50 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 0.1 m KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1–2 μg/ml calcium ionophore (A23187), and different concentrations of CaCl2 to obtain pCa values of 5.4 and 6.8. ATP hydrolysis was initiated by the addition of 2.5 mm ATP. Aliquots of 50 μl were taken at zero time (immediately after the addition of ATP) and at 2 (pCa 5.4) or 6 min (pCa 6.8) and dispensed into 400 μl of malachite green reagent followed by the addition of 50 μl of 34% sodium citrate after 30 s. The absorbance was read at 650 nm, and the rate of ATP hydrolysis was calculated using a standard curve from known concentrations of inorganic phosphate. Reconstituted vesicles were subjected to sucrose gradient centrifugation to separate unincorporated PLB from vesicles containing PLB and Ca-ATPase. After functional assays, 20 μl of the remaining vesicles were loaded on top of a stepwise gradient of 50 (50 μl), 20 (170 μl), 15 (170 μl), 10 (170 μl), and 5% (50 μl) sucrose in 0.8-ml centrifuge tubes. The gradients were centrifuged for 14–16 h at 140,000 ×g (Beckman, SW55 Ti rotor). Fractions of 100–120 μl were collected from the bottom of the tube and subjected to immunoblot analysis. A small volume of each fraction was diluted into transfer buffer (25 mm Tris base, 193 mm glycine, 0.1% SDS, and 10% methanol) and applied to PVDF (polyvinylidene difluoride) membranes (Bio-Rad) using a Slot-Blot apparatus (Bio-Rad). After blocking the membrane with 1% non-fat dry milk, it was incubated for 1 h with monoclonal anti-PLB antibody (2D12). The membrane was washed and incubated for 1 h with goat anti-mouse antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. The membrane was then washed and the immunoreactive protein bands were developed with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB) reagent (Sigma). The immunoblots were scanned by a densitometer using the reflectance mode, and the bands were quantitated using the volume (area × density) analysis method. The densities of the bands were within the linear range of intensities. PLB (wt-PLB) and its mutants, C41L-PLB and L37A-PLB (50–100 ng), were subjected to SDS-PAGE (16.5% Tris/Tricine gels, Bio-Rad) at various temperatures, and proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes in 25 mm Tris (base), 193 mm glycine, pH 8.3, 10% methanol, and 0.1% SDS for 1 h at 4 °C and 200 mA constant current. After blocking the membrane with 1% non-fat dry milk, it was incubated for 1 h with monoclonal anti-PLB antibody (2D12). The membrane was washed and incubated for 1 h with goat anti-mouse antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. The membrane was then washed, and the immunoreactive protein bands were developed with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB) reagent (Sigma). The immunoblots were scanned by a densitometer using the reflectance mode, and the bands were quantitated using the volume (area × density) analysis method. On SDS-PAGE, wild type PLB (wt-PLB) migrates primarily as a pentamer, with a small fraction as monomer (17Wegener A.D. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1834-1841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mutants of PLB used in this study, C41L-PLB (Cys 41 to Leu) and L37A-PLB (Leu 37 to Ala), migrated predominantly as tetramer and monomer, respectively, on SDS-PAGE at 25 °C (Fig.1) (19Simmerman H.K.B. Kobayashi Y.M. Autry J.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5941-5946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The inhibitory function of recombinant PLB (wt-PLB) and its mutants, C41L-PLB and L37A-PLB, was tested in a reconstituted system. Co-reconstitution was done using purified skeletal SR Ca-ATPase and purified PLB in EYPC/EYPA lipid vesicles for Ca2+uptake measurements, and in DOPC/DOPE lipid vesicles for ATP hydrolysis measurements. When EYPC/EYPA or pure DOPC was used for reconstitution, the ATP hydrolysis activity of the enzyme was too low at pCa 6.8 (low calcium) to obtain acceptable precision. Addition of 20% DOPE (by weight) to DOPC enhanced the activity by 40%, providing adequate precision at low calcium. Inhibitory activity of PLB and the mutants, C41L-PLB and L37A-PLB, was assayed by measuring Ca2+ uptake and ATP hydrolysis rates in the presence and absence of anti-PLB monoclonal antibody (2D12). In coexpression studies, the extent of inhibition by PLB or its mutants has usually been reported as a shift (increase or decrease) in K Ca (Ca2+ concentration at which Ca2+ stimulation of activity is half-maximal) compared with the control (no PLB), obtained from a curve of Ca-ATPase activity versus pCa (22Autry J.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15872-15880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 23Kimura Y. Kurzydlowski M. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15061-15064Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 35Kimura Y. Asahi M. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14238-14241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In the present study, only two calcium concentrations were used, pCa 5.4 (“high calcium”), where Ca2+ uptake and Ca-ATPase activities are maximal (V max), andpCa 6.8 (“low calcium”), where the shift inK Ca caused by PLB results in a substantial inhibition. Thus at high calcium, only V maxeffects are observed, and at low calcium both effects are observed. We report the extent of inhibition as the percent decrease (percent inhibition) in the Ca-ATPase activity, compared with the activity in the presence of anti-PLB antibody (+PLB-Ab), which is functionally equivalent to PLB phosphorylation and therefore reports the disinhibited SERCA state (15Reddy L.G. Jones L.R. Cala S.E. O'Brian J.J. Tatulian S.A. Stokes D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9390-9397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). At 25 °C and pCa 5.4, there is no significant difference in calcium uptake rates in the absence and presence of anti-PLB antibody (Fig. 2, left panel), indicating that PLB or its mutants have no significant effect on the maximal velocity (V max) of the Ca-ATPase. On the other hand, at pCa 6.8 (Fig. 2, right panel), wt-PLB, C41L-PLB, and L37A-PLB inhibit the pump by 48% (0.41 ± 0.10 IU, −PLB-Ab versus 0.80 ± 0.16 IU, +PLB-Ab), 14% (1.06 ± 0.13 IU, −PLB-Ab versus1.23 ± 0.15 IU, +PLB-Ab), and 64% (0.362 ± 0.09 IU, −PLB-Ab versus 1.020 ± 0.17 IU, +PLB-Ab), respectively. Thus C41L-PLB has a much smaller inhibitory effect than wt-PLB, and L37A-PLB has a much larger inhibitory effect than wt-PLB. These inhibitory effects, for both wt-PLB and L37A-PLB, are due to a shift in calcium sensitivity (an increase inK Ca) of the Ca-ATPase. As a more direct measure of PLB effects on SERCA activity, we also measured ATP hydrolysis by the reconstituted Ca-ATPase in the presence of calcium ionophore A23187 at 25 °C. With the use of the calcium ionophore, no transported Ca2+ is retained by the vesicles, allowing the ATPase to operate freely in the absence of generated Ca2+ gradients. With this method of assay, ATPase hydrolysis by the Ca2+ pump is not limited by the finite Ca2+ capacity of the reconstituted vesicles, and the permeability of the lipid vesicles themselves does not act as a confounding variable. At saturating [Ca2+] (pCa 5.4), neither wt-PLB nor the two mutants (C41L-PLB and L37A-PLB) significantly affected the ATP hydrolysis rate (Fig. 3,left panel); ATP hydrolysis rates were identical in the presence and absence of the anti-PLB antibody. At pCa 6.8 (Fig. 3, right panel) wt-PLB and L37A-PLB inhibited the ATP hydrolysis rates significantly, whereas C41L-PLB was without appreciable effect. As observed with the coexpression system (22Autry J.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15872-15880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 23Kimura Y. Kurzydlowski M. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15061-15064Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), monomeric L37A-PLB inhibited the Ca-ATPase more effectively than pentameric wt-PLB. As observed with the Ca2+ transport assay, the inhibitory effect of co-reconstituted PLB on the ATP hydrolysis rates was prevented by the anti-PLB antibody. Thus, the co-reconstitution method with purified proteins gives results similar to those obtained with the cellular coexpression method for investigating PLB/SERCA regulatory interactions. Although the functional (inhibitory) effects of wt-PLB, C41L-PLB, and L37A-PLB obtained from ATP hydrolysis measurements are qualitatively similar to those obtained from Ca2+ uptake measurements, the overall rates of Ca2+ uptake at pCa 6.8 are significantly higher than the ATP hydrolysis rates. This could be due to the difference in lipid composition used for reconstitutions for these two different activity measurements. Also, the ATP hydrolysis rates are slightly lower in C41L-PLB/Ca-ATPase and L37A-PLB/Ca-ATPase reconstituted vesicles compared with wt-PLB/Ca-ATPase reconstituted vesicles and significantly lower compared with control (Ca-ATPase alone) vesicles. However, the Ca2+ uptake and ATP hydrolysis rates of Ca-ATPase atpCa 5.4 in the absence and presence of anti-PLB antibody are similar, indicating that the variations in the rates are not due to PLB or its mutants. The PLB-induced inhibitory effects discussed above (Figs. 2 and 3) were measured at added PLB/Ca-ATPase molar ratio of 10 in the reconstituted system. In cardiac SR, the molar ratio of PLB/Ca-ATPase is reported to be in the range of 5–8 (37Ferrington D.A. Moewe P.L. Yao Q. Bigelow D.J. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: A356Google Scholar). At an added PLB/Ca-ATPase molar ratio of 10, if the insertion of PLB in the lipid bilayers is symmetric and the Ca-ATPase is asymmetric (36.Deleted in proof.Google Scholar), then the effective PLB/Ca-ATPase molar ratio is only 5, which is on the lower side of the reported molar ratio in cardiac SR. Also, if the inhibitory species of PLB is a monomer, then increasing the molar ratio of PLB/Ca-ATPase should also increase the amount of monomer, which should reflect in the inhibitory effects of wt-PLB and its mutant, specifically C41L-PLB. To test this, we have studied the inhibitory effects of PLB and its mutants, C41L-PLB and L37A-PLB, at different molar ratios of PLB/Ca-ATPase at pCa 5.4 and 6.8. In order to ensure that the effects were not due to differences in the efficiency of incorporation, we measured directly the fraction of PLB incorporated into vesicles. PLB and its mutants, C41L-PLB and L37A-PLB, were reconstituted at added PLB/Ca-ATPase molar ratios of 5, 10, and 25 and measured the fraction of added PLB incorporated into lipid vesicles by separating free PLB from ves"

A power law relation between compression rate and surface pressure and an Arrhenius temperature dependence of the steady-state creep rate were observed in data from compression rate and creep experiments in the collapse region. These relations were combined into a single constitutive equation to calculate the temperature dependence of the collapse pressure with a maximum error of 5 percent for temperatures ranging from 10 degrees to 25 degrees C."

It was the first KRAB-zinc finger protein for which a transcriptional repressor activity was demonstrated. Subsequently, the KRAB-A domain was identified as a widespread transcriptional repressor motif. We now present a biochemical and functional analysis of the Kid-1 protein in transfected cells. The full-length Kid-1 protein is targeted to the nucleolus and adheres tightly to as yet undefined nucleolar structures, leading eventually to the disintegration of the nucleolus. The tight adherence and nucleolar distribution can be attributed to the larger zinc finger cluster, whereas the KRAB-A domain is responsible for the nucleolar fragmentation. Upon disintegration of the nucleolus, the nucleolar transcription factor upstream binding factor disappears from the nucleolar fragments. In the absence of Kid-1, the KRIP-1 protein, which represents the natural interacting partner of zinc finger proteins with a KRAB-A domain, is homogeneously distributed in the nucleus, whereas coexpression of Kid-1 leads to a shift of KRIP-1 into the nucleolus. Nucleolar run-ons demonstrate that rDNA transcription is shut off in the nucleolar fragments. Our data demonstrate the functional diversity of the KRAB and zinc finger domains of Kid-1 and provide new functional insights into the regulation of the nucleolar structure."

https://openalex.org/W172482956,"Cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) combined with three-dimensional image reconstruction techniques allows researchers to view macromolecular structures at resolutions below 10 Å. Cryo-EM has thus become an alternative method for solving the structure of biomolecules that remain beyond the reach of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) or x-ray crystallographic methods. Cryo-EM is an improvement over these methods in other ways as well. NMR is limited by the size of the molecule that can be studied (30 kD or less) and by the solubility of the molecule in question. X-ray crystallography is limited by the ability to make crystals that diffract appropriately. Cryo-EM does not suffer from these limitations and, in addition, offers a view of the hydrated conformation of biological molecules. The method has been extremely useful, for example, in the elucidation of the structure of whole viruses."
