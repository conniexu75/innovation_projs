https://openalex.org/W2169702034,"The evolutionary interaction between influenza A virus and the human immune system, manifest as 'antigenic drift' of the viral haemagglutinin, is one of the best described patterns in molecular evolution. However, little is known about the genome-scale evolutionary dynamics of this pathogen. Similarly, how genomic processes relate to global influenza epidemiology, in which the A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 subtypes co-circulate, is poorly understood. Here through an analysis of 1,302 complete viral genomes sampled from temperate populations in both hemispheres, we show that the genomic evolution of influenza A virus is characterized by a complex interplay between frequent reassortment and periodic selective sweeps. The A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 subtypes exhibit different evolutionary dynamics, with diverse lineages circulating in A/H1N1, indicative of weaker antigenic drift. These results suggest a sink-source model of viral ecology in which new lineages are seeded from a persistent influenza reservoir, which we hypothesize to be located in the tropics, to sink populations in temperate regions."

In the present study, we investigated miRNAs role in endothelial cell response to hypoxia. We found that the expression of miR-210 progressively increased upon exposure to hypoxia. miR-210 overexpression in normoxic endothelial cells stimulated the formation of capillary-like structures on Matrigel and vascular endothelial growth factor-driven cell migration. Conversely, miR-210 blockade via anti-miRNA transfection inhibited the formation of capillary-like structures stimulated by hypoxia and decreased cell migration in response to vascular endothelial growth factor. miR-210 overexpression did not affect endothelial cell growth in both normoxia and hypoxia. However, anti-miR-210 transfection inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis, in both normoxia and hypoxia. We determined that one relevant target of miR-210 in hypoxia was Ephrin-A3 since miR-210 was necessary and sufficient to down-modulate its expression. Moreover, luciferase reporter assays showed that Ephrin-A3 was a direct target of miR-210. Ephrin-A3 modulation by miR-210 had significant functional consequences; indeed, the expression of an Ephrin-A3 allele that is not targeted by miR-210 prevented miR-210-mediated stimulation of both tubulogenesis and chemotaxis. We conclude that miR-210 up-regulation is a crucial element of endothelial cell response to hypoxia, affecting cell survival, migration, and differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2158153532,"Numerous longevity genes have been discovered in model organisms and altering their function results in prolonged lifespan. In mammals, some have speculated that any health benefits derived from manipulating these same pathways might be offset by increased cancer risk on account of their propensity to boost cell survival. The Sir2/SIRT1 family of NAD+-dependent deacetylases is proposed to underlie the health benefits of calorie restriction (CR), a diet that broadly suppresses cancer in mammals. Here we show that CR induces a two-fold increase SIRT1 expression in the intestine of rodents and that ectopic induction of SIRT1 in a β-catenin-driven mouse model of colon cancer significantly reduces tumor formation, proliferation, and animal morbidity in the absence of CR. We show that SIRT1 deacetylates β-catenin and suppresses its ability to activate transcription and drive cell proliferation. Moreover, SIRT1 promotes cytoplasmic localization of the otherwise nuclear-localized oncogenic form of β-catenin. Consistent with this, a significant inverse correlation was found between the presence of nuclear SIRT1 and the oncogenic form of β−catenin in 81 human colon tumor specimens analyzed. Taken together, these observations show that SIRT1 suppresses intestinal tumor formation in vivo and raise the prospect that therapies targeting SIRT1 may be of clinical use in β−catenin-driven malignancies."
https://openalex.org/W2070636596,"RGS5, a signalling protein that regulates the activity of G proteins, is shown to be an important regulator of the tumour vasculature. Deletion of Rgs5 leads to normalization of blood vessels of tumours, making them less leaky and improving their coverage with pericytes. As a consequence, more immune cells that can target the tumour cells actually reach the tumour, which enhances the survival of tumour-bearing mice. Thus RGS5 signalling might be a target for anticancer therapy, in particular in combination with approaches that enhance an antitumour immune response. RGS5, a signalling protein that regulates the activity of G proteins, is shown to be an important regulator of the tumour vasculature. Deletion of RGS5 leads to normalization of blood vessels of tumours, making them less leady and improving their coverage with pericytes. As a consequence, more immune cells that can target the tumour cells reach the tumour, which enhances the survival of tumour-bearing mice. The vasculature of solid tumours is morphologically aberrant and characterized by dilated and fragile vessels, intensive vessel sprouting and loss of hierarchical architecture1. Constant vessel remodelling leads to spontaneous haemorrhages2 and increased interstitial fluid pressure in the tumour environment3,4. Tumour-related angiogenesis supports tumour growth and is also a major obstacle for successful immune therapy as it prevents migration of immune effector cells into established tumour parenchyma2,5,6. The molecular mechanisms for these angiogenic alterations are largely unknown. Here we identify regulator of G-protein signalling 5 (Rgs5) as a master gene responsible for the abnormal tumour vascular morphology in mice. Loss of Rgs5 results in pericyte maturation, vascular normalization and consequent marked reductions in tumour hypoxia and vessel leakiness. These vascular and intratumoral changes enhance influx of immune effector cells into tumour parenchyma and markedly prolong survival of tumour-bearing mice. This is the first demonstration, to our knowledge, of reduced tumour angiogenesis and improved immune therapeutic outcome on loss of a vascular gene function and establishes a previously unrecognized role of G-protein signalling in tumour angiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2050339362,"FtsZ is a tubulin homolog and the major cytoskeletal protein in bacterial cell division. It assembles into the Z ring, which contains FtsZ and a dozen other division proteins, and constricts to divide the cell. We have constructed a membrane-targeted FtsZ (FtsZ-mts) by splicing an amphipathic helix to its C terminus. When mixed with lipid vesicles, FtsZ-mts was incorporated into the interior of some tubular vesicles. There it formed multiple Z rings that could move laterally in both directions along the length of the liposome and coalesce into brighter Z rings. Brighter Z rings produced visible constrictions in the liposome, suggesting that FtsZ itself can assemble the Z ring and generate a force. No other proteins were needed for assembly and force generation."
https://openalex.org/W1970445701,"We often face alternatives that we are free to choose between. Planning movements to select an alternative involves several areas in frontal and parietal cortex that are anatomically connected into long-range circuits. These areas must coordinate their activity to select a common movement goal, but how neural circuits make decisions remains poorly understood. Here we simultaneously record from the dorsal premotor area (PMd) in frontal cortex and the parietal reach region (PRR) in parietal cortex to investigate neural circuit mechanisms for decision making. We find that correlations in spike and local field potential (LFP) activity between these areas are greater when monkeys are freely making choices than when they are following instructions. We propose that a decision circuit featuring a sub-population of cells in frontal and parietal cortex may exchange information to coordinate activity between these areas. Cells participating in this decision circuit may influence movement choices by providing a common bias to the selection of movement goals."
https://openalex.org/W2079390303,"Background Although the induction of behavioural unconsciousness during sleep and general anaesthesia has been shown to involve overlapping brain mechanisms, sleep involves cyclic fluctuations between different brain states known as active (paradoxical or rapid eye movement: REM) and quiet (slow-wave or non-REM: nREM) stages whereas commonly used general anaesthetics induce a unitary slow-wave brain state. Methodology/Principal Findings Long-duration, multi-site forebrain field recordings were performed in urethane-anaesthetized rats. A spontaneous and rhythmic alternation of brain state between activated and deactivated electroencephalographic (EEG) patterns was observed. Individual states and their transitions resembled the REM/nREM cycle of natural sleep in their EEG components, evolution, and time frame (∼11 minute period). Other physiological variables such as muscular tone, respiration rate, and cardiac frequency also covaried with forebrain state in a manner identical to sleep. The brain mechanisms of state alternations under urethane also closely overlapped those of natural sleep in their sensitivity to cholinergic pharmacological agents and dependence upon activity in the basal forebrain nuclei that are the major source of forebrain acetylcholine. Lastly, stimulation of brainstem regions thought to pace state alternations in sleep transiently disrupted state alternations under urethane. Conclusions/Significance Our results suggest that urethane promotes a condition of behavioural unconsciousness that closely mimics the full spectrum of natural sleep. The use of urethane anaesthesia as a model system will facilitate mechanistic studies into sleep-like brain states and their alternations. In addition, it could also be exploited as a tool for the discovery of new molecular targets that are designed to promote sleep without compromising state alternations."
https://openalex.org/W1979334313,"Quasi-particles with fractional charge and statistics, as well as modified Coulomb interactions, exist in a two-dimensional electron system in the fractional quantum Hall (FQH) regime. Theoretical models of the FQH state at filling fraction v = 5/2 make the further prediction that the wave function can encode the interchange of two quasi-particles, making this state relevant for topological quantum computing. We show that bias-dependent tunneling across a narrow constriction at v = 5/2 exhibits temperature scaling and, from fits to the theoretical scaling form, extract values for the effective charge and the interaction parameter of the quasi-particles. Ranges of values obtained are consistent with those predicted by certain models of the 5/2 state."
https://openalex.org/W2062236151,"FoxO proteins are key transcriptional regulators of nutrient homeostasis and stress response. The transcription factor FoxO1 activates expression of gluconeogenic, including phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and glucose-6-phosphatase, and also activates the expression of the oxidative stress response enzymes catalase and manganese superoxide dismutase. Hormonal and stress-dependent regulation of FoxO1 via acetylation, ubiquitination, and phosphorylation, are well established, but FoxOs have not been studied in the context of the glucose-derived O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) modification. Here we show that O-GlcNAc on hepatic FoxO1 is increased in diabetes. Furthermore, O-GlcNAc regulates FoxO1 activation in response to glucose, resulting in the paradoxically increased expression of gluconeogenic genes while concomitantly inducing expression of genes encoding enzymes that detoxify reactive oxygen species.

GlcNAcylation of FoxO provides a new mechanism for direct nutrient control of transcription to regulate metabolism and stress response through control of FoxO1 activity. Nutrient homeostasis is tightly regulated to ensure the health of sensitive cells and tissues. Molecular mechanisms to counter the adverse effects of nutrient excess are overwhelmed in diabetes and result in diseases of the nervous system, heart, vasculature, and kidneys (1Buse M.G. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 290: E1-E8Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Key molecules that respond to, and regulate, nutrient and stress levels include the forkhead transcription factor FoxO1 (FKHR) 2The abbreviations used are: FKHR, forkhead transcription factor FoxO1; O-GlcNAc, O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine; Pepck, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase; G6pc, glucose-6-phosphatase; MnSOD, manganese superoxide dismutase; OGT, O-GlcNAc transferase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; GFP, green fluorescent protein; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; PUGNAc, O-(2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-glucopyranosylidene) amino-N-phenylcarbamate; HA, hemagglutinin; RT, reverse transcription; ETD, electron transfer dissociation; MS/MS, tandem mass spectrometryl; HBP, hexosamine biosynthetic pathway; DON, 6-diazo-5-oxonorleucine; STZ, streptozotocin. 2The abbreviations used are: FKHR, forkhead transcription factor FoxO1; O-GlcNAc, O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine; Pepck, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase; G6pc, glucose-6-phosphatase; MnSOD, manganese superoxide dismutase; OGT, O-GlcNAc transferase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; GFP, green fluorescent protein; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; PUGNAc, O-(2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-glucopyranosylidene) amino-N-phenylcarbamate; HA, hemagglutinin; RT, reverse transcription; ETD, electron transfer dissociation; MS/MS, tandem mass spectrometryl; HBP, hexosamine biosynthetic pathway; DON, 6-diazo-5-oxonorleucine; STZ, streptozotocin. and the post-translational modification O-GlcNAc. The FoxO transcription factors are important regulators of broad gene expression programs, which include metabolism (e.g. gluconeogenesis, amino acid catabolism, glycolysis, pentose phosphate shunt, and fatty acid/triglyceride/sterol synthesis) (2Zhang W.

Brunet A. Griffith E.C. Greenberg M.E. Sci. STKE. 2003; 2003: re5Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of insulin, this highly conserved pathway results in the nuclear exclusion of FoxO1 upon protein kinase B (PKB)/AKT phosphorylation. Three key sites of AKT phosphorylation have been identified for FoxO1: threonine 24, serine 256, and serine 319. Homologs of FoxO1, including FoxO3 and FoxO4, contain conserved AKT phosphorylation sites and are regulated by insulin signaling in a similar manner (9van der Horst A. Burgering B.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 8: 440-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). Nuclear exclusion of FoxO eventually leads to its ubiquitination and degradation (10Plas D.R. Thompson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12361-12366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Stress stimuli also alter FoxO3 activation and turnover via deacetylation by SIRT1 (7Brunet A. Sweeney L.B. Sturgill J.F. Chua K.F. Greer P.L. Lin Y. Tran H. Ross S.E. Mostoslavsky R. Cohen H.Y. Hu L.S. Cheng H.L. Jedrychowski M.P. Gygi S.P. Sinclair D.A. Alt F.W. Greenberg M.E. Science. 2004; 303: 2011-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (2570) Google Scholar). The highly abundant and dynamic post-translational modification, O-GlcNAc, is implicated in stress responses, insulin signaling, nutrient sensing, cell cycle progression, protein turnover, translation, and transcription, in addition to other biological processes (11Hart G.W. Housley M.P. Slawson C. Nature. 2007; 446: 1017-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar, 12Love D.C. Hanover J.A. Sci. STKE. 2005; 2005: re13PubMed Google Scholar). O-GlcNAc rapidly cycles on serine and threonine residues of nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins in a fashion analogous to phosphorylation. Unlike phosphorylation, however, the addition of O-GlcNAc is performed by a single catalytic subunit (O-GlcNAc transferase; OGT) as opposed to hundreds of kinases and requires interactions with adaptor molecules for specificity to the hundreds of target proteins (11Hart G.W. Housley M.P. Slawson C. Nature. 2007; 446: 1017-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). O-GlcNAc functions as a nutrient sensor because the intracellular concentration of the donor sugar for GlcNAcylation, UDP-GlcNAc, rapidly responds to flux through multiple metabolic pathways, and OGT activity is highly dependent upon the concentration of this donor substrate (13Haltiwanger R.S. Holt G.D. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2563-2568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Elevated flux through the UDP-GlcNAc synthetic pathway results in insulin resistance (the hallmark of type II diabetes) of peripheral tissues (14Marshall S. Bacote V. Traxinger R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4706-4712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In murine adipocytes, elevated O-GlcNAc directly causes insulin resistance as measured by reduced 2-deoxyglucose uptake (15Vosseller K. Wells L. Lane M.D. Hart G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5313-5318Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Overexpression of OGT in muscle or adipose tissues of transgenic mice results in diabetes (16McClain D.A. Lubas W.A. Cooksey R.C.

However, elevated O-GlcNAc appears to be protective against heat shock (17Zachara N.E. O'Donnell N. Cheung W.D. Mercer J.J. Marth J.D. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30133-30142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). In the heart, O-GlcNAc is protective against ischemic stress (18Liu J. Pang Y. Chang T. Bounelis P. Chatham J.C. Marchase R.B. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2006; 40: 303-312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), highlighting the importance of this post-translational modification to the stress response. In mammals and plants, deletion of OGT is lethal (19Shafi R. Iyer S.P. Ellies L.G. O'Donnell N. Marek K.W. Chui D. Hart G.W. Marth J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, in C. elegans, an OGT knock-out was found to have altered glycogen and trehalose storage and dauer formation induced by a temperature-sensitive daf-2 allele, indicating a role for OGT in insulin signaling (21Hanover J.A. Forsythe M.E. Hennessey P.T. Brodigan T.M. Love D.C. Ashwell G. Krause M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 11266-11271Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Preliminary studies have shown FoxO1 to be GlcNAcylated (22Housley M.P. Rodgers J.T. Puigserver P. Hart G.W. FASEB J. 2006; 20: A955Google Scholar, 23Kuo M. Zilberfarb V. Gangneux N. Christeff N. Issad T. FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 829-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar); however, detailed mechanistic insights and their relevance to diabetes have not been elucidated. Here, we show that FoxO1 is GlcNAcylated in liver and that the modification is increased in diabetic rats. Furthermore, the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway serves to sense glucose levels and regulate FoxO1 transcriptional activation through GlcNAcylation of key amino acids in a complex interplay with FoxO phosphorylation.

The protein-bound beads were enzymatically digested with either endoproteinase LysC (Roche Applied Science) or endoproteinase AspN (Roche Applied Science) at an enzyme-to-substrate ratio of 1:20 in 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8, at room temperature while shaking for 6.5 h. Supernatant containing the resulting proteolytic peptides was removed from the spun-down beads and acidified to pH 3.5 with glacial acetic acid (Sigma-Aldrich). An aliquot of the supernatant from the digested sample was loaded onto a polyimide-coated, fused silica capillary reverse phase precolumn (360-μm outer diameter × 75-μm inner diameter; Polymicro Technologies) packed with C18 resin (5–20-μm diameter, 120-Å pore size; YMC Inc.) and desalted with 0.1% acetic acid. The precolumn was connected to a capillary analytical column (360-μm outer diameter × 50-μm inner diameter) packed with C18 resin (5-μm diameter, 120-Å pore size; YMC Inc.) and equipped with an integrated, electrospray emitter as described in Ref. 35Martin S.E.

The peptides were eluted into the mass spectrometer at a flow rate of 60 nl/min with a gradient of 0–60% B in 60 min and 60–100% B in 5 min (A = 0.1 m acetic acid, B = 70% acetonitrile, 0.1 m acetic acid) using a 1100 series binary high pressure liquid chromatography (Agilent Technologies) (35Martin S.E.

Aliquots of samples were analyzed on a Thermo Electron LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Full mass spectra were acquired with the Orbitrap analyzer operated at a resolving power of 30,000 (at m/z 400). Collision-activated dissociation tandem mass spectra were acquired data-dependently with the quadrupole linear ion trap analyzer. ETD MS/MS spectra were acquired on a Finnigan LTQ (Thermo Fisher Scientific) modified in house with a chemical ionization source to generate fluoranthene radical anions for fragmentation via ETD (45 msec ETD reaction) (36Syka J.E.

Targeted ETD MS/MS were acquired on a second Finnigan LTQ (Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with a prototype Thermo Fisher ETD upgrade (100-ms ETD reaction, AGC target for ETD reagent ions 1E5). All of the data were interpreted manually. Galactose Labeling Assays—O-GlcNAc levels were measured by [3H]UDP-galactose labeling of GlcNAc (37Torres C.R. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3308-3317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). FoxO1 was immunoprecipitated using cold-labeled antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology) from 0.1 g of liver lysed in 10 ml of radio-immune precipitation assay buffer. The immunoprecipitates were then labeled overnight, separated by SDS-PAGE, and stained with Coomassie G-250. Following destaining, the gels were treated with En3Hance (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and exposed to autoradiography film. Animal Experiments—Male Sprague-Dawley rats (∼16 weeks old) were given a single injection of streptozotocin (50 mg of STZ/kg of body weight) to induce hyperglycemia. After 2 weeks the animals were sacrificed, and the livers were harvested. Control animals received vehicle alone. For OGT overexpression studies, eight 9-week-old male balb/c mice (Taconic) were injected with 8.0 × 108 adeno-OGT or adeno-GFP virus particles. Gene expression was corrected by 36B4 and normalized to GFP. FoxO1 GlcNAcylation Is Elevated in Diabetes—Given that FoxO1 is a transcription factor that controls many aspects of metabolism and stress responses in the liver and O-GlcNAc functions as a nutrient sensor, we tested whether FoxO1 is O-GlcNAc modified in the liver. Fig. 1 shows that FLAG-tagged FoxO1 expressed in Fao rat hepatoma cells is GlcNAcylated using the anti-O-GlcNAc antibody, CTD110.6, and the terminal GlcNAc-specific lectin, succinylated wheat germ agglutinin (Fig. 1A). Specificity was confirmed by GlcNAc competition and increased O-GlcNAc levels following treatment of the cells with the O-GlcNAcase inhibitor, PUGNAc. Endogenous FoxO1 immunoprecipitated from rat liver was shown to be O-GlcNAc modified by using a terminal GlcNAc-specific galactosyltransferase probe (Fig. 1B) (37Torres C.R. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3308-3317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We next asked whether GlcNAcylation of FoxO1 is dysregulated by hyperglycemia in an model for diabetes. Using an O-GlcNAc-specific antibody (CTD110.6), we found that liver FoxO1 from STZ-induced diabetic rats was more heavily GlcNAcylated (Fig. 2A and supplemental Fig. S1). The reduction in antibody reactivity by free GlcNAc further demonstrates antibody specificity. The donor sugar for GlcNAcylation is UDP-GlcNAc, a product of the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP). Elevated glucose can increase flux through the HBP resulting in increased UDP-GlcNAc (14Marshall S. Bacote V. Traxinger R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4706-4712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), upon which OGT activity is dependent (13Haltiwanger R.S. Holt G.D. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2563-2568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore measured UDP-GlcNAc levels in the control and STZ diabetic rat livers and found an increase in the sugar nucleotide (Fig. 2B; 55.5 ± 2.5 versus 88.6 ± 12.3 pmol/mg liver, p < 0.05 by Student's t test). These data suggest that the HBP may act as a nutrient sensor by regulating OGT activity toward transcription factors, such as FoxO1. The STZ diabetic rats also had elevated mRNA expression of the FoxO1 targets Pepck and G6pc, consistent with previous reports (Fig. 2C) (38Hidaka S. Yoshimatsu H. Kondou S. Tsuruta Y. Oka K. Noguchi H. Okamoto K. Sakino H. Teshima Y. Okeda T. Sakata T. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 509-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Additionally, we measured the GlcNAcylation of FoxO1a from high fat fed diabetic mice and found an increase similar to the STZ-induced diabetic rats (Fig. 2D).FIGURE 1FoxO1 is O-GlcNAcylated.

Fig. 3A shows that culturing Fao hepatocytes in increasing glucose concentrations resulted in a dose-dependent increase in O-GlcNAc levels on FLAG-FoxO1 as detected by the CTD110.6 antibody. Interestingly, the addition of 100 nm insulin for 1 h down-regulated O-GlcNAc specifically on FoxO1 but did not reduce total cellular O-GlcNAc levels (Fig. 3, A and B) or alter O-GlcNAcase activity (Fig. 3C). We next assayed the O-GlcNAc levels of the insulin-insensitive mutant FoxO1 (T24A,S256A,S319A, termed “3A”). The lack of AKT phosphorylation sites results in much higher O-GlcNAc levels (Fig. 4A). To further address the interplay between O-GlcNAc and O-phosphate, we employed in vitro OGT and AKT assays. In vitro GlcNAcylation of GST-FoxO1 had no effect on subsequent in vitro AKT phosphorylation at Ser256 (Fig. 4B). Additionally, in vitro AKT phosphorylation of GST-FoxO1 did not affect subsequent in vitro GlcNAcylation (Fig. 4C), suggesting that the sites are not directly reciprocal. To test whether GlcNAcylation and Phosphorylation are functionally reciprocal, we assayed wether high glucose or PUGNAc (the O-GlcNAcase inhibitor) alters FoxO localization. Fao cells with a basal AKT activity, despite serum starvation, have most of their FoxO1 localized in the cytoplasm. FoxO does not translocate to the nucleus upon the addition of 25 mm glucose or PUGNAc treatment, whereas 10 μm LY294002 (PI3K inhibitor) does cause translocation. Consistent with Fig. 3A, it appears that AKT-mediated phosphorylation is dominant to GlcNAcylation with regards to FoxO. Another GST-tagged FoxO isoform, FoxO3 (FKHRL1), was also an in vitro target of OGT (Fig. 2E). A truncated FoxO3 (amino acids 1–525) incorporated less O-GlcNAc, showing that some sites are found between amino acids 526 and 673. A mutant lacking three AKT phosphorylation sites (T32A,S253A,S315A, termed “TM”) of the truncated form labeled to the same extent as the truncation containing the hydroxyamino acids, consistent with the model that phosphorylation by AKT is not directly reciprocal with GlcNAcylation.FIGURE 4There is a complex interplay between phosphorylation and GlcNAcylation of FoxO1. A, the AKT-insensitive and constitutively nuclear FoxO1 mutant (T24A,S256A,S319A, called 3A) is hyper-GlcNAcylated in Fao cells. B, recombinant FoxO1 was in vitro GlcNAcylated then subsequently in vitro AKT labeled, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and blotted with anti-FoxO1 Ser(P)256, stripped, and then blotted with anti-O-GlcNAc antibodies (CTD110.6). Specificity of the Ser(P)256 antibody was confirmed by alkaline phosphatase treatment. C, recombinant FoxO1 was in vitro AKT-phosphorylated, then subsequently in vitro O-GlcNAc labeled, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and blotted with anti-O-GlcNAc antibodies (CTD110.6), stripped, and then blotted with anti-FoxO1 Ser(P)256 antibodies. Specificity of the Ser(P)256 antibody was confirmed by alkaline phosphatase treatment. In vitro AKT phosphorylation does not block in vitro OGT labeling of FoxO1. D, Fao cells were infected with adenovirus expressing FLAG-tagged FoxO1. 24 h after infection cells were serum-starved in RPMI + 0.5% bovine serum albumin for 4 h and then treated as indicated for an additional 16 h in RPMI + 0.5% bovine serum albumin. FoxO1 was visualized using anti-FoxO1 antibody. PUGNAc (an O-GlcNAcase inhibitor) or 25 mm glucose did not result increased nuclear translocation of FoxO1 under conditions tested. E, the FoxO3 isoform is an in vitro substrate for OGT. [3H]UDP-GlcNAc incorporation was detected by autoradiography following Coomassie G250 staining. The truncated (amino acids 1–525) form incorporated significantly less label, indicating a significant number of sites are in the C-terminal region. The mutant FoxO3 lacking AKT phosphorylation sites (T24A,S215A,S316A, or “triple mutant” or TM) incorporates [3H]UDP-GlcNAc similar to the truncated form, indicating that AKT phosphorylation sites are not significantly in vitro O-GlcNAc labeled.

https://openalex.org/W2059441862,"The three-dimensional structures of haemoglobin and scores of other haem-containing proteins have been determined and the biosynthesis of haem has been thoroughly studied. But little is known about what happens to haems within the cell. The roundworm C. elegans can help fill this gap: it is a haem auxotroph, which means that although it needs haem for its haemoproteins, it can't synthesize it so scavenges its supplies from its surroundings. Exploiting the worm's well defined genetics and with no endogenous haem to complicate matters, Rajagopal et al. identified HRG-1 and HRG-4, previously unknown transmembrane proteins, as essential to haem utilization. These proteins are broadly conserved in animals and in humans: for instance, zebrafish with lowered levels of HRG-1 show anaemia, and severe depletion of HRG-1 causes congenital malformations as other haem proteins crucial for development are also affected. The discovery of this haem transport mechanism may provide insights into human disorders — as well as possible drug targets for new anthelmintics to fight worm infestations. Caenorhabditis elegans (which haeme auxotrophs), are used to identify the proteins involved in haeme homeostasis. It is shown that the proteins of HRG-1 and its paralogue HRG-4 are essential for haeme homeostasis, as they are novel transmembrane proteins residing in an intracellular department. Transient knockdown of hrg-1 in zebrafish led to hydrocephalus, yolk tube abnormalities, and defects in erythropoesis. The human and worm HRG proteins co-localize, and bind and transport haeme, showing there is evolutionary conservation of its function. Haems are metalloporphyrins that serve as prosthetic groups for various biological processes including respiration, gas sensing, xenobiotic detoxification, cell differentiation, circadian clock control, metabolic reprogramming and microRNA processing1,2,3,4. With a few exceptions, haem is synthesized by a multistep biosynthetic pathway comprising defined intermediates that are highly conserved throughout evolution5. Despite our extensive knowledge of haem biosynthesis and degradation, the cellular pathways and molecules that mediate intracellular haem trafficking are unknown. The experimental setback in identifying haem trafficking pathways has been the inability to dissociate the highly regulated cellular synthesis and degradation of haem from intracellular trafficking events6. Caenorhabditis elegans and related helminths are natural haem auxotrophs that acquire environmental haem for incorporation into haemoproteins, which have vertebrate orthologues7. Here we show, by exploiting this auxotrophy to identify HRG-1 proteins in C. elegans, that these proteins are essential for haem homeostasis and normal development in worms and vertebrates. Depletion of hrg-1, or its paralogue hrg-4, in worms results in the disruption of organismal haem sensing and an abnormal response to haem analogues. HRG-1 and HRG-4 are previously unknown transmembrane proteins, which reside in distinct intracellular compartments. Transient knockdown of hrg-1 in zebrafish leads to hydrocephalus, yolk tube malformations and, most strikingly, profound defects in erythropoiesis—phenotypes that are fully rescued by worm HRG-1. Human and worm proteins localize together, and bind and transport haem, thus establishing an evolutionarily conserved function for HRG-1. These findings reveal conserved pathways for cellular haem trafficking in animals that define the model for eukaryotic haem transport. Thus, uncovering the mechanisms of haem transport in C. elegans may provide insights into human disorders of haem metabolism and reveal new drug targets for developing anthelminthics to combat worm infestations."
https://openalex.org/W2087177706,"Chromatin influences gene expression by restricting access of DNA binding proteins to their cognate sites in the genome. Large-scale characterization of nucleosome positioning in Saccharomyces cerevisiae has revealed a stereotyped promoter organization in which a nucleosome-free region (NFR) is present within several hundred base pairs upstream of the translation start site. Many transcription factors bind within NFRs and nucleate chromatin remodelling events which then expose other cis-regulatory elements. However, it is not clear how transcription-factor binding and chromatin influence quantitative attributes of gene expression. Here we show that nucleosomes function largely to decouple the threshold of induction from dynamic range. With a series of variants of one promoter, we establish that the affinity of exposed binding sites is a primary determinant of the level of physiological stimulus necessary for substantial gene activation, and sites located within nucleosomal regions serve to scale expression once chromatin is remodelled. Furthermore, we find that the S. cerevisiae phosphate response (PHO) pathway exploits these promoter designs to tailor gene expression to different environmental phosphate levels. Our results suggest that the interplay of chromatin and binding-site affinity provides a mechanism for fine-tuning responses to the same cellular state. Moreover, these findings may be a starting point for more detailed models of eukaryotic transcriptional control."
https://openalex.org/W2089040449,"We evaluated currents induced by expression of human homologs of Orai together with STIM1 in human embryonic kidney cells. When co-expressed with STIM1, Orai1 induced a large inwardly rectifying Ca(2+)-selective current with Ca(2+)-induced slow inactivation. A point mutation of Orai1 (E106D) altered the ion selectivity of the induced Ca(2+) release-activated Ca(2+) (CRAC)-like current while retaining an inwardly rectifying I-V characteristic. Expression of the C-terminal portion of STIM1 with Orai1 was sufficient to generate CRAC current without store depletion. 2-APB activated a large relatively nonselective current in STIM1 and Orai3 co-expressing cells. 2-APB also induced Ca(2+) influx in Orai3-expressing cells without store depletion or co-expression of STIM1. The Orai3 current induced by 2-APB exhibited outward rectification and an inward component representing a mixed calcium and monovalent current. A pore mutant of Orai3 inhibited store-operated Ca(2+) entry and did not carry significant current in response to either store depletion or addition of 2-APB. Analysis of a series of Orai1-3 chimeras revealed the structural determinant responsible for 2-APB-induced current within the sequence from the second to third transmembrane segment of Orai3. The Orai3 current induced by 2-APB may reflect a store-independent mode of CRAC channel activation that opens a relatively nonselective cation pore."

https://openalex.org/W1977158079,"Stem cells maintain themselves over the life-time of an organism by their ability to self-renew. Multipotent progenitor cells are like stem cells in their ability to form many kinds of differentiated cells, but they do not self-renew and have a limited lifespan. Gene knock-out experiments in mice now show that by deleting just three genes, multipotent progenitor cells can be converted into long-term renewing cells. The normal role of the genes — p16Ink4a , p19Arf , and Tp53 — is to prevent progenitors from self-renewing. They are involved in pathways commonly repressed in cancer, pointing to a possible mechanism for tumorigenic mutation in progenitor cells. Multipotent progenitor cells are like stem cells in their ability to form many kinds of differentiated cells, but they are not able to self renew and thus have a limited lifespan. This paper reports that by mutating only three genes, it is possible to convert multipotent progenitor cells into long-term renewing cells. It is shown that these three genes normally prevent progenitors from self renewing, and suggest a mechanism by which mutations in progenitor cells could cause cancer. Haematopoiesis is maintained by a hierarchical system where haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) give rise to multipotent progenitors, which in turn differentiate into all types of mature blood cells1. HSCs maintain themselves for the lifetime of the organism because of their ability to self-renew. However, multipotent progenitors lack the ability to self-renew, therefore their mitotic capacity and expansion potential are limited and they are destined to eventually stop proliferating after a finite number of cell divisions1,2. The molecular mechanisms that limit the proliferation capacity of multipotent progenitors and other more mature progenitors are not fully understood2,3. Here we show that bone marrow cells from mice deficient in three genes genetically downstream of Bmi1—p16Ink4a , p19Arf and Trp53 (triple mutant mice; p16Ink4a and p19Arf are alternative reading frames of the same gene (also called Cdkn2a) that encode different proteins)—have an approximately 10-fold increase in cells able to reconstitute the blood long term. This increase is associated with the acquisition of long-term reconstitution capacity by cells of the phenotype c-kit+Sca-1+Flt3+CD150-CD48-Lin-, which defines multipotent progenitors in wild-type mice4,5,6. The pattern of triple mutant multipotent progenitor response to growth factors resembles that of wild-type multipotent progenitors but not wild-type HSCs. These results demonstrate that p16Ink4a/p19Arf and Trp53 have a central role in limiting the expansion potential of multipotent progenitors. These pathways are commonly repressed in cancer, suggesting a mechanism by which early progenitor cells could gain the ability to self-renew and become malignant with further oncogenic mutations."
https://openalex.org/W2154805808,"We describe a method that combines Cre-recombinase knockin mice and viral-mediated gene transfer to genetically label and functionally manipulate specific neuron types in the mouse brain. We engineered adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) that express GFP, dsRedExpress, or channelrhodopsin (ChR2) upon Cre/loxP recombination-mediated removal of a transcription-translation STOP cassette. Fluorescent labeling was sufficient to visualize neuronal structures with synaptic resolution in vivo, and ChR2 expression allowed light activation of neuronal spiking. The structural dynamics of a specific class of neocortical neuron, the parvalbumin-containing (Pv) fast-spiking GABAergic interneuron, was monitored over the course of a week. We found that although the majority of Pv axonal boutons were stable in young adults, bouton additions and subtractions on axonal shafts were readily observed at a rate of 10.10% and 9.47%, respectively, over 7 days. Our results indicate that Pv inhibitory circuits maintain the potential for structural re-wiring in post-adolescent cortex. With the generation of an increasing number of Cre knockin mice and because viral transfection can be delivered to defined brain regions at defined developmental stages, this strategy represents a general method to systematically visualize the structure and manipulate the function of different cell types in the mouse brain."
https://openalex.org/W1995743501,"The K cell is a specific sub-type of enteroendocrine cell located in the proximal small intestine that produces glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), xenin, and potentially other unknown hormones. Because GIP promotes weight gain and insulin resistance, reducing hormone release from K cells could lead to weight loss and increased insulin sensitivity. However, the consequences of coordinately reducing circulating levels of all K cell-derived hormones are unknown. To reduce the number of functioning K cells, regulatory elements from the rat GIP promoter/gene were used to express an attenuated diphtheria toxin A chain in transgenic mice. K cell number, GIP transcripts, and plasma GIP levels were profoundly reduced in the GIP/DT transgenic mice. Other enteroendocrine cell types were not ablated. Food intake, body weight, and blood glucose levels in response to insulin or intraperitoneal glucose were similar in control and GIP/DT mice fed standard chow. In contrast to single or double incretin receptor knock-out mice, the incretin response was absent in GIP/DT animals suggesting K cells produce GIP plus an additional incretin hormone. Following high fat feeding for 21-35 weeks, the incretin response was partially restored in GIP/DT mice. Transgenic versus wild-type mice demonstrated significantly reduced body weight (25%), plasma leptin levels (77%), and daily food intake (16%) plus enhanced energy expenditure (10%) and insulin sensitivity. Regardless of diet, long term glucose homeostasis was not grossly perturbed in the transgenic animals. In conclusion, studies using GIP/DT mice demonstrate an important role for K cells in the regulation of body weight and insulin sensitivity."
https://openalex.org/W2094076451,"Exercise provides protection against myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury. Understanding the mechanisms of this protection may lead to new interventions for the prevention and/or treatment of heart disease. Although presently these mechanisms are not well understood, reports suggest that manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) and calpain may be critical mediators of this protection. We hypothesized that an exercise-induced increase in MnSOD would provide cardioprotection by attenuating IR-induced oxidative modification to critical Ca(2+)-handling proteins, thereby decreasing calpain-mediated cleavage of these and other proteins attenuating cardiomyocyte death. After IR, myocardial apoptosis and infarct size were significantly reduced in hearts of exercised animals compared with sedentary controls. In addition, exercise prevented IR-induced calpain activation as well as the oxidative modification and calpain-mediated degradation of myocardial Ca(2+)-handling proteins (L-type Ca(2+) channels, phospholamban, and sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase). Further, IR-induced activation of proapoptotic proteins was attenuated in exercised animals. Importantly, prevention of the exercise-induced increase in MnSOD activity via antisense oligonucleotides greatly attenuated the cardioprotection conferred by exercise. These results suggest that MnSOD provides cardioprotection by attenuating IR-induced oxidation and calpain-mediated degradation of myocardial Ca(2+)-handling proteins, thereby preventing myocardial apoptosis and necrosis."
https://openalex.org/W2014674316,"B23 (NPM/nucleophosmin) is a multifunctional nucleolar protein and a member of the nucleoplasmin superfamily of acidic histone chaperones. B23 is essential for normal embryonic development and plays an important role in genomic stability, ribosome biogenesis, and anti-apoptotic signaling. Altered protein expression or genomic mutation of B23 is encountered in many different forms of cancer. Although described as multifunctional, a genuine molecular function of B23 is not fully understood. Here we show that B23 is associated with a protein complex consisting of ribosomal proteins and ribosome-associated RNA helicases. A novel, RNA-independent interaction between ribosomal protein S9 (RPS9) and B23 was further investigated. We found that S9 binding requires an intact B23 oligomerization domain. Depletion of S9 by small interfering RNA resulted in decreased protein synthesis and G(1) cell cycle arrest, in association with induction of p53 target genes. We determined that S9 is a short-lived protein in the absence of ribosome biogenesis, and proteasomal inhibition significantly increased S9 protein level. Overexpression of B23 facilitated nucleolar storage of S9, whereas knockdown of B23 led to diminished levels of nucleolar S9. Our results suggest that B23 selectively stores, and protects ribosomal protein S9 in nucleoli and therefore could facilitate ribosome biogenesis."

Due to the facility of manipulating the yeast genome, many aspects and components of ERAD have been discovered in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (2Brodsky J.L. Biochem. J. 2007; 404: 353-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 3Meusser B. Hirsch C. Jarosch E. Sommer T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 766-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar, 4Molinari M. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2007; 3: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Yos9p is no exception. It was initially reported that deletion of Yos9p from the yeast ER selectively inhibits degradation of glycosylated ERAD substrates (5Buschhorn B.A. Kostova Z. Medicherla B. Wolf D.H. FEBS Lett. 2004; 577: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Subsequent work revealed that Yos9p is required for disposal of substrates with luminal folding defects, whereas it is dispensable for disposal of proteins with defects in the transmembrane and cytosolic domains (6Carvalho P.

Studies on the involvement of the mammalian ortholog OS-9 in ERAD have been hampered by data showing that OS-9 is a cytosolic protein (11Litovchick L. Friedmann E. Shaltiel S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34413-34423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This study was followed by a series of publications in which experimental design and interpretation of the data were based on the assumption that OS-9 is a cytosolic protein (12Baek J.H. Mahon P.C.

Our analysis shows that OS-9 is a N-glycosylated protein expressed in two splice variants in the ER lumen. Transcription of both OS-9 variants is enhanced upon activation of the Ire1/Xbp1 pathway in cells exposed to acute ER stress. OS-9 variants do not associate with folding-competent proteins, but form non-covalent complexes with misfolded ones. OS-9 association prevents secretion from the ER of misfolded NHK conformers and facilitates NHK disposal. OS-9 variants play a crucial role in maintaining the tightness of retention-based ER quality control and in promoting disposal of misfolded proteins from the mammalian ER. Antibodies, Expression Plasmids, and OS-9 Mutagenesis—The pcDNA3 plasmids encoding mouse OS-9.1 and OS-9.2 were a kind gift of L. Litovchick. The nucleotide sequences of all plasmids used in this study were verified on both strands. Mutagenesis of the OS-9 MRH domain was carried out using a PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis Quick Gene® kit (Stratagene). The following primers were used: 5′-CTCAACGGGAAGCCCGCAGAAGCTGAAGTTCG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CGAACTTCAGCTTCTGCGGGCTTCCCGTTGAG-3′ (antisense). The anti-OS-9 used for immunoprecipitation, immunoblots, and immunofluorescence was from Novus Biologicals (BC100-519). The anti-protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI) for immunofluorescence was a commercial monoclonal antibody from ABR (MA3-018). The anti-EDEM1 for immunoprecipitation was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (C-19, sc-27391). The monoclonal anti-amyloid precursor protein (15Paganetti P. Calanca V. Galli C. Stefani M. Molinari M. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 863-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) was a kind gift of P. Paganetti. For immunoblots, all primary antibodies were used at 1:1000–1:2000 dilutions. Secondary antibodies for immunoblots were horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies (1:5000). The ECL Plus detection system was from Amersham Biosciences. DNA preparations were obtained using commercially available purification kits (Sigma). Secondary antibodies for immunofluorescence (Alexa 488-labeled goat anti-rabbit, Alexa 594-labeled goat anti-mouse) were used at 1:100 dilution. Cell Lines, Transient Transfections, Metabolic Labeling, Analysis of Data—All cell lines used in the study were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Xbp1–/– cells were a kind gift of L. Glimcher. Cells at 80–90% confluence in a 6-cm tissue culture plate were transfected with the expression plasmid of interest (4 μg for single transfections, 6 μg of total DNA for transfections with two plasmids) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Experiments were performed 17 h after transfection. Metabolic labeling is described in Ref. 16Molinari M. Helenius A. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 348: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar. Gels were exposed to Bio-Max (Kodak) films and scanned with an Agfa scanner. Relevant bands were quantified by ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). Subcellular Fractionation and Separation of Membrane Versus Luminal Content—35S-Labeled cells were extensively washed in a 10-cm dish with isotonic buffer. They were detached with a rubber policeman and resuspended in 800 μlof homogenization buffer (10 mm triethanolamine, 10 mm acetic acid, 250 mm sucrose, 20 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 1 mm EDTA and a mixture of protease inhibitors, pH 7.4). Cells were broken with 10 passages through a 25-gauge 1 needle. Postnuclear supernatants were subjected to ultracentrifugation (45 min, 200,000 × g in TLA 120.2) to separate endomembranes from the cytosol. The endomembrane-containing pellet was extensively washed, resuspended in 500 μl of 100 mm Na2CO3, and incubated for 25 min on ice for carbonate extraction. After an additional ultracentrifugation step (45 min, 200,000 × g), the supernatant was harvested (ER lumen in Fig. 1G). The endomembrane fraction (ER memb in Fig. 1G) was washed once with 100 mm Na2CO3 (35 min, 200,000 × g) and then resuspended in 800 μl of lysis buffer. Insoluble material was removed after 25 min on ice by 10 min centrifugation at 200,000 × g. The ER luminal content and the endomembrane fraction were subjected to immunoprecipitation against calreticulin, calnexin, OS-9, and EDEM1.FIGURE 2Consequences of OS-9 up-regulation on secretion and degradation of NHK and on secretion of α1-antitrypsin.

Coverslips were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, and cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde. After 2 short washings with 10 mm Hepes serum-free medium, and two additional washings with phosphate-buffered saline, the antigen accessibility was improved by a 20-min incubation with 0.05% saponin, 10% goat serum, 10 mm Hepes, and 15 mm glycine. Images were viewed on a Nikon eclipse E-800 fluorescent microscope, captured by a Hamamatsu EM-CCD Digital camera C9100, and analyzed with the Open lab 3 software (Improvision, Inc., Lexington, MA). Semi-quantitative and Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reactions (RT-PCR)—Primers used for identification of OS-9 splice variants expressed in HEK293 cells were as follows: primers amplifying all 4 putative splice variants (Fig. 1B, left panel): CTTCCGTCAGACCGAGACC (forward), GGGCGGACAATTTTGATCT (reverse); primers amplifying only OS-9.1 and OS-9.4 (Fig. 1B, right): CTTCCGTCAGACCGAGACC (forward), CTGATTAGGGCCTCCGAGA (reverse). For analysis of variations in gene transcription upon ER stress, HEK293, wt, and Xbp1–/– mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) were plated in 6-cm dishes without (mock) or with tunicamycin (Tun, 2.5 μg/ml). After 12 h cells were lysed in TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and RNA was isolated according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Two μg of RNA were used for cDNA synthesis using SuperScriptII reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and oligo(dT) (Invitrogen). Semi-quantitative PCR was performed using Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) with transcript-specific primers using three different cycle numbers for each gene, all within the linear phase of template amplification. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed using the 7900HT Fast Real-time PCR System. The PCR were performed in a 10-μl Power SYBR Green PCR master mixture (Applied Biosystem), 5 μl of cDNA, 4 μlofddH2O, and 1 μl of primer mixture (0.5 μm final). The housekeeping gene β-actin was used as reference. Data were analyzed using the SDS 2.2.2 software. The primers were as follows (m, mouse; h, human): m-β-Actin, CTTTCTGGGTATGGAATCCT (forward), GGAGCAATGATCTTGATCTT (reverse); h-β-Actin, CTTCCTGGGCATGGAGTCCT (forward), GGAGCAATGATCTTGATCTT (reverse); m/h-BiP, GAGTTCTTCAATGGCAAGGA (forward), CCAGTCAGATCAAATGTACCC (reverse); m-EDEM1, TGGAATTTGGGATTCTGAGC (forward), CTGCAGTCCAGGGAAGAAAG (reverse); h-EDEM1, AAGATTCCACCGTCCAAGTC (forward), GTATCATTGCTCCGGAGGTT (reverse); m/h-OS-9, GGAGGAGCTGAGTGAGATGC (forward), GTCTGGCTGTGGTAGCGTTT (reverse) m-Sel1L; CCTCGACCAGAGAGAAGCACC (forward), GCGGTCTCATAATCCACATCA (rev); m-Synoviolin, CGTGTGGACTTTATGGAACGC (forward), CGGGTCAGGATGCTGTGATAA (reverse). Lentiviral Transduction and Stable Cell Line Establishment—Vesicular stomatitis virus g pseudotyped lentiviral vectors were produced by transient transfection of 293FT cells (Invitrogen) with an HIV-1-based packaging vector, vesicular stomatitis virus g envelope vector, and transfer vector containing either the short hairpin for human OS-9 or Luciferase. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, viral supernatants were filtered through a 0.45-μm filter, and added to HEK293 cells. Transduced cells were selected with puromycin gradually, from 1 to 30 μg/ml over 2 weeks. OS-9 short hairpin RNA targeting sequence, targeting the 3′ untranslated region, is as follows: GCTGCCTACCTGGAGATTCAG. Two Splice Variants of OS-9 Are Expressed in Mammalian Cells—The OS-9 gene is composed of 15 exons (17Kimura Y. Nakazawa M. Tsuchiya N. Asakawa S. Shimizu N. Yamada M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 122: 1190-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Alternative splicing events that conform to the GT-AG rule could generate 4 variants of the protein. The full-length version of OS-9.1 comprises 667 amino acids in humans; OS-9.2, which lacks the entire exon 13 and is 55 residues shorter with a glutamate to glycine conversion in the splice region; OS-9.3, which lacks exon 13 and the final part of exon 11 and is 70 residues shorter; OS-9.4, which lacks the final part of exon 11 resulting in a 15-residues deletion (schematics in Fig. 1A and Ref. 18Kimura Y. Nakazawa M. Yamada M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 123: 876-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The expression of OS-9.1 and OS-9.2, two splice variants derived from a single transcript, has been shown in osteosarcoma cell lines (18Kimura Y. Nakazawa M. Yamada M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 123: 876-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To determine which splice variants are expressed in HEK293 cells, we amplified the total cellular cDNA pool with specific primers. Our analysis revealed expression of transcripts for OS-9.1 (Fig. 1B, amplification products of 461 in the left panel and 333 bp in the right panel) and OS-9.2 (Fig. 1B, amplification products of 296 bp in the left panel). Transcripts for variants 3 and 4 were not expressed (Fig. 1B, lack of amplification products of 416 and 251 bp in the left and 288 bp in the right panel, respectively). To confirm expression of OS-9.1 and OS-9.2 at the protein level, HEK293 cells were detergent-solubilized and the proteins contained in the postnuclear supernatant were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and probed with polyclonal antibodies raised against OS-9. The antibodies recognized two polypeptide bands (Fig. 1C, lane 1). The upper band co-migrated with ectopically expressed OS-9.1 (Fig. 1C, lane 2) and the lower with OS-9.2 (Fig. 1C, lane 3). Similar results were obtained with MEF, thus showing that mammalian-cultured cells contain two splice variants of OS-9: OS-9.1 and OS-9.2. OS-9 Is a N-Glycosylated Protein of the ER Lumen—Yos9p, the yeast ortholog of mammalian OS-9 has an amino-terminal signal sequence for protein targeting into the ER lumen and a COOH-terminal HDEL signal for ER retrieval. Consistent with intralumenal localization, Yos9p displays 4 N-linked glycans, a hallmark of proteins synthesized in the ER. The human ortholog OS-9 has been reported to be associated with the cytosolic face of the ER membrane (11Litovchick L. Friedmann E. Shaltiel S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34413-34423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Instead, our results clearly showed that OS-9 variants are soluble proteins in the ER. First, as for the yeast protein, the hidden Markov model used by SignalP (19Nielsen H. Krogh A. Press AAAI Menlo Park CA Glasgow J. Littlejohn T. Major F. Sixth International Conference on Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology. 1998: 122-130Google Scholar) shows that both the human and mouse OS-9 have a cleavable NH2-terminal signal sequence, a characteristic of proteins translocated into the ER (20Blobel G. Dobberstein B. J. Cell Biol. 1975; 67: 835-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (1810) Google Scholar). Second, endogenous and ectopically expressed OS-9.1 and OS-9.2 are N-glycosylated, a covalent modification of proteins translocated into the ER (21Hebert D.N. Molinari M. Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87: 1377-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar) that would not occur if OS-9 would face the cytosol as claimed in Ref. 11Litovchick L. Friedmann E. Shaltiel S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34413-34423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar. For the endogenous proteins, this was established by subjecting detergent lysates of HEK293 cells to mock or EndoH treatments. EndoH specifically removes N-linked oligosaccharides from ER proteins (22Rothman J.E. Urbani L.J. Brands R. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 248-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Cellular proteins from mock- and EndoH-treated detergent lysates were separated in SDS-PAGE, transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and probed with antibodies raised against endogenous OS-9 (eOS9) (Fig. 1D, lane 1 (Mock) and 2 (EndoH)). EndoH treatment reduced the apparent molecular mass of both OS-9 variants of about 4 kDa compared with untreated samples. The faster electrophoretic mobility is consistent with removal of 1 N-linked glycan from asparagine 177, which is the only acceptor site for oligosaccharides in the OS-9.1 and OS-9.2 sequences. N-Glycosylation was also confirmed for ectopically expressed OS-9 (rOS9). In this case, HEK293 cells were transfected with plasmids for expression of OS-9.1 (Fig. 1D, lanes 3 and 4) or OS-9.2 (lanes 5 and 6). Seventeen h post-transfection, cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine and -cysteine. Labeled OS-9.1 and OS-9.2 were immunoisolated with specific antibodies from detergent lysates and the immunocomplexes were mock-treated (lanes 3 and 5) or were incubated for 1 h with EndoH (lanes 4 and 6). EndoH treatment enhanced the electrophoretic mobility of the ectopically expressed proteins, thus confirming their glycosylated status (compare lane 3 with 4 in Fig. 1D for OS-9.1 and lane 5 with 6 for OS-9.2). Third, the electrophoretic mobility of both OS-9 variants is slower when the proteins are separated under reducing (R, Fig. 1E) rather than under non-reducing conditions. This shows that OS-9 cysteines are engaged in intramolecular disulfide bonds (23Braakman I. Hoover-Litty H. Wagner K.R. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), another hallmark of proteins translocated in the ER lumen. Fourth, immunofluorescence analysis in HEK293 cells revealed the co-localization of ectopically expressed OS-9 with PDI, a canonical ER marker (Fig. 1F). To determine whether OS-9 variants are membrane-bound or luminal proteins, HEK293 cells were metabolically labeled and extensively washed. Cells were broken with 10 passages through a 25-gauge 1 needle. Postnuclear supernatants were subjected to ultracentrifugation to separate endomembranes from the cytosol. The endomembrane pellet was washed twice to remove cytosolic contaminants and was subsequently extracted with carbonate to separate the luminal content (Fig. 1G, lanes 1–4) from the membrane-bound proteins (lanes 5–8). Calreticulin and EDEM1 served as luminal markers (24Olivari S. Galli C. Alanen H. Ruddock L. Molinari M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2424-2428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 25Molinari M. Calanca V. Galli C. Lucca P. Paganetti P. Science. 2003; 299: 1397-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Consistently, they mostly partitioned in the luminal fraction (Fig. 1G, lanes 1 and 4, respectively) and were only weakly detected in the membrane fraction (lanes 5 and 8). On the other hand, the ER membrane marker calnexin partitioned in the membrane fraction (lane 6) and was not found in the luminal fraction (lane 2). The distribution of OS-9 variants reflected the distribution of the luminal markers calreticulin and EDEM1 as shown by their enrichment in the luminal fraction (Fig. 1G, lane 3). OS-9 Is an Ire1/Xbp1-inducible ER Stress-regulated Gene—We next determined whether OS-9 transcription is induced in cells experiencing acute ER stress. RT-PCR analysis in HEK293 and MEF cells revealed that the basal level of OS-9.1 transcripts is substantially lower than that of OS-9.2 transcripts (Fig. 1H, lane 1 for HEK and lane 3 for MEF). This confirms data showing that transcripts for isoform 2 are the most abundantly expressed in human sarcomas (18Kimura Y. Nakazawa M. Yamada M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 123: 876-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Cell exposure to tunicamycin, a potent ER-stress inducer, enhanced the expression of OS-9 transcripts without affecting the splicing reaction generating OS-9.2. OS-9.2 remained the most abundant splice variant amplified in both HEK293 (Fig. 1H, lane 2) and MEF (Fig. 1H, lane 4) subjected to acute ER stress. As positive controls, tunicamycin also enhanced expression of EDEM1, BiP, Synoviolin, and Sel1L transcripts (Fig. 1H). Deletion of the Ire1-activated transcription factor Xbp1 did not prevent induction of BiP and Sel1L, two genes regulated by the ATF6 ER-stress pathway (26Yoshida H. Matsui T. Hosokawa N. Kaufman R.J. Nagata K. Mori K. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 265-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar), but substantially inhibited induction of EDEM1, OS-9, and Synoviolin transcription (Fig. 1H, lanes 5–6 and also refer to Ref. 27Kaneko M. Yasui S. Niinuma Y. Arai K. Omura T. Okuma Y. Nomura Y. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 5355-5360Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar for Xbp1-regulation of Synoviolin). These data were confirmed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis (Fig. 1I). These results are intriguing because in S. cerevisiae Yos9p forms a functional complex with Hrd1p and Hrd3p, the orthologs of Synoviolin and Sel1L, respectively. It seems therefore that components of the same functional complex are regulated by distinct stress-induced pathways. Altogether, Fig. 1 shows that OS-9 variants are soluble, highly oxidized, N-glycosylated proteins of the ER lumen, which are transcriptionally induced upon activation of the Ire1/Xbp1 ER-stress pathway. OS-9 Variants Associate with NHK and Inhibit Secretion of Extensively Misfolded Conformers from the ER Lumen—Human α1-antitrypsin is a serine protease inhibitor secreted from hepatocytes (28Carlson J.A. Rogers B.B. Sifers R.N. Hawkins H.K. Finegold M.J. Woo S.L. J. Clin. Investig. 1988; 82: 26-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The NHK variant (29Sifers R.N. Brashears-Macatee S. Kidd V.J. Muensch H. Woo S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7330-7335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is a truncated, folding defective form of α1-antitrypsin (30Liu Y. Choudhury P. Cabral C.M. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5861-5867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). We report that in transiently transfected mammalian cultured cells, only about 75% of ectopically expressed NHK becomes an ERAD substrate. About 25% of the newly synthesized NHK escapes ER retention and is secreted from cells as aberrant disulfide-bonded dimers (see below and supplemental Fig. S1). To determine the function of OS-9 variants in the ER lumen, HEK293 cells expressing NHK were mock transfected (Fig. 2, lanes 1–3), and transfected with OS-9.1 (lanes 4–6) or OS-9.2 (lanes 7–9). The proteins were metabolically labeled for 10 min with [35S]methionine and cysteine. After various chase times with unlabeled amino acids, the labeled intracellular NHK (Fig. 2, A and B) and the labeled secreted NHK escaping retention-based ER quality control (Fig. 2, C and D) were immunoisolated with specific antibodies from cell lysates and from the culture media, respectively. Quantifications were performed by band densitometry in reducing SDS-PAGE. These experiments revealed first that OS-9.1 and OS-9.2 associate with NHK. In fact, they did co-precipitate with the ERAD substrate (arrows in Fig. 2A, lanes 4–9). Second, that co-expression of both OS-9 variants similarly delayed disappearance of labeled NHK from the ER lumen (Fig. 2, A and B). In fact, after a 120-min chase, 30% of the labeled NHK was still retained in cells with physiologic OS-9 content (Fig. 2, A, lane 3, and B) versus 55% in cells expressing high levels of OS-9.1 (lane 6) or OS-9.2 (lane 9). The intracellular persistence of labeled NHK did not result from substantial inhibition of NHK disposal in response to ectopic OS-9 expression. Rather, it resulted from the efficient inhibition of secretion of non-native NHK. In fact, whereas roughly 25% of th"

For example, the opportunistic protist Toxoplasma gondii converts to latent cysts (bradyzoites) responsible for recrudescence of disease. We report that Toxoplasma eukaryotic initiation factor-2α (TgIF2α) is phosphorylated during stress and establish that protozoan parasites utilize translation control to modulate gene expression during development. Importantly, TgIF2α remains phosphorylated in bradyzoites, explaining how these cells maintain their quiescent state. Furthermore, we have characterized novel eIF2 kinases; one in the endoplasmic reticulum and a likely regulator of the unfolded protein response (TgIF2K-A) and another that is a probable responder to cytoplasmic stresses (TgIF2K-B). Significantly, our data suggest that 1) the regulation of protein translation through eIF2 kinases is associated with development, 2) eIF2α phosphorylation is employed by cells to maintain a latent state, and 3) endoplasmic reticulum and cytoplasmic stress responses evolved in eukaryotic cells before the early diverging Apicomplexa. Given its importance to pathogenesis, eIF2 kinase-mediated stress responses may provide opportunities for novel therapeutics.

Furthermore, we have characterized novel eIF2 kinases; one in the endoplasmic reticulum and a likely regulator of the unfolded protein response (TgIF2K-A) and another that is a probable responder to cytoplasmic stresses (TgIF2K-B). Significantly, our data suggest that 1) the regulation of protein translation through eIF2 kinases is associated with development, 2) eIF2α phosphorylation is employed by cells to maintain a latent state, and 3) endoplasmic reticulum and cytoplasmic stress responses evolved in eukaryotic cells before the early diverging Apicomplexa. Given its importance to pathogenesis, eIF2 kinase-mediated stress responses may provide opportunities for novel therapeutics. A well characterized mechanism by which eukaryotic cells respond to environmental stress involves phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor-2 (eIF2) 3The abbreviations used are: eIF2, eukaryotic initiation factor-2; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; UPR, unfolded protein response; TgIF2α, Toxoplasma eukaryotic initiation factor-2α; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GFP, green fluorescent protein; IFA, immunofluorescence assays; Sal, salubrinal. 3The abbreviations used are: eIF2, eukaryotic initiation factor-2; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; UPR, unfolded protein response; TgIF2α, Toxoplasma eukaryotic initiation factor-2α; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GFP, green fluorescent protein; IFA, immunofluorescence assays; Sal, salubrinal.

The eIF2 combined with GTP delivers Met−tRNAiMet to the translational machinery during initiation of protein synthesis. In mammalian cells, four eIF2 kinases have been described that are each activated by unique stress arrangements. For example, in response to accumulation of malfolded protein in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (so-called ER stress), PEK/Perk (EIF2KA3) phosphorylates the α subunit of eIF2 at serine 51, causing this translation factor to become an inhibitor of its own guanine nucleotide exchange factor, eIF2B. The resulting repression in general translation prevents further synthesis of secretory proteins that would further overload the ER and allows cells sufficient time to trigger the unfolded protein response (UPR) (2Wek R.C. Cavener D.R. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2007; 9: 2357-2371Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The UPR is a program of mRNA expression involving genes that function in the assembly and transport of secretory proteins (4Travers K.J. Patil C.K. Wodicka L. Lockhart D.J. Weissman J.S. Walter P. Cell. 2000; 101: 249-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1589) Google Scholar). In addition to ER stress, three other eIF2 kinases have been described that recognize different forms of cytoplasmic stress in mammalian cells. These include: GCN2 (EIF2KA4), which responds to nutrient deprivation and is well conserved among eukaryotes (3Wek R.C. Jiang H.Y. Anthony T.G. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2006; 34: 7-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar, 5Hinnebusch A.G. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 59: 407-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar), HRI (EIF2KA1), which is reported to be activated by heme deficiency, oxidative stress induced by arsenite treatment, and heat shock (6Chen J.J. Blood. 2007; 109: 2693-2699Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 7Lu L. Han A.P. Chen J.-J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7971-7980Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), and PKR (EIF2KA2), which is involved in the antiviral defenses (8Sadler A.J. Williams B.R. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2007; 316: 253-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 9Barber G.N. Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 563-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Very little research has been performed on eIF2 kinase and related stress response pathways in early-diverging eukaryotes, including pathogenic eukaryotes. However, viability, pathogenesis, and transmission of many parasites hinges on their ability to recognize and respond to cellular stress. Stress often serves as a signal for parasites to develop into a life cycle stage that is better suited to its current environment or into a dormant stage that allows microbial persistence. For example, in Toxoplasma gondii, a protozoan parasite in the phylum Apicomplexa, the stress response has clinical relevance as it underlies a development transition from the proliferating tachyzoites to encysted bradyzoites, which evade immunity and known drug treatments. T. gondii, transmissible through contaminated food or water, can cause congenital birth defects and serious complications in immunocompromised persons (10Black M.W. Boothroyd J.C. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 607-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). The latent bradyzoites can reconvert into destructive tachyzoites if immunity wanes. Current drugs do not target cyst development or maintenance and have toxic side effects, hence creating an urgent need for new therapeutics. T. gondii differentiation is poorly understood, but it is established that a variety of cellular stresses can initiate this process in vitro, including alkaline pH, thermal stress, exposure to sodium arsenite, and arginine starvation (11Weiss L.M. Kim K. Front. Biosci. 2000; 5: 391-405Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Soete M. Camus D. Dubremetz J.F. Exp. Parasitol. 1994; 78: 361-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 13Fox B.A. Bzik D.J. Nature. 2002; 415: 926-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Thus, we have been investigating the role of the eIF2 kinase-mediated pathway in stress-induced differentiation of T. gondii. We previously characterized eIF2α in T. gondii (TgIF2α) and showed that phosphorylation of this translation factor at the analogous serine 51 residue occurs in response to heat shock or alkaline pH stress (14Sullivan Jr., W.J. Narasimhan J. Bhatti M.M. Wek R.C. Biochem. J. 2004; 380: 523-531Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, we reported a novel member of the eIF2 kinase family in T. gondii, named TgIF2K-A, that phosphorylated eIF2α and regulated translation control in the yeast model (14Sullivan Jr., W.J. Narasimhan J. Bhatti M.M. Wek R.C. Biochem. J. 2004; 380: 523-531Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These data suggested that key features of eIF2 kinase pathway are conserved in apicomplexan parasites and translational control may function in T. gondii. In this study we show that TgIF2α phosphorylation and translational control occur in response to both ER and cytoplasmic stresses and persist during the quiescent bradyzoite stage of the life cycle. We have determined that TgIF2K-A localizes to the ER and shares regulatory features with PEK/Perk in mammalian cells. A novel T. gondii eIF2 kinase that we describe here, TgIF2K-B, is found in the cytosol. TgIF2K-A and –B, thus, allow T. gondii to respond to both ER and cytoplasmic stress arrangements, respectively. Importantly, our data suggest that translational control elicited by eIF2 kinase-mediated stress responses coincides with cyst development, microbial persistence, and latent infection. The conservation of these pathways in Apicomplexa suggests that eukaryotic cells developed these adaptation strategies very early in eukaryotic cell evolution. Parasite Lines and Culture Methods—T. gondii tachyzoites (RH and ME49 strains) were cultivated in confluent monolayers of human foreskin fibroblast cells. Host cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and with no antibiotics. Host cells infected with RH strain were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1% fetal bovine serum (10% for ME49), free of antibiotics, in a humidified 37 °C incubator in 5% CO2. To induce differentiation using alkaline pH, ME49 parasites were incubated in RPMI 1640 media (pH 8.1) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum. Fresh medium was applied daily for 8 days, at which point the monolayer containing cysts was harvested. To induce differentiation using sodium nitroprusside (SNP), a final concentration of 50 μm SNP was added daily to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; culture media was replaced at day 4, and cysts were harvested at day 8. Cultures with cysts were scraped and passed through a 25-gauge syringe needle on ice followed by centrifugation at 145 × g to remove debris. After 2 washes in ice-cold PBS, the bradyzoites were processed for immunoblotting as described below. In some experiments 1 μm salubrinal (Calbiochem) was added to parasite cultures daily for 4 days. The GFP-HDEL parasite clone (made in RH strain) was generously provided by Dr. Kristin Hager (Notre Dame) (15Hager K.M. Striepen B. Tilney L.G. Roos D.S. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2631-2638Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In experiments in which parasites were radiolabeled, equal numbers of extracellular tachyzoites were resuspended in labeling media, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without l-methionine, l-cysteine, l-glutamine, or sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen #21013-024) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 1 mm l-glutamine, 0.5 mm sodium pyruvate. Thirty minutes into the treatment with 5 μm arsenite, 2.5 μm A23187, or vehicle, 0.145 mCi of Express Protein Label Mix containing [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added to the sample and incubated for the remainder of the stress period. Samples were washed twice in PBS, and a portion was counted to determine similar uptake of the radiolabel. Parasites were resuspended in lysis buffer and sonicated. Equal amounts of total protein from each lysate preparation were separated by SDS/PAGE, and radiolabeled proteins were visualized by autoradiography. Incorporation of [35S]Met/Cys radiolabel into proteins was determined by trichloroacetic acid precipitation followed by scintillation counting of the insoluble pellet. Antibodies—Antibodies were generated against a phosphorylated polypeptide CMSDERLpSKRRFRS representing TgIF2α phosphorylated at the serine 71 regulatory site. To measure total levels of TgIF2α, polyclonal rabbit antisera was raised against purified recombinant TgIF2α as previously reported (14Sullivan Jr., W.J. Narasimhan J. Bhatti M.M. Wek R.C. Biochem. J. 2004; 380: 523-531Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Polyclonal antisera to TgIF2K-A was raised in rabbits using an antigen consisting of recombinant TgIF2K-A containing the carboxyl-terminal 194 amino acid residues. Recombinant TgIF2K-A was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified using an amino-terminal polyhistidine fusion tag in combination with nickel chromatography. Anti-TgIF2K-A was affinity-purified using purified recombinant antigen coupled to an Affi-gel 15 (Bio-Rad) column. TgIF2K-B antibodies were prepared against an amino-terminal polyhistidine-tagged recombinant protein containing the carboxyl-terminal 217 residues of TgIF2K-B and affinity-purified as described above. Antibody cross-reactive to the T. gondii homologue of BiP (15Hager K.M. Striepen B. Tilney L.G. Roos D.S. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2631-2638Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. Jay Bangs (University of Wisconsin-Madison, WI). Stress Tests—Filter-purified tachyzoites were treated for the designated times in various concentrations of sodium arsenite, calcium ionophore A23187, or tunicamycin (all from Sigma). To examine the effects of a specified stress on TgIF2α phosphorylation, equal numbers of filter-purified tachyzoites were incubated in media with the stress agent or subjected to a mock treatment. After treatment, parasites were collected by centrifugation and lysed in solution A (50 mm Tris (pH 7.9), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with phosphatase inhibitor (50 mm NaF) and protease inhibitors (100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.15 μm aprotinin, 1 μm pepstatin, and 1 μm leupeptin). Proteins were quantitated using the Bradford assay, and equal amounts were resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by protein transfer to nitrocellulose membranes and immunoblotting as described (14Sullivan Jr., W.J. Narasimhan J. Bhatti M.M. Wek R.C. Biochem. J. 2004; 380: 523-531Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Results are presented as means ± S.E. that were derived from three independent experiments. The Student's t test was used to determine the statistical significance. Sucrose Gradient Centrifugation—Cycloheximide (50 μg/ml) was added to extracellular tachyzoites 10 min before harvest. Parasites were collected by centrifugation, washed twice in PBS containing 50 μg/ml cycloheximide, and resuspended in Breaking Solution (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton, 50 μg/ml cycloheximide, 0.04 units/μl RNase Out, and 250 μg/ml heparin) in the presence of protease inhibitors listed above. Lysis was achieved by briefly sonicating the resuspended parasites 3× on ice. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min. Supernatant samples containing 3–5 A254 units were loaded onto a 15–45% sucrose gradient in Breaking Solution without RNase Out, heparin, or Triton as described previously (16Ramirez M. Wek R.C. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3027-3036Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Ultracentrifugation was performed using Beckman rotor SW41 at 40,000 rpm for 2 h. Gradients were fractionated using an ISCO UA-6 absorbance monitor set at 254 nm, and 0.6-ml aliquots were collected. Immunofluorescence Assays (IFA)—T. gondii tachyzoites engineered to express GFP-HDEL were allowed to infect confluent monolayers of human foreskin fibroblasts grown on glass coverslips. IFAs was carried out as described in Bhatti et al. (17Bhatti M.M. Sullivan Jr., W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5902-5908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) using a 1:100 dilution of affinity-purified anti-TgIF2K-A or 1:100 dilution of anti-GFP (Abcam, ab1218-100) as primary antibody. Secondary antibody consisted of anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 or anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 594 (Invitrogen), respectively. Extracellular tachyzoites were examined after coating coverslips with 50 μl of 0.1 mg/ml poly-l-lysine. Parasites in 3% paraformaldehyde and PBS were inoculated onto the coated coverslips and allowed to sit at room temperature for 15 min before being processed for IFA as outlined above. For IFAs performed on both intracellular and extracellular parasites, 0.3 μm 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole was applied for 5 min at room temperature in the dark as a co-stain. To visualize bradyzoite cyst wall antigens, a 1:100 dilution of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated Dolichos biflorus agglutinin (Vector Laboratories) was applied. In Vitro eIF2 Kinase Assays—TgIF2K-A or TgIF2K-B were immunoprecipitated from T. gondii protein lysates prepared in solution A (see above) supplemented with proteasome inhibitors using antibody specific to each eIF2 kinase. The antibody-bound eIF2 kinases were collected by using protein A-Sepharose and eIF2 kinase assays were carried out as described (14Sullivan Jr., W.J. Narasimhan J. Bhatti M.M. Wek R.C. Biochem. J. 2004; 380: 523-531Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in a final concentration of 50 μm and kinase buffer solution (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) supplemented with protease inhibitors. 1.3 μm purified recombinant yeast eIF2α was included in a 20-μl reaction mixture. Radiolabeled proteins were separated by SDS/PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. Immunoelectron Microscopy—Preparations of Toxoplasma-infected fibroblasts were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences) in 0.25 m HEPES (pH 7.4) for 1 h at room temperature, then in 8% paraformaldehyde in the same buffer overnight at 4 °C. They were then infiltrated, frozen, and sectioned as previously described (18Folsch H. Pypaert M. Schu P. Mellman I. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 595-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The sections were immunolabeled with rabbit anti-TgIF2K-A or -B antibodies in PBS, 1% fish skin gelatin, then with mouse anti-rabbit IgG antibodies followed directly by 10 nm protein A-gold particles (Utrecht University, the Netherlands) before examination with a Philips CM120 Electron Microscope (Eindhoven, the Netherlands) under 80 kV. Immunoprecipitation of eIF2 Kinases for BiP Interaction—RH tachyzoites were treated with 5 μm A23187 or DMSO control for 1 h at 37 °C. The parasites were lysed in 20 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.5% Triton supplemented with protease inhibitors, and the suspension was briefly sonicated 3 times on ice. The lysates were precleared with protein-A-agarose (Invitrogen) followed by immunoprecipitation with affinity-purified TgIF2K-A or TgIF2K-B antibodies and protein-A-agarose for 16 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation and washed three times in lysis buffer. The immune complexes were heated to 95 °C for 10 min and separated on a 4–12% Tris-glycine gel (Invitrogen) and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was subsequently blocked in a 5% nonfat milk solution for 2 h at room temperature. The immunoblot was carried out using a BiP antibody (kindly provided by Dr. Jay Bangs, University of Wisconsin-Madison) (15Hager K.M. Striepen B. Tilney L.G. Roos D.S. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2631-2638Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (GE Healthcare). BiP was visualized using an ECL Western blotting substrate (Pierce). Real-time PCR—Four hours post-infection, culture medium was replaced with media containing the designated concentrations of tunicamycin or the corresponding concentration of DMSO as the vehicle control. Culture media was replaced daily with fresh drug for 3 days. Parasites were released by needle passage, and total RNA was isolated using RNeasy kit (Qiagen). The cDNA was synthesized using Omniscript RT (Qiagen) and oligo(dT) primer (Ambion). The resulting cDNA was amplified using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and 0.5 μm concentrations of each forward and reverse primer. Primers used were as follows: BAG1, sense, 5′-TGAGCGAGTGTCCGGTTATTT, and antisense, 3′-TAGAACGCCGTTGTCCATTG; LDH2, sense, 5′-ACAATGGCCCAGGCATTCT, and antisense, 3′-CAATAAACATATCGTGAAGCCCATA; β-tubulin (measured for normalization) sense, 5′-ATGTTCCGTGGTCGCATGT, and antisense, 3′-TGGGAATCCACTGAACGAAGT. PCR reactions were performed in triplicate using the 7500 Real-time PCR system and analyzed with relative quantification software (SDS software Version 1.2.1, Applied Biosystems). Cloning, Sequence Data, and Analysis Tools—Sequences used include TgIF2K-A (GenBank™ accession number AAS48463), TgIF2K-B (GenBank™ accession number EU369393), human GCN2 (NP_001013725), human PEK (NP_004827), human PKR (NP_002750), and human HRI (GenBank™ accession number AAF70289). TgIF2K-B cDNA sequence was elucidated by designing multiple overlapping primers based on the ToxoDB gene prediction 583.m05439. cDNA fragments were amplified from T. gondii total RNA using the SuperScript™ III One-Step RT-PCR system (Invitrogen) and subcloned into a TA-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) for DNA sequencing. 3′-Rapid amplification of cDNA ends was performed using T. gondii mRNA and the GeneRacer™ kit (Invitrogen). Preliminary genomic sequence data were accessed via toxodb.org, Releases 1.0–2.2 (19Kissinger J.C. Gajria B. Li L. Paulsen I.T. Roos D.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 234-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Genomic data were provided by The Institute for Genomic Research (supported by the National Institutes of Health Grant AI05093) and by the Sanger Center (Wellcome Trust). DNA and protein sequences were analyzed for homologues using BLAST programs at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. Protein mapping and motif searches were performed using the Pfam HMM data base (pfam.wustl.edu/hmmsearch.shtml). Alignment of the sequences of multiple eIF2α kinase domains was performed using Vector NTI 10.0 (Informax/Invitrogen). eIF2α Phosphorylation and Cytoplasmic Stress—We previously cloned the cDNA encoding the T. gondii eIF2α subunit orthologue (TgIF2α), which contains a conserved regulatory serine residue (amino acid 71) that is phosphorylated in response to alkaline pH or heat shock, stress conditions that induce parasite differentiation to bradyzoites in vitro (11Weiss L.M. Kim K. Front. Biosci. 2000; 5: 391-405Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Sullivan Jr., W.J. Narasimhan J. Bhatti M.M. Wek R.C. Biochem. J. 2004; 380: 523-531Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sodium arsenite is another cytoplasmic stress agent that induces T. gondii differentiation in vitro (12Soete M. Camus D. Dubremetz J.F. Exp. Parasitol. 1994; 78: 361-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), and we found that this chemical treatment also induced a time-dependent increase of phosphorylation of TgIF2α (Fig. 1A). The importance of oxidative stress in the induction of TgIF2α phosphorylation in response to arsenite exposure was addressed by adding 20 mm N-acetylcysteine, which serves as an antioxidant, to the parasites 30 min before treatment with arsenite. As shown in Fig. 1B, the inclusion of N-acetylcysteine reduced phosphorylation of TgIF2α during arsenite exposure, supporting the idea that oxidative stress is a potent inducer of eIF2α phosphorylation in T. gondii. In other species, phosphorylation of eIF2α has been reported to repress general translation. Although we have shown that TgIF2α is phosphorylated in response to stress, it has not been determined what effect this has on protein production in the parasite. We investigated this by radiolabeling newly synthesized proteins in tachyzoites with [35S]Met/Cys during the period of stress treatment (or mock treatment). Treatment of T. gondii with arsenite led to a ∼60% reduction in protein synthesis compared with the mock-treated cells (Fig. 1C). These results show that a range of different cytoplasmic stresses in T. gondii induce eIF2α phosphorylation, coincident with a dramatic lowering of global translation. ER Stress and Translation Control in T. gondii—In addition to responding to cytoplasmic stress, phosphorylation of eIF2α is a central part of the UPR that remedies ER stress in mammalian cells. To determine whether stress inflicted upon the parasite ER elicits TgIF2α phosphorylation, we treated extracellular parasites with the calcium ionophore A23187. Calcium ionophore increases intracellular Ca2+ levels by releasing it from ER stores and is a well established inducer of ER stress in higher eukaryotes (20Prostko C.R. Brostrom M.A. Brostrom C.O. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 128: 255-265Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Subjecting extracellular tachyzoites to increasing concentrations of A23187 for 1 h showed a marked and dose-dependent increase of TgIF2α phosphorylation (Fig. 2A). Tunicamycin is another well characterized ER stress agent that inhibits N-linked glycosylation of secreted proteins (2Wek R.C. Cavener D.R. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2007; 9: 2357-2371Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 21Ma K. Vattem K.M. Wek R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18728-18735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 22Luk F.C. Johnson T.M. Beckers C.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2007; 157: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of TgIF2α was also sharply induced in response to treatment with as little as a 1.2 μm concentrations of this ER stress agent (Fig. 2B). These results support the idea that T. gondii activates the eIF2 kinase pathway in response to both ER and cytoplasmic stress arrangements.FIGURE 2eIF2-mediated translational control in response to ER stress. Tachyzoites were incubated in the presence of increasing concentrations of A23187 (A) or tunicamycin (Tm; B) for 1 h. Levels of phosphorylated TgIF2α (upper panel) and total TgIF2α (lower panel) were monitored by immunoblotting. C, tachyzoites were subjected to 2.5 μm A23187 or vehicle for a total of 1.5 h after the start of the stress treatment, and [35S]Met/Cys was added to radiolabel the proteins in each sample. Samples were then resolved on SDS-PAGE for autoradiography. D, polysome profiles of extracellular tachyzoites treated with 5 μm A23187 or 12 μm tunicamycin or vehicle (no stress) for 1 h. Polysomes are indicated in the profiles, with an arrow indicating the 80 S monosomes. Statistical analysis was performed for A, B, and C as detailed in Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next addressed whether ER stress agents regulated global translation in T. gondii. Protein synthesis, as measured by incorporation with [35S]Met/Cys, was significantly reduced in parasites treated with A23187 for 1 h (Fig. 2C). It is noteworthy that the higher level of TgIF2α phosphorylation seen with A23187 relative to arsenite corresponded to a greater reduction in protein synthesis. To directly address whether TgIF2α phosphorylation is accompanied by a decrease in translation initiation, we generated polyribosome profiles from tachyzoites subjected to A23187 or tunicamycin. Samples stressed with tunicamycin showed a 45% reduction in polysomes, whereas those stressed with A23187 showed a 93% reduction (Fig. 2D). The diminished polysome fractions and corresponding enhanced free ribosome and monosome fractions in the ER-stressed parasites indicate that these ER stresses trigger a translation initiation defect. Together, these studies demonstrate that protozoan parasites, such as T. gondii, are capable of directing an ER stress response. Moreover, similar to mammalian cells, TgIF2 kinase-mediated translation control is induced in response to a broad range of stress conditions, including those eliciting cytoplasmic and ER perturbations. ER Stress Induced by Tunicamycin Triggers Expression of Bradyzoite Genes—Our findings that ER stress agents induce TgIF2α phosphorylation prompted us to examine if disruption of this organelle can trigger differentiation to bradyzoites. We focused on tunicamycin in this assay because A23187 has been reported to induce rapid egress of parasites from their host cells (23Endo T. Sethi K.K. Piekarski G. Exp. Parasitol. 1982; 53: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Treatment of intracellular tachyzoites with 1.0 μm tunicamycin triggered the expression of bradyzoite cyst wall antigens within 3 days, as detected by staining with D. biflorus lectin (Fig. 3A). We also assessed mRNA levels for two bradyzoite-specific genes using real-time PCR in parasites subjected to mock treatment, alkaline pH, or increasing concentrations of tunicamycin for 3 days. Treatment with tunicamycin significantly increased BAG1 and LDH2 message levels in a dose-dependent fashion, with concentrations >1.0 μm producing more dramatic responses than the standard method of differentiation using alkaline pH (Fig. 3B). 10 μm tunicamycin appeared to exert stress on the host cell monolayer, which likely accounts for the decrease in BAG1 and LDH2 message levels compared with 5 μm tunicamycin. We conclude that TgIF2α phosphorylation and translation control due to ER stress induces the expression of bradyzoite-specific genes and cyst development. Inhibition of eIF2α Dephosphorylation Induces Cyst Development—Salubrinal (Sal) is a selective inhibitor of cellular complexes that dephosphorylate eIF2α (24Boyce M. Bryant K.F. Jousse C. Long K. Harding H.P. Scheuner D. Kaufman R.J. Ma D. Coen D.M. Ron D. Yuan J. Science. 2005; 307: 935-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar). We tested if Sal had the same"
https://openalex.org/W2099355488,"The use of stimulants (methylphenidate and amphetamine) as cognitive enhancers by the general public is increasing and is controversial. It is still unclear how they work or why they improve performance in some individuals but impair it in others. To test the hypothesis that stimulants enhance signal to noise ratio of neuronal activity and thereby reduce cerebral activity by increasing efficiency, we measured the effects of methylphenidate on brain glucose utilization in healthy adults. We measured brain glucose metabolism (using Positron Emission Tomography and 2-deoxy-2[18F]fluoro-D-glucose) in 23 healthy adults who were tested at baseline and while performing an accuracy-controlled cognitive task (numerical calculations) given with and without methylphenidate (20 mg, oral). Sixteen subjects underwent a fourth scan with methylphenidate but without cognitive stimulation. Compared to placebo methylphenidate significantly reduced the amount of glucose utilized by the brain when performing the cognitive task but methylphenidate did not affect brain metabolism when given without cognitive stimulation. Whole brain metabolism when the cognitive task was given with placebo increased 21% whereas with methylphenidate it increased 11% (50% less). This reflected both a decrease in magnitude of activation and in the regions activated by the task. Methylphenidate's reduction of the metabolic increases in regions from the default network (implicated in mind-wandering) was associated with improvement in performance only in subjects who activated these regions when the cognitive task was given with placebo. These results corroborate prior findings that stimulant medications reduced the magnitude of regional activation to a task and in addition document a “focusing” of the activation. This effect may be beneficial when neuronal resources are diverted (i.e., mind-wandering) or impaired (i.e., attention deficit hyperactivity disorder), but it could be detrimental when brain activity is already optimally focused. This would explain why methylphenidate has beneficial effects in some individuals and contexts and detrimental effects in others."
https://openalex.org/W2010610551,"Background Interleukin (IL)-32 is a recently described pro-inflammatory cytokine that has been reported to be induced by bacteria treatment in culture cells. Little is known about IL-32 production by exogenous pathogens infection in human individuals. Methods and Findings In this study, we found that IL-32 level was increased by 58.2% in the serum samples from a cohort of 108 patients infected by influenza A virus comparing to that of 115 healthy individuals. Another pro-inflammatory factor cyclooxygenase (COX)-2-associated prostaglandin E2 was also upregulated by 2.7-fold. Expression of IL-32 in influenza A virus infected A549 human lung epithelial cells was blocked by either selective COX-2 inhibitor NS398 or Aspirin, a known anti-inflammatory drug, indicating IL-32 was induced through COX-2 in the inflammatory cascade. Interestingly, we found that COX-2-associate PGE2 production activated by influenza virus infection was significantly suppressed by over-expression of IL-32 but increased by IL-32-specific siRNA, suggesting there was a feedback mechanism between IL-32 and COX-2. Conclusions IL-32 is induced by influenza A virus infection via COX-2 in the inflammatory cascade. Our results provide that IL-32 is a potential target for anti-inflammatory medicine screening."
https://openalex.org/W1973204293,"Integrin cell-adhesion receptors transduce signals bidirectionally across the plasma membrane via the single-pass transmembrane segments of each alpha and beta subunit. While the beta3 transmembrane segment consists of a linear 29-residue alpha-helix, the structure of the alphaIIb transmembrane segment reveals a linear 24-residue alpha-helix (Ile-966 -Lys-989) followed by a backbone reversal that packs Phe-992-Phe-993 against the transmembrane helix. The length of the alphaIIb transmembrane helix implies the absence of a significant transmembrane helix tilt in contrast to its partnering beta3 subunit. Sequence alignment shows Gly-991-Phe-993 to be fully conserved among all 18 human integrin alpha subunits, suggesting that their unusual structural motif is prototypical for integrin alpha subunits. The alphaIIb transmembrane structure demonstrates a level of complexity within the membrane that is beyond simple transmembrane helices and forms the structural basis for assessing the extent of structural and topological rearrangements upon alphaIIb-beta3 association, i.e. integrin transmembrane signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2009127356,"The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) capsid protein plays a critical role in virus core particle assembly and is an important target for novel therapeutic strategies. In a previous study, we characterized the binding affinity of a hydrocarbon stapled helical peptide, NYAD-1, for the capsid protein (Kd ∼ 1 μm) and demonstrated its ability to penetrate the cell membrane (Zhang, H., Zhao, Q., Bhattacharya, S., Waheed, A. A., Tong, X., Hong, A., Heck, S., Goger, M., Cowburn, D., Freed, E. O., and Debnath, A. K. (2008) J. Mol. Biol. 378, 565–580). In cell-based assays, NYAD-1 colocalized with the Gag polyprotein during traffic to the plasma membrane and disrupted the formation of mature and immature virus particles in vitro systems. Here, we complement the cellular and biochemical data with structural characterization of the interactions between the capsid and a soluble peptide analogue, NYAD-13. Solution NMR methods were used to determine a high resolution structure of the complex between the inhibitor and a monomeric form of the C-terminal domain of the capsid protein (mCA-CTD). The intermolecular interactions are mediated by the packing of hydrophobic side chains at the buried interface and unperturbed by the presence of the olefinic chain on the solvent-exposed surface of the peptide. The results of the structural analysis provide valuable insight into the determinants for high affinity and selective inhibitors for HIV-1 particle assembly.

Worldwide 30 million people are infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), 2The abbreviations used are: HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus type 1; CA, capsid; CA-CTD, wild type C-terminal domain of capsid; mCA-CTD, monomeric and mutant form (W184A/M185A) of C-terminal domain of HIV-1 capsid protein; EIAV, equine infectious anemia virus; HSQC, heteronuclear single-quantum coherence; Lya, lysine-analog residue; MHR, major homology region; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; NOESY, NOE spectroscopy; PDB, Protein Data Bank; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation. and it has claimed more lives than some of the deadliest epidemics in human history. HIV-1 belongs to the retroviral family, and significant progress made in understanding its life cycle has fueled the development of diverse therapeutic strategies. Important targets for intervention include inhibiting the fusion of the virus at the surface of CD4+T cells, reverse transcription of the viral RNA, and processing of the gag polyprotein by the HIV-1 protease (1De Clercq E. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2007; 6: 1001-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). However, none of these treatment strategies has proven to be fully effective against the rapid emergence of drug-resistant variants of the virus. As we gain further insight into the structural biology of the virus particle itself and the mechanism of its assembly from the gag polyprotein, the latter has emerged as an important new target for drug development (2Li F. Wild C. Curr. Opin. Investig. Drugs. 2005; 6: 148-154PubMed Google Scholar). The newly synthesized gag protein migrates to the inner surface of the cell membrane, where it buds into an immature particle that encapsulates the genomic material and important viral proteins. Subsequent proteolytic cleavage of the gag protein into the matrix protein, capsid, and nucleocapsid protein lead to repacking of the core and the formation of the mature virus particle. The interactions involving the capsid protein play a crucial role in the formation of the virus core particle with the correct morphology and are an important target for disrupting the assembly step. The dimeric capsid protein consists of N- and C-terminal domains that are flexibly linked in each monomer, and dimerization is mediated by the C-terminal domain. In mature particles, the capsid protein assembles into a fullerene-like structure with densely packed hexamers of the capsid protein. The formation of the hexamer is mediated by the N-terminal domain of the capsid, and the hexameric rings are bridged by the C-terminal dimerization domain (3Li S. Hill C.P. Sundquist W.I. Finch J.T. Nature. 2000; 407: 409-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 4Ganser-Pornillos B.K. Cheng A. Yeager M. Cell. 2007; 131: 70-79Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The first target for disrupting the CA assembly was the identification of small molecules that could bind to the N-terminal domain of the capsid protein (5Tang C. Loeliger E. Kinde I. Kyere S.

Sundquist W.I. Summers M.F. Hill C.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 373: 355-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Subsequently, a short peptide (CAI) bound to the C-terminal dimerization domain of the capsid protein was shown to disrupt the formation of the budding virus particle in vitro (7Sticht J. Humbert M. Findlow S. Bodem J. Muller B. Dietrich U. Werner J. Krausslich H.G. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 671-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 8Ternois F. Sticht J. Duquerroy S. Krausslich H.G. Rey F.A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 678-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The possible clinical application of these compounds is limited by weak binding affinity, toxicity and, in the case of CAI, low membrane permeability. The lack of insight into the mechanism of inhibition by these small molecules was remedied by the recently published cryo-electron microscopy image reconstruction of the capsid assembly (4Ganser-Pornillos B.K. Cheng A. Yeager M. Cell. 2007; 131: 70-79Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). We now know that both CAP-1 and CAI bind onto a surface that could potentially disrupt the interactions between the N- and C-terminal domains of two different CA molecules packed in the hexameric rings of the lattice (4Ganser-Pornillos B.K. Cheng A. Yeager M. Cell. 2007; 131: 70-79Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 6Kelly B.N. Kyere S. Kinde I. Tang C. Howard B.R. Robinson H. Sundquist W.I. Summers M.F.

Cell. 2007; 131: 17-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In a previous study starting with the sequence of CAI, we presented the structural basis for a redesigned peptide NYAD-1 that is cell-permeable and has a 10-fold higher affinity for CA-CTD (Kd ∼ 1 μm) (10Zhang H. Zhao Q. Bhattacharya S. Waheed A.A. Tong X. Hong A. Heck S. Goger M. Cowburn D. Freed E.O. Debnath A.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 378: 565-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In the x-ray structure of CAI in complex with CA-CTD, the peptide forms an amphipathic helix with the hydrophobic surface buried at the complex interface (8Ternois F. Sticht J. Duquerroy S. Krausslich H.G. Rey F.A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 678-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The location of charged residues Asp-4 and Glu-8 on the solvent-exposed surface of the peptide was ideal for chemical modification by hydrocarbon stapling, a well known technique for stabilizing the secondary structure of helical peptides by cross-linking the i and i + 4 positions with an olefinic chain via β-alanine analogues (13Schafmeister C.E. Po J. Verdine G.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 5891-5892Crossref Scopus (778) Google Scholar). The olefinic chain is also known to enhance cell permeability of peptides and has been used quite successfully for designing an activator from the BID (Bcl-2 interacting protein) BH3 domain for BAX (Bcl-2 associated X protein) (11Walensky L.D. Pitter K. Morash J. Oh K.J. Barbuto S. Fisher J. Smith E. Verdine G.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 199-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) and reactivation of p53 tumor suppressor pathway by a stapled p53 peptide (12Bernal F. Tyler A.F. Korsmeyer S.J. Walensky L.D. Verdine G.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2007; 129: 2456-2457Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Residues Asp-4 and Glu-8 from CAI were replaced with a non-standard amino acid (S)-2-(2′-pentenyl) alanine whose side chains were then cross-linked with an olefinic bond (13Schafmeister C.E. Po J. Verdine G.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 5891-5892Crossref Scopus (778) Google Scholar) (Scheme 1). As anticipated, the redesigned peptide NYAD-1 formed a stable helix in solution and was cell-permeable. Fluorescent tagging showed the peptide colocalized with the gag protein in the cell and specifically disrupted the formation of mature HIV-1 particles in a dose-dependent manner (IC50 ∼ 4–15 μm). The binding site of the peptide was mapped from the back-bone chemical shift differences and shown to correspond closely to the site identified in the x-ray structure of CAI in complex with CA-CTD (7Sticht J. Humbert M. Findlow S. Bodem J. Muller B. Dietrich U. Werner J. Krausslich H.G. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 671-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 8Ternois F. Sticht J. Duquerroy S. Krausslich H.G. Rey F.A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 678-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The rationally designed model predicts the presence of the bulky linker on the distal site of the peptide, not altering the binding site of CA-CTD, but perturbations in the peptide structure might still be apparent. In this report, we extend the previously published biochemical data to the complete structural characterization of the complex formed between a soluble homologue NYAD-13 and the monomeric form of the C-terminal domain of the capsid protein. The peptide NYAD-13 was derived from NYAD-1 by replacing the proline at the C-terminal with three lysines. The rationale for the substitution was two-fold; although the C-terminal end of CAI is not engaged in intermolecular interactions, the positive charges would increase the solubility of the peptide NYAD-13 and facilitate structural studies. The principal objective of determining a high resolution NMR structure of the complex was to probe the role of the olefinic chain in the bound peptide structure and its impact on the binding mode. It is our goal to employ the analysis of the NMR ensemble to obtain a more dynamic view of the CA-CTD binding site and identify the determinants of binding affinity of the HIV-1 capsid domain. The structural insights are expected to help us in optimizing the peptide-based inhibitors with respect to both affinity and specific antiviral activity. Peptide Synthesis—The NYAD-13 peptide was synthesized by replacing the fourth (i) and eight (i + 4) residues of the linear peptide CAI ITFEDLLDYYGKKK by the olefin-bearing unnatural amino acid (S)-2-(2′-pentenyl) alanines stapled by the olefin metathesis using the Grubbs catalyst (13Schafmeister C.E. Po J. Verdine G.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 5891-5892Crossref Scopus (778) Google Scholar). The helical conformation of the free peptide was confirmed (data not shown) from circular dichroism (10Zhang H. Zhao Q. Bhattacharya S. Waheed A.A. Tong X. Hong A. Heck S. Goger M. Cowburn D. Freed E.O. Debnath A.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 378: 565-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In the NMR assignment and structure, the peptide is numbered 1–14. NMR Samples—Uniformly 15N/13C-enriched protein samples of mCA-CTD were produced by expressing the pET14b plasmid encoding the gene in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells cultured in M9-minimal medium containing 15NH4Cl (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) and [13C6]glucose as sole nitrogen and carbon source, respectively. Recombinant proteins were isolated from bacteria as described previously (10Zhang H. Zhao Q. Bhattacharya S. Waheed A.A. Tong X. Hong A. Heck S. Goger M. Cowburn D. Freed E.O. Debnath A.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 378: 565-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), and the integrity of the samples was confirmed by mass spectrometry. NMR samples were prepared from U-15N,13C-labeled C-CA sample complexed with unlabeled NYAD-13 peptide dissolved in 100 mm NH4Ac buffer, 95% H2O, 5% D2O, and 2 mm dithiothreitol at pH 7.0. The molecular concentrations were estimated from the UV absorbance at 280 nm with extinction coefficients of 2,980 m–1 cm–1 (peptide) and 3,105 M–1 cm–1 (protein), respectively. Resonance assignments were made on a sample containing 400 μl of 1.9 mm U-15N,13C-labeled mCA-CTD complexed with 1.8 mm unlabeled NYAD-13 in the acetate buffer. NOE data were collected on two samples containing 600 μm U-15N,13C-labeled mCA-CTD complexed with 900 μm unlabeled peptide in 90% H2O, 10% D2O, and 100% D2O. In the NMR assignment and structure, the CA protein is numbered from the natural sequence, 147–231 GI: 2801 504. NMR Resonance Assignments—NMR data were acquired at 25 °C on Bruker AVANCE spectrometers equipped with Z axis gradient triple axis CryoProbes. A standard suite of backbone (HNCA, HN(CO)CA, HNCACB, CBCA(CO)NH, HNCO, HN(CA)CO) and side-chain experiments (HCCCONH, HCCH-TOCS, HCCH-COSY) was acquired at 500 MHz for chemical shift assignments (14Sattler M. Schleucher J. Greisinger C. Prog. NMR Spectrosc. 1999; 34: 93-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1399) Google Scholar, 15Cavanagh J. Fairbrother III, W.J. Palmer A.G. Skelton N.J. Protein NMR Spectroscopy: Principles and Practice. Academic Press, San Diego1996Google Scholar). Distance restraints were obtained from 13C-edited three-dimensional NOESY-HSQC (100-ms mixing time) optimized for aliphatic and aromatic resonances and acquired on both H2O and D2O samples. Information for the amide region was obtained from a 15N-edited three-dimensional NOESY-HSQC acquired at 800 MHz. The peptide NYAD-13 was assigned using two-dimensional 15N,13C f1, f2-filtered NOESY acquired at 900 MHz (16Ikura M. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 2433-2440Crossref Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Inter-molecular NOEs were obtained from two-dimensional 15N,13C f2-filtered NOESY at 900 MHz and three-dimensional 15N,13C f1-filtered 13C-edited NOESY-HSQC experiment recorded with 100-ms mixing time at 800 MHz on both H2O and D2O samples (17Zwahlen C. Legault P. Vincent S.J.F. Greenbalt J. Konrat R. Kay L.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 6711-6721Crossref Scopus (539) Google Scholar). Structure Calculations—NMR data were processed in Topspin 1.3 from Bruker Biospin and analyzed using CARA1.5 (18Keller R. Optimizing the Process of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectrum Analysis and Computer Aided Resonance Assignment. Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule (ETH) Zurich, Switzerland2004Google Scholar). The structure of the peptide-bound complex was calculated in two stages using the programs CYANA 2.1 (19Herrmann T. Guntert P. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 209-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar, 20Güntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2558) Google Scholar) for the automatic assignment of the NOE peak lists, and a final water refinement was done in ARIA 2.2 (21Nilges M. Macias M.J. O'Donoghue S.I. Oschkinat H. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 408-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). The upper limits of the distance restraints were calculated from the NOESY cross-peak intensities using the calibration routine of CYANA, and the dihedral angles were obtained from TALOS (22Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2740) Google Scholar). The upper limit for the intermolecular distances were initially set to 4.5 and 6.0 Å but subsequently scaled to minimize the target function without increasing restraint violations. During the CYANA runs, the peptide was calculated without the olefinic linker, and a lysine was used instead of the non-standard amino acid (S)-2-(2′-pentenyl) alanine. The ensemble of the 20 best structures had a backbone r.m.s.d. of 0.36 ± 0.06 Å (residues 128–218, 3–10) and an average target function of 0.78 ± 0.06. There were no distance violations greater than 0.2 Å and no dihedral violations greater than 5°. The CYANA-generated distance and angle restraints were converted into the CNS format in CCPN (23Fogh R. Ionides J. Ulrich E. Boucher W. Vranken W. Linge J.P. Habeck M. Rieping W. Bhat T.N. Westbrook J. Henrick K. Gilliland G. Berman H. Thornton J. Nilges M. Markley J. Laue E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 416-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The structure for the non-standard amino acid linker was generated and energy-minimized in PRODRG2 (24Schuttelkopf A.W. van Aalten D.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 1355-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (4360) Google Scholar). The new definitions of the bond lengths and angles were introduced in topollhdg5.3.pro and parallhdg5.3.pro files for incorporation during the CNS annealing run and are available in the supplemental material. A total of 1,000 structures were calculated, and the 200 lowest energy structures were subjected to water refinement and further analysis by PROCHECK_NMR (25Laskowski R.A. Rullman J.A.C. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4474) Google Scholar). The structural statistics of the 20 best structures are reported in Table S1. The wild type C-terminal domain of the HIV-1 capsid protein forms a symmetric dimer with a Kd ∼ 18 μm (26Gamble T.R. Yoo S. Vajdos F.F. von Schwedler U.K. Worthylake D.K. Wang H. McCutcheon J.P. Sundquist W.I. Hill C.P. Science. 1997; 278: 849-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). The dimer interface is stabilized by hydrophobic interactions involving the side chains of Trp-184 and Met-185 and salt bridges (26Gamble T.R. Yoo S. Vajdos F.F. von Schwedler U.K. Worthylake D.K. Wang H. McCutcheon J.P. Sundquist W.I. Hill C.P. Science. 1997; 278: 849-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Dimerization of the capsid domain is completely abolished by mutating either one of these sites (Trp-184 and Met-185) to alanine, and the defective variants inhibited assembly of mature particles and infectivity (27von Schwedler U.K. Stray K.M. Garrus J.E. Sundquist W.I. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 5439-5450Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Despite the loss of functionality, the recently published NMR structure of mCA-CTD (28Wong H.C. Shin R. Krishna N.R. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 2289-2297Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) suggests that the monomer structure is not perturbed significantly when compared with the dimer. The remarkable stability of the monomeric form has been attributed to hydrophobic packing and a network of hydrogen bonds formed by conserved residues belonging to the MHR motif (26Gamble T.R. Yoo S. Vajdos F.F. von Schwedler U.K. Worthylake D.K. Wang H. McCutcheon J.P. Sundquist W.I. Hill C.P. Science. 1997; 278: 849-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). It has been previously reported that the dimer in solution exists as multiple conformations that interchange on the slower time scale (7Sticht J. Humbert M. Findlow S. Bodem J. Muller B. Dietrich U. Werner J. Krausslich H.G. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 671-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The functional relevance of the flexible dimer interface can be rationalized as a structural requirement in the packing of the hexameric rings mediated by the CA-CTD (4Ganser-Pornillos B.K. Cheng A. Yeager M. Cell. 2007; 131: 70-79Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 26Gamble T.R. Yoo S. Vajdos F.F. von Schwedler U.K. Worthylake D.K. Wang H. McCutcheon J.P. Sundquist W.I. Hill C.P. Science. 1997; 278: 849-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). In solution, binding of the peptide NYAD-13 to CA-CTD does not quench the conformational flexibility of the dimer entirely, 3S. Bhattacharya, H. Zhang, A. K. Debnath, and D. Cowburn, unpublished results. and using the analogy of the CAI complex structure, we can speculate that the peptide destabilizes rather than dissociates the dimer (7Sticht J. Humbert M. Findlow S. Bodem J. Muller B. Dietrich U. Werner J. Krausslich H.G. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 671-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The absence of any change in line width between the free and the peptide-bound forms of CA-CTD further supported this conclusion. To meet the immediate goal of this study and circumvent the problem of differential line-broadening from conformational exchange, we decided to work with the monomeric form of the mutant capsid protein. Structure of NYAD-13 in Complex with mCA-CTD—The monomeric form of CA-CTD as shown in Fig. 1 consists of a four helix bundle (161–172, 179–192, 196–205, 211–217) stabilized by the hydrophobic core of the protein. The N-terminal region has a short 3–10 helix (150–152) and a strand (153–158) connected by a type I β turn (156–159) to helix I. The extreme C-terminal residues 219–231 form an unstructured floppy tail. The absence of residual structure at the C terminus was confirmed by backbone amide-proton relaxation experiments. Helix I, which is also part of the highly conserved MHR motif, plays a crucial role in stabilizing the helical scaffold of the protein. Important hydrophobic contacts are manifested in a large number of long range NOEs involving the aromatic rings of Phe-161, Tyr-164, and Tyr-169 and the methyl groups of Val-165 and Leu-172 (Fig. 1B). The tight packing of side chains in the buried core of the protein is reinforced by the absence of Tyr-164 ring flips on the fast NMR time scale. In the peptide complexed structure of mCA-CTD, helix 2 is very well defined with a kink starting at Thr-188, and this is in contrast to the partial loss in structure reported in previous studies (28Wong H.C. Shin R. Krishna N.R. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 2289-2297Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 29Alcaraz L.A. del Alamo M. Barrera F.N. Mateu M.G. Neira J.L. Biophys. J. 2007; 93: 1264-1276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Binding of the peptide thus appears to stabilize the secondary structure of helix 2. In the x-ray structure of CA-CTD (PDB code 1AUM), conserved residues from the MHR motif, Arg-167, Glu-159, Gly-156, and Arg-154, participate in a network of hydrogen bonds vital to the stability of the capsid fold (26Gamble T.R. Yoo S. Vajdos F.F. von Schwedler U.K. Worthylake D.K. Wang H. McCutcheon J.P. Sundquist W.I. Hill C.P. Science. 1997; 278: 849-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Although we did not see evidence of these hydrogen bonds in all our structures, we did observe the following donor-acceptor pairs (GluHN-159–GlyCO-156, ArgHH21-167–ArgCO-154) within hydrogen-bonding distance in at least 40% of the ensemble. The peptide binding site on the protein is a shallow hydrophobic pocket lined by residues from all four helices. The bound peptide (residues 3–11) adopts a helical conformation where the hydrophobic side chains make extensive intermolecular contacts with specific direct experimental confirmation from NOEs. The long axis of the peptide is perpendicular to both helix I and helix II with the N terminus buried against helix II and stabilized by the capping interactions involving Thr-2 and Asn-183 (8Ternois F. Sticht J. Duquerroy S. Krausslich H.G. Rey F.A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 678-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The importance of Asn-183 at this position is supported by observing several NOEs between Asn-183 side-chain protons and Thr-2 and Phe-3 resonances. The peptide forms an amphipathic helix that buries several hydrophobic side chains of Phe-3, Leu-6, Tyr-9, and Tyr-10 at the interface of the complex. The most important residue appears to be the aromatic ring of Phe-3, which inserts itself partly between helix I and helix II without disrupting the core packing of the protein. Phe-3 makes a large number of important contacts with the side chains of Tyr-169, Leu-172, Arg-173, and Thr-186 (Fig. 2A). The aromatic ring of Phe-3 appears to partially fill a hydrophobic cavity and is a strong candidate for substitution that could potentially disrupt the core structure. Leu-6 anchors the lower surface of the peptide through interactions with Val-165 and Leu-211 (Fig. 2B). The partly solvent-exposed side chain of Tyr-9 on the lower surface of the peptide interacts with Leu-211 and Glu-212. The ring of Tyr-10 packs against the side chains of Val-165 and Tyr-169 and is important for anchoring the C-terminal end of the helical peptide. The unstructured C-terminal end of the peptide (11GKKK14) is completely exposed to the solvent and does not participate in intermolecular interactions. The olefinic linker connecting positions 4 and 8 on the solvent-accessible surface of the peptide did not yield any intermolecular NOEs. In the final ensemble of structures, the Asn-183 side chain was found to be closest in distance to the linker, but this interaction was not observed in the NOE data. There are no previous published structures of a stapled peptide using this linker, so the chemical structure of the hydrocarbon ring was confirmed by the intra-ring NOEs. The eight-membered carbon component is sufficiently long that no kinking is needed. In the 20 lowest target structures, the Cα-Cα distances for Lya-4—Lya-8 ranged from 6 to 8 Å. The range of flexibility of the induced helix and of the ring is likely restricted by the trans-olefinic bond, as indicated by observed NOEs to the side chain of Asp-5, and this will be the subject of additional future investigation. In summary, the interactions between NYAD-13 and mCA-CTD are mediated by hydrophobic contacts, and the presence of the olefinic chain on the exposed surface of the peptide does not perturb these interactions. The principal effect of the olefinic chain is to impose constraints on the backbone of NYAD-13, and the flexibly linked peptide side chains can easily adapt to the binding surface of mCA-CTD. Structural Comparison with CA-CTD and CAI+CA-CTD Complex—The overall similarities between the three-dimensional structures of mCA-CTD in complex with NYAD-13 and CA-CTD (PDB code 2BUO) in the presence and absence of CAI are remarkably high (Fig. 2). The most significant differences between the three structures are observed in the relative position of helix II, which plays a critical role in dimer formation (26Gamble T.R. Yoo S. Vajdos F.F. von Schwedler U.K. Worthylake D.K. Wang H. McCutcheon J.P. Sundquist W.I. Hill C.P. Science. 1997; 278: 849-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). The backbone Cα atom r.m.s.d. of all four helices when compared with CA-CTD in the absence of CAI is 0.8 Å, whereas the superposition of helix I (161–172), helix III (196–205), and helix IV (211–217) is better than 0.4 Å. When complexed to NYAD-13, the C terminus of helix II in mCA-CTD is displaced by 2.8 Å when compared with the free protein (Fig. 2D). This repositioning of helices I and II results in a much larger (6 Å) movement in the wild type CA-CTD complexed with CAI (8Ternois F. Sticht J. Duquerroy S. Krausslich H.G. Rey F.A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 678-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). This movement of helix II is also shown to be coupled to a decrease in the buried surface area at the dimer interface and predicted to destabilize the structure of the dimer (8Ternois F. Sticht J. Duquerroy S. Krausslich H.G. Rey F.A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 678-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In the complex of mCA-CTD with NYAD-13, the movement of helix II appears to be restricted and may simply reflect the need to preserve the packing between the two long helices in the absence of the stabilizing effect of the dimerization contacts. As such, the rotation of helix II does not trigger a major conformational change in the hydrophobic core of the protein, but the flipping of side chains essentially remolds the topology of the binding surface. In support of an induced fit mechanism, the coupled rearrangement of several side chains creates new cavities and provides access to buried residues. The importance of these changes is highlighted in Fig. 2D. The aromatic ring of Tyr-169 flips by 90°, which facilitates the docking of Phe-3 into a newly created cavity lined by Leu-172 and Phe-168. The lateral movement of helix II also removes Lys-182 from the N terminus of the peptide, and this position is now occupied by Asn-183 important for capping interactions. The similarities in the packing of side chains at the intermolecular surface of the NYAD-13 and CAI complexes suggest a common mechanism of binding that relies on the recognition of hydrophobic side chains. The packing of the aromatic rings of Phe-3, Tyr-9, and Tyr-10 play a crucial role in anchoring the peptide to the protein. The relative positions and average orientation of the rings is preserved in the two structures. We do see a difference in the stereochemistry of the methyl groups of the two leucines. The side chain of Leu-6 is completely buried at the complex interface and thus favors a single rotamer in NYAD-13 but is flipped when compared with CAI. This is in contrast to Leu-7, which is not constrained by interactions on the solvent-exposed surface of the peptide. In conclusion, the relative flexibility of the helix I/II interface and the floppiness of side chains presented by helix I at the binding surface play a critical role in eliminating steric clashes and maximizing the buried apolar surface area in the complex. The total buried surface (1,346 Å2) in the NYAD-13-bound complex of mCA-CTD is distributed equally between mCA-CTD (635 Å2, 10% of SA surface) and the peptide (712 Å2, 40% of SA). These numbers are remarkably close to those of CA-CTD bound to CAI (8Ternois F. Sticht J. Duquerroy S. Krausslich H.G. Rey F.A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 678-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Therefore, the 10-fold higher affinity of NYAD-13 (Kd ∼ 1 μm) for mCA-CTD when compared with CAI for mCA-CTD (Kd ∼ 15 μm) can simply be attributed to a loss of unfavorable entropic contributions as the stapled peptide is already folded into a helical conformation. The issue of in vivo effectiveness of the related NYAD-1 likely reflects the difference of cell permeability and of stability rather than of structural interaction. In summary, the hydrocarbon stapling renders the biologically active peptide inhibitor NYAD-1 cell-permeable and enhances the binding affinity for CA-CTD (10Zhang H. Zhao Q. Bhattacharya S. Waheed A.A. Tong X. Hong A. Heck S. Goger M. Cowburn D. Freed E.O. Debnath A.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 378: 565-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In this study, the biochemical data are complemented with a high resolution NMR structure of mCA-CTD in complex with NYAD-13 and provides understanding of the structural role of the linker. Confirming the absence of interactions between the linker and mCA-CTD was therefore the first step in refining the structure of NYAD-13 as a legitimate drug candidate for HIV-1. Future efforts will focus on improving the peptide solubility and binding affinity without sacrificing some of its favorable drug like properties. A strategic goal relevant to future design efforts is to understand the molecular basis for specificity of such peptide inhibitors against retroviruses in general. In the previous study, we have shown the peptide analogue NYAD-1 to be active only in inhibiting mature and immature HIV particle assembly and not against EIAV particles (10Zhang H. Zhao Q. Bhattacharya S. Waheed A.A. Tong X. Hong A. Heck S. Goger M. Cowburn D. Freed E.O. Debnath A.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 378: 565-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In the sequence alignment of p24 domains (supplemental material), the highly conserved residues belong to the MHR motif, but elsewhere, there are few similarities. In the EIAV sequence, the two substitutions (Y169L and N183K) in the hydrophobic binding surface could dictate the ability to bind NYAD-1 with sufficient affinity. The conclusions drawn from the sequence analysis are highly speculative and do not include the effect of EIAV particle morphology. Structural details of the capsid formation in the presence and absence of inhibitors are crucial for addressing some of these issues.

https://openalex.org/W2149268709,"The bifunctional trypanothione synthetase-amidase catalyzes biosynthesis and hydrolysis of the glutathione-spermidine adduct trypanothione, the principal intracellular thiol-redox metabolite in parasitic trypanosomatids. These parasites are unique with regard to their reliance on trypanothione to determine intracellular thiol-redox balance in defense against oxidative and chemical stress and to regulate polyamine levels. Enzymes involved in trypanothione biosynthesis provide essential biological activities, and those absent from humans or for which orthologues are sufficiently distinct are attractive targets to underpin anti-parasitic drug discovery. The structure of Leishmania major trypanothione synthetase-amidase, determined in three crystal forms, reveals two catalytic domains. The N-terminal domain, a cysteine, histidine-dependent amidohydrolase/peptidase amidase, is a papain-like cysteine protease, and the C-terminal synthetase domain displays an ATP-grasp family fold common to C:N ligases. Modeling of substrates into each active site provides insight into the specificity and reactivity of this unusual enzyme, which is able to catalyze four reactions. The domain orientation is distinct from that observed in a related bacterial glutathionylspermidine synthetase. In trypanothione synthetase-amidase, the interactions formed by the C terminus, binding in and restricting access to the amidase active site, suggest that the balance of ligation and hydrolytic activity is directly influenced by the alignment of the domains with respect to each other and implicate conformational changes with amidase activity. The potential inhibitory role of the C terminus provides a mechanism to control relative levels of the critical metabolites, trypanothione, glutathionylspermidine, and spermidine in Leishmania."
https://openalex.org/W2095010666,"Skeletal muscle is composed of diverse fiber types, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for this diversification remain unclear. Herein, we report that the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 pathway, but not p38 or c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK), is preferentially activated in fast-twitch muscles. Pharmacological blocking of ERK1/2 pathway increased slow-twitch fiber type-specific reporter activity and repressed those associated with the fast-twitch fiber phenotype in vitro. Overexpression of a constitutively active ERK2 had an opposite effect. Inhibition of ERK signaling in cultured myotubes increased slow-twitch fiber-specific protein accumulation while repressing those characteristic of fast-twitch fibers. Overexpression of MAP kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP1) in mouse and rat muscle fibers containing almost exclusively type IIb or IIx fast myosin heavy chain (MyHC) isoforms induced de novo synthesis of the slower, more oxidative type IIa and I MyHCs in a time-dependent manner. Conversion to the slower phenotype was confirmed by up-regulation of slow reporter gene activity and down-regulation of fast reporter activities in response to forced MKP1 expression in vivo. In addition, activation of ERK2 signaling induced up-regulation of fast-twitch fiber program in soleus. These data suggest that the MAPK signaling, most likely the ERK1/2 pathway, is necessary to preserve the fast-twitch fiber phenotype with a concomitant repression of slow-twitch fiber program."

Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) maintained in 25 mm glucose sustain MAPK activation via increased Shc phosphorylation and Grb2 association resulting in an enhanced mitogenic response compared with cells grown in 5 mm glucose. PI3K plays a major role in IGF-I-stimulated VSMC migration, and hyperglycemia augments this response. In contrast to MAPK activation the role of Shc in modulating PI3K in response to IGF-I has not been determined. In this study we show that impaired Shc association with Grb2 results in decreased Grb2-p85 association, SHPS-1-p85 recruitment, and PI3K activation in response to IGF-I. Exposure of VSMCs to cell-permeable peptides, which contained polyproline sequences from p85 proposed to mediate Grb2 association, resulted in inhibition of Grb2-p85 binding and AKT phosphorylation. Transfected cells that expressed p85 mutant that had specific prolines mutated to alanines resulted in less Grb2-p85 association, and a Grb2 mutant (W36A/W193A) that attenuated p85 binding showed decreased association of p85 with SHPS-1, PI3K activation, AKT phosphorylation, cell proliferation, and migration in response to IGF-I. Cellular exposure to 25 mm glucose, which is required for Shc phosphorylation in response to IGF-I, resulted in enhanced Grb2 binding to p85, activation of PI3K activity, and increased AKT phosphorylation as compared with cells exposed to 5 mm glucose. We conclude that in VSMCs exposed to hyperglycemia, IGF-I stimulation of Shc facilitates the transfer of Grb2 to p85 resulting in enhanced PI3K activation and AKT phosphorylation leading to enhanced cell proliferation and migration.

Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2007; 6: 821-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). IGF-I-stimulated VSMC migration and/or proliferation requires ligand occupancy of the αVβ3 integrin (2Ling Y. Maile L.A. Clemmons D.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 1824-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Activation of the IGF-I receptor is coupled to downstream signaling events via recruitment and phosphorylation of two major adaptor proteins, Shc or members of the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) family. In VSMCs IGF-I stimulation leads to recruitment of the signaling protein Shc to SHP substrate-1 (SHPS-1) allowing sustained MAPK activation (3Ling Y. Maile L.A. Lieskovska J. Badley-Clarke J. Clemmons D.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 3353-3364Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). IGF-I stimulation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) is also required to induce VSMC migration (4Imai Y. Clemmons D.R. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4228-4235Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hyperglycemia has been shown to increase the responsiveness of smooth muscle cells as well as other cell types to growth factor stimulation (5Maile L.A. Capps B.E. Ling Y. Xi G. Clemmons D.R.

Following IGF-I stimulation of porcine VSMCs maintained in hyperglycemic conditions (e.g. >12 mm glucose) there is an increase in Shc phosphorylation and subsequent Grb2 association resulting in sustained MAPK activation and enhanced cell proliferation. In contrast cells grown in 5 mm glucose do not show these changes (5Maile L.A. Capps B.E. Ling Y. Xi G. Clemmons D.R. Endocrinology. 2007; 148: 2435-2443Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Mutation of three Shc tyrosine phosphorylation sites, Tyr-239/240/317, that are required for Grb2 association to phenylalanine (Shc-3F) generates a dominant negative inhibitor of Shc signaling leading to attenuated MAPK activation (10Sasaoka T.

Inhibition of Shc signaling by expressing this mutant form decreases the mitogenic response to IGF-I (3Ling Y. Maile L.A. Lieskovska J. Badley-Clarke J. Clemmons D.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 3353-3364Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PI3Ks are a family of enzymes that catalyze the phosphorylation of the 3-position of the inositol ring in the phosphoinositide 4,5-bisphosphate to yield phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate that functions to recruit downstream signaling molecules such as AKT to the cell membrane (14Cantley L.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1655-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (4542) Google Scholar). The class IA PI3Ks contain two subunits: the p110 catalytic subunit that contains the enzymatic activity and p85α, the regulatory adaptor subunit. The p85α subunit plays an important role in mediating the activation of p110 in response to tyrosine kinases. These tyrosine kinases may be an integral part of a receptor such as growth factor receptors (e.g. platelet-derived growth factor and epidermal growth factor), or they can be nonreceptor tyrosine kinases that either associate with or are activated by receptors (e.g. Syk and ZAP70) or the Src family of protein-tyrosine kinases that associate with B cell or T cell receptors. These tyrosine kinases phosphorylate the critical tyrosine residues within activation motifs that can be present on the receptors themselves (e.g. platelet-derived growth factor or Fc receptors) or present on the receptor-associated proteins, termed adaptors (e.g. IRS-1, Gab, and Cbl). These phosphotyrosine residues then act as binding sites for specific SH2 domain-containing effector molecules (15Hawkins P.T. Anderson K.E. Davidson K. Stephens L.R. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2006; 34: 647-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). The SH2 domain of p85α binds to phosphotyrosine residues contained in the sequence pYXXM (where pY is phosphotyrosine) on receptor tyrosine kinases or adaptor molecules such as IRS-1 (16Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2370) Google Scholar). This binding relieves both the basal inhibition of p110 by p85 and recruits the p85-p110 heterodimer to the plasma membrane (17Yu J. Wjasow C. Backer J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30199-30203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) where it phosphorylates phosphoinositide 4,5-bisphosphate generating phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (18Cantrell D.A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1439-1445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition p85 can interact with other adaptors such as Gab2 that function to recruit the p85·p110 complex to the plasma membrane (18Cantrell D.A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1439-1445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), resulting in an increase in the PI3K enzymatic activity. Various proteins that contain SH3 domains (e.g. Lyn, Fyn, Abl, and Lck) have been shown to bind to the proline-rich region of p85 (19Kapeller R. Prasad K.V. Janssen O. Hou W. Schaffhausen B.S. Rudd C.E. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1927-1933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and activate PI3K (20Pleiman C.M. Hertz W.M. Cambier J.C. Science. 1994; 263: 1609-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Activation of BaF3 cells by interleukin 3 recruits p85 to the plasma membrane via a complex scaffold formed by three adaptor proteins, Shc, Grb2, and Gab2, and formation of this complex results in PI 3-kinase activation (21Gu H. Maeda H. Moon J.J. Lord J.D. Yoakim M. Nelson B.H. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7109-7120Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Thus, the recruitment and activation of PI3K can be accomplished by multiple distinct pathways. In most cell types IGF-I activation of PI3K is dependent on phosphorylation of the adaptor protein IRS-1 that subsequently associates with p85α and functions to recruit the p85·p110 complex to the cell membrane. However, hyperglycemia reduces tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 (5Maile L.A. Capps B.E. Ling Y. Xi G. Clemmons D.R.

Because hyperglycemia has been shown to enhance the ability of IGF-I to stimulate Shc activation and cell migration, this study was undertaken to determine whether Shc activation and subsequent Shc-Grb2 association played a role in PI3K activation and whether Grb2 association with p85 was required for IGF-I-stimulated cell migration.

Unlabeled ATP was purchased from Sigma, and [γ-32P]ATP was from GE Healthcare. Two synthetic peptides containing the protein transduction domain 4 (27Ho A. Schwarze S.R. Mermelstein S.J. Waksman G. Dowdy S.F. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 474-477PubMed Google Scholar) and one of two proline-rich regions of the p85α subunit, YARAAARQARA82SPPTPKPRPPRPLPV97 (underlined and hereafter referred to as peptide 264) and YARAAARQARA300-ERQPAPALPPKPPKPT315 (underlined and hereafter referred to as peptide 265), were synthesized by the Protein Chemistry Core Facility at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Purity and sequence confirmation were determined by mass spectrometry. Cell Culture—Porcine VSMCs were isolated from the porcine aortic explants and were maintained as described previously (28Parker A. Gockerman A. Busby W.H. Clemmons D.R. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 2470-2476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in DMEM-high glucose (25 mm) growth medium (referred to as HG) or DMEM-normal glucose (5 mm) growth medium (referred to as NG) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT) and 100 μg/ml streptomycin and 100 units/ml penicillin. Both media were supplemented with 1.0 mm pyruvate. Cultured VSMCs were used between passages 4 and 12. Generation of pLenti Expression Vectors pLenti-HA-p52Shc/Wild Type (Shc-WT) and pLenti-HA-p52Shc/3F (Shc-3F)—pcDNA-p52Shc/WT and pcDNA-p52Shc/3F (Shc/Y239F/Y240F/Y317F) constructs were kindly provided by Dr. Kenneth Yamada (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Mutation of these three tyrosine phosphorylation sites has been shown to generate a dominant negative inhibitor of Shc signaling (29Kim B. Cheng H.L. Margolis B. Feldman E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34543-34550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The full-length Shc-WT and Shc-3F cDNAs were prepared and ligated into the pLenti vector as described previously (3Ling Y. Maile L.A. Lieskovska J. Badley-Clarke J. Clemmons D.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 3353-3364Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly VSMCs expressing these cDNAs were prepared as described previously (3Ling Y. Maile L.A. Lieskovska J. Badley-Clarke J. Clemmons D.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 3353-3364Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pLenti-HA-p85α Wild Type (p85-WT), pLenti-HA-p85α Mutant Proline Region 1 (p85-P1), and pLenti-HA-p85α Mutant Proline Region 2 (p85-P2)—Human p85α DNA was obtained by PCR using first strand cDNA transcribed from HepG2 cell total RNA. The full-length p85α wild type was cloned into the expression vector pLenti-6DV5 using TOPO methodology as reported previously (30Kwon M. Ling Y. Maile L.A. Badley-Clark J. Clemmons D.R. Endocrinology. 2006; 147: 1458-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Using 100 ng of pLenti-p85 wild type as template, PCR amplification was carried out with forward primer 5′-caccatgagtgctgaggggtaccagtaca-3′ and reverse primer 5′-ttaagcgtaatctggaacatcgtatgggtatcgcctctgctgtgcatatactgggta-3′. The forward primer includes a Kozak sequence (in bold) followed by the ATG start site (underlined). The reverse primer contains the sequence encoding HA epitope (underlined) followed by the stop codon (in bold). The PCR product was cloned into the pENTR/D-TOPO Gateway vector according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). The complete sequence was verified by DNA sequencing (University of North Carolina Genome Analysis Facility, Chapel Hill, NC). Two independent mutants were made. In each mutant four prolines within p85α were mutated to alanines. For generating the first proline region mutant (p85-P1), prolines at positions 84, 87, 91, and 94 were mutated to alanine by double-stranded mutagenesis using the pENTRp85-WT as template. Two hundred nanograms of pENTRp85-WT was amplified by PCR using Pfx polymerase and complimentary primers (Invitrogen). The sequence of the forward primer was 5′-attggaaggaaaaaaatctcgGctcccacaGcaaagccccggGcacctcggGctcttcctgttgcaccag-3′, and the reverse primer was 5′-ctggtgcaacaggaagagCccgaggtgCccggggctttgCtgtgggagCcgagatttttttccttccaat-3′ where the capitalized bases indicate the substitutions. Similarly for generating the second proline region mutant (p85-P2), the prolines at positions 305, 308, 311, and 314 were mutated to alanine using the pENTRp85-WT as template. Two complimentary primers, forward primer 5′-gaatgaacgacagcctgcaGcagcactgGctcctaaaGcaccaaaaGctactactgtagccaacaacg-3′ and reverse primer 5′-cgttgttggctacagtagtagCttttggtgCtttaggagCcagtgctgCtgcaggctgtcgttcattc-3′ were used to generate the p85-P2 mutant. The capitalized bases indicate the substitutions. The mutant products were also sequenced to confirm the correct incorporation of the changes and transferred from the entry vector into pLentiCMV DEST vector (Invitrogen) using the LR Clonase reaction following the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). pLenti-Grb2 Wild Type (Grb2-WT) and pLenti-Grb2-WA Mutant—Full-length porcine Grb2 was generated using first strand cDNA transcribed from porcine vascular smooth muscle cell total RNA and cloned into the pENTR/D-TOPO Gateway entry vector according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). The forward and reverse primers used to generate the PCR product were: forward primer, 5′-caccatggaagccatcgccaaatatgac-3′; and reverse primer, 5′-ttaagcgtaatctggaacatcgtatgggtagacgttccggttcacgggggtgac-3′. The forward primer includes a Kozak sequence (bold) placed 5′ to the ATG (underlined) start site. The reverse primer contained the sequence encoding HA epitope (underlined) followed by the stop codon (bold). Using the pENTRGrb2-WT as template, the tryptophans at positions 36 and 193 were mutated to alanine (Grb2-WA) by double-stranded mutagenesis. PCR amplification was carried out using forward primer 5′-ttgaatgaagaatgtgatcagaacGCgtacaaagcagagctcaatg-3′ and reverse primer 5′-cattgagctctgctttgtacGCgttctgatcacattcttcattcaa-3′ where capitalized bases indicate the substitution W36A. Using the product with mutant W36A as template a second PCR was performed using forward primer 5′-ggataactcggaccccaacGCgtggaagggggcttgc-3′ and reverse primer 5′-gcaagccccttccacGCgttggggtccgagttatcc-3′ where the capitalized bases indicate the substitution W193A. After selection of correct clones based on sequencing, the cDNAs encoding the wild type and mutant protein were transferred from the entry vector into pLentiCMV DEST vector using the LR Clonase reaction following the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Generation of Virus Stocks—293FT cells (Invitrogen) were prepared for generation of virus stocks of each individual pLenti construct. Cells were plated at 5 × 106/75-cm2 plate (Corning Glassworks, Corning, NY) the day before transfection in the growth medium (DMEM-HG with 10% FBS, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin). On the day of transfection, the culture medium was replaced with 5 ml of Opti-MEM I (Invitrogen) without antibiotics or serum. DNA·Lipofectamine 2000 complexes for each transfection were prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). The next day, the medium containing the DNA·Lipofectamine 2000 complexes was removed and replaced with the growth medium. The virus-containing supernatants were harvested 48–72 h post-transfection and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C to pellet the cell debris. The supernatants were filtered and stored as 1-ml aliquots at –80 °C. Establishment of Porcine VSMCs Expressing pLenti Constructs—VSMCs (passage 4–5) were seeded at 3 × 105/well in each of two wells of a 6-well plate (Falcon catalog number 353046) the day before transduction. The viral stocks were thawed, and the viral complexes were precipitated as described previously (3Ling Y. Maile L.A. Lieskovska J. Badley-Clarke J. Clemmons D.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 3353-3364Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For transduction, the pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of growth medium, 1 μl of Polybrene (40 mg/ml) was added, and the mixture was incubated with the cells for 24 h. The virus-containing medium was removed and changed to 2 ml of growth medium for another 24 h and then replaced with selection medium (growth medium containing 4 μg/ml blasticidin). The cultures were then grown to confluency and expanded for experiments or frozen for subsequent experiments. VSMCs expressing all the pLenti constructs and the nontransduced VSMCs used for peptide experiments were maintained in DMEM-HG. The expression of the HA-tagged Shc-WT, Shc-3F, p85-WT, p85-P1 and p85-P2 mutants, Grb2-WT, and Grb2-WA mutant were detected by immunoblotting using a 1:1000 dilution of anti-HA antibody and 30 μl of cell lysate. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Cells were seeded at 5 × 105 cells/10-cm plates (Discovery Labware) and then grown for 5 days to reach confluency. The cultures were incubated in serum-free DMEM-HG or DMEM-NG for 14–18 h before the addition of IGF-I (as indicated). In some experiments, nontransduced VSMCs were preincubated with or without the synthetic peptides that contained a region of sequence from p85 for 1 h before IGF-I was added. Similarly for experiments comparing the effect of glucose, nontransduced VSMCs that had been grown in HG or NG were placed in serum-free DMEM with the respective glucose concentration prior to initiation of the experiment. The VSMCs grown in NG were supplemented to 25 mm mannitol to control for differences in osmolarity. The cell monolayers were lysed in modified radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EGTA, 150 mm NaCl, and 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5)) in the presence of protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin) and phosphatase inhibitors (25 mm sodium fluoride and 2 mm sodium orthovanadate). The cell lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants containing crude membrane and cytosolic proteins were exposed to a 1:300 dilution of anti-Grb2, anti-HA, anti-SHPS-1, or anti-p85 antibody overnight at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were immobilized using protein A-Sepharose beads for 2 h at 4°C and washed three times with the same lysis buffer. The precipitated proteins were eluted in 40 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and separated by 8 or 11% SDS-PAGE. The proteins were then transferred to Immobilon-P membranes that had been blocked for 2 h in 5% milk or 3% bovine serum albumin in Tris-saline buffer with 0.2% Tween 20. The blots were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the antibody indicated (1:1000 for Tyr(P) mouse) and 1:1000 for anti-HA (rabbit), -Grb2 (mouse), -p85 (rabbit), -SHPS-1 (rabbit), or -Shc (mouse)). To detect phospho-AKT, 15 μg of protein from the cell lysate was removed before immunoprecipitation, mixed with 2× Laemmli sample buffer, and then separated by SDS-PAGE. Anti-phospho-AKT (Ser-473, Thr-308) (1:1000) was used to detect phosphorylated AKT, and total AKT protein was detected using an anti-AKT antibody (1:1000). The immune complexes were detected using either an anti-mouse (1:10,000) or anti-rabbit (1:20,000) horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody and developed with enhanced chemiluminescence following the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). The images obtained were also scanned using a DuoScan scanning densitometer (Agfa, Morstel, Belgium). Densitometric analyses of the images were determined using National Institutes of Health ImageJ, 1.37v. To determine differences in AKT phosphorylation, arbitrary scanning units obtained for phospho-AKT band intensities were divided by arbitrary scanning units obtained for total AKT or β-actin protein band intensities for each time point analyzed. The average values obtained from at least three independent experiments for each variable were pooled. PI 3-Kinase Assay—The confluent VSMC cultures were maintained in 0.2% FBS overnight and stimulated with IGF-I (50 or 100 ng/ml) for 10 min before cells were lysed. The cell lysates were prepared, and the PI 3-kinase complexes were immunoprecipitated as described above for immunoprecipitation of p85 or Grb2. The PI 3-kinase assay was performed as described previously (30Kwon M. Ling Y. Maile L.A. Badley-Clark J. Clemmons D.R. Endocrinology. 2006; 147: 1458-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Briefly the p85 or Grb2 immunoprecipitates were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, twice with lysis buffer, and once with the reaction buffer and resuspended in 50 μl of the reaction buffer (31Myers Jr., M.G. Sun X.J. Cheatham B. Jachna B.R. Glasheen E.M. Backer J.M. White M.F. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 1421-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The reaction was initiated by addition of 25 μl of ATP mixture containing 440 mm cold ATP, 30 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (GE Healthcare), and 20 μg of phosphatidylinositol (PI3K) substrate with 100 mm MgCl2 and then incubated for 10 min at 22 °C, and the reaction was stopped with addition of 20 μl of 8 n HCl. Then 160 μl of chloroform/methanol (1:1) was added to extract the lipid product from the reaction mixture, and the organic phase was spotted onto a thin layer chromatography plate (catalog number 05-713-318, Fischer Scientific) impregnated with 1% potassium oxylate and resolved by ascending chromatography (CHCl3: CH3OH:H2O:NH4OH at 60:47:11.3:2). The plates were dried, and the lipid products were identified by phosphorimaging and/or autoradiography. The radiolabeled PI3K spots were scraped, and the amount of radioactivity was quantitated by Cherenkov counting using a Beckman LS6500 scintillation counter. Cell Proliferation—Assessment of VSMC proliferation was performed as described previously (32Nam T.J. Busby Jr., W.H. Rees C. Clemmons D.R. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 1100-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Briefly VSMCs were plated at 3 × 104 cells/well in 24-well plates in serum-free medium containing 2% FBS and incubated overnight. The cultures were washed and then incubated in serum-free DMEM containing 0.2% platelet-poor plasma with or without IGF-I (50 ng/ml) for 48 h. Cell number in each well was counted after trypsinization. Each treatment was analyzed in triplicate. The results represent mean values of three independent experiments. Cell Wounding and Migration Assay—VSMCs were plated in 6-well dishes and grown to confluence. A monolayer of cells was wounded with a razor blade as described previously (33Jones J.I. Prevette T. Gockerman A. Clemmons D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2482-2487Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). After wounding, cells were rinsed twice in serum-free medium and incubated in serum-free medium containing 0.2% FBS with or without IGF-I at 100 ng/ml for 48 h at 37 °C. The cells were then fixed and stained (Diff-Quick, Dade Behring Inc., Newark, DE), and the number of cells that migrated at least 5 μm into the wound area was counted. At least five of the 10 previously selected 1-mm areas at the edge of the wound were counted for each data point. Each experiment was repeated three times. Statistical Analysis—Student's t test or the analysis of variance was used to compare the differences between the treatments as appropriate. The results t"
https://openalex.org/W1994945935,"The original report of chicken CXCR1 (Li, Q. J., Lu, S., Ye, R. D., and Martins-Green, M. (2000) Gene (Amst.) 257, 307–317) described it as a single exon gene, with two isoforms (differing in their start codon). In comparison with mammalian CXCR1, the reported chicken CXCR1 was longer at both the NH2 and COOH termini, and it lacked the conserved (C/S)CXNP motif present in the last transmembrane region of all known chemokine receptors. A re-evaluation of chicken CXCR1, comparing known expressed sequence tags with the chicken genome sequence, suggested that the gene contains two exons. We isolated a cDNA corresponding to our prediction, which was significantly different in sequence to the reported CXCR1. In particular, there were three frameshifts in our sequence, compared with the reported sequence, that restored higher identity in the COOH-terminal half of the protein to mammalian CXCR1 (61% total amino acid identity compared with 52% for the reported CXCR1), restored the (C/S)CXNP motif, and gave a predicted protein of the same length as mammalian CXCR1. In human, CXCR1 is the receptor for CXCL8. In the chicken, there are two syntenic genes, CXCLi1 and CXCLi2, which look equally like orthologues of human CXCL8. We demonstrate that both of these chemokines are ligands for chicken CXCR1. We also demonstrate that heterophils express chicken CXCR1 and that the receptor is Gαi protein-linked. The original report of chicken CXCR1 (Li, Q. J., Lu, S., Ye, R. D., and Martins-Green, M. (2000) Gene (Amst.) 257, 307–317) described it as a single exon gene, with two isoforms (differing in their start codon).

CXC chemokines can be classified according to the presence of the tripeptide motif glutamic acid-leucine-arginine (ELR) in the NH2-terminal region before the first conserved cysteine. In mammals, ELR+ chemokines are specific for polymorphonuclear leukocytes (2Hebert C.A. Vitangcol R.V. Baker J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18989-18994Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas ELR– chemokines attract a variety of leukocytes (3Olson T.S. Ley K. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: R7-R28Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar, 4Rossi D. Zlotnik A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 217-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (2101) Google Scholar). In mammals, ELR+ CXC chemokines bind to two receptors, CXCR1 and CXCR2, with different affinities. Both receptors are the principal expressed chemokine receptors on neutrophils. To understand the evolution of the chemokines and their receptors in concert with the evolution of different developmental and responsive modes of the immune system, the recently released chicken genome sequence (5Hillier L.W.

J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2005; 25: 467-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). All four classes of chemokines were identified in the chicken genome, although the total number, 24, was fewer than identified in human (42Suetomi K. Rojo D. Navarro J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31563-31566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) or mouse (35Molski T.F.P. Naccache P.H. Marsh M.L. Kermode J. Becker E.L. Sha'afi R.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 124: 644-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). For the homeostatic chemokines present, a clear orthologous relationship could be identified, suggesting conservation of function (8Kaiser P. Poh T.Y. Rothwell L. Avery S. Balu S. Pathania U.S. Hughes S. Goodchild M. Morrell S. Watson M. Bumstead N. Kaufman J. Young J.R. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2005; 25: 467-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). However, for the inflammatory chemokines, the relationships between the chicken chemokines and their mammalian homologues remain unclear (8Kaiser P. Poh T.Y. Rothwell L. Avery S. Balu S. Pathania U.S. Hughes S. Goodchild M. Morrell S. Watson M. Bumstead N. Kaufman J. Young J.R. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2005; 25: 467-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). All four classes of chemokine receptors were also identified in the chicken genome (8Kaiser P. Poh T.Y. Rothwell L. Avery S. Balu S. Pathania U.S. Hughes S. Goodchild M. Morrell S. Watson M. Bumstead N. Kaufman J. Young J.R. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2005; 25: 467-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), again with a smaller total repertoire (13 genes) in the chicken as compared with mammals. Similarly to the chemokines, the homeostatic chemokine receptors had obvious mammalian orthologues, whereas the relationships between the inflammatory chemokine receptors remain unclear. In the absence of clear orthologous relationships with human counterparts, Kaiser et al. (8Kaiser P. Poh T.Y. Rothwell L. Avery S. Balu S. Pathania U.S. Hughes S. Goodchild M. Morrell S. Watson M.

Interferon Cytokine Res. 2005; 25: 467-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) proposed a systematic nomenclature for the putative chicken inflammatory chemokines and their chemokine receptors. They were classified according to the classes of chemokine to which they belong (for example CC or CXC), followed by L for ligand and R for receptor. The chemokines were then followed by an “i” for presumed inflammatory function and a number based on the chromosomal location of the gene. A similar nomenclature was given for the receptors, in this case using sequential letters indicating chromosomal location to differentiate between them. Chicken (ch) 2The abbreviations used are: ch, chicken; RT, reverse transcription; HA, hemagglutinin; PHA, phytohemagglutinin; ConA, concanavalin A; UTR, untranslated region; hu, human; PMA, phorbol myristate acetate; Iono, ionomycin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; EST, expressed sequence tag. CXCLi2 (chCAF (chemotactic and angiogenic factor), described previously as 9E3/CEF4) was the first chicken CXC chemokine identified. As its name suggests, it has both chemotactic and angiogenic functions in the chicken (9Sugano S. Stoeckle M.Y. Hanafusa H.

At low concentrations, chCAF is chemotactic for monocyte/macrophages and lymphocytes. However, at high concentrations chCAF also stimulates sprouting and growth of blood vessels (11Martins-Green M. Feugate J.E. Cytokine. 1998; 10: 522-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). It is most similar in sequence to human (hu) CXCL8 (interleukin-8) (50% amino acid identity) (14Kaiser P. Hughes S. Bumstead N. Immunogenetics. 1999; 49: 673-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Another CXCL chemokine, chCXCLi1 (K60), was later identified by differential gene expression analysis of lipopolysaccharide-stimulated and unstimulated cells of the chicken macrophage cell line HD11 (15Sick C. Schneider K. Staeheli P. Weining K.C. Cytokine. 2000; 12: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). chCXCLi1 is similar to chCXCLi2 (67% amino acid identity) and as similar as chCXCLi2 to huCXCL8 (48% amino acid identity) (15Sick C. Schneider K. Staeheli P. Weining K.C. Cytokine. 2000; 12: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Both chCXCLi1 and chCXCLi2 have the conserved ELR motif located upstream of the first cysteine residue. The genomic location of these two genes, which are adjacent, and their high sequence similarity suggest they have arisen as a duplication of an ancestral CXCL8 gene in the avian lineage (8Kaiser P. Poh T.Y. Rothwell L. Avery S. Balu S. Pathania U.S. Hughes S. Goodchild M. Morrell S. Watson M. Bumstead N. Kaufman J. Young J.R. J.

So far, a CXCL8 orthologue has yet to be identified in mouse and rat. Human CXCL8 binds to two receptors, huCXCR1 (17Holmes W.E. Lee J. Kuang W.J. Rice G.C. Wood W.I. Science. 1991; 253: 1278-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar) and huCXCR2 (18Murphy P.M. Tiffany H.L. Science. 1991; 253: 1280-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar), with high affinity (19Lee J. Horuk R. Rice G.C. Bennett G.L. Camerato T. Wood W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16283-16287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A chicken cDNA encoding a seven-transmembrane domain protein resembling a chemokine receptor, which had 53 and 52% amino acid sequence identity to huCXCR1 and huCXCR2, respectively, was described by Li et al. (1Li Q.J. Lu S. Ye R.D. Martins-Green M. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 257: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Using 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends, Li et al. (1Li Q.J. Lu S. Ye R.D. Martins-Green M. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 257: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) claimed that chCXCR1 was expressed from an intronless gene, as they identified different isoforms differing in the transcriptional start point and consequently utilizing different start codons. The isoform 1 transcript was 438 bp longer than that of isoform 2. Isoform 1 was expressed in bursa, brain, liver, pancreas, small intestine, large intestine, stomach (sic), and embryonic fibroblasts (1Li Q.J. Lu S. Ye R.D. Martins-Green M. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 257: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The chCXCR1 isoform 1 receptor was expressed in murine NIH3T3 cells, on which it conferred the ability to respond to recombinant chCXCLi2, with increased intracellular calcium and ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) 1/2 phosphorylation (20Li Q.J. Yao M. Dueck M. Feugate J.E. Parpura V. Martins-Green M. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2005; 77: 421-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Closer analysis of the published chCXCR1 sequence revealed several anomalies in the context of knowledge of mammalian CXCR. Most CXCR genes (including human CXCR1) have two exons, with a single intron in the 5′-UTR sequence. The published chCXCR1 was described as a single exon gene. The published chCXCR1 isoform 1 sequence is longer at both the NH2 and COOH termini as compared with huCXCR1. The published chCXCR1 COOH terminus is proline-rich, which would be unique among chemokine receptors. Finally, a conserved (C/S)CXNP motif present in the last transmembrane region of all known chemokine receptors was absent in the published chCXCR1. We therefore decided to re-examine chicken CXCR1. Isolation of Chicken Peripheral Blood Monocytes and Heterophils—Isolation of monocytes was carried out according to Wigley et al. (21Wigley P. Hulme S.D. Bumstead N. Barrow P.A. Microbes Infect. 2002; 4: 1111-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Isolation of heterophils was carried out according to Kogut et al. (22Kogut M.H. McGruder E.D. Hargis B.M. Corrier D.E. DeLoach J.R. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1995; 57: 56-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Stimulation of Splenocytes, Thymocytes, and Bursal Cells with Mitogen—Single-cell suspensions were obtained from 8-week-old line C.B12 chicken spleens, bursae, and thymuses by passing through a nylon filter. Lymphocytes were then extracted using Histopaque 1119, washed three times with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and adjusted to 5 × 106 cells/ml (10 ml/flask). Mitogen was then added to each flask to a final concentration of concanavalin A (ConA) (1 μg/ml), phytohemagglutinin (PHA) (12 μg/ml), or phorbol myristate acetate + ionomycin (PMA + Iono) (800 and 100 ng/ml, respectively). The cultures were incubated at 41 °C, 5% CO2 for 6 h. The cells were then scraped off the flask, washed three times in PBS, and RNA-extracted using a Qiagen RNeasy kit. Determination of the Structure of the chCXCR1 Gene—Inserts of a cDNA library prepared from purified splenocytes from a juvenile line 0 chicken and cloned into the mammalian cell expression vector pcInX were excised with XhoI and ligated with mismatch adapters as described (23Tregaskes C.A. Glansbeek H.L. Gill A.C. Hunt L.G. Burnside J. Young J.R. Dev. Comp. Immunol. 2005; 29: 361-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The sequences of a chCXCR1 EST (CK607506) and of the chCXCR1 genomic DNA were used to design internal PCR primers corresponding to the 5′-UTR and 3′-coding regions (5′-GAATCTGGGAGCTGGGAA-3′ and 5′-TCAGAGGGTGGTGGAGGTG-3′, respectively). These were used to amplify chCXCR1 from the cDNA library in combination with an adapter primer (5′-GCAGGAATTCGATATCAAGC-3′). Nested PCR was then carried out with nested primers (5′-AGATTTGGATTGCGGCAG-3′ and 5′-CCGATGAAGCCGTAGATGAT-3′, respectively) (Fig. 1). Cycling conditions were as follows: initial denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 15 s, 56 °C for 15 s and 72 °C for 2 min, with a final extension of 72 °C for 6 min. PCR products were TA-cloned (Invitrogen TOPO TA cloning kit) into the vector pCR2.1 and sequenced. One-step RT-PCR was carried out using Ready-to-Go RT-PCR beads (Amersham Biosciences). Primers were designed spanning the start (5′-ATGGGGACATTTTACGCTGA-3′) and stop (5′-TCAGAGGGTGGTGGAGGTG-3′) codons of chCXCR1. RNA was extracted using a Qiagen RNeasy kit from spleens of line C.B12 and 72 chickens. Genomic DNA from line N chickens was used as a positive control. One-step RT-PCR was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions except that betaine (Sigma) was added to the PCR mixture to a final concentration of 1 m. The resulting PCR products were then TA-cloned and sequenced. Reverse transcriptase-negative controls were carried out according to the manufacturer's protocol. The sequences of chCXCR1 for line 72, N, and C.B12 chickens were then deposited into ENSEMBL (accession numbers AJ973196, AJ973197 and AJ973198, respectively). Expression of chCXCR1 in Tissues, Mitogen-stimulated Lymphoid Tissues, Monocytes, and Heterophils by One-step RT-PCR—A panel of tissues (bursa, thymus, spleen, bone marrow, brain, cecum, cecal tonsil, liver, kidney, upper ileum, lower ileum, large intestine, muscle, skin, trachea, pancreas, proventriculus, heart, lung, duodenum, esophagus, and crop) were collected from 2-week-old Rhode Island Red chickens. RNA was extracted from these tissues using a Qiagen RNeasy kit as well as from heterophils, monocytes, and mitogen-stimulated lymphoid tissues, isolated as described above. One-step RT-PCR was carried out using Ready-to-Go RT-PCR beads (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions, using the following primers: 5′-TGGCAATGAGAATACCACCA-3′ and 5′-CCGATGAAGCCGTAGATGAT-3′. RNA concentrations were standardized using β-actin primers spanning an intron as follows: 5′-TGCTGTGTTCCCATCTATCG-3′ and 5′-TGGTGACAATACCGTGTTCA-3′. Generation of a Hemagglutinin-tagged chCXCR1 Clone—The chicken CXCR1 gene was amplified from line N genomic DNA by PCR using the sense primer 5′-ATTAAAGAATTCGGGACATTTTACGCTGAC-3′ and the antisense primer 5′-TATCTCTCTAGATTAGGATGCTGGGGTCCG-3′ and TA-cloned (Topo.TA cloning kit, Invitrogen). The chCXCR1 cDNA was then excised from the TOPO vector with EcoRI (New England Biolabs) and XbaI (New England Biolabs) and then ligated into the same sites of a modified pcDNA3 vector containing a hemagglutinin epitope 5′ to the multiple cloning site (24de Mendonca F.L. da Fonseca P.C.A.

Expression of Recombinant chCXCLi1 and chCXCLi2—ChCXCLi1 and chCXCLi2 were transiently expressed in COS-7 cells as described previously (25Lawson S. Rothwell L. Lambrecht B. Howes K. Venugopal K.

Transient Expression of chCXCR1 in Murine L1.2 Cell Line—The murine pre-B cell line L1.2 was maintained in HEPES-modified RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in 5% CO2 as described previously (27Ponath P.D.

Williams T.J. Pease J.E. Eur. J. Immunol. 2003; 33: 2927-2936Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). To enhance cell surface receptor expression, transient transfectants were cultured for 24 h in medium supplemented with 10 mm sodium butyrate (Sigma) prior to use. Cells were analyzed for chemokine receptor expression by flow cytometry. Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorter Analysis of Chemokine Receptor Expression—Approximately 5 × 105 cells were harvested, washed once with fluorescence-activated cell sorting buffer (0.25% bovine serum albumin and 0.01% NaN3 in PBS), and then incubated with either 10 μg/ml of murine monoclonal anti-human CXCR1 clone 42705.111 (Sigma) or murine monoclonal anti-HA clone 16B12 (Covance) for 20 min in a final volume of 100 μl. Cells were then washed with fluorescence-activated cell sorting buffer and incubated with the fluorescein isothiocyanate-coupled secondary antibody (1:20 diluted goat polyclonal anti-mouse IgG from Dako) for 20 min in a final volume of 100 μl. Subsequently, cells were washed with fluorescence-activated cell sorting buffer and resuspended in a final volume of 500 μl before being analyzed by flow cytometry as described previously (29Auger G.A. Pease J.E. Shen X.Y. Xanthou G. Barker M.D. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 1052-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). All incubations were carried out on ice. Assays of Chemotactic Responsiveness—Assays of chemotactic responsiveness were carried out as described previously (30Tiffany H.L. Lautens L.L. Gao J.L. Pease J. Locati M. Combadiere C. Modi W. Bonner T.I. Murphy P.M. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) using 96-well chemotaxis plates with 5-μm pores (Receptor Technologies, Adderbury, UK). Cells were harvested and washed twice with PBS and then resuspended in serum-free HEPES modified RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma). Cells (20,000) were loaded in a total volume of 20 μl into the upper compartment of a microchemotaxis chamber. Chemoattractants were loaded in a final volume of 31 μl at increasing concentrations in the lower compartment. The two compartments were separated by a polyvinylpyrrolidone-free polycarbonate filter with 5-μm pores. The chemotaxis chamber was incubated in a humidified chamber at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 5 h. The filter was then removed, and the number of cells migrating into each bottom compartment was counted using a hemocytometer. All conditions were tested in duplicate. For chemotaxis assays in 24-well transwell plates (Corning Inc.), wells were first blocked with 600 μl of RPMI 1640 medium containing 1% BSA for 20 min. Chemoattractants were then diluted 1:10 in RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.1% BSA and 600 μl loaded into the lower wells. Wells containing filter bases with 5-μm pores were placed onto the chemoattractants. RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.1% BSA and 2.5 × 106 cells in 100-μl total volume was loaded into the upper wells and the plate incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 4 h. Treatment of Heterophils with Pertussis Toxin—Briefly, cells were treated with 1 μg of pertussis toxin (Sigma)/106 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.1% BSA for 1 h at 37°C. Cells were washed with a 5-fold excess of RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.1% BSA and centrifuged at 250 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Cells were then resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.1% BSA and used in chemotaxis assays. Determination of the Gene Structure of chCXCR1—As described earlier, most CXCR genes (including human CXCR1) have two exons, with a single intron in the 5′-UTR sequence (Fig. 1A). The published chCXCR1 (1Li Q.J. Lu S. Ye R.D. Martins-Green M. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 257: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) was described as a single exon gene, with two isoforms. The isoform 1 sequence was longer at both the NH2 and COOH termini as compared with huCXCR1 (Fig. 1B). We decided to reassess chicken CXCR1. A chicken EST blast search with the reported isoform 2 sequence (1Li Q.J. Lu S. Ye R.D. Martins-Green M. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 257: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) identified three EST sequences (BX258468, CB018048, and CK607506). When aligned with the published chCXCR1, one of these, CK607506, suggested the presence of an intron in the published chCXCR1 isoform 1 sequence (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, alignment of the published sequence, the EST sequences, and the chicken genome sequence revealed several inconsistencies. Primers were then designed flanking the predicted intron, and nested PCR was carried out on cDNA libraries (Fig. 1A). Alignment of the resulting sequences with the EST sequences and the published chCXCR1 sequences (Fig. 2) confirmed that the chCXCR1 gene has two exons. The sequencing results also indicated an alternative splice acceptor site present in the 5′-UTR as compared with the EST sequence (Fig. 2). All three ESTs were different from the published chCXCR1 sequence but identical to the chicken genome sequence. ESTs BX258468 and CB018048 were 5′-truncated and did not extend into the intron. Primers were then designed spanning the predicted coding sequence, and the full coding sequence of chCXCR1 was determined by two methods: single-step RT-PCR from splenic mRNA from two lines (72 and C.B12) of chickens and PCR from line N chicken genomic DNA. All three templates generated a PCR product that was then sequenced. The predicted amino acid sequences are shown aligned with the previously published chCXCR1 sequence in Fig. 3. The differences to the published sequence give changes in four amino acid codons in the first half of the protein and three frameshifts in the remainder, leading to changes in transmembrane regions and a shorter coding region overall, with the COOH terminus of our chCXCR1 sequence aligning with those of human CXCR1 and CXCR2 (Fig. 3). The four amino acids changes to the published chCXCR1 isoform 2 sequence are conserved between human CXCR1 and CXCR2 and our CXCR1 sequence (Fig. 3). The alignment also reveals a conserved motif, (C/S)CXNP, in the last transmembrane region, which is typical of chemokine receptors and is present in our chCXCR1 sequence and the human CXCR1 and CXCR2 sequences, but not in the published chCXCR1 isoform sequence (Fig. 3). Expression Profiles of chCXCR1—One-step RT-PCR was carried out to determine the expression profile of chCXCR1 in a panel of tissues, cells, and mitogen-stimulated lymphoid cells. chCXCR1 mRNA was expressed in several lymphoid tissues (bursa, spleen, bone marrow, and cecal tonsil). It was also expressed in the cecum, ileum, and large intestine (Fig. 4) but at low levels. chCXCR1 mRNA was also detected in the brain but again at low levels (Fig. 4). It was expressed in monocytes and heterophils (Fig. 4, lanes 24 and 25). Upon stimulation with ConA or PHA, chCXCR1 mRNA expression was slightly up-regulated in bursal cells. In splenocytes, chCXCR1 expression was down-regulated in all mitogen-stimulated samples, especially after stimulation with PMA + ionomycin (Fig. 4). chCXCR1 was not expressed in thymocytes (Fig. 4, lane 34). However, after stimulation with mitogen, chCXCR1 expression was detected at low levels (Fig. 4, lanes 35–37). chCXCR1 Is the Orthologue of huCXCR1 and Transfected L1.2 Cells Expressing chCXCR1 Chemotaxed toward huCXCL8, chCXCLi1 and chCXCLi2—To determine whether chCXCLi1 and chCXCLi2 are ligands for chCXCR1, and if chCXCR1 is the orthologue of huCXCR1, pcDNA3 containing either recombinant HA-tagged chCXCR1 or FLAG-tagged huCXCR1 was transfected into murine L1.2 cells (which do not respond to huCXCL8 (31Okajima F. Katada T. Ui M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 6761-6768Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) for transient expression of the receptors. pcDNA3 containing HA-tagged huCCR1 and pcDNA3 alone were included as controls. Expression of the receptors was measured by flow cytometry (Fig. 5). chCXCR1 was transiently expressed in the cells at high levels, with ∼50% of the cells being transfected (Fig. 5A). As positive controls, L1.2 cells were transfected with HA-tagged huCCR1 (Fig. 5B) and FLAG-tagged huCXCR1 (Fig. 5D). pcDNA3 was transfected into L1.2 murine cells as a mock control and stained negative throughout the experiment (Fig. 5C). Once demonstrated as positively transfected, the cells were then used in chemotaxis assays. To determine the ligand-receptor relationships, the responsiveness of HA-chCXCR1 or FLAG-huCXCR1 L1.2 transfectants to purified recombinant huCXCL8, chCXCLi1, chCXCLi2, or a mock control was determined by transwell chemotaxis assays. Fig. 6A shows that both huCXCR1 and chCXCR1 transfectants respond to huCXCL8 in a dose-dependent manner. The huCXCR1 transfectants had a typical prozone response, with lowered migration at higher concentrations of huCXCL8. The responsiveness of FLAG-huCXCR1 and HA-chCXCR1 expressing transfectants to chCXCLi1 and chCXCLi2, the predicted ligands for chCXCR1, was also tested. Both chCXCLi1 and chCXCLi2 induced the chemotaxis of chCXCR1 transfectants, but not huCXCR1 transfectants, in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6B), confirming the functional relationship between chCXCR1 and the ligands chCXCLi1 and chCXCLi2.

Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified dynein light chain 1 as a novel interacting partner of RACK1. Additionally, we demonstrated that RACK1 formed a complex with DLC1 and Bim, specifically BimEL, in the presence of apoptotic agents. Upon paclitaxel treatment, RACK1, DLC1, and CIS mediated the degradation of BimEL through the ElonginB/C-Cullin2-CIS ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase complex. We further showed that RACK1 conferred paclitaxel resistance to breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we observed an inverse correlation between CIS and BimEL levels in both ovarian and breast cancer cell lines and specimens. Our study suggests a role of RACK1 in protecting cancer cells from apoptosis by regulating the degradation of BimEL, which together with CIS could play an important role of drug resistance in chemotherapy.

Bim (Bcl-2-interacting mediator of cell death), a BH3 domain-containing protein, is expressed predominantly in hematopoietic, neuronal, and epithelial cells (1O'Reilly L.A. Cullen L. Visvader J. Lindeman G.J. Print C. Bath M.L. Huang D.C. Strasser A. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 157: 449-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Bim has at least 18 different splicing variants, among which BimEL (extra long), BimL (long), and BimS (short) are the three major isoforms (2Adachi M. Zhao X. Imai K. Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 192-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). BimL and BimEL expression are tightly regulated at both the transcriptional and posttranslational levels. Transcriptionally, growth factors can down-regulate Bim mRNA expression through the Akt-FOXO3 pathway (3Dijkers P.F. Medema R.H. Lammers J.W. Koenderman L. Coffer P.J. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1201-1204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). Posttranslationally, under normal conditions, Bim is regulated either by binding to microtubules via DLC1 (dynein light chain 1) (4Puthalakath H. Huang D.C. O'Reilly L.A. King S.M. Strasser A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 287-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar) or by directly binding to 14-3-3 (5Qi X.J. Wildey G.M. Howe P.H. J. Biol.

Upon apoptotic stimulation, Bim is released from the microtubules and translocates to the mitochondrial outer membrane. There, Bim promotes apoptosis (4Puthalakath H. Huang D.C. O'Reilly L.A.

Cell. 1999; 3: 287-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar) either through inhibition of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins, such as Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl1 (6Gomez-Bougie P. Bataille R. Amiot M. Eur. J. Immunol. 2005; 35: 971-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), or through activation of pro-apoptotic proteins, such as Bax (7Harada H. Quearry B. Ruiz-Vela A. Korsmeyer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 15313-15317Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). It has been shown that Bim functions as a tumor suppressor and is also a determinant in paclitaxel sensitivity in both renal carcinoma (8Tan T.T. Degenhardt K. Nelson D.A. Beaudoin B. Nieves-Neira W.

Bim-null mice are generally healthy and fertile, although the number of Bim–/– offspring is only about 50% of the normal counterparts. The major defect of these mice is the dysregulation of leukocyte homeostasis, leading to systematic lupus erythematosus-like autoimmune disease in aged mice (10Bouillet P. Metcalf D. Huang D.C.

RACK1, a 7-WD motif-containing protein, regulates numerous cellular properties through its multiple downstream effectors. RACK1 is an important component of the ribosome and has been shown to regulate protein synthesis (11Sengupta J. Nilsson J. Gursky R. Spahn C.M. Nissen P. Frank J. Nat. Struct. Mol.

Nature. 2003; 426: 579-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Through different signaling pathways, RACK1 is involved in controlling apoptosis and contributes to tumor growth in vivo. First, RACK1 has been shown to mediate c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation via protein kinase C and promote melanoma growth in nude mice (13Lopez-Bergami P. Habelhah H. Bhoumik A. Zhang W. Wang L.H. Ronai Z. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 309-320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Second, RACK1 forms a complex with insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptors to regulate STAT3 activation and mediates insulin receptor/insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor-induced protection against apoptosis of ovarian cancer cells (14Zhang W. Zong C.S. Hermanto U. Lopez-Bergami P. Ronai Z. Wang L.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 413-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Additionally, RACK1 interacts with p73 and prevents p73-mediated cell death (15Ozaki T. Watanabe K. Nakagawa T. Miyazaki K. Takahashi M. Nakagawara A. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 3231-3242Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Finally, RACK1 interacts with E1A and rescues E1A-induced yeast growth inhibition and mammalian cell apoptosis (16Sang N.

The specificity of proteasome-mediated protein degradation is determined by distinct E3 ligase complexes. The SOCS (suppressor of cytokine signaling)-box-containing E3 ligase family members are composed of ElonginB/C and Cullin2 or Cullin5 and SOCS-1 or SOCS-3. Together, they form the ECS (ElonginB/C-Cullin-SOCS-box)-Roc complex (20Willems A.R. Schwab M. Tyers M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1695: 133-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Besides SOCS-1 and SOCS-3, CIS (cytokine-inducible Src homology 2 domain-containing protein) also has the SOCS-box domain and could potentially be part of the E3 complex (21Kamizono S. Hanada T. Yasukawa H. Minoguchi S. Kato R. Minoguchi M. Hattori K. Hatakeyama S. Yada M. Morita S. Kitamura T. Kato H. Nakayama K. Yoshimura A. J. Biol.

Overexpression of CIS has been shown to suppress BCR/ABL-mediated cell transformation, whereas proteasome inhibitors relieved the suppressive phenotype, hinting at the involvement of CIS in proteasome-mediated protein degradation (22Tauchi T. Yoshimura A. Ohyashiki K. Exp. Hematol. 2001; 29: 356-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). CIS has been shown to be overexpressed in breast cancer lines and in breast carcinomas (23Raccurt M. Tam S.P. Lau P. Mertani H.C. Lambert A. Garcia-Caballero T. Li H. Brown R.J. McGuckin M.A. Morel G. Waters M.J. Br. J. Cancer. 2003; 89: 524-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In the CIS transgenic model, the mice displayed aberrantly increased CD4+ T cell population, prolonged survival of T cells after T cell receptor activation (24Li S. Chen S. Xu X. Sundstedt A. Paulsson K.M. Anderson P. Karlsson S. Sjogren H.O. Wang P. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 985-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and shifted Th1 versus Th2 T cell balance (25Matsumoto A. Seki Y. Kubo M. Ohtsuka S. Suzuki A. Hayashi I. Tsuji K. Nakahata T. Okabe M. Yamada S. Yoshimura A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6396-6407Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). This implies an independent role of CIS other than that in inhibiting the well known cytokine signaling, such as that mediated by interleukin-2, interleukin-3, and growth hormone. CIS transgenic mice resemble the phenotype of Bim-null mice in terms of T cell proliferation and survival (10Bouillet P. Metcalf D. Huang D.C. Tarlinton D.M. Kay T.W. Kontgen F. Adams J.M. Strasser A. Science. 1999; 286: 1735-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (1304) Google Scholar), pointing to a functional relationship between CIS and Bim. To identify novel interacting partners of RACK1, yeast two-hybrid screening was performed. We found that DLC1 interacted with RACK1. Subsequently, we observed that DLC1 interacted with RACK1 upon apoptotic stimulation in mammalian cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated that RACK1 formed a complex with DLC1 and BimEL in the presence of paclitaxel. Moreover, RACK1 promoted proteasome-mediated BimEL degradation via a Cullin/CIS E3 ligase complex. Our study suggests that RACK1 plays an important role in protecting stress or apoptotic agent-treated cancer cells from apoptosis through degradation of BimEL, which may contribute to tumor formation in vivo and drug resistance during cancer therapy. Cells and DNA Transfection—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells, ovarian cancer line SKOV3, colon carcinoma-derived ovarian metastasis line SW626, and breast cancer stable cell lines MDA-MB-468, MCF7, and MCF7-I4 were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma). Briefly, MCF7-I4 cells were derived from MCF7 by consecutive cycles of selection of invasive MCF7 cells through a Matrigel-coated Boyden chamber (26Cheng G.Z. Chan J. Wang Q. Zhang W. Sun C.D. Wang L.H. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 1979-1987Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). SKOV3, SW626, and MCF7 were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's (Invitrogen) instructions, HEK293T cells were transfected by calcium phosphate coprecipitation methods, and MB-MDA-468 cells were transfected by FuGENE reagent (Roche). Plasmids and Their Construction—phEF-RACK1-HA has been described previously (27Hermanto U. Zong C.S. Li W. Wang L.H. Mol. Cell.

Anti-HA antibody was purchased from the Hybridoma Center at Mount Sinai School of Medicine. Preparation of Cell Lysates, Immunoprecipitation, SDS-PAGE, and Immunoblotting—For direct immunoblot analysis, cell lysates were prepared with ice-cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, 5 mm EDTA, 1% aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.4 mm phenylarsine oxide, and 25 mm NaF). For coimmunoprecipitation, cell lysates were prepared with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% aprotinin). Cell lysates or immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with appropriate antibodies as described (14Zhang W. Zong C.S. Hermanto U. Lopez-Bergami P. Ronai Z. Wang L.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 413-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 27Hermanto U. Zong C.S. Li W. Wang L.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2345-2365Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). RNA Interference—Double-stranded siRNA construction and synthesis as well as pRS-shRNA of RACK1 for preparation of MCF7-I4 stable clones have been described previously (13Lopez-Bergami P. Habelhah H.

Wang L.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 413-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The construction and synthesis of double-stranded siRNA of CIS and DLC1 were according to the manufacturer's instruction (Ambion). The target sequence for the CIS siRNA template is 5′-AATGTACGCATTGAGTATGCC-3′; the target sequences for DLC1 are 5′-AACATAGAGAAGGACATTGCG-3′ and 5′-AACTTCGGTAGTTATGTGACA-3′. Annexin V Staining Assay—MCF7-I4 cells that stably overexpress RACK1 and control phEF clones were seeded at 1 × 106 cells and cultured at 37 °C overnight. 200 nm paclitaxel was added into the medium to treat the cells for 72 h. Cells were collected and double-stained with propidium iodide and anti-annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate according to the manufacturer's instructions (BD Biosciences). FACS analysis was performed to count the apoptotic cells that were stained with annexin V but not with propidium iodide. Colony Formation Assay and Anoikis Assay—MCF7-I4 cells that stably overexpress RACK1 or MCF7 cells transiently transfected with RACK1 siRNA or CIS siRNA were trypsinized, counted, and resuspended. 5 × 104 cells were used for a colony formation assay (27Hermanto U. Zong C.S. Li W. Wang L.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2345-2365Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) with or without addition of paclitaxel (10 nm), and 106 cells were used for anoikis assay as described (28Uttamsingh S. Zong C.S. Wang L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18798-18810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). For quantifying the colony formation assay, the total area of colonies was quantified by ImageTool software; for anoikis assay, cells were stained with trypan blue, and dead cells were counted with a hemocytometer. In Vivo Tumor Growth—BALB/c nude mice were injected with 1 × 106 MCF7-I4-phEF or MCF7-I4-RACK1–3 cells (five mice in each group) in the flank subcutaneously. Tumor growth was monitored by measuring three dimensions and calculated as follows: tumor volume (mm3) = length × width × height × 0.52. 18 days after injection, mice were injected intraperitoneally with either blank vehicle solution or 5 mg/kg paclitaxel (stock solution is formulated with 50% ethanol and 50% Cremophor EL (10 mg/ml), diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride to 0.5 mg/ml for injection). At the end point, mice were sacrificed, and tumors were dissected for tumor weight measuring and protein extraction for biochemical analysis. In all experiments, a two-tailed t test assuming equal variances for non-paired samples was used withα = 0.05; the exact p values were indicated in individual figures. The animal experiments were performed under the protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Mount Sinai School of Medicine. The collection of anonymous tumor samples was according to the institutional review board-approved waived human subject protocol at the University of Southern Florida. RACK1 Associated with DLC1 and BimEL upon Apoptotic Stimulation—To identify novel interacting partners for RACK1, we performed a yeast two-hybrid assay and found that DLC1 interacted with RACK1. Coimmunoprecipitation assay was carried out in HEK293T cells transiently transfected with FLAG-DLC1 to confirm the yeast two-hybrid result. The interaction between RACK1 and DLC1 was detected upon treatment of the cells with UV irradiation, paclitaxel, or staurosporine (Fig. 1A). Based on this observation and a previous report of the Bim-DLC1 complex (4Puthalakath H. Huang D.C. O'Reilly L.A. King S.M. Strasser A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 287-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that RACK1 may be involved in the regulation of Bim-DLC1-related apoptosis. To test our hypothesis, we first examined whether RACK1 also interacted with Bim. In MCF7 breast cancer cells, endogenous RACK1 was able to be coimmunoprecipitated with anti-Bim antibody, which was greatly enhanced upon paclitaxel or staurosporine treatment (Fig. 1B). As previously reported by Puthalakath et al. (4Puthalakath H. Huang D.C. O'Reilly L.A. King S.M. Strasser A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 287-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar), endogenous DLC1 associated with BimEL constitutively in HEK293T cells (Fig. 1C). Interaction between endogenous DLC1 and RACK1 was significantly enhanced by paclitaxel treatment (Fig. 1C). To examine whether RACK1 can interact with DLC1 and BimEL directly, in vitro binding assays were carried out with GST-DLC1, His-RACK1 or its C-terminal deletion mutant His-WD1–4, the N-terminal deletion mutant His-WD5–7, and His-BimEL. These constructs were expressed and purified from Escherichia coli. An equal amount of GST-DLC1 was incubated with GST (negative protein control), RACK1, or its deletion mutants. His-RACK1 and His-WD1–4 directly interacted with GST-DLC1 (Fig. 1D, left panel). His-WD5–7 failed to pull down DLC1 (Fig. 1D, left panel). Because His-WD1–4 is able to bind to GST-DLC1, we have focused our initial effort within this sequence. According to a predicted model of RACK1 (29McCahill A. Warwicker J. Bolger G.B. Houslay M.D. Yarwood S.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 1261-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), we synthesized a peptide, 138CKYTVQDES146, including the entire outskirt β sheet of blade 3 and named pWD4. We found that pWD4 was able to inhibit the RACL1-DLC1 interaction in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1D, right panel), suggesting that it may overlap with the RACK1 binding sequence for DLC1. By contrast, an unrelated peptide, pSH2, had no effect on the RACK1-DLC1 interaction. RACK1 also interacted with BimEL directly in vitro, which was further enhanced in the presence of DLC1 (Fig. 1E). The interaction between RACK1 and BimEL was also through the N-terminal portion of RACK1, the WD1–4 domain (supplemental Fig. S1). These in vitro binding data support the intracellular association of these proteins described above and suggest that RACK1 interacted directly with both DLC1 and BimEL. Because Bim is sequestered to microtubules by DLC1 and released to mitochondria upon apoptotic stimulation, we tested whether RACK1 is involved in this process. To this end, velocity sedimentation in a glycerol gradient was performed with cell lysates from MCF7 cells and HEK293T cells overexpressing FLAG-DLC1. Under normal conditions, BimEL distributed along with DLC1 and β-tubulin, confirming that BimEL is sequestered to microtubules through DLC1 (supplemental Fig. S2A); upon paclitaxel treatment, both DLC1 and BimEL shifted from the heavier to the lighter fractions 16–20 (peaked at 18–19 and 18–20 for BimEL and DLC1, respectively) and corresponded to the sedimentation positions of a mitochondrial outer membrane protein, Tom20 (supplemental Fig. S2A). No global distribution change of tubulin, RACK1, BimL, and BimS (data not shown) was observed, suggesting the paclitaxel-induced release of BimEL and DLC1 from microtubules was specific in these two cell lines. To detect the distribution of RACK1-BimEL-DLC1 complexes, a coimmunoprecipitation experiment was done with the glycerol gradient fractions. Little interaction between RACK1 and BimEL (supplemental Fig. S2B) or between RACK1 and DLC1 (supplemental Fig. S2C) was detected in the controlled cells; however, paclitaxel treatment led to the interaction between RACK1 and BimEL in MCF7 cells (supplemental Fig. S2B) and between RACK1 and DLC1 in HEK293T cells (supplemental Fig. S2C). Because of technical restriction, we failed to coimmunoprecipitate all three proteins in the same cells. The observation suggested that the interaction between RACK1 and the BimEL-DLC1 complex might be a regulatory step for BimEL translocation. RACK1 Promoted BimEL Degradation in Paclitaxel-treated Cells—Having established that RACK1 interacts with both DLC1 and BimEL, we proceeded to examine the role of RACK1 in the BimEL level because we found that the proteasome inhibitor MG132 could significantly enhance the interaction between RACK1 and BimEL in MCF7 cells (Fig. 1F). To further examine whether RACK1 is involved in controlling the BimEL level, different cancer cells were transiently transfected with either RACK1 or RACK1 siRNA. In the RACK1-overexpressing breast cancer lines, MDA-MB-468 and MCF7, BimEL expression decreased dramatically at 48 and 24 h after paclitaxel treatment, respectively (Fig. 2A). A similar observation was made in the ovarian cancer lines, SKOV3 and SW626, respectively (supplemental Fig. S3A). The reduction of BimEL by RACK1 overexpression was proteasome-dependent, because the proteasome inhibitor, MG-132, significantly reversed the BimEL level (Fig. 2A). Reverse transcription-PCR was performed to assess whether the RACK1-mediated decrease of BimEL was due to reduced transcription. As shown in supplemental Fig. S3B, the BimEL mRNA level did not change in RACK1-overexpressing paclitaxel-treated cells. These observations suggest that RACK1-mediated regulation was not at the level of mRNA but at the level of protein stability.FIGURE 2RACK1 mediated BimEL ubiquitination and degradation in paclitaxel-treated cells. A, MDA-MB-468 or MCF7 cells were transiently transfected with phEF-Neo or phEF-RACK1. 24 h later, cells were treated with 100 nm paclitaxel in the presence or absence of MG132 for the indicated hours. The relative intensity of the bands was quantified as in Fig. 1 and normalized to the loading control. B, MDA-MB-468 cells were transiently transfected with two independent siRNAs of RACK1 or scrambled control for siRNA1. 72 h later, cells were treated with 100 nm paclitaxel for 24 h. C, MCF7 cells were transiently transfected with 1 μg of HA-ubiquitin (Ub) expression plasmid and either phEF-RACK1 or phEF-Neo. 24 h later, cells were treated with 100 nm paclitaxel, with or without 1 μm MG132 for 6 h. Cell lysates were collected with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, and immunoprecipitation was performed with 1 mg of total protein lysates. The result was the representative of three independent experiments.

Knockdown of RACK1 resulted in a higher level of BimEL compared with the control in paclitaxel-treated MDA-MB-468 cells (Fig. 2B). Analogous to RACK overexpression results, down-regulation of RACK1 by siRNA in MCF7 cells did not affect the BimEL mRNA level (supplemental Fig. S3B). Similar results were observed in MCF7-I4 cells (a subline of MCF7) stably expressing short hairpin RNA of RACK1 (supplemental Fig. S3C). Additionally, we showed that overexpression of RACK1 in HEK293T cells promoted the polyubiquitination of BimEL upon paclitaxel treatment, which was further enhanced by the treatment of MG132 (Fig. 2C). Taken together, RACK1 reduced the BimEL protein level in paclitaxel-treated cells through a proteasome-dependent pathway. CIS Regulated BimEL Ubiquitination and Degradation—RACK1 has been implicated as a component in the E3 ligase complex to enhance the ubiquitination and degradation of ΔNp63α, a member of the p53 family (18Fomenkov A. Zangen R. Huang Y.P. Osada M. Guo Z. Fomenkov T. Trink B. Sidransky D. Ratovitski E.A. Cell Cycle. 2004; 3: 1285-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). A recent report showed that RACK1 interacted with ElonginC and mediated the degradation of HIF-1α (19Liu Y.V. Baek J.H. Zhang H. Diez R. Cole R.N. Semenza G.L. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 207-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). We observed previously that paclitaxel enhanced the interaction between RACK1 and CIS in HEK293T cells (data not shown). CIS belongs to SOCS family and is implicated to be a subunit in the RING domain-based E3 ligase complex, containing ElonginB/C-Cullin2-SOCS family members (21Kamizono S. Hanada T. Yasukawa H. Minoguchi S. Kato R. Minoguchi M. Hattori K. Hatakeyama S. Yada M. Morita S. Kitamura T. Kato H. Nakayama K. Yoshimura A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12530-12538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). These observations prompted us to investigate whether RACK1 and CIS were involved in E3 ligase complex-mediated BimEL ubiquitination and degradation. To determine whether CIS is involved in the degradation of BimEL, we overexpressed CIS in HEK293T cells. The overexpression of CIS led to a decreased BimEL level in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3A). Inversely, transient knockdown of CIS resulted in significant accumulation of BimEL in MCF7 cells (Fig. 3A). Similar results were also observed in SKOV3 and SW626 cells (Fig. 3B), supporting that CIS plays a regulatory role in BimEL degradation. Furthermore, we found that CIS overexpression could significantly promote the ubiquitination of endogenous BimEL, which was further enhanced by paclitaxel and MG132 treatment (Fig. 3C). These data point to the role of CIS as a component in the E3 ligase complex to regulate the degradation of BimEL. CIS, RACK1, and DLC1 Were Mutually Dependent to Mediate the Degradation of BimEL via the E3 Ligase Complex—To examine whether RACK1, BimEL, and CIS form a protein complex, a coimmunoprecipitation assay was performed. The paclitaxel treatment caused enhanced interaction between RACK1 and CIS (Fig. 4A, left panel), which confirmed our previous unpublished observation. 5W. Zhang, G. Z. Cheng, J. Gong, U. Hermanto, C. S. Zong, J. Chan, J. Q. Cheng, and L.-H. Wang, unpublished observations. Reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation revealed that the interaction between BimEL and CIS was enhanced upon paclitaxel treatment (Fig. 4A, right panels). Together with the observations described above, we have shown that 1) RACK1, CIS, and BimEL can interact and potentially form a triple-protein complex and 2) both CIS and RACK1 regulated BimEL protein levels via a proteasome-dependent pathway. CIS, like other SOCS/CIS family members, contains a short N-terminal domain, a central SH2 domain, and a C-terminal SOCS-box. Because of the structural similarity, CIS can potentially associate, via its SOCS-box, with ElonginB and ElonginC (the Elongin B/C complex) and Cullin2, thereby forming the RING domain-based E3 ligase complex. Additionally, Cullin2 has already been shown to form an E3 ligase complex with other SOCS"

As such, these orphan polypeptides are retro-translocated to the cytosol, where a significant proportion of each protein is degraded by proteasomes. Here we begin to characterize the ERAD pathway in plant cells, showing that retro-translocation of these lysine-deficient glycoproteins requires the ATPase activity of cytosolic CDC48. Lysine polyubiquitination is not obligatory for this step. We also show that although RCA A is found in a mannose-untrimmed form prior to its retro-translocation, a significant proportion of newly synthesized RTA cycles via the Golgi and becomes modified by downstream glycosylation enzymes. Despite these differences, both proteins are similarly retro-translocated."
https://openalex.org/W1997682598,"Inflammatory bowel disease arises from the interplay between luminal bacteria and the colonic mucosa. Targeted inhibition of pro-inflammatory pathways without global immunosuppression is highly desirable. Apolipoprotein (apo) E has immunomodulatory effects and synthetically derived apoE-mimetic peptides are beneficial in models of sepsis and neuroinflammation. Citrobacter rodentium is the rodent equivalent of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, and it causes colitis in mice by colonizing the surface of colonic epithelial cells and inducing signaling events. We have reported that mice deficient in inducible nitric-oxide (NO) synthase (iNOS) have attenuated C. rodentium-induced colitis. We used young adult mouse colon (YAMC) cells that mimic primary colonic epithelial cells to study effects of an antennapedia-linked apoE-mimetic peptide, COG112, on C. rodentium-activated cells. COG112 significantly attenuated induction of NO production, and iNOS mRNA and protein expression, in a concentration-dependent manner. COG112 inhibited the C. rodentium-stimulated induction of iNOS and the CXC chemokines KC and MIP-2 to the same degree as the NF-kappaB inhibitors MG132 or BAY 11-7082, and there was no additive effect when COG112 and these inhibitors were combined. COG112 significantly reduced nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB, when assessed by electromobility shift assay, immunoblotting, and immunofluorescence for p65. This correlated with inhibition of both C. rodentium-stimulated IkappaB-alpha phosphorylation and degradation, and IkappaB kinase activity, which occurred by inhibition of IkappaB kinase complex formation rather than by a direct effect on the enzyme itself. These studies indicate that apoE-mimetic peptides may have novel therapeutic potential by inhibiting NF-kappaB-driven proinflammatory epithelial responses to pathogenic colonic bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2040088749,"Longevity and age-specific patterns of mortality are complex traits that vary within and among taxa. Multiple candidate genes for aging have been identified in model systems by extended longevity mutant phenotypes, including the G-protein coupled receptor methuselah (mth) in D. melanogaster. These genes offer important insights into the mechanisms of lifespan determination and have been major targets of interest in the biology of aging. However, it is largely unknown whether these genes contribute to genetic variance for lifespan in natural populations, and consequently contribute to lifespan evolution.For a gene to contribute to genetic variance for a particular trait, it must meet two criteria: natural allelic variation and functional differences among variants. Previous work showed that mth varies significantly among wild populations; here we assess the functional significance of wild-derived mth alleles on lifespan, fecundity and stress resistance using a quantitative complementation scheme. Our results demonstrate that mth alleles segregating in nature have a functional effect on all three traits.These results suggest that allelic variation at mth contributes to observed differences in lifespan and correlated phenotypes in natural populations, and that evaluation of genetic diversity at candidate genes for aging can be a fruitful approach to identifying loci contributing to lifespan evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2023254248,"Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) initiates somatic hypermutation and class switch recombination in B cells by deaminating C → U on transcribed DNA. Here we analyze the role of phosphorylation and phosphorylation-null mutants on the biochemical behavior of AID, including enzyme specific activity, processivity, deamination spectra, deamination motif specificity, and transcription-dependent deamination in the presence and absence of RPA. We show that a small fraction of recombinant human AID expressed in Sf9 insect cells is phosphorylated at previously identified residues Ser38 and Thr27 and also at Ser41 and Ser43. S43P AID has been identified in a patient with hyper-IgM immunodeficiency syndrome. Ser-substituted phosphorylation-null mutants (S38A, S41A, S43A, and S43P) exhibit wild type (WT) activity on single-stranded DNA. Deamination of transcribed double-stranded DNA is similar for WT and mutant AID and occurs with or without RPA. Although WT and AID mutants catalyze processive deamination favoring canonical WRC hot spot motifs (where W represents A/T and R is A/G), their deamination spectra differ significantly. The differences between the WT and AID mutants appear to be caused by the replacement of Ser as opposed to an absence of phosphorylation. The spectral differences reflect a marked change in deamination efficiencies in two motifs, GGC and AGC, which are preferred by mutant AID but disfavored by WT AID. Both motifs occur with exceptionally high frequency in human switch regions, suggesting a possible relationship between AID deamination specificity and a loss of antibody diversification. Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) initiates somatic hypermutation and class switch recombination in B cells by deaminating C → U on transcribed DNA. Here we analyze the role of phosphorylation and phosphorylation-null mutants on the biochemical behavior of AID, including enzyme specific activity, processivity, deamination spectra, deamination motif specificity, and transcription-dependent deamination in the presence and absence of RPA. We show that a small fraction of recombinant human AID expressed in Sf9 insect cells is phosphorylated at previously identified residues Ser38 and Thr27 and also at Ser41 and Ser43. S43P AID has been identified in a patient with hyper-IgM immunodeficiency syndrome. Ser-substituted phosphorylation-null mutants (S38A, S41A, S43A, and S43P) exhibit wild type (WT) activity on single-stranded DNA. Deamination of transcribed double-stranded DNA is similar for WT and mutant AID and occurs with or without RPA. Although WT and AID mutants catalyze processive deamination favoring canonical WRC hot spot motifs (where W represents A/T and R is A/G), their deamination spectra differ significantly. The differences between the WT and AID mutants appear to be caused by the replacement of Ser as opposed to an absence of phosphorylation. The spectral differences reflect a marked change in deamination efficiencies in two motifs, GGC and AGC, which are preferred by mutant AID but disfavored by WT AID. Both motifs occur with exceptionally high frequency in human switch regions, suggesting a possible relationship between AID deamination specificity and a loss of antibody diversification. AID, a B-cell specific protein, is required for tightly regulated mechanisms of Ig antibody diversification, somatic hypermutation, class switch recombination, and gene conversion. SHM 2The abbreviations used are: SHM, somatic hypermutation; AID, activation-induced cytidine deaminase; WT, wild type; CSR, class switch recombination; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; HIGM-2, hyper-IgM syndrome; MI, mutability index; nt, nucleotide(s). is characterized by an exceptionally high mutation rate ∼10-3 to 10-4 per base pair per cell division within the V(D)J rearranged Ig genes (1Rajewsky K. Forster I. Cumano A. Science. 1987; 238: 1088-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). CSR is a unique region specific event in which the donor switch region upstream of the IgH Cμ exon (coding for an IgM antibody) recombines with one of the switch regions that is 5′ to each of the downstream C exons, such as Cγ, Cα, or Cϵ, producing IgG, IgA, or IgE antibody isotypes, respectively (2Stavnezer J. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2000; 245: 127-168PubMed Google Scholar). Typically, under tight transcriptional control, AID is induced in activated B cells within germinal centers, causing deamination of cytosine residues in the variable and switch regions (V- and S-regions, respectively) of transcribed Ig loci. Deaminated DNA is subsequently replicated or repaired by different cellular repair mechanisms to give rise to diversified isotype-switched and antigen-specific high affinity antibodies (for reviews, see Refs. 3Goodman M.F.

Biochemical studies have shown that purified native B-cell AID or recombinant AID protein, expressed in Sf9 insect cells or Escherichia coli, deaminates C residues on ssDNA but not dsDNA, single-stranded RNA, or DNA/RNA hybrid molecules (6Bransteitter R.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 2990-2994Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). AID acts processively on ssDNA and has a distinctive deamination specificity, favoring C targets in WRC hot spot motifs (where W represents A or T, and R is purine) while avoiding SYC cold spots (where S represents C or G and Y is pyrimidine) (10Pham P. Bransteitter R. Petruska J. Goodman M.F. Nature. 2003; 423: 103-107Crossref Scopus (544) Google Scholar, 11Bransteitter R. Pham P. Calabrese P. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51612-51621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). These intrinsic biochemical properties of AID are likely to be significant determinants of SHM hallmark features in B-cells, favoring mutations at WRC hot spot motifs and broad clonal heterogeneity of mutations within V-regions (12Rogozin I.B. Kolchanov N.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1171: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 13Smith D.S. Creadon G. Jena P.K. Portanova J.P. Kotzin B.L. Wysocki L.J. J.

Transcription is required for both SHM and CSR to occur (15Peters A. Storb U. Immunity. 1996; 4: 57-65Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 16Fukita Y. Jacobs H.

Since AID does not appear to act on dsDNA, transcription probably plays an essential role in generating transient ssDNA, its principal substrate. The ability of AID to deaminate C residues on dsDNA undergoing active transcription has been demonstrated in cells and cell-free assays. For example, ectopically expressed AID can induce mutations on highly transcribed target gene in fibroblasts (18Yoshikawa K. Okazaki I.M. Eto T. Kinoshita K. Muramatsu M. Nagaoka H. Honjo T. Science. 2002; 296: 2033-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) and E. coli (9Sohail A. Klapacz J. Samaranayake M. Ullah A. Bhagwhat A.S.

Immunol. 2003; 4: 452-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), and purified AID expressed in various sources has been shown to act on dC targets on linear dsDNA and closed circular dsDNA model substrates when transcribed by a prokaryotic RNA polymerase (7Chaudhuri J. Tian M. Khoung C. Chua K. Pinaud E. Alt F.W. Nature. 2003; 421: 726-730Crossref Scopus (613) Google Scholar, 10Pham P. Bransteitter R. Petruska J. Goodman M.F.

A. 2004; 101: 12997-13002Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). AID has been shown to interact with human RNA polymerase II (21Nambu Y. Sugai M. Gonda H. Lee C. Katakai T. Agata Y. Yokota Y. Shimizu A. Science. 2003; 302: 2137-2140Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), although there are currently no biochemical data for AID acting in conjunction with the human transcription machinery to deaminate dsDNA. Native AID isolated from stimulated primary B-cell nuclei is phosphorylated on Ser38 and Tyr184 residues (22Basu U. Chaudhuri J. Alpert C. Dutt S. Ranganath S. Li G. Schrum J.P. Manis J.P. Alt F.W. Nature. 2005; 438: 508-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 23McBride K.M. Gazumyan A. Woo E.M. Barreto V.M. Robbiani D.F. Chait B.T. Nussenzweig M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 8798-8803Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), where Ser38 phosphorylation occurs on about 5–15% of total AID protein (23McBride K.M. Gazumyan A. Woo E.M. Barreto V.M. Robbiani D.F. Chait B.T. Nussenzweig M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 8798-8803Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation does not appear to be B-cell-specific, since a similar or greater level of Ser38-phosphorylated AID was observed when expressed in 293T and 3T3-NTZ cells (23McBride K.M. Gazumyan A. Woo E.M. Barreto V.M. Robbiani D.F. Chait B.T. Nussenzweig M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 8798-8803Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Protein kinase A (PKA) was found to interact with AID (22Basu U. Chaudhuri J. Alpert C. Dutt S. Ranganath S. Li G. Schrum J.P. Manis J.P. Alt F.W. Nature. 2005; 438: 508-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 24Pasqualucci L. Kitaura Y. Gu H. Dalla-Favera R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 395-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and appears to be a primary kinase responsible for phosphorylation at Ser38 and possibly at Thr27 residues in vivo and in vitro (22Basu U. Chaudhuri J. Alpert C. Dutt S. Ranganath S. Li G. Schrum J.P. Manis J.P. Alt F.W. Nature. 2005; 438: 508-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 24Pasqualucci L. Kitaura Y. Gu H. Dalla-Favera R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 395-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The potential role of phosphorylation of AID in SHM and CSR was deduced primarily from studies of AID mutations at phosphorylated residues Thr27, Ser38, and Tyr184. A phosphorylation-defective mutant, Y184A, did not affect CSR (22Basu U. Chaudhuri J. Alpert C. Dutt S. Ranganath S. Li G. Schrum J.P. Manis J.P. Alt F.W. Nature. 2005; 438: 508-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). In contrast, a mutation at S38A reduced CSR dramatically to no more than 20% of the wild type (22Basu U. Chaudhuri J. Alpert C. Dutt S. Ranganath S. Li G. Schrum J.P. Manis J.P. Alt F.W. Nature. 2005; 438: 508-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 24Pasqualucci L. Kitaura Y. Gu H. Dalla-Favera R. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Immunol. 2007; 179: 5274-5280Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated Ser38 was reported to be required for interaction with the 32-kDa subunit of RPA (replication protein A) (27Chaudhuri J. Khuong C. Alt F.W. Nature. 2004; 430: 992-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). AID S38A did not interact with RPA; nor did it catalyze deamination of C on dsDNA in a model T7 RNA polymerase transcription system (22Basu U. Chaudhuri J. Alpert C. Dutt S. Ranganath S. Li G. Schrum J.P. Manis J.P. Alt F.W. Nature. 2005; 438: 508-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 27Chaudhuri J. Khuong C. Alt F.W. Nature. 2004; 430: 992-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). There are data, however, indicating a lesser role of Ser38 phosphorylation in regulating AID activity. Zebrafish AID, which lacks a serine at a position corresponding to human or mouse Ser38, is fully active in supporting SHM and CSR (28Barreto V.M. Pan-Hammarstrom Q. Zhao Y. Hammarstrom L. Misulovin Z. Nussenzweig M.C. J. Exp. Med. 2005; 202: 733-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 29Wakae K. Magor B.G. Saunders H. Nagaoka H. Kawamura A. Kinoshita K. Honjo T. Muramatsu M.

Immunol. 2007; 179: 5274-5280Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Recombinant AID expressed in Sf9 cells and E. coli was found to be active on transcribed dsDNA substrates in the absence of RPA (9Sohail A. Klapacz J. Samaranayake M. Ullah A. Bhagwhat A.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 2990-2994Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 10Pham P. Bransteitter R. Petruska J. Goodman M.F. Nature. 2003; 423: 103-107Crossref Scopus (544) Google Scholar, 11Bransteitter R. Pham P. Calabrese P. Goodman M.F. J. Biol.

Thus, although it is clear that a minority of AID molecules are phosphorylated at Ser38, it is considerably less clear how the biochemical behavior of AID is influenced by either the location of phosphorylated residues or whether or not a particular residue is phosphorylated. The roles of phosphorylation on the properties of AID in vitro are amenable to a comparative biochemical analysis using wild type (WT) AID and phosphorylation-defective mutants. Here we have investigated how replacing individual “phosphorylation-active” Ser residues influences AID specific activity, processivity, deamination specificity, transcriptional-dependent deamination, including its interactions with RPA, and mutational spectra. One such mutant, S43P, has been identified in humans diagnosed with hyper-IgM (HIGM-2) syndrome (32Zhu Y. Nonoyama S. Morio T. Muramatsu M. Honjo T. Mizutani S. J. Med. Dent. Sci. 2003; 50: 41-46PubMed Google Scholar), characterized by the absence of CSR. A comparison of deamination motif specificities favored by S43P in relation to WT AID suggests a possible connection of AID deamination specificity with human immunodeficiency disease. Enzymes and Substrates—Mutant AID proteins (S38A, S38D, S41A, S41D, S43A, and S43P) were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit, Stratagene) using the pAcG2T-AID vector (6Bransteitter R.

Nature. 2003; 423: 103-107Crossref Scopus (544) Google Scholar) as the template. Recombinant baculoviruses encoding WT and mutant AID were generated according to the recommended protocol (BD Bioscience). WT and mutant GST-AID proteins were expressed and purified as described previously (10Pham P. Bransteitter R. Petruska J. Goodman M.F. Nature. 2003; 423: 103-107Crossref Scopus (544) Google Scholar, 11Bransteitter R. Pham P. Calabrese P. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51612-51621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), with an additional of Halt phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Pierce) in the lysis buffer. AID proteins were dialyzed in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 25 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol and stored at -80 °C. E. coli single-stranded binding protein and recombinant human RPA were overexpressed in E. coli and purified according to published protocols (33Lohman T.M. Green J.M. Beyer R.S. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 21-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 34Henricksen L.A. Umbricht C.B. Wold M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11121-11132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). T7 RNA polymerase was purchased from Promega, and ultrapure NTP was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. The active, recombinant catalytic subunit of human protein kinase A was purchased from Calbiochem. M13mp2 gapped DNA and M13mp2T7 covalently closed circular dsDNA substrates were prepared as described (10Pham P. Bransteitter R. Petruska J. Goodman M.F. Nature. 2003; 423: 103-107Crossref Scopus (544) Google Scholar, 11Bransteitter R. Pham P. Calabrese P. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51612-51621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Mass Spectrometry Analysis—Approximately 20 μg of purified AID were reduced with 5 mm dithiothreitol in the presence of 1% SDS and subsequently alkylated with 20 mm iodoacetamide. Protein was then precipitated by the addition of 3 volumes of a solution containing 50% acetone, 49.9% ethanol, and 0.1% acetic acid; the sample was kept on ice for 15 min and then centrifuged for 10 min at maximum speed on a bench top centrifuge. The pellet containing precipitated AID protein was resuspended in 40 μl of 8 m urea, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The suspension was then diluted by adding 160 μl of 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and the protein was digested with 2 μg of trypsin (Promega) overnight. After digestion, 0.4% trifluoroacetic acid was added, and the peptides were desalted using a 50-mg C18-Sep-Pak cartridge (Waters). Phosphopeptides were purified by IMAC as previously described (35Smolka M.B. Albuquerque C.P. Chen S.H. Schmidt K.H. Wei X.X. Kolodner R.D. Zhou H. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2005; 4: 1358-1369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Purified phosphopeptides were analyzed by microcapillary-liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry on a Thermo Finnigan LTQ quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer, as described (35Smolka M.B. Albuquerque C.P. Chen S.H. Schmidt K.H. Wei X.X. Kolodner R.D. Zhou H. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2005; 4: 1358-1369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). For data analysis, the SEQUEST (version 3.4 beta 2) program running on a Sorcerer system (SageN, San Jose, CA) was used for peptide identification. A data base search was performed using a sub-data base consisting of 50 budding yeast proteins in addition to the human AID sequence. The following variable modifications were considered: +80 Da (phosphorylation) for serine, threonine and tyrosine residues; +16 Da (oxidation) for methionine residues. Up to four variable modifications were allowed per peptide, and the peptide mass tolerance used was 3 Da. A semitryptic restriction was applied, and only the top-matched peptides with a probability score above 0.9 were subsequently considered for close inspection. Each MS/MS spectrum that led to a phosphopeptide identification was manually verified to confirm that all significant ions were accounted for and then validated. Measurements of Deamination-specific Activity on ssDNA—Specific activities of WT AID and phosphorylation mutants were measured using 32P-labeled 36-nt ssDNA 5′-AGAAAAGGGGAAAGCAAAGAGGAAAGGTGAGGAGGT-3′. Reactions were carried out in a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2 in the presence of 500 fmol of the substrate DNA, 200 fmol of recombinant GST-AID (Sf9-expressed) or 6400 fmol of E. coli expressed GST-AID, and 20 ng of RNase A. Following incubation at 37 °C for 5 min, the reactions were quenched by a double extraction with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), and the deamination product was analyzed as described previously (6Bransteitter R. Pham P. Scharff M.D. Goodman M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4102-4107Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Specific activities were calculated as amount (fmol) of deaminated substrate/min/μg of enzyme. Deamination Activity of WT and Mutant AID on Transcribed dsDNA—Transcription-dependent AID deamination on the nontranscribed strand of dsDNA was measured using a linear dsDNA, undergoing active transcription by T7 RNA polymerase (10Pham P. Bransteitter R. Petruska J. Goodman M.F. Nature. 2003; 423: 103-107Crossref Scopus (544) Google Scholar). In a typical reaction (50 μl), GST-AID (7 pmol of Sf9-expressed WT or mutant AID or 50 pmol of E. coli-expressed AID), RNase A (200 ng), dsDNA substrate (1 pmol), and T7 RNA polymerase (1 μl) in a reaction buffer containing HEPES (50 mm, pH 7.5), dithiothreitol (5 mm), MgCl2 (10 mm), and NTPs (250 μm) were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. E. coli SSB or human RPA (3, 6, or 12 pmol), if present, were added to the reactions as indicated. The reactions were stopped by extracting twice with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1). The deaminated products were analyzed using a primer elongation-dideoxynucleotide termination assay (10Pham P. Bransteitter R. Petruska J. Goodman M.F. Nature. 2003; 423: 103-107Crossref Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Thermo Sequenase (U.S. Biochemical Corp.) was used to extend an 18-mer 32P-labeled primer annealed to the target strand in the presence of three dNTPs and either ddATP or ddGTP (80 μm each). The reactions were carried out for seven cycles (95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 45 s, 72 °C for 1 min) and terminated by adding an equal volume of stop solution containing 95% formamide and 20 mm EDTA. The reaction products were resolved by 19% polyacrylamide denaturing gel electrophoresis and analyzed by phosphorimaging. Deamination efficiencies were calculated from extension reactions with the ddA mix as a ratio of the band intensity opposite the converted U template site compared with integrated band intensities opposite and beyond the C template site. The efficiencies were also calculated from extension reactions with ddG as a ratio of integrated band intensities beyond the C template site to the integrated band intensities opposite and beyond the C template site. Mutation Analysis of AID-targeted C Deamination in Vitro—Deamination specificities of WT and mutant AID were measured using the following reaction conditions: 30-μl volume, 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), dithiothreitol (1 mm), MgCl2 (10 mm), gapped DNA (500 ng), RNase A (200 ng), and WT or mutant AID (50 to 100 ng of Sf9-expressed AID or 1 μg of E. coli-expressed AID). Following incubations for 2.5, 5, and 10 min at 37 °C, the reactions were quenched by a double extraction with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1). Conversions of C → U on the DNA substrate were detected as white or light blue plaques, indicating C → T mutations in a lacZα target gene after transfection into uracil glycosylase-deficient (ung-) E. coli, as previously described (10Pham P. Bransteitter R. Petruska J. Goodman M.F. Nature. 2003; 423: 103-107Crossref Scopus (544) Google Scholar). WT and mutant AID deamination spectra were compared using χ2 tests with the null hypothesis that the distribution of deaminations at the nucleotide positions is the same for two enzymes. We consider a contingency table where the two columns are the WT and mutant AID, the rows are the nucleotide sites, and the numbers in the cells are the deaminations corresponding to that column and row. In order to deal with the problem of small denominators, we only consider those sites for which the sum of the deaminations for the two enzymes is 5 or greater (we have tried other thresholds and reached the same conclusions). In order to determine whether a motif is deaminated differently by the WT or mutant enzymes, we performed the following test. For each WT or mutant enzyme (S38A, S41A, S43A, or S43P), we calculated the “site mutability index” by dividing the number of deaminations at each site by the total number of deaminations. For the set of sites sharing the motif, we compared the WT index with each of the four mutant AID indexes by the paired Wilcox test. We used all four mutants, since their spectra are similar to each other (but not the WT), and there are a relatively small number of sites for each motif. Since we repeated this test for each of the 16 motifs, the p values in Table 2 have been corrected for multiple tests. The reported value is the probability that if 16 independent tests have been performed, then at least one will be as extreme as observed: c = 1 - (1 - p)16, where c is the correction of p from the Wilcox test.TABLE 2Three-nucleotide motif MI for WT and mutant AID (S38A and S43P) at 2.5 min The MI is defined as the number of times a given trinucleotide motif within a segment of DNA contains a mutation, divided by the number of times the oligonucleotide would be expected to be mutated for a mechanism with no sequence bias.MotifMIWTS38AS43Pp valueap values were calculated by the paired Wilcox test (see “Experimental Procedures”)Hot spots AAC2.51.51.60.41 AGC1.32.12.00.06 TAC3.42.02.20.22 TGC2.62.22.60.99 MI average (WRC)2.51.92.1Cold spots CCC0.280.520.440.65 CTC0.450.760.530.99 GCC0.050.180.050.07 GTC0.320.670.000.99 MI average (SYC)0.280.530.26Intermediates ACC1.20.320.350.02 ATC1.00.630.710.97 CAC1.40.910.960.31 CGC0.51.31.40.004 GAC0.240.50.350.79 GGC0.230.781.00.0001 TCC0.481.11.10.75 TTC0.530.710.710.46 MI average0.700.780.82a p values were calculated by the paired Wilcox test (see “Experimental Procedures”) Open table in a new tab Processivity Deamination Analysis of WT and Mutant AID—An 85-nt ssDNA substrate with two identical hot spot AGC motifs, containing a fluorescein tag located between the two motifs, was used. Deamination reactions (45-μl volume) were carried out in the presence of 15 pmol of ssDNA substrate, 5–15 pmol of WT or mutant GST-AID, and 200 ng of RNase A for 2.5, 5, and 10 min. After treatment with 4 units of uracil DNA glycosylase (New England Biolabs) and alkali, the deamination products were separated on a 16% denaturing polyacrylamide gel, visualized, and quantified using a FX fluorescence scanner (Bio-Rad). Analysis of processive deamination by a single WT and mutant AID enzyme was carried out as described (36Chelico L. Pham P. Calabrese P. Goodman M.F. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 392-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 37Pham P. Chelico L. Goodman M.F. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2007; 6: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The single deamination rates are approximately equal at the 5′-C and 3′-C target motifs. The correlated double deamination efficiency is calculated as the probability that a single AID molecule deaminates both 5′ and 3′ target motifs on one ssDNA substrate during a single enzyme-DNA encounter. Human AID Expressed in Sf9 Cells Is Partially Phosphorylated at Ser Residues 38, 41, and 43 and at Thr27—Mass spectral analysis demonstrates that WT recombinant AID expressed in Sf9 insect cells is phosphorylated at four predicted protein kinase motifs; two motifs are the previously identified Ser38 and Thr27 residues (22Basu U.

Individual peptide fragments of AID showed that just one of the four residues was phosphorylated. Multiple phosphorylations of individual proteins were not detected despite using an isolation technique that strongly favored the detection of multiply phosphorylated peptide fragments (Fig. 1). These three Ser residues 38, 41, and 43 along with Thr27 are predicted to be phosphorylation sites for protein kinase PKA or CAMK2, protein kinase Cδ, CK1, and PKA, respectively (Web Scansite 2.0, medium stringency scan (38Obenauer J.C.

Based on the amount of protein used in the analysis, we estimate that the phosphorylated species represents less than a few percent of the total AID. The detection of phosphorylated AID required that the enzyme isolation and purification be carried out in the presence of a mixture of phosphatase inhibitors (see “Experimental Pro"
https://openalex.org/W2072729422,"Background Progress in oncology could improve survival rate in children, but would probably lead to impaired fertility and puberty. In pre-pubertal girls, the only therapeutic option is the cryopreservation of one ovary. Three births have been reported after reimplantation of cryopreserved mature ovary. Conversely, reimplantation of ovary preserved before puberty (defined as immature ovary) has never been performed in humans. Methodology/Principal Findings In order to analyze ovarian function, we performed transplantation using fresh or cryopreserved immature grafts in pre-pubertal or adult mice. Puberty as well as cyclic hormonal activity was restored. All follicle populations were present although a significant reduction in follicle density was observed with or without cryopreservation. Although fertility was restored, the graft is of limited life span. Because ex vivo ovary manipulation and cryopreservation procedure, the status of genomic imprinting was investigated. Methylation status of the H19 and Lit1 Imprinting Control Regions in kidney, muscle and tongue of offsprings from grafted mice does not show significant alteration when compared to those of unoperated mice. Conclusions/Significance These results demonstrate that immature ovarian grafting can restore spontaneous puberty and fertility. However, these data suggest that follicle depletion leads to premature ovarian failure. This study addresses the very important epigenetics issue, and provides valuable information to the study of ovarian transplantation suggesting that these procedures do not perturb normal epigenetics marks. These results are highly relevant to the reimplantation question of immature cortex in women."

Background, or leak, potassium currents play an important role in the regulation of the resting membrane potential and excitability of mammalian neurons. The two-pore domain potassium (K2P) channel family is open across the physiological voltage range and is believed to underlie many of these leak currents (1Goldstein S.A. Bockenhauer D. O'Kelly I.

So named as each α-subunit of K2P channels contains two pore domains, or P-domains, the channels also contain an unusually large extracellular pre-pore linker called the M1P1 loop. This linker is believed to form a self-interacting domain that is essential for channel dimerization (6Lesage F. Reyes R. Fink M. Duprat F. Guillemare E. Lazdunski M.

There are currently 15 members of this family, which can be divided into six subfamilies on the basis of structural and functional properties (4Kim D. Curr. Pharm.

Among these subfamilies is the TWIK-related acid-sensitivepotassium subfamily (TASK1 (K2P 3.1), TASK3 (K2P9.1), and TASK5 (K2P 15.1)). TASK1 and TASK3 K2P channels are regulated by a wide variety of chemical stimuli (12Duprat F. Lauritzen I. Patel A. Honore E.

TASK channels are sensitive to extracellular acidification, with a histidine at position 98 shown to be crucial for the pH sensitivity of TASK1 and TASK3 channels (7Morton M.J. O'Connell A.D.

O'Connell A.D. Sivaprasadarao A. Hunter M. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2003; 445: 577-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that zinc is a selective blocker of TASK3 channels with little effect on TASK1 in physiological conditions (24Clarke C.E. Veale E.L. Green P.J. Meadows H.J. Mathie A. J. Physiol. 2004; 560: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This selective block involves both His-98 and a glutamate residue (Glu-70) within the M1P1 loop, suggesting that the M1P1 loop plays an important role in channel regulation (24Clarke C.E. Veale E.L. Green P.J. Meadows H.J. Mathie A. J. Physiol. 2004; 560: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Indeed, Glu-70 on the M1P1 loop is also essential for the block of TASK3 current by ruthenium red (25Czirjak G. Enyedi P. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 646-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and other divalent cations (26Musset B. Meuth S.G. Liu G.X. Derst C. Wegner S. Pape H.C. Budde T. Preisig-Muller R. Daut J. J. Physiol. 2006; 572: 639-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The long extracellular M1P1 loop is not conserved in potassium channels with known crystal structures. However, a structural homology model of TASK1 based on known potassium channel structures shows the M1P1 loops lying in close association at position Asn-53 (27Yuill K.H. Stansfeld P.J. Ashmole I. Sutcliffe M.J. Stanfield P.R. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2007; 455: 333-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), a position homologous to TWIK1 C69, an M1P1 loop cysteine residue responsible for channel dimerization (6Lesage F. Reyes R. Fink M. Duprat F. Guillemare E. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6400-6407Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Two cysteines may form a disulfide bond if they are close to each other (β-carbon distance = 4–5 Å) (28Careaga C.L. Falke J.J. Biophys. J. 1992; 62: 209-216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and therefore the engineered disulfide approach, involving introduction of cysteine residues and looking for disulfide bond formation, is a useful tool that has been widely used to determine regions of close proximity for a number of membrane proteins, including potassium channels (29Laine M. Lin M.C. Bannister J.P. Silverman W.R. Mock A.F. Roux B. Papazian D.M. Neuron. 2003; 39: 467-481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In this study we describe in more detail the mechanism of TASK3 zinc block. We confirm that the zinc block involves a glutamate residue in the M1P1 loop and His-98 in the pore region, and we demonstrate that engineered cysteines at positions 70 and 98 are able to form both inter- and intrasubunit spontaneous disulfide bonds. The M1P1 loops of TASK3 channels therefore lie in close apposition to the pore, and through exchange of the M1P1 loops between TASK3 and TASK1 channels we demonstrate that this unusual linker plays a role in the TASK channel pH-sensing mechanism. Mutations and Truncations—Point mutations were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis into the TASK3 channel clones using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). A pair of short (25–35 bases) complementary oligonucleotide primers incorporating the intended mutation were synthesized (MWG-Biotech, Ebersberg, Germany). TASK3 concatamer channels were created with a 6-amino acid linker between the two subunits. In each case, point mutations were made to individual subunits before the final concatamers were formed. Chimeric TASK channels were constructed by swapping M1P1 loops between family members. This was achieved by the introduction of silent mutations to create unique restriction sites, Xho1 and BamH1, either side of the M1P1 region using standard PCR techniques described above. Chimeras were then formed by “cutting and pasting” of this region between the TASK family members. For TASK2 channels a non-silent BamH1 restriction site was created for cutting and pasting and further point mutations undertaken to remove the non-silent mutations. Mutant DNA and chimeric constructs were sequenced (MWG-Biotech, UK/SUPAMAC, Sydney) to confirm the introduction of the correct mutated bases. tsA-201 Cell Culture Preparation—Modified human embryonic kidney 293 cells (tsA-201) were maintained in 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator at 37 °C in growth medium (89% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin (10,000 units ml–1) and streptomycin (10 mg ml–1). When the cells were 80% confluent, they were split and plated for transfection onto glass coverslips coated with poly-d-lysine (1 mg ml–1) to ensure good cell adhesion. The cells were transiently transfected using the calcium phosphate method. 0.3–1 μg of cDNA expression vector encoding a mouse or human TASK3 subunit was added to each 15-mm well, and 0.3–1 μg of a plasmid encoding the cDNA of green fluorescent protein was included to identify cells expressing K2P channels. Following an 18–24-h incubation period at 3% CO2 the cells were rinsed with saline and fresh growth medium was added to the wells. The cells were incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 24–60 h before electrophysiological measurements were made. Electrophysiological Recordings from tsA-201 Cells—Whole cell voltage clamp recordings were made from tsA-201 cells transiently transfected with hTASK3 or hTASK1 wild type or mutated channels. The composition of the control extracellular solution was (in mm) 145 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 3 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 10 HEPES, (titrated to pH 7.4 with NaOH). Glass microelectrodes were pulled from thick-walled borosilicate glass capillaries. Fire-polished pipettes were backfilled with 0.2 μm filtered intracellular solution (composition in mm: 150 KCl, 3 MgCl2, 5 EGTA, 10 HEPES (titrated to pH 7.4 with KOH)). Cells were voltage-clamped using an Axopatch 1D amplifier (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) and low pass-filtered at 5 kHz before sampling (2–10 kHz) and online capture. Data acquisition was carried out using pClamp software (Molecular Devices). tsA-201 cells were held at –80 mV and then subjected to a step to –40 mV for 500 ms, followed by a 500- or 1000-ms voltage ramp from –110 to +20 mV (or similar voltage ranges) once every 5 s. All electrophysiological measurements were carried out at room temperature (21–23 °C). Modulatory compounds were applied by bath perfusion at a rate of 4–5 ml min–1. Complete exchange of bath solution occurred within 100–120 s. Two-electrode Voltage Clamp Recording—Xenopus laevis oocytes were prepared exactly as described previously (30Clarke C.E. Hill A.P. Zhao J. Kondo M. Subbiah R.N. Campbell T.J. Vandenberg J.I. J. Physiol. 2006; 573: 291-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). All experiments were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of the University of Sydney. Recordings were made using the two-electrode voltage clamp technique. Oocytes were placed in a recording chamber 1–3 days after injection of cDNA encoding either hTASK1, hTASK2, hTASK3, or mutant or chimeric channels and continuously perfused with ND96 at room temperature (21–23 °C). Tris or MES 4The abbreviations used are: MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; DTT, dithiothreitol; WT, wild type. buffer replaced HEPES for solutions above 8 and below 7, respectively. ZnCl2 was kept as a 10-mm stock and diluted as required. Microelectrodes were pulled to tip resistances of 0.5–1.5 MΩ. Uninjected oocytes were used as control. Currents present in uninjected oocytes were so small (maximum 0.5 μAat +60 mV) compared with those in injected oocytes that no compensation was deemed necessary. Standard test ramps were run from a holding potential of –90 mV. Oocytes were stepped to +30 mV for 50 ms, and then a ramp of 450-ms duration, from –120 to +60 mV, was run with the initial step to –120 mV being held for 50 ms to ensure capacity currents had returned to base line. Current responses, digitized at 2 kHz and filtered at 1 kHz using a Geneclamp 500B (Molecular Devices), were recorded and analyzed using pClamp9 software (Molecular Devices), Excel 2003, (Microsoft Corp., Seattle, WA), and Prism 4 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). Data Analysis—Data were analyzed using Clampfit software (Axon Instruments), Excel (Microsoft Corp.), and Origin (Microcal). Individual experimental pH data were fitted with sigmoidal dose-response curves. Statistical comparisons were carried out using Student's t test or one-way analysis of variance, and p values <0.05 were regarded as significant. Results are given as means ± S.E. of the mean with n as the number of experiments. Drugs, Chemicals, and cDNA—Cadmium chloride, ruthenium red, and dithiothreitol (DTT) were obtained from Sigma. Apart from DTT, compounds were made up in either DMSO or water and diluted in external solution prior to experimentation. DTT was added directly to the external solution from solid (to give appropriate final concentrations) immediately prior to recording. The human TASK3, TASK2, and TASK1 K2P channel clones in the pcDNA 3.1 vector were from Dr. Helen Meadows (GlaxoSmithKline). Zinc Is a Relatively Selective Blocker of TASK3 Channels Compared with TASK1 Channels—In control solutions (pHo 7.4, [K]o 2.5 mm), zinc (100 μm) substantially inhibited TASK3 currents by 87 ± 2% (mean ± S.E., n = 12) but inhibited TASK1 currents by only 11 ± 4% (n = 8) (see Fig. 1, A and B, also Refs. 19Aller M.I. Veale E.L. Linden A.M. Sandu C. Schwaninger M. Evans L.J. Korpi E.R. Mathie A. Wisden W. Brickley S.G. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 11455-11467Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 24Clarke C.E. Veale E.L. Green P.J. Meadows H.J. Mathie A. J. Physiol. 2004; 560: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Mutation of the histidine residue adjacent to the selectivity filter in the first pore domain of TASK3 (H98A) reduced the effect of zinc on TASK3 channels (Fig. 1C) (24Clarke C.E. Veale E.L. Green P.J. Meadows H.J. Mathie A. J. Physiol. 2004; 560: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to TASK3H98A, TASK3H98D channels (where the histidine was replaced by the aspartate seen most commonly in potassium channels) were still substantially blocked by zinc. Thus, an additional region of the channel must influence zinc block to account for both the differential zinc sensitivity of TASK3 and TASK1 channels and the zinc sensitivity of TASK3H98D channels. Mutating a glutamate residue in the M1P1 loop of TASK3 to the lysine found in TASK1 (TASK3E70K) also reduced the effect of zinc (Fig. 1C) while the double mutation (E70K,H98A) abolished the effect of zinc on TASK3 channels (Fig. 1, C and D). Zinc Block of TASK3 Channels Depends on pHo and [K]o—The commonality in an identified site of action of pH (see Ref. 22Kim Y. Bang H. Kim D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9340-9347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) and zinc (namely the His at position 98) suggests that these two compounds may interact when both are present. This was, indeed, found to be the case. While zinc was a potent, selective blocker of TASK3 at pH 7.4, acidic pH could, at least in part, overcome the effects of zinc. At pH 6.4, TASK3 currents were blocked significantly less by 100 μm zinc (35 ± 3%, n = 4) compared with pH 7.4 (Fig. 1E). Similarly, zinc became a significantly more effective blocker of TASK1 channels when pHo was raised to 8.4 (inhibition of 55 ± 4%, n = 8). The interaction between zinc and hydrogen ions could also be demonstrated by considering recovery of current amplitude following block by zinc. In the example shown, TASK3 currents were potently blocked at pH 8.4 by 100 μm zinc (Fig. 1F). Full recovery from block took a considerable time (∼700 s for the example shown); however, this recovery was much faster (>3-fold faster in this cell) if the channels were exposed briefly to pH 6.4 external solution during wash out of zinc. Because mutation of histidine at position 98 interferes with both zinc and hydrogen ion block, the most parsimonious explanation for these data is that zinc and hydrogen ions compete for an overlapping binding site. Hydrogen ions are less effective blockers of TASK channels in the presence of high extracellular [K] (31Lopes C.M. Gallagher P.G. Buck M.E. Butler M.H. Goldstein S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16969-16978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), so it was of interest to determine whether changing the extracellular [K] also interfered with block by zinc of TASK3 channels. Fig. 1E shows the effect of 100 μm zinc on TASK3 channels at pH 7.4 in normal solution and in the presence of high (100 mm) [K]o. Zinc was significantly less effective at blocking current in high [K]o compared with control. To demonstrate further the individual importance of both His-98 and residues in the M1P1 loop in zinc block, we utilized TASK2 (K2P5.1) channels. Although named TASK2, these channels share greater amino acid homology with the alkaline-sensitive TALK channels (10Goldstein S.A.N. Bayliss D.A. Kim D. Lesage F. Plant L.D. Rajan S. Pharmacol. Rev. 2005; 57: 527-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). TASK2 channels do not contain a homologous histidine within the first pore region and are insensitive to zinc (24Clarke C.E.

Introducing a histidine at a homologous site to TASK3 His-98 in TASK2 (TASK2N103H) did not lead to zinc-sensitive currents (Fig. 2, A, B, E, F). Expression of a chimera consisting of the body of TASK2 with the M1P1 loop of TASK3 (TASK2TASK3M1P1) in Xenopus oocytes also led to zinc-insensitive currents (Fig. 2, C and E). However, the presence of both the TASK3 M1P1 loop and the pore-residing histidine (TASK2TASK3M1P1_N103H) enabled zinc block at pH 7.4, with a 51 ± 5% (n = 5) inhibition seen at 100 μm zinc, close to the zinc sensitivity of TASK3 channels (Fig. 2, A, D–F). Thus, the block of TASK3 channels by zinc is only recapitulated in TASK2 channels when both the M1P1 loop and the pore histidine residue from TASK3 are present. The Effect of DTT on TASK3 Channel Cysteine Mutations—The importance of both Glu-70 and His-98 in block by zinc suggests that these amino acids may be located close to each other in the channel to form a binding site for zinc (see also Ref. 24Clarke C.E. Veale E.L. Green P.J. Meadows H.J. Mathie A. J. Physiol. 2004; 560: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Mutation of both Glu-70 and His-98 to Cys gave channels that were virtually non-functional (2 ± 1 pA/pF, n = 14); however, current was partially restored when cells were treated with the reducing agent DTT (5 mm), which breaks disulfide bonds (18 ± 3 pA/pF, n = 16, Fig. 3A). Zinc was a potent blocker of these channels following application of DTT with 100 μm, giving 89 ± 3% inhibition (n = 5). Cysteine residues are very common in metal binding motifs such as zinc fingers in proteins and often contribute to the modulatory binding sites for zinc on ion channels (see Ref. 32Mathie A. Sutton G.L. Clarke C.E. Veale E.L. Pharmacol. Ther. 2006; 111: 567-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). While E70C mutated channels alone gave functional currents that were unaffected by DTT, carrying out the same experiment with only His-98 modified to a cysteine residue gave broadly similar results to that with the TASK3E70C,H98C double mutation. Current in TASK3H98C channels was 6 ± 1 pA/pF (n = 15), and this was restored to 62 ± 10 pA/pF (n = 10) following DTT (Fig. 3B). Again, zinc was a potent blocker of the restored current (88 ± 4% inhibition, n = 4). Indeed, inhibition was difficult to reverse unless DTT was reapplied to the cells. Reversal by DTT is most likely due to the ability of this compound to powerfully chelate zinc (33Krezel A. Lesniak W. Jezowska-Bojczuk M. Mlynarz P. Brasun J. Kozlowski H. Bal W. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2001; 84: 77-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Thus, our results with cysteine mutations and DTT show that the two mutated histidine residues form a disulfide bond in the TASK3H98C channel dimer but do not provide evidence as to whether the Glu-70 residues are close enough to the His-98 residues to form bonds when also mutated to cysteine residues. Sensitivity of TASK3 Tandem Channel Constructs to DTT and Cadmium—To be able to address these interactions further, we needed to construct tandem channel constructs that would allow us to mutate a residue on only one or the other of the subunits that make up the functional channel dimer. Our initial construct was to join two wild type (WT) TASK3 channels in a forced concatamer. This construct gave functional channels that were inhibited as predicted by zinc (100 μm, 90 ± 1%, n = 3, Fig. 3C) and ruthenium red (10 μm, 68 ± 3%, n = 5), another selective blocker of TASK3 channels (25Czirjak G. Enyedi P. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 646-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Mutation of a single His-98 residue to Cys (on the second subunit of the tandem construct, TASK3/TASK3H98C) gave functional currents, and these were now no longer enhanced by perfusion of DTT (4 ± 3% inhibition, n = 4, Fig. 3D), in contrast to the TASK3H98C/TASK3H98C channel dimer above. This shows that the cysteine residue that we have introduced at position 98 is only capable of forming a spontaneous disulfide bond with another introduced cysteine residue and not with any cysteine residues present in the WT TASK3 channel. The amplitude of current through constructs where one Glu-70 residue and one His-98 residue were mutated to cysteine on one or the other of the two subunits of the tandem construct was significantly enhanced by DTT treatment (Fig. 3, E and F). Currents through the TASK3E70C,H98C/TASK3 construct were enhanced by 43 ± 9% (n = 6) whereas DTT enhanced currents through the TASK3E70C/TASK3H98C construct by 39 ± 7% (n = 12), the latter construct consisting of channels with one mutation in each subunit. Our data therefore suggest that some degree of cross-linking can occur, spontaneously, between the Cys-70 and Cys-98 residues in these mutants, even when the cysteine residues are on different subunits of the dimer. The M1P1 loop therefore must lie close to the pore. Because the enhancement by DTT is similar in magnitude whether the cysteine residues at positions Cys-70 and Cys-98 are on the same subunit or opposite subunits, this suggests that inter- and intrasubunit interactions are equally strong. To test this idea further, we used cadmium ions that can bind strongly to two closely apposed cysteine residues (e.g. Ref. 34Sobolevsky A.I. Yelshansky M.V. Wollmuth L.P. Neuron. 2004; 41: 367-378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Cadmium (at 10 μm) had no significant effect on WT TASK3 channels (2 ± 2% inhibition, n = 4, Fig. 4A); however, it caused a small, reversible inhibition of the mutated concatamers (Fig. 4, B–D). For the TASK3E70C,H98C/TASK3 construct, cadmium produced a 13 ± 6% inhibition (n = 4) whereas the TASK3E70C/TASK3H98C construct was inhibited by 18 ± 2% (n = 10). This is comparable with the block seen for the single mutant concatamer channel (TASK3/TASK3H98C) that was blocked by 10 μm cadmium by 25 ± 3% (n = 6) before DTT and 27 ± 2% (n = 6) following DTT and suggests reversible cadmium binding to single free cysteine residues (see also Ref. 34Sobolevsky A.I. Yelshansky M.V. Wollmuth L.P. Neuron. 2004; 41: 367-378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Following treatment with DTT, cadmium was significantly (p < 0.05) more effective at blocking current through these concatamer channels (Fig. 4, B and C). The TASK3E70C,H98C/TASK3 construct was inhibited by cadmium (10 μm) by 57 ± 5% (n = 5) after DTT, whereas the TASK3E70C/TASK3H98C construct was inhibited by 63 ± 4% (n = 3). Furthermore, following DTT treatment, block by cadmium was difficult to reverse unless DTT was reapplied to the cells (Fig. 4, B and D), again supporting the hypothesis that these residues are in close apposition. The TASK3N53C Channel Construct Is Insensitive to DTT and Cadmium—In contrast to this, M1P1 residues that have previously been assumed to be closely associated in TASK1 (35Yuill K. Ashmole I. Stanfield P.R. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2004; 448: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) that are also conserved in TASK3 may not, in fact, be in close apposition. We created a TASK3N53C mutant and looked for evidence of disulfide bridge formation. Expression of the mutant in Xenopus oocytes gave currents that were WT-like (8.5 ± 2 μA (n = 8) and 7.0 ± 1 μA (n = 13) for mutant and WT TASK3 channels, respectively). Full pH response curves showed no change in pH sensitivity of the mutant channel with a pKa of 6.4 ± 0.1 (n = 4), compared with a pKa = 6.6 ± 0.03 (n = 13) for WT TASK3 (Fig. 4E). Application of 5 mm DTT or 10 μm cadmium had no significant effect on current size at 30 mV, with a 6.9 ± 4% (n = 8) increase and a 3.7 ± 1% (n = 5) decrease in current recorded, respectively. A similar lack of effect of DTT and cadmium on this mutant was seen when these channels were expressed in tsA-201 cells (Fig. 4F). The M1P1 Loop Influences the pH Sensitivity of TASK1 Channels—TASK1 channels are more sensitive to extracellular pH than TASK3 (7Morton M.J. O'Connell A.D. Sivaprasadarao A. Hunter M. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2003; 445: 577-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 21Rajan S. Wischmeyer E. Xin Liu G. Preisig-Müller R. Daut J. Karschin A. Derst C. J. Biol.

The close proximity of residues on the M1P1 loop to the apparent pH sensor in TASK3 suggests that the M1P1 loop could play a role in determining the pKa of channel conductance. To test this hypothesis we generated chimeric channels in which the M1P1 loop was swapped between TASK1 and TASK3 and visa versa. Expression of the chimeras formed from TASK1 with the TASK3 M1P1 loop (TASK1TASK3M1P1) and TASK3 with the TASK1 M1P1 loop (TASK3TASK1M1P1) in Xenopus oocytes gave functional currents that were still potassium-selective. Similarly to WT TASK channels, the chimeras were sensitive to extracellular pH changes (Fig. 5, A–D). Full pH response curves (Fig. 5E) showed a pKa for inhibition of TASK3TASK1M1P1 that was significantly shifted by 0.3 of a pH unit compared with WT TASK3 (TASK3TASK1M1P1, pKa = 6.7 ± 0.02 (n = 11), TASK3 pKa = 6.4 ± 0"
https://openalex.org/W2058670812,"Human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2/ErbB2/neu), a receptor tyrosine kinase that is amplified/overexpressed in poor prognosis breast carcinomas, confers resistance to apoptosis by activating cell survival pathways. Here we demonstrate that the cytoplasmic tail of HER-2 is cleaved by caspases at Asp(1016)/Asp(1019) to release a approximately 47-kDa product, which is subsequently proteolyzed by caspases at Asp(1125) into an unstable 22-kDa fragment that is degraded by the proteasome and a predicted 25-kDa product. Both the 47- and 25-kDa products translocate to mitochondria, release cytochrome c by a Bcl-x(L)-suppressible mechanism, and induce caspase-dependent apoptosis. The 47- and 25-kDa HER-2 cleavage products share a functional BH3-like domain, which is required for cytochrome c release in cells and isolated mitochondria and for apoptosis induction. Caspase-cleaved HER-2 binds Bcl-x(L) and acts synergistically with truncated Bid to induce apoptosis, mimicking the actions of the BH3-only protein Bad. Moreover, the HER-2 cleavage products cooperate with Noxa to induce apoptosis in cells expressing both Bcl-x(L) and Mcl-1, confirming their Bad-like function. Collectively, our results indicate that caspases activate a previously unrecognized proapoptotic function of HER-2 by releasing a Bad-like cell death effector."
https://openalex.org/W1990274908,"Background APOBEC3G (A3G), a deoxycytidine deaminase, is a potent host antiviral factor that can restrict HIV-1 infection. During Vif-negative HIV-1 replication, A3G is incorporated into HIV-1 particles, induces mutations in reverse transcribed viral DNA and inhibits reverse transcription. However, HIV-1 Vif counteracts A3G's activities by inducing its degradation and by blocking its incorporation into HIV-1 particles. Thus, it is interesting to elucidate a mechanism that would allow A3G to escape the effects of Vif in order to rescue its potent antiviral activity and to provide a possible novel therapeutic strategy for treating HIV-1 infection. Methods and Findings In this study, we generated an R88-A3G fusion protein by fusing A3G to a virion-targeting polypeptide (R14-88) derived from HIV-1 Vpr protein and compared its antiviral effects relative to those of HA-tagged native A3G (HA-A3G). Our study showed that transient expression of the R88-A3G fusion protein in both Vif− and Vif+ HIV-1 producing cells drastically inhibited viral infection in HeLa-CD4-CCR5-cells, CD4+ C8166 T cells and human primary PBMCs. Moreover, we established CD4+ C8166 T cell lines that stably express either R88-A3G or HA-A3G by transduction with VSV-G-pseudotyped lentiviral vector that harbor expression cassettes for R88-A3G or HA-A3G, respectively, and tested their susceptibility to Vif+ HIV-1 infection. Our results clearly reveal that expression of R88-A3G in transduced CD4+ C8166 cells significantly blocked Vif+ HIV-1 infection. In an attempt to understand the mechanism underlying the antiviral activity of R88-A3G, we demonstrated that R88-A3G was efficiently incorporated into viral particles in the presence of Vif. Moreover, PCR analysis revealed that R88-A3G significantly inhibited viral cDNA synthesis during the early stage of Vif+ virus infection. Conclusions Our results clearly indicate that R88 delivers A3G into Vif+ HIV-1 particles and inhibits infectivity and spread of the virions among CD4+ T cells. This study provides evidence for an effective strategy to modify a host protein with innate anti-HIV-1 activity and rescue its potent anti-HIV potential in the presence of Vif. Further characterization and optimization of this system may lead to the development of an effective therapeutic approach against HIV-1 infection."
https://openalex.org/W2095594633,"Systemic hormonal control exerts its effect through the regulation of local target tissues, which in turn regulate upstream signals in a feedback loop. The parathyroid hormone (PTH) axis is a well defined hormonal signaling system that regulates calcium levels and bone metabolism. To understand the interplay between systemic and local signaling in bone, we examined the effects of deficiency of the bone matrix protein osteopontin (OPN) on the systemic effects of PTH specifically within osteoblastic cell lineages. Parathyroid hormone receptor (PPR) transgenic mice expressing a constitutively active form of the receptor (caPPR) specifically in cells of the osteoblast lineage have a high bone mass phenotype. In these mice, OPN deficiency further increased bone mass. This increase was associated with conversion of the major intertrabecular cell population from hematopoietic cells to stromal/osteoblastic cells and parallel elevations in histomorphometric and biochemical parameters of bone formation and resorption. Treatment with small interfering RNA (siRNA) for osteopontin enhanced H223R mutant caPPR-induced cAMP-response element (CRE) activity levels by about 10-fold. Thus, in addition to the well known calcemic feedback system for PTH, local feedback regulation by the bone matrix protein OPN also plays a significant role in the regulation of PTH actions."
https://openalex.org/W2062320823,"Mitochondrial deoxynucleoside triphosphates are formed and regulated by a network of anabolic and catabolic enzymes present both in mitochondria and the cytosol. Genetic deficiencies for enzymes of the network cause mitochondrial DNA depletion and disease. We investigate by isotope flow experiments the interrelation between mitochondrial and cytosolic deoxynucleotide pools as well as the contributions of the individual enzymes of the network to their maintenance. To study specifically the synthesis of dGTP used for the synthesis of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, we labeled hamster CHO cells or human fibroblasts with [(3)H]deoxyguanosine during growth and quiescence and after inhibition with aphidicolin or hydroxyurea. At time intervals we determined the labeling of deoxyguanosine nucleotides and DNA and the turnover of dGTP from its specific radioactivity in the separated mitochondrial and cytosolic pools. In both cycling and quiescent cells, the import of deoxynucleotides formed by cytosolic ribonucleotide reductase accounted for most of the synthesis of mitochondrial dGTP, with minor contributions by cytosolic deoxycytidine kinase and mitochondrial deoxyguanosine kinase. A dynamic isotopic equilibrium arose rapidly from the shuttling of deoxynucleotides between mitochondria and cytosol, incorporation of dGTP into DNA, and degradation of dGMP. Inhibition of DNA synthesis by aphidicolin marginally affected the equilibrium. Inhibition of DNA synthesis by blockage of ribonucleotide reduction with hydroxyurea instead disturbed the equilibrium and led to accumulation of labeled dGTP in the cytosol. The turnover of dGTP decreased, suggesting a close connection between ribonucleotide reduction and pool degradation."
https://openalex.org/W2094468743,"Most models of hereditary hypotrichosis are due to alterations in growth factors and transcription factors, and the examples of causative mutations in hair keratin genes are limited. The Hirosaki hairless rat (HHR) is a mutant strain spontaneously derived from Sprague-Dawley rats (SDRs). In this study, the locus of the responsible gene was examined by linkage analysis and mapped on chromosome 7q36. Because many basic keratin genes are clustered on 7q36, their expression was examined. Reverse transcription-PCR and genomic PCR indicated that the Kb21 (Krt81), -23 (Krt83), and -26 (Krt86) genes encoding basic hair keratins were not expressed and were deleted. Furthermore, 80-kb genomic DNA ranging from exon 9 of Kb25 (Krt85) to exon 9 of Krt2-25 was deleted. The breakpoints of these genes were within a 95-bp portion shared by the two genes, suggesting that deletion due to non-allelic homologous recombination occurred. Proteins identified as Kb21, Kb23, and Krt2-25 in SDR hairs by mass spectrometry were not detected in HHR. Instead, the product of a fusion gene became dominant in HHR. Because fusion occurred between the exons of the two genes with the same sequences, the product was identical to the wild-type Kb25 protein. By using immunohistochemistry, Kb21 was not detected in HHR hair follicles. Kb25 was expressed in the cortex in HHRs, whereas it was in the medulla in SDRs.

This study clearly illustrates the importance of hair keratin genes in hair growth. The large keratin multigene family comprises cytokeratins, which are differentially expressed in the various types of epithelia, and hair keratins, expressed in hard keratinized structures such as hairs, nails, and claws. These keratins can be divided into the acidic type I and the basic-to-neutral type II members, which form the 10 nm intermediate filament network through the obligatory association of equimolar amounts of type I and type II keratins (1Langbein L.

Hair keratins are collectively designated “H” for hair, “b” for the basic members (Hb), and “a” for the acidic members (Ha) (3Heid H.W. Werner E. Franke W.W. Differentiation. 1986; 32: 101-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In the case of rats, genes encoding the basic members are designated Kb21-26. In rats, the type I keratin genes are clustered on chromosome 10q31 and the type II gene cluster on 7q36 (4Hesse M. Zimek A. Weber K. Magin T.M. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 83: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The latter cluster includes Kb21-26 on a DNA domain of ∼200 kb. Hairs are produced in hair follicles.

Nature. 1994; 372: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar), responsible genes remain to be clarified. In the present study, we investigated genes responsible for HHR by linkage analysis and identified the hhr locus on chromosome 7q36. An 80-kb genomic DNA ranging from exon 9 of Kb25 to exon 9 of Krt2-25 was deleted in HHR. Furthermore, breakpoints of these genes were within a 95-bp portion shared by the two genes, suggesting the deletion to be due to non-allelic homologous recombination. This is the first report on hypotrichosis due to the deletion of hair keratin genes and the expression of a keratin fusion gene. Rats—HHRs were maintained by brother-sister mating of hhr/+ heterozygous females and hhr/hhr homozygous males. HHRs and SDRs were housed in plastic cages in air-conditioned rooms with a 12-h light/dark cycle in the Institute for Animal Experiments of Hirosaki University Graduate School of Medicine and had free access to water and food. For linkage analysis, pigmented BN/CrlCrlj females (+/+, C/C, and hi/hi) obtained from Charles River Japan Inc. (Tokyo, Japan), were crossed with a single HHR (hhr/hhr, c/c, and h/h) male. BN rats are wild for the hhr (+) and homozygous for the dominant Color (C) and dominant irish hooded (hi) alleles. The F1 hybrid females from the initial cross were then backcrossed with hhr/hhr males to produce the N2 progeny. A total of 88 N2 progeny were produced in this study. This study was carried out in accordance with the Guidelines for Animal Experimentation, Hirosaki University. Genetic Linkage Analysis—Genomic DNA was extracted from liver specimens using the DNeasy® (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Eighteen microsatellite markers that are polymorphic between HHRs and BNs were used for the primary genome-wide linkage analysis (Table 1). PCR was carried out in 20 μl of a premix Taq® (TaKaRa, Kyoto, Japan) containing 40 ng of the genomic DNA and 0.5 μm of each oligonucleotide primer. After initial denaturation for 3 min at 94°C, 35 cycles of amplification, each consisting of denaturation for 30 s at 94°C, annealing for 30 s at 55-60 °C, and extension for 45 s at 72 °C, were carried out with a Thermal Cycler i-Cycler (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The PCR products were separated by 4% NuSive®-agarose gel (FMC BioProducts, Rockland, ME) in 44.5 mm Tris, 44.5 mm boric acid, and 1 mm EDTA with 0.1 μg/ml ethidium bromide.TABLE 1Segregation ratio of marker loci in mutant (hhr/hhr) N2 backcross progenyMicrosatellite markerNo. of ratsϰ2pHomozygosityaHomozygosity denotes homozygous for the individual marker alleles for HHR.HeterozygosityColor (D1)bColor and Hooded are visible coat color marker loci on chromosomes 1 and 14, respectively.23290.480.25 < p < 0.5D2Rat18714100.380.5 < p < 0.75D3Arb38162.040.1 < p < 0.25D4Arb151151.560.1 < p < 0.25D5Rat11612120.420.5 < p < 0.75D6Arb51060.560.25 < p < 0.5D7Rat10524022.0p < 0.005D8Arb5880.060.75 < p < 0.9D9Mit75111.560.1 < p < 0.25D10Rat103880.060.75 < p < 0.9D11Rat27960.270.5 < p < 0.75D12Rat49750.080.75 < p < 0.9D13Arb119110.050.75 < p < 0.9Hooded (D14)bColor and Hooded are visible coat color marker loci on chromosomes 1 and 14, respectively.15130.040.75 < p < 0.9D15Rat29590.640.25 < p < 0.5D16Rat311190.050.75 < p < 0.9D17Rat7610140.380.5 < p < 0.75D18Mit17110.500.25 < p < 0.5D19Rat67880.060.75 < p < 0.9D20Rat46970.060.75 < p < 0.9a Homozygosity denotes homozygous for the individual marker alleles for HHR.b Color and Hooded are visible coat color marker loci on chromosomes 1 and 14, respectively. Open table in a new tab RT-PCR—Total RNAs were extracted from the skin of HHRs and SDRs using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen Inc.). RT-PCR was performed with an Access Quick® RT-PCR System (Promega, Madison, WI) by using 0.5 μg of RNA and primer pairs. PCR amplification consisted of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 55 to 60 °C, and 30 s to 2 min at 72 °C for 21-30 cycles. The primers used were as follows (5′→3′): VDR, F-ACCCTTGGGCTCTACTCACC and R-TCCTCTCCGTTCAGATCCAG; Wnt10b, F-GGCTGTAATCACGACATGGA and R-GGAGCCATGATTAACCGAAA; Sp1, F-AGGCCTCCAGACCATTAACC and R-TGGGTATTGGCCCATATGTC; Hoxc8, F-CGGCAGCAAGCACAAAGA and R-GCGGCTCTCTGCTCACTTT; Hoxc13, F-CACGCCTTCTCTCTCCCTCT and R-CATAAATAGTCGGGGCAGGA; Krt7, F-GCCTGAGGTCAGGGAGTT and R-CTTCCACCACATCCTGCAT; Kb21, F-CTGTGCGTGTCAGGTTCCAG and R-GCCAGGGATGACTCAGGATG; Kb23, F-TGAAGAAGAAGTTGCACTCC and R-CCCCTTGCCAGCAGGTAG; Kb24, F-GGCTTGGGTGGTTTTGGTAG and R-ATTCCTCCAATTCTGTAGCC; Kb25, F-ATTGACAGGCTTCAGCAGTC and R-ACTCGTTCTCTGCCGTAGCC; Kb26,F-GATCTCTGTGTCTCCGGTAC and R-TTGCAGCTTTGTGGCCTCCT; K6irs1, F-TCTTCCCCTGTCAGCATCTC and R-TCAGACTGGAGCCCTTTGTT; and β-actin, F-AGCCATGTACGTAGCCATCC and R-CTCTCAGCTGTGGTGGTGAA. The RT-PCR products were subjected to electrophoresis in a 2% agarose gel and visualized with ethidium bromide. Location of the Deletion Breakpoints—PCR was performed on genomic DNA derived from the livers of HHRs and SDRs. Amplification was carried out for 35 cycles, each consisting of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C. Primers used for amplifying intron/exon of the individual basic keratin genes were designed according to the Primer 3. The primers shown in Fig. 3 (A and B) were as follows (5′→3′): Krt7, F-ACTGACGTGGGTATGGCTTT and R-AACCTAGGCTCTGGGACCTC; Krt2-25, F-TTCTCCCTCTCCCACAACAG (corresponding to the intron 1 region) and R-CTTATGGTTGGGGGTTAGCA (intron 2 region); RGD1305207, F-GGACTCTACCAGGTGCTCCA and R-CTCTGCCTTCCCAGCTCTAA; Kb21, F-GGATTCTCCCTGCTCTCTGA and R-ATTCATGAGTCGCCTTTTGG; Kb26, F-CTTCCCAGAGCCCCTCTACT and R-TTCATGTCCTGGGCTTTGAT; Kb23, F-CTGAAGGCACCCTTAGAACG and R-AGGTTGGTCCTCTCCCAGAT; Kb25, F-CCAGTCTGTTGGGGAGACA (corresponding to the intron 1 region) and R-CTGTATCCTGCTTGGGGTGT (intron 1 region); (a) F-AAGTTCCAAAGGGCTTCCAC and R-AATTCCCTTTCTCCCCTCCT; (b) F-GAGCCAACAGTAGGATGAGCA and R-TTTCAGCATTTCGCTTTGC; (c) F-GCTGTTCAAGAAGCCTTTGC and R-GGGATGAGTGGAGAAGGTCA; (d) F-TTCACGAACGTCTGTCTCCA and R-ACCCCAGTGTAAGGGCTGTA; R2, GACTGGATAAGCCCCTTGTG. The sequences of F1, F2, and R1 are presented in Fig. 3D. The PCR products using the primers F2 and R1 were sequenced with a Big Dye Terminator Kit (PE Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and an ABI DNA sequencer Model 310 (PE Biosystems). Sequencing of Kb21, Kb23, and Krt2-25 cDNAs in SDR—These full-length cDNAs were prepared by RT-PCR employing the Omniscript® Reverse Transcription Kit (Qiagen) and the primers described below. PCR was performed essentially according to manufacturer's instructions. Kb21, F-ATGACCTGTGGATCAGGATT and R-GAAGCCAGTATTCACTTC; Kb23, F-ATGACCTGTGGCTTTCAAACTG and R-GCAGCAAGCCCCTTGC; Krt2-25, F-ATGTCCTGCTTCTCCTCCC and R-AGCAAAGCGCACAGAGC. The PCR products were sequenced as described above. Extraction of Rat Hair Proteins—Hair proteins were extracted from hairs of SDRs and HHRs, as described by Winter et al. (15Winter H. Hofmann I. Langbein L. Rogers M.A. Schweizer J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32345-32352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting—SDS-PAGE was carried out by the method of Laemmli (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar) on a 10% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels. Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Western blotting was performed, according to the method of Towbin et al. (28Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44923) Google Scholar). To purify basic hair keratins, SDR 51-kDa proteins, and HHR 56-kDa protein resolved by SDS-PAGE, the gel portions containing the respective proteins were cut with a razor, homogenized in 1% SDS, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and then rotated overnight. The supernatant fractions after centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min were dialyzed against distilled water and then lyophilized. Production of Anti-Kb25 and Anti-Kb21 Antibodies—To produce anti-Kb25 antibody, the HHR 56-kDa protein thus purified was dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline. The protein (200 μg of protein/1.5 ml) was emulsified with an equal volume of Freund's complete adjuvant (Iatron Laboratories, Tokyo, Japan) and then injected subcutaneously four times into an albino rabbit at 1-week intervals. The rabbit was bled on the seventh day after the last injection, and antiserum was purified by ammonium sulfate fractionation. Specificity of the antibody was examined by Western blotting. To produce anti-Kb21 antibody, the C-terminal peptide of Kb21 was synthesized by a peptide synthesizer (model 432A, Applied Biosystems), based on the amino acid sequence of the rat Kb21 (473SAVSCGRKC481) that was specific to the keratin (4Hesse M. Zimek A. Weber K. Magin T.M. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 83: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The peptide was coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin with m-maleimidobenzoyl N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (29Peeters J.M. Hazendonk T.G. Beuvery E.C. Tesser G.I. J. Immunol. Methods. 1989; 120: 133-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). This peptide-hemocyanin complex was injected into a rabbit to produce anti-Kb21 antibody, as described above. Liquid Chromatography/Electrospray-Ionization Mass Spectrometry (LC/ESI-MS)—After being reduced with dithiothreitol and alkylated with iodoacetamide, proteins were dissolved in 100 mm NH4HCO3 containing 50 ng/μl trypsin and incubated at 37 °C for 16 h. The samples were applied to a Nano Frontier LC column, C18 (75 μm inner diameter × 150 mm, Hitachi-Hitec, Tokyo, Japan) and eluted by a gradient flow of acetonitrile and distilled water containing 0.1% formic acid (flow rate, 200 nl/min). The peptide fragments eluted were analyzed using an online coupled linear trap ESI-MS (Nano Frontier L, Hitachi-Hitec) at a heated capillary temperature of 140 °C and voltage of 1.0 kV. Peptide sequence analysis was performed using BioLynx software (Micromass). The sequence information was submitted to the MASCOT program (Matrix-science), and a MASCOT score of more than 34 was considered to represent the corresponding proteins. Immunohistochemistry—Skin tissues from the anterior dorsal regions of rats were fixed in 10% formaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. Two-week-old rats were used to obtain hairs in an anagen phase. Immunohistochemical staining for Kb21 or Kb25 was performed by the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (ABC) method (30Hsu S.M. Raine L. Fanger H. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1981; 29: 577-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (13460) Google Scholar) with the respective antibodies. The biotinylated anti-rabbit antibody and Vectastain ABC kit were obtained from Vector Laboratories (Burlingame, CA). The specific binding was visualized with a 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride solution. Sections were then lightly counterstained with hematoxylin for microscopic examination. The specimens were examined and photographed using a microscope (Coolscope, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) interfaced with a computer. Mapping of the hhr—To map the hhr locus, the backcross N2 progeny were produced from the (BN × HHR) F1 mated with HHR. Linkage analysis was performed by typing DNA samples from randomly selected 12-52 hairless N2 animals for 2 visible coat colors (the color on chromosome 1 and the hooded on chromosome 14) and 18 microsatellite markers on other chromosomes. Linkage of the hhr was first detected with the D7Rat105 on Chr 7 (Table 1). DNA samples of the 88 progeny were further typed for additional Chr 7 markers. One hairless rat exhibited the heterozygosity at the D7Rat173 gene, but all hairless rats showed the homozygosity at the D7Rat3 and D7Rat105 loci without exception (Fig. 1A), indicating that the hhr was localized to the region between the D7Rat173 and the telomere on 7q36. Hair growth-related genes and the basic keratin gene cluster are known to be localized on 7q36 (Fig. 1B). RT-PCR was performed to examine whether expression of these genes is altered in HHR. The Kb21,-23, and -26 genes were not expressed in HHR, but other basic keratin genes were expressed (Fig. 2). Expression of the Wnt10b, Hoxc13, and other genes related to hair growth was retained in HHR.FIGURE 2Gene expression analysis of hair growth-related genes localized on 7q36 by RT-PCR. RT-PCR was performed using the primers for the individual genes and mRNA isolated from the skin of HHR and SDR.

To examine this, PCR was preformed for neighboring basic keratin genes (from Krt7 to Kb25, Fig. 3A) in HHR and SDR. The Krt7 and Kb25 genes were amplified, but neither the Krt2-25, RGD1305207, Kb21, Kb26, nor Kb23 were amplified in HHR (Fig. 3A), indicating the deletion of a region containing Krt2-25 to Kb23 gene loci. PCR was repeated to define a deletion range precisely. A DNA portion over 850 bp downstream from the stop codon of the Krt2-25 (broken line a in Fig. 3B) and that around exon 6 of the Kb25 (d in Fig. 3B) were amplified in HHR (panels a and d in Fig. 3B), but a region near exon 6 of the Krt2-25 (b in Fig. 3B) or a portion over 850 bp downstream from the stop codon of the Kb25 (c in Fig. 3B) were not. Furthermore, PCR products were not amplified with the F1 and R1 primers in HHR, but amplified with the F2 and R2 primers (Fig. 3C). These results suggested that the F1 or R1 portions of the Kb25 were not present in HHR. A single PCR product of ∼1.3 kb with the F2 and R2 primers in HHR was much shorter than ∼80 kb theoretically expected from the SDR genomic sequence. PCR with the F2 and R1 primers was performed to define the junction portion in HHR, and the DNA sequence of the product was compared with that of SDR (Fig. 3, C and D). The HHR product showed the sequence of the Kb25 in the upstream sequence (boxes 1-4 in Fig. 3, D and E) but that of the Krt2-25 in the downstream sequence (box 5), whereas the SDR product exhibited only the Kb25 sequence in all boxes. These results indicated that breakpoints were within a 95-bp portion shared by both exon 9 of Kb25 and exon 9 of Krt2-25. Loss of Basic Hair Keratin Kb21 and Kb23 Expression in HHR Hairs—To examine whether hair protein profiles are different between HHR and SDR, proteins extracted from hairs of 5-month-old rats were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Protein staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue revealed two major bands at 51 kDa (basic hair keratin, Hb) and 40 kDa (acidic hair keratin, Ha) in SDR, whereas in HHR the 51-kDa band was markedly decreased and instead a 56-kDa band (Fig. 4A) became dominant. The SDR 51-kDa band was broad in electrophoretic mobility. The size of acidic keratins was not different between HHR and SDR. To examine the immunochemical relationship between the HHR 56-kDa and SDR 51-kDa proteins, Western blotting was performed with anti-Kb25 and anti-Kb21 antibodies. Anti-Kb25 antibody reacted not only with the HHR 56-kDa protein but also with the SDR 56-kDa protein that was very faint on protein staining (Fig. 4B). This antibody also reacted weakly with the HHR 51-kDa and SDR 51-kDa proteins. On the other hand, anti-Kb21 antibody reacted only with SDR 51-kDa proteins but not with HHR 56-kDa protein (Fig. 4C). These results indicated that the HHR 56-kDa protein was immunologically related to but not identical with the SDR 51-kDa proteins. To identify the basic hair keratins in the SDR 51-kDa proteins, the sample recovered from SDS gels was digested with trypsin, and their fragments were subjected to LC/ESI-MS analysis. This revealed the peptide fragments characteristic of Kb21 (ENSRNOT 00000012845), Kb23 (ENSRNOT 00000011222), and Krt2-25 (AB 354637) (underlined in Fig. 5). For the Kb21, Kb23, and Krt2-25 cDNAs, the respective two to four different forms have been reported (4Hesse M. Zimek A. Weber K. Magin T.M. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 83: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 31Rogers M.A. Edler L. Winter H. Langbein L. Beckmann I. Schweizer J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2005; 124: 536-544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). To confirm the data of the amino acid sequences by LC/ESI-MS and also to identify the keratin forms expressed in SDR skin, cDNAs encoding these keratins were prepared by RT-PCR as described under “Experimental Procedures” and sequenced. This demonstrated that the ENSRNOT 00000012845 and ENSRNOT 00000011222 forms were expressed as the Kb21 (481 aa) and Kb23 (479 aa), respectively. Although four forms (XP_001064518 (497 aa), ENSRNOT00000031257 (493 aa), XP_001060591 (491 aa), and XP_001060532 (440 aa)) have been reported as the rat Krt2-25 cDNA, this analysis also revealed that a new form with 495 aa was expressed in SDR. The nucleotide sequence of this form (accession number AB354637) as well as our data of Kb21 (AB355638) and Kb23 cDNAs (AB355639) are available in the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank™ databases. Expression of Kb25 as the Fusion Gene Product in HHR Hair—The HHR 56-kDa protein was also treated with trypsin and subjected to LC/ESI-MS analysis. The peptides exhibited the sequences of Kb25 reported as the ENSRNOP00000011644 (507-aa form), a splice variant of NP_001008811 (4Hesse M. Zimek A. Weber K. Magin T.M. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 83: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) (472-aa form), and these were different only in the C-terminal side encoded by exons 8 and 9 (Fig. 6). In this region the sequence of Kb25 (the 507-aa form) is very similar to the Krt2-25 (AB354637) except at the 479th residue, the base at the box 4 in Fig. 3D. Thus, the HHR 56-kDa protein was suggested as the product of a fusion gene of Kb25 and Krt2-25, but identical with the Kb25 itself in amino acid sequence. To demonstrate this, the fusion gene cDNA was prepared by RT-PCR employing the primers for exon 5 of the Kb25 and for the 3′ downstream sequence of Krt2-25 (R1 primer in Fig. 3D). Because the R1 primer was common for exon 9 of Kb25, the SDR Kb25 cDNA was also prepared with the same primer set. Sequencing of the SDR Kb25 cDNA indicated the sequence of ENSRNOP 00000011644 (Fig. 7A), and it differed from the Krt2-25 cDNA at 3 bases in exon 8 (shaded boxes in Fig. 7A) and 7 bases in exon 9 (shaded 1 base corresponding to the box 4 in Fig. 3D and shaded 6 bases in the 3′-untranslated region).FIGURE 7Identification of the HHR 56-kDa protein as the product of Kb25-Krt2-25 fusion gene.A, nucleotide sequences of RT-PCR products from a HHR Kb25-Krt2-25 fusion gene, SDR Kb25 gene, and SDR Krt2-25 gene. RT-PCR was carried out employing primers for exon 5 of Kb25 and for the 3′-downstream sequence of Krt2-25, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The partial sequences of the regions corresponding to exons 7-9 of the genes are presented. The sequences of the HHR fusion gene cDNA and SDR Krt2-25 cDNA are shown by hyphens when they are identical with those of SDR Kb25 cDNA. The three shaded bases in exon 8 and one base in exon 9 (corresponding to box 4 in Fig. 3D) differ between Kb25 and Krt2-25 genes. The six shaded bases in the 3′-untranslated region (box 5 in Fig. 3D) are present in SDR Kb25 cDNA but absent in Krt2-25 cDNA and HHR fusion gene cDNA (bold solid lines). Amino acid sequences are also described in a single letter. An asterisk denotes the stop codon.

With anti-Kb21 antibody the hair cortex of SDR showed positive reaction, but HHR hair follicles were negative (Fig. 8), confirming the deletion of basic keratin genes, including Kb21 in HHR. Staining with anti-Kb25 antibody revealed positive reaction in the cortex (black arrows in Fig. 8) and companion layer (open arrowheads) of HHR. In SDR, the medulla (red arrows) and companion layer were stained, but the hair cortex was not. Thus, Kb25 expression in the cortex and medulla was opposite between HHR and SDR. The present study has revealed that genes responsible for HHR are located on chromosome 7q36 (Fig. 1), and an 80-kb genomic DNA ranging from the downstream of the Kb25 locus to the Krt2-25 is deleted (Fig. 7B). This region includes the Krt2-25, RGD130527, Kb21, Kb26, and Kb23 genes. In accordance with the deletion of these genes, the Kb21, Kb23 and Krt2-25 proteins (51-kDa proteins) were not expressed in HHR (Figs. 2 and 4). In place of the 51-kDa proteins, the 56-kDa protein that was very minor in SDR was dominant in HHR. The nucleotide sequence of the Krt2-25 gene is highly homologous to that of Kb25, and the breakpoints of these genes are within a 95-bp portion shared by both the terminal region of exon 9 of the two genes (Figs. 3 and 7), suggesting that the deletion is due to non-allelic homologous recombination. Fusion of the Kb25 gene to Krt2-25 in HHR raises the possible production of a fusion protein. The sequence of the HHR fusion gene cDNA was identical to that of the SDR Kb25 cDNA in most parts but with the Krt2-25 cDNA in the 3′-untranslated region. In fact, mass spectrometry analysis revealed that the sequence of the HHR 56-kDa protein is identical to that of the wild-type Kb25. These findings suggest that the fusion of the two genes occurs between the exons with the same nucleotide sequence without any alterations in codon frame. A unique basic cytokeratin, K6hf (Krt75), is reported to be expressed in the medulla and companion layer of the mouse and human (32Winter H. Langbein L. Praetzel S. Jacobs M. Rogers M.A. Leigh I.M. Tidman N. Schweizer J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1998; 111: 955-962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 33Wang Z. Wong P. Langbein L. Schweizer J. Coulombe P.A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2003; 121: 1276-1282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The present study revealed Kb25 to be expressed in the same regions as K6hf. Although the human equivalent of the rat Krt2-25 is considered as a pseudogene (4Hesse M. Zimek A. Weber K. Magin T.M. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 83: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 31Rogers M.A. Edler L. Winter H. Langbein L. Beckmann I. Schweizer J. J. Invest.

Parry D.A.D. Rogers M.A. Wright M.W. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar), it is transcribed and translated in SDRs. Thus, different basic keratins are expressed in the particular regions of hair follicles between SDRs and humans or mice. This study also suggested that different Kb21, Kb23, Kb25, and Krt2-25 forms due to alternative splicing are expressed between Norway rats and SDRs (4Hesse M. Zimek A. Weber K. Magin T.M. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 83: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Thus, differences in splicing of the individual keratin transcripts may be involved in the multiplicity of keratins in some strains of the rat. Human HB1, -3, and -6, the orthologs of rat Kb21,-23, and -26, respectively, are reported to be expressed in hair cortex (5Langbein L. Schweizer J. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2005; 243: 1-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). We confirmed Kb21 to be expressed in the cortex of SDR (Fig. 8). In HHR, Kb25, instead of Kb21, was expressed in the cortex but not expressed in the medulla, the site of its expression in SDR. Not only loss of Kb21,-23, and -26 genes but also altered regulation of Kb25 gene is suggested to be responsible for the defective hair follicle formation in HHR. Detailed characterization of HHR hair follicles is now under active study. Although anti-Kb25 antibody cross-reacted with the SDR 51-kDa proteins on Western blotting (Fig. 4B), hair cortex was not stained on immunohistochemistry (Fig. 8A). Because the latter was carried out with the antibody at a very low concentration, only Kb25 seemed to be stained. The shorn (shn) and CR hairless rats share similar properties in hair as HHRs. However, lifespan is normal in HHR but shorn rats die before 14 months of age. The shn gene is mapped between D7Got143 and D7Rat94 in 7q36 (35Chrissluis R.R. Stoklasek T.A. Loman J.A. Guariglia A. King T.R. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2002; 76: 335-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar), but responsible genes have not been identified. The gene responsible for hereditary hypotrichotic mouse, hague, is mapped on the telomeric region of chromosome 15, very close to the basic keratin gene cluster of the mouse (36Poirier C. Yoshiki A. Fujiwara K. Guenet J.L. Kusakabe M. Genetics. 2002; 162: 831-840Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but is not identified. Thus, these rat and mouse models seem to share mutations in or around the basic keratin gene cluster. Homologous recombination is the exchange or replacement of a DNA region between homologous chromosomes or chromatids. It also occurs between similar DNA sequences of non-homologous chromosomes or within a chromosome (37Lupski J.R. Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 974-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). These rearrangements lead to the loss or gain of genes (38Sharp A.J. Hansen S. Selzer R.R. Cheng Z. Regan R. Hurst J.A. Stewart H. Price S.M. Blair E. Hennekam R.C. Fitzpatrick C.A. Segraves R.

Because basic hair keratin genes have highly homologous sequences, these loci are possible hot spots for non-allelic homologous recombination. Frequent assignment of genes responsible for alopecia to the vicinity of these loci in the rodent models supports this possibility. However, the multiplicity of basic keratin genes may compensate for the loss of particular types by the expression of other types. Thus, the deletion of massive DNA domain may be required for abnormal hair formation. The rodent models of hypotrichosis due to alterations in keratin genes will be useful for exploring responsible genes in such patients, because the arrangement of the individual keratin gene loci is conserved between humans and animal species (31Rogers M.A. Edler L.

https://openalex.org/W2149622774,"N-Glycans of Entamoeba histolytica, the protist that causes amebic dysentery and liver abscess, are of great interest for multiple reasons. E. histolytica makes an unusual truncated N-glycan precursor (Man(5)GlcNAc(2)), has few nucleotide sugar transporters, and has a surface that is capped by the lectin concanavalin A. Here, biochemical and mass spectrometric methods were used to examine N-glycan biosynthesis and the final N-glycans of E. histolytica with the following conclusions. Unprocessed Man(5)GlcNAc(2), which is the most abundant E. histolytica N-glycan, is aggregated into caps on the surface of E. histolytica by the N-glycan-specific, anti-retroviral lectin cyanovirin-N. Glc(1)Man(5)GlcNAc(2), which is made by a UDP-Glc: glycoprotein glucosyltransferase that is part of a conserved N-glycan-dependent endoplasmic reticulum quality control system for protein folding, is also present in mature N-glycans. A swainsonine-sensitive alpha-mannosidase trims some N-glycans to biantennary Man(3)GlcNAc(2). Complex N-glycans of E. histolytica are made by the addition of alpha1,2-linked Gal to both arms of small oligomannose glycans, and Gal residues are capped by one or more Glc. In summary, E. histolytica N-glycans include unprocessed Man(5)GlcNAc(2), which is a target for cyanovirin-N, as well as unique, complex N-glycans containing Gal and Glc."
https://openalex.org/W2074213586,"Although ringed seals are important components in oceanic and fresh water ecosystems at high latitudes, little is known about how they exploit these harsh environments. Seasonal activity and diving behaviour of 19 adult Baltic ringed seals were studied by satellite telemetry. We elaborated an activity budget for ten months of the year, extending over the period from moult to the breeding season. Seals from three main regions showed explicit site fidelity and the distributions of animals tagged from different areas did not overlap, suggesting separate stocks. Both the mean duration and the mean depth of dives peaked in June and July. Seals spent 70% (females) to 85% (males) of their time diving in June and July which decreased to 50% in late autumn. Less than one percent of dives exceeded 10 min in females, while 10% of male dives lasted longer than 10 min in June to September. Less than one percent of dives lasted for more than 25 min. Both females and males were most active during day time and hauled out predominantly during the night. Activity patterns during the summer are suggested to be correlated to energy accumulation and prey availability. The information on seasonal activity budget is crucial for developing population energetic models where interactions between ringed seals and other trophic levels can be evaluated."
https://openalex.org/W2083469395,"Previous efforts aimed at the biochemical characterization of chloroplast HSP70B were hampered by the observation that recombinant HSP70B was inactive, i.e. incompetent of interacting with its nucleotide exchange factor CGE1. In addition, because heterologously expressed mitochondrial Hsp70 was inactive unless coexpressed with the escort protein Hep1, we wondered whether homologs of Hep1 existed in the chloroplast. Data base searches revealed that algae and higher plants indeed encode at least two HEP homologs, one predicted to be targeted to mitochondria, the others to chloroplasts. Using Chlamydomonas reinhardtii as plant model organism we demonstrate that this alga encodes an HEP homolog (termed HEP2) that is localized to the stroma. HEP2 is expressed constitutively as a low abundance protein with an apparent molecular mass of ∼21 kDa. In cell extracts HEP2 interacts with HSP70B in an ATP-dependent fashion. Coexpression of HSP70B with HEP2 in Escherichia coli yielded high levels of CGE1-binding competent HSP70B, which also displayed ATPase activity. Inactive HSP70B was more prone to proteolysis than active HSP70B. Although inactive HSP70B interacted with HEP2, it could not be activated. Active HSP70B remained active for 48 h in the absence of HEP2, suggesting that HEP2 was not involved in maintaining HSP70B in an active state. However, some HSP70B expressed as a fusion protein with an N-terminal extension was activated when HEP2 was present during cleavage of the fusion protein, suggesting that in vivo HEP2 might be required for de novo folding of HSP70B after transit peptide cleavage.

Except for some Archaea, chaperones of the Hsp70 family are found in all known organisms and are present in every compartment of the eukaryotic cell. Hsp70 chaperones consist of an N-terminal ATPase domain, which is functionally linked to a C-terminal substrate-binding domain (1Wegele H. Müller L. Buchner J. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 151: 1-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 2Mayer M.P. Bukau B. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 670-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (1993) Google Scholar). Hsp70s bind substrates with low affinity in the ATP state and with high affinity in the ADP state. Binding of Hsp70 shields hydrophobic surfaces exposed by the substrate from the environment, thus protecting substrates from aggregation. Moreover, by the power stroke exerted by Hsp70s following ATP hydrolysis (3Pierpaoli E.V. Sandmeier E. Baici A. Schonfeld H.J. Gisler S. Christen P. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 757-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), and/or by their intrinsic secondary amide peptide bond cis-trans isomerase activity (4Schiene-Fischer C. Habazettl J. Schmid F.X. Fischer G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), the conformation of bound substrates may be altered, which in turn may allow non-native proteins to attain the native state. Thus, Hsp70s play a major role in the folding of nascent chains and in the renaturation of non-native proteins that have accumulated during stress situations such as heat shock (2Mayer M.P. Bukau B. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 670-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (1993) Google Scholar, 5Frydman J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 603-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar). However, Hsp70s have also highly specialized functions such as the regulation of the heat stress response (6Tomoyasu T. Ogura T. Tatsuta T. Bukau B. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 567-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), the uncoating of clathrin-coated vesicles (7Ungewickell E. Ungewickell H. Holstein S.E.H. Lindner R. Prasad K. Barouch W. Martin B. Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. Nature. 1995; 378: 632-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar), or the translocation of proteins across membranes (8Kang P.J. Ostermann J. Shilling J. Neupert W. Craig E.A. Pfanner N. Nature. 1990; 348: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Specificity of Hsp70 function is mediated largely by its cochaperones, of which the J-domain cochaperones represent an important class (9Craig E.A. Huang P. Aron R. Andrew A. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2006; 156: 1-21PubMed Google Scholar, 10Qiu X.B. Shao Y.M. Miao S. Wang L. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2006; 63: 2560-2570Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). Similarly important are cochaperones that regulate the affinity for nucleotides of their Hsp70 partner. For example, most prokaryotic Hsp70s require a GrpE-type nucleotide exchange factor, which is termed Mge1 in mitochondria (11Laloraya S. Gambill B.D. Craig E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6481-6485Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and CGE1 in chloroplasts (12Schroda M. Vallon O. Whitelegge J.P. Beck C.F. Wollman F.-A. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 2823-2839Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In contrast to the well studied Hsp70 systems in bacteria, cytosol, endoplasmic reticulum, and mitochondria, comparably little is known on Hsp70 functions in the chloroplast (13Boston R.S. Viitanen P.V. Vierling E. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 32: 191-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, 14Miernyk J.A. Plant Physiol. 1999; 121: 695-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 15Schroda M. Photosynth. Res. 2004; 82: 221-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Although Hsp70 proteins on the outer chloroplast membrane and within the inner membrane space appear to participate in protein import (16Kourtz L. Ko K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2808-2813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 17Schnell D.J. Kessler F. Blobel G. Science. 1994; 266: 1007-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), evidence for a role of stromal Hsp70 in this process is lacking. In Chlamydomonas, the stromal Hsp70 is termed HSP70B (18Drzymalla C. Schroda M. Beck C.F. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 31: 1185-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Stromal Hsp70 is involved in the maturation of chloroplast proteins (19Chen G.G. Jagendorf A.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 1165-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), and in the assembly/disassembly of VIPP1 oligomers (24Liu C. Willmund F. Whitelegge J.P. Hawat S. Knapp B. Lodha M.

Plant J. 2007; 50: 265-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Furthermore, stromal HSP70B was found to interact with plastidic HSP90C (26Willmund F. Schroda M. Plant Physiol. 2005; 138: 2310-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We reported previously that Chlamydomonas HSP70B heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli was incapable of interacting with its nucleotide exchange factor CGE1; in contrast, HSP70B isolated from Chlamydomonas cell extracts did interact with CGE1 (27Willmund F. Mühlhaus T. Wojciechowska M. Schroda M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 11317-11328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These observations suggested that additional factor(s) present in its native cellular environment were required to activate HSP70B or to maintain it in an active state. In yeast, a 17-kDa zinc finger-containing protein termed Zim17 was found to localize to the mitochondrial matrix and to play an essential role in the import of preproteins into mitochondria (28Burri L. Vascotto K. Fredersdorf S. Tiedt R. Hall M.N. Lithgow T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50243-50249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The same protein was called Tim15, because it was found to be associated with the inner mitochondrial membrane (29Yamamoto H. Momose T. Yatsukawa Y. Ohshima C. Ishikawa D. Sato T. Tamura Y. Ohwa Y. Endo T. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 507-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The role of Zim17/Tim15 in protein import was verified and shown to be at the level of mitochondrial Hsp70 (mtHsp70 or Ssc1), with which Zim17/Tim15 interacts physically. Sichting et al. (30Sichting M. Mokranjac D. Azem A. Neupert W. Hell K. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1046-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) demonstrated that Zim17/Tim15 prevented aggregation not only of Ssc1, but also of Ssq1, the second mitochondrial HSP70. In the absence of Zim17/Tim15, aggregated Ssc1 and Ssq1 can no longer carry out their essential functions in the organelle, i.e. preprotein import and Fe/S cluster biogenesis, respectively. Because Zim17/Tim15 was shown not to be part of the Tim23 complex and to account for its function in keeping mitochondrial Hsp70s in an active state, Zim17/Tim15 was termed Hep1 (mtHsp70 escort protein 1). According to the recently resolved NMR structure of yeast mitochondrial Hep1, the protein is an L-shaped molecule (31Momose T. Ohshima C. Maeda M. Endo T. EMBO Rep. 2007; 8: 664-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). One leg of the “L” is formed by two two-stranded, antiparallel β-sheets which, at their connecting loops, each contain two cysteines that coordinate one Zn2+ ion. Mutation of residues located to this part of Hep1 affected the function of the molecule most severely (29Yamamoto H. Momose T. Yatsukawa Y. Ohshima C. Ishikawa D. Sato T. Tamura Y. Ohwa Y. Endo T. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 507-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 31Momose T. Ohshima C. Maeda M. Endo T. EMBO Rep. 2007; 8: 664-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). In the present study, we demonstrate that a homolog of Hep1, termed HEP2, exists also in chloroplasts. We show that HEP2 interacts with the plastidic HSP70B protein both in vitro and in Chlamydomonas cell extracts. Coexpression of HSP70B and HEP2 in E. coli yielded HSP70B that was capable of interacting with its cochaperone CGE1. Our data suggest that HEP2 is not involved in maintaining HSP70B in an active state but might be required for correct de novo folding of HSP70B after transit peptide cleavage. We propose that a common feature of mitochondrial and plastidic Hsp70 proteins is their requirement for HEP homologs to attain the active state. Cells and Culture Conditions—Chlamydomonas reinhardtii strains were grown photomixotrophically in TAP medium (for composition, see Ref. 32Harris E.H.

For chloroplast isolation, cells were grown in TAP medium supplemented with 0.5% peptone. Wild-type strain cc124 was used for Figs. 2C and 4B; cw15 strain CF185 (23Schroda M. Vallon O. Wollman F.-A.

Cell. 2005; 16: 1165-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) was first reverse transcribed into cDNA using an oligo(dT) primer and Molony murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (New England Biolabs). The cDNA was used as template to PCR amplify the HEP2-coding region using a 5′ primer (5′-GGACTAGTGCTCTTCCAACGCGACAGTGGACCCGATTC-3′) and a 3′ primer (5′-CCTAGCTACTCGAGTACAAATG-3′). The resulting 459-bp PCR product was cloned into the TOPO vector (Invitrogen), yielding pMS396. To destroy the SapI restriction site within the cloned HEP2 cDNA by silent mutagenesis, two more PCRs were performed on pMS396 using 5′ primer T3 and 3′ primer 5′-CAAATTAGTACTCTTCACCTG-3′, and 5′ primer 5′-AGAGTACTAATTTGGAGCGCC-3′ and 3′ primer T7. The ∼350-bp 5′-PCR product was digested with EcoRI-ScaI, the ∼230-bp 3′-PCR product was digested with ScaI-NotI, and both fragments were ligated into EcoRI-NotI-digested pBluescript (Stratagene), yielding pMS408. Next, pMS408 was cleaved with SapI-XhoI, and the resulting ∼490-bp fragment was ligated into SapI-XhoI-digested pTYB11 (New England Biolabs), generating pMS410. pMS410 was transformed into strain ER2566 and, like CGE1b (pMS301) and HSP70B (pMS307), HEP2 was expressed with an intein/chitin binding domain fused to its N terminus, purified by chitin affinity chromatography, and eluted after thiol-induced cleavage as described earlier (26Willmund F. Schroda M. Plant Physiol. 2005; 138: 2310-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 27Willmund F. Mühlhaus T. Wojciechowska M. Schroda M. J. Biol.

Affinity purification of HEP2 antibodies was done according to Ref. 26Willmund F. Schroda M. Plant Physiol. 2005; 138: 2310-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar. For the expression of HSP70B with a C-terminal hexahistidine tag from vector pCDF, a ∼620-bp fragment coding for the N-terminal part of mature HSP70B was amplified by PCR from pCB611, which contains the HSP70B cDNA. The 5′ primer used was 5′-GTCCCCATGGAGAAGGTCGTGGGTATCGATCTGGCACGACCAACTCGGCTGTGGCTGCGATGGAGGG-3′, the 3′ primer used was 5′-CCCACCTGCAGCACTGAC-3′. The ∼620-bp fragment was digested with NcoI and PstI and cloned into the NcoI-PstI-digested pCDF vector (Novagen, Madison, WI), giving pCDF-70BN. The sequence encoding the C-terminal part of HSP70B was amplified by PCR using pCB611 as template, the same 5′ primer as used above, and 3′ primer 5′-GCCTCAATGCAGGAAGCTTAATGGTGATGGTGATGGTGCTTCTTGTCAGTGAACTC-3′. The ∼2-kb PCR product obtained was digested with MscI and HindIII, and the resulting ∼1.8-kb fragment was cloned into MscI-HindIII-digested pCDF-70BN, yielding pMS461. For the dual expression of HSP70B with HEP2, a PCR was performed on pMS396 with 5′ primer 5′-GTGCCATATGACAGTGGACCCGATTCC-3′ and 3′ primer 5′-CCTAGCTACTCGAGTACAAATG-3′. The ∼440-bp product was cut with NdeI and XhoI and cloned into NdeI-XhoI-digested pMS461, giving pMS462. For the purification of hexahistidine-tagged HSP70B, pMS461 and pMS462 were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) cells (Novagen), and proteins after induction with 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside were purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). An additional washing step with 25 mm imidazole, 5 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm ATP was performed before eluting the proteins with 200 mm imidazole and KMH buffer (80 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 2.5 mm MgCl2). Imidazole was largely removed by three successive runs of concentration/dilution with KMH buffer using Amicon Ultra-4 tubes (Millipore, Molsheim, France). Proteins were supplemented with 10% glycerol and 1 mm dithiothreitol, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C. PAGE and Gel Blot Analyses—Protein solubilization, SDS-PAGE, gel staining, and gel blot analyses were performed as described earlier (24Liu C. Willmund F. Whitelegge J.P. Hawat S. Knapp B. Lodha M.

Immunoprecipitations—For immunoprecipitations from Chlamydomonas soluble cell extracts (Fig. 5C), CF185 cells were grown to a density of ∼8 × 106 cells/ml, harvested, washed twice with KH buffer (80 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5) and resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 154 mm NaCl, 0.25 × protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany)). For ATP depletion and ATP repletion, cells were split in two equal fractions, 10 units of apyrase were added to one fraction (–ATP), 2.5 mm ATP, 80 mm creatine phosphate, and 0.125 μg/μl creatine kinase were added to the other fraction (+ATP). Cross-linking of protein complexes was performed using DSP 2The abbreviation used is: DSP, dithio-bis(succinimidyl propionate). (Perbio Science, Bonn, Germany) at a final concentration of 2 mm, which was added to the mixture prior to cell lysis. Cells were lysed by sonication on ice for 90 s, and cross-linking was performed under agitation for 1 h at 4 °C. Cross-linking was arrested by the addition of glycine to a final concentration of 100 mm and incubation for 15 min at 4 °C. Subsequently, lysates were loaded onto sucrose cushions (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 0.6 m sucrose) and centrifuged in a Ti-50 rotor for 30 min at 152,000 × g and 4 °C. Antibody coupling and immunoprecipitations were carried out as described previously (12Schroda M. Vallon O. Whitelegge J.P. Beck C.F. Wollman F.-A.

Elution of immunoprecipitated proteins and cleavage of DSP were done by adding one volume of 2× Laemmli sample buffer and boiling for 5 min at 95 °C. For the immunoprecipitation experiments shown in Fig. 2D, Chlamydomonas soluble cell extracts were generated as described above, but without the ATP-depletion/repletion and cross-linking steps. After centrifugation, the membrane pellet was resolved in lysis buffer containing 2% Triton X-100. Prior to immunoprecipitation an additional sucrose cushion centrifugation for 30 min at 152,000 × g and 4 °C was performed. For in vitro immunoprecipitations (Figs. 6A and 8), 100-μl reaction mixtures with the concentrations of purified proteins given in the figure legends were incubated in KMH buffer supplemented with 250 μg bovine serum albumin for 30 min at 23 °C. For ATP depletion, 1 unit of apyrase was added. The ATP regeneration system consisted of 13.75 mm creatine phosphate and 14 μg/ml creatine kinase. Immunoprecipitations were performed as described earlier (27Willmund F. Mühlhaus T. Wojciechowska M. Schroda M. J. Biol.

Samples were collected at the times indicated, and 10% of each sample was withdrawn as input control. To the sample containing only HSP70B, CGE1 (in square brackets) was added thereafter. Following ATP depletion with apyrase, samples were incubated with protein-A-Sepharose beads coupled to antibodies against HSP70B for immunoprecipitation (IP). Input control and precipitates were separated on an SDS-7.5 to 15% polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by immunoblotting. B, equal amounts of mature HSP70B fused N-terminally to the intein/chitin binding domain were bound to two chitin columns. On-column thiol-induced cleavage was carried out in the presence or absence of 30 μg of purified recombinant HEP2 overnight. Cleaved HSP70Bs were eluted and concentrated, and 360 nm each were mixed with 150 nm purified recombinant CGE1b in the presence of apyrase. 5% of each mixture was used as input control; the remainder was incubated with protein-A-Sepharose beads coupled to antibodies against HSP70B for immunoprecipitation (IP). Input control and precipitates were separated on an SDS-7.5 to 15% polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by immunoblotting.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) For immunoprecipitations from soluble E. coli cell extracts (Fig. 6B), 100 ml of BL21(DE3) cells were grown to an A600 of 0.6. Protein expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm, and cells were harvested after 3-h incubation at 25 °C. Cells were resuspended in lysis buffer containing either 5 units of apyrase or 5 mm ATP, 10 mm creatine phosphate, 35 μgof creatine kinase. Cells were lysed by sonication on ice for 90 s, and lysates were cleared by centrifugation for 20 min at 20,000 × g and 4 °C. Immunoprecipitations from cleared lysates were done as above. Protease Sensitivity Assays—10 μg of purified HSP70B proteins were used in 20-μl reaction mixtures, including KMH buffer and trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) at the amounts indicated in the figure legends. Mixtures were incubated on ice for 5 min. Then 5 μl of 25 × protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) was added, followed by one volume of 2× Laemmli sample buffer. Miscellaneous—Isolation of chloroplasts and fractionation into stroma, thylakoids, and low density membranes was done as described previously (36Zerges W. Rochaix J.-D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Mitochondria were isolated following a published protocol (37Eriksson M. Gardeström P. Samuelsson G.

Quantification of cellular protein concentrations, RNA extraction, and heat shock kinetics were done as published (24Liu C. Willmund F. Whitelegge J.P. Hawat S. Knapp B. Lodha M. Schroda M. Mol.

Plant Physiol. 2005; 138: 2310-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), but reactions were incubated at 25 °C in the presence of 100 μm unlabeled ATP. All experiments have been repeated at least three times and, except for Fig. 6C, one representative experiment is shown. Algae and Higher Plants Encode HEP Homologs Predicted to Be Targeted to Mitochondria and Chloroplasts—We reported recently that chloroplast HSP70B heterologously expressed in E. coli was not capable of interacting with its CGE1 cochaperone (27Willmund F. Mühlhaus T. Wojciechowska M. Schroda M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 11317-11328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Also the yeast mitochondrial Hsp70 Ssc1 was non-functional when it was heterologously expressed in E. coli, unless it was coexpressed with Hep1 (30Sichting M. Mokranjac D. Azem A. Neupert W. Hell K. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1046-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This finding prompted us to suspect that there might be chloroplast homologs of Hep1 that similarly were required to ensure functionality of chloroplast Hsp70s. Therefore, we used the yeast Hep1 amino acid sequence to search for genes encoding HEP homologs in the genome sequences of algae and higher plants. Strikingly, all algal and higher plant genomes investigated contained at least two genes encoding HEP homologs. According to the TargetP program (38Emanuelsson O. Nielsen H. Brunak S. von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 1005-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (3560) Google Scholar), one of these HEP homologs was predicted to be targeted to mitochondria, the others to chloroplasts (only for the Chlamydomonas HEP homologs predictions were ambivalent, most likely because Chlamydomonas chloroplast transit peptides resemble mitochondrial signal peptides of higher plants (39Franzén L.-G. Rochaix J.-D. von Heijne G. FEBS Lett. 1990; 280: 165-168Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar)). In accordance with these predictions, mitochondrial and chloroplast HEP homologs in phylogenetic analyses formed separate clades (Fig. 1A). We could not find genes encoding HEP homologs in bacterial genomes. Both chloroplast and mitochondrial HEP homologs share invariable amino acids within the zinc finger domain (Fig. 1B). Within this region distinct amino acids were found that might serve as signatures for chloroplast and mitochondrial HEP homologs. The putative chloroplast HEP homolog in Chlamydomonas was termed HEP2 and was subject of our further investigation. Chlamydomonas HEP2 Is a Soluble, Constitutively Expressed Protein with an Apparent Molecular Mass of ∼21 kDa—To raise a HEP2-specific antibody and to further characterize the HEP2 protein biochemically, we heterologously expressed Chlamydomonas HEP2 lacking its putative chloroplast transit peptide in E. coli (Fig. 2A). We used the TargetP cleavage site prediction for the Ostreococcus HEP2 transit peptide (SVR/A) as a guide and assumed ACR/A, situated at the same position within Chlamydomonas HEP2, as cleavage site (Fig. 1B). Purified recombinant HEP2 migrated at ∼21 kDa, although its calculated molecular mass was 14.9 kDa (Fig. 2A, lane 6). To determine whether recombinant HEP2 formed dimers or oligomers we subjected purified recombinant HEP2 to gel filtration analysis. As shown in Fig. 2B, virtually the entire protein eluted as a ∼26-kDa species. This would be close to the size of a dimer (29.8 kDa), if HEP2 behaved like a globular protein. However, we cannot exclude that HEP2 monomers have an elongated shape and consequently migrated faster through the gel filtration mat"
https://openalex.org/W2094607077,"The mature form of l-phenylalanine oxidase (PAOpt) from Pseudomonas sp. P-501 was generated and activated by the proteolytic cleavage of a noncatalytic proenzyme (proPAO). The crystal structures of proPAO, PAOpt, and the PAOpt-o-amino benzoate (AB) complex were determined at 1.7, 1.25, and 1.35Å resolutions, respectively. The structure of proPAO suggests that the prosequence peptide of proPAO occupies the funnel (pathway) of the substrate amino acid from the outside of the protein to the interior flavin ring, whereas the funnel is closed with the hydrophobic residues at its vestibule in both PAOpt and the PAOpt-AB complex. All three structures have an oxygen channel that is open to the surface of the protein from the flavin ring. These results suggest that structural changes were induced by proteolysis; that is, the proteolysis of proPAO removes the prosequence and closes the funnel to keep the active site hydrophobic but keeps the oxygen channel open. The possibility that an interaction of the hydrophobic side chain of substrate with the residues of the vestibule region may open the funnel as a putative amino acid channel is discussed.

P-501 catalyzes both the oxidative deamination and oxygenative decarboxylation of l-Phe, l-Tyr, l-Trp, and l-Met as a substrate (1Koyama H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1982; 92: 1235-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 2Koyama H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1983; 93: 1313-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 3Koyama H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1984; 96: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The enzyme was screened from bacteria in soil for the clinical determination of l-Phe (4Koyama H. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1984; 136: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 5Nakajima H. Koyama H. Suzuki H. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1991; 55: 3117-3118PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme has 2 mol of noncovalent FAD (2Koyama H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1983; 93: 1313-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and consists of 2 mol each of α and β subunits (6Mukouyama E.B. Suzuki H. Koyama H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 308: 400-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Of the above-mentioned amino acids, l-Phe is mainly oxygenated, and l-Met is mainly oxidized by PAO. Kinetic and resonance Raman studies of the enzyme revealed that PAO catalyzes the reaction by the ping-pong type mechanism (7Koyama H. Suzuki H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1986; 100: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and that the catalytically important species is the purple intermediate, which consists of a reduced enzyme and an imino acid derived from an amino acid substrate (8Suzuki H. Koyama H. Nishina Y. Sato K. Shiga K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1991; 110: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). We determined the nucleotide sequence of DNA encoding the enzyme protein (9Suzuki H. Higashi Y. Asano M. Suguro M. Kigawa M. Maeda M. Katayama S. Mukouyama E.B. Uchiyama K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2004; 136: 617-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). The open reading frame encoding a single polypeptide is arranged in the order of initiator Met, a prosequence (14 amino acid residues long), an α subunit (92 amino acid residues long), a dipeptide, and a β subunit (605 amino acid residues long). The polypeptide with the prosequence (proPAO) was successfully expressed in Escherichia coli (9Suzuki H. Higashi Y. Asano M. Suguro M. Kigawa M. Maeda M. Katayama S. Mukouyama E.B. Uchiyama K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2004; 136: 617-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The purified proPAO contains FAD, but the proenzyme does not show any catalytic activity. Protease (Pronase-trypsin mixture) treatment of proPAO initially removes only the Ile107-Lys108 dipeptide from proPAO, but the removal of this peptide does not lead to the expression of enzyme activity. Further treatment with the protease removes the prosequence from proPAO, and the resultant protein shows activity. The Pronase-trypsin-treated proPAO (PAOpt) 3The abbreviations used are: PAO, l-phenylalanine oxidase; PAOpt, PAO activated by Pronase and trypsin; AB, o-aminobenzoate; proPAO, noncatalytic proenzyme of PAO; LAO, l-amino acide oxidase. 3The abbreviations used are: PAO, l-phenylalanine oxidase; PAOpt, PAO activated by Pronase and trypsin; AB, o-aminobenzoate; proPAO, noncatalytic proenzyme of PAO; LAO, l-amino acide oxidase. showed spectral and kinetic properties comparable with the native enzyme.Several secreted enzymes are expressed as a proform. The prosequence usually acts as an intramolecular chaperone and/or an inhibitor of catalytic activity. The best studied examples are proteases, and these have been reviewed (10Khan A. James M.N. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 815-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 11Vendrell J. Querol E. Avilé F.X. Biochim. Biophys.

Proteolytic enzymes are synthesized as inactive precursors or zymogens to prevent unwanted protein degradation. Zymogen conversion to the active enzyme typically involves limited proteolysis and removal of the prosequence. X-ray crystallographic studies of zymogens and comparisons with their counterparts have identified the structural changes that accompany this conversion. As for flavoproteins, several enzymes are expressed as proforms, such as succinate dehydrogenase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (13Bullis B.L. Lemire B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6543-6549Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), pea ferredoxin-NADP reductase (14Serra E.C. Krapp A.R. Ottado J. Feldman M.F. Ceccarelli E.A. Carrillo N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19930-19935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), glucose-fructose oxidoreductase from Zymomonas mobilis (15Nurizzo D. Halbig D. Sprenger G.A. Baker E.N. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13857-13867Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and cellobiose dehydrogenase from Phanerochaete chrysosporium (16Raices M. Paifer E. Cremata J. Montesino R. Ståhlberg J. Divne C. Szabó I.J. Henriksson G. Johansson G. Pettersson G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 233-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The size of the prosequence of these enzymes are 18 residues long to 5-kDa molecular mass. Of these enzymes, the crystal structure of the precursor of glucose-fructose oxidoreductase is known (15Nurizzo D. Halbig D. Sprenger G.A. Baker E.N. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13857-13867Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Pre-glucose-fructose oxidoreductase consists of a tetramer, and the monomer has a prosequence with 52 residues (17Wiegert T. Sahm H. Sprenger G.A. Arch. Microbiol. 1996; 166: 32-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). N-terminal residues 1–83 extend from the monomer, although only residues 53–83, which represent the start of the mature enzyme, form an arm that wraps around a neighboring subunit of the tetramer (15Nurizzo D. Halbig D. Sprenger G.A. Baker E.N. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13857-13867Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). proPAO does not show enzyme activity (9Suzuki H. Higashi Y. Asano M. Suguro M. Kigawa M. Maeda M. Katayama S. Mukouyama E.B. Uchiyama K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2004; 136: 617-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), but pre-glucose-fructose oxidoreductase is fully active (18Loos H. Sahm H. Sprenger G.A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1993; 107: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). On the other hand, pre-ferredoxin-NADP reductase has a 5-kDa presequence at the N terminus and shows 1–5% activity of the mature form (14Serra E.C. Krapp A.R. Ottado J. Feldman M.F. Ceccarelli E.A. Carrillo N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19930-19935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Pre-ferredoxin-NADP reductase gains its full activity by proteolysis, but the change in the three-dimensional structure by proteolysis is not known.This work reports the crystal structures of proPAO, PAOpt, and the PAOpt-o-aminobenzoate (AB) complex at 1.7, 1.25, and 1.35 Å resolutions, respectively. Our results show that the 14-residue-long prosequence occupies a possible channel of the substrate amino acid to the active site flavin and that the prosequence is removed from the channel by proteolysis. We discuss the unique mechanism of the proteolytic activation of proPAO and the possible channels of amino acid and molecular oxygen.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPurification—proPAO was expressed in E. coli as described previously (9Suzuki H. Higashi Y. Asano M. Suguro M. Kigawa M. Maeda M. Katayama S. Mukouyama E.B. Uchiyama K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2004; 136: 617-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The cells were disrupted by sonication at 277 K. The supernatant was applied to HisTrap HP (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 500 mm NaCl. The protein was eluted with a linear gradient of imidazole from 0 to 0.5 m. The eluted fractions were collected, and ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant until 50% saturation. After keeping the solution for 16 h at 277 K, the precipitates were collected by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 30 min and dissolved in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 300 mm ammonium sulfate. The enzyme proteins in the solution were purified by several chromatographic procedures using HiTrap Phenyl FF (GE Healthcare), Resource Q (GE Healthcare), and finally HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 prep grade (GE Healthcare). The purity of the enzyme was confirmed by SDS-PAGE. PAOpt was obtained by the Pronase (Sigma-Aldrich) and trypsin treatment of proPAO. Immediately after treatment of proPAO, the activated enzyme was purified by HiTrap Q HP (GE Healthcare) and then by gel filtration as described for the purification of proPAO. Mass analysis of PAOpt was performed by the Peptide Institute using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, and two peaks with the masses of 9243.3 and 65533.9 were observed. These data and our previous work (9Suzuki H. Higashi Y. Asano M. Suguro M. Kigawa M. Maeda M. Katayama S. Mukouyama E.B. Uchiyama K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2004; 136: 617-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) suggest that the amino acid sequences of α and β subunits are residues 16–106 and 109–711, respectively, of the proPAO polypeptide. In this work, the residue number of PAO is expressed as that of the proPAO polypeptide.Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis of desired residues (Met142 and Lys478) in proPAO was carried out by using a QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit, following the manufacturer's recommendations (Stratagene). The desired mutation was introduced on the wild-type proPAO gene in the plasmid, pPAO+15 (9Suzuki H. Higashi Y. Asano M. Suguro M. Kigawa M. Maeda M. Katayama S. Mukouyama E.B. Uchiyama K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2004; 136: 617-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The mutagenic change was confirmed by sequencing the mutant plasmid gene. Sequencing was performed by the Genomic Research Department of Shimadzu-Biotech. The proPAO mutants were expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) and purified. The PAOpt mutants M142A and K478A were activated from the respective proPAO mutants and purified as described for the wild-type PAOpt.Assay of Enzyme Activity—The rate of the overall reaction was estimated by measuring the consumption of oxygen dissolved in the reaction mixture with a Clark-type oxygen electrode (Strathkelvin Instruments). The reaction mixture contained various concentrations of substrate in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) at 25 °C. The rate (v) was expressed as the moles of oxygen consumed per second at a given concentration of enzyme. The enzyme concentration was determined by measuring the amount of enzyme-bound flavins, assuming that the extinction coefficient of flavin is 11.3 mm-1 cm-1 at 450 nm. The apparent kinetic parameters kcat, Km, and Ki were calculated from the rates determined at various concentrations of l-Phe. The PAOpt used in this work showed an apparent kcat and Km for l-Phe to be 115.3 ± 2.5 s-1 and 15.9 ± 0.7 μm, respectively. These kinetic constants are comparable with those of the native enzyme (1Koyama H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1982; 92: 1235-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 2Koyama H. J. Biochem.

(Tokyo). 2004; 136: 617-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar).Crystallization—The purified protein in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) was concentrated to 10 mg ml-1 in an Amicon Ultra (Millipore) at 277 K. Crystallization was performed by a vapor diffusion method. The protein solutions were mixed with an equal volume of a reservoir solution consisting of 0.1 m HEPES (pH 7.5) and 1.7 m ammonium sulfate for proPAO and 0.1 m HEPES (pH 7.5) and 1.0 m ammonium sulfate for PAOpt at 293 K. The shapes of crystals are like gold ingots. The size of PAOpt crystal used was 1 mm3. The crystal had a different space group from the proPAO crystal (proPAO:P21212, PAOpt:P212121), and the diffraction spots extended beyond 1 Å. The crystals were soaked in crystallization buffer containing 30% glycerol as a cryoprotectant prior to the x-ray experiment, and the PAOpt-AB complex was prepared by a soaking method with the cryoprotectant. The concentration of AB and soaking time are 1 mm and 1 min, respectively.Data Collection, Structure Solution, and Refinement—Diffraction data sets were collected on NW12 in PF-AR and BL45XU at SPring-8. The quality of the diffraction data statistics are given in Table 1. The crystal structure of proPAO was solved using a selenomethionine-derivative crystal and the single-wavelength anomalous dispersion method. The structure could not be solved by the multiple-wavelength anomalous dispersion method, because the crystal was severely damaged by the radiation and could not maintain its isomorphism between the data sets. The experimental phase was calculated to a 2.1 Å resolution with SOLVE (19Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3219) Google Scholar), and density modification was carried out with Resolve (20Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (1631) Google Scholar). Initial model building was carried out automatically by the program ARP/wARP (21Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2562) Google Scholar), and additional model building was manually performed with O (22Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13004) Google Scholar). A refinement of the model was carried out using CNS (23Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16929) Google Scholar). The model at this stage was then used to estimate the phases of the native data set by the molecular replacement method using CNS, followed by phase extension to 1.7 Å resolution. Water molecules were assigned automatically by the program ARP/wARP. The initial phase of PAOpt was determined by the molecular replacement method using the atomic coordinates of the crystal structure of proPAO with MOLREP (24Vagin A.A. Isupov M.N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1451-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The refinements were performed at 1.35 Å resolution for the PAOpt-AB complex and 1.25 Å resolution for PAOpt. These structural refinements were carried out with REFMAC5 (25Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A.

The amino acid sequence of proPAO consists of an N-terminal 14 residues of prosequence, an α subunit, a dipeptide, and a β subunit (Fig. 1). Each monomer is related by a noncrystallographic 2-fold axis. The overall dimension of the dimer is ∼110 × 80 × 65 Å. Approximately 15% of the accessible surface area of the monomer is buried in the dimer interface consisting of 46 residues/monomer. Each monomer contains 18 α-helices and 19 β-strands, and they are folded into one region and two domains, namely, the prosequence (residues 1–14), the FAD-binding domain (residues 29–120, 148–162, 346–472, and 621 – C-terminal), and the substrate-binding domain (residues 15–28, 121–147, 163–345, and 473–620), respectively (Fig. 2A). Following a structural similarity search on proPAO in the Protein Data Bank using the Dali server (27Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3551) Google Scholar), polyamine oxidase (28; Z-score, 15.0), pyranose 2-oxidase (29; Z-score, 11.9), phenol 2-monooxygenase (30; Z-score, 11.2), and p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase (31; Z-score, 11.2) were found to have similar structures. In these structures, the FAD-binding domain is highly conserved, whereas the structures of the substrate-binding domain are different in these enzymes. It is interesting if a structural homolog of the substrate-binding domain exists. We performed a structural similarity search on the substrate-binding domain of proPAO and PAOpt by SSM (32Krissinel E. Henrick K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2256-2268Crossref PubMed Scopus (3100) Google Scholar) as described above. Polyamine oxidase showed the highest score (28; Z score, 4.2: proPAO, and 3.4: PAOpt) and had a “substrate tunnel” similar to that of proPAO and of PAOpt. The substrate spermine occupies the tunnel of polyamine oxidase just like the prosequence in the proPAO structure. The following regions of proPAO could not be modeled because of poor electron density: residues 105–108, 520–526, 547–561, 612–614, and the 704 C-terminal of chain A, and residues 129–132, 519–526, 548–563, 612–614, and the 705 C-terminal of chain B. These missing regions are located around the dimer interface and are likely in a random conformation. The structures of the missing area differ slightly between monomers. These differences are possibly caused by crystal packing.FIGURE 2Overall structure of PAO. A view of proPAO (A) and PAOpt monomers (B). The prosequence, FAD-binding domain, and substrate-binding domain are colored magenta, blue, and orange (proPAO) or cyan (PAOpt), respectively. A and B are shown in the same orientation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Structural Changes of proPAO to PAOpt—To understand the proteolytic activation of proPAO, we also determined the three-dimensional structure of PAOpt at 1.25 Å resolution by molecular replacement (Fig. 2B). The missing residues in the structure are 105, 522–525, and the 708 C-terminal of each chain. By proteolysis of proPAO, prosequence (Gly1–Glu14), Lys15, linker dipeptide (Ile107 and Lys108), and several C-terminal amino acid residues are removed (Fig. 1 and see “Experimental Procedures”).The superposition of the Cα atoms of PAOpt and proPAO results in a root mean square deviation of 0.84 Å by using Chimera (33Pettersen E.F. Goddard T.D. Huang C.C. Couch G.S. Greenblatt D.M. Meng E.C. Ferrin T.E. J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25: 1605-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (26757) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S2). The overall structures of proPAO and PAOpt are very similar, although there are two differences: one in the prosequence region in proPAO, and the other at Ala109 of the N terminus of the β subunit. Moreover, two loops, residues 547–561 and 612–614 in the substrate-binding domain, showed an electron density in PAOpt, but not in proPAO, suggesting that the conformation of the protein in these regions changes greatly by the proteolysis of proPAO to PAOpt.In the proPAO structure, residues Gly1 to Ile6 of the prosequence peptide occupy a funnel from the outside of the protein to the interior flavin ring, making hydrophobic interactions with the residues Gly172, Lys173, Val214, Phe311, Gly312, Thr313, Leu319, Leu330, Trp538, and Trp660 (Fig. 3A). The long side chain of Arg7 might be an anchor of the prosequence. The aperture of the funnel is narrower than the length of the side chain of Arg7. Several water molecules are found around the prosequence. Thr3 is located near the internal portion of the cavity (Fig. 3B), which was identified with the program VOIDOO (34Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 178-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar). The internal portion contains Thr3, Val4, and 10 water molecules in proPAO, whereas the cavity is lost and filled by Tyr335 in PAOpt (Fig. 3, A, C, and D). The N-terminal Gly residue of proPAO interacts with N-5 and C-4a atoms of the re-face of the flavin ring (Fig. 4A). The distances from the Gly1 amino nitrogen to the N-5 and C-4a atoms are 3.49 and 3.48 Å, respectively.FIGURE 3Cross-section views of funnels in proPAO (A and B) and PAOpt (C and D).

SO4 and GOL represent sulfate ion and glycerol, respectively, and are shown by a stick model.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 4View of flavin ring in proPAO (A) and PAOpt (B). The water molecule is shown by a CPK model (red).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The flavin ring has a planar conformation in proPAO, whereas it has a slightly bent and twisted (sloped down to the C8M atom) conformation (∼15°) in PAOpt (Fig. 4). This conformational change also induces Trp608 to cover the flavin ring and prevents the region from contact with solvent water (Fig. 4B). Two interactions induce the conformational change. One is the interaction between Asp602 upstream of Trp608 and Ala109 of the N terminus of the β subunit (supplemental Fig. S2). The other is the interaction between the Nϵ1 atom of Trp608 and the O atom of Val139 at the si-face of the flavin ring (Fig. 4B). At the re-face of the flavin ring, Phe617 and Trp660 form an “aromatic cage” (Fig. 4) similar to that observed in monoamine oxidase (Tyr398 and Tyr435) (35Li M. Binda C. Mattevi A. Edmondson D.E. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 4775-4784Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and are separated by 7.7 Å (in monoamine oxidase 7.8 Å). This suggests that by proteolysis, the flavin ring moves toward the aromatic cage and is bent. The bent flavin ring allows its N-5 atom to receive a hydrogen atom from the substrate easily, and the C8M of the ring bends in the direction of Trp608.Structure of PAOpt-AB Complex and Amino Acid Channel— The overall structures of proPAO and PAOpt are similar to each other (supplemental Fig. S2), although there is a difference at the prosequence region in proPAO. The flavin ring is buried deep inside the protein, and the funnel occupied by the prosequence of proPAO is probably a channel for the amino acid substrate, because the N-terminal Gly residue in proPAO interacted with the re-face of the flavin ring and is packed by the aromatic cage (Fig. 4A). We expected that the funnel in PAOpt is open to the outside of the protein molecule but closed with the hydrophobic residues, Phe311, Thr313, Met327, Leu330, Ile331, and Tyr335 (Fig. 3C and supplemental Fig. S3). The enzyme activity of PAOpt is comparable with that of the native enzyme (see “Experimental Procedures”). Thus, if the funnel that is occupied by the prosequence in proPAO is the amino acid (substrate) channel as we expected, then the substrate or substrate analogs must open the vestibule of the funnel. To clarify this point, we analyzed the crystal structure of the PAOpt-AB complex, because AB was determined to be a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme (Ki = 0.87 ± 0.11 mm).The structure of the PAOpt-AB complex was determined at 1.35 Å resolution. The inhibitor AB in the complex was clearly observed by the electron density (Fig. 5A). Unexpectedly, the structure clearly shows that the mouth of the funnel is closed. The amino group of AB interacts with the N-5 atom of the re-face of the flavin ring and the main chain O atom of Gly659. The distance from the nitrogen atom of AB to the N-5 atom of flavin is 3.57 Å. The carboxyl group of AB interacts with Arg143 and Thr313. It should be pointed out that AB interacts with the re-face of the flavin ring in a similar way that Gly1 of the prosequence interacts with the flavin ring (Figs. 4A and 5A). These observations allowed us to propose that the funnel is the channel for substrate amino acids. This proposal is supported by the observation that PAOpt contained a glycerol molecule and a sulfate ion in the funnel space (Fig. 4B and supplemental Fig. S3), because the sulfate ion and glycerol must enter from the outside of the protein molecule during the crystallization and soaking in cryoprotectant solution. The chemical modification study also supports the proposal (36Mukouyama E.B. Hirose T. Suzuki H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 123: 1097-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). That is, phenylglyoxal specifically modifies Arg143, and the modification is almost completely prevented by l-Phe. Moreover, our proposal is supported by a previous report on the structure of the AB complex with l-amino acid oxidase (LAO) (37Pawelek P.D. Cheah J. Coulombe R. Macheroux P. Ghisla S. Vrielink A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4204-4215Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). In the LAO-AB complex, three AB molecules are positioned in the funnel, although the PAOpt-AB complex contains only one molecule of AB in the funnel. In both the PAOpt-AB and LAO-AB compl"

Isothermal titration calorimetry measurements showed that the interactions of α2-I with collagen or RKKH peptide have similar affinities, and NMR chemical shift mapping experiments with 15N-labeled α2-I, and unlabeled RKKH peptide, indicate that the peptide competes for the collagen-binding site of α2-I but does not induce a large scale conformational rearrangement of the I domain.

The integrins constitute a functionally versatile family of integral membrane receptors that mediate cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions through their regulation of cell adhesion, differentiation, migration, and the immune response (1Hynes R.O.

Signal transduction is bi-directional through both outside-in and inside-out mechanisms. All integrins are heterodimers composed of subunits α and β. Different combinations of subunits are expressed on different cell types with the interplay of 19 α and 8 β subunits, generating a family of 25 different heterodimers (3Shimaoka M. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2002; 31: 485-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 5Luo B.H. Carman C.V. Springer T.A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 25: 619-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1245) Google Scholar). The integrin receptors share common structural features. The extracellular portions of the α and β subunits combine to form a globular “head” domain that is attached to a pair of membrane-spanning helical “stalks.” Signal transduction is believed to involve an allosteric rearrangement characterized by the separation and reorientation of the stalk segments. The bidirectional nature of signal transduction is complex. Extracellular ligands induce outside-in signals by binding to fixed motifs in the head domain, whereas inside-out signaling ensues from intracellular interactions between relatively short structurally plastic control elements and a large repertoire of cellular proteins. In nine of the human α subunits, ligand recognition is carried out by a 200-residue structurally conserved inserted (I) domain or a von Willebrand factor A domain (3Shimaoka M. Takagi J.

The importance of the α I domain for understanding conformational regulation and ligand binding for all integrins has been reviewed recently (5Luo B.H. Carman C.V. Springer T.A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 25: 619-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1245) Google Scholar). Integrin α2β1 is a member of the collagen/laminin receptor family and is a major receptor required for activation and adhesion of platelets, through the specific recognition of collagen by the α2-I domain (α2-I) (8Tuckwell D. Calderwood D.A. Green L.J. Humphries M.J. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1629-1637Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which binds fibrillar collagen via Mg2+-bridged interactions, supported by the MIDAS motif residues Asp-151, Ser-153, Thr-221, and Asp-254. The crystal structure of the α2-I domain, bound to a triple helical collagen peptide, revealed conformational changes from an unbound “closed” form to a bound “open” form, suggestive of a mechanism where the ligand-bound I domain can initiate and propagate conformational change to the full integrin complex (9Emsley J.

Collagen binding and fibrinogen-dependent platelet activity can be inhibited by snake venom polypeptide toxins, enhancing the effects of hemorrhagic venom metalloproteases. These so-called disintegrins are functional homologues of the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif found in extracellular matrix proteins. Integrin α2β1 associates with Jararhagin, a 52-kDa metalloprotease isolated from the venom of the Brazilian pit viper Bothrops jararaca, that targets multiple components in hemostasis, including von Willebrand factor, fibrinogen, and platelet aggregation. Anti-platelet activity is thought to stem from its specificity for the α2β1 integrin (10Paine M.J. Desmond H.P. Theakston R.D. Crampton J.M. J. Biol.

Notably, a short cyclic peptide derived from the jararhagin metalloprotease domain, containing the specific amino acid sequence RKKH, is sufficient to prevent binding of type I collagen to α2-I in a competitive manner and is capable of disrupting cell adhesion to type I collagen (15Ivaska J.

The inhibitory effects of the RKKH peptides on the homologous α1β1 integrin have been suggested to reflect the ability of the peptide to mimic the natural type I collagen ligand by inducing or stabilizing a conformational transition from the closed to the open form of the I domain (17Nymalm Y.

In this study we characterize the conformational dynamics of the α2-I domain and its interactions with collagen and RKKH peptides. Our studies show that the RKKH peptide binds the α2-I domain and inhibits its association with type I collagen, without inducing a conformational change in the α2-I domain. Materials—The pET-28b expression plasmid was from Invitrogen. (15NH4)2SO4, [13C]glucose, and D2O were purchased from Cambridge Isotopes Laboratories. Nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose was from Qiagen. The reverse phase Delta Pak C18 HPLC column (300 × 7.8 mm; 300 Å) was obtained from Waters. The 24-residue type I collagen peptide with the GFOGER recognition sequence (O = hydroxyproline, Hyp) was purchased in HPLC-purified powder form from Biomer Technology (Hayward, CA). The partially purified RKKH peptide was purchased from Genscript (Piscataway, NJ). The peptide sequences are shown in Fig. 1. Expression and Purification of Integrin α2-I Domain—The recombinant α2-I domain used in these studies corresponds to residues 144–334 of the human sequence (NCBI accession number NP_002194). The DNA coding for the sequence was inserted into the NdeI/XhoI site of the pET-28b expression plasmid (Invitrogen). For eventual chemical derivatization, Ser-334, at the C terminus, was mutated to Cys. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to convert Cys-150 to Leu. The resulting plasmid, pNHis-α2-I(144–334)C150L, has a His6 tag at the N terminus for purification. The sequence of the expressed protein is shown in Fig. 1. Recombinant α2-I domain was expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3). To prepare 15N- and 13C-labeled protein for NMR experiments, cells bearing pNHis-α2-I(144–334)C150L were grown in minimal M9 media containing (15NH4)2SO4 and/or [13C]glucose. Induction at A600 = 1 with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 2 h at 37 °C gave high level expression of the protein in the soluble fraction. Cells were lysed using a French press in buffer D (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 m NaCl, 30 mm imidazole), and the α2-I domain was purified by nickel-affinity chromatography on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose, in buffer C (50 mm Tris, pH 7, 1 m NaCl, 300 mm imidazole). The purified protein solution was dialyzed against two changes of buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl) with 1 mm EDTA, followed by two changes of buffer B (50 mm PO4, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgSO4) with 1 mm dithiothreitol, using dialysis membranes with a molecular weight cutoff of 10,000. The final yield of purified protein was 20 mg/liter of cell culture. For NMR experiments, the protein solution was concentrated by ultrafiltration to 0.7 mm (ϵ = 17330 cm-1m-1). For experiments with the RKKH peptide, the surface-exposed C-terminal Cys residue of the α2-I domain was alkylated with iodoacetamide as follows. Purified protein was dialyzed against four changes of buffer A. The protein was removed from the dialysis bag, reacted with 10 mm iodoacetamide for 10 h at 4 °C, dialyzed against two changes of buffer B, and concentrated by ultrafiltration. Formation of Collagen Triple Helix—To obtain a collagen triple helix, the 24-residue collagen peptide powder was suspended in buffer B at 1 mm concentration, heated to 45 °C, and then allowed to equilibrate at 4 °C for at least 12 h, as described previously (18Feng Y. Melacini G. Taulane J.P. Goodman M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 10351-10358Crossref Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Formation of Cyclic RKKH Peptide—Formation of cyclic peptide was obtained by forming a disulfide link between the terminal Cys residues as described (15Ivaska J. Kapyla J. Pentikainen O. Hoffren A.M. Hermonen J. Huttunen P. Johnson M.S. Heino J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3513-3521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The peptide was dissolved at 1 mg/ml concentration in 0.1 m NH4CO3 and incubated at 4 °C for 24 h. The reaction was flash-frozen and the water removed by lyophilization. The cyclized peptide was resuspended in HPLC grade water and purified by reverse phase HPLC. Peak fractions were combined, frozen, and lyophilized to powder. A colorimetric assay using 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), to test for the presence of free thiol, showed complete conversion to the cyclized product within the limits of detection. The cyclized peptide was suspended in buffer B immediately before experiments. NMR Spectroscopy—NMR experiments were performed on Bruker AVANCE 600- and 800-MHz spectrometers. The standard 1H/15N fast HSQC pulse sequence was used for experiments with peptides (19Mori S. Abeygunawardana C. Johnson M.O. Vanzijl P.C.M. J. Magn.

The chemical shifts are referenced to the 1H2O resonance, set to its expected position of 4.87 ppm at 20 °C (22Cavanagh J. Fairbrother W.J. Palmer A.G. Skelton N.J. Protein NMR Spectroscopy: Principles and Practice. Academic Press, San Diego1996Google Scholar). The NMR data were processed using NMRPipe (23Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11548) Google Scholar), and the spectra were assigned and analyzed using Sparky (24Goddard T.D. Kneller D.G. SPARKY 3. University of California, San Francisco2004Google Scholar). All experiments were performed at millimolar concentrations of collagen or the RKKH to obtain saturation of the α2-I domain, for a single site binding model of interaction and the measured affinity of the peptides for α2-I (see below). Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC)—The α2-I domain, the triple helix collagen peptide, and the cyclized RKKH peptide were all dissolved in buffer B. The pH of each solution was measured to ensure that no changes were produced by the polypeptide components. For the collagen binding experiments the concentration of α2-I domain in the cell was 100 μm and that of the collagen peptide solution 1 mm. For the RKKH binding experiments, the α2-I domain was Cys-alkylated with iodoacetamide, and its concentration in the sample cell was 100 μm. The concentration of cyclized RKKH was 1 mm. ITC experiments were performed with a Microcal VP-ITC calorimeter. Measurements were made by titration of collagen or RKKH peptide into the α2-I domain at a temperature of 10 °C. For titration experiments, the α2-I domain was degassed and placed in the 1.4-ml reaction cell. The collagen or RKKH peptides were loaded in the 250-μl injection syringe, and a series of 8-μl injections over 16 s were made, with a spacing of 500 s between injections over 300 min. The reference power was set to 20 μcal/s, and the stirring speed was 300 rpm. Parallel control experiments, to correct for the heat of mixing, were performed by adding the peptide to a sample cell containing only buffer without α2-I domain. The thermodynamic data were processed with the ORIGIN program (Microcal) to extract the enthalpic, entropic, and equilibrium constants. Nonlinear least squares fitting was done using a single site binding model. Size Exclusion Chromatography—Size exclusion chromatography was performed at 4 or 22 °C, using an Acta Prime flow system with a Superdex 75 10/300 column (GE Healthcare), running in buffer B plus 0.25 mm dithiothreitol. Samples of the α2-I domain (0.3 mm in buffer B) were combined with 0.15 mm of equilibrated collagen peptide at 4 °C in buffer B. Injections of the collagen and α2-I domain alone were done using the same buffer. The flow rate was 0.4 ml/min for the 22 °C experiments and 0.55 ml/min for the 4 °C experiments. The protein-collagen complexes were detected at UV wavelengths of 254 or 215 nm. For size comparison we utilized bovine serum albumin (66.3 kDa) and lysozyme (14.4 kDa). Association of α2-I with Type I Collagen Peptide and RKKH Disintegrin Peptide—In activated platelets α2β1 integrin has a high affinity for soluble collagen with an associated Kd of 35–90 nm (25Jung S.M. Moroi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14827-14837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), whereas the affinity of the α2-I domain for type I collagen measured by surface plasmon resonance is weaker, with a Kd in the low micromolar range (26Calderwood D.A.

Lopez J.A. Blood. 2005; 105: 1986-1991Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Recognition by α2β1 resides totally within the collagen sequence GFOGER, where Glu cannot be replaced by Asp, and sequence recognition is entirely dependent upon the presence of a triple helical conformation (28Knight C.G. Morton L.F. Peachey A.R. Tuckwell D.S. Farndale R.W. Barnes M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). To determine the affinity of α2-I for the triple helical type I collagen peptide, we performed ITC experiments where the 26-residue collagen peptide, containing the GFOGER recognition sequence (Fig. 1B), was titrated into the α2-I domain. This peptide sequence is similar to that which was co-crystallized with α2-I (9Emsley J. Knight C.G. Farndale R.W. Barnes M.J. Liddington R.C. Cell. 2000; 101: 47-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). To maintain the collagen peptide in its active triple helical form, the ITC cell temperature was kept at 10 °C, below the predicted melting temperature of about 20 °C (9Emsley J. Knight C.G. Farndale R.W. Barnes M.J. Liddington R.C. Cell. 2000; 101: 47-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). The results are shown in Fig. 2A, and the free energy parameters are reported in Table 1. Fitting the ITC data to a single-site binding curve (Fig. 2C) yields a Kd of 7.8 μm.TABLE 1Thermodynamic binding constants for the α2-I domain measured by ITCPeptideKdΔGΔHTΔSμmkcal/molkcal/molkcal/mol(GPO)3GFOGER(GPO)3-NH27.8 ± 0.24–6.6–1.1715.44CTRKKHDNAQC-NH28.0 ± 0.33–6.6–0.2546.35 Open table in a new tab ITC was also performed to determine the affinity of α2-I for a cyclic RKKH peptide whose sequence had been previously identified to have the most potent inhibitory effect on α2-I (Fig. 1C) (15Ivaska J.

To enable direct comparison with the affinity determined for collagen, this study was also performed at 10 °C. Fig. 2B shows the titration profile, and the thermodynamic parameters are reported in Table 1. The data fit to a single-site binding model (Fig. 2D) with a Kd of 8.0 μm, consistent with the IC50 of 1.2 μm, estimated in competition assays for the inhibition of collagen binding (15Ivaska J.

Characterization of the α2-I-Collagen Complex—To further characterize the formation of the α2-I-collagen complex, we performed size exclusion chromatography at temperatures below or above the melting transition of the collagen triple helix (Fig. 3, A and B). Isolated α2-I elutes with an apparent molecular mass near 30 kDa at both temperatures (peak a), whereas the collagen peptide elutes near 20 kDa (peak b). We attribute the differences between these observed values and those expected from the calculated molecular weights of the proteins (23 kDa for α2-I; 6.8 kDa for triple helical collagen peptide; 2.3 kDa for monomeric collagen peptide) to the hydrodynamic radii of the molecules, which govern the elution profiles. In particular, the elution of collagen is likely to be dominated by the rod-like shape of the triple helix. However, it is interesting to note that the peptide elutes at a slightly higher apparent molecular weight at 4 than 22 °C, reflecting triple helix formation below the melting temperature. This is further corroborated by the elution profiles of premixed α2-I and collagen. At 22 °C, the elution profile is identical to that of the individual components, with two resolved peaks corresponding to either α2-I (Fig. 3A, peak a) or collagen (Fig. 3A, peak b). However, when the molecules are combined and eluted at 4 °C, a new peak appears at a higher apparent molecular mass of about 45 kDa (Fig. 3B, peak c), indicating complex formation with triple helical collagen. These results are consistent with specific recognition by α2-I of the GFOGER sequence properly displayed in triple helical collagen (28Knight C.G. Morton L.F. Peachey A.R. Tuckwell D.S. Farndale R.W. Barnes M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). The size exclusion results in Fig. 3 further show that the α2-I domain and collagen form a stable long lived complex and help explain the NMR results, where the extreme broadening observed in the presence of collagen reflects the formation of a large slowly tumbling biomolecular species (see below). Effects of Mg2+and Collagen on α2-I—The α2-I domain possesses high affinity for type I collagen in the presence of the divalent metal cation Mg2+. The metal-binding site consists of MIDAS motif residues Asp-151, Ser-153, Ser-155, Thr-221, Asp-254, and Glu-256 which form an octahedral coordination sphere composed of direct and water-bridged interactions. The structural role of Mg2+ has been examined using both x-ray and NMR methods in the CD11a/LFA-1 I domain (29Qu A. Leahy D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10277-10281Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 30Qu A. Leahy D.J.

Springer T.A. Cell. 2003; 112: 99-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar), where Mg2+ was found to play a role in ligand binding, and its removal did not cause large scale structural change in the CD11a/LFA-1 I domain. The crystal structure of α2-I bound to triple helical collagen suggests that collagen binding is accompanied by a large conformational rearrangement of the C-terminal helix, coupled with changes in the coordination the Mg2+ metal (9Emsley J. Knight C.G. Farndale R.W. Barnes M.J. Liddington R.C. Cell. 2000; 101: 47-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). Collagen binding causes three concerted changes in the I domain; the loops of the MIDAS motif are perturbed because of a rearrangement upon insertion of a collagen Glu side chain into the metal coordination sphere; helices h6 and h7 rearrange to open up the top surface; and helix h7 moves downward to the opposite pole of the MIDAS motif. The rearrangement of helix h7 is thought to produce the large scale conformational changes experienced by the integrin heterodimer during signaling. To see if the protein dynamics and conformation associated with Mg2+ and collagen binding could be characterized in solution, we examined the 1H/15N HSQC NMR spectrum of α2-I in the presence or absence of metal and collagen. The 1H and 15N chemical shifts from protein backbone amide groups are very sensitive to changes in protein conformation or chemical environment and can be used to monitor the equilibrium exchange between states arising from free and ligand-bound protein (22Cavanagh J. Fairbrother W.J. Palmer A.G. Skelton N.J. Protein NMR Spectroscopy: Principles and Practice. Academic Press, San Diego1996Google Scholar). If the exchange rate is faster than the difference between the chemical shifts measured for the two states, then the system is in fast exchange, and one peak is observed at the population-weighted average chemical shift of the two states. NMR can be used to detect weak binding or minor conformational rearrangements, and chemical shift changes as small as 0.02 ppm have been reported for minor local effects on protein structure resulting from binding of small molecules or modifications, whereas much larger changes (>1 ppm) can reflect major conformational rearrangements (33Rajagopal P.

A sample of metal-free α2-I domain (isotopically enriched with 15N) was prepared by exhaustive dialysis against EDTA. The 1H-15N HSQC spectra of the metal-free and Mg2+-bound forms of the α2-I domain are shown in Fig. 4A. Several peaks undergo measurable frequency changes reflecting metal binding. A plot of the total change in 1H and 15N chemical shifts against amino acid number shows that the peaks with the largest frequency changes are localized to residues involved in direct coordination of Mg2+ in the MIDAS motif (Fig. 5).FIGURE 5Total change in α2-I domain backbone amide chemical shifts induced by the addition of Mg2+ from 0 to 1.7 mm (96% saturation). The total combined change in chemical shift (Δ) for each residue was calculated by adding the changes in 1H(ΔH) and 15N(ΔN) chemical shifts, according to the equation Δ= ((ΔH)2 + (ΔN/5)2)1/2, where the 15N chemical shift is scaled by 1/5 to account for the 5-fold difference between the chemical shift dispersions of 15N and 1H (35Grzesiek S.

Residue numbers are indicated for peaks with Δ ≥0.1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) This is further highlighted by mapping the frequency changes on the previously determined crystal structure of the α2-I domain (Fig. 6C). However, most of the peaks from other residues throughout the protein structure do not change, indicating that Mg2+ binding does not induce a large scale conformational change of the α2-I domain in solution. This is similar to the results reported for LFA-1 (31Legge G.B. Kriwacki R.W. Chung J. Hommel U. Ramage P. Case D.A. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. J. Mol.

A potential indicator of close association between the metal-binding site and conformational change in helix h7 is the chemical shift change observed for Glu-318 in the spectra from metal-bound and unbound α2-I. Glu-318 is located in the loop preceding the C-terminal helix and is characterized by a distinctive downfield chemical shift (1H ∼ 11.5 ppm). In the comparison of the structures of the collagen-bound and unbound forms of the α2-I domain, it was noted that Glu-318 in the unbound form of α2-I domain is engaged in a salt bridge interaction with Arg-288, which is not present in the collagen-bound form (9Emsley J.

Angiotensin II, through the activation of AT1 receptors, promotes the recruitment to the plasma membrane of Na,K-ATPase molecules from intracellular compartments. We present evidence to demonstrate that a tyrosine-based sequence (IVVY-255) present within the Na,K-ATPase α1-subunit is involved in the binding of adaptor protein 1. Mutation of Tyr-255 to a phenylalanine residue in the Na,K-ATPase α1-subunit greatly reduces the angiotensin II-dependent activation of Na,K-ATPase, recruitment of Na,K-ATPase molecules to the plasma membrane, and association of adaptor protein 1 with Na,K-ATPase α1-subunit molecules. To determine protein-protein interaction, we used fluorescence resonance energy transfer between fluorophores attached to the Na,K-ATPase α1-subunit and adaptor protein 1. Although angiotensin II activation of AT1 receptors induces a significant increase in the level of fluorescence resonance energy transfer between the two molecules, this effect was blunted in cells expressing the Tyr-255 mutant. Thus, results from different methods and techniques suggest that the Tyr-255-based sequence within the NKA α1-subunit is the site of adaptor protein 1 binding in response to the G-protein-coupled receptor signals produced by angiotensin II binding to AT1 receptors.

Protein kinase Cβ-dependent phosphorylation of the NKA α1-subunit constitutes the triggering signal for NKA plasma membrane recruitment. Phosphorylation of Ser-11 and Ser-18 in NKA α1 may induce a conformational change in the protein to facilitate the binding of adaptor protein 1 (AP-1). Although we are beginning to better understand the organization of signals initiated by stimulation of AT1Rs and the traffic of NKA molecules from intracellular compartments to the plasma membrane, the mechanism involved in cargo selection remains unclear.

Cells were transferred to serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and either 3 μm or 5 mm ouabain (incubation medium). All treatments and determinations were performed at 23 °C. Then, a trace amount of [86Rb]RbCl was added to the cell medium. After 20 min, cells were washed three times with ice-cold saline and dissolved with SDS, and accumulated radioactivity was determined. NKA-mediated Rb+ uptake was calculated from the difference in tracer uptake between samples incubated in 3 μm or 5 mm ouabain. The ouabain-insensitive Rb+ uptake (measured in the presence of 5 mm ouabain) was 25-30% of the total Rb+ uptake measured. In some experiments, cells were treated with hormones before the Rb+ uptake determination. The concentrations used and the time of treatment are described in the respective figures. Determination of Plasma Membrane Pool of NKA by Biotinylation—For biotinylation experiments, the cells were treated with 1 μm PMA or 1 pm Ang II for 10 min at room temperature, and then the medium was changed to ice-cold 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm CaCl2, 150 mm NaCl, and 1.5 mg/ml N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide-biotin. After incubation for 1 h at 4°C, the cells were scraped in immunoprecipitation (IP) buffer (20 mm Tris, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, and 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, pH 7.3) containing a protease inhibitor mixture, frozen in liquid nitrogen, thawed rapidly, probe-sonicated twice in an ice-water bath, and frozen/thawed again. The cell suspension was centrifuged at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 5 min. The supernatant was separated, and protein concentration was determined. Aliquots containing equal amounts of protein were transferred to clean tubes, and 0.2% Triton X-100 and 0.2% SDS were added. The suspension was incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with anti-α1 antibody and for 2 h with protein A/G-agarose, which had been prewashed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and once with IP buffer containing 0.2% Triton X-100. After separation, the agarose beads were washed four times with IP buffer containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and 0.2% SDS and once with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and finally resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer. Electrophoresis, Western blot analysis with ExtrAvidin peroxidase conjugate, and densitometric analysis were performed as described previously (16Efendiev R. Budu C.E. Cinelli A.R. Bertorello A.M.

Determination of AP-1 Coprecipitation with NKA α1—OK cells stably expressing either the WT or Y255F mutant form of NKA α1 were treated with 1 pm Ang II (or vehicle) for 10 min at room temperature. The cells were then scraped in ice-cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer followed by the ExactaCruz IP protocol (performed as described by the manufacturer). Cell lysates (containing an equal amount of protein for each treatment) were precleared with Preclearing Matrix E (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 30 min at 4 ° C. Preimmune normal mouse serum and control antibody anti-actin C-2 IgG1 (both reagents are from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; catalog nos. sc-45051 and sc-8432, respectively) and NKA α1 IgG1 antibody were incubated with the ExactaCruz IP matrix to form IP complexes. These were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated with cell lysates for 1 h at 4 °C. The IP matrixes were pelleted, washed three times with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, and finally resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer. After separation by SDS-PAGE, the proteins were transferred to a piece of polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, which was assayed by Western blot analysis with an AP-1 antibody. The protein bands were analyzed by densitometry. The polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was stripped and tested with an anti-NKA α1 antibody to determine precipitated NKA as a control of PAGE loading. The ratio of integral densities of protein bands identified by AP-1 and NKA α1 antibodies in the same membrane was calculated for each sample. Then, the membrane was stripped again and tested with an anti-phosphoserine antibody to determine the level of NKA α1 phosphorylation. Preparation of Cells for Microscopic Studies—Cells attached to glass coverslips and grown to 90% confluence were incubated for 10 min at room temperature with 1 pm Ang II in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. The cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1.2% sucrose (PBSS), fixed with freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde in PBSS for 10 min, washed twice with PBSS, incubated with l-lysine/sodium m-periodate for 20 min, washed with PBSS, permeabilized with 0.2% bovine serum albumin and 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBSS for 10 min, and washed again twice with PBSS. The cells were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin, 1% normal goat serum, and 0.2% Tween 20 for 1 h. Cells were incubated with mouse anti-AP-1 and rabbit anti-NKA α1 antibodies and washed with PBSS. In the dark, cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-tagged anti-mouse and Cy3-tagged anti-rabbit antibodies for 1 h. Then, the coverslips were washed, air-dried, and mounted on glass slides using Gel-Mount containing anti-fading agents (Biomeda, Foster City, CA). Optical Setup of Fluorescence Microscopy—To obtain high resolution three-dimensional images of the cells, the fluorescence imaging work station consisted of an Olympus IX-81 inverted fluorescence microscope (Olympus Corp., Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a 60X/100X oil immersion objective lens, cooled Hamamatsu ORCA-ER CCD camera (Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu-city, Japan), a halogen 100-watt light source, a motorized filter and shutter, and a scan wizard for collection of x/y and z image sequences and wavelength positions over time, all controlled by SimplePCI software (Compix, Cranberry Township, PA). To obtain deconvolved images of cells, at least seven z-stacks of the field with a step of 0.5-1.0 μm were acquired, and deconvolution was performed using Auto-Deblur software (AutoQuant Imaging, Troy, NY). For all intensity measurements, the Dynamic Intensity Analysis module of SimplePCI was used. Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer—For FRET determinations, images were acquired sequentially through three channels using the following filter sets (Chroma Corp., Rockingham, VT): Alexa Fluor 488 (excitation, 470/40 nm; emission, 500/40 nm), Cy3 (excitation, 540/25 nm; emission, 605/55 nm), and Alexa Fluor 488/Cy3 (excitation, 470/40 nm; emission, 605/55 nm). Corrected FRET (FRETC) was calculated on a pixel-by-pixel basis for the entire image using the equation FRETC = FRET - (0.45 × Alexa Fluor 488) - (0.20 × Cy3) (25Gordon G.W. Berry G. Liang X.H. Levine B. Herman B. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 2702-2713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar), where FRET, Alexa Fluor 488, and Cy3 correspond to background-subtracted images of cells stained with Alexa Fluor 488 and Cy3 acquired through the FRET, Alexa Fluor 488, and Cy3 channels, respectively. Values of 0.45 and 0.20 are the fractions that were calculated for the bleed-through of Alexa Fluor 488 and Cy3 fluorescence, respectively, through the FRET filter channel. Calibrations of bleed-through were performed in cells treated with only one primary/secondary set of the antibodies, either anti-AP-1/Alexa Fluor 488 or anti-NKA α1/Cy3. In the cells, treated simultaneously with both sets of antibodies, normalized FRET (FRETN) values were calculated according to the equation FRETN = FRETC/(Alexa Fluor 488 × Cy3)1/2, where FRETC, Alexa Fluor 488, and Cy3 are the mean intensities of FRETC, Alexa Fluor 488, and Cy3 fluorescence, respectively (26Xia Z. Liu Y. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 2395-2402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Pseudocolor FRETN images were obtained using the ISee imaging program from Digital Analysis Technology (Raleigh, NC). Pseudocolor FRETN images are displayed with deep blue (cold) indicating low values and bright red (hot) indicating high values. Statistical Procedures—Each experiment was repeated at least three times. Comparison between the two experimental groups was determined with the non-paired Student's t test. p < 0.05 was indicated with an asterisk in the figures. For the microscopic images, at least six randomly chosen sets of cells were used in each experimental condition. The figures show representative images for each experiment. Adaptor proteins such as AP-1 interact with target proteins through binding to defined protein sequences carrying the NPXY motifs, where N, P, and Y are asparagine, proline, and tyrosine, and X can be any amino acid, or the more broadly used Ypp motifs, where Y is tyrosine, p residues are highly variable but tend to be hydrophilic, and is a residue with a bulky hydrophobic chain (27Bonifacino J.S. Dell'Angelica E.C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 923-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). The sequence of residues may be in the reverse order. Analysis of the primary sequence of the NKA subunits revealed the presence of five of these consensus sequences within the cytosolic loops of α1 at Tyr-50, Tyr-255, Tyr-469, Tyr-537, and Tyr-679. The small cytosolic loop of the β-subunit has none of the consensus sequences. One by one, the tyrosine residues in the α1 consensus sequences were mutated to phenylalanine. The mutation introduced the minimum possible change by eliminating the tyrosine hydroxyl group and keeping the aromatic characteristic of the residue side chain. Plasmids containing the rat wild-type NKA α1 (WT α1) and its mutated forms were stably expressed in OK cells, a cell culture line that is widely used as a model of renal proximal tubule epithelia (28Guimaraes J. Vieira-Coelho M. Serrao M. Soares-da-Silva P. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 681-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 29Malstrom K. Stange G. Murer H. Biochim. Biophys.

Cells expressing the WT and mutant forms of NKA α1 were selected and maintained all the time in the presence of 3 μm ouabain medium to prevent the expression of the endogenous α1-subunit (19Pedemonte C.H. Pressley T.A. Lokhandwala M.F. Cinelli A.R. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 155: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 31Lane L.K. Feldmann J.M. Flarsheim C.E. Rybczynski C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17930-17934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transport activity mediated by the NKA was determined in these cells. The basal ouabain-sensitive Rb+ uptake in WT α1 cells was 9.0 ± 0.7 nmol/min/mg protein, and similar values were determined in cells expressing the different NKA α1 mutants, which indicates that the NKA was expressed at the same level in the different cell lines. Ang II-dependent stimulation of AT1Rs (16Efendiev R. Budu C.E. Cinelli A.R. Bertorello A.M. Pedemonte C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28719-28726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) increased the ouabain-sensitive Rb+ uptake to 12.4 ± 0.5 nmol/min/mg protein (a 38% increase) in cells expressing the wild-type NKA α1 (Fig. 1). Whereas similar transport levels were observed in most of the NKA α1 mutants, the hormonal stimulation was significantly reduced in cells expressing the NKA α1 Y255F mutant (Fig. 1A). We have previously demonstrated that 8-OH-DPAT, a serotonin 1A receptor agonist, and the phorbol ester PMA, an activator of protein kinase C, stimulate the same signaling pathway as Ang II to induce the plasma membrane recruitment of NKA molecules (32Budu C.E. Efendiev R. Bertorello A.M. Pedemonte C.H. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 137: 1380-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Consistent with this observation, the substitution of Tyr-255 for phenylalanine in NKA α1 impairs the stimulation of NKA activity by either 8-OH-DPAT or PMA (Fig. 1B). To determine the effect of the α1 Y255F mutation on the Ang II-induced plasma membrane recruitment of NKA molecules, we measured the plasma membrane abundance of NKA molecules in cells that have been treated or not treated with Ang II. For this, we used the technique of plasma membrane protein biotinylation, which has been validated in several of our previous publications (16Efendiev R. Budu C.E. Cinelli A.R. Bertorello A.M. Pedemonte C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28719-28726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 21Efendiev R. Bertorello A.M. Pressley T.A. Rousselot M. Feraille E. Pedemonte C.H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9884-9892Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 24Efendiev R. Yudowski G.A. Zwiller J. Leibiger B. Katz A.I. Berggren P.O. Pedemonte C.H. Leibiger I.B. Bertorello A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44108-44114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). After treatment of the cells with either PMA or Ang II, the cells were rapidly transferred to a 4 °C bath, the temperature at which the plasma membrane proteins were labeled with N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide-biotin. The low temperature stops the hormonal reaction and prevents the intracellular trafficking of NKA molecules. Changes in NKA activity in response to AT1Rs activation are paralleled by increases in abundance of newly recruited NKA units at the plasma membrane (Fig. 1C). On the contrary, in cells expressing the α1 Y255F mutant, stimulation of AT1Rs failed to increase NKA abundance at the plasma membrane. Basal amounts of NKA molecules at the plasma membrane (controls, Fig. 1C) determined in cells expressing the NKA WT α1 and the α1 Y255F mutant were not significantly different, indicating that NKA was expressed at the same level in both cell lines. We further evaluated whether the IVVY-255 sequence represents the AP-1 binding site by looking at its interaction with NKA using co-IP and FRET techniques. As determined by co-IP assays, stimulation of AT1Rs increases the association of NKA and AP-1 molecules in cells expressing the wild-type α1, whereas this effect was greatly reduced in cells expressing the α1 Y255F mutant (Fig. 1D). Besides being used for IP, aliquots from the cell lysates were separated by PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting with an anti-NKA α1 antibody (data not shown). The same amount of NKA α1 was determined in the cell lysates corresponding to both cell types and all treatment conditions. Thus, the differences presented in the figure are not due to different amounts of NKA available for IP. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 1D, similar amounts of NKA α1 were immunoprecipitated from cells expressing WT α1 and the Y255F mutant. In cells expressing the NKA α1 Y255F mutant, the antibody recognition for AP-1 is not significantly different from the background level observed for the IP controls performed with preimmune serum or anti-actin control antibody (the same IgG type as the anti-NKA α1 antibody). Results presented in Fig. 1D suggest that treatment of the cells with Ang II specifically increases the association of AP-1 with NKA molecules and that this association is prevented in cells expressing the NKA α1 Y255F mutant. These results are consistent with those presented in Figs. 1 and 2. We have previously demonstrated that stimulation of AT1Rs induces the phosphorylation of Ser-11 and Ser-18 of NKA α1 and that mutation of these amino acids prevents the Ang II-dependent regulation of NKA activity (16Efendiev R. Budu C.E. Cinelli A.R. Bertorello A.M. Pedemonte C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28719-28726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 17Pedemonte C.H. Efendiev R. Bertorello A.M. Semin. Nephrol. 2005; 25: 322-327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, Fig. 1E shows that the Ang II-dependent increased coprecipitation of NKA and AP-1 is accompanied by an increased phosphorylation of NKA α1. The absence of difference in phosphorylation level between cells expressing WT and mutant Y255F α1 shows that the process of AP-1-mediated recruitment of NKA α1 lies downstream of its phosphorylation. Further support for the interaction between NKA and AP-1 molecules was obtained using FRET between fluorophores attached to the two proteins. Because it can only occur at a very close distance, FRET is the best technique to measure protein-protein interaction. We have previously optimized the use of this technique (33Efendiev R. Cinelli A.R. Leibiger I.B. Bertorello A.M. Pedemonte C.H. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 5067-5070Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). After treatment with Ang II and/or other reagents, the cells were exposed to polyclonal rabbit and monoclonal mouse antibodies against NKA α1 and AP-1, respectively. Subsequently, the cells were treated with Cy3-tagged anti-rabbit and Alexa Fluor 488-tagged anti-mouse secondary antibodies. Cy3 and Alexa Fluor 488 are an excellent donor-acceptor pair for FRET determinations (34Achnine L. Blancaflor E.B. Rasmussen S. Dixon R.A. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 3098-3109Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 35Gidwani A. Brown H.A. Holowka D. Baird B. J.

Results depicted in Fig. 2A, vertical panels, demonstrate bright-field images (first panel), as well as images of the cells obtained in the Cy3 channel (second panel), Alexa Fluor 488 channel (third panel), and FRET channel (fourth panel). For determinations of normalized FRET, images of cells labeled with only one of the fluorophores were also acquired (data not shown). FRETN, which is independent of the fluorophore concentrations (37Xia Z. Zhou Q. Lin J. Liu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1766-1771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), was determined through pixel-by-pixel intensity recalculation, and it is presented in Fig. 2 as pseudocolor images. In non-treated cells, NKA α1 is mostly localized in the plasma membrane region, and AP-1 is in cytosolic regions surrounding the nucleus. We have previously demonstrated that the intracellular compartments containing NKA molecules are close to the plasma membrane and that it is difficult to distinguish between NKA molecules that are at the plasma membrane and in intracellular compartments (38Efendiev R. Das-Panja K. Cinelli A.R. Bertorello A.M. Pedemonte C.H. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2007; 151: 1006-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In cells treated with Ang II, it can be observed that AP-1 molecules have been recruited to the plasma membrane region where the NKA-containing intracellular compartments are located, and consequently the level of FRETN between the fluorophores attached to NKA and AP-1 has been significantly increased (arrows on Fig. 2A). In cells in which the Ang II-dependent phosphorylation of NKA α1 has been impaired by pretreatment with the protein kinase C inhibitor chelerythrine chloride, the increased level of FRETN was greatly reduced. As a control, some of the cells were treated with the D1R agonist fenoldopam, which, contrary to Ang II, induces the endocytosis of NKA molecules (39Hussain T. Lokhandwala M.F. Clin. Exp. Hypertens. 1997; 19: 131-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 40Hussain T. Lokhandwala M.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: F339-F346PubMed Google Scholar), and no increased level of FRETN was observed (Fig. 2B). Determinations of FRETN were also performed in cells expressing the Y255F and Y537F mutants of α1. Ang II stimulation of AT1Rs induced an increased level of FRETN between the fluorophores attached to NKA α1 and AP-1 in cells expressing the Y537F mutant, but not in cells expressing the Y255F mutant (Fig. 2B). Interaction of a clathrin-dependent translocated protein with AP-1 is a key event in the recruitment of target proteins to the plasma membrane (41Ohno H. Stewart J. Fournier M.-C. Bosshart H. Rhee I. Miyatake S. Saito T. Gallusser A. Kirchhausen T. Bonifacino J.S. Science. 1995; 269: 1872-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). In this report, we present evidence that the sequence IVVY-255 within the NKA α1 is the site of binding of AP-1 in response to AT1R stimulation. In support of this conclusion, we present results obtained by different and independent methods and techniques. The reduced Ang II-dependent stimulation of NKA activity was not due to a reduced expression of the α1 Y255F mutant. That the level of expression of NKA α1 is the same in cells expressing the wild-type α1 and the α1 Y255F mutant is illustrated by the display, under basal conditions, of the same level of NKA activity, NKA molecule abundance at the plasma membrane, and fluorescence. Besides binding to Tyr-based sequences, AP-1 may also interact with dileucine motifs with the sequence z2-4xLL, where z is a negatively charged residue and x a polar residue (42Kirchhausen T. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 705-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). The NKA α1 cytosolic loops have two of these consensus sequences, EPKHLL-499 and LLLPDE-559. We have previously demonstrated that PMA, which activates the NKA activity through the same signaling pathway as Ang II (16Efendiev R. Budu C.E. Cinelli A.R. Bertorello A.M. Pedemonte C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28719-28726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), stimulates the NKA containing the WT α 1 at the same level as NKA molecules containing the mutants L499A and L554A (20Done S.C. Leibiger I.B. Efendiev R. Katz A.I. Leibiger B. Berggren P.O. Pedemonte C.H. Bertorello A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17108-17111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Therefore, so far, the NKA α1 IVVY-255 sequence is the only site of AP-1 binding that is relevant to the Ang II-dependent regulation of NKA activity. Cells expressing the WT and mutant forms of NKA α1 were selected and maintained all the time in 3 μm ouabain medium, which prevents the expression of the endogenous α1-subunit (19Pedemonte C.H. Pressley T.A. Lokhandwala M.F. Cinelli A.R. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 155: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 31Lane L.K. Feldmann J.M. Flarsheim C.E. Rybczynski C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17930-17934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, endogenous non-mutated α1 should not have interfered with determinations performed in cells expressing the various mutants of α1. We have previously demonstrated that, as part of the mechanism of endocytosis of NKA molecules induced by stimulation of D1Rs, AP-2 interacts with the 537-YLEL sequence within NKA α1 (20Done S.C. Leibiger I.B. Efendiev R. Katz A.I. Leibiger B. Berggren P.O. Pedemonte C.H. Bertorello A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17108-17111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We determined that the mutation Y537F has no effect on Ang II-dependent stimulation of NKA activity and in the NKA α1/AP-1 interaction (as determined by FRET). Furthermore, contrary to the effect of Ang II, stimulation of D1Rs (which produced inhibition of NKA activity) did not increase the interaction of NKA α1 with AP-1. These results, as well as the observation that preventing the Ang II-induced phosphorylation of NKA α1 impairs the NKA α1/AP-1 interaction, support the conclusion that the NKA α1/AP-1 interaction is a very specific response to the activation of AT1Rs. Ang II-dependent plasma membrane recruitment of NKA molecules requires the protein kinase Cβ-mediated phosphorylation of NKA α1 (16Efendiev R. Budu C.E. Cinelli A.R. Bertorello A.M. Pedemonte C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28719-28726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The fact that the Ang II-dependent increment of FRETN was impaired when the cells were treated with the protein kinase C inhibitor chelerythrine chloride is evidence of the causal link between the specific phosphorylation of α1 and the NKA/AP-1 interaction. The results of these experiments strongly suggest that the Ang II-dependent increment on FRETN is not due to some unknown artifact, such as membrane ruffling or constitutive protein delivery to the plasma membrane. It should be noted that the effect of Ang II is an acute effect produced in a few minutes. Thus, the effects observed are not due to the delivery of newly synthesized proteins to the plasma membrane. AP-1, through its μ-subunit, interacts with the cargo Tyr-based sequences (43Folsch H. Ohno H. Bonifacino J.S. Mellman I. Cell. 1999; 99: 189-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 44Ohno H. Tomemori T. Nakatsu F. Okazaki Y. Aguilar R.C. Foelsch H. Mellman I. Saito T. Shirasawa T. Bonifacino J.S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 449: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Although AP-1 containing the μA isoform has been implicated in the bidirectional traffic between the trans-Golgi network and endosomes, AP-1 containing the μB isoform seems to be selectively expressed in polarized epithelial cells and to be responsible for delivery of proteins to the basolateral membrane domain (43Folsch H. Ohno H. Bonifacino J.S. Mellman I. Cell. 1999; 99: 189-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 44Ohno H. Tomemori T. Nakatsu F. Okazaki Y. Aguilar R.C. Foelsch H. Mellman I. Saito T. Shirasawa T. Bonifacino J.S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 449: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Although we have not studied it, it is likely that the μB isoform is expressed in OK, which is derived from opossum kidney proximal tubule epithelial cells. Because the regulation of NKA by Ang II occurs in a short term fashion and does not require protein synthesis (and thereby no traffic through the trans-Golgi network), it seems likely that AP-1 containing the μB isoform would be responsible for the results described in this report. Clathrin vesicle-dependent traffic of membrane proteins requires the specific interaction of the protein cargo with clathrin adaptors (42Kirchhausen T. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 705-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Such adaptors are organ-specific and have a particular distribution within the cell cytoplasm. Whereas, induced by D1Rs activation, AP-2 binds to the NKA α1 Tyr-537-based sequence during plasma membrane endocytosis (20Done S.C. Leibiger I.B. Efendiev R. Katz A.I. Leibiger B. Berggren P.O.

These observations unequivocally demonstrate the existence of two specific clathrin adaptor-binding sequences that provide selectivity regarding whether the NKA molecules would traffic from or to the plasma membrane in response to G-protein-coupled receptor signals.

https://openalex.org/W2114855142,"The evolutionary forces shaping the ability to win competitive interactions, such as aggressive encounters, are still poorly understood. Given a fitness advantage for competitive success, variance in aggressive and sexual display traits should be depleted, but a great deal of variation in these traits is consistently found. While life history tradeoffs have been commonly cited as a mechanism for the maintenance of variation, the variability of competing strategies of conspecifics may mean there is no single optimum strategy. We measured the genetically determined outcomes of aggressive interactions, and the resulting effects on mating success, in a panel of diverse inbred lines representing both natural variation and artificially selected genotypes. Males of one genotype which consistently lost territorial encounters with other genotypes were nonetheless successful against males that were artificially selected for supernormal aggression and dominated all other lines. Intransitive patterns of territorial success could maintain variation in aggressive strategies if there is a preference for territorial males. Territorial success was not always associated with male mating success however and females preferred ‘winners’ among some male genotypes, and ‘losers’ among other male genotypes. This suggests that studying behaviour from the perspective of population means may provide limited evolutionary and genetic insight. Overall patterns of competitive success among males and mating transactions between the sexes are consistent with mechanisms proposed for the maintenance of genetic variation due to nonlinear outcomes of competitive interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2058941852,"Ligand binding to enzymes and antibodies is often accompanied by protein conformational changes. Although such structural adjustments may be conducive to enzyme catalysis, much less is known about their effect on reactions promoted by engineered catalytic antibodies. Crystallographic and pre-steady state kinetic analyses of antibody 34E4, which efficiently promotes the conversion of benzisoxazoles to salicylonitriles, show that the resting catalyst adopts two interconverting active-site conformations, only one of which is competent to bind substrate. In the predominant isomer, the indole side chain of TrpL91 occupies the binding site and blocks ligand access. Slow conformational isomerization of this residue, on the same time scale as catalytic turnover, creates a deep and narrow binding site that can accommodate substrate and promote proton transfer using GluH50 as a carboxylate base. Although 34E4 is among the best catalysts for the deprotonation of benzisoxazoles, its efficiency appears to be significantly limited by this conformational plasticity of its active site. Future efforts to improve this antibody might profitably focus on stabilizing the active conformation of the catalyst. Analogous strategies may also be relevant to other engineered proteins that are limited by an unfavorable conformational pre-equilibrium.

Future efforts to improve this antibody might profitably focus on stabilizing the active conformation of the catalyst. Analogous strategies may also be relevant to other engineered proteins that are limited by an unfavorable conformational pre-equilibrium. Tailored antibody catalysts have been generated for a wide variety of reactions using transition state analogs or other appropriately designed template molecules as antigens (1Schultz P.G. Lerner R.A. Science. 1995; 269: 1835-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Although these proteins exhibit many of the properties of authentic enzymes, including rate accelerations, substrate specificity, regioselectivity, and stereoselectivity, their efficiency generally lags behind that of their natural counterparts. Among the many factors that contribute to antibody inefficiency (2Hilvert D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 751-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), suboptimal conformational properties of the immunoglobulin scaffold have been cited as a potentially significant limitation (3Padlan E.A. Mol. Immunol. 1994; 31: 169-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar, 4Stewart J.D. Benkovic S.J. Nature. 1995; 375: 388-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Proteins are innately flexible, undergoing conformational changes over a wide range of time scales and amplitudes. Such flexibility is believed to be important for enzyme function (5Karplus M. Adv. Biophys. 1984; 18: 165-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 6Hammes G.G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8221-8228Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 7Boehr D.D. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E.

Dynamic structural fluctuations can influence substrate and product binding. They also enable the catalyst to adjust to changes in the substrate as the reaction coordinate is traversed, and they provide a means to position functional groups for efficient electrostatic, nucleophilic, and acid-base catalysis. Conformational changes may even shape the effective barrier of the catalyzed reaction in some cases (9Olsson M.H.M. Parson W.W. Warshel A. Chem. Rev. 2006; 106: 1737-1756Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Antibodies undergo a similar range of conformational changes as enzymes. Switches between different rotamers of individual side chains, segmental movements of hypervariable loops, and alterations in the relative disposition of the VH and VL domains have all been observed (3Padlan E.A. Mol. Immunol. 1994; 31: 169-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar, 10Wilson I.A. Stanfield R.L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 857-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 11Sundberg E.J. Mariuzza R.A. Adv. Protein Chem. 2002; 61: 119-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). These structural adjustments increase the effective diversity of the primary immunological repertoire and are important for achieving high affinity and selective molecular recognition (12Foote J. Milstein C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10370-10374Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). However, such conformational changes are difficult to exploit intentionally for antibody catalysis, given the indirect nature of the immunological selection process, which optimizes binding to an imperfect transition state mimic rather than catalytic activity. In fact, affinity maturation reduces conformational flexibility in some antibodies and also increases specificity (13Wedemayer G.J. Patten P.A. Wang L.H. Schultz P.G. Stevens R.C. Science. 1997; 276: 1665-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 14Wedemayer G.J. Wang L.H. Patten P.A. Schultz P.G. Stevens R.C. J. Mol.

A. 2006; 103: 13722-13727Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Comparisons of germ line and mature antibodies catalyzing an oxy-Cope rearrangement indicate that such rigidification can be deleterious to catalytic efficiency (17Ulrich H.D. Mundorff E. Santarsiero B.D. Driggers E.M. Stevens R.C. Schultz P.G. Nature. 1997; 389: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, investigations of a family of esterolytic antibodies (18Lindner A.B. Eshhar Z. Tawfik D.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 421-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) provide evidence that conformational changes can be beneficial in some instances and contribute to higher rate accelerations. In other cases, structural dynamics may influence substrate binding or product release. For example, crystallographic snapshots of the complete reaction cycle of antibody cocaine degradation visualized significant conformational changes in the active site along the reaction coordinate (19Zhu X.

Although substrate and products were bound in partially open conformations, the antibody active site engulfed the transition state analog more tightly, thus enabling transition state stabilization through hydrogen bonding (19Zhu X.

In this study, crystallographic and kinetic approaches were employed to characterize structural changes in a catalytic antibody promoting the conversion of benzisoxazoles to salicylonitriles (Fig. 1, 1 → 3). This reaction, known as the Kemp elimination, is a valuable model system for studying proton transfer from carbon (20Casey M.L. Kemp D.S. Paul K.G. Cox D.D. J. Org. Chem. 1973; 38: 2294-2301Crossref Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 21Kemp D.S. Casey M.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1973; 95: 6670-6680Crossref Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 22Kemp D.S. Cox D.D. Paul K.G. J. Am.

Antibody 34E4 was generated against the cationic 2-aminobenzimidazolium hapten 4 and catalyzes this transformation with high rates (kcat = 0.7 s-1, kcat/Km = 6 × 103 m-1 s-1) and multiple turnovers (>103) (23Thorn S.N. Daniels R.G. Auditor M.T. Hilvert D. Nature. 1995; 373: 228-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Combined modeling (24Hu Y. Houk K.N. Kikuchi K. Hotta K. Hilvert D. J. Am. Chem.

A. 2005; 102: 4984-4989Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) work implicate the carboxylate group of the heavy-chain glutamate 50 (GluH50, Kabat numbering) as the catalytic base. These studies further suggest that high catalytic efficiency in this system derives, at least in part, from successful exploitation of extensive hydrogen bonding, π-stacking, and van der Waals interactions to align base and substrate. The possibility that conformational changes might be important in 34E4 is suggested by sequence comparisons with the recently characterized, noncatalytic antibody SPE7 (27James L.C. Roversi P. Tawfik D.S. Science. 2003; 299: 1362-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar, 28James L.C. Tawfik D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 12730-12735Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This antibody was raised against a 2,4-dinitrophenyl hapten, but is a highly dynamic receptor, which binds multiple ligands via different active-site conformations (27James L.C. Roversi P. Tawfik D.S. Science. 2003; 299: 1362-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). The variable λ light chains of 34E4 and SPE7 are 93% identical, and the backbone atoms in their respective framework regions have a root mean square deviation of only 0.4 Å. Although their variable heavy chain domains do not appear to be closely related (52% identity, 1.1 Å root mean square deviation), key residues lining the binding pocket are also conserved. Indeed, consistent with these similarities, we find that 34E4 is subject to conformational changes that adversely affect catalytic efficiency. Specifically, the apo antibody exists predominantly in an unreactive form that must undergo slow and significant structural rearrangement to accommodate its substrate. Comparisons with other structurally characterized catalytic antibodies suggest that this behavior may be quite general. By stabilizing the active form of the catalyst, it may be possible to enhance efficacy in these systems significantly. 34E4 Fab Preparation, Crystallization, and Data Collection—The apo 34E4 Fab 4The abbreviations used are: Fab, fragment antigen binding; CDR, complementarity determining region; Bistris propane, 1,3-bis[tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamino]propane. was produced and purified as a murine-human chimera, as described previously (25Seebeck F.P. Hilvert D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 1307-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The Fab, concentrated to 15 mg/ml, was crystallized by the sitting drop vapor diffusion method at 22.5 °C. The Fab crystallized from 30% MPEG 2000, 0.1 m sodium acetate (pH 4.3), 0.2 m (NH4)2SO4 in orthorhombic space group P212121 (crystal form A) and from 32% PEG 2000, 0.2 m CdCl2, 0.1 m Bistris propane (pH 7.0), in triclinic space group P1 (crystal form B). For data collection, the crystals were flash-cooled to 100 K using 25% glycerol as cryoprotectant. Data were collected at ALS Berkeley and SSRL Stanford. Data processing and scaling were performed in HKL2000 (29Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38570) Google Scholar).

The structures were refined by alternating cycles of model building with the program O (31Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

During refinement, tight noncrystallographic symmetry restraints were applied to all main-chain atoms of the Fab molecules in the asymmetric unit, except for some loop regions. The final refinement statistics are shown in Table 1. The quality of the structures was constantly monitored using the programs Mol-Probity (33Lovell S.C. Davis I.W. Arendall III, W.B. de Bakker P.I.

Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Fluorescence Titration—Thermodynamic dissociation constants (Kd) for the ligand·Fab complex were determined as described previously (36Taira K. Benkovic S.J. J. Med. Chem. 1988; 31: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). A titration curve was generated by stepwise addition of ligand (0–3 μm) to a dilute solution of the chimeric Fab fragment (50 nm) and subsequent measurement of the fluorescence. The excitation and emission wavelengths were 290 and 340 nm, respectively, and the corresponding band pass was either 8 or 16 nm. The high voltage of the detector was set to 800–900 V. These measurements were carried out in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0) and 100 mm NaCl at 20.0 ± 0.1 °C on an Aminco-Bowman Series 2 luminescence spectrometer (SLM Aminco, Urbana, IL). From the measurements of the observed antibody fluorescence (F) at various concentrations of the ligand (LT), the dissociation constant (Kd) was calculated by nonlinear least squares fitting of the data to Equation 1, F=FE−[(ET+LT+Kd)−(ET+LT+Kd) 2−4ETLT]×FE−FEL2ET(Eq. 1) where ET is the total Fab concentration; FE is the observed fluorescence intensity without ligand, and FEL is the fluorescence intensity of the Fab·ligand complex at infinite ligand concentration. Stopped-flow Methods—Kinetic measurements were performed on an SX.18MV stopped-flow fluorescence instrument (Applied Photophysics, Leatherhead, UK). The Fab fragment (25–50 nm) was allowed to react with ligand that was in at least 10-fold excess at equilibrium. Reactions were performed in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0) and 100 mm NaCl at 20.0 ± 0.1 °C. Samples were excited at 290 nm, and fluorescence was monitored through a 320 nm cutoff filter. Data points from 19 to 35 reactions were averaged to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. Averaged data were fit to a single exponential or, where systematic deviations in the residuals from the fitted curve were observed, to a double exponential, using Origin 6.1 (Origin Lab Corp., Northampton, MA). In particular, the slow phase of hapten binding (Fig. 5B) is in excellent agreement with a double exponential function, as confirmed by decreased χ2 and increased R2 values with respect to a single exponential fit. The extracted rate constants, designated as kfast, kslow, and kslowest (kobs = 1/τ, where τ is the reciprocal relaxation time), are functions of a combination of terms, including ligand concentration and microscopic rate constants for individual kinetic steps. Values of kfast were fitted to a standard bimolecular association model as follows: 1/τ1 = kfast = k-2 + k2[L], where [L] is the ligand concentration. Values of kslow were fitted to a pre-equilibrium model as follows: 1/τ2 = kslow = k1 + k-1 (Ks/([L] + Ks)), where Ks = k-2/k2 (37Fersht A. Structure and Mechanism in Protein Science. W. H. Freeman & Co, New York1998: 147-149Google Scholar). Conformational Isomerism in 34E4—The crystal structure of the unliganded Fab fragment of antibody 34E4 was determined from an orthorhombic crystal form at 2.6 Å resolution and from a related triclinic form at 2.6 Å resolution by molecular replacement (Table 1). Both crystal forms contain a large number of noncrystallographic symmetry-related Fab molecules (four and eight, respectively) in the crystal asymmetric unit, which allows structural differences due to variable crystal packing environments to be distinguished from conformational changes associated with hapten binding. A detailed quantitative comparison of the free and hapten-bound (26Debler E.W. Ito S. Seebeck F.P. Heine A. Hilvert D. Wilson I.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 4984-4989Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) antibody shows that ligand binding does not shift the relative disposition of the VL and VH domains or cause any major movement of individual CDR loops. The most striking structural difference between liganded and unliganded 34E4 is the orientation of the TrpL91 indole ring (Figs. 2 and 3). In 11 copies of the 12 unliganded Fabs, the side chain of TrpL91 predominantly assumes the m95° rotamer, with χ1 of -60° and χ2 of +95° (38Lovell S.C. Word J.M. Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. Proteins. 2000; 40: 389-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). This rotamer represents the most common side-chain conformation of tryptophan in a data base of 240 high quality protein structures at 1.7 Å resolution or better (38Lovell S.C. Word J.M. Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. Proteins. 2000; 40: 389-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). In only one of the 12 unliganded Fabs does TrpL91 adopt the less common t-105° rotamer, with χ1 of 180° and χ2 of -105° (38Lovell S.C. Word J.M. Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. Proteins. 2000; 40: 389-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). This t-105° rotamer is the only one observed for TrpL91 in the previously determined hapten complex (26Debler E.W. Ito S. Seebeck F.P. Heine A. Hilvert D. Wilson I.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 4984-4989Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The switch between these two m95° and t-105° rotamers substantially remodels the binding pocket and converts it from a shallow indentation on the surface of the protein to a deep cavity that can accommodate ligand (Fig. 4, A and B). Because the electron density of the TrpL91 side chain of some apo Fabs was somewhat weaker than that of the surrounding residues, indicating greater mobility and/or multiple conformations, final placement of the indole side chain into the electron density was guided by a difference Fourier omit map, where the TrpL91 side chain was truncated to the C-β atom. The resulting model then reflects the most prevalent conformation for this residue. Nearby HisH100B is the only other active-site residue to undergo significant movement. However, the rearrangement of its side chain is less pronounced than that of TrpL91.FIGURE 3Superimposition of the free (blue, four independent copies of the orthorhombic crystal form) and hapten-bound (yellow, four independent copies) 34E4. The complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of the light and heavy chains, which are labeled L1–L3 and H1–H3, respectively, undergo only minor changes upon ligand binding, whereas TrpL91 swings into the binding pocket and serves as surrogate ligand in the apo form.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 4Molecular surface representation of free (A) and hapten-bound (B) 34E4. The hapten is displayed as pink stick model. The architecture of the antibody combining site is dramatically different in the two states.

Hilvert D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 1307-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Ligand association is accompanied by changes in intrinsic Fab fluorescence that are resolvable by stopped-flow techniques. Typical kinetic traces are shown in Fig. 5. The fluorescence transients can be roughly divided into three phases, each of which is described by a distinct exponential function. The fast phase of the reaction appears to be complete within ∼0.1 s with an observed rate constant, kfast, of 54 ± 4 s-1 (Fig. 5A). Attempts to fit the subsequent slower process to a single exponential resulted in systematic deviations in the residuals, whereas a double exponential function gave an excellent fit to the data (Fig. 5B), with rate constants kslow = 0.79 ± 0.03 s-1 and kslowest = 0.130 ± 0.005 s-1 for the two additional phases. The observation of triphasic transients is consistent with two possible mechanisms. In one (Fig. 6A), two conformations of the antibody, Fab and Fab*, with different reactivity toward the ligand, are in equilibrium with each other and with the respective ligand-bound complexes (12Foote J. Milstein C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10370-10374Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Induced fit (Fig. 6A, clockwise from top left) and pre-equilibrium (counterclockwise from top left) mechanisms constitute the two limiting cases of this cyclic scheme. In an alternative three-step linear mechanism (Fig. 6B), only one antibody conformer (Fab*) is capable of ligand binding. Once the pocket is occupied, the initially formed Fab*·L complex subsequently undergoes an additional isomerization to form Fab**·L. In this scheme, the central binding step in conjunction with either the initial or final equilibria alone would correspond to the limiting pre-equilibrium and induced fit mechanisms, respectively. In principle, an induced fit mechanism can be distinguished from a pre-equilibrium mechanism from the dependence of the slow phase on ligand concentration (37Fersht A. Structure and Mechanism in Protein Science. W. H. Freeman & Co, New York1998: 147-149Google Scholar). However, because the change in kslow is most pronounced at ligand concentrations below the dissociation constant of the Fab·ligand complex, and negligible at saturating ligand concentrations (12Foote J. Milstein C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10370-10374Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), it was not possible to resolve this issue with the tight binding hapten 5. Biphasic Kinetics of Substrate Analog Binding—Benztriazole 6 (Fig. 1) is a substrate analog that binds to the 34E4 Fab fragment with lower affinity (Kd = 643 ± 26 nm) than the hapten, as judged by fluorescence titration. The weaker affinity of this ligand was exploited to examine the concentration dependence of the rate constants associated with binding. For complex formation between 34E4 and 6, only the fast (∼0.1 s) and slow (∼5 s) phases were observed (Fig. 7A). At 5 μm, kfast and kslow were 69.0 ± 0.5 and 0.68 ± 0.03 s-1, respectively, in good agreement with kfast and kslow values obtained with 5. Although a very slow phase with low signal amplitude cannot be definitively ruled out, the available data support a simpler mechanism, such as an induced fit or pre-equilibrium pathway, for association of the substrate analog. To distinguish between the induced fit and pre-equilibrium mechanisms, the influence of ligand concentration on the fast and slow phases was determined. The fast phase of the reaction was linearly dependent on the concentration of the substrate analog (Fig. 7B), consistent with a simple bimolecular association step for ligand binding to the antibody with a second-order association rate constant (k2) of (1.23 ± 0.01) × 107 m-1 s-1 and a dissociation rate constant (k-2) of 6.96 ± 0.12 s-1 (39Lancet D. Pecht I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 3549-3553Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The resulting affinity constant (K2 = k2/k-2) for the Fab·6 complex is (1.77 ± 0.01) × 106 m-1. By contrast, the rate constant for the slow phase, kslow, decreased with increasing concentration of the substrate analog (Fig. 7C), which is consistent with a pre-equilibrium mechanism (37Fersht A. Structure and Mechanism in Protein Science. W. H. Freeman & Co, New York1998: 147-149Google Scholar). The slow phase when fitted to a pre-equilibrium model gave values of 0.50 ± 0.02 s-1 for the forward rate constant (k1) and 1.55 ± 0.08 s-1 for the reverse rate constant (k-1). Thus, the Fab apparently exists as two conformational isomers in solution in an equilibrium ratio of ∼3:1, which favors the nonbinding form. The overall association constant, defined as Ka = K2/(1 + K1-1) (39Lancet D. Pecht I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 3549-3553Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), is (4.3 ± 0.5) × 105 m-1, which corresponds to a dissociation constant (Kd = 1/Ka) of 2.3 ± 0.3 μm. An increase in kslow at very high ligand concentrations relative to Kd (data not shown) suggests that the “inactive” Fab conformation may have weak affinity for the ligand or that ligand may induce another conformational change (12Foote J. Milstein C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10370-10374Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). This finding may account for the small difference between the calculated dissociation constant and the equilibrium value determined by fluorescence titration. Ligand binding to 34E4 does not conform precisely to standard “lock and key” or “induced fit” mechanisms. Instead, the antibody exists as a mixture of “closed” and “open” forms in its resting state, only the latter of which is competent to bind ligand. In the closed state, which predominates in the absence of ligand, the bulky aromatic side chain of TrpL91 occupies the binding pocket, thereby blocking substrate access. When the indole moves out of the binding site, a deep pocket is created that can accommodate substrate and, hence, position it appropriately for rapid proton abstraction by GluH50. The initial burst phase detected by stopped flow, which is completed in about 50 ms, can be attributed to ligand binding to the small fraction of antibody present in its open conformation at equilibrium. The change in fluorescence upon complex formation during this phase (an increase in the case of cationic hapten derivative 5 and a large decrease with the neutral substrate analog 6) is consistent with stacking of the ligand against TrpL91 in the resulting complex. In the subsequent slow phase, which proceeds over several seconds, association of the ligand depends on re-equilibration of the isomeric antibody conformers. The structural data argue against the latter process being induced by ligand, because binding to the closed form of the antibody would hinder the TrpL91 rotameric switch. In contrast, the very slow phase, which is apparent only with the original hapten, probably reflects an induced fit adjustment of the protein around the bound ligand to form the high-affinity complex. The binding properties of 34E4 resemble those of the noncatalytic antibody SPE7 (27James L.C. Roversi P. Tawfik D.S. Science. 2003; 299: 1362-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar, 28James L.C. Tawfik D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 12730-12735Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), which exploits multiple conformations to permit binding to several ligands with micromolar to nanomolar affinity. Consistent with their nearly identical light chains and similarly configured active sites, both antibodies exhibit triphasic kinetics for binding their cognate haptens and simpler biphasic kinetics with lower affinity ligands. The relative magnitudes of the derived microscopic rate constants are similar, although the rates of the pre-equilibrium and the very slow induced fit steps are roughly 10-fold slower in 34E4 than SPE7. In structural terms, the conformational changes in 34E4 are less dramatic than in SPE7. However, in both antibodies, the switch between the t-105° and m95° rotamers of structurally analogous tryptophans controls access of the aromatic haptens to the active site. Moreover, once bound, the planar ligands are sandwiched between this indole ring (TrpL91 or TrpL93) and a tyrosine (TyrH100D in 34E4 or TyrH105 in SPE7). What are the consequences of a pre-equilibrium mechanism of 34E4 for catalytic efficiency? In the absence of ligand, the inactive form of the antibody predominates and diminishes the concentration of functional active sites. As a consequence, catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) will be reduced by a factor of at least 3 or 4. Furthermore, conversion of the inactive into the active conformer is relatively slow. Given the similarity of the rate constant for this process (0.5 s-1) and the kcat value for proton transfer for the Fab (0.45 s-1) (25Seebeck F.P. Hilvert D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 1307-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), conformational isomerism may (partially) limit turnover of the catalyst. 5Consistent with the presence of a minor population of active catalyst in solution, preliminary stopped-flow measurements of the antibody-catalyzed decomposition of 5-nitrobenzisoxazole indicate a small initial burst in activity prior to attainment of the steady state. The effect is modest, however, suggesting that the rate constant for proton transfer is not much larger (∼2 times) than the rate constant k1 for conversion of the inactive into the active form of the antibody. Whether conformational dynamics have a direct influence on the actual proton transfer step is uncertain, but the very slow induced fit adjustment of the binding site to hapten derivative 5 is suggestive. The complementarity between the protein and the substrate would be similarly expected to increase as the proton is transferred to GluH50 in the transition state, which could lead to a tightening of the structure. Unliganded and liganded forms of 18 other catalytic antibodies have been characterized structurally and deposited in the Protein Data Bank (40Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (27540) Google Scholar). Conformational changes are evident in nine. These recapitulate the structural adjustments seen in many noncatalytic antibodies (3Padlan E.A. Mol. Immunol. 1994; 31: 169-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar, 10Wilson I.A.

In three catalysts, an aromatic side chain flips into the binding pocket as in 34E4, occupying or partly overlapping with the substrate-binding site. In antibody 4C6, which catalyzes a cationic cyclization reaction, the TrpL89 indole regulates ligand binding in this way (41Zhu X. Heine A. Monnat F. Houk K.N. Janda K.D. Wilson I.A. J. Mol.

Although these catalysts have not been characterized by pre-steady state kinetics, they would also be expected to display a pre-equilibrium mechanism like 34E4. Achieving enzyme-like efficiency in an immunoglobulin scaffold still remains a formidable challenge. General problems associated with imperfect hapten design, indirect selection, and limited screening procedures have been recognized (2Hilvert D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 751-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Here we show that efficacy can also be compromised by an unfavorable conformational equilibrium that transforms the active form of the catalyst into an inactive form that cannot bind substrate. As aromatic moieties are prevalent in haptens used to elicit high-affinity antibodies, such structural rearrangements may be inevitable (45Padlan E.A. Adv. Protein Chem. 1996; 49: 57-133Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). With respect to catalysis by antibody 34E4, stabilization of the ligand-competent form by active-site redesign to fix the TrpL91 in place may augment its catalytic power. More generally, protein engineering to attenuate the problem of adverse structural rearrangements promises to yield better antibody, as well as other protein catalysts.

Quality control in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 4The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; HLA, human leukocyte antigen; β2m, β2-microglubulin; TAP, transporter associated with antigen processing; NK, natural killer; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)-dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate. 4The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; HLA, human leukocyte antigen; β2m, β2-microglubulin; TAP, transporter associated with antigen processing; NK, natural killer; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)-dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate. ensures the proper folding, oligomerization, and sorting of glycoproteins. Primary quality control, common to all glycoproteins, is carried out by successive rounds of glucosylation and de-glucosylation of N-linked glycans. In this process, known as the calnexin cycle, monoglucosylated glycoproteins are the elective substrates of the lectin-like “retention-retrieval” chaperones calnexin (a transmembrane protein) and/or calreticulin (the soluble homologue of calnexin) and become folded and disulfide-bonded through the concerted action of calnexin, calreticulin, the thiol-dependent oxido-reductase ERp57, protein disulfide isomerase, and other members of the quality control machinery (1Helenius A. Aebi M. Science. 2001; 291: 2364-2369Crossref PubMed Scopus (1955) Google Scholar).Trimmed, conformed substrates are released for intracellular transport and further processing, but the maturation, assembly, folding, and intracellular transport of some glycoproteins require specialized steps, collectively known as secondary quality control (1Helenius A. Aebi M. Science. 2001; 291: 2364-2369Crossref PubMed Scopus (1955) Google Scholar). It is agreed that secondary (protein-specific) quality control has two general features: (a) it takes place after completion of primary quality control, and (b) it involves the formation of dedicated complexes between glycoprotein substrates and ER proteins acting as either chaperones or escorts/guides for intracellular transport. To the best of our knowledge, major histocompatibility complex class I molecules are an intriguing exception in both respects, because (a) their primary and secondary quality control mechanisms are subtly intertwined, and (b) they simultaneously bind generic and class I-dedicated chaperones (1Helenius A. Aebi M. Science. 2001; 291: 2364-2369Crossref PubMed Scopus (1955) Google Scholar, 2Cresswell P. Ackerman A.L. Giodini A. Peaper D.R. Wearsch P.A. Immunol. Rev. 2005; 207: 145-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar).Class I major histocompatibility complex molecules (also called HLA-A, -B, -C in humans, H-2K, -2D, -2L in mice, and RT1 in rats) are formed upon heterotrimeric assembly of: (a) a highly polymorphic heavy (44 kDa) chain carrying up to three glycosylation sites, only one of which (at position 86) is highly conserved across species and present in human molecules; (b) a non-polymorphic, non-glycosylated light (12 kDa) chain subunit (β2-microglubulin, β2m); and (c) a short (8–11 mer) peptide antigen derived from the cytosolic degradation of cellular proteins. The heavy chain binds calnexin, associates with β2m, and is loaded with peptide on a unique folding and quality control station called “peptide loading complex,” formed by the supramolecular association of generic and class I-dedicated chaperones. The former include calnexin (only in murine cells), calreticulin, ERp57, and protein disulfide isomerase, recently identified (3Park B. Lee S. Kim E. Cho K. Riddell S.R. Cho S. Ahn K. Cell. 2006; 127: 369-382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The latter include the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP), a heterodimeric membrane pump that translocates peptides from the cytosol into the ER lumen, and tapasin, a peptide editor/facilitator. Thermally stable (peptide-bound), conformed class I heterotrimers are released from the peptide loading complex, leave the ER, and are exported to the cell surface for functional recognition by CD8 T lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells (2Cresswell P. Ackerman A.L. Giodini A. Peaper D.R. Wearsch P.A. Immunol. Rev. 2005; 207: 145-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar).There is evidence that class I heavy chains are sequentially de-glucosylated and re-glucosylated (4van Leeuwen J.E. Kearse K.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13997-14001Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), e.g. they undergo the calnexin cycle and become increasingly conformed upon successive interaction with calnexin and calreticulin (Ref. 5Sadasivan B.

Fruci D. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Giacomini P. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 6651-6658Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), but the importance of N-linked glycosylation and the specific role of the two glycosylation-dependent chaperones remain elusive. For instance, (a) ER retention of misfolded class I heavy chains is mediated by calnexin when interaction with the peptide loading complex cannot take place, e.g. in β2m-deficient cells and in insect cells (7Degen E. Cohen-Doyle M.F. Williams D.B. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1653-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 8Rajagopalan S. Brenner M.B. J. Exp.

Immunol. 1995; 155: 143-148PubMed Google Scholar); (c) the Asn-86 class I glycan is not required for calnexin binding and, although required for calreticulin binding, its absence disrupts generic (with calreticulin and ERp57) and class I-dedicated (with TAP and tapasin) chaperoning steps altogether (15Harris M.R.

Moreover, the only two mutants that have been studied in detail displayed two different phenotypes; the human mutant was completely refractory to peptide assembly, in vivo as well as in vitro (22Harris M.R.

Chem. 2004; 279: 16077-16082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), an alteration reminiscent of those seen in cells defective in calreticulin, TAP, or tapasin (24Gao B.

Shimizu Y. Sekhon G.S. DeMars R. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 5525-5536PubMed Google Scholar).In summary, the functional redundancy of calnexin and calreticulin, the integration of generic and class I-dedicated quality control steps within the peptide loading complex, the global and/or uninformative disruptions in class I chaperoning and folding caused by an absence of the Asn-86 glycan, as well as differences among species and class I alleles, make it difficult to assess the relative contributions (and/or stepwise occurrence) of primary (glycosylation-assisted) and secondary (peptide loading-dependent) quality control events.To address these issues, we have characterized an N-glycosylation-defective mutant of a class I HLA molecule (the HLA-Cw*0102 heavy chain). The Cw1 allele was selected because of its poor and very slow class I assembly (27Sibilio L. Martayan A. Setini A. Lo Monaco E. Tremante E. Butler R.H. Giacomini P. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 1267-1274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), two features expected to be most useful in dissecting biosynthetic intermediates and steps. We show herein that the Cw1 mutant differs, in its chaperoning and folding intermediates, from all the previously described conformers of mutant as well as wild-type class I heavy chains. This reveals a crucial mergence between primary and secondary quality control events in a model glycoprotein.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Lines—The 721.221 (221 hereafter) cell line lacks the expression of HLA-A, -B, -C but retains the expression of HLA-E and -F molecules (28Shimizu Y.

Mutagenesis introduced a single conservative substitution at codon 88 (from GAG to GGG) of the Cw1 heavy chain, turning the N-glycosylation consensus NQS into NQG (HLA-Cw1S88G hereafter).

Underexposed autoradiographs of filter blots (chemiluminescence) and dried gels ([35S]methionine) were analyzed by densitometry using the public domain NIH Image program, following image calibration to an optical density step reference marker (serial 2-fold dilutions of class I immunoprecipitates).RESULTSBiochemical Analysis of the HLA-Cw1S88G Glycosylation-defective Mutant—The 221 cell line, lacking classical class I molecules, was stably transfected with DNAs encoding wild-type Cw1 and glycosylation-defective Cw1S88G. Parental 221 cells and the two transfectants were compared by biochemical methods and flow cytometry (Fig. 1, A and B–D, respectively). Nonidet P-40 lysates from metabolically labeled cells were immunoprecipitated in parallel with antibodies known (6Sibilio L. Martayan A. Setini A. Fraioli R. Fruci D. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Giacomini P. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 6651-6658Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) to bind unfolded, β2m-free Cw1 heavy chains (L31) and folded, β2m-associated Cw1 heavy chains (W6/32 and F4/326). In the SDS-PAGE slab shown in Fig. 1A, Cw1 and Cw1S88G polypeptides of the expected 44- and 40-kDa sizes, respectively, were detected by all the antibodies in transfectants (lanes 4–7 and 12–15) but not in parental 221 cells (lanes 2 and 3), whereas a third component migrating between these two bands was detected in all the cells but only by the W6/32 antibody (lanes 3, 5, and 7), known to recognize a widely shared class I epitope (32Brodsky F.M. Parham P. Barnstable C.J. Crumpton M.J. Bodmer W.F. Immunol. Rev. 1979; 47: 3-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). In view of its size, presence in untransfected 221 cells, and lack of reactivity with L31 and F4/326, this component corresponds to non-classical class I heavy chains known to be expressed at low levels in 221 cells (see Ref. (33Mizuno S. Kang S.H. Lee H.W. Trapani J.A. Dupont B. Yang S.Y. Immunogenetics. 1989; 29: 323-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). As also expected, glycosylation-defective Cw1S88G heavy chains migrated with an electrophoretic mobility very similar to that of enzymatically de-glycosylated HLA-Cw1 and non-classical heavy chains (Fig. 1A, lanes 8–11).Removal of the N-glycosylation site increased and decreased, respectively, β2m-free and β2m-associated heavy chains (Fig. 1A, compare lanes 4 and 6, 12 and 14, 5 and 7, 13 and 15). Densitometric analysis of heavy chain and β2m bands, carried out on L31 and F4/326 immunoprecipitates without the interference of non-classical class I molecules, revealed an inversion in the β2m-free:β2m-associated heavy chain ratios from ∼0.5 in Cw1 to ∼3.0 in Cw1S88G (Fig. 1A, lanes 12–13 compared with lanes 14–15), whereas heavy chain:β2m ratios were similar in the two transfectants (3.5 and 3.0 in lanes 13 and 15, respectively).In 15 separate flow cytometry experiments (one of which is shown in Fig. 1B), the surface reactivity of 221.Cw1S88G with L31, F4/326, and W6/32 ranged from 30 to 45% the reactivity of the same antibodies with 221.Cw1 (Fig. 1, C and D). Non-classical heavy chains, detectable in small amounts in parental 221 cells (Fig. 1B), are expected to similarly and negligibly contribute to the W6/32-reactive pool in the two transfectants.Altogether, the results in Fig. 1 demonstrate that removal of the unique Cw1 glycosylation site impairs heavy chain folding without appreciably affecting the stability of β2m association of the few heavy chains that manage to acquire conformational epitopes. As expected, poor folding results in poor surface expression of all the heavy chain conformers.Interaction of HLA-Cw1S88G Heavy Chains with Chaperones and Members of the Peptide Loading Complex—Impaired folding of Cw1S88G is likely to reflect deranged interaction with cellular chaperones. To address this issue, wild-type and glycosylation-defective Cw1 heavy chains were solubilized by CHAPS from the 221.Cw1 and 221.Cw1S88G transfectants and either co-immunoprecipitated by antibodies to calnexin, calreticulin, ERp57, tapasin, and TAP1 or directly immunoprecipitated by the control antibody L31, specific for unfolded HLA-C. Upon SDS-PAGE and filter blotting with L31 itself (Fig. 2A, short and long exposures of the filters are both displayed), wild-type Cw1 was detectable in association with all the chaperones (lanes 2–6), as expected. In contrast, the Cw1S88G mutant (Fig. 2A, lanes 10–12) lost its ability to interact with calreticulin, ERp57, and possibly tapasin (that was barely detectable in the overexposed panel only) and accumulated in two conformations (calnexin-bound and L31-reactive, Fig. 1A, compare lanes 2 and 7 to lanes 9 and 14, respectively) known to be particularly unfolded and partially overlapping (5Sadasivan B. Lehner P.J. Ortmann B. Spies T. Cresswell P. Immunity. 1996; 5: 103-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar, 6Sibilio L. Martayan A. Setini A. Fraioli R. Fruci D. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Giacomini P. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 6651-6658Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, despite these multiple derangements in cellular chaperoning, Cw1S88G retained partial binding to TAP (Fig. 2A, lane 13).FIGURE 2Co-immunoprecipitation of Cw1 and Cw1S88G with chaperones and members of the peptide loading complex. A, CHAPS lysates of 221.Cw1 and 221.Cw1S88G cells were immunoprecipitated with antibodies to the indicated chaperones (clnx, calnexin; clrt, calreticulin) with L31 to Cw1 heavy chains, or in the absence of specific antibodies. Immunoprecipitates were run on a SDS-PAGE slab and blotted with L31 to HLA-C heavy chains. Filters are optimally exposed in the top panels and overexposed (arrows) in the bottom panels. B, the same immunoprecipitation experiment as in A with 220 and 220.Cw1S88G cells (lanes 15–28). CHAPS lysates were electrophoresed and electroblotted in parallel in lanes 29 and 30 (underexposed in the inset).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)These results were reproduced in four additional, independent experiments. The densitometric intensities of the immunoprecipitated and co-immunoprecipitated Cw1S88G heavy chain bands in each experiment were normalized with respect to the intensities of the corresponding Cw1 bands, averaged, and expressed in arbitrary units as mean values (± S.D.). –Fold increases in calnexin association and L31 reactivity caused by a lack of glycosylation were estimated to be 1.32 (± 0.15) and 2.00 (± 0.30), respectively. Residual interaction with TAP amounted to 0.21 (± 0.08). Binding to calreticulin and ERp57, as well as tapasin, remained invariably undetectable, indicating that tapasin-Cw1S88G interaction, if any, is too close to the sensitivity threshold of our co-immunoprecipitation assay to be reproducibly observed. It can be concluded that a lack of N-linked glycosylation deranges generic chaperoning but reproducibly spares some class I-specific interactions with TAP.To investigate the role of glycosylation in a cell line that can only provide generic chaperoning, 220 cells were selected in which class I-dedicated chaperoning is selectively lost due to a lack of functional tapasin but residual Cw1 expression (26Greenwood R. Shimizu Y. Sekhon G.S. DeMars R. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 5525-5536PubMed Google Scholar) and class I-calreticulin interaction (34Solheim J.C. Harris M.R. Kindle C.S. Hansen T.H. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2236-2241PubMed Google Scholar) are retained. CHAPS extracts from 220 cells and their stable 220.Cw1S88G transfectants were directly blotted with L31 to assess the levels of the two heavy chains. Cw1S88G (overexpressed under the control of a strong promoter) was almost three times more abundant than wild-type Cw1 in untransfected 220 cells run in parallel (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 30 and 29, see inset; densitometric data not shown). Overexpression of Cw1S88G depressed the accumulation of endogenous Cw1 that was five times less abundant than the co-expressed mutant at steady-state (Fig. 2B, lane 30), most likely due to competition for the translation and/or transcription machinery. Whatever the precise mechanism, Cw1S88G was considerably more unfolded than Cw1, as assessed by its marked accumulation in L31 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2B, lane 28 compared with lane 21). Accordingly, its interaction with calnexin was induced or greatly enhanced (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 23 and 16). Interaction with calreticulin remained apparently similar (Fig. 2B, lanes 24 and 17), a finding that, considered in the context of overexpression and extensive unfolding of Cw1S88G, suggests weakened rather than conserved interaction. No TAP, tapasin, or ERp57 interaction with Cw1 or Cw1S88G was detected in either cell line (Fig. 2B, lanes 18–20 and 25–27).In summary, the results in Fig. 2 show that a lack of N-linked glycosylation: (a) preferentially affects interaction with the generic chaperones calnexin and calreticulin, whereas class I-dedicated chaperoning by TAP is less severely affected; (b) causes an additional class I folding impairment in a cell line that is already defective in HLA-dedicated (tapasin-dependent) chaperoning; and (c) causes a redistribution of heavy chains toward unfolded (L31-reactive and calnexin-bound) conformations. Because a lack of glycosylation and a lack of efficient peptide loading have distinct, complementary, and additive effects, glycosylation-mediated chaperoning of Cw1 may be placed upstream of peptide loading.Disruption of physiological chaperoning in Fig. 2, A and B, is due to a folding impairment in vivo and not to the absence of the glycan moiety per se, because endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H digestion of calnexin, calreticulin, and TAP co-immunoprecipitates from wild-type 221.Cw1 transfectants did not appreciably disrupt any preformed chaperone interaction (supplemental Fig. S1).Pulse-Chase Analysis and Thermal Stability of HLA-Cw1 and HLA-Cw1S88G Heavy Chains—Next, we focused on class I folds. Pulse-chase experiments were performed in parallel with 221.Cw1 and 221.Cw1S88G transfectants to compare the appearance and turnover of L31- and F4/326-reactive conformers. To assess the timing of thermal stabilization of the latter, extracts were divided into two aliquots and preincubated for 4 h at either 4 or 37 °C before immunoprecipitation. Fig. 3 shows autoradiography and densitometric scans of Cw1 heavy chain bands. As expected, the two conformers peaked at early and late chase points (5 and 105 min, Fig. 3, lanes 2 and 11) with a considerable time lag (100 min) between the peaks. The peak of F4/326 reactivity coincided with the acquisition of thermal stability (Fig. 3, compare lanes 11 and 12 to lanes 17 and 18). In sharp contrast, no clear peaks were evident in the kinetics of accumulation of the two Cw1S88G heavy chain conformers. L31-reactive Cw1S88G heavy chains were most abundant at time 0 min and then slowly and progressively declined (Fig. 3, lanes 19–24). F4/326-reactive heavy chains instead displayed a gradual increase until 45 min of chase, mirrored by a subsequent, slow decrease (Fig. 3, lanes 25–30) and acquired little thermal stability throughout the chase, as documented by their flat densitometric profile (lanes 31–36). In addition, during the three initial chase points, F4/326 conformers were present in slightly greater amounts in 221.Cw1S88G (Fig. 3, lanes 25–27) than in 221.Cw1 (lanes 7–9) cells, indicating that some Cw1S88G molecules acquired the F4/326 epitope before the physiological time window (45–105 min) of thermal stabilization. Thus, in the absence of glycosylation, we observed abnormal kinetics of conformer accumulation beginning at the earliest (0–5 min) chase points, as well as an altered timing and a compromised efficiency in thermal stabilization.FIGURE 3Pulse-chase analysis of 221.Cw1 and 221.Cw1S88G transfectants. The two stable transfectants were pulsed for 5 min with [35S]methionine (9 MBq/ml), chased for the indicated times, and lysed by Nonidet P-40. Lysates were divided into three aliquots, two of which were kept at 4 °C (lanes 1–12 and 19–30). The third aliquot was incubated at 37 °C for 4 h (lanes 13–18 and 31–36). Then, class I molecules were immunoprecipitated with the indicated antibodies and resolved by SDS-PAGE as described in the legend to Fig. 1.

https://openalex.org/W1986191687,"Background Several human malignancies are associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and more than 95% of the adult human population carries this virus lifelong. EBV efficiently infects human B cells and persists in this cellular compartment latently. EBV-infected B cells become activated and growth transformed, express a characteristic set of viral latent genes, and acquire the status of proliferating lymphoblastoid cell lines in vitro. Because EBV infects only primate cells, it has not been possible to establish a model of infection in immunocompetent rodents. Such a model would be most desirable in order to study EBV's pathogenesis and latency in a suitable and amenable host. Methodology/Principal Findings We stably introduced recombinant EBV genomes into mouse embryonic stem cells and induced their differentiation to B cells in vitro to develop the desired model. In vitro differentiated murine B cells maintained the EBV genomes but expression of viral genes was restricted to the latent membrane proteins (LMPs). In contrast to human B cells, EBV's nuclear antigens (EBNAs) were not expressed detectably and growth transformed murine B cells did not arise in vitro. Aberrant splicing and premature termination of EBNA mRNAs most likely prevented the expression of EBNA genes required for B-cell transformation. Conclusions/Significance Our findings indicate that fundamental differences in gene regulation between mouse and man might block the route towards a tractable murine model for EBV."
