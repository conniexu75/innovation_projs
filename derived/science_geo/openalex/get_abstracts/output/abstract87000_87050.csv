https://openalex.org/W2030149741,"An antiserum against material shed into serum-free medium by MCF-7 human mammary carcinoma cells (anti-SFM II) disrupts cell-cell interactions in murine mammary tumor epithelial cells (MMTE). We now report purification of an 80 kd glycoprotein (GP80) from SFM of MCF-7 mammary carcinoma cells that blocks the activity of anti-SFM II. Anti-SFM II also inhibits compaction of eight-cell mouse embryos, and purified GP80 blocks this reaction. An antiserum against purified GP80 (anti-GP80) has all adhesion-disrupting activities displayed by anti-SFM II. It recognizes one band at 80 kd in SFM and a 120 kd band in detergent extracts of epithelial but not fibroblastic cells. In immunofluorescence studies it is restricted to sites of cell-cell interaction in cultured epithelial cells. Thus a cell surface glycoprotein of 120 kd, the medium form of which is ∼80 kd, which is neither species nor tissue specific, is expressed at early stages of mammalian development and is found on epithelia."
https://openalex.org/W2048380590,"The body wall muscle cells of the nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans, contain two unique types of myosin heavy chain, A and B. We have utilized an immunochemical approach to define the structural location of these two myosins within body wall muscle thick filaments. By immunofluorescence microscopy, myosin B antibodies label the thick filament-containing A-bands of body wall muscle with the exception of a thin gap at the center of each A-band, and myosin A antibodies react to form a medial fluorescent stripe within each A-band. The complexes of these monoclonal antibodies with isolated thick filaments were negatively stained and studied by electron microscopy. The myosin B antibody reacts with the polar regions of all filaments but does not react with a central 0.9 micron zone. The myosin A antibody reacts with a central 1.8 micron zone in all filaments but does not react with the polar regions."
https://openalex.org/W2017284486,"We have altered the structure of the COOH-terminus of the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) glycoprotein (G) by introducing deletions into a cDNA clone encoding G protein. We examined the effects of these deletions on intracellular transport of G protein after expression of the deleted genes in eucaryotic cells under control of the SV40 late promoter. To prevent readthrough of translation into vector sequences, we introduced synthetic DNA linkers containing translation stop codons at the site of the deletion. G proteins that lacked the cytoplasmic domain and most of the transmembrane domain were secreted slowly from the cells. Deletion mutants affecting the structure of the cytoplasmic domain fell into two classes. The first class completely arrested transport of the protein to the cell surface at a stage prior to acquisition of complex oligosaccharides. The second class showed severely reduced rates of complex sugar addition although the proteins were eventually transported to the cell surface. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy suggested that mutant proteins in both classes may accumulate in the rough endoplasmic reticulum."
https://openalex.org/W2011621580,"A peptide that accumulated as the major product during the proteolysis of arginine vasopressin by rat brain synaptic membranes was isolated and its structure was shown to be the hexapeptide pGlu-Asn-Cys(Cys)-Pro-Arg-Gly-NH2. When administered intracerebroventricularly in extremely low doses, this vasopressin fragment and its desglycinamide derivative facilitated memory consolidation in a passive avoidance situation. These vasopressin metabolites, which are devoid of pressor activity, constitute highly potent neuropeptides with selective effects on memory and related processes; they are activated via proteolytic processing of vasopressin by brain peptidases."

https://openalex.org/W2083038106,"Spectrin and related proteins are made up of a common calmodulin-binding subunit tightly associated with a variant subunit. We have analyzed the distribution of the variant subunits in various cell types using subunit-specific antibodies in immunofluorescence as well as western blotting and in some cases have compared the subunits by two-dimensional peptide mapping. We have found that in the majority of cell types (lymphocytes, hepatocytes, neurons, fibroblasts) fodrin 235 K is present in the absence of the other two variant subunits, spectrin 220 K and TW260. Two cell types were found (skeletal muscle and erythrocytes) which contained only the spectrin variant. Two cell types display two distinct variant subunits. Both fodrin 235 K and spectrin 220 K are detected in cardiac muscle whereas TW260 is present in addition to fodrin 235 K in intestinal epithelial cells. During the early stages of embryonic development of the chicken intestine, fodrin 235 K is expressed in the epithelial cells whereas TW260 and spectrin are not detectable. TW260 is expressed relatively late in development (15-16 days) and is inserted only in the apical (brush border) membrane compartment whereas fodrin 235 K is present in these same cells and underlies the entire plasma membrane. These results suggest that fodrin provides the general linkage system between microfilaments and the membrane in nonerythroid and nonmuscle cells."
https://openalex.org/W1607998540,"A positively charged amino acid sequence, located on the NH2 terminus of the polypeptides of the chlorophyll a/b light harvesting complex, stabilizes thylakoid membrane adhesion. Threonine residues in this segment are the site of light-induced, reversible phosphorylation; this covalent modification results in changes in excitation-energy distribution in chloroplast membranes. Removal of the positively charged peptide by treatment with trypsin or chemical modification of amino acids in the sequence disrupts thylakoid adhesion and inhibits regulation of excitation-energy distribution. Purified preparations of the chlorophyll a/b light harvesting complex consist of 2 major polypeptides of 27 and 26 kDa and 2 minor polypeptides of 29 and 25 kDa (based upon sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis). Trypsin treatment of the isolated chlorophyll proteins decreases the apparent molecular mass of the 27- and 26-kDa polypeptides by 1-1.5 kDa and releases 3 peptides; [Lys, Arg], Ser-Ala-Thr-Thr-Lys-Lys, and Ser-Ala-Thr-Thr-Lys. These peptides probably form the overlap sequence, [Lys, Arg]-Ser-Ala-Thr-Thr-Lys-Lys. The polypeptides of the chlorophyll a/b light-harvesting complex were separated by isoelectric focusing into 5 chlorophyll protein fractions which had isoelectric points between 4.0 and 4.55. The 27-kDa polypeptides had an isoelectric point of 4.3, and bound 11 chlorophyll molecules/polypeptide."

https://openalex.org/W1966426785,"A phenolic glycolipid from Mycobacterium leprae was purified and used as antigen in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Antibodies directed against the lipid were seen in serums from leprosy patients but not in serums from uninfected controls or patients infected with other mycobacteria, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The antibody response distinguished between the Mycobacterium leprae lipid and the structurally related phenolic glycolipid from Mycobacterium kansasii. This assay has considerable potential as a specific serodiagnostic test for leprosy infection."
https://openalex.org/W1495785926,"Pyruvate:flavodoxin oxidoreductase, the nifJ gene product of Klebsiella pneumoniae, was purified to homogeneity. Pyruvate:flavodoxin oxidoreductase, flavodoxin, and nitrogenase components I and II are the only proteins required for pyruvate-coupled nitrogenase activity. The physiological source of electrons to nitrogenase in K. pneumoniae is pyruvate. Flavodoxin from Azotobacter vinelandii was only one-third as effective as K. pneumoniae flavodoxin in transferring electrons from pyruvate:flavodoxin oxidoreductase to Azotobacter and Klebsiella nitrogenases. Ferredoxins from aerobic, anaerobic and photosynthetic nitrogen-fixing organisms, as well as benzyl viologen and methyl viologen, were ineffective in coupling pyruvate oxidation to nitrogenase activity. One mol each of acetyl-CoA, CO2, and ethylene are formed by pyruvate-supported acetylene reduction. The enzyme contains 8.0 +/- 0.6 mol of iron and 6.6 +/- 0.2 mol of acid-labile sulfide per mol of protein (Mr = 240,000). Pyruvate:flavodoxin oxidoreductase is irreversibly inactivated by air."

https://openalex.org/W2037368509,"Aerobic organisms depend on superoxide dismutase to suppress the formation of dangerous species of activated oxygen. Intraerythrocytic stages of the malaria parasite exist within a highly aerobic environment and cause the generation of increased amounts of activated oxygen. Plasmodium berghei in mice was found to derive a substantial amount of superoxide dismutase activity from the host cell cytoplasm. Plasmodia isolated from mouse red cells contained mouse superoxide dismutase, whereas rat-derived parasites contained the rat enzyme. This is believed to be the first example of the acquisition of a host cell enzyme by an intracellular parasite."
https://openalex.org/W1983195014,"The complete nucleotide sequence of the diphtheria tox228 gene encoding the nontoxic serologically related protein CRM228 has been determined. A comparison of the predicted amino acid sequence with the available amino acid sequences from the wild-type toxin made it possible to deduce essentially the entire nucleotide sequence of the wild-type tox gene. The signal peptide of pro-diphtheria toxin and the putative tox promoter have been identified, a highly symmetrical nucleotide sequence downstream of the toxin gene has been detected; this region may be the corynebacteriophage β attachment site (attP). The cloned toxin gene was expressed at a low level in Escherichia coli."
https://openalex.org/W1540926229,"A mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been obtained that shows an absolute growth requirement for long chain bases found in sphingolipids. In the absence of a long chain base, the cells are unable to synthesize the phosphoinositol-containing sphingolipids characteristic of yeast. These results suggest that one or more of the yeast sphingolipids plays a vital biological role."
https://openalex.org/W1561254531,"The protein toxin present in Bordetella pertussis vaccine blocks the inhibition of adenylate cyclase by prostaglandins and adenosine which may be secondary to ADP-ribosylation of an inhibitory guanine nucleotide-binding protein. The stimulatory effects of alpha 1-catecholamine agonists on 32P uptake into phosphatidic acid and phosphatidylinositol in isolated rat adipocytes were virtually abolished by pertussis toxin treatment. In contrast, the stimulatory effects of insulin were increased in adipocytes after pertussis toxin treatment. Pertussis toxin treatment did not alter insulin stimulation of glucose oxidation and actually increased glucose conversion to lipid. Basal lipolysis was elevated in adipocytes by pertussis toxin treatment but not basal cyclic AMP. However, the increases in cyclic AMP and lipolysis due to low concentrations of catecholamines and forskolin were markedly potentiated by pertussis toxin treatment. The inhibitory effects of adenosine on cyclic AMP stimulation due to catecholamines were abolished by pertussis toxin. These data indicate that pertussis toxin selectively interferes with inhibition of cyclic AMP accumulation in rat adipocytes by adenosine, potentiates the increases in cyclic AMP due to catecholamines, increases the stimulatory effects of insulin on adipocyte metabolism, and interferes with alpha 1-catecholamine stimulation of phosphatidylinositol turnover."
https://openalex.org/W1480167546,"Nonpenetrating proteolytic enzymes (such as thermolysin) were used to probe the cytosolic surface of the outer envelope membrane from spinach chloroplasts. Up to 20 different envelope polypeptides were susceptible to a mild digestion of isolated intact chloroplasts by thermolysin. Most of the thermolysin-sensitive envelope polypeptides were not extracted by a mixture of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v). A clear exception was E10 which is hydrophobic and, in addition, is an integral membrane polypeptide. Using antibodies to envelope polypeptides sensitive (E10 and E24) and insensitive (E30 and E37) to thermolysin, we demonstrated that only antibodies to E10 and E24, but not antibodies to E30 and E37, induced agglutination of intact chloroplasts. In addition, immunofluorescence experiments demonstrated that only antibodies to E10 and E24, but not antibodies to E30 and E37, gave a green fluorescence at the outer surface of intact chloroplasts. These experiments demonstrate that E10 and E24, and probably all the thermolysin-sensitive envelope polypeptides, are accessible from the cytosolic side of the outer membrane of the chloroplast envelope."
https://openalex.org/W1533468568,"The carboxyl-terminal decapeptide NH2-Leu-Leu-Arg-Arg-Gln-Val-Asn-Glu-Val-Ala-OH of the lactose carrier protein, the product of the lac Y gene of Escherichia coli, was synthesized, and specific anti-peptide antibodies were raised in rabbits. These antibodies bind to membrane-bound lactose carrier showing that the carboxyl terminus is accessible from the aqueous phase. The antibodies bind only to the surface of inverted cytoplasmic membrane vesicles (but not to closed, right-side-out membrane vesicles), demonstrating that the carboxyl terminus of the carrier protein is directed towards the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane in cells. The carboxyl terminus is a potent immunogenic epitope on the purified, detergent-solubilized carrier. Binding of peptide-specific antibodies to the carrier protein inhibits neither substrate binding nor translocation."

https://openalex.org/W1497588826,"One of the earliest responses to insulin in target cells is stimulation of the phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6. When exponentially growing 3T3-L1 cells are serum-starved, little phosphorylation of S6 is observed; however, following addition of insulin (10(-7) M), up to 5 phosphoryl groups are incorporated into S6. An enzyme mediating the insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of S6 has been identified as protease-activated kinase II. Two-dimensional peptide maps of tryptic digests of S6 from insulin-treated 3T3-L1 cells contain 5 phosphopeptides; the same 5 phosphopeptides are observed with tryptic digests of 40 S ribosomal subunits phosphorylated in vitro by protease-activated kinase II from rabbit reticulocytes. Protease-activated kinase II has also been identified and partially purified from the postribosomal supernatant of serum-starved and insulin-treated 3T3-L1 cells. The enzyme is present in the inactive proenzyme form in serum-starved cells; following insulin treatment, approximately 50% of the enzyme is in an activated form. Identical tryptic phosphopeptide maps are observed with these enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2093520735,"Thirty-one base substitution mutations within the yeast SUP4 tRNAtyr gene were used to probe the effects of different intragenic sequences on promoter activity. The various mutant plasmids were tested quantitatively for their in vitro template activity and for their ability to block competitively the transcription of a reference gene. Five mutations within the coding sequence of SUP4 decreased template activity for pre-tRNAtyr synthesis. The competition assays revealed 11 mutant genes that behaved differently than SUP4-o. Six were weaker competitors and five were stronger. The 12 mutations affecting template activity or competition are clustered in three regions: those encoding the dihydrouracil (D) arm, the extra loop, and the TΨ arm of the tRNA. All of the mutations that reduce competition involve base changes that decrease homology to a eucaryotic tRNA consensus sequence in the highly conserved D and TΨ regions. Three of the five up mutations increased homology to the tRNA consensus sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1549363335,"We have observed that the synthesis and secretion of apo-E, a component of plasma lipoproteins, are suppressed in mouse macrophages exposed to bacterial lipopolysaccharide endotoxin (LPS) in culture or in vivo. Control mouse macrophages contained intracellular immunofluorescent apo-E, and apo-E represented about 10% of secreted protein. After intraperitoneal injection of LPS, freshly lavaged macrophages neither contained intracellular apo-E nor secreted apo-E. The suppressive effects of LPS on apo-E synthesis in culture were selective, and secretion of many other major macrophage proteins was not affected. When the LPS-elicited macrophages were cultured for 24-72 h in the absence of LPS, synthesis of apo-E was initiated. Treatment of bone marrow-derived or peritoneal macrophages in culture with less than 1 ng of LPS/ml inhibited apo-E synthesis and secretion by 18 h of treatment. Although LPS stimulates prostaglandin E2 synthesis, prostaglandin E2 itself did not suppress apo-E synthesis. Macrophages from C3H/HeJ (Lpsd/Lpsd) mice, which are resistant to LPS, were neither primed for H2O2 production nor suppressed for apo-E synthesis in response to LPS in vivo (30 micrograms/mouse) or in culture (1 microgram/ml), whereas macrophages from the co-isogenic C3H/HeN (Lpsn/Lpsn) strain were induced for H2O2 secretion and had suppressed synthesis of apo-E. Because apo-E serves as a recognition determinant for the receptor-mediated clearance of lipoproteins, the decreased synthesis of apo-E after LPS treatment may in part explain the hyperlipoproteinemia associated with endotoxins in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1538814367,"An enzyme which removes tripeptides from the free, NH2-terminal end of oligopeptides has been detected in the extralysosomal fraction of rat liver. The enzyme was partially purified by Sepharose CL-4B and DEAE-cellulose chromatography. The pH optimum was in the neutral range and the apparent native molecular weight was above 10(6), as judged by the Sepharose chromatography. The enzyme cleaved the phosphopeptide Gly-Val-Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser(P)-Val-Ala (I), first at the Leu-Arg bond and then at the Ala-Ser(P) bond. The cleavage of the former bond was inhibited by Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser(P)-Val-Ala (II), which indicated that both bonds were cleaved by the same enzyme. Km for II was 0.01 mM at pH 6.5-7.5. Val-Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser(P)-Val-Ala (III) and Leu - Arg - Arg - Ala - Ser(P)-Val-Ala were poor substrates. III was, however, found to be an efficient inhibitor. The Ala-Ser(P) bond of Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser(P)-Val (IV) was cleaved at the same rate as that of II. The enzyme was active also with the unphosphorylated peptides corresponding to II and IV and tolerated the substitution of lysine for the NH2-terminal arginine of the latter peptide. Substitution of guanidovaleric acid for the NH2-terminal arginine of IV and of guanidovaleric acid or epsilon-amino-hexanoic acid for the NH2-terminal arginine of unphosphorylated IV reduced the rate of hydrolysis to insignificant levels, demonstrating the importance of a free NH2 terminus. The results provide evidence of a unique tripeptidyl aminopeptidase."
https://openalex.org/W1555244424,"The integral membrane protein responsible for the transport and phosphorylation of D-mannitol in Escherichia coli, the mannitol-specific Enzyme II of the phosphotransferase system (Mr = 60,000), has been purified to apparent homogeneity using a modification of a previously published procedure (Jacobson, G. R., Lee, C. A., and Saier, M. H., Jr. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 249-252). The purified enzyme was dependent on Lubrol PX and phospholipid for maximal activity. It catalyzed both the phosphoenolpyruvate- and the mannitol 1-phosphate-dependent phosphorylation of D-mannitol with high specificity for the accepting sugar and the phosphoryl donor. Both mannitol and mannitol 1-phosphate gave strong substrate inhibition at neutral pH in the transphosphorylation reaction catalyzed by the purified mannitol Enzyme II, while no substrate inhibition by mannitol was observed for the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent reaction. The purified enzyme did not catalyze hydrolysis of mannitol 1-phosphate, a product of both reactions. Antibody directed against the mannitol Enzyme II inhibited the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent activity to a greater extent than the transphosphorylation activity. Limited proteolysis with trypsin rapidly inactivated both purified and membrane-bound mannitol Enzyme II, and the purified protein was concomitantly cleaved into fragments with apparent molecular weights of about 29,000. These results show that although the mannitol Enzyme II is an integral membrane protein, a considerable portion of its polypeptide chain must also extend into a hydrophilic environment, presumably the cytoplasm."
https://openalex.org/W1520691767,"The subunit locations of the five enzymes associated with the fatty acid oxidation complex from Escherichia coli were studied by immunotitration and chemical modification. Antibodies raised against the purified complex caused the parallel inhibitions of enoyl-CoA hydratase and 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, while slightly stimulating 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase. All five component enzymes of the complex were inactivated by treatment with iodoacetamide. The inactivation of 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase was rapid, whereas the four other enzymes were inactivated at much slower, but almost equal rates. All enzymes except for 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase were protected against this inactivation by either NADH or crotonyl-CoA. The reaction of iodo[1-14C]acetamide with the complex in the presence and absence of NADH resulted in the differential labeling of the large subunit only. These observations together with published results (Pawar, S., and Schulz, H. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 3894-3899) lead to the suggestion that enoyl-CoA hydratase, 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, cis-delta 3-trans-delta 2-enoyl-CoA isomerase, and 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA epimerase are located on the 78,000-Da subunit, whereas 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase is associated with the 42,000-Da subunit. Additionally, this study provides further evidence for the existence of a fatty acid oxidation (fad AB) operon that codes for the multienzyme complex of fatty acid oxidation and that is located at 85 min on the E. coli chromosome."
https://openalex.org/W1495300376,"Exonuclease VIII is an enzyme whose synthesis is induced as a result of sbcA mutations. The enzyme has been purified to near homogeneity from an Escherichia coli strain containing an sbcA mutation and mutations in the structural genes for exonuclease III, exonuclease V, and endonuclease I. The enzyme specifically degrades linear duplex DNA in a reaction which requires magnesium ions and is susceptible to inhibition by other divalent cations and by sulfhydryl-blocking reagents. Enzyme activity occurs over a broad pH range with peak activity at pH 8.5 in Tris buffer. The protein has a subunit Mr = 140,000, a sedimentation coefficient of 8.4 +/- 0.6, and a Stokes radius of 142 +/- 6 A, which is consistent with its active form being a multimer. Exonuclease VIII has a frictional coefficient of 2.6 which indicates that it has an asymmetric structure."
https://openalex.org/W1588314853,"Purified mannitol Enzyme II from Escherichia coli was reconstituted in phospholipid vesicles employing the octylglucoside dilution procedure and was shown to catalyze vectorial mannitol 1-phosphate:mannitol transphosphorylation. Reconstitution of the enzyme into liposomes showed a marked dependency upon the octylglucoside concentration with an optimum at 1.2%. The reconstituted transphosphorylation activity exhibited an absolute dependence upon mannitol 1-phosphate as the phosphoryl donor, was sensitive to N-ethylmaleimide, and had a pH optimum near 6. The intravesicular radiolabeled mannitol phosphate could be released from the proteoliposomes by the addition of either 50 microM unlabeled mannitol or 0.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate. The rate of formation of intraliposomal mannitol phosphate, measured as a function of the mannitol Enzyme II concentration, showed a sigmoidal response, suggesting that at high enzyme concentrations the mannitol Enzyme II exists in an aggregated or oligomeric state and that this form is more active than the monomeric or dissociated form of the enzyme in catalyzing the vectorial mannitol transphosphorylation reaction."

https://openalex.org/W1579005896,"The cytochrome o terminal oxidase from Escherichia coli was immunochemically purified and monospecific antiserum toward cytochrome o was obtained. This antiserum is able to precipitate 100% of the ubiquinol-1 oxidase activity in Triton X-100 extracts of membranes from an E. coli strain in which cytochrome o is the only terminal oxidase. Cytochrome o was analyzed and quantitated using crossed immunoelectrophoresis, rocket immunoelectrophoresis, and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis shows that cytochrome o is composed of four subunits of approximate equimolar stoichiometry with molecular weights of 51,000, 28,500, 18,000, and 12,700. The low temperature (77 K) reduced - oxidized spectrum of the immunoprecipitate shows two peaks at 555 and 562 nm, indicating b-type cytochromes. With the anti-cytochrome o and antiserum toward the cytochrome d terminal oxidase complex which was previously obtained, it is possible to immunochemically assay for all the cytochromes in the cytoplasmic membrane of aerobically grown E. coli. Preliminary results indicate that the biosynthesis of cytochrome o is repressed when cytochrome d is induced by lowering the dissolved oxygen concentration during cell growth."
https://openalex.org/W1561144957,"Primary cultures of rat hepatocytes respond to hormones or amino acid deprivation by increasing System A-mediated neutral amino acid transport. Previous reports have shown this stimulation to be dependent on RNA and protein synthesis, whereas the present report describes the inhibition of System A by tunicamycin (TM), an inhibitor of asparagine-linked glycoprotein biosynthesis. The basal System A activity, as monitored by Na+-dependent 2-aminoisobutyric acid uptake, was decreased by TM when hepatocytes were cultured for 24 h in the presence of the antibiotic. System Gly activity was also sensitive to TM, whereas the activities of Systems L1, L2, and N were relatively resistant and that of System ASC was only moderately affected. The increase in System A-mediated uptake after incubation of hepatocytes in the absence of amino acids (i.e. adaptive control) was almost completely abolished by including TM. Likewise, stimulation of hepatic 2-aminoisobutyric acid transport by glucagon, dexamethasone, insulin, or vasopressin was also blocked by the inhibitor. When glucagon alone or glucagon plus dexamethasone was added, the inhibition by TM was transient such that the degree of inhibition decreased with incubation time after the initial 2 h. Addition of TM to cells which had been treated previously for 2 h to 4 h with glucagon and dexamethasone blocked any further increase in transport indicating that the glycoprotein component of System A must be continually synthesized to sustain the increase in activity. Treatment of hepatocytes with various lectins did not inhibit 2-aminoisobutyric acid transport."

https://openalex.org/W1580318413,"The structure of the leucine, isoleucine, valine-binding protein, an integral part of the high-affinity, branched-chain aliphatic amino acid transport system in Escherichia coli, has been solved at 3.0-A resolution by x-ray crystallography. Five isomorphous heavy atom derivatives, including anomalous differences from a samarium derivative, were used. A model of the polypeptide chain backbone reveals two distinct, globular domains connected by three strands. Each domain consists of a beta-sheet core flanked by at least two helices on either side. Difference Fourier analyses of crystals soaked in L-leucine, L-isoleucine, or L-valine have located a single amino acid-binding site in the cleft formed by the two domains. Despite the lack of significant sequence homology, the bilobate and secondary structure observed were similar to that found in the structures of L-arabinose- and D-galactose-binding proteins previously determined in our laboratory."
https://openalex.org/W1519811573,"We have previously shown that the processive synthesis of long DNA products on a poly(dA) X oligo(dT)10 primer-template is facilitated by formation of an isolable initiation complex between the Escherichia coli DNA polymerase III holoenzyme and DNA in the presence of ATP (Fay, P. J., Johanson, K. O., McHenry, C. S., and Bambara, R. A. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 5692-5699). Here we have demonstrated that the ATP requirement for processive synthesis can be obviated by a large excess of the beta subunit of the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme. The reaction which occurs in the presence of excess beta can be distinguished from the ATP-mediated reaction by its salt sensitivity and the lack of stabile initiation complex formation between polymerase and primed DNA. A model is presented which suggest that one of the functions of ATP in the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme reaction is to lock beta into the replicative complex such that it does not readily equilibrate with solution."
https://openalex.org/W1531424010,"Insulin receptor processing in human erythrocytes was investigated. Insulin binding to the cell surface was found to decrease by 70% in cells which had first been incubated with insulin for 3 h, then washed for 3 h. After an additional 16-h incubation without insulin, the level of cell surface insulin binding was restored to control values, even in the presence of cyclohexamide. Our results suggest that erythrocyte insulin receptors are internalized in response to insulin and that receptors are subsequently recycled to the surface of the cell."
https://openalex.org/W1573383902,"Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase is a flavoprotein which has recently been purified to homogeneity from pig liver (Daubner, S. C., and Matthews, R. G. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 140-145). The enzyme catalyzes the transfer of reducing equivalents from NADPH to menadione or methylenetetrahydrofolate, or from methyltetrahydrofolate to menadione. We have now examined the individual reductive and oxidative half-reactions comprising these activities, measuring the rate of flavin reduction or oxidation in an anaerobic stopped flow apparatus. In all cases, the individual half-reactions occur at rates which are sufficiently fast to account for catalytic turnover, indicating that the enzyme is kinetically competent to catalyze these oxidoreductions by Ping Pong Bi Bi mechanisms. NADPH-linked reduction of the flavin appears to be rate-limiting for the NADPH-menadione oxidoreductase reaction, while reoxidation of the flavin is partially rate-limiting in the NADPH-methylenetetrahydrofolate oxidoreductase reaction. Reduction of the flavin by methyltetrahydrofolate is rate-limiting in the methyltetrahydrofolate-menadione oxidoreductase reaction. No intermediates are seen in any of these half-reactions. In agreement with our postulate of ping-pong mechanisms for the catalytic reactions of the enzyme is our observation of exchange of radiolabel between [methyl-14C]methyltetrahydrofolate and [methylene-14C]methylenetetrahydrofolate in the absence of either menadione or pyridine nucleotides. The rate of exchange when both substrates are saturating is in good agreement with the rate of the methyltetrahydrofolate-menadione oxidoreductase reaction measured under Vmax conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2067173517,"From morphological characterization and intracellular recordings, monolayer cultures derived from fetal mouse hypothalami were found to include functionally differentiated peptide neurons, a number of which appear to contain vasopressin. These cells exhibited particular patterns of slow, calcium-dependent membrane depolarizations, resembling in their periodicity and duration the phasic activity of vasopressin neurons recorded extracellularly in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1554390666,"The interaction of calmodulin with its binding proteins on the adipocyte plasma membrane has previously been described (Goewert, R. R., Landt, M., and McDonald, J. M. (1982) Biochemistry 21, 5310-5315). In this paper we report that insulin directly affects specific calcium-dependent calmodulin binding to adipocyte plasma membranes. The direct effect of insulin on total calcium-dependent 125I-calmodulin binding was studied using 0.8 microM calmodulin. Insulin (100 microunits/ml) directly stimulated the binding of calmodulin by 19.6 +/- 2.3% (n = 6, p less than 0.001) at steady state, whereas the relatively inactive insulin analogue, desoctapeptide insulin, at equimolar concentrations had no effect. Analysis of Scatchard plots indicated that insulin increased the number of high affinity binding sites on the membrane without altering the affinity of these sites. The effect of insulin on the high affinity calmodulin binding was dependent upon increasing concentrations of insulin between 0 and 60 microunits/ml. A maximum stimulation of 75 +/- 17% (n = 4) of calcium-dependent calmodulin binding was observed at 40 microunits/ml of insulin. Effects of insulin were observed within 5 min of initiating 125I-calmodulin binding. These effects of insulin were most prominent above the K0.5 for calcium (approximately 2.0 microM). These direct effects of insulin on high affinity calmodulin binding suggest that the intracellular redistribution of calmodulin may play an important role in the early regulatory events directed by insulin on cellular metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1489495618,"The biosynthesis, segregation, and processing of preproinsulin (116 amino acids) was investigated to determine the mechanism(s) by which it is translocated across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Islet mRNA was translated in the wheat germ cell-free system, and at various times during preproinsulin synthesis, puromycin was added, followed by addition of microsomal membranes. Neither processing of preproinsulin nor translocation of proinsulin into microsomal membranes occurred in the presence of puromycin. Synchronization of preproinsulin translation by addition of 7-methylguanosine 5'-phosphate enabled the timing of preproinsulin synthesis and proinsulin (91 amino acids) segregation into microsomal membranes to be determined. Membrane binding occurs when about 60 amino acids have been polymerized, i.e. prior to the completion of the polypeptide chain. The binding of signal recognition particle to the nascent signal is demonstrated to be an absolute requirement for translocation and processing of preproinsulin. The results indicate that segregation and processing of preproinsulin are co-translational events; no evidence for a post-translational mechanism was found. Furthermore, this work, together with similar studies, suggests that presecretory polypeptides must be synthesized as part of a precursor with a minimum size of 60-80 amino acids in order to effect membrane binding and translocation of the polypeptide chain within the intracisternal space of the endoplasmic reticulum."
https://openalex.org/W1564329878,"Two Escherichia coli mutants lacking ribosomal protein L1, previously shown to display 40 to 60% reduced capacity for in vitro protein synthesis (Subramanian, A. R., and Dabbs, E. R. (1980) Eur. J. Biochem. 112, 425-430), have been used to study partial reactions of protein biosynthesis. Both the binding of N-acetyl-Phe-tRNA to ribosomes and the 6 to 8-fold stimulation of the elongation factor G (EF-G)-dependent GTPase reaction by mRNA plus tRNA, assayed in the presence of wild type 30 S subunits, were low with L1-deficient 50 S subunits. Addition of pure protein L1 to the assay restored both reactions to 100% of the control. By contrast, the basic EF-G GTPase reaction in the absence of mRNA and tRNA was not at all affected (mRNA alone had no effect). None of the following partial reactions were more than moderately modified by the lack of protein L1: binding to ribosomes of EF-G.GDP plus fusidic acid; the translocation reaction catalyzed by EF-G plus GTP; poly(U)-dependent binding to ribosomes of Phe-tRNAPhe (whether dependent on elongation factor Tu plus GTP or not); and the EF-Tu-dependent GTPase activity. It is concluded that protein L1 is involved in the interaction between ribosomes and peptidyl-tRNA (or tRNA) in the peptidyl site and consequently in the ribosomal GTPase activity depending on the simultaneous action of tRNA and EF-G."
https://openalex.org/W1637064058,"Dihydrofolate reductase specified by plasmid R483 from a trimethoprim-resistant strain of Escherichia coli has been purified 2,000-fold to homogeneity using dye-ligand chromatography, gel filtration, and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The protein migrated as a single band on nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and had a specific activity of 250 mumol/mg min(-1). The molecular weight was estimated to be 32,000 by gel filtration and 39,000 by Ferguson analysis of polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. When subjected to electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate, the protein migrated as a single 19,000-molecular weight species, a fact that suggests that the native enzyme is a dimer of similar or identical subunits. Antibody specific for R483-encoded dihydrofolate reductase did not cross-react with dihydrofolate reductase encoded by plasmid R67, T4 phage, E. coli RT500, or mouse L1210 leukemia cells. The amino acid sequence of the first 34 NH2-terminal residues suggests that the R483 plasmid dihydrofolate reductase is more closely related to the chromosomal dihydrofolate reductase than is the enzyme coded by plasmid R67."
https://openalex.org/W1495105083,"Using small angle x-ray scattering from solutions of colicin E3-immunity protein complex and the separated proteins, we have measured the radii of gyration of each species. We find that the complex is an elongated molecule with a radius of gyration of 35.5 +/- 0.7 A. Immunity protein is more compact with a radius of gyration of 13.4 +/- 0.1 A. Upon removal of immunity protein from the complex, colicin E3 (form minus immunity protein) undergoes further elongation and dimerizes, such that its radius of gyration increases to 75.6 +/- 3.1 A. Dimerization is not reversed by simple addition of a stoichiometric amount of immunity protein to the E3 solution, even though this is sufficient to block in vitro activity. We suggest that the elongation, and perhaps dimer formation, occurs in vivo, concomitant with membrane translocation."
https://openalex.org/W1513049873,"The sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase from Escherichia coli, an integral membrane protein whose activity is dependent on phospholipids, was purified to near homogeneity (Green, P. R., Merrill, A. H., Jr., and Bell, R. M., (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 11151-11159). Determination of a partial NH2-terminal sequence and the COOH terminus permitted alignment of the polypeptide on the sequenced sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase structural gene (Lightner, V. A., Bell, R. M., and Modrich, P. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 10856-10861). Processing of the sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase is apparently limited to the removal of the NH2-terminal formylmethionine. Thirteen of 27 possible cyanogen bromide peptides predicted from the DNA sequence were purified, characterized, and assigned to their location in the primary structure. Three peptides located at positions throughout the sequence were partially sequenced by automated Edman degradation. The partial sequence analysis of the homogeneous sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase is fully in accord with the primary structure inferred from the DNA sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1537822718,"Recognition of the termination codon by release factor was studied with 70 S ribosomes containing initiator tRNA at the P site and an amino acid-specifying codon as well as the corresponding cognate tRNA at the A site. In vitro termination was not excluded when either the A site was occupied with an amino acid-specifying codon or the termination codon was displaced from the A site codon position by spacer nucleotides between UAA and the P site bound AUG. The release factor may have flexibility in its codon recognizing domain to be able to adjust to this enforced change in the position of the termination codon on the ribosome without loss of functional specificity. Deacylated tRNA bound at the A site of 70 S ribosomes did not interfere with stoichiometric UAA-directed release factor binding to these particles. In contrast, a ternary complex (aminoacyl-tRNA elongation factor-Tu . GTP) abolished the binding of the release factor while aminoacyl-tRNA inhibited it only weakly. This suggests that release factor and elongation factor-Tu have overlapping binding sites but the A site binding domains of the release factor and tRNA are exclusive."
https://openalex.org/W1595285401,"Others have shown that the branched chain 2-keto acids are generated in muscle, released into the bloodstream, and then removed by the liver where further catabolism occurs. The present investigation describes the plasma membrane transport systems for these metabolites in cultured rat hepatocytes. One of these systems in Na+-dependent, concentrates the 2-keto acids against a gradient, and is inhibited by pyruvate. The second process is Na+-independent, is less concentrative, and may be composed of two distinct systems as suggested by pyruvate inhibition studies. None of these systems accept neutral amino acids. For the transport of 2-ketoisocaproate, the Na+-dependent system exhibits a Km value of about 5 mM, whereas the corresponding value for the Na+-independent agency is 60 microM. The activity of the Na+-dependent system is moderately increased by insulin treatment of the cells, while neither agency is stimulated by glucagon, dexamethasone, or the combination of these two hormones. Hepatocytes from diabetic rats show enhanced transport by the Na+-dependent system and incubation of cultured hepatocytes for 24 h in the absence of 2-keto acids results in a 3-fold stimulation of the Na+-dependent system, but has no effect on the rate of Na+-independent transport. These results demonstrate the existence of at least two saturable transport systems for the branched chain 2-keto acids in the rat hepatocyte and the ability of the Na+-dependent system to respond to the extracellular environment."
https://openalex.org/W1575522531,"A hybrid molecule was constructed by covalently linking, by a disulfide bridge, the hormone insulin to the binding subunit B of the plant toxin ricin (specificity: Gal, GalNAc). Monolayer-cultured MDCK cells, which lack detectable levels of specific plasma membrane 125I-insulin binding but which readily bind 125I-insulin-ricin B, were used in these studies. Binding of insulin-ricin B to these cells could be displaced by lactose and ricin B, but not by insulin. The biological activity of the hybrid, as measured by [14C]glucose incorporation into glycogen, was stimulated in a dose-dependent manner by the hybrid (10(-11)-10(-8) M), whereas glycogen production was not stimulated by insulin alone. The stimulated glycogen labeling in response to the hybrid was also inhibited by lactose and ricin B. When ricin B alone was tested over the same range of concentrations, stimulation of glycogen synthesis was not observed, nor was there any evidence for stimulation when insulin and ricin B were added simultaneously. These data suggested that alternate cell surface receptors (i.e. ricin B receptors) may substitute for specific receptors (i.e. insulin receptors) to convey intracellular metabolic control signals in this cell line."
https://openalex.org/W1607163004,"Small (30 S) ribosomal subunits from Escherichia coli strain TPR 201 were photoaffinity-labeled with [3H]puromycin in the presence of chloramphenicol under conditions in which more than 1 mol of antibiotic was incorporated per mol of ribosomes. The subunits were than washed with 3 M NH4Cl to yield core particles and a split protein fraction; the split proteins were further fractionated with ammonium sulfate. Subunits were then reconstituted using one fraction (core, split proteins, or ammonium sulfate supernatant) from photoaffinity-modified subunits and other components from unmodified (control) subunits. The distribution of [3H]puromycin in ribosomal proteins was monitored by one-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the sites of puromycin binding were visualized by immunoelectron microscopy. Two areas of puromycin binding were identified. A high affinity puromycin site, found on the upper third of the subunit and distant from the platform, is identical to the primary site previously identified (Olson, H. M., Grant, P. G., Glitz, D. G., and Cooperman, B. S. (1980) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 77, 890-894). Binding at this site is maximal in subunits reconstituted with high levels of puromycin-modified protein S14, and is decreased when unmodified S14 is incorporated. Because the percentage of antibody binding at the primary site always exceeds the percentage of puromycin label in protein S14, the primary site must include components other than S14. A secondary puromycin site of lower affinity is found on the subunit platform. This site is enriched in subunits reconstituted from puromycin-modified core particles and may include protein S7. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of localizing specifically modified components in reconstituted ribosomal subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1507295081,"Renin A from the submaxillary gland of male mice has been shown by a gas chromatography/mass spectrometry method to contain near stoichiometric amounts of a fatty acid mixture. The fatty acids on mouse renin were partially exchangeable with free tridecanoic acid in solution, with the tridecanoic acid truly exchanged and not just adsorbed in addition to the fatty acids already present. A gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis of the composition of the free fatty acids of the submaxillary gland of male mice showed that the mixture of fatty acids extracted from the gland was significantly different from the mixture of free fatty acids extracted from renin A. The renin-extracted fatty acids were relatively richer in saturated fatty acids, like myristic and palmitic acids, and poorer in polyunsaturated fatty acids, like linoleic and arachidonic acid, than the free fatty acids of the gland. The enzymatic activity of mouse renin was markedly stimulated by saturated fatty acids in 50 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.38, in a concentration-dependent, saturable manner. Palmitic acid stimulated renin activity versus synthetic tetradecapeptide renin substrate about 7-fold in this buffer, with half-maximal stimulation at 14 microM. Stearic and myristic acids also showed good stimulation but linoleic acid and ethyl myristate were much less effective at the stimulation. A possible physiological role for the loss of renin activity at acid pH due to loss of bound fatty acids would be to protect the mouse against internalized renin."

https://openalex.org/W1598007157,"The positional specificity in the aminoacylation of Escherichia coli tRNAGly by its cognate aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase has been studied using tRNAGlys terminating in 2'- or 3'-deoxyadenosine under conditions believed to alter tRNA conformation. Although E. coli tRNAGly terminating in 3'-deoxyadenosine has been reported not to be a good substrate for activation by the homologous glycyl-tRNA synthetase, by systematic variation of the conditions employed for aminoacylation it was possible to activate this tRNA to essentially the same extent as unmodified tRNAGly. Activation of tRNAGly terminating in 3'-deoxyadenosine was carried out optimally at 45 degrees C in an incubation mixture containing 0.3-0.4 M NaCl; 10% methanol, ethanol, and dimethyl sulfoxide were found to facilitate activation of the modified tRNA. Interestingly, the conditions employed to enhance activation of this modified tRNAGly had no effect on the activation of unmodified tRNAGly or tRNAGly terminating in 2'-deoxyadenosine. These experiments afford insight into the activation of tRNAGly by glycyl-tRNA synthetase and provide facile access to positionally defined, isomeric glycl-tRNAGlys."
