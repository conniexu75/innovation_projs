https://openalex.org/W2472255748,"Identifying the multiple dysregulated oncoproteins that contribute to tumorigenesis in a given patient is crucial for developing personalized treatment plans. However, accurate inference of aberrant protein activity in biological samples is still challenging as genetic alterations are only partially predictive and direct measurements of protein activity are generally not feasible. To address this problem we introduce and experimentally validate a new algorithm, virtual inference of protein activity by enriched regulon analysis (VIPER), for accurate assessment of protein activity from gene expression data. We used VIPER to evaluate the functional relevance of genetic alterations in regulatory proteins across all samples in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). In addition to accurately infer aberrant protein activity induced by established mutations, we also identified a fraction of tumors with aberrant activity of druggable oncoproteins despite a lack of mutations, and vice versa. In vitro assays confirmed that VIPER-inferred protein activity outperformed mutational analysis in predicting sensitivity to targeted inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2472346278,"Tau protein can transfer between neurons transneuronally and trans-synaptically, which is thought to explain the progressive spread of tauopathy observed in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease. Here we show that physiological tau released from donor cells can transfer to recipient cells via the medium, suggesting that at least one mechanism by which tau can transfer is via the extracellular space. Neuronal activity has been shown to regulate tau secretion, but its effect on tau pathology is unknown. Using optogenetic and chemogenetic approaches, we found that increased neuronal activity stimulates the release of tau in vitro and enhances tau pathology in vivo. These data have implications for disease pathogenesis and therapeutic strategies for Alzheimer's disease and other tauopathies."

https://openalex.org/W2472928215,"Different cortical areas are organized into distinct intracortical subnetworks. The manner in which descending pathways from the entire cortex interact subcortically as a network remains unclear. We developed an open-access comprehensive mesoscale mouse cortico-striatal projectome: a detailed connectivity projection map from the entire cerebral cortex to the dorsal striatum or caudoputamen (CP) in rodents. On the basis of these projections, we used new computational neuroanatomical tools to identify 29 distinct functional striatal domains. Furthermore, we characterized different cortico-striatal networks and how they reconfigure across the rostral-caudal extent of the CP. The workflow was also applied to select cortico-striatal connections in two different mouse models of disconnection syndromes to demonstrate its utility for characterizing circuitry-specific connectopathies. Together, our results provide the structural basis for studying the functional diversity of the dorsal striatum and disruptions of cortico-basal ganglia networks across a broad range of disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2426586472,"Genetic heterogeneity contributes to clinical outcome and progression of most tumors, but little is known about allelic diversity for epigenetic compartments, and almost no data exist for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We examined epigenetic heterogeneity as assessed by cytosine methylation within defined genomic loci with four CpGs (epialleles), somatic mutations, and transcriptomes of AML patient samples at serial time points. We observed that epigenetic allele burden is linked to inferior outcome and varies considerably during disease progression. Epigenetic and genetic allelic burden and patterning followed different patterns and kinetics during disease progression. We observed a subset of AMLs with high epiallele and low somatic mutation burden at diagnosis, a subset with high somatic mutation and lower epiallele burdens at diagnosis, and a subset with a mixed profile, suggesting distinct modes of tumor heterogeneity. Genes linked to promoter-associated epiallele shifts during tumor progression showed increased single-cell transcriptional variance and differential expression, suggesting functional impact on gene regulation. Thus, genetic and epigenetic heterogeneity can occur with distinct kinetics likely to affect the biological and clinical features of tumors."

https://openalex.org/W2470774921,"The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21(WAF1/CIP1) (p21) is a cell-cycle checkpoint effector and inducer of senescence, regulated by p53. Yet, evidence suggests that p21 could also be oncogenic, through a mechanism that has so far remained obscure. We report that a subset of atypical cancerous cells strongly expressing p21 showed proliferation features. This occurred predominantly in p53-mutant human cancers, suggesting p53-independent upregulation of p21 selectively in more aggressive tumour cells. Multifaceted phenotypic and genomic analyses of p21-inducible, p53-null, cancerous and near-normal cellular models showed that after an initial senescence-like phase, a subpopulation of p21-expressing proliferating cells emerged, featuring increased genomic instability, aggressiveness and chemoresistance. Mechanistically, sustained p21 accumulation inhibited mainly the CRL4-CDT2 ubiquitin ligase, leading to deregulated origin licensing and replication stress. Collectively, our data reveal the tumour-promoting ability of p21 through deregulation of DNA replication licensing machinery-an unorthodox role to be considered in cancer treatment, since p21 responds to various stimuli including some chemotherapy drugs."

https://openalex.org/W2466451751,"The present study demonstrates the plant growth promoting (PGP) potential of a bacterial isolate CDP-13 isolated from ‘Capparis decidua’ plant, and its ability to protect plants from the deleterious effect of biotic and abiotic stressors. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, the isolate was identified as Serratia marcescens. Among the PGP traits, the isolate was found to be positive for ACC deaminase activity, phosphate solubilization, production of siderophore, indole acetic acid production, nitrogen fixation, and ammonia production. CDP-13 showed growth at an increased salt (NaCl) concentration of up to 6%, indicating its potential to survive and associate with plants growing in saline soil. The inoculation of S. marcescens enhanced the growth of wheat plant under salinity stress (150–200 mM). It significantly reduced inhibition of plant growth (15 to 85%) caused by salt stressors. Application of CDP-13 also modulated concentration (20 to 75%) of different osmoprotectants (proline, malondialdehyde, total soluble sugar, total protein content, and indole acetic acid) in plants suggesting its role in enabling plants to tolerate salt stressors. In addition, bacterial inoculation also reduced the disease severity caused by fungal infection, which illustrated its ability to confer induced systemic resistance (ISR) in host plants. Treatment of wheat plants with the test organism caused alteration in anti-oxidative enzymes activities (Superoxide dismutase, Catalase, and Peroxidase) under various salinity levels, and therefore minimizes the salinity-induced oxidative damages to the plants. Colonization efficiency of strain CDP-13 was confirmed by CFU count, epi-fluorescence microscopy, and ERIC-PCR-based DNA fingerprinting approach. Hence, the study indicates that bacterium CDP-13 enhances plant growth, and has potential for the amelioration of salinity stress in wheat plants. Likewise, the results also provide insights into biotechnological approaches to using PGPR as an alternative to chemicals and pesticides."
https://openalex.org/W2432021507,"Theories of the formation and early evolution of planetary systems postulate that planets are born in circumstellar disks, and undergo radial migration during and after dissipation of the dust and gas disk from which they formed. The precise ages of meteorites indicate that planetesimals - the building blocks of planets - are produced within the first million years of a star's life. A prominent question is: how early can one find fully formed planets like those frequently detected on short orbital periods around mature stars? Some theories suggest the in situ formation of planets close to their host stars is unlikely and the existence of such planets is evidence for large scale migration. Other theories posit that planet assembly at small orbital separations may be common. Here we report on a newly-born, transiting planet orbiting its star every 5.4 days. The planet is 50 per cent larger than Neptune, and its mass is less than 3.6 times Jupiter (at 99.7 per cent confidence), with a true mass likely to be within a factor of several of Neptune's. The 5-10 million year old star has a tenuous dust disk extending outwards from about 2 times the Earth-Sun separation, in addition to the large planet located at less than one-twentieth the Earth-Sun separation."
https://openalex.org/W2460782022,"Hot Jupiters are giant Jupiter-like exoplanets that orbit their host stars 100 times more closely than Jupiter orbits the Sun. These planets presumably form in the outer part of the primordial disk from which both the central star and surrounding planets are born, then migrate inwards and yet avoid falling into their host star. It is, however, unclear whether this occurs early in the lives of hot Jupiters, when they are still embedded within protoplanetary disks, or later, once multiple planets are formed and interact. Although numerous hot Jupiters have been detected around mature Sun-like stars, their existence has not yet been firmly demonstrated for young stars, whose magnetic activity is so intense that it overshadows the radial velocity signal that close-in giant planets can induce. Here we report that the radial velocities of the young star V830 Tau exhibit a sine wave of period 4.93 days and semi-amplitude 75 metres per second, detected with a false-alarm probability of less than 0.03 per cent, after filtering out the magnetic activity plaguing the spectra. We find that this signal is unrelated to the 2.741-day rotation period of V830 Tau and we attribute it to the presence of a planet of mass 0.77 times that of Jupiter, orbiting at a distance of 0.057 astronomical units from the host star. Our result demonstrates that hot Jupiters can migrate inwards in less than two million years, probably as a result of planet–disk interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2470758117,"Tumours exist in a hypoxic microenvironment and must limit excessive oxygen consumption. Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) controls mitochondrial oxygen consumption, but how/if tumours regulate non-mitochondrial oxygen consumption (NMOC) is unknown. Protein-tyrosine phosphatase-1B (PTP1B) is required for Her2/Neu-driven breast cancer (BC) in mice, although the underlying mechanism and human relevance remain unclear. We found that PTP1B-deficient HER2(+) xenografts have increased hypoxia, necrosis and impaired growth. In vitro, PTP1B deficiency sensitizes HER2(+) BC lines to hypoxia by increasing NMOC by α-KG-dependent dioxygenases (α-KGDDs). The moyamoya disease gene product RNF213, an E3 ligase, is negatively regulated by PTP1B in HER2(+) BC cells. RNF213 knockdown reverses the effects of PTP1B deficiency on α-KGDDs, NMOC and hypoxia-induced death of HER2(+) BC cells, and partially restores tumorigenicity. We conclude that PTP1B acts via RNF213 to suppress α-KGDD activity and NMOC. This PTP1B/RNF213/α-KGDD pathway is critical for survival of HER2(+) BC, and possibly other malignancies, in the hypoxic tumour microenvironment."
https://openalex.org/W2462479233,"Background Cyanoacrylate(CA)-based tissue adhesives, although not widely used, are a feasible option to fix a mesh during abdominal hernia repair, due to its fast action and great bond strength. Their main disadvantage, toxicity, can be mitigated by increasing the length of their alkyl chain. The objective was to assess the in vitro cytotoxicity and in vivo biocompatibility in hernia repair of CAs currently used in clinical practice (Glubran(n-butyl) and Ifabond(n-hexyl)) and a longer-chain CA (OCA(n-octyl)), that has never been used in the medical field. Methods Formaldehyde release and cytotoxicity of unpolymerized(UCAs) and polymerized CAs(PCAs) were evaluated by macroscopic visual assessment, flow cytometry and Alamar Blue assays. In the preclinical evaluation, partial defects were created in the rabbit abdominal wall and repaired by fixing polypropylene prostheses using the CAs. At 14 days post-surgery, animals were euthanized for morphology, macrophage response and cell damage analyses. Results Formaldehyde release was lower as the molecular weight of the monomer increased. The longest side-chain CA(OCA) showed the highest cytotoxicity in the UCA condition. However, after polymerization, was the one that showed better behavior on most occasions. In vivo, all CAs promoted optimal mesh fixation without displacements or detachments. Seroma was evident with the use of Glubran, (four of six animals: 4/6) and Ifabond (2/6), but it was reduced with the use of OCA (1/6). Significantly greater macrophage responses were observed in groups where Glubran and Ifabond were used vs. sutures and OCA. TUNEL-positive cells were significantly higher in the Glubran and OCA groups vs. the suture group. Conclusions Although mild formaldehyde release occurred, OCA was the most cytotoxic during polymerization but the least once cured. The CAs promoted proper mesh fixation and have potential to replace traditional suturing techniques in hernia repair; the CAs exhibited good tissue integration and effective short-term biocompatibility, with the slightest seroma and macrophage response induced by OCA."
https://openalex.org/W2470709430,"The dysfunction and loss of synapses in Alzheimer disease are central to dementia symptoms. We have recently demonstrated that pathological Amyloid β oligomer (Aβo) regulates the association between intracellular protein mediators and the synaptic receptor complex composed of cellular prion protein (PrP(C)) and metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5). Here we sought to determine whether Aβo alters the physiological signaling of the PrP(C)-mGluR5 complex upon glutamate activation. We provide evidence that acute exposure to Aβo as well as chronic expression of familial Alzheimer disease mutant transgenes in model mice prevents protein-protein interaction changes of the complex induced by the glutamate analog 3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine. We further show that 3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine triggers the phosphorylation and activation of protein-tyrosine kinase 2-β (PTK2B, also referred to as Pyk2) and of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II in wild-type brain slices but not in Alzheimer disease transgenic brain slices or wild-type slices incubated with Aβo. This study further distinguishes two separate Aβo-dependent signaling cascades, one dependent on extracellular Ca(2+) and Fyn kinase activation and the other dependent on the release of Ca(2+) from intracellular stores. Thus, Aβo triggers multiple distinct PrP(C)-mGluR5-dependent events implicated in neurodegeneration and dementia. We propose that targeting the PrP(C)-mGluR5 complex will reverse aberrant Aβo-triggered states of the complex to allow physiological fluctuations of glutamate signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2516879309,"Canonical volume-regulated anion channels (VRACs) are crucial for cell volume regulation and have many other important roles, including tumor drug resistance and release of neurotransmitters. Although VRAC-mediated swelling-activated chloride currents (ICl,vol) have been studied for decades, exploration of the structure-function relationship of VRAC has become possible only after the recent discovery that VRACs are formed by differently composed heteromers of LRRC8 proteins. Inactivation of ICl,vol at positive potentials, a typical hallmark of VRACs, strongly varies between native cell types. Exploiting the large differences in inactivation between different LRRC8 heteromers, we now used chimeras assembled from isoforms LRRC8C and LRRC8E to uncover a highly conserved extracellular region preceding the second LRRC8 transmembrane domain as a major determinant of ICl,vol inactivation. Point mutations identified two amino acids (Lys-98 and Asp-100 in LRRC8A and equivalent residues in LRRC8C and -E), which upon charge reversal strongly altered the kinetics and voltage dependence of inactivation. Importantly, charge reversal at the first position also reduced the iodide > chloride permeability of ICl,vol. This change in selectivity was stronger when both the obligatory LRRC8A subunit and the other co-expressed isoform (LRR8C or -E) carried such mutations. Hence, the C-terminal part of the first extracellular loop not only determines VRAC inactivation but might also participate in forming its outer pore. Inactivation of VRACs may involve a closure of the extracellular mouth of the permeation pathway."

Reduction of ER stress by treatment with chemical chaperones or overexpression of ER chaperone proteins alleviates hepatic steatosis. Nonetheless, X-box binding protein 1s (XBP1s), a key transcription factor that reduces ER stress, has been proposed as a lipogenic transcription factor. In this report, we document that XBP1s leads to suppression of lipogenic gene expression and reduction of hepatic triglyceride and diacylglycerol content in livers of diet-induced obese and genetically obese and insulin-resistant ob/ob mice. Furthermore, we also show that PKCϵ activity, which correlates with fatty liver and which causes insulin resistance, was significantly reduced in diet-induced obese mice. Finally, we have shown that XBP1s reduces the hepatic fatty acid synthesis rate and enhances macrolipophagy, an initiating step in lipolysis. Our results reveal that XBP1s reduces hepatic lipogenic gene expression and improves hepatosteatosis in mouse models of obesity and insulin resistance, which leads us to conclude that XBP1s has anti-lipogenic properties in the liver.

https://openalex.org/W2467301324,"Symbiotic bacteria can have important implications in the development and competence of disease vectors. In Anopheles mosquitoes, the composition of the midgut microbiota is largely influenced by the larval breeding site, but the exact factors shaping this composition are currently unknown. Here, we examined whether the proximity to urban areas and seasons have an impact on the midgut microbial community of the two major malaria vectors in Africa, An. coluzzii and An. gambiae. Larvae and pupae were collected from selected habitats in two districts of Ghana during the dry and rainy season periods. The midgut microbiota of adults that emerged from these collections was determined by 454-pyrosequencing of the 16S ribosomal DNA. We show that in both mosquito species, Shewanellaceae constituted on average of 54% and 73% of the midgut microbiota from each site in the dry and rainy season, respectively. Enterobacteriaceae was found in comparatively low abundance below 1% in 22/30 samples in the dry season, and in 25/38 samples in the rainy season. Our data indicate that seasonality and locality significantly affect both the diversity of microbiota and the relative abundance of bacterial families with a positive impact of dry season and peri-urban settings."
https://openalex.org/W2461499116,"Brassinosteroids (BRs) hormones are important for plant growth, development and immune responses. They are sensed by the transmembrane receptor kinase Brassinosteroid-Insensitive 1 (BRI1) when they bind to its extracellular Leu-rich repeat (LRR) domain. We cloned and characterized the TaBRI1 from T. aestivum and raised overexpression transgenics in Arabidopsis to decipher its functional role. TaBRI1 protein consists of a putative signal peptide followed by 25 leucine rich repeats (LRR), a transmembrane domain and a C-terminal kinase domain. The analysis determined the interaction of TaBRI1 with five members of the wheat Somatic Embryogenesis Receptor Kinase (TaSERKs) gene family (TaSERK1, TaSERK2, TaSERK3, TaSERK4 and TaSERK5), at the plasma membrane. Furthermore, overexpression of TaBRI1 in Arabidopsis leads to the early flowering, increased silique size and seed yield. Root growth analysis of TaBRI1 overexpressing transgenic plants showed hypersensitivity to epi-brassinolide (epi-BL) hormone in a dose-dependent manner. Interestingly, transgenic Arabidopsis plants show thermotolerance phenotype at the seedling stages as revealed by chlorophyll content, photosystem II activity and membrane stability. The transcriptome profiling on the basis of microarray analysis indicates up-regulation of several genes related to brassinosteroid signaling pathway, abiotic stress response, defense response and transcription factors. These studies predict the possible role of TaBRI1 gene in plant growth and development imparting tolerance to thermal stress."
https://openalex.org/W2472891864,"GPR142, a putative amino acid receptor, is expressed in pancreatic islets and the gastrointestinal tract, but the ligand affinity and physiological role of this receptor remain obscure. In this study, we show that in addition to L-Tryptophan, GPR142 signaling is also activated by L-Phenylalanine but not by other naturally occurring amino acids. Furthermore, we show that Tryptophan and a synthetic GPR142 agonist increase insulin and incretin hormones and improve glucose disposal in mice in a GPR142-dependent manner. In contrast, Phenylalanine improves in vivo glucose disposal independently of GPR142. Noteworthy, refeeding-induced elevations in insulin and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide are blunted in Gpr142 null mice. In conclusion, these findings demonstrate GPR142 is a Tryptophan receptor critically required for insulin and incretin hormone regulation and suggest GPR142 agonists may be effective therapies that leverage amino acid sensing pathways for the treatment of type 2 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2461655143,"The behavior of a water-based nanofluid containing motile gyrotactic micro-organisms passing an isothermal nonlinear stretching sheet in the presence of a non-uniform magnetic field is studied numerically. The governing partial differential equations including continuity, momentums, energy, concentration of the nanoparticles, and density of motile micro-organisms are converted into a system of the ordinary differential equations via a set of similarity transformations. New set of equations are discretized using the finite difference method and have been linearized by employing the Newton's linearization technique. The tri-diagonal system of algebraic equations from discretization is solved using the well-known Thomas algorithm. The numerical results for profiles of velocity, temperature, nanoparticles concentration and density of motile micro-organisms as well as the local skin friction coefficient Cfx, the local Nusselt number Nux, the local Sherwood number Shx and the local density number of the motile microorganism Nnx are expressed graphically and described in detail. This investigation shows the density number of the motile micro-organisms enhances with rise of M, Gr/Re2, Pe and Ω but it decreases with augment of Rb and n. Also, Sherwood number augments with an increase of M and Gr/Re2, while decreases with n, Rb, Nb and Nr. To show the validity of the current results, a comparison between the present results and the existing literature has been carried out."
https://openalex.org/W2475074479,"In the present investigation we analyze the impact of magnetic field on the stagnation-point flow of a generalized Newtonian Carreau fluid. The convective surface boundary conditions are considered to investigate the thermal boundary layer. The leading partial differential equations of the current problem are altered to a set of ordinary differential equations by picking local similarity transformations. The developed non-linear ordinary differential equations are then numerically integrated via Runge-Kutta Fehlberg method after changing into initial value problems. This investigation explores that the momentum and thermal boundary layers are significantly influenced by various pertinent parameters like the Hartmann number M, velocity shear ratio parameter α, Weissenberg number We, power law index n, Biot number γ and Prandtl number Pr. The analysis further reveals that the fluid velocity as well as the skin friction is raised by the velocity shear ratio parameter. Moreover, strong values of the Hartmann number correspond to thinning of the momentum boundary layer thickness while quite the opposite is true for the thermal boundary layer thickness. Additionally, it is seen that the numerical computations are in splendid consent with previously reported studies."
https://openalex.org/W2471353688,"A crucial yet ill-defined step during the development of tubular networks, such as the vasculature, is the formation of connections (anastomoses) between pre-existing lumenized tubes. By studying tracheal tube anastomosis in Drosophila melanogaster, we uncovered a key role of secretory lysosome-related organelle (LRO) trafficking in lumen fusion. We identified the conserved calcium-binding protein Unc-13-4/Staccato (Stac) and the GTPase Rab39 as critical regulators of this process. Stac and Rab39 accumulate on dynamic vesicles, which form exclusively in fusion tip cells, move in a dynein-dependent manner, and contain late-endosomal, lysosomal, and SNARE components characteristic of LROs. The GTPase Arl3 is necessary and sufficient for Stac LRO formation and promotes Stac-dependent intracellular fusion of juxtaposed apical plasma membranes, thereby forming a transcellular lumen. Concomitantly, calcium is released locally from ER exit sites and apical membrane-associated calcium increases. We propose that calcium-dependent focused activation of LRO exocytosis restricts lumen fusion to appropriate domains within tip cells."
https://openalex.org/W2460247501,"Previous studies have shown that the negative effects of density of Ae. albopictus on Ae. aegypti exceed those of Ae. aegypti on Ae. albopictus for population growth, adult size, survivorship, and developmental rate. This competitive superiority has been invoked to explain the displacement of Ae. aegypti by Ae. albopictus in the southeastern USA. In Brazil, these species coexist in many vegetated suburban and rural areas. We investigated a related, but less-well-studied question: do effects of Ae. albopictus on Ae. aegypti larval development and survival occur under field conditions at realistic densities across multiple seasons in Brazil? We conducted additive competition experiments in a vegetated area of Rio de Janeiro where these species coexist. We tested the hypothesis that Ae. aegypti (the focal species, at a fixed density) suffers negative effects on development and survivorship across a gradient of increasing densities of Ae. albopictus (the associate species) in three seasons. The results showed statistically significant effects of both season and larval density on Ae. aegypti survivorship, and significant effects of season on development rate, with no significant season-density interactions. Densities of Aedes larvae in these habitats differed among seasons by a factor of up to 7x. Overall, Spring was the most favorable season for Ae. aegypti survivorship and development. Results showed that under natural conditions the negative competitive effects of Ae. albopictus on Ae. aegypti were expressed primarily as lower survivorship. Coexistence between Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus in vegetated areas is likely affected by seasonal environmental differences, such as detrital resource levels or egg desiccation, which can influence competition between these species. Interactions between these Aedes are important in Brazil, where both species are well established and widely distributed and vector dengue, Zika and chikungunya viruses."

The OSM-specific receptor, OSM receptor β (OSMR), is expressed in adipocytes, but its function remains largely unknown. To better understand the effects of OSM in adipose tissue, we knocked down Osmr expression in adipocytes in vitro using siRNA. In vivo, we generated a mouse line lacking Osmr in adiponectin-expressing cells (OSMRFKO mice). The effects of OSM on gene expression were also assessed in vitro and in vivo. OSM exerts proinflammatory effects on cultured adipocytes that are partially rescued by Osmr knockdown. Osm expression is significantly increased in adipose tissue T cells of high fat-fed mice.

Elevated OSM levels have been observed in a variety of inflammatory diseases in humans, including rheumatoid arthritis and atherosclerosis (11Hui W. Bell M. Carroll G.

Unlike other gp130 cytokines, OSM has its own specific receptor subunit (OSM receptor β; hereafter referred to as OSMR) that heterodimerizes with gp130 to create the functional OSM receptor complex, and this complex is responsible for the majority of OSM effects (19Mosley B.

Invest. 2011; 91: 1107-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The majority of studies support a role for OSM in promoting metabolic dysfunction. For example, it is well documented that OSM inhibits adipogenesis (23Miyaoka Y. Tanaka M. Naiki T. Miyajima A. Oncostatin M inhibits adipogenesis through the RAS/ERK and STAT5 signaling pathways.J.

In addition, OSM induces plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) expression in murine adipocytes (22Sanchez-Infantes D. White U.A. Elks C.M. Morrison R.F. Gimble J.M. Considine R.V. Ferrante A.W. Ravussin E. Stephens J.M. Oncostatin M is produced in adipose tissue and is regulated in conditions of obesity and type 2 diabetes.J Clin. Endocrinol.

Maurer G. Huber K. Wojta J. Inflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 and oncostatin M induce plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 in human adipose tissue.Circulation. 2005; 111: 1938-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). PAI-1 is a known player in metabolic dysfunction (26Alessi M.-C. Poggi M. Juhan-Vague I. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, adipose tissue and insulin resistance.Curr. Opin.

Physiol. 2012; 227: 493-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Despite a large number of studies showing associations among OSM, inflammation, and metabolic dysfunction, three recent reports from the same group have suggested that OSM is a potential agent for obesity treatment (21Komori T. Tanaka M. Senba E. Miyajima A. Morikawa Y. Deficiency of oncostatin M receptor β (OSMRβ) exacerbates high-fat diet-induced obesity and related metabolic disorders in mice.J. Biol.

Tanaka M. Senba E. Miyajima A. Morikawa Y. Lack of Oncostatin M receptor β leads to adipose tissue inflammation and insulin resistance by switching macrophage phenotype.J. Biol.

Hence, there is currently a great deal of confounding data on the role of OSM in obesity and metabolic disease states. We have generated a mouse model, the adipocyte-specific Osmr knock-out mouse (OSMRFKO), in an attempt to clarify the function of AT OSM. To our surprise, the loss of adipocyte OSM signaling in vivo was associated with inflammation and insulin resistance. The interpretation of these results is complicated by elevated AT OSM expression in the OSMRFKO mice. Nonetheless, these results suggest that intact adipocyte OSM signaling plays a role in the maintenance of AT homeostasis. To understand the function of OSM on adipocytes, we examined the expression of several adipokines in 3T3-L1 adipocytes following OSM exposure for the times indicated in Fig. 1. The expression levels of genes associated with insulin resistance and inflammation (Pai1, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1 (Timp1), monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (Mcp1), insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3 (Igfbp3), and osteopontin/secreted phosphoprotein 1 (Spp1)), and interestingly, expression of genes encoding the two subunits of the murine OSM receptor signaling complex (gp130 and Osmr) were all strongly and significantly induced by OSM treatment (Fig. 1, A and B, respectively). These results demonstrate that OSM can induce the expression of its own receptor subunits as well as that of several proinflammatory adipokines in cultured adipocytes. To further assess OSM signaling and the role of OSMR, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were transiently transfected with siOsmr or non-targeted siRNA. Next, adipocytes were treated with OSM or vehicle for 3–4 h, and the expression levels of OSM-responsive genes were examined. We obtained significant knockdown (>60%) of Osmr mRNA using this gene silencing method (Fig. 2A). Adipocytes transfected with siOsmr exhibited decreased OSMR expression along with decreased OSMR signaling as indicated by decreased phosphorylation of the OSM-induced transcription factor STAT5 (Fig. 2B). The ability of OSM to induce the expression of the proinflammatory adipokines Timp1, Mcp1, and Il6 was attenuated in Osmr knockdown adipocytes (Fig. 2C). As expected, expression levels of both gp130 and Osmr were significantly decreased in Osmr knockdown cells exposed to OSM. However, no significant changes in expression of IL-6 receptor α (Il6ra) or leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (Lifr), two other gp130 family receptors, were observed (Fig. 2D). These results suggest that 1) OSM can directly induce expression of proinflammatory adipokines in adipocytes via the OSMR signaling complex and 2) intact OSMR signaling is required in part for transcriptional regulation of both OSMR subunits. We previously demonstrated in subcutaneous AT from obese humans that the high levels of OSM originated from SVF cells and that OSM was not expressed in human adipocytes (22Sanchez-Infantes D. White U.A. Elks C.M. Morrison R.F. Gimble J.M. Considine R.V. Ferrante A.W. Ravussin E. Stephens J.M. Oncostatin M is produced in adipose tissue and is regulated in conditions of obesity and type 2 diabetes.J Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2014; 99: E217-E225Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In ob/ob mice, we previously observed that Osm expression in AT was readily detectable in macrophages (22Sanchez-Infantes D. White U.A. Elks C.M. Morrison R.F. Gimble J.M. Considine R.V. Ferrante A.W. Ravussin E. Stephens J.M. Oncostatin M is produced in adipose tissue and is regulated in conditions of obesity and type 2 diabetes.J Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2014; 99: E217-E225Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We extended our previous findings by examining the expression of Osm and Osmr in epididymal AT cell types (adipocytes, T cells, and B cells) from C57BL/6J (B6) mice fed low fat diet (LFD) or high fat diet (HFD) for 18 weeks. Compared with LFD-fed mice, HFD-fed mice exhibited a significant increase in T cell Osm levels (Fig. 3A), suggesting that some of the increased AT OSM in obesity is derived from T cells. Increased Osm expression is also observed in adipocytes from HFD-fed mice, which may be due to the presence of lipid-laden macrophages in the adipocyte fraction because adipocytes do not express Osm. Lastly, Osmr expression is increased in adipocytes of HFD-fed mice, although this increase is not significant (Fig. 3B). To delete Osmr in adipocytes, we obtained mice from The Jackson Laboratory where exon 2 (first coding exon) of the Osmr gene was flanked by loxP sites (floxed; OSMRfl/fl). Floxed mice were crossed with mice expressing Cre recombinase under control of the adiponectin (Adipoq) gene promoter (30Eguchi J. Wang X. Yu S. Kershaw E.E. Chiu P.C. Dushay J. Estall J.L. Klein U. Maratos-Flier E. Rosen E.D. Transcriptional control of adipose lipid handling by IRF4.Cell Metab. 2011; 13: 249-259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). OSMRFKO mice exhibited decreased Osmr expression in whole AT, but no changes in gene expression in other tissues, including liver and spleen, were observed (Fig. 4A). Decreased Osmr gene expression was restricted to adipocytes and not SVF cells (Fig. 4B). Decreased OSMR protein expression in the adipocyte fraction from OSMRFKO AT is shown in Fig. 4C. After verification of knock-out specificity, OSMRFKO and floxed control mice were fed HFD for 24 weeks. Although body weights for OSMRFKO mice were slightly higher starting at week 4 on HFD, the trend did not reach significance until ∼12 weeks of HFD feeding (Fig. 4D). The increased body weight of OSMRFKO mice was mainly attributed to increased lean mass as no significant differences in fat mass were observed between the groups (Fig. 4E). Interestingly, significant differences in lean mass of OSMRFKO mice were observed starting around 8 weeks of HFD feeding prior to the slight divergence in body weight (Fig. 4E). This difference in lean mass could possibly be attributed to increased bone mass as the mean nasoanal length of the OSMRFKO mice was significantly greater than that of the control mice at the end of the study (10.9 ± 0.075 versus 10.5 ± 0.053 cm, respectively; p = 0.0043). After 24 weeks of HFD, OSMRFKO mice had higher serum insulin (Fig. 5A), lower serum total adiponectin levels (Fig. 5B), and blunted responses to an insulin bolus during an insulin tolerance test (Fig. 5C), suggesting impaired insulin-stimulated whole-body glucose handling in these mice. A trend toward impaired glucose disposal capacity was also observed during a glucose tolerance test, although the trend was not significant (Fig. 5D). Histological assessment of epididymal AT in obese OSMRFKO and control mice revealed an apparent increase in the presence of crownlike structures (Fig. 6A), a hallmark of AT inflammation. However, no changes in mean adipocyte area or size were observed between OSMRFKO and control mice (Fig. 6, B and C, respectively). In further support of an elevated inflammatory response in OSMRFKO mice, significant increases in the expression of macrophage markers (F4/80 and Cd11c) and T cell markers (Cd4 and Cd8) were observed as well as a trend toward increased expression of several proinflammatory cytokines (including Osm, tumor necrosis factor α (Tnfa), and Il6) (Fig. 7A). Of note, differential expression of extracellular matrix-associated genes was observed in OSMRFKO mice, including significant increases in expression of Timp1, fibronectin 1 (Fn1), and transforming growth factor β2 (Tgfb2). However, there were no substantial changes in the expression of collagens or most matrix metalloproteinases (Mmps; Fig. 7B). Interestingly, the most striking changes in gene expression were observed in Mmp7 and E-cadherin (Cdh1), two genes not normally considered to have major roles in AT (Fig. 7B).FIGURE 7.OSMRFKO mice exhibit increased inflammatory marker expression and altered expression of extracellular matrix-related genes in epididymal AT.

Similar results were found upon histological evaluation of liver sections (Fig. 8B). A significant increase in femoral length (Fig. 8C) was identified in OSMRFKO mice. Trabecular bone within the distal femur was also increased (Fig. 8D); however, this change was not significantly different (p = 0.058). This change in bone volume density appears to be related to an overall increase (p = 0.050) in trabecular number in the OSMRFKO mice. In addition, trabecular bone structure model index was significantly different where the OSMRFKO mice had significantly more platelike trabeculae (p = 0.021). In this study, we assessed the direct effects of OSM on adipocytes in vitro and characterized the phenotype of a mouse that lacked OSMR in adiponectin-expressing cells (OSMRFKO mouse). We used our newly generated mouse model to assess the role of adipocyte OSMR in AT homeostasis and metabolic health. Our results demonstrate that OSM treatment of cultured adipocytes leads to a sustained increase in the expression of several proinflammatory adipokines associated with insulin resistance (Timp1, Mcp1, Pai1, Igfbp3, and Spp1). These observations are consistent with other studies that have shown elevated Mcp1and Pai1 expression with OSM treatment in other cell types, including fibroblasts and hepatic cells (31Schnittker D.

https://openalex.org/W2442011120,"T helper type 17 (Th17) lymphocytes, characterized by the production of interleukin-17 and other pro-inflammatory cytokines, are present in intestinal lamina propria and have been described as important players driving intestinal inflammation. Recent evidence, supporting the notion of a functional and phenotypic instability of Th17 cells, has shown that Th17 differentiate into type 1 regulatory (Tr1) T cells during the resolution of intestinal inflammation. Moreover, it has been suggested that the expression of CD39 ectonucleotidase endows Th17 cells with immunosuppressive properties. However, the exact role of CD39 ectonucleotidase in Th17 cells has not been studied in the context of intestinal inflammation. Here we show that Th17 cells expressing CD39 ectonucleotidase can hydrolyze ATP and survive to ATP-induced cell death. Moreover, in vitro-generated Th17 cells expressing the CD39 ectonucleotidase produce IL-10 and are less pathogenic than CD39 negative Th17 cells in a model of experimental colitis in Rag-/- mice. Remarkably, we show that CD39 activity regulates the conversion of Th17 cells to IL-10-producing cells in vitro, which is abrogated in the presence of ATP and the CD39-specific inhibitor ARL67156. All these data suggest that CD39 expression by Th17 cells allows the depletion of ATP and is crucial for IL-10 production and survival during the resolution of intestinal inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2460719055,"Plants expressing Cry proteins from the bacterium, Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), have become a major tactic for controlling insect pests in maize and cotton globally. However, there are few Bt vegetable crops. Eggplant (Solanum melongena) is a popular vegetable grown throughout Asia that is heavily treated with insecticides to control the eggplant fruit and shoot borer, Leucinodes orbonalis (EFSB). Herein we provide the first publicly available data on field performance in Asia of eggplant engineered to produce the Cry1Ac protein. Replicated field trials with five Bt eggplant open-pollinated (OP) lines from transformation event EE-1 and their non-Bt comparators were conducted over three cropping seasons in the Philippines from 2010–2012. Field trials documented levels of Cry1Ac protein expressed in plants and evaluated their efficacy against the primary target pest, EFSB. Cry1Ac concentrations ranged from 0.75–24.7 ppm dry weight with the highest in the terminal leaves (or shoots) and the lowest in the roots. Cry1Ac levels significantly increased from the vegetative to the reproductive stage. Bt eggplant lines demonstrated excellent control of EFSB. Pairwise analysis of means detected highly significant differences between Bt eggplant lines and their non-Bt comparators for all field efficacy parameters tested. Bt eggplant lines demonstrated high levels of control of EFSB shoot damage (98.6–100%) and fruit damage (98.1–99.7%) and reduced EFSB larval infestation (95.8–99.3%) under the most severe pest pressure during trial 2. Moths that emerged from larvae collected from Bt plants in the field and reared in their Bt eggplant hosts did not produce viable eggs or offspring. These results demonstrate that Bt eggplant lines containing Cry1Ac event EE-1 provide outstanding control of EFSB and can dramatically reduce the need for conventional insecticides."
https://openalex.org/W2467548595,"Lung adenocarcinoma, the most commonly diagnosed type of lung cancer, has a poor prognosis even with combined surgery, chemotherapy, or molecular targeted therapies. Most patients are diagnosed with an in-operable advanced or metastatic disease, both pointing to the necessity of developing effective therapies for lung adenocarcinoma. Surfactant protein B (SP-B) has been found to be overexpressed in lung adenocarcinoma. In addition, it has also been demonstrated that human lung adenocarcinoma cells are susceptible to the JC polyomavirus (JCPyV) infection. Therefore, we designed that the JCPyV virus-like particle (VLP) packaged with an SP-B promoter-driven thymidine kinase suicide gene (pSPB-tk) for possible gene therapy of human lung adenocarcinoma. Plasmids expressing the GFP (pSPB-gfp) or thymidine kinase gene (pSPB-tk) under the control of the human SP-B promoter were constructed. The promoter's tissue specificity was tested by transfection of pSPB-gfp into A549, CH27, and H460 human lung carcinoma cells and non-lung cells. The JCPyV VLP's gene transfer efficiency and the selective cytotoxicity of pSPB-tk combined with ganciclovir (GCV) were tested in vitro and in a xenograft mouse model. In the current study, we found that SP-B promoter-driven GFP was specifically expressed in human lung adenocarcinoma (A549) and large cell carcinoma (H460) cells. JCPyV VLPs were able to deliver a GFP reporter gene into A549 cells for expression. Selective cytotoxicity was observed in A549 but not non-lung cells that were transfected with pSPB-tk or infected with pSPB-tk-carrying JCPyV VLPs. In mice injected with pSPB-tk-carrying JCPyV VLPs through the tail vein and treated with ganciclovir (GCV), a potent 80% inhibition of growth of human lung adenocarcinoma nodules resulted. The JCPyV VLPs combined with the use of SP-B promoter demonstrates effectiveness as a potential gene therapy against human lung adenocarcinoma."

Methods A total of forty-two patients with inoperable stages III–IV lung cancer underwent 18F-FETNIM PET/CT (n = 18) and 18F-FMISO PET/CT (n = 24) before chemo/radiation therapy. The standard uptake values (SUVs) of malignant and normal tissues depict 18F-FETNIM PET/CT and 18F-FMISO PET/CT uptake. Tumor-to-blood ratios (T/B) were used to quantify hypoxia. Results All patients with lung cancer underwent 18F-FETNIM PET/CT and 18F-FMISO PET/CT successfully. Compared to 18F-FMISO, 18F-FETNIM showed similar uptake in muscle, thyroid, spleen, pancreas, heart, lung and different uptake in blood, liver, and kidney. Significantly higher SUV and T/B ratio with 18F-FMISO (2.56±0.77, 1.98±0.54), as compared to 18F-FETNIM (2.12±0.56, 1.42±0.33) were seen in tumor, P = 0.022, <0.001. For the patients with different histopathological subtypes, no significant difference of SUV (or T/B ratio) was observed both in 18F-FMISO and 18F-FETNIM in tumor. A significantly different SUV (or T/B ratio) was detected between < = 2cm, 2~5cm, and >5cm groups in 18F-FMISO PET/CT, P = 0.015 (or P = 0.029), whereas no difference was detected in 18F-FMISO PET/CT, P = 0.446 (or P = 0.707). Both 18F-FETNIM and 18F-FMISO showed significantly higher SUVs (or T/B ratios) in stage IV than stage III, P = 0.021, 0.013 (or P = 0.032, 0.02). Conclusion 18F-FMISO showed significantly higher uptake than 18F-FETNIM in tumor/non-tumor ratio and might be a better hypoxia tracer in lung cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2464441567,"Sonophoresis can increase skin permeability to various drugs in transdermal drug delivery. Cavitation is recognized as the predominant mechanism of sonophoresis. Recently, a new logical approach to enhance the efficiency of transdermal drug delivery was tried. It is to utilize the engineered microbubble and its resonant frequency for increase of cavitation activity. Actively-induced cavitation with low-intensity ultrasound (less than ~1 MPa) causes disordering of the lipid bilayers and the formation of aqueous channels by stable cavitation which indicates a continuous oscillation of bubbles. Furthermore, the mutual interactions of microbubble determined by concentration of added bubble are also thought to be an important factor for activity of stable cavitation, even in different characteristics of drug. In the present study, we addressed the dependence of ultrasound contrast agent concentration using two types of drug on the efficiency of transdermal drug delivery. Two types of experiment were designed to quantitatively evaluate the efficiency of transdermal drug delivery according to ultrasound contrast agent concentration. First, an experiment of optical clearing using a tissue optical clearing agent was designed to assess the efficiency of sonophoresis with ultrasound contrast agents. Second, a Franz diffusion cell with ferulic acid was used to quantitatively determine the amount of drug delivered to the skin sample by sonophoresis with ultrasound contrast agents. The maximum enhancement ratio of sonophoresis with a concentration of 1:1,000 was approximately 3.1 times greater than that in the ultrasound group without ultrasound contrast agent and approximately 7.5 times greater than that in the control group. These results support our hypothesis that sonophoresis becomes more effective in transdermal drug delivery due to the presence of engineered bubbles, and that the efficiency of transdermal drug delivery using sonophoresis with microbubbles depends on the concentration of microbubbles in case stable cavitation is predominant."
https://openalex.org/W2473925331,"Background The first antenatal clinic (ANC) visit helps to distinguish pregnant women who require standard care, from those with specific problems and so require special attention. There are protocols to guide care providers to provide optimal care to women during ANC. Our objectives were to determine the level of provider adherence to first antenatal visit guidelines in the Safe Motherhood Protocol (SMP), and assess patient factors that determine complete provider adherence. Methods This cross-sectional study is part of a cohort study that recruited women who delivered in eleven health facilities and who had utilized antenatal care services during their pregnancy in the Greater Accra region of Ghana. A record review of the first antenatal visit of participants was carried out to assess the level of adherence to the SMP, using a thirteen-point checklist. Information on their socio-demographic characteristics and previous pregnancy history was collected using a questionnaire. Percentages of adherence levels and baseline characteristics were estimated and cluster-adjusted odds ratios (OR) calculated to identify determinants. Results A total of 948 women who had delivered in eleven public facilities were recruited with a mean age (SD) of 28.2 (5.4) years. Overall, complete adherence to guidelines pertained to only 48.1% of pregnant women. Providers were significantly more likely to completely adhere to guidelines when caring for multiparous women [OR = 5.43 (1.69–17.44), p<0.01] but less likely to do so when attending to women with history of previous pregnancy complications [OR = 0.50 (0.33–0.75), p<0.01]. Conclusion Complete provider adherence to first antenatal visit guidelines is low across different facility types in the Greater Accra region of Ghana and is determined by parity and history of previous pregnancy complication. Providers should be trained and supported to adhere to the guidelines during provision of care to all pregnant women."

We report a novel ClC-1 mutation, T335N, that is associated with a mild phenotype in 1 patient, located in the extracellular I-J loop. The purpose of this study was to provide a solid correlation between T335N dysfunction and clinical symptoms in the affected patient as well as to offer hints for drug development. Our multidisciplinary approach includes patch-clamp electrophysiology on T335N and ClC-1 wild-type channels expressed in tsA201 cells, Western blot and quantitative PCR analyses on muscle biopsies from patient and unaffected individuals, and molecular dynamics simulations using a homology model of the ClC-1 dimer. T335N channels display reduced chloride currents as a result of gating alterations rather than altered surface expression. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the I-J loop might be involved in conformational changes that occur at the dimer interface, thus affecting gating. Finally, the gene expression profile of T335N carrier showed a diverse expression of K+ channel genes, compared with control individuals, as potentially contributing to the phenotype. This experimental paradigm satisfactorily explained myotonia in the patient. Furthermore, it could be relevant to the study and therapy of any channelopathy.—Imbrici, P., Altamura, C., Camerino, G.

Among the main findings, significant differences emerged in the proportion of co-authored papers based on age, gender and number of years the researchers had spent in their present institution. Female scholars had a greater proportion of co-authored papers than male scholars. Respondents considered improved quality of paper, contribution of mutual expertise, and division of labor as the biggest benefits of and motivation for co-authorship. Contrary to common perceptions that Economics researchers used a predominantly alphabetical order of authorship, our study found that a considerable percentage of respondents (34.5%) had practiced an order of authorship based on the significance of the authors’ contribution to the work. The relative importance of tasks differed significantly according to whether researchers co-authored as mentors or co-authored as colleagues. Lastly, researchers were found to associate, to varying degrees, with other researchers based on socio-academic parameters, such as nationality, ethnicity, gender, professional position and friendship. The study indicates that Economics authors perceive co-authorship as a rewarding endeavor. Nonetheless, the level of contribution and even the choice of association itself as a co-author depends to a great extent on the type of working relationship and socio-academic factors."
https://openalex.org/W2474191598,"Optimizing land-use allocation is important to regional sustainable development, as it promotes the social equality of public services, increases the economic benefits of land-use activities, and reduces the ecological risk of land-use planning. Most land-use optimization models allocate land-use using cell-level operations that fragment land-use patches. These models do not cooperate well with land-use planning knowledge, leading to irrational land-use patterns. This study focuses on building a heuristic land-use allocation model (PSOLA) using particle swarm optimization. The model allocates land-use with patch-level operations to avoid fragmentation. The patch-level operations include a patch-edge operator, a patch-size operator, and a patch-compactness operator that constrain the size and shape of land-use patches. The model is also integrated with knowledge-informed rules to provide auxiliary knowledge of land-use planning during optimization. The knowledge-informed rules consist of suitability, accessibility, land use policy, and stakeholders’ preference. To validate the PSOLA model, a case study was performed in Gaoqiao Town in Zhejiang Province, China. The results demonstrate that the PSOLA model outperforms a basic PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization) in the terms of the social, economic, ecological, and overall benefits by 3.60%, 7.10%, 1.53% and 4.06%, respectively, which confirms the effectiveness of our improvements. Furthermore, the model has an open architecture, enabling its extension as a generic tool to support decision making in land-use planning."

The targeting of proteins to specific cellular locations may be critical for their function. For example, the proteins involved in synaptic vesicle recycling need to be delivered to the synapse in neurons. Little is known about the molecular mechanism(s) by which PrPC accumulates within synapses. PrPC is linked to cell membranes by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor (6Stahl N. Borchelt D.R.

PrPC is found within cholesterol-rich, membrane microdomains that are commonly called lipid rafts (10Vey M. Pilkuhn S. Wille H. Nixon R. DeArmond S.J. Smart E.J. Anderson R.G. Taraboulos A.

The GPI anchor that links PrPC to the cell membrane targets it to lipid rafts (7Taraboulos A. Scott M. Semenov A. Avrahami D. Laszlo L. Prusiner S.B. Avraham D.

There are many different lipid rafts that demonstrate heterogeneity in their protein, glycolipid, and lipid composition (12Pike L.J. Lipid rafts: heterogeneity on the high seas.Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar), and different GPI-anchored proteins are targeted to different lipid rafts. For example, Thy-1 and PrPC occupy separate domains on the neuronal surface (13Madore N. Smith K.L. Graham C.H. Jen A. Brady K. Hall S. Morris R. Functionally different GPI proteins are organized in different domains on the neuronal surface.EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6917-6926Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Although all GPI anchors contain a conserved core, variations on this core structure are common (14Ikezawa H. Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins.Biol. Pharm. Bull. 2002; 25: 409-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), and the GPI attached to PrPC differs from that of Thy-1 (15Stahl N. Baldwin M.A. Hecker R. Pan K.M. Burlingame A.L. Prusiner S.B.

It has been hypothesized that the localization of some GPI-anchored proteins to specific lipid rafts and hence specific cell membranes is due to the composition of the GPI anchor. Thus, the composition of GPI anchors directs antigens to different rafts in the absence of interactive external domains (17Premkumar D.R. Fukuoka Y. Sevlever D. Brunschwig E. Rosenberry T.L.

We demonstrate that the targeting of PrPC to synapses was dependent upon cholesterol concentrations in the recipient neurons. Critically, we also demonstrate that the composition of the GPI anchor attached to PrPC is a key factor that affects the targeting of PrPC to synapses. More specifically, we show that the presence of sialic acid on the GPI anchor is necessary for the targeting of PrPC to synapses. To study the factors that control the targeting of PrPC to synapses, PrPC (10 nm) was introduced into neurons derived from Prnp(0/0) mice (22Liu T. Li R. Pan T. Liu D. Petersen R.B. Wong B.S.

PrPC preparations run in gels and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue did not show any contaminants (Fig. 1A). After 2 h, recipient neurons were collected, and organelles were separated upon a Percoll density gradient. The synaptic protein synaptophysin, used to identify synaptosomes, was concentrated in fractions 42–46 (Fig. 1B). These fractions also contained high concentrations of the synaptic proteins synapsin-1 and synaptobrevin-1 and were consequently pooled as synaptosomes. Following introduction to neurons, PrPC showed a time-dependent (Fig. 1C) and concentration-dependent (Fig. 1D) accumulation within synaptosomes. Not all GPI-anchored proteins were targeted to synapses because GPI-anchored CD14 added to neurons did not accumulate within synapses. PrPC is found in lipid rafts that contain high concentrations of cholesterol (11Taylor D.R. Hooper N.M. The prion protein and lipid rafts.Mol. Membr.

Prnp(0/0) neurons were treated with squalestatin, a selective squalene synthase inhibitor that reduced neuronal cholesterol concentrations (25Crick D.C. Suders J. Kluthe C.M. Andres D.A. Waechter C.J. Selective inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis in brain cells by squalestatin 1.J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 1365-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Although treatment with 1 μm squalestatin did not affect the uptake of exogenous PrPC into neurons (9.3 nm PrPC ± 0.6 compared with 9.2 nm ± 0.5, n = 9, p = 0.68), it significantly reduced the concentrations of PrPC found in lipid rafts (detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs)) (Fig. 2A). Although cholesterol is required for the formation and maintenance of synapses (26Hering H. Lin C.C. Sheng M.

When Prnp(0/0) neurons were treated with squalestatin for 24 h and incubated with 10 nm PrPC, squalestatin caused a dose-dependent reduction in the concentrations of PrPC found within synaptosomes (Fig. 2D). There was a significant correlation between cholesterol concentrations in squalestatin-treated neurons and the concentrations of PrPC found in synapses (Pearson's coefficient = 0.73, p < 0.01) (Fig. 2E). Treatment of Prnp(+/+) wild-type neurons with 500 nm squalestatin reduced the concentrations of PrPC in synaptosomes (Fig. 2). The addition of 5 μm squalene reversed the effects of squalestatin upon neuronal cholesterol concentrations (23Bate C. Salmona M. Diomede L. Williams A. Squalestatin cures prion-infected neurons and protects against prion neurotoxicity.J. Biol.

PrPC was digested with PLA2, an enzyme that targets acyl chains contained within GPIs to form monoacylated PrPC (Fig. 3B) and isolated using an immunoaffinity column and reverse phase chromatography as described (8Bate C. Williams A. Monoacylated cellular prion protein modifies cell membranes, inhibits cell signaling and reduces prion formation.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 8752-8758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Although similar amounts of monoacylated PrPC and PrPC bound to recipient Prnp(0/0) neurons (9.4 nm PrPC ± 0.7 compared with 9.2 nm ± 0.5, n = 12, p = 0.3), they were differently distributed between membranes. Whereas the majority of PrPC was found within lipid rafts (DRMs), most of the monoacylated PrPC was found within detergent-soluble membranes (DSMs) (Fig. 3C). Monoacylated PrPC added to Prnp(0/0) neurons was not targeted to synaptosomes (Fig. 3D). Because PrPC is also expressed by glial cells, we sought to determine whether glia-derived and neuron-derived PrPC had the same properties. Prnp(0/0) neurons were incubated with 10 nm glia-derived PrPC or 10 nm neuron-derived PrPC for 2 h. There were no significant differences in the concentrations of glial and neuronal PrPC incorporated into recipient neurons; nor were there any significant differences in the concentrations found within DRMs (Table 1). However, glial PrPC did not accumulate within synaptosomes (Fig. 4A). By comparing neuron and glia-derived PrPC we sought to determine the factors that affect synaptic targeting. Because the glycosylation of PrPC affects the trafficking of PrPC (28Cancellotti E. Wiseman F. Tuzi N.L. Baybutt H. Monaghan P. Aitchison L. Simpson J. Manson J.C.

When Prnp(0/0) neurons were pulsed with 10 nm neuronal PrPC or 10 nm PNGase-digested neuronal PrPC for 2 h, we found that the removal of N-linked glycans did not alter the concentrations of PrPC that bound to recipient neurons or the concentrations of PrPC found within synaptosomes (Table 1 and Fig. 4B). PNGase-digested glial PrPC was not found within synaptosomes, indicating that N-linked glycans did not stop glial PrPC from targeting synapses (Table 1). To eliminate the possible effects of N-linked glycans on the trafficking of PrPC, all subsequent experiments were carried out on PNGase-digested PrPC preparations.TABLE 1N-linked glycans do not affect the targeting of PrPC to synapsesConcentration PrPCTotalDRMDSMSynapsenmNeuronal PrPC9.2 ± 0.98.5 ± 0.81.0 ± 0.41.8 ± 0.32PNGase-digested neuronal PrPC8.9 ± 0.68.2 ± 0.80.9 ± 0.31.9 ± 0.35Glial PrPC9.2 ± 1.08.6 ± 0.81.1 ± 0.30.29 ± 0.24aConcentration of PrPC in synaptosomes significantly less than in neurons incubated with neuron-derived PrPC.PNGase-digested glial PrPC9.0 ± 0.58.0 ± 0.91.1 ± 0.40.24 ± 0.18aConcentration of PrPC in synaptosomes significantly less than in neurons incubated with neuron-derived PrPC.a Concentration of PrPC in synaptosomes significantly less than in neurons incubated with neuron-derived PrPC.

Isolated GPIs from neuronal and glial PrPC were blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. Detection with the phosphatidylinositol-reactive mAb 5AB3-11 and biotinylated concanavalin A (which binds to mannose, a core component of all GPIs) showed that similar amounts of GPIs were loaded onto membranes. However, Sambucus nigra lectin (which reacts with terminal sialic acid bound either α-2,6 or α-2,3 to galactose) bound to GPIs isolated from neuronal PrPC but not glial PrPC (Fig. 4C), indicating that only the GPI attached to neuronal PrPC contained a terminal sialic acid. The composition of GPI anchors affects the targeting of proteins to specific membranes (20Legler D.F. Doucey M.A. Schneider P. Chapatte L. Bender F.C. Bron C.

This sialic acid on GPIs derived from neuronal PrPC is susceptible to neuraminidase digestion (34Bate C. Williams A.

Chem. 2012; 287: 7935-7944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), resulting in desialylated PrPC (Fig. 5A). Digestion of neuronal PrPC with neuraminidase reduced the binding of S. nigra lectin without affecting the binding of concanavalin A or the phosphatidylinositol-reactive mAb 5AB3-11. Neuraminidase removal of terminal sialic acid would be expected to reveal a galactose residue (Fig. 5A). The lectin RC1 (which reacts with terminal galactose) binds to GPIs derived from desialylated PrPC but not to GPIs from neuronal PrPC, consistent with the putative structure of PrPC GPIs as proposed by Stahl et al. (15Stahl N. Baldwin M.A. Hecker R. Pan K.M. Burlingame A.L. Prusiner S.B. Glycosylinositol phospholipid anchors of the scrapie and cellular prion proteins contain sialic acid.Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5043-5053Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5B). Similar amounts of PrPC and desialylated PrPC bound to Prnp(0/0) neurons and were found within DRMs (Table 1). Although both neuronal and desialylated PrPC were targeted to rafts, desialylated PrPC did not accumulate in synapses (Fig. 5C). To determine whether the GPI attached to PrPC found at synapses differed from that found in the cell body, synaptosomes from Prnp(+/+) wild-type neurons were isolated. PrPC was purified, and GPIs were isolated. There were no obvious differences between GPIs isolated from synaptic PrPC or from cell body PrPC when analyzed by high performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC) (Fig. 5D) or by dot blots (Fig. 5E). The S. nigra lectin (which binds terminal sialic acid) bound to GPIs isolated from PrPC derived from the cell body. GPIs from neuronal PrPC and desialylated PrPC were isolated on C18 columns (Fig. 6A) and HPTLC (Fig. 6B) and labeled with FITC. Prnp(0/0) neurons were incubated with 10 nm FITC or 10 nm FITC-labeled GPIs for 2 h and washed, and florescence was measured. Neurons incubated with 10 nm FITC contained only 0.6 nm ± 0.2 FITC compared with neurons incubated with FITC-GPI (8.2 nm ± 0.88) or FITC-desialylated GPI (7.7 nm ± 0.98) (Table 2). Similar concentrations of GPIs and desialylated GPIs were found in lipid rafts (DRMs) (Table 2). GPIs derived from neuronal PrPC accumulated in synaptosomes in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6C). FITC-GPIs accumulated in synaptosomes at higher concentrations than FITC alone or desialylated GPIs (Fig. 6D).TABLE 2GPIs are targeted to raftsFITC (Fluorescence)TotalDRMDSMnmFITC-control0.6 ± 0.20.2 ± 0.20.4 ± 0.2FITC-GPI8.2 ± 0.887.6 ± 0.64aConcentration of GPIs in DRMs (rafts) significantly less than in neurons incubated with control GPIs.0.53 ± 0.21FITC-desialylated GPI7.7 ± 0.987.2 ± 0.71aConcentration of GPIs in DRMs (rafts) significantly less than in neurons incubated with control GPIs.0.51 ± 0.25a Concentration of GPIs in DRMs (rafts) significantly less than in neurons incubated with control GPIs. Open table in a new tab To determine whether GPIs inhibited the targeting of neuronal PrPC to synaptosomes, Prnp(0/0) neurons were pretreated with GPIs derived from PrPC (10 to 1.25 nm) and incubated with 10 nm neuronal PrPC for 2 h. These GPIs reduced the concentrations of PrPC found within synaptosomes in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6E). This effect was structure-dependent because desialylated GPIs did not affect the concentrations of PrPC found within synaptosomes (Fig. 6F). To test the hypothesis that specific GPIs could target other proteins to synapses, rabbit IgG was conjugated to GPIs (derived from neuronal PrPC) or desialylated GPIs. The GPI-modified rabbit IgG was isolated by reverse phase chromatography on C18 columns. IgG conjugated to GPIs or desialylated GPIs eluted from C18 columns in concentrations between 60 and 70%, whereas control IgG did not bind and eluted in the void volume (Fig. 7A). IgG conjugated to GPIs was differentiated from IgG by HPTLC (Fig. 7B). Subsequently, neurons were incubated with 10 nm IgG, 10 nm IgG-GPI, or 10 nm IgG-desialylated GPI for 2 h. Only low concentrations of IgG (0.3 nm) bound to neurons. Similar concentrations of IgG-GPI and IgG-desialylated GPI were found in neurons, indicating that the composition of the GPI did not affect the binding to neurons (Fig. 7C). Both IgG-GPI and IgG-desialylated GPI were targeted to lipid rafts (DRMs) (Table 3). Both were released from neurons by digestion with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC), indicating that they were expressed at the surface of neurons (Table 3). Critically, IgG-GPI, but not IgG-desialylated GPI, was found in synaptosomes (Fig. 7D).TABLE 3Sialylated GPIs target IgG to raftsRabbit IgGTotalDRMDSMPI-PLCnmControl IgG0.3 ± 0.10.1 ± 0.10.1 ± 0.10.1 ± 0.1IgG-GPI9.1 ± 0.48.4 ± 0.50.8 ± 0.20.2 ± 0.2IgG-desialylated GPI9.2 ± 0.58.5 ± 0.70.8 ± 0.20.1 ± 0.1 Open table in a new tab Our study examined the factors that affect the distribution of PrPC in neurons. We report that PrPC added to recipient Prnp(0/0) neurons rapidly accumulated at synapses. The targeting of PrPC to synapses was dependent upon two key factors: the cholesterol concentration of cell membranes and the composition of the GPI attached to PrPC. More specifically, PrPC was not targeted to synapses following the removal of either sialic acid or an acyl chain from the GPI attached to PrPC. The targeting of proteins to specific membrane domains is of key importance in neurons. PrPC is concentrated in synapses (2Herms J. Tings T. Gall S. Madlung A. Giese A. Siebert H. Schürmann P.

Prion and prejudice: normal protein and the synapse.Trends Neurosci. 2001; 24: 85-90Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), and in this study, neuron-derived PrPC was targeted to synapses after its inclusion in specific, cholesterol-sensitive, lipid rafts. The mild cholesterol depletion caused by squalestatin did not affect the number of synapses. However, this cholesterol depletion reduced the targeting of neuronal PrPC to lipid rafts and the trafficking of PrPC to synapses (there was a significant correlation between the concentrations of cholesterol in squalestatin-treated neurons and the concentrations of PrPC found within synaptosomes), results consistent with the hypothesis that the inclusion of PrPC into lipid rafts precedes delivery of PrPC to synapses. Squalestatin also reduced the concentrations of PrPC found in synaptosomes from wild type neurons. The effect of squalestatin on cholesterol concentrations and the targeting of PrPC to rafts and synaptosomes were reversed by the addition of squalene. We hypothesized that the GPI also targeted PrPC to synapses. This hypothesis was supported by the observation that monoacylated PrPC was neither targeted to rafts nor found in synapses. It is thought that saturated acyl chains attached to GPIs allow tight molecular packing and increase the solubilization of cholesterol (35Maeda Y. Tashima Y. Houjou T. Fujita M. Yoko-o T. Jigami Y.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 12130-12134Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). Consequently, the loss of a saturated acyl chain disrupts the membrane surrounding monoacylated PrPC (8Bate C. Williams A. Monoacylated cellular prion protein modifies cell membranes, inhibits cell signaling and reduces prion formation.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 8752-8758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Not all GPI-anchored proteins found within rafts are found within synapses, and neither the GPI-anchored CD14 nor glial PrPC was found within synaptosomes. The observation that glial PrPC was not found within synapses indicated that the essential synaptic targeting signal in PrPC lay in a post-translational modification. Because digestion with PNGase did not affect the trafficking of PrPC to synapses, we concluded that N-linked glycosylation of neuronal and glial PrPC was not a significant factor in targeting PrPC to synapses. The composition of the GPI anchor is dependent upon the cell type (31Chen R. Walter E.I. Parker G. Lapurga J.P. Millan J.L. Ikehara Y. Udenfriend S. Medof M.E.

Response to the Hh ligands is mediated by the receptor Patched-1 (Ptch1), a 12-pass transmembrane glycoprotein. Despite its essential role in Hh signaling and its activity as a tumor suppressor, Ptch1 remains largely uncharacterized. We demonstrate here that Ptch1 binds to itself to form oligomeric structures. Oligomerization is mediated by two distinct, structurally disordered, intracellular domains spanning amino acids 584–734 (“middle loop”) and 1162–1432 (C terminus). However, oligomerization is not required for Ptch1-dependent regulation of the canonical Hh pathway operating through Smo. Expression of a mutant protein that deletes both regions represses the Hh pathway and responds to the addition of Hh ligand independent of its inability to bind other factors such as Smurf2. Additionally, deletion of the cytoplasmic middle loop domain generates a Ptch1 mutant that, despite binding to Hh ligand, constitutively suppresses Hh signaling and increases the length of primary cilia. Constitutive activity because of deletion of this region is reversed by further deletion of specific sequences in the cytoplasmic C-terminal domain. These data reveal an interaction between the cytoplasmic domains of Ptch1 and that these domains modulate Ptch1 activity but are not essential for regulation of the Hh pathway.

Ptch1 is a 12-pass, integral membrane glycoprotein for which the best-defined activity is the indirect repression of the activity of the G protein-coupled factor Smoothened (Smo) (15Chen Y. Struhl G.

In the absence of Hh ligand, Ptch1-dependent repression of Smo promotes conversion of the transcriptional mediators of the Hh signaling pathway, the Gli family proteins Gli2 and Gli3, into transcriptional repressors (17Sasaki H.

Hh ligand binding to Ptch1 inhibits its activity, activating Smo and thereby maintaining Gli2/3 in their transcriptionally active state. Referred to as the “canonical” pathway, this signaling cascade is typically organized by the primary cilium, where processing of specific components of the pathway is determined by their trafficking through this subcellular structure 18Corbit K.C.

In the absence of Hh ligand, Ptch1 localizes to the cilium, whereas Smo is excluded and is typically localized to the transition zone at its base. Activation of the canonical pathway by the Hh ligands results in the relocalization of Ptch1 to endosomes and Smo to the tip of the cilium. Defects in the molecular motors responsible for maintaining cilium structure also deleteriously affect Hh signaling (for a review, see Ref. 22Wilson C.W. Stainier D.Y.

Hedgehog Src homology mouse embryonic fibroblast alkaline phosphatase amino acid(s) C-terminal endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate homologous to the E6-AP carboxyl terminus. Previously, we and others showed that Ptch1 complexes a number of proteins involved in signaling pathways distinct from those operating through Smo. For example, Ptch1 binds to the cyclin B1/cdk1 co-complex in an Hh-dependent manner (23Barnes E.A. Kong M. Ollendorff V. Donoghue D.J.

Patched1 functions as a gatekeeper by promoting cell cycle progression.Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 2081-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Binding of the Hh ligands by Ptch1 liberates cyclin B1/cdk1, thereby promoting the transition through mitosis. Likewise, a point mutation in the C terminus of Ptch1 prevents binding of Tid1 (25Wakabayashi Y. Mao J.-H. Brown K. Girardi M. Balmain A.

Biol. 2001; 239: 95-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). For some developing tissues, for example limb buds and adipose tissue, the mes variant of Ptch1 appears to behave as a hypomorphic allele of Ptch1 during embryogenesis. For these tissues, increased signaling through the canonical Hh pathway is observed, as evidenced by induction of the transcriptional targets of the Hh signaling pathway, Ptch1 and Gli1, as well as the resultant phenotypes that are consistent with constitutive canonical Hh signaling (37Li Z. Zhang H. Denhard L.A. Liu L.-H. Zhou H. Lan Z.-J. Reduced white fat mass in adult mice bearing a truncated Patched 1.Int. J. Biol. Sci. 2008; 4: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, in the skin of mes mice, where precocious hair follicle development occurs, altered canonical Hh signaling was not observed (38Nieuwenhuis E. Barnfield P.C. Makino S. Hui C.-C. Epidermal hyperplasia and expansion of the interfollicular stem cell compartment in mutant mice with a C-terminal truncation of Patched1.Dev. Biol. 2007; 308: 547-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Similarly, no increase in canonical Hh signaling was seen in epithelial cells of the mammary gland despite development of this skin appendage at puberty being blocked by the mes mutation (39Okolowsky N. Furth P.A. Hamel P.A. Oestrogen receptor-α regulates non-canonical Hedgehog-signalling in the mammary gland.Dev. Biol. 2014; 391: 219-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 40Chang H.

Indeed, Hh signaling in mammary epithelial cells appears to require a cascade that involves estrogen receptor-α and c-src rather than the canonical signaling pathway operating through Smo (39Okolowsky N. Furth P.A. Hamel P.A. Oestrogen receptor-α regulates non-canonical Hedgehog-signalling in the mammary gland.Dev. Biol. 2014; 391: 219-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 40Chang H.

Despite these apparent tissue-specific effects of truncating the C terminus of Ptch1, wild-type Ptch1 and mes repress Hh signaling similarly when introduced into Ptch1-deficient MEFs (27Harvey M.C.

Biol. 2007; 308: 547-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Furthermore, wild-type and mes Ptch1 bind an alkaline phosphatase-Shh (AP-Shh) fusion protein with indistinguishable avidities. In transient assays, Shh binding to either of these also inhibits their activity as a repressor of Smo (27Harvey M.C. Fleet A. Okolowsky N. Hamel P.A.

Chem. 2014; 289: 10939-10949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Thus, the structural basis in the mes mutant that gives rise to the non-lethal, tissue-specific effects of this variant of Ptch1 remains unclear. To begin to define the structural aspects of Ptch1 that regulate its activities, the role of the two large intracellular domains (amino acids 584–734 and 1161–1434) that are highly conserved among vertebrates were characterized. Our analyses revealed that Ptch1-dependent repression of Smo does not require either of these two cytoplasmic domains. However, mutation of the cytoplasmic domain at the middle portion of Ptch1 generates a dominant variant that, despite binding to Shh ligand, constitutively represses Hedgehog signaling but does not prevent Smo localization to cilia. Furthermore, we show that, like dPtc (41Lu X. Liu S. Kornberg T.B. The C-terminal tail of the Hedgehog receptor Patched regulates both localization and turnover.Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 2539-2551Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), mPtch1 also forms multimers. However, two cytoplasmic domains facilitate Ptch1 binding to itself, and, in contrast to dPtc, multimerization activity is not required for mPtch1-dependent repression of Smo or its ability to respond to Hh ligand. The 1434 a.a. mPtch1 protein is predicted to span the membrane 12 times, with an apparent gross structural symmetry between the first half and second half of the protein (Fig. 1A). Given the tissue-specific effects of the mes mutation and the highly conserved sequences between vertebrates of the two large cytoplasmic domains of Ptch1, the activities associated with these domains were characterized. Oligomerization of dPtc is mediated by its C terminus (41Lu X. Liu S. Kornberg T.B. The C-terminal tail of the Hedgehog receptor Patched regulates both localization and turnover.Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 2539-2551Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Thus, the ability of mPtch1 to form higher-order complexes was tested. Cells were co-transfected with HA-tagged full-length mPtch1 (mPtchHA) and mutants of mPtch1 that had gross deletions in the two large cytoplasmic domains of the protein: the C-terminal domain (ΔC, deletion of a.a. 1179–1434), the “middle loop” domain (ΔML, deletion of a.a. 614–709), or the two domains together (ΔMLΔC). As Fig. 1B illustrates, immunoprecipitation under stringent conditions of the full-length mPtch1HA using an α-HA antibody co-immunoprecipitated the ΔC mutant of mPtch1 but not the ΔMLΔC mutant that deleted both the C terminus and the middle loop domain. Because migration of the ΔML mutant overlaps that of full-length PtchHA in SDS-PAGE gels, GFP-tagged mPtch1 was co-transfected with HA-tagged ΔML, and co-immunoprecipitations were performed (Fig. 1C). The reciprocal immunoprecipitations in the Fig. 1C, center and right panels, showed that deletion of a.a. 614–709 in the ML region had no effect on mPtch1 binding to itself. Thus, oligomerization of mPtch1 was facilitated by two cytoplasmic domains, the C terminus, and the middle loop region. Either domain was sufficient to mediate oligomerization, and deletion of both domains was necessary to prevent mPtch1 from binding to itself. Both the ML and C-terminal domains encode motifs that mediate binding to factors harboring SH2, SH3, and WW domains (26Chang H. Li Q. Moraes R.C. Lewis M.T. Hamel P.A. Activation of Erk by sonic hedgehog independent of canonical hedgehog signalling.Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2010; 42: 1462-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, only a random coil or disordered structure for these domains is predicted using several algorithms that predict secondary structure. Thus, the regions required for mPtch1 to bind to either the C-terminal or middle loop domains were determined. As summarized in Fig. 2A, a series of mutants of mPtch1 that harbored deletions in discrete portions of the C terminus and ML domains were co-transfected with constructs expressing an HA-tagged C-terminal protein (Fig. 2B) or a GFP-tagged ML fragment (Fig. 2C). Co-immunoprecipitation of the mPtch1 deletion mutants under high stringency conditions (i.e. radioimmune precipitation assay buffer) revealed that the individual domains readily associated with full-length mPtch1 that maintained either the ML or C-terminal portions of mPtch1. Simultaneous deletion of even small portions in the C terminus (e.g. ΔCX-A) in combination with the ML deletion prevented binding of either the isolated HAC-terminal or GFPML domains to mPtch1. In contrast, the small deletion (ΔMLB-X) near the end of the middle loop domain in combination with deletions in the C terminus retained binding activity to GFPML. Furthermore, we observed that point mutations in the polyproline motifs, determined previously to mediate binding to proteins with SH2, SH3, or WW domains (26Chang H. Li Q. Moraes R.C. Lewis M.T. Hamel P.A. Activation of Erk by sonic hedgehog independent of canonical hedgehog signalling.Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2010; 42: 1462-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 28Yue S.

Activation of Smurf E3 ligase promoted by smoothened regulates hedgehog signaling through targeting patched turnover.PLoS Biol. 2013; 11: e1001721Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), did not affect binding of Ptch1 to itself. To verify that oligomerization activity was intrinsic to the ML and C-terminal domains, GFPML and HAC-term were co-transfected into HEK 293 cells, and coimmunoprecipitations were performed using an α-HA antibody (Fig. 3). GFPML co-immunoprecipitated with HAC-term (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, like its analogous region in dPtc, HAC-term co-immunoprecipitated the GFP-tagged version of this same domain (Fig. 3B). Thus, similar to dPtc, the C-terminal domain of mPtch1 facilitates oligomerization of this receptor. However, in the case of murine Ptch1, the cytoplasmic ML domain also exhibited this activity. Thus, the C terminus is able to form both homocomplexes and heterocomplexes with the middle loop. Given the lack of similarity in the C-terminal and ML domains in dPtc versus mPtch1, it was predicted that these regions may be dispensable for control of Smo activity. Thus, specific mutants of mPtch1 were tested for their ability to repress canonical signaling and to respond to Hh ligand. mPtch1 mutants were co-transfected with the 8x-Gli1-Luc construct into Ptch1-deficient MEFs. Serum-starved cells were then stimulated with control medium or medium containing Shh ligand, and changes in canonical Hh signaling were determined (Fig. 4). All mutants with any deletion or alterations in either the ML or C terminus (Fig. 4A) strongly repressed the canonical pathway, as evidenced by the 60–80% reduction in luciferase activity relative to control cells. Mutants that deleted the ML domain in combination with various C-terminal deletions also strongly repressed canonical Hh signaling. Notably, this included the ΔMLΔC mutant that removed all but 12 amino acids in the C-terminal domain and almost 100 amino acids of the ML domain. These data reveal that the ML and C-terminal domains, individually or together, are not required for mPtch1-dependent repression of Smo activity in MEFs. Furthermore, combined with the data in FIGURE 1., FIGURE 2., FIGURE 3., repression of canonical Hh signaling in mPtch1, unlike dPtc, does not depend on the ability of Ptch1 to form multimers. The ability of the mPtch1 deletion mutants to respond to Hh ligand was then determined. Full-length mPtch1 and variants that deleted sequences in the C terminus (e.g. ΔC) all responded to the addition of Hh ligand. So, although full-length mPtch1 or the ΔC truncation repressed canonical signaling by 60–80%, addition of medium containing N-Shh ligand reversed this repression, as was evident by the increased luciferase activity relative to the control medium (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, despite strong repression of the pathway by the ΔML mutant (deletion of a.a. 615–710), addition of N-Shh did not induce canonical Hh signaling. Thus, the deletion of 100 a.a. in the ML domain generated a constitutively active variant of mPtch1. The resistance to inhibition by Shh of the ΔML mutant lacking amino acids 615–710 was reversed, however, by simultaneous deletion of the C terminus of mPtch1, evident by the induction of luciferase activity of the ΔMLΔC mutant upon addition of N-Shh ligand. A representative Western blot for the core mutants (Fig. 4E) demonstrates that the ability to derepress in response to Hh ligand is not related to the expression level of the protein. The regions in the C terminus required for overcoming the constitutive activity of the deletion in the ML region were refined using small deletions of the C-terminal domain (Fig. 4, C and D). Deletions in the C terminus downstream from amino acid 1274 (ΔCX-A, ΔCXcm) failed to reverse constitutive repression of the canonical Hh pathway by ΔML. However, deletion of the sequence between amino acids 1179 and 1310 (ΔCP-A) restored the response to Shh ligand by ΔML. Fig. 4D illustrates refinement of this region where mutants that delete either the polyproline sequence (ΔMLΔCΔPP1) and/or the sequence with a high proportion of amino acids with hydroxyl side chains (ΔMLΔCΔOH) restored the sensitivity of mutants with the ΔML deletion to treatment with Shh. Thus, although deletion of specific portions of the C terminus, in combination with the middle loop, abrogates binding of these domains to Ptch1, deletion of the region between a.a.1174–1223 is sufficient to alter the constitutive repression activity imparted by the deletion of the Ptch1 ML domain. The Western blot in Fig. 4E illustrates that the levels of ΔMLΔC protein are typically higher than those of other mutants, presumably because of its increased stability, a consequence of the loss of both binding sites for the E3 ubiquitin ligases Itch and Smurf1/2 (see below). To more carefully quantify its ability to regulate the Hh pathway, we titrated the amount of ΔMLΔC and measured its ability to modulate Hh signaling relative to full-length mPtch1. The relative levels of mPtch1 were then determined by Western blotting analysis using lysates derived from a portion of the same cells used for one of the luciferase experiments. The ΔMLΔC mutant s"

The maintenance of genome integrity during mitosis is crucial for cell survival and organismal development. To generate two daughter cells with identical genetic information, each sister chromatid must be captured by spindle microtubules (MTs), 4The abbreviations used are:MTmicrotubuleKTkinetochoreCdk1Cyclin-dependent kinase 1Plk1Polo-like kinase 1Claspcytoplasmic linker-associated proteinDDS135D/S249D. aligned at the mitotic equator, and segregated toward the spindle poles. Cells build a proteinaceous structure, known as the KT, at the centromere and form a bipolar spindle with an amphitelic spindle attachment to achieve accurate chromosome segregation (1Walczak C.E. Cai S. Khodjakov A. Mechanisms of chromosome behaviour during mitosis.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 91-102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The KT is made up of protein complexes that control its localization on the chromosome, assembly, attachment to spindle MTs, and chromosome movements, such as congression and segregation (2Cheeseman I.M. Desai A. Molecular architecture of the kinetochore-microtubule interface.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 33-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). KTs lacking essential proteins for KT-MT attachment, such as Knl1, Mis12, and Ndc80 protein subcomplexes, are unable to attach to spindle MTs (3Cheeseman I.M. Chappie J.S. Wilson-Kubalek E.M.

Entry into mitosis is controlled by the concerted action of several mitotic kinases, such as Cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1), Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1), and Aurora A, whose activities are regulated indirectly in a positive feedback loop (5Murray A.W. Recycling the cell cycle: cyclins revisited.Cell. 2004; 116: 221-234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar). Plk1 activates Cdk1 by phosphorylating and activating Cdc25, which then removes inhibitory phosphorylation at the Thr-14 and Tyr-15 sites of Cdk1. Aurora A phosphorylates Thr-210 in the active loop of Plk1 with the aid of Bora (6Seki A. Coppinger J.A. Jang C.Y. Yates J.R. Fang G. Bora and the kinase Aurora A cooperatively activate the kinase Plk1 and control mitotic entry.Science. 2008; 320: 1655-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Cdk1 also activates Plk1 via Bora phosphorylation to promote mitotic entry in Caenorhabditis elegans (7Tavernier N. Noatynska A. Panbianco C. Martino L. Van Hove L. Schwager F. Léger T. Gotta M.

Although mitotic kinases also govern metaphase-anaphase transition and faithful chromosome segregation by ensuring that spindles are properly assembled, their roles in the prometaphase-metaphase transition remain one of the least understood facets of the mitotic process. Interestingly, prometaphase arrest, which involves a chromosome ring with a monopolar spindle, is triggered by a Plk1 inhibitor (8Lénárt P. Petronczki M. Steegmaier M. Di Fiore B. Lipp J.J.

Although Plk1 may be involved in the process of centrosome maturation by sensing initial spindle attachment, its physiological substrates in prometaphase have not yet been identified. Furthermore, the altered interaction mode between KTs and MTs requires changes in KT composition and structure (10Tanaka K. Dynamic regulation of kinetochore-microtubule interaction during mitosis.J.

Intriguingly, a slight increase in KT-MT stability in early mitosis causes chromosome segregation defects in normal untransformed human cells that resemble those in cancer cells with chromosomal instability. Although stable KT-MT attachment is clearly important for chromosome integrity, the mechanistic details underlying how cells recruit outer KT components to achieve stable spindle attachment remain unclear. The centrosome not only nucleates spindle MTs in prophase to ensure proper mitotic spindle orientation and chromosome segregation (13Bornens M. The centrosome in cells and organisms.Science. 2012; 335: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) but also functions as a reaction center for the activation of mitotic kinases, including Cdk1 and Plk1, that trigger the G2/M transition (14Doxsey S.

Aurora A regulates separase activity and the interaction of Astrin with Kinastrin/Skap and Clasp1α by phosphorylating Astrin at Ser-115 to promote mitotic progression (34Chiu S.C. Chen J.M. Wei T.Y.

Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2014; 307: C466-C478Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Although it is known that Astrin recruits the outer KT resident motor protein Cenp-E and its partner Cenp-F for stable MT-KT interactions (26Thein K.H. Kleylein-Sohn J. Nigg E.A. Gruneberg U. Astrin is required for the maintenance of sister chromatid cohesion and centrosome integrity.J. Cell Biol. 2007; 178: 345-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), precisely how it is targeted to KTs is unclear. Here, we show that Astrin phosphorylation at Ser-135 and Ser-249 by Cdk1 is essential not only for bipolar spindle formation but also for targeting it to KTs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the phosphorylation of Astrin by Cdk1 is mediated by Plk1 during the prometaphase-metaphase transition and is fine-tuned by Cdc14A, a phosphatase. Overall, our results suggest that Astrin is a substrate of a Plk1-Cdk1 activation loop and that it coordinates stable KT-MT attachment to ensure chromosome integrity. Although Astrin is known to be phosphorylated at multiple sites (33Cheng T.S. Hsiao Y.L. Lin C.C. Yu C.T. Hsu C.M. Chang M.S. Lee C.I. Huang C.Y. Howng S.L. Hong Y.R.

Cell Physiol. 2014; 307: C466-C478Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), it is unclear whether Astrin phosphorylation by mitotic kinases regulates its KT targeting. This uncertainty prompted us to research other phosphorylation sites, the mitotic kinase(s) responsible for Astrin targeting to KTs, and the resulting KT structural ensemble. As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, the slower migrating band of endogenous or overexpressed Astrin disappeared in response to the addition of γ-phosphatase, which suggested that the shifted Astrin corresponded to the phosphorylated protein. A phosphorylated band appeared in early mitotic cells (compared with asynchronous or G2 cells) (Fig. 1, C and D) and began diminishing 3 h after the release from a nocodazole block (Fig. 1E). Furthermore, phospho-Astrin accumulated in mitotic cells in response to MG132 treatment (Fig. 1F), which suggests that Astrin is phosphorylated in all stages from mitotic entry to metaphase. Next, we examined the Astrin phosphorylation sites during mitosis. To evaluate the phosphorylation sites of Astrin during mitosis, the six generated Astrin deletion mutants (Fig. 2A) were transfected into 293T cells and treated with/without nocodazole. The cell lysates were assessed for Astrin phosphorylation. WT Astrin and the deletion mutants D1, D2, and D3 were phosphorylated during mitosis, but the Astrin mutants D4, D5, and D6 were not phosphorylated (Fig. 2B). This result indicated that the Astrin sites phosphorylated during mitosis were present in the N terminus of the Astrin D1 mutant (amino acids 1–480). To narrow down the relevant phosphorylation sites, Astrin D1 was divided into five regions: D1-1, -2, -3, -4, and -5 (Fig. 2C). Transfection experiments using these mutants revealed that only Astrin D1-2 was not phosphorylated during mitosis (Fig. 2D). To better identify Astrin phosphorylation sites, we used deletion mutants. We identified the phosphorylation sites of Astrin during mitosis using the PhosphoSite program. We selected 6 serine/threonine sites with more than five references (Fig. 2E). Next, we mutated all 6 serine/threonine residues located in the N-terminal region of Astrin to alanine to determine the physiological phosphorylation site and to assess the effect of the N-terminal phosphorylation of Astrin. This mutant (Astrin 6A) was not phosphorylated during mitosis (Fig. 2F) and displayed normal spindle localization but functional defects in translocation to the KT (Fig. 2G). To confirm which residues were responsible for the KT localization of Astrin, we introduced point mutations into Astrin and observed the localization of these mutants in mitotic cells. Strikingly, the S135A and S249A Astrin mutants could not be targeted to KTs (Fig. 3, A and B), which suggested that the phosphorylation of at least one of these residues was responsible for the KT localization of Astrin. To investigate whether Astrin phosphorylation at Ser-135 and/or Ser-249 is associated with mitotic function, we generated siRNA-resistant constructs (Fig. 3, C and D). As expected, the overexpression of the siRNA-resistant mutants S135A or S249A in Astrin knockdown HeLa cells did not rescue G2/M arrest (Fig. 3E). Consistent with this finding, the overexpression of Astrin WT and phosphomimetic S135D and S249D mutants overcame Astrin depletion-mediated mitotic arrest and multipolar spindle formation, but phospho-dead S135A and S249A mutants did not (Fig. 3F). To further analyze the functional relevance of these phosphorylation sites, we tested the ability of a phospho-dead mutant to rescue mitotic defects, such as multipolar spindles and misaligned chromosomes, caused by Astrin depletion. Interestingly, WT and S135D/S249D (DD) mutants rescued the mitotic defects (Fig. 3, G and H), suggesting that the phosphorylation of Ser-135 and Ser-249 is essential for the mitotic function of Astrin in spindle biorientation and chromosome congression. Given that the Ser-135 and Ser-249 sites of Astrin are conserved in many vertebrate species (Fig. 4, A and B), we generated specific antibodies against the phosphopeptide sequences surrounding the Ser-135 and Ser-249 residues (Fig. 4C). The phospho-Astrin antibody showed high specificity because it did not recognize the phospho-dead mutants (Fig. 4D). Endogenous Astrin proteins in mitotic cell lysates were also recognized by the phospho-specific antibodies, but phosphatase-treated endogenous Astrin proteins were not (Fig. 4E). The levels of Astrin phosphorylation at the Ser-135 and Ser-249 residues were monitored during mitosis (Fig. 4F) and were highest 1 h after release from the nocodazole block (Fig. 4G). To further confirm the phosphorylation of Astrin at Ser-135 and Ser-249, we used a cell-free system derived from asynchronous or mitotic HeLa cells. The N-terminal region of Astrin fused with GST (GST-Astrin-N) was phosphorylated at Ser-135 or Ser-249 in nocodazole-treated mitotic cell extracts; asynchronous cell extracts were used as a control (Fig. 4H). Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that Astrin phosphorylated at Ser-135 or Ser-249 was mainly localized to KTs; however, small amounts were observed at the centrosome and spindle (Fig. 5, A and B). To further test the specificity of antibodies against phospho-Astrin, we confirmed that the knockdown of Astrin completely abolished the localization of phospho-Astrin at the KTs (Fig. 5, A and B). Consistent with this observation, the phospho-mimetic DD mutant localized to KTs (Fig. 5C) and recruited outer KT components such as Cenp-E and Cenp-F more efficiently compared with WT Astrin (Fig. 5D). Taken together, we conclude that Astrin is targeted to KTs via its phosphorylation at both Ser-135 and Ser-249.FIGURE 5.Phospho-Astrin localizes at KTs and recruits Cenp-E.

As shown in Fig. 6A, the ectopic expression of Plk1 increased Astrin phosphorylation at Ser-135 and Ser-249. Furthermore, Astrin phosphorylation during mitosis was inhibited by treatment with both a Plk1 and a Cdk1 inhibitor (Fig. 6B). The phosphorylation of Astrin by Plk1 is similar to its phosphorylation pattern during mitosis (Fig. 6, C and D). As expected, Plk1 overexpression was unable to phosphorylate the 6A and S135A/S249A Astrin mutants (Fig. 6, E and F), but it also did not phosphorylate the individual S135A and S249A mutants (Fig. 6G), suggesting that Plk1 is directly or indirectly involved in Astrin phosphorylation. A similar phosphorylation pattern of Astrin deletion mutants was detected in Cdk1-overexpressing cells, Plk1-overexpressing cells, and mitotic cells (Fig. 7, A and B). Consistent with this finding, the ectopic expression of Cdk1 induced Astrin phosphorylation at Ser-135 and Ser-249 (Fig. 7C). To determine the physiological mitotic kinase for Astrin phosphorylation at Ser-135 and Ser-249, we developed an in vitro kinase assay with purified kinases and the recombinant N-terminal region of Astrin. As shown in Fig. 7, D and E, only Cdk1 phosphorylated Astrin at Ser-135 and Ser-249, and the phosphorylation of recombinant Astrin in mitotic cell extracts was only blocked by a Cdk1 inhibitor. Furthermore, Cdk1 siRNA abolished the phosphorylation of endogenous Astrin during mitosis (Fig. 7F), and both Ser-135 and Ser-249 are the minimal Cdk1 consensus sites ((S/T)P) (Fig. 4, A and B), indicating that Cdk1 is the mitotic kinase responsible for Astrin phosphorylation at Ser-135 and Ser-249. Astrin phosphorylation was reduced by a Plk1 inhibitor (Fig. 6B) and induced by the ectopic expression of Plk1 (Fig. 6A), suggesting that Cdk1 might be activated by a positive feedback loop involving Plk1. To test this hypothesis, we transfected Myc-Astrin with Cdk1 and Plk1. Ectopic Plk1 alone weakly phosphorylated Myc-Astrin, and it increased the phosphorylation of Astrin by ectopic Cdk1 (Fig. 7G), suggesting that Plk1 activates Cdk1 and thereby phosphorylates Astrin at Ser-135 and Ser-249. To elucidate the molecular basis of the relationship between the phosphorylation and the KT targeting of Astrin, Kinastrin-depleted cells were analyzed in detail. Consistent with previous reports (27Dunsch A.K. Linnane E. Barr F.A. Gruneberg U. The astrin-kinastrin/SKAP complex localizes to microtubule plus ends and facilitates chromosome alignment.J. Cell Biol. 2011; 192: 959-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), the levels of Astrin and phospho-Astrin decreased in KTs in Kinastrin-depleted cells (Fig. 8, A–D), indicating that Kinastrin transports phospho-Astrin to KTs. We were further interested in delineating the physiological consequences of phospho-Astrin in relation to KT composition and KT-MT attachment. We therefore examined the localization of Astrin after treatment with a Plk1 inhibitor that arrests cells in prometaphase where there is a monopolar spindle (Polo spindle) encircled by a chromosome ring with a lateral KT attachment (8Lénárt P.

As expected, the Plk1 inhibitor reduced the targeting of Astrin to KTs concurrent with a reduction in Astrin phosphorylation (Fig. 8, E–G). Strikingly, the number of Polo spindle-containing prometaphase cells decreased substantially with the expression of the DD mutant along with treatment with the Plk1 inhibitor (Fig. 8, H and I), indicating that the phosphorylation of Astrin at Ser-135 and Ser-249 mediated by Plk1 is crucial for spindle attachment to KTs and the prometaphase-to-metaphase transition. Consistent with this finding, the spindle MTs in Astrin-depleted cells were less stable under cold stress (Fig. 8, J and K). Furthermore, the expression of the DD mutant increased metaphase cells with stable KT-MT attachment because the DD mutant diminished the spindle assembly checkpoint, including Mad2 and BubR1 at KTs, in the presence of the Plk1 inhibitor (Fig. 8, L and M). Therefore, we conclude that"

It is well established that macrophages play a central role in innate and adaptive immune responses (1Ginhoux F. Jung S. Monocytes and macrophages: developmental pathways and tissue homeostasis.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2014; 14: 392-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1134) Google Scholar). They contribute to the recognition, uptake, and killing of non-self agents and also the initiation and progression of the adaptive immune response (2Murray P.J. Wynn T.A. Protective and pathogenic functions of macrophage subsets.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2011; 11: 723-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (3323) Google Scholar). It has been well documented that during acute inflammation the macrophages are stimulated by toll-like receptor ligands (LPS) and IFN-γ, undergo classical M1 activation, and secrete high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, reactive nitrogen, and oxygen intermediates. All these factors promote Th1 response, and then enhance microbicidal and tumoricidal activity (as “killer” cells) (3Mills C.D. Kincaid K. Alt J.M. Heilman M.J. Hill A.M.

Interestingly, more and more evidence shows that macrophages not only play a role in the defense mechanism but also are involved in the promotion of tissue remodeling, vasculogenesis, and tumor progression, which are defined as the alternatively activated macrophages (5Gordon S.

When stimulated by the Th2 cytokines, such as IL-4 and IL-13, macrophages express an alternative M2 activation state, which is characterized by expressing a higher level of the anti-inflammatory cytokine, such as IL-10, and a lower level of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-12. Meanwhile, the up-regulation of cell-surface mannose receptor (MRC1/CD206), hemoglobin/haptoglobin scavenger receptor (CD163), and the activity of arginase-1 are identified in M2 macrophage (3Mills C.D.

In addition to functioning in normal tissues, macrophages are also a major cellular component of the tumor microenvironment, where they are commonly termed as tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). 4The abbreviations used are: TAMtumor associated macrophageAAMalternatively activated macrophage; MSILACstable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell cultureZbenzyloxycarbonylfmkfluoromethyl ketoneBMDMbone marrow-derived macrophageLlightHheavyiNOSinduced nitric-oxide synthasePPARperoxisome proliferator-activated receptorGOBPGO biological processPMperitoneal macrophageMMTVmurine mammary tumor virus. Despite the role of macrophages in ingesting pathogens, many reports showed that these TAMs act as a source of systemic and local cues to promote the proliferation, survival, migration, and invasion of cancer cells and support tumor angiogenesis and suppression of antitumor immunity (8Qian B.-Z.

The role of tumor-associated macrophages in breast cancer progression (review).Int. J. Oncol. 2013; 43: 5-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). This tumor-promoting function of TAMs is consistent with clinical research that discovered a high density of macrophages in many cancer types, which are considered to be related to increased tumor vascularization, metastasis, and a poor prognosis (11Bingle L.

Furthermore, more evidence revealed that deficiencies in caspase-6 did not result in aberrant expression of other caspases in vivo. This is due to the fact that caspase-8 can compensate developmentally for the absence of caspase-6 in constitutive knock-out animals (23Wong B.K. Ehrnhoefer D.E. Graham R.K. Martin D.D. Ladha S. Uribe V. Stanek L.M. Franciosi S. Qiu X. Deng Y. Kovalik V. Zhang W. Pouladi M.A. Shihabuddin L.S. Hayden M.R.

Med. 2000; 6: 1241-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). All the evidence indicated that Caspase-6 is dispensable for the induction of apoptosis. Furthermore, unlike Caspase-3 and Caspase-7, recent studies have suggested an alternative non-apoptotic role for Caspase-6. For instance, by modifying cell cycle entry, Caspase-6 also regulates B cell activation and differentiation into plasma cells (25Watanabe C. Shu G.L. Zheng T.S. Flavell R.A. Clark E.A. Caspase-6 regulates B cell activation and differentiation into plasma cells.J. Immunol. 2008; 181: 6810-6819Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar); additionally, Caspase-6 also plays critical roles in polymorphonuclear neutrophil-driven macrophage activation through the cleavage of IL-1 receptor-associated kinase M (26Kobayashi H. Nolan A. Naveed B. Hoshino Y. Segal L.N. Fujita Y. Rom W.N. Weiden M.D. Neutrophils activate alveolar macrophages by producing caspase-6-mediated cleavage of IL-1 receptor-associated kinase-M.J. Immunol. 2011; 186: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). All in all, the latest evidence suggests that Caspase-6 indeed has important roles in regulating non-apoptotic cellular events. Despite the important role of Caspase-6 in immunological regulation, there is still no evidence demonstrating whether Caspase-6 plays any role in the alternative activation of macrophages. In this study, we first employed the proteomics analysis in conjunction with SILAC-based LC-MS/MS (27Ong S.-E. Mann M. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics turns quantitative.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2005; 1: 252-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar) to systematically investigate the profile of differentially expressed proteins in IL-4-treated macrophages. This quantitative approach provided a whole picture of the expression patterns of 3317 proteins, among which the expression level of Caspase-6 was dramatically increased in macrophages treated with IL-4. We further demonstrated that Caspase-6 could regulate alternative activation of macrophages and enhance the pro-invasiveness signature of TAMs by regulating the level of anti-inflammatory cytokines and matrix metalloproteinase, such as MMP-2 and MMP-9. Inhibition of Caspase-6 reversed the anti-inflammatory phenotype of M2 and TAMs to some extent and rescued the TAM-induced MMP-2 and MMP-9 increase and tumor cell invasion. Collectively, our findings primarily revealed a new role for Caspase-6 in regulating alternatively activated macrophages and novel molecular events, which suggested that Caspase-6 might serve as a key therapeutic target in future cancer immunotherapy. Previous studies have indicated that macrophages undergo alternative M2 activation when stimulated with Th2 cytokines, such as IL-4 and IL-13, in vitro. Importantly, these “alternatively” activated cells initiate the synthesis of arginase-1, an enzyme that suppresses NO generation and promotes them to release ornithine, which is a critical mediator in the wound-healing response (3Mills C.D.

Martinez F.O. Alternative activation of macrophages: mechanism and functions.Immunity. 2010; 32: 593-604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2799) Google Scholar). Indeed, here, after 12 or 24 h of exposure to IL-4 (10 ng/ml), RAW264.7 cells showed significantly elevated activity of arginase-1 (Fig. 1A), as measured by an arginase-1 activity assay kit, suggesting an M2-activated state of RAW264.7 cells. The activation of arginase-1 was further confirmed by quantitative real time-PCR, in which the messenger RNA level of arginase-1 was remarkably up-regulated (Fig. 1B), similar to the elevation level of arginase-1 activity measured by an arginase-1 activity assay kit. In addition, previous studies showed that IL-10 is not only able to stimulate M2c cells activation, but also an important product from M2a (5Gordon S. Martinez F.O. Alternative activation of macrophages: mechanism and functions.Immunity. 2010; 32: 593-604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2799) Google Scholar). Here, we consistently observed that in IL-4-stimulated RAW246.7 cells, both mRNA and protein levels of IL-10 were significantly enhanced (Fig. 1, C and D). Another signature molecule for the M2 state of macrophage is the mannose receptor (also known as CD206), which was also dramatically up-regulated in IL-4-stimulated RAW264.7 cells (Fig. 1E), suggesting a successful induction of M2 macrophages. Furthermore, we also tested the phagocytotic ability of macrophages by flow cytometry analysis, as its M2 macrophages generally have decreased phagocytotic capacity. Results shown in Fig. 1F, confirmed that the phagocytotic ability of RAW246.7 cells was significantly down-regulated after IL-4 stimulation. Taken together, these experimental data of molecular and functional studies indicated that stimulation of RAW264.7 cells with IL-4 was a successful method to acquire alternatively M2-activated macrophages that possess specific phenotypes. To further exploring the modulated proteins and functional phenotype of the alternatively activated macrophages, quantitative proteomic analysis was performed in conjunction with SILAC-based LC-MS/MS to acquire the relative changes in comprehensive protein expression profile of IL-4-induced alternatively activated macrophages (28Cox J. Matic I. Hilger M. Nagaraj N. Selbach M. Olsen J.V. Mann M. A practical guide to the MaxQuant computational platform for SILAC-based quantitative proteomics.Nat.

MaxQuant enables high peptide identification rates, individualized ppb-range mass accuracies and proteome-wide protein quantification.Nat. Biotechnol. 2008; 26: 1367-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (9154) Google Scholar). SILAC analysis work flow was displayed in Fig. 2A. To start, macrophages were labeled with heavy isotopes of l-13C6-lysine and l-13C615N4-arginine (Lys-6/Arg-10) or light isotopes of l-12C6-lysine and l-12C6 14N4-arginine (Lys-0/Arg-0), respectively. The Lys-0/Arg-0 labeled (L) cells were treated with IL-4 (10 ng/ml) for 24 h, and the Lys-6/Arg-10-labeled (H) cells were used as control. Following this, identification and quantification of whole cell lysate proteins of the IL-4-induced group or the control group were performed by LC-MS/MS. All final proteomic results were generated based on four independent biological experiments R1, R2, R3, and R4. The combined 96 raw data were searched using the Andromeda search engine with 99% confidence (p < 0.01) (30Cox J. Mann M. 1D and 2D annotation enrichment: a statistical method integrating quantitative proteomics with complementary high-throughput data.BMC Bioinformatics. 2012; 13: S12Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar), after removing pollutants, reverse assignments, and proteins without unique peptides. In total, we identified 3317 proteins in this study, and 2400 proteins (72%) were identified in at least two replicates (Fig. 2B). Only protein ratios (H/L) <0.67 were regarded as up-regulated, and these were marked in blue, and protein ratios (H/L) >1.5 was considered to be down-regulated, and there were marked in red. Finally, we obtained 62 proteins that were up-regulated and 32 proteins that were down-regulated after IL-4 challenge (supplemental Table 1). In addition, we further manually annotated the up- and down-regulated proteins into several functional categories. These proteins were categorized using the GO biological process (GOBP) and the KEGG enrichment analysis (31Carmona-Saez P. Chagoyen M. Tirado F. Carazo J.M. Pascual-Montano A. GENECODIS: a web-based tool for finding significant concurrent annotations in gene lists.Genome Biol. 2007; 8: R3Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). As demonstrated in Fig. 2C, the up-regulated proteins are shown by blue dots, and the down-regulated proteins are shown by red dots. GOBP and KEGG results indicated that the differentially expressed proteins were predominantly involved in RNA transport, nitrogen compound transport, ion transport, phagosome, cytoskeleton organization, macromolecular complex subunit organization, actin filament-based process, single-organism biosynthetic process, small molecule metabolic process, etc., which provided clues for future research on exploring the detailed mechanisms underlying the activation of AAMs. Importantly, among the changed proteins, the well known key players during macrophage phagocytosis such as CD14, Lamp1, and Lamp2 were significantly down-regulated (supplemental Table 1), which further supports the credibility of the proteomics analysis in this research. Furthermore, by quantitative RT-PCR, we validated the mRNA levels of the proteins having expression profiles with more significant changes in the up- and down-regulated proteins. As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, among the up-regulated proteins Caspase-6 was remarkably increased. By closely looking into Caspase-6, we found that the change of Caspase-6 was strictly repeatable in three independent biological replicates (Table 1). Thus, we decided to focus on Caspase-6, which was often regarded as a pro-apoptosis executor; however, the role of Caspase-6 in alternatively activated macrophages has never been revealed before.TABLE 1Quantitative proteomic data of caspase-6Protein IDProtein nameRatio H/L normalizedRatio H/L countGroup 1IPI00115542Caspase-6; apoptotic protease0.303125Group 2Mch-2; caspase-6 subunit0.346413Group 3p18; caspase-6 subunit p110.374791 Open table in a new tab Our quantitative proteomics data had indicated that the protein levels of Caspase-6 were remarkably enriched in IL-4-induced alternatively M2-activated macrophages. To further confirm the proteomics data, we performed immunoblot assays with macrophages in the presence of IL-4. As shown in Fig. 4A, consistent with the proteomics data, the protein levels of Caspase-6 were significantly increased in IL-4-induced macrophages. Previous studies have indicated that Caspase-6 is a cysteine protease, and the functions of Caspase-6 are tightly related to its enzymatic activity (15Orth K. Chinnaiyan A.M. Garg M. Froelich C.J. Dixit V.M. The CED-3/ICE-like protease Mch2 is activated during apoptosis and cleaves the death substrate lamin A.J. Biol.

Hence, we explored whether the enzymatic activity of Caspase-6 is increased in alternatively activated macrophages. Because Caspase-6 was cleaved during its activation process (17Li J. Yuan J. Caspases in apoptosis and beyond.Oncogene. 2008; 27: 6194-6206Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar), we detected the 18-kDa cleaved form of Caspase-6 by using the appropriate antibody. As revealed in Fig. 4A, we indeed detected the 18-kDa cleaved form of Caspase-6 in alternatively activated macrophages, but not in the control, suggesting Caspase-6 was activated during IL-4-induced alternative macrophage activation. Moreover, to confirm Western blotting results, we further tested the Caspase-6 activity in IL-4-induced alternatively activated macrophages by using a fluorometric assay kit. As expected, in macrophages under the challenge of IL-4, the activity of Caspase-6 increased strikingly (Fig. 4B). As we showed above that Caspase-6 is cleaved and activated during M2 macrophage activation, we further investigated whether this event leads to apoptosis, the major role of Caspase-6. Interestingly, flow cytometry results indicated that these macrophages did not undergo apoptosis (Fig. 4C), suggesting that caspase-6 may play its non-apoptosis physiological roles in alternatively activated macrophages. According to the results above, the up-regulated enzymatic activity and expression of caspase-6 induced by IL-4 did not lead to apoptosis of macrophages. The non-apoptosis role of caspase-6 was also reported previously in B lymphocyte cells and macrophages (20Uribe V. Wong B.K. Graham R.K. Cusack C.L. Skotte N.H. Pouladi M.A. Xie Y. Feinberg K. Ou Y.

However, it remains largely unknown how caspase-6 plays an important role in regulating the alternative activation of macrophages. To explore the potential function(s) of caspase-6 in mediating alternatively activated macrophages, we utilized Z-VEID-fmk, a caspase-6 enzymatic activity inhibitor (Casp-6i), in combination with IL-4. After co-incubation with IL-4 and Casp-6i, the macrophages displayed a significant reduction in mRNA levels of arginase-1, IL-10, MMP-2, MMP-9 (Fig. 5A), and arginase-1 activity (Fig. 5B) as compared with IL-4 alone treatment, which were anti-inflammatory cytokines expressed by M2 macrophages (3Mills C.D.

In addition, the protein levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were also reduced by Casp-6i (Fig. 5C). Similar results were acquired in the experiments where macrophages were transfected with scramble siRNA or siRNA specifically against caspase-6 (Casp-6si) prior to stimulus of IL-4. Results show that Casp-6si largely blocked the increased mRNA levels of arginase-1, IL-10, MMP-2, MMP-9 (Fig. 5, D and F), and arginase-1 activities (Fig. 5E), which were induced by IL-4, compared with scramble siRNA.

In this study, the β-defensin (Lhβ-defensin) gene was cloned from spleen tissue of soiny mullet (Liza haematocheila). Lhβ-defensin cDNA was 747 bp in length, encoding 63 amino acids. Sequence alignment revealed that Lhβ-defensin contained six conserved cysteine residues and shared 97.5% sequence identities with grouper (Epinephelus coioides) β-defensin. Realtime PCR revealed that Lhβ-defensin was highest expressed in the immune related organs, such as spleen, kidney and gut of healthy fish. Following Streptococcus dysgalactiae infection, Lhβ-defensin was up-regulated in immune related organs, e.g. 17.6-fold in spleen and 10.87-fold in gut at 24 h post infection (hpi). Lhβ-defensin possessed a monomeric structure of a three-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet and an α-helix stabilized by three disulfide bonds formed by Cys30-Cys58, Cys36-Cys52, and Cys40-Cys59. In addition to the experimental work, computer simulation was also carried out to determine the possible conformation of β-defensin and its interaction with palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylglycerol (POPG), a model of bacteria membrane. The Lhβ-defensin was found to form dimeric structure stabilized by the van der Waals contacts of Leu35 and Cys37 in two anti-parallel β1-strands and the cation-π interaction between Tyr32 and Arg54 respectively in the two β1-strands. The most important interactions between β-defensin and membrane are the electrostatic interactions between Arg residues in β-defensin and head group of POPG bilayer as well as hydrogen bond interactions between them. Our results were useful for further understanding the potential mechanism of antimicrobial property of fish β-defensins."

However, the existence of the rhythms of expression of the genes that underlie the endocrine mechanisms responsible for processes such as steroidogenesis and reproduction in fish have still been poorly explored to date. Here we investigated the daily pattern of the expression of key genes involved in sex steroid production that ultimately set the sex ratio in fish. Adult zebrafish were maintained under a 12:12 h light-dark cycle at a constant temperature of 27°C and were sampled every 4 h during a 24-hour cycle. The expression of key genes in the gonads and brains of female and male individuals were analyzed. In gonads, the expression of aromatase (cyp19a1a, ovarian aromatase) and the antimüllerian hormone (amh, testis) was rhythmic, with almost opposite acrophases: ZT 5:13 h (in the light phase) and ZT 15:39 h (at night), respectively. The expression of foxl2 (forkhead box L2) was also rhythmic in the ovary (acrophase located at ZT 5:02 h) and the expression of dmrt1 (doublesex and mab-3-related transcription factor 1) was rhythmic in testes (acrophase at ZT 18:36 h). In the brain, cyp19a1b (brain aromatase) and cyp11b (11beta-hydroxylase) presented daily differences, especially in males, where the expression peaked at night. These results provide the first evidence for marked time-of-the-day-dependent differences in the expression of the genes involved in sex ratio control, which should be considered when investigating processes such as reproduction, sex differentiation and steroidogenesis in fish."

Splicing-site mutation was confirmed with RT-PCR. UPD was detected by haplotype analysis. Follow-up study was performed through telephone for 27 patients. Results Out of 20 patients, macrocephaly, classic MRI features, motor development delay and cognitive impairment were detected in 20(100%), 20(100%), 17(85%) and 4(20%) patients, respectively. 20(100%) were clinically diagnosed with MLC. 19(95%) were genetically diagnosed with 10 novel mutations in MLC1, MLC1 and GlialCAM mutations were identified in 15 and 4 patients, respectively. Deletion mutation from exon4 to exon9 and a homozygous point mutation due to maternal UPD of chromosome22 in MLC1 were found firstly. c.598-2A>C in MLC1 leads to the skip of exon8. c.772-1G>C in MLC1 accounting for 15.5%(9/58) alleles in Chinese patients might be a founder or a hot-spot mutation. Out of 27 patients in the follow-up study, head circumference was ranged from 56cm to 61cm in patients older than 5yeas old, with a median of 57cm. Motor development delay and cognitive impairment were detected in 22(81.5%) and 5(18.5%) patients, respectively. Motor and cognitive deterioration was found in 5 (18.5%) and 2 patients (7.4%), respectively. Improvements and MRI recovery were first found in Chinese patients. Rate of seizures (45.5%), transient motor retrogress (45.5%) and unconsciousness (13.6%) after head trauma was much higher than that after fever (18.2%, 9.1%, 0%, respectively).

Additionally, MRSA screening was performed from the hospital staff and the environment. To identify the reason for the outbreak, work-related, psychological and behavioral factors were investigated by impartial audits and staff interviews.Thirty-one MRSA cases were registered during the study period, and 36 isolates were investigated. Molecular typing determined the outbreak strain (phage type 54/812, PFGE type A4, spa type t003) and identified the probable index case. Nasal carriage in one employee and a high environmental contamination with the outbreak strain was documented. Important gaps in nursing procedures and general management were identified. Elevated stress levels and communication problems preceded the outbreak. Compliance with hand hygiene and isolation procedures was evaluated as appropriate.This study demonstrates the complexity of controlling hospital-associated infections. The combined use of different typing methods is beneficial for outbreak investigations. Psychological, behavioral and other work-related factors have an important impact on the spread of nosocomial pathogens. These factors should be addressed and integrated in routine infection control practice."

The aim of the study was to investigate the association between social capital and pain-related measures.15,474 subjects older than 15 years were personally interviewed on subjective health, quality of life, health behaviour, and utilisation of healthcare in the Austrian Health Interview Survey. An indicator for cognitive social capital at the individual level consisting of nine questions targeted at different social resources was built and its association with pain-related items analysed.Odds ratios, adjusted for age, chronic diseases, and educational level for having suffered from severe pain in the last 12 months were 2.02 (95% CI 1.77-2.03) in the lowest tertile and 1.30 (95% CI 1.14-1.47) in the middle tertile of social capital for men. The corresponding odds ratios for women were 2.28 (95% CI 2.01-2.59) and 1.30 (95% CI 1.15-1.46). In both sexes, pain intensity increased significantly with decreasing level of social capital. The proportion of subjects that have been on sick leave in the last 12 months due to pain were 16.3%, 12.0%, and 7.7% (P<0.001) from lowest to highest tertile of social capital in men, and 16.5%, 12.3%, and 6.7%, respectively (P<0.001) in women.Our findings indicate that low cognitive social capital at individual level is significantly associated not only with higher prevalence of pain and higher pain intensity, but also with a higher chance for sick leave due to pain in employed subjects."
https://openalex.org/W2468336468,"Background Human Campylobacter jejuni infections are progressively rising worldwide. Information about the molecular mechanisms underlying campylobacteriosis, however, are limited. In the present study we investigated whether cytokines such as IL-23, IL-22 and IL-18, which share pivotal functions in host immunity, were involved in mediating intestinal and systemic immunopathological responses upon C. jejuni infection. Methodology/Principal Findings To assure stable infection, gnotobiotic (i.e. secondary abiotic) IL-23p19-/-, IL-22-/- and IL-18-/- mice were generated by broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment. Following peroral C. jejuni strain 81–176 infection, mice of all genotypes harbored comparably high pathogenic loads in their intestines. As compared to wildtype controls, however, IL-18-/- mice displayed less distinct C. jejuni induced sequelae as indicated by less pronounced large intestinal shrinkage and lower numbers of apoptotic cells in the colonic epithelial layer at day 8 postinfection (p.i.). Furthermore, lower colonic numbers of adaptive immune cells including regulatory T cells and B lymphocytes were accompanied by less distinct secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF and IFN-γ and lower IL-17A mRNA expression levels in colonic ex vivo biopsies of infected IL-18-/- as compared to wildtype mice. Upon C. jejuni infection, colonic IL-23p19 expression was up-regulated in IL-18-/- mice only, whereas IL-22 mRNA levels were lower in uninfected and infected IL-23p19-/- as well as infected IL-18-/- as compared to respective wildtype control mice. Remarkably, not only intestinal, but also systemic infection-induced immune responses were less pronounced in IL-18-/- mice as indicated by lower TNF, IFN-γ and IL-6 serum levels as compared to wildtype mice. Conclusion/Significance We here show for the first time that IL-18 is essentially involved in mediating C. jejuni infection in the gnotobiotic mouse model.

The use of baseline dopamine D1 and D2/3 receptor binding potential (BPND) as a proxy for dopaminergic tone is problematic because they reflect both endogenous dopamine levels (a change in radiotracer's apparent affinity) and receptor density. In this analysis of 31 healthy controls genotyped for the Val158Met polymorphism (Val/Val, Val/Met, and Met/Met), we used amphetamine-induced displacement of [11C]FLB 457 as a direct measure of dopamine release. Our analysis failed to show a relationship between COMT genotype status and prefrontal cortical dopamine release. COMT genotype was also not predictive of baseline dopamine D2/3 receptor BPND."

Whilst this information is material to the donation decision, it may also be perceived as coercive.Randomised, double blind, controlled trial in which community members watched one of two videos of a simulated organ donation conversation that differed only in the amount of information provided about the benefits of donation. Participants then completed a questionnaire about the adequacy of the information provided and the degree to which they felt the doctor was trying to convince the family member to say yes to donation.There was a wide variability in what participants considered was the ""right"" amount of information about organ donation. Those who watched the conversation that included information about the benefits of donation were more likely to feel that the information provided to the family was sufficient. They were more likely to report that the doctor was trying to convince the family member to say yes to donation, yet were no more likely to feel uncomfortable or to feel that the doctor was uncaring or cared more about transplant recipients than he did for the patient and their family.This study suggests that community members are comfortable with health care staff providing information to family members that may be influential in supporting them to give consent for donation."
https://openalex.org/W2471454986,"Objective Our study aims to identify metabolic markers associated with either a gain in abdominal (measured by waist circumference) or peripheral (measured by hip circumference) body fat mass. Methods Data of 4 126 weight-gaining adults (18–75 years) from three population-based, prospective German cohort studies (EPIC, KORA, DEGS) were analysed regarding a waist-gaining (WG) or hip-gaining phenotype (HG). The phenotypes were obtained by calculating the differences of annual changes in waist minus hip circumference. The difference was displayed for all cohorts. The highest 10% of this difference were defined as WG whereas the lowest 10% were defined as HG. A total of 121 concordant metabolite measurements were conducted using Biocrates AbsoluteIDQ® kits in EPIC and KORA. Sex-specific associations with metabolite concentration as independent and phenotype as the dependent variable adjusted for confounders were calculated. The Benjamini-Hochberg method was used to correct for multiple testing. Results Across studies both sexes gained on average more waist than hip circumference. We could identify 12 metabolites as being associated with the WG (n = 8) or HG (n = 4) in men, but none were significant after correction for multiple testing; 45 metabolites were associated with the WG (n = 41) or HG (n = 4) in women. For WG, n = 21 metabolites remained significant after correction for multiple testing. Respective odds ratios (OR) ranged from 0.66 to 0.73 for tryptophan, the diacyl-phosphatidylcholines (PC) C32:3, C36:0, C38:0, C38:1, C42:2, C42:5, the acyl-alkyl-PCs C32:2, C34:0, C36:0, C36:1, C36:2, C38:0, C38:2, C40:1, C40:2, C40:5, C40:6, 42:2, C42:3 and lyso-PC C17:0. Conclusion Both weight-gaining men and women showed a clear tendency to gain more abdominal than peripheral fat. Gain of abdominal fat seems to be related to an initial metabolic state reflected by low concentrations of specific metabolites, at least in women. Thus, higher levels of specific PCs may play a protective role in gaining waist circumference."
https://openalex.org/W2470934762,"Ly-6A/Stem cell antigen-1 (Ly-6A/Sca-1) is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein expressed on many cell types including hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and early lymphoid-specific progenitors. Ly-6A/Sca-1 is expressed on CD4+ T cells and plays a role in regulating cellular responses to foreign antigens. The role of Ly-6A/Sca-1 in primary antibody responses has not been defined. To investigate whether Ly-6A/Sca-1 functions in humoral immunity, we first injected Ly-6A/Sca-1-deficient and wild-type control mice with chicken ovalbumin (c-Ova) protein mixed with an adjuvant. We then assessed the ability of the mice to generate a primary antibody response against cOva. We further examined the development of B cells and circulating antibody isotypes in non-immunized Ly-6A/Sca-1deficient mice to determine if Ly6A/Sca-1 functions in development irrespective of antigen-specific immune activation. Ly-6A/Sca-1/Sca-1-deficient mice did not show any significant changes in the number of B lymphocytes in the bone marrow and peripheral lymphoid tissues. Interestingly, Ly-6A/Sca-1/Sca-1-/- mice have significantly elevated serum levels of IgA with λ light chains compared to wild type controls. B cell clusters with high reactivity to anti-IgA λ monoclonal antibody were detected in the lamina propria of the gut, though this was not observed in the bone marrow and peripheral lymphoid tissues. Despite these differences, the Ly-6A/Sca-1deficient mice generated a similar primary antibody response when compared to the wild-type mice. In summary, we conclude that the primary antibody response to cOva antigen is similar in Ly-6A/Sca-1deficient and sufficient mice. In addition, we report significantly higher expression of the immunoglobulin λ light chain by B cells in lamina propria of Ly-6A/Sca-1deficient mice when compared to the wild-type control."
https://openalex.org/W2460137185,"The traditional figure of Black Pete seen during the December festivities around Sinterklaas (the Dutch Santa Claus) in the Netherlands has sparked fierce debates about his racial stereotypical characteristics and his potentially negative effects on children's opinions about black people. The Black Pete phenomenon has even been discussed by the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, resulting in a report urging the Netherlands to eliminate this form of racial stereotyping. The adult debate about Black Pete is clearly important, but Sinterklaas is essentially a children's holiday. Surprisingly, there have never been any systematic studies to examine children's views on Black Pete. The current study is the first to do so. In a sample of 201 children aged 5-7 years, we collected free descriptions of Black Pete, asked children to group him in relation to other figures, and to assign characteristics to him and comparison figures. The results showed that (1) Children are clearly aware of Black Pete's skin color and subordinate status; (2) Children associate Black Pete more with clowns than with black people; (3) Children evaluate Black Pete very positively, but the positive characteristics do not generalize to their evaluation of black people. The findings illustrate the deep-rooted childhood origins of many Dutch people's affection for Black Pete and their lack of awareness of his relation to racial stereotypes. This explains the resistance to changing the Black Pete figure and the slowness of the change process on this front."
