https://openalex.org/W2785649357,"Air pollution evolution Transport-derived emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) have decreased owing to stricter controls on air pollution. This means that the relative importance of chemicals in pesticides, coatings, printing inks, adhesives, cleaning agents, and personal care products has increased. McDonald et al. show that these volatile chemical products now contribute fully one-half of emitted VOCs in 33 industrialized cities (see the Perspective by Lewis). Thus, the focus of efforts to mitigate ozone formation and toxic chemical burdens need to be adjusted. Science , this issue p. 760 ; see also p. 744"

The majority of these, however, have taken place at relatively small experimental scales. Winfree et al. looked across more than 3000 square kilometers for relationships between biodiversity and crop pollination (see the Perspective by Kremen). The number of wild bee species required for successful pollination rapidly increased with spatial scale, largely owing to variation in the species present across sites and the degree to which the most abundant species played a role. In the end, more than an order of magnitude more species than predicted by smaller-scale experiments were required for full ecosystem functioning. Science , this issue p. 791 ; see also p. 741"

The construction of intracellular memory devices, however, is challenging. Tang and Liu used Cas9 nucleases and base editors to record amplitude, duration, and order of stimuli as stable changes in both genomic and extrachromosomal DNA content (see the Perspective by Ho and Bennett). The recording of multiple stimuli—including exposure to antibiotics, nutrients, viruses, and light, as well as Wnt signaling—was achieved in living bacterial and human cells. Recorded memories could be erased and re-recorded over multiple cycles. Science , this issue p. eaap8992 ; see also p. 150"

Patients have spontaneous seizures and risk developing serious cognitive impairment. Bui et al. studied an animal model of temporal lobe epilepsy (see the Perspective by Scharfman). Selective optogenetic inhibition of dentate gyrus mossy cells increased the likelihood of electrographic seizures generalizing to full behavioral convulsive seizures. Activation of mossy cells reduced the likelihood. Thus, the activity of mossy cells might serve to inhibit seizure propagation. Science , this issue p. 787 ; see also p. 740"
https://openalex.org/W2787609467,"Estimating the predictability of evolution Evolution results from expected effects, such as selection driving alleles toward fixation, and stochastic effects, such as unusual environmental variation and genetic drift. To determine the potential to predict evolutionary change, Nosil et al. examined three naturally occurring morphs of stick insects (see the Perspective by Reznick and Travis). They wanted to determine which selective parameters could be used to foresee changes, despite varying environmental conditions. One morph fit a model of negative frequency-dependent selection, likely owing to predation, but changes in other morph frequencies remained unpredictable. Thus, for specific cases, we can forecast short-term changes within populations, but evolution is more difficult to predict when it involves a balance between multiple selective factors and uncertainty in environmental conditions.

https://openalex.org/W2793870188,"Reducing tillage and growing cover crops, widely recommended practices for boosting soil health, have major impacts on soil communities. Surprisingly little is known about their impacts on soil microbial functional diversity, and especially so in irrigated Mediterranean ecosystems. In long-term experimental plots at the West Side Research and Extension Center in California's Central Valley, we characterized soil microbial communities in the presence or absence of physical disturbance due to tillage, in the presence or absence of cover crops, and at three depths: 0-5, 5-15 and 15-30 cm. This characterization included qPCR for bacterial and archaeal abundances, DNA sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene, and phylogenetic estimation of two ecologically important microbial traits (rRNA gene copy number and genome size). Total (bacterial + archaeal) diversity was higher in no-till than standard till; diversity increased with depth in no-till but decreased with depth in standard till. Total bacterial numbers were higher in cover cropped plots at all depths, while no-till treatments showed higher numbers in 0-5 cm but lower numbers at lower depths compared to standard tillage. Trait estimates suggested that different farming practices and depths favored distinctly different microbial life strategies. Tillage in the absence of cover crops shifted microbial communities towards fast growing competitors, while no-till shifted them toward slow growing stress tolerators. Across all treatment combinations, increasing depth resulted in a shift towards stress tolerators. Cover crops shifted the communities towards ruderals-organisms with wider metabolic capacities and moderate rates of growth. Overall, our results are consistent with decreasing nutrient availability with soil depth and under no-till treatments, bursts of nutrient availability and niche homogenization under standard tillage, and increases in C supply and variety provided by cover crops. Understanding how agricultural practices shift microbial abundance, diversity and life strategies, such as presented here, can assist with designing farming systems that can support high yields, while enhancing C sequestration and increasing resilience to climate change."

Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies form hexamers on cell surfaces that have high avidity for the C1 complex.

https://openalex.org/W2786461673,"How lipopolysaccharides bridge the gap The outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria is composed of lipopolysaccharide, a large glycolipid that prevents drugs from entering the cells. Disrupting lipopolysaccharide assembly hypersensitizes bacteria to antibiotics. Sherman et al. used biochemical tools to observe lipopolysaccharide transport. Seven proteins, which are conserved in all Gram-negative bacteria, appear to form a protein bridge that uses adenosine triphosphate to power transport of lipopolysaccharide from one membrane to another. The ability to monitor intermembrane transport of lipopolysaccharide will help in efforts to develop and characterize inhibitors. Science , this issue p. 798"
https://openalex.org/W2785527513,"Human mesenchymal stem cell (hMSC)-derived exosomes have shown regenerative effects, but their role in osteogenesis and the underlying mechanism are yet to be determined. In this study, we examined the time-course secretion of exosomes by hMSCs during the entire process of osteogenic differentiation. Exosomes derived from hMSCs in various stages of osteogenic differentiation committed homotypic cells to differentiate towards osteogenic lineage, but only exosomes from late stages of osteogenic differentiation induced extracellular matrix mineralisation. Exosomes from expansion and early and late stages of osteogenic differentiation were internalised by a subpopulation of hMSCs. MicroRNA profiling revealed a set of differentially expressed exosomal microRNAs from the late stage of osteogenic differentiation, which were osteogenesis related. Target prediction demonstrated that these microRNAs enriched pathways involved in regulation of osteogenic differentiation and general mechanisms how exosomes exert their functions, such as ""Wnt signalling pathway"" and ""endocytosis"". Taken together, the results show that MSCs secrete exosomes with different biological properties depending on differentiation stage of their parent cells. The exosomal cargo transferred from MSCs in the late stage of differentiation induces osteogenic differentiation and mineralisation. Moreover, it is suggested that the regulatory effect on osteogenesis by exosomes is at least partly exerted by exosomal microRNA."

Liang et al. show that a gas of Rydberg atoms—a cloud of rubidium atoms excited by a sequence of laser pulses—can induce strong interactions between propagating photons. The authors could tune the strength of the interaction to make the photons form dimer and trimer bound states.

https://openalex.org/W2793128671,"Bacillus amyloliquefaciens QST713 and B. firmus I-1582 are bacterial strains which are used as active ingredients of commercially-available soil application and seed treatment products Serenade® and VOTiVO®, respectively. These bacteria colonize plant roots promoting plant growth and offering protection against pathogens/pests. The objective of this study was to develop a qPCR protocol to quantitate the dynamics of root colonization by these two strains under field conditions. Primers and TaqMan® probes were designed based on genome comparisons of the two strains with publicly-available and unpublished bacterial genomes of the same species. An optimized qPCR protocol was developed to quantify bacterial colonization of corn roots after seed treatment. Treated corn seeds were planted in non-sterile soil in the greenhouse and grown for 28 days. Specific detection of bacteria was quantified weekly, and showed stable colonization between ~104–105 CFU/g during the experimental period for both bacteria, and the protocol detected as low as 103 CFU/g bacteria on roots. In a separate experiment, streptomycin-resistant QST713 and rifampicin-resistant I-1582 strains were used to compare dilution-plating on TSA with the newly developed qPCR method. Results also indicated that the presence of natural microflora and another inoculated strain does not affect root colonization of either one of these strains. The same qPCR protocol was used to quantitate root colonization by QST713 and I-1582 in two corn and two soybean varieties grown in the field. Both bacteria were quantitated up to two weeks after seeds were planted in the field and there were no significant differences in root colonization in either bacteria strain among varieties. Results presented here confirm that the developed qPCR protocol can be successfully used to understand dynamics of root colonization by these bacteria in plants growing in growth chamber, greenhouse and the field."
https://openalex.org/W2787656293,"Current textbook knowledge holds that the structural scope of ribosomal biosynthesis is based exclusively on α-amino acid backbone topology. Here we report the genome-guided discovery of bacterial pathways that posttranslationally create β-amino acid-containing products. The transformation is widespread in bacteria and is catalyzed by an enzyme belonging to a previously uncharacterized radical S-adenosylmethionine family. We show that the β-amino acids result from an unusual protein splicing process involving backbone carbon-carbon bond cleavage and net excision of tyramine. The reaction can be used to incorporate diverse and multiple β-amino acids into genetically encoded precursors in Escherichia coli In addition to enlarging the set of basic amino acid components, the excision generates keto functions that are useful as orthogonal reaction sites for chemical diversification."
https://openalex.org/W2789938108,"Background While most individuals wish to die at home, the reality is that most will die in hospital. Aim To determine whether receiving a physician home visit near the end-of-life is associated with lower odds of death in a hospital. Design Observational retrospective cohort study, examining location of death and health care in the last year of life. Setting/Participants Population-level study of Ontarians, a Canadian province with over 13 million residents. All decedents from April 1, 2010 to March 31, 2013 (n = 264,754) Results More than half of 264,754 decedents died in hospital: 45.7% died in an acute care hospital and 7.7% in complex continuing care. After adjustment for multiple factors–including patient illness, home care services, and days of being at home–receiving at least one physician home visit from a non-palliative care physician was associated with a 47% decreased odds (odds-ratio, 0.53; 95%CI: 0.51–0.55) of dying in a hospital. When a palliative care physician specialist was involved, the overall odds declined by 59% (odds ratio, 0.41; 95%CI: 0.39–0.43). The same model, adjusting for physician home visits, showed that receiving palliative home care was associated with a similar reduction (odds ratio, 0.49; 95%CI: 0.47–0.51). Conclusion Location of death is strongly associated with end-of-life health care in the home. Less than one-third of the population, however, received end-of-life home care or a physician visit in their last year of life, revealing large room for improvement."
https://openalex.org/W2786479777,"As a major component of plant cell walls, lignin is a potential renewable source of valuable chemicals. Several sphingomonad bacteria have been identified that can break the β-aryl ether bond connecting most phenylpropanoid units of the lignin heteropolymer. Here, we tested three sphingomonads predicted to be capable of breaking the β-aryl ether bond of the dimeric aromatic compound guaiacylglycerol-β-guaiacyl ether (GGE) and found that Novosphingobium aromaticivorans metabolizes GGE at one of the fastest rates thus far reported. After the ether bond of racemic GGE is broken by replacement with a thioether bond involving glutathione, the glutathione moiety must be removed from the resulting two stereoisomers of the phenylpropanoid conjugate β-glutathionyl-γ-hydroxypropiovanillone (GS-HPV). We found that the Nu-class glutathione S-transferase NaGSTNu is the only enzyme needed to remove glutathione from both (R)- and (S)-GS-HPV in N. aromaticivorans. We solved the crystal structure of NaGSTNu and used molecular modeling to propose a mechanism for the glutathione lyase (deglutathionylation) reaction in which an enzyme-stabilized glutathione thiolate attacks the thioether bond of GS-HPV, and the reaction proceeds through an enzyme-stabilized enolate intermediate. Three residues implicated in the proposed mechanism (Thr51, Tyr166, and Tyr224) were found to be critical for the lyase reaction. We also found that Nu-class GSTs from Sphingobium sp. SYK-6 (which can also break the β-aryl ether bond) and Escherichia coli (which cannot break the β-aryl ether bond) can also cleave (R)- and (S)-GS-HPV, suggesting that glutathione lyase activity may be common throughout this widespread but largely uncharacterized class of glutathione S-transferases."

https://openalex.org/W2785777923,"The Salmonella-secreted effector SseK3 translocates into host cells, targeting innate immune responses, including NF-κB activation. SseK3 is a glycosyltransferase that transfers an N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) moiety onto the guanidino group of a target arginine, modulating host cell function. However, a lack of structural information has precluded elucidation of the molecular mechanisms in arginine and GlcNAc selection. We report here the crystal structure of SseK3 in its apo form and in complex with hydrolyzed UDP-GlcNAc. SseK3 possesses the typical glycosyltransferase type-A (GT-A)-family fold and the metal-coordinating DXD motif essential for ligand binding and enzymatic activity. Several conserved residues were essential for arginine GlcNAcylation and SseK3-mediated inhibition of NF-κB activation. Isothermal titration calorimetry revealed SseK3’s preference for manganese coordination. The pattern of interactions in the substrate-bound SseK3 structure explained the selection of the primary ligand. Structural rearrangement of the C-terminal residues upon ligand binding was crucial for SseK3’s catalytic activity, and NMR analysis indicated that SseK3 has limited UDP-GlcNAc hydrolysis activity. The release of free N-acetyl α-d-glucosamine, and the presence of the same molecule in the SseK3 active site, classified it as a retaining glycosyltransferase. A glutamate residue in the active site suggested a double-inversion mechanism for the arginine N-glycosylation reaction. Homology models of SseK1, SseK2, and the Escherichia coli orthologue NleB1 reveal differences in the surface electrostatic charge distribution, possibly accounting for their diverse activities.

As well as the conserved DXD motif in SseK effectors, additional amino acids are conserved, including a tyrosine and glutamic acid residue, equivalent to Tyr-219 and Glu-253 in NleB1, both required for NleB1-mediated arginine GlcNAcylation of the death domain–containing protein, FADD (22Wong Fok Lung T.

However, in the absence of structural information, the molecular details underlying arginine and UDP-GlcNAc selection are unknown. This study presents the crystal structures of the N-glycosyltransferase SseK3 in its free form and bound to UDP, GlcNAc, and manganese. SseK3 adopts the classical GT-A glycosyltransferases family fold and is able to hydrolyze UDP-GlcNAc in the absence of a protein substrate. Mutational analysis of amino acids predicted to be important for substrate binding identified several conserved residues in SseK3 that are essential for arginine GlcNAcylation of TRADD and SseK3-mediated inhibition of TNFα-induced NF-κB activation, directly correlating enzymatic activity to virulence function. Structural analysis reveals the presence of an active site glutamate residue, which is conserved only in NleB and SseK proteins and not in other structurally related glycosyltransferases and is essential for enzymatic activity. The close proximity of this residue to the reactive anomeric carbon supports a double-inversion catalytic mechanism, where an intermediate enzyme–sugar is stabilized for the nucleophilic attack of the acceptor arginine side chain of the host substrates. This is the first structure of a retaining arginine glycosyltransferase bound to a hydrolyzed form of its donor substrate, representing an important step toward the understanding of this class of effector proteins. Mass spectrometry analysis of bacterially expressed full-length SseK3 revealed limited proteolysis, with the protein losing its first 13 and last 2 amino acids (data not shown). For the majority of T3SS effector proteins, the N-terminal 15–25 residues, often predicted to be unstructured, are required for translocation and remain uncleaved following delivery into the host cell cytosol (24Karavolos M.H.

This region is frequently removed before crystallization, as in the case of the E. coli effector protease NleC (26Li W. Liu Y. Sheng X. Yin P. Hu F. Liu Y. Chen C. Li Q. Yan C. Wang J.

We therefore prepared two forms of SseK3, 14-333 and 14-335, for subsequent structural and functional characterization. Glycosyltransferases require the presence of a divalent cation for activity. To test the selectivity of SseK3 for divalent cations and UDP-glucose derivatives, we compared the ability of SseK3 to interact with Mg2+, Mn2+, and three UDP-carbohydrate derivatives (UDP-GlcNAc, UDP-Glc (glucose), and UDP-Gal (galactose)) by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) (Fig. 1, Fig. S1, and Table 1). No binding was observed for UDP-GlcNAc to SseK3(14–335) in the absence of a coordinating metal cation (Fig. S1). When the titration experiments were performed in the presence of MgCl2 or MnCl2, the resulting binding affinity for UDP-GlcNAc in the presence of Mn2+ (Kd = 1.9 μm) showed a 5-fold increase compared with that for Mg2+ (Kd = 10 μm) (Fig. 1 and Fig. S1). This binding affinity is similar to that observed for C. difficile toxin A for UDP-Glc and manganese (Kd = 11.4 μm) (28D'Urzo N. Malito E. Biancucci M. Bottomley M.J. Maione D. Scarselli M.

The binding studies showed that ligand interaction is influenced by the presence of the two C-terminal residues in the longer SseK3 construct (Trp-334 and Arg-335), but both SseK3(14–333) and SseK3(14–335) bind with a lower affinity to UDP-Gal, compared with UDP-Glc and UDP-GlcNAc. UDP-GlcNAc has the highest affinity for SseK3(14–335), although it only binds marginally stronger than UDP-Glc, and manifests the largest increase in affinity due to the presence of the two C-terminal residues Trp-334 and Arg-335. Interestingly, the change in affinity appears to be associated with an increase in binding enthalpy and a loss of entropy, suggesting the occurrence of a structural reorganization upon ligand binding to SseK3 (Table 1).Table 1Thermodynamic quantities for the interaction of SseK3 constructs and UDP-glucose derivativesProtein/LigandsKdΔH−TΔSSitesμmkcal/molcal/mol degreesSseK3(14–335)/no cationNBDaNBD, no binding detected.NBDNBDNBDSseK3(14–335)/UDP-GlcNAc/Mg2+10 ± 1.0−7.4 ± 0.40.7 ± 0.10.8 ± 0.1SseK3(14–335)/UDP-GlcNAc/Mn2+1.9 ± 0.5−15.8 ± 0.38.1 ± 0.20.9 ± 0.1SseK3(14–335)/UDP-Gal/Mn2+6.7 ± 0.8−8.9 ± 0.32.0 ± 0.40.8 ± 0.1SseK3(14–335)/UDP-Glu/Mn2+2.6 ± 0.1−11.4 ± 0.84.0 ± 0.80.9 ± 0.1SseK3(14–333)/UDP-GlcNAc/Mn2+6.3 ± 0.5−8.8 ± 0.51.9 ± 0.60.8 ± 0.1SseK3(14–333)/UDP-Gal/Mn2+7.7 ± 1.6−7.1 ± 0.42.6 ± 0.50.8 ± 0.1SseK3(14–333)/UDP-Glu/Mn2+5.6 ± 1.2−9.8 ± 0.52.8 ± 0.60.7 ± 0.1a NBD, no binding detected.

Attempts to solve the structure by molecular replacement using available glycosyltransferase X-ray structures or selenium SAD phasing failed. Instead, we recorded data at the I23 long-wavelength beamline at Diamond Light Source to reveal the positions of the selenium and sulfur atoms within SseK3 based on the small anomalous signals present at long wavelengths to obtain an initial model (29Wagner A.

Open table in a new tab The structure of SseK3(14–335) at 2.20 Å in complex with UDP, GlcNAc, and Mn2+ (Fig. 2B) was solved by molecular replacement using the apo-structure. SseK3(14–335) crystals belong to the same space group as the shorter unbound construct, with two molecules in the asymmetric unit (Table 2). The two chains in the a.u. overlap with an RMSD in Cα positions of 0.88 Å for residues 27–335. No electronic density is visible for amino acids 14–26 for either chain in the a.u., whereas all of the C-terminal residues are observable. Residues 27–321 of SseK3 in the apo and ligand-bound forms overlap with an RMSD of 0.84 Å, whereas residues 322–332 of SseK3(14–333) are unstructured with an average B factor of 45.5 Å2, compared with the average macromolecule B factor of 33.3 Å2. The SseK3 catalytic core domain (∼250 residues) shows the classic features of the large glycosyltransferase type-A family of enzymes (GT-A) consisting of a single module composed of a central parallel β-sheet core flanked by a number of α-helices (14Lairson L.L.

https://openalex.org/W2786778447,"Amino acid availability is sensed by GCN2 (general control nonderepressible 2) and mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), but how these two sensors coordinate their respective signal transduction events remains mysterious. In this study we utilized mouse genetic models to investigate the role of GCN2 in hepatic mTORC1 regulation upon amino acid stress induced by a single injection of asparaginase. We found that deletion of Gcn2 prevented hepatic phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2α to asparaginase and instead unleashed mTORC1 activity. This change in intracellular signaling occurred within minutes and resulted in increased 5′-terminal oligopyrimidine mRNA translation instead of activating transcription factor 4 synthesis. Asparaginase also promoted hepatic mRNA levels of several genes which function as mTORC1 inhibitors, and these genes were blunted or blocked in the absence of Gcn2, but their timing could not explain the early discordant effects in mTORC1 signaling. Preconditioning mice with a chemical endoplasmic reticulum stress agent before amino acid stress rescued normal mTORC1 repression in the liver of Gcn2−/− mice but not in livers with both Gcn2 and the endoplasmic reticulum stress kinase, Perk, deleted. Furthermore, treating wildtype and Gcn2−/− mice with ISRIB, an inhibitor of PERK signaling, also failed to alter hepatic mTORC1 responses to asparaginase, although administration of ISRIB alone had an inhibitory GCN2-independent effect on mTORC1 activity. Taken together, the data show that activating transcription factor 4 is not required, but eukaryotic initiation factor 2α phosphorylation is necessary to prevent mTORC1 activation during amino acid stress."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the mechanisms that underlie the observed association between race/ethnicity and cervical cancer survival. We identified 13,698 women, ages 21 to 64 years, diagnosed with stages I-III primary cervical cancer between 2007-2013 in Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER). Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models evaluated associations between race/ethnicity (Non-Hispanic White, Non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, Other) and cervical cancer-specific mortality. We conducted mediation analysis to calculate the mediation proportion and its 95% confidence interval. Non-Hispanic black women had an increased risk of cervical cancer-specific mortality (HR: 1.23, 95% CI: 1.08-1.39), and Hispanic women a decreased risk of dying from their disease (HR: 0.82, 95% CI: 0.72-0.93), compared with non-Hispanic white. The estimated proportion of excess cervical cancer mortality for non-Hispanic black women relative to non-Hispanic white women that was mediated by insurance was 18.6% and by treatment was 47.2%. Furthermore, non-Hispanic black women were more likely to receive radiation and less likely to receive surgery for early-stage disease. In this population-based study we found that some of the excess cervical cancer-specific mortality for non-Hispanic black women is mediated by factors such as insurance status and treatment. These findings suggest that enhancing existing insurance coverage and ensuring equal and adequate treatment in all women may be a key strategy for improving cervical cancer outcomes."

We found that F598 recognizes PNAG through a large groove-shaped binding site that traverses the entire light- and heavy-chain interface and accommodates at least five GlcNAc residues. The Fab–GlcNAc complex revealed a deep binding pocket in which the monosaccharide and a core GlcNAc of the oligosaccharide were almost identically positioned, suggesting an anchored binding mechanism of PNAG by F598. The Fab used in our structural analyses retained binding to PNAG on the surface of an antibiotic-resistant, biofilm-forming strain of Staphylococcus aureus.

The northern elephant seal (Mirounga angustirostris) breeds and haul-outs on islands and the mainland of Baja California, Mexico, and California, U.S.A. At the beginning of the 21st century, numbers of elephant seals in California are increasing, but the status of Baja California populations is unknown, and some data suggest they may be decreasing. We hypothesize that the elephant seal population of Baja California is experiencing a decline because the animals are not migrating as far south due to warming sea and air temperatures. Here we assessed population trends of the Baja California population, and climate change in the region. The numbers of northern elephant seals in Baja California colonies have been decreasing since the 1990s, and both the surface waters off Baja California and the local air temperatures have warmed during the last three decades. We propose that declining population sizes may be attributable to decreased migration towards the southern portions of the range in response to the observed temperature increases. Further research is needed to confirm our hypothesis; however, if true, it would imply that elephant seal colonies of Baja California and California are not demographically isolated which would pose challenges to environmental and management policies between Mexico and the United States."
https://openalex.org/W2786171287,"Upon binding to thalidomide and other immunomodulatory drugs, the E3 ligase substrate receptor cereblon (CRBN) promotes proteosomal destruction by engaging the DDB1-CUL4A-Roc1-RBX1 E3 ubiquitin ligase in human cells but not in mouse cells, suggesting that sequence variations in CRBN may cause its inactivation. Therapeutically, CRBN engagers have the potential for broad applications in cancer and immune therapy by specifically reducing protein expression through targeted ubiquitin-mediated degradation. To examine the effects of defined sequence changes on CRBN's activity, we performed a comprehensive study using complementary theoretical, biophysical, and biological assays aimed at understanding CRBN's nonprimate sequence variations. With a series of recombinant thalidomide-binding domain (TBD) proteins, we show that CRBN sequence variants retain their drug-binding properties to both classical immunomodulatory drugs and dBET1, a chemical compound and targeting ligand designed to degrade bromodomain-containing 4 (BRD4) via a CRBN-dependent mechanism. We further show that dBET1 stimulates CRBN's E3 ubiquitin-conjugating function and degrades BRD4 in both mouse and human cells.

Prior efforts to produce national estimates have suffered from poor and inconsistent measurements of force, small and unrepresentative samples, low survey and/or item response rates, and disparate reporting of rates of force. The present study employs data from a nationally representative survey of state and local law enforcement agencies that has a high survey response rate as well as a relatively high rate of reporting uses of force. Using data on arrests for violent offenses and the number of sworn officers to impute missing data on uses of force, we estimate a total of 337,590 use of physical force incidents among State and local law enforcement agencies during 2012 with a 95 percent confidence interval of +/- 10,470 incidents or +/- 3.1 percent. This article reports the extent to which the number and rate of force incidents vary by the type and size of law enforcement agencies. Our findings demonstrate the willingness of a large proportion of law enforcement agencies to voluntarily report the amount of force used by their officers and the relative strengths and weaknesses of the Law Enforcement Management and Administrative Statistics (LEMAS) program to produce nationally representative information about police behavior."

In this study, a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) dependent technology is developed for the purpose of inhibiting parasite proliferation in insect cells. The scFv-G4, which we prepared from a mouse G4 monoclonal antibody, can target the N. bombycis spore wall protein 12 (NbSWP12). Indirect immunofluorescence assays showed that NbSWP12 located mainly on the outside of the N. bombycis cytoskeleton, although some of it co-localized with β-tubulin in the meront-stage of parasites. When meront division began, NbSWP12 became concentrated at both ends of each meront. Western blotting showed that scFv-G4 could express in Sf9-III cells and recognized native NbSWP12. The transgenic Sf9-III cell line showed better resistance than the controls when challenged with N. bombycis, indicating that NbSWP12 is a promising target in this parasite and this scFv dependent strategy could be a solution for construction of N. bombycis-resistant Bombyx mori."
https://openalex.org/W2785955818,"Alterations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy numbers in various human cancers have been studied, but any such changes in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) are not established. In the present study, we investigated the correlation of mtDNA copy number with clinicopathologic features, prognosis, and malignant potential of ESCC. MtDNA copy numbers of resected specimens from 80 patients treated with radical esophagectomy were measured by quantitative real-time PCR analyses. Human ESCC cells, TE8 and TE11, were cultured, and depletion of mtDNA content was induced by knockdown of mitochondrial transcription factor A expression or treatment with ethidium bromide. The mRNA and protein expression, proliferation, invasion, and cell cycle were investigated. The results showed that the mtDNA copy number of cancerous portions was 56.0 (37.4-234.5) percent that of non-cancerous parts and significantly lower (p<0.01). Low mtDNA copy number in resected cancerous tissues was significantly correlated with pathological depth of tumor invasion (p = 0.045) and pathological stage (p = 0.025). Patients with lower mtDNA copy number had significantly poorer 5-year overall survival compared to patients with higher levels (p<0.01). The mtDNA-depleted TE8 and TE11 cells had morphological changes and proliferated more slowly than control cells under normoxia but proliferated at almost the same rate under hypoxic conditions. In mtDNA-depleted cells, E-cadherin mRNA expression was decreased, and N-cadherin, vimentin, zeb-1, and cd44 mRNA expression was increased. Immunoblotting and flow cytometry analysis also showed downregulated E-cadherin and upregulated N-cadherin and CD44 protein in mtDNA-depleted cells. Moreover, mtDNA-depleted cells had enhanced invasion, migration, and sphere formation abilities, and the cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase was induced in these cells. These results suggested that mtDNA-depleted ESCC cells had mesenchymal characteristics, cancer stemness, and tolerance to hypoxia, which played important role in cancer progression. In conclusion, a low copy number of mtDNA is associated with tumor progression in ESCC."
https://openalex.org/W2786042257,"Insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) is an atypical zinc-metalloendopeptidase that hydrolyzes insulin and other intermediate-sized peptide hormones, many of which are implicated in skin health and wound healing. Pharmacological inhibitors of IDE administered internally have been shown to slow the breakdown of insulin and thereby potentiate insulin action. Given the importance of insulin and other IDE substrates for a variety of dermatological processes, pharmacological inhibitors of IDE suitable for topical applications would be expected to hold significant therapeutic and cosmetic potential. Existing IDE inhibitors, however, are prohibitively expensive, difficult to synthesize and of undetermined toxicity. Here we used phage display to discover novel peptidic inhibitors of IDE, which were subsequently characterized in vitro and in cell culture assays. Among several peptide sequences tested, a cyclic dodecapeptide dubbed P12-3A was found to potently inhibit the degradation of insulin (Ki = 2.5 ± 0.31 μM) and other substrates by IDE, while also being resistant to degradation, stable in biological milieu, and highly selective for IDE. In cell culture, P12-3A was shown to potentiate several insulin-induced processes, including the transcription, translation and secretion of alpha-1 type I collagen in primary murine skin fibroblasts, and the migration of keratinocytes in a scratch wound migration assay. By virtue of its potency, stability, specificity for IDE, low cost of synthesis, and demonstrated ability to potentiate insulin-induced processes involved in wound healing and skin health, P12-3A holds significant therapeutic and cosmetic potential for topical applications."

Ahi1 deficiency in mice leads to behaviors typical of depression. However, the mechanisms by which AHI1 regulates behavior remain to be elucidated. Here, we found that down-regulation of expression of the rate-limiting enzyme in dopamine biosynthesis, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), in the midbrains of Ahi1-knockout (KO) mice is responsible for Ahi1-deficiency–mediated depressive symptoms. We also found that Rev-Erbα, a TH transcriptional repressor and circadian regulator, is up-regulated in the Ahi1-KO mouse midbrains and Ahi1-knockdown Neuro-2a cells. Moreover, brain and muscle Arnt-like protein 1 (BMAL1), the Rev-Erbα transcriptional regulator, is also increased in the Ahi1-KO mouse midbrains and Ahi1-knockdown cells. Our results further revealed that AHI1 decreases BMAL1/Rev-Erbα expression by interacting with and repressing retinoic acid receptor–related orphan receptor α, a nuclear receptor and transcriptional regulator of circadian genes. Of note, Bmal1 deficiency reversed the reduction in TH expression induced by Ahi1 deficiency. Moreover, microinfusion of the Rev-Erbα inhibitor SR8278 into the ventral midbrain of Ahi1-KO mice significantly increased TH expression in the ventral tegmental area and improved their depressive symptoms.

https://openalex.org/W2791632622,"Introduction Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by M. tuberculosis complex and remains a major global public health problem. The epidemic remains a threat to sub-Saharan Africa, including Ethiopia, with further emergence of drug resistant TB. We investigated the drug sensitivity pattern and molecular epidemiology of mycobacterial strains isolated from pulmonary TB patients in and around Ambo town in Oromia Region, Central Ethiopia. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted involving 105 consecutive new smear positive pulmonary TB patients diagnosed at Ambo Hospital and surrounding Health Centers between May 2014 and March 2015 upon informed consent. Sputum samples were cultured on Löwenstein-Jensen (LJ) media using standard techniques to isolate mycobacteria. Region of difference 9 (RD9)-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and spoligotyping was employed for the identification of the isolates at species and strain levels. The spoligotype patterns were entered into the SITVIT database to determine Octal and SIT (Spoligotyping International Typing) numbers for each strain. The sensitivity of the isolates to isoniazid (INH), rifampicin (RIF), ethambutol (ETB) and streptomycin (STM) was evaluated on LJ-medium with the indirect proportion method. Results Cultures were positive in 86/105 (82%) of newly diagnosed smear positive pulmonary TB cases. All of the 86 isolates were confirmed as M. tuberculosis. The majority (76.7%) of them were clustered into seven groups while the rest (23.3%) appeared unique. The most predominant Spoligotypes were SIT53 and SIT149, consisting of 24.4% and 20.9% of the isolates, respectively. Assigning of the isolates to family using SPOTCLUST software revealed that 45.3% of the isolates belonged to T1, 23.3% to T3 and 13% to CAS family. The majority (76.7%) of the M. tuberculosis isolates were susceptible to all the four drugs. Any resistance to any one of the four drugs was detected in 23.3% of the isolates. The highest proportion of any resistance was observed against isoniazid (9.3%) and ethambutol (7%). There was only a single case (1.2%) of multidrug resistant/rifampicin resistant (MDR/RR) TB. Conclusion The majority of the isolates were clustered suggesting on-going active transmission in the study area. Mono resistance is relatively prevalent while the magnitude of MDR/RR-TB was found to be lower than in previous studies."

https://openalex.org/W2950264743,"Plasmodium falciparum (Pf), the causative agent of malaria, has an iron–sulfur cluster–containing class I fumarate hydratase (FH) that catalyzes the interconversion of fumarate to malate, a well-known reaction in the tricarboxylic acid cycle. In humans, the same reaction is catalyzed by class II FH that has no sequence or structural homology with the class I enzyme from Plasmodium. Fumarate is generated in large quantities in the parasite as a by-product of AMP synthesis and is converted to malate by FH and then used in the generation of the key metabolites oxaloacetate, aspartate, and pyruvate.

Key intermediates that anaplerotically feed into the TCA cycle are α-ketoglutarate derived from glutamate, oxaloacetate (OAA) from phosphoenolpyruvate, and fumarate from AMP synthesis. Synthesis of AMP in the parasite is solely from IMP through a pathway involving the enzymes adenylosuccinate synthetase (ADSS) and adenylosuccinate lyase (ASL). The net reaction of ADSS and ASL involves consumption of GTP and aspartate and generation of GDP, Pi, and fumarate. In the rapidly-dividing parasite with an AT-rich genome and high-energy requirements, leading to a high demand for adenine pools, one would expect a high flux of fumarate generation. The parasite does not secrete fumarate, but instead, the carbon derived from this metabolite can be traced in malate, OAA, aspartate, pyruvate (through phosphoenolpyruvate), and lactate (3Bulusu V.

Fumarate hydratase (fumarase, EC 4.2.1.2) catalyzes the reversible conversion of fumarate to malate. The stereospecific reaction involves the anti-addition of a water molecule across the carbon–carbon double bond of fumarate resulting in the formation of S-malate (l-malate). The reverse reaction proceeds with the elimination of a molecule of water from malate in an anti-fashion (4Teipel J.W. Hass G.M. Hill R.L. The substrate specificity of fumarase.J. Biol.

FH is found in two biochemically distinct forms: class I FH is a thermolabile, oxygen-sensitive 4Fe-4S cluster-containing enzyme; class II FH is a stable, oxygen-insensitive, and iron-independent enzyme (7Woods S.A.

Class I FH is further divided into two types, two-subunit and single-subunit, depending on the number of genes that encode the functional enzyme (8Shimoyama T. Rajashekhara E. Ohmori D. Kosaka T.

Class I fumarases display substrate promiscuity; apart from catalyzing the interconversion of fumarate and malate, these enzymes also interconvert S,S-tartrate and oxaloacetate and mesaconate and S-citramalate with varying catalytic efficiencies (9Flint D.H.

Both classes of FHs are distributed in all three domains of life with class I FH being more prevalent in archaea, prokaryotes, and lower eukaryotes. Many organisms have genes corresponding to both classes, as in Escherichia coli (Ec), which has three FH-encoding genes, viz. fumA, fumB, and fumC. FumA and FumB are 4Fe-4S cluster-containing class I enzymes, and FumC belongs to class II-type FH. Recently, another gene, fumD, has been identified in the E. coli genome to code for a class I fumarase with altered substrate preferences (14Kronen M. Berg I.A.

Biochemical characterization of PfFH could throw light on unique features of the enzyme and also provide leads for the development of inhibitors. We report here the kinetic characterization and substrate promiscuity of PfFH, studied using in vitro assays on the recombinant enzyme and E. coli-based functional complementation. dl-Mercaptosuccinic acid (dl-MSA), a malate analog, was found to be a competitive inhibitor of the P. falciparum enzyme. dl-MSA inhibited the growth of the ΔfumACB strain of E. coli-expressing PfFH as well as the asexual intra-erythrocytic stages of P. falciparum in in vitro cultures. Attempts at generating fh-null Plasmodium berghei grown in BALB/c mice yielded drug-resistant clonal populations that had retained the fh gene, implying its essentiality. However, fh gene knockout was obtained when the transfectants were grown in C57BL/6 mice. This suggests mouse-strain–dependent essentiality of the fh gene in P. berghei. Although both class I and class II FHs catalyze the conversion of fumarate to malate, it is the class II FHs that are widely distributed across eukaryotic organisms. To elicit possible correlations between the presence of class I FH and the nature of the organisms, such as their uni- or multicellularity and parasitic or free-living lifestyle, eukaryotes with class I FH were catalogued (Table 1). In addition, Table 1 reports the presence/absence of class II FH in organisms having class I FH and on FH proteins with mitochondrial targeting sequence (accession number is shaded in gray). Class I FHs are sparsely distributed in both uni- and multicellular eukaryotes and are of the single-subunit type. Although most multicellular eukaryotes with class I FH also have class II FH, Hymenolepis microstoma and Echinococcus multilocularis (flatworms) are the only multicellular eukaryotes that have only the class I fh gene. Eukaryotes, including Entamoeba histolytica, Hymenolepis microstoma, Echinococcus multilocularis, Chrysochromulina sp., and organisms belonging to alveolata and kinetoplastida having only class I FH, are all parasitic in nature with the exception of Chrysochromulina sp., Gonium pectorale, and Bodo saltans that are free-living. In addition, the symbiont Symbiodinium microadriaticum has only class I FH. Most other eukaryotes having class I FH also have the gene for class II FH.

Although biochemical evidence suggests that FH is mitochondrially localized in P. falciparum (3Bulusu V. Jayaraman V. Balaram H. Metabolic fate of fumarate, a side product of the purine salvage pathway in the intra-erythrocytic stages of Plasmodium falciparum.J. Biol.

To examine the localization of the protein in P. falciparum, the fh gene on chromosome 9 was replaced with DNA encoding FH-regulatable fluorescent affinity tag (comprising green fluorescent protein (GFP), E. coli dihydrofolate reductase (EcDHFR) degradation domain, and a hemagglutinin (HA) tag in tandem) fusion protein by single crossover recombination in PM1KO (27Muralidharan V.

The genotype of the strain (Fig. 1b) was validated by PCR using primers P1–P4 (Table S1) and used for live-cell imaging after staining with Hoechst and MitoTracker Red CM-H2XRos. The GFP-positive parasites clearly showed colocalization of GFP signal with MitoTracker Red staining (Fig. 1c) showing mitochondrial localization of fumarate hydratase in P. falciparum. Despite this localization, the only organism for which all four bioinformatic tools used predict a mitochondrial targeting sequence is Plasmodium knowlesi (Table S2). However, examination of the N terminus of PfFH shows the presence of proximal and distal basic residues interspersed with hydroxylated amino acids, a feature usually present in mitochondrial targeting presequences (26Fukasawa Y. Tsuji J. Fu S.-C. Tomii K. Horton P. Imai K. MitoFates: improved prediction of mitochondrial targeting sequences and their cleavage sites.Mol. Cell.

To recombinantly express organellar proteins in E. coli, it is preferable to use the DNA sequence corresponding to only the mature protein with the signal peptide deleted. Because none of the bioinformatic prediction tools was able to identify an unambiguous signal sequence in P. falciparum FH, we resorted to multiple sequence alignment with bacterial single-subunit type and archaeal two-subunit type FH for generating N-terminal deletion constructs. Examination of the multiple sequence alignment shows a 120-amino acid insertion at the N terminus in Plasmodium FHs that is absent in bacterial and archaeal FH sequences (Fig. S1). Of the N-terminal 120 amino acid residues in plasmodial FHs, the first 40 residues are diverse, whereas residues 40–120 show a high degree of conservation (Fig. S2) within the genus. Hence, for functional complementation in the E. coli fh null mutant, three different expression constructs of PfFH protein in pQE30 were generated: those expressing the full-length (PfFHFL); N-terminal 40 residues deleted (PfFHΔ40); and N-terminal 120 residues deleted (PfFHΔ120) enzymes. E. coli has three genes that encode fumarate hydratase; fumA and fumB of the class I type and fumC of the class II type. fumA and fumC genes are in tandem and are driven by a common promoter (7Woods S.A. Schwartzbach S.D. Guest J.R. Two biochemically distinct classes of fumarase in Escherichia coli.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 954 (3282546): 14-2610.1016/0167-4838(88)90050-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 29Bell P.J. Andrews S.C. Sivak M.N. Guest J.R. Nucleotide sequence of the FNR-regulated fumarase gene (fumB) of Escherichia coli K-12.J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171 (2656658): 3494-350310.1128/jb.171.6.3494-3503.1989Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Starting with JW4083-1, a ΔfumB strain of E. coli, a triple knockout ΔfumACB strain, in which all three major fum genes (fumA, fumC, and fumB) are deleted, was generated and validated by PCR (Fig. S3). As expected, although the strain was able to grow normally in malate-containing minimal medium (Fig. 2a), it was unable to grow on minimal medium containing fumarate as the sole carbon source (Fig. 2b). As expected, all transformants (containing pQE-PfFHFL, pQE-PfFHΔ40, pQE-PfFHΔ120, and pQE30) of ΔfumACB strain of E. coli grew well on malate-containing minimal medium plates (Fig. 2c). In fumarate-containing M9 plates, the cells expressing PfFHΔ40 and PfFHFL grew faster, whereas the growth rate of cells expressing PfFHΔ120 was slower, and no growth of cells carrying just pQE30 was observed (Fig. 2d). This shows that the PfFH can functionally complement the deficiency of fumarate hydratase activity in the ΔfumACB strain and validates that the P. falciparum enzyme is indeed fumarate hydratase. The slow growth of PfFHΔ120-expressing ΔfumACB E. coli strain indicates that residues 40–120 play a role in the structure and/or function of PfFH despite these residues being conserved only in plasmodial fumarate hydratase sequences and not in others (Fig. S1). PfFHΔ40 was expressed with an N-terminal His6 tag in Codon plus BL21 (DE3) RIL, purified using Ni-NTA-affinity chromatography (Fig. 3a) and reconstituted in vitro with the Fe–S cluster. The UV-visible spectrum with absorption maxima at 360 and 405 nm indicates the presence of the 4Fe-4S cluster in the enzyme and 78% reconstitution efficiency using an ε value of 16,000 m−1 cm−1 at 410 nm (30Antonkine M.L.

https://openalex.org/W2792611476,"Background Upon admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), all patients should discuss their goals of care and express their wishes concerning life-sustaining interventions (e.g., cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)). Without such discussions, interventions that prolong life at the cost of decreasing its quality may be used without appropriate guidance from patients. Objectives To adapt an existing decision aid about CPR to create a wiki-based decision aid individually adapted to each patient’s risk factors; and to document the use of a wiki platform for this purpose. Methods We conducted three weeks of ethnographic observation in our ICU to observe intensivists and patients discussing goals of care and to identify their needs regarding decision making. We interviewed intensivists individually. Then we conducted three rounds of rapid prototyping involving 15 patients and 11 health professionals. We recorded and analyzed all discussions, interviews and comments, and collected sociodemographic data. Using a wiki, a website that allows multiple users to contribute or edit content, we adapted the decision aid accordingly and added the Good Outcome Following Attempted Resuscitation (GO-FAR) prediction rule calculator. Results We added discussion of invasive mechanical ventilation. The final decision aid comprises values clarification, risks and benefits of CPR and invasive mechanical ventilation, statistics about CPR, and a synthesis section. We added the GO-FAR prediction calculator as an online adjunct to the decision aid. Although three rounds of rapid prototyping simplified the information in the decision aid, 60% (n = 3/5) of the patients involved in the last cycle still did not understand its purpose. Conclusions Wikis and user-centered design can be used to adapt decision aids to users’ needs and local contexts. Our wiki platform allows other centers to adapt our tools, reducing duplication and accelerating scale-up. Physicians need training in shared decision making skills about goals of care and in using the decision aid. A video version of the decision aid could clarify its purpose."

Sixteen low-risk pregnant women between 38 and 40 weeks of gestation with cephalic presentation participated. They performed breast stimulation for 3 days with an attendant midwife in a single maternity hospital. Each breast was stimulated for 15 minutes for a total of 1 hour per day. Saliva was collected 10 minutes before the intervention and 15, 30, 60, 75, and 90 minutes after the intervention, yielding 18 samples per woman.Among a total of 282 saliva samples from the 16 participants, OT level was measured in 142 samples (missing rate: 49.6%). The median OT level showed the highest values on day 3 of the breast stimulation, with a marked increase 30 min after the intervention. In the mixed models after multiple imputation for missing data, the OT level on the first day of intervention was significantly lower than that on the third day of intervention. Fatigue from breast stimulation decreased on subsequent days, and most of the women (75%) felt no discomfort with the protocol. Uterine hyperstimulation was not observed.Following a 3-day breast stimulation protocol for spontaneous onset of labor, the mean OT level showed the highest values on day 3. The breast stimulation intervention protocol showed good feasibility in terms of practicality and acceptability among the pregnant women. Additional large-scale studies are warranted to confirm the protocol's effectiveness."

In addition we assessed if serum sncRNA levels can be used to differentiate patients with specific disease features. Methods Serum RNA was isolated from 37 pSS patients as well as 21 patients with incomplete Sjögren’s Syndrome (iSS) and 17 healthy controls (HC) allocated to two independent cohorts: discovery and validation. OpenArray profiling of 758 sncRNAs was performed in the discovery cohort. Selected sncRNAs were measured in the validation cohort using single-assay RT-qPCR. In addition, unsupervised hierarchical clustering was performed within the pSS group. Results Ten sncRNAs were differentially expressed between the groups in the array. In the validation cohort, we confirmed the increased expression of U6-snRNA and miR-661 in the iSS group as compared to HC. We were unable to validate differential expression of any miRNAs in the pSS group. However, within this group several miRNAs correlated with laboratory parameters. Unsupervised clustering distinguished three clusters of pSS patients. Patients in one cluster showed significantly higher serum IgG, prevalence of anti-SSB autoantibodies, IFN-score, and decreased leukocyte counts compared to the two other clusters. Conclusion We were unable to identify any serum sncRNAs with differential expression in pSS patients. However, we show that circulating miRNA levels are associated with disease parameters in pSS patients and can be used to distinguish pSS patients with more severe B cell hyperactivity. As several of these miRNAs are implicated in the regulation of B cells, they may play a role in the perpetuation of the disease."

The sample included 215 (177 male; 38 female) young people who were in youth detention in the state of Victoria, Australia. Participants were administered a series of questionnaires related to self-harm, mental health, socio-environmental experiences and behaviours. Overall, one-third (33%) of the sample reported previous self-harm and 12% reported at least one suicide attempt. In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, a history of childhood trauma, contact with mental health services, and low educational interest significantly increased the likelihood of self-harm. Young people who reported a suicide attempt scored significantly higher on the measure of childhood trauma than did youth who had engaged in non-suicidal self-harm. Findings demonstrate a strong connection between childhood traumatic experiences and suicidal behaviours for youth in detention. Trauma histories and mental health concerns must be considered when identifying youth at increased risk of self-harm."
https://openalex.org/W2785834366,"The greenhouse whitefly Trialeurodes vaporariorum (Westwood) (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) is a pest of a wide range of vegetable and ornamental crops in greenhouses around the world. Yellow sticky traps are highly attractive to flying adults and so are frequently used to monitor the pest. Our aim was to test whether changes in trap translucency or the addition of printed black patterns could increase the catch on yellow sticky traps in greenhouses. Field trials were carried out in commercial crops of strawberry and tomato under glass over three years. Reduced trap translucency increased trap catches by a factor of 1.5 to 7.0 and the catch increased significantly for both females and males. Spectrometer measurements showed that the increased catch was consistent with an increased landing stimulus from a colour opponency mechanism i.e. the ratio of energy from 500–640 nm to the energy from 300–500 nm. Printed black patterns increased trap catches on specific types of trap, by a factor of 1.4 to 2.3, and the catch increased significantly for both females and males. The patterns increased trap catch on moderately translucent traps, but decreased trap catch on less translucent traps. The evidence points to a contrast/edge effect of pattern, but laboratory experiments are needed to clarify this. Exploitation of these translucency and pattern effects could improve the efficacy of yellow traps for monitoring and mass trapping in crops."

This study aimed to compare the proportional changes between urban and rural infections in the Zhejiang province from 2013 to 2017 by analyzing the exposure histories of human cases.All laboratory-confirmed cases of H7N9 from 2013 (the first wave) to 2017 (the fifth wave) in the Zhejiang province of China were analyzed. Urban and rural infections were defined based on the locations of poultry exposure (direct and indirect) in urban areas (central towns) and rural areas (towns and villages on the outskirts of cities). A Chi-square trend test was used to compare the proportional trend between urban and rural infections over time and logistic regression was used to obtain the odds ratio by years.From 2013 to 2017, a statistically significant trend in rural infections was observed (p <0.01). The incremental odds ratio by years of rural infections was 1.59 with 95% confidence intervals of 1.34 to 1.86. Each year, significant increases in the proportion of live poultry transactions in LPMS and poultry processing plants were detected in conjunction with an increased proportion of urban and rural infections.The empirical evidence indicated a need for heightened infection control measures in rural areas, such as serving rural farms and backyards as active surveillance points for the H7N9 virus. Other potential interventions such as the vaccination of poultry and extending the closure of LPMs to the provincial level require further careful investigations."

https://openalex.org/W2789487964,"Suicide is a spectrum of behavior including suicide ideation and suicidal attempt and is undoubtedly the outcome of the interaction of several factors. The role of two main constructs of human nature, aggression and impulsivity, has been discussed broadly in relation to suicide, as endophenotypes or traits of personality, in research and in clinical practice across diagnoses. The objective of our study was to assess impulsive and aggressive behaviors among primitive people of the Idu Mishmi tribe, who are known for high suicide completer and attempter rates.The study group was comprised of 177 unrelated Idu Mishmi participants divided into two sets: 39 suicide attempters and 138 non-attempters. Data on demographic factors and details of suicide attempts were collected. Participants completed a set of instruments for assessment of aggression and impulsivity traits.In the Idu Mishimi population we screened (n = 177), 22.03% of the individuals had attempted suicide, a high percentage. The suicide attempters also showed a significant sex difference: 35.9% were male and 64.10% were female (p = .002*). The suicide attempters (A) scored significantly higher than non-attempters (NA) on aggression (A = 23.93,NA = 18.46) and impulsivity (A = 75.53,NA = 71.59, with p value = 0.05). The trait impulsiveness showed a significantly higher difference (F (1, 117) = 7.274) in comparison to aggression (F (1, 117) = 2.647), suggesting a profound role of impulsiveness in suicide attempts in the Idu Mishmi population. Analysis of sub-traits of aggression and impulsivity revealed significant correlations between them. Using different models, multivariate logistic regression implied roles of gender (OR = 1.079 (0.05)) and impulsiveness (OR = 3.355 (0.013)) in suicide attempts.Results demonstrate that gender and impulsivity are strong risk factors for suicide attempts in the Idu Mishmi population."

While the viruses exhibit unique biological and molecular characters distinct from known enterovirus E, the pathogenicity and viral pathogenesis remains largely unknown.Neonatal mice of Balb/C, ICR, and Kunming strain are infected with HY12 to determine the susceptible mouse strain. The minimal infection dose, the virus infection routes, the pathogenicity and tissue tropism for HY12 were determined by infecting susceptible mice with HY12 viruses, and confirmed by different approaches including virus isolation and recovery, virus detection, histopathology, and immunohistochemistry.A murine model for HY12 infection was successfully established and employed to investigate the pathogenicity of HY12 viruses. ICR mouse strain is the most susceptible strain for HY12 infection with a minimal infective dose as 2×106TCID50/mouse. HY12 viruses have the capability of infecting ICR suckling mice via all infection routes including intranasal administration, oral administration, intraperitoneal injection, subcutaneous injection, and intramuscular injection, which are confirmed by the isolation and recovery of viruses from HY12-infected mice; detection of viruses by RT-PCR; observations of pathological lesions and inflammatory cell infiltrations in the intestine, lung, liver, and brain; uncovering of HY12 virus antigens in majority of tissues, especially in intestine, lung, and infected brain of mice by immunohistochemistry assay.A neonatal murine model for HY12 infection is successfully established for determining the susceptible mouse strain, the minimal infective dose, the infection route, the viral pathogenicity and the tropism of HY12, thus providing an invaluable model system for elucidating the pathogenesis of HY12 viruses and the elicited immunity."

Nevertheless, the major hurdle of haESC application is spontaneous diploidization of haploid cells along cell passages. Diploidization is one specific characteristic of haESCs (1Bai M. Wu Y. Li J.

However, detailed differences in mitosis between haploid cells and diploid cells and the molecular mechanisms underlying diploidization for generating haESCs with more stable haploidy remain to be uncovered (22He Z.Q.

To date, haploidy maintenance in the long term still needs regular FACS to enrich haploid cells. This is a complicated procedure in which haESCs are first stained with Hoechst 33342 and then employed for haploid cell enrichment according to DNA content using a flow cytometer (24Zhong C. Li J. Efficient generation of gene-modified mice by haploid embryonic stem cell-mediated semi-cloned technology.Methods Mol. Biol. 2017; 1498 (27709572): 121-13310.1007/978-1-4939-6472-7_8Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In this study, we describe a simple but efficient filtration method for long-term haESC maintenance without hampering haESC physiology and functionality. This method provides an alternative way to maintain haploidy and will greatly promote the application of haESCs. A cell flow cytometer can separate Hoechst 33342–stained haESCs into three groups according to DNA content: 1C (haploid cells in G0/G1 phase), 2C (haploid cells in G2/M phase and diploid cells in G0/G1 phase), and 4C (diploid cells in G2/M phase) (24Zhong C. Li J. Efficient generation of gene-modified mice by haploid embryonic stem cell-mediated semi-cloned technology.Methods Mol. Biol. 2017; 1498 (27709572): 121-13310.1007/978-1-4939-6472-7_8Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Cell size analyses showed that the average diameter of 1C, 2C, and 4C in mouse haESCs is 8.3 μm, 9.5 μm, and 10.8 μm, respectively (Fig. 1A), indicating an obvious size difference among cells with different DNA content. Parthenogenetic haESCs (PG-haESCs) have a similar size as AG-haESCs with same DNA content (Fig. 1A). These results suggest that 1C cells might be directly purified from a cell mixture by physical filtration based on their size. To test this, we assembled a filter using commercialized membranes with a pore size of 5 or 8 μm (Fig. 1B). A haESC suspension could be easily filtered through our device, and both 5- and 8-μm pore size membranes could be used efficiently to enrich haploid cells (Fig. 1C). Membranes with 5-μm pore size showed a higher efficiency compared with 8 μm pores, indicating that smaller pores block more large cells. To optimize the filtration conditions, we performed systematic experiments to test whether the cell concentration before filtration and pore size of the filter membrane would affect the filtration results. Cell suspensions with different concentrations were used for filtration, and filtrates were collected for analyzing the ratio of 1C cells. The results showed that haploid cells could be efficiently enriched from cell suspensions of different concentrations by using membranes with both a 5-μm and 8-μm pore size, and efficiency was higher in initial filtered drops, suggesting that if enough filtered cells were obtained for experiments, then the later drops could be discarded (Fig. S1, A–C). Meanwhile, membranes with a 5-μm pore size exhibited a relatively better enrichment efficiency compared with that 8-μm pore size, consistent with the results in Fig. 1C. Next we asked whether filtration could be used to maintain the haploidy of mouse haESCs stably for long-term in vitro culturing. To test this, we used two haploid cells lines, H19▵DMR-IG▵DMR-AGH (O48) and H19▵DMR-IG▵DMR-AGH-OG3 (408), generated previously (12Zhong C. Yin Q. Xie Z. Bai M. Dong R. Tang W. Xing Y.H. Zhang H. Yang S. Chen L.L. Bartolomei M.S. Ferguson-Smith A. Li D. Yang L. Wu Y. Li J. CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genetic screening in mice with haploid embryonic stem cells carrying a guide RNA library.Cell Stem Cell. 2015; 17 (26165924): 221-23210.1016/j.stem.2015.06.005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). As expected, the haploidy of both cell lines could be well maintained with regular filtration using membranes with 5- or 8-μm pore size for over 30 passages (Fig. 1D and S1D). Taken together, these results demonstrate that filtration can serve as an effective method to maintain mouse haESCs. Having demonstrated that filtration can be efficiently employed to enrich haploid cells, we next examined whether haESCs maintained by regular filtration are functionally equivalent to those from regular FACS enrichment. We first tested the proliferation and colony formation abilities of the filtered cells. To do this, we plated cells obtained by different strategies and counted the total cell and colony numbers after 3 and 5 days, respectively. Compared with haploid cells enriched by FACS with or without Hoechst 33342 staining, filtered cells had better cell vitality and colony formation ability in the first passage (Fig. 2, A and B). Moreover, cells enriched by FACS need more time to recover from the damage caused by the FACS procedures, but filtered cells required less time to recover, indicating that there is less damage caused by filtration. These results imply that filtration might avoid the potential damage induced by the low cytotoxicity of Hoechst staining (25Wiezorek C. Cell cycle dependence of Hoechst 33342 dye cytotoxicity on sorted living cells.Histochemistry. 1984; 81 (6083997): 493-49510.1007/BF00489756Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 26Durand R.E.

AG-haESCs carrying both H19-DMR and IG-DMR deletions (DKO-AG-haESCs) could be used as the sperm replacement to efficiently produce SC mice through ICAHCI (12Zhong C. Yin Q. Xie Z. Bai M. Dong R.

We then tested whether DKO-AG-haESCs maintained by regular filtration are still feasible for generation of SC mice. To do this, DKO-AG-haESCs, after multiple rounds of filtration, were used as donors for ICAHCI. The results indicated that, as expected, all tested cells were capable of efficiently generating SC mice (Fig. 2, C and D), further confirming that haESCs enriched by filtration preserve normal function as those from FACS. Because AG-haESCs are a feasible tool for genetic modifications using CRISPR-Cas9 and ICAHCI to give pups carrying the corresponding genetic traits (12Zhong C. Yin Q. Xie Z. Bai M. Dong R. Tang W.

We first attempted induction of large deletion in a gene of interest, Iqgap2 (27Vaitheesvaran B. Hartil K. Navare A. Zheng C. OBroin P. Golden A. Guha C. Lee W. Kurland I.J. Bruce J.E.

We transfected constructs expressing Cas9 and two sgRNAs targeting exon 17 and exon 30, respectively, which may cause a 35-kb deletion (Fig. 3A). The results showed no significant difference in transfection efficiency and generation of mutant cell lines between cells enriched by filtration and FACS (Fig. 3B and Table S1). A total of 21 stable haploid cell lines were generated through the filtration method. DNA sequencing analyses indicated that four of 21 carried an expected mutation of 35-kb deletion. We next tested whether, through filtration, a precise point mutation could be inserted into Crygc by transfection of both CRISPR and donor DNA with the 1-bp deletion in filtered DKO-AG-hESCs (23Zhao H.

As expected, haploid cell lines with the point mutation could be efficiently generated in filtrated cells (Table S1). Finally, we performed ICHACI using filtered haploid cells carrying a 35-kb deletion in Iqgap2 from the cell line of 2-1 as donors. Of 215 transferred SC embryos, a total of 42 live pups were born naturally (Fig. 3D), consistent with our previous observations that pregnant females carrying SC embryos from DKO-AG-haESCs could deliver pups by themselves (12Zhong C.

Genotyping analyses indicated that all of them carried heterozygous deletion in Iqgap2 (Fig. 3E). Taken together, these point out that our enrichment method does not hamper the vitality and functional integrity of haESCs and that filtration is a reliable procedure to maintain haploidy. We also explored the potential use of filtration in generating haESCs from haploid PG blastocysts obtained by artificial activation. PG haploid blastocysts were cultured in a standard ESC culture system supplemented with 2i (MEK and GSK inhibitors) (11Yang H. Shi L. Wang B.A. Liang D. Zhong C. Liu W. Nie Y. Liu J. Zhao J. Gao X.

Eight ESC lines were generated and subjected to filtration to enrich for haploid 1C cells, leading to the establishment of PG-haESC lines (Fig. 4A). Finally, we tested whether filtration could be adopted for maintenance of human haESCs, which we generated previously (8Zhong C. Zhang M. Yin Q. Zhao H. Wang Y. Huang S. Tao W. Wu K. Chen Z.J. Li J. Generation of human haploid embryonic stem cells from parthenogenetic embryos obtained by microsurgical removal of male pronucleus.Cell Res. 2016; 26 (27185278): 743-74610.1038/cr.2016.59Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To this, we first performed size analyses and found that the diameters of 1C, 2C, and 4C in human haESCs are 9.7 μm, 10.8 μm, and 11.9 μm (Fig. 4B), respectively. We then chose a filter membrane with 8-μm pore size for filtration of human haESCs. Consistently, our method could well preserve the haploidy of human haESCs (Fig. 4C). These results indicate that filtration has a broad use with haESCs from different species. Mammalian haESCs have been proven to be invaluable for genetic analysis (1Bai M. Wu Y. Li J.

However, self-diploidization, an intrinsic feature of haESCs, limits their broad application because of a requirement of frequent FACS to enrich haploid cells regularly. FACS is large device–dependent, high-cost, and complicated, which may generate some unexpected mutations by Hoechst, laser, and voltage in sorted cells (25Wiezorek C. Cell cycle dependence of Hoechst 33342 dye cytotoxicity on sorted living cells.Histochemistry. 1984; 81 (6083997): 493-49510.1007/BF00489756Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 26Durand R.E. Olive P.L. Cytotoxicity, mutagenicity and DNA damage by Hoechst 33342.J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1982; 30 (7061816): 111-11610.1177/30.2.7061816Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Here we establish a new strategy to isolate haploid cells from diploidized cells through filtration, which is an easy, efficient, stable, and reliable method for long-term maintenance of haESCs. We only tested 5- and 8-μm pore membranes in this study, but considering the size and plasticity of haploid cells, with choices of 6- or 7-μm pore membranes if commercially available, we might achieve a better balance between efficiency and yield. Nevertheless, our method enriches mouse and human haploid cells at relatively high ratios, and enriched cells by filtration preserve not only their vitality well but also their functional integrity. In addition, filtration has several obvious advantages over FACS, such as convenient handling, less physical damage to cells, no cell toxicity, and economy. Our method works on both mouse haESCs and human haESCs, and with proper pore size membranes, it can also be applied to haESCs from other species. During the preparation of this work for publication, an independent group also reported filtration-mediated enrichment of mouse PG-haESCs (33Freimann R. Wutz A. A fast and efficient size separation method for haploid embryonic stem cells.Biomicrofluidics. 2017; 11 (054117) (29152028)10.1063/1.5006326Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In comparison with their separation unit using hydrostatic pressure to separate cells, our filter is assembled much easier, and the filtration process is simpler, steadier, and more reliable. All parts of the filter can be subjected to sterilization. Meanwhile, beside mouse haESCs, we also demonstrated that filtration can be used to maintain human haESCs. Moreover, we explored the use of filtration to derive haploid cell lines from blastocysts and establish gene-modified AG-haESCs, followed by generation of SC mice with corresponding genetic traits through ICAHCI. Interestingly, we showed that both 5-μm and 8-μm pore size membranes can be adopted for filtration. In contrast, Freimann and Wutz (33Freimann R. Wutz A. A fast and efficient size separation method for haploid embryonic stem cells.Biomicrofluidics. 2017; 11 (054117) (29152028)10.1063/1.5006326Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) reported that 5 μm did not work in their system. One potential reason could be that the pressure induced by syringe in our device is higher than their hydrostatic pressure. Actually, in our system, a 5-μm pore size membrane allows us to obtain haploid cells at high efficiency without causing detectable damage (Fig. 2, A and B). In summary, filtration is an efficient and simple method for maintenance of haESCs. A future study needs to be done to fine-tune the filtration procedures. In the meantime, we hope that the method we have developed will facilitate the application of haESCs in genetic analysis. Mouse haESCs were cultured in a standard ESC culture system supplemented with 2i (MEK and GSK inhibitors) (11Yang H. Shi L. Wang B.A. Liang D. Zhong C. Liu W. Nie Y. Liu J. Zhao J. Gao X. Li D.

Cells were dissociated by 0.05% trypsin–EDTA and passaged regularly every 2–3 days. Human haESCs were cultured in mTeSRTM1 (Stem Cell) with 10 μm Y-27632 (Selleck), disassociated by Accutase, and passaged regularly every 4–8 days. Plates were coated with Matrigel matrix (Corning, with a 1:100 dilution) overnight before passage to increase attachment of cells.

HaESCs were dissociated into single cells and incubated with 15 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 in a 37 °C water bath for 5 min. Sorting was then conducted by using FACS Aria II (BD Biosciences). When sorting haploid cells without Hoechst staining, we used the same cells that were stained with Hoechst 33342 to help us to gate cells containing 1C in the forward-scattered light (FSC) and side-scattered light (SSC) coordinate plane system. FACS was performed to purify 1C, 2C, and 4C peaks. Cell diameters were then measured by using CountessTM (Invitrogen). A filter was composed of a 25-mm filter holder (Millipore, SX0002500) and a membrane with 5-μm pores (Millipore, TMTP02500) or 8-μm pores (Millipore, TETP02500). The filter holders were sterilized by autoclaving, and membranes were sterilized by 25-kilogray γ-rays. The concentrations of cell suspensions used for filtration affect the distribution of cell numbers and percentages of 1C in filtered drops (Fig. S1, A–C). For a 5-μm-pore membrane, 2 ml of cell suspension with a concentration about 1 × 106/ml was prepared, and the initial approximately 20 drops were collected for plating in a well of a 96-well plate. For an 8-μm-pore membrane, 1 ml of cell suspension with a concentration about 5 × 105/ml was prepared, and the initial approximately 10 drops were collected and plated in a well of a 96-well plate. Cells were passaged to a well of a 6-well plate 2–3 days later. When enriching human haESCs, we used 8-μm filters and collected enough filtered cells to plate in a well of a 48-well plate. Movie S1 shows the workflow of filtration. Haploid cells enriched by filtration and FACS were collected to evaluate cell proliferation and colony-forming abilities. For cell proliferation ability, 45,000 cells enriched by each method were cultured in a well of a 24-well plate. After 3 days, cells were dissociated and counted by CountessTM. For colony-forming efficiency, 4000 cells were plated into a well of a 12-well plate. After 5 days, the colony number in each well was estimated. All animal procedures were performed under the ethical guidelines of the Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology. Oocytes of B6D2F1 (C57BL/6 × DBA2) were obtained from superovulated females and activated for 5 h in activation medium. Embryos were then cultured in EmbryoMax® KSOM+amino acids with d-glucose (Millipore) at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in air until blastocysts formed. After removing the zona pellucida by acid Tyrode’s solution, each blastocyst was transferred into a well of a 96-well plate covered with feeder cells. After around 1 week, colonies were passaged to 96-well plates. About 4 days later, cells were passaged to 24-well or 12-well plates. Filtration experiments were then performed to enrich haESCs (34Yang H. Shi L. Zhang S. Ling J. Jiang J. Li J.

SgRNAs targeting Iqgap2 were connected to pX458, which expresses green fluorescent protein. The sgRNA of Crygc was connected to the pX330-mCherry plasmid, which expresses red fluorescence protein (Addgene, 98750) (29Wu Y. Liang D. Wang Y. Bai M. Tang W. Bao S. Yan Z. Li D. Li J.

When constructing the double-stranded DNA donor, the sequences of the left arm and right arm were amplified from the genome and inserted into the EcoR V site of the pMD19T vector (Takara) using the Seamless Cloning Kit (Beyotime). AG-haESCs were transfected with corresponding plasmids using Lipofectamine 3000 (Thermo Fisher). 20–48 h after transfection, haploid cells expressing green or red fluorescent protein were enriched by FACS and plated into a well of a 6-well plate at a low density. Single colonies were picked and passaged to a well of a 96-well plate after 5–8 days. Filtration was performed for enrichment of haploid cells. Related sequences are listed in Table S2.

https://openalex.org/W2791520991,"Gp96 is an endoplasmic reticulum chaperone for multiple protein substrates. Its lack in intestinal macrophages of Crohn's disease (CD) patients is correlated with loss of tolerance against the host gut flora. Gp96 has been stablished to be an essential chaperone for Toll-like receptors (TLRs). We studied the impact of gp96-knockdown on TLR-function in macrophages. TLR2 and TLR4 expression was only decreased but not abolished when gp96 was knocked-down in cell lines, whereas in a monocyte/macrophage specific knock-out mouse model (LysMCre) TLR4 was abolished, while TLR2 was still present. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced NF-κB activation was still observed in the absence of gp96, and gp96-deficient macrophages were able to up-regulate surface TLR4 upon LPS treatment, suggesting that there is another chaperone involved in the folding of TLR4 upon stress responses. Moreover, LPS-dependent pro-inflammatory cytokines were still expressed, although to a lesser extent in the absence of gp96, which reinforces the fact that gp96 is involved in regulating signaling cascades downstream of TLR4 are impaired upon loss of gp96. In addition, we have also found a reduced phosphorylation of ERK and p38 kinases and an impaired response upon CSF1R activation in gp96 deficient macrophages. Our findings indicate that the loss of gp96 not only impairs TLR4 signaling, but is also associated with a diminished phosphorylation of ERK and mitogen-activated stress kinases resulting in an impaired signalling through several receptors, including CSF1R."
https://openalex.org/W2786331276,"Lake Superior′s ecosystem includes distinct nearshore and offshore food webs linked by hydrodynamic processes that transport water and tracers along and across shore. The scales over which these processes occur and their sensitivity to increasing summer surface temperatures are not well understood. This study investigated horizontal mixing between nearshore and offshore areas of Lake Superior over the 10-year period from 2003 to 2012 using a realistically forced three-dimensional numerical model and virtual tracers. An age tracer was used to characterize the time scales of horizontal mixing between nearshore areas of the lake where water depth is less than 100 m and deeper areas. The age of water in nearshore areas increased and decreased in an annual cycle corresponding to the lake′s dimictic cycle of vertical mixing and stratification. Interannual variability of mixing in the isothermal period was significantly correlated to average springtime wind speed, whereas variability during the stratified season was correlated to the average summer surface temperature. Dispersal of a passive tracer released from nine locations around the model lake’s perimeter was more extensive in late summer when stratification was established lakewide than in early summer. The distribution of eddies resolved in the model reflected differences between the early and late summer dispersal patterns. In the eastern part of the lake dispersal was primarily alongshore, reflecting counterclockwise coastal circulation. In the western part of the lake, cross-shore mixing was enhanced by cross-basin currents."

People with PRVS were reported to have reduced sensitivity to global motion at baseline testing and the difference disappears at a second estimate. The present study was to investigate the effect of practice on global motion threshold in adults with and without PRVS.A total of 101 subjects were recruited and the Wilkins & Evans Pattern Glare Test was used to determine if a subject had PRVS. The threshold to detect global motion was measured with a random dot kinematogram. Each subject was measured 5 times at the first visit and again a month later. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was applied to show the agreement between the two tests.Twenty-nine subjects were classified as having PRVS and 72 were classified as normal. At baseline, the threshold to detect global motion was significantly higher in subjects with PRVS (0.832 ± 0.098 vs. 0.618 ± 0.228, p < 0.001). After 5 sessions, the difference between the normal and subjects with PRVS increased (0.767 ± 0.170 vs. 0.291 ± 0.149, p < 0.001). In ROC analysis, the area under the curve (AUC) improved from 0.792 at baseline to 0.964 at the fifth session. After a one-month break, the difference between normal and subjects with PRVS was still significant (0.843 ± 0.169 vs. 0.407 ± 0.216, p < 0.001) and the AUC was 0.875.The ability to detect global motion is impaired in persons with PRVS and the difference increased after additional sessions of practice."
https://openalex.org/W2787197819,"The incidence of obesity in children and adolescents, which may lead to type 2 diabetes, is increasing. Exercise is recommended to prevent and improve diabetes. However, little is known about the bone marrow environment at the onset of diabetes in the young, and it is unclear whether exercise training is useful for maintaining bone homeostasis, such as mechanical and histological properties. Thus, this study clarified the histological properties of bone and whether exercise contributes to maintaining bone homeostasis at the onset of type 2 diabetes in rats. Four-week-old male Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF; n = 21) rats as a diabetic model and Long-Evans Tokushima Otsuka (LETO; n = 18) rats as a control were assigned randomly to four groups: the OLETF sedentary group (O-Sed; n = 11), OLETF exercise group (O-Ex; n = 10), LETO sedentary group (L-Sed; n = 9), and LETO exercise group (L-Ex; n = 9). All rats in the exercise group were allowed free access to a steel running wheel for 20 weeks (5-25 weeks of age). In the glucose tolerance test, blood glucose level was higher in the O-Sed group than that in the L-Sed and L-Ex groups, and was markedly suppressed by the voluntary running exercise of O-Ex rats. The energy to fracture and the two-dimensional bone volume at 25 weeks of age did not differ significantly among the groups, though the maximum breaking force and stiffness were lower in OLETF rats. However, bone marrow fat volume was greater in O-Sed than that in L-Sed and L-Ex rats, and was markedly suppressed by wheel running in the O-Ex rats. Our results indicate that exercise has beneficial effects not only for preventing diabetes but also on normal bone remodeling at an early age."

https://openalex.org/W2794186215,"Dystroglycan (DG) is a membrane receptor, belonging to the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) and formed by two subunits, α-dystroglycan (α-DG) and β-dystroglycan (β -DG). The C-terminal domain of α-DG and the N-terminal extracellular domain of β -DG are connected, providing a link between the extracellular matrix and the cytosol. Under pathological conditions, such as cancer and muscular dystrophies, DG may be the target of metalloproteinases MMP-2 and MMP-9, contributing to disease progression. Previously, we reported that the C-terminal domain α-DG (483–628) domain is particularly susceptible to the catalytic activity of MMP-2; here we show that the α-DG 621–628 region is required to carry out its complete digestion, suggesting that this portion may represent a MMP-2 anchoring site. Following this observation, we synthesized an α-DG based-peptide, spanning the (613–651) C-terminal region. The analysis of the kinetic and thermodynamic parameters of the whole and the isolated catalytic domain of MMP-2 (cdMMP-2) has shown its inhibitory properties, indicating the presence of (at least) two binding sites for the peptide, both located within the catalytic domain, only one of the two being topologically distinct from the catalytic active groove. However, the different behavior between whole MMP-2 and cdMMP-2 envisages the occurrence of an additional binding site for the peptide on the hemopexin-like domain of MMP-2. Interestingly, mass spectrometry analysis has shown that α-DG (613–651) peptide is cleavable even though it is a very poor substrate of MMP-2, a feature that renders this molecule a promising template for developing a selective MMP-2 inhibitor."
