https://openalex.org/W1982284435,"In the paper ""Pi electron systems at high pressure"" [Science 156, 1183 (1967)] a mechanism is suggested for the high-pressure reactions of perylene and azulene complexes with tetracyanoethylene (Figs. lOb and lOc) which is clearly impossible as drawn. What I had meant to suggest is the reaction shown below (with Fig. lOb as an example), which is at least conceivable, if not very probable from the chemical viewpoint. A similar modification would apply to Fig. lOc. As indicated in the paper, any serious study of the reaction requires the synthesis of enough product for more complete analysis, as well as a fairly detailed knowledge of the crystal geometry of the unreacted complex.

Charles Sanders Peirce, with characteristic insight, had stated the fundamental dilemma of the pure scientist operating within a democratic framework. How can one ask the public to provide support, much less facilities, for the intellectual gratification of one select group? A part of the answer, of course, is simply that one cannot. As long as a group is dependent upon public support it must seek some means of contact with the values of the enveloping society, and the moment it does this it departs in some measure from the ideal purity. The schizophrenic attitude described by Dubos therefore became a professional necessity as soon as the new ideal was adopted. Since the time of Gould, scientists have been able to tell each other that the man who based science's claim to support on grounds of immediate practical utility was ""no loyal follower and true friend of science"" and, at the same time, to trust that the popularizers and technicians would convey a different message to the public. On the whole, they have not been disappointed in their expectation, and there has been little need for them to go beyond the standard formula : Utility is not to be a test of scientific work, but all knowledge will ultimately prove useful. Since the continued existence of scientists in this society depends upon the believability of that vague claim, there is little likelihood hood that the schizophrenia will disappear."

The cosmic microwave background radiation, considered a relic of the explosion at the beginning of the universe some 18 billion years ago, is one of the most powerful aids in determining these features of the universe. This paper is about the discovery of the cosmic microwave background radiation. It starts with a section on radio astronomical measuring techniques. This is followed by the history of the detection of the background radiation, its identification, and finally by a summary of our present knowledge of its properties. II. RADIO ASTRONOMICAL METHOD S A radio telescope pointing at the sky receives radiation not only from space ,but also from other sources including the ground, the earthâ€™s atmosphere, and the components of the radio telescope itself. The 20-foot horn-reflector antenna at Bell Laboratories (Fig. 1) which was used to discover the cosmic microwave background radiation was particularly suited to distinguish this weak, uniform radiation from other, much stronger sources. In order to understand this measurement it is necessary to discuss the design and operation of a radio telescope, especially its two major components, the antenna and the radiometer 1 . a. Antennas An antenna collects radiation from a desired direction incident upon an area, called its collecting area, and focuses it on a receiver. An antenna is normally designed to maximize its response in the direction in which it is pointed and minimize its response in other directions. The 20-foot horn-reflector shown in Fig. 1 was built by A. B. Crawford and his associate? in 1960 to be used with an ultra low-noise communications receiver for signals bounced from the Echo satellite. It consists of a large expanding waveguide, or horn ,with an off-axis section parabolic reflector at the end. The focus of the paraboloid is located at the apex of the horn, so that a plane wave traveling along the axis of the paraboloid is focused into the receiver, or radiometer, at the apex of the horn. Its design emphasizes the rejection of radiation from the ground. It is easy to see"

The calculated geostrophic velocities are consistent with results of descriptive water-structure studies."

The effects of volcanic effluents, gas and dust, on obscuration in the atmosphere are considered. The optical extinction due to particulate matter is estimated from assumed distributions as to particle size and altitude. As few as ten explosive eruptions per annum would cause significant absorption and scattering of visible light."

It seems that magnetic atoms, ions, and molecules in planetary atmospheres may be detected by this method. These cbservations were made with the topside ionosonder of the Canadian satellite Alouette II."

But, in developing the next generation of reactors, a new set of problems must be overcome. One of the most important of these is that of the embrittlement of the structural materials at high temperatures as a result of the intense neutron fields in these advanced systems."

https://openalex.org/W2067460694,Apparent shear stress in turbulent flow between a stationary inner cylinder and a rotating outer cylinder is measured by computing radial flux of tangential momentum by use of velocities obtained from photographs of successive positions of marker particles assumed to represent the fluid motion. Values are consistent with total shear stress at the inner cylinder found by measuring the velocity gradient.
