https://openalex.org/W3112267003,"Background Coagulation abnormalities in COVID-19 patients have not been addressed in depth. Objective To perform a longitudinal evaluation of coagulation profile of patients admitted to the ICU with COVID-19. Methods Conventional coagulation tests, rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM), platelet function, fibrinolysis, antithrombin, protein C and S were measured at days 0, 1, 3, 7 and 14. Based on median total maximum SOFA score, patients were divided in two groups: SOFA ≤ 10 and SOFA &gt; 10. Results Thirty patients were studied. Some conventional coagulation tests, as aPTT, PT and INR remained unchanged during the study period, while alterations on others coagulation laboratory tests were detected. Fibrinogen levels were increased in both groups. ROTEM maximum clot firmness increased in both groups from Day 0 to Day 14. Moreover, ROTEM–FIBTEM maximum clot firmness was high in both groups, with a slight decrease from day 0 to day 14 in group SOFA ≤ 10 and a slight increase during the same period in group SOFA &gt; 10. Fibrinolysis was low and decreased over time in all groups, with the most pronounced decrease observed in INTEM maximum lysis in group SOFA &gt; 10. Also, D-dimer plasma levels were higher than normal reference range in both groups and free protein S plasma levels were low in both groups at baseline and increased over time, Finally, patients in group SOFA &gt; 10 had lower plasminogen levels and Protein C ​​than patients with SOFA &lt;10, which may represent less fibrinolysis activity during a state of hypercoagulability. Conclusion COVID-19 patients have a pronounced hypercoagulability state, characterized by impaired endogenous anticoagulation and decreased fibrinolysis. The magnitude of coagulation abnormalities seems to correlate with the severity of organ dysfunction. The hypercoagulability state of COVID-19 patients was not only detected by ROTEM but it much more complex, where changes were observed on the fibrinolytic and endogenous anticoagulation system."
https://openalex.org/W3111248090,"Migraine with aura is a common but poorly understood sensory circuit disorder. Monogenic models allow an opportunity to investigate its mechanisms, including spreading depolarization (SD), the phenomenon underlying migraine aura. Using fluorescent glutamate imaging, we show that awake mice carrying a familial hemiplegic migraine type 2 (FHM2) mutation have slower clearance during sensory processing, as well as previously undescribed spontaneous ""plumes"" of glutamate. Glutamatergic plumes overlapped anatomically with a reduced density of GLT-1a-positive astrocyte processes and were mimicked in wild-type animals by inhibiting glutamate clearance. Plume pharmacology and plume-like neural Ca2+ events were consistent with action-potential-independent spontaneous glutamate release, suggesting plumes are a consequence of inefficient clearance following synaptic release. Importantly, a rise in basal glutamate and plume frequency predicted the onset of SD in both FHM2 and wild-type mice, providing a novel mechanism in migraine with aura and, by extension, the other neurological disorders where SD occurs."
https://openalex.org/W3111488141,"The ε4 allele of the apolipoprotein E gene (APOE4) is a strong genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and multiple vascular conditions. ApoE is abundantly expressed in multiple brain cell types, including astrocytes, microglia, and vascular mural cells (VMCs). Here, we show that VMC-specific expression of apoE4 in mice impairs behavior and cerebrovascular function. Expression of either apoE3 or apoE4 in VMCs was sufficient to rescue the hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis phenotypes seen in Apoe knockout mice. Intriguingly, vascular expression of apoE4, but not apoE3, reduced arteriole blood flow, impaired spatial learning, and increased anxiety-like phenotypes. Single-cell RNA sequencing of vascular and glial cells revealed that apoE4 in VMCs was associated with astrocyte activation, while apoE3 was linked to angiogenic signature in pericytes. Together, our data support cell-autonomous effects of vascular apoE on brain homeostasis in an isoform-dependent manner, suggesting a critical contribution of vascular apoE to AD pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W3113068017,"Understanding the relationship between exogenous melatonin and water deficit stress is crucial for alleviating the effects of water deficit stress at germination stage of soybean ( Glycine max (L . ) Merrill ) in agriculture. This study investigated the effects of exogenous melatonin on soybean antioxidant properties and cell ultrastructure under water deficit stress induced by polyethylene glycol (PEG) 6000. The drought-sensitive soybean variety Suinong 26 was used as the material to study the effects of different concentrations of melatonin (0, 300, 500 μmol·L -1 ) soaking soybean seeds under drought stress (PEG-6000: 3% and 6%). The results showed that the germination rate (GR), germination potential (GP), germination index (GI) and radicle shape of soybean were affected negatively to different degrees under PEG stress. Moreover, stress induced by different PEG concentrations overproduced the content of reactive oxygen species (H 2 O 2 , O 2 ·− ) in cells, leading to increased lipid membrane peroxidation as electrolyte leakage (EL) and malondialdehyde (MDA) content, which resulted in impaired cell integrity. However, after seeds soaking with melatonin, the lipid peroxidation of the cell membrane was reduced, and the activities of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), catalase (CAT), and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) further increased to minimize the excessive generation of ROS. Similar results were obtained for soluble protein and proline, that may help in regulating the osmotic pressure and maintain cellular integrity. With the interaction of these enzymes, compared with 300 μmol·L -1 melatonin, 500 μmol·L -1 melatonin could more effective to remove the ROS and reduce cell peroxidation. Overall, 500 μmol·L -1 melatonin performed better than 300 μmol·L -1 . In conclusion, the seed soaking with melatonin promoted the germination of soybean seeds under water stress."
https://openalex.org/W3111878508,"When the population risk factors and reporting systems are similar, the assessment of the case-fatality (or lethality) rate (ratio of cases to deaths) represents a perfect tool for analyzing, understanding and improving the overall efficiency of the health system. The objective of this article is to estimate the influence of the hospital care system on lethality in metropolitan France during the inception of the COVID-19 epidemic, by analyzing the spatial variability of the hospital case-fatality rate (CFR) between French districts. In theory, the hospital age-standardized CFR should not display significant differences between districts, since hospital lethality depends on the virulence of the pathogen (the SARS-CoV-2 virus), the vulnerability of the population (mainly age-related), the healthcare system quality, and cases and deaths definition and the recording accuracy. We analyzed hospital data on COVID-19 hospitalizations, severity (admission to intensive care units for reanimation or endotracheal intubation) and mortality, from March 19 to May 8 corresponding to the first French lockdown. All rates were age-standardized to eliminate differences in districts age structure. The results show that the higher case-fatality rates observed by districts are mostly related to the level of morbidity. Time analysis shows that the case-fatality rate has decreased over time, globally and in almost all districts, showing an improvement in the management of severe patients during the epidemic. In conclusion, it appears that during the first critical phase of COVID-19 ramping epidemic in metropolitan France, the higher case-fatality rates were generally related to the higher level of hospitalization, then potentially related to the overload of healthcare system. Also, low hospitalization with high case-fatality rates were mostly found in districts with low population density, and could due to some limitation of the local healthcare access. However, the magnitude of this increase of case-fatality rate represents less than 10 per cent of the average case-fatality rate, and this variation is small compared to much greater variation across countries reported in the literature."
https://openalex.org/W3113307227,"Objectives To evaluate if depression contributes, independently and/or in interaction with frailty, to loss of independence in instrumental activities of daily living (ADL) in older adults with frailty. Methods Longitudinal cohort study of people aged ≥75 years living in the community. We used multi-level linear regression model to quantify the relationship between depression (≥5 Geriatric Depression Scale) and frailty (electronic frailty index), and instrumental activities of daily living (Nottingham Extended Activities of Daily Living scale; range: 0–66; higher score implies greater independence). The model was adjusted for known confounders (age; gender; ethnicity; education; living situation; medical comorbidity). Results 553 participants were included at baseline; 53% were female with a mean age of 81 (5.0 SD) years. Depression and frailty (moderate and severe levels) were independently associated with reduced instrumental activities of daily living scores. In the adjusted analysis, the regression coefficient was -6.4 (95% CI: -8.3 to -4.5, p&lt;0.05) for depression, -1.5 (95% CI: -3.8 to 0.9, p = 0.22) for mild frailty, -6.1 (95% CI: -8.6 to -3.6, p&lt;0.05) for moderate frailty, and -10.1 (95% CI: -13.5 to -6.8, p&lt;0.05) for severe frailty. Moreover, depression interacted with frailty to further reduce instrumental activities of daily living score in individuals with mild or moderate frailty. These relationships remained significant after adjusting for confounders. Conclusion Frailty and depression are independently associated with reduced independence in instrumental activities of daily living. Also, depression interacts with frailty to further reduce independence for mild to moderately frail individuals, suggesting that clinical management of frailty should integrate physical and mental health care."
https://openalex.org/W3112691908,"Aim To assess the distribution and deposition of aerosols during simulated periodontal therapy. Methods A manikin with simulated fluorescein salivation was treated by four experienced dentists applying two different periodontal treatment options, i.e. air-polishing with an airflow device or ultrasonic scaling in the upper and lower anterior front for 5 minutes, respectively. Aerosol deposition was quantitatively measured on 21 pre-defined locations with varying distances to the manikins mouth in triplicates using absorbent filter papers. Results The selected periodontal interventions resulted in different contamination levels around the patient’s mouth. The highest contamination could be measured on probes on the patient’s chest and forehead but also on the practitioner’s glove. With increasing distance to the working site contamination of the probes decreased with both devices. Air-polishing led to greater contamination than ultrasonic. Conclusion Both devices showed contamination of the nearby structures, less contamination was detected when using the ultrasonic. Affirming the value of wearing protective equipment we support the need for universal barrier precautions and effective routine infection control in dental practice."
https://openalex.org/W3112597064,"Background Ethiopia reported a high rate of extra-pulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB) and the cases are increasing since the last three decades. However, diagnostic evidence to initiate TB treatment among EPTB cases is not well known. Therefore, we described the epidemiology and assessed how EPTB is diagnosed in a teaching hospital in Ethiopia. Methods We conducted a retrospective review among all adult EPTB cases diagnosed in Yekatit 12 Hospital Medical College from 2015 to 2019. Using a standardized data abstraction sheet, we collected data from patients’ medical records on sociodemographic, sites, and laboratory diagnosis of EPTB cases. Results Of the 965 total TB cases, 49.8%(481) had a recorded diagnosis of EPTB during the study period. The mean age of EPTB patients was 32.9 years (SD±13.9) and 50.7% were males. Tubercular lymphadenitis (40.3%), abdominal (23.4%), and pleural TB(13.5%) were the most common sites of EPTB involvement, followed in descending order by the genitourinary, skeletal, central nervous system, abscess, breast, and laryngeal TB. We found a histopathology finding consistent with EPTB in 59.1% of cases, Acid-fast bacilli positive in 1.5%, and the rest diagnosed on radiological grounds. In the majority of cases, more than one diagnostic method was used to diagnose EPTB cases. Conclusions Nearly half of TB patients had a recorded diagnosis of EPTB that comprise heterogeneous anatomical sites. All EPTB patients were started anti-TB therapy without definitive microbiology results. This indicates the diagnostic challenge of EPTB faced in our setting and proves to be significant for TB control in Ethiopia."
https://openalex.org/W3112596155,"Phylogenetic analyses can provide a wealth of information about the past demography of a population and the level of genetic diversity within and between species. By using special computer programs developed in recent years, large amounts of data have been produced in the molecular genetics area. To analyze these data, powerful new methods based on large computations have been applied in various software packages and programs. But these programs have their own specific input and output formats, and users need to create different input formats for almost every program. R is an open source software environment, and it supports open contribution and modification to its libraries. Furthermore, it is also possible to perform several analyses using a single input file format. In this article, by using the multiple sequences FASTA format file (.fas extension) we demonstrate and share a workflow of how to extract haplotypes and perform phylogenetic analyses and visualizations in R. As an example dataset, we used 120 Bombus terrestris dalmatinus mitochondrial cytochrome b gene (cyt b ) sequences (373 bp) collected from eight different beehives in Antalya. This article presents a short guide on how to perform phylogenetic analyses using R and RStudio."
https://openalex.org/W3112380051,"Avian Pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC) cause colibacillosis leading to significant economic losses in the poultry industry. This laboratory-based study aimed at establishing stocks of avian pathogenic Escherichia coli lytic bacteriophages, for future development of cocktail products for colibacillosis management. The study determined the antibiotic susceptibility; phylogenetic categories, occurrence of selected serotypes and virulence genes among Escherichia coli stock isolates from chicken colibacillosis cases; and evaluated bacteriophage activity against the bacteria. Escherichia coli characterization was done through phenotypic and multiplex PCR methods. Bacteriophage isolation and preliminary characterization was achieved using the spot assay and overlay plating techniques. Fifty-six (56) isolates were phenotypically confirmed as E . coli and all exhibited resistance to at least one antimicrobial agent; while multi-drug resistance (at least three drugs) was encountered in 50 (89.3%) isolates. The APEC isolates mainly belonged to phylogroups A and D, representing 44.6% and 39.3%, respectively; whereas serotypes O1, O2 and O78 were not detected. Of the 56 isolates, 69.6% harbored at least one virulence gene, while 50% had at least four virulence genes; hence confirmed as APEC. Virulence genes, ompT and iutA were the most frequent in 33 (58.9%) and 32 (57.1%) isolates respectively; while iroN least occurred in 23 (41.1%) isolates. Seven lytic bacteriophages were isolated and their host range, at 1×10 8 PFU/ml, varied from 1.8% to 17.9% of the 56 APEC isolates, while the combined lytic spectrum was 25%. Phage stability was negatively affected by increasing temperatures with both UPEC04 and UPEC10 phages being undetectable at 70°C; whereas activity was detected between pH 2 and 12. The high occurrence of APEC isolates resistant against the commonly used antibiotics supports the need for alternative strategies of bacterial infections control in poultry. The low host range exhibited by the phages necessitates search for more candidates before in-depth phage characterization and application."
https://openalex.org/W3113176317,"Purpose We examined the association between meat intake and mortality due to all-cause and major causes of death using a population-based cohort study in Japan. Methods 87,507 Japanese aged between 45 and 74 years old at 5-year follow-up study were followed for 14.0 years on average. Associations between meat intake and mortality risk were assessed using a Cox proportional hazards model. Results A heavy intake of total meat was associated with a higher risk of all-cause mortality relative to the lowest quartile intake in men (Q4: HR,1.18; 95%CIs, 1.06–1.31). A higher intake of total meat was associated with a lower risk of stroke mortality in women (Q2: HR, 0.70; 95%CIs, 0.51–0.94, Q3: HR, 0.68; 95%CIs, 0.50–0.95, Q4: HR, 0.66; 95%CIs, 0.44–0.99). A heavy intake of red meat was also associated with all-cause mortality (Q4: HR, 1.13; 95%CIs, 1.02–1.26) and heart disease mortality (Q4: HR, 1.51; 95%CIs, 1.11–2.06) in men but not in women. Heavy intake of chicken was inversely associated with cancer mortality in men. Conclusions Heavy intakes of total and red meat were associated with an increase in all-cause and heart disease mortality in men, while total meat intake was associated with a lower risk of stroke mortality in women."
https://openalex.org/W3113321924,"High-frequency oscillations of the frontal cortex are involved in functions of the brain that fuse processed data from different sensory modules or bind them with elements stored in the memory. These oscillations also provide inhibitory connections to neural circuits that perform lower-level processes. Deficit in the performance of these oscillations has been examined as a marker for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Additionally, the neurodegenerative processes associated with AD, such as the deposition of amyloid-beta plaques, do not occur in a spatially homogeneous fashion and progress more prominently in the medial temporal lobe in the early stages of the disease. This region of the brain contains neural circuitry involved in olfactory perception. Several studies have suggested that olfactory deficit can be used as a marker for early diagnosis of AD. A quantitative assessment of the performance of the olfactory system can hence serve as a potential biomarker for Alzheimer’s disease, offering a relatively convenient and inexpensive diagnosis method. This study examines the decline in the perception of olfactory stimuli and the deficit in the performance of high-frequency frontal oscillations in response to olfactory stimulation as markers for AD. Two measurement modalities are employed for assessing the olfactory performance: 1) An interactive smell identification test is used to sample the response to a sizable variety of odorants, and 2) Electroencephalography data are collected in an olfactory perception task with a pair of selected odorants in order to assess the connectivity of frontal cortex regions. Statistical analysis methods are used to assess the significance of selected features extracted from the recorded modalities as Alzheimer’s biomarkers. Olfactory decline regressed to age in both healthy and mild AD groups are evaluated, and single- and multi-modal classifiers are also developed. The novel aspects of this study include: 1) Combining EEG response to olfactory stimulation with behavioral assessment of olfactory perception as a marker of AD, 2) Identification of odorants most significantly affected in mild AD patients, 3) Identification of odorants which are still adequately perceived by mild AD patients, 4) Analysis of the decline in the spatial coherence of different oscillatory bands in response to olfactory stimulation, and 5) Being the first study to quantitatively assess the performance of olfactory decline due to aging and AD in the Iranian population."
https://openalex.org/W3111015411,"Introduction Pressure ulcer is one of the major challenges in hospitals; which endanger patient safety, prolonging hospital stay and contributed to disability and death. Data regarding to pressure ulcer prevention practice are very important to take action. However in Ethiopia, there are limited researches that have been conducted and there is clearly paucity of information on this regard. Hence, this study aimed to assess pressure ulcer prevention practice and associated factors among nurses in public hospitals of Eastern Ethiopia. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among randomly selected 422 nurses who were working in the public hospitals of Eastern Ethiopia. Data were collected from the 1 st February to the 1 st March 2018 using pretested structured self-administered questionnaire and observational checklist. The collected data were entered into EpiData version 3.1 and exported to SPSS version 22.0 for analysis. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression with crude and adjusted odds ratios along with the 95% confidence interval was computed and interpreted accordingly. Pressure ulcer prevention was determined based on mean calculation; a result above the mean value was categorized as good pressure ulcer prevention practice, and a P-value of &lt;0.05 was considered to declare a result as statistically significant. Results In this study 51.9% (95% CI: 47.1%, 56.4%) of nurses were reported that they have good pressure ulcer prevention practice. On observation 45.2% of nurses were practicing proper pressure ulcer prevention activities. Pressure ulcer prevention practice were statistically associated with nurses with bachelor degree and above qualification level (AOR = 1.7, 95% CI: 1.02, 2.83), availability of pressure-relieving devices (AOR = 2.2, 95% CI: 1.34, 3.63), being satisfied with their job (AOR = 1.65, 95% CI: 1.09, 2.52) and good knowledge (AOR = 2.3, 95% CI: 1.48, 3.55). Conclusions In this study the self-reported practice and results from observation was substantially low. Continuing education and training should be considered for nurses to enhance their practice regarding pressure ulcer prevention practice."

High carbohydrate diets, exercise induced dehydration and transient perturbations to immune function combine to increase oral disease risk in this group. We tested whether a single dose of nitrate (NO 3 - ) would offset the reduction in salivary pH following carbohydrate ingestion before and after an exercise bout designed to cause mild dehydration. Eleven trained male runners ( <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" display=""inline"" id=""M1""><mml:mover accent=""true""><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant=""normal"">V</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>˙</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant=""normal"">O</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mi mathvariant=""normal"">max</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math> 53 ± 9 ml∙kg -1 ∙min -1 , age 30 ± 7 years) completed a randomised placebo-controlled study comprising four experimental trials. Participants ingested the following fluids one hour before each trial: (a) 140 ml of water (negative-control), (b) 140 ml of water (positive-control), (c) 140 ml of NO 3 - rich beetroot juice (~12.4 mmol NO 3 - ) (NO 3 - trial) or (d) 140 ml NO 3 - depleted beetroot juice (placebo-trial). During the negative-control trial, participants ingested 795 ml of water in three equal aliquots: before, during, and after 90 min of submaximal running. In the other trials they received 795 ml of carbohydrate supplements in the same fashion. Venous blood was collected before and after the exercise bout and saliva was sampled before and repeatedly over the 20 min following carbohydrate or water ingestion. As expected, nitrite (NO 2 - ) and NO 3 - were higher in plasma and saliva during the NO 3 - trial than all other trials (all P &lt;0.001). Compared to the negative-control, salivary-pH was significantly reduced following the ingestion of carbohydrate in the positive-control and placebo trials (both P &lt;0.05). Salivary-pH was similar between the negative-control and NO 3 - trials before and after exercise despite ingestion of carbohydrate in the NO 3 - trial (both P ≥0.221). Ingesting NO 3 - attenuates the expected reduction in salivary-pH following carbohydrate supplements and exercise-induced dehydration. NO 3 - should be considered by athletes as a novel nutritional strategy to reduce the risk of developing acidity related oral health conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3111212874,"One of the fundamental challenges when dealing with medical imaging datasets is class imbalance. Class imbalance happens where an instance in the class of interest is relatively low, when compared to the rest of the data. This study aims to apply oversampling strategies in an attempt to balance the classes and improve classification performance. We evaluated four different classifiers from k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), support vector machine (SVM), multilayer perceptron (MLP) and decision trees (DT) with 73 oversampling strategies. In this work, we used imbalanced learning oversampling techniques to improve classification in datasets that are distinctively sparser and clustered. This work reports the best oversampling and classifier combinations and concludes that the usage of oversampling methods always outperforms no oversampling strategies hence improving the classification results."
https://openalex.org/W3111250235,"Enhancers are powerful and versatile agents of cell-type specific gene regulation, which are thought to play key roles in human disease. Enhancers are short DNA elements that function primarily as clusters of transcription factor binding sites that are spatially coordinated to regulate expression of one or more specific target genes. These regulatory connections between enhancers and target genes can therefore be characterized as enhancer-gene links that can affect development, disease, and homeostatic cellular processes. Despite their implication in disease and the establishment of cell identity during development, most enhancer-gene links remain unknown. Here we introduce a new, publicly accessible database of predicted enhancer-gene links, PEREGRINE. The PEREGRINE human enhancer-gene links interactive web interface incorporates publicly available experimental data from ChIA-PET, eQTL, and Hi-C assays across 78 cell and tissue types to link 449,627 enhancers to 17,643 protein-coding genes. These enhancer-gene links are made available through the new Enhancer module of the PANTHER database and website where the user may easily access the evidence for each enhancer-gene link, as well as query by target gene and enhancer location."
https://openalex.org/W3112978752,"4-Hexylresorcinol (4HR) is used as a food preservative and an ingredient of toothpaste and cosmetics. The present study was performed using 233 antisera to determine the changes in protein expression induced by 4HR in human umbilical cord vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), and evaluated the 4HR-induced effects in comparison with previous results (Kim et al., 2019). Similar to RAW 264.7 cells, 4HR-treated HUVECs showed decreases in the expression of the proliferation-related proteins, cMyc/MAX/MAD network proteins, p53/RB and Wnt/β-catenin signaling, and they showed inactivation of DNA transcription and protein translation compared to the untreated controls. 4HR upregulated growth factors (TGF-β1, β2, β3, SMAD2/3, SMAD4, HGF-α, Met, IGF-1) and RAS signaling proteins (RAF-B, p38, p-p38, p-ERK-1, and Rab-1), and induced stronger expression of the cellular protection-, survival-, and differentiation-related proteins in HUVECs than in RAW 264.7 cells. 4HR suppressed NFkB signaling in a manner that suggests potential anti-inflammatory and wound healing effects by reducing M1 macrophage polarization and increasing M2 macrophage polarization in both cells. 4HR-treated HUVECs tended to increase the ER stress mediators by upregulating eIF2AK3, ATF4, ATF6, lysozyme, and LC3 and downregulating eIF2α and GADD153 (CHOP), resulting in PARP-1/AIF-mediated apoptosis. These results indicate that 4HR has similar effects on the protein expression of HUVECs and RAW 264.7 cells, but their protein expression levels differ according to cell types. The 4HR-treated cells showed global protein expression characteristic of anticancer and wound healing effects, which could be alleviated simultaneously by other proteins exerting opposite functions. These results suggest that although 4HR has similar effects on the global protein expression of HUVECs and RAW 264.7 cells, the 4HR-induced molecular interferences in those cells are complex enough to produce variable protein expression, leading different cell functions. Moreover, HUVECs have stronger wound healing potential to overcome the impact induced by 4HR than RAW 264.7 cells."
https://openalex.org/W3110910080,"Background Enteric pathogens like Salmonella and Shigella species as well as intestinal parasites (IPs) are among the main causative agents of diarrhea in people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), particularly in low income countries like Ethiopia. Antimicrobial resistance against commonly prescribed drugs has become a major global threat. This study, therefore, aimed at determining the magnitude of Salmonella , Shigella and IPs infections, their predicting factors, and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern among HIV infected and non-infected diarrheic patients in Dessie town, Northeast Ethiopia. Methods A cross sectional study was conducted at three health facilities in Northeast Ethiopia between January 2018 and March 2018. Data on socio-demographic and associated risk factors were collected using structured questionnaire from 354 HIV infected and non-infected diarrheic outpatients. Fresh stool specimen was processed according to standard operating procedures. Data were entered and analyzed using SPSS version 22. Descriptive statistics was used to determine frequency, Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify predicting factors associated with the outcome variable. P-value &lt;0.05 were used to declare statistical significance. Results Among 354 diarrheic patients, 112 were HIV infected and 242 were HIV non-infected. The overall prevalence of intestinal parasite and bacterial infection among HIV infected versus non-infected, respectively, was 26 (23.2%) and 8 (7.1%) versus 50 (20.7) and 16 (6.6%). Salmonella was the highest in both groups, 6 (5.4%) vs 11 (4.5%). Most prevalent parasite was C . parvum , 9 (8%) among HIV+ while E . histolytica/dispar 39 (16.1%) among HIV-. Having bloody plus mucoid diarrhea, not utilizing latrine and drinking river or spring water were factors significantly associated with bacterial infection. Whereas, being illiterate or having primary level education, diarrhea lasting for 6–10 days, CD4 level between 200–500 cells/μl, not washing hand with soap showed significant association with IPs. The bacterial isolates were 100% susceptible to Ceftriaxone and 95.4% to Ciprofloxacin, while 100% resistant to Ampicillin and Amoxicillin. MDR was observed among 19 (79.2%) isolates. Conclusion Preventing and controlling infection by enteric pathogens as well as IPs require strengthening intervention measures. The 100% resistance of isolates to commonly prescribed antibiotics calls for expanding antimicrobial susceptibility testing so as to select appropriate antimicrobial agent and prevent emergence of drug resistant bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W3111236739,"In veterinary practice, a thorough gait examination is essential in the clinical workup of any orthopedic patient, including the large population of dogs with chronic pain as a result of osteoarthritis. The traditional visual gait examination is, however, a subjective discipline, and systems for kinetic gait analysis may potentially offer an objective alternative for gait assessment by the measurement of ground reaction forces. In order to avoid unnecessary testing of patients, a thorough, stepwise evaluation of the diagnostic performance of each system is recommended before clinical use for diagnostic purposes. The aim of the study was to evaluate the Tekscan pressure-sensitive walkway system by assessing precision (agreement between repetitive measurements in individual dogs) and overlap performance (the ability to distinguish dogs with lameness due to osteoarthritis from clinically healthy dogs). Direction of travel over the walkway was investigated as a possible bias. Symmetry indices are commonly used to assess lameness by comparing ground reaction forces across different combinations of limbs in each dog. However, SIs can be calculated in several different ways and specific recommendations for optimal use of individual indices are currently lacking. Therefore the present study also compared indices in order to recommend a specific index preferable for future studies of canine osteoarthritis. Forty-one clinically healthy dogs and 21 dogs with osteoarthritis were included in the study. High precision was demonstrated. The direction of travel over the walkway was excluded as a possible bias. A significant overlap was observed when comparing ground reaction forces measured in dogs with osteoarthritis compared to clinically healthy dogs. In some affected dogs, symmetry indices comparing contralateral limbs differed from clinically healthy dogs, but in general, the overlap performance was insufficient and, consequently, general use of this method for diagnostic purposes in dogs with osteoarthritis cannot be recommended."
https://openalex.org/W3111419319,"Background National birth cohorts derived from administrative health databases constitute unique resources for child health research due to whole country coverage, ongoing follow-up and linkage to other data sources. In England, a national birth cohort can be developed using Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), an administrative database covering details of all publicly funded hospital activity, including 97% of births, with longitudinal follow-up via linkage to hospital and mortality records. We present methods for developing a national birth cohort using HES and assess the impact of changes to data collection over time on coverage and completeness of linked follow-up records for children. Methods We developed a national cohort of singleton live births in 1998–2015, with information on key risk factors at birth (birth weight, gestational age, maternal age, ethnicity, area-level deprivation). We identified three changes to data collection, which could affect linkage of births to follow-up records: (1) the introduction of the “NHS Numbers for Babies (NN4B) ”, an on-line system which enabled maternity staff to request a unique healthcare patient identifier (NHS number) immediately at birth rather than at civil registration, in Q4 2002; (2) the introduction of additional data quality checks at civil registration in Q3 2009; and (3) correcting a postcode extraction error for births by the data provider in Q2 2013. We evaluated the impact of these changes on trends in two outcomes in infancy: hospital readmissions after birth (using interrupted time series analyses) and mortality rates (compared to published national statistics). Results The cohort covered 10,653,998 babies, accounting for 96% of singleton live births in England in 1998–2015. Overall, 2,077,929 infants (19.5%) had at least one hospital readmission after birth. Readmission rates declined by 0.2% percentage points per annual quarter in Q1 1998 to Q3 2002, shifted up by 6.1% percentage points (compared to the expected value based on the trend before Q4 2002) to 17.7% in Q4 2002 when NN4B was introduced, and increased by 0.1% percentage points per annual quarter thereafter. Infant mortality rates were under-reported by 16% for births in 1998–2002 and similar to published national mortality statistics for births in 2003–2015. The trends in infant readmission were not affected by changes to data collection practices in Q3 2009 and Q2 2013, but the proportion of unlinked mortality records in HES and in ONS further declined after 2009. Discussion HES can be used to develop a national birth cohort for child health research with follow-up via linkage to hospital and mortality records for children born from 2003 onwards. Re-linking births before 2003 to their follow-up records would maximise potential benefits of this rich resource, enabling studies of outcomes in adolescents with over 20 years of follow-up."

https://openalex.org/W3111884068,"Background Globally, divorce is a common phenomenon in couples' marital life. As a result, many divorced couples and their children face several social, economic, and health problems after dissolution. There is little information on the magnitude and determinants of divorce in developing countries including Ethiopia. Therefore, this study aimed to estimate the prevalence of divorce from the first union and its predictors among reproductive-age women in Ethiopia. Methods We used the 2016 Ethiopia demographic and health survey data for this analysis. The survey was a community-based cross-sectional study conducted from January 18 to June 27, 2016. The survey employed a two-stage stratified cluster sampling technique. A total of 11,646 ever-married women were included in the analysis. Bivariate and multivariable logistics regression was done to identify the determinants of divorce from the first marriage. A p-value &lt; 0.05 was used to declare statistical significance. Results About 25% (95%CI: 23.4% - 26.6%) ever-married women were divorced from their first marital relationship. Women who were married at age &lt; 15 years (AOR = 1.34; 95%CI: 1.07–1.68), urban women (AOR = 1.69; 95%CI: 1.22–2.35), women who did not attend formal education (AOR = 4.36; 95%CI: 3.14–6.05), women who were employed (AOR = 1.51; 95%CI: 1.31–1.73), and being childless (AOR = 1.34; 95%CI: 1.07–1.69) had higher odds of experiencing a divorce. Similarly, women who experienced partner violence, women with no house ownership, and women in the Amhara region had higher odds of divorce from their first marital union. Conversely, women in Oromia, SNNPR, the metropolis, and the pastoral regions had lower odds of divorce from their first marital union. Conclusion Divorce from the first marriage is high in Ethiopia. Preventing early marriage and partner violence and promoting girls’ education would reduce the divorce rate in Ethiopia."
https://openalex.org/W3112798668,"The association of socio-economic-demographic (SED; e.g., income-related) factors with depression is widely confirmed in the literature. We conducted a hospital-based case–control study of 160 patients with psychiatrist-diagnosed clinical depression. The control group comprised 160 participants recruited from local communities. We used a questionnaire to collect SED data from all participants. We replaced missing values using multiple imputation analyses and further analyzed the pooled data of five imputations. We also recorded the results from the original analysis and each imputation. Univariate analyses showed income was associated with depression. Multiple logistic regression analyses revealed that, among all SED variables, high income (odds ratio = 2.088 [95% confidence interval = 1.178–3.700]; p = 0.012), middle-level (completed junior or senior high school) education (1.688 [1.042–2.734]; p = 0.033) and cohabitating with four or more family members (1.632 [1.025–2.597]; p = 0.039) were significant predictors for the case group. We conclude that cash income is a determinant of depression in hospital outpatients in Indonesia. This study suggests health policy implications toward better hospital access and service for people with depression in middle- or low-income households, and recommends considering high income as correlated with a high risk of depression, owing to socio-cultural changes."
https://openalex.org/W3110792457,"The network approach to psychological phenomena advances our understanding of the interrelations between autism and well-being. We use the Perceived Causal Relations methodology in order to (i) identify perceived causal pathways in the well-being system, (ii) validate networks based on self-report data, and (iii) quantify and integrate clinical expertise in autism research. Trained clinicians served as raters (N = 29) completing 374 cause-effects ratings of 34 variables on well-being and symptomatology. A subgroup (N = 16) of raters chose intervention targets in the resulting network which we found to match the respective centrality of nodes. Clinicians’ perception of causal relations was similar to the interrelatedness found in self-reported client data (N = 323). We present a useful tool for translating clinical expertise into quantitative information enabling future research to integrate this in scientific studies."
https://openalex.org/W3111395394,"Many applications have been developed for electronic data collection. However, offline field navigation tools incorporating secure electronic data capture and field visit tracking are currently scarce. We created an R-Shiny application, HTrack (Household Tracking), for use on encrypted Android devices in the field. The application was implemented in the Communities Organized to Prevent Arboviruses (COPA) project, a study beginning in 2018 to better understand arboviral disease incidence in 38 communities in Puerto Rico. The application was used to navigate to randomly selected structures and capture visit outcomes after conducting multiple visits for participant recruitment. It also served as a bridge to an alternate software, Epi Info, to collect participant-level questionnaire data. This application successfully captured each visit outcome and improved the logistics of field level activities for the COPA project, eliminating the use of paper maps for navigation. We show the development of HTrack and comment on the limitations and strengths of this application and further improvements."
https://openalex.org/W3111494444,"Total reflection X-ray fluorescence analysis (TXRF) was used to determine chromium, selenium and bromine concentrations in blood serum samples of 50 patients with parenteral nutrition treatment. The concentrations were measured two times, namely in the first day (I measurement) of the treatment and the seventh day (II measurement) after the chromium and selenium supplementation. For comparison purposes also serum samples of 50 patients without nutritional disorders, admitted to a planned surgical procedure to remove the gall bladder (cholecystectomy), were analyzed and treated as the control group. Descriptive statistics of measured concentrations of Cr, Se and Br both for the studied and control groups was determined. In order to check the effectiveness of Cr and Se supplementation, the results of the first and seventh day measurements for studied group were statistically compared with each other, with literature reference values and with the results of the control group (two-group comparison). These comparisons indicate the effectiveness of selenium supplementation in the applied treatment procedure. In the case of Cr and Br concentrations no statistically significant differences were observed. We conclude that monitoring of the concentration of the important trace elements in human serum should be standard procedure in parenteral nutrition treatment. In this monitoring the TXRF technique can be successfully used."
https://openalex.org/W3113036663,"Introduction The potential impact of socio-economic condition on virological suppression during antiretroviral treatment (ART) in sub-Saharan Africa is largely unknown. In this case-control study, we compared socio-economic factors among Ethiopian ART recipients with lack of virological suppression to those with undetectable viral load (VL). Methods Cases (VL&gt;1000 copies/ml) and controls (VL&lt;150 copies/ml) aged ≥15years, with ART for &gt;6 months and with available VL results within the last 3 months, were identified from registries at public ART clinics in Central Ethiopia. Questionnaire-based interviews on socio-economic characteristics, health condition and transmission risk behavior were conducted. Univariate variables associated with VL&gt;1000 copies/ml (p&lt;0.25) were added to a multivariable logistic regression model. Results Among 307 participants (155 cases, 152 controls), 61.2% were female, and the median age was 38 years (IQR 32–46). Median HIV-RNA load among cases was 6,904 copies/ml (IQR 2,843–26,789). Compared to controls, cases were younger (median 36 vs. 39 years; p = 0.004), more likely to be male (46.5% vs. 30.9%; p = 0.005) and had lower pre-ART CD4 cell counts (170 vs. 220 cells/μl; p = 0.009). In multivariable analysis of urban residents (94.8%), VL&gt;1000 copies/ml was associated with lower relative wealth (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.98; 95% CI 1.49–5.94; p = 0.016), geographic work mobility (aOR 6.27, 95% CI 1.82–21.6; p = 0.016), younger age (aOR 0.94 [year], 95% CI 0.91–0.98; p = 0.011), longer duration of ART (aOR 1.19 [year], 95% CI 1.07–1.33; p = 0.020), and suboptimal (aOR 3.83, 95% CI 1.33–10.2; p = 0.048) or poor self-perceived wellbeing (aOR 9.75, 95% CI 2.85–33.4; p = 0.012), after correction for multiple comparisons. High-risk sexual behavior and substance use was not associated with lack of virological suppression. Conclusion Geographic work mobility and lower relative wealth were associated with lack of virological suppression among Ethiopian ART recipients in this predominantly urban population. These characteristics indicate increased risk of treatment failure and the need for targeted interventions for persons with these risk factors."
https://openalex.org/W3113074410,"Antifreeze proteins inhibit ice growth and are crucial for the survival of supercooled fish living in icy seawater. Of the four antifreeze protein types found in fishes, the globular type III from eelpouts is the one restricted to a single infraorder (Zoarcales), which is the only clade know to have antifreeze protein-producing species at both poles. Our analysis of over 60 unique antifreeze protein gene sequences from several Zoarcales species indicates this gene family arose around 18 Ma ago, in the Northern Hemisphere, supporting recent data suggesting that the Arctic Seas were ice-laden earlier than originally thought. The Antarctic was subject to widespread glaciation over 30 Ma and the Notothenioid fishes that produce an unrelated antifreeze glycoprotein extensively exploited the adjoining seas. We show that species from one Zoarcales family only encroached on this niche in the last few Ma, entering an environment already dominated by ice-resistant fishes, long after the onset of glaciation. As eelpouts are one of the dominant benthic fish groups of the deep ocean, they likely migrated from the north to Antarctica via the cold depths, losing all but the fully active isoform gene along the way. In contrast, northern species have retained both the fully active (QAE) and partially active (SP) isoforms for at least 15 Ma, which suggests that the combination of isoforms is functionally advantageous."
https://openalex.org/W3113298279,"Objectives In November 2018, JUUL, Inc. restricted sales of mango, fruit medley, crème brûlée, and cucumber pods to its website. Physical/online sales of tobacco, menthol, and mint pods continued. We examined rates of adolescent JUUL device and flavored pod use before and after restrictions were implemented to examine their potential impact. Methods Students from 4 Connecticut high schools completed cross-sectional surveys in 2018 (N = 3170) and 2019 (N = 3074). Results Compared to 2018, current (past-month) JUUL use decreased in 2019 (30.2–25.6%). Among current JUUL users, restricted flavor use (mango [62.8–36.9%]; cucumber [27.7–11.9%]; fruit [23.5–11.4%]; crème brûlée [12.3–5.0%]) and the total number of flavors used (2.09[SD = 1.71]-1.51[SD = 1.33]) decreased (p-values &lt; .001), while mint pod use increased (62.0–68.6%, p &lt; .01). Tobacco and menthol pod use remained stable. Conclusions Following voluntary sales restrictions implemented by JUUL, Inc., restricted flavor use and the total number of flavors used decreased among JUUL users while mint use increased. Results suggest flavor restrictions may impact adolescents’ e-cigarette use. While 2020 Food and Drug Administration restrictions on mint pods may further limit youth JUUL use, research is needed to determine where youth acquire restricted flavors and if restrictions prompt increased popularity of unrestricted devices/e-liquids."
https://openalex.org/W3110767992,"Background Female permanent contraception is a cost-effective contraceptive method that can help clients with the desire to limit childbearing achieve their reproductive intention. However, despite its benefits, the use of FPC remains low in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), and limited studies have examined the correlates of its uptake. In this study, we assessed the individual- and country-level factors associated with the use of FPC among married or in-union women using modern contraceptive methods to limit childbearing in SSA. Methods This study was a secondary data analysis of individual- and country-level data obtained from the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) Program and three open data repositories. The study included 29,777 married or in-union women aged 15–49 years using modern contraceptive methods to limit childbearing from DHS conducted in 33 sub-Sahara African countries between 2010 and 2018. We performed descriptive statistics and fitted multilevel logistic regression models to determine the predisposing, enabling, and need factors associated with the use of FPC. Results Approximately 13% of the women used FPC. About 20% of the variance in the odds of using FPC was attributable to between-country differences. In the full model, the significant individual-level factors associated with the use of FPC compared with other modern contraceptive methods were: age (odds ratio [OR] = 1.10; 95%CI = 1.08–1.12), living children (OR = 1.11, 95%CI = 1.04–1.16), high household wealth (OR = 1.39, 95%CI = 1.18–1.64), rural residence (OR = 0.83, 95% CI = 0.71–0.97), joint contraceptive decision with partner (OR = 1.68, 95% = 1.43–1.99), contraceptive decision by partner and others (OR = 2.46, 95% = 1.97–3.07), and the number of living children less than the ideal number of children (OR = 1.40, 95%CI = 1.21–1.62). The significantly associated country-level factors were births attended by skilled health providers (OR = 1.03, 95%CI = 1.00–1.05) and density of medical doctors (OR = 1.37, 95%CI = 1.01–1.85). Conclusions Our results suggest that both individual- and country-level factors affect uptake of FPC in SSA. Increasing geographic, economic, and psychosocial access to FPC may improve its uptake in SSA."
https://openalex.org/W3110784232,"Activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) by the environmental toxin dioxin (2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo- p -dioxin, TCDD) causes diverse toxicities, including thymus atrophy and hepatosteatosis. The mechanisms by which AHR activation by TCDD leads to these toxicities are not fully understood. Here we studied the effects of TCDD on a major energy pathway, glycolysis, using the chick embryo close to hatching, a well-established model for studying dioxin toxicity. We showed that 24 hr of TCDD treatment causes changes in glycolysis in both thymus and liver. In thymus glands, TCDD decreased mRNAs for glycolytic genes and glucose transporters, glycolytic indices and levels of IL7 mRNA, phosphorylated AKT (pAKT) and HIF1A, stimulators of glycolysis and promoters of survival and proliferation of thymic lymphocytes. In contrast, in liver, TCDD increased mRNA levels for glycolytic genes and glucose transporters, glycolytic endpoints and pAKT levels. Similarly, increases by TCDD in mRNA levels for glycolytic genes and glucose transporters in human primary hepatocytes showed that effects in chick embryo liver pertain also to human cells. Treatment with the glycolytic inhibitor 2-deoxy-d-glucose exacerbated the effects on thymus atrophy by TCDD, supporting a role for decreased glycolysis in thymus atrophy by TCDD, but did not prevent hepatosteatosis. NAD + precursors abolished TCDD effects on glycolytic endpoints in both thymus and liver. In summary, we report here that dioxin disrupts glycolysis mediated energy metabolism in both thymus and liver, and that it does so in opposite ways, decreasing it in the thymus and increasing it in the liver. Further, the findings support NAD + boosting as a strategy against metabolic effects of environmental pollutants such as dioxins."
https://openalex.org/W3111168408,"Introduction Sensory and motor nerve deficits are prevalent in older adults and are associated with loss of functional independence. We hypothesize that chronic kidney disease predisposes to worsening sensorimotor nerve function over time. Materials and methods Participants were from the Health, Aging and Body Composition Study (N = 1121) with longitudinal data between 2000–01 (initial visit) and 2007–08 (follow-up visit). Only participants with non-impaired nerve function at the initial visit were included. The predictor was presence of CKD (estimated GFR ≤ 60 ml/min/1.73m 2 ) from the 1999–2000 visit. Peripheral nerve function outcomes at 7-year follow-up were 1) Motor: “new” impairments in motor parameters (nerve conduction velocity NCV &lt; 40 m/s or peroneal compound motor action potential &lt; 1 mv) at follow-up, and 2) Sensory: “new” impairment defined as insensitivity to standard 10-g monofilament or light 1.4-g monofilament at the great toe and “worsening” as a change from light to standard touch insensitivity over time. The association between CKD and “new” or “worsening” peripheral nerve impairment was studied using logistic regression. Results The study population was 45.9% male, 34.3% Black and median age 75 y. CKD participants (15.6%) were older, more hypertensive, higher in BMI and had 2.37 (95% CI 1.30–4.34) fold higher adjusted odds of developing new motor nerve impairments in NCV. CKD was associated with a 2.02 (95% CI 1.01–4.03) fold higher odds of worsening monofilament insensitivity. CKD was not associated with development of new monofilament insensitivity. Conclusions Pre-existing CKD leads to new and worsening sensorimotor nerve impairments over a 7-year time period in community-dwelling older adults."
https://openalex.org/W3111106648,"The aim of this study was to investigate the potential interference of cyanobacterial metabolites, in particular microcystins (MCs), with steroid hormone biosynthesis. Steroid hormones control many fundamental processes in an organism, thus alteration of their tissue concentrations may affect normal homeostasis. We used liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) to investigate the modulation of 14 hormones involved in the adrenal steroid biosynthesis pathway using forskolin-treated H295R cells, following exposure with either microcystin-LR (MC-LR) alone, a mixture made up of MC-LR together with eight other MCs and nodularin-R (NOD-R), or extracts from the MC-LR-producing Microcystis aeruginosa PCC7806 strain or its MC-deficient mutant PCC7806 mcyB− . Production of 17-hydroxypregnenolone and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) was increased in the presence of MC-LR in a dose-dependent manner, indicating an inhibitory effect on 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3β-HSD). This effect was not observed following exposure with a MCs/NOD-R mixture, and thus the effect of MC-LR on 3β-HSD appears to be stronger than for other congeners. Exposure to extracts from both M . aeruginosa PCC7806 and M . aeruginosa PCC7806 mcyB− had an opposite effect on 3β-HSD, i.e. concentrations of pregnenolone, 17-hydroxypregnenolone and DHEA were significantly decreased, showing that there are other cyanobacterial metabolites that outcompete the effect of MC-LR, and possibly result instead in net-induction. Another finding was a possible concentration-dependent inhibition of CYP21A2 or CYP11β1, which catalyse oxidation reactions leading to cortisol and cortisone, by MC-LR and the MCs/NOD-R mixture. However, both M . aeruginosa PCC7806 and M . aeruginosa PCC7806 mcyB− extracts had an opposite effect resulting in a substantial increase in cortisol levels. Our results suggest that MCs can modulate steroidogenesis, but the net effect of the M . aeruginosa metabolome on steroidogenesis is different from that of pure MC-LR and independent of MC production."
https://openalex.org/W3111476079,"Background Mass drug administration has implemented to reduce trachoma since 2001, however, trachoma is still the major public health problem in Amhara Region, Ethiopia. However, credible evidence on the prevalence of trachoma and its associated factors after the implementation of mass drug administration is limited. Objective To assess the prevalence and associated factors of active trachoma among children aged 1–9 years old in mass drug administration graduated and non-graduated districts in the Northwest Amhara Region. Methods A comparative cross-sectional study was conducted from October to November, 2019. A stratified multistage random sampling was used to select 690 households having children aged 1–9 years. Data were collected using a pretested structured questionnaire. Data were entered into Epi-data version 3.1 and exported to SPSS version 20.0 for analysis. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regressions were employed to identify factors associated with active trachoma. Crude and adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence interval were computed to assess the degree of association between the independent variables and active trachoma. Results The overall prevalence of active trachoma was 8.3% (95% CI: 6.2% –10.5%) and showed a significant variation between graduated [3.5% (95% CI: 1.8% –5.6%)] and non-graduated [13% (95% CI: 9.7%–16.8%)] districts. Living in graduated districts (AOR = 7.39, 95% CI: 3.19, 17.09), fly presence in the house (AOR = 3.14, 95% CI: 1.43, 6.89), presence of more than two children in the family (AOR = 3.78, 95%CI: 1.79, 7.98), did not wash face daily (AOR = 6.31, 95% CI: 1.81, 21.98), did not use soap during face washing (AOR = 3.34, 95% CI: 1.37, 8.15), presence of sleep in eyes (AOR = 3.16, 95% CI: 1.42, 7.02) and presence of dirt on child face (AOR = 2.44, 95% CI: 1.08, 5.50) increased the odds of having active trachoma. Conclusion The prevalence of active trachoma was high in the study area and showed a significant variation between graduated and non-graduated districts with mass drug administration. Living in non-graduated districts, fly presence in the house, more than two children in a household, did not wash the face daily, did not use soap during face washing, presence of sleep in eyes, and dirt on the child’s face were the significant predictors of active trachoma. Therefore, the identified modifiable factors are the area of intervention to reduce the burden of active trachoma."
https://openalex.org/W3111762078,"Here, we report a rapid and ultra-sensitive detection technique for fluorescent molecules called scanning single molecular counting (SSMC). The method uses a fluorescence-based digital measurement system to count single molecules in a solution. In this technique, noise is reduced by conforming the signal shape to the intensity distribution of the excitation light via a circular scan of the confocal region. This simple technique allows the fluorescent molecules to freely diffuse into the solution through the confocal region and be counted one by one and does not require statistical analysis. Using this technique, 28 to 62 aM fluorescent dye was detected through measurement for 600 s. Furthermore, we achieved a good signal-to-noise ratio (S/N = 2326) under the condition of 100 pM target nucleic acid by only mixing a hybridization-sensitive fluorescent probe, called Eprobe, into the target oligonucleotide solution. Combination of SSMC and Eprobe provides a simple, rapid, amplification-free, and high-sensitive target nucleic acid detection system. This method is promising for future applications to detect particularly difficult to design primers for amplification as miRNAs and other short oligo nucleotide biomarkers by only hybridization with high sensitivity."

https://openalex.org/W3113191423,"How interactions among multiple predators affect the stability of trophic cascades is a topic of special ecological interest. To examine factors affecting the stability of the classic tri-trophic oyster reef cascade within a different context, configurations of three predators, including the Gulf toadfish, Gulf stone crab, and oystershell mud crab, were manipulated together with either oyster shell or limestone gravel substrate within a multiple predator effects (MPE) experiment. Additionally, a complimentary set of trait-mediated-indirect interaction (TMII) experiments examined the inhibition of oyster consumption relative to mud-crab size and top predator identity in the absence of other cues and factors. The classic tri-trophic cascade formed by the toadfish-mud crab-oyster configuration was potentially weakened by several interactions within the MPE experiment. Consumption of oysters and mud crabs by the intraguild stone crab was undeterred by the presence of toadfish. Although mud crab feeding was inhibited in the presence of both toadfish and stone crabs, estimated non-consumptive effects (NCEs) were weaker for stone crabs in the MPE experiment. Consequently, the total effect was destabilizing when all three predator species were together. Inhibition of mud crab feeding was inversely related to direct predation on mud crabs within the MPE experiment. Complimentary TMII experiments revealed greater inhibition of mud crab feeding in response to stone crabs under sparse conditions. TMII experiments also implied that inhibition of mud crab feeding could have largely accounted for NCEs relative to oysters within the MPE experiment, as opposed to interference by other mud crabs or top predators. An inverse relationship between mud crab size and NCE strength in the TMII experiment disclosed another potentially destabilizing influence on the tri-trophic-cascade. Finally, although habitat complexity generally dampened the consumption of oysters across MPE treatments, complex habitat promoted mud crab feeding in the presence of toadfish alone. This study underscores how ecological interactions can mediate trophic cascades and provides some additional insights into the trophic dynamics of oyster reefs for further testing under natural conditions."

https://openalex.org/W3111195036,"Dipterocarpus alatus belongs to Family Dipterocarpaceae that can be commonly found in Southeast Asian countries. It is a perennial plant with oval-shaped leaves and oleoresin-rich wood. It has been considered as a multipurpose plant since all parts can be practically utilized. One of the major problems for utilizing Dipterocarpus alatus is the difficulty knowing the exact age as this kind of plant is ready for multipurpose use after 20 years of age. At present, the most commonly used method for determining age of Dipterocarpus alatus is the annual ring estimation. However, this conventional method is unable to provide the high precision and accuracy of age determination due to its limitation including blurry annual rings caused by enriched oleoresin in the wood. The current study aimed to investigate the differences of 1 H -NMR spectroscopy-based metabolic profiles from bark and leaf of Dipterocarpus alatus at different ages including 2, 7, 15 and 25 years. Our findings demonstrated that there is a total of 56 metabolites shared between bark and leaf. It is noticeable that bark at different ages exhibited the strongest variation and sugar or sugar derivatives that were found in higher concentrations in bark compared with those in leaf. We found that decreasing levels of certain metabolites including tagatose, 1’kestose and 2’-fucosyllactose exhibited the promising patterns. In conclusion, panel metabolites involved in the sucrose biosynthesis can precisely determine the age and growth of Dipterocarpus alatus ."
https://openalex.org/W3111257648,"Under the backdrop of China’s aging population and continuous rising housing price and base on theories pertaining to social status seeking, marriage matching and intergenerational family relationships, use the 2010 and 2014 CFPS national survey micro data, we examine the impact of rising housing price on the health of middle-aged and elderly people and the underlying mechanisms. Rising housing price has a significant negative impact on the health of middle-aged and elderly people, and this effect is also reflected in their physical health, mental acuity and emotional well-being. The internal mechanism is that social status seeking motivation plays a significant mediator role. Through further analysis, we find that competitive saving motive is another intermediate mechanism that causes rising housing price to affect the health of middle-aged and elderly people; it is complementary to the social status seeking motivation. What’s more, the mediation effect of the competitive saving motive is notably heterogeneous, as it exists only for middle-aged and elderly people with male or noncollege educated child but does not exist for those with female or college educated child."
https://openalex.org/W3111382707,"Objectives To examine the mediating effect of general self-efficacy on the relationship between the source of meaning in life (SML) and prosocial behaviours in vocational college nursing students. Methods Between March and June 2019, a cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted, and 799 nursing students from three vocational colleges completed the Source of Meaning in Life Scale, General Self-Efficacy Scale and Prosocial Behaviours Scale. Data were analyzed using structural equation modelling and statistical analysis by SPSS (version 23.0, IBM). Results The average SML, general self-efficacy and prosocial behaviours scores of the 799 nursing students were 6.43±0.83, 2.48±0.59 and 3.69±0.62, respectively. Correlation analysis showed that SML, general self-efficacy and prosocial behaviours were positively correlated (P&lt;0.01). General self-efficacy partially mediated the relationship between SML and prosocial behaviours (P&lt;0.01); this mediating effect contributed 22.97% of the total effect and explained 17.6% of the variance in the dependent variable. Conclusions Educators should focus on cultivating nursing students’ cognition and experience of meaning in life and their efficacy in life, study and work, which can improve students’ “people-oriented” service and prosocial behaviour and the quality of nursing services."

This study aimed to determine the electromyographic activity of the masseter and temporalis muscles during mandibular tasks and habitual and non-habitual chewing in indigenous individuals to reveal the differences among white Brazilian individuals. Sixty Brazilians (18 and 28 years) were divided into two groups: 30 Xingu indigenous individuals and 30 white Brazilian individuals, with 20 men and 10 women in each group. The individuals were assessed using the normalized electromyographic activity of mandibular tasks (rest, protrusion, right and left laterality) and electromyographic activity of masticatory cycles in habitual (peanuts and raisins) and non-habitual (Parafilm M) chewing. Data were analyzed using Student’s t-test (p &lt; .05). Comparisons between the groups demonstrated significant differences. Indigenous individuals group presented a decrease in the normalized electromyographic activity of the masticatory muscles during mandibular rest [right masseter (p = .002) and left masseter (p = .004) muscles]. There was increase in the normalized electromyographic activity during protrusion [left temporal (p = .03) muscle]. There was increase in the electromyographic activity during chewing: peanuts [right masseter (p = .001), left masseter (p = .001) and right temporal (p = .01) muscles], raisins [right masseter (p = .001), left masseter (p = .002), right temporal (p = .008), left temporal (p = .01) muscles] and Parafilm M [left masseter muscle (p = .05)]. From the findings of this study, we concluded that in the comparison between indigenous and white individuals, positive changes were observed in the electromyographic pattern of the masticatory muscles in the mandibular postural conditions, with greater masticatory efficiency in the indigenous group."

Since B cells exert roles as effector and as regulator of immune responses in different clinical settings, we were interested in generating B cells from hIPSC. We differentiated human embryonic stem cells (hESC) and hIPSC into B cells onto OP9 and MS-5 stromal cells successively. We overcame issues in generating CD34 + CD43 + hematopoietic progenitors with appropriate cytokine conditions and emphasized the difficulties to generate proper hematopoietic progenitors. We highlight CD31 int CD45 int phenotype as a possible marker of hematopoietic progenitors suitable for B cell differentiation. Defining precisely proper lymphoid progenitors will improve the study of their lineage commitment and the signals needed during the in vitro process."
https://openalex.org/W3111016928,"The Multidimensional Poverty Index is used increasingly to measure poverty in developing countries. The index is constructed using selected indicators that cover health, education, and living standards dimensions. The accuracy of this tool, however, depends on how each indicator is measured. This study explores the effect of accounting for water quality in multidimensional poverty measurement. Access to drinking water is traditionally measured by water source types. The study uses a more comprehensive measure, access to safely managed drinking water services, which are free from E . coli contamination, available when needed and accessible on premises in line with Sustainable Development Goal target 6.1. The study finds that the new measure increases national multidimensional headcount poverty by 5–13 percentage points, which would mean that 5–13 million more people are multidimensionally poor. It also increases the poverty level in urban areas to a greater extent than in rural areas. The finding is robust to changes in water contamination risk levels and Multidimensional Poverty Index aggregation approaches and weighting structures."
https://openalex.org/W3111677383,"Background Legal performance-enhancing substances (PES), such as creatine, are commonly used by adolescents and young adults. As PES are mostly unregulated by the US Food and Drug Administration, there has been limited empirical attention devoted to examining their long-term safety and health outcomes. Preliminary studies have demonstrated associations between PES use and severe medical events, including hospitalizations and death. PES could be linked to cardiovascular disease (CVD), the most common cause of mortality in the US, by altering the myocardium, vasculature, or metabolism. The objective of this study was to examine prospective associations between the use of legal PES in young adulthood and CVD risk factors at seven-year follow-up. Materials and methods Nationally representative longitudinal cohort data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health, Waves III (2001–2002) and IV (2008), were analyzed. Regression models determined the prospective association between the use of legal PES (e.g. creatine monohydrate) and CVD risk factors (e.g. body mass index, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia), adjusting for relevant covariates. Results Among the diverse sample of 11,996 male and female participants, no significant differences by PES use in body mass index, diabetes, hypertension, or hyperlipidemia were noted at Wave III. In unadjusted comparisons, legal PES users (versus non-users) were more likely to be White, be male, be college educated, drink alcohol, and engage in weightlifting, exercise, individual sports, team sports, and other strength training. There were no significant prospective associations between legal PES use at Wave III and body mass index, hemoglobin A1c, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and cholesterol (total, HDL, LDL, triglycerides) deciles at seven-year follow-up (Wave IV), adjusting for demographics, health behaviors, and Wave III CVD risk factors. Similarly, there were no significant prospective associations between legal PES use and diabetes, hypertension, or hyperlipidemia based on objective measures or self-reported medications and diagnoses, adjusting for demographics, health behaviors, and Wave III CVD risk. Conclusions We do not find evidence for a prospective association between legal PES use and CVD risk factors in young adults over seven years of follow-up, including BMI, diabetes, hypertension, or hyperlipidemia. It should be noted that legal PES use was operationalized dichotomously and as one broad category, which did not account for frequency, amount, or duration of use. Given the lack of regulation and clinical trials data, observational studies can provide much needed data to inform the safety and long-term health associations of legal PES use and, in turn, inform clinical guidance and policy."
https://openalex.org/W3113000691,"The Multi-Transmitting Formula (MTF) proposed by Liao et al. is a local artificial boundary condition widely used in numerical simulations of wave propagation in an infinite medium, while the drift instability is usually caused in its numerical implementation. In view of a physical interpretation of the Gustafsson, Kreiss and Sundström criterion on numerical solutions of initial-boundary value problems in the hyperbolic partial differential equations, the mechanism of the drift instability of MTF was discussed, and a simple measure for eliminating the drift instability was proposed by introducing a modified operator into the MTF. Based on the theory of spherical wave propagation and damping effect of medium, the physical implication on modified operator was interpreted. And the effect of the modified operator on the reflection coefficient of MTF was discussed. Finally, the validity of the proposed stable implementation measure was verified by numerical tests of wave source problem and scattering problem."
https://openalex.org/W3111655605,"Survival rates for pediatric acute leukemia vary dramatically worldwide. Infections are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, and the impact is amplified in low and middle-income countries. Defining the epidemiology of infection in a specific health care setting is paramount to developing effective interventions. This study aimed to define the epidemiology of and outcomes from infection in children with acute leukemia treated in a large public pediatric hospital in the Dominican Republic. A retrospective cohort was assembled of children newly diagnosed with acute leukemia between July 1, 2015 to June 30, 2017 at Hospital Infantil Dr. Robert Reid Cabral in Santo Domingo. Patients were identified from the Pediatric Oncology Network Database (POND TM ) and hospital admissions from the Oncology admissions logbook. Medical records and microbiology results were reviewed to identify all inpatient invasive infections. Distance from a child’s home to the hospital was determined using ArcGIS by Esri. Infection rates were described in discrete time periods after diagnosis and risk factors for invasive infection were explored using negative binomial regression. Overall, invasive infections were common and a prominent source of death in this cohort. Rates were highest in the first 60 days after diagnosis. Gastroenteritis/colitis, cellulitis, and pneumonia were most frequent, with bacteremia common early on. Multidrug resistant bacteria were prevalent among a small number of positive cultures. In a multivariate negative binomial regression model, age ≥ 10 years and distance from the hospital &gt; 100 km were each protective against invasive infection in the first 180 days after diagnosis, findings that were unexpected and warrant further investigation. Over one-third of patient deaths were related to infection. Interventions aimed at reducing infection should target the first 60 days after diagnosis, improved supportive care inside and outside the hospital, and increased antimicrobial stewardship and infection prevention and control measures."
https://openalex.org/W3112538656,"Social distancing is an important measure in controlling epidemics. This paper presents a simple theoretical model focussed on the implications of the wide range in interaction rates between individuals, both within the workplace and in social settings. The model is based on well-mixed populations and so is not intended for studying geographic spread. The model shows that epidemic growth rate is largely determined by the upper interactivity quantiles of society, implying that the most efficient methods of epidemic control are interaction capping approaches rather than overall reductions in interaction. The theoretical model can also be applied to look at aspects of the dynamics of epidemic progression under various scenarios. The theoretical model suggests that with no intervention herd immunity would be achieved with a lower overall infection rate than if variation in interaction rate is ignored, because by this stage almost all the most interactive members of society would have had the infection; however the overall mortality with such an approach is very high. Scenarios for mitigation and suppression suggest that, by using interactivity capping, it should be possible to control an epidemic without extreme sanctions on the majority of the population if R 0 of the uncontrolled infection is 2.4. However to control the infection rate to a specific level will always require measures to be switched on and off and for this reason elimination is likely to be a less costly policy in the long run. While social distancing alone can be used for elimination, it would not on its own be an efficient mechanism to prevent reinfection. The use of robust testing, quarantining, and contact tracing would strengthen any social distancing measures, speed up elimination, and be a better tool for the prevention of infection or reinfection. Because the analysis presented here is theoretical, and not data-driven, it is intended to be a stimulus for further data-collection, particularly on individual interactivity levels, and for more comprehensive modelling which takes account of the type of heterogeneity discussed here. While there are some clear lessons from the simple model presented here, policy makers should have these tested and validated by epidemiological specialists before acting on them."
https://openalex.org/W3113191768,"Background Soil-transmitted helminths (STH), i.e., Ascaris lumbricoides , Trichuris trichiura and hookworms are among the most prevalent Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) in Ethiopia. Although pre-school aged children pay a high morbidity toll associated with STH infections, evidence on prevalence, intensity and intervention status is lacking in Ethiopia. This study, therefore, aimed to address these gaps to inform decision made on STH. Methods We did a community-based cross-sectional study in five districts of Gamo Gofa zone, Southern Ethiopia; in January 2019. Data were collected using pre-tested questionnaire, and the Kato-Katz technique was used to diagnose parasites eggs in stool. Then, collected data were edited and entered into EpiData 4.4.2, and exported to SPSS software (IBM, version 25) for analysis. Results A total of 2462 PSAC participated in this study. Overall, the prevalence of STH was 23.5% (578/2462) (95% confidence interval (CI) = 21.8%–25.2%). As caris lumbricoides was the most prevalent (18.6%), followed by Trichuris trichiura (9.2%), and hookworms (3.1%). Of the total, 7.4% PSAC were infected with two STH species. Most of the positive cases with STH showed low infection intensities, while 15.1% ascariasis cases showed moderate infection intensities. The study found that 68.7% of PSAC were treated with albendazole. Also, household’s level data showed that 39.4% used water from hand-dug well; 52.5% need to travel ≥30 minutes to collect water; 77.5% did not treat water, and 48.9% had no hand washing facility. In addition, almost 93% care givers achieved less than the mean knowledge and practice score (≤5) on STH prevention. Conclusions This study showed that significant proportions of pre-school aged children are suffering from STH infections despite preventive chemotherapy exist at the study area. Also, gaps in the interventions against STH were highlighted. Thus, a call for action is demanding to eliminate STH among PSAC in Ethiopia by 2030."
https://openalex.org/W3111478423,"The choice of a group decision-making rule is one of the most important political issues. Buchanan and Tullock have provided a framework for analyzing the optimal k-majority rule from the perspective of “methodological individualism.” They proposed the concept of “external costs” and “decision costs” and argued that the optimal k-majority rule takes place where the sum of these two costs–“total costs”–is minimized. Despite the fact that the approach is widely accepted as a tool for dealing with public decision-making rules, the study of formalizing these two costs in a quantitative manner has been relatively rare. We propose a systematic way of modeling these costs considering the assumptions mentioned by Buchanan and Tullock. We find that the resulting shape of the graphs is generally similar to that of the Buchanan-Tullock model, except for some minor details. Then, using this analytical model, we investigate several factors that could affect Buchanan-Tullock’s two costs and the optimal k-majority rule. We show that “clustering of disadvantages” (social factor) and “loss aversion” (personal factor) could increase external costs in Buchanan-Tullock’s model. These factors can result in a separation between the theoretical and actual optimal k-majority rules. Meanwhile, some recent developments in information and communication technologies can not only decrease decision costs, but also increase the same costs simultaneously through amplified “group polarization” (technological factor). If the effect of the former is not the same as that of the latter, this leads to a difference in optimal k-majority rules as well. These discrepancies bring us to the dilemma of “public choice before public choice.”"
