https://openalex.org/W2086018751,"Human saliva is clinically informative of both oral and general health. Since next generation shotgun sequencing (NGS) is now widely used to identify and quantify bacteria, we investigated the bacterial flora of saliva microbiomes of two healthy volunteers and five datasets from the Human Microbiome Project, along with a control dataset containing short NGS reads from bacterial species representative of the bacterial flora of human saliva. GENIUS, a system designed to identify and quantify bacterial species using unassembled short NGS reads was used to identify the bacterial species comprising the microbiomes of the saliva samples and datasets. Results, achieved within minutes and at greater than 90% accuracy, showed more than 175 bacterial species comprised the bacterial flora of human saliva, including bacteria known to be commensal human flora but also Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Gamma proteobacteria. Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLASTn) analysis in parallel, reported ca. five times more species than those actually comprising the in silico sample. Both GENIUSand BLAST analyses of saliva samples identified major genera comprising the bacterial flora of saliva, but GENIUS provided a more precise description of species composition, identifying to strain in most cases and delivered results at least 10,000 times faster. Therefore, GENIUS offers a facile and accurate system for identification and quantification of bacterial species and/or strains in metagenomic samples."
https://openalex.org/W2116498086,"Protein-RNA interactions are central to essential cellular processes such as protein synthesis and regulation of gene expression and play roles in human infectious and genetic diseases. Reliable identification of protein-RNA interfaces is critical for understanding the structural bases and functional implications of such interactions and for developing effective approaches to rational drug design. Sequence-based computational methods offer a viable, cost-effective way to identify putative RNA-binding residues in RNA-binding proteins. Here we report two novel approaches: (i) HomPRIP, a sequence homology-based method for predicting RNA-binding sites in proteins; (ii) RNABindRPlus, a new method that combines predictions from HomPRIP with those from an optimized Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier trained on a benchmark dataset of 198 RNA-binding proteins. Although highly reliable, HomPRIP cannot make predictions for the unaligned parts of query proteins and its coverage is limited by the availability of close sequence homologs of the query protein with experimentally determined RNA-binding sites. RNABindRPlus overcomes these limitations. We compared the performance of HomPRIP and RNABindRPlus with that of several state-of-the-art predictors on two test sets, RB44 and RB111. On a subset of proteins for which homologs with experimentally determined interfaces could be reliably identified, HomPRIP outperformed all other methods achieving an MCC of 0.63 on RB44 and 0.83 on RB111. RNABindRPlus was able to predict RNA-binding residues of all proteins in both test sets, achieving an MCC of 0.55 and 0.37, respectively, and outperforming all other methods, including those that make use of structure-derived features of proteins. More importantly, RNABindRPlus outperforms all other methods for any choice of tradeoff between precision and recall. An important advantage of both HomPRIP and RNABindRPlus is that they rely on readily available sequence and sequence-derived features of RNA-binding proteins. A webserver implementation of both methods is freely available at http://einstein.cs.iastate.edu/RNABindRPlus/."
https://openalex.org/W2023730778,"Cassava (Manihot esculenta) is a major food staple in sub-Saharan Africa, which is severely affected by cassava brown streak disease (CBSD). The aim of this study was to identify resistance for CBSD as well as to understand the mechanism of putative resistance for providing effective control for the disease. Three cassava varieties; Kaleso, Kiroba and Albert were inoculated with cassava brown streak viruses by grafting and also using the natural insect vector the whitefly, Bemisia tabaci. Kaleso expressed mild or no disease symptoms and supported low concentrations of viruses, which is a characteristic of resistant plants. In comparison, Kiroba expressed severe leaf but milder root symptoms, while Albert was susceptible with severe symptoms both on leaves and roots. Real-time PCR was used to estimate virus concentrations in cassava varieties. Virus quantities were higher in Kiroba and Albert compared to Kaleso. The Illumina RNA-sequencing was used to further understand the genetic basis of resistance. More than 700 genes were uniquely overexpressed in Kaleso in response to virus infection compared to Albert. Surprisingly, none of them were similar to known resistant gene orthologs. Some of the overexpressed genes, however, belonged to the hormone signalling pathways and secondary metabolites, both of which are linked to plant resistance. These genes should be further characterised before confirming their role in resistance to CBSD."
https://openalex.org/W2028115391,"Here we show that expression of the cytosolic branched chain aminotransferase (BCATc) is triggered by the T cell receptor (TCR) of CD4(+) T cells. Induction of BCATc correlates with increased Leu transamination, whereas T cells from the BCATc(-/-) mouse exhibit lower Leu transamination and higher intracellular Leu concentrations than the cells from wild type (WT) mice. Induction of BCATc by TCR in WT cells is prevented by the calcineurin-nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) inhibitor, cyclosporin A (CsA), suggesting that NFAT controls BCATc expression. Leu is a known activator of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). mTOR is emerging as a critical regulator of T cell activation, differentiation, and metabolism. Activated T cells from BCATc(-/-) mice show increased phosphorylation of mTORC1 downstream targets, S6 and 4EBP-1, indicating higher mTORC1 activation than in T cells from WT mice. Furthermore, T cells from BCATc(-/-) mice display higher rates of glycolysis, glycolytic capacity, and glycolytic reserve when compared with activated WT cells. These findings reveal BCATc as a novel regulator of T cell activation and metabolism and highlight the important role of Leu metabolism in T cells."
https://openalex.org/W2028222722,"ATP is an abundant biochemical component of the tumor microenvironment and a physiologic ligand for the P2Y2 nucleotide receptor (P2Y2R). In this study, we investigated the effect of ATP on the cellular behavior of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells and the role of P2Y2R in ATP action and aimed to find a new therapeutic target against HCC. The experiments were performed in native isolated human HCC cells, normal hepatocytes, human HCC cell lines, and nude mice. We found that the mRNA and protein expression levels of P2Y2R in native human HCC cells and the human HCC cell lines HepG2 and BEL-7404 were enhanced markedly compared with human normal hepatocytes and the normal hepatocyte line LO2, respectively. ATP induced intracellular Ca(2+) increases in HCC cells and promoted the proliferation and migration of HCC cells and the growth of HCC in nude mice. The P2Y receptor antagonist suramin, P2Y2R-specific shRNA, the store-operated calcium channel inhibitors 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB) and 1-(Î²-3-(4-methoxy-phenyl) propoxyl-4-methoxyphenethyl)1H-imidazole-hydrochloride (SKF96365), and stromal interaction molecule (STIM1)-specific shRNA inhibited the action of ATP on HCC cells. In conclusion, P2Y2R mediated the action of ATP on the cellular behavior of HCC cells through store-operated calcium channel-mediated Ca(2+) signaling, and targeting P2Y2R may be a promising therapeutic strategy against human HCC."
https://openalex.org/W1992479087,"Multiple comprehensive in situ bio-optical investigations were conducted from 2005 to 2010 and covered a large variability of total suspended matter (TSM) in Lake Taihu to calibrate and validate a TSM concentration estimation model based on Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) data. The estimation model of the TSM concentration in Lake Taihu was developed using top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiance of MERIS image data at band 9 in combination with a regional empirical atmospheric correction model, which was strongly correlated with the in situ TSM concentration (r(2) = 0.720, p<0.001, and n = 73). The relative root mean square error (RRMSE) and mean relative error (MRE) were 36.9% and 31.6%, respectively, based on an independent validation dataset that produced reliable estimations of the TSM concentration. The developed algorithm was applied to 50 MERIS images from 2003 to 2011 to obtain a high spatial and temporal heterogeneity of TSM concentrations in Lake Taihu. Seasonally, the highest and lowest TSM concentrations were found in spring and autumn, respectively. Spatially, TSM concentrations were high in the southern part and center of the lake and low in Xukou Bay, East Lake Taihu. The lake topography, including the water depth and distance from the shore, had a significant effect on the TSM spatial distribution. A significant correlation was found between the daily average wind speed and TSM concentration (r(2)= 0.685, p<0.001, and n = 50), suggesting a critical role of wind speed in the TSM variations in Lake Taihu. In addition, a low TSM concentration was linked to the appearance of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV). Therefore, TSM dynamics were controlled by the lake topography, wind-driven sediment resuspension and SAV distribution."
https://openalex.org/W1970102981,"The neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), which causes transcriptional changes associated with oxidative and proteotoxic stress, has been widely used to generate an experimental model of Parkinson's disease. The food-derived compound luteolin has multi-target actions including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and neurotrophic activities. The aim of this study is to investigate how luteolin affects 6-OHDA-mediated stress response pathways. The results showed that when PC12 cells were pre-treated with luteolin (20 ÂµM) 30 min prior to 6-OHDA (100 ÂµM) exposure, 6-OHDA-induced ROS overproduction, cytotoxicity, caspase-3 activation, and mRNA expression of BIM, TRB3 and GADD34 were significantly attenuated. Moreover, 6-OHDA-mediated cell cycle arrest and transcription of p53 target genes, p21, GADD45Î± and PUMA, were reduced by luteolin. Luteolin also significantly down-regulated 6-OHDA-mediated unfolded protein response (UPR), leading to decreases in phospho-eIF2Î±, ATF4, GRP78 and CHOP. In addition, luteolin attenuated 6-OHDA-induced Nrf2-mediated HO-1 and GCLC. Taken together, these results suggest that diminishing intracellular ROS formation and down-regulation of p53, UPR and Nrf2-ARE pathways may be involved in the neuroprotective effect of luteolin."
https://openalex.org/W2040096495,"Objectives Pulmonary ground-glass nodules (GGNs) are occasionally diagnosed as invasive adenocarcinomas. This study aimed to evaluate the clinicopathological features of patients with pulmonary GGNs to identify factors predictive of pathological invasion. Methods We retrospectively evaluated 101 pulmonary GGNs resected between July 2006 and November 2013 and pathologically classified them as adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS; n = 47), minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA; n = 30), or invasive adenocarcinoma (I-ADC; n = 24). The age, sex, smoking history, tumor size, and computed tomography (CT) attenuation of the 3 groups were compared. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were performed to identify factors that could predict the presence of pathologically invasive adenocarcinomas. Results Tumor size was significantly larger in the MIA and I-ADC groups than in the AIS group. CT attenuation was significantly greater in the I-ADC group than in the AIS and MIA groups. In ROC curve analyses, the sensitivity and specificity of tumor size (cutoff, 11 mm) were 95.8% and 46.8%, respectively, and those for CT attenuation (cutoff, â680 HU) were 95.8% and 35.1%, respectively; the areas under the curve (AUC) were 0.75 and 0.77, respectively. A combination of tumor size and CT attenuation (cutoffs of 11 mm and â680 HU for tumor size and CT attenuation, respectively) yielded in a sensitivity and specificity of 91.7% and 71.4%, respectively, with an AUC of 0.82. Conclusions Tumor size and CT attenuation were predictive factors of pathological invasiveness for pulmonary GGNs. Use of a combination of tumor size and CT attenuation facilitated more accurate prediction of invasive adenocarcinoma than the use of these factors independently."
https://openalex.org/W1963997353,"Rare systemic studies concerning prevalence of intestinal parasites in children have been conducted in the second smallest country in Africa, the Democratic Republic of SÃ£o TomÃ© and PrÃ­ncipe. Fecal specimens from 348 children (214 in-hospital attending the Aires de Menezes Hospital and 134 from Agostinho Neto village) in SÃ£o Tome Island were studied by parasitological and molecular methods. Of the 134 children from Agostinho Neto, 52.2% presented intestinal parasites. 32.1% and 20.2% of these children had monoparasitism and polyparasitism, respectively. Ascaris lumbricoides (27.6%), G. duodenalis (7.5%), T. trichiura (4.5%) and Entamoeba coli (10.5%) were the more frequent species identified in the children of this village. Giardia duodenalis (7.5%) and E. bieneusi (5.2%) were identified by PCR. Nested-PCR targeting G. duodenalis TPI identified Assemblage A (60%) and Assemblage B (40%). The E. bieneusi ITS-based sequence identified genotypes K (57.1%), KIN1 (28.6%) and KIN3 (14.3%). Among the 214 in-hospital children, 29.4% presented intestinal parasites. In 22.4% and 7.0% of the parasitized children, respectively, one or more species were concurrently detected. By microscopy, A. lumbricoides (10.3%) and Trichiuris trichiura (6.5%) were the most prevalent species among these children, and Cryptosporidium was detected by PCR in 8.9% of children. GP60 locus analysis identified 6.5% of C. hominis (subtypes IaA27R3 [35.7%], IaA23R3 [14.3%], IeA11G3T3 [28.6%] and IeA11G3T3R1 [21.4%]) and 2.3% of C. parvum (subtypes IIaA16G2R1 [20.0%], IIaA15G2R1 [20.0%], IIdA26G1 [40.0%] and IIdA21G1a [20.0%]). G. duodenalis and E. bieneusi were identified in 0.5% and 8.9% of the in-hospital children, respectively. G. duodenalis Assemblage B was characterized. The E. bieneusi genotypes K (52.6%), D (26.4%), A (10.5%) and KIN1 (10.5%) were identified. Although further studies are required to clarify the epidemiology of these infectious diseases in this endemic region the significance of the present results highlights that it is crucial to strength surveillance on intestinal pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W1963816249,"In recent years genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have uncovered numerous chromosomal loci associated with various electrocardiographic traits and cardiac arrhythmia predisposition. A considerable fraction of these loci lie within inter-genic regions. The underlying trait-associated variants likely reside in regulatory regions and exert their effect by modulating gene expression. Hence, the key to unraveling the molecular mechanisms underlying these cardiac traits is to interrogate variants for association with differential transcript abundance by expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis. In this study we conducted an eQTL analysis of human heart. For a total of 129 left ventricular samples that were collected from non-diseased human donor hearts, genome-wide transcript abundance and genotyping was determined using microarrays. Each of the 18,402 transcripts and 897,683 SNP genotypes that remained after pre-processing and stringent quality control were tested for eQTL effects. We identified 771 eQTLs, regulating 429 unique transcripts. Overlaying these eQTLs with cardiac GWAS loci identified novel candidates for studies aimed at elucidating the functional and transcriptional impact of these loci. Thus, this work provides for the first time a comprehensive eQTL map of human heart: a powerful and unique resource that enables systems genetics approaches for the study of cardiac traits."

The ability of GPIHBP1 to bind LPL depends on the Ly6 domain, a three-fingered structure containing 10 cysteines and a conserved pattern of disulfide bond formation. Here, we report a patient with severe hypertriglyceridemia who was homozygous for a GPIHBP1 point mutation that converted a serine in the GPIHBP1 Ly6 domain (Ser-107) to a cysteine. Two hypertriglyceridemic siblings were homozygous for the same mutation. All three homozygotes had very low levels of LPL in the preheparin plasma. We suspected that the extra cysteine in GPIHBP1-S107C might prevent the trafficking of the protein to the cell surface, but this was not the case. However, nearly all of the GPIHBP1-S107C on the cell surface was in the form of disulfide-linked dimers and multimers, whereas wild-type GPIHBP1 was predominantly monomeric. An insect cell GPIHBP1 expression system confirmed the propensity of GPIHBP1-S107C to form disulfide-linked dimers and to form multimers. Functional studies showed that only GPIHBP1 monomers bind LPL. In keeping with that finding, there was no binding of LPL to GPIHBP1-S107C in either cell-based or cell-free binding assays.

GPIHBP1 and most mammalian members of the Ly6 family of proteins are tethered to the plasma membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor. The hallmark of Ly6 proteins is a 70â80-amino acid motif containing 8 cysteines, which are arranged in a characteristic spacing pattern and are oxidized to yield an identical disulfide bonding. The formation of disulfide bonds is one of several structural features that lead these proteins to adopt a three-fingered structure (6Fry B.G. WÃ¼ster W. Kini R.M. Brusic V. Khan A. Venkataraman D.

We uncovered a novel missense mutation that converted Ser-107 in the GPIHBP1 Ly6 domain to a cysteine. Our studies revealed the mechanism by which this GPIHBP1 mutation leads to chylomicronemia. Ninety-two patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia, defined as fasting plasma triglyceride levels >10 mmol/liter (>885 mg/dl) on at least two occasions, were identified at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital. After excluding coding-sequence and splice-site mutations in LPL, APOC2, and APOA5, we screened for GPIHBP1 mutations. A homozygous missense mutation in GPIHBP1 (c.320C>G; p.S107C) was identified in a 46-year-old woman with chylomicronemia. Unrelated normolipidemic subjects (n = 111) were recruited as experimental controls. All subjects provided informed consent, and all studies were performed according to the Declaration of Helsinki for human studies. Genomic DNA was isolated from whole blood. Each exon of GPIHBP1 and the exon-intron junctions was amplified from genomic DNA for sequencing. The primers used are shown in Table 1. A c.320C>G; p.S107C mutation was detected in a single patient and confirmed by additional DNA sequencing reactions. The functional significance of the variant was predicted in silico with the PolyPhen-2 and SNPs3D programs. Apolipoprotein E genotypes were determined by PCR and DNA sequencing.TABLE 1PCR primers for amplifying the exons of GPIHBP1GPIHBP1 exonForward primer 5â² â 3â²Reverse primer 5â² â 3â²1ACAATGACTTCTCCTTCCCCTCTCTCATCCCCTCCTTCTTCCTAAG2TGAGTAGGGTGAGTAGGGTGTTCTACTCTGGAAGGCAACTGAGTGT3CACAGCTTACAGGACCAAGTCAAGTGGGGAACAAGTGCTGAG4TGCAGAGCCACCTCAGAGACCCAAGACACTCCAAATCCATTCT Open table in a new tab Total plasma cholesterol, triglycerides, and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels were measured with enzymatic methods (Roche Diagnostics).

An expression vector for GPIHBP1-S107C was generated by site-directed mutagenesis with the QuikChange Lightning kit (Stratagene). To express soluble versions of GPIHBP1 (i.e. GPIHBP1 lacking the GPI anchor), we used a Drosophila S2 cell expression system using the carboxyl-terminal Ly6 domain (domain III) of human uPAR as a tag (24GÃ¥rdsvoll H.

DNA sequences encoding uPAR domain III, followed by sequences encoding human GPIHBP1 amino acids 21â136 and mouse GPIHBP1 amino acids 136â198 (which contain the epitope for monoclonal antibody 11A12) were ligated into pMT/V5-His (Invitrogen) with the In-Fusion HD cloning kit (Clontech). This vector contains a metallothionein promoter that allows metal-inducible expression of the protein. Mutant versions of this GPIHBP1 expression vector were generated with the QuikChange Lightning kit. To express GPIHBP1 in Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-K1 cells; American Type Culture Collection), we electroporated 5 Ã 106 cells with expression vectors (5 Î¼g) encoding S-protein-tagged versions of GPIHBP1. After 24 h, we assessed the ability of GPIHBP1 to reach the cell surface. The GPIHBP1-transfected cells were first incubated with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against the S-protein tag (21Beigneux A.P. Davies B.S. Tat S. Chen J. Gin P. Voss C.V. Weinstein M.M. Bensadoun A.

After the cells were washed, the amount of GPIHBP1 on the cell surface was assessed by performing Western blotting of cell extracts with an IRdye800-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:800; Li-Cor). The total amount of GPIHBP1 in cells was assessed by Western blotting with a goat polyclonal antibody against the S-protein tag (followed by an IRdye680-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG; 1:5,000). To determine whether GPIHBP1 on the cell surface was monomeric or was in disulfide-linked multimers, we released GPIHBP1 from the surface of cells with PIPLC (16 units/ml for 20 min at 37 Â°C). GPIHBP1 levels in the PIPLC-released material and in cell extracts were assessed by Western blotting with a goat polyclonal antibody against the S-protein tag (Abcam). In these studies, the PIPLC-released proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE under both nonreducing and reducing conditions (50 mm dithiothreitol). CHO-K1 cells were electroporated with GPIHBP1 expression vectors (5 Î¼g). 24 h after the electroporation, the GPIHBP1-expressing cells were incubated for 2 h at 4 Â°C with V5-tagged human LPL (26Ben-Zeev O.

At the end of the incubation, cells were washed six times with ice-cold PBS containing 1 mm MgCl2 and 1 mm CaCl2. Relative levels of GPIHBP1 and LPL in cell extracts were assessed by Western blotting with a goat polyclonal antibody against the S-protein tag (Abcam) and a mouse monoclonal against the V5 tag (Invitrogen). Soluble versions of GPIHBP1 were expressed in Drosophila S2 cells (Invitrogen) as fusion proteins (described earlier). The cells were plated on 6-well plates (12 Ã 106 cells/well) and transfected with 19 Î¼g of plasmid DNA with the Calcium Phosphate Transfection kit (Invitrogen). 24 h after the transfection, protein expression was induced with Schneider's medium (Sigma) containing 1% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 0.1% Pluronic F-68 (Sigma), and 500 Î¼m CuSO4. For all experiments, the cells were grown in suspension culture for 3 days. To assess the electrophoretic migration of GPIHBP1, the conditioned medium and cell extracts were subjected to electrophoresis under reducing and nonreducing conditions. The GPIHBP1 protein was then detected with IRdye680-conjugated monoclonal antibody 11A12 (which recognizes mouse GPIHBP1 sequences) and IRdye800-conjugated monoclonal antibody R24 (which recognizes uPAR domain III) (27GÃ¥rdsvoll H.

After washing the beads, soluble GPIHBP1 and GPIHBP1-bound LPL were eluted from the antibody-coated beads with 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.7. The amounts of GPIHBP1 and LPL in the starting material, unbound fractions, wash fractions, and elution fractions were assessed by Western blotting with IRdye680-conjugated antibody 11A12 and an IRdye800-conjugated V5-antibody. To determine whether LPL binds preferentially to GPIHBP1 monomers, the same assay was used except that the agarose beads were coated with the LPL-specific monoclonal antibody 5D2. In those experiments, the LPL and any GPIHBP1-bound LPL captured by the antibody-coated beads were released by boiling in sample loading buffer. The different fractions were then separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing and nonreducing conditions, and Western blotting was performed with LPL- and GPIHBP1-specific antibodies. All samples were denatured in 1% lithium dodecyl sulfate for 10 min at 70 Â°C.

Ninety-two patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia but lacking mutations in LPL, APOC2, or APOA5 were screened for GPIHBP1 mutations. A C-to-G transversion in exon 4 of GPIHBP1 (c.320C>G; p.S107C) was identified in a 46-year-old female with chylomicronemia. Her body mass index was normal. Her fasting plasma triglyceride level was 3,164 mg/dl; the fasting glucose and thyroid-stimulating hormone levels were normal. The proband was first noted to have chylomicronemia at age 40 after presenting with epigastric discomfort and a plasma triglyceride level of 2,050 mg/dl. Subsequently, her fasting plasma triglyceride levels ranged between 1,247 and 6,448 mg/dl, although one value was as low as 505 mg/dl (when she adhered to a low fat diet and gemfibrozil treatment). The epigastric discomfort recurred episodically, but a diagnosis of pancreatitis was never established. She did not have eruptive xanthomas. She reported two uneventful pregnancies. The family pedigree is shown in Fig. 1, and the plasma lipid levels for all available family members are recorded in Table 2. Two of the proband's brothers had a history of chylomicronemia but had lower plasma triglyceride levels than the proband. Both were homozygous for the p.S107C mutation (Fig. 1). Six family members were heterozygous for the p.S107C mutation, and all but subject II-2 had normal plasma triglyceride levels (Table 2). No GPIHBP1 mutations were encountered in 111 normolipemic control subjects.TABLE 2Clinical and molecular characteristics of the proband and her familySubjectAgeSexAPOE genotypeGPIHBP1 genotypeTGTCHDL-CPre-heparin LPL massFibrate therapyYearsmg/dlmg/dlmg/dlng/mlI-286FE3/E3wt/p.S107C10820643368NoII-164ME3/E3p.S107C/p.S107C8421581632YesII-262FE3/E3wt/p.S107C33826547615NoII-652FE3/E3wt/p.S107C15224846535NoII-750FE3/E3wt/p.S107C12728869283NoII-846FE3/E4p.S107C/p.S107C3,1643853223YesII-949ME3/E3wt/wt9723443184NoII-1043ME3/E4p.S107C/p.S107C6731071323NoIII-124FE3/E4wt/p.S107C8718844295NoIII-219FE3/E3wt/p.S107C4014850336No Open table in a new tab The preheparin plasma LPL levels in the three homozygotes were much lower than in the other family members (Table 2). The postheparin LPL plasma levels in the proband were extremely low (127 ng/ml), <5% of those in normolipidemic control subjects (3,240 Â± 321 ng/ml, n = 9). Ser-107 in the GPIHBP1 Ly6 domain is conserved from the egg-laying platypus to humans, and both PolyPhen-2 and SNP3D predicted that the S107C substitution would be deleterious to protein function. Because the S107C mutation introduces a new cysteine and a free thiol group into the GPIHBP1 Ly6 domain, we suspected that the mutant protein might be misfolded and manifest impaired trafficking to the cell surface. To test this idea, we expressed wild-type GPIHBP1 and GPIHBP1-S107C in CHO cells and quantified the amount of GPIHBP1 on the cell surface. As an experimental control, we tested GPIHBP1-N78Q/N82Q, where N-linked glycosylation is absent and trafficking to the cell surface is known to be impaired (21Beigneux A.P. Davies B.S. Tat S. Chen J. Gin P. Voss C.V. Weinstein M.M. Bensadoun A. Pullinger C.R. Fong L.G. Young S.G. Assessing the role of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored high density lipoprotein-binding protein 1 (GPIHBP1) three-finger domain in binding lipoprotein lipase.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 19735-19743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We also tested GPIHBP1-S107A. The S107C and S107A mutations had little effect on the amount of GPIHBP1 that reached the cell surface (95.9 Â± 0.6 and 87.7 Â± 2.1% of wild-type GPIHBP1, respectively) (Fig. 2). As we expected, reduced amounts of GPIHBP1-N78Q/N82Q reached the cell surface (39.7 Â± 0.1% of wild-type GPIHBP1). We speculated that the extra, unpaired cysteine in the Ly6 domain of GPIHBP1-S107C might lead to the formation of disulfide bonds between two GPIHBP1 proteins, resulting in dimer formation. To test this idea, we transfected CHO cells with wild-type GPIHBP1, GPIHBP1-S107C, or GPIHBP1-S107A and then released GPIHBP1 from the surface of the cells with PIPLC. The PIPLC-released proteins were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting under both reducing and nonreducing conditions. In the setting of reducing conditions, Western blots revealed similar amounts of wild-type GPIHBP1, GPIHBP1-S107C, and GPIHBP1-S107A; all proteins migrated at â¼28 kDa (Fig. 3A, midd"

We proposed that ultrasonication may be an effective agitation to trigger nucleation that would otherwise not occur under the persistent metastability of supersaturation. However, the roles of supersaturation and effects of ultrasonication have not been elucidated in detail except for limited cases. Insulin is an amyloidogenic protein that is useful for investigating the mechanisms underlying amyloid fibrillation with biological relevance. We studied the alcohol-induced amyloid fibrillation of insulin using various concentrations of 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol and 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol at pH 2.0 and 4.8. Ultrasonic irradiation effectively triggered fibrillation under conditions in which insulin retained persistent supersaturation. Structural analyses by circular dichroism, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy revealed that the dominant structures of fibrils varied between parallel and antiparallel Î²-sheets depending on the solvent conditions. pH and alcohol concentration-dependent phase diagrams showed a marked difference before and after the ultrasonic treatment, which indicated that the persistent metastability of supersaturation determined the conformations of insulin. These results indicate the importance of an alternative view of amyloid fibrils as supersaturation-limited crystal-like aggregates formed above the solubility limit."
https://openalex.org/W2156063260,"Lansoprazole is a potent anti-gastric ulcer drug that inhibits gastric proton pump activity. We identified a novel function for lansoprazole, as an inducer of anti-oxidative stress responses in the liver. Gastric administration of lansoprazole (10â100 mg/kg) to male Wistar rats produced a dose-dependent increase in hepatic mRNA levels of nuclear factor, erythroid-derived 2, -like 2 (Nrf2), a redox-sensitive transcription factor, at 3 h and Nrf2 immunoreactivity (IR) in whole hepatic lysates at 6 h. Conversely, the levels of Kelch-like ECH-associated protein (Keap1), which sequesters Nrf2 in the cytoplasm under un-stimulated conditions, were unchanged. Translocation of Nrf2 into the nuclei of hepatocytes was observed using western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Expression of mRNAs for Nrf2-dependent antioxidant and phase II enzymes, such as heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1), NAD (P) H dehydrogenase, quinone 1 (Nqo1), glutathione S-transferase A2 (Gsta2), UDP glucuronosyltransferase 1 family polypeptide A6 (Ugt1a6), were dose-dependently up-regulated at 3 h. Furthermore, the levels of HO-1 IR were dose-dependently increased in hepatocytes at 6 h. Subcutaneous administration of lansoprazole (30 mg/kg/day) for 7 successive days resulted in up-regulation and nuclear translocation of Nrf2 IR in hepatocytes and up-regulation of HO-1 IR in the liver. Pretreatment with lansoprazole attenuated thioacetamide (500 mg/kg)-induced acute hepatic damage via both HO-1-dependent and -independent pathways. Up-stream networks related to Nrf2 expression were investigated using microarray analysis, followed by data mining with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. Up-regulation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)-cytochrome P450, family 1, subfamily a, polypeptide 1 (Cyp1a1) pathway was associated with up-regulation of Nrf2 mRNA. In conclusion, lansoprazole might have an alternative indication in the prevention and treatment of oxidative hepatic damage through the induction of both phase I and phase II drug-metabolizing systems, i.e. the AhR/Cyp1a1/Nrf2 pathway in hepatocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1984523844,"Pregnancy poses a unique challenge to the human immune system: the semi-allogeneic fetus must be protected from maternal immune attack while immunity towards pathogens is maintained. Breakdown in maternal-fetal tolerance can lead to pregnancy-specific diseases with potentially high degrees of morbidity and mortality for both the mother and her fetus. Various immune cell-types could mediate these functions, but a comprehensive evaluation of the peripheral and local maternal T cell and regulatory T cell compartments in normal human pregnancy is lacking. In this case-control study, we apply the Human Immunology Project Consortium proposed gating strategies to samples from healthy 3rd trimester human subjects compared with healthy non-pregnant controls. The proportions of HLA-DR+ and CD38+ effector- and effector memory CD8 T cells are significantly increased in the peripheral blood of pregnant women. Utilizing a novel technique that takes advantage of the standard protocol for intrauterine cleanup after cesarean section, we isolate lymphocytes resident at the uteroplacental interface (UPI). At the UPI, the CD4 and CD8 T cell compartments largely mirror the peripheral blood, except that the proportion of HLA-DR+ activated T regulatory cells is significantly increased in direct proportion to an observed increase in the number of activated CD8 T cells. We find that cryopreservation and delayed sample processing (>12 hours) decreases our ability to identify regulatory T cell subsets. Further, the Consortium proposed method for Treg identification underrepresents Resting and Cytokine Tregs compared with Activated Tregs, thus skewing the entire population. Better understanding of the changes in the immune system during pregnancy in the peripheral blood and at the uteroplacental interface are essential for progress in treatment of pregnancy diseases such as pre-eclampsia and recurrent miscarriage."
https://openalex.org/W2031521774,"Background/Aims Serum amyloid A (SAA) is an acute phase reactant with significant immunological activities, including effects on cytokine synthesis and neutrophil chemotaxis. Neutrophils can also release cytokines with proinflammatory properties. IL-1Î² is a key proinflammatory cytokine, the secretion of which is controlled by inflammasome. We investigated the proinflammatory effects of SAA in vitro in relation to the NLRP3 inflammasome in neutrophils. Methodology/Principal Findings Human neutrophils isolated form healthy subjects were stimulated with serum amyloid A (SAA). The cellular supernatants were analyzed by western blot using anti-IL-1Î² or anti-caspase-1 antibodies. IL-1Î² or Nod-like receptor family, pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) mRNA expressions were analyzed by real-time PCR or reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) method. SAA stimulation induced pro-IL-1Î² mRNA expression in neutrophils. Furthermore, SAA engaged the caspase-1-activating inflammasome, resulting in the production of active IL-1Î². SAA-induced pro-IL-1Î² expression was marginally suppressed by the Syk specific inhibitor, R406, and SAA-induced pro-IL-1Î² processing in neutrophils was prevented by R406. Furthermore, SAA-induced NLRP3 mRNA expression was completely blocked by R406. Analysis of intracellular signaling revealed that SAA stimulation activated the tyrosine kinase Syk and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Conclusions/Significance These results demonstrate that the innate neutrophil immune response against SAA involves a two-step activation process: an initial signal promoting expression of pro-IL-1Î² and a second signal involving Syk-dependent activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and caspase-1, allowing processing of pro-IL-1Î² and secretion of mature IL-1Î²."
https://openalex.org/W2027973244,"Background Mesenchymal stem cells have prominent immune modulatory properties, which may have clinical applications; however their major source, bone marrow, is of limited availability. On the other hand, mesenchymal stem cells derived from human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHEDs) are readily accessible, but their immune regulatory properties have not been completely investigated. This study was designed, therefore, to evaluate the SHEDs influence on DCs differentiation, maturation, ability to activate T cells and to expand CD4+Foxp3+ T cells. Methodology/Principal Findings The experiments were based in cellular co-culture during differentiation and maturation of monocyte derived-DCs (moDCs), with, or not, presence of SHEDs. After co-culture with SHEDs, (moDCs) presented lower expression of BDCA-1 and CD11c, in comparison to DC cultivated without SHEDs. CD40, CD80, CD83 and CD86 levels were also decreased in mature DCs (mDCs) after co-cultivation with SHEDs. To assess the ability of SHEDs-exposed moDCs to modulate T cell responses, the former were separated from SHEDs, and co-cultured with peripheral blood lymphocytes. After 5 days, the proliferation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was evaluated and found to be lower than that induced by moDCs cultivated without SHEDs. In addition, an increase in the proportion of CD4+Foxp3+IL-10+ T cells was observed among cells stimulated by mature moDCs that were previously cultivated with SHEDs. Soluble factors released during co-cultures also showed a reduction in the pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-2, TNF-Î± and IFN-Î³), and an increase in the anti-inflammatory molecule IL-10. Conclusion/Significance This study shows that SHEDs induce an immune regulatory phenotype in moDCs cells, evidenced by changes in maturation and differentiation rates, inhibition of lymphocyte stimulation and ability to expand CD4+Foxp3+ T cells. Further characterization and validation of this phenomenon could support the use of SHEDs, directly or indirectly for immune modulation in the clinical practice."
https://openalex.org/W2009819840,"Two major complexes of NADPH dehydrogenase (NDH-1) have been identified in cyanobacteria. A large complex (NDH-1L) contains NdhD1 and NdhF1, which are absent in a medium size complex (NDH-1M). They play important roles in respiration, cyclic electron transport around photosystem I, and CO2 acquisition. Two mutants sensitive to high light for growth and impaired in NDH-1-mediated cyclic electron transfer were isolated from Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803 transformed with a transposon-bearing library. Both mutants had a tag in sml0013 encoding NdhP, a single transmembrane small subunit of the NDH-1 complex. During prolonged incubation of the wild type thylakoid membrane with n-dodecyl Î²-d-maltoside (DM), about half of the NDH-1L was disassembled to NDH-1M and the rest decomposed completely without forming NDH-1M. In the ndhP deletion mutant (ÎndhP), disassembling of NDH-1L to NDH-1M occurred even on ice, and decomposition to a small piece occurred at room temperature much faster than in the wild type. Deletion of the C-terminal tail of NdhP gave the same result. The C terminus of NdhP was tagged by YFP-His6. Blue native gel electrophoresis of the DM-treated thylakoid membrane of this strain and Western analysis using the antibody against GFP revealed that NdhP-YFP-His6 was exclusively confined to NDH-1L. During prolonged incubation of the thylakoid membrane of the tagged strain with DM at room temperature, NDH-1L was partially disassembled to NDH-1M and the 160-kDa band containing NdhP-YFP-His6 and possibly NdhD1 and NdhF1. We therefore conclude that NdhP, especially its C-terminal tail, is essential to assemble NdhD1 and NdhF1 and stabilize the NDH-1L complex."

We found that small amounts of UDP-sugars were released from keratinocytes and that UDP-glucose (UDP-Glc) added into keratinocyte cultures induced a specific, rapid induction of hyaluronan synthase 2 (HAS2), and an increase of hyaluronan synthesis. The up-regulation of HAS2 was associated with JAK2 and ERK1/2 activation, and specific Tyr705 phosphorylation of transcription factor STAT3. Inhibition of JAK2, STAT3, or Gi-coupled receptors blocked the induction of HAS2 expression by UDP-Glc, the latter inhibitor suggesting that the signaling was triggered by the UDP-sugar receptor P2Y14. Chromatin immunoprecipitations demonstrated increased promoter binding of Tyr(P)705-STAT3 at the time of HAS2 induction. Interestingly, at the same time Ser(P)727-STAT3 binding to its response element regions in the HAS2 promoter was unchanged or decreased. UDP-Glc also stimulated keratinocyte migration, proliferation, and IL-8 expression, supporting a notion that UDP-Glc signals for epidermal inflammation, enhanced hyaluronan synthesis as an integral part of it.

https://openalex.org/W2084012808,"We conducted this mixed-method study among 748 children aged 6 months-14 years attending 9 of a total of 32 care and treatment centers in Tanga region, Tanzania. We collected quantitative data using a standard questionnaire and qualitative data through seven focus group discussions (FGDs).HIV-positive children had high magnitudes of undernutrition. Stunting, underweight, wasting, and thinness were prevalent among 61.9%, 38.7%, 26.0%, and 21.1% of HIV-positive children, respectively. They also had poor feeding practices: 88.1% were fed at a frequency below the recommendations, and 62.3% had a low level of dietary diversity. Lower feeding frequency was associated with stunting (Î² = 0.11, p = 0.016); underweight (Î² = 0.12, p = 0.029); and thinness (Î² = 0.11, p = 0.026). Lower feeding frequency was associated with low wealth index (Î² = 0.06, p<0.001), food insecurity (Î² = -0.05, p<0.001), and caregiver's education. In the FGDs, participants discussed the causal relationships among the key associations; undernutrition was mainly due to low feeding frequency and dietary diversity. Such poor feeding practices resulted from poor nutrition knowledge, food insecurity, low income, and poverty.Feeding practices and nutrition status were poor among HIV-positive children even in food rich areas. Improving feeding frequency may help to ameliorate undernutrition. To improve it, tailored interventions should target children of poor households, the food insecure, and caregivers who have received only a low level of education."
https://openalex.org/W2084852123,"Grassland bird species have experienced substantial declines in North America. These declines have been largely attributed to habitat loss and degradation, especially from agricultural practices and intensification (the habitat-availability hypothesis). A recent analysis of North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) âgrassland breedingâ bird trends reported the surprising conclusion that insecticide acute toxicity was a better correlate of grassland bird declines in North America from 1980â2003 (the insecticide-acute-toxicity hypothesis) than was habitat loss through agricultural intensification. In this paper we reached the opposite conclusion. We used an alternative statistical approach with additional habitat covariates to analyze the same grassland bird trends over the same time frame. Grassland bird trends were positively associated with increases in area of Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) lands and cropland used as pasture, whereas the effect of insecticide acute toxicity on bird trends was uncertain. Our models suggested that acute insecticide risk potentially has a detrimental effect on grassland bird trends, but models representing the habitat-availability hypothesis were 1.3â21.0 times better supported than models representing the insecticide-acute-toxicity hypothesis. Based on point estimates of effect sizes, CRP area and agricultural intensification had approximately 3.6 and 1.6 times more effect on grassland bird trends than lethal insecticide risk, respectively. Our findings suggest that preserving remaining grasslands is crucial to conserving grassland bird populations. The amount of grassland that has been lost in North America since 1980 is well documented, continuing, and staggering whereas insecticide use greatly declined prior to the 1990s. Grassland birds will likely benefit from the de-intensification of agricultural practices and the interspersion of pastures, Conservation Reserve Program lands, rangelands and other grassland habitats into existing agricultural landscapes."
https://openalex.org/W2054705261,"Romania is one of the countries with the highest prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in the world. To obtain data on affiliation of MRSA to strains and clonal complexes and on the population of methicillin susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), clinical isolates from bloodstream infections, skin and soft tissue infections as well as from screening swabs were collected at hospitals in Ia?i, a city in the North-Eastern part of Romania. Isolates were characterised by microarray hybridisation. Nearly half of all isolates (47%), and about one third (34%) of bloodstream isolates were MRSA. The prevalence of the Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) was also high (31% among MRSA, 14% among MSSA). The most common MRSA strain was a PVL-negative CC1-MRSA-IV that might have emerged locally, as a related MSSA was also common. PVL-positive CC8-MRSA-IV (âUSA300â) and PVL-negative ST239-like MRSA-III were also frequently found while other MRSA strains were only sporadically detected. Among MSSA, PVL-positive CC121 as well as PVL-negative CC1, CC22 and CC45 predominated. Although this study provides only a snapshot of S. aureus/MRSA epidemiology in Romania, it confirms the high burden of MRSA and PVL on Romanian healthcare settings."
https://openalex.org/W2063814503,"This study describes the development of aptamers as a therapy against influenza virus infection. Aptamers are oligonucleotides (like ssDNA or RNA) that are capable of binding to a variety of molecular targets with high affinity and specificity. We have studied the ssDNA aptamer BV02, which was designed to inhibit influenza infection by targeting the hemagglutinin viral protein, a protein that facilitates the first stage of the virusâ infection. While testing other aptamers and during lead optimization, we realized that the dominant characteristics that determine the aptamerâs binding to the influenza virus may not necessarily be sequence-specific, as with other known aptamers, but rather depend on general 2D structural motifs. We adopted QSAR (quantitative structure activity relationship) tool and developed computational algorithm that correlate six calculated structural and physicochemical properties to the aptamersâ binding affinity to the virus. The QSAR study provided us with a predictive tool of the binding potential of an aptamer to the influenza virus. The correlation between the calculated and actual binding was R2 = 0.702 for the training set, and R2 = 0.66 for the independent test set. Moreover, in the test set the modelâs sensitivity was 89%, and the specificity was 87%, in selecting aptamers with enhanced viral binding. The most important properties that positively correlated with the aptamerâs binding were the aptamer length, 2D-loops and repeating sequences of C nucleotides. Based on the structure-activity study, we have managed to produce aptamers having viral affinity that was more than 20 times higher than that of the original BV02 aptamer. Further testing of influenza infection in cell culture and animal models yielded aptamers with 10 to 15 times greater anti-viral activity than the BV02 aptamer. Our insights concerning the mechanism of action and the structural and physicochemical properties that govern the interaction with the influenza virus are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1965997555,"The metabolome is a highly dynamic entity and the final readout of the genotype x environment x phenotype (GxExP) relationship of an organism. Monitoring metabolite dynamics over time thus theoretically encrypts the whole range of possible chemical and biochemical transformations of small molecules involved in metabolism. The bottleneck is, however, the sheer number of unidentified structures in these samples. This represents the next challenge for metabolomics technology and is comparable with genome sequencing 30 years ago. At the same time it is impossible to handle the amount of data involved in a metabolomics analysis manually. Algorithms are therefore imperative to allow for automated m/z feature extraction and subsequent structure or pathway assignment. Here we provide an automated pathway inference strategy comprising measurements of metabolome time series using LC- MS with high resolution and high mass accuracy. An algorithm was developed, called mzGroupAnalyzer, to automatically explore the metabolome for the detection of metabolite transformations caused by biochemical or chemical modifications. Pathways are extracted directly from the data and putative novel structures can be identified. The detected m/z features can be mapped on a van Krevelen diagram according to their H/C and O/C ratios for pattern recognition and to visualize oxidative processes and biochemical transformations. This method was applied to Arabidopsis thaliana treated simultaneously with cold and high light. Due to a protective antioxidant response the plants turn from green to purple color via the accumulation of flavonoid structures. The detection of potential biochemical pathways resulted in 15 putatively new compounds involved in the flavonoid-pathway. These compounds were further validated by product ion spectra from the same data. The mzGroupAnalyzer is implemented in the graphical user interface (GUI) of the metabolomics toolbox COVAIN (Sun & Weckwerth, 2012, Metabolomics 8: 81â93). The strategy can be extended to any biological system."
https://openalex.org/W1964951859,"Protein kinase A (PKA) enhances synaptic plasticity in the central nervous system by increasing NMDA receptor current amplitude and Ca(2+) flux in an isoform-dependent yet poorly understood manner. PKA phosphorylates multiple residues on GluN1, GluN2A, and GluN2B subunits in vivo, but the functional significance of this multiplicity is unknown. We examined gating and permeation properties of recombinant NMDA receptor isoforms and of receptors with altered C-terminal domain (CTDs) prior to and after pharmacological inhibition of PKA. We found that PKA inhibition decreased GluN1/GluN2B but not GluN1/GluN2A gating; this effect was due to slower rates for receptor activation and resensitization and was mediated exclusively by the GluN2B CTD. In contrast, PKA inhibition reduced NMDA receptor-relative Ca(2+) permeability (PCa/PNa) regardless of the GluN2 isoform and required the GluN1 CTD; this effect was due primarily to decreased unitary Ca(2+) conductance, because neither Na(+) conductance nor Ca(2+)-dependent block was altered substantially. Finally, we show that both the gating and permeation effects can be reproduced by changing the phosphorylation state of a single residue: GluN2B Ser-1166 and GluN1 Ser-897, respectively. We conclude that PKA effects on NMDA receptor gating and Ca(2+) permeability rely on distinct phosphorylation sites located on the CTD of GluN2B and GluN1 subunits. This separate control of NMDA receptor properties by PKA may account for the specific effects of PKA on plasticity during synaptic development and may lead to drugs targeted to alter NMDA receptor gating or Ca(2+) permeability."

Participants were selected for the absence of psychiatric disorder and of a serious medical condition that could affect brain functioning. Cognitive functioning was measured with the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS), the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, Trail Making Test part A, and the WAIS III Letter Number Sequencing subtest. Linear regression analyses were used to measure the quantitative association between cognitive scores and Cytomegalovirus IgG antibody level. Logistic regression analyses were used to measure the odds of low cognitive scores and elevated antibody levels defined as an antibody level > = 50th, 75th, and 90th percentile of the group.Higher levels of CMV antibodies were associated with lower performance on RBANS Total (coefficient -1.03, p<.0002), Delayed Memory (coefficient -0.94, p<.001), Visuospatial/Constructional (coefficient -1.77, p<5Ã10(-7)), and Letter Number Sequencing (coefficient -0.15, p<.03). There was an incremental relationship between the level of CMV antibody elevation and the odds of a low RBANS Total score. The odds of a low total cognitive score were 1.63 (95th % CI 1.01, 2.64; p<.045), 2.22 (95th % CI 1.33, 3.70; p<.002), and 2.46 (95th % CI 1.24, 4.86; p<.010) with a CMV antibody level greater than or equal to the 50th, 75th, and 90th percentile respectively.Higher levels of Cytomegalovirus antibodies are associated with lower levels of cognitive functioning in non-elderly adults. Methods for the prevention and treatment of CMV infection should be evaluated to determine if they result in an improvement in cognitive functioning in otherwise healthy adults."

In the present study, we assessed the NCX activity in skeletal muscle cells from MHN and MHS swine and mice by measuring [Ca2+]r and [Na+]r in response to external sodium withdrawal. In addition, we studied the contribution of NCX on the Ca2+ transient associated with sustained membrane depolarization induced by high [K+]e and during an in vivo MH episode elicited by halothane in murine MHS muscle fibers. In doing so, we demonstrated that the activity of NCX3 is enhanced in MHS muscle cells and that its reverse mode contributes to the Ca2+ transients elicited by K+ depolarization and halothane-induced elevation on intracellular Ca2+ in murine muscle fibers. Experiments were conducted: (i) in vitro, using intact intercostal muscle biopsies obtained from 16 MHS Poland China (RYR1 R615C-Homozygous) and 8 MHN Yorkshire swine. MH susceptibility was determined by PCR amplification of RYR1 exon 10 in genomic DNA and halothane challenge as previously described (28Vogeli P. Bolt R. Fries R. Stranzinger G. Co-segregation of the malignant hyperthermia and the Arg615-Cys615 mutation in the skeletal muscle calcium release channel protein in five European Landrace and Pietrain pig breeds.Anim. Genet. 1994; 25: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Muscle biopsy specimens were removed under general anesthesia using non-triggering agents (thiopental 15 mg/kg for induction, NO2/O2/fentanyl to anesthetized the animal). After surgical removal, intact muscle biopsy samples were placed in a temperature-controlled dish (37 Â°C) bubbled with a mixture of 95% O2 and 5% CO2, then dissected free of adipose and connective tissue with the aid of a stereo microscope. They were further divided into several small bundles of four to six muscle fibers for the Ca2+ measurements. (ii) In vitro, Flexor digitorum brevis (FDB) muscle fibers from 3â4-month-old C57BL/6 MHN and congenic heterozygous RYR1 R163C C57BL/6 MHS mice (29Yang T. Riehl J. Esteve E. Matthaei K.I. Goth S. Allen P.D. Pessah I.N. Lopez J.R. Pharmacologic and functional characterization of malignant hyperthermia in the R163C RyR1 knock-in mouse.Anesthesiology. 2006; 105: 1164-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) were obtained by enzymatic digestion. FDB muscles were incubated with 400 units/ml of collagenase type 2 (Worthington, Lakewood, NJ) in DMEM supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin (1 time) for 90 min at 37 Â°C and 5% CO2. Muscles were then washed in DMEM and single fibers were mechanically dissociated with progressively smaller fire-polished Pasteur pipettes. Isolated fibers were seeded in ECM-coated 96-well plates in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin (1 time) and incubated at 37 Â°C and 5% CO2. Fibers were used for experimentation 20â24 h after isolation. (iii) In vivo, in vastus lateralis fibers in anesthetized MHN and MHS mice as described previously (18Nelson T.E. Malignant hyperthermia: a pharmacogenetic disease of Ca2+ regulating proteins.Curr. Mol. Med. 2002; 2: 347-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The institutional animal care committees at the Instituto Venezolano de Investigaciones CientÃ­ficas, the Harvard Medical Area, and the University of California, Davis, approved all experimental protocols. Double-barreled Ca2+ selective and Na+ selective microelectrodes were prepared as described previously (19Eltit J.M. Ding X. Pessah I.N. Allen P.D. Lopez J.R. Nonspecific sarcolemmal cation channels are critical for the pathogenesis of malignant hyperthermia.FASEB J. 2013; 27: 991-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The calcium ionophore II, ETH-129 (Fluka, Sigma), and the Na+ ionophore I, ETH-227 (Fluka, Sigma), were used to back-fill the Ca2+ and Na+-selective microelectrodes, respectively. Each ion-selective microelectrode was individually calibrated as described previously (25Eltit J.M. Bannister R.A. Moua O. Altamirano F. Hopkins P.M. Pessah I.N. Molinski T.F. LÃ³pez J.R. Beam K.G. Allen P.D. Malignant hyperthermia susceptibility arising from altered resting coupling between the skeletal muscle l-type Ca2+ channel and the type 1 ryanodine receptor.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

J. 1983; 43: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). After making measurements of [Ca2+]r and [Na+]r all microelectrodes were recalibrated, and if the two calibration curves did not agree within 3 mV, data from that microelectrode were discarded. The drugs used in the present study did not interfere with Ca2+ microelectrode sensitivity in the relevant ranges studied (from pCa6 to pCa7 and from 1 to 30 mm Na+). Measurements of Vm, [Ca2+]r, and [Na+]r, were performed on intact intercostal muscle bundles obtained from MHN and MHS swine. The intact muscle bundles were mounted horizontally in a Plexiglas temperature-controlled chamber (International Plastic, Miami, FL) (36 Â± 1.5 Â°C) that was placed on the stage of an upright microscope. Each tendon was fastened to a stainless steel hook connected to micromanipulators and the sarcomere length was adjusted to 2.2 Î¼m using a laser diffraction technique (31Edman K.A. Flitney F.W. Laser diffraction studies of sarcomere dynamics during âisometricâ relaxation in isolated muscle fibres of the frog.J. Physiol. 1982; 329: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The muscle preparation was perfused continuously with bicarbonate-buffered swine physiologic solution (see below for composition), bubbled with a mixture of 95% O2 and 5% CO2, pH 7.4. Individual muscle fibers were impaled with either a double-barreled Ca2+ or Na+ selective microelectrodes and Vm, VCaE, and VNaE potentials were recorded via high impedance amplifier (WPI FD-223 or WPI Duo 773 electrometer; WPI, Sarasota, FL). The potential from the Vm barrel (3 m KCl) was subtracted electronically from VCaE or VNaE, to produce a differential Ca2+-specific (VCa) or Na+ specific (VNa) potential that represents [Ca2+]r or [Na+]r. Vm, VCa, and VNa were filtered with a low-pass filter (30â50 KHz) to improve the signal-to-noise ratio and stored in a computer for further analysis. [Ca2+]r and [Na+]r were measured in vivo in MHN and MHS mice as described previously (19Eltit J.M. Ding X. Pessah I.N. Allen P.D. Lopez J.R. Nonspecific sarcolemmal cation channels are critical for the pathogenesis of malignant hyperthermia.FASEB J. 2013; 27: 991-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In brief, mice were anesthetized with 100 mg/kg of ketamine and 5 mg/kg of xylazine, intubated, and ventilated with air using a mouse ventilator (Harvard Minivent, M-845, Holliston, MA). The mice were kept euthermic (37â37.5 Â°C) using of a heating pad with an automated feedback loop (ATC-1000 temperature controller, WPI, Sarasota, FL). The vastus lateralis was then exposed surgically and determinations of [Ca2+]r or [Na+]r were made in its superficial fibers. Several muscle fibers in each leg were impaled to measure ion concentrations for each condition in each leg (control condition, after test drug application and after halothane exposure). Halothane (1.5%) was administered using a vaporizer (Kent Scientific Corporation, Torrington, CT) connected to the ventilator in such a way as to prevent backpressure on the vaporizer. The procedure to record Vm, VCaE, and VNaE and to obtain and process the specific potential for Ca2+ (VCa) or Na+ (VNa) for later analysis was identical to that described above for in vitro experiments. It is well established that glycerol treatment can be used to osmotically disrupt the transverse tubules in skeletal muscle (32Davey D.F. Dulhunty A.F. Fatkin D. Glycerol treatment in mammalian skeletal muscle.J. Membr. Biol. 1980; 53: 223-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 33Eisenberg B. Eisenberg R.S. Transverse tubular system in glycerol-treated skeletal muscle.Science. 1968; 160: 1243-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Briefly, intact MHN and MHS swine muscle fibers were incubated in 350 mm glycerol solution for 1 h, and then returned to normal swine physiologic solution (32Davey D.F. Dulhunty A.F. Fatkin D. Glycerol treatment in mammalian skeletal muscle.J. Membr. Biol. 1980; 53: 223-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Destruction of the transverse tubular system occurs not in the glycerol solution itself, but occurs only after the muscle fibers have been returned to normal physiologic solution due to the osmotic shock produced by glycerol withdrawal. The osmotic shock produces a physical and functional dissociation of the t-tubules from the surface membrane (detubulation) (32Davey D.F. Dulhunty A.F. Fatkin D. Glycerol treatment in mammalian skeletal muscle.J. Membr. Biol. 1980; 53: 223-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 33Eisenberg B. Eisenberg R.S. Transverse tubular system in glycerol-treated skeletal muscle.Science. 1968; 160: 1243-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Isolated FDB fibers were loaded in a solution of Fluo4-AM (50 Î¼g vial) dissolved in 20% pluronic acid in DMSO (15 Î¼l), and diluted in murine physiological solution to a final concentration of 10 Î¼m. Dye loading was done at room temperature for 30 min and muscle cells were then washed once with normal murine physiological solution and then transferred to the stage of an IX71 inverted microscope. To prevent motion artifact due to muscle contraction during K+ depolarization the perfused solution was supplemented with 10 Î¼m N-benzyl-p-toluene sulfonamide (Sigma). The experimental protocol used was the following: single muscle fibers were perfused with normal potassium (5 mm K+) solution for 1 min, then with high potassium (60 mm K+) solution for 3 min, and then returned to normal (5 mm K+) solution for another 1 min. To study the contribution of NCX3 reverse mode on K+ depolarization-induced Ca2+ transients, muscle fibers were preincubated with 1 Î¼m YM-244769 for 5 min and then used at the same depolarization protocol as described above (1 Î¼m YM-244769 was added to all the solutions). For measurements of Ca2+ transients, fibers were illuminated at 494 nm to excite Fluo-4 with a DeltaRam wavelength-selectable light source. Fluorescence emission at 510 nm was captured from individual muscle fibers at 20 frames/s using a Cascade Evolve 512 camera (Photometrics, Tucson, AZ). The images were acquired using the Easy Ratio Pro software (PTI). Fluorescence data (F) were normalized to the fluorescence base line (Fo) of each individual fiber and expressed as (F â F0)/F0 or ÎF/F0. The data were analyzed using Prism 6 software (GraphPad Software, Inc.). Peak amplitude and area under the curve within the evoked responses was calculated from the number of fibers indicated in the bar graphs. Rates of decay (k) were calculated adjusting the curve to a single exponential decay function (y(t) = y0 Â· eâkt). Primary myoblasts were isolated from the hindlimb and forelimb muscles of neonatal MHS (R163C Het) mice and their MHN (C57BL/6) littermates (34EstÃ¨ve E. Eltit J.M. Bannister R.A. Liu K. Pessah I.N.

Physiol. 2010; 135: 619-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Myoblasts were differentiated for 3 days into myotubes by withdrawal of growth factors as described previously (34EstÃ¨ve E. Eltit J.M. Bannister R.A. Liu K. Pessah I.N. Beam K.G. Allen P.D. LÃ³pez J.R.

Myoblasts were placed in DMEM low glucose 5% horse serum and 1Ã penicillin/streptomycin/glutamine for 1 day and the transfected with either scramble FITC siRNA or NCX3 siRNA (a pool of 3 target-specific 19â25-nucleotide siRNAs, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and scramble FITC siRNA (25 nm) with DharmaFECT 1 transfection reagent (Thermo Scientific) for 1 day at 37 Â°C in DMEM low glucose 5% horse serum without antibiotics according to the manufacturer's instructions. Media was changed after 1 day (with antibiotics) and myotubes were differentiated for another day (total 3 days of differentiation). Myotubes were then loaded with 5 Î¼m Fura2-AM for 30 min at room temperature and calcium transients were assessed with high potassium solution as described above. FITC fluorescence channel was used to select transfected myotubes to carry out the experiments. [Ca2+]r was assessed by Ca2+ selective microelectrodes as described above. Total myotubes lysates were analyzed by standard Western blot technique 48 h after transfection (see below). Adult FDB fibers were loaded with Fluo-4AM and incubated with N-benzyl-p-toluene sulfonamide to avoid contraction artifacts. SR Ca2+ loading was measured using the area under the curve following a 30-s exposure to 20 mm caffeine in Ca2+-free media (+1 mm EGTA). Myotubes were loaded with Fluo-4AM. SR Ca2+ loading was evaluated by measuring the area under the curve of the Ca2+ transient evoked by a 60-s exposure to 5 Î¼m ionomycin in Ca2+-free media (+1 mm EGTA). To test the effect of YM-244769 on SR Ca2+ loading both adult FDB fibers and myotubes were incubated for 5 min with 1 Î¼m YM-244769 and this concentration was maintained constant during exposure to either caffeine or ionomycin. Quadriceps muscles were dissected and minced to smaller pieces with a pair of scissors and then homogenized with an electric homogenizer in modified RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 1Ã Roche Complete protease inhibitor). Myotubes were scraped in modified RIPA buffer. Lysates were incubated for 30 min on ice and then spun down by centrifugation at 16,000 Ã g for 20 min at 4 Â°C. Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA method (Thermo Scientific). Proteins (50 Î¼g) were separated using SDS-PAGE 4â15% gradient gels (Bio-Rad) and transferred to PVDF membranes. The PVDF membranes were blocked with SEA Blocking Buffer, 0.1% Tween 20 (Thermo Scientific), incubated overnight at 4 Â°C with NCX3 (Alpha Diagnostic International, 1:1000) and GAPDH (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:5000) antibodies in blocking buffer, and then washed with PBS, 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T). After washing they were incubated with the secondary antibodies in blocking buffer (IRDye 680 and 800 nm, Li-COR Biosciences) for 1 h, then washed with PBS-T and quantified with Odyssey Imaging System (Li-COR Biosciences).

https://openalex.org/W2132049003,"Following spinal cord injury (SCI) there are drastic changes that occur in the spinal microvasculature, including ischemia, hemorrhage, endothelial cell death and blood-spinal cord barrier disruption. Vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) is a pleiotropic factor recognized for its pro-angiogenic properties; however, VEGF has recently been shown to provide neuroprotection. We hypothesized that delivery of AdV-ZFP-VEGF--an adenovirally delivered bio-engineered zinc-finger transcription factor that promotes endogenous VEGF-A expression--would result in angiogenesis, neuroprotection and functional recovery following SCI. This novel VEGF gene therapy induces the endogenous production of multiple VEGF-A isoforms; a critical factor for proper vascular development and repair. Briefly, female Wistar rats--under cyclosporin immunosuppression--received a 35 g clip-compression injury and were administered AdV-ZFP-VEGF or AdV-eGFP at 24 hours post-SCI. qRT-PCR and Western Blot analysis of VEGF-A mRNA and protein, showed significant increases in VEGF-A expression in AdV-ZFP-VEGF treated animals (p<0.001 and p<0.05, respectively). Analysis of NF200, TUNEL, and RECA-1 indicated that AdV-ZFP-VEGF increased axonal preservation (p<0.05), reduced cell death (p<0.01), and increased blood vessels (p<0.01), respectively. Moreover, AdV-ZFP-VEGF resulted in a 10% increase in blood vessel proliferation (p<0.001). Catwalkâ¢ analysis showed AdV-ZFP-VEGF treatment dramatically improves hindlimb weight support (p<0.05) and increases hindlimb swing speed (p<0.02) when compared to control animals. Finally, AdV-ZFP-VEGF administration provided a significant reduction in allodynia (p<0.01). Overall, the results of this study indicate that AdV-ZFP-VEGF administration can be delivered in a clinically relevant time-window following SCI (24 hours) and provide significant molecular and functional benefits."
https://openalex.org/W1971214948,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) causes a high disease burden among the elderly worldwide. In Taiwan, the long-term temporal trend of COPD mortality is declining, but the geographical disparity of the disease is not yet known. Nationwide COPD age-adjusted mortality at the township level during 1999-2007 is used for elucidating the geographical distribution of the disease. With an ordinary least squares (OLS) model and geographically weighted regression (GWR), the ecologic risk factors such as smoking rate, area deprivation index, tuberculosis exposure, percentage of aborigines, density of health care facilities, air pollution and altitude are all considered in both models to evaluate their effects on mortality. Global and local Moran's I are used for examining their spatial autocorrelation and identifying clusters. During the study period, the COPD age-adjusted mortality rates in males declined from 26.83 to 19.67 per 100,000 population, and those in females declined from 8.98 to 5.70 per 100,000 population. Overall, males' COPD mortality rate was around three times higher than females'. In the results of GWR, the median coefficients of smoking rate, the percentage of aborigines, PM10 and the altitude are positively correlated with COPD mortality in males and females. The median value of density of health care facilities is negatively correlated with COPD mortality. The overall adjusted R-squares are about 20% higher in the GWR model than in the OLS model. The local Moran's I of the GWR's residuals reflected the consistent high-high cluster in southern Taiwan. The findings indicate that geographical disparities in COPD mortality exist. Future epidemiological investigation is required to understand the specific risk factors within the clustering areas."
https://openalex.org/W2011395676,"Soybean oil has a wide variety of uses, and stearic acid, which is a relatively minor component of soybean oil is increasingly desired for both industrial and food applications. New soybean mutants containing high levels of the saturated fatty acid stearate in seeds were recently identified from a chemically mutagenized population. Six mutants ranged in stearate content from 6â14% stearic acid, which is 1.5 to 3 times the levels contained in wild-type seed of the Williams 82 cultivar. Candidate gene sequencing revealed that all of these lines carried amino acid substitutions in the gene encoding the delta-9-stearoyl-acyl-carrier protein desaturase enzyme (SACPD-C) required for the conversion of stearic acid to oleic acid. Five of these missense mutations were in highly conserved residues clustered around the predicted di-iron center of the SACPD-C enzyme. Co-segregation analysis demonstrated a positive association of the elevated stearate trait with the SACPD-C mutation for three populations. These missense mutations may provide additional alleles that may be used in the development of new soybean cultivars with increased levels of stearic acid."
https://openalex.org/W1963626412,"Soluble P-selectin (sP-selectin), a biomarker of inflammatory related pathologies including cardiovascular and peripheral vascular diseases, also has pro-atherosclerotic effects including the ability to increase leukocyte recruitment and modulate thrombotic responses in vivo. The current study explores its role in progressing atherosclerotic plaque disease. Apoe-/- mice placed on a high fat diet (HFD) were given daily injections of recombinant dimeric murine P-selectin (22.5 Âµg/kg/day) for 8 or 16 weeks. Saline or sE-selectin injections were used as negative controls. In order to assess the role of sP-selectin on atherothrombosis an experimental plaque remodelling murine model, with sm22Î±-hDTR Apoe-/- mice on a HFD in conjunction with delivery of diphtheria toxin to induce targeted vascular smooth muscle apoptosis, was used. These mice were similarly given daily injections of sP-selectin for 8 or 16 weeks. While plaque mass and aortic lipid content did not change with sP-selectin treatment in Apoe-/- or SM22Î±-hDTR Apoe-/- mice on HFD, increased plasma MCP-1 and a higher plaque CD45 content in Apoe-/- HFD mice was observed. As well, a significant shift towards a more unstable plaque phenotype in the SM22Î±-hDTR Apoe-/- HFD mice, with increased macrophage accumulation and lower collagen content, leading to a lower plaque stability index, was observed. These results demonstrate that chronically raised sP-selectin favours progression of an unstable atherosclerotic plaque phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2091917897,"Actin plays a role in various processes in eukaryotic cells, including cell growth and death. We investigated whether the antitumor effect of trichostatin A (TSA) is associated with the dynamic rearrangement of F-actin. TSA is an antitumor drug that induces hyper-acetylation of histones by inhibiting histone deacetylase. HeLa human cervical cancer cells were used to measure the antitumor effect of TSA. The percent cell survival was determined by an MTT assay. Hypodiploid cell formation was assessed by flow cytometry. Collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) was identified by a decrease in the percentage of cells with red MitoProbe J-aggregate (JC-1) fluorescence. Cell survival was reduced by treatment with TSA, as judged by an MTT assay and staining with propidium iodide, FITC-labeled annexin V, or 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). TSA also induced an MMP collapse, as judged by the measurement of intracellular red JC-1 fluorescence. In addition, the F-actin depolymerizers cytochalasin D (CytoD) and latrunculin B (LatB) induced an MMP collapse and increased apoptotic cell death in HeLa cells. However, our data show that apoptotic cell death and the MMP collapse induced by TSA were decreased by the co-treatment of cells with CytoD and LatB. These findings demonstrate that the dynamic rearrangement of F-actin might be necessary for TSA-induced HeLa cell apoptosis involving a TSA-induced MMP collapse. They also suggest that actin cytoskeleton dynamics play an important role in maintaining the therapeutic effects of antitumor agents in tumor cells. They further suggest that maintaining the MMP could be a novel strategy for increasing drug sensitivity in TSA-treated tumors."
https://openalex.org/W1971226232,"To date, malignant pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas (PHEOs/PGLs) cannot be effectively cured and thus novel treatment strategies are urgently needed. Lovastatin has been shown to effectively induce apoptosis in mouse PHEO cells (MPC) and the more aggressive mouse tumor tissue-derived cells (MTT), which was accompanied by decreased phosphorylation of mitogen-activated kinase (MAPK) pathway players. The MAPK pathway plays a role in numerous aggressive tumors and has been associated with a subgroup of PHEOs/PGLs, including K-RAS-, RET-, and NF1-mutated tumors. Our aim was to establish whether MAPK signaling may also play a role in aggressive, succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) B mutation-derived PHEOs/PGLs. Expression profiling and western blot analysis indicated that specific aspects of MAPK-signaling are active in SDHB PHEOs/PGLs, suggesting that inhibition by statin treatment could be beneficial. Moreover, we aimed to assess whether the anti-proliferative effect of lovastatin on MPC and MTT differed from that exerted by fluvastatin, simvastatin, atorvastatin, pravastatin, or rosuvastatin. Simvastatin and fluvastatin decreased cell proliferation most effectively and the more aggressive MTT cells appeared more sensitive in this respect. Inhibition of MAPK1 and 3 phosphorylation following treatment with fluvastatin, simvastatin, and lovastatin was confirmed by western blot. Increased levels of CASP-3 and PARP cleavage confirmed induction of apoptosis following the treatment. At a concentration low enough not to affect cell proliferation, spontaneous migration of MPC and MTT was significantly inhibited within 24 hours of treatment. In conclusion, lipophilic statins may present a promising therapeutic option for treatment of aggressive human paragangliomas by inducing apoptosis and inhibiting tumor spread."
https://openalex.org/W2007557543,"Cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy regimen is a reasonable alternative to cystectomy in advanced/metastatic bladder cancer, but acquisition of cisplatin resistance is common in patients with bladder cancer. Previous studies showed that loss of homeodomain-interacting protein kinase-2 (HIPK2) contributes to cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. However, the role of HIPK2 in regulating chemoresistance of cancer cell is not fully understood. In the present study, we found that HIPK2 mRNA and protein levels are significantly decreased in cisplatin-resistant bladder cancer cell in vivo and in vitro. Downregulation of HIPK2 increases the cell viability in a dose- and time-dependent manner during cisplatin treatment, whereas overexpression of HIPK2 reduces the cell viability. HIPK2 overexpression partially overcomes cisplatin resistance in RT4-CisR cell. Furthermore, we showed that Wip1 (wild-type p53-induced phosphatase 1) expression is upregulated in RT4-CisR cell compared with RT4 cell, and HIPK2 negatively regulates Wip1 expression in bladder cancer cell. HIPK2 and Wip1 expression is also negatively correlated after cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy in vivo. Finally, we demonstrated that overexpression of HIPK2 sensitizes chemoresistant bladder cancer cell to cisplatin by regulating Wip1 expression.These data suggest that HIPK2/Wip1 signaling represents a novel pathway regulating chemoresistance, thus offering a new target for chemotherapy of bladder cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2014996538,"Background A 7.0-magnitude earthquake hit Lushan County in Chinaâs Sichuan province on April 20, 2013, resulting in 196 deaths and 11,470 injured. This study was designed to analyze the characteristics of the injuries and the treatment of the seismic victims. Methods After the earthquake, an epidemiological survey of injured patients was conducted by the Health Department of Sichuan Province. Epidemiological survey tools included paper-and-pencil questionnaires and a data management system based on the Access Database. Questionnaires were completed based on the medical records of inpatients with earthquake-related injuries. Outpatients or non-seismic injured inpatients were excluded. A total of 2010 patients from 140 hospitals were included. Results The most common type of injuries involved bone fractures (58.3%). Children younger than 10 years of age suffered fewer fractures and chest injuries, but more skin and soft -tissue injuries. Patients older than 80 years were more likely to suffer hip and thigh fractures, pelvis fractures, and chest injuries, whereas adult patients suffered more ankle and foot fractures. A total of 207 cases of calcaneal fracture were due to high falling injuries related to extreme panic. The most common type of infection in hospitalized patients was pulmonary infections. A total of 70.5% patients had limb dysfunction, and 60.1% of this group received rehabilitation. Most patients received rehabilitation within 1 week, and the median duration of rehabilitation was 3 weeks. The cause of death of all seven hospitalized patients who died was severe traumatic brain injuries; five of this group died within 24 h after the earthquake. Conclusions Injuries varied as a function of the age of the victim. As more injuries were indirectly caused by the Lushan earthquake, disaster education is urgently needed to avoid secondary injuries."
https://openalex.org/W2019673736,"There is an ongoing concern about the risk of injury to the spine in professional rugby players. The objective of this study was to investigate the prevalence of vertebral fracture using vertebral fracture assessment (VFA) dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) imaging in professional male rugby players. Ninety five professional rugby league (n = 52) and union (n = 43) players (n = 95; age 25.9 (SD 4.3) years; BMI: 29.5 (SD 2.9) kg.m2) participated in the research. Each participant received one VFA, and one total body and lumbar spine DXA scan (GE Lunar iDXA). One hundred and twenty vertebral fractures were identified in over half of the sample by VFA. Seventy four were graded mild (grade 1), 40 moderate (grade 2) and 6 severe (grade 3). Multiple vertebral fractures (â¥2) were found in 37 players (39%). There were no differences in prevalence between codes, or between forwards and backs (both 1.2 v 1.4; p>0.05). The most common sites of fracture were T8 (n = 23), T9 (n = 18) and T10 (n = 21). The mean (SD) lumbar spine bone mineral density Z-score was 2.7 (1.3) indicating high player bone mass in comparison with age- and sex-matched norms. We observed a high number of vertebral fractures using DXA VFA in professional rugby players of both codes. The incidence, aetiology and consequences of vertebral fractures in professional rugby players are unclear, and warrant timely, prospective investigation."
https://openalex.org/W1971460260,"Prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP), the first diagnostic marker and present therapeutic target for prostate cancer, modulates nociception at the dorsal root ganglia (DRG), but its function in the central nervous system has remained unknown. We studied expression and function of TMPAP (the transmembrane isoform of PAP) in the brain by utilizing mice deficient in TMPAP (PAPâ/â mice). Here we report that TMPAP is expressed in a subpopulation of cerebral GABAergic neurons, and mice deficient in TMPAP show multiple behavioral and neurochemical features linked to hyperdopaminergic dysregulation and altered GABAergic transmission. In addition to increased anxiety, disturbed prepulse inhibition, increased synthesis of striatal dopamine, and augmented response to amphetamine, PAP-deficient mice have enlarged lateral ventricles, reduced diazepam-induced loss of righting reflex, and increased GABAergic tone in the hippocampus. TMPAP in the mouse brain is localized presynaptically, and colocalized with SNARE-associated protein snapin, a protein involved in synaptic vesicle docking and fusion, and PAP-deficient mice display altered subcellular distribution of snapin. We have previously shown TMPAP to reside in prostatic exosomes and we propose that TMPAP is involved in the control of GABAergic tone in the brain also through exocytosis, and that PAP deficiency produces a distinct neurological phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2003030383,"Potassium-competitive acid blockers (P-CABs) are highly safe and active drugs targeting H+,K+-ATPase to cure acid-related gastric diseases. In this study, we for the first time investigate the interaction mechanism between the protonated form of P-CABs and human H+,K+-ATPase using homology modeling, molecular docking, molecular dynamics and binding free energy calculation methods. The results explain why P-CABs have higher activities with higher pKa values or at lower pH. With positive charge, the protonated forms of P-CABs have more competitive advantage to block potassium ion into luminal channel and to bind with H+,K+-ATPase via electrostatic interactions. The binding affinity of the protonated form is more favorable than that of the neutral P-CABs. In particular, Asp139 should be a very important binding site for the protonated form of P-CABs through hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions. These findings could promote the rational design of novel P-CABs."
https://openalex.org/W2071530882,"Ultraviolet (UV) B irradiation decreases blood adiponectin levels, but the mechanism is not well understood. This study investigated how UVB irradiation reduces adiponectin expression in ovarial adipose tissues. Female Hos:HR-1 hairless mice were exposed to UVB (1.6 J/cm2) irradiation and were killed 24 h later. UVB irradiation decreased the adiponectin protein level in the serum and the adiponectin mRNA level in ovarial adipose tissues. UVB irradiation also decreased the mRNA levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) Î³, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) Î±, C/EBPÎ², and fatty acid binding protein 4 (aP2) in ovarial adipose tissues. In contrast, UVB irradiation increased the mRNA levels of interleukin (IL)-6 and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 in ovarial adipose tissues. In the serum and liver, the levels of serum amyloid A (SAA), involved in PPARÎ³, C/EBPÎ±, C/EBPÎ², aP2, IL-6, and MCP-1 regulation, increased after UVB irradiation. The SAA gene is regulated by IL-1Î², IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-Î±, but only IL-6 expression increased in the liver after UVB irradiation. Additionally, in the liver, hypothalamus, and epidermis, UVB irradiation increased the expression of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), which upregulates SAA in the liver. Collectively, our results suggest that the CGRP signal induced by skin exposure to UVB transfers to the liver, possibly through the brain, and increases SAA production via IL-6 in the liver. In turn, serum SAA acts in an endocrine manner to decreases the serum adiponectin level by downregulating factors that regulate adiponectin expression in adipose tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1996599930,"Receptor-like protein tyrosine phosphatases (RPTPs) are type I transmembrane glycoproteins with N-glycans whose catalytic activities are regulated by dimerization. However, the intrinsic mechanism involved in dimerizing processes remains obscure. In this study, receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase rho (PTPRT) is identified as a novel substrate of N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferase V (GnT-V). We show that addition of Î²1,6 GlcNAc branches on PTPRT prolongs PTPRT's cell-surface retention time. GnT-V overexpression enhances galectin-3's cell-surface retention and promotes PTPRT's dimerization mediated by galectin-3. Increased dimerization subsequently reduces PTPRT's catalytic activity on the dephosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) at tyrosine residue 705 (pY705 STAT3), then the accumulated pY705 STAT3 translocates into the nucleus. Collectively, these findings provide an insight into the molecular mechanism by which GnT-V promotes cell migration, suggesting that accumulation of Î²1,6 GlcNAc branched N-glycans promotes PTPRT's dimerization and decreases its catalytic activity, resulting in enhanced cell migratory capacity."
https://openalex.org/W2036952254,"Nitrogen-responsive control of Gln3 localization is implemented through TorC1-dependent (rapamycin-responsive) and TorC1-independent (nitrogen catabolite repression-sensitive and methionine sulfoximine (Msx)-responsive) regulatory pathways. We previously demonstrated amino acid substitutions in a putative Gln3 Î±-helix(656-666), which are required for a two-hybrid Gln3-Tor1 interaction, also abolished rapamycin responsiveness of Gln3 localization and partially abrogated cytoplasmic Gln3 sequestration in cells cultured under nitrogen-repressive conditions. Here, we demonstrate these three characteristics are not inextricably linked together. A second distinct Gln3 region (Gln3(510-589)) is specifically required for rapamycin responsiveness of Gln3 localization, but not for cytoplasmic Gln3 sequestration under repressive growth conditions or relocation to the nucleus following Msx addition. Aspartate or alanine substitution mutations throughout this region uniformly abolish rapamycin responsiveness. Contained within this region is a sequence with a predicted propensity to form an Î±-helix(583-591), one side of which consists of three hydrophobic amino acids flanked by serine residues. Substitution of aspartate for even one of these serines abolishes rapamycin responsiveness and increases rapamycin resistance without affecting either of the other two Gln3 localization responses. In contrast, alanine substitutions decrease rapamycin resistance. Together, these data suggest that targets in the C-terminal portion of Gln3 required for the Gln3-Tor1 interaction, cytoplasmic Gln3 sequestration, and Gln3 responsiveness to Msx addition and growth in poor nitrogen sources are distinct from those needed for rapamycin responsiveness."
https://openalex.org/W1983684639,"Objective One of the indicators critical to the success of violence reduction programmes among female sex workers (FSWs) is the pattern of disclosure of violence. This study examines the rate of non-disclosure of violence among FSWs in India by perpetrators of violence and programme exposure. Methods Data were drawn from a cross-sectional study conducted among FSWs in 2009 across four states of India: Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu. The analytical sample included 1341 FSWs who experienced physical violence in past six months. Multilevel logistic regression stratified by state was conducted to examine predictors of non-disclosure. Results About 54% of FSWs did not disclose their experience of violence to anyone with considerable variations in the pattern of disclosure across states. Another 36% of FSWs shared the experience with NGO worker/peer. Compared to violence perpetrated by paying partners/stranger, that by non-paying partner were twice more likely to report non-disclosure (53% vs. 68%, Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR]: 1.8, 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 1.3â2.4). Similarly, FSWs who were not registered with an NGO/sex worker collective were 40% more likely to report non-disclosure of violence against those registered (58% vs. 53%, AOR: 1.4, 95% CI: 1.1â1.9). Conclusions Non-disclosure of physical violence is quite high among FSWs which can be a barrier to the success of violence reduction efforts. Immediate efforts are required to understand the reasons behind non-disclosure based on which interventions can be developed. Community collectivisation and designing gender-based interventions with the involvement of non-paying partners should be the way forward."
https://openalex.org/W2011671053,"This study assesses changes in activator and repressor modifications to histones associated with the core transcription factor genes most highly upregulated or downregulated in pancreatic Î²-cells relative to expression in an embryonic stem cell line. Epigenetic analysis of the Oct4, Utf1, Nanog and Sox2 (pluripotency) and Pdx1, Nkx6.1, Nkx2.2 and MafA (pancreatic Î²-cells) transcription factor genes in embryonic stem cells and a Î²-cell line (MIN6) showed the pluripotency genes were enriched for active (histone 3 trimethylated at lysine 4 and histone 3 acetylated at lysine 9) and depleted of repressor modifications (histone 3 trimethylated at lysine 27 and histone 3 trimethylated at lysine 9) around the transcription start site in mouse embryonic stem cells (D3), and this was reversed in MIN6 cells. The Î²-cell transcription factors were bivalently enriched for activating (histone 3 trimethylated at lysine 4) and repressor (histone 3 trimethylated at lysine 27) modifications in embryonic stem cells but were monovalent for the activator modification (histone 3 trimethylated at lysine 4) in the Î²-cells. The polycomb repressor complex 2 acts as a histone 3 lysine 27 methylase and an essential component of this complex, SUZ12, was enriched at the Î²-cell transcription factors in embryonic stem cells and was reduced MIN6. Knock-down of SUZ12 in embryonic stem cells, however, did not reduce the level of histone 3 trimethylated at lysine 27 at Î²-cell transcription factor loci or break the transcriptional repression of these genes in embryonic stem cells. This study shows the reduction in the total SUZ12 level was not a sufficient cause of the resolution of the epigenetic bivalency of Î²-cell transcription factors in embryonic stem cells."
https://openalex.org/W2043667904,"Previously we described induction of cross-reactive HIV-1 neutralizing antibody responses in rabbits using a soluble HIV-1 gp140 envelope glycoprotein (Env) in an adjuvant containing monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) and QS21 (AS02A). Here, we compared different forms of the same HIV-1 strain R2 Env for antigenic and biophysical characteristics, and in rabbits characterized the extent of B cell induction for specific antibody expression and secretion and neutralizing responses. The forms of this Env that were produced in and purified from stably transformed 293T cells included a primarily dimeric gp140, a trimeric gp140 appended to a GCN4 trimerization domain (gp140-GCN4), gp140-GCN4 with a 15 amino acid flexible linker between the gp120 and gp41 ectodomain (gp140-GCN4-L), also trimeric, and a gp140 with the flexible linker purified from cell culture supernatants as either dimer (gp140-L(D)) or monomer (gp140-L(M)). Multimeric states of the Env proteins were assessed by native gel electrophoresis and analytical ultracentrifugation. The different forms of gp140 bound broadly cross-reactive neutralizing (BCN) human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) similarly in ELISA and immunoprecipitation assays. All Envs bound CD4i mAbs in the presence and absence of sCD4, as reported for the R2 Env. Weak neutralization of some strains of HIV-1 was seen after two additional doses in AS02A. Rabbits that were given a seventh dose of gp140-GCN4-L developed BCN responses that were weak to moderate, similar to our previous report. The specificity of these responses did not appear similar to that of any of the known BCN human mAbs. Induction of spleen B cell and plasma cells producing immunoglobulins that bound trimeric gp140-GCN4-L was vigorous, based on ELISpot and flow cytometry analyses. The results demonstrate that highly purified gp140-GCN4-L trimer in adjuvant elicits BCN responses in rabbits accompanied by vigorous B cell induction."
https://openalex.org/W2053030023,"Long-term treatment with the fungal metabolite drug FTY720 (Fingolimod) was shown to be highly effective in controlling viral immunopathological lesions. However, in this report we show that the anti-inflammatory effect of FTY720 in herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) induced ocular inflammation is lost upon the discontinuation of treatment and lesions rapidly recurred. The lesions that developed after FTY720 treatment withdrawal involved mainly Th17 cells rather than Th1 cells explained in part by differential expression of surface CD103, an integrin that permits migration of effector cells to inflammatory sites. The expression of IL-6, a proinflammatory cytokine involved in the generation of Th17 cells, was found to be increased in FTY treated mice as compared to controls and this effect could be abrogated upon administration of neutralizing antibody to IL-6. Furthermore, IL-17RKO mice failed to show the recurrence of stromal keratitis (SK) lesions upon FTY720 withdrawal. These results indicate that approaches such as neutralization of proinflammatory cytokines might be considered along with FTY720 treatment if interruption of drug therapy becomes necessary."
https://openalex.org/W1977854988,"Alzheimerâs disease (AD) is the most common type of senile dementia affecting elderly people. The processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) leading to the generation of Î²-amyloid (AÎ²) peptide contributes to neurodegeneration and development of AD pathology. The endocytic trafficking pathway, which comprises of the endosomes and lysosomes, acts as an important site for AÎ² generation, and endocytic dysfunction has been linked to increased AÎ² production and loss of neurons in AD brains. Since insulin-like growth factor-II (IGF-II) receptor plays a critical role in the transport of lysosomal enzymes from the trans-Golgi network to endosomes, it is likely that the receptor may have a role in regulating AÎ² metabolism in AD pathology. However, very little is known on how altered levels of the IGF-II receptor can influence the expression/function of various molecules involved in AD pathology. To address this issue, we evaluated the expression profiles of 87 selected genes related to AD pathology in mouse fibroblast MS cells that are deficient in murine IGF-II receptor and corresponding MS9II cells overexpressing â¼500 times the human IGF-II receptors. Our results reveal that an elevation in IGF-II receptor levels alters the expression profiles of a number of genes including APP as well as enzymes regulating AÎ² production, degradation and clearance mechanisms. Additionally, it influences the expression of various lysosomal enzymes and protein kinases that are involved in AÎ² toxicity. IGF-II receptor overexpression also alters expression of several genes involved in intracellular signalling as well as cholesterol metabolism, which play a critical role in AD pathology. The altered gene profiles observed in this study closely match with the corresponding protein levels, with a few exceptions. These results, taken together, suggest that an elevation in IGF-II receptor levels can influence the expression profiles of transcripts as well as proteins that are involved in AD pathogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2083250044,"In everyday life, we regularly choose among multiple items serially such as playing music in a playlist or determining priorities in a to-do list. However, our behavioral strategy to determine the order of choice is poorly understood. Here we defined 'the sushi problem' as how we serially choose multiple items of different degrees of preference when multiple sequences are possible, and no particular order is necessarily better than another, given that all items will eventually be chosen. In the current study, participants selected seven sushi pieces sequentially at the lunch table, and we examined the relationship between eating order and preference. We found two dominant selection strategies, with one group selecting in order from most to least preferred, and the other doing the opposite, which were significantly different from patterns generated from a random strategy. Interestingly, we found that more females tended to employ the favorite-first rather than favorite-last strategy. These two choice sequences appear to reflect two opposing behavioral strategies that might provide selective advantages in their own right, while also helping to provide solutions to otherwise unconstrained problems."
https://openalex.org/W2079666530,"The gaze behaviour of riders during their approach to a jump was investigated using a mobile eye tracking device (ASL Mobile Eye). The timing, frequency and duration of fixations on the jump and the percentage of time when their point of gaze (POG) was located elsewhere were assessed. Fixations were identified when the POG remained on the jump for 100 ms or longer. The jumping skill of experienced but non-elite riders (n = 10) was assessed by means of a questionnaire. Their gaze behaviour was recorded as they completed a course of three identical jumps five times. The speed and timing of the approach was calculated. Gaze behaviour throughout the overall approach and during the last five strides before take-off was assessed following frame-by-frame analyses. Differences in relation to both round and jump number were found. Significantly longer was spent fixated on the jump during round 2, both during the overall approach and during the last five strides (p<0.05). Jump 1 was fixated on significantly earlier and more frequently than jump 2 or 3 (p<0.05). Significantly more errors were made with jump 3 than with jump 1 (p = 0.01) but there was no difference in errors made between rounds. Although no significant correlations between gaze behaviour and skill scores were found, the riders who scored higher for jumping skill tended to fixate on the jump earlier (p = 0.07), when the horse was further from the jump (p = 0.09) and their first fixation on the jump was of a longer duration (p = 0.06). Trials with elite riders are now needed to further identify sport-specific visual skills and their relationship with performance. Visual training should be included in preparation for equestrian sports participation, the positive impact of which has been clearly demonstrated in other sports."
https://openalex.org/W3021486347,"We report the characterization of three-dimensional membrane waves for migrating single and collective cells and describe their propagation using wide-field optical profiling technique with nanometer resolution. We reveal the existence of small and large membrane waves the amplitudes of which are in the range of â¼ 3-7 nm to â¼ 16-25 nm respectively, through the cell. For migrating single-cells, the amplitude of these waves is about 30 nm near the cell edge. Two or more different directions of propagation of the membrane nanowaves inside the same cell can be observed. After increasing the migration velocity by BMP-2 treatment, only one wave direction of propagation exists with an increase in the average amplitude (more than 80 nm near the cell edge). Furthermore for collective-cell migration, these membrane nanowaves are attenuated on the leader cells and poor transmission of these nanowaves to follower cells was observed. After BMP-2 treatment, the membrane nanowaves are transmitted from the leader cell to several rows of follower cells. Surprisingly, the vast majority of the observed membrane nanowaves is shared between the adjacent cells. These results give a new view on how single and collective-cells modulate their motility. This work has significant implications for the therapeutic use of BMPs for the regeneration of skin tissue."
https://openalex.org/W2075565346,"Lanthanum carbonate (LA) is an effective phosphate binder. Previous study showed the phosphate-binding potency of LA was twice that of calcium carbonate (CA). No study in which LA and CA were given at an equivalent phosphate-binding potency to rats or humans with chronic renal failure for a long period has been reported to date. The objective of this study was to compare the phosphate level in serum and urine and suppression of renal deterioration during long-term LA and CA treatment when they were given at an equivalent phosphate-binding potency in rats with adriamycin (ADR)-induced nephropathy. Rats were divided into three groups: an untreated group (ADR group), a CA-treated (ADR-CA) group and a LA-treated (ADR-LA) group. The daily oral dose of LA was 1.0 g/kg/day and CA was 2.0 g/kg/day for 24 weeks. The serum phosphate was lower in the ADR-CA or ADR-LA group than in the ADR group and significantly lower in the ADR-CA group than in the ADR group at each point, but there were no significant differences between the ADR and ADR-LA groups. The serum phosphate was also lower in the ADR-CA group than in the ADR-LA group, and there was significant difference at week 8. The urinary phosphate was significantly lower in the ADR-CA group than in the ADR or ADR-LA group at each point. The urinary phosphate was also lower in the ADR-LA group than in the ADR group at each point, and significant difference at week 8. There were no significant differences in the serum creatinine or blood urea nitrogen among the three groups. In conclusion, this study indicated the phosphate-binding potency of LA isnât twice as strong as CA, and neither LA nor CA suppressed the progression of chronic renal failure in the serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen, compared to the untreated group."
