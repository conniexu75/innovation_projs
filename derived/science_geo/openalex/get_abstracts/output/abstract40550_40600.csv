https://openalex.org/W2033942553,"Calcium/calmodulin-stimulated autophosphorylation of a prominent brain calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (Type II CaM kinase) produces dramatic changes in its enzymatic activity. These changes suggest a mechanism by which the kinase could act as a calcium-triggered molecular switch. Incorporation of 3-12 of a possible total of 30 phosphate groups per holoenzyme causes kinase activity toward exogenous substrates as well as autophosphorylation itself to become independent of calcium. Thus, kinase activity could be prolonged beyond the duration of an initial activating calcium signal. The calcium-independent autophosphorylation could further prolong the active state by opposing dephosphorylation by cellular phosphatases."

https://openalex.org/W1512516275,"Genetic and biochemical analyses indicate that the Escherichia coli dnaB replication protein functions in the propagation of replication forks in the bacterial chromosome. We have found that the dnaB protein is a DNA helicase that is capable of unwinding extensive stretches of double-stranded DNA. We constructed a partially duplex DNA substrate, containing two preformed forks of single-stranded DNA, which was used to characterize this helicase activity. The dnaB helicase depends on the presence of a hydrolyzable ribonucleoside triphosphate, is maximally stimulated by a combination of E. coli single-stranded DNA-binding protein and E. coli primase, is inhibited by antibody directed against dnaB protein, and is inhibited by prior coating of the single-stranded regions of the helicase substrate with the E. coli single-stranded DNA-binding protein. It was determined that the dnaB protein moves 5' to 3' along single-stranded DNA, apparently in a processive fashion. To invade the duplex portion of the helicase substrate, the dnaB protein requires a 3'-terminal extension of single-stranded DNA in the strand to which it is not bound. Under optimal conditions at 30 degrees C, greater than 1 kilobase pair of duplex DNA can be unwound within 30 s. Based on these findings and other available data, we propose that the dnaB protein is the primary replicative helicase of E. coli and that it actively and processively migrates along the lagging strand template, serving both to unwind the DNA duplex in advance of the leading strand and to potentiate synthesis by the bacterial primase of RNA primers for the nascent (Okazaki) fragments of the lagging strand."
https://openalex.org/W2070360831,"To test the functional consequence of phosphorylation of the EGF receptor at Thr 654 by protein kinase C, the normal Thr 654 human EGF receptor cDNA or a mutant encoding an Ala 654 were expressed in heterologous cells. In cell lines expressing both the Thr 654 and Ala 654 receptors, functional cell-surface Thr 654 receptors were reduced or were totally lost, but were not degraded, following activation of protein kinase C by phorbol esters (TPA), whereas Ala 654 receptors were unaffected. These data suggest that protein kinase C regulates ligand-independent receptor binding and internalization via phosphorylation of Thr 654 of the EGF holoreceptor. Because EGF induces internalization and degradation of the Ala 654 EGF receptor, at least two independent mechanisms can serve to signal loss of functional EGF receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1993574643,"Cleavage of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate by phospholipase C results in the production of two important second messengers: inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate and 1,2-diacylglycerol. Although several receptors promote this cleavage, the molecular details of phospholipase C activation have remained unresolved. In this study, occupancy of a Ca2+-mobilizing receptor, the oligopeptide chemoattractant receptor on human polymorphonuclear leukocyte plasma membranes, was found to lead to the activation of a guanine nucleotide regulatory (N) protein by guanosine 5'-triphosphate. The activated N protein then stimulated a polyphosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C by reducing the Ca2+ requirement for expression of this activity from superphysiological to normal intracellular concentrations. Therefore, the N protein-mediated activation of phospholipase C may be a key step in the pathway of cellular activation by chemoattractants and certain other hormones."
https://openalex.org/W2020506179,"Insulin 5'-flanking DNA contains two elements controlling cell-specific expression, one a cell-specific enhancer. We show that factors in nuclear extracts derived from an insulin-secreting cell line interact with three distinct regions within the insulin enhancer. The 5' border of the farthest upstream protected region coincides with the 5' border of the enhancer element, indicating a functional role for this interaction in insulin gene transcription. This protected region covers 46 bp, including an enhancer core sequence. This region was not protected in nuclear extracts prepared identically from two heterologous cell lines, indicating at least a 3-fold lower level of interacting factors in these cells. The size of this protected region suggests that more than one factor is binding, possibly facilitating cell-specific interaction of a binding protein with the core enhancer nucleotides. The other two protected regions were observed in extracts prepared from one or both of the heterologous cells."
https://openalex.org/W2063286219,"This report describes serologic evidence for a virus similar to that known as simian T-lymphotropic virus type III of African Green monkeys (STLV-IIIAGM) infecting apparently healthy people in Senegal, West Africa, and the isolation of virus from these individuals. Serum samples from selected healthy West African people showed unusual serologic profiles when tested with antigens of HTLV-III/LAV, the etiologic agent of AIDS, and of STLV-IIIAGM. The samples reacted strongly with all of the major viral antigens of STLV-IIIAGM but showed variable or no reactivity with the major viral antigens of HTLV-III/LAV by radioimmunoprecipitation and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A new human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV-IV) isolated from these people was grown in vitro and shown to have retroviral type particles, growth characteristics, and major viral proteins similar to those of the STLV-III and HTLV-III/LAV group of retroviruses. The gp120/160, gp32, p64, p55, p53, p24, and p15 proteins precipitated were the same size as and reactive with STLV-IIIAGM proteins. The serologic data suggest that this virus shares more common epitopes with STLV-IIIAGM than with the prototype HTLV-III/LAV that infects people in the United States and Europe. Further study of this virus and of the origin of the HTLV-III/LAV group of viruses may expand our understanding of the human AIDS virus."
https://openalex.org/W2001823184,"Early in the staged initiation of enzymatic replication of plasmids containing the unique origin of the E. coli chromosome (oriC), the plasmid is converted to a new topological form which is highly underwound, two to 15 times more than native supercoiled DNA. The underwinding reaction precedes priming of DNA synthesis and follows an initial complex formation, requiring ATP and proteins dnaA, dnaB, and dnaC; underwinding depends on the further addition of gyrase and SSB. DnaB protein as a helicase and gyrase as a topoisomerase drive the underwinding with the energy of ATP hydrolysis. The underwound template, extensively single-stranded and complexed with proteins, is an active form for priming by primase and elongation by DNA polymerase III holoenzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2020750500,"Mutagenesis of glycine 2 of p60src, the transforming protein of Rous sarcoma virus (RSV), yields a protein that is neither myristylated nor bound to cellular membranes. Although these mutant viruses retain full tyrosine protein kinase activity, they are transformation-defective. We examined in detail tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular polypeptides and the phenotype induced by infection with two such viruses. Infection failed to cause growth in agar, cytoskeletal reorganization, or changes in fibronectin synthesis and protease secretion. Strikingly, tyrosine phosphorylation of the known substrates of p60src was extensive, and differed from that found in wild-type transformed cells only quantitatively. There was no apparent correlation between the extent to which any of eight known protein substrates of p60src were phosphorylated and the phenotype of infected cells. We suggest that the phosphorylation of as yet unidentified proteins, which are probably found in cellular membranes, is essential for transformation by RSV."
https://openalex.org/W2059288217,"The genome of the human T-lymphotropic virus type III (HTLV-III/LAV) has the potential to encode at least three polypeptides in addition to those encoded by the gag, pol, and env genes. In this study, the product of the sor (short open reading frame) region, which overlaps the 3' end of the pol gene, was found to be a protein with a molecular weight of 23,000. An assay was developed for testing the ability of cloned HTLV-III proviruses to produce viruses cytopathic for T4+ lymphocytes. In the cell line used, C8166, neither the HTLV-III sor gene product nor the complete 3'-orf gene product were necessary for the replication or cytopathic effects of the HTLV-III."

https://openalex.org/W2065625428,"Atrial natriuretic factor results in diuresis in animals and humans, perhaps because atrial natriuretic factor increases renal blood flow. The possibility that this diuresis is due to direct inhibition of renal tubular epithelial water transport was examined in rabbit collecting tubules perfused in vitro. Atriopeptin III inhibition of the hydraulic conductivity response to the hormone arginine vasopressin but not to either 3′5′-cyclic adenosine monophosphate or forskolin was found. These results suggest that atriopeptin III acts proximal to cyclic adenosine monophosphate formation to directly affect vasopressin-stimulated water transport in the mammalian nephron. They also suggest a potential role for inhibition by atrial natriuretic factor of the renal response to arginine vasopressin as a contributor to a diuretic state."
https://openalex.org/W2028294424,"In a study performed to determine which regions of the human T-cell lymphotrophic virus type III (HTLV-III) may represent vaccine candidates to prevent the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acid sequence 735 to 752 of the precursor envelope glycoprotein of HTLV-III was used to immunize rabbits. The resulting rabbit antiserum to the synthetic peptide specifically recognized the precursor envelope glycoprotein (gp160) of HTLV-III. Human sera positive for antibody to HTLV-III reacted with this peptide. These findings indicate that synthetic peptides can be used to induce an immune response directed against a native envelope glycoprotein epitope of HTLV-III. The data are discussed in terms of using synthetic peptides to identify antigenic determinants involved in the induction of protective immunity and possibly as vaccine candidates against the etiologic agent of AIDS."

https://openalex.org/W2064721376,"In human right atria obtained from 21 patients during open-heart surgery, beta-adrenoceptor density [assessed by iodine-125-labeled (-)-cyanopindolol binding] and responsiveness (positive inotropic responses to isoprenaline) were linearly related to the beta-adrenoceptor density in the corresponding circulating lymphocytes. This direct relation of human myocardial and lymphocyte beta-adrenoceptor alterations, therefore, makes it possible to monitor drug- or disease-induced beta-adrenoceptor changes in tissues not easily accessible in humans."
https://openalex.org/W1479833941,"Using electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometry and the spin trap 5,5-dimethyl-1-oxide (DMPO), neutrophil free radical production in response to phorbol myristate acetate and opsonized zymosan was investigated. Using phorbol myristate acetate and zymosan (3 mg/ml), the superoxide spin-trapped adduct 2-2-dimethyl-5-hydroperoxy-1-pyrrolidinyloxyl (DMPO-OOH) and the hydroxyl spin-trapped adduct 2-2-dimethyl-5-hydroxy-1-pyrrolidinyloxyl (DMPO-OH) were detected. Only DMPO-OH was observed with zymosan (0.5 mg/ml). Hydroxyl radical production in the presence of dimethylsulfoxide (Me2SO) and DMPO yields 2,2,5-trimethyl-1-pyrrolidinyloxyl. The only 2,2-trimethyl-1-pyrrolidinyloxyl detected following neutrophil stimulation was that expected from DMPO-OOH degradation. Superoxide dismutase but not catalase inhibited generation of all three spin-trapped adducts. These data indicate that DMPO-OH arose from DMPO-OOH degradation and does not represent hydroxyl radical production. Under certain conditions DMPO-OH is the predominant spin-trapped adduct resulting from neutrophil superoxide production, perhaps due to cellular bioreduction of DMPO-OOH to DMPO-OH. Cytochalasin B, which prevents phagosome closure, inhibited zymosan-stimulated neutrophil oxygen consumption and electron paramagnetic resonance superoxide detection. No hydroxyl radical was detected. Spin trapping with DMPO appears to detect intraphagosomal free-radical formation."
https://openalex.org/W2058469411,"Transgenic mice were generated with pRSV-CAT, a chimeric gene construct containing the long terminal repeat of Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) linked to the bacterial gene encoding chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT). CAT expression, detected in adult animals of five independent strains, was preferentially directed to organs rich in tendon, bone, and muscle. This pattern reflects the disease specificity of the intact virus and suggests that the tissue tropism of RSV is determined at least in part by the presence of endogenous tissue-specific factors that can promote expression of genetic information linked to the long terminal repeat. In two of the mouse strains, insertion of the pRSV-CAT DNA resulted in developmental abnormalities. One of these strains was characterized by a dominant trait of embryonic lethality, the other by a recessive trait of fused toes in all four feet."
https://openalex.org/W2008603298,"The DNA of the HTLV-III/LAV group of retroviruses contains certain additional open reading frames that are not found in typical avian or mammalian retroviruses. The role of these sequences in encoding for gene products that may be related to pathogenesis remains to be resolved. An open reading frame whose 5' end overlaps with the pol gene, but is unrelated to the env gene, has been observed in HTLV-III/LAV and visna virus, both cytopathic mammalian retroviruses. Evidence presented here shows that this open reading frame is a bona fide coding sequence of HTLV-III/LAV and that its product, a protein with a molecular weight of 23,000, induces antibody production in the natural course of infection."
https://openalex.org/W2045789447,"The nucleotide sequence of the genome of HTLV-III, the infectious agent etiologically associated with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome, predicts a small open reading frame, termed sor, located between the pol and env genes. A DNA segment containing 82 percent of the sor region was inserted into a prokaryotic expression vector, pJL6, to determine whether sor encodes a viral protein and to gain some insight into its possible function. The bacterially synthesized sor protein reacted with sera from individuals infected with HTLV-III, indicating that sor is expressed as a protein product or products that are immunogenic in vivo. Antibodies to the purified, bacterially synthesized sor protein were found to react specifically with the same protein and also with a protein of molecular weight 23,000 (23K) in HTLV-III-infected H9 cell extracts. The 23K protein comigrated with a protein immunoprecipitated by the serum of a hemophiliac patient with antibodies to HTLV-III, suggesting that this protein is probably the sor gene product."
https://openalex.org/W2021407798,"We present evidence for the hypothesis that in multicellular structures of Dictyostelium, production of adenosine by hydrolysis of cAMP near the tip region prevents both generation of competing tips and differentiation of prespore cells near the tip, and thus establishes a ""prestalk"" region. We demonstrate that adenosine affects the immunological prespore specific staining pattern in slugs in a manner opposite to cAMP:cAMP induces an increase of prespore antigen; adenosine induces a decrease. When endogenous adenosine is removed from slugs, prespore vacuoles are synthesized throughout the prestalk region. Adenosine was found to inhibit the induction of prespore differentiation by cAMP in an apparently competitive manner. It was also found that adenosine specifically increased the amount of tissue controlled by one tip, probably by inhibiting generation of competing oscillators. Removing endogenous adenosine from slugs resulted in a decrease of tip dominance."
https://openalex.org/W1568853277,"Electron spin resonance spectroscopy has been used to monitor free radicals formed during CCl4 metabolism by perfused livers from phenobarbital-treated rats. Livers were perfused simultaneously with the spin trap phenyl N-t-butylnitrone and with either 12CCl4 or 13CCl4. Perfusate samples and CHCl3:CH3OH extracts of perfusate and liver samples were analyzed for phenyl N-t-butylnitrone radical adducts of reactive free radicals. In the organic extracts, hyperfine coupling constants and 13C isotope effects observed in the ESR spectra indicated the presence of the radical adduct of the trichloromethyl radical. Surprisingly, an additional free radical signal about two orders of magnitude more intense than that of the phenyl N-t-butylnitrone/CCl.3 radical adduct was observed in the aqueous liver perfusate. This adduct was also detected by ESR in rat urine 2 h after intragastric addition of spin trap and CCl4. This radical adduct had hyperfine coupling constants and 13C isotope effects identical with the radical adduct of the carbon dioxide anion radical (CO2-.). Analysis of the pH dependence of the coupling constants yielded a pK alpha of 2.8 for the CO2-. radical adduct formed either in the perfused liver or chemically. Carbon tetrachloride is converted into CCl.3 by cytochrome P-450 through a reductive dehalogenation. The trichloromethyl free radical reacts with oxygen to form the trichloromethyl peroxyl radical, CCl3OO., which may be converted into .COCl and then trapped. This radical adduct would hydrolyze to the carboxylic acid form, which is detected spectroscopically. Alternatively, the carbon dioxide anion free radical could form through complete dechlorination and then react with the spin trap to give the CO2-. radical adduct directly."
https://openalex.org/W2049917289,"The human metallothionein-IIA (hMT-IIA) gene contains an enhancer element within its 5′ regulatory region. This enhancer element can compete with the SV40 enhancer for one or more cellular factors in vivo. The competition between the two elements is modulated by cadmium, an inducer of hMT-IIA transcription. The data presented are consistent with a model in which heavy metal ions control the ability of the hMT-IIA enhancer to bind a positive factor, leading to increased transcription. The same factor is required for maximal activity of the SV40 enhancer, which suggests that viruses utilize factors that have a normal role in cellular gene expression to control their own genes."
https://openalex.org/W1570426544,"We have studied the effect of incubation of intact cells with insulin on insulin receptor kinase activity. Following exposure of rat adipocytes to insulin, cells were solubilized and insulin receptors purified by specific immunoprecipitation or by insulin affinity chromatography. Kinase activity of the receptors, as measured by phosphorylation of histone 2B, was then determined. Insulin treatment of the cells resulted in a 10-20-fold increase in histone kinase activity of the subsequently isolated insulin receptors. The insulin effect was half-maximal at 3 s and maximal within 15 s of exposure, was dose-dependent (EC50 = 21 ng/ml), and was rapidly reversible following dissociation of insulin from the cells. The insulin effect in intact cells on insulin receptor kinase activity could be partially reversed in vitro by dephosphorylation of the isolated receptors by alkaline phosphatase. It is proposed that: in intact cells, insulin causes alterations in insulin receptors, such that their kinase activity toward non-receptor substrates increases; increased insulin receptor kinase activity following insulin stimulation in intact cells is, at least in part, the result of an increased phosphate content of the receptors; and effects of insulin on insulin receptors in intact cells can be preserved during receptor isolation and thus can be measured in a cell-free system."
https://openalex.org/W2062722117,Measurements at various temperatures of the linking number of yeast 2 μm plasmid DNA in wild-type cells and in cells bearing mutations in the DNA topoisomerase I and II genes show that bulk 2 μm plasmid minichromosomes are maintained in a relaxed state by the combined action of topoisomerases I and II. Bulk 2 μm minichromosomes are not under torsional stress in vivo and are not substrates for a putative gyrase-like topoisomerase.
https://openalex.org/W1967425449,"The bovine leukemia virus, like the human T-cell leukemia viruses (HTLV-I and HTLV-II), are unusual biologically in that viral transcripts are not detected in tumors or infected tissues. The bovine leukemia virus long terminal repeat (BLV LTR) functions as a transcriptional promoter only in cell lines productively infected with BLV. Deletion mapping indicated that at least two regions of the LTR, on the 5' and 3' sides of the RNA start site, influenced gene expression. An analysis has now been made of the effects of coupling sequences from these LTR regions to a heterologous core promoter derived from the SV40 early promoter unit. Through the use of the transient expression of the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene to monitor transcriptional activity in vivo, two independent, regulatory elements were identified in the BLV LTR. One was present in a fragment of 75 base pairs derived from the U3 region of the LTR and behaved much like other enhancer elements. It may be a major determinant of BLV expression in productively infected cell lines, since it enhanced transcription controlled by the heterologous core promoter only in these cells. The second element was contained in a 250-bp fragment derived from LTR sequences in the R region, located downstream from the RNA start site. Its activation of CAT expression was not dependent on BLV infection and was evident only when the fragment was located immediately downstream from the RNA start site. BLV expression thus appears to be regulated in part by a cell-specific enhancer element upstream from the core promoter and a novel sequence downstream from the RNA initiation site in the viral LTR."
https://openalex.org/W2018248721,"Vegetative cells of the cyanobacterium Anabaena contain an 11 kb DNA element within the coding region of the nifD gene. This element is excised by site-specific recombination between directly repeated 11 bp sequences at each of its ends during differentiation of nitrogen-fixing cells called heterocysts. Site-specific recombination, leading to the same rejoined nifD gene, was observed during propagation in E. coli of a fragment containing the 11 kb element and flanking sequences. An assay for excision of the element in E. coli was developed, based on mini-Mu-lac transposition into the element. Since the 11 kb element lacks an origin of replication, its excision results in loss of lac and conversion of blue colony-forming cells to white on X-gal plates. Insertion and deletion mutagenesis identified a region of the element needed for excision. Mutations in this region could be complemented by a 6 kb fragment containing an open reading frame that runs counter to those of the nif genes, beginning 240 bp from the recombination site."
https://openalex.org/W1573584799,"Calium/phospholipid-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase C) was purified from bovine retinae rod outer segments (ROS). In the presence of 0.1-2 microM calcium protein kinase C binds tightly to ROS and phosphorylates rhodopsin in the absence or presence of illumination. This property of protein kinase C contrasts with that of rhodopsin kinase, which in vitro phosphorylates only bleached rhodopsin. Peptide maps of rhodopsin phosphorylated by protein kinase C or rhodopsin kinase were compared using limited Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease digestion or complete tryptic digestion. Phosphorylation sites map to serine and threonine residues on the cytoplasmic carboxylterminal domain of rhodopsin for both kinases. The functional consequence of protein kinase C phosphorylation of rhodopsin was a reduced ability to stimulate the light-dependent rhodopsin activation of [35S]guanosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate) binding to transducin, the GTP-binding regulatory protein present in ROS. Properties of the calcium-stimulated interaction of protein kinase C with membranes and in vitro phosphorylation of intrinsic proteins are discussed based upon the findings."

https://openalex.org/W1532188125,Cytochrome c oxidase was purified from mitochondria of Dictyostelium discoideum cells harvested at different phases of the vegetative stage. Comparison of the preparations by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicates that the smallest enzyme subunit present during exponential growth is replaced by a larger polypeptide component in the stationary phase. The two polypeptides are structurally and immunologically unrelated.
https://openalex.org/W1534891448,"Abstract Because of the well documented influence of thyroid hormones in the general control of oxidative metabolism and their putative role in the transcriptional activation of specific genes, changes in the levels of multiple cytochrome c mRNAs were monitored in thyroidectomized rats after administration of 3,5,3'-triiodo-L-thyronine. In contrast to normal animals where the concentration of cytochrome c mRNAs in the polyadenylated RNA fraction is approximately 4- to 5-fold higher in kidney than in liver, hypothyroid animals displayed an equivalent low level of all three mRNAs (1400, 1100, and 700 nucleotides) in both tissues. Following the establishment of chronic hyperthyroidism, the levels of the three mRNAs were coordinately elevated by about 4- to 5-fold resulting in their restoration to approximately normal amounts for kidney but to a level substantially above the normal for liver. Only modest induction of mRNA is detected in the first 12 h following a single intravenous injection of 3,5,3'-triiodo-L-thyronine. The major increase occurs between 12 and 24 h with the plateau level attained between 24 and 48 h. The magnitude of the response is in excess of the general increase in total cellular RNA mediated by the hormone. Induction of the cytochrome c mRNAs is coincident with an elevation in gene transcription of comparable magnitude detected using nascent RNA chains synthesized by isolated nuclei. The kinetics of these responses are similar to those observed for the increase in respiratory activity mediated by the hormone."
https://openalex.org/W1490330820,"The effects of extracellular ATP and/or the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) on the intracellular pH of Ehrlich ascites tumor cells were measured using both distribution of [14C]5,5-dimethyloxazolidine-2,4-dione, and the fluorescent indicator 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein. Micromolar concentrations of extracellular ATP induce a biphasic change in the intracellular pH characterized by a rapid acidification of 0.04 pH units followed by an alkalinization of 0.11 pH units. Concurrently with the alkalinization, an increase in the total cellular [Na+] from 37.5 to 45.0 mM is observed. The pH change is half-maximally activated by 0.5-2.5 microM extracellular ATP. The intracellular alkalinization, but not the initial acidification, phase requires extracellular Na+, with half-maximal alkalinization in the presence of 24-32 mM Na+, and is inhibited by amiloride. Exposure of Ehrlich ascites tumor cells to TPA alone produces a slight alkalinization of approximately 0.04 pH units. Conversely, preincubation of the cells with TPA partially inhibits the ATP-induced changes in intracellular pH. Under identical conditions TPA also inhibits the ATP-induced increase in the cytosolic [Ca2+]. The half-maximal dose for both effects is produced by 3-10 nM TPA. These data indicate that extracellular ATP triggers the activation of Na+/H+ exchange. Furthermore, activation of protein kinase C mediates at least part of the Na+/H+ exchange, although a second mechanism may also exist."
https://openalex.org/W1494785820,"A detailed study of the exchange of Fe3+ between pyrophosphate and human serum transferrin was undertaken to test the hypothesis of a generalized reaction route for exchange of Fe3+ between transferrin and chelators. The initial rate of Fe3+ transfer from pyrophosphate to apotransferrin-CO2-3 is highly sensitive to the pyrophosphate to iron ratio with a maximal rate being observed at a ratio of 3:1, consistent with the presence of slowly reactive polymeric species at ratios less than 3:1 as revealed by EPR and kinetic measurements. At a ratio of 4:1 the reaction is distinctly biphasic. The rapid first phase results in the formation of an intermediate postulated as a mixedligand complex of the type PPi-Fe3+-transferrin-CO2-3. The intermediate has a distinct EPR spectrum and an absorption spectrum similar to that of Fe3+-transferrin-CO2-3, but with a spectral maximum at 450 nm rather than 465 nm. The second phase principally arises from the slow reaction of polymeric iron-pyrophosphate with the apoprotein and has contributions from the breakdown of the intermediate formed in the first phase. The rate of formation of the intermediate shows a hyperbolic dependence on NaHCO3 and apotransferrin concentrations, the latter suggesting a rate-limiting labilization of Fe3+(PPi)3, perhaps to form species of the type Fe3+(PPi)2, prior to attack by apotransferrin-CO2-3. Multimixing stopped flow spectrophotometry was employed to test the chemical reactivity of the Fe3+ to reduction at various times during the first phase. Surprisingly, a diminution of reactivity of 1000-fold was noted after only 2% of the first phase was completed, indicating a fast initial reaction which is not observed by normal rapid flow spectrophotometry. This initial reaction may involve the binding of iron-pyrophosphate to allosteric sites on the protein. The kinetics of iron removal from Fe3+-transferrin-CO2-3 by PPi are consistent with a rate-limiting conformational change in the protein as proposed earlier."
https://openalex.org/W2024500008,"An experimental approach, which in this study was applied to the malarial system, can be used to analyze the molecular structure and organization of individual phospholipids in a wide variety of biological membranes. Electron spin resonance spectroscopy was used to investigate the structural modifications of the major red cell phospholipids that occur in erythrocyte membranes infected with the human malarial parasite, Plasmodium falciparum. These modifications were correlated with the intracellular developmental stage of the parasite. Phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylserine were increasingly disordered (fluidized) as infection progressed. This disordering occurred at different rates and to varying extents."
https://openalex.org/W1548683029,"Polyphosphate glucokinase (EC 2.7.1.63, polyphosphate glucose phosphotransferase) has been partially purified (960-fold) from Propionibacterium shermanii. Throughout the purification, the ratio of polyphosphate glucokinase activity to ATP glucokinase activity remained approximately constant at 4 to 1. It is considered that both activities are catalyzed by the same protein. The mechanism of utilization of polyphosphate by polyphosphate glucokinase was investigated using polyphosphates of limited sizes that were isolated following gel electrophoresis of commercial heterogeneous polyphosphates. The results show that with long chain polyphosphates, the reaction proceeds by a processive type mechanism, and with short polyphosphates, it is nonprocessive. The Km for polyphosphate of chain length 724 is 2 X 10(-3) microM and increases with a decrease in chain length to 3.7 X 10(-2) microM at chain length 138. Subsequently, there is a very rapid increase of Km and at chain length 30 the Km is 4.3 microM. The rapid change in Km coincides with the shift in mechanism from the processive type mechanism in which there apparently is successive phosphorylation prior to release from the enzyme to a nonprocessive process in which the polyphosphate is released from the enzyme after each transfer. During the nonprocessive process, there is preferential utilization of the longer species. The Vmax is relatively constant with shorter polyphosphates but decreases with chain lengths longer than 347. In the cell, as a consequence of the low Km, the long chain polyphosphates probably are used preferentially to phosphorylate glucose."
https://openalex.org/W1548715811,"Nuclear histone kinase activity, specifically histone H1 phosphotransferase activity, was shown to increase in synchronous Chinese hamster cells from the G1/S boundary to late G2/early M phase. Chromatin extracts purified by DEAE-Sephacel chromatography showed a cAMP-independent kinase activity that demonstrated cell cycle dependence and high specificity for histone H1 as the phosphate acceptor in the presence of [gamma-32P] ATP. This activity was purified approximately 40-fold. Using as substrates calf thymus histone H1 subfractions resolved by Bio-Rex 70 ion exchange chromatography, phosphorylation by the nuclear histone H1 kinase indicated that 32P incorporation into H1-2 was at least twice that for H1-1 and H1-3 subfractions. Both amino- and carboxy-terminal fragments generated by N-bromosuccinimide cleavage were phosphorylated. Phosphoamino acid analysis showed phosphothreonine to be approximately twice as abundant as phosphoserine. Histone H1 kinase activity was not activated by cyclic nucleotides, nor inhibited by cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitors or regulatory subunits. There was no effect on activity by Ca2+ alone or in the presence of calmodulin or diacylglycerol. Kinase activity was inhibited by nonhydrolyzable analogs of ATP such as adenyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate, by 5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyladenosine which binds to the ATP binding site of the enzyme, and by quercetin. Column fractions enriched in histone H1 kinase were labeled with 5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyl[8-14C]adenosine, and peptides were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. One band, Mr 67,000, was specifically labeled and may represent the H1 kinase catalytic subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1549142035,"Using primer extension and nuclease S1-mapping techniques we have re-examined the 5' termini of RNA transcribed from the mouse dihydrofolate reductase gene. We characterize a previously undescribed transcription initiation site at position -55 relative to the AUG codon, in addition to the previously identified start site at position -115. Differences in the 5' noncoding regions of these two transcripts with respect to their length and relative G + C content result in their differential ability to form stable hybrids with the DNA probe used in previous analyses of these transcripts and thus precluded the detection of transcripts initiated at -55. We show that changes in the temperature of the hybridization reaction result in the ability to detect the RNA having a shorter noncoding region and a lower G + C content. That position -55 represents an authentic transcription start site is confirmed by use of a DNA probe with which the two transcripts can form S1-resistant hybrids of equal stability and by primer extension analysis using an oligonucleotide primer that hybridizes near the AUG codon. These analyses also demonstrate that the transcript with a 5' end mapping near position -55 accounts for the majority of cellular dihydrofolate reductase RNA."
https://openalex.org/W1559484785,"Preparations of fibronectin purified from human plasma according to conventional methods was found to contain a latent gelatinolytic activity. The protease was activated by exposure to trypsin or electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate. Zymography of the enzyme under nonreducing conditions gave an estimated Mr of 72,000. Reducing agents destroyed the activity of the enzyme. The gelatinase co-purified with fibronectin in chromatography on Sepharoses conjugated with gelatin, arginine, and heparin but could be separated from fibronectin by gel filtration in a physiological buffer. This protease was found to be a normal constituent of plasma and was probably not derived from the blood cells since the 72-kDa protease was not detected in lysates of these cells."
https://openalex.org/W1567425766,"Previous studies described lacZ'- and cat'-'cpxA fusion genes whose expression restored to normal all the phenotypic defects associated with cpxA mutations (Albin, R., and Silverman, P. M. (1984) Mol. Gen. Genet. 197, 272-279). Here, we show by DNA nucleotide sequence analysis that the fusion genes encode 241 carboxyl-terminal amino acids of the CpxA polypeptide. Using this information, we constructed a fusion gene containing the same 241 cpxA codons preceded by 1007 codons of beta-galactosidase. The resultant hybrid polypeptide was purified and used to raise an anti-(CpxA polypeptide) antiserum. Using the antiserum, we have identified the chromsomal Escherichia coli K12 cpxA gene product as a 52-kDa polypeptide. The polypeptide showed temperature-sensitive accumulation in a strain carrying both the cpxA2[Ts] and cpxB1 alleles and accumulated to a level higher than normal in cells that carried a high-copy number, cpxA+ plasmid. Immune precipitates of in vitro transcription-translation reactions with cpxA+ plasmids as template also contained a 52-kDa polypeptide, indistinguishable in electrophoretic mobility from the immunoreactive polypeptide synthesized in vivo. Two regions of amino acid sequence at the carboxyl-terminus of the CpxA polypeptide are significantly homologous to corresponding regions of the E. coli K12 EnvZ polypeptide, an inner membrane component that, like the CpxA polypeptide, is required to maintain the protein composition of the cell envelope. The cpxA coding sequence is followed by two repetitive extragenic palindrome sequences in opposite orientation."
https://openalex.org/W1512544785,"The mechanism of synthesis of inorganic polyphosphate by polyphosphate kinase (EC 2.7.4.1) from Propionibacterium shermanii is shown to be processive. Analysis of the synthesized polyphosphate on polyacrylamide gels, which resolve on the basis of molecular weight, proves that the elongation reaction occurs without dissociation of intermediate sizes of the polymer from the enzyme. As a consequence, only high molecular weight polyphosphates are synthesized. The mechanism is processive both in the presence and absence of basic protein. It has been shown previously that basic proteins stimulate the synthesis of polyphosphate (Robinson, N.A., Goss, N.H., and Wood, H.G. (1984) Biochem. Int. 8, 757-769). In addition, using a similar method, it is shown that the reverse reaction, the utilization of polyphosphate to phosphorylate ADP, occurs by a processive mechanism. Accordingly, polyphosphates formed by polyphosphate kinase in the cell would be entirely high molecular weight."
https://openalex.org/W1544445827,"Dopamine beta-hydroxylase is inactivated by phenyl-, phenethyl-, benzyl-, and methylhydrazine, but not by hydrazine itself. With phenyl-, methyl-, and phenethylhydrazine, the rate of inactivation decreases in the presence of ascorbate and increases in the presence of tyramine. Reduction of the enzyme-bound copper occurs with all of the hydrazines tested. In the presence of the spin trap alpha-(4-pyridyl-1-oxide)-N-tert-butylnitrone the carbon-centered radicals generated from each compound are trapped. This is consistent with reduction of the enzyme-bound copper by the hydrazine-containing compounds, resulting in formation of the hydrazine cation radical. Homolytic cleavage of the carbon-nitrogen bond then generates a carbon-centered radical which reacts with the enzyme, resulting in inactivation. Inactivation with [14C]phenylhydrazine results in the incorporation of 0.94 molecule of label per enzyme subunit. Benzylhydrazine behaves as a mechanism-based inhibitor of the enzyme. Both benzyl- and phenethylhydrazine are substrates for dopamine beta-hydroxylase. The second-order rate constant for inactivation of dopamine beta-hydroxylase by benzylhydrazine in the presence of ascorbate is increased about 4-fold when the benzylic hydrogens are replaced with deuterium. The apparent Vmax shows an observed deuterium kinetic isotope effect of 13 +/- 2. The partition ratio for product formation versus inactivation is 11-fold less for alpha,alpha-d2-benzylhydrazine. These results are interpreted in terms of a model where inactivation is due to abstraction of an electron from nitrogen instead of abstraction of a hydrogen atom from the benzylic carbon."
https://openalex.org/W1511705006,"In the absence of ribosomal particles, elongation factor G (EF-G) promotes very little GTP hydrolysis. After the addition of some aliphatic alcohols to EF-G, the rate of nucleotide cleavage was significantly increased and GTPase activity was easily detectable. The highest stimulation, nearly 16-fold, occurred with 2-propanol at a 20% (v/v) concentration. The reaction showed the characteristics of an enzymatic catalysis, but the rate was three orders of magnitude lower than that of the ribosome-dependent EF-G GTPase activity. Striking similarities between the two activities indicated that the catalysis stimulated by the alcohol was due to EF-G itself. We found that EF-G GTPase activity in the presence of 2-propanol displayed an absolute specificity for GTP as in the presence of ribosomes; the two activities copurified to a constant ratio and exhibited coincident chromatographic and electrophoretic patterns; the temperature for the half-inactivation of EF-G was 59.3 degrees C for both GTPase systems, as well as the kinetic constant for the thermal inactivation process which was found to be 0.05 min-1; and the Km for the GTP in the presence of 2-propanol (59 microM) was similar to that found in the presence of ribosomes. These results indicate that the EF-G molecule carries a catalytic site for GTP hydrolysis, which in the absence of ribosomal particles is activated by an appropriate alcohol/water surrounding medium."
https://openalex.org/W1577465494,"Ellman's reagent 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) inhibits sodium- and potassium-stimulated ATPase, p-nitrophenyl phosphatase activity, and [3H]ouabain binding to lamb kidney (Na,K)-ATPase. The inactivation of [3H]ouabain binding follows pseudo-first order reaction kinetics at pH values less than or equal to 8.2. The inactivation of [3H]ouabain binding, but not of enzymatic activity, can be blocked by preincubation with ouabagenin, a rapidly reversible aglycone derivative of ouabain. The reduction in [3H]ouabain binding is due to a decrease in the number of binding sites rather than an alteration of the affinity of the enzyme for ouabain. Differential labeling at pH 8.2 with 1.0 mM 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid), preincubated with or without 5 microM ouabagenin, followed by tryptic digestion and reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography of the generated soluble peptides reveals a single peptide labeled by the sulfhydryl probe that is protected by ouabagenin. From these results it is concluded that there is a single sulfhydryl group, essential for ouabain binding, presumably located in the ouabain binding site of lamb kidney (Na,K)-ATPase."
https://openalex.org/W1589403304,"The stimulatory effect of an inward H+ gradient on the Na+-independent L-leucine uptake by the plasma membrane vesicles from Chang liver cells (Mohri, T., Mitsumoto, Y., and Ohyashiki, T. (1983) Biochem. Int. 7, 159-167) has been shown to be due to the increase of the Km value without changing the Vmax value in the transport kinetics. The uptake of leucine by the vesicles is accompanied by intravesicular acidification, and a stimulated uptake of leucine by the countertransport with a high concentration of leucine in the vesicles enhances the acidification. All of these uptakes of leucine and proton and their stimulations are amplified by imposing an inward proton gradient. These results suggest appreciably different affinities of proton for the leucine transport carrier in the inner and outer sides of the plasma membrane. A rapid decrease in the cytoplasmic pH was observed only in the first minute of incubation of intact cells with leucine in Na+-containing medium. But the leucine-dependent decrease of the cytoplasmic pH persisted longer when either Na+ in the medium was replaced by choline or amiloride was present along with Na+. Addition of amiloride to Na+-containing medium was inhibitory on the leucine uptake of cells, without effect on the early phase of glycine uptake. We conclude that Chang liver cells are provided in their plasma membrane with an amino acid-H+ cotransport system, and this is coupled to the amiloride-sensitive Na+/H+ exchange system."
https://openalex.org/W1562868490,"The conversion of cholesterol to cortisol by cultured bovine adrenal cortical cells is stimulated 6-fold by adrenocorticotropin and is limited by the movement of cholesterol to the mitochondria (DiBartolomeis, M.J., and Jefcoate, C.R. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 10159-10167). Exposure of confluent cultures to the potent environmental toxicant, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) (10(-8)M), for 24 h prior to adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) addition decreased the rate of ACTH-stimulated steroidogenesis but did not affect the basal rate. TCDD was more effective against stimulation at 10(-11) M ACTH (4-fold) than at 10(-7) M ACTH (10%), consistent with an increase in EC50 for ACTH. Stimulation of bovine adrenal cortical cells by cAMP was similarly decreased by TCDD. In both cases the effectiveness of TCDD increased with time of exposure to the stimulant. The transfer of cholesterol to mitochondria in intact cells was quantitated by means of the 2-h accumulation of mitochondrial cholesterol in the presence of aminoglutethimide, an inhibitor of cholesterol side chain cleavage. Although cholesterol accumulated in the presence of ACTH (13 to 28 micrograms/mg), pretreatment of cells with TCDD caused a decrease in mitochondrial cholesterol (13 to 8 micrograms/mg). The effect of TCDD was produced relatively rapidly (t1/2 approximately 4 h). In absence of TCDD, the mitochondria of ACTH-stimulated cells also eventually lose cholesterol (after 2 h). It is concluded that TCDD pretreatment may increase the presence of a protein(s) that cause mitochondrial cholesterol depletion when the cells are stimulated by ACTH or cAMP. TCDD-enhanced cholesterol efflux from mitochondria diminishes cholesterol side chain cleavage when mitochondrial cholesterol is sufficiently depleted (after 2-4 h)."
https://openalex.org/W1597587299,"Incubation of the complex metalloflavoprotein, assimilatory nitrate reductase with N-ethylmaleimide, or a spin-labeled analog, 4-maleimido-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinooxyl, resulted in a time-dependent inactivation of NADH:nitrate reductase and NADH: cytochrome-c reductase activity with no effect on reduced methyl viologen:nitrate reductase activity. Inactivation of the enzyme, which could be prevented by incubation in the presence of NADH, was achieved following modification of a single sulfhydryl group determined from [3H]N-ethylmaleimide incorporation and quantitation of the EPR spectrum of the spin-labeled enzyme. Sulfhydryl group modification precluded reduction of the enzyme by NADH and NAD+ binding. The EPR spectrum of the spin-labeled enzyme revealed the presence of a single species with the nitroxide retaining substantial motional freedom. Cleavage of the spin-labeled enzyme using corn-inactivating protease and separation into its flavin and molybdenum/heme domains followed by EPR spectroscopy revealed the modified sulfhydryl group to be associated with the latter fragment suggesting a close interaction of these domains in the region of the nucleotide-binding site."
https://openalex.org/W1544862082,"Abstract A cDNA library was constructed from the HUT102 cell line established from a patient with adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma and screened for cDNA clones that contain (i) cellular sequences abundantly expressed in HUT102 cells and not in the virus-negative T-cell line HUT78, and (ii) viral long terminal repeat (LTR) sequences either in the 5' end or in the 3' end. One such cDNA clone, KT1, was isolated and its nucleotide sequence was determined. It contains three regions: a KpnI repeat, a unique cellular region (UCR), and the U3 + R sequence of the human T-lymphotropic virus type I LTR. The arrangement of this clone suggests that its RNA transcript was activated by provirus integration in cis, possibly by the activity of a downstream provirus enhancer. Analysis of HUT102 DNA shows that one allele of the KT1 UCR is rearranged. The expression of the KT1 UCR is unique to HUT102. These data are consistent with the idea that the human T-lymphotropic virus type I LTR contains an enhancer which can activate upstream sequences in cis. The possible significance of this finding is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W76052703,"The chymotryptic fragment of bacteriorhodopsin, C-2 (residues 1-71), has been acetylated completely at its three lysines (residues 30, 40, and 41) by treatment with acetic anhydride. The triacetylated C-2 fragment is able to reassociate with fragment C-1 (residues 72-248) and the complex binds all-trans-retinal to form a native bacteriorhodopsin-like chromophore, which is essentially identical with that formed from fragments C-2 and C-1. Further, the kinetics and pH dependence of chromophore regeneration and the proton pumping of the reconstituted triacetylated C-2 and C-1 complex are indistinguishable from that of the unmodified C-2 and C-1 complex. However, the extent of regeneration of the chromophore from triacetylated C-2 and C-1 is less than that from fragments C-2 and C-1, suggesting that the acetylated C-2 fragment is less stable than unacetylated C-2 in the reconstitution medium. We conclude that the amino groups in Lys-30, -40, and -41 do not contribute to the stabilization of the folded bacteriorhodopsin structure and are not required for proton translocation."
https://openalex.org/W1485344276,"The Ipp gene from Proteus mirabilis was cloned onto pBR322 and expressed in Escherichia coli. The P. mirabilis lpp gene is unique in that it has two tandem promoters transcribing two mRNAs that differ in length by approximately 70 nucleotides at their 5'-ends. The two mRNAs thus encode the identical lipoprotein. The P. mirabilis prolipoprotein has a 19-amino acid signal peptide and a 59-amino acid lipoprotein sequence. In spite of the substantial differences in the amino acid sequence from the E. coli prolipoprotein, the P. mirabilis prolipoprotein is normally modified and processed in E. coli, and the resultant lipoprotein is assembled in the E. coli outer membrane as is the E. coli lipoprotein."
