With this method it is possible to compare digestion mixtures from different proteins and to detect differences as slight as the replacement of a single amino acid. Such differences are of importance in the comparison of homologous proteins from different animal and plant species, and in the study of genetically determined changes in protein structure, such as those resulting from a single gene mutation."

https://openalex.org/W1973141845,Chlorpromazine is shown to be a powerful electron donor. Observations are described supporting the assumption that the therapeutic action of this drug is connected with this property.

https://openalex.org/W2014601152,"The salivary glands of Aedes stimulans (Walker) are the source of an antigen which produces typical bite reactions in men and laboratory rabbits. If the main salivary duct is cut, the reaction is not produced when the mosquito bites. Lack of saliva does not affect the intake or movement of blood into the mid-gut, nor does it prevent the development of eggs. The presence of ain a-nesthetic component in saliva is suggested."

This reduction results from the contraction of the middle ear muscles, which lessens the pressure transmitted to the cochlea, and is not due to a direct neural inhibitory effect at the level of the first synapse of the auditory pathway."

https://openalex.org/W2015351225,A characteristic cytopathic effect was obtained with canine distemper virus (Onderstepoort strain) propagated in chick embryo fibroblast monolayer tissue culture. In limiting dilutions the lesions were focal. The titer at the 20th tissue culture passage was approximately 10(5) TCD(50)/ml. Cytopathogenicity was specifically inhibited by distemper immune serum. Minute plaques were produced under agar overlay.

https://openalex.org/W2074682475,"5-HYDROXYTRYPTAMINE is localized in the platelets of the blood, minimal amounts being found in platelet-free plasma1–3. Rauwolfia alkaloids are known to lower the content of 5-hydroxytryptamine in various tissues including blood both in vivo, and in vitro 4,5. Whether 5-hydroxytryptamine is released by Rauwolfia alkaloids from the cellular binding sites as such to the cytoplasma is still not clear. It has been stated that the incubation of rabbit platelet suspensions with reserpine in an atmosphere of nitrogen increases the amount of 5-hydroxytryptamine in plasma5."

https://openalex.org/W2080436921,"EARLIER work by Hokin1 has shown that pancreas slices actively secrete the digestive enzymes, amylase, lipase and ribonuclease, when incubated in the presence of acetylchlione and eserine. Hokin and Hokin2,3 have shown further that the stimulation of enzyme secretion was associated with a marked stimulation of the incorporation of radiophosphorus into the phospholipide fraction of pancreas slices. With acetylcholine, they found that the incorporation of radiophosphorus was increased approximately 1,000 per cent in the non-choline-containing phospholipides."

https://openalex.org/W1989058561,IN ciné micrography it has not been possible to vary the viewpoint or introduce variety by devices equivalent to ‘panning’ or ‘tracking’ in ordinary ciné photography. This limitation makes it difficult to show some aspects of a microscopical field which demand the use of a moving stage.
