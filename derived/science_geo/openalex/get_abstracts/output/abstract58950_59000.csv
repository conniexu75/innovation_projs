https://openalex.org/W2060194897,"When hemolyzates from erythrocytes of selenium-deficient rats were incubated in vitro in the presence of ascorbate or H(2)O(2), added glutathione failed to protect the hemoglobin from oxidative damage. This occurred because the erythrocytes were practically devoid of glutathione-peroxidase activity. Extensively purified preparations of glutathione peroxidase contained a large part of the (75)Se of erythrocytes labeled in vivo. Many of the nutritional effects of selenium can be explained by its role in glutathione peroxidase."

Facilitatory effects of d- and l-isomers of amphetamine on self-stimulation were assessed. The d-isomer was seven to ten times more effective than the l-isomer at the hypothalamic placement, whereas the two isomers were equipotent for substantia nigra electrodes. These data support the hypothesis that both dopaminergic and noradrenergic systems subserve positive reinforcement."
https://openalex.org/W1996196642,A relatively small proportion (17 percent) of individuals highly allergic to ragweed were found to develop marked reaginic (immunoglobulin E-mediated) skin sensitivity to a minor ragweed pollen allergen Ra5 (molecular weight 5200). Sensitivity to Ra5 was significantly associated with the possession of a major histocompatibility antigen of the HL-A7 cross-reacting group. This appears to be the first evidence of a strong association between a specific immune response and a specific group of closely related HL-A antigens in man.
https://openalex.org/W1493669367,"Abstract Nuclease-resistant chromatin fragments have been isolated on the basis of their insolubility in 0.15 m NaCl after limited digestion of calf thymus chromatin with micrococcal nuclease. Such fragments exhibit an unusual circular dichroism spectrum in the range from 260 to 300 nm, which is unlike that of B form DNA or undigested chromatin and most closely resembles that of C form DNA. Electric dichroism and sedimentation velocity measurements suggest that the DNA in these fragments is folded into a compact, perhaps superhelical, configuration. The average A258 nm: A230 nm ratio for six preparations was 1.27 ± 0.02, indicating a well defined composition of approximately 1.85 mg of protein per mg of DNA."

https://openalex.org/W1998506379,Cholesterol accumulates in the blood serum and in the liver of guinea pigs with chronic latent vitamin C deficiency. The reason for this is the decreased rate of transformation of cholesterol to bile acids in the liver of animals deficient in vitamin C. A significant direct correlation exists between the vitamin C concentration in the liver and the rate of cholesterol transformation to bile acids.
https://openalex.org/W2079515041,"Films prepared from a deformable gel (or putty) of hyaluronic acid show high crystallinity and orientation in their x-ray diffraction patterns. We have derived a probable structure for the molecules in these films. This is a double helix in which two identical, left-handed strands are antiparallel to one another. Each strand has four disaccharide residues per pitch length. Although the putty is prepared at pH 2.5, at which dilute solutions of hyaluronic have exaggerated rheological properties, the double helical form can also exist at physiological pH and therefore may be a biologically important form."

The rate of mucus release increases with the impulse activity of Retzius cells and with the concentration of their putative neurotransmitter, 5-hydroxytryptamine, to which the skin is exposed."
https://openalex.org/W2157999445,"Abstract The preliminary amino acid sequence of bovine adrenodoxin previously reported from our laboratory has been shown to be in error. In the corrected sequence, adrenodoxin contains 114 amino acid residues. The residues Asx-Glx-Leu in position 78, 79, and 80 and the aspartic acid residue in position 107 should be deleted from the previously reported sequence. The details of the primary structure determination are presented here for the first time. The amino acid sequence of adrenodoxin is compared with the structures of other iron sulfur proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2008044376,"The discovery that both potassium and sodium salts of hyaluronic acid can exist in a double-strand helical conformation that will convert to the already known single-strand helical structures illustrates the remarkable conformational versatility of this biopolymer. X-ray diffraction was used to monitor variations in molecular conformation as a function of several independent, controllable variables, such as relative humidity, temperature, and applied tension. A scheme is presented for the interrelation of a range of hyaluronate conformations."
https://openalex.org/W1988315170,"Uptake of inorganic phosphate is impared in intestinal mucosa from hemizygous males and heterozygous females with X-linked familial hypophosphatemic rickets. Considerable intrafamilial and interfamilial variation in uptake of inorganic phosphate is observed in affected patients. Uptake by normal mucosa is concentrative and energy-dependent, and is mediated by at least two systems with widely different affinities. These results lend direct support to the thesis that the primary metabolic disturbance in this disease results from impaired transport of inorganic phosphate in kidney and gut."
https://openalex.org/W1540935431,"Abstract Glycosphingolipid analyses were performed on three clonal lines of the mouse C1300 neuroblastoma (N2A, NA, and NB41A) and on three neuroblastoma X L cell hybrid lines (NLI-15A, NLI-7A, and NLI-11A) differing in teeir membrane electrical activities. Striking variations of ganglioside but not of neutral glycosphingolipid patterns were observed in the neuroblastoma lines. No differences were observed between the glycosphingolipid patterns of neuroblastoma cells (N2A) grown in suspension as undifferentiated neuroblasts or in monolayer as differentiated neurons. The neuroblastoma X L cell hybrid lines exhibited neutral glycosphingolipid patterns similar to the sum of the the parental neuroblastoma and L cell patterns, whereas their ganglioside patterns differed from those of the two parents. Despite their widely differing membrane electrical activities, the glycosphingolipid profiles of these three hybrid lines were generally similar."
https://openalex.org/W1584355208,"Abstract Studies on the aminomalonate decarboxylase of rat liver indicate that this activity is a property of cytoplasmic serine hydroxymethylase. Thus, throughout purification of the enzyme, aminomalonate decarboxylase, serine hydroxymethylase and allothreonine aldolase exhibited the same relative activities. Competition between the several substrates was observed and resolution of the enzyme by treatment with d-alanine led to loss of all three activities. Cleavage of allothreonine by the enzyme in tritiated water gave S-glycine-2-t (in accord with earlier data which indicate retention of configuration during conversion of l-serine to glycine), but decarboxylation of aminomalonate by the enzyme in tritiated water gave both S- and R-glycine-2-t. Studies with specifically carboxyl-labeled [14C]aminomalonate confirmed the conclusion that the enzyme decarboxylates this amino acid in a nonspecific manner; this result is in contrast to that previously observed with aspartate β-decarboxylase which acts on a specific carboxyl group of aminomalonate. In contrast to cytoplasmic serine hydroxymethylase, mitochondrial serine hydroxymethylase does not catalyze the aldol cleavage of allothreonine or the decarboxylation of aminomalonate; this indicates that there is a significant difference between the active sites of these enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1573772031,"Abstract The reaction catalyzed by the phosphoenolpyruvate:β-galactoside phosphotransferase system of Staphylococcus aureus was studied. The four protein components of this system were required for the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphorylation of lactose and its analogues, and the over-all reaction proceeded by an ordered sequence of phosphoryl transfer steps, each of which was studied in detail. The initial phosphoryl transfer from phosphoenolpyruvate to the phosphocarrier protein HPr was catalyzed by Enzyme I; phospho-Enzyme I appears to be an intermediate in this reaction. Only one phosphoryl group was transferred to each HPr molecule; the Keq for phospho-HPr formation was about 10. The subsequent reversible phosphoryl transfer from phospho-HPr to the sugar-specific phosphocarrier protein Factor IIIlac was entirely self-catalyzed. Since this novel reaction, shown with homogeneous HPr and Factor IIIlac, did not require any additional protein component, it appears that each protein (when phosphorylated) served as a substrate for the other. The Keq for this phosphoryl transfer is approximately 0.3. The phosphoryl groups in both phospho-carrier proteins are linked to the imidazole moieties of histidine residues, to N-1 in HPr and N-3 in Factor IIIlac. The final step, formation of galactoside 6-phosphate, was catalyzed by the membrane-bound Enzyme IIlac. Kinetic studies indicated that the reaction did not proceed by a ping-pong mechanism, but that a ternary complex was formed by the two substrates, phospho-Factor IIIlac and lactose, and Enzyme IIlac. No evidence for a phospho-Enzyme IIlac intermediate was obtained. Direct binding of lactose by Enzyme IIlac (Kd ≅ 2.5 x 10-7 m) in the absence of other components was shown."
https://openalex.org/W1485810972,"Abstract The time constant for assembly and release of polypeptide chains in the process of protein synthesis in rat liver in vivo has been determined by a new technique which is independent of most sources of variation and error in amino acid incorporation experiments. In this method the ratio of incorporation of 14C-amino acids into completed soluble proteins to that in total protein (including ribosome-bound chains) is measured as a function of short incubation periods (15 to 105 s) after hepatic portal vein injection to obtain tc, the average polypeptide chain assembly time. For normal male Long-Evans rats, ages 2 to 2½ months, tc in liver in vivo is 1.16 ± 0.16 min. Induction of hyperthyroidism by three injections of triiodothyronine (40 µg/100 g body weight) over 72 hours led to a value of tc = 0.92 ± 0.08 min, representing a 27% increase in synthetic rate. Surgically thyroidectomized rats showed a markedly longer time for polypeptide chain assembly, tc = 1.92 ± 0.22 min, corresponding to a 39% depression in protein synthetic output compared with sham-operated and normal controls of the same age. Almost complete recovery of protein synthetic rate in thyroidectomized rats was achieved by replacement doses of triiodothyronine (20 µg/100 g body weight) given daily for 2 days prior to assay. The results are discussed in relation to the mechanism of control of the protein synthetic pathway, the anabolic action of the thyroid hormones, and other methodology which has been used in attempts to estimate protein synthetic capacity."
https://openalex.org/W1515591027,"Abstract Factor IIIlac, a soluble, lactose-specific phosphocarrier protein of the Staphylococcus aureus phosphotransferase system, was purified to homogeneity. The molecular weight of the native protein was 35,000 as determined by both high and low speed equilibrium sedimentation. In concentrated guanidinium hydrochloride solutions the molecular weight as determined by similar methods as well as by analytical gel filtration was about 12,000. The results of amino acid analysis, radioactive labeling of sulfhydryl groups, and partial amino acid sequence determination were all consistent with the conclusion that Factor IIIlac contains three identical subunits. An analysis of the circular dichroic spectrum indicated that an unusually large amount of α helical structure (about 60%) was present. As shown in the succeeding paper in this series, phospho-Factor IIIlac is an intermediate in the lactose-phosphotransferase reaction sequence. Phosphorylation experiments under a wide range of conditions indicated that up to three phosphoryl groups could be transferred to Factor IIIlac, consistent with its trimeric structure. The chemical nature of phospho-Factor IIIlac was studied by several techniques. The rates of hydrolysis under different conditions, and chromatographic studies of the phosphohistidine obtained from an alkaline hydrolysate of the phospho-Factor IIIlac indicated that the three phosphoryl groups were linked to position N-3 in the imidazole ring of histidine residues."
https://openalex.org/W1580422367,"Abstract Evidence is presented for the physiological role of the phosphoenolpyruvate:lactose phosphotransferase system in the utilization of lactose by Staphylococcus aureus. The concept is that this organism takes up lactose (and other sugars) by group translocation, i.e. the sugar is phosphorylated while it traverses the cell membrane, and that the phosphotransferase system is responsible for this process. A study of mutants defective in proteins of the phosphotransferase system provided evidence to support this interpretation. Mutants lacking Enzyme I were unable to ferment variety of sugars, and could not take up methyl α-glucopyranoside (an analogue of glucose) or thiomethyl β-galactopyranoside (an analogue of lactose). Mutants defective in Enzyme IIlac or Factor IIIlac of the phosphotransferase system were also incapable of transporting thiomethyl β-galactopyranoside, but transported methyl α-glucopyranoside at normal rates. Since the mutants were derived from constitutive strain, the inability of the Enzyme IIlac (or Factor IIIlac) mutants to transport lactose or its analogues cannot be explained by lack of induction of the lactose operon. The mutants did not catalyze facilitated diffusion process, therefore indicating that the phosphotransferase system is responsible for translocation per se, and that it does not act as a sugar trap. Preliminary evidence suggests that galactose 6-phosphate is metabolized in S. aureus by conversion to galactonic acid 6-phosphate."
https://openalex.org/W1490536393,"Abstract Three isoinhibitors of trypsin have been isolated from the garden bean, Phaseolus vulgaris, in a highly purified state, as indicated by disc electrophoresis, equilibrium chromatography, and amino acid analysis. The amino acid composition is characterized by the absence of free —SH groups, high half-cystine, 14 residues, absence of tryptophan in all three, and absence of methionine in isoinhibitors, I and IIIb. Isoinhibitor I contains 74, II-77, and IIIb-81 amino acid residues. Isoinhibitor I has lysine in the reactive site, while isoinhibitor II has arginine. Isoinhibitor II is significantly displaced from the trypsin complex by 1 mm substrate, isoinhibitors I and IIIb are not. Isoinhibitors I and II inhibit α-chymotrypsin weakly (0.2 units per mg). Isoinhibitor IIIb inhibits strongly (2.87 units per mg) and has an independent site for each enzyme: trypsin and chymotrypsin."
https://openalex.org/W1564467199,"Abstract Isotopically normal and both 19F- and enriched 13C-containing analogue forms of semisynthetic ribonuclease-S' (SRNase-S') have been prepared. This noncovalent complex contains the polypeptide fragments synthetic-(1–15) (the solid phase synthesized peptide corresponding to residues 1 through 15 of bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A (RNase-A)) and RNase-S-(21–124) (the native fragment of RNase A containing residues 21 through 124). The normal SRNase-S' complex, obtained after mixing crude synthetic-(1–15) with the corresponding native fragment and subsequently fractionating on Sulfoethyl-Sephadex, was equally as active as native ribonuclease-S' (RNase-S') (which contains the NH2-terminal eicosapeptide fragment of RNase A instead of the pentadecapeptide). The analogues, containing either carbon 13-enriched phenylalanine or p-fluorophenylalanine (fluorine as naturally occurring 19F) at position 8 (the [Phe8-13C] and [pFPhe8] analogues, respectively), were purified by similar procedures to a state about equally as active enzymically as the normal complex. The normal and analogue complexes, as well as the component synthetic-(1–15) peptides and native RNase-S', were characterized, where appropriate, by either 13C or 19F proton noise-decoupled Fourier transform nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. There are several significant changes in the 13C NMR chemical shift values of the enriched carbon atoms between [Phe8-13C] synthetic-(1–15) and [Phe8-13C]SRNase-S', indicating the occurrence of changes in environment at specific phenylalanine 8 loci when SRNase-S' complex is formed from isolated fragments. Chemical shift changes for some of the enriched carbon atoms are also observed when 2'-cytidine monophosphate (2'-CMP) is added to [Phe8-13C]SRNase-S'. Additionally, the spin-lattice relaxation times (T1) for some of the en riched ring carbons have been monitored and found to decrease progressively in going through the transition of (1–15) peptide to SRNase-S' complex to complex plus 2'-CMP. The above changes in chemical shift and T1 values have been interpreted in terms of (a) formation of the phenylalanine 8-containing NH2-terminal α-helix, and concomitant introduction of the phenylalanine 8 side chain into a nonpolar, sterically rigid environment, which occur when SRNase-S' folds, and (b) localized structural changes around the phenylalanine side chain when 2'-CMP binds to the folded complex. The transitions of (1–15) peptide to SRNase-S' complex and of this complex upon addition of 2'-CMP were also observed by 19F NMR using [pFPhe8]synthetic-(1–15) and [pFPhe8]SRNase-S'."
https://openalex.org/W1559531012,"When deoxyhemoglobin is mixed simultaneously with carbon monoxide and p-mercuribenzoate, the reaction of the —SH groups at β93 with the mercurial lags behind the binding of carbon monoxide to the heme. Analysis of the data shows that intermediate compounds are formed which contain carbon monoxide but retain the low reactivity toward p-mercuribenzoate characteristic of deoxyhemoglobin. It is suggested that the rate of reaction with p-mercuribenzoate depends on the transition of the tetramer from the deoxy to the liganded form. Experiments with n-butyl isocyanide confirm that the rate of reaction with p-mercuribenzoate is not determined solely by the presence of ligand on the β chains, as suggested by Antonini and Brunori ((1969) J. Biol. Chem. 244, 3909)."
https://openalex.org/W1536545900,"Abstract Clones of sugarcane susceptible to the eyespot disease caused by Helminthosporium sacchari possess a membrane protein that binds helminthosporoside, the host-specific toxin produced by this fungus pathogen (Steiner, G. W., and Strobel, G. A. (1971) J. Biol. Chem. 246, 4350). Membrane preparations from clones resistant to the toxin do not possess binding activity. Clones that are slightly affected by the toxin, likewise possess only an intermediate amount of toxin-binding activity. That the binding of the toxin to membranes occurs in vivo in susceptible clones and not resistant ones was established by labeling experiments. Furthermore, treatment of leaves with one of any number of α-galactosides inhibits symptom expression in them after application of the toxin. These same α-galactosides also lower the amount of binding of helminthosporoside by membrane preparations. The binding protein was purified from Triton X-100-treated membrane preparations of the susceptible clone 51 NG 97. The protein has a molecular weight of about 49,000 as determined by gel electrophoresis and 45,000 by gel filtration. It consists of four subunits each with a molecular weight of about 11,700. It has a Km in the order of 10-5, at least two binding sites for helminthosporoside, and its amino acid composition and isoelectric point have been established."
https://openalex.org/W1583941645,"Changes in histones from erythroid cells of the developing chick were examined. Basic proteins extracted from erythroid nuclei from embryos 2½ to 19 days old, from newly hatched chicks, and from adult chicks were characterized by acrylamide gel electrophoresis. The same histone components are present throughout this period of development with only minor quantitative differences, except that histone V increases from a very low value to 13.5% of all histones by Day 19 of incubation and to 21% in the adult. Histone V (f2c) has been described by others as unique to nucleated red cells. No other histone component was apparently replaced by the new histone V. The increase of histone V corresponds in time to the transition from the primitive to the definitive erythroid cell line in the chick embryo and also to the terminal division of the primitive erythroid cells. Pulse-chase experiments in 5-day primitive erythroblasts with radioactive amino acids showed that histone V, and to a lesser extent histone III, were the most rapidly synthesized histones. A 2-hour chase showed these histones to be the final, stable protein product. This active synthesis of histone V appears to be temporally coordinated with the last cell division of the primitive series."
https://openalex.org/W4241601605,The development of a radioimmunoassay for serotonin is described. Serotonin is made antigenic by coupling it to bovine serum albumin. Thrombocyte-free plasma instead of serum from the immunized animals is used for radioimmunoassay. Less than 1 ng serotonin can be measured by this procedure.
https://openalex.org/W1979067720,Squid giant axon possesses a hyperpolarizing electrogenic sodium pump which is stimulated by internal sodium and by external potassium. This conclusion is based on the following observations: strophanthidin depolarizes the membrane and enhances the depolarizing effect of 5 or 10 millimolar external potassium; the magnitude of these effects is directly related to the internal sodium concentration; both effects are abolished by cyanide.
https://openalex.org/W1513238245,"Abstract Rat liver ribosomes have been acetylated both in vivo and in vitro. The in vivo acetylation of ribosomes occurred within 5 min of the administration of [3H]acetate, and 70 to 80% of the incorporated radioactivity remained in the ribosomal proteins after removal of RNA with urea-LiCl. Following treatment of the acetylated ribosomal proteins with ethanol-ether, RNase, and 0.5 m KCl, to remove possible contamination by lipids, nucleotides, and cytoplasmic proteins, respectively, the radioactivity still remained in the ribosomal proteins. However, hydrolysis of the acetylated ribosomal proteins with 6 n HCl at 110° for 18 hours released 50% of the radioactivity. These results are regarded as evidence that labile acetyl groups were incorporated into the ribosomal proteins. By using exclusion chromatography and ion exchange chromatography, two major radioactive acetyl groups were identified as N-α-acetyllysine and N-ξ-acetyllysine. Analysis of ribosomal proteins by 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis also showed that 3H-acetyl groups were present in these proteins. Giving puromycin to the animals decreased acetylation of the ribosomal proteins. In vitro experiments showed that the acetylation of liver ribosomes could be accomplished by using cell sap or a partially purified acetyltransferase. This acetylation was not inhibited by the presence of puromycin. Acetylation of ribosomal proteins was shown also in heart, kidney, and thymus."
https://openalex.org/W1541289206,"Abstract The progesterone-binding plasma protein (PBP) of the pregnant guinea pig has been purified to homogeneity. The molecular weight, 77,500 (as determined by equilibrium sedimentation and sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis), the s20,w0, 4.5, the optical extinction coefficient at 280 nm E1 mg/ml1 cm, 0.49, the pHi, 3.6 (isoelectro-focusing), the Stokes radius (47 A), and the partial specific volume (0.683) were obtained. The PBP chemical composition is characterized by a very high (48.7%) carbohydrate content. One molecule of PBP binds 1 molecule of progesterone, with an association constant Ka = 9.108 m-1 at 4° measured at equilibrium. Ka for testosterone is 1.6 107 m-1 whereas the affinity for cortisol could not be studied because it is less than 106 m-1. PBP binds with high affinity various C21 compounds among which are 5α-pregnan-3,20-dione, 20α-hydroxy-pregn-4-en-3-one, and 21-hydroxy-pregn-4-en-3,20-dione. PBP, found in the maternal plasma, is not detected in the fetus nor in the umbilical vein or arteries. PBP could not be induced in nonpregnant animals by administering large doses of estrogen or progesterone, thus raising the possibility that it is synthesized in an organ present only during pregnancy (placenta?). No protein similar to PBP was detected n pregnant rats or women."
https://openalex.org/W1654282388,"Abstract Serine hydroxymethylase catalyzes the reversible cleavage of several β-hydroxy-α-amino acids to glycine and the appropriate aldehyde. With d-alanine as substrate, the α-hydrogen is labilized and a slow transamination to pyruvate and the pyridoxamine phosphate enzyme occurs. The absolute stereochemistry of this transamination has been determined by using pyridoxamine pyruvate transaminase to analyze the pyridoxamine phosphate product of the serine hydroxymethylase transamination. These two enzymes were found to protonate the cofactor C'4 from the same face. Thus, all five pyridoxal phosphate enzymes so far examined show the same absolute stereochemistry of cofactor protonation, adding the proton from the si face of C'4, so that the labile proton occupies the pro-S position of the pyridoxamine methylene group."
https://openalex.org/W1536325684,"Abstract Bovine hepatic dihydrofolate reductase has been purified to homogeneity by traditional methods of enzyme purification. The enzyme of molecular weight 20,000 exhibited a classical double pH optimum activity profile which was altered to a single peak profile upon activation by either urea or potassium chloride. Activity was critically dependent upon the type and concentration of the buffer in which the enzyme was assayed, being relatively low in zwitterionic buffers compared to anionic or cationic buffers. Activation by urea and potassium chloride was associated with minor increases in the substrate Km values, but with a marked decrease in substrate inhibition and in the sensitivity to inhibition by a number of carbon 1 derivatives of tetrahydrofolic acid. Studies with the fluorescent hydrophobic probe, 2-p-toluidinyl-naphthalene-6-sulfonate revealed that the activation by urea, in contrast to that by potassium chloride, was associated with relatively gross conformational changes which were, initially at least, reversible, by removal of the urea."
https://openalex.org/W2055903593,The counterdiffusion of gases across a composite layer can lead to supersaturation and development of bubbles within the layer. A physicochemical model has been derived to predict the extent of such supersaturation; experiments with inert liquid layers confirm predictions. These findings explain the evolution of cutaneous lesions observed in man during simulated deep-sea dives and the cutaneous lesions and intravascular bubbles experimentally induced in pigs by exchanging certain inert gases across the skin. The phenomena associated with counterdiffusion have widespread physical and biological implications.

https://openalex.org/W1527172520,"Abstract The ATP analog, α,β-methylene-adenosine 5'-triphosphate (Ap(CH2)pp), competitively inhibits the basal as well as the glucagon- and NaF-stimulated activity of adenylate cyclase in isolated liver membrane preparations. The dissociation constant (Ki) of the inhibitor, 0.5 mm, is independent of the concentration of glucagon or NaF and is somewhat lower than the apparent Km for ATP. The phosphonic acid analog of ATP also inhibits competitively (Ki, 1.2 mm) the epinephrine-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity of membranes prepared from homogenates of isolated fat cells. The enzyme activity stimulated by NaF in these membranes is also inhibited by Ap(CH2)pp. The ADP analog, α,β-methylene-adenosine 5'-diphosphate does not significantly inhibit the activity of adenylate cyclase of liver cell membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1567205350,"Abstract The coenzyme A thioesters of cinnamic acid, cyclohexene-1-carboxylic acid, and of three halocrotonic acids are reported as new substrates of bovine liver crotonase. From the kinetic parameters of the halocrotonyl derivatives, comparisons are made with the action of fumarase on analogous halofumarates. One of the five cysteinyl residues per subunit of crotonase is shown to be unessential for catalysis, although it is hyperreactive toward a variety of sulfhydryl reagents. If this reactive sulfhydryl group is first blocked by formation of its carboxyethyl-mixed disulfide, incubation with p-bromoacetamido-trans-cinnamoyl coenzyme A results in selective alkylation of 1 of the 4 remaining cysteinyl residues per subunit. Activity loss is linearly related with alkylation of the 2nd residue, which appears to be in the vicinity of the substrate binding site. It is proposed that this second sulfhydryl group is not essential for catalysis, and that the inactivation accompanying its modification results from simple steric blockage of the substrate binding site. The covalently bound substrate analog thus appears to behave as an efficient competitive inhibitor, whose Ki is effectively zero."
https://openalex.org/W1570585960,"Abstract The kinetics of hydrogen-deuterium exchange for the four individual protected amides of alumichrome, the Al3+ analogue of ferrichrome, have been studied by proton magnetic resonance. In the range 3 l pD l 7 the exchange rates are relatively invariant. A tighter binding to the metal as the pD is raised results in a conformational stability gain, which compensates for the known base catalysis of the intrinsic amide hydrogen exchange within this pD range. The analysis of the exchange kinetic data versus temperature within the framework of the absolute reaction rate theory yields the enthalpy (ΔH†) and entropy (ΔS†) contributions to the free energy of activation (ΔF†). Depending on the particular amide, ΔH† and ΔS† appear to vary over wider ranges than does ΔF†. On the average it is found that raising the pD from ∼3 to ∼7 increases ΔH† while decreasing ΔS†. It is proposed that while conformational fluctuations are of importance at low pD, at neutrality the exchange of certain amides might proceed through a higher energy barrier without significant exposure to the solvent."

https://openalex.org/W1594470024,"The amide II band, extensively studied in secondary trans-amides but generally reported to be absent in the infrared spectra of cis-amides, has been identified at 1417 cm-1 in the cyclic cis-amide 1-methyluracil. Specific isotopic substitution (2H, 18O, 15N) provides unambiguous evidence that the mode is an N—H bending vibration extensively coupled to CO and CC stretching modes. The amide II band of poly(U) occurs at 1423 cm-1. In the two-stranded helix poly(A)·poly(U) this band exhibits a large increase in frequency (Δv = 25 cm-1) from the unperturbed value. The temperature profiles of absorbance at the frequency characteristic of either the helix or the coil are sharp sigmoid curves having the correct transition temperature for the complex. This is the first time it has been possible to use a clearly identified vibration of a hydrogen-bonded proton to monitor a polynucleotide helix-coil transition in aqueous solution."
https://openalex.org/W1525658169,"Illumination of frozen solutions (glasses) of retinal isomers at 77° K with monochromatic linearly polarized light creates stable photoproducts with a new absorption spectrum. The photoproducts are oriented since they are produced by linearly polarized light, and the illuminated samples of the retinal isomers are consequently linearly dichroic. Measurements of the linear dichroism spectra of illuminated 9-cis, 11-cis, 13-cis, and all-trans retinal show that each isomer exhibits a unique spectrum. The shape of the particular spectrum is dependent on the wave length of the illuminating light. The magnitude of the linear dichroism signal is dependent on the time of illumination. After a certain time of illumination (which is dependent on the intensity of the source), the linear dichroism signal changes very little with further illumination and the magnitude of the signal at this point is a function only of the concentration of the retinal sample. When more than one retinal isomer is present, the resulting linear dichroism signal is an algebraic summation of the component spectra produced by each isomer. This fact, together with the knowledge of the linear dichroism spectra of the pure isomers, makes it possible to determine quantitatively the components of an unknown mixture. By using a computer program to analyze the linear dichroism spectra, it was possible to determine the amount of an isomer in a retinal mixture with an average accuracy of about ±5%. The retinal isomers obtained from native and illuminated rhodopsin were investigated by this method, and it was found that native rhodopsin yields only 11-cis retinal and about 5% of oxidized material, most probably retinoic acid, while illuminated rhodopsin yields 91% of all-trans, 9% of 13-cis retinal, and the same quantity of oxidized material. The relative proportions of all-trans and 13-cis retinal obtained from rhodopsin are unaffected by the wave length of the illuminating light between 440 and 700 nm."
https://openalex.org/W1562115202,"Abstract An N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase has been found in canine respiratory tissue which catalyzes the transfer of GalNAc from UDP-GalNAc to a blood group H substance with the formation of a substance with human blood group A activity. The transfer was dependent upon Mn2+ and was stimulated several fold by Triton X-100. The optimal pH was between 5 and 6. The approximate Km values for UDP-GalNAc and the acceptor (porcine submaxillary mucin deficient in GalNAc residues at the nonreducing end of the sugar chains) were 10-5 m and 10-3 m, respectively. The enzyme was found only in the respiratory tissue of dogs whose tracheal mucus inhibited the agglutination of human red cells (type A) by human anti-A serum. In addition, mucins isolated from mucus which inhibited the agglutination had higher ratios of GalNAc to GlcNAc than those for mucins isolated from mucus which did not inhibit the hemagglutination. These studies indicate that glycoproteins with human blood group A activity are produced by canine respiratory tissue."
https://openalex.org/W1486630070,"Cellular proliferation was stimulated with isoproterenol in submaxillary glands of mice. The activities of both carbamyl-P synthetase and aspartate transcarbamylase were rapidly increased in response to isoproterenol, reaching a peak between 4 and 6 hours. The increase in activity of carbamyl-P synthetase was 2-fold, the increase in aspartate transcarbamylase was 1.5-fold. Incorporation of 14CO2 and [14C]orotate into RNA was also stimulated reaching a maximum within 2 hours. The bulk of [14C]orotate appeared in the RNA found in the nucleus. No [14C]orotate was incorporated into DNA, even if the glands were exposed to the [14C]orotate for 24 hours. The activity of uridine kinase was also stimulated by isoproterenol, although the maximum response was not obtained until 12 hours after injection. Incorporation of [14C]uridine into RNA was stimulated within 8 hours of administration of isoproterenol, but there was no significant stimulation of the label into DNA. In contrast, labeled-thymidine was incorporated into DNA after a lag of 20 to 24 hours. The isoproterenol stimulated incorporation of orotate into RNA and thymidine into DNA was significantly inhibited by the administration of 6-azauridine, whereas incorporation of uridine into RNA was not inhibited."
https://openalex.org/W1599011207,"Abstract The slow amide hydrogen-deuterium exchanges were studied in the ferrichrome analogues gallichrome, alumicrocin, alumichrysin, and alumichrome A at pD 5.14. Substitution of Ga3+ for Al3+ increased the exchange rates, presumably because of a diminished binding affinity of the peptide for the heavier metal ion. An opposite kinetic effect was found upon successive l-seryl-for-glycyl substitutions in the series alumichrome, alumicrocin, and alumichrysin. It is suggested that seryl side chain steric and solvation pressures result in pronounced effects on the peptide backbone conformational stability. Introduction of negative charge, as in alumichrome A, increased the exchange rates, presumably by shifting the parabolic rate-pD curve towards higher pD. ΔH† and ΔS† contributions to the activation free energy were calculated from Eyring plots. The magnitude of the kinetic parameters allows an estimate of the relative contributions of steric shielding and hydrogen bonding to the stability of each slow amide in the different analogues. Since these peptides have essentially identical solution conformations, this study clearly shows that it is insufficient to describe the solution conformation of a peptide without referring, at the same time, to its stability in such a conformation. The concept of conformational state is thus emphasized."

https://openalex.org/W2034647008,"The substitution of a 7-alkoxy group for the 6,7-epoxy moiety in aryl terpenoid ethers having high juvenile hormone activity has produced several compounds exceptionally active against Tenebrio molitor. The most potent compound [7-ethoxy-1-(p-ethylphenoxy)-3,7-dimethyl-2-octene, called JH-25] is active at the level of 10 picograms per insect, or about 100 times more active than other promising juvenile hormone mimics so far reported. Compound JH-25 was also active against Tribolium confusum."
https://openalex.org/W1517004020,"Abstract The lipolytic activity of bovine thyroid-stimulating hormone and its subunits have been compared to the lipolytic activity of ovine-luteinizing hormone and its subunits. When tested on white adipocytes isolated from epididymal fat pads of BALB/c mice, thyroid-stimulating hormone was a potent lipolytic agent, active at a concentration of 7 x 10-10 m. In contrast, the isolated subunits of thyroid-stimulating hormone were free of lipolytic activity from 7 x 10-10 m to 4 x 10-7 m. When recombined, 20% of the biological activity of native thyroid-stimulating hormone was regained, indicating that cooperation between the two subunits of thyroid-stimulating hormone is needed to get maximal biological activity. In white adipocytes isolated from epididymal fat pads of rats, thyroid-stimulating hormone was 7 times less active. Treatment by dexamethasone of intact or hypophysectomized rats induced an increased sensitivity to the lipolytic activity of thyroid-stimulating hormone in the adipocytes isolated from epididymal fat pads of these rats. Our data are interpreted to indicate that glucocorticoids are involved in the control of one of the components of the effector system for thyroid stimulating hormone. When the lipolytic activity of bovine- and ovine-luteinizing hormone was tested on the white adipocytes isolated from epididymal fat pads of mice, BALB/c, it was 1000 times less active in comparison with thyroid-stimulating hormone. As reported earlier (Gospodarowicz, D. (1971) Endocrinology 89, 699), all of the biological activity was concentrated in the α chain, and the β chain was free of activity. Our results tend to indicate that the lipolytic activity of luteinizing hormone may be a residual thyroid stimulating hormone activity due to the sharing of common determinants (mainly the α chain)."

https://openalex.org/W1502368967,"Abstract An enzyme which catalyzes the transamination of l-triiodothyronine and of halogenated and nitrated tyrosines has been detected in the soluble fraction of a variety of rabbit organs. Kidney and liver had the highest specific activities of this enzyme which was isolated from the latter source. The most purified fraction was enriched approximately 1,900- and 650-fold for l-triiodothyronine and 3,5-dinitro-l-tyrosine aminotransferase activities, respectively. Electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels suggested that it was about 70% pure. The molecular weight estimated by gradient centrifugation was 95,000, and a value of 48,000 was obtained by disc gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate. Activities for the transamination of 3-iodo-l-tyrosine, 3,5-diiodo-l-tyrosine, and l-thyroxine were also copurified during the isolation procedure. The apparent Michaelis constants and turnover numbers for the different substrates were: l-triiodothyronine, 0.034 mm and 1.9 moles per min per mole of enzyme; l-thyroxine, 0.2 and 1.4; 3,5-diiodo-l-tyrosine, 0.9 and 66; 3-iodo-l-tyrosine, 3.8 and 221; 3,5-dinitro-l-tyrosine, 4.4 and 2391. Transamination of either l-triiodothyronine or 3,5-dinitro-l-tyrosine was dependent upon the presence of α-ketoglutarate and of 2-mercaptoethanol. There was a partial requirement for pyridoxal phosphate. Triiodothyronine could be regenerated from its reaction product using purified aminotransferase and l-glutamate. When 3,5-dinitro-l-tyrosine was used as substrate, molar equivalents of 3,5-dinitro-p-hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid and glutamic acid were produced. The specificity of the enzyme for amino acids was markedly influenced by the α-keto acid substrate. Pyruvate or oxalacetate could replace α-ketoglutarate when l-triiodothyronine was the amino group donor, but were ineffective with 3,5-dinitro-l-tyrosine and only partially effective with the iodinated tyrosines. Thus, in the presence of these α-keto acids, the enzyme became relatively specific for l-triiodothyronine."
