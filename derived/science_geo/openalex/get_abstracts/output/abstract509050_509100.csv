https://openalex.org/W1981370160,"Candida albicans is the most common fungal pathogen in humans, and recently some studies have reported the antifungal activity of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) against some Candida species. However, ultrastructural analyses on the interaction of AgNPs with these microorganisms have not been reported. In this work we evaluated the effect of AgNPs on C. albicans, and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was found to have a fungicidal effect. The IC50 was also determined, and the use of AgNPs with fluconazole (FLC), a fungistatic drug, reduced cell proliferation. In order to understand how AgNPs interact with living cells, the ultrastructural distribution of AgNPs in this fungus was determined. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis revealed a high accumulation of AgNPs outside the cells but also smaller nanoparticles (NPs) localized throughout the cytoplasm. Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analysis confirmed the presence of intracellular silver. From our results it is assumed that AgNPs used in this study do not penetrate the cell, but instead release silver ions that infiltrate into the cell leading to the formation of NPs through reduction by organic compounds present in the cell wall and cytoplasm."
https://openalex.org/W2136589631,"The majority of current developmental models prioritise a pedagogical approach to knowledge acquisition in infancy, in which infants play a relatively passive role as recipients of information. In view of recent evidence, demonstrating that infants use pointing to express interest and solicit information from adults, we set out to test whether giving the child the leading role in deciding what information to receive leads to better learning. Sixteen-month-olds were introduced to pairs of novel objects and, once they had pointed to an object, were shown a function for either the object they had chosen, or the object they had ignored. Ten minutes later, infants replicated the functions of chosen objects significantly more than those of un-chosen objects, despite having been equally visually attentive during demonstrations on both types of objects. These results show that offering information in response to infants’ communicative gestures leads to superior learning (Experiment 1) and that this difference in performance is due to learning being facilitated when infants’ pointing was responded to, not hindered when their pointing was ignored (Experiment 2), highlighting the importance of infants’ own active engagement in acquiring information."
https://openalex.org/W1992258539,"Two subtypes of phospholipases A2 (PLA2s) with the ability to induce myonecrosis, 'Asp49' and 'Lys49' myotoxins, often coexist in viperid snake venoms. Since the latter lack catalytic activity, two different mechanisms are involved in their myotoxicity. A synergism between Asp49 and Lys49 myotoxins from Bothrops asper was previously observed in vitro, enhancing Ca2+ entry and cell death when acting together upon C2C12 myotubes. These observations are extended for the first time in vivo, by demonstrating a clear enhancement of myonecrosis by the combined action of these two toxins in mice. In addition, novel aspects of their synergism were revealed using myotubes. Proportions of Asp49 myotoxin as low as 0.1% of the Lys49 myotoxin are sufficient to enhance cytotoxicity of the latter, but not the opposite. Sublytic amounts of Asp49 myotoxin also enhanced cytotoxicity of a synthetic peptide encompassing the toxic region of Lys49 myotoxin. Asp49 myotoxin rendered myotubes more susceptible to osmotic lysis, whereas Lys49 myotoxin did not. In contrast to myotoxic Asp49 PLA2, an acidic non-toxic PLA2 from the same venom did not markedly synergize with Lys49 myotoxin, revealing a functional difference between basic and acidic PLA2 enzymes. It is suggested that Asp49 myotoxins synergize with Lys49 myotoxins by virtue of their PLA2 activity. In addition to the membrane-destabilizing effect of this activity, Asp49 myotoxins may generate anionic patches of hydrolytic reaction products, facilitating electrostatic interactions with Lys49 myotoxins. These data provide new evidence for the evolutionary adaptive value of the two subtypes of PLA2 myotoxins acting synergistically in viperid venoms."
https://openalex.org/W2033998197,"The Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway has been identified as a major, druggable regulator of melanoma. Mutational activation of BRAF is the most prevalent genetic alteration in human melanoma, resulting in constitutive melanoma hyperproliferation. A selective BRAF inhibitor showed remarkable clinical activity in patients with mutated BRAF. Unfortunately, most patients acquire resistance to the BRAF inhibitor, highlighting the urgent need for new melanoma treatment strategies. Green tea polyphenol (-)-epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate (EGCG) inhibits cell proliferation independently of BRAF inhibitor sensitivity, suggesting that increased understanding of the anti-melanoma activity of EGCG may provide a novel therapeutic target. Here, by performing functional genetic screening, we identified protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) as a critical factor in the suppression of melanoma cell proliferation. We demonstrated that tumor-overexpressed 67-kDa laminin receptor (67LR) activates PP2A through adenylate cyclase/cAMP pathway eliciting inhibitions of oncoproteins and activation of tumor suppressor Merlin. Activating 67LR/PP2A pathway leading to melanoma-specific mTOR inhibition shows strong synergy with the BRAF inhibitor PLX4720 in the drug-resistant melanoma. Moreover, SET, a potent inhibitor of PP2A, is overexpressed on malignant melanoma. Silencing of SET enhances 67LR/PP2A signaling. Collectively, activation of 67LR/PP2A signaling may thus be a novel rational strategy for melanoma-specific treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2048115310,"Responses of ecosystem carbon (C) fluxes to human disturbance and climatic warming will affect terrestrial ecosystem C storage and feedback to climate change. We conducted a manipulative experiment to investigate the effects of warming and clipping on soil respiration (Rs), ecosystem respiration (ER), net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and gross ecosystem production (GEP) in an alpine meadow in a permafrost region during two hydrologically contrasting years (2012, with 29.9% higher precipitation than the long-term mean, and 2013, with 18.9% lower precipitation than the long-tem mean). Our results showed that GEP was higher than ER, leading to a net C sink (measured by NEE) over the two growing seasons. Warming significantly stimulated ecosystem C fluxes in 2012 but did not significantly affect these fluxes in 2013. On average, the warming-induced increase in GEP (1.49 µ mol m(-2) s(-1)) was higher than in ER (0.80 µ mol m(-2) s(-1)), resulting in an increase in NEE (0.70 µ mol m(-2) s(-1)). Clipping and its interaction with warming had no significant effects on C fluxes, whereas clipping significantly reduced aboveground biomass (AGB) by 51.5 g m(-2) in 2013. These results suggest the response of C fluxes to warming and clipping depends on hydrological variations. In the wet year, the warming treatment caused a reduction in water, but increases in soil temperature and AGB contributed to the positive response of ecosystem C fluxes to warming. In the dry year, the reduction in soil moisture, caused by warming, and the reduction in AGB, caused by clipping, were compensated by higher soil temperatures in warmed plots. Our findings highlight the importance of changes in soil moisture in mediating the responses of ecosystem C fluxes to climate warming in an alpine meadow ecosystem."
https://openalex.org/W1991273164,"We aim to develop a rapid, easy-to-use, inexpensive and accurate radiation dose-assessment assay that tests easily obtained samples (e.g., blood) to triage and track radiological casualties, and to evaluate the radioprotective and therapeutic effects of radiation countermeasures. In the present study, we evaluated the interleukin (IL)-1 family of cytokines, IL-1β, IL-18 and IL-33, as well as their secondary cytokines' expression and secretion in CD2F1 mouse bone marrow (BM), spleen, thymus and serum in response to γ-radiation from sublethal to lethal doses (5, 7, 8, 9, 10, or 12 Gy) at different time points using the enzyme-linked immune sorbent assay (ELISA), immunoblotting, and cytokine antibody array. Our data identified increases of IL-1β, IL-18, and/or IL-33 in mouse thymus, spleen and BM cells after total-body irradiation (TBI). However, levels of these cytokines varied in different tissues. Interestingly, IL-18 but not IL-1β or IL-33 increased significantly (2.5-24 fold) and stably in mouse serum from day 1 after TBI up to 13 days in a radiation dose-dependent manner. We further confirmed our finding in total-body γ-irradiated nonhuman primates (NHPs) and minipigs, and demonstrated that radiation significantly enhanced IL-18 in serum from NHPs 2-4 days post-irradiation and in minipig plasma 1-3 days post-irradiation. Finally, we compared circulating IL-18 with the well known hematological radiation biomarkers lymphocyte and neutrophil counts in blood of mouse, minipigs and NHPs and demonstrated close correlations between these biomarkers in response to radiation. Our results suggest that the elevated levels of circulating IL-18 after radiation proportionally reflect radiation dose and severity of radiation injury and may be used both as a potential biomarker for triage and also to track casualties after radiological accidents as well as for therapeutic radiation exposure."

The substrate sequences it recognizes in vivo and the enzymatic mechanism behind it, however, remain to be explored. Here we characterize methylation catalyzed by a bacterially expressed GST-tagged human PRMT7 fusion protein with a broad range of peptide and protein substrates. After confirming its type III activity generating only ω-NG-monomethylarginine and its distinct substrate specificity for RXR motifs surrounded by basic residues, we performed site-directed mutagenesis studies on this enzyme, revealing that two acidic residues within the double E loop, Asp-147 and Glu-149, modulate the substrate preference. Furthermore, altering a single acidic residue, Glu-478, on the C-terminal domain to glutamine nearly abolished the activity of the enzyme. Additionally, we demonstrate that PRMT7 has unusual temperature dependence and salt tolerance. These results provide a biochemical foundation to understanding the broad biological functions of PRMT7 in health and disease.

https://openalex.org/W2027605855,"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play a key role in linking pathogen recognition with the induction of innate immunity. They have been implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory diseases, representing potential targets for prevention/treatment. Vegetable-rich diets are associated with the reduced risk of several inflammatory disorders. In the present study, based on an extensive screening of vegetable extracts for TLR-inhibiting activity in HEK293 cells co-expressing TLR with the NF-κB reporter gene, we found cabbage and onion extracts to be the richest sources of a TLR signaling inhibitor. To identify the active substances, we performed activity-guiding separation of the principal inhibitors and identified 3-methylsulfinylpropyl isothiocyanate (iberin) from the cabbage and quercetin and quercetin 4'-O-β-glucoside from the onion, among which iberin showed the most potent inhibitory effect. It was revealed that iberin specifically acted on the dimerization step of TLRs in the TLR signaling pathway. To gain insight into the inhibitory mechanism of TLR dimerization, we developed a novel probe combining an isothiocyanate-reactive group and an alkyne functionality for click chemistry and detected the probe bound to the TLRs in living cells, suggesting that iberin disrupts dimerization of the TLRs via covalent binding. Furthermore, we designed a variety of iberin analogues and found that the inhibition potency was influenced by the oxidation state of the sulfur. Modeling studies of the iberin analogues showed that the oxidation state of sulfur might influence the global shape of the isothiocyanates. These findings establish the TLR dimerization step as a target of food-derived anti-inflammatory compounds."
https://openalex.org/W2046071627,"Maintenance of adequate levels of glutathione (GSH) in the lens nucleus is critical for protection of lens proteins from the effects of oxidative stress and for lens transparency. How GSH is transported to the nucleus is unknown. We show that GSH diffuses to the nucleus from the outer cortex, where a high concentration of the anti-oxidant is established by synthesis or uptake, via the network of gap junctions. Using electrophysiological measurements, we found that channels formed by Cx46 and Cx50, the two connexin isoforms expressed in the lens, were moderately cation-selective (PNa/PCl ∼5 for Cx46 and ∼3 for Cx50). Single channel permeation of the larger GSH anion was low but detectable (PNa/PGSH ∼12 for Cx46 and ∼8 for Cx50), whereas permeation of divalent anion glutathione disulfide (GSSG) was undetectable. Measurement of GSH levels in the lenses from connexin knock-out (KO) mice indicated Cx46, and not Cx50, is necessary for transport of GSH to the core. Levels of GSH in the nucleus were markedly reduced in Cx46 KO, whereas they were unaffected by Cx50 KO. We also show that GSH delivery to the nucleus is not dependent on the lens microcirculation, which is believed to be responsible for extracellular transport of other nutrients to membrane transporters in the core. These results indicate that glutathione diffuses from cortical fiber cells to the nucleus via gap junction channels formed by Cx46. We present a model of GSH diffusion from outer cells to inner fiber cells through gap junctions.

A key initiating factor in the formation of age-related cataracts is the abrupt reduction in the levels of glutathione in the lens nucleus. GSH, a monovalent anionic tripeptide, is the principal antioxidant in the lens and maintains protein thiols in a reduced state (1Giblin F.J. Glutathione: a vital lens antioxidant.J. Ocul. Pharmacol. Ther. 2000; 16: 121-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 2Reddy V.N. Glutathione and its function in the lens–an overview.Exp. Eye Res. 1990; 50: 771-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Levels of GSH are high in the epithelium and in outer differentiating fibers where the anti-oxidant is synthesized from the amino acids cysteine, glutamate, and glycine by the enzymes γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase and glutathione synthetase (3Ganea E. Harding J.J. Glutathione-related enzymes and the eye.Curr. Eye Res. 2006; 31: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 4Rathbun W.B. Lenticular glutathione synthesis: rate-limiting factors in its regulation and decline.Curr. Eye Res. 1984; 3: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). A high ratio of GSH to GSSG here is maintained by the enzymatic action of glutathione reductase, whose activity is greatest in the outer cortex (3Ganea E. Harding J.J. Glutathione-related enzymes and the eye.Curr. Eye Res. 2006; 31: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 4Rathbun W.B. Lenticular glutathione synthesis: rate-limiting factors in its regulation and decline.Curr. Eye Res. 1984; 3: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In contrast, levels of GSH are lower in the lens nucleus (1Giblin F.J. Glutathione: a vital lens antioxidant.J. Ocul. Pharmacol.

The regional variation in GSH levels is known to worsen with age, making proteins in the lens nucleus highly susceptible to the effects of reactive oxygen species, leading to formation of protein-mixed disulfides and high molecular weight aggregates and nuclear cataracts (8Bova L.M.

The lens maintains an internal circulating current that generates a circulation of fluid (12Candia O.A. Mathias R. Gerometta R. Fluid circulation determined in the isolated bovine lens.Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2012; 53: 7087-7096Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). which brings metabolites like glucose into the lens core from the aqueous humor. The circulating current is primarily carried by sodium ions and enters the lens along the extracellular spaces between cells (13Mathias R.T. Kistler J. Donaldson P. The lens circulation.J. Membr. Biol. 2007; 216: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 14Mathias R.T. Rae J.L. Baldo G.J. Physiological properties of the normal lens.Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 21-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). After crossing the fiber cell membranes in the lens interior, it flows from cell to cell toward the surface through a gap junction-mediated pathway (13Mathias R.T. Kistler J. Donaldson P. The lens circulation.J. Membr. Biol. 2007; 216: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 14Mathias R.T. Rae J.L. Baldo G.J. Physiological properties of the normal lens.Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 21-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). The high concentration of gap junction channels at the equator causes the intracellular current to be directed to surface cells (15Baldo G.J. Mathias R.T. Spatial variations in membrane properties in the intact rat lens.Biophys. J. 1992; 63: 518-529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), where Na+/K+ pumps located in epithelial cells transport the sodium out of the lens. The circulating ionic current generates fluid flow through gap junctions. Passive gap junction-mediated intracellular fluid flow is driven by hydrostatic pressure, which is highest in lens central cells and lowest in the peripheral cells (16Gao J. Sun X. Moore L.C. White T.W. Brink P.R. Mathias R.T. Lens intracellular hydrostatic pressure is generated by the circulation of sodium and modulated by gap junction coupling.J. Gen. Physiol. 2011; 137: 507-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Solutes such as glucose are carried by extracellular water flow and are taken up into inner fiber cells by membrane glucose transporters (17Donaldson P.J. Musil L.S. Mathias R.T. Point: A critical appraisal of the lens circulation model–an experimental paradigm for understanding the maintenance of lens transparency?.Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2010; 51: 2303-2306Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Anti-oxidants such as GSH might be carried to the lens core in a similar fashion, although uptake transporters for GSH in the nucleus have not yet been identified. An alternative view is that GSH diffuses from the outer cortex to the nucleus via gap junction channels. This view was based on a study that followed the movement of 35S-labeled cysteine in the lens (18Sweeney M.H. Garland D.L. Truscott R.J. Movement of cysteine in intact monkey lenses: the major site of entry is the germinative region.Exp. Eye Res. 2003; 77: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 19Sweeney M.H. Truscott R.J. An impediment to glutathione diffusion in older normal human lenses: a possible precondition for nuclear cataract.Exp. Eye Res. 1998; 67: 587-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Movement of the label, which was incorporated into GSH, occurred in the equatorial plane along the length of fiber cells where gap junctions are abundantly expressed. A barrier to diffusion of GSH was shown to develop with age, leading to a decrease in GSH delivery to the lens core (19Sweeney M.H. Truscott R.J. An impediment to glutathione diffusion in older normal human lenses: a possible precondition for nuclear cataract.Exp. Eye Res. 1998; 67: 587-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Diffusion of anionic GSH through gap junctions is driven by the large concentration gradient from the surface to the center as well as by the relatively depolarized resting membrane potential of inner fiber cells (Vm ∼−50 mV) compared with outer fiber cells (Vm ∼−70 mV) (14Mathias R.T. Rae J.L. Baldo G.J. Physiological properties of the normal lens.Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 21-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Gap junctional coupling in fiber cells is provided by two connexin isoforms, Cx46 and Cx50 (20Gong X. Baldo G.J. Kumar N.M. Gilula N.B. Mathias R.T.

In the outer cortex, coupling is provided by both Cx46 and Cx50, with each connexin contributing roughly 50% of the total conductance (∼1 siemens/cm2), whereas in mature fiber cells the coupling conductance is dominated by Cx46 gap junctions (20Gong X.

The purpose of this study was to determine the pathway by which GSH is transported to the lens core. Diffusion of the anti-oxidant from the cortex to the nucleus is mainly dependent on the permeability of gap junctions formed by Cx46 and, to a lesser extent Cx50, to GSH. The extent to which the two lens gap junction channels allow the passage of GSH is not known. Therefore, we first examined the permeation of anions (Cl− and GSH−) through channels formed by Cx46 and Cx50 using electrophysiological measurements in exogenous expression systems. Next, we determined the influence of gap junctional permeability of GSH on the levels of the anti-oxidant in the lens core. Specifically, we measured the levels of the anti-oxidant in Cx46 and Cx50 KO mice. Finally, we examined the contribution of the lens microcirculation to the delivery of GSH. Our results indicate that Cx46-mediated intercellular diffusion of GSH from the outer cortex is a major source by which the lens nucleus receives its supply of the important anti-oxidant. Mouse neuroblastoma (N2A) cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were transiently transfected with 400 ng of Cx43, Cx46, or Cx50 cDNAs in combination with mCherry plasmid (Clontech) with Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA concentrations were measured using Nanodrop 2000 (Thermo Scientific). Cells were plated at low density onto glass coverslips. RNA was synthesized and oocytes were prepared and injected as described previously (27Srinivas M. Kronengold J. Bukauskas F.F. Bargiello T.A. Verselis V.K.

For all experiments, 1–6-month-old animals were used, as specified in the text. Animals were euthanized by CO2 inhalation; their eyes were enucleated, and the lenses were dissected. Whole lenses were dissected, weighed, and homogenized in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). In majority of experiments, lenses were separated into two fractions, with one fraction containing the epithelium and outer cortex and other containing the nucleus, and homogenized in 300 and 100 μl of PBS, respectively. Samples were centrifuged at 4 °C for 15 min at 10,000 rpm. For deproteination, equal volumes of 10% metaphosphoric acid were added to the supernatants, and samples were centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min at 10,000 rpm. GSH was measured in deproteinated supernatants using the glutathione assay kit (Cayman Chemical Co., Ann Arbor, MI) according to manufacturer's instructions.

AAH contained (in mm) 130 NaCl, 5 KCl, 5 NaHCO3, 1 CaCl2, 0.5 MgCl2, 5 glucose, 20 HEPES. artificial aqueous humor. All electrophysiological measurements were obtained using Axopatch 1D patch clamp amplifiers (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Data were acquired by using pCLAMP9.2 software (Molecular Devices, CA); analysis was performed with pCLAMP9.2 and ORIGIN 6.0 software (Microcal Software, Northampton, MA). Single channel currents were filtered at 0.5–1 kHz and sampled at 2–5 kHz. Junctional currents were measured between N2A cell pairs using the dual whole cell voltage clamp technique as described previously (30Srinivas M. Costa M. Gao Y. Fort A. Fishman G.I. Spray D.C. Voltage dependence of macroscopic and unitary currents of gap junction channels formed by mouse connexin50 expressed in rat neuroblastoma cells.J. Physiol. 1999; 517: 673-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Single channel currents were investigated in weakly coupled cell pairs (1 or 2 channels) without the use of uncoupling agents by applying voltage ramps to one cell of a pair. The solution bathing the cells contained (in mm) 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 2 CsCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 5 HEPES, 5 dextrose, 2 pyruvate, and 1 BaCl2, pH 7.4. Patch electrodes had resistances of 3–5 megohms when filled with internal solution containing (in mm) 140 NaCl, 5 EGTA, 1 CaCl2, and 10 HEPES, pH 7.2. In experiments involving ionic substitutions, NaCl was replaced by equimolar amounts of sodium salts of different anions. Pipette solutions containing NaGSH were prepared in deoxygenated distilled water (bubbled with 100% nitrogen for one h) on ice and immediately stored at −80 °C in 1-ml aliquots. Solutions were aspirated into a gas-tight Hamilton syringe before use. For reversal potential measurements of gap junction channel currents, one patch pipette solution consisted of (in mm) 150 NaGSH (or NaCl), 5 EGTA, and 5 HEPES, pH 7.3. The other patch pipette was filled with the same solution except that NaGSH (or NaCl) was reduced to 50 mm with PEG-600 added to balance osmolarity. The Ag-AgCl wire was connected to the bath via a 3 m KCl agar bridge. The pipette Ag-AgCl wire was connected to a 3 m KCl-containing agar bridge (3% agarose) inside the pipette holder. Amplifier offsets were nulled with the tips of the pipettes in a stream of 1 m KCl solution to minimize the liquid junction potentials between the different pipette solutions and the bath solution. After correcting the offset, whole cell recordings of cell pairs were obtained to measure junctional currents. Voltage ramps from −100 to +100 mV were applied to one cell of a pair, and the junctional current was recorded from the second cell. Reversal potentials were measured by applying voltage ramps to one cell of a pair. All measurements were done in weakly coupled cell pairs (<1 nS) to ensure that gradients do not collapse due to mixing of pipette solutions between coupled cells. The baseline membrane currents for each cell were measured by manually separating cells at the end of the recording and were subtracted from the junctional current. Activity coefficients were used in the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation for calculation of permeability ratios of anions relative to Na+ (PNa/Panion) from the changes in the reversal potential, Erev. The permeability ratios for GSH were calculated by assuming that it has the same activity coefficient as Cl−. Reversal potentials of single Cx46 and Cx50 hemichannel currents in Xenopus oocytes were obtained by exposing excised inside-out patches to 4:1 salt gradients. The pipette solution contained 100 NaGSH (or 100 NaCl), 5 EGTA, 1 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, and 5 HEPES, pH 8.0. The bath contained the same solution, except that NaGSH (or NaCl) was increased to 400 mm in some experiments. All other experimental procedures, including correction of liquid junction potentials and calculation of permeability ratios, were performed as described above. For a large aqueous pore such as those formed by connexin channels, unitary conductance is dependent on the aqueous mobility of the ion, assuming that the movement of ions in the channel is independent (31Wang H.Z. Veenstra R.D. Monovalent ion selectivity sequences of the rat connexin43 gap junction channel.J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 491-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). To obtain a qualitative estimate of anionic flux through gap junctions formed by Cx46 and Cx50, we measured single channel conductances with patch pipettes containing 140 mm sodium salts of chloride, glutamate, ascorbate, and GSH anions. The aqueous mobilities of these anions follows the sequence chloride > glutamate > ascorbate > GSH. The effect of replacement of Cl− with larger anions on the single channel conductance of gap junctions formed by Cx43 was also measured in comparison, as it is known to form nonselective channels (31Wang H.Z.

Single channel current voltage relations for Cx43, Cx46, and Cx50 gap junctions in different sodium salts were generated by application of voltage ramps between −100 to +100 mV to one cell of a pair. Fig. 1A shows a representative recording from a Cx50-expressing cell pair in NaCl and NaGSH. Replacement of Cl− with GSH did not affect channel gating or the open and closed time distributions (data not shown). Equimolar replacement of Cl− with progressively larger anions caused a decrease in unitary conductance of Cx43, Cx46, and Cx50 gap junction channels (Table 1). However, as shown in Fig. 1B, the magnitudes of decrease in single channel conductance were dependent on the connexin subtype. Replacement of Cl− with glutamate and GSH reduced conductance of Cx43 gap junction channels by ∼ 40 and 60%, respectively (Fig. 1B). In contrast, the single channel conductance of Cx46 and Cx50 channels changed by only 7 and 15%, respectively, when patch pipettes contained sodium glutamate instead of NaCl. Similarly, replacement of Cl− with GSH reduced the unitary conductance of Cx46 and Cx50 channels by only 14 and 32%, respectively (Table 1). These results suggest that the conductance in Cx46 is dominated by cations, whereas in Cx43 it is provided by both anions and cations. Cx50 channels also appear to display a higher selectivity for cations although to a lower extent compared with Cx46.TABLE 1Single channel conductances of Cx43, Cx46, and Cx50 measured with patch pipettes containing 140 mm of sodium saltsSodium saltCx43Cx46Cx50Cl−89.7 ± 1.694.9 ± 2.3144.1 ± 1.9Glutamate−57.1 ± 3.186.5 ± 3.3125.2 ± 4.4Ascorbate−49.3 ± 0.781.7 ± 2.3111.1 ± 2.4GSH−36.2 ± 1.167.5 ± 1.995.7 ± 1.7 Open table in a new tab We measured reversal potentials in single salt gradients to obtain a more precise estimate of anionic permeability of channels formed by Cx46 and Cx50. Anionic permeability of both unopposed hemichannels and gap junction channels formed by Cx46 and Cx50 was measured. The permeabilities of chloride and the larger GSH anion relative to Na+ are shown in FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3, respectively. Fig. 2 shows single hemichannel currents from Cx46- and Cx50-expressing oocytes in symmetric and asymmetric NaCl solutions in the bath and pipette. Single hemichannel current-voltage relations were obtained from excised patches in response to voltage ramps from −70 to +70 mV. In symmetric 100 mm NaCl solutions, Cx46 and Cx50 hemichannel currents reversed at 0 mV (Fig. 2A). Replacement of 100 mm NaCl in the solution bathing the extracellular face of hemichannels with 400 mm NaCl shifted reversal potentials toward the Na+ equilibrium potential (Fig. 2B). In the illustrated recordings, reversal potentials in 4:1 gradients were found to be +20 mV for Cx46 and +16 mV for Cx50. Using reversal potentials from multiple patches and the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz voltage equation, the PNa/PCl values were calculated to be ∼5 and ∼3.3 for Cx46 and Cx50 hemichannels, respectively (Fig. 2C), indicating a preference of both connexin channel subtypes to cations. In addition, the presence of a higher concentration of salt on the extracellular side of the hemichannels changed the rectification of the I-V curves. In symmetrical salts, the Cx46 and Cx50 I-V relations display a nearly 2:1 inward rectification over the ±70-mV range of the membrane potential, which has been attributed to the presence of fixed negative charges located toward the extracellular end of the hemichannel pore (32Trexler E.B.

In asymmetric NaCl gradients, the rectification was increased significantly due to the higher Na+ concentration on the extracellular face of the hemichannel.FIGURE 2Cx46 and Cx50 form cation-preferring channels. A and B, single channel current-voltage relations for Cx46 (left) and Cx50 (right) hemichannels in symmetric NaCl solutions (A) or 100:400 asymmetric NaCl solutions (B). Cx46 and Cx50 hemichannel currents were recorded from excised inside-out patches in response to 8-s voltage ramps applied between −70 and +70 mV. In symmetric NaCl solutions, Cx46 and Cx50 currents show inward rectification and reversed polarity at 0 mV. In asymmetric NaCl solutions, reversal potentials for Cx46 and Cx50 hemichannel currents are shifted toward the equilibrium potential for Na+, indicating a lower permeability to Cl− relative to Na+. Inward rectification of the currents also increased in asymmetric solutions, consistent with the presence of higher Na+ concentration on the extracellular side. C, permeability ratios (PNa/PCl) of hemichannels (left) and gap junction channels (right) formed by connexins expressed in the lens. PNa/PCl values for hemichannels and gap junction channels were calculated from reversal potentials in asymmetric 4:1 and 3:1 NaCl gradients, respectively.

Values represent the means ± S.E. from multiple recordings.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The charge selectivity of Cx46 and Cx50 cell-cell channels was similar to that of unopposed hemichannels, indicating that rearrangements that occur with docking do not influence the properties of the pore (Fig. 2C). Charge selectivity of Cx46 and Cx50 gap junction channels was determined from measurements of reversal potentials of junctional currents with patch pipettes that contained different salt solutions on each side of the junction (150 mm NaCl in one pipette and 50 mm NaCl in the second pipette). Selectivity of Cx43 gap junctions was also measured for comparison. Erev values of Cx46 and Cx50 junctional currents were +17 and +12 mV, respectively, yielding PNa/PCl values of 5:1 for Cx46 (n = 3) and 3:1 for Cx50 (n = 4) (Fig. 2C). The PNa/PCl value for Cx46 gap junctions is in agreement with the PK/PCl value of ∼8 found by Trexler et al. (32Trexler E.B. Bukauskas F.F. Kronengold J. Bargiello T.A. Verselis V.K.

The OpenMalaria stochastic simulation modeling platform can be applied to simulate the impact of interventions singly and in combination as implemented in Rachuonyo South District, western Kenya, to support this goal.Combinations of malaria interventions were simulated using a previously-published, validated model of malaria epidemiology and control in the study area. An economic model of the costs of case management and malaria control interventions in Kenya was applied to simulation results and cost-effectiveness of each intervention combination compared to the corresponding simulated outputs of a scenario without interventions. Uncertainty was evaluated by varying health system and intervention delivery parameters.The intervention strategy with the greatest simulated health impact employed long lasting insecticide treated net (LLIN) use by 80% of the population, 90% of households covered by indoor residual spraying (IRS) with deployment starting in April, and intermittent screen and treat (IST) of school children using Artemether lumefantrine (AL) with 80% coverage twice per term. However, the current malaria control strategy in the study area including LLIN use of 56% and IRS coverage of 70% was the most cost effective at reducing disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) over a five year period.All the simulated intervention combinations can be considered cost effective in the context of available resources for health in Kenya. Increasing coverage of vector control interventions has a larger simulated impact compared to adding IST to the current implementation strategy, suggesting that transmission in the study area is not at a level to warrant replacing vector control to a school-based screen and treat program. These results have the potential to assist malaria control program managers in the study area in adding new or changing implementation of current interventions."

Here, we performed transcriptional and metabolic profiling for yeast at early stages of senescence (4th, 7th, and 11th generation), that is, for populations in which most cells are still alive. Transcriptional profiles showed up- and down-regulation for ∼20% of the genes profiled after the first four generations, few further changes by the 7th generation, and an additional 12% of the genes were up- and down-regulated after 11 generations. Pathway analysis revealed that these 11th generation cells had accumulated transcripts coding for enzymes involved in sugar metabolism, the TCA cycle, and amino acid degradation and showed decreased levels of mRNAs coding for enzymes involved in amino acid biosynthetic pathways. These observations were consistent with the metabolomic profiles of aging cells: an accumulation of pyruvic acid and TCA cycle intermediates and depletion of most amino acids, especially branched-chain amino acids. Stationary phase-induced genes were highly expressed after 11 generations even though the growth medium contained adequate levels of nutrients, indicating deterioration of the nutrient sensing and/or signaling pathways by the 11th generation.

Here, to facilitate the study of early processes of retinal regeneration, we provide a de novo assembly transcriptome and inferred proteome of the Japanese fire bellied newt (Cynops pyrrhogaster), which was obtained from eyeball samples of day 0–14 after surgical removal of the lens and neural retina. This transcriptome (237,120 in silico transcripts) contains most information of cDNAs/ESTs which has been reported in newts (C. pyrrhogaster, Pleurodeles waltl and Notophthalmus viridescence) thus far. On the other hand, de novo assembly transcriptomes reported lately for N. viridescence only covered 16–31% of this transcriptome, suggesting that most constituents of this transcriptome are specific to the regenerating eye tissues of C. pyrrhogaster. A total of 87,102 in silico transcripts of this transcriptome were functionally annotated. Coding sequence prediction in combination with functional annotation revealed that 76,968 in silico transcripts encode protein/peptides recorded in public databases so far, whereas 17,316 might be unique. qPCR and Sanger sequencing demonstrated that this transcriptome contains much information pertaining to genes that are regulated in association with cell reprogramming, cell-cycle re-entry/proliferation, and tissue patterning in an early phase of retinal regeneration. This data also provides important insight for further investigations addressing cellular mechanisms and molecular networks underlying retinal regeneration as well as differences between retinal regeneration and disorders. This transcriptome can be applied to ensuing comprehensive gene screening steps, providing candidate genes, regardless of whether annotated or unique, to uncover essential mechanisms underlying early processes of retinal regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2171417888,"Mammary fat is the main composition of breast, and is the most probable candidate to affect tumor behavior because the fat produces hormones, growth factors and adipokines, a heterogeneous group of signaling molecules. Gene expression profiling and functional characterization of mammary fat in Chinese women has not been reported. Thus, we collected the mammary fat tissues adjacent to breast tumors from 60 subjects, among which 30 subjects had breast cancer and 30 had benign lesions. We isolated and cultured the stromal vascular cell fraction from mammary fat. The expression of genes related to adipose function (including adipogenesis and secretion) was detected at both the tissue and the cellular level. We also studied mammary fat browning. The results indicated that fat tissue close to malignant and benign lesions exhibited distinctive gene expression profiles and functional characteristics. Although the mammary fat of breast tumors atrophied, it secreted tumor growth stimulatory factors. Browning of mammary fat was observed and browning activity of fat close to malignant breast tumors was greater than that close to benign lesions. Understanding the diversity between these two fat depots may possibly help us improve our understanding of breast cancer pathogenesis and find the key to unlock new anticancer therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2000392610,"Placental inflammatory response (PIR) is associated with adverse neonatal outcomes such as sepsis, cerebral palsy, low birth weight, preterm birth, and neonatal mortality. However, there is an urgent need for noninvasive and sensitive biomarkers for prediction of PIR. In this study, we evaluated the clinical usefulness of maternal serum inflammatory markers for prediction of PIR in women with impending preterm birth. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 483 patients who delivered preterm neonates. Serum levels of leukocyte differential counts, C-reactive protein (CRP), and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were compared between women with no placental inflammation and women with PIR. The mean neutrophil counts, CRP levels, and NLR in both the patients with histologic chorioamnionitis (HCA) alone and those with HCA with funisitis were significantly higher than those in women with no placental inflammation. Compared to leukocyte subset or CRP, NLR in women with funisitis was significantly higher than in women with HCA alone and showed higher predictive accuracy, along with 71.4% sensitivity, 77.9% specificity, 80.7% positive predictive value, and 67.8% negative predictive value for prediction of PIR. On Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, women with both an elevated level of CRP and a high NLR had a shorter admission-to-delivery interval compared to women with either an elevated level of CRP or a high NLR alone. NLR may be a predictive marker of PIR and could be used as a cost-effective parameter for identifying women at risk of PIR."
https://openalex.org/W1999352898,"Human lymphocyte antigen B-associated transcript 5 (BAT5, also known as ABHD16A) is a poorly characterized 63 kDa protein belonging to the α/β-hydrolase domain (ABHD) containing family of metabolic serine hydrolases. Its natural substrates and biochemical properties are unknown.Amino acid sequence comparison between seven mammalian BAT5 orthologs revealed that the overall primary structure was highly (≥95%) conserved. Activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) confirmed successful generation of catalytically active human (h) and mouse (m) BAT5 in HEK293 cells, enabling further biochemical characterization. A sensitive fluorescent glycerol assay reported hBAT5-mediated hydrolysis of medium-chain saturated (C14:0), long-chain unsaturated (C18:1, C18:2, C20:4) monoacylglycerols (MAGs) and 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2-2-glycerol ester (15d-PGJ2-G). In contrast, hBAT5 possessed only marginal diacylglycerol (DAG), triacylglycerol (TAG), or lysophospholipase activity. The best MAG substrates were 1-linoleylglycerol (1-LG) and 15d-PGJ2-G, both exhibiting low-micromolar Km values. BAT5 had a neutral pH optimum and showed preference for the 1(3)- vs. 2-isomers of MAGs C18:1, C18:2 and C20:4. Inhibitor profiling revealed that β-lactone-based lipase inhibitors were nanomolar inhibitors of hBAT5 activity (palmostatin B > tetrahydrolipstatin > ebelactone A). Moreover, the hormone-sensitive lipase inhibitor C7600 (5-methoxy-3-(4-phenoxyphenyl)-3H-[1], [3], [4]oxadiazol-2-one) was identified as a highly potent inhibitor (IC50 8.3 nM). Phenyl and benzyl substituted analogs of C7600 with increased BAT5 selectivity were synthesized and a preliminary SAR analysis was conducted to obtain initial insights into the active site dimensions.This study provides an initial characterization of BAT5 activity, unveiling the biochemical and pharmacological properties with in vitro substrate preferences and inhibitor profiles. Utilization of glycerolipid substrates and sensitivity to lipase inhibitors suggest that BAT5 is a genuine lipase with preference for long-chain unsaturated MAGs and could in this capacity regulate glycerolipid metabolism in vivo as well. This preliminary SAR data should pave the way towards increasingly potent and BAT5-selective inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2042904600,"Trichodysplasia spinulosa (TS) is a proliferative skin disease observed in severely immunocompromized patients. It is characterized by papule and trichohyalin-rich spicule formation, epidermal acanthosis and distention of dysmorphic hair follicles overpopulated by inner root sheath cells (IRS). TS probably results from active infection with the TS-associated polyomavirus (TSPyV), as indicated by high viral-load, virus protein expression and particle formation. The underlying pathogenic mechanism imposed by TSPyV infection has not been solved yet. By analogy with other polyomaviruses, such as the Merkel cell polyomavirus associated with Merkel cell carcinoma, we hypothesized that TSPyV T-antigen promotes proliferation of infected IRS cells. Therefore, we analyzed TS biopsy sections for markers of cell proliferation (Ki-67) and cell cycle regulation (p16ink4a, p21waf, pRB, phosphorylated pRB), and the putatively transforming TSPyV early large tumor (LT) antigen. Intense Ki-67 staining was detected especially in the margins of TS hair follicles, which colocalized with TSPyV LT-antigen detection. In this area, staining was also noted for pRB and particularly phosphorylated pRB, as well as p16ink4a and p21waf. Healthy control hair follicles did not or hardly stained for these markers. Trichohyalin was particularly detected in the center of TS follicles that stained negative for Ki-67 and TSPyV LT-antigen. In summary, we provide evidence for clustering of TSPyV LT-antigen-expressing and proliferating cells in the follicle margins that overproduce negative cell cycle regulatory proteins. These data are compatible with a scenario of TSPyV T-antigen-mediated cell cycle progression, potentially creating a pool of proliferating cells that enable viral DNA replication and drive papule and spicule formation."
https://openalex.org/W1968890987,"Background Mucosal vaccine based on lactic acid bacteria is an attractive concept for the prevention and treatment of allergic diseases, but their mechanisms of action in vivo are poorly understood. Therefore, we sought to investigate how recombinant major dust mite allergen Der p2-expressing Lactococcus lactis as a mucosal vaccine induced the immune tolerance against house dust mite allergy in a mouse model. Methods Three strains of recombinant L. lactis producing Der p2 in different cell components (extracellular, intracellular and cell wall) were firstly constructed. Their prophylactic potential was evaluated in a Der p2-sensitised mouse model, and immunomodulation properties at the cellular level were determined by measuring cytokine production in vitro. Results Der p2 expressed in the different recombinant L. lactis strains was recognized by a polyclonal anti-Der p2 antibody. Oral treatment with the recombinant L. lactis prior sensitization significantly prevented the development of airway inflammation in the Der p2-sensitized mice, as determined by the attenuation of inflammatory cells infiltration in the lung tissues and decrease of Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-5 levels in bronchoalveolar lavage. In addition, the serum allergen-specific IgE levels were significantly reduced, and the levels of IL-4 in the spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes cell cultures were also markedly decreased upon allergen stimulation in the mice fed with the recombinant L. lactis strains. These protective effects correlated with a significant up-regulation of regulatory T cells in the mesenteric lymph nodes. Conclusion Oral pretreatment with live recombinant L. lactis prevented the development of allergen-induced airway inflammation primarily by the induction of specific mucosal immune tolerance."

Experiments were conducted in 2010 and 2011 to determine the effects of hill seeding density (25 cm×15 cm, 25 cm×17 cm, 25 cm×19 cm, 25 cm×21 cm, and 25 cm×23 cm; three to five seeds per hill) on plant growth and grain yield of a hybrid variety, Nei2you6, in two fields with different fertility (soil fertility 1 and 2). In addition, in 2012 and 2013, comparisons among mechanical hill seeding, broadcasting, and transplanting were conducted with three hybrid varieties to evaluate the optimum seeding density. With increases in seeding spacing from 25 cm×15 cm to 25 cm×23 cm, productive tillers per hill increased by 34.2% and 50.0% in soil fertility 1 and 2. Panicles per m2 declined with increases in seeding spacing in soil fertility 1. In soil fertility 2, no difference in panicles per m2 was found at spacing ranging from 25 cm×17 cm to 25 cm×23 cm, while decreases in the area of the top three leaves and aboveground dry weight per shoot at flowering were observed. Grain yield was the maximum at 25 cm×17 cm spacing in both soil fertility fields. Our results suggest that a seeding density of 25 cm×17 cm was suitable for high-yielding hybrid rice. These results were verified through on-farm demonstration experiments, in which mechanical hill-seeded rice at this density had equal or higher grain yield than transplanted rice."

Methods A total of 306 patients with painful diabetic lower-extremity neuropathy were treated with Dellon surgical nerve decompression in our department. Clinical evaluation including Visual analogue scale (VAS), Brief Pain Inventory Short Form for diabetic peripheral neuropathy (BPI-DPN) questionnaire, two-point discrimination (2-PD), nerve conduction velocity (NCV) and high-resolution ultrasonography (cross-sectional area, CSA) were performed in all cases preoperatively, and at 6 month intervals for 2 years post-decompression. The patients who underwent surgery were retrospectively assigned into two subgroups (focal and diffuse pain) according to the distribution of the diabetic neuropathic pain. The control group included 92 painful DPN patients without surgery. Results The levels of VAS, scores in BPI-DPN, 2-PD, NCV results and CSA were all improved in surgical group when compared to the control group (P<0.05). More improvement of VAS, scores in BPI-DPN and CSA was observed in focal pain group than that in diffuse group (P<0.05). Conclusions Efficacy of decompression of multiple lower-extremity peripheral nerves in patients with painful diabetic neuropathy was confirmed in this study. While both focal and diffuse group could benefit from surgical decompression, pain relief and morphological restoration could be better achieved in focal group."
https://openalex.org/W2083056119,"Central to our understanding of the timing of bird evolution is debate about an apparent conflict between fossil and molecular data. A deep age for higher level taxa within Neoaves is evident from molecular analyses but much remains to be learned about the age of diversification in modern bird families and their evolutionary ecology. In order to better understand the timing and pattern of diversification within the family Rallidae we used a relaxed molecular clock, fossil calibrations, and complete mitochondrial genomes from a range of rallid species analysed in a Bayesian framework. The estimated time of origin of Rallidae is Eocene, about 40.5 Mya, with evidence of intrafamiliar diversification from the Late Eocene to the Miocene. This timing is older than previously suggested for crown group Rallidae, but fossil calibrations, extent of taxon sampling and substantial sequence data give it credence. We note that fossils of Eocene age tentatively assigned to Rallidae are consistent with our findings.

Methods An individual level simulation model of HIV transmission, progression and the effect of ART which accounts for adherence and resistance development was used to compare outcomes of various potential monitoring strategies in a typical low income setting in sub-Saharan Africa. Underlying monitoring strategies considered were based on clinical disease, CD4 count or viral load. Within each we considered a strategy in which no further measures are performed, one with a viral load measure to confirm failure, and one with both a viral load measure and a resistance test. Predicted outcomes were assessed over 2015–2025 in terms of viral suppression, first line failure, switching to second line regimen, death, HIV incidence, disability-adjusted-life-years averted and costs. Potential future low costs of resistance tests ($30) were used. Results The most effective strategy, in terms of DALYs averted, was one using viral load monitoring without confirmation. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for this strategy was $2113 (the same as that for viral load monitoring with confirmation). ART monitoring strategies which involved resistance testing did not emerge as being more effective or cost effective than strategies not using it. The slightly reduced ART costs resulting from use of resistance testing, due to less use of second line regimens, was of similar magnitude to the costs of resistance tests. Conclusion Use of resistance testing at the time of first line failure as part of the decision whether to switch to second line therapy was not cost-effective, even though the test was assumed to be very inexpensive."
https://openalex.org/W2145587555,"Desmosomes are intercellular adhesive junctions of major importance for tissue integrity. To allow cell motility and migration they are down-regulated in epidermal wound healing. Electron microscopy indicates that whole desmosomes are internalised by cells in tissues, but the mechanism of down-regulation is unclear. In this paper we provide an overview of the internalisation of half-desmosomes by cultured cells induced by calcium chelation. Our results show that: (i) half desmosome internalisation is dependent on conventional PKC isoforms; (ii) microtubules transport internalised half desmosomes to the region of the centrosome by a kinesin-dependent mechanism; (iii) desmosomal proteins remain colocalised after internalisation and are not recycled to the cell surface; (iv) internalised desmosomes are degraded by the combined action of lysosomes and proteasomes. We also confirm that half desmosome internalisation is dependent upon the actin cytoskeleton. These results suggest that half desmosomes are not disassembled and recycled during or after internalisation but instead are transported to the centrosomal region where they are degraded. These findings may have significance for the down-regulation of desmosomes in wounds."
https://openalex.org/W2033137410,"Background Studies suggest an increased risk of peritonsillar abscess (PTA) recurrence in patients with prior tonsillitis. However, this association is inconsistent and could be confounded by different treatment modalities. This study aimed to assess the risk of recurrence among PTA patients with different degrees of prior tonsillitis and treatment modalities, and the role of tonsillectomy in current practice. Methods All in-patients with peritonsillar abscess between January 2001 and December 2009 were identified in a nationwide, retrospective cohort study. Recurrence was defined as the first occurrence of PTA ≧30 days from the initial PTA. Factors independently associated with recurrence were analyzed using Cox proportional hazard model after adjusting for demographic and clinical data. Results There were 28,837 patients, with a 5.15% recurrence rate and 4.74 years of follow-up. The recurrence rates were significantly higher among subjects with more than five prior tonsillitis or 1–4 prior tonsillitis compared to those without prior tonsillitis (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.82 [95% confidence interval, 2.39–3.33] and 1.59 [95% CI: 1.38–1.82]). The adjusted HR in patients treated with needle aspiration was 1.08 compared to those treated with incision & drainage (95% CI: 0.85–1.38). After age stratification, the adjusted HRs of more than five prior tonsillitis increased to 2.92 and 3.50 in patients aged ≦18 and 19–29 years respectively. The adjusted HR ofneedle aspiration only increased in patients ≦18 years old (aHR: 1.98 [95% CI: 0.99–3.97]). The overall tonsillectomy rate was 1.48% during our study period. Conclusions The risk of PTA recurrence increases with higher degrees of prior tonsillitis in all age groups and management by needle aspiration only in the pediatric population. Patients younger than 30 years old with PTA and more than five prior tonsillitis have the greatest risk of recurrence."
https://openalex.org/W2063813964,"To improve the efficacy and safety of tolerance induction for food allergies, identifying the tissues responsible for inducing intestinal inflammation and subsequent oral tolerance is important. We used OVA23-3 mice, which express an ovalbumin-specific T-cell receptor, to elucidate the roles of local and systemic immune tissues in intestinal inflammation.OVA23-3 mice developed marked enteropathy after consuming a diet containing egg white (EW diet) for 10 days but overcame the enteropathy (despite continued moderate inflammation) after receiving EW diet for a total of 28 days. Injecting mice with anti-IL-4 antibody or cyclosporine A confirmed the involvement of Th2 cells in the development of the enteropathy. To assess the individual contributions of Peyer's patches (PPs), mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs), and the spleen to the generation of effector CD4+ T-cells, we analyzed the IL-4 production, proliferation in response to ovalbumin, and CD4+ T-cell numbers of these tissues. EW feeding for 10 days induced significant IL-4 production in PPs, the infiltration of numerous CD4+ T-cells into MLNs, and a decrease in CD4+ T-cell numbers in spleen. On day 28, CD4+ T-cells from all tissues had attenuated responses to ovalbumin, suggesting tolerance acquisition, although MLN CD4+ T-cells still maintained IL-4 production with proliferation. In addition, removal of MLNs but not the spleen decreased the severity of enteropathy and PP-disrupted mice showed delayed onset of EW-induced inflammatory responses. Disruption of peripheral lymphoid tissues or of both PPs and MLNs almost completely prevented the enteropathy.PPs and MLNs coordinately promote enteropathy by generating effector T-cells during the initial and exacerbated phases, respectively; the spleen is dispensable for enteropathy and shows tolerogenic responses throughout EW-feeding. The regulation of PPs may suppress the initiation of intestinal inflammation, subsequently restricting MLNs and inhibiting the progression of food-allergic enteropathy."
https://openalex.org/W2049999586,"The C-terminal domain (CTD, aa 686–741) of nuclear factor-erythroid 2 p45-related factor 1 (Nrf1) shares 53% amino acid sequence identity with the equivalent Neh3 domain of Nrf2, a homologous transcription factor. The Neh3 positively regulates Nrf2, but whether the Neh3-like (Neh3L) CTD of Nrf1 has a similar role in regulating Nrf1-target gene expression is unknown. Herein, we report that CTD negatively regulates the full-length Nrf1 (i.e. 120-kDa glycoprotein and 95-kDa deglycoprotein) and its shorter isoform LCR-F1/Nrf1β (55-kDa). Attachment of its CTD-adjoining 112-aa to the C-terminus of Nrf2 yields the chimaeric Nrf2-C112Nrf1 factor with a markedly decreased activity. Live-cell imaging of GFP-CTD reveals that the extra-nuclear portion of the fusion protein is allowed to associate with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane through the amphipathic Neh3L region of Nrf1 and its basic c-tail. Thus removal of either the entire CTD or the essential Neh3L portion within CTD from Nrf1, LCR-F1/Nrf1β and Nrf2-C112Nrf1, results in an increase in their transcriptional ability to regulate antioxidant response element (ARE)-driven reporter genes. Further examinations unravel that two smaller isoforms, 36-kDa Nrf1γ and 25-kDa Nrf1δ, act as dominant-negative inhibitors to compete against Nrf1, LCR-F1/Nrf1β and Nrf2. Relative to Nrf1, LCR-F1/Nrf1β is a weak activator, that is positively regulated by its Asn/Ser/Thr-rich (NST) domain and acidic domain 2 (AD2). Like AD1 of Nrf1, both AD2 and NST domain of LCR-F1/Nrf1β fused within two different chimaeric contexts to yield Gal4D:Nrf1β607 and Nrf1β:C270Nrf2, positively regulate their transactivation activity of cognate Gal4- and Nrf2-target reporter genes. More importantly, differential expression of endogenous ARE-battery genes is attributable to up-regulation by Nrf1 and LCR-F1/Nrf1β and down-regulation by Nrf1γ and Nrf1δ."
https://openalex.org/W1989645549,"Liver fibrosis is mediated by hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), which respond to a variety of cytokine and growth factors to moderate the response to injury and create extracellular matrix at the site of injury. G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR)-mediated signaling, via endothelin-1 (ET-1) and angiotensin II (AngII), increases HSC contraction, migration and fibrogenesis. Regulator of G-protein signaling-5 (RGS5), an inhibitor of vasoactive GPCR agonists, functions to control GPCR-mediated contraction and hypertrophy in pericytes and smooth muscle cells (SMCs). Therefore we hypothesized that RGS5 controls GPCR signaling in activated HSCs in the context of liver injury. In this study, we localize RGS5 to the HSCs and demonstrate that Rgs5 expression is regulated during carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced acute and chronic liver injury in Rgs5LacZ/LacZ reporter mice. Furthermore, CCl4 treated RGS5-null mice develop increased hepatocyte damage and fibrosis in response to CCl4 and have increased expression of markers of HSC activation. Knockdown of Rgs5 enhances ET-1-mediated signaling in HSCs in vitro. Taken together, we demonstrate that RGS5 is a critical regulator of GPCR signaling in HSCs and regulates HSC activation and fibrogenesis in liver injury."
https://openalex.org/W2032476493,"Most inhibitors of Cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) target its ATP-binding pocket. It is difficult, however, to use this pocket to design very specific inhibitors because this catalytic pocket is highly conserved in the protein family of CDKs. Here we report some short peptides targeting a noncatalytic pocket near the interface of the CDK2/Cyclin complex. Docking and molecular dynamics simulations were used to select the peptides, and detailed dynamical network analysis revealed that these peptides weaken the complex formation via allosteric interactions. Our experiments showed that upon binding to the noncatalytic pocket, these peptides break the CDK2/Cyclin complex partially and diminish its kinase activity in vitro. The binding affinity of these peptides measured by Surface Plasmon Resonance can reach as low as 0.5 µM."

However, increasing evidence supports the existence of an alternative pathway in which the aggregation of globular proteins into amyloids can depart from conformational states directly accessible from the native state without the requirement of a large unfolding (37Chiti F.

The β-strand D of transthyretin trapped in two discrete conformations.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1700: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Here, we address the conformational and aggregational properties of a TTL domain from the first catalytic domain of human CPD (h-TTL) under close to native conditions and their functional implications, thus providing new insights on the interplay between the establishment of functional and deleterious protein interactions. The transthyretin-like domain belonging to the first catalytic domain of human metallocarboxypeptidase D (residues 386–460), named here as h-TTL, was cloned into the pET-22B vector to encode a C-terminal hexahistidine fusion protein. For protein production, the plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells, which were then grown in 1 liter of lysogeny broth (LB) with 50 μg ml−1 ampicillin at 37 °C and 250 rpm to an A600 nm of 0.5 to 0.6. When the cell reached this density, protein expression was induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 16 h at 18 °C. Then the culture was centrifuged, and the cell pellet was frozen at −20 °C. After cell lysis by sonication in 1/50th the initial culture volume of 100 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl buffer at pH 8.0, TTL protein was purified under native conditions by affinity chromatography on a chelating SepharoseTM fast flow (GE Healthcare) resin. The column was equilibrated and washed gently with 100 mm Tris·HCl, 0.5 m NaCl buffer at pH 8.0, and the TTL protein was eluted in 3 column volumes of a 50 mm Tris·HCl, 0.15 m NaCl at pH 8.0 buffer containing 500 mm imidazole. The recombinant protein was further purified on a Superdex 75 HR 10/30 column (GE Healthcare), and the protein buffer was exchanged on a Sephadex G-25 column (GE Healthcare) to a 20 mm phosphate, 100 mm NaCl buffer at pH 8.0. The purified TTL protein was flash-frozen at ∼2.2 mg ml−1 and stored at −80 °C. h-TTL intrinsic fluorescence was registered after equilibration at 25, 37, 42, 45, and 75 °C in a Jasco FP-8200 spectrofluorimeter by measuring Tyr emission spectra between 280 and 400 nm upon excitation at 268 nm. Slit widths were typically 5 nm for excitation and 5 nm for emission, and the spectra were acquired at 0.5-nm intervals, 1000 nm/min−1 rate, and 0.1 s averaging time of 25 μm protein concentrations in 20 mm phosphate, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl buffer. h-TTL far-UV and near-UV CD spectra were recorded between 205 and 250 nm and 250 and 320 nm, respectively, at 25, 37, 42, 45, and 75 °C with a spectral resolution of 0.5 nm, using a Jasco 810 spectropolarimeter. Each spectrum was obtained by accumulating 20 scans of 25 μm protein sample in a 20 mm phosphate, 100 mm NaCl buffer at pH 8.0, in a 0.1 path-length quartz cell. Quenching of h-TTL intrinsic fluorescence was analyzed by monitoring Tyr emission in the presence of acrylamide. Tyr fluorescent emission was recorded between 280 and 400 nm upon excitation at 268 nm and after equilibration at 25, 37, 42, 45, and 75 °C using 10 μm protein samples with final quencher concentrations ranging from 0 to 0.25 m in a Jasco FP-8200 spectrofluorimeter. Data were fitted to Equation 1, I0I=(1+Ksv[Q])eV[Q](Eq. 1) where I0 and I are the fluorescence intensities in the absence and presence of a concentration of quencher [Q]. KSV is the Stern-Volmer constant, and V is the static quenching constant. h-TTL thermal denaturation was monitored by following the changes in Tyr intrinsic fluorescence at 303 nm upon excitation at 268 nm, in bis-ANS binding at 485 nm upon excitation at 370 nm and in CD ellipticity at 235 nm. Signal change was recorded using a 1 °C/min−1 gradient and protein concentrations ranging from 5 to 25 μm. Chemical denaturation of h-TTL was followed by monitoring change in Tyr intrinsic fluorescence at 303 nm of 25 μm protein samples at different urea concentrations after equilibration at 25, 37, 42 or 45 °C. Samples fluorescence was recorded in the 280 to 400 nm range after excitation at 268 nm, using a Jasco FP-8200 spectrofluorimeter. Experimental data of thermal and chemical denaturation were fitted to a two-state unfolding model where the signals of the folded and the unfolded state are linearly dependent on temperature or denaturant concentration, see Equations 2 and 3, respectively, using a nonlinear least squares algorithm provided with KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software), y=αF+βF⋅T+(αU+βU⋅T)⋅eΔHVHR⋅(1Tm-1T)1+eΔHVHR⋅(1Tm-1T)(Eq. 2) y=αF+βF⋅D+(αU+βU⋅D)⋅eΔHVHR⋅(D-D50R⋅T)1+emU-F⋅(D-D50R⋅T)(Eq. 3) where y is the observed signal; T and D are experimental temperature and denaturant concentrations, respectively; αF and αU are the spectroscopic signals of the folded and the unfolded states either at standard temperature or in the absence of denaturant, respectively, βF and βU are the dependences of the signal on the change of temperature or denaturant concentration for the folded and the unfolded states, respectively; ΔHVH is the Van't Hoff enthalpy of unfolding; Tm is the melting temperature; mU-F is the proportionality constant between the free energy of unfolding and D; D50 indicates the denaturant concentration where the free energy of unfolding equals 0; and R is the gas constant. The amino acid sequences of h-TTL and TTR were obtained from the UniProt database. A structural alignment between h-TTL and TTR was generated by the flexible structure alignment by chaining aligned fragment pairs with twists (FATCAT) algorithm (44Ye Y. Godzik A. Flexible structure alignment by chaining aligned fragment pairs allowing twists.Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 246-255Crossref Scopus (465) Google Scholar) using the protein comparison tool of the RCSB Protein Data Bank. Three-dimensional structures of human TTR (code 3W3B) as well as the transthyretin-like domains of human carboxypeptidase M (CPM) (1UWY) and human carboxypeptidase N (2NSM) were obtained from the Protein Data Bank. Structural models of TTL and transthyretin-like domains of human carboxypeptidase Z, human carboxypeptidase E, human adipocyte enhancer-binding protein 1 (AEBP1), human carboxypeptidase X1 (CPX1), and human carboxypeptidase X2 (CPX2) were constructed by using the automated I-TASSER on-line server (45Zhang Y. I-TASSER server for protein 3D structure prediction.BMC Bioinformatics. 2008; 9: 40Crossref PubMed Scopus (3870) Google Scholar). Models with the best C-score, based on the significance of threading template alignments and the convergence parameters, were selected. After I-TASSER models were built automatically, manual intervention was required to redefine secondary structure limits, based on the predictions of Jpred 3 (46Cole C. Barber J.D. Barton G.J. The Jpred 3 secondary structure prediction server.Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: W197-W201Crossref PubMed Scopus (1233) Google Scholar), expert knowledge, and experimental information. The primary sequence of h-TTL was used as input to predict its aggregation-prone regions (APRs) using the WALTZ algorithm (47Maurer-Stroh S. Debulpaep M. Kuemmerer N. Lopez de la Paz M. Martins I.C.

Methods. 2010; 7: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). PyMOL (48DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA2002Google Scholar) was used for generation of figures and visual inspection of models. h-TTL aggregation from soluble monomers was monitored by following the evolution over time of Th-T binding to 100 μm protein samples in 20 mm phosphate, 100 mm NaCl buffer at pH 8.0 and incubated under agitation at 25, 37, 42, or 45 °C. Th-T binding was evaluated for samples obtained at different times by recording dye fluorescence as described below. h-TTL aggregation kinetics at different temperatures were represented as normalized Th-T fluorescence intensity at 480 nm against time and were fitted to an autocatalytic model, whenever possible, as described previously (34Sabate R. Espargaro A. Graña-Montes R. Reverter D. Ventura S. Native structure protects SUMO proteins from aggregation into amyloid fibrils.Biomacromolecules. 2012; 13: 1916-1926Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The effect of seeding on h-TTL aggregation kinetics was evaluated by adding at T = 0 10% (w/w) of amyloid fibrils preformed at 42 °C. Th-T binding to h-TTL protein aggregates was measured by recording Th-T fluorescence using a Jasco FP-8200 spectrofluorimeter, with an excitation wavelength of 445 nm and an emission range between 460 and 600 nm. Spectra of dilutions were registered with a 25 μm final Th-T concentration in the absence or presence of 25 μm h-TTL aggregates at different temperatures in a 20 mm phosphate, 100 mm NaCl buffer at pH 8.0. For optical microscopy analysis, h-TTL protein aggregates were incubated for 1 h in the presence of 25 μm Th-T. After centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 5 min, the precipitated fraction was placed on a microscope slide and sealed. Th-T fluorescence images were obtained under UV light with a fluorescence microscope (Leica Microsystems). Binding of bis-ANS to h-TTL was evaluated by registering bis-ANS fluorescence between 400 and 650 nm after excitation at 370 nm in a Jasco FP-8200 spectrofluorimeter. Spectra were recorded at 25, 37, 42, 45, and 75 °C after diluting native h-TTL in a 20 mm phosphate, 100 mm NaCl buffer at pH 8.0 with bis-ANS. Final protein and dye concentrations were 25 and 2.5 μm, respectively. Attenuated total reflectance Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) analysis of h-TTL aggregates after 14 days of incubation was performed using a Bruker Tensor 27 FTIR spectrometer (Bruker Optics) with a Golden Gate MKII ATR accessory. Each spectrum was measured at a spectral resolution of 2 cm−1. Infrared spectra between 1725 and 1575 cm−1 were fitted through overlapping Gaussian curves, and the amplitude, mass center, bandwidth at half of the maximum amplitude, and area for each Gaussian function were calculated employing the nonlinear peak-fitting program PeakFit (Systat software). Samples of h-TTL incubated at 37 and 42 °C for 14 days were diluted 10-fold and placed onto carbon-coated grids. After 5 min, grids were washed with distilled water and then negatively stained with 2% (w/v) uranyl acetate for 2 min. Micrographs were recorded in a Hitachi H-7000 transmission electron microscope (TEM) operated at 75-kV accelerating voltage. A peptide with the sequence GTYNLTVVLTGYM, corresponding to the aggregation-prone region of h-TTL predicted using the WALTZ (47Maurer-Stroh S. Debulpaep M. Kuemmerer N. Lopez de la Paz M.

Stock solutions were prepared at 5 mm in 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol (hexafluoroisopropanol), centrifuged at 15,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min and filtrated through millex-GV 0.22-mm filters to remove pre-aggregated species. After removing hexafluoroisopropanol by evaporation, samples were stored at −80 °C. For analysis, the peptide was resuspended in DMSO, further diluted to 100 μm in 20 mm phosphate, 100 mm NaCl buffer at pH 8.0 (with a maximum DMSO concentration of 5%), and finally bath-sonicated for 10 min. Peptide aggregation was carried out without agitation at 25"

It is also possible that subtle prefrontal cortex changes associated with conditions such as chronic pain, and not detectable until recent advances in human brain imaging, may also result in subtle changes in an individual’s personality. In an animal model of chronic neuropathic pain, subtle prefrontal cortex changes including altered basal dendritic length, resulted in altered decision making ability. Using multiple magnetic resonance imaging techniques, we found in humans, although gray matter volume and on-going activity were unaltered, chronic neuropathic pain was associated with reduced free and bound proton movement, indicators of subtle anatomical changes, in the medial prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex and mediodorsal thalamus. Furthermore, proton spectroscopy revealed an increase in neural integrity in the medial prefrontal cortex in neuropathic pain patients, the degree of which was significantly correlated to the personality temperament of novelty seeking. These data reveal that even subtle changes in prefrontal cortex anatomy may result in a significant change in an individual’s personality."
https://openalex.org/W1973553933,"The stimulatory NKG2D receptor on lymphocytes promotes tumor immune surveillance by targeting ligands selectively induced on cancer cells. Progressing tumors counteract by employing tactics to disable lymphocyte NKG2D. This negative dynamic is escalated as some human cancer cells co-opt expression of NKG2D, thereby complementing the presence of its ligands for autonomous stimulation of oncogenic signaling. Clinical association data imply relationships between cancer cell NKG2D and metastatic disease. Here we show that NKG2D promotes cancer cell plasticity by induction of phenotypic, molecular, and functional signatures diagnostic of the epithelial–mesenchymal transition, and of stem-like traits via induction of Sox9, a key transcriptional regulator of breast stem cell maintenance. These findings obtained with model breast tumor lines and xenotransplants were recapitulated by ex vivo cancer cells from primary invasive breast carcinomas. Thus, NKG2D may have the capacity to drive high malignancy traits underlying metastatic disease."
https://openalex.org/W1985126323,"Reductions in electrotonic loading around regions of structural and electrophysiological heterogeneity may facilitate capture of focal triggered activity, initiating reentrant arrhythmias. How electrotonic loading, refractoriness and capture of focal ectopics depend upon the intricate nature of physiological structural anatomy, as well as pathological tissue remodelling, however, is not well understood. In this study, we performed computational bidomain simulations with anatomically-detailed models representing the rabbit left ventricle. We used these models to quantify the relationship between local structural anatomy and spatial heterogeneity in action potential (AP) characteristics, electrotonic currents and effective refractory periods (ERPs) under pacing and restitution protocols. Regions surrounding vessel cavities, in addition to tissue surfaces, had significantly lower peak downstream electrotonic currents than well coupled myocardium ( vs A/cm2), with faster maximum AP upstroke velocities ( vs mV/ms), although noticeably very similar APDs ( vs ms) and AP restitution properties. Despite similarities in APDs, ERPs in regions of low electrotonic load in the vicinity of surfaces, intramural vessel cavities and endocardial structures were up to ms shorter compared to neighbouring well-coupled tissue, leading to regions of sharp ERP gradients. Consequently, focal extra-stimuli timed within this window of ERP heterogeneity between neighbouring regions readily induced uni-directional block, inducing reentry. Most effective induction sites were within channels of low ERPs between large vessels and epicardium. Significant differences in ERP driven by reductions in electrotonic loading due to fine-scale physiological structural heterogeneity provides an important mechanism of capture of focal activity and reentry induction. Application to pathological ventricles, particularly myocardial infarction, will have important implications in anti-arrhythmia therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1988044012,"Predation and fire shape the structure and function of ecosystems globally. However, studies exploring interactions between these two processes are rare, especially at large spatial scales. This knowledge gap is significant not only for ecological theory, but also in an applied context, because it limits the ability of landscape managers to predict the outcomes of manipulating fire and predators. We examined the influence of fire on the occurrence of an introduced and widespread mesopredator, the red fox (Vulpes vulpes), in semi-arid Australia. We used two extensive and complimentary datasets collected at two spatial scales. At the landscape-scale, we surveyed red foxes using sand-plots within 28 study landscapes - which incorporated variation in the diversity and proportional extent of fire-age classes - located across a 104 000 km2 study area. At the site-scale, we surveyed red foxes using camera traps at 108 sites stratified along a century-long post-fire chronosequence (0-105 years) within a 6630 km2 study area. Red foxes were widespread both at the landscape and site-scale. Fire did not influence fox distribution at either spatial scale, nor did other environmental variables that we measured. Our results show that red foxes exploit a broad range of environmental conditions within semi-arid Australia. The presence of red foxes throughout much of the landscape is likely to have significant implications for native fauna, particularly in recently burnt habitats where reduced cover may increase prey species' predation risk."
https://openalex.org/W2005385255,"Background There is increasing evidence that peripheral glutamate signaling mechanism is involved in the nociceptive transmission during pathological conditions. However, little is known about the glutamate signaling mechanism and related specific type of vesicular glutamate transporter (VGLUT) in the dental pulp following inflammation. To address this issue, we investigated expression and protein levels of VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 in the dental pulp and trigeminal ganglion (TG) following complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA) application to the rat dental pulp by light microscopic immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis. Results The density of VGLUT2− immunopositive (+) axons in the dental pulp and the number of VGLUT2+ soma in the TG increased significantly in the CFA-treated group, compared to control group. The protein levels of VGLUT2 in the dental pulp and TG were also significantly higher in the CFA-treated group than control group by Western blot analysis. The density of VGLUT1+ axons in the dental pulp and soma in the TG remained unchanged in the CFA-treated group. Conclusions These findings suggest that glutamate signaling that is mediated by VGLUT2 in the pulpal axons may be enhanced in the inflamed dental pulp, which may contribute to pulpal axon sensitization leading to hyperalgesia following inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2010345998,"Lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) are commonly used in molecular genetics, supplying DNA for the HapMap and 1000 Genomes Projects, used to test chemotherapeutic agents, and informing the basis of a number of population genetics studies of gene expression. The process of transforming human B cells into LCLs requires the presence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a double-stranded DNA virus which through B-cell immortalisation maintains an episomal virus genome in every cell of an LCL at variable copy numbers. Previous studies have reported that EBV alters host-gene expression and EBV copy number may be under host genetic control. We performed a genome-wide association study of EBV genome copy number in LCLs and found the phenotype to be highly heritable, although no individual SNPs achieved a significant association with EBV copy number. The expression of two host genes (CXCL16 and AGL) was positively correlated and expression of ADARB2 was negatively correlated with EBV copy number in a genotype-independent manner. This study shows an association between EBV copy number and the gene expression profile of LCLs, and suggests that EBV copy number should be considered as a covariate in future studies of host gene expression in LCLs."
https://openalex.org/W2012343386,"Structural maintenance of chromosomes flexible hinge domain containing 1 (SMCHD1) has been shown to be involved in gene silencing and DNA damage. However, the exact mechanisms of how SMCHD1 participates in DNA damage remains largely unknown. Here we present evidence that SMCHD1 recruitment to DNA damage foci is regulated by 53BP1. Knocking out SMCHD1 led to aberrant γH2AX foci accumulation and compromised cell survival upon DNA damage, demonstrating the critical role of SMCHD1 in DNA damage repair. Following DNA damage induction, SMCHD1 depletion resulted in reduced 53BP1 foci and increased BRCA1 foci, as well as less efficient non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and elevated levels of homologous recombination (HR). Taken together, these results suggest an important function of SMCHD1 in promoting NHEJ and repressing HR repair in response to DNA damage."
https://openalex.org/W2018415267,"The dysfunction of parvalbumin-positive, fast-spiking interneurons (FSI) is considered a primary contributor to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia (SZ), but deficits in FSI physiology have not been explicitly characterized. We show for the first time, that a widely-employed model of schizophrenia minimizes first spike latency and increases GluN2B-mediated current in neocortical FSIs. The reduction in FSI first-spike latency coincides with reduced expression of the Kv1.1 potassium channel subunit which provides a biophysical explanation for the abnormal spiking behavior. Similarly, the increase in NMDA current coincides with enhanced expression of the GluN2B NMDA receptor subunit, specifically in FSIs. In this study mice were treated with the NMDA receptor antagonist, MK-801, during the first week of life. During adolescence, we detected reduced spike latency and increased GluN2B-mediated NMDA current in FSIs, which suggests transient disruption of NMDA signaling during neonatal development exerts lasting changes in the cellular and synaptic physiology of neocortical FSIs. Overall, we propose these physiological disturbances represent a general impairment to the physiological maturation of FSIs which may contribute to schizophrenia-like behaviors produced by this model."

Laboratory supported case based measles surveillance is an essential component of measles elimination strategies. Results from a case-based measles surveillance system in Pune district (November 2009 through December 2011) are reported here with wider implications for measles elimination efforts in India.Standard protocols were followed for case identification, investigation and classification. Suspected measles cases were confirmed through serology (IgM) or epidemiological linkage or clinical presentation. Data regarding age, sex, vaccination status were collected and annualized incidence rates for measles and rubella cases calculated.Of the 1011 suspected measles cases reported to the surveillance system, 76% were confirmed measles, 6% were confirmed rubella, and 17% were non-measles, non-rubella cases. Of the confirmed measles cases, 95% were less than 15 years of age. Annual measles incidence rate was more than 250 per million persons and nearly half were associated with outbreaks. Thirty-nine per cent of the confirmed measles cases were vaccinated with one dose of measles vaccine (MCV1).Surveillance demonstrated high measles incidence and frequent outbreaks in Pune where MCV1 coverage in infants was above 90%. Results indicate that even high coverage with a single dose of measles vaccine was insufficient to provide population protection and prevent measles outbreaks. An effective measles and rubella surveillance system provides essential information to plan, implement and evaluate measles immunization strategies and monitor progress towards measles elimination."
https://openalex.org/W2018769669,"Methamphetamine (MA) is a potent psychostimulant with a high addictive capacity, which induces many deleterious effects on the brain. Chronic MA abuse leads to cognitive dysfunction and motor impairment. MA affects many cells in the brain, but the effects on astrocytes of repeated MA exposure is not well understood. In this report, we used Gene chip array to analyze the changes in the gene expression profile of primary human astrocytes treated with MA for 3 days. Range of genes were found to be differentially regulated, with a large number of genes significantly downregulated, including NEK2, TTK, TOP2A, and CCNE2. Gene ontology and pathway analysis showed a highly significant clustering of genes involved in cell cycle progression and DNA replication. Further pathway analysis showed that the genes downregulated by multiple MA treatment were critical for G2/M phase progression and G1/S transition. Cell cycle analysis of SVG astrocytes showed a significant reduction in the percentage of cell in the G2/M phase with a concomitant increase in G1 percentage. This was consistent with the gene array and validation data, which showed that repeated MA treatment downregulated the genes associated with cell cycle regulation. This is a novel finding, which explains the effect of MA treatment on astrocytes and has clear implication in neuroinflammation among the drug abusers."
https://openalex.org/W2041651021,"Grasslands account for a large proportion of global terrestrial productivity and play a critical role in carbon and water cycling. Within grasslands, photosynthetic pathway is an important functional trait yielding different rates of productivity along environmental gradients. Recently, C3-C4 sorting along spatial environmental gradients has been reassessed by controlling for confounding traits in phylogenetically structured comparisons. C3 and C4 grasses should sort along temporal environmental gradients as well, resulting in differing phenologies and growing season lengths. Here we use 10 years of satellite data (NDVI) to examine the phenology and greenness (as a proxy for productivity) of C3 and C4 grass habitats, which reflect differences in both environment and plant physiology. We perform phylogenetically structured comparisons based on 3,595 digitized herbarium collections of 152 grass species across the Hawaiian Islands. Our results show that the clade identity of grasses captures differences in their habitats better than photosynthetic pathway. Growing season length (GSL) and associated productivity (GSP) were not significantly different when considering photosynthetic type alone, but were indeed different when considering photosynthetic type nested within clade. The relationship between GSL and GSP differed most strongly between C3 clade habitats, and not between C3-C4 habitats. Our results suggest that accounting for the interaction between phylogeny and photosynthetic pathway can help improve predictions of productivity, as commonly used C3-C4 classifications are very broad and appear to mask important diversity in grassland ecosystem functions."
https://openalex.org/W1967786294,"This study expanded upon a previous study in mice reporting a link between exenatide treatment and exocrine pancreatic injury by demonstrating temporal and dose responses and providing an initial mechanistic hypothesis. The design of the present study included varying lengths of exenatide exposure (3, 6 weeks to 12 weeks) at multiple concentrations (3, 10, or 30 µg/kg) with multiple endpoints (histopathology evaluations, immunoassay for cytokines, immunostaining of the pancreas, serum chemistries and measurement of trypsin, amylase, and, lipase, and gene expression profiles). Time- and dose-dependent exocrine pancreatic injury was observed in mice on a high fat diet treated with exenatide. The morphological changes identified in the pancreas involved acinar cell injury and death (autophagy, apoptosis, necrosis, and atrophy), cell adaptations (hypertrophy and hyperplasia), and cell survival (proliferation/regeneration) accompanied by varying degrees of inflammatory response leading to secondary injury in pancreatic blood vessels, ducts, and adipose tissues. Gene expression profiles indicated increased signaling for cell survival and altered lipid metabolism in exenatide treated mice. Immunohistochemistry supported gene expression findings that exenatide caused and/or exacerbated pancreatic injury in a high fat diet environment potentially by further increasing high fat diet exacerbated lipid metabolism and resulting oxidative stress. Further investigation is required to confirm these findings and determine their relevance to human disease."
https://openalex.org/W1985076600,"Analysis of the failure of cell signaling networks is an important topic in systems biology and has applications in target discovery and drug development. In this paper, some advanced methods for fault diagnosis in signaling networks are developed and then applied to a caspase network and an SHP2 network. The goal is to understand how, and to what extent, the dysfunction of molecules in a network contributes to the failure of the entire network. Network dysfunction (failure) is defined as failure to produce the expected outputs in response to the input signals. Vulnerability level of a molecule is defined as the probability of the network failure, when the molecule is dysfunctional. In this study, a method to calculate the vulnerability level of single molecules for different combinations of input signals is developed. Furthermore, a more complex yet biologically meaningful method for calculating the multi-fault vulnerability levels is suggested, in which two or more molecules are simultaneously dysfunctional. Finally, a method is developed for fault diagnosis of networks based on a ternary logic model, which considers three activity levels for a molecule instead of the previously published binary logic model, and provides equations for the vulnerabilities of molecules in a ternary framework. Multi-fault analysis shows that the pairs of molecules with high vulnerability typically include a highly vulnerable molecule identified by the single fault analysis. The ternary fault analysis for the caspase network shows that predictions obtained using the more complex ternary model are about the same as the predictions of the simpler binary approach. This study suggests that by increasing the number of activity levels the complexity of the model grows; however, the predictive power of the ternary model does not appear to be increased proportionally."
https://openalex.org/W1995339870,"Pituitary adenomas are neoplasms of the anterior pituitary lobe and account for 15–20% of all intracranial tumors. Although most pituitary tumors are benign they can cause severe symptoms related to tumor size as well as hypopituitarism and/or hypersecretion of one or more pituitary hormones. Most pituitary adenomas are sporadic, but it has been estimated that 5% of patients have a familial background. Germline mutations of the tumor suppressor gene aryl hydrocarbon receptor-interacting protein (AIP) predispose to hereditary pituitary neoplasia. Recently, it has been demonstrated that AIP mutations predispose to pituitary tumorigenesis through defective inhibitory GTP binding protein (Gαi) signaling. This finding prompted us to examine whether germline loss-of-function mutations in inhibitory guanine nucleotide (GTP) binding protein alpha (GNAI) loci are involved in genetic predisposition of pituitary tumors. To our knowledge, this is the first time GNAI genes are sequenced in order to examine the occurrence of inactivating germline mutations. Thus far, only somatic gain-of-function hot-spot mutations have been studied in these loci. Here, we have analyzed the coding regions of GNAI1, GNAI2, and GNAI3 in a set of young sporadic somatotropinoma patients (n = 32; mean age of diagnosis 32 years) and familial index cases (n = 14), thus in patients with a disease phenotype similar to that observed in AIP mutation carriers. In addition, expression of Gαi proteins was studied in human growth hormone (GH), prolactin (PRL), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-secreting and non-functional pituitary tumors. No pathogenic germline mutations affecting the Gαi proteins were detected. The result suggests that loss-of-function mutations of GNAI loci are rare or nonexistent in familial pituitary adenomas."
https://openalex.org/W2001863840,"The ability to acquire iron from various sources has been demonstrated to be a major determinant in the pathogenesis of Neisseria meningitidis. Outside the cells, iron is bound to transferrin in serum, or to lactoferrin in mucosal secretions. Meningococci can extract iron from iron-loaded human transferrin by the TbpA/TbpB outer membrane complex. Moreover, N. meningitidis expresses the LbpA/LbpB outer membrane complex, which can extract iron from iron-loaded human lactoferrin. Iron transport through the outer membrane requires energy provided by the ExbB-ExbD-TonB complex. After transportation through the outer membrane, iron is bound by periplasmic protein FbpA and is addressed to the FbpBC inner membrane transporter. Iron-complexing compounds like citrate and pyrophosphate have been shown to support meningococcal growth ex vivo. The use of iron pyrophosphate as an iron source by N. meningitidis was previously described, but has not been investigated. Pyrophosphate was shown to participate in iron transfer from transferrin to ferritin. In this report, we investigated the use of ferric pyrophosphate as an iron source by N. meningitidis both ex vivo and in a mouse model. We showed that pyrophosphate was able to sustain N. meningitidis growth when desferal was used as an iron chelator. Addition of a pyrophosphate analogue to bacterial suspension at millimolar concentrations supported N. meningitidis survival in the mouse model. Finally, we show that pyrophosphate enabled TonB-independent ex vivo use of iron-loaded human or bovine transferrin as an iron source by N. meningitidis. Our data suggest that, in addition to acquiring iron through sophisticated systems, N. meningitidis is able to use simple strategies to acquire iron from a wide range of sources so as to sustain bacterial survival."
https://openalex.org/W2003713022,"The lysogeny promoting protein CII from bacteriophage 186 is a potent transcriptional activator, capable of mediating at least a 400-fold increase in transcription over basal activity. Despite being functionally similar to its counterpart in phage λ, it shows no homology at the level of protein sequence and does not belong to any known family of transcriptional activators. It also has the unusual property of binding DNA half-sites that are separated by 20 base pairs, center to center. Here we investigate the structural and functional properties of CII using a combination of genetics, in vitro assays, and mutational analysis. We find that 186 CII possesses two functional domains, with an independent activation epitope in each. 186 CII owes its potent activity to activation mechanisms that are dependent on both the σ(70) and α C-terminal domain (αCTD) components of RNA polymerase, contacting different functional domains. We also present evidence that like λ CII, 186 CII is proteolytically degraded in vivo, but unlike λ CII, 186 CII proteolysis results in a specific, transcriptionally inactive, degradation product with altered self-association properties."
https://openalex.org/W2014809886,"Purpose The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between long-term aspirin use with pretreatment 18 Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake of primary lesions of Colorectal cancer (CRC) and evaluate their clinical significance. Materials and Methods We enrolled 84 patients with CRC who underwent 18F-FDG PET/CT scanning before surgery between 1st July 2008 and 1st March 2013 and followed up until 1st March 2014. Maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of the primary tumor was measured by 18F-FDG PET/CT. The history of aspirin taken and other clinicopathogical factors were also obtained and their relationships were examined by Mann-Whitney or χ2 tests. Progression-free survival (PFS) was determined by standard Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Cox proportional hazards regression was performed to determine whether history of aspirin taken, pretreatment SUVmax, age, gender, TNM stage, tumor sizes and differentiation influenced outcomes. Results CRC Patients with long-term history of aspirin use had lower SUVmax of primary lesions than control group (9.74±2.62 vs. 13.91±6.18) and showed a trend towards improved PFS after curative surgery. However, pretreatment of SUVmax showed no prognostic value in patients with CRC. Conclusions Long-term aspirin use is associated with lower pretreatment SUVmax of CRC and is a promising prognostic factor for predicting PFS in patients with CRC."
https://openalex.org/W2021794036,"Recently, we discovered that alpha satellite DNA has unique and genus-specific localizations on the chromosomes of small apes. This study describes the details of alpha satellite localization in the genera Nomascus and Hylobates and explores their usefulness in distinguishing parental genome sets in hybrids between these genera. Fluorescence in situ hybridization was used to establish diagnostic criteria of alpha satellite DNA markers in discriminating small ape genomes. In particular we established the genus specificity of alpha satellite distribution in three species of light-cheeked gibbons (Nomascus leucogenys, N. siki, and N. gabriellae) in comparison to that of Hylobates lar. Then we determined the localization of alpha satellite DNA in a hybrid individual which resulted from a cross between these two genera. In Nomascus the alpha satellite DNA blocks were located at the centromere, telomere, and four interstitial regions. In Hylobates detectable amounts of alpha satellite DNA were seen only at centromeric regions. The differences in alpha satellite DNA locations between Nomascus and Hylobates allowed us to easily distinguish the parental chromosomal sets in the genome of intergeneric hybrid individuals found in Thai and Japanese zoos. Our study illustrates how molecular cytogenetic markers can serve as diagnostic tools to identify the origin of individuals. These molecular tools can aid zoos, captive breeding programs and conservation efforts in managing small apes species. Discovering more information on alpha satellite distribution is also an opportunity to examine phylogenetic and evolutionary questions that are still controversial in small apes."
https://openalex.org/W2044192128,"Here, we describe peptide aggregation, which is also known as enzymatic protein resynthesis. Whey protein hydrolysate (WPH) is the starting material for assembling peptides. Analyses of the involved amino acids, intrinsic fluorescence, fluorescence phase diagram, secondary structure, turbidity, and surface hydrophobicity were performed to investigate the reaction process. The aggregation mechanism consists of two parts: 1) formation and 2) aggregation of the building blocks that form the ordered secondary β-sheet structure. Constructing the building blocks requires at least one intermediate state, which is formed after 0.5 hours. Non-synergistic changes in the secondary and tertiary structures then allow the intermediate state to emerge."
https://openalex.org/W2148996803,"The lower jaw of an unidentified Pennsylvanian (Late Carboniferous) tetrapod from Nova Scotia--the ""Parrsboro jaw""--is redescribed in the light of recent tetrapod discoveries and work on evolution of tetrapod mandibular morphology and placed for the first time in a numerical cladistics analysis. All phylogenetic analyses place the jaw in a crownward polytomy of baphetids, temnospondyls, and embolomeres. Several features resemble baphetids and temnospondyls including dermal ornamentation, absence of coronoid teeth, and presence of coronoid shagreen. Dentary dentition is most similar to Baphetes. An adsymphysial toothplate may not preclude temnospondyl affinity. An apparent large exomeckelian fenestra, with the dorsal foraminal margins formed by an unossified element, echoes the morphology of the stem tetrapod Sigournea and is unusually primitive given the other features of the jaw. The jaw may thus provide an example of an intermediate stage in Meckelian element evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2000677004,"VanX is a d-alanyl-d-alanine (d-Ala-d-Ala) dipeptidase encoded in the vancomycin-resistance vanA gene cluster. Here we report that strong bacteriolysis occurred when isolated VanX was expressed in Escherichia coli at temperatures lower than 30 °C, which was unexpected because the vanA operon confers vancomycin resistance by protecting the cell wall. Therefore, we monitored cell lysis by measuring sample turbidity with absorbance at 590 nm and VanX expression using SDS-PAGE. No cell lysis was observed when VanX was expressed, even in large quantities, in the cell inclusion bodies at 37 °C, suggesting that a natively folded VanX is required for lysis. In addition, VanX mutants with suppressed dipeptidase activity did not lyse E. coli cells, confirming that bacteriolysis originated from the dipeptidase activity of VanX. We also observed shape changes in E. coli cells undergoing VanX-mediated lysis with optical microscopy and classified these changes into three classes: bursting, deformation, and leaking fluid. Optical microscopic image analysis fully corroborated our interpretation of the turbidity changes in the samples. From a practical perspective, the finding that VanX expressed in isolation induces cell lysis suggests that inhibitors of VanA and VanH that act downstream from VanX could provide a new class of therapeutic chemicals against bacteria expressing the vancomycin-resistance gene cluster."
https://openalex.org/W2017990614,"The differences in rhizosphere nitrification activities between high- and low- fertility soils appear to be related to differences in dissolved oxygen concentrations in the soil, implying a relationship to differences in the radial oxygen loss (ROL) of rice roots in these soils. A miniaturised Clark-type oxygen microelectrode system was used to determine rice root ROL and the rhizosphere oxygen profile, and rhizosphere nitrification activity was studied using a short-term nitrification activity assay. Rice planting significantly altered the oxygen cycling in the water-soil system due to rice root ROL. Although the oxygen content in control high-fertility soil (without rice plants) was lower than that in control low-fertility soil, high rice root ROL significantly improved the rhizosphere oxygen concentration in the high-fertility soil. High soil fertility improved the rice root growth and root porosity as well as rice root ROL, resulting in enhanced rhizosphere nitrification. High fertility also increased the content of nitrification-induced nitrate in the rhizosphere, resulting in enhanced ammonium uptake and assimilation in the rice. Although high ammonium pools in the high-fertility soil increased rhizosphere nitrification, rice root ROL might also contribute to rhizosphere nitrification improvement. This study provides new insights into the reasons that an increase in soil fertility may enhance the growth of rice. Our results suggest that an amendment of the fertiliser used in nutrient- and nitrification-poor paddy soils in the red soil regions of China may significantly promote rice growth and rice N nutrition."
