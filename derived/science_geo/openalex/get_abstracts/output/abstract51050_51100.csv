https://openalex.org/W1502195451,"Abstract An improved method for the isolation of rat pancreatic islets possessing adenylate cyclase responsive to various hormones and agents is described. The key step in this method, which yielded up to 500 islets per pancreas, involved pretreatment of rats with pilocarpine. This allowed depletion of zymogens from the exocrine pancreatic tissue and thus minimized the destruction of islet membranal structure which could otherwise occur during the collagenase digestion of the tissue. The adenylate cyclase activity in the islet homogenates was assayed in the presence of a variety of hormones and other agents. With the exception of some insulinogenic metabolites, such as glucose, arginine, and leucine, all hormones previously shown by others to stimulate insulin secretion were found to augment the synthesis of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) by islet adenylate cyclase. These agents include glucagon, adrenocorticotropic hormone, secretin, pancreozymin, various prostaglandins, and β-adrenergic agents. Acetylcholine, ethanol, EGTA, GTP, and GDP, also stimulated cyclic AMP production, but their insulinogenic action has not been clearly shown. Of the two hypoglycemic drugs studied, tolbutamide was found to stimulate the cyclase activity whereas phenformin was without effect. Insulin inhibited the islet adenylate cyclase activity, suggesting a possible feedback mechanism involved in regulating insulin secretion. NaF was most effective in activating the islet adenylate cyclase. None of the above-mentioned agents had any effect on the islet phosphodiesterase activity. Based upon the above observations, it is suggested that cyclic AMP may mediate the action of certain insulin-releasing agents whereas some other agents exert their insulinogenic action via mechanisms in which cyclic AMP may not be involved."
https://openalex.org/W1504370635,"Abstract Isolated liver cells from fasted female rats synthesized glucose in the presence of alanine, lactate, and pyruvate. Epinephrine, norepinephrine, and phenylephrine stimulated gluconeogenesis whereas isoproterenol and salbutamol had no effect on gluconeogenesis from lactate. d- and l-Propranolol had no effect on epinephrine-stimulated gluconeogenesis but blocked cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) accumulation due to epinephrine. Phentolamine had little effect on epinephrine-stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation of gluconeogenesis by liver cells. Phenoxybenzamine also had no effect on epinephrine-stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation but did slightly reduce gluconeogenesis due to epinephrine. Low concentrations of dihydroergotamine decreased epinephrine- and norepinephrine-stimulated gluconeogenesis but did not alter that due to dibutyryl cyclic AMP or glucagon. Dihydroergotamine did not reduce the increase in cyclic AMP accumulation due to epinephrine. Isoproterenol alone increased cyclic AMP but did not stimulate gluconeogenesis nor block the effect of epinephrine. Cycloheximide and dactinomycin did not inhibit epinephrine-stimulated gluconeogenesis by the cells. The fairly rapid onset of epinephrine stimulation of gluconeogenesis and the results with inhibitors suggest that RNA and protein synthesis are not required for the epinephrine action. The data also indicate that the increase in cyclic AMP accumulation due to epinephrine is apparently unrelated to its stimulation of gluconeogenesis in rat liver cells."
https://openalex.org/W1582171705,Abstract Rats treated with vitamin D3 show decreased levels of liver calciferol-25-hydroxylase activity. The extent of the depression and its persistence are related to the dose of vitamin D3. The decrease in enzyme activity measured in vitro cannot be accounted for by dilution of the labeled substrate by unlabeled vitamin D3 remaining in the liver. The in vitro decrease is reflected in vivo by a decrease in the rate and extent of appearance of 3H-labeled 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 in the blood and liver following a dose of 3H-labeled vitamin D3 administered to rats pretreated with unlabeled vitamin D3. These data show the existence of a mechanism which regulates the activity of the rat liver calciferol-25-hydroxylase.
https://openalex.org/W1663808526,"Abstract 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, the rate-controlling enzyme of cholesterol biosynthesis in rat liver, has been solubilized and purified 130-fold from rat liver microsomes. Evidence is presented to suggest that the enzyme is localized to the surface of the microsomal membrane. 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase can be removed from microsomes by mild treatments such as exposure to high salt or glycerol concentrations which leave the bi-laminar structure of the microsomal membrane intact. The solubilized enzyme is rapidly inactivated by chilling to 4° and is protected from this cold-induced inactivation by salt only at concentrations in the range of 4 m. 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase is the first solubilized microsomal enzyme reported to be cold-sensitive."
https://openalex.org/W1678484927,"Abstract We have found that d-amino acid oxidase is rapidly and irreversibly inhibited by cyanide during oxidative turnover of the carbanion of nitroethane. The inhibited enzyme has an absorption spectrum which is characteristic of a covalent flavin-substrate adduct. The following summarizes the results and interpretation of experiments which establish the mechanism of cyanide inhibition as well as the chemical mechanism of oxidation of nitroalkanes by d-amino acid oxidase. 1. The kinetic mechanism of oxidation of the nitroethane carbanion (S-) to form acetaldehyde (P), hydrogen peroxide, and nitrite, was deduced from a combination of stopped flow and O2-monitored kinetic measurements and is the following. [see PDF for equation] Evaluation of all the rate and equilibrium constants showed that the major pathway for flavin oxidation is the oxidation of ErP by O2. 2. The rate of inhibition of the enzyme by cyanide is regulated by κ2, and O2 is not consumed during the inhibition process. Since the rate of cyanide inhibition increases as the O2 concentration is raised, cyanide does not react with ErP or with a species in rapid equilibrium with ErP. Consequently cyanide must react rapidly with an intermediate, EX, which is formed from E0S in a reaction, or reactions, controlled by κ2. This is depicted kinetically as follows: [see PDF for equation] The inhibited enzyme, EI, does not react with substrate or O2 under the conditions, and within the time scale, of routine kinetic experiments. 3. The inhibited enzyme (EI) contains, per FAD, 1 eq each of substrate and cyanide, but is lacking the nitro group. 4. Treatment of EI with hot methanol produces a free flavin-substrate adduct in good yield and with no irreversible spectral or chemical modification. At 70° and pH values greater than 8 the free flavin-substrate adduct releases cyanide and is readily converted (l10 min) under aerobic conditions to FAD, acetaldehyde, and, presumably, H2O2. Anaerobically, FADH2 is produced. These solvent-catalyzed reactions of the adduct in large part mimic the enzyme-catalyzed oxidation of the substrate. 5. The spectral and ionization properties, as well as the chemical reactivity, of the free flavin-substrate adduct closely resemble those of 5-substituted dihydroflavins in general, and those of 5-cyanomethyl-1,5-dihydroflavin in particular. For these reasons we assign the structure 5-cyanoethyl-1,5-dihydro-FAD to the free flavin-substrate adduct. The kinetic turnover mechanism, the locus of action of cyanide, and the structure of the free flavin-substrate adduct, taken together, enable us to propose a detailed chemical mechanism for the oxidation of nitroethane carbanion by d-amino acid oxidase. E0S is a noncovalent complex in which the substrate carbanion is sufficiently close to the flavin (presumably the N5 position) to perturb the electronic properties of the latter. Attack of the carbanion at N5 of the flavin is controlled by κ2 and results in the formation of 5-nitroethyl-1, 5-dihydro-FAD. Elimination of nitrite forms a highly reactive cationic imine (EX) at the N5 flavin position to which solvent adds to [see PDF for equation] form a carbinolamine. Finally, FADH2, is eliminated from the carbinolamine, leaving acetaldehyde (P) noncovalently bound to Er. Cyanide attacks the cationic imine (EX) in competition with solvent to form 5-cyanoethyl-1,5-dihydro-FAD (EI). This adduct is not reactive with O2 under conditions normally used to study the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1540276158,"Abstract In isolated hepatocytes prepared from unfed neonatal chicks, stimulation of fatty acid synthesis by fructose or dihydroxyacetone required acetate or octanoate in the medium, suggesting that the stimulatory effect of these compounds required the enhanced production of intramitochondrial acetyl coenzyme A. Stimulation of fatty acid synthesis by lactate or pyruvate did not require a supplementary substrate. Distribution of acetyl-CoA synthetase was 80% intramitochondrial and 20% cytosolic. However, sufficient acetate could be activated in the cytosol to accommodate the most rapid rates of fatty acid synthesis observed in isolated cells. This was shown experimentally by an undiminished rate of incorporation of [1-14C]acetate plus [12C]lactate or [12C]fructose into fatty acids when ATP-citrate lyase was inhibited by (-)-hydroxycitrate. The citrate content of the isolated cells was positively correlated with fatty acid synthesis under all incubation conditions. The ATP content of the cells did not correlate with fatty acid synthesis. Fatty acyl-CoA and α-glycerophosphate levels only partially correlated with fatty acid synthesis. Hence, citrate appears to be an important determinant in the regulation of fatty acid synthesis in intact liver cells, probably via its ability to activate acetyl-CoA carboxylase. Inhibition of fatty acid synthesis by free fatty acids was reversible, did not increase with time of incubation, and was not relieved by simultaneous incubation with the inhibitor of fatty acid oxidation, (+)-decanoylcarnitine. Thus, the active inhibitor was not a stable product of the esterification of fatty acids nor a product of the oxidation of fatty acids. Inhibition of fatty acid synthesis by medium free fatty acids was accompanied by an increase in the fatty acyl-CoA level. Fatty acyl-CoA may inhibit fatty acid synthesis by directly inhibiting acetyl-CoA carboxylase or by inhibiting the mitochondrial citrate carrier and, thereby, reducing the activation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase caused by citrate."
https://openalex.org/W1607710027,"Abstract A unique acid-soluble basic protein was detected in the testes of sexually mature rats and a number of other mammalian species. This protein was not found in comparable acid extracts prepared from many other rat organs or from the testes of juvenile rats. It makes its appearance only after spermatids are evident in normally developing testes and is absent from the gonads of male rats rendered artificially cryptorchid for periods of 10 days or longer. This protein was purified extensively and was found to be devoid of phenylalanine, tryptophan, glutamic acid, glutamine, isoleucine, and cyst(e)ine. The specific basic protein from rat testes could not be extracted from epididymal sperm by a variety of procedures. In contrast, certain techniques reproducibly extracted from both epididymal spermatozoa and whole testis a highly basic protein fraction that is strikingly rich both in arginine and cyst(e)ine."
https://openalex.org/W1489679748,"The novel heme prosthetic group of Escherichia coli NADPH-sulfite reductase (EC 1.8.1.2) has been identified as an iron tetrahydroporphyrin of the isobacteriochlorin type (adjacent pyrrole rings reduced) with eight carboxylic acid side chains. The number of carboxyl groups was established by the following experiments. Esterification with 14CH3OH resulted in incorporation of 7.4 moles of 14C per mole of heme. The fragmentation pattern of the demetallized heme (porphin) methyl ester and a comparison of the heaviest mass peaks of the porphin ethyl and methyl esters was consistent with the presence of eight carboxylate ester side chains. The porphin methyl ester migrated similarly to uroporphyrin I octamethyl ester in two thin layer chromatographic systems. The reduction state of the porphin nucleus was determined as follows. The infrared spectrum of the porphin ethyl ester showed a band at 1603 cm-1, characteristic of reduced porphins. The absorption spectra of the porphin ester (λmax (ratios) = 378 (3.3), 510 (0.37), 545 (0.67), 588 (1.00), 638 (0.15) nm) in neutral or basic media and its tin, copper, and zinc derivatives were similar to those of synthetic isobacteriochlorins and their corresponding metal derivatives. The porphin in neutral solvents exhibited an intense orange fluorescence (λmax = 597 and 640 nm for emission) indicating the presence of a cyclically conjugated porphin macrocycle. The tin porphin ester was not photoreduced under conditions which led to conversion of tin uroporphyrin octamethyl ester to the tetrahydro derivative. Precise molecular masses of several derivatives of the sulfite reductase porphin yielded a unique empirical formula for each derivative; these formulas, when restricted to a porphin with eight carboxylate side chains, require the porphin nucleus to be at the tetrahydro or more reduced level. No formulas compatible with octacarboxylate porphyrins or chlorins could be obtained. The empirical formula for the sulfite reductase heme is FeC42H44N4O16 (z ligands not included). It is suggested that the compound is an iron-containing methylated urotetrahydroporphyrin."
https://openalex.org/W1617969396,"SUMMARY The conversion of [I-Wllignoceric acid (tetracosanoic acid) into cerebronic acid (Z-hydroxytetracosanoic acid) by a cell-free preparation of rat brain was investigated. The a-hydroxylating enzyme required molecular oxygen, Mg++, pyridine nucleotides, and a heat stable water soluble cofactor. The activity had pH optimum of ‘7.8, and the K, value for lignoceric acid was found to be 4.2 pM. The presence of CO did not inhibit the activity. Except for Mgf+, all heavy divalent metal ions were strongly inhibitory. EDTA was also strongly inhibitory. The pyridine nucleotides DPNH and TPNH were equally effective in producing full enzyme activity; their oxidized forms were less effective. The product cerebronic acid was detected only as a component of ceramide or cerebroside and not as free acid or CoA ester. There was no detectable activity in rat brain during the first 6 days after birth, but a rapid increase was noted between the ages of 8 and 21 days. Activity in the brain attained a maximum in rats 21 to 28 days old and then gradually decreased until an age of 85 days was reached. The cerebellum was found to have the greatest activity. No ol-hydroxylating activity was detected in any of the extraneural tissues studied. 2-Hydroxy fatty acids, found in small amounts in certain yeasts, bacteria, and mammalian extraneural tissues (l), are uniquely abundant in the mammalian nervous system. The 2hpdroxy acids found in the nervous system consist mainly of both saturated or monounsaturated compounds with a chain length of 22 to 26 carbon atoms. They contain an unusually high concentration of odd-numbered carbon acids. They were detected exclusively in cerebrosides and sulfatides, which are considered characteristic myelin lipids. Their concentration in the brain increase very rapidly during the period of active myelination and more slowly during the later life of the animal (2)."
https://openalex.org/W1608569125,"Abstract A mutant of Klebsiella aerogenes lacking glutamine (amide):α-ketoglutarate (NADP+) amidotransferase oxidoreductase (glutamate synthetase) cannot grow in minimal media containing ammonia as the only nitrogen source at a concentration lower than 1 mm. In addition, in a glucose containing medium, it fails to utilize amino acids, such as histidine, that are converted to glutamate, as sources of nitrogen. It can use glutamate as source of nitrogen. Revertants were isolated capable of growth on glucose-histidine, but unable to use ammonia. These revertants still lack glutamate synthetase, but produce glutamine synthetase constitutively (glnC-). They fail to produce glutamate dehydrogenase, and thus cannot use ammonia as a nitrogen source. An analysis of the levels of glutamine synthetase, glutamate synthetase, and glutamate dehydrogenase in the parent organism, in mutants lacking glutamine synthetase, and in mutants producing it constitutively, reveals that glutamine synthetase represses the formation of glutamate dehydrogenase. A lack of glutamate synthetase appears to interfere with the derepression of glutamine synthetase. On the other hand, the loss of glutamate dehydrogenase by mutation does not affect glutamine synthetase. These results, together with those reported in an earlier paper (Prival, M. J., Brenchley, J. E., and Magasanik, B. (1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 4334–4344), indicate that glutamine synthetase is the key element in the regulation of the synthesis of enzymes capable of supplying the cell with glutamate."
https://openalex.org/W1534631627,"In the presence of the natural cofactor, tetrahydrobiopterin, rat liver phenylalanine hydroxylase has a sigmoidal saturation curve (Hill coefficient 2.0) for phenylalanine concentration versus initial velocity. Lysolecithin or α-chymotrypsin increases the maximum velocity 20-fold, decreases the Km for phenylalanine by 50%, and converts the phenylalanine-saturation curve from the sigmoidal to the hyperbolic form. Lysolecithin and the phenylalanine hydroxylase stimulator increase the hydroxylase activity in a synergistic fashion. Lysolecithin also stimulates the hydroxylation of tryptophan (to 5-hydroxytryptophan) and the hydroxylation of meta-tyrosine (to 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine) by highly purified phenylalanine hydroxylase. Lysolecithin stimulates para-tyrosine-dependent TPNH oxidation by the hydroxylase without hydroxylation of the para-tyrosine. Lysolecithin exposes a sulfhydryl group of the hydroxylase and therefore appears to alter the conformation of the enzyme. Chymotrypsin, in contrast, partially hydrolyzes the hydroxylase, reducing its size from a dimer with a molecular weight of 100,000 (composed of two 50,000 molecular weight subunits) to a dimer with a molecular weight of 67,000 (composed of two 35,000 molecular weight subunits)."

https://openalex.org/W113412448,"Abstract The interaction of catecholamines with the β-adrenergic receptor and activation of adenylate cyclase were studied with plasma membranes prepared from turkey erythrocytes. The apparent affinity of isoproterenol, determined by measuring [3H]isoproterenol, for receptor was virtually identical with the apparent Km for activation of adenylate cyclase by isoproterenol. Binding of catecholamine to receptor was necessary but not sufficient for activation of adenylate cyclase. The dihydroxyphenyl function of the catecholamine molecule was required for binding as well as for activation of adenylate cyclase. The secondary alcohol function at the β-carbon, stereoconfiguration at the β-carbon, and an amine function, primary or secondary, at the α-carbon were functions essential for adenylate cyclase activation but not for specific binding at the catechol site. Those compounds that bound but did not stimulate adenylate cyclase were effective inhibitors of isoproterenol-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity. Propranolol, a β-adrenergic blocker, was a potent inhibitor of adenylate cyclase activity but a weak inhibitor of binding. It was concluded that in addition to catechol-specific binding, a further interaction between plasma membrane and hormone is necessary for activation of adenylate cyclase. This further interaction appears to involve a site specific for the ethanolamine portion of the catecholamine molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1549146902,"Abstract 1. The ability to phosphorylate ADP during oxidation of NADH by ubiquinone-1 was restored to the NADH-ubiquinone reductase complex by combining the latter with phospholipids and a hydrophobic protein fraction derived from bovine heart mitochondria. 2. Phosphorylation was abolished by rotenone, uncoupling agents, or rutamycin. The efficiency of ATP formation was as high as 0.5 mole per mole of NADH oxidized under optimal conditions. 3. Reconstitution of phosphorylation had an absolute requirement for phosphatidylethanolamine and a partial requirement for phosphatidylcholine, a molar ratio of approximately 4:1 being optimal. A much more marked requirement for phosphatidylcholine was observed in the presence of low concentrations of cardiolipin (0.05 to 1.5% of the total phospholipid). In the presence of cardiolipin, an equal molar ratio of phosphatidylethanolamine to phosphatidylcholine gave the highest phosphorylation efficiency. 4. The NADH-ubiquinone reductase complex is oriented in the reconstituted vesicles such that approximately 50% of the molecules can react with added NADH. Reaction of all the molecules with NADH occurs in the presence of 0.5% deoxycholate. 5. Phosphorylation efficiency can be significantly improved by purification of the vesicles on sucrose density gradients."
https://openalex.org/W1601921807,"Abstract It has been shown previously that histidase and proline oxidase of Klebsiella typhimurium escape from the catabolite repression exerted by glucose when the source of nitrogen is growth rate-limiting. We have now found that this escape is related to the cellular level of glutamine synthetase. In cells growing with an excess of ammonia, the level of glutamine synthetase is low, whereas in cells growing on a growth rate-limiting nitrogen source the level of glutamine synthetase is high. Mutations at two chromosomal sites, glnA and glnB result in the loss of glutamine synthetase. In these glutamine-requiring mutants histidase does not escape from catabolite repression, even when the nitrogen source is growth rate-limiting. Most revertants of the glnB mutant regain the ability to produce glutamine synthetase by a mutation in the glnC site, which is closely linked to the glnA site. In the glnC mutants, glutamine synthetase is produced at a high level, even in media containing an excess of ammonia. In glnC mutants histidase and proline oxidase are not subject to catabolite repression, even in media containing glucose and an excess of ammonia."
https://openalex.org/W1583077790,"Abstract Oxidation of nicotine in the presence of rabbit liver 10,000 x g supernatant, NADPH, and cyanide results in the production of 5'-cyanonicotine. NaBD4 reduction of the reaction mixture from a similar incubation of nicotine, NADPH, and supernatant results in the production of deuteronicotine having a single deuterium in the pyrrolidine ring. Oxidation of nicotine to cotinine under 18O2 did not lead to incorporation of 18O in the cotinine produced. These results are explained by the formation of nicotine Δ1'(5') iminium ion as an intermediate in the degradation of nicotine. The formation of the iminium ion is catalyzed by an enzyme system having the properties of a mixed function oxidase. The reaction requires NADPH and O2 and is inhibited by carbon monoxide. It is proposed the nicotine Δ1'(5') iminium ion is formed by loss of water from 5'-hydroxy nicotine. The iminium ion formed from nicotine represents a nicotine analogue with a markedly altered chemical reactivity and must therefore be considered in studies on the physiological action of nicotine."
https://openalex.org/W1547651825,"Abstract Both the adenylylated and unadenylylated forms of Escherichia coli glutamine synthetase catalyze the formation of pyrrolidone carboxylate from glutamate in the presence of ATP and divalent metal ions (Mg++ or Mn++) and in the absence of ammonia. The unadenylylated enzyme catalyzes this reaction more rapidly with Mg++ than with Mn++, while the adenylylated enzyme catalyzes it more rapidly with Mn++ than with Mg++. The rates of pyrrolidone carboxylate formation catalyzed by the two forms of the E. coli enzyme are about the same or higher, relative to the corresponding rates of glutamine synthesis, than that catalyzed by ovine brain glutamine synthetase. Both forms of the E. coli enzyme are inhibited when incubated with methionine sulfoximine, ATP, and either Mg++ or Mn++; the unadenylylated enzyme, which is inhibited to about the same extent with Mg++ as with Mn++, is inhibited more rapidly than the adenylylated enzyme. l-Glutamate protects the unadenylylated enzyme (with Mg++ or Mn++) and the adenylylated form (only with Mn++) against inhibition by methionine sulfoximine. Only one of the four stereoisomers of methionine sulfoximine (l-methionine-S-sulfoximine) inhibits the enzyme. Inhibition is associated with tight binding to the enzyme of 9.2 to 11 moles of methionine sulfoximine phosphate per mole of enzyme. E. coli glutamine synthetase acts at a significant rate on several glutamate analogs that are also substrates of the brain enzyme. The data are in accord with the view that the major reaction pathway of glutamine synthesis catalyzed by the E. coli enzyme is similar to that of the reaction catalyzed by the brain enzyme, and thus involves formation and utilization of enzyme-bound γ-glutamyl phosphate and a tetrahedral intermediate or transient state whose structure is analogous to that of l-methionine-S-sulfoximine phosphate."
https://openalex.org/W1538744914,"Abstract 1. An improved procedure, utilizing affinity chromatography in the final step, has been devised for the purification of the NADP-specific glutamate dehydrogenase of Neurospora crassa. 2. The molecular weight of the native protein is 288,400 by sedimentation-equilibrium measurements. In 6 m guanidine HCl and 0.5% mercaptoethanol, the subunit molecular weight is 48,800, consistent with a native molecule composed of six subunits of identical size. 3. The enzymic activity is abolished by reaction with pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, the reaction occurring preferentially at a single lysine residue. Only one fluorescent spot is observed on tryptic peptide maps of the enzyme inactivated with this reagent and reduced with borohydride. 4. All six of the free sulfhydryl groups in each subunit can be carboxymethylated or carboxamidomethylated with no effect on catalytic activity. 5. Treatment of the enzyme with N-ethylmaleimide results in loss of activity, whether or not the sulfhydryl groups have been previously blocked by carboxymethylation. The pKa of the group involved is 7.60 at 34° and 8.70 at 2°. The calculated heat of ionization is 12.6 ± 2.0 Cal per mole. Present evidence indicates that the reaction with N-ethylmaleimide probably involves the same e-amino group as in the reaction with pyridoxal 5'-phosphate."
https://openalex.org/W1536112481,"Abstract Adrenodoxin reductase and adrenodoxin have been shown to form a complex with a stoichiometric molar ratio of 1:1. The dissociation constant of the complex is found to be approximately 10-9 m in a low ionic strength medium, and approximately 10-6 m in a high ionic strength medium. The reductase is relatively labile upon heat treatment; the adrenodoxin-dependent cytochrome c reductase activity decreases about 80% when reductase is treated at 45° for 15 min. The presence of adrenodoxin largely protects the inactivation. The NADPH-2,6-dichloroindophenol reductase activity of adrenodoxin reductase is stimulated either by the addition of adrenodoxin or by increasing the concentrations of salts. Antiserum prepared against adrenodoxin has no effect on the adrenodoxin-stimulated NADPH-2,6-dichloroindophenol reductase activity. The NADPH-cytochrome c reductase activity of the complex has a maximal activity at an ionic strength of 0.04, and no activity at an ionic strength over 0.4. Antiserum against adrenodoxin completely inhibits this activity. The reductase-adrenodoxin complex has been shown to produce superoxide anion radicals in the presence of NADPH and molecular oxygen. The site responsible for superoxide anion radical generation is predominantly on the iron-sulfur protein. Adrenodoxin reductase, adrenodoxin, or their complex fails to show any indication of a stable stoichiometric complex with partially purified cytochrome P-450, as judged by a Sephadex gel filtration technique."
https://openalex.org/W1607574505,"Abstract The effect of norepinephrine, other catecholamines, phenylethylamines, and β-adrenergic receptor blocking drugs on the incorporation of 32Pi into phospholipids of intact rat pineal glands was studied in organ culture. Individual pineal phospholipids were assayed for radioactivity after separation by two-dimensional thin layer chromatography. Improved chromatographic separations were obtained (Getz, G. S., Jakovcic, S., Heywood, J., Frank, J., and Rabinowitz, M. (1970) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 218, 441–452), if thin layer plates were washed with acetone instead of ether after development in the first solvent system. Addition of l-norepinephrine (0.3 mm) significantly stimulated the incorporation of isotope into phosphatidylinositol within 5 min and into phosphatidylglycerol after 15 min. After 3 hours' incubation, l-norepinephrine and other phenylethylamine derivatives, including d-norepinephrine, epinephrine, dopamine, tyramine, and octopamine stimulated incorporation into phosphatidylglycerol (100 to 500%) and phosphatidylinositol (100 to 200%). Incorporated radioactivity continued to increase for up to 16 hours, but norepinephrine-induced stimulation steadily declined. The stimulating effects of l-norepinephrine were essentially linear from 0.3 mm to 3 µm. No stimulation was observed in the presence of N6, O2'-dibutyryl adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate at a concentration as high as 10 mm. Several substances with widely differing potencies as β-adrenergic receptor blocking agents, including dl,-propranolol, d-propranolol, dichloroisoproterenol, and alprenolol, but not sotalol, increased 32Pi incorporation into pineal acidic phospholipids. However these agents gave a labeling pattern different from that produced by norepinephrine: labeling of phosphatidylglycerol was elevated 1000 to 1500%, of phosphatidylinositol up to 100%, and of phosphatidic acid, 50 to 150%. Neither sotalol nor propranolol prevented the stimulation of phospholipid metabolism caused by norepinephrine. These findings indicate that the increase in phospholipid radioactivity is not related to the formation of melatonin which in the cultured pineal is stimulated by either norepinephrine or N6, O2'-dibutyryl adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate. This conclusion is also supported by the fact that propranolol fails to block enhanced phospholipid labeling whereas it blocks enhanced melatonin formation. The data further indicate that the stimulation of phospholipid metabolism caused by drugs with β-adrenergic receptor blocking activity is not brought about through interaction with β-adrenergic receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1577233937,"Abstract It has been established that hepatic lipogenesis in rats, mice, and chickens is inhibited by cyclic 3':5'-nucleotide monophosphates but their site of action has not previously been determined. Evidence is presented here that cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cAMP) and N6,O2'-dibutyryl cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (dibutyryl cAMP) inhibit the activity of acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase. Dibutyryl cAMP incubated with rat liver slices inhibited both lipogenesis and acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity to about the same extent. The amount of dibutyryl cAMP needed to inhibit acetyl-CoA carboxylase was in the same range as the amount needed to inhibit lipogenesis in rat and chicken liver slices. Inhibition of acetyl-CoA carboxylase by the addition of 1 mm dibutyryl cAMP to the enzyme assay reaction mixture was demonstrable even without preincubation with liver slices. It is concluded that a major portion of the inhibition of lipogenesis in rat liver by cAMP can be attributed to the inhibition of acetyl-CoA carboxylase."
https://openalex.org/W1504059254,"Abstract In the presence of lysolecithin or α-chymotrypsin, rat liver phenylalanine hydroxylase catalyzes the p-tyrosine-dependent oxidation of tetrahydropterin. p-Tyrosine is not hydroxylated during this reaction. Thus, tetrahydropterin oxidation occurs in the absence of hydroxylation of the substrate. For each equivalent of TPNH (or tetrahydropterin) oxidized, 1 equivalent of oxygen is reduced to hydrogen peroxide. Therefore, in the presence of lysolecithin or α-chymotrypsin and p-tyrosine, phenylalanine hydroxylase functions as a tetrahydropterin oxidase."
https://openalex.org/W80964436,"Abstract In extracts of Bacillus subtilis, CO2 fixation occurs primarily through the apparently constitutive enzyme carboxylase, which is strongly activated by acetyl-CoA. This enzyme is necessary for growth on glucose but is not required for sporulation, as was established with a carboxylase mutant. The malic enzyme can use either NAD or, less effectively, NADP as cofactor. The ratio of these activities remains constant through enzyme purification and during enzyme induction by l-malate. Enzyme synthesis is not repressed by glucose. Malic enzyme and carboxylase form a pyruvate shunt to the citric acid cycle, which apparently is necessary during growth on malate for the production of oxalacetate in substrate amounts; malic dehydrogenase functions mainly to provide energy via the citric acid cycle. A specific and sensitive [γ-32P]ATP assay for P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase has been developed. Using this assay, a purified enzyme preparation gave a Km for oxalacetate of about 25 µm. Enzyme synthesis is repressed by glucose. P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase mutants have established that the enzyme is needed for gluconeogenesis and, under normal growth conditions, for sporulation. Sporulation can be restored by the continuous feeding of gluconate."

https://openalex.org/W1549293240,"Abstract Three forms of cytoplasmic tyrosine aminotransferase (l-tyrosine:2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase, EC 2.6.1.5) were separated and purified from rat liver by the use of CM-Sephadex chromatography. The three forms chromatographed as a single band on Sepharose gel filtration, were each approximately half-saturated with coenzyme, and were denaturated at identical rates at 75°. These findings, together with the demonstration that the enzyme forms are immunologically identical on gel diffusion analysis, indicate that the three forms are neither the result of aggregation nor the products of multiple genes. When aminotransferase synthesis was induced with hydrocortisone, insulin, or dibutyryl cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate, the fraction designated as form I was predominant; the various hormonal inducers do not induce synthesis of different forms of the enzyme. The relative proportions of the three forms changed markedly during the hydrocortisone induction cycle, with form I predominant in the early, synthetic phase and form III predominant in the degradative phase. Polysome-bound aminotransferase was 95% form I. These findings suggest that form I may be the immediate product of enzyme synthesis, and that forms II and III arise from post-translational modification of form I. In vivo labeling with isotopic amino acids indicated rapid interconversion of the three forms. Conversion in vitro of forms II and III to form I could be accomplished in soluble liver extracts, and conversion of form I to forms II and III was observed in liver homogenates supplemented with potassium cyanate. A role of the post-translational modification, perhaps involving carbamylation, in turnover of the enzyme is suggested."
https://openalex.org/W1513487157,"Treatment of rat striatal soluble tyrosine hydroxylase with limited tryptic digestion results in a marked alteration in molecular weight of the enzyme and a concomitant increase in enzymatic activity. Sucrose density gradient centrifugation yields a sedimentation coefficient of 9.2 S for native brain tyrosine hydroxylase, and 3.7 S for the trypsin-treated enzyme. The activation of brain tyrosine hydroxylase concomitant with the molecular weight change occurs through a decrease in Km for both substrate and cofactor. At the same time, heparin, which activates the native striatal enzyme (Ka = 9 µg per ml), inhibits the trypsin-treated enzyme competitive with tyrosine (Ki = 19 µg per ml). It is suggested that the native soluble striatal enzyme may exist in a conformationally constrained, relatively inactive state, and that activation may be achieved by interaction with specific mucopolysaccharides. Further, comparison of the kinetic properties of brain tyrosine hydroxylase with the adrenal enzyme suggests the existence of organ-specific isozymes."
https://openalex.org/W1893933944,"Abstract The enzyme system which converts cholesterol to pregnenolone by side chain cleavage is present in a soluble buffer extract of an acetone powder of adrenal mitochondria. An activation factor remains in the soluble buffer extract after heating at 100° for 2 min, whereas the known components of the P-450 enzyme system are inactivated. The addition of this soluble, heat-stable factor with the active enzyme will enhance pregnenolone formation 5- to 10-fold. The activator is precipitable with acetone, and saturated (NH4)2SO4, is not dialyzable, and is inactivated partially with trypsin. The factor is present in 105,000 x g supernatant but not the microsome fraction. Bovine serum albumin or rat serum does not stimulate. A heat-stable soluble liver cholesterol carrier protein (liver-SCP) has been shown to stimulate cholesterol side chain cleavage using the adrenal mitochondrial enzyme system. The binding properties of the activator with cholesterol on Sephadex G-25 are consistent with its behavior as a carrier protein for cholesterol. Pregnenolone and other adrenal steroids bind less than 1%. Evidence is presented for a cholesterol protein complex which may serve to transport cholesterol within the cell and to participate at the active site for the enzymatic cleavage of the cholesterol side chain."
https://openalex.org/W1612315301,"Abstract Soluble striatal tyrosine hydroxylase undergoes a dramatic increase in affinity for the synthetic cofactor 2-amino-4-hydroxy-6,7-dimethyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropteridine (DMPH4) from 1.5 mm above pH 6 to 0.25 mm below pH 5.7. In the presence of 0.075% Triton X-100, the Km for DMPH4 below pH 5.7 is further reduced to 0.1 mm. The presence of the specific mucopolysaccharide, heparin, which exhibits a Ka of near 10 µg per ml independent of pH, and cooperativity of binding, totally abolishes the pH-dependent change, and alters the Km for DMPH4 to 0.1 mm. Under all conditions, the soluble enzyme exhibits a Km for tyrosine near 56 µm. Solubilization of membrane-bound tyrosine hydroxylase with Triton X-100 yields a form of the enzyme identical with the soluble enzyme in kinetic properties as well as on sucrose density gradients. On the other hand, membrane-bound tyrosine hydroxylase exhibits a Km for DMPH4 near 0.1 mm independent of pH. Further, the membrane-bound enzyme has a Km for tyrosine of 8 to 10 µm. The data are consistent with a highly cooperative conformational transition as the pH is raised from 5.7 to 6.0, which is prevented by the presence of heparin, or by the binding of tyrosine hydroxylase to membrane components. Further, the observation that synaptic membrane-bound tyrosine hydroxylase exhibits a decreased Km for both tryosine and DMPH4 could provide an alternative mechanism by which newly synthesized transmitter may be preferentially released."
https://openalex.org/W1545321930,"Abstract From ten species of bioluminescent coelenterates we have isolated a membrane-enclosed subcellular particle that is apparently responsible for the bioluminescence in these animals. The animals investigated were species of Obelia and Clytia (from the class Hydrozoa) and species of Renilla, Ptilosarcus, Stylatula, Acanthoptilum, and Parazoanthus (from the class Anthozoa). By electron microscopy the purified particle preparations appear quite homogeneous in size and shape, have a diameter of approximately 0.2 µm, and are enclosed by a unit membrane. The particles contain all of the proteins necessary for producing the typical green bioluminescence (λmax 509 nm) observed in vivo in these animals. These include luciferase, a calcium-triggered photoprotein and a green fluorescent protein. Bioluminescence is evoked from the particles when they are placed in hypotonic solutions of calcium ion. Oxygen is also required for light emission. The color of the light is green, typical of the observed in vivo emissions. The widespread occurrence of these bioluminescent particles among the coelenterates suggest that they represent the cellular site of bioluminescence in these animals. We propose that these subcellular bioluminescent particles or organelles be referred to as lumisomes."
https://openalex.org/W1491056713,"Abstract The specific activity of phenylalanine hydroxylase from rat liver decreases markedly with increasing enzyme concentration when assayed at pH 8.0 with the naturally occurring tetrahydrobiopterin as cofactor. The decrease in specific activity is due to a sharp increase in the apparent Km for tetrahydrobiopterin at higher enzyme concentration, whereas Vmax is unchanged. This protein concentration dependence is relieved by the presence of a protein, phenylalanine hydroxylase-stimulating protein, which has been purified from rat liver (Huang, C. Y., Max, E. E., and Kaufman, S. (1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 4235). The stimulating protein greatly increases the apparent affinity of the hydroxylase for tetrahydrobiopterin, but has no effect on Vmax. Because of its ability to stimulate phenylalanine hydroxylase activity, the stimulating protein served as a valuable probe for the mechanism of action of the hydroxylase. Kinetic and physical studies reported here show that the dependence of specific activity on enzyme concentration is not due to the existence of different molecular weight forms of phenylalanine hydroxylase having different affinities for tetrahydrobiopterin. Neither is it due to the presence of an inhibitor which is present at a constant ratio to the enzyme. Our data are consistent with the concept that the protein concentration dependence of the specific activity of phenylalanine hydroxylase arises from the peculiar kinetic process of the enzymatic reaction. It is proposed that an intermediate is released from the enzyme during catalysis, which can recombine with the enzyme or break down nonenzymatically to product (or products). The slower nonenzymatic step (relative to the rate of recombination) imposes a limit on the over-all reaction rate, thereby resulting in an apparent enzyme concentration dependence. The proposed role of the stimulating protein is the catalysis of the nonenzymatic step. Our observations also suggest that the intermediate is either a precursor of the quinonoid dihydro form of biopterin or a complex involving biopterin, oxygen, and phenylalanine."
https://openalex.org/W1965917681,"A growing colony of a mutant strain of Neurospora crassa had two morphologically distinct areas which were formed as a result of a rhythmic spore-forming (conidiation) process. The total pyridine nucleotide content of these two areas was the same, but the levels of NADH, NADPH, and NADP were lower in the conidiating area, while the NAD level was higher. These biochemical differences in the adjacent areas of a single colony were only found in newly formed areas, and were not a permanent record. It is not known whether these pyridine nucleotide changes are a result of the conidiation process, or whether they are tied more directly to some underlying metabolic oscillation. However, it is speculated that the changes in the levels of these key coenzymes could have far-reaching effects on many areas of metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1553347074,"Abstract Activity and fluorescence studies have been performed on dihydrofolate reductase from a methotrexate-resistant strain of Escherichia coli B. Whereas the activity of this enzyme does not depend on the sequence of addition of substrate and cofactor, inhibition by methotrexate has been found to be dependent on preincubation conditions, as well as on ionic strength and dihydrofolate concentration. The enzyme exhibits turnover numbers of 1050 ± 50 moles of dihydrofolate reduced per min per mole of methotrexate binding sites on the enzyme in 0.05 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.2 at 25°, and 650 ± 50 in 0.05 m Tris-HCl-0.05 m NaCl, pH 7.2 at 25°. Methotrexate inhibition was found to be competitive, with an apparent Ki of 0.36 nm when the enzyme is preincubated with methotrexate, and 2.4 nm when preincubated with methotrexate and an excess of dihydrofolate. When the enzyme is preincubated with reduced triphosphopyridine nucleotide and methotrexate, the inhibition is essentially stoichiometric and thus only an upper limit of 0.01 nm for Ki can be determined. The dissociation constants for the enzyme-methotrexate complexes were estimated from fluorometric measurements and ranged from 1 to 27 nm as a function of ionic strength."
https://openalex.org/W2020874770,"It is widely held that the tertiary structure of collagen is essential for induction of platelet aggregation. However, we have found that the purified alpha1 chain prepared from denatured chick skin collagen aggregates platelets. This activity appears to be confined to a distinct region of the molecule representing less than 4 percent of the length of the alpha1 chain. Of all of the cyanogen bromide peptides of the alpha1 chain tested, only one (alpha1-CB5) was active. This glycopeptide, devoid of any ordered tertiary structure, contains only 36 amino acids and one residue of O-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-(1 --> 2)-O-beta-D-galactopyranosyloxy-(1 --> 5)-lysine (Glc-Gal-Hyl). Blocking experiments strongly suggest that the Glc-Gal-Hyl is one of the structural determinants involved in collagen-induced platelet aggregation."
https://openalex.org/W1584221307,"Abstract The metabolism of some steroids has been investigated in liver microsomal preparations from male germ-free and conventional rats. Hydroxylation of 4-[4-14C]androstene-3,17-dione in positions 6β and 16α is about 2 and 1.5 times more efficient in germ-free than in conventional rats. The same is true for 6β- and 2α-hydroxylation of 4-[4-14C]pregnene-3,20-dione (about 1.6 and 1.2 times larger, respectively, in germ-free animals), for 18-hydroxylation of 5α-[4-14C]-androstane-3α,17β-diol (about 1.6 times larger in germ-free rats), and for 6β-hydroxylation of lithocholic acid (about 2 times larger in germ-free rats). All these differences are statistically significant (significance level, p l 0.05). Similar differences (although not statistically significant) are also found for 16α-hydroxylation of 4-pregnene-3,20-dione and for 2β- and 2α-hydroxylation of 5α-androstane-3α,17β-diol. The amount of cytochrome P-450 in germ-free animals is 2.53 ± 0.45 nmoles per mg of protein as compared to 1.72 ± 0.04 nmoles per mg of protein in conventional animals (p l 0.005). 5α-Reduction of 4-androstene-3,17-dione, 4-pregnene-3,20-dione and of 7α-[6β-3H]hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one tends to be lower in germ-free than in conventional rats. In contrast to these results, 12α-hydroxylation of 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one and 7α-hydroxylation of [4-14C]-cholesterol are larger in conventional than in germ-free rats. These findings are in accordance with the slower cholesterol and bile acid turnover in germ-free compared to conventional rats."
https://openalex.org/W1531205736,"Abstract Fluorescence and ultrafiltration experiments were performed on dihydrofolate reductase from a methotrexate-resistant strain of Escherichia coli B. These studies demonstrate two reduced triphosphopyridine nucleotide binding sites on the enzyme. When TPNH is bound to dihydrofolate reductase, the enzyme fluorescence is partially quenched and the fluorescence of the bound TPNH is enhanced. The degree of quenching and enhancement is a function of the ionic strength of the buffer. The dissociation constants at pH 7.2 are 0.02 ± 0.01 µm and 0.6 ± 0.1 µm in a buffer of 0.10 m ionic strength, 0.2 ± 0.1 µm and 0.4 ± 0.3 µm in a solution of 0.35 m ionic strength, and 0.3 ± 0.2 µm and 4.0 ± 2.0 µm in 0.55 m ionic strength. The results demonstrate that one of the sites increases its affinity relative to the other in solutions of low ionic strength. Ultrafiltration experiments indicate that the enzyme has two TPNH binding sites in the presence of methotrexate, but fluorometric experiments detect the binding of only 1 mole of TPNH per mole of enzyme. The binding of the 2nd mole of TPNH to the enzyme-methotrexate-TPNH complex does not perturb the TPNH fluorescence. The affinity of the enzyme-TPNH complex for methotrexate is greater than that of the enzyme alone."
https://openalex.org/W1511349427,"Abstract There are two pyridine nucleotide turnover pathways in Escherichia coli, the Gholson turnover cycle, with nicotinamide as an intermediate, and a second new pathway which does not involve nicotinamide. In exponentially growing cultures with a generation time of 60 min, the rates of these cycles are 39 and 102 molecules per s per cell, respectively. We suggest that this second, heretofore undescribed turnover cycle proceeds with nicotinamide mononucleotide as the first intermediate, possibly formed by the DNA ligase-catalyzed cleavage of DPN."
https://openalex.org/W1545164422,"Abstract FAD photosensitizes its own oxidation and that of d-amino acid oxidase. First order photoinactivation of the enzyme is paralleled by losses of cysteine, histidine, tyrosine, lysine, and, at saturating levels of FAD, tryptophan. Minimal photo-oxidation of methionine has also been found with illuminated enzyme samples. Native and partially photoinactivated enzyme have the same pH activity profile and Km values for d-alanine and for FAD from pH 8 to 10. The degree of photoinactivation correlates with the number of catalytically inactive enzyme molecules. Hence, an all-or-none inactivation is indicated. The binding ability of photoinactivated enzyme for benzoate (a substrate-competitive inhibitor) diminishes, while no changes in FAD-binding stoichiometry occur. This indicates that photochemical modification of the substrate-binding site is a cause of photoinactivation. Under conditions such that the native oxidase exists only as a monomer, the light-treated enzyme consists of monomer, dimer, tetramer, and polymer (or polymers). The remaining activity is associated only with the monomeric units, which are probably mixtures of fully active and completely inactivated monomer. Decrease in specific activity of the monomeric units isolated from partially photoinactivated enzyme is concomitant with partial photo-oxidation of cysteine and tyrosine only. Limited amounts of benzoate were found to slow down the photoinactivation by protecting tyrosyl residues. Hence, there are probable involvements of cysteinyl and tyrosyl residues in the catalytic activity of d-amino acid oxidase. Photoinactivation of oxidase is temperature dependent. From the biphasic Arrhenius plot with a transition point at 15°, values of energy of activation were calculated as 8.2 Cal per mole above and 11.0 Cal per mole below this transi tion."
https://openalex.org/W1481243672,"Abstract To test the hypothesis that the chemical composition and physical properties of an enzyme determine its rate of degradation in vivo, the tyrosine aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.5) of cultured H-35 cells was induced in the presence of amino acid analogs. Supplementation of tryptophan-free medium with 4-, 5-, or 6-fluorotryptophan yielded enzymes which at 64° denatured 1.2-, 2.2-, or 4.7-fold, respectively, more rapidly than the native enzyme. The degree of change in heat stability was concentration-dependent for each analog. Immunochemical titration revealed that the fluorotryptophan-containing enzyme also had less catalytic capacity per molecule than the native enzyme. With a double isotope technique the rates of degradation of the native enzyme and the 6-fluorotryptophan-containing enzyme were measured simultaneously; both aminotransferases were degraded with half-lives of about 2 hours. Hence, an analog-induced change in physical properties, sufficient to cause marked alteration in heat stability and catalytic capacity, did not change the rate of enzyme degradation in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1580604607,"Abstract The conversion of [4,8,12,16-14C]geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate to prelycopersene pyrophosphate and lycopersene by purified bakers' yeast squalene synthetase is reported. The identification of the products of this reaction has been achieved through co-chromatography with authentic samples on thin layer plates and gas-liquid chromatography with authentic samples of either the original compound or a derivative. Further proof of the identities of these compounds has been obtained from their mass fragmentation patterns. Lycopersene is formed from [4,8,12,16-14C]geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate in the presence of the yeast enzyme, NADPH, and Mg2+. NADH is less than 10% as effective as NADPH in this reaction. The formation of prelycopersene pyrophosphate from [4,8, 12,16-14C]geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate by squalene synthetase is markedly increased in the absence of NADPH and the presence of Mg2+ or Mn2+. The product of this reaction is optically active, and it gives a normal optical dextrorotatory dispersion curve. The mass spectrum of this compound shows an intense peak at m/e 544+ which is due to the loss of the pyrophosphate moiety (178 mass units) in the mass spectrometer. The chemical reduction of the product, prelycopersene pyrophosphate, formed by squalene synthetase by lithium aluminum hydride yields an alcohol. A fragmentation pattern characteristic of a primary alcohol with a molecular ion at m/e 562+, which corresponds to a molecular formula of C40H65OH was obtained on mass spectral analysis. Further proof of this structure was obtained from the mass spectrum of the trimethylsilyl ether derivative. A molecular ion peak was obtained at m/e 634+. The presence and the position of a cyclopropane ring in prelycopersene pyrophosphate was established by the mass spectrum of its catalytically reduced alcohol. Two major losses, due to cleavage of the side chains of the cyclopropane ring, were observed from the molecular ion M+, 576+. The conversion of prelycopersene pyrophosphate to lycopersene occurs in the presence of NADPH and appears to be analogous to the conversion of presqualene pyrophosphate to squalene. A mechanism for the conversion of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate to lycopersene is proposed. This mechanism is based upon the results obtained by Beytia et al. (Beytia, E. D., Qureshi, A. A., and Porter, J. W. (1973) J. Biol Chem. 248, in press) on the mechanism of synthesis of squalene from farnesyl pyrophosphate by yeast squalene synthetase."
https://openalex.org/W1480407041,"Abstract In Escherichia coli, the nicotinamide moiety of pyridine nucleotides may be derived from de novo synthesis of the pyridine ring or through the uptake of either nicotinic acid or nicotinamide. De novo synthesis is the least preferred pathway; it is suppressed if an exogenous source is available. Nicotinamide is kinetically preferred over nicotinic acid; the data are consistent with the hypothesis that nicotinamide can pass through the bacterial membrane much faster than can the charged nicotinic acid, and once inside the cell, the amide is efficiently converted to the acid. Thus even at low concentrations nicotinamide is instantly taken up by cells, but at concentrations of less than 8 x 10-6 m nicotinic acid in the medium, the rate of entry of the nicotinic acid into the cell appears to be the rate-limiting step in the synthesis of pyridine nucleotide from exogenous niacin. Under conditions where sufficient exogenous niacin or nicotinamide is present so that entry into the cell is not limiting, the rate of pyridine nucleotide biosynthesis is apparently regulated by the rate of conversion of nicotinic acid → nicotinic acid mononucleotide, as suggested by Imsande and Pardee ((1962) J. Biol. Chem. 237, 1305). Since the rate of conversion of nicotinamide → nicotinic acid is not regulated, excess nicotinic acid that is formed from nicotinamide is continually excreted into the medium."

These compounds have been isolated and purified by several chromatographic systems, and their identity has been confirmed by mass spectroscopy. Both compounds are utilized by the tomato enzyme system in the formation of phytoene and lycopene.

https://openalex.org/W1534839237,"Abstract 6-Phosphogluconate dehydrogenase from Candida utilis catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of 2-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate. The 3-keto-2-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate, an intermediate of the reaction, is reduced to 2-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate and decarboxylated to 1-deoxyribulose 5-phosphate when incubated with the enzyme and TPNH. The decarboxylation process does not occur in the absence of the reduced coenzyme, which does not have, in this step, an oxidation-reduction role. Since TPNH also has a non-redox role in a tritium exchange reaction catalyzed by the enzyme, it appears that the coenzyme has a multiple role in the mechanism of action of 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase: a redox role in the dehydrogenation and another (or others) role(s) in the decarboxylation and tritium exchange reactions. The hydroxyl group present at carbon 2 of 6-phosphogluconate seems to have a dual role in the mechanism of action of the enzyme: one in the binding of the substrate to the enzyme, another in enhancing the decarboxylation of the dehydrogenation product. These findings are discussed with relations to the mechanism of action of isocitrate dehydrogenase and of the malic enzyme. The enzymatic oxidative decarboxylation of 2-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate is a new step for the metabolism of the metabolic inhibitor 2-deoxyglucose."
https://openalex.org/W1577616776,"Abstract Chorismate synthase was isolated from Neurospora crassa by diethylaminoethylcellulose chromatography, and two peaks of activity were obtained. The enzyme in the first peak had a sedimentation coefficient of ∼10 S and appeared to be an unstable, larger molecular form of the enzyme in the second peak, which was ∼8 S. Both forms of the enzyme required TPNH for activity, and the reactions catalyzed by both exhibited a lag which could be eliminated by prior incubation with the substrate 3-enolpyruvylshikimate 5-phosphate (ES-5-P). No other metabolic effectors were found, but diaphorase stimulated the reaction over 10-fold, suggesting that a flavin-like moiety is involved in the catalytic process. With diaphorase in the assay mixture, prior incubation with both ES-5-P and diaphorase was required to eliminate a remaining lag. The Michaelis constant for TPNH was ∼10 µm. The concentration of ES-5-P necessary to eliminate 50% of the lag was ∼0.1 mm. A chorismate synthaseless mutant, Arom-3, strain 87-5A, appears to carry out a portion of the chorismate synthase reaction but only in the presence of TPNH and diaphorase. A method is described for the preparation of ES-5-P from shikimate with greater than 90% yield. Previous yields were lower due to an inhibition by ADP of the ES-5-P synthetic activity catalyzed by the aromatic complex. Inhibition was eliminated by the addition of an ATP-regenerating system. These results suggest the possibility that the aromatic pathway of N. crassa is regulated by ADP."
https://openalex.org/W1596592816,"Abstract Both tryptophan residues of Escherichia coli thioredoxin were chemically modified to oxindole by a 6-fold molar excess of N-bromosuccinimide at pH 4.0.

It showed complete lack of tryptophan fluorescence, but gave full cross-reaction with antithioredoxin antiserum in double immunodiffusion and precipitin tests. Tryptophan fluorescence titration experiments of the reaction of thioredoxin with N-bromosuccinimide strongly suggested that 1 tryptophan residue could be selectively modified. Addition of a 3-fold molar excess of reagent at pH 4.0 modified a residue which had a quenched fluorescence emission in both the oxidized and reduced form of thioredoxin. This residue was not essential for activity of thioredoxin with thioredoxin reductase. The 2nd tryptophan residue had a quenched tryptophan fluorescence in the oxidized form of thioredoxin but dominated the emission spectrum of the reduced form."
https://openalex.org/W1507231322,"Abstract The effect of niacin starvation has been studied in a niacin-requiring auxotroph of Escherichia coli. If a culture is totally deprived of niacin, cells continue to divide until the total pyridine nucleotide content has fallen from 1.9 x 106 to 1.2 x 105 molecules per cell. During starvation, the relative proportion of the pyridine nucleotides changes greatly: the TPN: DPN ratio increases from 0.30 to over 2.0 and nicotinic acid mononucleotide accumulates until it is present at concentrations comparable to DPN. The changes in the distribution of the pyridine nucleotides suggest that DPN is turning over during niacin starvation and that the normally observed breakdown of TPN to DPN during exponential growth is inhibited. If cells are starved for niacin by balanced growth under limiting concentrations of niacin, less disproportion in the TPN: DPN ratio is observed, and growth occurs with a pyridine nucleotide content as low as 4 x 104 molecules per cell."
https://openalex.org/W1509327666,"Abstract Mutations in two unlinked genes of Neurospora crassa, col-10 and col-3, lead to morphological abnormalities and variant 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenases (EC 1.1.1.44). The purified mutant enzymes have specific activities, 30 units per mg, similar to the wild type 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, but differ in kinetic parameters, isoelectric points, and thermolability. These properties of the heterocaryon 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenases are intermediate between those of the wild type and mutant enzymes. Since the morphology of the mutants is restored to nearly that of wild type in the heterocaryons, there is a correlation between the severity of the 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase and morphological defects. These results suggest that the col-10 and col-3 genes control the structure of Neurospora 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, and that the altered dehydrogenases are responsible for the mutant morphologies."
https://openalex.org/W1603719687,"Abstract The diphosphopyridine nucleotide contents of mouse embryos at various stages of development were determined with an enzymic cycling method. These were 0.07 pmole per individual for unfertilized ova and early one-cell embryos and 0.03 to 0.04 pmole per embryo for embryos at all stages from two-cell through blastocyst. There was no concomitant increase in triphosphopyridine nucleotide content on development from the one-cell to the two-cell stage. Growth of two-cell embryos in vitro for 24 hours in the presence of either nicotinamide or nicotinate (0.8 mm) lead to a 2.5-fold increase in diphosphopyridine nucleotide content. Isotopically labeled nicotinamide, nicotinate, and quinolinate, but not tryptophan were incorporated into pyridine nucleotides by embryos cultured in vitro. Azaserine inhibited pyridine nucleotide synthesis from nicotinate but not from nicotinamide. Nicotinate was more rapidly incorporated into the pyridine nucleotides than was nicotinamide, but the total incorporation after 24 hours was the same for both precursors. The extent of the incorporation of labeled nicotinamide into DPN by preimplantation embryos at all stages was nearly constant for any given 24-hour period. A precipitous increase in incorporation occurred subsequent to the hatching of the blastocyst from the zona; it coincided with the beginnings of embryonic growth. The data permit the conclusion that preimplantation embryos are capable of the de novo synthesis of DPN and that deamidation is not an obligatory step in the biosynthesis of DPN from nicotinamide."
