https://openalex.org/W1973138424,"The notion of mimicking natural structures in the synthesis of new structural materials has generated enormous interest but has yielded few practical advances. Natural composites achieve strength and toughness through complex hierarchical designs that are extremely difficult to replicate synthetically. We emulate nature's toughening mechanisms by combining two ordinary compounds, aluminum oxide and polymethyl methacrylate, into ice-templated structures whose toughness can be more than 300 times (in energy terms) that of their constituents. The final product is a bulk hybrid ceramic-based material whose high yield strength and fracture toughness [ approximately 200 megapascals (MPa) and approximately 30 MPa.m(1/2)] represent specific properties comparable to those of aluminum alloys. These model materials can be used to identify the key microstructural features that should guide the synthesis of bio-inspired ceramic-based composites with unique strength and toughness."
https://openalex.org/W1974420316,"Astrocytes provide metabolic substrates to neurons in an activity-dependent manner. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in this function, as well as its role in synaptic transmission, remain unclear. Here, we show that the gap-junction subunit proteins connexin 43 and 30 allow intercellular trafficking of glucose and its metabolites through astroglial networks. This trafficking is regulated by glutamatergic synaptic activity mediated by AMPA receptors. In the absence of extracellular glucose, the delivery of glucose or lactate to astrocytes sustains glutamatergic synaptic transmission and epileptiform activity only when they are connected by gap junctions. These results indicate that astroglial gap junctions provide an activity-dependent intercellular pathway for the delivery of energetic metabolites from blood vessels to distal neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2072066004,"As the immune system develops, T cells are selected or regulated to become tolerant of self antigens and reactive against foreign antigens. In mice, the induction of such tolerance is thought to be attributable to the deletion of self-reactive cells. Here, we show that the human fetal immune system takes advantage of an additional mechanism: the generation of regulatory T cells (T regs ) that suppress fetal immune responses. We find that substantial numbers of maternal cells cross the placenta to reside in fetal lymph nodes, inducing the development of CD4+CD25 high FoxP3+ T regs that suppress fetal antimaternal immunity and persist at least until early adulthood. These findings reveal a form of antigen-specific tolerance in humans, induced in utero and probably active in regulating immune responses after birth."
https://openalex.org/W2132444666,"Society must respond to the growing demand for cognitive enhancement. That response must start by rejecting the idea that 'enhancement' is a dirty word, argue Henry Greely and colleagues. Stimulants such as methyl-phenidate (Ritalin) and modafinil (Provigil), familiar as treatments for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and narcolepsy respectively, are increasingly used as 'smart drugs' by students and more widely as a boost to intellectual creativity. Should society recognize the demand for cognitive enhancement? The trend has been resisted by some on the grounds of safety, 'medicalization' and social inequality. Nature has been reporting on developments in this area and providing a forum for discussion. The debate continues with a call for acceptance of enhancement as a reasonable goal, and online on Nature Network."
https://openalex.org/W2161938158,"Aeroallergy results from maladaptive immune responses to ubiquitous, otherwise innocuous environmental proteins. Although the proteins targeted by aeroallergic responses represent a tiny fraction of the airborne proteins humans are exposed to, allergenicity is a quite public phenomenon-the same proteins typically behave as aeroallergens across the human population. Why particular proteins tend to act as allergens in susceptible hosts is a fundamental mechanistic question that remains largely unanswered. The main house-dust-mite allergen, Der p 2, has structural homology with MD-2 (also known as LY96), the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-binding component of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 signalling complex. Here we show that Der p 2 also has functional homology, facilitating signalling through direct interactions with the TLR4 complex, and reconstituting LPS-driven TLR4 signalling in the absence of MD-2. Mirroring this, airway sensitization and challenge with Der p 2 led to experimental allergic asthma in wild type and MD-2-deficient, but not TLR4-deficient, mice. Our results indicate that Der p 2 tends to be targeted by adaptive immune responses because of its auto-adjuvant properties. The fact that other members of the MD-2-like lipid-binding family are allergens, and that most defined major allergens are thought to be lipid-binding proteins, suggests that intrinsic adjuvant activity by such proteins and their accompanying lipid cargo may have some generality as a mechanism underlying the phenomenon of allergenicity."
https://openalex.org/W2014250199,"It is well established that electrons can escape from atoms through tunneling under the influence of strong laser fields, but the timing of the process has been controversial and far too rapid to probe in detail. We used attosecond angular streaking to place an upper limit of 34 attoseconds and an intensity-averaged upper limit of 12 attoseconds on the tunneling delay time in strong field ionization of a helium atom. The ionization field derives from 5.5-femtosecond-long near-infrared laser pulses with peak intensities ranging from 2.3 × 10 14 to 3.5 × 10 14 watts per square centimeter (corresponding to a Keldysh parameter variation from 1.45 to 1.17, associated with the onset of efficient tunneling). The technique relies on establishing an absolute reference point in the laboratory frame by elliptical polarization of the laser pulse, from which field-induced momentum shifts of the emergent electron can be assigned to a temporal delay on the basis of the known oscillation of the field vector."
https://openalex.org/W2167977891,"The fermionic Hubbard model plays a fundamental role in the description of strongly correlated materials. We have realized this Hamiltonian in a repulsively interacting spin mixture of ultracold 40 K atoms in a three-dimensional (3D) optical lattice. Using in situ imaging and independent control of external confinement and lattice depth, we were able to directly measure the compressibility of the quantum gas in the trap. Together with a comparison to ab initio dynamical mean field theory calculations, we show how the system evolves for increasing confinement from a compressible dilute metal over a strongly interacting Fermi liquid into a band-insulating state. For strong interactions, we find evidence for an emergent incompressible Mott insulating phase. This demonstrates the potential to model interacting condensed-matter systems using ultracold fermionic atoms."

https://openalex.org/W1993418845,"A high-fat diet causes activation of the regulatory protein c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1) and triggers development of insulin resistance. JNK1 is therefore a potential target for therapeutic treatment of metabolic syndrome. We explored the mechanism of JNK1 signaling by engineering mice in which the Jnk1 gene was ablated selectively in adipose tissue. JNK1 deficiency in adipose tissue suppressed high-fat diet-induced insulin resistance in the liver. JNK1-dependent secretion of the inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 by adipose tissue caused increased expression of liver SOCS3, a protein that induces hepatic insulin resistance. Thus, JNK1 activation in adipose tissue can cause insulin resistance in the liver."
https://openalex.org/W1968034850,"Foudi et al. report a method for monitoring the turnover of hematopoietic stem cells that has several advantages over BrdU labeling. Using drug-inducible expression of a histone 2B–GFP fusion protein, which permits a more sensitive analysis of division history, the authors detect hematopoietic stem cells that cycle at a very slow rate. Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are thought to divide infrequently based on their resistance to cytotoxic injury targeted at rapidly cycling cells1,2 and have been presumed to retain labels such as the thymidine analog 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU). However, BrdU retention is neither a sensitive nor specific marker for HSCs3. Here we show that transient, transgenic expression of a histone 2B (H2B)–green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein in mice has several advantages for label-retention studies over BrdU, including rapid induction of H2B-GFP in virtually all HSCs, higher labeling intensity and the ability to prospectively study label-retaining cells, which together permit a more precise analysis of division history. Mathematical modeling of H2B-GFP dilution in HSCs, identified with a stringent marker combination (L−K+S+CD48−CD150+)4, revealed unexpected heterogeneity in their proliferation rates and showed that ∼20% of HSCs divide at an extremely low rate (≤0.8–1.8% per day)."

This challenges evolutionary models of altruistic cooperation and punishment, which predict that punishment will be beneficial. We compared 10- and 50-period cooperation experiments. With the longer time horizon, punishment is unambiguously beneficial."
https://openalex.org/W1993093440,"Pannexin-1 (Px1) is expressed at postsynaptic sites in pyramidal neurons, suggesting that these hemichannels contribute to dendritic signals associated with synaptic function. We found that, in pyramidal neurons, N -methyl- d -aspartate receptor (NMDAR) activation induced a secondary prolonged current and dye flux that were blocked with a specific inhibitory peptide against Px1 hemichannels; knockdown of Px1 by RNA interference blocked the current in cultured neurons. Enhancing endogenous NMDAR activation in brain slices by removing external magnesium ions (Mg 2+ ) triggered epileptiform activity, which had decreased spike amplitude and prolonged interburst interval during application of the Px1 hemichannel blocking peptide. We conclude that Px1 hemichannel opening is triggered by NMDAR stimulation and can contribute to epileptiform seizure activity."

https://openalex.org/W1987871994,"Female meiotic drive, in which paired chromosomes compete for access to the egg, is a potentially powerful but rarely documented evolutionary force. In interspecific monkeyflower ( Mimulus ) hybrids, a driving M. guttatus allele ( D ) exhibits a 98:2 transmission advantage via female meiosis. We show that extreme interspecific drive is most likely caused by divergence in centromere-associated repeat domains and document cytogenetic and functional polymorphism for drive within a population of M. guttatus. In conspecific crosses, D had a 58:42 transmission advantage over nondriving alternative alleles. However, individuals homozygous for the driving allele suffered reduced pollen viability. These fitness effects and molecular population genetic data suggest that balancing selection prevents the fixation or loss of D and that selfish chromosomal transmission may affect both individual fitness and population genetic load."

https://openalex.org/W2121867073,"Micro-RNAs (miRNAs) are important in regulating cell fate determination because many of their target mRNA transcripts are engaged in cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. DGCR8, Dicer, and Ago2 are essential factors for miRNA homeostasis. Here we show that these three factors have critical roles in osteoclast differentiation and function. Gene silencing of DGCR8, Dicer, or Ago2 by small interfering RNA revealed global inhibition of osteoclast transcription factor expression and function, decreased osteoclastogenesis, and decreased bone resorption in vitro. In vivo, CD11b(+)-cre/Dicer-null mice had mild osteopetrosis caused by decreased osteoclast number and bone resorption. These results suggest that miRNAs play important roles in differentiation and function of osteoclasts in vitro and in vivo. We found a novel mechanism mediating these results in which PU.1, miRNA-223, NFI-A, and the macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor (M-CSFR) are closely linked through a positive feedback loop. PU.1 stimulates miRNA-223 expression, and this up-regulation is implicated in stimulating differentiation and function of osteoclasts through negative regulation of NFI-A levels. Down-regulation of NFI-A levels is important for expression of the M-CSFR, which is critical for osteoclast differentiation and function. NFI-A overexpression decreased osteoclast formation and function with down-regulation of M-CSFR levels. Forced expression of the M-CSFR in M-CSF-dependent bone marrow macrophages from Dicer-deficient mice rescued osteoclast differentiation with up-regulation of PU.1 levels. Our studies provide new molecular mechanisms controlling osteoclast differentiation and function by the miRNA system and specifically by miRNA-223, which regulates NFI-A and the M-CSFR levels."
https://openalex.org/W1967153481,"During cytokinesis, the guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) RhoA orchestrates contractile ring assembly and constriction. RhoA signaling is controlled by the central spindle, a set of microtubule bundles that forms between the separating chromosomes. Centralspindlin, a protein complex consisting of the kinesin-6 ZEN-4 and the Rho family GTPase activating protein (GAP) CYK-4, is required for central spindle assembly and cytokinesis in Caenorhabditis elegans. However, the importance of the CYK-4 GAP activity and whether it regulates RhoA remain unclear. We found that two separation-of-function mutations in the GAP domain of CYK-4 lead to cytokinesis defects that mimic centralspindlin loss of function. These defects could be rescued by depletion of the GTPase Rac or its effectors, but not by depletion of RhoA. Thus, inactivation of Rac by centralspindlin functions in parallel with RhoA activation to drive contractile ring constriction during cytokinesis."
https://openalex.org/W2050032205,"The concerted movement of cells from different germ layers contributes to morphogenesis during early embryonic development. Using an optimized imaging approach and quantitative methods, we analyzed the trajectories of hundreds of ectodermal cells and internalized mesodermal cells within Drosophila embryos over 2 hours during gastrulation. We found a high level of cellular organization, with mesoderm cell movements correlating with some but not all ectoderm movements. During migration, the mesoderm population underwent two ordered waves of cell division and synchronous cell intercalation, and cells at the leading edge stably maintained position. Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling guides mesodermal cell migration; however, we found some directed dorsal migration in an FGF receptor mutant, which suggests that additional signals are involved. Thus, decomposing complex cellular movements can provide detailed insights into collective cell migration."

https://openalex.org/W1999366992,"Widespread sedimentary rocks on Mars preserve evidence of surface conditions different from the modern cold and dry environment, although it is unknown how long conditions favorable to deposition persisted. We used 1-meter stereo topographic maps to demonstrate the presence of rhythmic bedding at several outcrops in the Arabia Terra region. Repeating beds are ∼10 meters thick, and one site contains hundreds of meters of strata bundled into larger units at a ∼10:1 thickness ratio. This repetition likely points to cyclicity in environmental conditions, possibly as a result of astronomical forcing. If deposition were forced by orbital variation, the rocks may have been deposited over tens of millions of years."

https://openalex.org/W2054108659,"Linkage studies often yield intervals containing several hundred positional candidate genes. Different manual or automatic approaches exist for the determination of the gene most likely to cause the disease. While the manual search is very flexible and takes advantage of the researchers' background knowledge and intuition, it may be very cumbersome to collect and study the relevant data. Automatic solutions on the other hand usually focus on certain models, remain ""black boxes"" and do not offer the same degree of flexibility.We have developed a web-based application that combines the advantages of both approaches. Information from various data sources such as gene-phenotype associations, gene expression patterns and protein-protein interactions was integrated into a central database. Researchers can select which information for the genes within a candidate interval or for single genes shall be displayed. Genes can also interactively be filtered, sorted and prioritised according to criteria derived from the background knowledge and preconception of the disease under scrutiny.GeneDistiller provides knowledge-driven, fully interactive and intuitive access to multiple data sources. It displays maximum relevant information, while saving the user from drowning in the flood of data. A typical query takes less than two seconds, thus allowing an interactive and explorative approach to the hunt for the candidate gene.GeneDistiller can be freely accessed at http://www.genedistiller.org."
https://openalex.org/W2010333320,"Accounting for population genetic substructure is important in reducing type 1 errors in genetic studies of complex disease. As efforts to understand complex genetic disease are expanded to different continental populations the understanding of genetic substructure within these continents will be useful in design and execution of association tests. In this study, population differentiation (Fst) and Principal Components Analyses (PCA) are examined using >200 K genotypes from multiple populations of East Asian ancestry. The population groups included those from the Human Genome Diversity Panel [Cambodian, Yi, Daur, Mongolian, Lahu, Dai, Hezhen, Miaozu, Naxi, Oroqen, She, Tu, Tujia, Naxi, Xibo, and Yakut], HapMap [ Han Chinese (CHB) and Japanese (JPT)], and East Asian or East Asian American subjects of Vietnamese, Korean, Filipino and Chinese ancestry. Paired Fst (Wei and Cockerham) showed close relationships between CHB and several large East Asian population groups (CHB/Korean, 0.0019; CHB/JPT, 00651; CHB/Vietnamese, 0.0065) with larger separation with Filipino (CHB/Filipino, 0.014). Low levels of differentiation were also observed between Dai and Vietnamese (0.0045) and between Vietnamese and Cambodian (0.0062). Similarly, small Fst's were observed among different presumed Han Chinese populations originating in different regions of mainland of China and Taiwan (Fst's <0.0025 with CHB). For PCA, the first two PC's showed a pattern of relationships that closely followed the geographic distribution of the different East Asian populations. PCA showed substructure both between different East Asian groups and within the Han Chinese population. These studies have also identified a subset of East Asian substructure ancestry informative markers (EASTASAIMS) that may be useful for future complex genetic disease association studies in reducing type 1 errors and in identifying homogeneous groups that may increase the power of such studies."

The radiative contribution to heat transport is usually assumed to be negligible. Here, we report the near-infrared and optical absorption spectra of silicate perovskite, the main constituent of the lower mantle, to 125 gigapascals. Silicate perovskite remains quite transparent up to the pressures at the core-mantle boundary. Estimates of radiative thermal conductivity derived from these spectra approach 10 watts meter –1 kelvin –1 at lowermost mantle conditions, implying that heat conduction is dominated by radiation. However, the increase in radiative conductivity with temperature ( T ) is less pronounced than expected from a T 3 dependency."

The highly polyunsaturated lipids in brain tissue are susceptible to oxidative damage due to a high level of oxygen consumption and the postmitotic state of neurons.

MPO is an oxidant-generating enzyme that is not present in normal aged brain yet is abundant in amyloid-β plaques in AD brain (14Reynolds W.F. Rhees J. Maciejewski D. Paladino T. Sieburg H. Maki R.A.

MPO reacts with H2O2 to oxidize chloride, producing the potent oxidant, hypochlorous acid. MPO also oxidizes nitrate and tyrosine to produce nitrogen dioxide (NO2.) and tyrosyl radicals that cause lipid peroxidation (16Klebanoff S.J. J.

Therefore, we hypothesized that MPO-generated radicals may generate lipid peroxides in AD brain, contributing to neuronal dysfunction and memory loss. To study the effects of MPO in AD, we turned to mouse models, such as APP23, that overexpresses the human APP751 transgene, developing amyloid plaques (19Sturchler-Pierrat C. Abramowski D. Duke M.

One possible reason for the aberrant expression of human MPO in AD brain lesions may be the insertion of a primate-specific Alu element in the upstream promoter. This Alu element encodes several response elements recognized by members of the nuclear receptor superfamily of ligand-dependent transcription factors, including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ/α, liver X receptor and estrogen receptor, as well as SP1 (20Piedrafita F.J.

To study the effects of human type MPO expression in murine disease models, we created human MPO transgenic mice in which the intact gene was driven by extensive native human promoter elements (36Castellani L.W. Chang J.J. Wang X. Lusis A.J. Reynolds W.F. J. Lipid Res... 2006; 47: 1366-1377Google Scholar). In an earlier study, we crossed the huMPO transgenic mice to the LDL receptor deficient model (LDLR-/-) of atherosclerosis. The human MPO transgene was expressed in foam cell macrophages in atherosclerosis lesions (36Castellani L.W. Chang J.J. Wang X. Lusis A.J. Reynolds W.F. J. Lipid Res... 2006; 47: 1366-1377Google Scholar), leading to increased atherosclerosis, along with hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and obesity (36Castellani L.W. Chang J.J. Wang X. Lusis A.J. Reynolds W.F. J. Lipid Res... 2006; 47: 1366-1377Google Scholar), and increased protein oxidation in lesions (37Wang Z. Nicholls S.J. Rodriguez E.R. Kummu O. Horkko S. Barnard J. Reynolds W.F. Topol E.J. DiDonato J.A. Hazen S.L. Nat. Med... 2007; 13: 1176-1184Google Scholar). In the present study, we crossed the huMPO transgenic mice to the APP23 model. Findings show that the human MPO -463G allele is strongly expressed in astrocytes, and MPO protein is deposited in plaques, leading to increased lipid peroxidation and greater spatial memory impairment. These findings suggest that aberrant expression of human MPO in astrocytes promotes oxidative damage, contributing to neuronal dysfunction. Animals—The APP23 transgenic mice express the human familial AD mutant APP751 isoform with the Swedish double mutation (APPK670N, M671L) under control of the neuronspecific mouse Thy1.2 expression cassette (19Sturchler-Pierrat C. Abramowski D. Duke M. Wiederhold K.H. Mistl C. Rothacher S. Ledermann B. Burki K. Frey P. Paganetti P.A. Waridel C. Calhoun M.E. Jucker M. Probst A. Staufenbiel M. Sommer B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

The MPOG and MPOA mice were created on the C57Bl6/J background. Comparisons between MPOG-APP23 and APP23 mice in water maze studies were carried out with littermates. Transgenic mice carrying the human -463G and A alleles have been previously described (21Reynolds W.F. Kumar A.P. Piedrafita F.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun... 2006; 349: 846-854Google Scholar, 22Kumar A.P. Piedrafita F.J. Reynolds W.F. J. Biol. Chem... 2004; 279: 8300-8315Google Scholar, 36Castellani L.W. Chang J.J. Wang X. Lusis A.J.

Reynolds W.F. Nitric Oxide.. 2005; 13: 42-53Google Scholar). The mice were generated by microinjection of a 32-kb BST11071 restriction fragment into C57BL6/J eggs (22Kumar A.P. Piedrafita F.J. Reynolds W.F. J. Biol. Chem... 2004; 279: 8300-8315Google Scholar). Both transgenes produce functional MPO enzyme, and the cDNA sequences are identical (36Castellani L.W. Chang J.J. Wang X. Lusis A.J. Reynolds W.F. J. Lipid Res... 2006; 47: 1366-1377Google Scholar). The care of the mice, and all procedures in this study, were approved by the Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center Institutional Animal Care and Usage Committee and complied with the National Institutes of Health animal care guidelines. Tissues—Human brain tissue was generously provided by the Harvard Brain Tissue Resource Center (Belmont, MA), Sun Health Research Institute (Sun City, AZ), and the University of California, San Diego. For oxidative lipidomics studies, postmortem human brain samples from control and AD patients were obtained from Bank collection of University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Hospital of the University of Pittsburgh. All procedures were pre-approved and performed according to the protocols established by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee as well as by the Institutional Review Board (human brain samples) of the University of Pittsburgh. Immunohistochemistry—Mouse brain tissue was fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. Free floating sagittal or coronal sections, obtained with a Leica VT1000S vibrating microtome, were incubated with 10% hydrogen peroxide in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min, blocked with 10% goat normal serum for 12 h, and incubated overnight at 4 °C with the following primary antibodies: polyclonal to human MPO (BioDesign, Int. K50891R, Lee Biosciences RPX-80A, Dako A0398, 1:1000), rat monoclonal to GFAP (Calbiochem, 1:1000), mouse monoclonal to Aβ (Signet 4G8 or 6E10, 1:1000), or rabbit polyclonal antibodies generated against mouse MPO (1:1000). Primary antibodies were detected with biotinylated secondary antibodies and avidinconjugated horseradish peroxidase (Vectastain ABC kit, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and detected with peroxidase chromogen (SG (peroxidase substrate) or 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole, Vector Laboratories). Confocal images were obtained with fluorescence-labeled secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes, Alexafluor 488 or 564). All incubations were carried out in phosphate-buffered saline containing 250 mm NaCl and Tween 20 (0.1%). In Situ Hybridization—In situ hybridization on mouse brain sections was carried out with digoxigenin-labeled MPO RNA antisense probes (Allele Biotechnology, San Diego, CA) and detected with anti-digoxigenin antibodies coupled to alkaline phosphatase (Roche Applied Biosystems) and detected with the nitro blue tetrazolium-5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate color substrate. HNE ELISA—To measure levels of HNE in mouse cortical extracts, we used the 4-HNE-histidine ELISA kits from Cell Biolabs according to the protocol supplied with the kit. Protein levels were normalized with BCA-protein reagent (Pierce). Oxidative Lipidomics: Lipid Extraction and Two-dimensional-HPTLC Analysis—Total lipids were extracted from mouse brain using the Folch procedure (40Folch J. Lees M. Sloane Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem... 1957; 226: 497-509Google Scholar). Lipid extracts were separated and analyzed by two-dimensional high performance TLC (HPTLC) (41Kagan V.E. Ritov V.B. Tyurina Y.Y. Tyurin V.A. Methods Mol. Biol... 1998; 108: 71-87Google Scholar). The phospholipid classes in the extracts were separated by two-dimensional-HPTLC on silica G plates (5 × 5 cm, Whatman). The plates were first developed with a solvent system consisting of chloroform:methanol:28% ammonium hydroxide (65:25:5, v/v). After the plate was dried with a forced N2 blower to remove the solvent, it was developed in the second dimension with a solvent system consisting of chloroform:acetone:methanol:glacial acetic acid:water (50:20:10:10:5, v/v). The phospholipids were visualized by exposure to iodine vapors and identified by comparison with authentic phospholipid standards. Lipid phosphorus was determined by a micromethod (42Bottcher C.S.F. Van Gent C.M. Fries C. Anal. Chim. Acta.. 1961; 24: 203-204Google Scholar). Mass Spectra of Phospholipids—The phospholipid mass spectra were analyzed by direct infusion into a linear ion trap mass spectrometer LXQ (Termo Electron, San Jose, CA). Samples after two-dimensional-HPTLC separation were collected, evaporated under N2, re-suspended in chloroform: methanol (1:2, v/v, 20 pmol/μl), and directly used for acquisition of negative-ion ESI mass spectra using a flow rate of 5 μl/min. The electrospray probe was operated at a voltage differential of 5.0 kV in the negative ion mode. Source temperature was maintained at 70 or 150 °C. Mass spectrometry analysis on the ion trap instrument was carried out with a relative collision energy that ranged from 20 to 40% and with an activation q value of 0.25 for CID and a q value of 0.7 for the pulsed-Q dissociation technique. PS molecular species were quantitated by comparing the peak intensities with that of an internal standard (PS17:0/17:0). Isotopic corrections were performed by entering the chemical composition of each species into the Qual browser of Xcalibur (operating system) and using the simulation of the isotopic distribution to make adjustments for the major peaks. Chemical structures of lipid molecular species were confirmed by comparing with the fragmentation patterns presented in Lipid Map Data Base (www.lipidmaps.org). Total Contents of Lipid Hydroperoxides—The total contents of lipid hydroperoxides in major classes of phospholipids were estimated by fluorescence high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) of products formed in a microperoxidase-11-catalyzed reaction with a fluorogenic substrate, Amplex Red (43Kagan V.E. Tyurin V.A. Jiang J. Tyurina Y.Y. Ritov V.B. Amoscato A.A. Osipov A.N. Belikova N.A. Kapralov A.A. Kini V. Vlasova II Zhao Q. Zou M. Di P. Svistunenko D.A. Kurnikov I.V. Borisenko G.G. Nat. Chem. Biol... 2005; 1: 223-232Google Scholar). The phospholipid spots on the silica plates were visualized by spraying the plates with deionized water. The spots were then scraped, and phospholipids were extracted by choloroform:methanol:water (20:10:2, v/v). Extracted phospholipids were divided into aliquots for phosphorus measurements and HPLC analysis. Morris Water Maze—The Morris water maze (44Morris R. J. Neurosci. Methods.. 1984; 11: 47-60Google Scholar) was performed in a white circular pool (120-cm diameter) with smooth vertical sides, filled with water at 22 °C, made opaque with nontoxic white paint. Spatial cues were located on the walls of the room. The escape platform (10-cm diameter) was 1 cm beneath the surface of the water, and midway between the side and center of the pool. The mice were tracked by a camera fixed to the ceiling for digital recordings of the trials that were analyzed by EthoVision software (Noldus Information Technology, Leesburg, VA). Mice were introduced at one of four positions in semi-random order, excluding the platform quadrant, and the time required to find the hidden platform was determined. Mice were allowed 60 s to find the escape platform and remained on the platform for 20 s. If a mouse failed to find the platform in 60 s, it was placed on the platform for 20 s. Each mouse had four trials per day, separated by 15 min, and the trials continued for 7 to 8 consecutive days. For each experimental group, the time required to find the escape platform for the four trials on each day were averaged to provide mean escape latency. EthoVision software was also used to calculate the percent time spent in the target quadrant. Statistical Analysis—Student's t test or analysis of variance (with Fisher's post-hoc least significant difference) was used to determine statistical significance using StatView software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). All data are presented as mean ± S.E. A p value of <0.05 was considered significant. Human MPO Is Expressed in AD, but Mouse MPO Is Not Expressed in the APP23 Model—MPO is virtually absent from normal aged human brain parenchyma (Fig. 1a), yet is present at high levels in some amyloid plaques in AD (Fig. 1b) (14Reynolds W.F. Rhees J. Maciejewski D. Paladino T. Sieburg H. Maki R.A. Masliah E. Exp. Neurol... 1999; 155: 31-41Google Scholar). This finding indicated that certain conditions in AD brain allow aberrant MPO gene expression, raising the possibility that MPO-generated oxidants contribute to AD pathology. These observations led us to investigate whether the mouse MPO gene was similarly expressed in brain tissue in mouse models of AD that overexpress the human amyloid precursor protein (APP). We examined the APP23 model, which expresses the human APP751 cDNA encoding the Swedish double mutations (APPK670N, M671L) linked to familial early onset AD, and driven by the neuron-specific Thy-1 promoter (19Sturchler-Pierrat C. Abramowski D. Duke M. Wiederhold K.H. Mistl C. Rothacher S. Ledermann B. Burki K. Frey P. Paganetti P.A. Waridel C. Calhoun M.E. Jucker M. Probst A. Staufenbiel M. Sommer B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1997; 94: 13287-13292Google Scholar). Aged APP23 mice develop abundant amyloid plaques in the cortex and hippocampus as detected by immunostaining for Aβ (Fig. 1e), but mouse MPO was not detected in these plaques or associated cells (Fig. 1c) using an antibody that detected the protein in bone marrow myeloid precursors (Fig. 1d). As confirmation of this finding, examination of brain sections from another huAPP-overexpressing model, Tg2576, also showed a lack of mouse MPO protein (data not shown). In addition, MPO was not detected in brain from aged wild-type C57Bl6 mice (supplemental Fig. S1A). These observations demonstrate that the mouse MPO gene is not expressed in mouse models of AD, in contrast to human MPO expression in AD tissue. The Human MPO -463G Allele Is Strongly Expressed in APP23 Brain—The detection of MPO in human AD tissue, but not in APP23 brain, indicates differences between human and mouse MPO promoter elements. Earlier studies suggested this differential expression may be due to the Alu element inserted in the human MPO upstream promoter (20Piedrafita F.J. Molander R.B. Vansant G. Orlova E.A. Pfahl M. Reynolds W.F. J. Biol. Chem... 1996; 271: 14412-14420Google Scholar, 22Kumar A.P. Piedrafita F.J. Reynolds W.F. J. Biol. Chem... 2004; 279: 8300-8315Google Scholar, 23Vansant G. Reynolds W.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1995; 92: 8229-8233Google Scholar). To examine this possibility, we utilized human MPO transgenic mouse models that carry the intact native human MPO gene with extensive upstream and downstream flanking regions. Independent transgenic lines were generated carrying either the -463G or A allele (MPOG and MPOA). Both transgenes were shown previously to be expressed appropriately and selectively in bone marrow precursors and subsets of reactive macrophages (36Castellani L.W. Chang J.J. Wang X. Lusis A.J. Reynolds W.F. J. Lipid Res... 2006; 47: 1366-1377Google Scholar). The huMPO transgenic mice were crossed to the APP23 model to yield double transgenics, MPOG-APP23 and MPOA-APP23. Immunohistochemical analysis of sections from 2-year-old MPOG-APP23 mice revealed abundant amyloid plaques in hippocampus and cortex (Fig. 1g) with dense MPO deposition in plaques in the cortex, especially the frontal cortex (Fig. 1f). MPO was also detected in ramified cells in the cortex and striatum. These findings demonstrated that the human MPOG gene is induced in APP23 brain, unlike the mouse MPO gene. The Human MPO -463A Allele Is Not Expressed in APP23 Brain—In the MPOA-APP23 cross, amyloid plaques were abundant throughout the cortex and hippocampus (Fig. 1i), but human MPO was not detected (Fig. 1h). This indicated that the -463A site or other sequence difference prevented MPOA allele expression in APP23 brain. As confirmation that the MPOA transgene is indeed functional, human MPO was detected in bone marrow myeloid precursors from MPOA-APP23 and MPOG-APP23 mice (bone marrow, Fig. 1). Moreover, prior studies detected human MPO in bone marrow cells from MPOG and MPOA transgenics crossed onto the mouse MPO knockout strain to eliminate potential signal from the mouse gene (36Castellani L.W. Chang J.J. Wang X. Lusis A.J. Reynolds W.F. J. Lipid Res... 2006; 47: 1366-1377Google Scholar). In addition, huMPO was previously detected in macrophages in atherosclerotic lesions in both the MPOG-LDLR-/- and MPOA-LDLR-/- crosses (36Castellani L.W. Chang J.J. Wang X. Lusis A.J. Reynolds W.F. J. Lipid Res... 2006; 47: 1366-1377Google Scholar). These findings indicate that the -463G/A polymorphism or other sequence differences results in selective expression of the human MPO-G allele in APP23 brain. MPO Colocalizes with Aβ in Plaques in Human AD and Transgenic APP23 Brain—Confocal fluorescence microscopy of human AD tissue showed that MPO colocalizes with Aβ. In the example shown in Fig. 2a, MPO colocalizes with Aβ in the core of a plaque and was present in cytoplasmic vesicles in two cells embedded in a halo of Aβ-staining material surrounding the core (Fig. 2a, top panels), consistent with our prior study (14Reynolds W.F. Rhees J. Maciejewski D. Paladino T. Sieburg H. Maki R.A. Masliah E. Exp. Neurol... 1999; 155: 31-41Google Scholar). In the MPOG-APP23 model, MPO similarly colocalized with Aβ in plaques and was detected in the walls of blood vessels traversing the plaques (Fig. 2a, lower panels). These findings showed that MPO is deposited along with Aβ in plaques in huMPO-APP23 brain as in human AD. MPOG Is Expressed in Astrocytes in APP23 Mouse Brain—Confocal fluorescence microscopy was used to identify cells expressing human MPO in APP23 brain. Surprisingly, confocal images clearly showed MPO to be present in astrocytes, colocalizing with glial fibrillary associated protein (GFAP) (Fig. 2b). GFAP was predominantly localized to thick projections off the cell body, whereas punctate MPO immunostaining was present throughout the cell body and in finer ramifications. Although the great majority (∼95%) of MPO-positive cells clearly costained for GFAP, only a fraction (∼5%) of GFAP-positive astrocytes costained for MPO, as illustrated by the GFAP-positive astrocyte projections in the background of Fig. 2b, which lack MPO staining. Conventional immunostaining similarly detected MPO in only a subset of GFAP-positive astrocytes (Fig. 2c, top panels). In situ hybridization confirmed the presence of huMPO mRNA in astrocytes that costained for GFAP (Fig. 2c, lower panels). We found no convincing evidence for colocalization of MPO with markers for microglia (CD68, CD11b) or neurons (NeuN), although faint signals were occasionally observed such that this possibility has not been ruled out (data not shown). MPO Is Expressed in Astrocytes in Human AD Brain—The unexpected finding of MPO in astrocytes in the MPOG-APP23 mouse model led us to investigate whether astrocytes express MPO in human AD brain tissue. Most MPO protein in AD brain is present in extracellular plaques, although earlier studies detected MPO in a few CD68-positive microglia (14Reynolds W.F. Rhees J. Maciejewski D. Paladino T. Sieburg H. Maki R.A. Masliah E. Exp. Neurol... 1999; 155: 31-41Google Scholar) and some neurons (15Green P.S. Mendez A.J."
https://openalex.org/W1984978532,"Granzymes are serine proteases stored in cytolytic granules of cytotoxic lymphocytes that eliminate virus-infected and tumor cells. Little is known about the molecular mechanism and function of granzyme (Gr)K. GrK is similar to GrA in that they are the only granzymes that display tryptase-like activity. Both granzymes induce cell death by single-stranded nicking of the chromosomal DNA by cleaving the same components of the endoplasmic reticulum-associated SET complex. Therefore, GrK may provide a backup and failsafe mechanism for GrA with redundant specificity. In the present study, we addressed the question of whether GrK displays identical substrate specificity as GrA. In peptide- and protease-proteomic screens, GrK and GrA displayed highly restricted substrate specificities that overlapped only partially. Whereas GrK and GrA cleave SET with similar efficiencies likely at the same sites, both granzymes cleaved the pre-mRNA-binding protein heterogeneous ribonuclear protein K with different kinetics at distinct sites. GrK was markedly more efficient in cleaving heterogeneous ribonuclear protein K than GrA. GrK, but not GrA, cleaved the microtubule network protein β-tubulin after two distinct Arg residues. Neither GrK cleavage sites in β-tubulin nor a peptide-based proteomic screen revealed a clear GrK consensus sequence around the P1 residue, suggesting that GrK specificity depends on electrostatic interactions between exosites of the substrate and the enzyme. We hypothesize that GrK not only constitutes a redundant functional backup mechanism that assists GrA-induced cell death but that it also displays a unique function by cleaving its own specific substrates.

We hypothesize that GrK not only constitutes a redundant functional backup mechanism that assists GrA-induced cell death but that it also displays a unique function by cleaving its own specific substrates. Important players in the immune defense against tumor cells and virus-infected cells are cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells (1Lieberman J. Nat. Rev. Immunol.. 2003; 3: 361-370Google Scholar, 2Chowdhury D. Lieberman J. Annu. Rev. Immunol.. 2008; 26: 389-420Google Scholar). These immune cells predominantly destroy their target cells by releasing the content of their cytolytic granules, containing the pore-forming protein perforin and a set of serine proteases known as granzymes. In humans, five different granzymes (GrA, GrB, GrH, GrK, and GrM) 2The abbreviations used are: Gr, granzyme; 2D-DIGE, fluorescent two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis; hnRNP K, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K; MS, mass spectrometry; SA, serine to alanine mutation; Chaps, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. have been identified that all induce cell death by cleaving critical intracellular substrates. Although GrA and GrB have been extensively studied, little is known about the functions and mechanisms of the other granzymes. The GrA cell death pathway is characterized by single-stranded DNA damage, apoptotic morphology, mitochondrial dysfunction, and loss of cell membrane integrity and occurs independent of caspases and the GrB-induced apoptotic routes (1Lieberman J.

Müllbacher A. Anel A. Simon M.M. J. Cell Biol.. 2004; 167: 457-768Google Scholar). GrA is targeted inside the mitochondrion (6Martinvalet D. Dykxhoorn D.M. Ferrini R. Lieberman J. Cell.. 2008; 133: 681-692Google Scholar), where it triggers an increase in reactive oxygen species and loss of transmembrane potential (3Martinvalet D. Zhu P. Lieberman J. Immunity.. 2005; 22: 355-370Google Scholar, 5Pardo J. Bosque A. Brehm R. Wallich R. Naval J. Müllbacher A. Anel A. Simon M.M. J. Cell Biol.. 2004; 167: 457-768Google Scholar). After mitochondrial damage, GrA targets a 270–440-kDa endoplasmic reticulum-associated complex (SET complex) that contains three GrA substrates, i.e. nucleosome assembly protein SET (4Fan Z. Beresford P.J. Oh D.Y. Zhang D. Lieberman J. Cell.. 2003; 112: 659-672Google Scholar), DNA-binding protein HMG-2 (7Fan Z. Beresford P.J. Zhang D. Lieberman J. Mol. Cell.

Immunol.. 2003; 4: 145-153Google Scholar). Cleavage of SET by GrA allows the SET complex component DNase NM23H1 to make single-stranded nicks in the chromosomal DNA. GrA also facilitates DNA damage by cleavage of Ape1 and the double-stranded DNA repair protein Ku70 (9Zhu P. Zhang D. Chowdhury D. Martinvalet D. Keefe D. Shi L. Lieberman J. EMBO Rep.. 2006; 7: 431-437Google Scholar). GrA is a highly specific serine protease in that only ∼10 substrates have been identified and verified as physiological substrates within cells (1Lieberman J. Nat. Rev. Immunol.. 2003; 3: 361-370Google Scholar, 2Chowdhury D. Lieberman J. Annu. Rev. Immunol.. 2008; 26: 389-420Google Scholar). Far less is known about the molecular mechanism and function of GrK. GrK is similar to GrA in that they are closely linked on the same chromosome and that they are the only granzymes that display tryptase-like activity, i.e. both granzymes cleave after basic residues Arg and Lys (10Mahrus S. Craik C.S. Chem. Biol.. 2005; 12: 567-577Google Scholar). This tryptase-like activity contributes to cytotoxic lymphocyte-induced target cell death (11Carter C.R. Sayers T.J. Wiltrout R.H.

GrA-deficient mice or cytotoxic lymphocytes thereof have normal expression levels of GrK and display almost normal cytolytic activity against tumor targets (12Shresta S. Goda P. Wesselschmidt R. Ley T.J. J. Biol. Chem.. 1997; 272: 20236-20244Google Scholar, 13Davis J.E. Smyth M.J. Trapani J.A. Eur. J. Immunol.. 2001; 31: 39-47Google Scholar). Therefore, it is believed that GrK provides a backup and failsafe mechanism for GrA with redundant specificity. Indeed, recent investigations have indicated that GrK induces cell death with similar hallmarks as GrA. GrK triggers rapid caspase-independent cell death with nuclear morphological changes, single-stranded DNA nicks, and reactive oxygen species production from mitochondria (3Martinvalet D. Zhu P. Lieberman J. Immunity.. 2005; 22: 355-370Google Scholar, 14Zhao T. Zhang H. Guo Y. Zhang Q. Hua G. Lu H. Hou Q. Liu H. Fan Z. Cell Death Differ.. 2007; 14: 489-499Google Scholar, 15MacDonald G. Shi L. Vande Velde C. Lieberman J. Greenberg A.H. J. Exp. Med.. 1999; 189: 131-144Google Scholar). Like GrA, GrK efficiently cleaves the SET complex components ApeI, HMG2, and SET, allowing the DNase NM23H1 to make single-stranded nicks in the chromosomal DNA (7Fan Z. Beresford P.J. Zhang D. Lieberman J. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 2002; 22: 2810-2820Google Scholar, 8Fan Z. Beresford P.J. Zhang D. Xu Z. Novina C.D. Yoshida A. Pommier Y. Lieberman J. Nat.

Fan Z. Greer E.L. Russo M.L. Jaju M. Lieberman J. J. Biol. Chem.. 2001; 276: 43285-43293Google Scholar). GrK cleaves SET, ApeI, and HMG2 with similar degradation fragments as GrA, strongly suggesting that GrK and GrA cleave these proteins at the same sites (14Zhao T. Zhang H. Guo Y. Zhang Q. Hua G. Lu H. Hou Q. Liu H. Fan Z. Cell Death Differ.. 2007; 14: 489-499Google Scholar). These findings further strengthen the contention that GrK and GrA induce similar cell death mechanisms with redundant specificity and function. In the present study, we addressed the question of whether GrK indeed displays identical substrate specificity as GrA. We employed peptide- and protease-proteomic screens to show that GrK and GrA display highly restricted substrate specificities that overlap only partially. Whereas three SET complex components are cleaved by both GrA and GrK likely at the same sites (14Zhao T. Zhang H. Guo Y. Zhang Q. Hua G. Lu H. Hou Q. Liu H. Fan Z. Cell Death Differ.. 2007; 14: 489-499Google Scholar), we show that both granzymes also cleave the pre-mRNA-binding protein heterogeneous ribonuclear protein K (hnRNP K) with different kinetics at different sites. Furthermore, we demonstrate that GrK, but not GrA, cleaves the microtubule network protein β-tubulin after two distinct Arg residues. These data suggest that GrK not only constitutes a redundant functional backup mechanism that assists GrA-induced cell death, but that it also displays a unique function by cleaving its own specific substrates. Cell Lines, Antibodies, and Reagents—Jurkat cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 0.002 m glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). Cell-free protein extracts were generated from exponentially growing Jurkat cells. The cells (108 cells/ml) were washed two times in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4) and 150 mm NaCl and lysed in the same buffer by three cycles of freeze-thawing. The samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 rpm (18,400 × g) at 4 °C, and cell-free protein extracts were stored at –80 °C. Antibodies used were anti-SET (Alexis), anti-α-tubulin clone B-5-1-2 (Sigma), anti-β-tubulin clone TUB 2.1 (Sigma), anti-hnRNP K ab18195 (Abcam), and anti-His6 (Clontech). Expression constructs encoding human hnRNP K were kindly provided by Dr. A. Ostareck-Lederer (Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg, Germany). N-terminal protein sequencing was performed on a 476A protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Protein was quantified by the method of Bradford. Recombinant Proteins—The cDNA encoding human mature GrA (residues Ile26–Val259) and GrK (residues Ile26–Asn263) were amplified from IMAGE clones 4849202 and 5748080, respectively, and cloned into the yeast expression vector pPIC9 (Invitrogen). Catalytically inactive GrA and GrK, in which Ser195 residue in the catalytic center is replaced by Ala (SA variants), was generated by site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene). The plasmids were transformed into the GS115 (his4) strain of Pichia pastoris, and granzymes were expressed in conditioned medium for 72 h as described by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Recombinant GrA, GrA-SA, GrK, and GrK-SA were expressed and purified to homogeneity by cation exchange chromatography (GE Healthcare), as previously described for GrM (17Bovenschen N. de Koning P.J. Quadir R. Broekhuizen R. Damen J.M. Froelich C.J. Slijper M. Kummer J.A. J. Immunol.. 2008; 180: 8184-8191Google Scholar). Granzyme preparations were dialyzed against 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4) and 150 mm NaCl and stored at –80 °C. Both GrA and GrK were active because they showed reactivity toward the single-peptide synthetic chromogenic substrates Ac-Arg-p-nitroanilide and Ac-Lys-p-nitroanilide (Bachem) (data not shown). Human α-tubulin and β-tubulin cDNAs were amplified from IMAGE clones 3871729 and 6503977, respectively, cloned into the bacterial expression vector pQE80L. His-tubulin and His-hnRNP K proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 as recommended by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Tubulin mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis. Recombinant His-tubulin protein was purified by metal-chelate chromatography (Clontech), dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline, and stored at –80 °C prior to analysis. Fluorescent Two-dimensional Difference Gel Electrophoresis (2D-DIGE)—Washed Jurkat cells (108 cells/ml) in 25 mm Tris (pH 7.4) and 150 mm NaCl were subjected to three rounds of freeze/thaw lysis, and the lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm (18,400 × g) for 10 min. Cell-free extracts (75 μg) were incubated with GrA (1 μm), GrK (1 μm), GrA-SA (1 μm), or GrK-SA (1 μm). After 1 h at 37 °C, the samples were precipitated using the Plus One two-dimensional clean-up kit as recommended by the manufacturer (GE Healthcare) and solubilized in 8 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 4% Chaps, 300 mm dithiothreitol, 2% biolyte pH 3–10, and 0.004% bromphenol blue (75 μl). Granzyme- and control-treated samples (50 μl of a concentration of 1 μg/μl) were labeled with 400 pmol of either 1-(5-carboxypentyl)-1′-propylindocarbocyanine halide N-hydroxysuccinimidyl ester (Cy3) or 1-(5-carboxypentyl)-1′-methylindodicarbocyanine halide N-hydroxysuccinimidyl ester (Cy5). Mixtures (1:1) of both samples were labeled with 3-[(4-carboxymethyl)phenylmethyl]-3′-ethyloxacarbocyanine halide N-hydroxysuccinimidyl ester (Cy2), which functions as internal control. The labeling reactions were stopped by adding 0.2 mm lysine, diluted with rehydration buffer (8 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 4% Chaps, 150 mm dithiothreitol, 1% biolyte pH 3–10, and 0.002% bromphenol blue), and combined according to the experimental design. The samples (150 μg) were rehydrated passively into immobilized pH gradient strips (24 cm; pH 3–10, nonlinear) for 15 h at room temperature prior to isoelectric focusing in the IPGphor system (GE Healthcare) for 64 kVh. Immobilized pH gradient (IPG) strips were reduced for 60 min in 2% (w/v) dithiothreitol, 6 m urea, 2% (w/v) SDS, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 0.375 m Tris, pH 8.8, and alkylated for 30 min in the same buffer containing 2% (w/v) iodocetamide instead of dithiothreitol. The strips were overlaid to a 12% SDS-PAGE gel (20 × 24 cm), immobilized to a low fluorescent glass plate and electrophoresed for 18 h at 1 W/gel. The Cy2-, Cy3-, and Cy5-labeled images were acquired on a Typhoon 9400 scanner (GE Healthcare) at the following excitation/emission values 488/520, 532/580, and 633/670 nm, respectively. Each condition was performed at least four times, and a dye swap was included to exclude preferentially labeled proteins from the analysis. The relative quantification of matched gel features was performed by using Decyder DIA and BVA software (GE Healthcare). For inter-gel analyses, the internal standard method was used as described (18Alban A. David S.O. Bjorkesten L. Andersson C. Sloge E. Lewis S. Currie I. Proteomics.. 2003; 3: 36-44Google Scholar). Statistical analysis of gel spot quantitation was performed by Students t test. p < 0.05 was regarded as statistically significant. Two-dimensional gels were post-stained by mass spectrometry (MS)-compatible Flamingo staining (Bio-Rad). Tandem Mass Spectrometry—Selected spots were excised robotically (Ettan Dalt Spot Cutter; GE Healthcare), and in-gel proteolytic digestion of stained spots was performed essentially as described (19Lebbink R.J. de Ruiter T. Adelmeijer J. Brenkman A.B. van Helvoort J.M. Koch M. Farndale R.W. Lisman T. Sonnenberg A. Lenting P.J. Meyaard L. J. Exp. Med.. 2006; 203: 1419-1425Google Scholar) using trypsin (Roche Applied Science). The samples were subjected to nanoflow liquid chromatography (Agilent 1100 series) and concentrated on a C18 precolumn (100-μm inner diameter, 2 cm). Peptides were separated on an analytical column (75-μm inner diameter, 20 cm) at a flow rate of 200 nl/min with a 60-min linear acetonitrile gradient from 0 to 80%. The liquid chromatography system was directly coupled to a quadrupole time-of-flight (QTOF) Micro tandem mass spectrometer (Micromass Waters, UK). A survey scan was performed from 400–1200 atomic mass units s–1, and precursor ions were sequenced in tandem MS mode at a threshold of 150 counts. The data were processed and subjected to data base searches using Proteinlynx Global Server version 2.1 (Micromass) or MASCOT software version 2.1 (Matrixscience) against SWISSPROT and the NCBI nonredundant data base, with a 0.25-Da mass tolerance for both precursor ion and fragment ion. The identified peptides were confirmed by manual interpretation of the spectra. PepChip Protease Analysis—PepChip Protease arrays were used to determine the extended substrate preference of GrK and GrA. PepChip Protease arrays contain 1,000 random 15-mer peptides and 24 control peptides, each biotin-labeled at the free C terminus via a peptide bond, allowing proteolytic cleavage between the final residue and biotin. The peptides were coupled to the microarray surface via the N terminus and printed in triplicate on microarrays. The reaction mixtures containing GrA (2 μm), GrA-SA (2 μm), GrK (2 μm), and GrK-SA (2 μm) in 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4) and 150 mm NaCl, or buffer alone were incubated on duplicate PepChip Protease arrays, covered with a 25 × 60-mm coverslip for 6 h at 37 °C in a water-saturated incubator. Following incubation, the microarrays were washed three times for 5 min at room temperature in phosphate-buffered saline and 0.1% Tween 20. Biotinylated peptides were detected with fluorescein-labeled streptavidin (DAKO), diluted 1:25 in phosphate-buffered saline, incubated at room temperature for 1 h, followed by washing three times for 5 min at room temperature in phosphate-buffered saline and 0.1% Tween 20. After rinsing with distilled water, the arrays were dried under streaming nitrogen and scanned. The scans were quantified, and the peptide mean values were calculated. The ratios between control (inactive granzyme mutant) means and digested (active granzyme) means from at least four significant peptide spot values were calculated. The ratios from means that differ at least two standard deviations were considered statistically significant. GrK and GrA Cleave SET with Similar Efficiency—We have purified recombinant mature GrK, GrA, and catalytically inactive variants thereof as controls (GrK-SA and GrA-SA). SDS-PAGE analysis confirmed that purified GrA forms the typical dimer, whereas GrK exists as a monomer (Fig. 1A) (20Bell J.K. Goetz D.H. Mahrus S. Harris J.L. Fletterick R.J. Craik C.S. Nat. Struct.

Both granzymes were active because they showed reactivity toward Arg and Lys synthetic chromogenic substrates (data not shown) (10Mahrus S. Craik C.S. Chem. Biol.. 2005; 12: 567-577Google Scholar). In agreement with the literature (9Zhu P. Zhang D. Chowdhury D. Martinvalet D. Keefe D. Shi L. Lieberman J. EMBO Rep.. 2006; 7: 431-437Google Scholar, 14Zhao T. Zhang H. Guo Y. Zhang Q. Hua G. Lu H.

Chem.. 2001; 276: 43285-43293Google Scholar), incubation of tumor cell lysates with GrK or GrA resulted in dose-dependent cleavage of SET, which was illustrated by the progressive disappearance of the SET protein band (44 kDa) and the appearance of a 25-kDa cleavage product (p25) (Fig. 1B). Both cleavage patterns were similar, strongly suggesting that GrK and GrA cleave SET at the same site (9Zhu P. Zhang D. Chowdhury D. Martinvalet D. Keefe D. Shi L. Lieberman J. EMBO Rep.. 2006; 7: 431-437Google Scholar, 14Zhao T. Zhang H. Guo Y. Zhang Q. Hua G. Lu H. Hou Q. Liu H. Fan Z. Cell Death Differ.. 2007; 14: 489-499Google Scholar, 16Beresford P.J. Zhang D. Oh D.Y. Fan Z. Greer E.L. Russo M.L. Jaju M. Lieberman J. J. Biol. Chem.. 2001; 276: 43285-43293Google Scholar). These data indicate that recombinant mature GrK and GrA are active and cleave SET with similar efficiency. GrK and GrA Display Restricted Partially Overlapping Macromolecular Substrate Specificities—We used fluorescence 2D-DIGE in combination with tandem MS to compare the macromolecular substrate specificities of GrK and GrA (Fig. 2). This protease-proteomic screen scans the native proteome of tumor cells for macromolecular substrates of the granzymes. Human tumor cell-lysates were incubated with GrK, GrA, or their corresponding inactive controls. Control- and corresponding granzyme-treated lysates were subsequently labeled with green fluorescent-dye (Cy3) and red fluorescent-dye (Cy5), respectively. Both samples were combined and separated on the same two-dimensional gel. Fig. 2 shows representative examples of GrK (Fig. 2A) and GrA (Fig. 2B). A pool of all samples labeled with Cy2 was included as internal standard, allowing adequate comparison between gels. The gels were sequentially scanned at excitation and emission wavelengths specific for each fluorescent label, and the images were overlaid digitally. Spots present in greater abundance in the control sample appear green and indicate possible granzyme substrates, whereas spots present in greater abundance in the granzyme-treated sample appear red, reflecting the appearance of potential cleavage products (not affected proteome will appear yellow). Approximately 1500 proteins were resolved in each proteomic screen. For GrK, 14 spots disappeared (∼0.9%) (intact substrates), and 22 spots appeared (cleavage products) following the incubation of tumor cell lysate with GrK (Fig. 2C) (log peak volume change >1.5-fold, p < 0.05). For GrA, 30 spots disappeared (∼2%) and 55 spots appeared following the incubation of tumor cell lysate with GrA (Fig. 2C) (log peak volume change >1.5-fold, p < 0.05). The relatively low number of disappeared spots for GrK (∼0.9%) and GrA (∼2%) indicate that macromolecular substrate specificities of both granzymes are highly restricted and that GrK has an ∼2-fold more restricted substrate specificity as compared with GrA. Six proteins were cleaved and shared by both granzymes, indicating that the macromolecular substrate specificities of both granzymes partially overlap in ∼16%. Of the cleavage products that appear during granzyme incubation, 14 spots are shared by both granzymes, strongly suggesting that GrA and GrK cleave these proteins at the same P1 cleavage sites. Changed spots (Fig. 2) were excised, and we were able to identify 14 protein spots from two-dimensional gels, employing tandem MS. The identity of potential novel GrA and GrK substrates are summarized in Table 1. The substrates that are shared by both granzymes are actin, golgin subfamily A member 2, and hnRNP K. A unique substrate of GrK is β-tubulin, and a unique substrate of GrA is histidine carboxylase. Several spots that consistently changed following granzyme treatment could not be identified, most likely because the protein levels were too low. Taken together, these data indicate that GrK and GrA display restricted macromolecular substrate specificities that overlap only partially.TABLE 1Overview of GrK- and GrA-induced cleavage events identified by 2D-DIGE and MSSpot numberProtein identityShared with spot numberChangeSwiss-Prot accession numberPotential GrK substrates1Actin10IncreaseP632612Actin11IncreaseP632613β-TubulinDecreaseQ135094β-TubulinIncreaseQ135095β-TubulinIncreaseQ135096Golgin subfamily A member 214IncreaseQ083797Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K12DecreaseP619788Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein KIncreaseP61978Potential GrA substrates9ActinDecreaseP6326110Actin1IncreaseP6326111Actin2IncreaseP6326112Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K7DecreaseP6197813Histidine decarboxylaseIncreaseP1911314Golgin subfamily A member 26IncreaseQ08379 Open table in a new tab GrK and GrA Cleave hnRNP K with Different Kinetics at Distinct Sites—One protein that was consistently cleaved by both GrK and GrA is the pre-mRNA-binding protein hnRNP K, a member of the hnRNP family of proteins that directly interact with DNA and RNA through their K homology domains. hnRNP K is indispensable for cell survival and is involved in regulating gene expression at multiple levels, including transcription, RNA splicing, and translation (23Bomsztyk K. Denisenko O. Ostrowski J. Bioessays.. 2004; 26: 629-638Google Scholar). Fig. 3 shows gel images and three-dimensional representations from control and granzyme-treated samples of the spots identified as hnRNP K. GrK completely cleaved hnRNP K, whereas GrA only partially cleaved hnRNP K during the incubation period (Fig. 3A), suggesting differential kinetics. This was confirmed by incubating both granzymes with tumor cell lysate and monitoring hnRNP K cleavage kinetics by immunoblotting. Indeed, GrK was markedly more efficient in cleaving hnRNP K as compared with GrA (Fig. 3B). Different hnRNP K cleavage products were observed following the incubation with GrK and GrA (Fig. 3B), indicating that both granzymes cleave hnRNP K at distinct sites. The ∼37-kDa hnRNP K cleavage fragment induced by GrK was also detected by 2D-DIGE, during GrK-mediated proteolysis of hnRNP K (Figs. 2A and 3C). Because the anti-hnRNP K antibody used in Western blotting is directed against residues 100–200 (Fig. 3B) and because MS analysis of the 37-kDa cleavage product (Fig. 2A, spot 8) revealed peptides in the N-terminal region of hnRNP K (Fig. 3D), the detected cleavage product likely represents the N-terminal moiety of hnRNP K. To investigate whether hnRNP K is a direct granzyme substrate, rather than being a substrate of a secondary protease present in tumor cells that is activated by GrK, we expressed and purified recombinant human His-hnRNP K. As shown in Fig. 3E, both granzymes directly cleaved purified His-hnRNP K, and for GrK the 37-kDa cleavage fragment was again evident. Because of extremely low soluble recombinant hnRNP K expression by E. coli, we were unable to identify granzyme cleavage sites by N-terminal sequencing. These data indicate that GrK and GrA directly cleave hnRNP K as a novel substrate with different kinetics at distinct sites. The Microtubule Network Component β-Tubulin Is a Specific Substrate of GrK—One protein that was consistently cleaved by GrK, but not by GrA, and followed from our 2D-DIGE proteomic screen is the microtubule network component β-tubulin. This protein controls the integrity of the microtubule network and plays an essential role in cell survival. Previously, we and others have shown that GrM and GrB directly target the counterpart of the tubulin dimer, i.e. α-tubulin (17Bovenschen N. de Koning P.J. Quadir R. Broekhuizen R. Damen J.M.

Fig. 4 shows images and three-dimensional representations from control and granzyme-treated samples of the spots identified as β-tubulin. GrK, but not GrA, cleaved β-tubulin after 1 h of incubation (Fig. 4A), suggesting that β-tubulin is a GrK-specific substrate. A 42-kDa (Fig. 4B, spot 4) and a 35-kDa (Fig. 4C, spot 5) β-tubulin cleavage fragment appeared in our 2D-DIGE screen following GrK treatment of tumor cell lysate (Fig. 2A). This was confirmed by incubating both granzymes with tumor cell lysate, and β-tubulin cleavage was monitored by immunoblotting. Indeed, β-tubulin was only cleaved by GrK (Fig. 4D). Also a β-tubulin cleavage fragment was detected by Western blot (18 kDa), representing the C-terminal moiety of β-tubulin because the antibody reacts with this part of the protein. These results indicate that GrK, but not GrA, cleaves the microtubule network component β-tubulin in tumor cell lysates. GrK Directly Cleaves β-Tubulin after Arg62 and Arg282—To investigate whether β-tubulin is a specific and direct GrK substrate, rather than being a substrate of a secondary protease present in tumor cells, purified granzymes or their inactive mutants were incubated with purified recombinant human His-β-tubulin. Whereas GrA-treated and control-treated His-β-tubulin remained intact, treatment of purified β-tubulin with increasing concentrations of GrK resulted in the progressive disappearance of the ∼52-kDa His-β-tubulin protein and the appearance of four major cleavage products of ∼18, 25, 35, and 42 kDa (Fig. 5, A and B). The 42- and 35-kDa β-tubulin cleavage fragments were also detected using 2D-DIGE (Figs. 2 and 4), and the 18-kDa"
https://openalex.org/W2001152383,"In contrast to replicative DNA polymerases, Sulfolobus solfataricus Dpo4 showed a limited decrease in catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) for insertion of dCTP opposite a series of N2-alkylguanine templates of increasing size from (methyl (Me) to (9-anthracenyl)-Me (Anth)). Fidelity was maintained with increasing size up to (2-naphthyl)-Me (Naph). The catalytic efficiency increased slightly going from the N2-NaphG to the N2-AnthG substrate, at the cost of fidelity. Pre-steady-state kinetic bursts were observed for dCTP incorporation throughout the series (N2-MeG to N2-AnthG), with a decrease in the burst amplitude and kpol, the rate of single-turnover incorporation. The pre-steady-state kinetic courses with G and all of the six N2-alkyl G adducts could be fit to a general DNA polymerase scheme to which was added an inactive complex in equilibrium with the active ternary Dpo4·DNA·dNTP complex, and only the rates of equilibrium with the inactive complex and phosphodiester bond formation were altered. Two crystal structures of Dpo4 with a template N2-NaphG (in a post-insertion register opposite a 3′-terminal C in the primer) were solved. One showed N2-NaphG in a syn conformation, with the naphthyl group located between the template and the Dpo4 “little finger” domain. The Hoogsteen face was within hydrogen bonding distance of the N4 atoms of the cytosine opposite N2-NaphG and the cytosine at the –2 position. The second structure showed N2-Naph G in an anti conformation with the primer terminus largely disordered. Collectively these results explain the versatility of Dpo4 in bypassing bulky G lesions.

Accurate and efficient replication of DNA is crucial for the preservation of genomic integrity and survival of organisms (1Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication.2nd ed. W. H. Freeman, New York1992Google Scholar). A major obstacle for DNA replication is caused by various DNA lesions, which are inevitably formed by both endogenous sources and exogenous mutagens in cells and are usually present in replicating DNA after avoiding repair (2Searle C.E. Chemical Carcinogens.2nd Ed. Am. Chem. Soc, Washington, DC1984Google Scholar). DNA polymerases often produce abnormal phenomena when encountering lesions during DNA replication, including misinsertion of incorrect nucleotides, slippage, and blockage of replication, all of which can result in mutation or cell death and can lead to detrimental effects, including aging and cancer in mammals (3Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. Wood R.D. Schultz R.A. Ellenberger T. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis.2nd Ed. ASM Press, Washington, DC2006Google Scholar).Some DNA adducts are small (e.g. abasic sites and oxidative adducts), but others are very bulky, e.g. pyrimidine dimers, photoproducts, large carcinogen-bound adducts, and cross-links (2Searle C.E. Chemical Carcinogens.2nd Ed. Am. Chem. Soc, Washington, DC1984Google Scholar). The bulkiness of DNA adducts may be a differentiating factor in the misincorporation and blockage of DNA polymerases. The N2 atom of guanine is susceptible to modification by various potential carcinogens, including formaldehyde (4Yasui M. Matsui S. Ihara M. Laxmi Y.R. Shibutani S. Matsuda T.

Crotonaldehyde- and acetaldehyde-derived 1,N2-propanodeoxyguanosine adducts have been detected in DNA from human tissues (8Zhang S. Villalta P.W. Wang M. Hecht S.S. Chem. Res.

Kassie F. Villalta P.W. Hecht S.S. Chem. Res. Toxicol.. 2007; 20: 246-256Google Scholar).The nature of the mutations produced during replication is not only dependent on the specific damage in the DNA but also on the DNA polymerases involved (19Goodman M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 1997; 94: 10493-10495Google Scholar, 20Guengerich F.P. Chem. Rev.. 2006; 106: 420-452Google Scholar). Replicative DNA polymerases replicate unmodified DNA bases with high fidelity and efficiency but are generally intolerant of the DNA distortions caused by many DNA lesions; thus, these polymerases are blocked and/or inefficiently misinsert bases opposite DNA adducts during replication. The “translesion synthesis” DNA polymerases have more open and larger active sites and can synthesize DNA across and beyond various replication-blocking DNA lesions (21Friedberg E.C. Wagner R. Radman M. Science.. 2002; 296: 1627-1630Google Scholar, 22Goodman M.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem.. 2002; 71: 17-50Google Scholar). However, synthesis can still be inhibited (or blocked) by certain DNA lesions and bypass can be error-prone or error-free, depending on the adduct (23Prakash S. Johnson R.E. Prakash L. Annu. Rev. Biochem.. 2005; 74: 317-353Google Scholar).We previously studied incorporation and extension past the adducts N2-MeG, N2-EtG, N2-IbG, N2-BzG, N2-AnthG, N2-(2,3,4-trihydroxy-1-butyl)G, 8-hydroxy-1,N2-propanoG, 8-hydroxy-6-methyl-1,N2-propanoG, and the styrene oxide and polycyclic hydrocarbon products formed at the guanyl-N2 atom with the replicative DNA polymerases bacteriophage pol T7– and HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (24Choi Y.-J.

The eukaryotic DNA polymerases pol ι, κ, and η and Rev1 still preferred to incorporate dCTP opposite the N2-guanyl adducts, but the incorporation efficiency and the fidelity with bulkier N2-guanyl adducts were decreased compared with unmodified G (27Choi J.-Y.

Two crystal structures of Dpo4 with an oligonucleotide containing an N2-NaphG adduct were determined. The complexes are identical in their composition but differ in the arrangement of the template N2-NaphG and in the pairing schemes. A kinetic model involving active and inactive DNA polymerase complexes was developed to fit the available data and is discussed in relation to the available structural data.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Dpo4 was expressed in E. coli and purified to electrophoretic homogeneity as described previously (46Zang H.

Primer (32P-labeled at the 5′-end using T4 polynucleotide kinase/[γ-32P]ATP) was annealed to either an unmodified or modified (N2-alkyl-G) template by heating the primer and template (equimolar mixture) to 95 °C for 5 min and then slowly cooling to room temperature. All reactions were initiated by the addition of dNTP solutions containing MgCl2 (5 mm final concentration) to the preincubated enzyme/DNA mixtures. After reaction, 5-μl aliquots of the reaction mixture were quenched with EDTA-formamide solution (50 μl of 20 mm EDTA in 95% formamide (v/v) with 0.5% bromphenol blue (w/v) and 0.05% xylene cyanol (w/v)). Products were resolved using a 20% polyacrylamide (w/v) denaturing gel electrophoresis system containing 8 m urea and then visualized and quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis using a Bio-Rad Molecular Imager FX instrument and Quantity One software (Bio-Rad).Primer Extension Assay with All Four dNTPs—Unmodified or modified DNA (100 nm) was incubated with Dpo4 (0, 0.5, 2, or 10 nm) in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5 at 25 °C) containing 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mg of bovine serum albumin ml–1, and 5% glycerol (v/v)). Reactions were initiated by adding dNTP·Mg2+ (100 μm each dNTP and 5 mm MgCl2) solution at 37 °C. At the indicated time points, reactions were quenched by the addition of EDTA-formamide solution and analyzed by gel electrophoresis.Steady-state Kinetic Analyses—A 32P-labeled primer/template complex was extended in the presence of varying concentrations of a single dNTP. The molar ratio of Dpo4 to DNA was <0.10. Polymerase concentrations and reaction time were adjusted to keep the extent of product formation <20% (50Goodman M.F. Creighton S. Bloom L.B. Petruska J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol.. 1993; 28: 83-126Google Scholar). All determinations were usually done at twelve dNTP concentrations (with the Km values in the center of the points). Reactions were quenched by the addition of EDTA-formamide solution, analyzed using gel electrophoresis, and then quantitated (phosphorimaging). Graphs of product formation versus dNTP concentration were fit using nonlinear regression (hyperbolic fits) using GraphPad Prism Version 3.0 (San Diego, CA) for the determination of kcat and Km values.Pre-steady-state Reactions—Rapid quench experiments were performed using a model RQF-3 KinTek Quench Flow Apparatus (KinTek Corp., Austin, TX), with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4, 25 °C) aqueous solution in the drive syringes. Reactions were initiated by rapid mixing of 32P-primer/template/Dpo4 mixtures (12.5 μl) with the dNTP·Mg2+ complex (10.9 μl) and were then quenched with 0.6 m EDTA after varying times. 20-μl aliquots of the reaction product solution were mixed with 100 μl of EDTA-formamide solution, and the products were separated using denaturing gel electrophoresis (see above) and quantitated. Pre-steady-state data, with excess DNA or Dpo4, were fit to Equations 1 or 2, respectively, using nonlinear regression analysis in GraphPad Prism Version 3.0, y=A(1−e−kpt)+ksst(Eq. 1) y=A(1−e−kpt)(Eq. 2) where y is the concentration of product, A is the burst amplitude, kp is the pre-steady-state rate of nucleotide incorporation, t is time, and kss is the steady-state rate of nucleotide incorporation (51Patel S.S.

Reactions were initiated by rapid mixing of a 70 nm Dpo4 plus 120 nm32P-labeled 24-mer primer/36-mer template (containing N2-AnthG) complex in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) with a second solution containing 1 mm dCTP, 5 mm Mg2+, and 1.2 μm unlabeled trap 24-mer/36-mer in the same buffer. Reactions were quenched with 0.6 m EDTA after varying times. The reaction products were quantified by denaturing gel electrophoresis and the data points were fit to Equation 1.Phosphorothioate Analysis—Phosphorothioate analysis was done to compare the burst rates for the incorporation of dCTP and (Sp)-dCTPαS opposite the template bases. Reactions were initiated by rapid mixing of 70 nm32P-primer/template and 120 nm Dpo4 in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4, 12.5 μl) with a mixture of 1 mm dNTP or (Sp)-dNTPαS and 5 mm MgCl2 solution (10.9 μl) in the quench flow apparatus and were then quenched with 0.6 m EDTA after varying reaction times. The reaction products were quantified by denaturing gel electrophoresis and the data points were fit to Equation 1.Determination of kpol and Kd,dCTP—kpol and Kd,dCTP were estimated by performing pre-steady-state reactions in the quenched-flow apparatus with varying reaction times at different dNTP concentrations. Graphs of the burst rates (kp) versus dNTP concentration were fit to a hyperbolic equation, kp=kpol[dNTP]/([dNTP]+Kd,dCTP)(Eq. 3) where kpol is the maximal rate of nucleotide incorporation and Kd,dCTP is the equilibrium dissociation constant for dCTP (51Patel S.S.

Reactions were terminated by extraction of the remaining dNTPs using a size-exclusion chromatography column (Bio-Spin 6 chromatography column, Bio-Rad). Concentrated stocks of Tris-HCl, dithiothreitol, and EDTA were added to restore the concentrations to 50 mm, 5 mm, and 1 mm, respectively. E. coli uracil DNA glycosylase (20 units, Sigma-Aldrich) was added, and the solution was incubated at 37 °C for 6 h to hydrolyze the uracil residue on the extended primer. The reaction mixture was then heated at 95 °C for 1 h in the presence of 0.25 m piperidine, followed by removal of the solvent by centrifugation under vacuum. The dried samples were resuspended in 100 μl of H2O for MS analysis.LC-MS/MS analysis was performed on an Acquity UPLC system (Waters, Milford, MA) connected to a Finnigan LTQ mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), operating in the ESI-negative ion mode. An Acquity UPLC BEH octadecylsilane (C18) column (1.7 μm, 1.0 mm × 100 mm) was used with the following LC conditions: Buffer A contained 10 mm CH3CO2NH4 plus 2% CH3CN (v/v), and buffer B contained 10 mm CH3CO2NH4 plus 95% CH3CN (v/v). The following gradient program was used, with a flow rate of 150 μl min–1: 0–2.5 min, linear gradient from 100% A to 95%A/5% B (v/v); 2.5–6.0 min, linear gradient to 75% A/25% B (v/v); 6–6.5 min, linear gradient to 100% B; 6.5–8.0 min, hold at 100% B; 8.0–9.0 min, linear gradient to 100% A; 9.0–12.0 min, hold at 100% A.

ESI conditions were as follows: source voltage, 4 kV; source current, 100 mA; auxiliary gas flow rate setting, 20; sweep gas flow rate setting, 5; sheath gas flow setting, 34; capillary voltage, –49 V; capillary temperature, 350 °C; and tube lens voltage, –90 V. MS/MS conditions were as follows: normalized collision energy, 35%; activation Q, 0.250; and activation time, 30 ms. The doubly charged (negative ion) species were generally used for CID analysis. Calculations for the CID fragmentations of oligonucleotide sequences were done using a program linked to the Mass Spectrometry Group of Medicinal Chemistry at the University of Utah.Kinetic Simulations—Kinetic simulations were performed using two mechanisms: a minimal mechanism, which has been previously defined for DNA polymerization (54Mizrahi V. Henrie R.N. Marlier J.F. Johnson K.A. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry.. 1985; 24: 4010-4018Google Scholar, 55Kuchta R.D. Mizrahi V. Benkovic P.A. Johnson K.A. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry.. 1987; 26: 8410-8417Google Scholar), and a mechanism with the presence of a non-productive ternary complex (56Furge L.L. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry.. 1999; 38: 4818-4825Google Scholar, 57Woodside A.M. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry.. 2002; 41: 1039-1050Google Scholar). The fits to the experimentally determined data were developed utilizing DynaFit (BioKin, Watertown, MA) (58Kuzmic P. Anal. Biochem.. 1996; 237: 260-273Google Scholar), run on an iMac computer using a Macintosh OS 8.5.1 operating system (Apple Computer, Cupertino, CA).Crystallization and X-ray Diffraction Data Collection—The 18-mer template containing N2-NaphG and 14-mer primer containing a 3′-terminal dideoxycytidine (Table 1) were annealed to form a duplex. Dpo4 was mixed with DNA (1:1.2 molar ratio) in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0, 25 °C) containing 60 mm NaCl, 4% glycerol (v/v), and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol and then placed on ice for 1 h prior to incubation with 5 mm MgCl2 and 1 mm dGTP. The final Dpo4 concentration was ∼10 mg ml–1. Crystals were grown using the sitting drop/vapor-diffusion method with the reservoir solution containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0 at 25 °C), 15% polyethylene glycol 3350 (w/v), 60 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 4% glycerol (v/v). Droplets consisted of a 1:1 (v/v) mixture of the Dpo4·DNA·Mg2+·dGTP complex and the reservoir solutions and were equilibrated against the reservoir solutions. Crystals were soaked in mother liquor containing an additional 25% polyethylene glycol 3350 (w/v) and 15% ethylene glycol (v/v) and then swiped through paratone-N (Hampton Research, Aliso Viejo, CA) and flash frozen in a stream of liquid nitrogen.X-ray Diffraction Data Collection and Processing—X-ray diffraction data for the Dpo4-N2-NaphG-1 (Npg-1) and Dpo4-N2-NaphG-2 (Npg-2) complex crystals were collected at the Advanced Photon Source (Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL) on the 21-ID (LS-CAT) and 22-ID (SER-CAT) beam lines, respectively. Both data sets were recorded from cryoprotected crystals using a wavelength of 0.98 Å at 110 K. The crystals diffracted to 3.0-Å resolution (Table 2). Individual frames were indexed and scaled with the program XDS (59Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr.. 1988; 21: 916-924Google Scholar) (Npg-1) or HKL2000 (60Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol.. 1997; 276: 307-326Google Scholar) (Npg-2). Both complex crystals belong to space group P21212.

https://openalex.org/W2050295996,"Background The incidence of West Nile virus (WNv) has remained high in the northern Great Plains compared to the rest of the United States. However, the reasons for the sustained high risk of WNv transmission in this region have not been determined. To assess the environmental drivers of WNv in the northern Great Plains, we analyzed the county-level spatial pattern of human cases during the 2003 epidemic across a seven-state region. Methodology/Principal Findings County-level data on WNv cases were examined using spatial cluster analysis, and were used to fit statistical models with weather, climate, and land use variables as predictors. In 2003 there was a single large cluster of elevated WNv risk encompassing North Dakota, South Dakota, and Nebraska along with portions of eastern Montana and Wyoming. The relative risk of WNv remained high within the boundaries of this cluster from 2004–2007. WNv incidence during the 2003 epidemic was found to have a stronger relationship with long-term climate patterns than with annual weather in either 2002 or 2003. WNv incidence increased with mean May–July temperature and had a unimodal relationship with total May–July precipitation. WNv incidence also increased with the percentage of irrigated cropland and with the percentage of the human population living in rural areas. Conclusions/Significance The spatial pattern of WNv cases during the 2003 epidemic in the northern Great Plains was associated with both climatic gradients and land use patterns. These results were interpreted as evidence that environmental conditions across much of the northern Great Plains create a favorable ecological niche for Culex tarsalis, a particularly efficient vector of WNv. Further research is needed to determine the proximal causes of sustained WNv transmission and to enhance strategies for disease prevention."
https://openalex.org/W1969458273,"Background Myosin Va is a motor protein involved in vesicular transport and its absence leads to movement disorders in humans (Griscelli and Elejalde syndromes) and rodents (e.g. dilute lethal phenotype in mice). We examined the role of myosin Va in the postsynaptic plasticity of the vertebrate neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Methodology/Principal Findings Dilute lethal mice showed a good correlation between the propensity for seizures, and fragmentation and size reduction of NMJs. In an aneural C2C12 myoblast cell culture, expression of a dominant-negative fragment of myosin Va led to the accumulation of punctate structures containing the NMJ marker protein, rapsyn-GFP, in perinuclear clusters. In mouse hindlimb muscle, endogenous myosin Va co-precipitated with surface-exposed or internalised acetylcholine receptors and was markedly enriched in close proximity to the NMJ upon immunofluorescence. In vivo microscopy of exogenous full length myosin Va as well as a cargo-binding fragment of myosin Va showed localisation to the NMJ in wildtype mouse muscles. Furthermore, local interference with myosin Va function in live wildtype mouse muscles led to fragmentation and size reduction of NMJs, exclusion of rapsyn-GFP from NMJs, reduced persistence of acetylcholine receptors in NMJs and an increased amount of punctate structures bearing internalised NMJ proteins. Conclusions/Significance In summary, our data show a crucial role of myosin Va for the plasticity of live vertebrate neuromuscular junctions and suggest its involvement in the recycling of internalised acetylcholine receptors back to the postsynaptic membrane."

https://openalex.org/W2067963138,"Eukaryotic chromosomes terminate in telomeres, complex nucleoprotein structures that are required for chromosome integrity that are implicated in cellular senescence and cancer. The chromatin at the telomere is unique with characteristics of both heterochromatin and euchromatin. The end of the chromosome is capped by a structure that protects the end and is required for maintaining proper chromosome length. Immediately proximal to the cap are the telomere associated satellite-like (TAS) sequences. Genes inserted into the TAS sequences are silenced indicating the chromatin environment is incompatible with transcription. This silencing phenomenon is called telomeric position effect (TPE). Two other silencing mechanisms have been identified in eukaryotes, suppressors position effect variegation [Su(var)s, greater than 30 members] and Polycomb group proteins (PcG, approximately 15 members). We tested a large number of each group for their ability to suppress TPE [Su(TPE)]. Our results showed that only three Su(var)s and only one PcG member are involved in TPE, suggesting silencing in the TAS sequences occurs via a novel silencing mechanism. Since, prior to this study, only five genes have been identified that are Su(TPE)s, we conducted a candidate screen for Su(TPE) in Drosophila by testing point mutations in, and deficiencies for, proteins involved in chromatin metabolism. Screening with point mutations identified seven new Su(TPE)s and the deficiencies identified 19 regions of the Drosophila genome that harbor suppressor mutations. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments on a subset of the new Su(TPE)s confirm they act directly on the gene inserted into the telomere. Since the Su(TPE)s do not overlap significantly with either PcGs or Su(var)s, and the candidates were selected because they are involved generally in chromatin metabolism and act at a wide variety of sites within the genome, we propose that the Su(TPE) represent a third, widely used, silencing mechanism in the eukaryotic genome."
https://openalex.org/W2030185879,"Eukaryotic cells respond to DNA damage and stalled replication forks by activating signaling pathways that promote cell cycle arrest and DNA repair. A systematic screening of the protein kinase small interfering RNA library reveals that Chk1 and ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) and Rad3-related (ATR) are the main kinases responsible for intra-S-phase checkpoint upon topoisomerase I inhibitor camptothecin-induced DNA damage. It is well known that ATR-Chk1-mediated protein degradation of Cdc25A protein phosphatase is a crucial mechanism conferring this checkpoint activation. Here we describe another mechanism underlying Cdc25A down-regulation in response to DNA damage that occurs at the transcriptional level. We show that activation of tumor suppressor p53 by DNA damage results in inhibition of Cdc25A transcription as a result of activation of transcriptional repressor ATF3 that directly binds to the Cdc25A promoter. In cells deficient in both Chk1 and p53, Cdc25A down-regulation upon camptothecin-induced DNA damage is completely abolished, leading to severe defects in cell cycle checkpoints and remarkable cell death in mitosis. Our findings reveal two independent mechanisms acting in concert in regulation of Cdc25A in DNA damage response.

Cells respond to DNA damage by halting cell-cycle progression or by undergoing programmed cell death (1Kastan M.B. Bartek J. Nature. 2004; 432: 316-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (2163) Google Scholar). There are several strategies that arrest the cell cycle in response to DNA damage (2Zhou B.B. Elledge S.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (2619) Google Scholar). The rapidly activated pathway is triggered by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ATR 3The abbreviations used are: ATR, ataxia telangiectasia-mutated and Rad3-related; ATM, ataxia telangiectasia-mutated; ATF, activating transcription factor; CPT, camptothecin; siRNA, small interfering RNA; sh, short hairpin; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; RT-PCR, reverse transcription-PCR; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; MAPK, MAP kinase; PLK, Polo-like kinase; NC, negative control. 3The abbreviations used are: ATR, ataxia telangiectasia-mutated and Rad3-related; ATM, ataxia telangiectasia-mutated; ATF, activating transcription factor; CPT, camptothecin; siRNA, small interfering RNA; sh, short hairpin; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; RT-PCR, reverse transcription-PCR; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; MAPK, MAP kinase; PLK, Polo-like kinase; NC, negative control. and/or ATM together with DNA-pyruvate kinase, which sense the DNA lesions and activate effector kinases Chk1 and Chk2 (3Abraham R.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2177-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1652) Google Scholar). Effector kinases further spread out the signal, particularly by phosphorylating the key components of cell cycle progression, such as Cdc25 phosphatases A, B, and C (4Peng C.Y. Graves P.R. Thoma R.S.

Science. 1997; 277: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar), leading to inactivation of cyclin E- and cyclin A-dependent protein kinases important for G1/S and G2/M transition (6Jinno S.

Biol. 1999; 19: 6183-6194Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). After DNA damage, Cdc25A undergoes inhibitory phosphorylation by Chk1 or Chk2 kinases, depending on the stress, and degrades via the ubiquitin-mediated proteasome pathway, leading to transit inhibition of DNA replication (8Falck J. Mailand N. Syljuasen R.G. Bartek J. Lukas J. Nature. 2001; 410: 842-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar).Unlike the ATR/ATM-Chk1/2 pathway that is activated within minutes after DNA damage and is crucial in early events of cell cycle arrest, stress-induced stabilization and activation of the tumor suppressor p53 is required for maintenance of cell cycle arrest, most likely through transcriptional activation or repression of its downstream target genes (9Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2282) Google Scholar). Indeed, the functional roles of p53 in both G1 and G2/M checkpoints has been previously shown (10Agarwal M.L. Agarwal A. Taylor W.R. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8493-8497Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). Together with other defects in checkpoint control, inactivation of p53 leads to comprised checkpoint response and enhanced sensitivity to DNA damage (11Mukhopadhyay U.K. Senderowicz A.M. Ferbeyre G. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 2872-2881Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 12Levesque A.A. Kohn E.A. Bresnick E. Eastman A. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 3786-3796Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Given the protective role of cell cycle checkpoint in DNA damage response, abrogation of cell cycle checkpoint has been proposed to be a strategy for anticancer therapy (13Kawabe T. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2004; 3: 513-519PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, pharmacological inhibition of cell cycle checkpoint pathways has been shown to sensitize p53-deficient cells to chemotherapeutic agents (14Tse A.N. Schwartz G.K. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 6635-6644Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 15Playle L.C. Hicks D.J. Qualtrough D. Paraskeva C. Br. J. Cancer. 2002; 87: 352-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, the detailed mechanism underlying this sensitization in p53-deficient cells is not completely understood.Activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3), a member of ATF/CREB transcriptional factor family, is one of the direct targets of p53 (16Kannan K. Amariglio N. Rechavi G. Jakob-Hirsch J. Kela I. Kaminski N. Getz G. Domany E. Givol D. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2225-2234Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 17Zhang C. Gao C. Kawauchi J. Hashimoto Y. Tsuchida N. Kitajima S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 297: 1302-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Although the first member of the family, ATF (later ATF1), was initially described as a transcriptional activator (18Lee K.A. Hai T.Y. SivaRaman L. Thimmappaya B. Hurst H.C. Jones N.C. Green M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8355-8359Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), the other members (ATF3 and ATF2) seemed to function as transcriptional repressors (53Chen B.P. Liang G. Whelan J. Hai T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15819-15826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ATFs and CREB proteins share similar properties and bind to a consensus DNA sequence (TGACGTCA) in gene promoters for transcriptional regulation. Moreover, ATF3 is a stress-inducible gene; its mRNA level greatly increases upon the exposure of cells to a variety of stress signals, including cytokines, hydrogen peroxide, ultraviolet light, and ionizing radiation, as well as genotoxic agents such as camptothecin (CPT), 5-flurouracil, and doxorubicin (17Zhang C.

Oncogene. 2003; 22: 4235-4242Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar).The majority of anticancer drugs kill cancer cells by causing DNA damage and by taking the advantage of defective cell cycle checkpoint in cancer cells. Camptothecin is a topoisomerase I inhibitor that can stall DNA replication by causing single and double-strand DNA breaks, and its action is specific to S-phase (21Froelich-Ammon S.J. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21429-21432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar, 22Srivastava V. Negi A.S. Kumar J.K. Gupta M.M. Khanuja S.P. Bioorg. Med.

In clinic, camptothecin derivatives, such as irinotecan and topotecan, are key components of first and second line treatment for metastatic colon cancer and ovarian cancer, respectively (24Fuchs C. Mitchell E.P. Hoff P.M. Cancer Treat. Rev. 2006; 32: 491-503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 25Legarza K. Yang L.X. Anticancer Res. 2006; 26: 3301-3305PubMed Google Scholar), and thus, CPT is widely used as a clinically relevant agent to study chemotherapy-induced DNA damage response.Here we report a novel mechanism of Cdc25A regulation in DNA damage response, which involves the transcriptional regulation by ATF3 in a p53-dependent manner. Through this mechanism, along with Chk1-regulated protein degradation, Cdc25A down-regulation upon DNA damage is well maintained in the presence of functional p53. Loss of this dual regulation leads to severe defects in DNA damage checkpoint, allowing cells to proceed through mitosis with damaged DNA and undergo mitotic cell death. Our results provide novel insight into the mechanism by which pharmacological inhibition of Chk1 selectively sensitizes p53-deficient tumor cells to chemotherapy.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Treatment—The HCT116 human colon cancer cell lines (wild type and p53–/–) were kindly provided by Dr. Bert Vogelstein (The John Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD). Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen) and maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2. CPT was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was extracted using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen). All RT-PCR was performed using the LightCycler® RNA Master SYBR Green I kit (Roche Applied Science). Primer sequences were 5′-CTCCTGGGTCACTGGTGTT-3′ and 5′-TCTGAGCCTTCAGTTCAGCA-3′ for ATF3; 5′-TAGATTCTCCTGGGCCATTG-3′ and 5′-GCTGGAGCTACACAGGGAAG-3′ for Cdc25A; and 5′-CAAAGTTGTCATGGATGACC-3′ and 5′-CCATGGAGAAGGCTGGGG-3′ for GAPDH.Flow Cytometry—Cell cycle analysis was performed by DNA content quantification. The cells were fixed with 70% ethanol, washed twice in PBS, and stained with propidium iodide solution (PBS with propidium iodide 5 and 100 μg/ml RNase A) for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. The stained cells were analyzed by FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). Stained cells were analyzed by FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) and quantified by using CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). To measure caspase-3 activity, cells were fixed with Cytofix/Cytoperm solution (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions and then stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated rabbit anti-active caspase-3 monoclonal antibody (BD Biosciences) followed by FACS analysis. For phosphorylated H3 detection, 70% ethanol-fixed cells were washed twice in PBS and incubated for 15 min in PBS, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.25% Triton X-100. After centrifugation, cells were suspended in 100 μl of PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 20 μl of an anti-histone H3 (pS28) antibody (BD Biosciences). After a 1-h incubation at room temperature in the dark, cells were washed with PBS and stained with propidium iodide solution followed by FACS analysis. For S-phase cell detection, cells were labeled with bromodeoxyuridine for 1 h before harvesting, fixed, and stained with anti-bromodeoxyuridine antibodies according to the manufacturer's instructions (BD Biosciences) followed by FACS analysis.Gene Silence by RNA Interference and Overexpression—The siRNA library of 780 human kinases was purchased from Dharmacon. The siRNA oligonucleotide targeting Chk1 was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA (catalog number 6241), the siRNA targeting Cdc25A was from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO), and the siRNA targeting ATF3 was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Control duplex RNA (Dharmacon) corresponding to an unknown protein was used in controls. Transfection was conducted using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 48 h after transfection, cells were washed with PBS before further treatment. To generate stable Chk1 knock-down cell lines, the shRNA sequence (AACTGAAGAAGCATGCGCAGT) was cloned into the pSIREN-RetroQ retroviral expression vector (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Virally infected cells were selected in a medium containing 2 μg/ml puromycin, and individual drug-resistant clones were collected, pooled, and expanded.Human p53 and ATF3 cDNA was amplified by PCR from a HCT116 cDNA library and cloned into pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen). Empty pcDNA3 vector was used in controls. Transfection was conducted overnight using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Western Blotting—Cells were harvested and lysed with radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and proteinase inhibitors). 20–50 μg of protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto an Immobilon membrane (Millipore). Proteins were detected with the ECL detection system (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, UK) using anti-p53 (antibody DO-1), anti-Chk1 (antibody G-4), anti-ATF3 (antibody C-19) (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-Cdc25A (antibody Ab-3, Lab Vision Corp.), anti-phospho-Chk1 (Ser-345) (Cell Signaling Technology); or anti-β-actin (Sigma-Aldrich).ChIP Assays—Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were performed as described previously (54Zhao Y. Tan J. Zhunag L. Jiang X. Liu E.T. Qiang Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 16090-16095Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). HCT116 cells were treated with CPT (1 μm) for 24 h. Precleared chromatin from HCT116 cells was immunoprecipitated with anti-ATF3 (antibody C-17x, Upstate Biotechnology), and a nonspecific IgG (antibody sc-2027, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The ChIP-precipitated DNA and input DNA were subjected to PCR analysis. Primer sequences were 5′-CAAAGCTGGGGCTGAGATAG-3′ and 5′-ATGCATTTTGGCACACTTGA-3′ for ATF/CREB-1; 5′-GAAAACCAAGCCGACCTACA-3′ and 5′-ATTTTGATCCCCGCTCTTCT-3′ for ATF/CREB-2; 5′-CAAATAGCGCCTTCACGAC-3′ and 5′-CGGAGTCGTGTTTGTGTTTG-3′ for control internal region.RESULTSATR and Chk1 Are the Main Protein Kinases Participating in CPT-induced Checkpoint Activation—Protein phosphorylation plays a key role in cell cycle checkpoint regulation. Several protein kinases, including ATR(ATM)-Chk1(Chk2), p38 MAPK, MAPKAP2, and PLK2, have been previously shown to be involved in S-phase checkpoint in various cellular contexts (26Matthew E.M. Yen T.J. Dicker D.T. Dorsey J.F. Yang W. Navaraj A. El-Deiry W.S. Cell Cycle. 2007; 6: 2571-2578Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 27Goloudina A. Yamaguchi H. Chervyakova D.B. Appella E.

Cell. 2005; 17: 37-48Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Fig. 1A shows that HCT116 cells treated with CPT underwent cell cycle arrest in S-phase, indicating the activation of S-phase checkpoint. As expected, this checkpoint induction was abrogated upon treatment with Chk1 siRNA. To systematically identify protein kinases participating in CPT-induced S-phase checkpoint, we performed a screening of a SmartPool siRNA library of 780 human kinases (Dharmacon). To this end, HCT116 cells were transfected individually with each kinase siRNA for 48 h followed by CPT treatment at 200 nm for an additional 24 h, a condition that can arrest cells in intra-S-phase. Using this assay, we assessed the impact of each kinase siRNA on S-phase accumulation by calculating the ratio of cells in G2 over that in S-phase (Fig. 1B). The G2/S ratios were further normalized to G2/S ratios of cells treated with negative control (NC)-siRNA. Three independent transfections were further performed to verify each Chk1-like phenotype that shows a G2/S ratio of 1.8 or greater. The screening results show that ATR and Chk1 are the primary kinases accounting for the S-phase checkpoint activation in response to CPT treatment, although some other kinases such as PLK1, ERK8, and FGFR4 may also participate in this process but less profoundly. By contrast, ATM and Chk2 appear to be not essential in S-phase arrest under this experimental condition. We thus conclude that the ATR-Chk1 pathway is central to CPT-induced S-phase arrest among all the kinases we have examined.Depletion of Both p53 and Chk1 Completely Abrogates the Cdc25A Down-regulation in Response to DNA Replication Stress—We next explored the role of the Chk1-mediated checkpoint pathway in relation to other checkpoint defects in cancer cells. Recent reports indicate that inactivation of both Chk1 and p53 results in intense checkpoint abrogation in both S-phase and G2-phase (29Rodriguez R. Meuth M. Mol. Biol.

In this study, we sought to determine the exact mechanisms that allow cancer cells to bypass checkpoints upon loss of these pathways. To facilitate the investigation, we generated stable cell lines derived from human colon cancer HCT116 cells that constitutively expressed a short hairpin RNA targeting Chk1 (shChk1) or a nonspecific control shRNA (NC-shRNA) in both p53 wild-type and p53–/– backgrounds. To characterize these cell lines, we first examined their ability to arrest the cell cycle by treating them with low (0.2 μm) or high (1 μm) doses of CPT. The roles of p53 and Chk1 in G1 and S checkpoints activated by CPT have been shown previously (32Shao R.G. Cao C.X. Shimizu T. O'Connor P.M. Kohn K.W. Pommier Y. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 4029-4035PubMed Google Scholar, 33Gupta M. Fan S. Zhan Q. Kohn K.W. O'Connor P.M. Pommier Y. Clin. Cancer Res. 1997; 3: 1653-1660PubMed Google Scholar). As expected from the loss of Chk1, cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry revealed that cells depleted of Chk1 (HCT116 shChk1) showed deficient S-phase arrest in response to 0.2 μm CPT for 24 h but a strong accumulation in G2/M-phase, whereas the wild-type cells or p53–/– HCT116 cells were strongly accumulated in S-phase (Fig. 2A). Higher concentration of CPT at 1 μm resulted in strong G1 arrest in both wild-type and Chk1-depleted HCT116 cells but not in p53–/– cells. These data suggest that the low dose of CPT triggers mainly an intra-S-phase checkpoint that requires Chk1, whereas the high dose of CPT induces G1 arrest that requires p53. In cells lacking both Chk1 and p53, CPT treatment resulted in enhanced cell accumulation in sub-G1 at 48 h, indicating a strong commitment of such cells to apoptosis as a result of severe checkpoint defects (Fig. 2A).FIGURE 2Switching off both p53-dependent and Chk1-dependent stress signaling pathways in cells treated with CPT abrogates the G1/S and intra-S-phase checkpoints and completely abolishes the degradation of Cdc25A phosphatase.

We treated the four cell lines with 1 μm CPT for 6 and 24 h. Western blot analysis indicates that wild-type HCT116 cells displayed a marked decrease in Cdc25A protein level in both 6 h and 24 h following CPT treatment, which was attenuated in Chk1-depleted cells at 6 h but not at 24 h (Fig. 2B and supplemental Fig. 1). By contrast, p53–/– cells showed a decrease in Cdc25A at the early time point (6 h), which was back to the normal levels at 24 h. Furthermore, in cells lacking both Chk1 and p53, Cdc25A protein remained unchanged throughout the time course treatment. A similar result was also observed in cells treated with CPT at 0.2 μm (supplemental Fig. 1). Together, these results indicate that Chk1 and p53 seem to act sequentially to maintain low levels of Cdc25A during the stress response; although Chk1 regulates Cdc25A in the early time point, p53 does so in the later phase. Loss of both results in a complete abrogation of Cdc25A down-regulation upon CPT treatment, as seen in cells lacking both p53 and Chk1.High Levels of Cdc25A Enable Cells to Bypass G2/M Checkpoint and Result in Massive Cell Death in Mitosis—Numerous reports have shown that inactivation of Chk1 in p53-deficient cells resulted in abrogation of the G2 arrest and subsequent apoptosis (4Peng C.Y.

However, the molecular mechanism underlying such phenotype changes have not been fully defined. We hypothesize that the increased cell death of p53–/– shChk1 cells to CPT treatment is due to mitotic catastrophe, as a result of bypass of G2 checkpoint. To measure cells in mitotic phase, we used phosphorylated histone H3 as a mitotic marker. In wild-type cells or cells lacking only Chk1 or p53, CPT treatment resulted in decreased cells accumulated in mitosis, indicating an effective G2 checkpoint. In a striking contrast to these cells, cells lacking both p53 and Chk1 displayed a dramatic increase in H3 phosphorylation, suggesting a strong accumulation in mitosis as a result of the defective G2 checkpoint (Fig. 3A).FIGURE 3The ability of HCT116 shChk1/p53–/– cells to bypass the G2/M checkpoint and their subsequent death are partially dependent upon Cdc25A. A, flow cytometry analysis of phospho-histone H3 (Ser-28)-positive HCT116 wild-type (wt) and HCT116 p53–/– cells and their Chk1-depleted derivatives treated or not treated with 0.2 or 1 μm CPT for 24 or 48 h The values shown are the means ± standard deviations from three separate experiments.

The values shown are the means ± standard deviations from three separate experiments.

E, restoration of surviving colony numbers of NC-siRNA transfected HCT116 p53–/– shChk1 cells exposed to 0.2 μm CPT when compared with Cdc25A siRNA transfected cells. Cells were split 24 h after CPT treatment. Plates were stained with crystal violet.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We next investigated whether resistance of Cdc25A down-regulation to CPT treatment is responsible for the G2 bypass seen above. Fig. 3B shows that depletion of Cdc25A by siRNA-mediated gene silencing in p53–/– shChk1 cells decreased the number of cells positive for H3 phosphorylation in response to CPT treatment. This result demonstrates that the high levels of Cdc25A indeed confer the defective G2 checkpoint in CPT-treated cells upon loss of both Chk1 and p53. A similar approach was used to study the role of Cdc25A in an intra-S-phase checkpoint HCT116 p53–/– shChk1 cells were transfected with Cdc25A or NC-siRNA, treated with CPT for 24 h, and analyzed for bromodeoxyuridine incorporation. Cdc25A depletion resulted in slowing down of S-phase progression in response to CPT treatment (supplemental Fig. 2). These data indicate that Cdc25A down-regulation is required for proper intra-S-phase checkpoint in response to DNA-replication stress.To trace the cell fate following the defective S and G2 checkpoint, the four cell lines were treated with 0.2 μm CPT for 24 and 48 h, and the activity of caspase-3 was measured by flow cytometry. As seen in Fig. 3C, cells depleted for both p53 and Chk1 showed the highest level of caspase-3 activation. To further assess the role of Cdc25A in this apoptosis induction, we performed the Cdc25A knockdown. Fig. 3D shows that treatment of p53–/– shChk1 cells with CPT resulted in an 8-fold induction in caspase-3 activity, whereas only a 3-fold induction of caspas-3 activity was detected in these cells upon Cdc25A knockdown. Moreover, transfection of p53–/– shChk1 cells with Cdc25A siRNA also resulted in enhanced long term cell survival as assessed by focus formation assay when compared with cells treated with control siRNA (Fig. 3E). Together, the data indicate that the high levels of Cdc25A in p53–/– shChk1 cells are responsible for the bypass of the G2 checkpoint and subsequent apoptosis in mitosis.P53 Down-regulates Cdc25A Expression through Induction of ATF3—We next investigated the mechanism by which p53 regulates Cdc25A expression in DNA damage response. Quantitative PCR analysis indicates that 1 μm CPT treatment for 24 h resulted in a sharp decrease in Cdc25A mRNA level in HCT116 cells but not in HCT116 p53–/– cells. This indicates that CPT treatment down-regulates Cdc25A expression in a p53-dependent manner. p53 is activated after stress exposure, and within hours, induces or represses transcription of its target genes (37Kho P.S.

https://openalex.org/W2042863714,"Interferon-γ (IFN-γ) has been shown to enhance anti-tumor immunity and inhibit the formation of bone-resorbing osteoclasts. We evaluated the role of IFN-γ in bone metastases, tumor-associated bone destruction, and hypercalcemia in human T cell lymphotrophic virus type 1-Tax transgenic mice. Compared with Tax+IFN-γ+/+ mice, Tax+IFN-γ-/- mice developed increased osteolytic bone lesions and soft tissue tumors, as well as increased osteoclast formation and activity. In vivo administration of IFN-γ to tumor-bearing Tax+IFN-γ-/- mice prevented new tumor development and resulted in decreased bromodeoxyuridine uptake by established tumors. In vitro, IFN-γ directly decreased the viability of Tax+ tumor cells through inhibition of proliferation, suppression of ERK phosphorylation, and induction of apoptosis and caspase 3 cleavage. IFN-γ also inhibited macrophage colonystimulating factor-mediated proliferation and survival of osteoclast progenitors in vitro. Administration of IFN-γ to C57BL/6 mice decreased Tax+ tumor growth and prevented tumor-associated bone loss and hypercalcemia. In contrast, IFN-γ treatment failed to protect IFN-γR1-/- mice from Tax+ tumor-induced skeletal complications, despite decreasing tumor growth. These data demonstrate that IFN-γ suppressed tumor-induced bone loss and hypercalcemia in Tax+ mice by inhibiting both Tax+ tumor cell growth and host-induced osteolysis. These data suggest a protective role for IFN-γ in patients with bone metastases and hypercalcemia of malignancy.

Koebel C.M. Schreiber R.D. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 6: 836-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (1128) Google Scholar). Mice deficient in IFN-γ, the R1 subunit of the IFN-γ receptor, or the transcription factor STAT1 are more susceptible to spontaneous tumor development (1Dunn G.P. Koebel C.M. Schreiber R.D. Nat. Rev.

IFN-γ has been shown to regulate bone cell differentiation and function with complex effects on skeletal health. However, the role of IFN-γ in pathological bone disease is largely controversial. Previously, it has been reported that IFN-γ can inhibit the critical osteoclast regulator, receptor activator of NFκB ligand (RANKL), by activating ubiquitin-mediated degradation of its signaling pathway adaptor protein TRAF-6 (7Teitelbaum S.L.

Interestingly, IFN-γ has been used to treat infantile osteopetrosis in which patients suffered from high bone mass secondary to osteoclast dysfunction or osteoblast hyperactivity, but the mechanism of action may be through modulation of the host immune system rather than direct effects on bone cells (13Key Jr., L.L.

We evaluated the effects of IFN-γ in HTLV-1-Tax transgenic mice that develop osteolytic bone tumors and hypercalcemia (16Grossman W.J. Kimata J.T. Wong F.H. Zutter M. Ley T.J. Ratner L. Proc. Natl.

Previously, it was shown that HTLV-1-Tax+IFN-γ-/- mice develop increased numbers of soft tissue tumors with enhanced tumor-associated angiogenesis and up-regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor expression; however, the impact on bone metastases and hypercalcemia in these mice was not evaluated (2Mitra-Kaushik S. Harding J. Hess J. Schreiber R. Ratner L. Blood. 2004; 104: 3305-3311Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Because of the multiple complex effects of IFN-γ on osteoclasts, anti-tumor and anti-viral immunity, we hypothesized that IFN-γ would affect tumor-associated bone destruction and bone metastases in HTLV-1-Tax transgenic mice. In this study, we demonstrate enhanced osteolytic bone disease and increased osteoclast activity in Tax+IFN-γ-/- mice as compared with Tax+IFN-γ+/+ mice. We show that IFN-γ directly inhibited the growth of Tax-expressing tumor cells by suppressing their proliferation and inducing apoptosis. IFN-γ was also able to directly inhibit in vitro osteoclast formation in Tax+ mice. In summary, treatment with IFN-γ resulted in decreased tumor growth and prevented tumor-associated bone loss and hypercalcemia in Tax+IFN-γ-/- mice.

MTT (Sigma) and BrdUrd cell proliferation assay (Roche Applied Science) were performed as described previously (19Hirbe A.C. Uluçkan O. Morgan E.A. Eagleton M.C. Prior J.L. Piwnica-Worms D. Trinkaus K. Apicelli A. Weilbaecher K. Blood. 2007; 109: 3424-3431Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Where described, 20 μm U0126 MEK1/2 inhibitor (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) was added to cells for 4 h prior to addition of IFN-γ. For annexin-V staining TGN cells were plated at 6 × 104 cells/ml in 12-well plates, serum-starved for 2 h, followed by IFN-γ treatment for 48 h. Cells were stained with annexin-V-fluorescein isothiocyanate and 7-amino-actinomycin D (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Data were collected on a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) and analyzed with FlowJo (Treestar, Ashland, OR). Macrophage and Osteoclast Formation Assays—Whole bone marrow was extracted from femurs and tibias of Tax+ mice (6-8 weeks old), and in vitro osteoclast formation was done as described previously (19Hirbe A.C. Uluçkan O. Morgan E.A. Eagleton M.C. Prior J.L. Piwnica-Worms D. Trinkaus K. Apicelli A. Weilbaecher K. Blood. 2007; 109: 3424-3431Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 23Zhao H. Kitaura H.

TRAP staining was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Sigma), and the number of TRAP-positive cells with three or more nuclei in five 4× fields was counted blinded to genotype. Cell Signaling and Immunoblotting—TGN cells were plated in 6-well plates, serum-starved for 2 h, and treated with different doses of IFN-γ in RPMI 1640 media containing 10% fetal bovine serum for 1-72 h. Protein lysates were harvested in RIPA buffer (Sigma) containing protease inhibitors mixture (Roche Applied Science) and then quantified by BCA method (Pierce). Total of 40 μg of protein was electrophoresed and blotted with relevant antibodies by immunoblot analysis. For phospho-AKT, rabbit monoclonal antibody was from Covance Research Products (Princeton, NJ) at 1:250; and all other antibodies were ordered from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA), including the following: total AKT, polyclonal, 1:1000; total ERK, polyclonal, 1:1000; total STAT1, polyclonal, 1:1000; phospho-STAT1, polyclonal, 1:1000; phospho-ERK, monoclonal, 1:1000; and anti-caspase-3 antibody, 1:500. Anti-Tax monoclonal antibody was a gift from Dr. Tanaka and used at a 1:1000 dilution (21Tanaka Y. Yoshida A. Takayama Y. Tsujimoto H. Tsujimoto A. Hayami M. Tozawa H. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1990; 81: 225-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Statistical Analyses—Several experiments were reported in this study, and different outcome variables were measured. Thus, different statistical methods were used to test the association between outcome variables and groups depending on the sample sizes, and sampling distributions of the outcome variables were involved in these comparisons. In general, when sample sizes were small and/or the variances in the different treatment groups were not homogeneous, nonparametric tests were used (two-sample Wilcoxon rank-sum (Mann-Whitney)). Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to compare peripheral soft tumor incidence, serum TRAP, and rate of osteolytic lesion formation between the two mice groups. ANOVA and two-sample Student's t tests were used to compare histomorphometric outcome variables, in vitro viability and proliferation, serum calcium levels, and BMD. ANOVA with repeated measures was used to compare tumor volume across time between treated versus control mice (Fig. 2a and Fig. 5e). For these repeated measures, ANOVA models take into account the correlations of measurements within same mice. The Bonferroni method was used to adjust for multiplicity when pairwise comparisons were performed. Differences were considered statistically significant when the p value was <0.05.FIGURE 5IFN-γ inhibited Tax+ tumor cells in vivo and prevented tumor-associated bone loss and hypercalcemia. a-d, immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice were subcutaneously transplanted with TGN tumor cells and treated for 3 weeks with vehicle or recombinant IFN-γ as indicated. a, representative picture of subcutaneous TGN tumors at 3 weeks post-transplantation. b, IFN-γ treatment decreased the average weight of dissected tumors at 3 weeks (*, p < 0.01, ANOVA). n = 6 vehicle; n = 7 IFN-γ-treated mice. c, average serum calcium 3 weeks after TGN subcutaneous implantation and treatment (*, p < 0.05, ANOVA). n = 4 vehicle; n = 4 IFN-γ-treated mice. d, BMD as measured by DXA of tibia and femur bones 3 weeks after subcutaneous TGN transplantation and IFN-γ treatment.

Consistent with previous observations (2Mitra-Kaushik S. Harding J. Hess J. Schreiber R. Ratner L. Blood. 2004; 104: 3305-3311Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), we found that Tax+IFN-γ-/- mice formed increased numbers of peripheral soft tissue tumors by 6 months as compared with Tax+IFN-γ+/+ (71 versus 28% respectively, p < 0.005). 89% of 6-month-old Tax+IFN-γ-/- mice also had x-ray evidence of osteolytic skeletal tumors compared with 50% in age-matched Tax+IFN-γ+/+ mice (p < 0.05). By 9 months, Tax+IFN-γ-/- mice also revealed significant increases in the number of osteolytic bone lesions (Fig. 1, a-c). In addition to osteolytic lesions in the tail vertebrae, Tax+IFN-γ-/- also developed osteolytic lesions in the appendicular skeleton, which were a rare occurrence in Tax+IFN-γ+/+ mice (Fig. 1a). Increased numbers of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)-expressing OCs were present in the tail vertebrae of Tax+IFN-γ-/- mice (Fig. 1b). Serum levels of the OC marker, TRAP, were significantly higher in Tax+IFN-γ-/- mice consistent with increased OC activity in vivo (Fig. 1d). Also suggesting increased OC activity, Tax+IFN-γ-/- mice had significantly elevated serum calcium compared with non-Tax transgenic wild type (WT) age-matched historical controls (Fig. 1e). Evaluation of BMD as measured by DXA analysis demonstrated decreased BMD in the femur of tumor-bearing Tax+IFN-γ-/- mice compared with Tax+IFN-γ+/+ mice (Fig. 1f). Histomorphometric analysis of tail vertebrae demonstrated a significant increase in OC numbers and OC perimeters covering the bone surface (Fig. 1, g and h). These data show that, compared with Tax+IFN-γ+/+ mice, Tax+IFN-γ-/- mice developed increased numbers of osteolytic tumors with increased tumor-associated bone loss and OC activity. IFN-γ Prevented New Tumor Formation in Tax+ IFN-γ-/- Mice—To evaluate the effects of recombinant murine IFN-γ on tumor growth and formation in vivo, tumor bearing Tax+IFN-γ-/- mice received either IFN-γ or saline for 1 month. Mice administered IFN-γ developed significantly fewer new tumors over the course of 1 month of treatment compared with saline controls (Fig. 2a). There were no visible differences in the size of established tumors between the two groups during the treatment period; however, in vivo BrdUrd labeling showed a significant decrease in BrdUrd uptake by soft tissue tumors (Fig. 2, b and c). These data demonstrate that recombinant IFN-γ administration decreased new soft tissue tumor formation and decreased the proliferation rate of established tumors in tumor-bearing Tax transgenic mice. IFN-γ Directly Inhibited Growth of Tax+ Tumor Cells in Vitro—IFN-γ has been reported to directly decrease tumor cell proliferation in vitro (4Detjen K.M. Farwig K. Welzel M. Wiedenmann B. Rosewicz S. Gut. 2001; 49: 251-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 24Kim E.J. Lee J.M. Namkoong S.E. Um S.J. Park J.S. J. Cell.

Oncol. 2002; 21: 1133-1140PubMed Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the increased tumor burden in Tax+IFN-γ-/- mice was due in part to the lack of IFN-γ-mediated inhibition of tumor growth in vivo. To test this hypothesis, we developed a Tax-expressing cell line from a tumor that spontaneously arose in a Tax+IFN-γ-/- mouse. Although this tumor line does not have the ability to produce IFN-γ, it does retain the signaling pathway necessary to respond to the cytokine. Preliminary observations showed that the TGN cells were tumorigenic, highly metastatic, and demonstrated significant pro-osteoclastogenic capabilities, which recapitulates many of the biological behaviors of spontaneous tumors in HTLV-1-Tax transgenic mice (supplemental Fig. 1). We therefore used TGN cells to evaluate the direct anti-tumor effect of IFN-γ, independent of its actions on host cells. TGN cells express IFN-γ receptor by RT-PCR analysis at a similar level to a Tax+IFN-γ+/+ tumor line (Tax+ interferon-γ positive; TGP) (Fig. 3a). IFN-γ treatment significantly decreased TGN cell viability in vitro as measured by MTT assay and inhibited proliferation of TGN cells by BrdUrd incorporation assay (Fig. 3, b and c). This effect was not dependent on the intrinsic ability of the cells to produce IFN-γ, as TGP cells also exhibited decrease viability following IFN-γ treatment (supplemental Fig. 2). IFN-γ dose-dependently induced phosphorylation of the canonical IFN-γ transcription factor, STAT1, in TGN cells (Fig. 3d). The phosphorylation of STAT1 suggests that the proximal components of the canonical IFN-γ signaling pathway remain functional in this tumor cell line. IFN-γ treatment also decreased ERK phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3d). This decrease was consistent with our BrdUrd data (Fig. 3c) as ERK phosphorylation is associated with cell cycle progression and cell proliferation. To examine if the ERK pathway was responsible for the decrease in TGN viability following IFN-γ treatment, we cultured cells in the presence of the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126. As a selective inhibitor of the kinase activity of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK), U0126 resulted in downstream inhibition of ERK (26Favata M.F. Horiuchi K.Y. Manos E.J. Daulerio A.J. Stradley D.A. Feeser W.S. Van Dyk D.E. Pitts W.J. Earl R.A. Hobbs F. Copeland R.A. Magolda R.L. Scherle P.A. Trzaskos J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18623-18632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2728) Google Scholar) In the absence of IFN-γ treatment, U0126 decreased the viability of TGN cells, suggesting that ERK phosphorylation was required for their viability (Fig. 3e). IFN-γ treatment in the presence of U0126 further decreased the viability of TGN cells (Fig. 3e). The additive effect of U0126 and IFN-γ suggested that the decrease in TGN viability cannot be attributed solely to decreased ERK phosphorylation. We next investigated if IFN-γ may also be causing apoptosis of TGN cells. Microscopically, DAPI staining of IFN-γ-treated TGN cells showed conspicuous DNA fragmentation (Fig. 3f). IFN-γ also induced a dose-dependent increase in the cleavage and activation of caspase-3 (Fig. 3g). Additionally, TGN cells treated with IFN-γ exhibited increased annexin-V staining as compared with untreated cells (Fig. 3h). Annexin-V staining detects phosphatidylserine expression on the outer cell membrane, a marker of apoptosis. We also observed a modest decrease in the phosphorylation of Akt, a mediator of cell survival (Fig. 3d). These results demonstrate that IFN-γ can directly affect the viability and proliferation of Tax-expressing tumor cells in vitro with associated attenuation of ERK phosphorylation and caspase-3-mediated apoptosis.

https://openalex.org/W2091645182,"During episodes of acute-inflammation high-density lipoproteins (HDL), the carrier of so-called good cholesterol, experiences a major change in apolipoprotein composition and becomes acute-phase HDL (AP-HDL). This altered, but physiologically important, HDL has an increased binding affinity for macrophages that is dependent on cell surface heparan sulfate (HS). While exploring the properties of AP-HDLratioHS interactions we discovered that HS caused significant remodeling of AP-HDL. The physical nature of this change in structure and its potential importance for cholesterol efflux from cholesterol-loaded macrophages was therefore investigated. In the presence of heparin, or HS, AP-HDL solutions at pH 5.2 became turbid within minutes. Analysis by centrifugation and gel electrophoresis indicated that AP-HDL was remodeled generating novel lipid poor particles composed only of apolipoprotein AI, which we designate beta2. This remodeling is dependent on pH, glycosaminoglycan type, is promoted by Ca(2+) and is independent of protease or lipase activity. Compared to HDL and AP-HDL, remodeled AP-HDL (S-HDL-SAA), containing beta2 particles, demonstrated a 3-fold greater cholesterol efflux activity from cholesterol-loaded macrophage. Because the identified conditions causing this change in AP-HDL structure and function can exist physiologically at the surface of the macrophage, or in its endosomes, we postulate that AP-HDL contains latent functionalities that become apparent and active when it associates with macrophage cell surface/endosomal HS. In this way initial steps in the reverse cholesterol transport pathway are focused at sites of injury to mobilize cholesterol from macrophages that are actively participating in the phagocytosis of damaged membranes rich in cholesterol. The mechanism may also be of relevance to aspects of atherogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2156971181,"The potential role and function of gastrokine-1 (GNK1) in smooth muscle cells is investigated in this work by first establishing a preparative protocol to obtain this native protein from freshly dissected chicken gizzard. Some unexpected biochemical properties of gastrokine-1 were deduced by producing specific polyclonal antibody against the purified protein. We focused on the F-actin interaction with gastrokine-1 and the potential role and function in smooth muscle contractile properties. Background GNK1 is thought to provide mucosal protection in the superficial gastric epithelium. However, the actual role of gastrokine-1 with regards to its known decreased expression in gastric cancer is still unknown. Recently, trefoil factors (TFF) were reported to have important roles in gastric epithelial regeneration and cell turnover, and could be involved in GNK1 interactions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role and function of GNK1 in smooth muscle cells. Methodology/Principal Findings From fresh chicken gizzard smooth muscle, an original purification procedure was used to purify a heat soluble 20 kDa protein that was sequenced and found to correspond to the gastrokine-1 protein sequence containing one BRICHOS domain and at least two or possibly three transmembrane regions. The purified protein was used to produce polyclonal antibody and highlighted the smooth muscle cell distribution and F-actin association of GNK1 through a few different methods. Conclusion/Significance Altogether our data illustrate a broader distribution of gastrokine-1 in smooth muscle than only in the gastrointestinal epithelium, and the specific interaction with F-actin highlights and suggests a new role and function of GNK1 within smooth muscle cells. A potential role via TFF interaction in cell-cell adhesion and assembly of actin stress fibres is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2031336272,"Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα)-induced hepatocyte death and liver injury can be mediated by multiple mechanisms, which could be evaluated by different animal models. Previous studies have defined the importance of Bid in mitochondrial apoptosis activation in adult mice treated with lipopolysaccharides in the presence of galactosamine (GalN), which suppresses NF-κB activation, but not in embryonic mice in which NF-κB activation is suppressed by genetic deletion of p65RelA. JNK has also been found important in TNFα-induced mitochondria activation and liver injury in the lipopolysaccharide/GalN and concanavalin A (ConA)/GalN models, but not in a ConA-only model in which NF-κB activation was not suppressed. To determine the mechanistic relationship of pathways mediated by Bid and JNK, we investigated these two molecules in TNFα injury models that had not been previously examined. Most importantly, we created and studied mice deficient in both Bid and JNK. We found that, like JNK, Bid was also required for TNFα-induced injury induced by concanavalin A/GalN but not by ConA alone. Furthermore, our results indicate that these two molecules function in a largely overlapped manner, with Bid being downstream of JNK in the adult livers. However, JNK, but not Bid, was able to contribute to the TNFα-induced liver apoptosis in RelA-deficient embryos. The Bid-independent role of JNK was also observed in the adult mice, mainly in the promotion of the lethal progression of the TNFα injury.

The classic mechanism is the activation of the extrinsic apoptosis pathway, in which the engagement of TNF-R1 (tumor necrosis factor receptor 1) recruits the adaptor molecules, TRADD and FADD, which in turn recruit caspase-8. The activation of caspase-8 leads to the cleavage of a prodeath Bcl-2 family protein, Bid, which then triggers the mitochondria apoptosis pathway (1Gross A. Yin X.M. Wang K. Wei M.C. Jockel J.

However, Bid-deficient mice are only partially protected from TNFα-induced liver injury in a model using LPS and GalN as the stimulation (5Zhao Y. Ding W.X. Qian T. Watkins S. Lemasters J.J. Yin X.M.

Fan Y. Gelinas C. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8961-8982Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). The protection could be abolished by a general transcription inhibitor, such as actinomycin D or GalN, or by a specific deletion of a key element in the NF-κB pathway, such as p65RelA. RelA is the critical component of the p65-p50 NF-κB dimers that are responsible for the prosurvival mechanisms, including the suppression of caspase and sustained JNK activation (8Kucharczak J. Simmons M.J. Fan Y. Gelinas C. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8961-8982Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar, 9Lin A. BioEssays. 2003; 25: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 10Schwabe R.F. Brenner D.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 290: G583-G589Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Deletion of RelA leads to defective NF-κB signaling, unrestrained TNFα toxicity, severe hepatocyte apoptosis, and embryonic lethality (11Beg A.A. Sha W.C. Bronson R.T. Ghosh S. Baltimore D. Nature. 1995; 376: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar). The liver injury and lethality could be rescued by a concomitant deletion of TNFα (12Doi T.S. Marino M.W. Takahashi T. Yoshida T. Sakakura T. Old L.J. Obata Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2994-2999Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), indicating that TNFα is the trigger of the demise. Deletion of Bid, however, was not able to suppress hepatocyte apoptosis and embryonic lethality caused by the deletion of p65RelA (6Chen X. Ding W.X. Ni H.M. Gao W. Shi Y.H. Gambotto A.A. Fan J.

Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 637-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). There are several possibilities that may account for the failure of Bid deficiency to protect TNFα-induced liver injury. One may relate to the form of TNFα presented to the receptors. In the model of LPS/GalN, TNFα is mainly produced by macrophages and Kupffer's cells stimulated by LPS, whereas GalN sensitizes hepatocytes. Notably, TNFα generated in this manner is mainly secreted. It has been found that soluble TNFα primarily activates TNF-R1, whereas membrane TNFα activates both TNF-R1 and TNF-R2 (14Grell M. Douni E. Wajant H. Lohden M. Clauss M. Maxeiner B. Georgopoulos S. Lesslauer W. Kollias G. Pfizenmaier K. Scheurich P. Cell. 1995; 83: 793-802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1134) Google Scholar). Since the two TNF receptors differ in their ability to activate the death pathway and the NF-κB pathway, it is possible that the membrane and soluble TNFα could induce cell death with different features, as manifested in the different models of TNFα injury (15Gantner F. Kusters S. Wendel A. Hatzelmann A. Schudt C. Tiegs G. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1997; 280: 53-60PubMed Google Scholar, 16Kusters S. Tiegs G. Alexopoulou L. Pasparakis M. Douni E. Kunstle G.

Immunity. 2003; 19: 725-737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). It is thus also possible that Bid-deficient mice might be more resistant to membrane TNFα in terms of liver injury (e.g. following the treatment with ConA or ConA/GalN). Another possibility is that additional death mechanisms other than Bid are activated by TNFα receptors. Our earlier studies indicate that JNK, reactive oxygen species, and mitochondria permeability transition could contribute to the Bid-independent mechanisms in TNFα-induced cell death (6Chen X. Ding W.X. Ni H.M. Gao W. Shi Y.H. Gambotto A.A. Fan J. Beg A.A. Yin X.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 541-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). JNKs have been long considered to be important for TNFα toxicity in both hepatocytes and nonhepatocytes (for reviews, see Refs. 9Lin A. BioEssays. 2003; 25: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar and 10Schwabe R.F. Brenner D.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 290: G583-G589Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Sustained JNK phosphorylation is correlated with TNFα toxicity and is observed when NF-κB activation is suppressed. Although there is a redundancy of JNK1 and JNK2, deletion of either could significantly block TNFα-induced death in hepatocytes in vitro (19Schwabe R.F. Uchinami H. Qian T. Bennett B.L.

Here we determined the relationship of the Bid-mediated pathway and the JNK-mediated pathway by examining mice deficient in Bid, JNK2, or both in several TNFα injury models where TNFα can be presented in soluble or membranous form. Animals—Wild-type and Bid-deficient mice were maintained in C57BL/6 background as previously described (2Yin X.M. Wang K. Gross A. Zhao Y. Zinkel S. Klocke B. Roth K.A. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1999; 400: 886-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). JNK1-deficient mice (B6.129S1-Mapk8tm1Flv/J) and JNK2-deficient mice (B6.129S2-Mapk9tm1Flv/J) maintained in C57BL/6 background were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Bid/JNK2 doubly deficient mice were created by intercrossing the Bid-deficient mice with the JNK2-deficient mice. Mice heterozygous for the p65relA gene were maintained in a mixed background of C57BL/6 and 129SvJ as previously described (6Chen X. Ding W.X. Ni H.M. Gao W. Shi Y.H. Gambotto A.A. Fan J. Beg A.A.

Animal procedures were conducted according to the guidelines of the National Institutes of Health and protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Pittsburgh. Reagents—The following antibodies were used: anti-caspase-8, anti-caspase-9, anti-caspase-3 (Cell Signaling, Boston, MA), anti-β-actin (Sigma), anti-cytochrome c, anti-Smac, anti-JNK (clone 666) (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA), anti-phosphorylated JNK and c-Jun (Cell Signaling), anti-p65RelA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), and anti-Bid (6Chen X.

GalN, LPS (Sigma L-2630, Escherichia coli 0111: B4), ConA, and phalloidin were obtained from Sigma. Treatment of Mice—Mice were treated as previously described (3Zhao Y. Li S. Childs E.E. Kuharsky D.K. Yin X.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27432-27440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 6Chen X. Ding W.X. Ni H.M. Gao W. Shi Y.H. Gambotto A.A. Fan J. Beg A.A. Yin X.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 541-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Briefly, male or female mice about 20–30 g in weight were intraperitoneally administered with GalN (20 mg/mice, for LPS study or 700 mg/kg for ConA study). Thirty minutes later, they were intraperitoneally given LPS at 50 μg/kg or intravenously given ConA at 25 mg/kg. All reagents were prepared in 0.9% (v/v) endotoxin-free sterile saline (Sigma). Animals were sacrificed at designated time points for analysis. Survival analysis was based on the time when mice became moribund. Preparation of Liver Subfractions—Liver homogenates were prepared and fractionated as described previously (3Zhao Y. Li S. Childs E.E. Kuharsky D.K. Yin X.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27432-27440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 6Chen X. Ding W.X. Ni H.M. Gao W. Shi Y.H. Gambotto A.A. Fan J. Beg A.A. Yin X.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 541-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Briefly, each liver was homogenized in 6 ml of Buffer A (200 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.2) with a Wheaten Dounce glass homogenizer (type B pestle) and centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min at 700 × g. The supernatants were further centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatants were collected as the cytosol fraction. For Western blot and caspase activity measurement, liver lysates from individual mice within the same treatment group were pooled to avoid any bias caused by conditions in individual mouse. Biochemical Assays—The serum level of ALT was measured using the assay kit purchased from Biotron Diagnostics (Hemet, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For immunoblot analysis, liver cytosol (80 μg) was separated by a 12% SDS-PAGE followed by transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and blotted with various antibodies as indicated. Blots were developed with SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). Caspase activities were measured as previously described (3Zhao Y. Li S. Childs E.E. Kuharsky D.K. Yin X.-M. J.

Biol. 2007; 27: 541-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Briefly, 15 μg of cytosol were incubated with 20 μm site-specific tetrapeptide substrates (Ac-DEVD-AFC for caspase-3, Ac-IETD-AFC for caspase-8, and Ac-LEHD-AFC for caspase-9; Calbiochem) in a caspase assay buffer (20 mm PIPES, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) CHAPS, 10% (w/v) sucrose, pH 7.2) in a final volume of 200 μl. The fluorescence signals were detected by a fluorometer (Tecan GENios) at an excitation wavelength of 400 nm and emission wavelength of 510 nm. Histology—Livers were dissected, fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, and paraffin-embedded. Sections were cut at 5 μm in thickness and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. In addition, frozen sections of livers from selected samples were stained with phalloidin and Hoechst 33342 to visualize the parenchymal structures and apoptotic nuclei. Images were obtained using a light microscope (Nikon Eclipse E200, Melville, CA) equipped with a digital camera (SPOT, Diagnostic Instruments, Sterling Heights, MI). Statistical Analysis—All numerical results were expressed as the mean ± S.D. and represent data from a minimum of three independent experiments. The statistical analysis was performed with Sigma Stat 3.0 (SPSS Science, Chicago, IL) with a p value of less than 0.05 being considered as a significant difference. The survival rate was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method, and significance was determined by log rank analysis using SigmaStat 3.0 (SPSS Science). Bid Is Important but Not Absolutely Required for the Mitochondria Apoptotic Response and Liver Injury Caused by ConA/GalN Treatment—To determine whether Bid-deficient mice would respond to membrane TNFα in a way different from that to soluble TNFα, mice were administrated with ConA, a T cell mitogen that leads to the increased expression of TNFα on the surface of T cells, which is the cytokine primarily responsible for the liver injury (26Gantner F.

Unlike LPS, ConA alone could induce a reversible and mild liver injury without the sensitization with GalN (27Trautwein C. Rakemann T. Brenner D.A. Streetz K. Licato L. Manns M.P. Tiegs G. Gastroenterology. 1998; 114: 1035-1045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 28Kunstle G. Hentze H. Germann P.G. Tiegs G. Meergans T. Wendel A. Hepatology. 1999; 30: 1241-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). However, when mice are sensitized with GalN, a significantly more severe injury can be induced with a rapid development of hepatocyte apoptosis, and the mortality is high (28Kunstle G. Hentze H. Germann P.G. Tiegs G. Meergans T. Wendel A. Hepatology. 1999; 30: 1241-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Bid-deficient mice seemed to be equally susceptible to ConA-only-induced liver injury as the wild type mice but were significantly protected from the more severe injury caused by ConA/GalN (Fig. 1, A and B). Previous work had indicated that liver injury induced by ConA alone was not primarily caused by a caspase-mediated apoptotic process (23Ni H.M. Chen X. Ding W.X. Schuchmann M. Yin X.M. Am. J. Pathol. 2008; 173: 962-972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 28Kunstle G. Hentze H. Germann P.G. Tiegs G. Meergans T. Wendel A. Hepatology. 1999; 30: 1241-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Consistently, caspase activation was not detected in either wild type or Bid-deficient livers 8 h after treatment when cellular injury was already apparent (Fig. 1C). However, in the presence of GalN, ConA could induce very robust caspase activation (Figs. 1D and 2A). Similar to the LPS/GalN regime, a ConA/GalN regime can induce a significant activation of the mitochondria apoptotic pathway with the release of cytochrome c and Smac around 4–6 h after the treatment (Fig. 1D). This kinetics was well correlated with the caspase activity arising at the same time frame (Fig. 2A). Notably, both the mitochondrial response and caspase activation were greatly diminished in Bid-deficient livers in terms of the kinetics and the severity (Fig. 1D), indicating that Bid, as in other cases of death receptor activation, is also the major molecule mediating the mitochondria activation in response to membrane TNFα in the ConA/GalN regime. Bid-independent activation of mitochondria and caspases occurred later (Fig. 1D), much like that observed in the LPS/GalN regime (6Chen X. Ding W.X. Ni H.M. Gao W. Shi Y.H. Gambotto A.A. Fan J. Beg A.A. Yin X.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 541-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The apoptotic response apparently dictated the fast progression of the liver injury in ConA/GalN treatment. Consistent with caspase activation, serum levels of ALT, a marker of liver injury, was increased at 4 and 6 h after treatment in wild-type and Bid-deficient mice, respectively (Fig. 2C). Thus, based on serum ALT and liver histology, deletion of Bid attenuated liver injury induced by ConA/GalN. All wild type mice died within 24 h, with a mean survival time of 7.45 h (Fig. 2D and Table 1). Deletion of Bid resulted in a noticeable but not significant prolonged survival time (8.14 h), and all mice still died within 24 h.TABLE 1Survival analysis of mice with different Bid and JNK genotypes in TNF α-induced liver injury n is the number of mice used in each group.

Wendel A. Hepatology. 1999; 30: 1241-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), which was not affected by the deletion of Bid. However, in the ConA/GalN scenario, deletion of Bid provided a significant protection against caspase activation and attenuated the injury and mortality. The failure of Bid-deficient mice to be completely protected from ConA/GalN treatment suggested that the Bid-independent mechanism could be activated regardless the form of TNFα, soluble or membranous. Co-deletion of Bid and JNK2 Revealed both Overlapped and Nonoverlapped Functions of the Two Molecules—We thus went on to search whether additional prodeath molecules could be activated downstream of TNFα signaling that might compensate for the loss of Bid. In our earlier in vitro studies, we found that JNK and reactive oxygen species could contribute to the Bid-independent mechanisms (6Chen X. Ding W.X. Ni H.M. Gao W. Shi Y.H. Gambotto A.A. Fan J. Beg A.A. Yin X.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 541-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Interestingly, mice deficient in JNK2 were found to be significantly protected from LPS/GalN-induced (21Wang Y. Singh R. Lefkowitch J.H. Rigoli R.M. Czaja M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15258-15267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) (Fig. S1) or ConA/GalN-induced (23Ni H.M. Chen X. Ding W.X. Schuchmann M. Yin X.M. Am. J. Pathol. 2008; 173: 962-972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) hepatocyte apoptosis and liver injury. We also found that JNK1-deficient mice had similar phenotypes, although less significant than JNK2-deficient mice (23Ni H.M. Chen X. Ding W.X. Schuchmann M. Yin X.M. Am. J. Pathol. 2008; 173: 962-972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) (Fig. S1). To further determine the relationship of the signaling pathways mediated by Bid and JNK, we established mice deficient in both Bid and JNK2 and compared their response with that of the singly deficient mice in the two models of liver injury. The results suggested that the Bid-mediated pathway and the JNK2-mediated pathway were largely but not completely overlapped. Bid deletion had a more dramatic impact than JNK2 deletion on caspase activation and mitochondrial release of apoptogenic factors at the early time point (5–6 h) after ConA/GalN (Fig. 2, A and B) or LPS/GalN (Fig. 3, A and B) stimulation. Co-deletion of Bid and JNK2 did not result in a stronger inhibition than deletion of Bid alone, suggesting that most of the JNK2 effects on caspase activation were mediated by Bid. At the later time point (8 h after treatment), the Bid-independent activation of caspases became more evident, as revealed before (6Chen X. Ding W.X. Ni H.M. Gao W. Shi Y.H. Gambotto A.A. Fan J. Beg A.A. Yin X.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 541-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, deletion of JNK2 did not seem to consistently or significantly confer any better protections than Bid deletion alone; nor did the double deletion of Bid and JNK2 (Figs. 2A and 3A). Large variations were observed among individual mice. Overall, the data seemed to indicate that JNK may not play a key role in Bid-independent caspase activation in these in vivo models. The effects of these two molecules on blood liver enzyme levels were similar. Deletion of Bid, but not JNK2, had noticeable inhibitory effects on blood ALT levels, and combined deletion of Bid and JNK2 did not further reduce the level (Figs. 2C and 3C), suggesting that Bid was mainly responsible for the liver damage and that most of the injury was probably caused by Bid-mediated caspase activation, which could overlap with that mediated by JNK. Paradoxically, deletion of JNK1 or JNK2 conferred a greater protection against mortality than deletion of Bid, with JNK2 deletion being more significant (Figs. 2D and 3D and Table 1). However, co-deletion of JNK2 and Bid resulted in the best protection, particularly in the LPS/GalN models. In the ConA/GalN model, although the mean survival times were similar between the JNK2-deficient and Bid/JNK2-deficient mice (13.15 and 13.26 h, respectively), the survival rate was 15.4 and 27.3% (Table 1). These differences were even larger in the LPS/GalN model with 40% of Bid/JNK2-deficient mice surviving and a mean survival time of 15.01 h, whereas 16.7% of JNK2-deficient mice survived, with a mean survival time of 10.86 h. Thus, it seems that although JNK had less impact on caspase activation and blood ALT levels, it had a significantly greater impact on the mortality, suggesting that mortality is not necessarily all caused by Bid-mediated caspase activation and that JNK might have other major effects on the animal survival. From this aspect, JNK and Bid had apparently nonoverlapped functions. Deletion of JNK1 or Deletion of JNK2 Alone or in Combination with Bid Could Not Fully Rescue TNFα-dependent p65RelA Deficiency-induced Embryonic Lethality and Apoptosis in the Liver—p65RelA is the critical component of the p65-p50 NF-κB complex, which mediates the canonical NF-κB pathway following TNFα stimulation (8Kucharczak J.

Consequently, species living in seasonally cold environments have evolved a multitude of strategies to reorganize their cellular architecture and metabolism, and the underlying mechanisms are crucial to our understanding of life. In multicellular organisms, and poikilotherm animals in particular, our knowledge about these processes is almost exclusively due to invasive studies, thereby limiting the range of conclusions that can be drawn about intact living systems. Methodology Given that non-destructive techniques like 1H Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging and spectroscopy have proven useful for in vivo investigations of a wide range of biological systems, we aimed at evaluating their potential to observe cold adaptations in living insect larvae. Specifically, we chose two cold-hardy insect species that frequently serve as cryobiological model systems–the freeze-avoiding gall moth Epiblema scudderiana and the freeze-tolerant gall fly Eurosta solidaginis. Results In vivo MR images were acquired from autumn-collected larvae at temperatures between 0°C and about −70°C and at spatial resolutions down to 27 µm. These images revealed three-dimensional (3D) larval anatomy at a level of detail currently not in reach of other in vivo techniques. Furthermore, they allowed visualization of the 3D distribution of the remaining liquid water and of the endogenous cryoprotectants at subzero temperatures, and temperature-weighted images of these distributions could be derived. Finally, individual fat body cells and their nuclei could be identified in intact frozen Eurosta larvae. Conclusions These findings suggest that high resolution MR techniques provide for interesting methodological options in comparative cryobiological investigations, especially in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2060990244,"The mammalian class IX myosin Myo9b can move considerable distances along actin filaments before it dissociates. This is remarkable, because it is single headed and because the rate-limiting step in its ATPase cycle is ATP hydrolysis. Thus, it spends most of its cycling time in the ATP-bound state that has a weak affinity for F-actin in other myosins. It has been speculated that the very extended loop 2 in the Myo9b head domain comprises an additional actin-binding site that prevents it from dissociation in the weak binding states. Here we show that two regions in the loop 2 determine the F-actin concentrations needed to maximally activate the steady-state ATPase activity. Together these two regions regulate the amount capable of binding F-actin and the affinity of the nucleotide-free state. The isolated loop 2 behaved like an entropic spring and bound stoichiometrically and with high affinity to F-actin. Subfragment 1 from skeletal muscle myosin II bound to F-actin simultaneously with the isolated loop 2 of Myo9b and could not displace it. Furthermore, the present results imply also a regulatory role for the tail region. Taken together, the results demonstrate that the extended loop 2 in Myo9b binds F-actin and influences the binding of the conventional stereo-specific actin-binding site."
https://openalex.org/W2085975452,"In eukaryotes, proteins enter the secretory pathway through the translocon pore of the endoplasmic reticulum. This protein translocation channel is composed of three major subunits, called Sec61alpha, beta and gamma in mammals. Unlike the other subunits, the beta subunit is dispensable for translocation and cell viability in all organisms studied. Intriguingly, the knockout of the Sec61beta encoding genes results in different phenotypes in different species. Nevertheless, the beta subunit shows a high level of sequence homology across species, suggesting the conservation of a biological function that remains ill-defined. To address its cellular roles, we characterized the homolog of Sec61beta in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe (Sbh1p). Here, we show that the knockout of sbh1(+) results in severe cold sensitivity, increased sensitivity to cell-wall stress, and reduced protein secretion at 23 degrees C. Sec61beta homologs from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and human complement the knockout of sbh1(+) in S. pombe. As in S. cerevisiae, the transmembrane domain (TMD) of S. pombe Sec61beta is sufficient to complement the phenotypes resulting from the knockout of the entire encoding gene. Remarkably, the TMD of Sec61beta from S. cerevisiae and human also complement the gene knockouts in both yeasts. Together, these observations indicate that the TMD of Sec61beta exerts a cellular function that is conserved across species."

https://openalex.org/W2059629837,"The pattern-recognition receptors of the innate immune system, such as Toll-like receptors, bind specific repetitive components of microbes, including lipoproteins, lipopolysaccharides and nucleic acids. The location of some of these receptors in distinct subcellular compartments facilitates detection of intracellular pathogens but presumably precludes activation by self molecules that are structural homologs of microbial ligands. For example, Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) is located within endosomes and recognizes double-stranded DNA released from bacteria and viruses, which often infect or traffic through endosomes and phagolysosomes.

In a recent study, Lande et al.1 show how self DNA can move from an extracellular location directly to endosomes, resulting in activation of the innate immune system via TLR9. This activation may contribute to the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease but can also enhance host defense to infection.

Normally, the release of self DNA has no impact on the innate immune response, because the DNA cannot enter cells spontaneously to gain access to endosomes and TLR9. The break-through of Lande et al.1 in understanding how self ligands gain access to and activate TLRs came from the study of psoriasis, a skin disease triggered by autoimmune T cells.

In planning their experiments, Lande et al.1 followed clues from the clinic. In 1872, at the Silesian Society for National Culture, Heinrich Kobner presented the curious case of a patient. In this individual, several “traumatic” events, for instance, tattoos and animal bites, triggered new psoriatic skin lesions at exactly the same location and with the identical shape of the injured skin2. Classically, psoriasis presents at the sites that are the most subjected to trauma: elbows and knees. Given such bedside observations, Lande et al.1 reasoned that trauma would trigger keratinocyte cell death, releasing self DNA.

The next clue came from the observation that psoriasis lesions almost never get secondarily infected. Researchers tracing the cause found that psoriatic lesions contain elevated levels of the antimicrobial peptide cathelicidin (also known as LL-37)3, whose expression is increased in keratinocytes by specific stimuli4.

Lande et al.1 reasoned that damaged keratinocytes could release cathelicidin and self DNA simultaneously. They further predicted that these two molecules could interact on the basis of charge interactions, because cathelicidin is a cationic α-helical protein, and DNA has a negatively charged phosphodiester backbone. Lande et al.1 found that the combination of cathelicidin and self DNA created a surprisingly treacherous agglomeration. Aggregated complexes of DNA and cathelicidin were found to gain access to endosomes of plasmacytoid dendritic cells, resulting in the activation of TLR9 and release of interferon-α, a trigger of autoimmune T cell responses.

These findings reveal that cathelicidin is a transporter for DNA, delivering it to TLR9 in endosomes. It remains to be determined whether a similar transport mechanism for RNA and its relevant TLRs contributes to host defense, disease pathology or both.

The nucleic acid transporter function of cathelicidin probably evolved for responding to wounding and microbial infection (Fig. 1). Cathelicidin is upregulated after tissue injury as part of the wound-healing response4. In this response, nucleic acids released from damaged cells complex with cathelicidin, leading to activation of intracellular TLRs and initiating an inflammatory response to augment the immune response to microbes. In human macrophages and epithelial cells, activation of cell surface TLR2 by microbial ligands triggers the vitamin D-dependent induction of cathelicidin and the destruction of bacteria and viruses4-6. DNA released by these damaged microbes would probably complex with cathelicidin and be transported to endosomes to activate intracellular TLRs—resulting in amplification of host defense pathways. The dual activation of TLRs triggers a synergy in host defense, as demonstrated by the cooperative roles of TLR2 and TLR9 in optimal resistance to mycobacterial infection7.

If the ability of cathelicidin to transport nucleic acids to TLR-bearing intracellular compartments is part of the physiological danger response to injury and infection, what has gone awry in autoimmune disease? Possible factors favoring autoimmunity include the persistent overproduction of cathelicidin and the trafficking of plasmacytoid dendritic cells to the disease site (in the normal wound healing response, cathelicidin production is transient, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells are not prominent). Although cathelicidin can mediate antimicrobial activity as part of innate immunity, its ability to allow self DNA to activate the innate immune system provides a possible mechanism to break tolerance to self antigens.

The work of Lande et al.1 has broad implications for the pathogenesis of other human diseases. Other pathways may inappropriately trigger TLR9, such as immune complexes containing DNA-specific antibodies and DNA, which correlate with disease activity in individuals with systemic lupus erythematosus. Proteins other than cathelicidin with the capacity to bind self DNA may also facilitate transport across cell membranes into endosomes. What’s more, the ability of microbial pathogens to mimic this transporter function may contribute to disease pathology. For example, the pigment hemazoin of Plasmodium falciparum targets parasite DNA to TLR9-containing compartments, providing a mechanism for the classic fever observed in malaria8.

The discovery that cathelicidin is the transportation authority for DNA provides new opportunities for therapeutic intervention. In the context of autoimmune disease, it should be possible to block the formation of nucleic acid-transporter protein complexes or limit the activity of accessory molecules which direct these complexes to endosomes.

The cathelicidin transport pathway could also potentially be harnessed to enhance wound healing and combat infection. For example, serum vitamin D concentrations correlate with the ability of the innate immune system to induce cathelicidin as part of an antimicrobial response. Already, clinical trials are underway to determine whether vitamin D supplementation of individuals at risk for infection will augment host defense mechanisms required to prevent infection or improve the response to therapy9,10. Increasing cathelicidin levels may also facilitate the recognition of microbial nucleic acids by TLRs to further activate the host innate immune response. Bacterial DNA sequences are often used as vaccine adjuvants, and, therefore, modulation of trafficking pathways by adding cathelicidins or similar transport molecules could program optimal activation of the innate immune response.

The identification of a new nucleic acid transportation system provides the opportunity to intervene at the bedside. The challenge will be to harness the activity of this system to promote host defense without triggering autoimmunity."
