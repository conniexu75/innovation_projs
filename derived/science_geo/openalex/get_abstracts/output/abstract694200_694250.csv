https://openalex.org/W4281560859,"A growing body of evidence supports that pentadecanoic acid (C15:0), an odd-chain saturated fat found in butter, is an essential fatty acid that is necessary in the diet to support long-term metabolic and heart health. Here, dose dependent and clinically relevant cell-based activities of pure C15:0 (FA15TM) were compared to eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), a leading omega-3 fatty acid, as well as to an additional 4,500 compounds. These studies included 148 clinically relevant biomarkers measured across 12 primary human cell systems, mimicking various disease states, that were treated with C15:0 at four different concentrations (1.9 to 50 μM) and compared to non-treated control systems. C15:0 was non-cytotoxic at all concentrations and had dose dependent, broad anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative activities involving 36 biomarkers across 10 systems. In contrast, EPA was cytotoxic to four cell systems at 50 μM. While 12 clinically relevant activities were shared between C15:0 and EPA at 17 μM, C15:0 had an additional 28 clinically relevant activities, especially anti-inflammatory, that were not present in EPA. Further, at 1.9 and 5.6 μM, C15:0 had cell-based properties similar to bupropion (Pearson's scores of 0.78), a compound commonly used to treat depression and other mood disorders. At 5.6 μM, C15:0 mimicked two antimicrobials, climabazole and clarithromycin (Pearson's scores of 0.76 and 0.75, respectively), and at 50 μM, C15:0 activities matched that of two common anti-cancer therapeutics, gemcitabine and paclitaxel (Pearson's scores of 0.77 and 0.74, respectively). In summary, C15:0 had dose-dependent and clinically relevant activities across numerous human cell-based systems that were broader and safer than EPA, and C15:0 activities paralleled common therapeutics for mood disorders, microbial infections, and cancer. These studies further support the emerging role of C15:0 as an essential fatty acid."
https://openalex.org/W4281556975,"Diarrhoea accounts for high morbidity and mortality in children and adults worldwide. Extended Spectrum Beta-Lactamase-Producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-PE) and Diarrhoeagenic Escherichia coli (DEC) contribute to prolonged hospitalization because of their resistance and virulence properties aiding in the spread of diarrhoeal disease and delayed treatment.To determine DEC and the antimicrobial resistance of ESBL-PE isolated among diarrhoea patients attending two health facilities in Ghana.Stool samples were collected from 122 diarrhoeal patients who attended Maamobi General Hospital and Kaneshie Polyclinic between January 2019 and March 2020. Identification of bacteria was performed by using the Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Using disk diffusion, antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) was conducted and interpreted according to the 2018 CLSI guidelines. Detection of ESBL and DEC genes was performed using Polymerase chain reaction (PCR).A total of 80.3% (98/122) Enterobacteriaceae was recovered from the patients in the study with an overall ESBL occurrence of 20.4% (20/98), predominantly among E. coli showed 13.2% (10/76), Klebsiella pneumoniae,35.7%(5/14) and Proteus mirabilis, 57.1%(4/7). Among the ESBL genes detected, blaTEM (n = 14) was common, followed by blaCTX-M (n = 13) and blaSHV (n = 4). Thirty-four E. coli isolates possessed the heat labile (Lt) gene of Enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC).Our findings confirm the existence of DEC and the antimicrobial resistance patterns of ESBL-PE among stool isolates, limiting the options of commonly used drugs for diarrhoeal treatment in Ghana. Routine laboratory testing in health care facilities and strengthened surveillance systems among hospital networks are encouraged for a better understanding of their epidemiology and clinical implications."
https://openalex.org/W4281843585,"The study aimed to investigate the effect of early mobilization combined with early nutrition (EMN) on intensive care unit-acquired weakness (ICU-AW) in intensive care unit (ICU) settings compared with early mobilization (EM) or routine care.A prospective, dual-center, randomized controlled trial was conducted. The control group underwent standard care without a pre-established routine for mobilization and nutrition. The EM group underwent early, individualized, progressive mobilization within 24 h of ICU admission. The EMN group underwent early mobilization, similar to the EM group plus guideline-based early nutrition (within 48 h of ICU admission). The primary outcome was the occurrence of ICU-AW at discharge from the ICU. Secondary outcomes included muscle strength, functional independence, organ failure, nutritional status, duration of mechanical ventilation (MV), length of ICU stay, and ICU mortality at ICU discharge.A total of 150 patients were enrolled and equally distributed into the three groups. Patients undergoing routine care only were more susceptible to ICU-AW upon ICU discharge than those in the EM or EMN groups (16% vs. 2%; p = 0.014 for both), and had a lower Barthel Index than others (control vs. EM/EMN: 57.5 vs 70.0; p = 0.022). The EMN group had improved muscle strength (p = 0.028) and better nutritional status than the control group (p = 0.031). Both interventions were associated with a lower ICU-AW (EM vs. control: p = 0.027, OR [95% CI] = 0.066 [0.006-0.739]; EMN vs. control: p = 0.016, OR [95% CI] = 0.065 [0.007-0.607]).EM and EMN had positive effects. There was little difference between the effects of EM and EMN, except for muscle strength improvement. Both EM and EMN may lead to a lower occurrence of ICU-AW and better functional independence than standard care. EMN might benefit nutritional status more than usual care and promote improvement in muscle strength."
https://openalex.org/W4281560602,"Two genetic variants in strong linkage disequilibrium (rs9536314 and rs9527025) in the Klotho ( KL ) gene, encoding a transmembrane protein, implicated in longevity and associated with brain resilience during normal aging, were recently shown to be associated with Alzheimer disease (AD) risk in cognitively normal participants who are APOE ε4 carriers. Specifically, the participants heterozygous for this variant (KL-SV HET+ ) showed lower risk of developing AD. Furthermore, a neuroprotective effect of KL-VS HET+ has been suggested against amyloid burden for cognitively normal participants, potentially mediated via the regulation of redox pathways. However, inconsistent associations and a smaller sample size of existing studies pose significant hurdles in drawing definitive conclusions. Here, we performed a well-powered association analysis between KL-VS HET+ and five different AD endophenotypes; brain amyloidosis measured by positron emission tomography (PET) scans (n = 5,541) or cerebrospinal fluid Aβ42 levels (CSF; n = 5,093), as well as biomarkers associated with tau pathology: the CSF Tau (n = 5,127), phosphorylated Tau (pTau181; n = 4,778) and inflammation: CSF soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (sTREM2; n = 2,123) levels. Our results found nominally significant associations of KL-VS HET+ status with biomarkers for brain amyloidosis (e.g., CSF Aβ positivity; odds ratio [OR] = 0.67 [95% CI, 0.55–0.78], β = 0.72, p = 0.007) and tau pathology (e.g., biomarker positivity for CSF Tau; OR = 0.39 [95% CI, 0.19–0.77], β = -0.94, p = 0.007, and pTau; OR = 0.50 [95% CI, 0.27–0.96], β = -0.68, p = 0.04) in cognitively normal participants, 60–80 years old, who are APOE e4-carriers. Our work supports previous findings, suggesting that the KL-VS HET+ on an APOE ε4 genotype background may modulate Aβ and tau pathology, thereby lowering the intensity of neurodegeneration and incidence of cognitive decline in older controls susceptible to AD."
https://openalex.org/W4281562827,"Phenothiazines (PTZ) were developed as inhibitors of monoamine neurotransmitter receptors, notably dopamine receptors. Because of this activity they have been used for decades as antipsychotic drugs. In addition, they possess significant anti-cancer properties and several attempts for their repurposing were made. However, their incompletely understood polypharmacology is challenging. Here we examined the potential of the PTZ fluphenazine (Flu) and its mustard derivative (Flu-M) to synergistically act on two cancer associated targets, calmodulin (CaM) and the tumor suppressor protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). Both proteins are known to modulate the Ras- and MAPK-pathway, cell viability and features of cancer cell stemness. Consistently, we show that the combination of a CaM inhibitor and the PP2A activator DT-061 synergistically inhibited the 3D-spheroid formation of MDA-MB-231 (K-Ras-G13D), NCI-H358 (K-Ras-G12C) and A375 (B-raf-V600E) cancer cells, and increased apoptosis in MDA-MB-231. We reasoned that these activities remain combined in PTZ, which were the starting point for PP2A activator development, while several PTZ are known CaM inhibitors. We show that both Flu and Flu-M retained CaM inhibitory activity in vitro and in cells, with a higher potency of the mustard derivative in cells. In line with the CaM dependence of Ras plasma membrane organization, the mustard derivative potently reduced the functional membrane organization of oncogenic Ras, while DT-061 had a negligible effect. Like DT-061, both PTZ potently decreased c-MYC levels, a hallmark of PP2A activation. Benchmarking against the KRAS-G12C specific inhibitor AMG-510 in MIA PaCa-2 cells revealed a higher potency of Flu-M than combinations of DT-061 and a CaM inhibitor on MAPK-output and a strong effect on cell proliferation. While our study is limited, our results suggest that improved PTZ derivatives that retain both, their CaM inhibitory and PP2A activating properties, but have lost their neurological side-effects, may be interesting to pursue further as anti-cancer agents."
https://openalex.org/W4281551900,"Multimorbidity is a global research priority, yet relatively little is known about it in low and middle income countries. South Africa has the largest burden of HIV worldwide but also has a growing burden of non-communicable diseases; potentially leading to uncommon disease combinations. Information about the prevalence of multimorbidity and factors associated with it can assist in healthcare planning and targeting groups of people for interventions. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of multimorbidity by age and sex, as well as factors associated with multimorbidity in people 15 years and older. This study analyses the nationally representative 2016 South African Demographic Health Survey. The sample included 10 336 people who participated in the Adult Health questionnaire and approximately 7 961 people who provided biomarkers. Multivariate logistic regression was used to measure the association of multimorbidity with age, sex, living in an urban or rural area, education level, wealth level, employment status, body mass index, current alcohol or tobacco use. All analyses were conducted using STATA 15. Multimorbidity was present in 20.7% (95% CI: 19.5%- 21.9%) of participants; in 14.8% (95% CI: 13.4% - 16.3%) of males and 26.2% (95% CI: 24.7-27.7%) of females. Multimorbidity increased with age; with the highest odds in the 55-64 years old age group (OR: 24.910, 95% CI: 14.901-41.641, p < 0.001) compared to those aged 15-24 years. The odds of multimorbidity was also higher in young females compared to young males (OR: 2.734, 95% CI: 1.50-4.99, p = 0.001). Possessing tertiary education (OR: 0.722, 95% CI: 0.537-0.97, p = 0.031), being employed (OR: 0.813, 95% CI: 0.675-0.979, p = 0.029) or currently using alcohol (OR: 0.815, 95% CI: 0.686-0.968, p = 0.02) was protective against multimorbidity. Multimorbidity is prevalent within the South African population, with females and older adults being most affected. However, multimorbidity is also observed in younger adults and most likely driven by the high prevalence of HIV and hypertension."
https://openalex.org/W4281690009,"Little is known about how people with multiple sclerosis (MS) and their families comprehend advance care planning (ACP) and its relevance in their lives.To explore under what situations, with whom, how, and why do people with MS and their families engage in ACP.We conducted a qualitative study comprising interviews with people living with MS and their families followed by an ethical discussion group with five health professionals representing specialties working with people affected by MS and their families. Twenty-seven people with MS and 17 family members were interviewed between June 2019 and March 2020. Interviews and the ethical discussion group were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data were analysed using the framework approach.Participants' narratives focused on three major themes: (i) planning for an uncertain future; (ii) perceived obstacles to engaging in ACP that included uncertainty concerning MS disease progression, negative previous experiences of ACP discussions and prioritising symptom management over future planning; (iii) Preferences for engagement in ACP included a trusting relationship with a health professional and that information then be shared across services. Health professionals' accounts from the ethical discussion group departed from viewing ACP as a formal document to that of an ongoing process of seeking preferences and values. They voiced similar concerns to people with MS about uncertainty and when to initiate ACP-related discussions. Some shared concerns of their lack of confidence when having these discussions.These findings support the need for a whole system strategic approach where information about the potential benefits of ACP in all its forms can be shared with people with MS. Moreover, they highlight the need for health professionals to be skilled and trained in engaging in ACP discussions and where information is contemporaneously and seamlessly shared across services."
https://openalex.org/W4281909788,"Microbes have central roles in the development and health of animals, being the introduction of specific microbial species a potential conservation strategy to protect animals from emerging diseases. Thus, insight into the microbiota of the species and their habitats is essential. In this manuscript, we report for the first time the bacterial composition of all the components (eggshells of hatched and unhatched eggs, internal content of unhatched eggs, intestinal content of hatchling and pipping sea turtles, and sand) of three nesting beaches of Caretta caretta along the Italian coasts of the Mediterranean Sea. The analysis of 26 amplicon samples was carried out using next-generation sequencing analysis, targeting V3–V4 regions of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. Samples featured mainly Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Bacteroidetes, whose percentages depended on the sample type. Our results showed that, although from different sampling sites, the internal content of the unhatched eggs, intestinal content of hatchling and pipping sea turtles share the microbiota, which was yet different from that of eggshells and sand of the same nesting beach. This study suggests the maternal and environmental influence alongside a protective role of eggshells in shaping the egg microbiota of Caretta caretta sea turtles."
https://openalex.org/W4281563048,"Objectives Small proline-rich protein 1A (SPRR1A) is recognized as a squamous differentiation marker but is also upregulated in some non-squamous cancers. However, its expression in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has not been investigated. This study elucidated the expression of SPRR1A in PDAC and its effect on the prognosis and malignant behavior of PDAC. Methods We examined the SPRR1A expression by immunohistochemistry in 86 surgical PDAC cases and revealed the relationship between its expression and the prognosis of the PDAC patients. Furthermore, we overexpressed SPRR1A in pancreatic cancer cell lines (PK-1 and Panc-1) and assessed the phenotype and gene expression changes in vitro . Results Among the 84 cases, excluding 2 with squamous differentiation, 31 (36.9%) had a high SPRR1A expression. The overall survival (median 22.1 months vs. 33.6 months, p = 0.0357) and recurrence-free survival (median 10.7 months vs. 15.5 months, p = 0.0298) were significantly lower in the high-SPRR1A-expression group than in the low-SPRR1A-expression group. A multivariate analysis indicated that a high SPRR1A expression (HR 1.706, 95% CI 1.018 to 2.862, p = 0.0427) and residual tumor status (HR 2.687, 95% CI 1.487 to 4.855, p = 0.00106) were independent prognostic factors. The analysis of TCGA transcriptome data demonstrated that the high-SPRR1A-expression group had a significantly worse prognosis than the low-SPRR1A-expression group, which supported our data. SPRR1A overexpression in PK-1 and Panc-1 did not result in remarkable changes to in vitro phenotypes, such as the cell proliferation, chemo-resistance, EMT, migration or global gene expression. Conclusion Increased expression of SPRR1A is associated with a poor prognosis in PDAC and may serve as a novel prognostic marker. However, our in vitro study suggests that the SPRR1A expression may be a consequence, not a cause, of the aggressive behavior of PDAC."
https://openalex.org/W4281569167,"Poultry litter is applied to crop production land in the southern United States as a waste management strategy as it is a nitrogen-rich fertilizer and plentiful throughout the region. While litter is a known reservoir for human enteric pathogens including Salmonella enterica, little is known regarding pathogen prevalence, concentration, and common serotypes within the material. Litter from thirteen farms across four southern states was examined for Salmonella. Samples (n = 490) from six of the thirteen (46.2%) farms tested positive. Thirty-three samples out of 490 (6.7%) were Salmonella positive. Salmonella was ca. 95% less likely to be collected from stacked litter piles than from the poultry house floor or pasture, and every day increase in litter age reduced the likelihood of recovering Salmonella by 5.1%. When present, concentrations of Salmonella in contaminated poultry litter were variable, ranging from <0.45 to >280,000 MPN/g. The most prevalent serotypes found were Kentucky (45.5%), Kiambu (18.2%), and Michigan (12.1%). Salmonella Kentucky also had the greatest distribution and was found on 4 of the 6 (66.7%) positive farms. Results from this survey demonstrated that Salmonella prevalence and concentration in poultry litter is highly variable, and good agricultural practices are critical to safely use poultry litter as a soil amendment on fresh produce fields."
https://openalex.org/W4281553805,"Understanding biotic changes that occur alongside climate change constitute a research priority of global significance. Here, we address a plant pathogen that poses a serious threat to life on natural oases, where climate change is already taking a toll and severely impacting human subsistence. Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. albedinis is a pathogen that causes dieback disease on date palms, a tree that provides several critical ecosystem services in natural oases; and consequently, of major importance in this vulnerable habitat. Here, we assess the current state of global pathogen spread, we annotate the genome of a sequenced pathogen strain isolated from the native range and we analyse its in silico secretome. The palm dieback pathogen secretes a large arsenal of effector candidates including a variety of toxins, a distinguished profile of secreted in xylem proteins (SIX) as well as an expanded protein family with an N-terminal conserved motif [SG]PC[KR]P that could be involved in interactions with host membranes. Using agrobiodiversity as a strategy to decrease pathogen infectivity, while providing short term resilient solutions, seems to be widely overcome by the pathogen. Hence, the urgent need for future mechanistic research on the palm dieback disease and a better understanding of pathogen genetic diversity."
https://openalex.org/W4281556118,"The utilization of Islamic social finance instruments is far behind what is expected. To realize its full potential, Islamic social finance instruments must be integrated. This study examined solutions and priority strategies for integrating sustainable Islamic social finance that could be implemented in the short and long term using the Benefit, Opportunity, Cost, and Risk (BOCR) framework, which includes six aspects: Governance, sustainable financing, institutional aspect, human resources, regulations, and supporting technology. This qualitative research employed the Analytic Network Process (ANP) method using the benefit, opportunity, cost, and risk analysis. The data were obtained mainly through focus group discussions and in-depth interviews with respondents among academics, practitioners, associations, regulators, and community leaders. The respondents were selected for their expertise and experience in the selected topic. The data were processed using the Microsoft Excel and Super Decision software. There are several findings worth considering from the analysis. First, the highest priority in integrating Islamic social finance aspects are human resources (0.97), regulation (0.86), and technology (0.76). Second, based on the short- and long-term analysis, financial integration through sustainable financing (0.01 and 1.44, respectively) and improving human resource quality through certification and training (0.01 and 1.56, respectively) is a priority solution and strategy to integrate sustainable Islamic social finance. Meanwhile, according to expert judgments, integrating national data (0.24) and optimizing technology use (0.18) are priority solutions and strategies. The findings emphasize the critical role of improving human resource quality to utilize technology, with experts identifying a national data integration as the most critical solution. As a result, relevant stakeholders are concerned about technology management training for Islamic philanthropic managers, with the goal of maximizing the potential of technology's growing role and adoption."
https://openalex.org/W4281556565,"The consumption of packaged water in Ghana has grown significantly in recent years. By 2017, “sachet water”—machine-sealed 500ml plastic bags of drinking water—was consumed by 33% of Ghanaian households. Reliance on sachet water has previously been associated with the urban poor, yet recent evidence suggests a customer base which crosses socioeconomic lines. Here, we conduct a repeated cross-sectional analysis of three nationally representative datasets to examine the changing demography of sachet water consumers between 2010 and 2017. Our results show that over the course of the study period sachet water has become a ubiquitous source of drinking water in Ghana, with relatively wealthy households notably increasing their consumption. In 2017, the majority of sachet water drinking households had access to another improved water source. The current rate and form of urbanisation, inadequate water governance, and an emphasis on cost recovery pose significant challenges for the expansion of the piped water supply network, leading us to conclude that sachet water will likely continue to be a prominent source of drinking water in Ghana for the foreseeable future. The main challenge for policymakers is to ensure that the growing sachet water market enhances rather than undermines Ghana’s efforts towards achieving universal and equitable access to clean drinking water and sanitation."
https://openalex.org/W4281572463,"Dissolved black carbon (DBC) is the condensed aromatic portion of dissolved organic matter produced from the incomplete combustion of biomass and other thermogenic processes. DBC quantification facilitates the examination of the production, accumulation, cycling, transformation, and effects of biologically recalcitrant condensed aromatic carbon in aquatic environments. Due to the heterogeneous nature of DBC molecules, concentrations are difficult to measure directly. Here, the method for DBC quantification consists of oxidizing condensed aromatic carbon to benzenepolycarboxylic acids (BPCAs), which are used as proxies for the assessment of DBC in the original sample. The concentrations of oxidation products (BPCAs) are quantified using high-performance liquid chromatography. DBC concentrations are determined from the concentration of BPCAs using a previously established conversion factor. Details and full descriptions of the preparative and analytical procedures and techniques of the BPCA method are usually omitted for brevity in published method sections and method-specific papers. With this step-by-step protocol, we aim to clarify the steps of DBC analysis, especially for those adopting or conducting the BPCA method for the first time."
https://openalex.org/W4281644433,"Background Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are common among young people in low- and middle-income countries and are associated with negative reproductive and pregnancy outcomes. Most of the studies have assessed HIV among adolescents and young adults, with limited information on occurrence of other STIs in this population. This study aimed to describe the prevalence of and risk factors associated with Herpes Simplex Virus-type 2 (HSV-2), Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG), Syphilis and HIV infection among young adults attending Higher Learning Institutions (HLIs) in Mbeya, Tanzania. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study among students aged 18-24years attending HLIs in Mbeya-Tanzania, randomly selected using a computerized random number. Participants were tested for HSV-2, CT, NG, Syphilis and HIV infection. We used a self-administered questionnaire to collect information on sexual activity and risk factors to the tested STIs. Results We enrolled 504 students from 5 HLIs, with mean age of 21.5 years (SD 1.7). 17% of the students had at least one STI; prevalence was higher among females than males (21.1% versus 14.1%). CT (11%) and HSV-2 (6.1%) were the most common STIs, while NG (1.1%) and HIV (0.7%) infection had the least occurrence. None of the participants was diagnosed with Syphilis. In univariate analysis, predictors for STIs were Sex, inconsistent condom use in the past 4weeks, report of oral sex, sexual orientation (bisexual/homosexual) and having a sexual partner with an age-difference of at least 5years (either older or younger); while in the multivariate analysis, Sex, inconsistent condom use in the past 4weeks and sexual orientation (bisexual/homosexual) remained significant. Conclusion STIs such as Chlamydia and HSV-2 which are commonly asymptomatic are of concern among young adults attending HLIs. The latter is an important group that needs attention and recognition that is pivotal in transmission of STIs considering their risk. Information, Education and Communication (IEC) campaigns targeting young adults, especially those at HLIs, need to focus on exposure-risk minimization. Funding institutions that have invested heavily on HIV prevention campaigns should consider giving similar recognition to other STIs for a streamlined outcome."
https://openalex.org/W4281819486,"Objectives We aimed to compare the effects of different aerobic exercise training (ET) programs on respiratory performance, exercise capacity, and quality of life in fibrosing interstitial lung diseases (f-ILD). Methods A case-control study where 31 patients with f-ILD diagnosis based on chest high-resolution computed tomography were recruited from Main Alexandria University hospital-Egypt. Ten patients were randomly assigned for only lower limbs (LL) endurance training program, and 10 patients for upper limbs, lower limbs, and breathing exercises (ULB) program for consecutive 18 sessions (3 sessions/week for 6 consecutive weeks). Eleven patients who refused to participate in the ET program were considered as control. All patients were subjected for St George’s respiratory questionnaire (SGRQ), 6-minute walk test (6-MWT), forced spirometry and cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) before and after ET programs. Results Fibrosing non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) and collagenic associated-ILD were the commonest pathologies among the ET groups (30% each) with mean age of 44.4±12.25 and 41.90±7.58 years for LL and ULB groups respectively and moderate-to-severe lung restriction. 6-MWT and SGRQ significantly improved after both ET programs ( p &lt;0.001). Peak oxygen consumption (VO 2 ) improved significantly after both LL training (median of 22 (interquartile range (IQR) = 17.0–24.0) vs. 17.5 (IQR = 13.0–23.0) ml/kg/min, p = 0.032) and ULB training (median of 13.5 (IQR = 11.0–21.0) vs. 10.5 (IQR = 5.0–16.0) ml/kg/min, p = 0.018). Further, maximal work load and minute ventilation (VE) significantly improved after both types of ET training ( p &lt;0.05); however, neither ventilation equivalent (VE/VCO 2 ) nor FVC% improved after ET ( p = 0.052 and 0.259 respectively). There were no statistically significant important differences between LL and ULB training programs regarding 6-MWT, SGRQ or CPET parameters (p&gt;0.05). Conclusions ET was associated with improvements in exercise capacity and quality of life in f-ILD patients irrespective of the type of ET program provided."
https://openalex.org/W4281553969,"Since its origin, the emergence of vector-borne infections has taken a toll on incalculable human lives. The use of chemical insecticides is one of the early known methods of vector control and although their use is still a prevalent way to combat insect population sadly the perils of insects related transmission still persists. Most commonly, the existing insecticides face the wrath of getting resisted repeatedly, paying way to develop resilient, efficient, and cost-effective natural insecticides. In this study, computational screening was performed using homology modelling, E-pharmacophore feature mapping, molecular docking, Density Function Theory (DFT) assessment, Molecular mechanics generalized Born surface area (MM-GBSA) based binding free energy calculations and Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation to identify a potential lead phytochemical out of a manually curated library from published literature. The protein target used under this study is insect Butyrylcholine esterase (BChE). Additionally, in vitro insect (Aedes aegypti) BChE inhibition assay was also performed with the top phytochemical identified from in silico assessments. Our research highlights that curcumin leads to inhibition of enzyme BChE of Ae. aegypti. The identified mode of action of curcumin as an insect BChE inhibitor indicates the possibility of its use as an environment friendly and natural futuristic insecticide."
https://openalex.org/W4281554141,"Although coronary artery disease (CAD) and advanced liver fibrosis (AdLF) are commonly associated in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), the prevalence of AdLF and the diagnostic performance of non-invasive fibrosis tests (NITs) in CAD patients remains unknown. We aimed to prospectively screen for AdLF in patients with documented CAD using NITs and Fibroscan. High and intermediate zones of NITs were combined to define AdLF. AdLF was suspected whenever APRI ≥ 0.5, Forns index ≥ 4.2, NAFLD fibrosis score (NFS) ≥ -1.455/0.12 for age &lt;/≥ 65 yrs), Fib4 (≥ 1.30/2.0 for age &lt;/≥ 65 yrs) and eLIFT≥ 8. A presumed AdLF assessed by Fibroscan ≥ 8 kPa was the primary outcome measure. Results were given on the basis of intent-to-diagnose liver stiffness ≥ 8 kPa. Among 189 patients (age 60±7years), 10 (5.3%) had a Fibroscan ≥ 8 kPa, of whom 5 underwent liver biopsy (F3/F4: n = 3; no fibrosis: n = 2). AdLF was suspected in 31% of cases using eLIFT (specificity, Sp 70%), 85% with Forns (Sp 16%), 38% with NFS (Sp 63%), 25% with Fib4 (Sp 74%), and 10% with APRI (Sp 91%). In 149 patients “at-risk” of NAFLD (i.e., elevated ALT or diabetes or hypertriglyceridemia or BMI ≥25 kg/m 2 ), AdLF ranged between 10% (APRI) to 84% (Forns). In this subgroup, the most efficient NITs to predict Fibroscan ≥ 8 kPa were eLIFT (Se 60%, Sp 70%) and NFS (Se 70%, Sp 60%).

For the prospects of improving health in African citizens, understanding malaria and its relation to anaemia in school-aged children, it is crucial to inform targeted interventions for malaria control and accelerate elimination efforts as part of improved school health policy. We conducted a study to determine the risk factors for asymptomatic malaria and their association to anaemia. We explored the prevalence of antimalarial drug resistance as well as the association of asymptomatic malaria infection and anaemia on cognitive and psychomotor functions in school-aged children living in high endemic areas. This study was a comprehensive baseline survey, within the scope of a randomised, controlled trial on the effectiveness and safety of antimalarial drugs in preventing malaria and its related morbidity in schoolchildren. We enrolled 1,587 schoolchildren from 7 primary schools located in Muheza, north-eastern Tanzania. Finger-pricked blood samples were collected for estimation of malaria parasitaemia using a microscope, haemoglobin concentration using a haemoglobinometer, and markers of drug resistance processed from dried blood spots (DBS). Psychomotor and Cognitive functions were assessed using a ‘20 metre Shuttle run’ and a test of everyday attention for children (TEA-Ch), respectively. The prevalence of asymptomatic malaria parasitaemia, anaemia and stunting was 26.4%, 49.8%, and 21.0%, respectively with marked variation across schools. In multivariate models, asymptomatic malaria parasitaemia attributed to 61% of anaemia with a respective population attribution fraction of 16%. Stunting, not sleeping under a bednet and illiterate parent or guardian were other factors attributing to 7%, 9%, and 5% of anaemia in the study population, respectively. Factors such as age group (10–15 years), not sleeping under a bednet, low socioeconomic status, parents’ or guardians’ with a low level of education, children overcrowding in a household, and fewer rooms in a household were significantly attributed to higher malaria infection. There was no significant association between malaria infection or anaemia and performance on tests of cognitive function (sustained attention) or psychomotor function (VO2 max). However, a history of malaria in the past one month was significantly associated with decreased cognitive scores (aOR = -4.1, 95% CI -7.7–0.6, p = 0 . 02 ). Furthermore, stunted children had significantly lower VO2max scores (aOR = -1.9, 95% CI -3.0–0.8, p = 0 . 001 ). Regarding the antimalarial drug resistance markers, the most prevalent Pfmdr1 86-184-1034-1042-1246 haplotypes were the NFSND in 47% (n = 88) and the NYSND in 52% (n = 98). The wild type Pfcrt haplotypes (codons 72–76, CVMNK) were found in 99.1% (n = 219) of the samples. Malaria, stunting and parents’ or guardians’ illiteracy were the key attributable factors for anaemia in schoolchildren. Given malaria infection in schoolchildren is mostly asymptomatic; an addition of interventional programmes such as intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in schoolchildren (IPTsc) would probably act as a potential solution while calling for an improvement in the current tools such as bednet use, school food programme, and community-based (customised) health education with an emphasis on nutrition and malaria control."
https://openalex.org/W4281555911,"The ""Ending Cholera: A Global Roadmap to 2030"" (Roadmap) was launched in October 2017. Following its launch, it became clear that additional evidence is needed to assist countries in controlling cholera and that a prioritized list of research questions is required to focus the limited resources to address the issues most relevant to the implementation of the Roadmap.A comprehensive list of research questions was developed based on inputs from the Working Groups of the Global Taskforce for Cholera Control and other experts. The Child Health and Nutrition Research Initiative methodology was adapted to identify the relevant assessment criteria and assign weights to each criterion. The assessment criteria were applied to each research question by cholera experts to derive a score based on which they were prioritized.The consultation process involved 177 experts and stakeholders representing different constituencies and geographies with research priority scores ranging from 88·8 to 65·7% and resulted in the prioritization of the top 20 research questions across all Roadmap pillars, the top five research questions for each Roadmap pillar, and three discovery research questions. This resulted in 32 non-duplicative research questions that considers both immediate and long-term Roadmap goals.The transparent, inclusive, and rigorous process to develop a Research Agenda is aimed to secure broad buy-in and serve as a guide for funding agencies and researchers to focus their efforts to fill the evidence gaps plaguing cholera-endemic countries."
https://openalex.org/W4281562452,"Due to the chronic nature of knee osteoarthritis (KOA) self-management is considered an essential part of therapy to improve physical function, activity, pain and quality of life (QoL). Web-based rehabilitation may be a potential innovative mode of patient' training to guide management compared to usual care, especially with the current restrictions pandemic imposed. Moreover, in order to alter KOA patients' behavior towards physical activity (PA), it may be more attractive and motivating to combine within their rehabilitation program, outdoor real life local activity that could feasible to be sustained in the future. Aim of the current study is to evaluate the effects of a blended web-based rehabilitation compared with structured PA alone in patients with KOA. This is a randomized multi-center study with two prospective arms. Fifty-six eligible participants with KOA will be recruited from the West Attica region (considered as structurally weak areas). After a comprehensive face-to face training session, participants will follow a 6-week web-based rehabilitation program, consisting of exercise, advice material enhanced outdoor structured PA. The control group will be encouraged to follow the outdoor structured PA alone. Baseline, 6-week and 12-week follow up assessments will be performed. The primary outcome is self-reported physical function as measured by the Knee Injury Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS). Secondary measures include pain, function (Timed Up and Go Test, Sit to Stand test), PA levels (Lower Extremity Activity Scale, Baecke Scale and pedometer), psychological perspective (Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia) and health-related QoL (Short-Form 12). Baseline-adjusted Analysis of Variance will be used to test for group differences in the primary and secondary outcomes. The study will evaluate the blended web-based exercise and advice material, enhanced with outdoor PA in many respects compared to the outdoor PA alone so as to promote self-management care programs for KOA patients.

A total of 197 outpatient visitors responded to the perception survey, and 42 hearing specialists responded to the opinion survey.Overall perception score (18 questions) was 3.04 (95% CI, 3.00-3.09). When 5 categories of perception (knowledge, needs, cost, expectation, and information categories) were analyzed, cost and expectation showed the highest scores of 3.33 (95% CI, 3.21-3.44) and 3.33 (95% CI, 3.27-3.40), respectively, and needs showed the lowest score of 2.23 (95% CI, 1.97-2.49). The ≥ 60-year-old group showed significantly higher perception of PSAPs (P = 0.002), and the individuals with greater severity of subjective hearing loss showed significantly higher perception of PSAPs (P = 0.002). The expected price of PSAPs of the outpatient visitors was 933.9 USD (95% CI, 811.9-1056.0) per ear. Mean expected price of PSAPs of hearing specialists was 291.3 USD (95% CI, 238.2-344.3) per ear.The perception rate of PSAPs was very low, and there was a discrepancy in the expected price of PSAPs between patients/caregivers and hearing experts. Hearing specialists should make effort to improve perception of PSAPs."

We observe that: First, the BDS test shows that nonlinearity is very important when examining the causal relationship between EMV-ID and airline stock returns and its volatility. Second, the nonparametric quantiles-based causality test shows that airline stocks predictability driven by pandemic-based uncertainty is stronger mostly around the lower quantiles, with weak evidences in middle and higher quantiles. Relevant policy implications can be drawn from these findings."
https://openalex.org/W4281638376,"DNA Topoisomerase IIα (TOP2α/170) is an enzyme essential for proliferating cells. For rapidly multiplying malignancies, this has made TOP2α/170 an important target for etoposide and other clinically active anticancer drugs. Efficacy of these agents is often limited by chemoresistance related to alterations in TOP2α/170 expression levels. Our laboratory recently demonstrated reduced levels of TOP2α/170 and overexpression of a C-terminal truncated 90-kDa isoform, TOP2α/90, due to intronic polyadenylation (IPA; within intron 19) in an acquired etoposide-resistant K562 clonal cell line, K/VP.5. We previously reported that this isoform heterodimerized with TOP2α/170 and was a determinant of acquired resistance to etoposide. Optimization of the weak TOP2α exon 19/intron 19 5′ splice site in drug-resistant K/VP.5 cells by gene-editing restored TOP2α/170 levels, diminished TOP2α/90 expression, and circumvented drug resistance. Conversely, in the present study, silencing of the exon 19/intron 19 5′ splice site in parental K562 cells by CRISPR/Cas9 with homology-directed repair (HDR), and thereby forcing intron 19 retention, was used to induce resistance by disrupting normal RNA processing (i.e., gene knockout), and to further evaluate the role of TOP2α/170 and TOP2α/90 isoforms as resistance determinants. Gene-edited clones were identified by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and verified by Sanger sequencing. TOP2α/170 mRNA/protein expression levels were attenuated in the TOP2α gene-edited clones which resulted in resistance to etoposide as assessed by reduced etoposide-induced DNA damage (γH2AX, Comet assays) and growth inhibition. RNA-seq and qPCR studies suggested that intron 19 retention leads to decreased TOP2α/170 expression by degradation of the TOP2α edited mRNA transcripts. Forced expression of TOP2α/90 in the gene-edited K562 cells further decreased etoposide-induced DNA damage in support of a dominant negative role for this truncated isoform. Together results support the important role of both TOP2α/170 and TOP2α/90 as determinants of sensitivity/resistance to TOP2α-targeting agents."
https://openalex.org/W4281643065,"Background Cutaneous leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by Leishmania spp. and transmitted by female sandflies. Terrorism and counter-insurgency military operations in Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) lead to a large-scale migration of internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and thus, new outbreaks of several infectious diseases such as cutaneous leishmaniasis occurred. This study intended to find the prevalence of cutaneous leishmaniasis in people with cutaneous lesions suspected of having cutaneous leishmaniasis in four remote districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and to assess the participant’s knowledge, attitude, and practices about the infection and its control. Methods A cross-sectional study was carried out in four remote districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa including Karak, Lakki Marwat, Tank, and Dera Ismail Khan (D. I. Khan) and a total of 1,674 participants were recruited using a convenience sampling technique. Results The prevalence of cutaneous leishmaniasis among the participants with cutaneous lesions was 50.4% and the infection was comparatively more prevalent in district Karak. Among participants, 56.8% were male and mostly, 53.8% were under the age of 16 years with 52.8% living in kutcha houses and were from rural areas. Multiple skin lesions were more common, and the face was frequently affected body part. The ratio of participants with lesions older than a month was higher and the majority confronted infections with blood protozoan parasites for the first time. Most participants were unaware of the signs/symptoms of the disease, basic knowledge of the vectors, anthroponotic spread, preventive measures, secondary infections, and reservoir hosts. The use of wood/animal dung as fuel, closeness with reservoir animals, and no use of insect repellents were some of the notable risk factors. Conclusion Cutaneous leishmaniasis is highly prevalent in the study area and a very low level of awareness was reported among the participants. This study necessitates the planning and execution of regulations and preventive programs, public health education, awareness campaigns, and disease management practices to overcome future incidence of cutaneous leishmaniasis."
https://openalex.org/W4281771313,"Vasomotor symptoms (VMS) are common around menopause. Menopausal hormone therapy is the most effective treatment for VMS. Physical exercise has been proposed as an alternative treatment since physically active women have previously been found to experience fewer VMS than inactive women. In our randomised controlled trial on resistance training to treat VMS, sympoms were reduced by 50% in the intervention group compared with the control group.To propose a mechanism to explain how resistance training reduced VMS and to assess if luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) were affected in accordance with the proposed mechanism.A substudy of a randomized controlled trial on 65 postmenopausal women with VMS and low physical activity who were randomised to 15 weeks of resistance training three times per week (n = 33) or to a control group (n = 32). To be regarded compliant to the intervention we predecided a mean of two training sessions per week. The daily number of VMS were registered before and during the 15 weeks. Blood samples were drawn for analysis of LH and FSH at baseline and after 15 weeks.LH decreased significantly in the compliant intervention group compared with the control group (-4.0±10.6 versus 2.9±9.0, p = 0.028 with Mann-Whitney U test). FSH also decreased in the compliant intervention group compared with the control group, however not enough to reach statistical significance (-3.5±16.3 versus 3.2±18.2, p = 0.063 with Mann-Whitney U test). As previously published the number of hot flushes decreased significantly more in the intervention group than in the control group but there was no association between change in LH or FSH and in number of VMS.We propose that endogenous opiods such as β-endorphin or dynorphin produced during resistance training decreased VMS by stimulating KNDγ-neurons to release neurokinin B to the hypothalamic thermoregulatory centre. Through effects on KNDγ-neurons, β-endorphin could also inhibit GnRH and thereby decrease the production of LH and FSH. The significanty decreased LH in the compliant intervention group compared with the control group was in accordance with the proposed mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W4282011037,"Fast Proxy Mobile IPv6 (FPMIPv6) is an extension of the PMIPv6 mobility management deployed as part of the next-generation internet protocol. It allows location-independent routing of IP datagrams, based on local mobility to IPv6 hosts without involvement of stations in the IP address signaling. A mobile node keeps its IP address constant as it moves from link to link, which avoids signaling overhead and latency associated with changing IP address. Even though local mobility requirements hold, it entails security threats such as Mobile Node, Mobile Access Gateway, as well as Local Mobility Anchor impersonation that go beyond those already exist in IPv6. As mobile station keeps moving across different serving networks, its IP remains constant during handover, and location privacy may not also be preserved. Moreover, homogeneous network dependence of PMIPv6 is one of the gaps, which FPMIPv6 could not mitigate. FPMIPv6 does not support heterogeneous network handover, for which numerous researchers have proposed Media Independent Handover (MIH) enabled FPMIPv6 schemes to allow fast handover among heterogeneous networks, but in the absence of security solutions. As a comprehensive solution, we propose a new handover authentication scheme and a key agreement protocol for the ‘MIH-enabled Network Only FPMIPv6’ model. As one of the basic requirements, mobility management should minimize signaling overhead, handover delay and power consumption of the mobile node. The proposed scheme improves wireless link overhead (mobile node overhead) by 6-86% as cell radius, wireless failure probability and number of hop vary. The security of the proposed scheme has also been analyzed under BAN logic and Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) tool and its performance has numerically been evaluated through a pre-determined performance matrix and found to be effective and preferably applicable compared with other schemes."

https://openalex.org/W4281554132,"The existing anomaly detection methods can be divided into two popular models based on reconstruction or future frame prediction. Due to the strong learning capacity, reconstruction approach can hardly generate significant reconstruction errors for anomalies, whereas future frame prediction approach is sensitive to noise in complicated scenarios. Therefore, a solution has been proposed by balancing the merits and demerits of the two models. However, most methods relied on single-scale information to capture spatial features and lacked temporal continuity between the video frames, affecting anomaly detection accuracy. Thus, we propose a novel method to improve anomaly detection performance. Because of the objects of various scales in each video, we select different receptive fields to extract comprehensive spatial features by the hybrid dilated convolution (HDC) module. Meanwhile, the deeper bidirectional convolutional long short-term memory (DB-ConvLSTM) module can remember the temporal information between the consecutive frames. Experiments prove that our method can detect abnormalities in various video scenes more accurately than the state-of-the-art methods in the anomaly-detection task."
https://openalex.org/W4281558995,"In this study, we propose a general method for tackling the Pickup and Drop-off Problem (PDP) using Hybrid Pointer Networks (HPNs) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). Our aim is to reduce the overall tour length traveled by an agent while remaining within the truck's capacity restrictions and adhering to the node-to-node relationship. In such instances, the agent does not allow any drop-off points to be serviced if the truck is empty; conversely, if the vehicle is full, the agent does not allow any products to be picked up from pickup points. In our approach, this challenge is solved using machine learning-based models. Using HPNs as our primary model allows us to gain insight and tackle more complicated node interactions, which simplified our objective to obtaining state-of-art outcomes. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed neural network, as we achieve the state-of-art results for this problem as compared with the existing models. We deal with two types of demand patterns in a single type commodity problem. In the first pattern, all demands are assumed to sum up to zero (i.e., we have an equal number of backup and drop-off items). In the second pattern, we have an unequal number of backup and drop-off items, which is close to practical application, such as bike sharing system rebalancing. Our data, models, and code are publicly available at Solving Pickup and Dropoff Problem Using Hybrid Pointer Networks with Deep Reinforcement Learning."
https://openalex.org/W4281561537,"2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) is one of the most harmful chemicals showing resistance to biodegradation. The majority of TCDD effects is mediated by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) pathway. TCDD binding to AhR results in the activation of cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP1B1) involved in dioxin biodegradation. The goal of the study was to explore the potential role of CYP1A2 in the metabolism of TCDD. We investigated a molecular structure of CYP1A2 and the binding selectivity and affinity between the pig CYP1A2 and: 1/ DiCDD or TCDD (dioxins differing in toxicity and biodegradability) or 2/ their selected metabolites. pCYP1A2 demonstrated higher affinity towards DiCDD and TCDD than other pCYP1 enzymes. All dioxin-pCYP1A2 complexes were found to be stabilized by hydrophobic interactions. The calculated distances between the heme oxygen and the dioxin carbon nearest to the oxygen, reflecting the hydroxylating potential of CYP1A2, were higher than in other pCYP1 enzymes. The distances between the heme iron and the nearest dioxin carbon exceeded 5 Å, a distance sufficient to allow the metabolites to leave the active site. However, the molecular dynamics simulations revealed that two access channels of CYP1A2 were closed upon binding the majority of the examined dioxins. Moreover, the binding of dioxin metabolites did not promote opening of channel S-an exit for hydroxylated products. It appears that the undesired changes in the behavior of access channels prevail over the hydroxylating potential of CYP1A2 towards TCDD and the favorable distances, ultimately trapping the metabolites at the enzyme's active site."
https://openalex.org/W4281561728,"Brazilian legal system prescribes means of ensuring the prompt processing of court cases, such as the principle of reasonable process duration, the principle of celerity, procedural economy, and due legal process, with a view to optimizing procedural progress. In this context, one of the great challenges of the Brazilian judiciary is to predict the duration of legal cases based on information such as the judge, lawyers, parties involved, subject, monetary values of the case, starting date of the case, etc. Recently, there has been great interest in estimating the duration of various types of events using artificial intelligence algorithms to predict future behaviors based on time series. Thus, this study presents a proof-of-concept for creating and demonstrating a mechanism for predicting the amount of time, after the case is argued in court (time when a case is made available for the magistrate to make the decision), for the magistrate to issue a ruling. Cases from a Regional Labor Court were used as the database, with preparation data in two ways (original and discretization), to test seven machine learning techniques (i) Multilayer Perceptron (MLP); (ii) Gradient Boosting; (iii) Adaboost; (iv) Regressive Stacking; (v) Stacking Regressor with MLP; (vi) Regressive Stacking with Gradient Boosting; and (vii) Support Vector Regression (SVR), and determine which gives the best results. After executing the runs, it was identified that the adaboost technique excelled in the task of estimating the duration for issuing a ruling, as it had the best performance among the tested techniques. Thus, this study shows that it is possible to use machine learning techniques to perform this type of prediction, for the test data set, with an R2 of 0.819 and when transformed into levels, an accuracy of 84%."

Peanut oral immunotherapy (POIT) results in desensitization in most peanut allergic individuals (responders), but not in others due to allergic reactions (non-responders). Delineation of early immunologic changes contributing to desensitization would help clarify the POIT mechanism of action. We analyzed dendritic cells in 15 pediatric subjects (5–12 years) undergoing a phase 1 single-center POIT study. We examined dendritic cells at baseline, 6-, 12-, 18- and 24-weeks after initiation of POIT and responders of therapy were compared to non-responders and healthy controls. The distribution frequency of myeloid DCs (mDCs) and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) from peripheral blood samples were measured in vitro . A general linear mixed model was used, and included fixed effects for cohort (responder, non-responder, or healthy control), time (0-, 6-, 12-, 18-, and 24-weeks), and the cohort-time interaction term. P-values were adjusted for multiple hypothesis testing using Tukey’s method. We observed that POIT responders had reduced TNFa producing myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs) compared to non-responders. Additionally, non-responders had increased OX40L expressing mDCs at 18-weeks compared to responders. In conclusion, our findings suggest that a reduced pro-inflammatory phenotype in DCs could potentially serve as a predictor of early outcome and success of POIT desensitization."
https://openalex.org/W4281568183,"Modern living and working environments are more and more interspersed with the concurrent execution of locomotion and sensory processing, most often in the visual domain. Many job profiles involve the presentation of visual information while walking, for example in warehouse logistics work, where a worker has to manage walking to the correct aisle to pick up a package while being presented with visual information over data-glasses concerning the next order. Similar use-cases can be found in manufacturing jobs, for example in car montage assembly lines where next steps are presented via augmented reality headsets while walking at a slow pace. Considering the overall scarcity of cognitive resources available to be deployed to either the cognitive or motor processes, task performance decrements were found when increasing load in either domain. Interestingly, the walking motion also had beneficial effects on peripheral contrast detection and the inhibition of visual stream information. Taking these findings into account, we conducted a study that comprised the detection of single visual targets (Landolt Cs) within a broad range of the visual field (-40° to +40° visual angle) while either standing, walking, or walking with concurrent perturbations. We used questionnaire (NASA-TLX), behavioral (response times and accuracy), and neurophysiological data (ERPs and ERSPs) to quantify the effects of cognitive-motor interference. The study was conducted in a Gait Real-time Analysis Interactive Laboratory (GRAIL), using a 180° projection screen and a swayable and tiltable dual-belt treadmill. Questionnaire and behavioral measures showed common patterns. We found increasing subjective physical workload and behavioral decrements with increasing stimulus eccentricity and motor complexity. Electrophysiological results also indicated decrements in stimulus processing with higher stimulus eccentricity and movement complexity (P3, Theta), but highlighted a beneficial role when walking without perturbations and processing more peripheral stimuli regarding earlier sensory components (N1pc/N2pc, N2). These findings suggest that walking without impediments can enhance the visual processing of peripheral information and therefore help with perceiving non-foveal sensory content. Also, our results could help with re-evaluating previous findings in the context of cognitive-motor interference, as increased motor complexity might not always impede cognitive processing and performance."

A TP- B inding C assette (ABC) transporters have been demonstrated to be involved in the general stress response. In previous studies, in-frame deletion mutants of the ABC transporter genes, LMOf2365_1875 and LMOf2365_1877 , were constructed and analyzed; however, additional work is needed to investigate the virulence potential of these deletion mutants. In this study, two in vitro methods and one in vivo model were used to investigate the virulence potential of in-frame deletion mutants of ABC transporter genes. First, the invasion efficiency in host cells was measured using the HT-29 human cell line. Second, cell-to-cell spread activity was measured using a plaque forming assay. Lastly, virulence potential of the mutants was tested in the Galleria mellonella wax moth model. Our results demonstrated that the deletion mutant, ⊿ LMOf2365_1875 , displayed decreased invasion and cell-to-cell spread efficiency in comparison to the wild-type, LMOf2365 , indicating that LMOf2365_1875 may be required for virulence. Furthermore, the reduced virulence of these mutants was confirmed using the Galleria mellonella wax moth model. In addition, the expression levels of 15 virulence and stress-related genes were analyzed by RT-PCR assays using stationary phase cells. Our results showed that virulence-related gene expression levels from the deletion mutants were elevated (15/15 genes from ⊿ LMOf2365_1877 and 7/15 genes from ⊿ LMOf2365_1875 ) compared to the wild type LMOf2365 , suggesting that ABC transporters may negatively regulate virulence gene expression under specific conditions. The expression level of the stress-related gene, clpE , also was increased in both deletion mutants, indicating the involvement of ABC transporters in the stress response. Taken together, our findings suggest that ABC transporters may be used as potential targets to develop new therapeutic strategies to control L . monocytogenes ."

This study analyzed if these models were also applicable to patients with COVID-19 in the second wave. Methods This retrospective cohort study included 98 critical care patients with COVID-19, who had been treated at the University Medical Center Regensburg, Germany, between October 2020 and February 2021. Data collected for each patient included vital signs, dosage of catecholamines, analgosedation, anticoagulation, and antithrombotic medication, diagnostic blood tests, treatment with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), intensive care scores, ventilator therapy, and pulmonary gas exchange. Using these data, expected mortality was calculated by means of the originally developed mathematical models, thereby testing the models for their applicability to patients in the second wave. Results Mortality in the second-wave cohort did not significantly differ from that in the first-wave cohort (41.8% vs. 32.2%, p = 0.151). As in our previous study, individual parameters such as pH of blood or mean arterial pressure (MAP) differed significantly between survivors and non-survivors. In contrast to our previous study, however, survivors and non-survivors in this study showed significant or even highly significant differences in pulmonary gas exchange and ventilator therapy (e.g. mean and minimum values for oxygen saturation and partial pressure of oxygen, mean values for the fraction of inspired oxygen, positive expiratory pressure, tidal volume, and oxygenation ratio). ECMO therapy was more frequently administered than in the first-wave cohort. Calculations of expected mortality by means of the originally developed univariable and multivariable models showed that the use of simple cut-off values for pH, MAP, troponin, or combinations of these parameters resulted in correctly estimated outcome in approximately 75% of patients without ECMO therapy."

We found out that photoautotrophic picoplankton constitutes an important part of the phytoplankton community in Lake Võrtsjärv and its contribution can be highly variable (from ~9.3% to ~39%) in different years. The eukaryotic photoautotrophic picoplankton was dominated by diatoms followed by chrysophytes and other minor groups. Picoeukaryotes were prevailing in low-light conditions and low temperatures as their predominance in the picoplankton community was tightly linked to the presence or absence of ice cover. Ice cover strongly suppressed the growth of picocyanobacteria. Total phosphorus, turbidity and metazooplankton abundance had a clear relationship with photoautotrophic picoplankton chlorophyll a ."
https://openalex.org/W4281551539,"Low-back pain is one of the most common health conditions worldwide. It is defined as pain below the costal margin and above the inferior gluteal folds. Current guidelines recommend management of chronic health (e.g., low back pain) conditions in older people at primary health care settings using active strategies (e.g., exercise). In non-specific low back pain, high quality evidence supports active strategies for general population. However, the management of non-specific low back pain in the older people has been overlooked and evidence is limited to a small number of low powered randomized controlled trials with high risk of bias.This is a prospectively registered, open, two-arm randomised controlled trial comparing the group-based exercise and waiting list in pain intensity (11-item Pain Numerical Rating Scale) and disability (Roland Morris questionnaire) of older people (i.e., 60 years old or over) with chronic non-specific low back pain. One hundred and twenty patients will be recruited from Diamantina, Brazil. Follow-ups will be conducted in post-treatment (8 week) and 6- and 12-months post-randomisation.Our hypothesis is that group-based exercise will be better than waiting list in reducing pain intensity and disability in older people with chronic non-specific low back pain.The practice of individualized exercise has been studied for the management of chronic non-specific low back pain in older people. However, the group exercise, even showing high quality evidence for the improvement of several important outcomes in this population, has been ignored until now. Thus, the results of this study have the potential to indicate a viable and accessible strategy for managing chronic non-specific low back pain in the older people.The study was prospectively registered at www.ensaiosclinicos.gov.br (RBR-9j5pqs).

https://openalex.org/W4281554712,"Obesity is a significant contributor to the development of chronic diseases, some of which can be prevented or reversed by weight loss. However, dietary weight loss programs have shortcomings in the success rate, magnitude, or sustainability of weight loss. The Individualized Diet Improvement Program's (iDip) objective was to test the feasibility of a novel approach that helps individuals self-select a sustainable diet for weight loss and maintenance instead of providing weight loss products or rigid diet instructions to follow. The iDip study consisted of 22 dietary improvement sessions over 12 months with six months of follow-up. Daily weights were collected, and a chart summarizing progress was provided weekly. Six 24-hour dietary records were collected, and dietary feedback was provided in the form of a protein-fiber plot, in which protein/energy and fiber/energy of foods were plotted two-dimensionally together with a target box specific to weight loss or maintenance. An exit survey was conducted at 12 months. Twelve (nine female, 46.3±3.1 years (mean±SE)) of the initial 14 participants (BMI>28 kg/m2) completed all sessions. Mean percent weight loss (n = 12) at six and 12 months was -4.9%±1.1 (p = 0.001) and -5.4%±1.7 (p = 0.007), respectively. Weight loss varied among individuals at 12 months; top and bottom halves (n = 6 each) achieved -9.7%±1.7 (p = 0.0008) and -1.0%±1.4 weight loss, respectively. The 24-hour records showed a significant increase in protein density from baseline to final (4.1g/100kcal±0.3 vs. 5.7g/100kcal±0.5; p = 0.008). Although mean fiber density showed no significant change from the first month (1.3g/100kcal±0.1), the top half had significantly higher fiber/energy intake than the bottom half group. The survey suggested that all participants valued the program and its self-guided diet approach. In conclusion, half of the participants successfully lost >5% and maintained the lost weight for 12 months without strict diet instructions, showing the feasibility of the informed decision-making approach."
https://openalex.org/W4281556545,"The concern with human health has increased the interest in producing foods enriched with polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), directly or naturally, by inclusion in the animals' diet. The positive effects such as antithrombotic, anti-inflammatory, and hypolipidemic have been observed in pigs and rats, used as human models for study. The present study evaluated the effect of cow's milk with different lipid profiles on performance, serum fatty acid profile, biochemical analysis, and a complete blood count of gilts used as a human model. At 34 days, thirty gilts were equally distributed in three treatments. Experimental treatments were milk from cows without the oil supplementation (C), milk from cows fed an enriched diet with linseed oil (n-3), and milk from cows fed an enriched diet with soybean oil (n-6). Milk supplementation was performed until 190 days old, provided once in the morning. The n-3 and n-6 milk reduced the concentration of myristic acid in the blood and increased the leukocytes. Milk enriched with n-3 compared to n-6 reduced the stearic acid. In conclusion, milk with a better PUFA profile can reduce saturated fatty acids in the blood and alter the concentration of cells in the defense system."
https://openalex.org/W4281556710,"Tumors display rich cellular heterogeneity and typically consist of multiple co-existing clones with distinct genotypic and phenotypic characteristics. The acquisition of resistance to chemotherapy has been shown to contribute to the development of aggressive cancer traits, such as increased migration, invasion and stemness. It has been hypothesized that collective cellular behavior and cooperation of cancer cell populations may directly contribute to disease progression and lack of response to treatment. Here we show that the spontaneous emergence of chemoresistance in a cancer cell population exposed to the selective pressure of a chemotherapeutic agent can result in the emergence of collective cell behavior, including cell-sorting, chemoprotection and collective migration. We derived several gemcitabine resistant subclones from the human pancreatic cancer cell line BxPC3 and determined that the observed chemoresistance was driven of a focal amplification of the chr11p15.4 genomic region, resulting in over-expression of the ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) subunit RRM1. Interestingly, these subclones display a rich cell-sorting behavior when cultured as mixed tumor spheroids. Furthermore, we show that chemoresistant cells are able to exert a chemoprotective effect on non-resistant cells in spheroid co-culture, whereas no protective effect is seen in conventional 2D culture. We also demonstrate that the co-culture of resistant and non-resistant cells leads to collective migration where resistant cells enable migration of otherwise non-migratory cells."
https://openalex.org/W4281566219,"Purpose To evaluate the correlations between relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) magnitude, assessed using the clinical plus scale and neutral density filters, and visual field parameters in patients with unilateral or asymmetrical bilateral optic neuropathy or retinopathy. Methods Fifty-two patients with RAPD, graded by the swinging flashlight test and neutral density filters, were analyzed in this cross-sectional trial. The RAPD clinical plus scale was divided into grade 1+, initial weak constriction; grade 2+, initial stall then dilatation; grade 3+, immediate dilatation; and grade 4+, fixed amaurotic pupil. Patients with positive RAPD underwent a visual field examination with Humphrey automated perimetry that included visual field index (VFI), mean deviation (MD), and pattern standard deviation (PSD). Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients and linear regression were used to analyze the association between RAPD grades and visual field parameters. Results RAPD clinical plus grades were correlated with interocular VFI (r = 0.55, P &lt; 0.001) and MD (r = 0.48, P = 0.004) differences. Average interocular VFI differences were estimated as follows: 16.75 × RAPD plus grade– 7.53. RAPD, graded by neutral density filters, was correlated with VFI (r = 0.59, P &lt; 0.001), MD (r = 0.54, P &lt; 0.001), and PSD (r = 0.34, P = 0.01). Conclusions The RAPD plus scale and neutral density filter grading systems were associated with quantitative visual field defect parameters, with VFI showing the strongest association. RAPD clinical grading could substitute more sophisticated central visual field evaluation methods as a low-cost, low-tech, and widely available approach."
https://openalex.org/W4281570291,"Introduction Invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) is still an important cause of mortality in children and survivors can have significant long-term disabling sequelae. There are few prospective studies looking at the long term neuropsychological and developmental consequences of IMD in surviving children, and the rate of sequelae may be underestimated. The SEINE study aims to have a more reliable estimate of the real rate of sequelae by assessing the long-term physical, neuropsychological, learning disorders and sensory sequelae of IMD in children and adolescents and by assessing the post-traumatic stress in parents. Methods and analysis The SEINE study is a multicentre, prospective, non-randomized, interventional study based on the French bacterial meningitis surveillance network. The study will include 100 children aged from birth to 15 years old, hospitalized in a Paris area paediatric ward for a meningococcal meningitis or a purpura fulminans between 2010 and 2019. The first outcome will assess long-term sequelae (physical, neurological, or sensory) measured by a general clinical and neurological examination, a neurocognitive assessment, learning development, a pure tone audiometry and an ophthalmic examination. The second outcome will assess the long-term post-traumatic stress in parents measured by the Impact of Event Scare Revised questionnaire. Perspectives By providing a better estimation of the rate of sequelae in children and offering an adapted follow-up of these children, we believe that the SEINE study will help to improve the management of patients surviving IMD.

https://openalex.org/W4281571152,"The suppression of the first wave of COVID-19 in Japan is assumedly attributed to people’s increased risk perception after acquiring information from the government and media reports. In this study, going out in public amidst the spread of COVID-19 infections was investigated by examining new polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive cases of COVID-19 and its relationship to four indicators of people going out in public (the people flow, the index of web searches for going outside, the number of times people browse restaurants, and the number of hotel guests, from the Regional Economic and Social Analysis System (V-RESAS). Two waves of COVID-19 infections were examined using cross-correlation analysis. In the first wave, all four indicators of going out changed to be opposite the change in new PCR positive cases, showing a lag period of –1 to +6 weeks. In the second wave, the same relationship was only observed for the index of web searches for going outside, and two indicators showed the positive lag period of +6 to +12 weeks after the change in new PCR positive cases. Moreover, each indicator in the second wave changed differently compared to the first wave. The complexity of people’s behaviors around going out increased in the second wave, when policies and campaigns were implemented and people’s attitudes were thought to have changed. In conclusion, the results suggest that policies may have influenced people’s mobility, rather than the number of new PCR positive cases."
https://openalex.org/W4281571403,"Despite their broad distribution across the North Pacific Ocean, the only known spawning grounds for Pacific Bluefin Tuna ( Thunnus orientalis ) are around coastal Japan and the East China Sea. However, an increase in the prevalence of large bluefin tuna up to 10 years old in the California Current System during exceptionally warm ocean conditions has led to speculation that they may be spawning in this region. To investigate this possibility, we collected samples from 36 females (estimated 3–8 years old) between 2015 and 2019. Histological analyses revealed no signs of imminent, active, or recent spawning. Further examination of historical ichthyoplankton collections showed no records of larval bluefin tuna, but confirmed the presence of the larvae of other tuna species in waters &gt; 24°C. Fishery-dependent records showed that bluefin tuna are rarely recorded in purse seine catches where surface temperatures exceed 23°C. Our study, therefore, provided no evidence of bluefin tuna reproduction in the CCS. However, more comprehensive sampling, in particular off southern Baja California, may be required to confirm the absence of spawning."
https://openalex.org/W4281571415,"Heart failure is a multi-system disease, with non-cardiac systems playing a key role in disease pathogenesis.Investigate whether longitudinal multi-system trajectories incrementally predict heart failure risk compared to single-occasion traits.We evaluated 3,412 participants from the Framingham Heart Study Offspring cohort, free of heart failure, who attended examination cycle 5 and at least one examination between 1995-2008 (mean age 67 years, 54% women). We related trajectories for the following organ systems and metabolic functions to heart failure risk using Cox regression: kidney (estimated glomerular filtration rate), lung (forced vital capacity and the ratio of forced expiratory volume in one second/forced vital capacity), neuromotor (gait time), muscular (grip strength), cardiac (left ventricular mass index and heart rate), vascular function (pulse pressure), cholesterol (ratio of total/high-density lipoprotein), adiposity (body mass index), inflammation (C-reactive protein) and glucose homeostasis (hemoglobin A1c). Using traits selected via forward selection, we derived a trajectory risk score and related it to heart failure risk.We observed 276 heart failure events during a median follow up of 10 years. Participants with the 'worst' multi-system trajectory profile had the highest heart failure risk. A one-unit increase in the trajectory risk score was associated with a 2.72-fold increase in heart failure risk (95% CI 2.21-3.34; p<0.001). The mean c-statistics for models including the trajectory risk score and single-occasion traits were 0.87 (95% CI 0.83-0.91) and 0.83 (95% CI 0.80-0.86), respectively.Incorporating multi-system trajectories reflective of the aging process may add incremental information to heart failure risk assessment when compared to using single-occasion traits."
https://openalex.org/W4281666802,"The study of population spatialization has provided important basic data for urban planning, development, environment and other issues. With the development of urbanization, urban residential buildings are getting higher and higher, and the difference between urban and rural population density is getting larger and larger. At present, most population spatial studies adopt the grid scale, and the population in buildings is evenly divided into various grids, which will lead to the neglect of the population distribution in vertical space, and the authenticity is not strong. In order to improve the accuracy of the population distribution, this paper studied the spatial distribution of population at the building scale, combined the digital surface model (DSM) and the digital elevation model (DEM) to calculate the floor of buildings, and proposed a new index based on the total floor area of residential buildings, called residential population index (RPI). RPI is directly related to the number of people a building can accommodate, so it can effectively estimate the population of both urban and rural areas even if the structure of urban and rural buildings is very different. In addition, this paper combined remote sensing monitoring data with geographic big data and adopted principal component regression (PCR) method to construct RPI prediction model to obtain building-scale population distribution data of Qingdao in 2018, providing ideas for population spatialization research. Through field sampling survey and overall assessment, the results were basically consistent with the actual residential situation. The average error with field survey samples is 14.5%. The R2 is 0.643 and the urbanization rate is 69.7%, which are all higher than WorldPop data set. Therefore, this method can reflect the specific distribution of urban resident population, enhance the heterogeneity and complexity of population distribution, and the estimated results have important reference significance for urban management, urban resource allocation, environmental protection and other fields."
https://openalex.org/W4281867474,"The kallikrein–kinin system has been implicated in body weight and glucose homeostasis. Their major effectors act by binding to the kinin B2 and B1 receptors. It was assessed the role of the kinin B1 receptor in weight and glucose homeostasis in B1 receptor knockout mice (B1RKO) subjected to a cafeteria diet (CAF). Wild-type (WT) and B1RKO male mice (C57BL/6 background; 8 weeks old) were fed a standard diet (SD) or CAF for 14 weeks, ad libitum , and four groups were formed: WT-SD; B1RKO-SD; WT-CAF; B1RKO-CAF. Body weight and food intake were assessed weekly. It was performed glucose tolerance (GTT) and insulin tolerance tests (ITT), and HOMA-IR, HOMA-β and HOMA-β* 1/HOMA-IR were calculated. Islets from WT and B1RKO were isolated in order to measure the insulin secretion. Western blot was used to assess the hepatic AKT phosphorylation and qPCR to assess gene expression. CAF induced a higher body mass gain in B1RKO compared to WT mice. CAF diet increased epididymal fat depot mass, hepatic fat infiltration and hepatic AKT phosphorylation in both genotypes. However, B1RKO mice presented lower glycemic response during GTT when fed with CAF, and a lower glucose decrease in the ITT. This higher resistance was overcomed with higher insulin secretion when stimulated by high glucose, resulting in higher glucose uptake in the GTT when submitted to CAF, despite lower insulin sensitivity. Islets from B1RKO delivered 4 times more insulin in 3-month-old mice than islets from WT. The higher insulin disposition index and high insulin delivery of B1RKO can explain the decreased glucose excursion during GTT. In conclusion, CAF increased the β-cell function in B1RKO mice, compensated by the diet-induced insulin resistance and resulting in a healthier glycemic response despite the higher weight gain."
https://openalex.org/W4281992625,"Background There is encouraging evidence that interdisciplinary teams of Health and Social Care Professionals (HSCPs) can enhance patient care in the Emergency Department (ED), especially for older adults with complex needs. However, no formal process evaluations of implementations of ED-based HSCP interventions are available. The study aimed to evaluate the development and delivery of a HSCP team intervention for older adults in the ED of a large Irish teaching hospital. Methods Using the Medical Research Council (MRC) Framework for process evaluations, we investigated implementation and delivery, mechanisms of impact, and contextual influences on implementation by analysing the HSCP team’s activity notes and participant recruitment logs, and by carrying out six interviews and four focus groups with 26 participants (HSCP team members, ED doctors and nurses, hospital staff). Qualitative insights were analysed thematically. Results The implementation process had three phases (pre-implementation, piloting, and delivery), with the first two described as pivotal to optimise care procedures and build positive stakeholders’ involvement. The team’s motivation and proactive communication were key to promote acceptability and integration in the ED (Theme 1); also, their specialised skills and interdisciplinary approach enhanced patient and staff’s ED experience (Theme 2). The investment and collaboration of multiple stakeholders were described as essential contextual enablers of implementation (Theme 4). Delivering the intervention within a randomised controlled trial fostered credibility but caused frustration among patients and staff (Theme 3). Discussion This process evaluation is the first to provide in-depth and practical insights on the complexities of developing and delivering an ED-based HSCP team intervention for older adults. Our findings highlight the importance of establishing a team of HSCPs with a strong interdisciplinary ethos to ensure buy-in and integration in the ED processes. Also, actively involving relevant stakeholders is key to facilitate implementation. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03739515 ; registered on 12 th November 2018."
