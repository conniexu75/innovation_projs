https://openalex.org/W2024595059,"Mutations in the mitochondrial fusion gene Mfn2 cause the human neurodegenerative disease Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 2A. However, the cellular basis underlying this relationship is poorly understood. By removing Mfn2 from the cerebellum, we established a model for neurodegeneration caused by loss of mitochondrial fusion. During development and after maturity, Purkinje cells require Mfn2 but not Mfn1 for dendritic outgrowth, spine formation, and cell survival. In vivo, cell culture, and electron microscopy studies indicate that mutant Purkinje cells have aberrant mitochondrial distribution, ultrastructure, and electron transport chain activity. In fibroblasts lacking mitochondrial fusion, the majority of mitochondria lack mitochondrial DNA nucleoids. This deficiency provides a molecular mechanism for the dependence of respiratory activity on mitochondrial fusion. Our results show that exchange of mitochondrial contents is important for mitochondrial function as well as organelle distribution in neurons and have important implications for understanding the mechanisms of neurodegeneration due to perturbations in mitochondrial fusion."
https://openalex.org/W1584463243,"The cytokine transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) is an important negative regulator of adaptive immunity. TGF-beta is secreted by cells as an inactive precursor that must be activated to exert biological effects, but the mechanisms that regulate TGF-beta activation and function in the immune system are poorly understood. Here we show that conditional loss of the TGF-beta-activating integrin alpha(v)beta8 on leukocytes causes severe inflammatory bowel disease and age-related autoimmunity in mice. This autoimmune phenotype is largely due to lack of alpha(v)beta8 on dendritic cells, as mice lacking alpha(v)beta8 principally on dendritic cells develop identical immunological abnormalities as mice lacking alpha(v)beta8 on all leukocytes, whereas mice lacking alpha(v)beta8 on T cells alone are phenotypically normal. We further show that dendritic cells lacking alpha(v)beta8 fail to induce regulatory T cells (T(R) cells) in vitro, an effect that depends on TGF-beta activity. Furthermore, mice lacking alpha(v)beta8 on dendritic cells have reduced proportions of T(R) cells in colonic tissue. These results suggest that alpha(v)beta8-mediated TGF-beta activation by dendritic cells is essential for preventing immune dysfunction that results in inflammatory bowel disease and autoimmunity, effects that are due, at least in part, to the ability of alpha(v)beta8 on dendritic cells to induce and/or maintain tissue T(R) cells."
https://openalex.org/W2048635483,"Action potentials are binary signals that transmit information via their rate and temporal pattern. In this context, the axon is thought of as a transmission line, devoid of a role in neuronal computation. Here, we show a highly localized role of axonal Kv1 potassium channels in shaping the action potential waveform in the axon initial segment (AIS) of layer 5 pyramidal neurons independent of the soma. Cell-attached recordings revealed a 10-fold increase in Kv1 channel density over the first 50 microm of the AIS. Inactivation of AIS and proximal axonal Kv1 channels, as occurs during slow subthreshold somatodendritic depolarizations, led to a distance-dependent broadening of axonal action potentials, as well as an increase in synaptic strength at proximal axonal terminals. Thus, Kv1 channels are strategically positioned to integrate slow subthreshold signals, providing control of the presynaptic action potential waveform and synaptic coupling in local cortical circuits."

https://openalex.org/W2049285992,"West Nile virus (WNV), first recognized in North America in 1999, has been responsible for the largest arboviral epiornitic and epidemic of human encephalitis in recorded history. Despite the well-described epidemiological patterns of WNV in North America, the basis for the emergence of WNV-associated avian pathology, particularly in the American crow (AMCR) sentinel species, and the large scale of the North American epidemic and epiornitic is uncertain. We report here that the introduction of a T249P amino acid substitution in the NS3 helicase (found in North American WNV) in a low-virulence strain was sufficient to generate a phenotype highly virulent to AMCRs. Furthermore, comparative sequence analyses of full-length WNV genomes demonstrated that the same site (NS3-249) was subject to adaptive evolution. These phenotypic and evolutionary results provide compelling evidence for the positive selection of a mutation encoding increased viremia potential and virulence in the AMCR sentinel bird species."
https://openalex.org/W2158047249,"Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a recently described neurodegenerative disorder of older adult carriers of premutation alleles (60-200 CGG repeats) in the fragile X mental retardation gene (FMR1). It has been proposed that FXTAS is an RNA-mediated neurodegenerative disease caused by the titration of RNA-binding proteins by the CGG repeats. To test this hypothesis, we utilize a transgenic Drosophila model of FXTAS that expresses a premutation-length repeat (90 CGG repeats) from the 5' UTR of the human FMR1 gene and displays neuronal degeneration. Here, we show that overexpression of RNA-binding proteins hnRNP A2/B1 and CUGBP1 suppresses the phenotype of the CGG transgenic fly. Furthermore, we show that hnRNP A2/B1 directly interacts with riboCGG repeats and that the CUGBP1 protein interacts with the riboCGG repeats via hnRNP A2/B1."

These findings support the disease mechanism of FXTAS of rCGG repeat sequestration of specific RBPs, leading to neuronal cell death, and implicate that Pur α plays an important role in the pathogenesis of FXTAS. Fragile X syndrome is caused primarily by expansion of the CGG trinucleotide repeat in the 5′ untranslated region (5′ UTR) of the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene (Warren and Sherman, 2001Warren S.T. Sherman S.L. The fragile X syndrome.in: Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Valle D. Childs B. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. The Metabolic & Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill Companies, New York2001: 1257-1290Google Scholar). While normal individuals generally possess between 5 and 54 repeats, fully affected individuals have more than 200 CGG repeats that are referred to as full mutation alleles. Premutation alleles (55–200 CGG repeats) of the FMR1 gene are precursors of full mutation alleles, and they expand, through genetic instability, into full mutation during maternal germline transmission (Sherman, 2002Sherman S. Epidemiology.in: Hagerman R.J. Fragile X Syndrome: Diagnosis, Treatment and Research. The Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore, MD2002: 136-168Google Scholar). Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a recently identified neurodegenerative disorder found among many male premutation carriers in or beyond their fifth decade of life (Hagerman and Hagerman, 2004Hagerman P.J. Hagerman R.J. The fragile-X premutation: a maturing perspective.Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2004; 74: 805-816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Female carriers may also develop FXTAS, though the incidence is far higher in males (Hagerman et al., 2004Hagerman R.J. Leavitt B.R. Farzin F. Jacquemont S. Greco C.M. Brunberg J.A. Tassone F. Hessl D. Harris S.W. Zhang L. et al.Fragile-X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) in females with the FMR1 premutation.Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2004; 74: 1051-1056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Common features of the syndrome include progressive intention tremor, gait ataxia, parkinsonism, autonomic dysfunction, and cognitive decline (Hagerman et al., 2005Hagerman R.J. Ono M.Y. Hagerman P.J. Recent advances in fragile X: a model for autism and neurodegeneration.Curr. Opin. Psychiatry. 2005; 18: 490-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The neuropathological hallmark of FXTAS is the ubiquitin-positive intranuclear inclusion, present in both neurons and astrocytes throughout the brain (Greco et al., 2002Greco C.M. Hagerman R.J. Tassone F. Chudley A.E. Del Bigio M.R. Jacquemont S. Leehey M. Hagerman P.J. Neuronal intranuclear inclusions in a new cerebellar tremor/ataxia syndrome among fragile X carriers.Brain. 2002; 125: 1760-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the cerebellum in FXTAS patients displayed marked dropout of Purkinje cells, Purkinje axonal torpedoes, and Bergmann gliosis. However, intranuclear inclusions were absent from Purkinje cells, although they were present in a small number of neurons in the dentate nucleus and diffusely in cerebellar astrocytes (Greco et al., 2002Greco C.M. Hagerman R.J. Tassone F. Chudley A.E. Del Bigio M.R. Jacquemont S. Leehey M. Hagerman P.J. Neuronal intranuclear inclusions in a new cerebellar tremor/ataxia syndrome among fragile X carriers.Brain. 2002; 125: 1760-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). The molecular pathogenesis of FXTAS remains unclear. However, several lines of evidence have led us, as well as others, to propose an RNA-mediated gain-of-function toxicity model for FXTAS (Hagerman and Hagerman, 2002Hagerman R.J. Hagerman P.J. The fragile X premutation: into the phenotypic fold.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 278-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, Jin et al., 2003Jin P. Zarnescu D.C. Zhang F. Pearson C.E.

In cells from premutation carriers with a broad range of repeat lengths, the level of FMR1 mRNA was elevated up to 8-fold over normal levels, while the amount of FMR1-encoded protein (FMRP) appeared to remain at, or slightly below, normal levels (Kenneson et al., 2001Kenneson A. Zhang F. Hagedorn C.H. Warren S.T. Reduced FMRP and increased FMR1 transcription is proportionally associated with CGG repeat number in intermediate-length and premutation carriers.Hum. Mol.

Genet. 2000; 66: 6-15Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). Indeed, even in the high-end normal range (∼54 repeats), the FMR1 message level was nearly double that found in the most common alleles (∼30 repeats). In a “knock-in” mouse model, in which the endogenous CGG repeats (five CGG repeats in the wild-type mouse Fmr1 gene) had been replaced with an ∼100 CGG-repeat fragment, intranuclear inclusions were found to be present throughout the brain, with the exception of cerebellar Purkinje cells (Willemsen et al., 2003Willemsen R. Hoogeveen-Westerveld M. Reis S. Holstege J. Severijnen L.A. Nieuwenhuizen I.M. Schrier M. van Unen L. Tassone F. Hoogeveen A.T. et al.The FMR1 CGG repeat mouse displays ubiquitin-positive intranuclear neuronal inclusions; implications for the cerebellar tremor/ataxia syndrome.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 949-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). An increase in both the number and size of the inclusions was observed during the life course, which correlates with the progressive character of the phenotype observed in humans. Neuropathological studies in humans have revealed a highly significant association between length of the CGG tract and frequency of intranuclear inclusions in both neurons and astrocytes, indicating that the CGG repeat is a powerful predictor of neurological involvement clinically (age of death) as well as neuropathologically (number of inclusions) (Greco et al., 2006Greco C.M. Berman R.F. Martin R.M. Tassone F. Schwartz P.H. Chang A. Trapp B.D. Iwahashi C. Brunberg J. Grigsby J. et al.Neuropathology of fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS).Brain. 2006; 129: 243-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Notably, FMR1 mRNA was found in the inclusions associated with FXTAS patients (Tassone et al., 2004Tassone F. Iwahashi C. Hagerman P.J. FMR1 RNA within the intranuclear inclusions of fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS).RNA Biol. 2004; 1: 103-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Furthermore, intranuclear inclusions can be formed in both primary neural progenitor cells and established neural cell lines, as was revealed using a reporter construct with an FMR1 5′ UTR harboring expanded (premutation) CGG repeats (Arocena et al., 2005Arocena D.G. Iwahashi C.K. Won N. Beilina A. Ludwig A.L. Tassone F. Schwartz P.H. Hagerman P.J. Induction of inclusion formation and disruption of lamin A/C structure by premutation CGG repeat RNA in human cultured neural cells.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 3661-3671Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Finally, we have described a fly model of FXTAS expressing the FMR1 untranslated-CGG repeats 5′ to the EGFP coding sequence and demonstrated that premutation-length riboCGG (rCGG) repeats are toxic and sufficient to cause neurodegeneration (Jin et al., 2003Jin P. Zarnescu D.C. Zhang F. Pearson C.E. Lucchesi J.C. Moses K. Warren S.T. RNA-mediated neurodegeneration caused by the fragile X premutation rCGG repeats in Drosophila.Neuron. 2003; 39: 739-747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). These observations encouraged us to propose that transcription of the CGG90 repeats leads to an RNA-mediated neurodegenerative disease. We further posited a mechanism by which rCGG-repeat-binding proteins (RBPs) may become functionally limited by their sequestration to lengthy rCGG repeats, mechanistically similar to the pathophysiology of myotonic dystrophy (Ranum and Day, 2004Ranum L.P. Day J.W. Myotonic dystrophy: RNA pathogenesis comes into focus.Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2004; 74: 793-804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). To test this mechanism, here we identify two known RNA-binding proteins, Pur α and hnRNP A2/B1, as they are associated with premutation-length rCGG repeats. Pur α is a conserved RNA-binding protein that is expressed in neuronal cytoplasm and involved in dendritic mRNA transport. We show that the interaction between Pur α and rCGG repeats is conserved and sequence specific. Overexpression of Pur α in Drosophila could suppress rCGG-mediated neurodegeneration in a dose-dependent manner. Further, Pur α is found to be part of inclusions induced by rCGG repeats in both Drosophila and FXTAS patients. These data support the model that fragile X premutation-length rCGG repeats sequester specific RBPs, leading to neuronal cell death, and implicate that Pur α plays an important role in the pathogenesis of FXTAS. To test the sequestration model, we first questioned whether specific rCGG-repeat-binding proteins are present in brain lysates. It is noted that CGG-specific DNA-binding proteins have been identified, but these proteins do not bind RNA (Deissler et al., 1996Deissler H. Behn-Krappa A. Doerfler W. Purification of nuclear proteins from human HeLa cells that bind specifically to the unstable tandem repeat (CGG)n in the human FMR1 gene.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4327-4334Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We designed an in vitro transcription construct that contained a T7 promoter. The same DNA fragment was used previously to show that transcribed CGG repeats are toxic in Drosophila (Jin et al., 2003Jin P. Zarnescu D.C. Zhang F. Pearson C.E. Lucchesi J.C. Moses K. Warren S.T. RNA-mediated neurodegeneration caused by the fragile X premutation rCGG repeats in Drosophila.Neuron. 2003; 39: 739-747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). We labeled RNA transcripts by in vitro transcription with fluorescent nucleotide triphosphates (NTPs). The RNA was then used in gel-shift assays with both mouse and fly brain lysates. With mouse brain lysates, we observed an RNA-protein complex migrating much more slowly than probe alone. This interaction could be competed off by increasing amounts of unlabeled rCGG (Figure 1A). Similarly, a specific RNA-protein complex was also observed with fly brain lysates (Figure 1B). Furthermore, the interaction was rCGG specific and could not be competed off by the addition of the unlabeled rCAG or rCUG repeats (Figure 1B). These data suggest that specific rCGG-repeat-binding protein(s) is present in both mouse and fly brains. To identify the proteins that bind to rCGG, we scaled up the binding reaction using biotinylated rCGG repeats, which allows the capture of the repeats by binding to streptavidin-coated magnetic beads and the purification of any associated proteins. Given that the phenotype in both human and mouse models is most severe in the cerebellum, mouse cerebellar lysates were used for protein purification (Greco et al., 2006Greco C.M. Berman R.F. Martin R.M. Tassone F. Schwartz P.H. Chang A. Trapp B.D. Iwahashi C. Brunberg J. Grigsby J. et al.Neuropathology of fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS).Brain. 2006; 129: 243-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, Willemsen et al., 2003Willemsen R. Hoogeveen-Westerveld M. Reis S. Holstege J. Severijnen L.A. Nieuwenhuizen I.M. Schrier M. van Unen L. Tassone F. Hoogeveen A.T. et al.The FMR1 CGG repeat mouse displays ubiquitin-positive intranuclear neuronal inclusions; implications for the cerebellar tremor/ataxia syndrome.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 949-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The putative rCGG-repeat-binding proteins were purified by binding to a column of magnetic streptavidin beads. Next, the eluted proteins were separated on a 4%–20% gradient SDS-PAGE gel, and specific bands (A-E) were excised for protein identification by automated MALDI-MS (Figure 1C). Initial analysis revealed the identities of three out of the five bands. Bands A and E were tropomyosin and actin, respectively. Band B was revealed to be hnRNP A2/B1. Bands C and D were initially unidentifiable and subsequently reanalyzed by peptide sequencing. Band D was determined to be Pur α, and Band C was either hnRNP A or Pur β. Both tropomyosin and actin were later found to be able to interact with other RNAs nonspecifically and we did not study them further (data not shown). Among the RNA-binding proteins that we identified here, given the neurodegenerative phenotype associated with Pur α knockout mice (see below), we focused our following studies on the Pur proteins. Pur α and Pur β (purine-rich binding proteins) are single-stranded DNA- and RNA-binding proteins that have been implicated in many biological processes, including transcriptional control, initiation of DNA replication, and RNA transport/translation (Gallia et al., 2000Gallia G.L. Johnson E.M. Khalili K. Puralpha: a multifunctional single-stranded DNA- and RNA-binding protein.Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3197-3205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Johnson, 2003Johnson E.M. The Pur protein family: clues to function from recent studies on cancer and AIDS.Anticancer Res. 2003; 23: 2093-2100PubMed Google Scholar). To confirm the interaction between rCGG repeats and the Pur proteins, we repeated the binding reactions using CGG105 biotinylated RNA and cytoplasmic preparations of mouse cerebellar lysates. After binding to the magnetic streptavidin columns, the eluted fractions were used in a western blot analysis using a specific antibody raised against Pur proteins that was published previously (Khalili et al., 2003Khalili K. Del Valle L. Muralidharan V. Gault W.J. Darbinian N. Otte J. Meier E. Johnson E.M. Daniel D.C. Kinoshita Y. et al.Puralpha is essential for postnatal brain development and developmentally coupled cellular proliferation as revealed by genetic inactivation in the mouse.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6857-6875Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). This antibody recognizes both proteins, as demonstrated by the presence of two appropriately sized bands (Figure 2A; top band, Pur α; bottom band, Pur β). Cytoplasmic Pur α was found to strongly bind to the rCGG repeats. However, despite similar amounts of Pur α and β in the input, little Pur β protein was captured by the CGG105-repeat RNAs. We further explored the role of Pur proteins in rCGG-mediated neurodegeneration using the fly model. In the Drosophila genome, there is a single Pur protein ortholog: Pur α. We first tested whether Drosophila Pur protein could bind to the rCGG repeats as well. To characterize the Pur α/rCGG interaction, we developed a specific polyclonal antibody against the Drosophila Pur α protein, as shown in Figure 2B. Similar to the binding assay with mouse cerebellar lysates, we performed binding reactions using CGG105 biotinylated RNA and wild-type fly brain lysates. The captured proteins were used for western blot analysis with the dPur α antibody. As shown in Figure 2C, endogenous fly dPur α protein could also bind to rCGG repeats. Another RNA-binding protein, Drosophila Fmrp (dFMR1), which is known to bind to G-rich RNAs (G-quartet), could not bind to rCGG repeats (data not shown). These data suggest that the interaction between Pur α and rCGG repeats is conserved and specific. To further address whether Pur α directly binds to rCGG repeats, we cloned the full-length cDNA of dPur α by PCR from a fly brain cDNA library. We incubated the in vitro-translated fly dPur α with biotinylated rCGG repeats, and our data showed that dPur α could directly bind to rCGG repeats (Figure 2D). Drosophila Fmrp could not bind the rCGG repeats; it was therefore used as a negative control (Wan et al., 2000Wan L. Dockendorff T.C. Jongens T.A. Dreyfuss G. Characterization of dFMR1, a Drosophila melanogaster homolog of the fragile X mental retardation protein.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8536-8547Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). To further determine the specificity of the interaction between dPur α and rCGG repeats, we performed RNA-binding assays with or without different unlabeled competitors. The interaction between dPur α and rCGG repeats could not be competed off using unlabeled rCAG repeats, rCUG repeats, or rGCC repeats, which are complementary to rCGG repeats (Figure 2E). Only unlabeled rCGG was able to compete off dPur α from the captured RNA. These data demonstrate that dPur α displays a sequence-specific interaction with rCGG repeats and that this property has been conserved through evolution. To further determine whether Pur α interacts with rCGG repeats in vivo, using the dPur α antibody, we performed an immunoprecipitation experiment. In this experiment, dPur α protein was immunoprecipitated from fly larvae expressing either (CGG)90-EGFP or EGFP alone. The coimmunoprecipitated RNAs were isolated and subjected to RT-PCR using EGFP-specific primers. We found that only the mRNAs containing the rCGG repeats [(CGG)90-EGFP] could be coimmunoprecipitated along with dPur α (Figure 2F). This demonstrate that Pur α is indeed associated with rCGG-repeat-containing mRNA in vivo. However, we noted that only a small portion of rCGG-repeat-containing mRNA was coimmunoprecipitated. This is likely due to the fact that a large portion of dPur α was sequestered into the inclusion by rCGG repeats, and only small amount of dPur α was soluble and could be immunoprecipitated (see below). Our previous studies have shown that fragile X premutation rCGG repeats could induce the formation of inclusions, which are Hsp70 and ubiquitin positive (Jin et al., 2003Jin P. Zarnescu D.C. Zhang F. Pearson C.E. Lucchesi J.C. Moses K. Warren S.T. RNA-mediated neurodegeneration caused by the fragile X premutation rCGG repeats in Drosophila.Neuron. 2003; 39: 739-747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Given that Pur α could bind to rCGG repeats both in vitro and in vivo and that FMR1 mRNA was present in the intranuclear inclusions of FXTAS patients' brains (Tassone et al., 2004Tassone F. Iwahashi C. Hagerman P.J. FMR1 RNA within the intranuclear inclusions of fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS).RNA Biol. 2004; 1: 103-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), we examined whether dPur α is also present in the inclusions induced by rCGG repeats in the fly model. Previous studies have shown that the inclusions formed by expanded polyglutamine protein were SDS insoluble and would remain within the stacking gel after separation on SDS-PAGE gel (Zhou et al., 2001Zhou H. Li S.H. Li X.J. Chaperone suppression of cellular toxicity of huntingtin is independent of polyglutamine aggregation.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48417-48424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). We performed western blot analysis using whole-head lysates from both wild-type flies and transgenic flies expressing r(CGG)105 repeats in the eye. We observed the SDS-insoluble complexes in the stacking gel with both anti-dPur α and anti-Hsp70 antibodies (Figure 3A). This suggests that dPur α is part of the inclusions induced by the fragile X premutation rCGG repeats (Figure 3A). We did not observe decreased soluble dPur α in the head lysates because the rCGG repeats were only expressed in the eyes of the transgenic flies. Furthermore, we performed immunohistochemistry and examined the distribution of dPur α and Hsp70 proteins in both wild-type and rCGG-expressing fly eyes. In wild-type flies, dPur α was ubiquitously expressed and no inclusion was detected. However, in the eyes expressing rCGG repeats, we found that most of the Hsp70-positive inclusions contained dPur α protein as well (Figure 3B). These observations suggest that fragile X premutation rCGG repeats could alter the distribution of dPur α and sequester dPur α into inclusions. Based on findings from human postmortem samples and animal models, it has been hypothesized that rCGG RBPs may be sequestered from their normal function by binding to lengthy rCGG repeats, leading to neuronal degeneration. If the hypothesis is correct, then we predict that rCGG-mediated neurodegeneration would be suppressed by increasing the expression of RBPs. Accordingly, we generated fly UAS lines that overexpress Drosophila dPur α in the presence of a GAL4 driver. We then crossed these transgenic lines with the CGG-repeat transgenic lines that exhibit photoreceptor neurodegeneration. We discovered that overexpression of Drosophila Pur α could suppress the rCGG-mediated eye neurodegeneration in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 4 and data not shown). This finding strongly supports the mechanistic model proposed above and suggests that Pur α may play an important role in the pathogenesis of FXTAS. Our results in the Drosophila model suggest that Pur α could play an important role in the pathogenesis of FXTAS. However, in a previous study, the protein composition of the inclusions from postmortem FXTAS brain tissues was analyzed by mass spectrometry, and Pur α was not among the proteins identified (Iwahashi et al., 2006Iwahashi C.K. Yasui D.H. An H.J. Greco C.M. Tassone F. Nannen K. Babineau B. Lebrilla C.B. Hagerman R.J. Hagerman P.J. Protein composition of the intranuclear inclusions of FXTAS.Brain. 2006; 129: 256-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). To determine whether Pur α is part of the inclusion of FXTAS brain tissues that we observed in our fly model, we performed immunohistochemistry on postmortem FXTAS brain sections. We found that Pur α is indeed present in the ubiquitin-positive inclusions found in FXTAS brain tissues (Figure 5). This result validates our finding in the Drosophila model and suggests that Pur α could play an important role in the pathogenesis of FXTAS in humans. Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome is a neurodegenerative disorder recently identified among adult fragile X syndrome premutation carriers (Hagerman et al., 2005Hagerman R.J. Ono M.Y. Hagerman P.J. Recent advances in fragile X: a model for autism and neurodegeneration.Curr. Opin. Psychiatry. 2005; 18: 490-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). These patients do not exhibit any clinical features of FMR1 null fragile X syndrome, and the full-mutation patients display none of the neurodegenerative features of premutation FXTAS. Thus, it would seem that these variant FMR1 alleles could produce distinctive phenotypes via independent disease mechanisms. While fragile X syndrome is clearly due to the absence of FMR1 expression, previous studies have suggested that FXTAS is RNA mediated and caused by FMR1 transcripts with premutation-length CGG repeats (Arocena et al., 2005Arocena D.G. Iwahashi C.K. Won N. Beilina A. Ludwig A.L. Tassone F. Schwartz P.H. Hagerman P.J.

Genet. 2003; 12: 949-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). One hypothesis is that rCGG-repeat-binding proteins could be sequestered from their normal function(s) by binding to these lengthy rCGG repeats, thereby causing neurodegeneration (Hagerman and Hagerman, 2002Hagerman R.J.

Here, we report the identification and characterization of one such RBP, Pur α. We provide both biochemical and genetic data to support the disease mechanism of FXTAS of rCGG-repeat sequestration of specific RBPs, leading to neuronal cell death. Specific triplet repeat RNA-binding proteins have previously been implicated in myotonic dystrophy (Miller et al., 2000Miller J.W. Urbinati C.R. Teng-Umnuay P. Stenberg M.G. Byrne B.J. Thornton C.A.

Identification of a (CUG)n triplet repeat RNA-binding protein and its expression in myotonic dystrophy.Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4407-4414Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). There are two genetically distinct forms of this neuromuscular disorder, DM1 and DM2, caused by CTG or CCTG repeat expansions in unrelated genes (Ranum and Day, 2004Ranum L.P. Day J.W. Myotonic dystrophy: RNA pathogenesis comes into focus.Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2004; 74: 793-804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). For both forms, RNA that contains the repeat expansion is central to pathogenesis. CUG repeat RNAs bind to the splicing factor muscleblind (MBNL) in vitro and colocalize with it in vivo, suggesting that MBNL is sequestered by CUG repeats (Jiang et al., 2004Jiang H. Mankodi A. Swanson M.S. Moxley R.T. Thornton C.A. Myotonic dystrophy type 1 is associated with nuclear foci of mutant RNA, sequestration of muscleblind proteins and deregulated alternative splicing in neurons.Hum. Mol.

Recruitment of human muscleblind proteins to (CUG)(n) expansions associated with myotonic dystrophy.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4439-4448Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). The fact that loss of MBNL in the mouse leads to phenotypes similar to myotonic dystrophy further supports this notion (Kanadia et al., 2003Kanadia R.N. Johnstone K.A. Mankodi A. Lungu C.

Moreover, levels of another splicing factor, CUGBP1, are altered in DM1, and perturbation of normal splicing is observed, which suggests that pathogenesis is caused by the expanded CUG-repeat-containing RNA inducing these alterations in splicing via MBNL and CUGBP1 (Timchenko et al., 2001Timchenko N.A.

However, to date an understanding of the cellular mechanism that neurons use to modulate the functional expression of KCC2 remains rudimentary. Using Escherichia coli expression coupled with in vitro kinase assays, we first established that protein kinase C (PKC) can directly phosphorylate serine 940 (Ser940) within the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of KCC2. We further demonstrated that Ser940 is the major site for PKC-dependent phosphorylation for full-length KCC2 molecules when expressed in HEK-293 cells. Phosphorylation of Ser940 increased the cell surface stability of KCC2 in this system by decreasing its rate of internalization from the plasma membrane. Coincident phosphorylation of Ser940 increased the rate of ion transport by KCC2. It was further evident that phosphorylation of endogenous KCC2 in cultured hippocampal neurons is regulated by PKC-dependent activity. Moreover, in keeping with our recombinant studies, enhancing PKC-dependent phosphorylation increased the targeting of KCC2 to the neuronal cell surface. Our studies thus suggest that PKC-dependent phosphorylation of KCC2 may play a central role in modulating both the functional expression of this critical transporter in the brain and the strength of synaptic inhibition.

Cervero F. de Koninck Y. Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2005; 5: 547-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Adult mammalian neurons maintain low intracellular Cl– concentrations, which arise principally from the activity of the potassium chloride cotransporter-2 (KCC2). The maintenance of such low levels of intracellular Cl– ions is responsible for hyperpolarizing Cl– currents upon activation of GABAA and Gly receptors, which are responsible for fast synaptic inhibition in the adult central nervous system (2Payne J.A.

Neurol. 2004; 468: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Molecular studies have demonstrated that KCC2 is a member of a CCC superfamily and that these transporters are composed of 12-transmembrane domains with N- and C-terminal cytoplasmic domains (2Payne J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1516-C1525Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Bergeron M.J. Gagnon E. Caron L. Isenring P. J. Biol.

Developmentally KCC2 is first detected around 10 days in vitro in cultured rat neurons, which is coincident with the emergence of hyperpolarizing GABAA receptor-mediated Cl– currents (4Rivera C. Voipio J. Payne J.A. Ruusuvuori E. Lahtinen H. Lamsa K. Pirvola U. Saarma M. Kaila K. Nature. 1999; 397: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1685) Google Scholar, 8Lee H. Chen C.X. Liu Y.J. Aizenman E. Kandler K. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2005; 21: 2593-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Gene knock-out of KCC2 has revealed that ablating the expression of this protein results in early postnatal death. Neurons derived from these animals exhibit compromised GABAA receptor-mediated synaptic inhibition (9Hubner C.A. Stein V. Hermans-Borgmeyer I. Meyer T. Ballanyi K. Jentsch T.J. Neuron. 2001; 30: 515-524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Under pathological conditions such as epilepsy or ischemic brain injury, deficits in the expression of KCC2 are evident together with decreased efficacy of GABAergic inhibition and with the emergence of depolarizing GABAA receptor-mediated currents that reflect decreased neuronal Cl– extrusion (10Bonislawski D.P. Schwarzbach E.P. Cohen A.S. Neurobiol. Dis. 2007; 25: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). These changes in functional expression are believed in part to be transcriptional (11Karadsheh M.F. Delpire E. J. Neurophysiol. 2001; 85: 995-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 12Uvarov P. Pruunsild P. Timmusk T. Airaksinen M.S. J. Neurochem. 2005; 95: 1144-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), but post-translational modification of KCC2 is also likely to be of central importance. Intriguingly the activity of a number of protein kinases, including WNK3, WNK4, brain-type creatine kinase, TrkB receptors, tyrosine kinases, and PKC, have all been reported to influence KCC2 activity (13Adragna N.C. Fulvio M.D. Lauf P.K. J. Membr. Biol. 2004; 201: 109-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). However, it remains to be established whether these varying kinase activities actually directly regulate KCC2 phosphorylation and whether altered levels of phosphorylation modulate the function or membrane trafficking of this key transporter. To further address the role of phosphorylation in regulating KCC2 we have assessed whether this protein is directly phosphorylated and whether this covalent modification alters transporter functional expression. Our studies demonstrated that KCC2 is directly phosphorylated by PKC activity on Ser940 within the major C-terminal intracellular domain of this protein. PKC-dependent phosphorylation of Ser940 increased KCC2 cell surface stability and activity by decreasing endocytosis from the plasma membrane. Endogenous KCC2 expressed in hippocampal neurons was also phosphorylated by PKC activity and, in common with our recombinant studies activation of PKC, increased the accumulation of KCC2 on the neuronal plasma membrane. Together our studies suggest a critical role for PKC-mediated phosphorylation of Ser940 in KCC2 in regulating the functional expression of this transporter in the brain. Antibodies—Monoclonal mouse anti-KCC2 antibody clone N1/12 was purchased from the University of California Davis/NINDS/NIMH NeuroMab facility. Polyclonal rabbit anti-KCC2 antibody was purchased from Upstate. Biotinylation and Endocytosis Assays—Cells were washed twice with 1× PBS containing 0.5 mm MgCl2 and 1 mm CaCl2 (PBS-CM) and then incubated with 2 ml of 1× PBS-CM containing 1 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin for 30 min for biotin labeling. After labeling, the biotin reaction was quenched by washing three times with 1× PBS-CM containing 50 mm glycine and 0.1% bovine serum albumin (14Kittler J.T. Thomas P. Tretter V. Bogdanov Y.D.

Cells were then lysed in 10 mm NaPO4, 2% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 25 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μgof aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin, 5 mm EDTA, EGTA, and 100 mm NaCl, and biotinylated proteins were purified on immobilized avidin eluted in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. KCC2 levels were then measured by immunoblotting. To measure endocytosis, cells were labeled on ice as described above and incubated at 37 °C for varying time periods. The remaining cell surface biotin was then cleaved by exposure to 2 mm reduced glutathione for 10 min on ice (14Kittler J.T. Thomas P. Tretter V. Bogdanov Y.D. Haucke V. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 12736-12741Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed, and biotinylated proteins were purified as detailed above. Data were then correct for the efficiency of glutathione S-transferase cleavage (biotin remaining at time 0), and the proportion of the total cell surface population of KCC2 internalized over time was then calculated. Expression and Purification of KCC2 Fusion Proteins—The respective nucleotides encoding amino acids 1–102 and 645–1116 of KCC2 (3Payne J.A. Stevenson T.J. Donaldson L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16245-16252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar) were amplified from rat brain cDNA using the following primer pairs: AAGTCGACCATGCTCAACAACCTGACGGACTGCGAG/AAGCGGCCGCTCAGGAGTAGATGGTGATGACCTCTCGGC and CAAGGATCCGATCCGAGGCCTGTCTCTCAGTGCAGC/CAACTCGAGTCAGGAGTAGATGGTGATGACCTCTCG, respectively. They were then cloned into pTrcHis2C (Invitrogen) to yield His-N·KCC2 and His-C·KCC2. After DNA sequencing fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli strain BL21. Exponentially growing cultures were treated with 100 μm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h, and bacterial pellets were lysed using 6 m guanidine hydrochloride (pH 7.8) and sonication. The fusion protein was then bound to ProBond™ resin (Invitrogen) in 8 m urea (pH 7.8) for 30 min and washed with decreasing pH of buffer. Elution of fusion protein was then carried out by washing the resin with a buffer at pH 4.0. The eluted protein was dialyzed extensively in PBS and stored at –80 °C before use. Expression of KCC2 in HEK-293 Cells—Wild-type and mutant KCC2 cDNAs were cloned into the mammalian expression vector PRK5, which utilizes the human cytomegalovirus promoter for transgene expression (16Moss S.J. Gorrie G.H. Amato A. Smart T.G. Nature. 1995; 377: 344-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected using electroporation with a total of 10 μg of DNA and utilized 24–48 h after transfection (17Connolly C.N. Kittler J.T. Thomas P. Uren J.M. Brandon N.J. Smart T.G. Moss S.J.

Immunoblotting—Cells were lysed by lysis buffer containing 10 mm Na2HPO4, 2% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 25 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin, 5 mm EDTA, EGTA, and 100 mm NaCl. Insoluble proteins were removed by centrifugation at 13,200 rpm for 10 min. 50 μg of protein was loaded into a 6% acrylamide gel and resolved by electrophoresis by 160 V for 1 h. The resolved proteins were then electrotransferred at 50 mA onto nitrocellulose membrane over 16 h. The protein blots were blocked by 5% skim milk for 1 h. KCC2 protein was recognized by monoclonal anti-KCC2 antibody (from University of California Davis) at 1 μg/ml concentration diluted in 5% skim milk. horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-mouse secondary antibody was used to recognize the anti-KCC2 antibody at a concentration of 0.2 μg/ml. Chemiluminescence was generated by a Visiglo™ horseradish peroxidase plus substrate kit from Amresco and detected by an LAS-3000 image reader from Fujifilm. Quantification of the chemiluminescence signal was carried out by Multi Gauge version 3.0 from Fujifilm. Immunofluorescence—HEK-293 cells transfected with KCC2 plasmids or 4-week-old hippocampal neuron cultures were grown on 1-cm-diameter glass coverslips coated with 1 mg/ml poly-l-lysine. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min, washed three times with 1× PBS, and blocked with 1× PBS containing 5% skim milk and 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min. The cells were incubated with monoclonal anti-KCC2 antibody for 2 h, washed five times with 1× PBS, incubated with TRITC-conjugated polyclonal anti-mouse antibody in blocking buffer for 1 h, washed five times with 1× PBS, and mounted on glass slides with 3 μl of Vectashield® mounting medium. The prepared slides were imaged with a confocal microscope after 24 h. Acquisition of confocal images was carried out using Laser Sharp 2000 software from Bio-Rad. Quantification of fluorescence images was carried out using MetaMorph software from Universal Imaging Corp. In Vitro Kinase Assay—0.5 μg of fusion protein was incubated with 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 1–50 ng of purified PKC or cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) from Calbiochem in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, and 50 μm ATP for 10 min at 30 °C and terminated by the addition of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer (18McDonald B.J.

Neuropharmacology. 1997; 36: 1377-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture was then analyzed by SDS-PAGE. A phosphorimaging device was used to quantify the incorporation of 32P into the proteins. Neuronal Cultures—In brief, rat embryos at embryonic day 18 were removed and decapitated into 1× Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS; from Invitrogen) on ice. Brain tissues from the embryos were removed and transferred into fresh HBSS on ice, and hippocampal regions were further dissected out. Dissected hippocampi were placed in 0.25% trypsin at 37 °C for 15 min with gentle shaking. Hippocampi were washed with HBSS two times for 5 min and passed through Pasteur pipettes 10 times to dissociate. Nondissociated debris was allowed to settle to the bottom for 10 min. Dissociated hippocampal neurons were counted by hemocytometer and plated on a 60-mm culture dish at a density of 1 million/dish in attachment medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 25 mm glucose in minimum Eagle's medium (Invitrogen). 4 h after plating, the attachment medium was replaced with warm maintenance medium containing 2% B-27 neural supplement, 2% fetal bovine serum, and 0.5 mm glutamine in Neurobasal medium (Invitrogen). Hippocampal cultures were kept in an incubator conditioned at 37 °C and 5% CO2. 0.5 ml of maintenance medium was added into the culture dish every 3 days to replenish the loss of medium from evaporation. Peptide Mapping and Phosphoamino Acid Analysis—Gel slices excised from SDS-polyacrylamide gels and washed and digested with 0.1 mg/ml trypsin were subjected to two-dimensional mapping and visualized by autoradiography. The resulting phosphopeptides were also hydrolyzed using 6 n HCl, and the resulting phosphoamino acids along with phosphoamino acid standards were then separated by thin layer chromatography and visualized by autoradiography as detailed previously (18McDonald B.J. Moss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18111-18117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19McDonald B.J. Moss S.J. Neuropharmacology. 1997; 36: 1377-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Site-directed Mutagenesis—Mutation of KCC2 was carried out by PCR amplification of the whole plasmid using primer pairs that harbor the desired mutation site as follows: S728A, GAGGCTATCCGGCGCCTGATGGAGGC and CTCTGCCCGCTGAGCCTGAGG; T787A, AGGAACTTCATCGAACTCGTCCGGGAAACTAC and CCAAGCCTGATGATCCTCCTTCTGTCGCCAGTTGC; S940A, GAATCTCGGGGCGCTATTCGGAGGAAGA and ATCTGTGATGCTCTGGATCTCCCGTTCC; S1034A, GAAAACTTGAACCAGTCCAACGTGCG and CCACTCCGGCTTCATAGCGAAGAAGTCCTTG. All mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. Whole-cell Metabolic Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—HEK-293 cells or 28–35 days in vitro hippocampal neurons in 60-mm dishes were labeled with 0.5–1.0 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphoric acid for 4 h in phosphate-free media or with 200 mCi/ml [35S]methionine (16Moss S.J. Gorrie G.H. Amato A. Smart T.G. Nature. 1995; 377: 344-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Cell were then lysed in lysis buffer containing 10 mm NaPO4, 5 mm EDTA and EGTA, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 25 mm NaF, 2% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin (16Moss S.J. Gorrie G.H. Amato A. Smart T.G. Nature. 1995; 377: 344-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The supernatant was collected after centrifugation. 2 μg of antibody and 40 μl of protein A-Sepharose (1:1 slurry) were then added to the supernatant and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with constant agitation. The protein A-Sepharose was then washed extensively in lysis buffer supplemented with 500 mm NaCl and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. In Vitro Analysis of KCC2 Phosphorylation by PKC—Molecular studies have demonstrated that the consensus site for phosphorylation by a number of classical second messenger-dependent protein kinases, including both PKC and PKA, are evident within both the major intracellular domains of KCC2 (3Payne J.A. Stevenson T.J. Donaldson L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16245-16252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). To commence our studies we expressed the major N-terminal (amino acids 1–102; His-N·KCC2) and C-terminal (amino acids 645–1116; His-C·KCC2) intracellular cytoplasmic domains of KCC2 as His-tagged fusion proteins in E. coli (Fig. 1A). Purified fusion proteins were then subjected to in vitro kinase assays. This revealed that the His-C·KCC2 fusion protein was phosphorylated by purified PKC to a final stoichiometry of ∼0.6 mol/mol, whereas His-N·KCC2 was not phosphorylated under similar conditions (Fig. 1B). In contrast, neither of the fusion proteins was phosphorylated by purified PKA, but the cytoplasmic tail of the GABABR2 subunit, a previously identified of substrate of this enzyme (20Couve A. Thomas P. Calver A.R. Hirst W.D. Pangalos M.N. Walsh F.S. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), was phosphorylated under the same conditions (Fig. 1B). Peptide mapping and phosphoamino acid analysis revealed that His-C·KCC2 was primarily phosphorylated on serine residues within two major phosphopeptides labeled A and B, respectively (Fig. 1, C and D). To further analyze KCC2 phosphorylation, site-directed mutagenesis was utilized to convert candidate serine residues within His-C·KCC2 to alanines. Based on the consensus for PKC phosphorylation of (R/K)X(1–4)(S/T)X(1–3)(R/K) where X is any amino acid (21Senawongse P. Dalby A.R. Yang Z.R. J. Chem. Inf. Model. 2005; 45: 1147-1152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Kennelly P.J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15555-15558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), mutant fusion proteins were produced in which Ser728, Ser940, and Ser1034 were individually and sequentially mutated to alanines. The phosphorylation of the resulting purified proteins by PKC was then compared with that seen for His-C·KCC2. Although mutation of Ser728 and Ser1034 did not significantly alter phosphorylation, mutation of Ser940 reduced phosphorylation to 32.5 ± 2.5% of control. Moreover mutation of Ser940 in combination with either Ser728 or Ser1034 had very similar effects on PKC-dependent phosphorylation compared with mutation of Ser940 alone (Fig. 1E). The phosphorylation of the 32P-His-CS940A/KCC2 was further analyzed using peptide mapping and phosphoamino acid analysis. Significantly, this revealed that mutation of Ser940 ablated peptide A seen on PKC-dependent phosphorylation of His-C·KCC2 (Fig. 1D) and that the remaining sites of phosphorylation for this kinase in His-CS940A/KCC2 are serine residues (Fig. 1C). Together these results suggest that the major site for PKC phosphorylation within His-C·KCC2 is Ser940. Ser940 Is a Major Site for PKC-dependent Phosphorylation of KCC2 when Expressed in HEK-293 Cells—To analyze the relevance of our in vitro observations, we transiently expressed KCC2 in HEK-293 cells. KCC2 expression was first analyzed by immunoprecipitation with anti-KCC2 antibodies after metabolic labeling with [35S]methionine. This resulted in the isolation of two bands with approximate molecular masses of 125 and 130 kDa from cells expressing wild-type KCC2 but not from cells expressing empty vector. Similar bands were also immunoprecipitated from cells expressing a mutant form of KCC2 in which Ser940 (KCC2S940A) was mutated to an alanine (Fig. 2A). The phosphorylation of KCC2 was examined by immunoprecipitation after metabolic labeling with [32P]orthophosphoric acid. A major band of 130 kDa was evident from cells expressing wild-type KCC2 that was not seen in those expressing vector alone, demonstrating basal phosphorylation of this protein in HEK-293 cells. Activation of PKC with phorbol dibutyrate (PDBu) for 10 min produced a significant increase (p < 0.01) in KCC2 phosphorylation of 195.7 ± 5.6% of that evident under basal conditions (Fig. 2B). Phosphorylation of KCC2S940A was analyzed using similar methodology, and this mutant construct exhibited robust levels of basal phosphorylation. However in contrast to wild-type KCC2, PDBu did not significantly enhance the phosphorylation of KCC2S940A (Fig. 2B). These results are consistent with our in vitro experiments and strongly suggest that the major site for PKC phosphorylation within the C-terminal intracellular domain of this transporter is Ser940. Phosphorylation of Ser940 Enhances KCC2 Cell Surface Expression Levels—To address the functional consequences of KCC2 phosphorylation, we first compared the proportion of KCC2 and KCC2S940A expressed on the cell surface of HEK-293 cells using biotinylation (14Kittler J.T. Thomas P. Tretter V. Bogdanov Y.D. Haucke V. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 12736-12741Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 15Fairfax B.P. Pitcher J.A.

This revealed that 22.9 ± 4.5% of wild-type KCC2 was present on the cell surface at steady state, and this could be significantly increased to 40.6 ± 5.4% upon activation of PKC over a 10-min time period, but the total levels of KCC2 expression were not altered under the same conditions (Fig. 2C). In contrast to this 38.7 ± 4.6% of KCC2S940A was present on the plasma membrane, a level significantly higher (p < 0.01) than that of wild-type KCC2 (22.9 ± 4.5%; Fig. 2C). However, PDBu treatment did not significantly increase the cell surface expression level of KCC2S940A (Fig. 2C). To confirm the results of our biotinylation assays, we assessed the effects of activating PKC on cell surface expression levels of KCC2 using immunohistochemistry. To do so cells expressing KCC2 or KCC2S940A were treated with PDBu, permeabilized, and stained with anti-KCC2 antibodies. Confocal images were then recorded from these cells, and the pixel intensity across the entire cell was measured in the presence and absence of PBDU treatment (Fig. 3A). The relative level of membrane expression was determined by calculating the ratio of fluorescence signal associated with the cell periphery and the cytoplasm. Notably treatment of cells expressing wild-type KCC2 with PBDU significantly increased the ratio fluorescence associated with the cell periphery by 182 ± 7.2% of control untreated cells (Fig. 3, B and C). Similar experiments were performed on cells expressing KCC2S940A; however, in these cells PDBu did not significantly alter the distribution of KCC2 immunoreactivity (Fig. 3, A–C). Together these biochemical and imaging experiments indicate that phosphorylation of KCC2 on Ser940 increases transporter cell surface expression levels. PKC-dependent Phosphorylation of Ser940 Decreases KCC2 Endocytosis—To further evaluate the mechanism underlying PKC-dependent modulation of KCC2 cell surface stability, the possible role of this enzyme in regulating transporter endocytosis was evaluated. To do so transfected HEK-293 cells were labeled with NHS-SS-biotin and incubated at 37 °C for up to 20 min in the presence of leupeptin to prevent lysozomal degradation of any internalized protein (14Kittler J.T. Thomas P. Tretter V. Bogdanov Y.D. Haucke V. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 12736-12741Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). After cleavage of remaining cell surface NHS-SS-biotin with reduced glutathione, cells were lysed, and internalized biotinylated proteins were isolated on avidin and immunoblotted with KCC2 antibodies. After controlling for the efficiency of cleavage (remaining biotin at 0 min) this approach revealed that the entire cell surface population of KCC2 was endocytosed within 10 min under basal conditions. This process was linear over the initial 5-min period of the assay (Fig. 4A). Under control conditions 80.7 ± 8.2% of the total cell surface population of KCC2 was internalized within 5 min, whereas in the presence of PDBu internalization was significantly reduced (p < 0.01) to 30.5 ± 4.5% (Fig. 4B). We used the KCC2S940A mutant to assess the role of Ser940 in mediating the effects of PKC on KCC2 endocytosis. Compared with wild-type KCC2 the endocytosis of this mutant appeared to be significantly decreased over a time course of 20 min in the presence or absence of PKC activation (Fig. 4A). To quantify these results, we compared the level of endocytosis of KCC2 and KCC2S940A after a 5-min incubation at 37 °C in the presence and absence of PDBu. Significantly lower levels (p < 0.01) of KCC2S940A endocytosis were evident compared with wild-type KCC2 under these conditions (15.6 ± 3.2 versus 80.7 ± 8.2%, respectively; Fig. 4B). However, in contrast to KCC2, PDBu treatment did not significantly alter the endocytosis of KCC2S940A (Fig. 4B). These results strongly suggest that the phosphorylation of Ser940 acts to modulate cell surface stability of KCC2 by slowing its endocytosis. The Activity of KCC2 Is Increased by PKC Activation in Cultured Cells—To measure the functional effects of PKC activity on KCC2 function, expressing cells were treated with bumetanide and ouabain to inhibit endogenous Na+-K+-2Cl– cotransporter and Na+-K+-ATPase, respectively. KCC2 activity was measured by basal furosemide-sensitive 86Rb+ influx. In cells expressing KCC2, significant levels of 86Rb+ accumulation were evident over a 3–5-min time course that were not seen with cells expressing empty vector (Fig. 5). Influx was significantly enhanced (p < 0.01) by a 15-min preincubation with N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), an accepted activator of KCC2 (2Payne J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1516-C1525Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 5). Pretreatment of cells with phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) produced a large and highly significant increase (p < 0.01) in KCC2 activity as measured by furosemide-sensitive 86Rb+ influx (Fig. 5). To test the role that direct phosphorylation of KCC2 plays in this modulation, the effects of PMA on a number of KCC2 mutants were analyzed. Significantly, the ability of PKC to modulate the activity of KCC2 was blocked by mutation of Ser940, but this treatment did not alter the ability of NEM to stimulate transporter activity (Fig. 5). In contrast mutation of Ser728 or Ser1034 in KCC2 was without effect on either PKC or NEM-dependent stimulation of KCC2 activity, but interestingly mutation of Ser728 appeared to increase constitutive activity of KCC2 (Fig. 5). Together this series of experiments revealed that activation of KCC2 by PKC was dependent upon Ser940, the major site of phosphorylation for this kinase within this protein. PKC Activity Modulates the Phosphorylation and Cell Surface Stability of Endogenous KCC2 in Cultured Neurons—To examine the relevance of our recombinant studies, we examined the phosphorylation of KCC2 in hippocampal neurons. To initiate these experiments, we first examined the expression of KCC2 in these cells via immunoblotting. A major band of ∼130 kDa was seen with anti-KCC2 antibodies that was first detected at 2 weeks and reached maximal expression levels between 4–5 weeks in culture (Fig. 6A) consistent with other studies on the developmental expression of KCC2 in culture (4Rivera C. Voipio J. Payne J.A. Ruusuvuori E. Lahtinen H. Lamsa K. Pirvola U. Saarma M. Kaila K. Nature. 1999; 397: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1685) Google Scholar, 23Strange K. Singer T.D. Morrison R. Delpire E. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C860-C867Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Takayama C. Inoue Y. Neuroscience. 2006; 143: 757-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 25Takayama C. Inoue Y. Neurosci. Res. 2007; 57: 322-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To examine phosphorylation, 4–5-week cultures were labeled with [32P]orthophosphoric acid and subjected to immunoprecipitation with KCC2 antibody. Under control conditions a major phosphoprotein of 130 kDa was seen immunoprecipitating with KCC2 antibodies but not with control IgG, demonstrating that KCC2 is basally phosphorylated in hippocampal neurons (Fig. 6B). Treatment of neurons with PDBu produced a highly significant increase (p < 0.01) in KCC2 phosphorylation (p < 0.01) to 295.5 ± 22.3% of control, an effect reduced by co-application of the PKC inhibitor calphostin (Cal). In addition, inhibition of PKC alone significantly reduced (p < 0.01) the basal level of KCC2 phosphorylation to 15.5 ± 3.5% of control (Fig. 6B). KCC2 phosphorylation in this system was further evaluated using peptide mapping and phosphoamino acid analysis. Under basal conditions KCC2 was principally phosphorylated on serine and threonine residues, and that activation of PKC also induced tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 6C). Intriguingly peptide map analysis of 32P-KCC2 from neurons after activation of PKC revealed the presence of two phosphopeptides (A and B in Fig. 1D), which showed very similar migration to those evident on mapping PKC-phosphorylation 32P-His-C·KCC2 together with a neutral peptide (C in Fig. 1D). Together these results suggest that Ser940 is likely to represent a site of PKC phosphorylation in neuronal KCC2. We also examined the effects of PKC activation on the cell surface stability of KCC2 using biotinylation. This revealed that activation of PKC with PDBu produced a highly significant increase (p < 0.01) in the proportion of KCC2 expressed on the neuronal cell surface (CS) to 295.6 ± 9.8% of control, an effect that was blocked by a specific PKC inhibitor (Fig. 6D). To confirm our biotinylation experiments, we measured the effects of PKC activation on the targeting of KCC2 to the plasma membrane using immunohistochemistry followed by confocal microscopy (Fig. 7A). The relative level of membrane expression was determined by measuring the ratio of fluorescence signals associated with the cell surface and the cytoplasm of individual proximal dendrites (Fig. 7B). Treatment of neurons with PDBu significantly increased (p < 0.01) the level of KCC2 immunoreactivity at the periphery of dendrites compared with control untreated neurons, an effect that was decreased via inhibition of PKC (Fig. 7C). Therefore in common with our recombinant studies these observations demonstrated that KCC2 in its native environment is subjected to PKC-dependent phosphorylation and that this covalent modification increases the targeting of KCC2 to the neuronal cell surface. The potassium chloride cotransporter KCC2 is the major determinant of Cl– transmembrane gradients in adult neurons. The activity of KCC2 results in low intracellular Cl– concentrations that are responsible for hyperpolarizing responses of GABAA and Gly receptors in fast synaptic inhibition within the central nervous system (4Rivera C.

Kandler K. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2005; 21: 2593-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Deficits in KCC2 activity are of importance in epilepsy and other central nervous system pathologies (26Staley K.J. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2004; 548: 104-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar); therefore comprehending the cellular mechanisms neurons use to regulate the activity of this protein is of significance. Here we have begun to examine the molecular sites of phosphorylation for individual protein kinases within KCC2 and the role that these residues play in regulating its functional expression. There are a number of studies that have analyzed the regulation of KCC2 by agents that modify the activity of protein kinases and phosphatases (6Bergeron M.J. Gagnon E. Caron L. Isenring P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15959-15969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 20Couve A. Thomas P. Calver A.R. Hirst W.D. Pangalos M.N. Walsh F.S. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. Nat.

Neurosci. 2007; 27: 1642-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar); however, it remains to be demonstrated that KCC2 is actually phosphorylated in neurons. We commenced our analysis by expressing the major N-(residues 1–102) and C-terminal intracellular domains (residues 645–1116) of KCC2 as fusion proteins in E. coli and analyzed their phosphorylation in vitro. This revealed that the C-terminal but not the N-terminal fusion protein was selectively and stochiometrically phosphorylated by PKC. Peptide mapping and phosphoamino acid analysis revealed that this phosphorylation occurred on serine residues within two major phosphopeptides. Site-specific mutagenesis of Ser940 with the C-terminal fusion reduced PKC phosphorylation to ∼25% of control and ablated one of the major peptides seen on phosphorylation of the wild-type protein. Consistent with our in vitro analysis, full-length KCC2 exhibited high levels of basal phosphorylation when expressed in HEK-293 cells as measured via immunoprecipitation after metabolic labeling with [32P]orthophosphoric acid. Moreover, phosphorylation of KCC2 was robustly increased upon activation of PKC, an effect that was ablated by mutation of Ser940. Therefore our combined in vitro and in vivo analysis demonstrated that KCC2 is a substrate of PKC and that the major site of phosphorylation within the major intracellular domain of this transporter is Ser940. In addition to our recombinant experiments, we directly analyzed the phosphorylation of KCC2 in hippocampal neurons using immunoprecipitation. This revealed that under basal conditions in 28–35 days in vitro hippocampal neurons, KCC2 was basally phosphorylated on serine and threonine residues. Activation of PKC produced a dramatic increase in the stoichiometry of its phosphorylation to ∼400% of that seen under basal conditions. Enhanced phosphorylation upon the activation of PKC occurred on serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues. Consistent with our result in hippocampal neurons, we found that KCC2 is phosphorylated on serine/threonine residues in cortical neurons (not shown). In addition, oxidative stress and/or high metabolic activity have recently been reported to induce phosphorylation of KCC2 on tyrosine residues (27Wake H. Watanabe M. Moorhouse A.J. Kanematsu T. Horibe S. Matsukawa N. Asai K. Ojika K. Hirata M. Nabekura J. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 1642-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). To directly compare our recombinant and neuronal studies of KCC2 phosphorylation, we used peptide mapping. This revealed that KCC2 in hippocampal neurons was phosphorylated within three major tryptic peptides after activation of PKC. Significantly, two of these peptides were also evident on tryptic peptide mapping of the C terminus of KCC2 after PKC phosphorylation in vitro. These results together with our recombinant studies suggest that Ser940 is phosphorylated in neuronal KCC2 molecules upon the activation of PKC. The effects of PKC activity on KCC2 functional expression were evaluated using both biochemical and functional approaches. As measured by biotinylation, activation of PKC increased the cell surface expression levels of KCC2 by ∼200% relative to control over a 10-min time period. This effect of PKC on KCC2 steady state cell surface expression levels was critically dependent on Ser940, as mutation of this residue abrogated the effect of activating PKC upon transporter cell surface stability. Likewise immunohistochemistry revealed that activation of PKC increased the targeting of PKC to the periphery of HEK-293 cells, an effect that was also dependent upon Ser940. To analyze the mechanism underlying the effects of Ser940 phosphorylation on cell surface stability, the effects of PKC activity on KCC2 transporter endocytosis were measured. Under basal conditions the entire cell surface population of KCC2 was internalized over a time course of 10 min. Activation of PKC dramatically slowed the endocytosis of KCC2 compared with control, an effect that was critically dependent on Ser940, consistent with the higher steady state levels expression of this mutant. Previous experiments using Xenopus oocytes have illustrated that the activation of PKC decreases cell surface expression levels and activity of KCC2 (6Bergeron M.J. Gagnon E. Caron L. Isenring P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15959-15969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The varying effects of PMA may result from differing trafficking itineraries between oocytes and HEK-293 cells or the varying incubation temperatures of 18 and 37 °C, respectively. However, and in keeping with our results, the effects of PMA in oocytes was dependent on Ser940, suggesting a critical role for this residue in regulating KCC2 functional expression via PKC activity. As Ser940 is not conserved in other CCCs (3Payne J.A. Stevenson T.J. Donaldson L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16245-16252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar), these results suggest a unique role for this residue in regulating KCC2 function. The effects of PKC activity on the cell surface stability of KCC2 on the neuronal plasma membrane were examined. Using both biotinylation and imaging, it was evident that activation of PKC in hippocampal neurons that had been cultured for 4–5 weeks produced a large and highly significant increase in the cell surface expression levels of KCC2 within 10 min. Whether these effects were mediated via altered endocytosis remains to be ascertained; however, it is interesting to note that studies in hippocampal neurons have previously shown that under basal conditions 50% of cell surface KCC2 is degraded within 20 min. Enhancing PKC-dependent phosphorylation may thus provide a rapid and dynamic mechanism to enhance the cell surface and activity of KCC2. In keeping with this potential mechanism, Fiumelli et al. (28Fiumelli H. Cancedda L. Poo M.M. Neuron. 2005; 48: 773-786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that ECl shifts caused by changing [Ca2+]i are dependent on PKC activity. However if these effects are mediated by changes in the stochiometry of KCC2, phosphorylation has not been demonstrated. Our studies have shown that KCC2 is phosphorylated directly by PKC on Ser940 within the cytoplasmic C-terminal domain of this critical transporter and that phosphorylation of this residue acts to increase KCC2 functional expression by slowing its endocytosis. Therefore, cell signaling molecules that activate PKC signaling pathways may have profound effects on neuronal Cl– homeostasis by regulating the phosphorylation and functional expression of KCC2. Given the critical role KCC2 plays in regulating Cl– homeostasis, this phospho-dependent functional modulation may have significant consequences for the efficacy of synaptic inhibition mediated by GABAA and Gly receptors.

https://openalex.org/W2013319759,"Activity-dependent regulation of dendritic protein synthesis is critical for enduring changes in synaptic function, but how the unique features of distinct activity patterns are decoded by the dendritic translation machinery remains poorly understood. Here, we identify eukaryotic elongation factor-2 (eEF2), which catalyzes ribosomal translocation during protein synthesis, as a biochemical sensor in dendrites that is specifically and locally tuned to the quality of neurotransmission. We show that intrinsic action potential (AP)-mediated network activity in cultured hippocampal neurons maintains eEF2 in a relatively dephosphorylated (active) state, whereas spontaneous neurotransmitter release (i.e., miniature neurotransmission) strongly promotes the phosphorylation (and inactivation) of eEF2. The regulation of eEF2 phosphorylation is responsive to bidirectional changes in miniature neurotransmission and is controlled locally in dendrites. Finally, direct spatially controlled inhibition of eEF2 phosphorylation induces local translational activation, suggesting that eEF2 is a biochemical sensor that couples miniature synaptic events to local translational suppression in neuronal dendrites.

Finally, direct spatially controlled inhibition of eEF2 phosphorylation induces local translational activation, suggesting that eEF2 is a biochemical sensor that couples miniature synaptic events to local translational suppression in neuronal dendrites. Recent work has implicated local dendritic protein synthesis in many enduring forms of synaptic plasticity, such as long-term potentiation and long-term depression (e.g., Kang and Schuman, 1996Kang H.

Neurosci. 2003; 18: 3150-3152Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), although the means by which synaptic activity is coupled to the protein synthetic machinery in dendrites remains poorly understood. The fact that these forms of synaptic modification require different patterns of synaptic activity for their induction raises the question of how the local translational machinery decodes these unique activity patterns. Here, we explore this issue in the context of endogenous levels of two qualitatively distinct forms of synaptic transmission: (1) action potential (AP)-triggered release of neurotransmitter and (2) miniature synaptic transmission (minis) mediated by spontaneous, AP-independent neurotransmitter release (Fatt and Katz, 1952Fatt P. Katz B. Spontaneous subthreshold activity at motor nerve endings.J. Physiol. 1952; 117: 109-128PubMed Google Scholar). Previous results have shown that these two forms of neurotransmission regulate local translation in opposite directions—blocking APs alone inhibits, whereas blocking both APs and minis stimulates, dendritic protein synthesis (Sutton et al., 2004Sutton M.A. Wall N.R.

Miniature neurotransmission stabilizes synaptic function via tonic suppression of local dendritic protein synthesis.Cell. 2006; 125: 785-799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that neuronal dendrites possess a biochemical sensor that is specifically tuned to miniature synaptic transmission and capable of engaging the dendritic translation machinery. In principle, this sensor could be represented by a general signaling pathway that is broadly coupled to protein translation, or alternatively, it could be a signal that is dedicated to the regulation of protein translation machinery itself. One candidate in the latter category is eukaryotic elongation factor-2 (eEF2) and its associated kinase, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase III (CAMKIII; Nairn and Palfrey, 1987Nairn A.C. Palfrey H.C. Identification of the major Mr 100,000 substrate for calmodulin-dependent protein kinase III in mammalian cells as elongation factor-2.J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17299-17303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), now known as eEF2 kinase. eEF2 catalyzes ribosomal translocation during polypeptide elongation. Phosphorylation of eEF2 at Thr56 strongly inhibits its activity, thereby inhibiting protein synthesis (Ryazanov et al., 1988Ryazanov A.G. Shestakova E.A. Natapov P.G.

In addition, eEF2 phosphorylation is known to be stimulated by strong activation of ionotropic glutamate receptors (GluRs; Marin et al., 1997Marin P. Nastiuk K.L. Daniel N. Girault J.A. Czernick A.J.

These findings raise the possibility that eEF2 phosphorylation might serve to couple particular patterns of synaptic input to local translational suppression in neuronal dendrites. Here, we demonstrate that eEF2 is a biochemical sensor tuned to ongoing levels of miniature synaptic transmission in hippocampal neurons. Similar to the regulation of dendritic protein synthesis, basal AP-dependent and miniature transmission regulate eEF2 phosphorylation in opposite directions, with miniature events positively associated with the amount of eEF2 that is in its phosphorylated (translationally inactive) state. The regulation of eEF2 phosphorylation by miniature transmission is bidirectional—blocking minis markedly reduces, whereas enhancing minis stimulates, eEF2 phosphorylation. Moreover, miniature events regulate eEF2 locally in dendrites, and this regulation in turn inhibits dendritic translation in a spatially specific fashion. Taken together, our results suggest that eEF2 is a local sensor of miniature synaptic activity in dendrites that serves to couple this form of neurotransmission to local translational suppression. Previous work has shown that AP-dependent and miniature synaptic transmission regulate dendritic protein synthesis in opposite directions—blocking APs with tetrodotoxin (TTX) inhibits dendritic translation, whereas blocking miniature events stimulates dendritic protein synthesis (Sutton et al., 2004Sutton M.A. Wall N.R. Aakalu G.N. Schuman E.M. Regulation of dendritic protein synthesis by miniature synaptic events.Science. 2004; 304: 1979-1983Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, Sutton et al., 2006Sutton M.A. Ito H.T. Cressy P.

Miniature neurotransmission stabilizes synaptic function via tonic suppression of local dendritic protein synthesis.Cell. 2006; 125: 785-799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Bath application of TTX, however, blocks both presynaptic and postsynaptic APs. To confine the effects of TTX to presynaptic neurons, we used a microfluidic chamber (Taylor et al., 2005Taylor A.M. Blurton-Jones M. Rhee S.W. Cribbs D.H. Cotman C.W. Jeon N.L. A microfluidic culture platform for CNS axonal injury, regeneration and transport.Nat. Methods. 2005; 2: 599-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar) in which presynaptic or postsynaptic neurons can be fluidically isolated (Figures 1A and 1B). Application of TTX to the presynaptic compartment blocked spiking of presynaptic neurons but did not prevent postsynaptic neurons from spiking (Figure 1C). We then followed the presynaptic TTX application with postsynaptic APV to examine the effects of blocking the NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-mediated component of miniature neurotransmission on dendritic protein synthesis. Time-lapse imaging of dendrites expressing a fluorescent translation reporter (Figure 1D; Aakalu et al., 2001Aakalu G. Smith W.B. Jiang C. Nguyen N. Schuman E.M. Dynamic visualization of dendritic protein synthesis in hippocampal neurons.Neuron. 2001; 30: 489-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar) revealed that, whereas control dendrites treated with TTX alone exhibited a small decline in fluorescence over time, inhibition of NMDAR minis resulted in an increase in dendritic protein synthesis (Figures 1E and 1F). These results indicate that the translational activation accompanying mini blockade is evident during selective elimination of presynaptic APs. To examine the spatial specificity of this translational regulation, we used a dual micropipette delivery system to locally perfuse different dendritic regions of conventionally cultured neurons expressing the dendritic protein synthesis reporter. Pyramidal-like hippocampal neurons in culture were perfused continuously in HEPES-buffered saline (HBS) containing TTX (1 μM) to block all AP-induced evoked neurotransmission. After a baseline image series was taken, dendritic segments were locally perfused with TTX plus a cocktail of GluR antagonists (the AMPA receptor [AMPAR] antagonist, CNQX [40 μM] and the NMDAR antagonist APV [60 μM]), and changes in the rate of reporter synthesis over time were monitored. A fluorescent dye (Alexa 568) was included in the delivery perfusate to monitor the perfusion area throughout the experiment. We compared changes in reporter expression in the treated dendritic segment with those of other segments of the same dendrite outside the perfused area both prior to and following local perfusion. As shown in Figures 2A–2D, we found that the change in reporter expression in the treated area was initially comparable with that of other segments of the same dendrite (at t = 0 min), but following local mini blockade, perfused areas demonstrated a progressive increase in reporter expression over the next 100 min (Figures 2B–2D). Restricted perfusion of vehicle alone (Figures 2E and 2F) was ineffective in altering local reporter synthesis, and the stimulation of local protein synthesis by mini blockade was completely prevented by bath application of the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin (40 μM; Figure 2F). These results indicate that local blockade of excitatory miniature neurotransmission enhances dendritic protein synthesis in a spatially specific fashion. How do postsynaptic neurons distinguish minis from AP-driven input, and how is this distinction conveyed to the translation machinery in dendrites? To begin to address this question, we first examined the regulation of two signaling pathways strongly linked to translational control in most eukaryotic systems: the ERK-MAPK and PI3 kinase pathways (for reviews, see Holland, 2004Holland E.C. Regulation of translation and cancer.Cell Cycle. 2004; 3: 452-455Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Ruggero and Sonenberg, 2005Ruggero D. Sonenberg N. The Akt of translational control.Oncogene. 2005; 24: 7426-7434Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). We measured the phosphorylation status of ERK isoforms and Akt, a well-known downstream target of the PI3 kinase pathway, under conditions of AP block alone (with TTX) or block of both APs and excitatory miniature neurotransmission (TTX+CNQX+APV). Whereas the phosphorylation of Akt was unaltered by either manipulation, the phosphorylation (and presumably activity) of both ERK isoforms (p42 and p44) exhibited strong activity sensitivity: phosphorylation was depressed by AP blockade (Figure 3A) and exhibited an even stronger depression when minis were also blocked. These results identify the ERK-MAPK signaling pathway as a system that is highly sensitive to levels of postsynaptic activity, but it does not appear differentially responsive to evoked and spontaneous neurotransmission. We next examined if posttranslational regulation of eEF2 accompanies mini blockade. eEF2 catalyzes ribosomal translocation during polypeptide elongation, and phosphorylation of eEF2 near the N terminus (at Thr56) is known to strongly inhibit its activity in the elongation phase of protein synthesis (Ryazanov et al., 1988Ryazanov A.G. Shestakova E.A. Natapov P.G. Phosphorylation of elongation factor 2 by EF-2 kinase affects rate of translation.Nature. 1988; 334: 170-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, Redpath et al., 1993Redpath N.T. Price N.T. Severinov K.V. Proud C.G. Regulation of elongation factor-2 by multisite phosphorylation.Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 689-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). We found that unlike ERK phosphorylation, the regulation of eEF2 phosphorylation by AP-dependent and miniature neurotransmission was both qualitatively and quantitatively distinct. Relative to control, AP blockade alone induced significantly greater phosphorylation of eEF2 at Thr56, whereas additional blockade of miniature transmission produced significantly diminished levels of eEF2 phosphorylated at that site (Figure 3A). Total levels of eEF2 protein were not different between the groups, suggesting that minis regulate eEF2 phosphorylation posttranslationally. These results indicate that eEF2 phosphorylation is differentially tuned to AP-dependent and miniature synaptic transmission, and the direction of the changes are consistent with eEF2 playing a causal role in the local translational suppression mediated by excitatory miniature events. If eEF2 is a sensor of miniature neurotransmission, then an increase in Thr56 phosphorylation should occur when miniature transmission is enhanced. To address this question, we used α-latrotoxin (α-LTX), which is known to stimulate the release of predocked synaptic vesicles from presynaptic terminals (e.g., Ceccarelli et al., 1973Ceccarelli B. Hurlbut W.P. Mauro A. Turnover of transmitter and synaptic vesicles at the frog neuromuscular junction.J. Cell Biol. 1973; 57: 499-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). In whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings (n = 8), we confirmed that a low concentration of α-LTX (100 pM; in combination with 0.1 mM LaCl3 to prevent formation of α-LTX pores; Ashton et al., 2001Ashton A.C. Volynski K.E. Lelianova V.G. Orlova E.V. Van Renterghem C. Canepari M. Seagar M. Ushkaryov Y.A. alpha-Latrotoxin, acting via two Ca2+-depdendent pathways, triggers exocytosis of two pools of synaptic vesicles.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44695-44703Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) stimulates miniature release by approximately 1.5- to 2-fold (Figure 3B1; see also Sutton et al., 2004Sutton M.A. Wall N.R. Aakalu G.N. Schuman E.M. Regulation of dendritic protein synthesis by miniature synaptic events.Science. 2004; 304: 1979-1983Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). We thus examined whether augmenting miniature neurotransmission enhances eEF2 phosphorylation during AP blockade. As shown in Figure 3B, treatment with TTX alone enhanced eEF2 phosphorylation relative to untreated controls, but additional treatment with α-LTX produced a significantly greater phosphorylation of eEF2 that was sustained for at least 60 min. In contrast, block of miniature synaptic transmission with GluR antagonists again produced significantly diminished levels of p-eEF2 relative to control. Importantly, the effect of α-LTX was lost when minis were blocked postsynaptically, indicating that its positive effects on eEF2 phosphorylation require the integrity of miniature neurotransmission. Taken together, these results indicate that the phosphorylation of eEF2 is bidirectionally regulated by miniature synaptic transmission. The phosphorylation of eEF2 at Thr56 is catalyzed by eEF2 kinase, a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (Nairn and Palfrey, 1987Nairn A.C. Palfrey H.C. Identification of the major Mr 100,000 substrate for calmodulin-dependent protein kinase III in mammalian cells as elongation factor-2.J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17299-17303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since NMDARs, rather than AMPARs, are the principal source of activity-dependent Ca2+ influx at synapses, we next examined the role of these different receptor types in mediating eEF2 phosphorylation during miniature transmission (Figure 3C). We found that blocking only the NMDAR component of miniature neurotransmission (TTX+APV) was sufficient to inhibit eEF2 phosphorylation during AP blockade, and the additional blockade of AMPARs (TTX+CNQX+APV) did not significantly alter the magnitude of this effect. These results suggest that the regulation of eEF2 phosphorylation by minis is primarily downstream of NMDAR activation. To further validate the role of NMDAR minis in regulating eEF2 phosphorylation, we examined whether blocking voltage-gated Ca2+ channels that support AP-triggered neurotransmitter release would also enhance eEF2 phosphorylation at Thr56. Similar to the effects of direct AP blockade (with TTX), neurons treated with antagonists to the Ca2+ channels associated with evoked transmission at hippocampal synapses (N-type channel blocker ω-conotoxin GVIA, 1 μM, and the P/Q-type blocker ω-agatoxin IVA, 200 nM; Wheeler et al., 1994Wheeler D.B. Randall A. Tsien R.W. Roles of N-type and Q-type Ca2+ channels in supporting hippocampal synaptic transmission.Science. 1994; 264: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar) exhibited increased levels of p-eEF2 relative to untreated controls. As before, coincident blockade of NMDARs produced the opposite effect—significantly diminished levels of p-eEF2 (Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). Thus, the differential regulation of eEF2 phosphorylation by AP-dependent and miniature neurotransmission revealed in our earlier experiments is not strictly dependent on blocking APs per se, but rather on evoked neurotransmitter release. To further examine activity-dependent eEF2 phosphorylation, we stained neurons with an antibody specific for p-eEF2 (Marin et al., 1997Marin P. Nastiuk K.L. Daniel N. Girault J.A. Czernick A.J. Glowinski J. Nairn A.C. Premont J. Glutamate-dependent phosphorylation of elongation factor-2 and inhibition of protein synthesis in neurons.J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 3445-3454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and examined the levels of p-eEF2 in the dendrites of neurons treated with AP blockade alone or a coincident blockade of miniature synaptic transmission (Figure 3D–3F). Similar to our biochemical experiments, neurons treated with TTX alone exhibited marked elevation of p-eEF2 in dendrites relative to untreated controls (Figure 3D). Coincident blockade of both AMPAR and NMDAR-dependent miniature neurotransmission (TTX+CNQX+APV) during TTX treatment strongly counteracted the increase in eEF2 phosphorylation observed with AP block alone. Again, this effect was primarily mediated by NMDARs, since selective blockade of NMDAR miniature neurotransmission (TTX+APV) largely accounted for the decrease in p-eEF2 levels in dendrites (Figures 3E and 3F). Together, these results demonstrate that ongoing miniature synaptic transmission, acting primarily through NMDAR activity, stimulates eEF2 phosphorylation in neuronal dendrites. We next asked whether minis can regulate eEF2 phosphorylation locally in dendrites. To address this, we blocked APs in the entire dish (by bath application of TTX) and then locally blocked NMDARs using restricted perfusion of APV. Post hoc immunostaining for p-eEF2 revealed that local blockade of NMDAR minis (for 60 min) resulted in a decrease in p-eEF2 in the treated area relative to adjacent dendritic segments (Figures 4A–4E), whereas local perfusion of vehicle alone had no effect on p-eEF2 expression (Figure 4E). Conversely, local enhancement of miniature synaptic transmission by spatially restricted delivery of α-LTX during global AP blockade produced the opposite effect—a specific increase in p-eEF2 levels in perfused dendritic segments relative to other dendritic segments (Figures 5A–5E). These effects on local p-eEF2 levels were not due to redistribution of eEF2 in dendrites, since the relative levels of total eEF2, independent of the phosphorylation state, were not altered by restricted perfusion of either APV or α-LTX (Figure 5F). Together, these results indicate that the phosphorylation of eEF2 at Thr56 is bidirectionally and locally regulated in neuronal dendrites by levels of miniature neurotransmission.Figure 5Local Enhancement of Miniature Transmission Stimulates eEF2 PhosphorylationShow full captionTTX (1 μM) + LaCl3 (0.1 mM) was bath applied approximately 60 min prior to local perfusion of the same solution plus 500 pM α-LTX for an additional 45–60 min (n = 11 dendrites from five cells).(A) DIC image showing neuron with local α-LTX perfusion spot (red).(B) p-eEF2 staining for the neuron shown in (A); intensity of p-eEF2 immunofluorescence given by color look-up table.

Data are expressed as in (E). Neither local APV nor local α-LTX altered overall expression of eEF2 in the treated area. The above results indicate that ongoing miniature synaptic transmission potently regulates eEF2 phosphorylation, primarily via the activity of NMDARs. Given that this phosphorylation inhibits eEF2 function, we hypothesized that activation of eEF2 kinase by NMDAR minis contributes to the translational suppression that miniature events normally provide. If so, then inhibiting the kinase should be sufficient to stimulate translation. To address this question, we took advantage of two distinct eEF2 kinase inhibitors, rottlerin (Gschwendt et al., 1994Gschwendt M. Kittstein W. Marks F. Elongation factor-2 kinase: effective inhibition by the novel protein kinase inhibitor rottlerin and relative insensitivity towards staurosporine.FEBS Lett. 1994; 338: 85-88Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and NH125 (Arora et al., 2003Arora S. Yang J.M. Kinzy T.G. Utsumi R. Okamoto T. Kitayama T. Ortiz P.A. Hait W.N. Identification and characterization of an inhibitor of eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase against human cancer cell lines.Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 6894-6899PubMed Google Scholar), and examined their effect on protein synthesis (using the reporter described above) in dendrites when APs were blocked. After acquiring a baseline image in the presence of TTX alone, neurons were acutely challenged with either rottlerin (5 μM), NH125 (10 μM), or vehicle (TTX alone) and imaged 60 and 120 min later. While neurons maintained in TTX alone exhibited stable levels of reporter expression in distal dendrites, those acutely challenged with rottlerin or NH125 each exhibited marked increases in dendritic reporter expression over time (Figures 6A and 6B). To examine if these changes in reporter expression were due to enhanced protein synthesis, we repeated the same experiment in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin (40 μM). Reporter expression in neurons treated with anisomycin diminished substantially over time, and importantly, the rate of reporter loss was nearly identical under the three conditions examined (Figures 6C and 6D). These results indicate that the increase in reporter expression observed after blocking eEF2 kinase is due to enhanced protein synthesis rather than other posttranslational factors (e.g., degradation). Finally, since rottlerin is also known to inhibit PKCδ, we examined the effects of a PKC inhibitor, Bisindolymaleimide I (Bis; 1 μM), at a concentration that effectively blocks this isoform. Unlike the effects of rottlerin or NH125, coincident administration of Bis during TTX did not alter dendritic reporter expression relative to TTX alone (mean ± SEM baseline at 120 min: TTX alone, 91.2% ± 14.6%; TTX + Bis, 88.6% ± 17.3%; n = 12 cells/group, nonsignificant). Thus, the enhanced rates of reporter synthesis observed with rottlerin and NH125 cannot be attributed to their effects on PKC. Given that under conditions of intact miniature transmission, direct inhibition of eEF2 kinase stimulates dendritic protein synthesis, we next asked whether the local regulation of eEF2 phosphorylation by miniature neurotransmission is sufficient to provide spatially specific control of dendritic translation. After a baseline image series was acquired in the presence of bath-applied TTX, dendritic segments were locally perfused with TTX+NH125 to block eEF2 kinase in a spatially defined area. For locally treated dendrites, we compared changes in reporter expression in the treated dendritic segment with those of other dendritic segments outside the perfused area both prior to an"

Yet little is known about how these regions interact, especially in humans. We investigated the contribution of the amygdala to reward-related signals in PFC by scanning two rare subjects with focal bilateral amygdala lesions using fMRI. The subjects performed a reversal learning task in which they first had to learn which of two choices was the more rewarding, and then flexibly switch their choices when contingencies changed. Compared with healthy controls, both amygdala lesion subjects showed a profound change in ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) activity associated with reward expectation and behavioral choice. These findings support a critical role for the human amygdala in establishing expected reward representations in PFC, which in turn may be used to guide behavioral choice."

https://openalex.org/W2150485807,"Dopamine has been implicated in the modulation of diverse forms of behavioral plasticity, including appetitive learning and addiction. An important challenge is to understand how dopamine's effects at the cellular level alter the properties of neural circuits to modify behavior. In the nematode C. elegans, dopamine modulates habituation of an escape reflex triggered by body touch. In the absence of food, animals habituate more rapidly than in the presence of food; this contextual information about food availability is provided by dopaminergic mechanosensory neurons that sense the presence of bacteria. We find that dopamine alters habituation kinetics by selectively modulating the touch responses of the anterior-body mechanoreceptors; this modulation involves a D1-like dopamine receptor, a Gq/PLC-beta signaling pathway, and calcium release within the touch neurons. Interestingly, the body touch mechanoreceptors can themselves excite the dopamine neurons, forming a positive feedback loop capable of integrating context and experience to modulate mechanosensory attention."
https://openalex.org/W1991124252,"Immortalized human cells are able to maintain their telomeres by telomerase or by a recombination-mediated DNA replication mechanism known as alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT). We showed previously that overexpression of Sp100 protein can suppress ALT and that this was associated with sequestration of the MRE11/RAD50/NBS1 (MRN) recombination protein complex by Sp100. In the present study, we determined whether MRN proteins are required for ALT activity. ALT cells were depleted of MRN proteins by small hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown, which was maintained for up to 100 population doublings. Knockdown of NBS1 had no effect on the level of RAD50 or MRE11, but knockdown of RAD50 also depleted cells of NBS1, and knockdown of MRE11 depleted cells of all three MRN proteins. Depletion of NBS1, with or without depletion of other members of the complex, resulted in inhibition of ALT-mediated telomere maintenance, as evidenced by decreased numbers of ALT-associated promyelocytic leukemia bodies and decreased telomere length. In some clones there was an initial period of rapid shortening followed by stabilization of telomere length, whereas in others there was continuous shortening at a rate within the reported range for normal human somatic cells lacking a telomere maintenance mechanism. In contrast, depletion of NBS1 in telomerase-positive cells did not result in telomere shortening.

Telomeres are specialized structures found at the end of chromosomes and, in humans, consist of linear tandem arrays of TTAGGG repeats. Together with their associated binding proteins, telomeres play a critical role in protecting the chromosomes from end degradation and end-to-end fusions and are essential for chromosomal stability and genomic integrity (1de Lange T. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 532-540Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In normal somatic human cells, telomeres shorten by 50-150 bp/cell division as the result of the end replication problem and telomere end processing, which ultimately leads to cellular replicative senescence including permanent withdrawal from the cell cycle (2Olovnikov A.M. J. Theor. Biol. 1973; 41: 181-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (1434) Google Scholar, 3Harley C.B. Mutat. Res. 1991; 256: 271-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar). Most cancer cells are able to prevent telomere shortening by activating a telomere maintenance mechanism (4Colgin L.M. Reddel R.R. Curr. Opin. Genet.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4953-4962Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), the molecular details of ALT are yet to be elucidated. One feature of ALT-positive cells, which is in contrast to telomerase positive cells and cells lacking a telomere maintenance mechanism, is the highly heterogeneous length of their telomeres (6Bryan T.M. Englezou A. Gupta J. Bacchetti S. Reddel R.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4240-4248Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar). In addition to progressive attrition of telomeres with each cell division, ALT telomeres undergo both rapid elongation and rapid deletion events resulting in telomere lengths that range from very short to extremely long (>50 kb) (8Murnane J.P. Sabatier L. Marder B.A. Morgan W.F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4953-4962Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Another phenotypic marker of ALT cells is the presence of extrachromosomal telomeric circles, which are similar in size to telomeric t-loops and have been proposed to result from homologous recombination events at the telomeres (9Cesare A.J.

We have shown previously that the overexpression of Sp100, a constitutive component of PML bodies, suppresses APB formation, causes progressive telomere shortening, and inhibits the rapid changes in telomere length that are characteristic of ALT cells.

Hence, it is not surprising that in addition to the formation of the MRN complex, MRE11 and RAD50 are able to associate independently of NBS1. The MRE11/RAD50 complex is found at interphase telomeres in association with TRF1 and TRF2 and is thought to help stabilize telomere t-loop formation. It has been shown that NBS1 joins MRE11 and RAD50 at the telomeres during S phase (14Zhu X.D. Kuster B. Mann M. Petrini J.H. de Lange T. Nat.

In humans, mutations that have been identified in MRN genes are hypomorphic; the encoded proteins are usually truncated and exhibit reduced function.

To date, no RAD50-related human syndromes have been identified. In this study we investigated whether the MRN complex is required for the ALT mechanism. The cells were depleted of MRN proteins by shRNA-mediated knockdown. Knockdown of NBS1 had no effect on the level of RAD50 or MRE11, but knockdown of RAD50 also depleted cells of NBS1, and knockdown of MRE11 depleted cells of all three members of the MRN complex. Each of these treatments resulted in decreased numbers of ALT-associated PML bodies (APBs) and decreased telomere length. In some cases the decrease in telomere length was rapid, but some cells exhibited progressive telomere shortening at a rate (∼140 bp/PD) within the range reported for normal human somatic cells that lack an active telomere maintenance mechanism. We also examined the effect of NBS1 knockdown in telomerase-positive cells and found no change in telomere length. We conclude that the MRN complex is required for the ALT mechanism. Cell Culture and Transfections—The spontaneously immortalized ALT-positive Li-Fraumeni Syndrome fibroblast line, IIICF/c (41Rogan E.M. Bryan T.M. Hukku B. Maclean K. Chang A.C.M. Moy E.L. Englezou A.

Methionine-deficient medium was reconstituted from methionine- and cysteine-deficient Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) by adding l-cysteine (48 mg/liter; Invitrogen). IIICF/c and HT1080 cells were transfected with shRNA constructs using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) and 5 μg of DNA/10-cm dish and selected with puromycin (Merck), and individual puromycin-resistant colonies were isolated by cloning rings. IIICF/c and HT1080 cells were then passaged continuously in medium containing puromycin (0.2 and 0.4 μg/ml, respectively). For methionine restriction, the cells were seeded in normal medium and grown for 2 days to ∼50% confluency. Before changing to methionine-deficient medium, the cells were washed once with methionine-free medium. Four days later, the cells were fixed and immunostained for the target protein and APBs (as identified by colocalization of TRF1, TRF2, or telomeric DNA with PML bodies) (13Jiang W.Q. Zhong Z.H.

Construction of Small Hairpin RNA Plasmids—shRNA constructs for long term knockdown were designed and then generated by cloning the annealed complementary oligonucleotides into pCIpur vector. Expression of the small hairpin was driven by a human U6 promoter. The effectiveness of each shRNA construct was tested by transient transfection of IIICF/c cells and Western blotting at 48 h post-transfection.

Antibodies—The following antibodies were used in this study: mouse anti-NBS1, anti-MRE11, anti-RAD50 (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA); rabbit anti-actin (Sigma); rabbit anti-NBS1 (Ab-1) (Oncogene Research Products, Boston, MA); mouse anti-RAD50 (GeneTex, San Antonio, TX); rabbit anti-MRE11 (Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO); goat anti-NBS1 (C-19) and goat anti-PML (N-19) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); rabbit anti-PML (Chemicon, Temecula, CA); and mouse anti-TRF2 (Upstate Biotechnology, Waltham, MA). Polyclonal anti-TRF1 rabbit serum was raised in-house against a TRF1 peptide (residues 13-35). Immunostaining, Telomere Fluorescence in Situ Hybridization (FISH), and Fluorescence Microscopy—Cells cultured in four-well chamber slides were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 15 min and then permeated with methanol:acetone (1:1) at -20 °C for 15 min. The cells were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C and then were incubated with fluorescently conjugated secondary antibodies at room temperature for 40 min. The secondary antibodies used were as follows: AMCA (7-amino-4-methylcoumarin-3-acetic acid)-, fluorescein isothiocyanate-, or Texas Red-conjugated donkey anti-mouse; AMCA-, fluorescein isothiocyanate-, or Texas Red-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit; and AMCA- or Texas Red-conjugated donkey anti-goat (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). Finally, the preparations were mounted in glycerol/phosphate-buffered saline (60:40 v/v). Mitotic chromosome preparations were obtained according to standard cytogenetic protocols. Telomere FISH with a Cy3-conjugated telomere-specific peptide nucleic acid probe (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) was performed essentially as described previously (42Perrem K. Colgin L.M. Neumann A.A. Yeager T.R. Reddel R.R. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 3862-3875Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Metaphases were evaluated on a Leica DMLB fluorescence microscope with appropriate filter sets, and 4′,6′-diamino-2-phenylindole and Cy3 images were captured separately as monochromatic 12-bit images with a cooled charge-coupled device camera (SPOT2; Diagnostic Instruments, Sterling Heights, MI), merged and pseudocolored, and further processed for illustrative purposes with Adobe Photoshop 6.0 software (Adobe, San Jose, CA). Immunoblotting—For immunoblotting analyses, the cell lysates were electrophoretically separated on 8.5% SDS-PAGE gels and electrotransferred to a nylon membrane as described previously (43Toouli C.D. Huschtscha L.I. Neumann A.A. Noble J.R. Colgin L.M. Hukku B. Reddel R.R. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 128-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting of the MRN complex was performed by incubation with a mixture of primary antibodies against MRE11, RAD50, and NBS1 (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). Western blotting procedures were carried out according to the manufacturers' protocols. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or swine anti-rabbit IgG (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark) were used as secondary antibodies. Terminal Restriction Fragment Analysis—Telomere length was determined by pulsed field gel electrophoresis as previously described (6Bryan T.M. Englezou A. Gupta J. Bacchetti S. Reddel R.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4240-4248Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar). Terminal restriction fragments were generated by restriction digest of genomic DNA with HinfI and RsaI (Roche, Nutley, NJ) and 1.5 μg DNA/well was loaded for analysis. Molecular weight markers were also loaded on the same gel, and a standard curve was generated to determine the molecular weight of telomeric bands. The gels were exposed to a phosphorus screen for 6 h and then scanned with a Storm 860 optical scanner with ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Telomere lengths were calculated using the scanned TRF images and Telometric software, version 1.2 (Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA). To determine the requirement of the individual components of the MRN complex for the ALT mechanism, we used shRNA for long term knockdown of MRE11, RAD50, and NBS1 in the IIICF/c ALT cell line. IIICF/c is a spontaneously immortalized Li-Fraumeni syndrome fibroblast cell line in which we have demonstrated that ALT can be suppressed by Sp100-mediated sequestration of the MRN complex (16Jiang W.Q. Zhong Z.H. Henson J.D. Neumann A.A. Chang A.C. Reddel R.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 2708-2721Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Following transfection with shRNA, IIICF/c cells were subjected to puromycin selection, and then individual puromycin-resistant colonies were isolated. A total of 14 clones expressing NBS1-shRNA (N1-N14) were selected. At PD28, Western analysis was performed to determine the effectiveness of NBS1 knockdown (Fig. 1A). All but one (N14) of the 14 clones were found to have reduced levels of NBS1 as compared with the empty vector clones P1-P3. The extent of NBS1 knockdown varied between clones, and in some it was knocked down by more than 95%. There was a small reduction of ∼5-10% in growth rate of NBS1-depleted cells (data not shown), but there were no apparent phenotypic or morphological changes in these cells. These 14 clones and control cells were analyzed for telomere length by Southern-based TRF analysis at PD28 (Fig. 1B). IIICF/c cells have telomeres with the highly heterogeneous lengths that are typical of ALT. The majority (9 of 13) of the NBS1 knockdown clones had telomeres that were significantly shorter than the parental IIICF/c cells at this early time point (Fig. 1B), but some (4 of 13) did not. This was also confirmed by telomere FISH (Fig. 2 and data not shown). We quantitated telomere length and compared this with the NBS1 expression level (Fig. 1C). The telomeres of the 13 clones in which NBS1 was depleted (clones N1-N13) were significantly shorter (p = 0.039) than those of the control populations (including clone N14, in which NBS1 was not knocked down). When the NBS1 knockdown cells were divided into two groups according to whether there was telomere shortening at PD28, no difference was found in the extent of NBS1 depletion (p = 0.55), although the telomere lengths of these two groups were significantly different (p < 0.001). Thus, there was significant telomere shortening in the NBS1-depleted clones overall, but the NBS1 level did not predict the extent of telomere shortening at this early time point. To determine whether depletion of NBS1 causes progressive telomere shortening, we examined by TRF analysis the telomere length of one clone that had shortening at PD28 (N4) and one that did not (N11), as well as five control clones (S1-S5) expressing a scrambled control shRNA (Fig. 3A) for up to 77 PD. All of the control clones S1-S5 exhibited telomere length profiles that were indistinguishable from those of the parental IIICF/c cells. In contrast, clones N4 and N11 both displayed significant telomere shortening. As expected, the scrambled shRNA did not alter the levels of MRE11, RAD50, or NBS1 relative to that of the untransfected IIICF/c cells (Fig. 3B). Immunoblotting showed that NBS1 shRNA in clones N4 and N11 effectively knocked down NBS1 expression without affecting MRE11 and RAD50 protein levels (Fig. 3C). Telomere lengths of the five control clones (S1-S5) and the NBS1-depleted clones (Fig. 3A) were measured and presented graphically (Fig. 3D). All five control clones (S1-S5) showed similar telomere length profiles (Fig. 3D). TRF analysis confirmed that N4 had very short telomeres at the first point of analysis, PD28 (Fig. 3, A and D); we calculated that N4 had lost more than 17 kb of telomeric repeat sequence by PD28 or, on average, 600 bp of telomeric repeats/cell division (Fig. 3D). No further shortening occurred from PD28 to PD77 (Fig. 3A), even though telomerase activity was not detected in these cells by the telomere repeat amplification protocol assay (data not shown). Unlike the N4 clone, N11 did not exhibit an initial bulk loss of telomeric DNA, and at the early time point had long heterogeneous telomeres comparable with the parental cells and control transfectants (Fig. 3, A and D). Detailed analysis of telomere length in N11 showed that there was a continual and gradual erosion of the telomeres with increasing PDs. We calculated the rate of telomere shortening to be ∼140 bp/PD, which is comparable with the rate of telomere shortening observed in cells lacking an active telomere maintenance mechanism. Consistent with telomere shortening, there was a substantial reduction in the number of APBs in N4 and N11 compared with the parental IIICF/c and control clones, but the formation of other PML bodies was not perturbed (Fig. 4 and Table 1).TABLE 1Proportion of APB-positive shRNA transfected IIICF/c cellsCell lineAPB+/totalAPB detection method%IIICF/c (P148)119/204 (58.3)TRF1, TRF2, PMLS1 (PD33)112/201 (55.7)TRF1, TRF2, PMLS2 (PD33)115/216 (53.2)TRF1, TRF2, PMLS3 (PD33)110/209 (52.6)TRF1, TRF2, PMLN4 (PD35)33/208 (15.9)TRF2, PMLN11 (PD35)42/203 (20.7)TRF2, PMLR20 (PD33)40/217 (18.4)TRF1, PMLR24 (PD32)31/213 (14.6)TRF1, PMLM18 (PD31)78/207 (37.7)TRF2, PMLM28 (PD31)71/206 (34.5)TRF2, PML Open table in a new tab To determine whether the MRN complex is equally important for both the ALT and telomerase-dependent telomere maintenance mechanisms, we transfected HT1080 telomerase-positive cells with scrambled control shRNA and NBS1-shRNA. As in IIICF/c cells, greater than 95% knockdown of NBS1 was achieved in clones HT-N1, HT-N3, and HT-N6, as shown by Western blot analysis (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, this level of knockdown was maintained for up to 38 PDs. In addition, down-regulation of RAD50 was also observed in all three clones. TRF analysis at PD26 and PD38 demonstrated that no obvious change in telomere length occurred in NBS1-depleted HT1080 cells (Fig. 5B). In contrast to NBS1-depleted IIICF/c ALT cells, no telomere shortening was observed in NBS1-depleted HT1080 cells with increasing PDs as compared with the controls (untransfected parental HT1080 and scrambled shRNA control clones HT-S1 and HT-S2). Next we transfected IIICF/c cells with a RAD50 shRNA construct. After selection with puromycin, a total of 24 clones were isolated, of which seven clones showed substantial RAD50 knockdown by Western blot analysis (Fig. 6A). Telomere length analysis of these seven clones at PD28 showed that three (R1, R3, and R15) had significantly shortened telomeres that were similar to those in NBS1 knoc"

https://openalex.org/W2009432227,"The light-sensing organelle of the vertebrate rod photoreceptor, the outer segment (OS), is a modified cilium containing approximately 1,000 stacked disc membranes that are densely packed with visual pigment rhodopsin. The mammalian OS is renewed every ten days; new discs are assembled at the base of the OS by a poorly understood mechanism. Our results suggest that discs are formed and matured in a process that involves specific phospholipid-directed vesicular membrane targeting. Rhodopsin-laden vesicles in the OS axonemal cytoplasm fuse with nascent discs that are highly specialized with abundant phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P). This membrane coupling is regulated by the FYVE domain-containing protein, SARA, through its direct interaction with PI3P, rhodopsin, and SNARE protein syntaxin 3. Our model, in contrast to the previously proposed evagination model, suggests that the vesicular delivery of rhodopsin in the OS concentrates rhodopsin into discs, and this process directly participates in disc biogenesis."

Hyp is a major contributor to triple-helix stability in animal collagens, but is not present in bacteria, which lack prolyl hydroxylase. To explore the basis of bacterial collagen triple-helix stability in the absence of Hyp, biophysical studies were carried out on recombinant Scl2 protein, the isolated collagen-like domain from Scl2, and a set of peptides modeling the Scl2 highly charged repetitive (Gly-Xaa-X′aa)n sequences. At pH 7, CD spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering, and differential scanning calorimetry of the Scl2 protein all showed a very sharp thermal transition near 36 °C, indicating a highly cooperative unfolding of both the globular and triple-helix domains. The collagen-like domain isolated by trypsin digestion showed a sharp transition at the same temperature, with an enthalpy of 12.5 kJ/mol of tripeptide. At low pH, Scl2 and its isolated collagen-like domain showed substantial destabilization from the neutral pH value, with two thermal transitions at 24 and 27 °C. A similar destabilization at low pH was seen for Scl2 charged model peptides, and the degree of destabilization was consistent with the strong pH dependence arising from the GKD tripeptide unit. The Scl2 protein contained twice as much charge as human fibril-forming collagens, and the degree of electrostatic stabilization observed for Scl2 was similar to the contribution Hyp makes to the stability of mammalian collagens. The high enthalpic contribution to the stability of the Scl2 collagenous domain supports the presence of a hydration network in the absence of Hyp.

At low pH, Scl2 and its isolated collagen-like domain showed substantial destabilization from the neutral pH value, with two thermal transitions at 24 and 27 °C. A similar destabilization at low pH was seen for Scl2 charged model peptides, and the degree of destabilization was consistent with the strong pH dependence arising from the GKD tripeptide unit. The Scl2 protein contained twice as much charge as human fibril-forming collagens, and the degree of electrostatic stabilization observed for Scl2 was similar to the contribution Hyp makes to the stability of mammalian collagens. The high enthalpic contribution to the stability of the Scl2 collagenous domain supports the presence of a hydration network in the absence of Hyp. Collagens are considered to be the characteristic structural molecules of the extracellular matrix of multicellular animals. Fibril-forming collagens and basement membrane collagens are ubiquitous in vertebrates and invertebrates, whereas families of more specialized collagens have developed in different organisms such as the 28 distinct collagen types found in vertebrates (1Exposito J.Y.

FASEB J. 1994; 8: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In recent years, the range of occurrence of collagen-like sequences with Gly as every 3rd residue and a high Pro content has been extended from metazoans to >100 proteins in bacteria and bacteriophage (5Rasmussen M. Jacobsson M. Bjorck L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32313-32316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). An understanding of the structure and stabilization of such bacterial collagens presents new challenges because they lack the Hyp post-translational modification characteristic of animal collagens. A high content of Hyp is a unique stabilizing feature of animal collagens. The characteristic structural motif of all collagens is the triple helix, composed of three left-handed polyproline II-type chains (3 residues/turn) wound around the central axis to form a right-handed superhelix (6Brodsky B. Persikov A.V. Adv. Protein Chem. 2005; 70: 301-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 7Ramachandran G.N. Kartha G.

The close packing of each chain near the central axis constrains every 3rd residue of the amino acid sequence to be Gly, generating the repeating sequence (Gly-Xaa-X′aa)n. A high content of the imino acids Pro and Hyp is found in all animal collagens, and their restricted ring conformation close to the ϕ,ψ dihedral angles found in the triple helix confers entropic stabilization to collagen (9Josse J. Harrington W.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1964; 93: 269-287Crossref Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 10Privalov P.L. Adv. Protein Chem. 1982; 35: 1-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar). Pro residues located in the X′aa position of the (Gly-Xaa-X′aa)n sequence become post-translationally modified to Hyp by prolyl hydroxylase (11Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.I. Trends Genet. 2004; 20: 33-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). The presence of Hyp residues in the X′aa position confers a thermal stability greater than that conferred by Pro residues. Inhibition of post-translational hydroxylation leads to a decrease in the melting temperature of type I collagen by ∼15 °C (12Berg R.A. Prockop D.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1973; 52: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 13Jimenez S. Harsch M. Rosenbloom J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1973; 52: 106-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), whereas recombinant human collagen homotrimers of type I α1-chains that are unhydroxylated have a Tm ∼ 11 °C lower than that of the hydroxylated form (14Perret S. Merle C. Bernocco S. Berland P. Garrone R. Hulmes D.J. Theisen M. Ruggiero F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43693-43698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Confirmation of Hyp stabilization of the triple helix and its position-specific nature is seen in model peptides, where Tm ∼ 60 °C for (Pro-Hyp-Gly)10, Tm ∼ 30 °C for (Pro-Pro-Gly)10, and Tm < 0 °C for (Hyp-Pro-Gly)10 (15Inouye K. Kobayashi Y. Kyogoku Y. Kishida Y. Sakakibara S. Prockop D.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 219: 198-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). A close correlation is observed between the thermal stability of the collagen molecule and the upper environmental temperature of the organism (16Rigby B.J. Nature. 1968; 219: 166-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), and analysis suggests that Hyp is a major determinant of the variations in thermal stability among organisms (17Burjanadze T.V. Biopolymers. 1982; 21: 1489-1501Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The mechanism of Hyp stabilization of the triple helix is controversial because the hydroxyl group of Hyp points outward from the triple helix and cannot form any direct intramolecular hydrogen bonds. The classic calorimetric studies of Privalov (10Privalov P.L. Adv. Protein Chem. 1982; 35: 1-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar) showed that collagens have a very high enthalpic contribution to their stability compared with other proteins and that this calorimetric enthalpy increases with Hyp content. Because direct intramolecular hydrogen bonding is not possible, Privalov postulated Hyp participation in a hydration network involving available backbone carbonyl groups. Such an extensive oriented water-mediated hydrogen bonding network, supported by early NMR studies (18Migchelsen C. Berendsen H.J.C. J. Chem. Phys. 1973; 59: 296-305Crossref Scopus (119) Google Scholar), is seen in the high resolution crystal structures of collagen-like peptides (19Bella J. Brodsky B. Berman H.M. Structure (Lond.). 1995; 3: 893-906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar, 20Bella J. Eaton M. Brodsky B. Berman H.M. Science. 1994; 266: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). Jenkins and Raines (21Jenkins C.L. Raines R.T. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2002; 19: 49-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) suggested an alternative stereoelectronic mechanism of Hyp stabilization due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the hydroxyl group. The electron withdrawal favors an exo-pyrrolidine ring pucker, and recent x-ray studies on collagen-like peptides show that the exo/up-pucker of the imide ring in the X′aa position is favorable for the triple helix (22Vitagliano L. Berisio R. Mazzarella L. Zagari A. Biopolymers. 2001; 58: 459-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Prolyl hydroxylase is considered to be present only in multicellular organisms, although a recent report indicates its presence in the yeast Hansenula polymorpha (23de Bruin E.C. Werten M.W. Laane C. de Wolf F.A. FEMS Yeast Res. 2002; 1: 291-298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Bacteria lack this enzyme and cannot post-translationally modify Pro in the X′aa position of the (Gly-Xaa-X′aa)n sequence to form Hyp. Despite the absence of Hyp, several expressed bacterial proteins with collagen-like sequences have been shown to form stable triple-helix structures (24Boydston J.A. Chen P. Steichen C.T.

Some of the best characterized bacterial collagen-like proteins are the streptococcal collagen-like proteins Scl1 and Scl2, which are expressed on the cell surface of group A Streptococcus (26Xu Y.

Structurally, the extracellular portions of Scl proteins consist of an N-terminal globular domain (also known as the variable domain) attached to a rod-shaped collagen-like domain (28Lukomski S. Nakashima K. Abdi I. Cipriano V.J. Shelvin B.J. Graviss E.A. Musser J.M. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 1729-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Although the function of Scl proteins is not known, they have been reported to be involved in the adherence of Streptococcus pyogenes to human cells and tissues (27Lukomski S. Nakashima K. Abdi I. Cipriano V.J. Ireland R.M. Reid S.D. Adams G.G. Musser J.M. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 6542-6553Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 29Rasmussen M. Bjorck L. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 1427-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). One member of the Scl family interacts with α2β1 integrin to promote cell adhesion and intracellular signaling (32Humtsoe J.O. Kim J.K. Xu Y. Keene D.R. Hook M. Lukomski S. Wary K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13848-13857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), indicating that bacterial collagen-like proteins show functional as well as structural similarities to human collagens. CD spectroscopy, rotary shadowing electron microscopy, and enzymatic digestion studies indicate that recombinant Scl1 and Scl2 proteins adopt a stable collagen triple-helix structure (26Xu Y. Keene D.R. Bujnicki J.M. Hook M. Lukomski S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27312-27318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). To explore the basis of bacterial collagen triple-helix stability in the absence of Hyp, biophysical studies were carried out on recombinant Scl2, its isolated collagen domain, and a set of peptides modeling the highly charged region of this protein. The results indicate that ion pairs play a major role in stabilizing the Scl2 triple helix and that enthalpic stabilization, likely to involve interactions of polar groups with an ordered hydration network, also makes an important contribution. Protein Expression and Purification—The fragment of the scl2.28 allele (Q8RLX7) encoding the combined globular and collagen-like portions of the Scl2.28 protein (p163 clone) (26Xu Y. Keene D.R. Bujnicki J.M. Hook M. Lukomski S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27312-27318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) was recloned into the Escherichia coli vector pColdIII (33Qing G. Ma L.C. Khorchid A. Swapna G.V. Mal T.K. Takayama M.M. Xia B. Phadtare S. Ke H. Acton T. Montelione G.T. Ikura M. Inouye M. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 877-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), and recombinant protein was expressed in the BL21 strain. Cells were grown in M9-casamino acid medium until they reached A600 = 0.8. The cultures were shifted to a 15 °C water bath, and 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to induce protein expression. After overnight incubation, cells were harvested by centrifugation and disrupted by a French press. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation. The expressed p163 protein was found in the supernatant as a soluble protein. The p163 protein product (recombinant Scl2 (rScl2) 2The abbreviations used are: rScl2, recombinant Scl2; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; rScl2-CL, rScl2 collagen-like domain; DSC, differential scanning calorimetry; DLS, dynamic light scattering; MRE, mean residue ellipticity; deg, degrees. protein) was precipitated by 35% ammonium sulfate. The pellet was dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (20 mm sodium phosphate and 150 mm NaCl (pH 7.0)) and loaded onto a Sephacryl S-100 HR gel filtration column (GE Healthcare). The fractions containing rScl2 were dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 1 mm EDTA and 5% glycerol and further purified using a DEAE-Sephadex anion exchange column. Protein purity was checked by SDS-PAGE and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, and protein concentration was determined using an extinction coefficient of ϵ280 nm = 13,980 m–1 cm–1 (34Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5073) Google Scholar). For all later experiments, the protein was dialyzed into either phosphate-buffered saline or glycine buffer (20 mm glycine and 150 mm NaCl (pH 2 or 2.8)). Trypsin Digestion of rScl2—To obtain the collagenous fragment, 1.4 mg of the rScl2 protein was digested with 150 μgof trypsin. The digested product was loaded onto a Sephacryl S-100 HR gel filtration column. The purity of the fractions was checked by mass spectrometry. Mass spectrometry of the digested product (the rScl2 collagen-like domain (rScl2-CL)) showed a heterogeneous product containing slightly different lengths of the collagen domain. A major peak seen at 22,385 Da represents the expected (Gly-Xaa-X′aa)79 molecular mass of the complete collagen-like domain, whereas a second peak seen at 20,570 Da represents (Gly-Xaa-X′aa)72; several minor peaks were also observed with molecular masses between those of these two major peaks. Peptides—Peptide Ac-(GPO)3GKDGKD(GPO)3GY-CONH2 (where “O” is Hyp), denoted as the GKDGKD peptide, and peptide Ac-(GPO)3GKDGKDGQNGKDGPL(GPO)4GY-CONH2, denoted as the Scl2 repeat peptide, were synthesized by the Tufts University Core Facility (Boston, MA). The peptide sequence differs in one tripeptide unit (GPL versus GLP) from the Scl2 repeat sequence, but the charges are unchanged, and the stability is expected to differ by 2 °C. The peptides include a Tyr at the C terminus for concentration determination using the molar extinction coefficient ϵ = 1400 m–1 cm–1 at 275 nm on a Beckman Model DU640 spectrophotometer. Peptides were purified on a Shimadzu reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography system, and the identity of the peptides was confirmed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—CD spectra were recorded on an AVIV Model 62DS spectropolarimeter. Cuvettes with 0.2-mm path lengths were used to measure spectra down to 190 nm. For measurements between 210 and 260 nm, 1-mm path lengths were used. The temperature of the cells was controlled using a Peltier temperature controller. Protein solutions were equilibrated for at least 24 h at 4 °C before measurements. Wavelength scans were collected in 0.5-nm steps with a 4-s averaging time and repeated three times. For temperature-induced denaturation, the ellipticity was monitored as a function of temperature using wavelength maxima of 220 nm for the expressed proteins and 225 nm for the peptides. For thermal transitions of rScl2 and rScl2-CL, samples were equilibrated at each temperature for at least 5 min, and the transitions were at or close to equilibrium. The peptide melting curves were obtained under standard conditions used in our laboratory for comparison, even though equilibrium was not fully reached (35Persikov A.V. Xu Y. Brodsky B. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 893-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Peptides were equilibrated for 2 min at each temperature, and the temperature was increased at an average rate of 0.1 °C/min. The data were fit assuming the trimer-to-monomer model T → 3M, which showed good agreement. The Tm was determined as the temperature at which the fraction folded was equal to 0.5 in the curve fitted to the trimer-to-monomer transition. The Tm was determined with an accuracy of ±0.5 °C. Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC)—DSC experiments were recorded on a NANO DSC II Model 6100 (Calorimetry Sciences Corp.). The sample was dialyzed against either phosphate-buffered saline or glycine buffer and equilibrated at 5 °C for at least 24 h. Sample solutions were loaded at 5 °C into the cell and heated at a rate of 1 °C/min. The enthalpy was calculated from the first scan because the scans were not reversible upon cooling. Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS)—DLS was carried out on a DynaPro Titan instrument (Wyatt Technology Corp.). The instrument calculates the intensity-intensity autocorrelation function (g(τ)) from the scattered light at an angle of 90°. The translational diffusion coefficient was obtained from g(τ) and converted into the Stokes radius (RS) via the Stokes-Einstein equation: RS = kBT/(6π ηD), where kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, η is the solvent viscosity, and D the translational diffusion coefficient. Samples were filtered through 100-nm pore size filters before measurement. For each measurement, the sample was equilibrated at the relevant temperature for 5 min. The data were fit assuming the trimer-to-monomer model T → 3M. The Tm was determined with an accuracy of ±1 °C. Fluorescence—Fluorescence measurements were done on an Aminco-Bowman Series 2 luminescence spectrometer with a protein concentration of 0.1 mg/ml. The excitation wavelength was 295 nm, and the emission signal was measured at 340 nm. The excitation and emission slit widths were 4 nm. The protein was heated at a heating rate of 0.16 °C/min, and the signal was measured every 0.2 min. The data were fit assuming the trimer-to-monomer model T → 3M. The Tm was determined with an accuracy of ±0.2 °C. Collagen Stability Calculations—Predictions of Tm values for peptides and of the relative stability along a collagen molecule were based on the algorithm derived from host-guest peptides (36Persikov A.V. Ramshaw J.A. Brodsky B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19343-19349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The pH-dependent changes in the stability contributions of charged tripeptide sequences such as GKD were based on previously published data (37Chan V.C. Ramshaw J.A. Kirkpatrick A. Beck K. Brodsky B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31441-31446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Stability of rScl2 and Its Trypsin-resistant Collagenous Domain, rScl2-CL—A protein was expressed from a clone of the S. pyogenes collagen-like protein Scl2.28 variant (denoted here as Scl2) containing the N-terminal globular region (74 residues), the (Gly-Xaa-X′aa)79 triple-helix domain, a short Prorich sequence (17 residues), and the C-terminal 8-residue Strep-tag II protein (28Lukomski S. Nakashima K. Abdi I. Cipriano V.J. Shelvin B.J. Graviss E.A. Musser J.M. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 1729-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1a); this protein is referred to as rScl2. The rScl2 product was expressed in the cold-shock vector pColdIII in E. coli (33Qing G. Ma L.C. Khorchid A. Swapna G.V. Mal T.K. Takayama M.M. Xia B. Phadtare S. Ke H. Acton T. Montelione G.T. Ikura M. Inouye M. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 877-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) and purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by gel filtration chromatography and anion exchange chromatography. The purity was determined by SDS-PAGE, and the identity was confirmed by mass spectroscopy. Because the collagen triple helix is known to be resistant to trypsin, the rScl2 product was treated with trypsin at pH 7 for 1 h at room temperature to isolate the collagenous domain of this protein. The trypsin-digested product (designated rScl2-CL) contained the intact (Gly-Xaa-X′aa)79 region and a significant amount of (Gly-Xaa-X′aa)72 as detected by mass spectroscopy. The CD spectra of the rScl2 protein at pH 7 showed a maximum near 220 nm (MRE220 =+1200 degrees (deg)·cm2·dmol–1) and a minimum near 200 nm (MRE200 = –45,000 deg·cm2·dmol–1) (Fig. 1b). The positions of the maximum and minimum are typical of the collagen triple helix, but with lower magnitudes. The isolated collagen domain (rScl2-CL) had similar CD features, but with much larger magnitudes (MRE220 =+7400 deg·cm2·dmol–1 and MRE198 =–66,000 deg·cm2·dmol–1), giving values similar to those seen for mammalian collagens (38Brodsky-Doyle B. Leonard K.R. Reid K.B. Biochem. J. 1976; 159: 279-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Subtraction of the CD spectrum of the collagenous domain from that of total rScl2 suggests that the globular domain has a negative contribution at 220 nm and a positive contribution at 197 nm, indicating the possibility of β-sheet or α-helix contributions. Secondary structure programs (e.g. NNPREDICT, www.cmpharm.ucsf.edu/~nomi/nnpredict.html) predicted that 46 residues or 62% of the globular domain can adopt an α-helical conformation, which would be consistent with the subtracted CD curve and with earlier structure analysis (26Xu Y. Keene D.R. Bujnicki J.M. Hook M. Lukomski S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27312-27318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The program COILS (www.ch.embnet.org/software/COILS_form.html) predicts a high coiled-coil propensity for residues 1–15 and 43–60, consistent with the observation that coiled-coil domains are often found adjacent to triple helices and may fill a nucleating role (39McAlinden A. Smith T.A. Sandell L.J. Ficheux D. Parry D.A. Hulmes D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42200-42207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Monitoring the change in CD ellipticity at 220 nm for rScl2 at pH 7 with increasing temperature gave a very sharp thermal transition with a Tm of 36 °C (Fig. 1b). rScl2-CL showed a similar sharp transition at 36 °C. The absence of a second independent thermal transition in rScl2 suggests that the non-collagenous globular domain unfolds at the same time as the triple helix in a highly cooperative transition under these conditions. This is consistent with the Trp fluorescence monitored as a function of temperature at neutral pH, which showed a single transition at 36 °C (Fig. 1c). It is likely the fluorescence arises from Trp60 in the globular region because the only other Trp is located in the unstructured C-terminal Strep-tag II sequence and is not expected to show any change with temperature. Conformational properties and thermal stability were also investigated using DLS (Fig. 1d). Both rScl2 and rScl2-CL showed a significant decrease in the hydrodynamic radius with increasing temperature. For rScl2, the Stokes radius changed from 10.4 to 4.6 nm at 36–37 °C, whereas for rScl2-CL, it decreased from 8.0 to 3.6 nm at 34–35 °C. The temperature-dependent changes in the hydrodynamic radius, together with a decrease in intensity (data not shown) upon unfolding, confirm that these molecules are undergoing a thermal transition from native trimers to unfolded monomers. The larger hydrodynamic radius for the native rScl2 protein (10.4 nm) compared with that for the rScl2-CL protein (8.0 nm) likely reflects the effect of the globular domain on the molecular shape. DSC of the rScl2 protein at pH 7 exhibited a single very sharp transition at 37 °C, with a calorimetric enthalpy of ΔHcal = 3499 kJ/mol (Fig. 2a and Table 1). rScl2-CL showed a somewhat broader transition at the same temperature, with a small shoulder that is likely due to some heterogeneity in the digestion products (Fig. 2b). The calorimetric enthalpy of rScl2-CL was ΔHcal = 3400 kJ/mol assuming an intact (Gly-Xaa-X′aa)79 collagen domain of 22,385 Da. The enthalpy/tripeptide for the bacterial collagen domain was 12.5 kJ/mol of tripeptide or 4.2 kJ/residue.TABLE 1Thermal stability determined by CD spectroscopy, fluorescence, DLS, and DSC for the rScl2 protein and its collagenous domain (rScl2-CL) at pH 7 and 2.2ProteinCD TmFluorescence TmDLS Tm at pH 7DSC TmΔHcalpH 7pH 2.2pH 7pH 2.2pH 7pH 2.2pH 7pH 2.2°C°C°C°CkJ/molrScl235.624.236.526.536.43724.2, 2834992827aSum of two peaks.rScl2-CL35.925.7NAbNA, no aromatic residues in the triple-helix domain.NA34.436.123.7, 2734002427aSum of two peaks.a Sum of two peaks.b NA, no aromatic residues in the triple-helix domain. Open table in a new tab Following heat denaturation, incubation of rScl2 at low temperature (neutral pH, 5 °C, 0.8 mg/ml) led to rapid refolding, resulting in the native CD signal regained within the dead time (1–2 min), whereas incubation at 20 °C led to refolding within minutes. In contrast, rScl2-CL alone showed no indication of refolding, even after 1 week at 0 °C. This is consistent with a previous report of the necessity of the N-terminal globular domain for formation of triple helices (26Xu Y. Keene D.R. Bujnicki J.M. Hook M. Lukomski S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27312-27318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Effect of pH on Stability—The collagenous region of Scl2 contains a high proportion of charged residues, with ∼30% of the (Gly-Xaa-X′aa)79 sequence occupied by Asp, Glu, Lys, and Arg. The effects of pH on the stability and conformation of rScl2 and its isolated collagenous domain were characterized. The CD spectrum of the rScl2 protein showed a significant drop in the 220 nm peak at pH 2.2 (data not shown) compared with pH 7 (MRE220 =+1200 deg·cm2·dmol–1 at pH 7 and MRE220 = –1252 deg·cm2·dmol–1 at pH 2.2). A dramatic decrease in MRE220 was seen for rScl2-CL, from +7000 deg·cm2·dmol–1 at pH 7 to +2000 at pH 2.2 (Fig. 3, inset). The decrease in the characteristic triple-helix 220 nm CD signal at pH 2.2 indicates that the protonation and loss of negative charge on Glu and Asp residues lead to a significant loss of triple-helix content. Low pH also led to a significant decrease in triple-helix stability. The CD thermal transition at pH 2.2 showed a broad transition near 23–27 °C compared with the sharp 36 °C transition at pH 7 (Fig. 3). Although largely cooperative melting behavior was seen for the globular and triple-helix domains of rScl2 at a neutral pH value, in some cases, there was an indication that the globular domain unfolded slightly after unfolding of the triple helix. For instance, at pH 5, monitoring the 220 nm ellipticity as a function of temperature showed a sharp decrease at 36 °C, followed by a small increasing"
https://openalex.org/W2035384780,"C. elegans RPM-1 (for Regulator of Presynaptic Morphology) is a member of a conserved protein family that includes Drosophila Highwire and mammalian Pam and Phr1. These are large proteins recently shown to regulate synaptogenesis through E3 ubiquitin ligase activities. Here, we report the identification of an RCC1-like guanine nucleotide exchange factor, GLO-4, from mass spectrometry analysis of RPM-1-associated proteins. GLO-4 colocalizes with RPM-1 at presynaptic terminals. Loss of function in glo-4 or in its target Rab GTPase, glo-1, causes neuronal defects resembling those in rpm-1 mutants. We show that the glo pathway functions downstream of rpm-1 and acts in parallel to fsn-1, a partner of RPM-1 E3 ligase function. We find that late endosomes are specifically disorganized at the presynaptic terminals of glo-4 mutants. Our data suggest that RPM-1 positively regulates a Rab GTPase pathway to promote vesicular trafficking via late endosomes."

Our results provide molecular evidence for both spatial patterning and retrograde regulation of gene expression in sensory neurons during the development of the somatosensory map. In all vertebrate species, somatic stimuli from the face are transmitted to the somatosensory centers in the central nervous system (CNS) by the conserved trigeminal sensory neurons. In rodent, from the trigeminal ganglion, three distinct peripheral axon bundles are formed to innervate three primary regions of the face: ophthalmic, maxillary, and mandibular areas (Figure 1A and also Waite and Tracey, 1995Waite P.M.E. Tracey D.J. Trigeminal sensory system.in: Paxinos G. The Rat Nervous System. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1995: 705-724Google Scholar). Newly born trigeminal neurons immediately choose one of the three pathways to extend a peripheral axon while simultaneously projecting a central axon into the brainstem (O'Connor and Tessier-Lavigne, 1999O'Connor R. Tessier-Lavigne M. Identification of maxillary factor, a maxillary process-derived chemoattractant for developing trigeminal sensory axons.Neuron. 1999; 24: 165-178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Later, the central axons sprout out interstitial axonal collaterals that project into several brainstem nuclei, generating a set of inverted somatotopic maps representing the face inside the brain (Figure 1E and also Waite and Tracey, 1995Waite P.M.E. Tracey D.J. Trigeminal sensory system.in: Paxinos G. The Rat Nervous System. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1995: 705-724Google Scholar). Within the maxillary region of the ganglion, a population of neurons sends peripheral axons to innervate the whiskers on the face. Their central axons in turn form modular synapses known as “barrelette” structures that represent individual whiskers. Notably, the pattern and number of whiskers on the face are precisely replicated by barrelettes in the brainstem, with a one-barrelette-one-whisker relationship (Figure 1E, also reviewed by Killackey et al., 1995Killackey H.P.

However, the molecular mechanisms employed by trigeminal neurons to transform the spatial information of the face into spatial maps within the brain are largely unknown. Previous studies of somatic sensory neurons resided in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) have revealed that there are specific transcription programs regulating distinct aspects of neuronal development and differentiation, including the early specification of sensory lineage (Anderson, 1999Anderson D.J.

However, whether there are also transcription factors that specify the positional identities of DRG neurons with regard to their body targets is currently unknown. Another interesting aspect of somatosensory neuron development is the influence of target-derived signals on their differentiation and maturation. For example, periphery-derived neurotrophins are not only essential for the survival of DRG neurons (Ginty and Segal, 2002Ginty D.D. Segal R.A. Retrograde neurotrophin signaling: Trk-ing along the axon.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2002; 12: 268-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), but also for their axonal innervation of the skin (Patel et al., 2000Patel T.D. Jackman A. Rice F.L. Kucera J. Snider W.D.

Gomes W.A. Samanta J. Gupta M. Rice F.L. Kessler J.A. Target-derived BMP signaling limits sensory neuron number and the extent of peripheral innervation in vivo.Development. 2004; 131: 1175-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Thus, retrograde signaling from targets to cell bodies plays important roles in sensory neuron development. But whether peripheral targets can also retrogradely specify the positional identities of sensory neurons is unknown. To begin to understand the question of spatial patterning in the trigeminal ganglia, we first performed microarray gene expression analyses on neurons projecting to the three distinct areas of the face. We identified a set of genes that are differentially expressed along the dorsoventral axis of the trigeminal ganglion and thus can roughly be considered as positional identity markers. Using these tools, we obtained evidence for target-derived influences on the positional patterning of these neurons and identified some of the molecular components of this retrograde specification mechanism. In initial experiments, we placed two lipophilic dyes (DiI and DiA) individually into each of the developing target regions of the three trigeminal nerves in fixed E10.5 mouse embryos (Figure 1B). This permitted the retrograde labeling of neuronal cell bodies within the ganglion. We found that trigeminal neurons projecting into the three peripheral branches are spatially segregated into three distinct groups along the dorsoventral axis of the ganglion: (1) a relatively small, dorsal-most domain of ophthalmic projecting neurons; (2) a large middle region corresponding to neurons projecting into the maxillary arch; and (3) a ventral division of mandibular-innervating neurons (Figure 1C). Moreover, the main central axons are also organized into three ordered parallel tracks (Figure 1D). Thus, there is an early somatotopic organization of both the neuronal bodies and the major axonal tracks in the trigeminal system. This finding is consistent with previous studies in various species (Beaudreau and Jerge, 1968Beaudreau D.E. Jerge C.R.

Oral Biol. 1968; 13: 247-256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, Borsook et al., 2003Borsook D. DaSilva A.F. Ploghaus A. Becerra L.

Atkinson M.E. Compartmentalisation of the developing trigeminal ganglion into maxillary and mandibular divisions does not depend on target contact.J. Anat. 1999; 195: 137-145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The segregation allowed us to obtain neurons projecting to distinct facial areas (ophthalmic, maxillary, and mandibular neurons) by microdissecting 500 E11.5 trigeminal ganglia (TG) and comparing gene expression patterns among them by genome-wide analysis. In this way, we identified a set of molecular markers that exhibit distinct spatial patterns of expression within the E11.5 TG. We focused on four transcription factors for further analyses as described below. (Details of the microarray studies and the list of genes confirmed by in situ hybridization experiments can be found in Supplemental Experimental Procedures and Table S1 in theSupplemental Data available with this article online). At E11.5 (Figure 1G), the gene encoding Tbx3, a T box family transcription factor (Coll et al., 2002Coll M. Seidman J.G. Muller C.W.

The gene encoding Onecut2 (OC2), a cut-domain-containing homeobox transcription factor (Jacquemin et al., 1999Jacquemin P. Lannoy V.J. Rousseau G.G. Lemaigre F.P.

Patterns. 2003; 3: 639-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) shows differential levels of expression along the dorsoventral axis: it is expressed strongly in the ventral half of the maxillary TG and in the majority of the mandibular neurons, but weakly in the ophthalmic and the dorsal half of the maxillary regions. The expression of Onecut1 (OC1, also called HNF6), a gene encoding another cut homeobox protein (Clotman et al., 2002Clotman F. Lannoy V.J. Reber M. Cereghini S. Cassiman D. Jacquemin P. Roskams T.

Biol. 2003; 258: 105-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), is primarily limited to mandibular neurons and is also transcribed in a narrow, most ventral stripe of the maxillary TG at this age. Finally, Hmx1, a homeobox factor (Adamska et al., 2001Adamska M. Wolff A. Kreusler M. Wittbrodt J. Braun T. Bober E. Five Nkx5 genes show differential expression patterns in anlagen of sensory organs in medaka: insight into the evolution of the gene family.Dev. Genes Evol. 2001; 211: 338-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) shows specific expression in mandibular region. We next addressed when TG neurons acquire these position-dependent differences in gene expression. At E10.5 when the TG axon outgrowth has just initiated (Figure 1F), the spatial patterns are not identical to those seen at E11.5. Strong Tbx3 is seen in fewer scattered cells, with a low-level expression throughout the TG. OC2 is uniformly expressed in the ganglia at this stage. The expression of OC1 is less restricted compared to that typically observed at E11.5. It extends into the dorsal part of the ganglion. Only Hmx1 shows the same mandibular restricted pattern as in the E11.5 embryo. Thus, it appears that the expression patterns of Tbx3, OC2, and OC1 change as the trigeminal axons grow into their peripheral targets from E10.5 to E11.5. We also examined TG at E12.5 and E16.5 and found that the expression patterns of the four transcription factors are largely similar to those at E11.5, with the level of OC2 further reduced in the dorsal region of the TG (Figure 1H for E12.5 and data not shown for E16.5). Having observed positional differences between trigeminal sensory neurons in vivo, we asked whether these identities are intrinsic and cell autonomously sustained in these neurons or whether their acquisition or maintenance requires extrinsic signals. To assess this, we cultured trigeminal ganglia isolated from E11.5 embryos in vitro for 16–24 hr either in media alone or in media supplemented with neurotrophins (NTs). In media alone, these transcription factors are either not expressed (Tbx3 and Hmx1) or weakly expressed (OC2 and OC1) in trigeminal neurons (Table 1, first column, and data not shown). This is not a result of cell death because TG isolated from Bax−/− embryos, in which neuronal apoptosis is prevented, gave essentially the same results (data not shown). Furthermore, we performed anti-NeuN staining (which detects all postmitotic neurons) together with TUNEL staining (which reveals apoptotic cells), and found that although there is cell death, only less than 1% of the TUNEL positive cells are also NeuN positive (Figure S1). This indicates that all the live neurons under this culture condition do not express appreciable levels of the transcription factors. Thus, the positional differences in gene expression observed in vivo are not stable intrinsic properties of trigeminal neurons since they cannot be maintained in culture.Table 1Quantification of Trigeminal Ganglia Culture ExperimentsMedium AloneWith BMP4With NTsWith NTs Plus BMP4% of NeuN-positive cells expressing the markerTbx3ND39.6% ± 1.5%ND89.2% ± 1.5%OC2NDND92.4% ± 2.0%96.4% ± 0.7%OC1NDND95.6% ± 2.0%71.1% ± 4.5%Hmx1NDND18.7% ± 1.2%21.3% ± 1.2%bOnly the cells strongly express Hmx1 are counted.Spatial distribution index (Id/Iv ratio)Tbx3ND1.05 ± 0.20ND1.24 ± 0.09 (p = 0.11)OC2NDND1.13 ± 0.280.76 ± 0.09 (p = 0.18)OC1NDND0.93 ± 0.080.48 ± 0.05∗∗Hmx1NDND1.26 ± 0.540.25 ± 0.03∗∗Relative highest signal IntensityTbx31.0% ± 5.7%81.8% ± 3.1%10.1% ± 3.7%100% ± 1.3%∗∗OC221.4% ± 4.1%26.6% ± 7.0%100% ± 2.9%47.6% ± 4.5%∗∗OC1aThe highest signal intensity for OC1 and for Hmx1 is in the mandibular region.43.9% ± 3.0%34.6% ± 2.3%100% ± 3.2%76.4% ± 3.9%∗∗Hmx1aThe highest signal intensity for OC1 and for Hmx1 is in the mandibular region.6.0% ± 7.9%1.0% ± 7.9%100% ± 10.8%88.4% ± 8.1%∗∗p < 0.01.

Details of quantification can be found in Supplemental Experimental Procedures. Next, we cultured TG in media supplemented with neurotrophins. Both NGF and NT3 were added since these two factors were shown to support the survival and growth of the majority of trigeminal neurons at this stage (Huang et al., 1999aHuang E.J. Wilkinson G.A. Farinas I. Backus C. Zang K. Wong S.L. Reichardt L.F.

Identification of maxillary factor, a maxillary process-derived chemoattractant for developing trigeminal sensory axons.Neuron. 1999; 24: 165-178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Again, less than 1% of NeuN-positive cells are also TUNEL positive (Figure S1). Interestingly, in the presence of NTs, most of the NeuN staining appears around the outer edge of the ganglion leaving the center barely stained. Perhaps axon outgrowth induced by the NTs caused the migration of the cell bodies to the edge. All quantifications of in situ results involve only NeuN-stained cells. An example for Tbx3 in situ hybridizaton and NeuN immunofluorescence on the same section is shown in Figure S2. In the presence of NTs, the expression of Tbx3 was still barely detectable, OC2 and OC1 were expressed at relatively high levels in more than 90% of neurons throughout the ganglion, and Hmx1 was detected in a small subset (20%) of trigeminal neurons scattered across the ganglion without any discernable spatial pattern (Figure 2A and Table 1, third column). These findings indicate that NTs are not sufficient to maintain Tbx3 expression but are necessary and sufficient to induce/maintain OC1 and OC2 expression. As to Hmx1 transcription, NTs are necessary but not sufficient for maintaining the spatially restricted expression pattern (also see below). Similar results were obtained for cultured E10.5 trigeminal ganglia (data not shown). To carefully examine whether there are any spatial differences in the expression of OC2, OC1, and Hmx1 induced by NTs, we compared the average in situ signal intensity (per unit area) in the dorsal one-third of the trigeminal ganglion (Id) to that in the ventral one-third of ganglion (Iv) and expressed the results as a ratio of Id/Iv (illustrated in Figure 2D). Ratios that deviate significantly from 1.0 are indicative of differential expression. No statistically significant differences were detected between dorsal and ventral trigeminal ganglion for these three genes in NT-treated cultures (Figure 2D and Table 1, third column). Thus, uniform application of NTs to TG neither maintains nor generates spatial differences of transcription factor expression among the TG divisions. Since the neurotrophins are equally expressed along the pathways and in target areas of the three trigeminal nerves during development (O'Connor and Tessier-Lavigne, 1999O'Connor R. Tessier-Lavigne M. Identification of maxillary factor, a maxillary process-derived chemoattractant for developing trigeminal sensory axons.Neuron. 1999; 24: 165-178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), it appears that extrinsic signals other than neurotrophins must be present in vivo for the induction or maintenance of Tbx3 expression, as well as for the suppression of neurotrophin-induced OC1, OC2, and Hmx1 in dorsal (ophthalmic and maxillary) TG neurons. In order to identify the “extrinsic factor(s),” we first cultured E10.5 trigeminal ganglia together with the eye, and the maxillary and mandibular arches, such that the peripheral axons of the trigeminal neurons were left intact in the developing facial tissues. We found that positional differences in the expression of the four transcription factors can be partially restored/maintained in such cocultures (Figure S3 and data not shown). This implies that the extrinsic signal(s) comes from the developing craniofacial targets. We took a candidate approach and tested whether sonic hedgehog (SHH), FGF8, retinoic acid, WNTs (by using GSK3 inhibitors), or BMP4 can affect the expression of the transcription factors. Only BMP4 had major effects (data not shown for negative results of other factors). In the TG cultures supplemented with both NTs and 20 ng/ml BMP4, we observed a dramatic increase in Tbx3 expression (Figure 2C), a significant reduction in NT-dependent OC2 and OC1 expression, and an apparent mandibular specific expression of Hmx1 (Figure 2C and Table 1). The strongest OC1-expressing cells also appear to be in the mandibular part of the cultured TG. Quantitative analyses (Table 1, fourth column) of the in situ signals comparing dorsal one-third versus ventral one-third of TG (Id/Iv) confirm our observation that OC1 (Id/Iv = 0.48) and Hmx1 (Id/Iv = 0.25) are more highly expressed in the ventral than in the dorsal region of the TG. Since the expression levels of these transcription factors are not uniform across the ganglia under this culture condition, for simplicity, we measured the maximum (i.e., the strongest) in situ intensities. We found that BMP4 plus NTs caused a 10-fold increase in the expression of Tbx3, a 50% reduction in the OC2, and a mild inhibition of OC1 and Hmx1 levels in the mandibular neurons (Table 1). BMP4 alone is sufficient to induce Tbx3 expression, although the level is weaker than that induced by BMP4 plus NTs (Figure 2B and Table 1, second column). Our results indicate that TG neurons have intrinsic differences that allow them to respond to extrinsic BMP4 differentially. Ophthalmic and maxillary neurons are very responsive to BMP4-mediated suppression of OC1 and Hmx1, while mandibular neurons are refractory to such suppression. On the other hand, BMP4 induces Tbx3 expression to similar levels in almost all TG neurons, suggesting that the intrinsic differences in responses to BMP signaling do not involve all genes but are specific to a specific subset. As a control for the specificity of BMP4, we found that neither BMP7 nor ActivinA at a concentration of 20 ng/ml had any obvious effect on the expression of these transcription factors (Figure S4 for BMP7 and data not shown for ActivinA). The results from the in vitro experiments with BMP4 prompted us to investigate the in vivo expression pattern of Bmp4 by utilizing the Bmp4LacZ mouse in which the LacZ gene is inserted into the Bmp4 locus as a reporter (Furuta and Hogan, 1998Furuta Y.

At E9.5, Bmp4 is expressed in the optic cup and in ectodermal tissues at the distal regions of the first branchial arch, which are not in contact with the ganglion (Figure S5A). At E10.5, comparing the whole-mount LacZ staining to the whole-mount neurofilament (NFM) staining of Bmp4LacZ embryos (littermates), it is apparent that at this stage, some ophthalmic and maxillary trigeminal axons are in contact with Bmp4 expressing cells, while mandibular axons are not (Figure 3A). For E11.5 embryos, we costained tissue sections with β-gal (for Bmp4) and anti-NFM antibodies (to reveal the trigeminal axons; Figure 3B). At this stage, Bmp4 is expressed in regions adjacent to the ophthalmic axons (Figure 3B1), and in the distal half of the maxillary arch into which many maxillary axons have grown (Figure 3B2). In the mandibular arch, Bmp4 is restricted to only the dorsal and distal-most ridges toward which only a small population of mandibular axons projects (Figure 3B3). The spatial distribution of Bmp4 mRNA puts BMP4 in an excellent position to induce Tbx3 and to suppress OC2, OC1, and Hmx1 transcription in the ophthalmic and the maxillary trigeminal neurons in early development. Other Bmp family members are either not expressed or weakly expressed (such as Bmp7) at these stages (Figure S5B and data not shown). A hallmark of canonical BMP4 signal transduction is the phosphorylation of Smad-family transcription factors, in particular Smad1/5/8 (Massague and Gomis, 2006Massague J. Gomis R.R. The logic of TGFbeta signaling.FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 2811-2820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar, Nohe et al., 2004Nohe A. Keating E. Knaus P. Petersen N.O. Signal transduction of bone morphogenetic protein receptors.Cell. Signal. 2004; 16: 291-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). We therefore performed anti-phosphoSmad1/5/8 staining (hereafter referred to as pSmad staining) in fixed embryos. pSmad-positive cells (nuclei) are located in the ophthalmic and dorsal maxillary domains of the TG (at E11), but not in the mandibular division (Figure 3C2). In situ hybridization of adjacent sections demonstrates that the Tbx3 pattern is almost identical to that of the pSmad staining (Figure 3C1). These results confirm the existence of position-dependent BMP signaling within the TG in vivo. They also suggest that Tbx3 is likely to be a direct transcriptional target of BMP signaling in neurons, a finding consistent with previous reports in other systems (Yang et al., 2006Yang L. Cai C.L.

https://openalex.org/W2170083890,"The amygdaloid complex consists of diverse nuclei that belong to distinct functional systems, yet many issues about its development are poorly understood. Here, we identify a stream of migrating cells that form specific amygdaloid nuclei in mice. In utero electroporation showed that this caudal amygdaloid stream (CAS) originated in a unique domain at the caudal telencephalic pole that is contiguous with the dorsal pallium, which was previously thought to generate only neocortical cells. The CAS and the neocortex share mechanisms for specification (transcription factors Tbr1, Lhx2 and Emx1/2) and migration (reelin and Cdk5). Reelin, a critical cue for migration in the neocortex, and Cdk5, which is specifically required for migration along radial glia in the neocortex, were both selectively required for the normal migration of the CAS, but not for that of other amygdaloid nuclei. This is first evidence of a dorsal pallial contribution to the amygdala, demonstrating a developmental and mechanistic link between the amygdala and the neocortex."
https://openalex.org/W1973704039,"Voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) convert electrical activity into calcium (Ca2+) signals that regulate cellular excitability, differentiation, and connectivity. The magnitude and kinetics of Ca2+ signals depend on the number of VGCCs at the plasma membrane, but little is known about the regulation of VGCC surface expression. We report that electrical activity causes internalization of the L-type Ca2+ channel (LTC) CaV1.2 and that this is mediated by binding to the tumor suppressor eIF3e/Int6 (eukaryotic initiation factor 3 subunit e). Using total internal reflection microscopy, we identify a population of CaV1.2 containing endosomes whose rapid trafficking is strongly regulated by Ca2+. We define a domain in the II-III loop of CaV1.2 that binds eIF3e and is essential for the activity dependence of both channel internalization and endosomal trafficking. These findings provide a mechanism for activity-dependent internalization and trafficking of CaV1.2 and provide a tantalizing link between Ca2+ homeostasis and a mammalian oncogene."

At a cyt P450:cyt b5 molar ratio of 1:1 under single turnover conditions, cyt P450 2B4 catalyzes the oxidation of the substrates, benzphetamine and cyclohexane, with rate constants of 18 ± 2 and 29 ± 4.5 s–1, respectively.

In marked contrast, at a cyt P450:CPR molar ratio of 1:1, cyt P450 2B4 catalyzes the oxidation of benzphetamine ≅100-fold (k = 0.15 ± 0.05 s–1) and cyclohexane ≅10-fold (k = 2.5 ± 0.35 s–1) more slowly.

Under steady-state conditions at all cyt b5:cyt P450 molar ratios examined, cyt b5 inhibits the rate of NADPH consumption. Nevertheless, at low cyt b5:cyt P450 molar ratios ≤1:1, the rate of metabolism of cyclohexane and benzphetamine is enhanced, whereas at higher cyt b5:cyt P450 molar ratios, cyt b5 progressively inhibits both NADPH consumption and the rate of metabolism. It is proposed that the ability of cyt b5 to enhance substrate metabolism by cyt P450 is related to its ability to increase the rate of catalysis and that the inhibitory properties of cyt b5 are because of its ability to occupy the reductase-binding site on cyt P450 2B4, thereby preventing reduction of ferric cyt P450 and initiation of the catalytic cycle.

P450 are a superfamily of heme-containing enzymes that catalyze the biotransformation of a large number of endogenous and xenobiotic compounds by utilizing reducing equivalents from NADPH. The mammalian hepatic microsomal cytochromes P450 receive electrons from their redox partner, NADPH-cyt P450 reductase (CPR). To be able to catalyze the oxidation of substrates, cyt P450 requires two electrons and two protons. Its catalytic cycle is complex with multiple steps (1Denisov I.G. Makris T.M. Sligar S.G. Schlichting I. Chem. Rev. 2005; 105: 2253-2277Crossref PubMed Scopus (1551) Google Scholar). The first step is the binding of substrate, which may increase the redox potential of the heme. CPR, not cyt b5, then delivers the first electron to reduce the ferric heme to the ferrous state. The ferrous iron binds oxygen to form the oxyferrous complex (Fe3+OO–), whose potential is high enough to accept a second electron from either CPR or cyt b5 to yield the peroxo intermediate (Fe3+OO2–). The peroxo intermediate is rapidly protonated (first proton) to form the hydroperoxo intermediate (Fe3+OOH–). A second proton is delivered to the distal oxygen, resulting in cleavage of the oxygen molecule to form water and the oxyferryl intermediate [FeIV = O], generally considered to be the active hydroxylating species. An atom of oxygen is inserted into the substrate, and product release follows.It has been recognized for 3 decades that under steady-state conditions, cyt b5 alters the rate of catalysis by selected cytochromes P450 (for recent reviews see Refs. 2Porter T.D.

Cyt b5 has been reported to affect the catalytic activity of more than 20 cyt P450 isoforms, including the majority of the human drug-metabolizing cyt P450 isoforms like cyt P450 3A4, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, and 2E1 (6Mokashi V.

Cyt b5 may enhance, inhibit, or not alter catalysis by microsomal cyt P450 depending on the specific cyt P450 isoform, the substrate, and the experimental conditions (10Gruenke L.D. Konopka K.

Dispos. 1984; 12: 358-364PubMed Google Scholar). It has been suggested that cyt b5 modulates cyt P450 catalysis by donating the second electron to cyt P450 and/or by acting as an allosteric modifier of the oxygenase (3Schenkman J.B. Jansson I. Pharmacol. Ther. 2003; 97: 139-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). In the case of cyt P450 2B4, it has been shown that the electron-donating properties of cyt b5 are required for its stimulatory activity (10Gruenke L.D. Konopka K. Cadieu M. Waskell L. J. Biol.

Its inhibitory properties, which are also manifest by manganese-protoporphyrin IX cyt b5, are likely related to its ability to displace CPR from its binding site on cyt P450 2B4 (11Morgan E.T. Coon M.J. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1984; 12: 358-364PubMed Google Scholar, 12Canova-Davis E. Waskell L. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2541-2546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Bridges A.

Recent experiments performed under single turnover conditions suggest that both the electron-donating ability and effector function of cyt b5 may be operating to enhance catalysis by cyt P450 2B4 (14Zhang H.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 11594-11603Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).It has also been reported that apo-cyt b5 devoid of heme can stimulate catalysis (9Yamazaki H. Nakamura M. Komatsu T.

Chem. 1998; 273: 3158-3165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). However, some investigators have disputed that apo-cyt b5 can stimulate cyt P450 catalysis (19Guryev O.L. Gilep A.A. Usanov S.A. Estabrook R.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5018-5031Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). These conflicting reports indicate that the mechanism by which cyt b5 affects the catalysis of cyt P450 remains poorly understood. Hildebrandt and Estabrook (20Hildebrandt A. Estabrook R.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1971; 143: 66-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar) proposed that cyt b5 functions by transferring one of the two reducing equivalents to cyt P450 based on the observation in microsomes that cyt b5 partially reoxidized upon the addition of NADH to a microsomal drug-metabolizing reaction under steady-state conditions. This proposal is supported by in vitro experiments demonstrating that ferrous cyt b5 is an efficient electron donor to oxyferrous cyt P450 (Fe3+OO–) (21Bonfils C. Balny C. Maurel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 9457-9465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Pompon D. Coon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 15377-15385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, stimulation of benzphetamine and methoxyflurane metabolism by cyt P450 2B4 is only observed in the presence of holo-cyt b5 but not in the presence of apo-cyt b5 or cyt b5 containing manganese protoporphyrin IX (11Morgan E.T. Coon M.J. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1984; 12: 358-364PubMed Google Scholar, 12Canova-Davis E. Waskell L. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2541-2546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Chlorzoxazone metabolism by cyt P450 2E1 is also stimulated by cyt b5, but not by apo-cyt b5, in a purified reconstituted system as well as in membranes in which cyt P450 2E1 and CPR have been coexpressed (8Yamazaki H. Gillam E.M. Dong M.S. Johnson W.W. Guengerich F.P. Shimada T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 342: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 9Yamazaki H. Nakamura M. Komatsu T. Ohyama K.

These results are supportive of an electron transfer role for cyt b5 in cyt P450 catalysis. Stimulation of cyt P450 activity was originally attributed to more rapid electron transfer to oxyferrous cyt P450 by cyt b5 than CPR. However, data from our laboratory have recently demonstrated that cyt b5 and CPR reduce cyt P450 at a similar rate but that catalysis nevertheless occurs more slowly in the presence of reductase (14Zhang H. Gruenke L. Arscott D. Harris D.L. Glavanovich M. Johnson R. Waskell L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 11594-11603Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Presumably, oxyferrous cyt P450 exists in different conformations in the presence of cyt b5 and CPR.Attempts to characterize the interaction of cyt P450 at the individual steps in its reaction cycle with its amphipathic redox partners have been extremely challenging because membrane-binding proteins form heterogeneous aggregates between and among themselves in aqueous solution. It is also likely that cyt P450 changes conformation during its reaction cycle and that its various conformations may react differently with cyt b5 and CPR (23French J.S. Guengerich F.P. Coon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4112-4119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cyt P450 2B4 forms a 1:1 complex with CPR and with cyt b5 in reconstituted systems. The binding of the redox partner is enhanced in the presence of substrates, and substrates enhance the affinity for the redox partner (21Bonfils C. Balny C. Maurel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 9457-9465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23French J.S. Guengerich F.P. Coon M.J. J. Biol.

A site-directed mutagenesis study of the interactions of cyt P450 2B4 with CPR and cyt b5 has identified residues, primarily in the C-helix on the proximal side of cyt P450 2B4, that participate in binding both CPR and cyt b5 (13Bridges A. Gruenke L. Chang Y.T. Vakser I.A. Loew G. Waskell L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17036-17049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). These data demonstrate that CPR and cyt b5 have nonidentical but nevertheless overlapping binding sites on the proximal surface of cyt P450 2B4 and predict that cyt b5 and CPR will compete for this binding site on cyt P450. Model complexes of cyt P450 2B4 with cyt b5 and CPR also support the hypothesis of an overlapping binding site (4Zhang H. Myshkin E. Waskell L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 338: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). On the contrary, Schenkman and co-workers (26Tamburini P.P. Schenkman J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) have proposed a ternary complex of cyt P450, cyt b5, and CPR based on the finding that a carbodiimide cross-linked cyt b5-cyt P450 2B4 complex was able to accept electrons from CPR for the metabolism of para-nitroanisole. The experiment with the cross-linked complex led to the conclusion that cyt b5 and CPR had distinct binding sites on cyt P450 2B4 and that it was possible for cyt P450, cyt b5, and CPR to form an active ternary complex. The experiments described in this work address this issue using a recently developed procedure that directly measures product formation from a single catalytic cycle of cyt P450 2B4. They also enable us to compare the rate of product formation with the rate of reduction of cyt P450 2B4 determined spectrophotometrically (14Zhang H. Gruenke L. Arscott D. Harris D.L. Glavanovich M. Johnson R. Waskell L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 11594-11603Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).In view of the complexity of the multistep reaction cycle of cyt P450, the fact that the first electron to the ferric cyt P450 can only be efficiently delivered by CPR, and the heterogeneously aggregated state of the three membrane proteins in the reconstituted system, we elected to bypass the early steps in the catalytic cycle and to examine product formation by oxyferrous cyt P450 2B4 under single turnover conditions. The ferric cyt P450 2B4 was stoichiometrically reduced by dithionite, eliminating the requirement for CPR for the delivery of the first electron. Catalysis was initiated by mixing the reduced cyt P450 complexes with an oxygen-containing solution. By directly measuring the rate at which product formation occurred during a single catalytic cycle, it was possible to determine whether cyt b5 or CPR was responsible for catalysis. These experimental conditions circumvent many of the problems associated with investigating enzymatic activity under steady-state conditions and enabled us to show that increasing the concentration of cyt b5 leads to more catalysis by cyt b5 at the expense of catalysis by CPR. The data were interpreted to indicate that cyt b5 and CPR are competing for a mutually exclusive binding site on cyt P450 2B4.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESChemicals—All chemicals used are of ACS grade unless otherwise specified. Cyclohexane, cyclohexanol-d12, NADPH, benzphetamine, and sodium dithionite were purchased from Sigma. Dilauroylphosphatidyl-choline (DLPC) was purchased from Doosan Serdary Research Laboratory (Toronto, Canada).Protein Expression and Purification—The membrane-bound forms of cyt P450 2B4, rabbit cyt b5, and rat CPR were expressed and purified from E. coli as described previously (14Zhang H. Gruenke L. Arscott D. Harris D.L. Glavanovich M. Johnson R. Waskell L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 11594-11603Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The concentration of cyt P450 was determined using an extinction coefficient of Δϵ450–490 nm of 91 mm–1 cm–1 for the cyt P450-CO complex, as described by Omura and Sato (27Omura T. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2379-2385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration of CPR was determined using an extinction coefficient of 21 mm–1 cm–1 at 456 nm for oxidized enzyme (28Vermilion J.L. Coon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 2694-2704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration of cyt b5 was determined using an extinction coefficient of 185 mm–1 cm–1 for the absorbance change at 426 minus 409 nm between ferrous and ferric cyt b5, respectively (29Estabrook R.W. Werringloer J. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 52: 212-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar).Determination of the Rate of Product Formation under Single Turnover Conditions in a Rapid Chemical Quench Apparatus—Measurements of the kinetics of product formation were performed on a QFM-400 chemical quench flow apparatus (Molecular Kinetics, Inc., Indianapolis, IN). The QFM-400 apparatus was housed in an anaerobic chamber (Coy Laboratory Products Inc., Ann Arbor, MI), where the oxygen level was maintained at ∼5 ppm. The temperature of the reaction chamber of the QFM-400 apparatus was maintained with a circulating water bath.The complexes of cyt P450 with its redox partners were preformed by incubating cyt P450 with either CPR or cyt b5 or both overnight at ∼4 °C in an anaerobic chamber in Buffer A (0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 15% glycerol). The overnight incubation prevents precipitation and ensures the sample is anaerobic. DLPC was included in the protein mixture at a molar ratio of DLPC:cyt P450 of 60:1. Methyl viologen was present at a concentration of 0.1 μm. The substrate of cyt P450, either cyclohexane or benzphetamine, was added to a final concentration of 1 mm. Cyclohexane was added from a stock of methanolic solution, and the methanol concentration in the reaction mixture was ≤0.25% (v/v). The cyt P450-cyt b5 complex was reduced stoichiometrically in a tonometer under anaerobic conditions, using a standardized solution of dithionite. The reduction was monitored by following absorbance changes at 422 and 438 nm for cyt b5 and cyt P450, respectively. Likewise, the cyt P450-CPR complex was reduced with dithionite, and the reduction was monitored at 585 and 385 nm for CPR and cyt P450, respectively. The cyt P450-cyt b5 complex was reduced to a ferrous state (cyt P4502+ and cyt b 2+5), whereas the cyt P450-CPR complex was reduced by 3-electron equivalents (ferrous cyt P450 and 2e-reduced CPR). When all three proteins were present, the preformed complexes were reduced with 4-electron equivalents to ferrous cyt P450, ferrous cyt b5, and 2e-reduced CPR.The reduced protein complex was loaded into Syringe A of the chemical quench flow apparatus inside the anaerobic chamber. With cyclohexane as the substrate, the protein concentration in Syringe A was 10–15 μm for the cyt P450-cyt b5 complex and 15 μm for the cyt P450-CPR complex. The concentration of the cyt P450-cyt b5 and cyt P450-CPR complex was 30 μm when benzphetamine was used as substrate. Syringe B contained air-saturated Buffer A and 1 mm substrate. The reaction was initiated by mixing the contents of Syringe A (containing the reduced proteins) with an equal volume from Syringe B (containing substrate and air-saturated Buffer A ([O2] =∼250 μm). At designated times the reaction was rapidly quenched with an equal volume of 1 m NaOH. The reaction temperature was 30 °C with cyclohexane and 15 °C with benzphetamine. The last sample was collected ∼10 s after mixing in the presence of cyclohexane and at ∼60 s in the presence of benzphetamine. The sample at time = 0 was prepared by first mixing the reduced protein complex with 1 m NaOH to inactivate the enzymes and then adding air-saturated buffer. Typically 15–30 samples were collected during the time course of a reaction. The amount of cyclohexanol in each reaction mixture was quantified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), whereas the amount of norbenzphetamine was quantified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). The kinetics of product formation were determined from a plot of the amount of product formed versus time.Quantification of Cyclohexanol with Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS)—The amount of cyclohexanol produced by cyt P450 was quantified with a GC-MS method developed in this laboratory with a detection limit of 6 pmol at a signal-to-noise ratio of ≥3. At higher concentrations of cyclohexanol, the error was ±10–15%. Immediately after the reaction was quenched, it was spiked with 267 pmol of the internal standard, cyclohexanol-d12. The samples containing cyclohexanol and perdeuterated cyclohexanol were then extracted twice with 3 ml of dichloromethane. The extracts were concentrated with a stream of nitrogen to ∼1–5 μl and redissolved in 50 μl of methanol. Standard solutions containing known amounts of both the internal standard and cyclohexanol (6–500 pmol) were prepared and processed under the same conditions as the quenched unknown samples each time an experiment was performed. The only difference was that the proteins in the samples used for the standard curve had not been reduced by dithionite.Quantitative analysis was performed on an HP6890/MSD5893 GC-MS instrument (Agilent Technologies). A 2-μl aliquot of the methanolic solution containing cyclohexanol and cyclohexanol-d12 was injected at 250 °C in the pulse-splitless mode. Cyclohexanol and its perdeuterated analogue were chromatographed on a capillary DB-210 column (0.20 mm × 20 m × 0.18 μm; J & W Scientific) using helium as carrier gas. A deactivated fused silica guard column (0.2 mm × 10 m; Agilent Technologies) was placed in front of the capillary DB-210 column. Following injection of the samples, the oven temperature was maintained at 50 °C for 3 min and then increased to 100 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min. Both cyclohexanol and cyclohexanol-d12 eluted at ∼7.4 min. The mass spectrometer detector was operated in the selective ion monitoring mode with electronic ionization at 70 eV. In the selective ion monitoring mode, the intensities of only four ions were recorded, i.e. m/z 57 and 82 from fragmentation of cyclohexanol and m/z 61 and 92 from fragmentation of cyclohexanol-d12. Product was quantified by generating a standard curve with 6–500 pmol of cyclohexanol, using cyclohexanol-d12 as the internal standard. It gave rise to a straight line with R2 ≥ 0.98 in the range of calibration. The amount of cyclohexanol in the unknown samples was calculated by using the ratio of the area under the curve from the chromatogram of the selected ions at m/z 82 and m/z 92 based on the calibration curve performed on the same day.Quantification of Norbenzphetamine with LC-MS/MS—The amount of norbenzphetamine produced under single turnover conditions was quantified with an LC-MS/MS method developed in this laboratory. After the reaction was quenched with NaOH, 0.3 nmol of the internal standard, norbenzphetamine-d5, was spiked into each sample. Norbenzphetamine and norbenzphetamine-d5 were extracted twice with 3 ml of methyl-tert-butyl ether. The extracts were dried with a stream of nitrogen gas and redissolved in 0.4 ml of a solution of 50% acetonitrile, 50% H2O for LC-MS/MS analyses. An aliquot of 10 μl of the solution was injected into the LC-MS for quantification. Standard solutions containing a known amount of norbenzphetamine (0.02–5 nmol) and 0.3 nmol of norbenzphetamine-d5 were prepared under the same conditions as the quenched samples except that the protein complex was not reduced.LC-MS/MS analysis was performed on a Thermo Finnigan TSQ Quantum mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, MA). Norbenzphetamine was separated from benzphetamine on a Zorbax SB-C18 column (2.1 × 150 mm, 3.5 μm; Agilent Technologies). The column temperature was maintained at 35 °C. The mobile phase consisted of 100% acetonitrile (A) and 20 mm ammonium formate (B). The column was equilibrated with 50% A, 50% B for 6 min at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. Norbenzphetamine and norbenzphetamine-d5 were eluted with a linear gradient from 50% A, 50% B to 90% A, 10% B in 5 min, and the mobile phase was held at 90% A, 10% B for another 2 min. Norbenzphetamine and norbenzphetamine-d5 eluted at ∼3.2 min, whereas benzphetamine eluted at ∼4.3 min. It is of note that commercially available benzphetamine is contaminated with ≅0.01% norbenzphetamine that gives a background signal during LC-MS/MS analysis of the samples from the single turnover experiments. This background norbenzphetamine was quantified in the time = 0 sample and subtracted from the experimental samples. With a typical norbenzphetamine background ≅10 pmol of norbenzphetamine can be detected with a signal:noise ratio of 3.The mass spectrometer was operated in the selected reaction monitoring mode. Norbenzphetamine and norbenzphetamine-d5 were ionized by electrospray ionization at ∼3500 V. Protonated parental ions ([M + H]+) of norbenzphetamine (m/z 226.1) and norbenzphetamine-d5 (m/z 231.1) were admitted into the first quadrupole and fragmented by collision with nitrogen gas in the second quadrupole. The fragment ions of m/z 91.1 from parental ion of m/z 226.1 and m/z 96.1 from parental ion of m/z 231.1 were detected in the third quadrupole, and the integrated area of the two fragment ions, m/z 91.1 versus m/z 96.1, were used for quantification.Determination of the Rate of Product Formation under Pre-steady-state Conditions in a Rapid Chemical Quench Apparatus—The kinetics of product formation were measured under pre-steady-state conditions using the chemical quench flow apparatus to determine whether product release was the rate-limiting step in catalysis. The experiments were conducted at 30 °C in a manner identical to that described for the single turnover conditions except that Syringe A contained the preformed (at 4 °C overnight) oxidized complexes in aerobic Buffer A at a concentration of 10 μm for cyt P450 and CPR and 30 μm for cyt b5 when it was present. Syringe B contained 1 mm cyclohexane and 0.3 mm NADPH in aerobic Buffer A. Cyclohexanol was analyzed using the GC-MS assay as described above.Measurement of NADPH Consumption and Substrate Metabolism under Steady-state Conditions—The rate of NADPH consumption and cyclohexane metabolism by cyt P450 2B4 under steady-state conditions was measured at 30 °C in a spectrophotometric quartz cuvette. Cyt P450 (0.3 nmol), CPR (0.3 nmol), varying amounts of cyt b5 (0–1.5 nmol), and DLPC (68 nmol) were added in the given order to an Eppendorf tube. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, was added to a final concentration of 50 mm in a volume of 1 ml. Cyclohexane was added as a methanolic solution to a final concentration of 1 mm cyclohexane and ≤0.25% (v/v) methanol. The reaction mixture was incubated in the cuvette for 5 min at 30 °C to achieve thermal equilibrium before NADPH was added to a final concentration of 0.3 mm to initiate the reaction. Consumption of NADPH was continually monitored at 340 nm for 5 min, at which time the reaction was terminated by mixing 0.2 ml of the reaction mixture with an equal volume of 1 m NaOH. The rate of NADPH consumption was calculated using an extinction coefficient of 6.2 mm–1 cm–1 at 340 nm. The amount of cyclohexanol was quantified with the GC-MS assay method as described previously. Cyclohexanol was extracted once with 5 ml of dichloromethane"
https://openalex.org/W2054411989,"A novel model for the regulation of cell excitability has recently been proposed. It originates from the observation that the background K(+) channel K2P1 (TWIK1) may be silenced by sumoylation in Xenopus oocytes and that inactivation of the putative sumoylation site (mutation K274E) gives rise to robust current expression in transfected COS-7 cells. Here, we show that only the mutation K274E, and not K274R, is associated with an increase of K2P1 current density, suggesting a charge effect of K274E. Furthermore, we failed to observe any band shift by western blot analysis that would confirm an eventual sumoylation of K2P1 in COS-7 cells and oocytes."

https://openalex.org/W1972230645,"The phosphorylation of the cardiac Ca2+-release channel (ryanodine receptor, RyR2) by protein kinase A (PKA) has been extensively characterized, but its functional consequence remains poorly defined and controversial. We have previously shown that RyR2 is phosphorylated by PKA at two major sites, serine 2030 and serine 2808, of which Ser-2030 is the major PKA site responding to β-adrenergic stimulation. Here we investigated the effect of the phosphorylation of RyR2 by PKA on the properties of single channels and on spontaneous Ca2+ release during sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ overload, a process we have referred to as store overload-induced Ca2+ release (SOICR). We found that PKA activated single RyR2 channels in the presence, but not in the absence, of luminal Ca2+. On the other hand, PKA had no marked effect on the sensitivity of the RyR2 channel to activation by cytosolic Ca2+. Importantly, the S2030A mutation, but not mutations of Ser-2808, diminished the effect of PKA on RyR2. Furthermore, a phosphomimetic mutation, S2030D, potentiated the response of RyR2 to luminal Ca2+ and enhanced the propensity for SOICR in HEK293 cells. In intact rat ventricular myocytes, the activation of PKA by isoproterenol reduced the amplitude and increased the frequency of SOICR. Confocal line-scanning fluorescence microscopy further revealed that the activation of PKA by isoproterenol increased the rate of Ca2+ release and the propagation velocity of spontaneous Ca2+ waves, despite reduced wave amplitude and resting cytosolic Ca2+. Collectively, our data indicate that PKA-dependent phosphorylation enhances the response of RyR2 to luminal Ca2+ and reduces the threshold for SOICR and that this effect of PKA is largely mediated by phosphorylation at Ser-2030.

Bers D.M. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2004; 14: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). A major cause of VT is believed to be delayed afterdepolarizations, which are produced by spontaneous Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) via the cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2) during SR Ca2+ overload (2Kass R.S.

Res. 2005; 97: 1173-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Physical or emotional stresses, which activate the β-adrenergic receptor (AR)/protein kinase A (PKA) signaling pathway, are common triggers for SOICR. The activation of PKA leads to the phosphorylation of several key Ca2+ handling proteins, including the L-type Ca2+ channel, phospholamban (PLB), and RyR2. The outcome of this PKA activation is an increase in the SR Ca2+ load, SR Ca2+ release, and consequently cardiac output (8Bers D.M. Nature. 2002; 415: 198-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (3397) Google Scholar). Although the impact of PKA phosphorylation of the L-type Ca2+ channel and PLB on Ca2+ influx and SR Ca2+ uptake is well understood, the functional consequence and physiological significance of the phosphorylation of RyR2 by PKA remains unclear and controversial (9Bers D.M. Eisner D.A. Valdivia H.H. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 487-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Marks' group has shown that RyR2 is phosphorylated by PKA at a single residue, Ser-2808 (10Marx S.O. Reiken S. Hisamatsu Y. Jayaraman T. Burkhoff D. Rosemblit N. Marks A.R. Cell. 2000; 101: 365-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1686) Google Scholar, 11Wehrens X.H. Lehnart S.E. Reiken S. Vest J.A. Wronska A. Marks A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1992; 267: 4963-4967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). They propose that in HF this residue is hyperphosphorylated by PKA, resulting in the dissociation of a 12.6-kDa FK506-binding protein (FKBP12.6) from RyR2 and consequently increasing the sensitivity of the channel to activation by cytosolic Ca2+ and enhancing SR Ca2+ leak. However, we have recently shown that RyR2 is phosphorylated by PKA at two major sites, Ser-2030 and Ser-2808, of which Ser-2030 is the major site responding to PKA activation upon β-adrenergic stimulation, and that there is no hyperphosphorylation of RyR2 by PKA in canine HF (14Xiao B. Jiang M.T. Zhao M. Yang D. Sutherland C. Lai F.A. Walsh M.P. Warltier D.C. Cheng H. Chen S.R.W. Circ. Res. 2005; 96: 847-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Jiang et al. (15Jiang M.T.

Res. 2002; 91: 1015-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) have also demonstrated that there are no measurable differences in the phosphorylation level of RyR2 by PKA between failing and non-failing canine hearts. Moreover, stoichiometric phosphorylation of both native and recombinant RyR2 at Ser-2808 and mutations of Ser-2808 fail to dissociate FKBP12.6 from RyR2 (16Stange M. Xu L. Balshaw D. Yamaguchi N. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51693-51702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 17Xiao B. Sutherland C. Walsh M.P. Chen S.R.W. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 487-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Furthermore, neither mutations of Ser-2808, nor the dissociation of FKBP12.6 affected the properties of RyR2 channels (16Stange M.

Hence the mechanism by which PKA modulates RyR2 requires further investigation. The results of most in vitro studies using isolated RyR2 and SR membrane vesicles indicate that the phosphorylation of RyR2 by PKA increases its open probability or its responsiveness to fast Ca2+ transients (10Marx S.O.

However, the functional impact of PKA-dependent phosphorylation of RyR2 on SR Ca2+ release in intact cardiac myocytes is unclear and difficult to study. This is because SR Ca2+ release is dependent not only on the activity of RyR2, but also on the activity of the L-type Ca2+ channel and SR Ca2+ pump, both of which are also regulated by PKA (8Bers D.M. Nature. 2002; 415: 198-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (3397) Google Scholar). Studies of the properties of Ca2+ sparks and SR Ca2+ release have shown that the phosphorylation of RyR2 by PKA does not appear to produce an appreciable effect on SR Ca2+ release and that the PKA-induced augmentation of SR Ca2+ release is primarily due to increased Ca2+ influx and SR Ca2+ load (23Li Y. Kranias E.G. Mignery G.A. Bers D.M. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 24Ginsburg K.S. Bers D.M. J. Physiol. 2004; 556: 463-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). These results are seemingly inconsistent with those of in vitro studies. The reasons for this apparent discrepancy are unknown. Moderate modulation of RyR2 activity has been shown to have no sustained effect on stimulated SR Ca2+ release due to the regulation of RyR2 by luminal Ca2+, a phenomenon often referred to as “SR auto-regulation” (25Eisner D.A. Trafford A.W. Diaz M.E. Overend C.L. O'Neill S.C. Cardiovasc. Res. 1998; 38: 589-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), but it does exert a sustained impact on spontaneous Ca2+ release or SOICR (26Trafford A.W. Sibbring G.C. Diaz M.E. Eisner D.A. Cell Calcium. 2000; 28: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Hence, one may be able to study the modulation of RyR2 by examining the SOICR activity, rather than stimulated SR Ca2+ release or Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release. Using this approach, we have recently shown that those RyR2 mutations that are linked to ventricular tachycardia and sudden death reduce the threshold for SOICR by sensitizing the channel to luminal Ca2+ activation (6Jiang D. Xiao B. Yang D. Wang R. Choi P. Zhang L. Cheng H. Chen S.R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13062-13067Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 7Jiang D. Wang R. Xiao B. Kong H. Hunt D.J. Choi P. Zhang L. Chen S.R.W. Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 1173-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). In the present study, we assessed the effect of PKA activation on SOICR in rat ventricular myocytes. Our results indicate that PKA phosphorylation activates the RyR2 channel and consequently enhances the propensity for SOICR. These findings provide new insight into the arrhythmogenic mechanism of stress-induced cardiac arrhythmias. DNA Transfection and Preparation of Cell Lysate from HEK293 Cells—HEK293 cells grown on 100-mm tissue culture dishes were transfected with RyR2 wild-type (wt) or mutant RyR cDNA using Ca2+ phosphate precipitation as described previously (27Li P. Chen S.R. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). After transfection for 24-26 h, the cells were washed three times with PBS (137 mm NaCl, 8 mm Na2HPO4, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 2.7 mm KCl) plus 2.5 mm EDTA and harvested in the same solution by centrifugation for 8 min at 700 × g in an International Electrotechnical Commission Centra-CL2 centrifuge. The cells were washed with PBS without EDTA and centrifuged again at 700 × g for 8 min. The PBS-washed cells were solubilized in a lysis buffer containing 25 mm Tris/50 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 137 mm NaCl, 1% CHAPS, 0.5% soybean phosphatidylcholine, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, and a protease inhibitor mix (1 mm benzamidine, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The mixture was incubated on ice for 1 h. Cell lysate was obtained by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 30 min twice in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C to remove the unsolubilized materials. Generation of Stable, Inducible HEK293 Cell Lines—The mutations S2030A, S2030D, S2808A, S2808D, and S2030A/S2808A (double mutation) were introduced into the mouse RyR2 by the overlap extension method using the polymerase chain reaction as described previously (14Xiao B. Jiang M.T. Zhao M. Yang D. Sutherland C. Lai F.A. Walsh M.P. Warltier D.C. Cheng H. Chen S.R.W. Circ. Res. 2005; 96: 847-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 28Xiao B. Zhong G. Obayashi M. Yang D. Chen K. Walsh M. Shimoni Y. Cheng H. Ter Keurs H. Chen S. Biochem. J. 2006; 396: 7-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Stable, inducible HEK293 cell lines expressing the S2030D and S2030A mutants were generated using the Flp-In T-REx Core Kit from Invitrogen. Briefly, Flp-In T-REx-293 cells were cotransfected with the inducible expression vector pcDNA5/FRT/TO containing the mutant cDNAs and the pOG44 vector encoding the Flp recombinase in 1:5 ratios using the Ca2+ phosphate precipitation method. The transfected cells were washed with PBS (137 mm NaCl, 8 mm Na2HPO4, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, and 2.7 mm KCl) 24 h after transfection followed by a change into fresh media for 24 h. The cells were then washed again with PBS, harvested, and plated onto new dishes. After the cells had attached (∼4 h), the growth medium was replaced with a selection medium containing 200 μg/ml hygromycin (Invitrogen). The selection medium was changed every 3-4 days until the desired number of cells was grown. The hygromycin-resistant cells were pooled, aliquoted, and stored at -80 °C. These positive cells are believed to be isogenic, because the integration of RyR2 cDNA is mediated by the Flp recombinase at a single FRT site. Each HEK293 cell line was tested for RyR2 expression using Western blotting analysis and immunocytofluorescence staining (data not shown). Isolation of Adult Rat Ventricular Myocytes—All studies with rats were approved by the Animal Care Committee of the University of Calgary and complied with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH Publication no. 85-23, revised 1996). Single rat ventricular myocytes were isolated as described previously (29Shimoni, Y., Chuang, M., Abel, E. D., and Severson, D. L. (2004) 555, 345-354Google Scholar). Isolated cells were stored at room temperature in a solution containing 20 mm taurine, 5 mg/ml albumin, and 0.5 mm CaCl2, until used for single cell Ca2+ imaging studies. Single Cell Epifluorescent Ca2+ Imaging of Rat Ventricular Myocytes—Freshly isolated rat ventricular myocytes were placed on glass coverslips coated with 0.02% (w/v) gelatin and 10 μg/ml fibronectin, and loaded with 5 μm fluo-4-AM Ca2+ (Molecular Probes) plus 0.02% pluronic F-127 dye in Krebs-Ringer-Hepes (KRH) buffer (125 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 6 mm glucose, 1.2 mm MgCl2, and 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) (without KH2PO4) in the presence of 1.0 mm Ca2+ for 20 min at room temperature (22 °C). The coverslips were mounted in a perfusion chamber on an inverted microscope (Nikon TE2000-S) equipped with a S-Fluor 20×/0.75 objective. The [Ca2+] was then stepped to 3 mm for 5 min before further increasing it to 6 mm. The cells were then continuously perfused with KRH buffer containing 6 mm CaCl2 at room temperature (22 °C) in the absence (5 min) and presence of 100 nm isoproterenol (Iso) (6-7 min). To minimize photo-induced damage, the cells were not excited during the initial 3.5 min of the control period (6 mm CaCl2 with no Iso) and the initial 1.5 min of Iso treatment. Time-lapse images were captured every 0.15 s during the excitation periods, using Compix Inc. Simple PCI 6 software. The images were analyzed to determine the fluo-4 signal for each Ca2+ wave. To capture the wave front of each Ca2+ wave, a series (10Marx S.O. Reiken S. Hisamatsu Y. Jayaraman T. Burkhoff D. Rosemblit N. Marks A.R.

These regions of interest were positioned so that the wave front would fall within one of these regions for each Ca2+ wave. The region of interest that displayed the highest fluo-4 signal at each time point was then used as the signal for that time point, thereby capturing every wave front. This method of analysis allowed for the measurement of the Ca2+ signal over a very small distance within the cell and capturing the wave front of each Ca2+ wave with a relatively slow recording speed (0.15 s per image). Confocal Line-scan Fluorescence Ca2+ Imaging—Freshly isolated rat ventricular myocytes were loaded with the Ca2+ indicator dye fluo-4-AM (5 μm, 10 min), and line-scan Ca2+ images were acquired using a confocal microscope (LSM510, Zeiss) equipped with a 40×, 1.3 numerical aperture, oil-immersion objective. For Ca2+ wave image acquisition, the scanning line was positioned along the length of the cell with a line-scan rate of 10 ms/line. For paired comparison, images before and after Iso (100 nm) treatment were acquired from the same cells. All experiments were performed at room temperature. The slope of the leading front of a propagating wave in the line-scan (x - t) image was fitted with a linear function to measure the wave velocity. The wave front was then aligned according to the linear fitting and spatially averaged for time course and amplitude analysis. All image-processing programs were coded in interactive data language. Single Channel Recordings in Planar Lipid Bilayers—Recombinant RyR2 wt treated with active- or inactive (boiled)-PKA and RyR2 mutants were partially purified from cell lysate by sucrose density gradient centrifugation (6Jiang D.

Heart phosphatidylethanolamine and brain phosphatidylserine (Avanti Polar Lipid), dissolved in chloroform, were combined in a 1:1 ratio (w/w), dried under nitrogen gas, and suspended in 30 μl of n-decane at a concentration of 12 mg lipid/ml. Bilayers were formed across a 250-μm hole in a Delrin partition separating two chambers. The cis chamber (800 μl) was connected to the head stage input of an Axopatch 200A amplifier (Axon Instruments Inc.). The trans chamber (1.2 ml) was held at virtual ground. A symmetrical solution containing 250 mm KCl and 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), was used for all recordings, unless indicated otherwise. A 4-μl aliquot (∼1 μg of protein) of the sucrose density gradient-purified recombinant wt or mutant RyR2 protein was added to the trans chamber. Spontaneous channel activity was always tested for sensitivity to EGTA and Ca2+. The chamber to which the addition of EGTA inhibited the activity of the incorporated channel was presumed to correspond to the cytoplasmic side of the channel. The direction of single channel currents was always measured from the luminal to the cytoplasmic side of the channel, unless mentioned otherwise. Recordings were filtered at 2500 Hz. Free Ca2+ concentrations were calculated using the computer program of Fabiato and Fabiato (30Fabiato A. Fabiato F. J. Physiol. (Paris). 1979; 75: 463-505PubMed Google Scholar). Data analyses were carried out using the pClamp 8.1 software (Axon Instruments Inc.). Activation of Single RyR2 Channels by PKA Requires Luminal Ca2+—An increasing body of evidence suggests that SR luminal Ca2+ plays an important role in the regulation of RyR2. To determine whether luminal Ca2+ is involved in the activation of RyR2 by PKA, we assessed the activity of single RyR2 channels before and after PKA treatment in the presence or absence of luminal Ca2+ using single channel recordings in planar lipid bilayers. As shown in Fig. 1, a single RyR2(wt) channel displayed little activity before PKA treatment in the presence of 2.5 mm luminal Ca2+. The subsequent addition of PKA activated the RyR2 channel (Fig. 1A). On average, PKA increases the open probability (Po) of single RyR2 (wt) channels to 16.6 ± 3.7 times (mean ± S.E., n = 15, p < 0.002) that before PKA treatment (control). On the other hand, PKA pretreated with cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor had no effect (1.11 ± 0.07 times that of the control, n = 4, p = 0.210) (Fig. 2C). Importantly, the stimulatory effect of PKA on RyR2 requires luminal Ca2+. In the presence of low luminal Ca2+ (3.6 μm), PKA did not significantly affect the activity of single RyR2 channels (Fig. 1B). The average Po after PKA treatment at 2-4 μm luminal Ca2+ was 0.99 ± 0.07 times that of the control (n = 7, p = 0.876) (Fig. 2C).FIGURE 2Effect of PKA on single RyR2 mutant channels. Single channel activities of the RyR2 mutants S2030A (A) and S2808D (B) were recorded as described in the legend to Fig. 1. Control single channel current traces in the presence of 1 mm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, and 260 nm Ca2+ (cytosolic) and 2.5 mm Ca2+ (luminal) are shown in panels a in both A and B. Panels b show single channel current traces after the addition of PKA (cytosolic). Po ratios (Po after over Po before) for RyR2(wt) in the presence of high or low luminal [Ca2+], various RyR2 mutants, and RyR2(wt) treated with PKA plus cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor are shown in C. Data shown are mean ± S.E. from 4-15 single channels.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Activation of Single RyR2 Channels by PKA Is Largely Mediated by Ser-2030—We have previously shown that PKA phosphorylates RyR2 at two major sites, Ser-2030 and Ser-2808 (14Xiao B.

To dissect whether Ser-2030 or Ser-2808 or both mediates the activation of RyR2 by PKA, we assessed the effect of PKA on the single channel activities of the RyR2 mutants S2030A, S2808A, S2808D, and S2030A/S2808A. We used the S2808D mutation to mimic constitutive phosphorylation of RyR2 at Ser-2808, because Ser-2808 is already highly phosphorylated at rest (14Xiao B. Jiang M.T. Zhao M. Yang D. Sutherland C. Lai F.A. Walsh M.P. Warltier D.C. Cheng H. Chen S.R.W. Circ. Res. 2005; 96: 847-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 22Carter S. Colyer J. Sitsapesan R. Circ.

J. 2006; 396: 7-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Single channel recordings of these mutant channels were carried out in the presence of 2.5 mm luminal Ca2+. As shown in Fig. 2A, PKA did not significantly affect the activity of the S2030A mutant. The average Po after PKA treatment was 1.33 ± 0.29 times (n = 7, p = 0.276) that of the control (Fig. 2C). Similarly, no significant PKA-induced increase in Po was observed with single S2030A/S2808A mutant channels (1.16 ± 0.19 times, n = 9, p = 0.423) (Fig. 2C). On the other hand, single S2808A and S2808D mutant channels were significantly activated by PKA. The average Po values after PKA treatment are 11.1 ± 4.4 times (n = 10, p < 0.05) that of the control for S2808A and 19.1 ± 5.9 times (n = 6, p < 0.02) that of the control for S2808D (Fig. 2, B and C). These data demonstrate that Ser-2030 is a major PKA site that mediates the activating effect of PKA on RyR2. Phosphomimetic Mutation S2030D Enhances the Response of RyR2 to Luminal Ca2+ and the Propensity for SOICR—To further investigate the role of Ser-2030 in the activation of RyR2 by luminal Ca2+, we assessed the impact of the S2030D and S2030A mutations, which we used to mimic constitutive phosphorylation of Ser-2030 and its abolition, respectively, on the response of RyR2 to a wide range of luminal Ca2+ concentrations. As shown in Fig. 3, both the S2030D and S2030A mutants exhibited little activity in the presence of low concentrations of cytosolic (45 nm) and luminal (45 nm)Ca2+ (Fig. 3, A and B). However, raising the luminal Ca2+ concentrations increased the Po of single S2030D mutant channels much more markedly than that of single S2030A mutant channels (Fig. 3C). For instance, at 2.5 mm luminal Ca2+, the average Po of single S2030D channels was 0.152 ± 0.041 (n = 10), significantly greater than that of single S2030A channels (0.017 ± 0.0097, n = 13) (p < 0.01). The response of single S2030A channels to luminal Ca2+ was similar to that of the wt (7Jiang D. Wang R. Xiao B. Kong H. Hunt D.J. Choi P. Zhang L. Chen S.R.W. Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 1173-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). These data are consistent with the notion that PKA phosphorylation of RyR2 at Ser-2030 sensitizes the channel to luminal Ca2+. Given the link between the luminal Ca2+ activation of RyR2 and SOICR, the enhanced response of the S2030D mutant to luminal Ca2+ should increase the propensity for SOICR. To test this possibility, we assessed the impact of the S2030D and S2030A mutations on SOICR in HEK293 cells. Stable, inducible HEK293 cells expressing the S2030D and S2030A mutants were loaded with fura-2-AM. SOICR was induced in these cells by elevating the external Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]o) from 0.1 to 5 mm and monitored using a single cell Ca2+ epifluorescence-imaging technique. The propensity for SOICR was assessed by measuring the fraction of cells displaying Ca2+ oscillations at each [Ca2+]o. Analyzing a total of 808 S2030D and 409 S2030A mutant cells revealed that a significantly higher fraction of the S2030D mutant cells exhibited Ca2+ oscillations at [Ca2+]o between 0.2 and 5.0 mm than did cells expressing the S2030A mutant (Fig. 3D) (p < 0.05). These analyses also revealed that the S2030D mutant cells displayed a significantly higher frequency of Ca2+ oscillations (155.7 ± 5.7%) than did the S2030A mutant cells (p < 0.0001). However, no significant difference in the amplitude of Ca2+ oscillations between the S2030D and S2030A mutant cells was detected (p = 0.469). There were considerable variations in the amplitude of Ca2+ oscillations among individual HEK293 cells. The change in the amplitude as a result of the mutations may be too small to be revealed in the presence of those large cell-to-cell variations. Nevertheless, these data indicate that the S2030D mutation increases the frequency and propensity for SOICR, which is consistent with its enhancing effect on the luminal Ca2+ activation of RyR2. Effect of PKA Phosphorylation on the Cytosolic Ca2+ Activation of Single RyR2 Channels—We have previously shown that the S2030A and S2030D mutants displayed EC50 values for Ca2+ activation of [3H]ryanodine binding virtually identical to that of RyR2(wt) (14Xiao B.

https://openalex.org/W2147910421,"Skeletal muscle acidosis during exercise has long been thought to be a cause of fatigue, but recent studies have shown that acidosis maintains muscle excitability and opposes fatigue by decreasing the sarcolemmal chloride conductance. ClC-1 is the primary sarcolemmal chloride channel and has a clear role in controlling muscle excitability, but recombinant ClC-1 has been reported to be activated by acidosis. Following our recent finding that intracellular ATP inhibits ClC-1, we investigated here the interaction between pH and ATP regulation of ClC-1. We found that, in the absence of ATP, intracellular acidosis from pH 7.2 to 6.2 inhibited ClC-1 slightly by shifting the voltage dependence of common gating to more positive potentials, similar to the effect of ATP. Importantly, the effects of ATP and acidosis were cooperative, such that ATP greatly potentiated the effect of acidosis. Adenosine had a similar effect to ATP at pH 7.2, but acidosis did not potentiate this effect, indicating that the phosphates of ATP are important for this cooperativity, possibly due to electrostatic interactions with protonatable residues of ClC-1. A protonatable residue identified by molecular modeling, His-847, was found to be critical for both pH and ATP modulation and may be involved in such electrostatic interactions. These findings are now consistent with, and provide a molecular explanation for, acidosis opposing fatigue by decreasing the chloride conductance of skeletal muscle via inhibition of ClC-1.

The modulation of ClC-1 by ATP is a key component of this molecular mechanism. Action potentials of skeletal-muscle membranes occur due to a depolarization-induced transient inward Na+ current through channels that rapidly inactivate at depolarized potentials. Because the equilibrium potentials for both K+ and Cl- are close to the resting membrane potential, K+ and Cl- currents oppose the depolarizing contribution of inward Na+ currents. Voltage-gated K+ channels that activate immediately after Na+ channels are important for returning the membrane potential to resting levels after an action potential. During vigorous muscle activity, however, extracellular K+ can accumulate, leading to membrane depolarization and probably chronic inactivation of Na+ channels (1Ruff R.L. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1996; 156: 159-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 2Sejersted O.M. Sjogaard G. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1411-1481Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), in turn leading to reduced inward Na+ current, a factor thought to contribute to muscle fatigue. At rest ∼80% of the total membrane conductance is carried by Cl- (3Bretag A.H. Physiol. Rev. 1987; 67: 618-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), the vast majority through weakly voltage-dependent ClC-1 chloride channels (4Steinmeyer K. Ortland C. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 1991; 354: 301-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar) as demonstrated by mice deficient in ClC-1 whose muscle chloride conductance (GCl) 3The abbreviations used are: GCl, chloride conductance; pHi, intracellular pH; CBS, cystathionine β-synthase; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; wt, wild type. is reduced to <10% of that of wild-type mice (5Chen M.F. Niggeweg R. Iaizzo P.A. Lehmann-Horn F. Jockusch H. J. Physiol. 1997; 504: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In order for action-potential initiation and propagation to occur the magnitude of Na+ current must be great enough to overcome electrical shunting through open ClC-1 channels and depolarize the muscle membrane. A reduction of GCl due to ClC-1 inhibition decreases the amount of inward current required to depolarize the membrane, i.e. it increases the excitability of the membrane. The importance of this function of ClC-1 is underscored by the genetic disease myotonia, in which loss-of-function mutations of ClC-1 lead to skeletal muscle hyper-excitability (6Koch M.C. Steinmeyer K. Lorenz C. Ricker K. Wolf F. Otto M. Zoll B. Lehmann-Horn F. Grzeschik K.H. Jentsch T.J. Science. 1992; 257: 797-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). Many myotonia-causing mutations shift ClC-1 voltage dependence to more positive potentials resulting in channel inhibition across the physiological voltage range (7Pusch M. Hum Mutat. 2002; 19: 423-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Working muscle becomes acidified due to lactic acid accumulation during moderate to high intensity activity (8Fitts R.H. Physiol. Rev. 1994; 74: 49-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Acidification has been shown to result in recovery of muscle excitability and force when these have decreased due to elevated extracellular [K+] (9Nielsen O.B. de Paoli F. Overgaard K. J. Physiol. 2001; 536: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). More recent studies have shown that increased excitability at low intracellular pH (pHi) is due to reduced chloride conductance of the muscle membrane (10Pedersen T.H. de Paoli F. Nielsen O.B. J. Gen. Physiol. 2005; 125: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 11Pedersen T.H. Nielsen O.B. Lamb G.D. Stephenson D.G. Science. 2004; 305: 1144-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Low pH has long been known to reduce GCl in muscle membranes (12Hutter O.F. Warner A.E. J.

Physiol. 1977; 69: 325-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), but previous studies of the pH sensitivity of recombinantly expressed ClC-1 have failed to reconcile the reduction of GCl of the membrane with a molecular mechanism acting directly on ClC-1. In patch clamp studies of heterologously expressed ClC-1, low pHi activated the channel by shifting voltage dependence of gating to more negative potentials (14Accardi A. Pusch M. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 433-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 15Rychkov G.Y. Pusch M. Roberts M.L. Bretag A.H. J.

Physiol. 1998; 111: 653-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). If acidosis caused similar activation of ClC-1 in the muscle membrane, this would tend to increase GCl and decrease membrane excitability, contrary to what is observed. Given that ClC-1 is responsible for the vast majority of the sarcolemmal GCl, this contradiction is unlikely to be explained by decreased activity of sarcolemmal chloride channels other than ClC-1. Rather, it appears likely that there is some aspect of the in vivo pH effects on ClC-1 that are not recapitulated when ClC-1 is recombinantly expressed. ClC-1 is a skeletal muscle-specific member of the ClC family of chloride channels and transporters. All eukaryotic members of this family comprise a large membrane-embedded domain followed by two cytoplasmic cystathionine β-synthase (CBS)-related domains. The prototypical, and best studied, channel in this family is ClC-0 from the electric organ of Torpedo electric rays. Based initially on the characteristics of ClC-0 single channel records (17Middleton R.E. Pheasant D.J. Miller C. Nature. 1996; 383: 337-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) and supported by the structures of bacterial ClC homologs (18Dutzler R. Campbell E.B. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 415: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar), there is good evidence that ClC proteins function as homo-dimers in which each monomer contains a separate ion-conducting pore. Single channel records of both ClC-0 (17Middleton R.E. Pheasant D.J. Miller C. Nature. 1996; 383: 337-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) and ClC-1 (19Saviane C. Conti F. Pusch M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 457-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) show two distinct forms of gating, rapid “protopore gating,” which independently opens or closes individual pores within a dimer, and a slower “common gating” process that opens or closes both pores simultaneously. For ClC-1, the two gating mechanisms have relatively similar kinetics at negative potentials but can be kinetically separated in whole cell currents with a short pulse to very positive potentials, selectively opening the protopore gate (14Accardi A. Pusch M. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 433-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Protopore gating appears to involve very minor changes in protein structure, primarily movement of a conserved glutamate side chain at the extracellular channel mouth (20Dutzler R. Campbell E.B. MacKinnon R. Science. 2003; 300: 108-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). In contrast, common gating appears to entail major conformational changes (21Bennetts B. Roberts M.L. Bretag A.H. Rychkov G.Y. J. Physiol. 2001; 535: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 22Pusch M. Ludewig U. Jentsch T.J. J. Gen.

Physiol. 2004; 557: 363-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Previously we have shown that ATP inhibits ClC-1 by shifting the voltage dependence of common gating to more positive potentials, a process mediated by the intracellular CBS domains (24Bennetts B.

We postulated that the physiological relevance of ATP modulation of ClC-1 may be to protect cells from metabolic exhaustion by increasing GCl and decreasing muscle excitability when ClC-1 inhibition is relieved due to ATP depletion during intense activity or ischemia (24Bennetts B.

Here we show that, in the presence of ATP, intracellular acidosis inhibits ClC-1 by enhancing both ATP sensitivity and the maximal effect of ATP on common gating and that His-847 in CBS domain 2 is a key residue in this process. These findings identify a molecular mechanism for the modulation of recombinant ClC-1 by acidosis that, in the presence of physiological intracellular concentrations of ATP, is consistent with the decreased GCl and increased excitability seen with acidosis in skeletal muscle. These findings also indicate that the primary physiological significance of ATP modulation of ClC-1 may be in maintaining excitability and opposing fatigue by potentiating the inhibitory effect of acidosis on ClC-1. Channel Expression and Site-directed Mutagenesis—Human ClCN1 was expressed using a pCIneo (Promega, Madison, WI) mammalian expression vector, as detailed previously (21Bennetts B. Roberts M.L. Bretag A.H. Rychkov G.Y. J. Physiol. 2001; 535: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 26Aromataris E.C. Rychkov G.Y. Bennetts B. Hughes B.P. Bretag A.H. Roberts M.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 200-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Human embryonic kidney (HEK293T) cells (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) were transiently transfected with a mixture of the ClCN1 construct and pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) reporter plasmid at a molar ratio of 3:1 using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science), according to the manufacturer's specifications. Transfected cells were later identified by reporter-plasmid driven expression of the green fluorescent protein. Mutations were introduced into ClCN1 using the QuikChange (Stratagene) mutagenesis technique and confirmed by DNA sequencing. Electrophysiology—Patch clamp experiments were conducted at room temperature (23 ± 1 °C) in the whole cell configuration using an Axopatch 200B patch clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) and associated standard equipment. Cells were continuously superfused with bath solution containing (mm): NaCl, 140; CsCl, 4; CaCl2, 2; MgCl2, 2; HEPES, 10; adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH. The standard pipette solution contained (mm): CsCl, 40; cesium glutamate, 80; EGTA-Na, 10; HEPES, 10; adjusted to pH 7.2 with NaOH. For low pH internal solutions, 10 mm MES was substituted for HEPES, and the pH was adjusted with NaOH. ATP was added to the pipette solution as a magnesium salt at a concentration of 5 mm. Adenosine was added to the pipette solution at a concentration of 5 mm. The pH was readjusted with NaOH after addition of ATP or adenosine. Aliquots were stored at -20 °C and diluted on the day of the experiment. Patch pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass and typically had resistance of 1-2 MΩ when filled with the above pipette solution. Series resistance did not exceed 4 mΩ and was 85-95% compensated. After rupturing the cell membrane and achieving the whole cell configuration, no less than 5 min was allowed for the pipette solution to equilibrate with the intracellular solution before current recordings were made. Currents obtained at a sampling frequency of 10 kHz were filtered at 5 kHz and collected using Axograph 4.9 (Axon Instruments) software. Applied membrane potentials were adjusted for junction potentials calculated using JPCalc (27Barry P.H. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1994; 51: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). Voltage-dependent channel activity was measured by applying a voltage test pulse, stepping in successive sweeps from -140 to +100 mV in 20-mV steps for a duration of 100-800 ms. This was followed by a 75-ms tail pulse at a set -100 mV. The instantaneous current amplitude at the start of the tail pulse was used as a measure of the open probability at the end of the test pulse. To measure the open probability of the common gate only, the protopore gate was fully opened by a 400-μs pulse to +170 mV between the test pulse and the tail pulse (14Accardi A. Pusch M. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 433-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The membrane was clamped to -30 mV for a period of 2 s between each sweep. Data Analysis—Data were analyzed using Axograph 4.9 and Prism 4.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) software. The channel open probability at the end of the test pulse, as a function of test pulse voltage, was determined by measuring the instantaneous current at the start of the tail pulse. This instantaneous current was determined by fitting current relaxations during the -100-mV tail pulse with an equation of the form, I(t)=A1exp(t/τ1)+A2exp(t/τ2)+C(Eq. 1) where I is the whole cell current, t is time, τ1 and τ2 are the time constants of the fast and slow components of current relaxation, respectively, and A1, A2, and C are the amplitudes of the fast, slow, and steady-state components of the current, respectively. Instantaneous current amplitudes at the start of the -100-mV pulse (I(0)) were determined by extrapolation of this function. To obtain the voltage dependence of the apparent channel open-probability (Po), normalized instantaneous current amplitudes were fit with a modified Boltzmann distribution of the form, Po(V)=Pmin+1−Pmin1+exp((V1/2−V)/k)(Eq. 2) where Pmin is an offset, or a minimal open probability at very negative potentials, V is the membrane potential, V½ is the half-maximal activation potential, and k is the slope factor. To determine the voltage dependence of the slow, common gate that acts simultaneously on both protopores of the channel, a 400-μs pulse to +170 mV was inserted before the -100-mV tail pulse, to maximally activate the fast, protopore gates. Instantaneous tail-current amplitudes determined as described above were fit with Equation 2 to yield Po(V) for the common gate. Open probability of the protopore gate was determined by dividing the apparent channel open probability by the open probability of the common gate. These data were fit with Equation 2 to yield Po(V) curves for the protopore. To determine the time course of current relaxations, activating currents were recorded for 500 ms at voltages from 0 to 100 mV in 20-mV increments directly after a 200-ms pulse to -140 mV to deactivate channels. Deactivating currents were recorded during 500-ms pulses between -140 and -40 mV in 20-mV increments directly after a 200-ms pulse to 100 mV to maximally activate current. Current activation was typically biexponential with time constants in the order of milliseconds and 10s of milliseconds (not shown). Deactivating currents were fit with two exponentials using Equation 1, where the fast (τ1) and slow (τ2) time constants are thought to correspond to protopore and common gating processes, respectively (14Accardi A. Pusch M. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 433-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Detailed characterization of ClC-1-gating transitions has indicated that at positive potentials the exponential component due to protopore gating is likely to be too fast to resolve in macroscopic current activation (14Accardi A. Pusch M. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 433-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), so only the single exponential of common gating should be resolved. There were indications, however, of two exponentials in the time course of current activation, consistent with earlier reports (23Duffield M. Rychkov G. Bretag A. Roberts M. J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 121: 149-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Because the two components could not be assigned to particular gating transitions, they were assumed to both contribute to the slow gating process and to simplify subsequent calculations of rate constants, the time course was approximated with a single exponential function (23Duffield M. Rychkov G. Bretag A. Roberts M. J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 121: 149-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) of the form, I(t)=Aexp(t/τ)+C(Eq. 3) where τ is assumed to correspond to common gating. The apparent opening (α) and closing (β) rate constants of the common gate were calculated from the time constants for current deactivation (τ2, from Equation 1) and activation (τ, from Equation 3) and the open probability Po using Equations 4 and 5 (28Chen T.Y. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 112: 715-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). α=Po/τ(Eq. 4) β=(1−Po)/τ(Eq. 5) Unless otherwise labeled, all data, except raw current traces, are presented as the mean ± S.E. of recordings from three or more cells. Dependence of ClC-1 Gating on Intracellular pH—In experiments with isolated rat diaphragm muscle fibers, Palade and Barchi (13Palade P.T. Barchi R.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 1977; 69: 325-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) noted that low pH reduced chloride conductance of the muscle membrane over a time course of 15-20 min, with the prolonged equilibration time potentially indicating that the titratable groups are present inside the cell. In support of this notion, experiments with mechanically skinned extensor digitorum longus muscle fibers from rat demonstrated that intracellular acidification leads to decreased chloride permeability of the t-tubular system (11Pedersen T.H. Nielsen O.B. Lamb G.D. Stephenson D.G. Science. 2004; 305: 1144-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). With this in mind we re-examined the dependence of ClC-1 gating on intracellular pH by using whole cell voltage clamp experiments to measure the channel activity of recombinant human ClC-1 expressed in HEK-293T cells. The intracellular pH was controlled by the buffered pH of the pipette solution. To ensure that the intracellular milieu had equilibrated with the pipette solution, current recordings were only made more than 5 min after achieving whole cell patch configuration by rupturing the membrane across the pipette tip. We cannot be sure of the precise intracellular pH, but, given the buffering capacity and relatively massive volume of the pipette solution, we assume that it matches that of the pipette solution. Consequently, we have not attempted to change the pH of the pipette solution during an experiment, so each cell is tested at only one internal pH. Measurement of ClC-1 currents in excised inside-out membrane patches would facilitate the ready exchange of the effective intracellular milieu, but we were unable to obtain sufficiently stable ClC-1 currents in this patch configuration. Previous electrophysiological studies of ClC-1 dependence on intracellular pH have used relatively short, 100-200 ms, voltage pulses to drive the gating into steady state (14Accardi A. Pusch M. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 433-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 15Rychkov G.Y. Pusch M. Roberts M.L. Bretag A.H. J. Physiol. 2001; 530: 379-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 29Rychkov G.Y. Pusch M. Astill D.S. Roberts M.L. Jentsch T.J. Bretag A.H. J. Physiol. 1996; 497: 423-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Because the kinetics of ClC-1 macroscopic current relaxations is slowed at low pHi (14Accardi A. Pusch M. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 433-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 15Rychkov G.Y. Pusch M. Roberts M.L. Bretag A.H. J. Physiol. 2001; 530: 379-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 29Rychkov G.Y. Pusch M. Astill D.S. Roberts M.L. Jentsch T.J. Bretag A.H. J. Physiol. 1996; 497: 423-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) we explored the use of longer voltage test pulses to ensure that the slow component of current relaxation, corresponding to common gating (14Accardi A. Pusch M. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 433-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), reached steady state before measuring open probability with a set-voltage tail pulse. With the pipette (intracellular) solution at pH 6.2, we examined the effect on ClC-1 gating of progressively longer voltage test pulses, from 100 to 800 ms (Fig. 1A). To restrict our measurements to the common gate only, a 400-μs pulse to +170 mV was inserted at the end of the test pulse prior to the -100 mV tail pulse (Fig. 1A). Insertion of a short pulse such as this has been shown previously to completely open the protopore gate but is too short to have any significant effect on the common gate (14Accardi A. Pusch M. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 433-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Consequently, the tail current immediately after this short pulse gives a measure of the open probability of the common gate alone. Because the open probability overall is the product of that of the two gates, the open probability of the protopore gate can be determined by dividing the open probability overall by that of the common gate. Sample traces of the currents in response to different length test pulses (shown in Fig. 1B, with sweeps at different test pulse voltages overlaid) clearly demonstrate that currents did not reach steady state until the test pulse was longer that 400 ms. The instantaneous current peak at the start of the tail pulse, which measures open probability, also clearly changed with the length of test pulse, although the details of this were not clear until it was normalized and plotted against test pulse voltage (Fig. 1C). The longer test pulses clearly shifted the apparent voltage dependence of common gating to more positive potentials (Fig. 1C), emphasizing the importance of applying pulses of sufficient length to allow gating to reach equilibrium. Visual inspection and fitting of exponentials to gating relaxations (data not shown) indicated that gating had essentially equilibrated by the end of an 800-ms voltage pulse. To ensure that chloride currents during these long voltage pulses had not significantly shifted the chloride equilibrium, we used current-clamp mode to measure the voltage at which there was zero current. This did not change immediately before and after the 800-ms voltage (results not shown), indicating that these longer pulses did not significantly affect chloride equilibrium, consistent with the work of others using similar voltage pulses (23Duffield M. Rychkov G. Bretag A. Roberts M. J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 121: 149-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Consequently, we have used 800-ms voltage pulses throughout the remainder of this study. We next used these voltage pulse protocols to examine the effect of varying intracellular pH (Fig. 2A) on the voltage dependence of ClC-1 channel open probability. We measured both the overall open probability, by omitting the 400-μs pulse to +170 mV at the end of test pulse, and the common gate open probability, by including this pulse. We could then calculate open probability of the protopore gate by dividing the overall apparent open probability by that for the common gate. The voltage dependence of the overall apparent open probability had an unusual bi-phasic dependence on intracellular pH (pHi), such that it was most negative at pH 7.2 and was shifted to more positive voltages at both higher and lower pH (Fig. 2B). When the contributions of common (Fig. 2C) and protopore (Fig. 2C) gating to the overall channel open probability were dissected, it became clear that this biphasic pH dependence arises from the effect of pH on common gating. With a minimum at pH ∼7.2, changing pHi in either direction shifted the voltage dependence of common gating to more positive potentials (Fig. 2C). At the same time, decreasing pHi below 7.2 reduced the minimum value of the gating curve, Pcommonmin. In contrast, and as previously reported (14Accardi A. Pusch M. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 433-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), decreasing pHi below 7.2 shifted the voltage dependence of protopore gating to slightly more negative potentials, and the minimum value of the gating curve was increased (Fig. 2D). Overall, when both gating mechanisms are taken into account, a decrease in pH from 7.2 to 6.2 reduced the open probability of ClC-1 across the range of physiologically relevant membrane potentials, consistent with the reduced skeletal muscle sarcolemmal chloride-conductance observed with acidosis (10Pedersen T.H. de Paoli F. Nielsen O.B. J. Gen. Physiol. 2005; 125: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 11Pedersen T.H. Nielsen O.B. Lamb G.D. Stephenson D.G.

J. Gen. Physiol. 1977; 69: 325-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Effects of Intracellular ATP and Protons on ClC-1 Common Gating Are Synergistic—Previously we have shown that intracellular ATP shifts the voltage dependence of ClC-1 common gating to more positive potentials (24Bennetts B. Rychkov G.Y. Ng H.L. Morton C.J. Stapleton D. Parker M.W. Cromer B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32452-32458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), in a similar manner to the effect of acidosis described above. Because acidosis and ATP depletion can both occur in working skeletal muscle, we were interested to examine the interaction of these two modulatory effects on ClC-1. Consequently, we compared the effects on ClC-1 gating of acidosis and ATP, independently and in combination. Consistent with our previous finding that ATP had no effect on protopore gating of ClC-1 (24Bennetts B. Rychkov G.Y. Ng H.L. Morton C.J. Stapleton D. Parker M.W. Cromer B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32452-32458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), we found that ATP had no effect on the pH dependence of protopore gating (data not shown). The effects of protons and ATP on the voltage dependence of common gating were found to be synergistic, with the two combined causing a shift to more positive potentials that was greater than the additive effects of each individually (Fig. 3, A and B). Indeed, the voltage dependence of common gating was shifted to such an extent that Po curves showed no obvious saturation at +100 mV, the ma"

When Cx43 expression was knocked down by 50-75%, there was a coordinate 55-65% reduction in Cx26 level, gap junction-based dye coupling was reduced by 60%, and transepithelial resistance decreased. Importantly, the overall growth and differentiation of Cx43 knockdown organotypic epidermis was severely impaired as revealed by alterations in the levels of the differentiation markers loricrin and involucrin and by reductions in vital and cornified layer thicknesses. Conversely, although the expression of Cx43 mutants reduced the coupling status of rat epidermal keratinocytes by ∼80% without altering the levels of endogenous Cx43 or Cx26, their ability to differentiate was not altered. In addition, we used a mouse model of ODDD and found that newborn mice harboring the loss-of-function Cx43G60S mutant had slightly reduced Cx43 levels, whereas Cx26 levels, epidermis differentiation, and barrier function remained unaltered. This properly differentiated epidermis was maintained even when Cx43 and Cx26 levels decreased by more than 70% in 3-week-old mutant mice. Our studies indicate that Cx43 and Cx26 collectively co-regulate epidermal differentiation from basal keratinocytes but play a more minimal role in the maintenance of established epidermis. Altogether, these studies provide an explanation as to why the vast majority of ODDD patients, where Cx43 function is highly compromised, do not suffer from skin disease.

Gap junctions are intercellular channels that form from the pairing of two adjacent connexons from apposing cells. Connexons consist of six connexin subunits selected from the 21-member human connexin family. Gap junctions mediate gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC), 2The abbreviations used are: GJIC, gap junctional intercellular communication; REK, rat epidermal keratinocyte; Cx, connexin; ODDD, oculodentodigital dysplasia; shRNA, short hairpin RNA; GFP, green fluorescent protein. which allows ions, small molecules, and secondary messengers to pass from one cell to another (1Alexander D.B.

Kubilus J. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1983; 80: 124-130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). REKs express mRNA for at least nine connexin family members and differentially regulate the expression and spatial localization of Cx43 and Cx26 (9Maher A.C. Thomas T. Riley J.L. Veitch G. Shao Q. Laird D.W. Cell Commun. Adhes. 2005; 12: 219-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that the expression profile and differentiation characteristics of organotypic epidermis provide an excellent cellular environment to examine the role of connexins in epidermal differentiation (9Maher A.C. Thomas T. Riley J.L. Veitch G. Shao Q. Laird D.W. Cell Commun. Adhes. 2005; 12: 219-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In the current study we examine the specific role of Cx43 in regulating epidermal differentiation. Cx43 is one of the more abundant members of the connexin family expressed in the epidermis, and it is primarily found in the stratum basale and stratum spinosum where keratinocytes undergo proliferation and commence differentiation (2Di W.L.

Cx43 expression tends to diminish in the upper part of the stratum spinosum as the cells continue to differentiate (13Choudhry R. Pitts J.D. Hodgins M.B. Dev. Dyn. 1997; 210: 417-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). It is notable that Cx43 is down-regulated during wound healing (14Coutinho P. Qiu C. Frank S. Tamber K. Becker D. Cell Biol.

Interestingly, the Gja1Jrt/+ mouse exhibited no obvious gross skin abnormality. Although a Cx43 knock-out line exists (21Reaume A.G. de Sousa P.A. Kulkarni S. Langille B.L. Zhu D. Davies T.C.

Science. 1995; 267: 1831-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar), Cx43-null mice die at birth, restricting any assessment of skin disorders in mice to the early stages of development. The role of Cx43 in skin development was nevertheless established when mice harboring a truncated variant of Cx43 died within the first week after birth as a result of a major defect in skin barrier function (22Maass K. Ghanem A. Kim J.S. Saathoff M. Urschel S. Kirfel G. Grummer R. Kretz M. Lewalter T. Tiemann K. Winterhager E. Herzog V. Willecke K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4597-4608Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Collectively, these studies suggest that Cx43 plays a vital role in skin and epidermal development, yet it is unclear what role Cx43 plays in the differentiation, stratification, and maintenance of the epidermis during continual renewal. In the present study we used two different approaches to assess the role of Cx43 in epidermal differentiation. First, Cx43 expression levels were reduced by an RNA-mediated interference strategy, and differentiation was assessed in organotypic epidermis from REKs. The organotypic epidermis model was chosen because of the ease with which connexin expression can be manipulated in cells undergoing differentiation in a three-dimensional configuration, mimicking epidermal development in vivo. Second, the functional status of Cx43 was inhibited by the overexpression of dominant-negative ODDD-linked Cx43 mutants. The effect of ODDD-linked Cx43 mutants in epidermis differentiation was assessed in an organotypic model in vitro and in mouse skin in vivo. Knockdown of Cx43 expression in keratinocytes significantly altered their ability to properly stratify and assemble into an epidermis, thus resulting in a loss of architectural organization of the organotypic epidermis. The reduction of Cx43 expression also resulted in a decrease in Cx26 and an up-regulation in the expression of differentiation markers involucrin and loricrin. As opposed to the Cx43 knockdown studies, the inhibition of GJIC function by overexpressing dominant-negative Cx43 mutants did not alter the ability of keratinocyte to reach terminal differentiation in vitro. In vivo, newborn Gja1Jrt/+ mice harboring the loss-of-function Cx43G60S mutant exhibited only a slight reduction of total Cx43 expression compared with control animals without any change in Cx26 levels, suggesting that the amounts of Cx43 and Cx26 present during embryonic epidermal differentiation were similar in mutants and control mice. Accordingly, newborn G60S mice did not show any difference in the levels of keratinocyte differentiation markers or in barrier function integrity of the epidermis. As these mice age, although there was a significant reduction in Cx43 and Cx26, the integrity of the properly and fully stratified epidermis observed in newborn skin and its continual renewal were maintained. Cell and Organotypic Epidermal Culture—REKs were cultured as previously described (9Maher A.C. Thomas T. Riley J.L. Veitch G. Shao Q. Laird D.W. Cell Commun. Adhes. 2005; 12: 219-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were cultured in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. All cell culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen. For organotypic cultures REKs were subcultured on collagen I-coated transwells as previously described (9Maher A.C. Thomas T. Riley J.L.

Once cells reached confluence, the medium from the upper chamber was removed to expose the cells to a liquid/air interface for 14 days. shRNA Constructs and Retroviral Infections—Two Cx43-targeted shRNA constructs designated S1 (GAAGTTCAAGTACGGGATT) and S2 (GGTGTGGCTGTCAGTACTT) together with a control vector containing a nonsense sequence were designed and used to make infectious viral supernatants as we described previously (23Shao Q. Wang H. McLachlan E. Veitch G.I. Laird D.W. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 2705-2711Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). REKs were infected and cultured in the same manner as we described (23Shao Q. Wang H. McLachlan E. Veitch G.I. Laird D.W. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 2705-2711Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Infected REKs were cultured in selection medium containing 50 μg/ml hygromycin, and antibiotic-resistant cells were passed at least 3 times before further experimentation.

Cx43 Mutant Mice—Mice were maintained in accordance with the University of Western Ontario Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Gja1Jrt/+ mutant mice were obtained from Dr. Janet Rossant, Centre for Modeling Human Disease (Toronto, ON). These mice exhibit similar characteristics to the Cx43-linked human disease, oculodentodigital dysplasia, as previously described (20Flenniken A.M. Osborne L.R. Anderson N. Ciliberti N. Fleming C.

Development. 2005; 132: 4375-4386Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Gja1Jrt/+ mutant mice and their wild-type littermates were collected at the day of birth and at 3 weeks of age. Transepithelial Resistance Assay—REKs were plated on 3.0-μm pore transwell inserts (VWR) at 15,000 cells/insert. After 24 h a Millicel-ERS voltmeter (Millipore) was used to measure resistance in ohms. Measurements were taken for three consecutive days. Three independent experiments were performed where three measurements were taken per well, and three wells were used per cell type. Preparation of Cryosections, Histological Staining, and Immunofluorescence—Organotypic epidermis and thick skin from hind paws of euthanized 21-day-old wild-type and Gja1Jrt/+ mutant mice was embedded in Optimal Cutting Temperature compound (Tissue-Tek). To observe histological epidermal structure, hematoxylin and eosin staining was performed as previously described (9Maher A.C. Thomas T. Riley J.L. Veitch G. Shao Q. Laird D.W. Cell Commun. Adhes. 2005; 12: 219-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy were used to examine endogenous and GFP-tagged wild-type and Cx43 mutants in REKs as modified from our previous study (28Thomas T. Telford D. Laird D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19157-19168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Briefly, cultured cells were plated on 12-mm glass coverslips and fixed with an ice-cold solution of 80% methanol and 20% acetone at 4 °C for 15 min. Cryosections and organotypic cultures were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde overnight at room temperature or with methanol/acetone. The localization of endogenous Cx43 was analyzed using rabbit anti-Cx43 (1:500, Sigma-Aldrich). Cell nuclei were stained for 15 min with Hoechst 33342 (10 μg/ml) in phosphate-buffered saline. The samples were mounted in Air-vol or Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlington, ON). Immunolabeled monolayer cultures of REKs and organotypic epidermis were imaged using a Zeiss LSM 510 META system as previously described (28Thomas T. Telford D. Laird D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19157-19168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis—Confluent monolayer cultures and organotypic cultures were solubilized in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm sodium fluoride, and proteases inhibitors), sonicated, and centrifuged to remove the cell debris. In addition, dorsal mouse skin was excised from euthanized newborn and 3-week-old mice and rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline. The skin was homogenized in lysis buffer and treated as described for REK organotypic cultures (9Maher A.C. Thomas T. Riley J.L. Veitch G. Shao Q. Laird D.W. Cell Commun. Adhes. 2005; 12: 219-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Western blots were developed with rabbit anti-Cx43 (1:1000, Sigma-Aldrich), rabbit anti-Cx26 (1:500, Zymed Laboratories Inc.), mouse anti-keratin 14 (dilution 1:5000, Lab Vision Co. Fremont, CA), rabbit anti-involucrin (dilution 1:1000, Covance Research Products, Denver, PA), rabbit anti-loricrin (dilution 1:1000, Covance Research Products), or mouse anti-β-actin (1:5000, Zymed Laboratories Inc.). The membranes were incubated with infrared fluorescent-labeled secondary antibodies (dilution 1:10,000, IRDye 800 anti-rabbit or anti-mouse, Rockland Immunochemicals, Gilbertsville, PA, or Alexa-680 anti-rabbit or anti-mouse, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) at room temperature for 1 h, and immunoblots were processed and quantified using the Odyssey infrared-imaging system (Li-Cor). Toluidine Blue Penetration Assay—To test for intact epidermal barrier, euthanized newborn Gja1Jrt/+ mice and wild-type littermates were incubated for 5 min in 100% methanol and rinsed 3 × 5 min with phosphate-buffered saline followed by a 30-min incubation in 0.1% toluidine blue (29Hardman M.J. Sisi P. Banbury D.N. Byrne C. Development. 1998; 125: 1541-1552Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After 3 × 5-min washes in phosphate-buffered saline, pups were examined for blue staining of the epidermis and imaged using a digital camera. Dye Transfer—Confluent REKs infected with Cx43-targeted shRNA constructs or transiently transfected with cDNAs encoding Cx43-GFP, G21R-GFP, or G138R-GFP were used for microinjection. One cell within a cluster of REKs expressing the GFP-tagged connexin or random cells selected within Cx43-knockdown cell cultures were pressure-microinjected with 1% Lucifer yellow in double-distilled H2O (Molecular Probes) until the cell was brightly fluorescent (<5 s) using an Eppendorf FemtoJet automated pressure microinjector. After 1 min, the percent of microinjected cells that transferred Lucifer yellow to at least one contacting cell was determined using a Leica DM IRE2 inverted epifluorescence microscope. Digital images were collected with a charged coupled device camera (Hamamatsu Photonics, Japan) using OpenLab software (distributed by Quorum Technologies, Inc., Guelph, ON). At least 25 micro-injections were performed for each experimental condition. Statistics—Statistical data were analyzed using an analysis of variance followed by a Tukey test for significance. A two-tailed unpaired t test was used for the data presented in Fig. 6. Error bars reflect S.D. Cx43 Knockdown Alters the Coupling Status, the Transepithelial Resistance, and the Differentiation Characteristics of Keratinocytes—Cx43 is abundantly localized to gap junction plaques at the cell surface between adjoining REKs (Fig. 1A, arrow) and within intracellular compartments (Fig. 1A, arrowhead). To begin to assess the role of Cx43 in keratinocyte differentiation, we reduced Cx43 protein expression levels using shRNA in REKs. Immunofluorescence localization of Cx43 in two different shRNA-treated cell lines revealed that whereas evidence of intracellular localized Cx43 remained (Fig. 1, B and C, arrowheads), there was little evidence for gap junction plaques. Western blot and densitometric analysis (Fig. 1, D and E) confirmed that the two different shRNA sequences reduced Cx43 expression by ∼50-70% compared with the nonsense vector control. The reduction in Cx43 levels also resulted in a ∼50% decrease in the incidence of dye coupling (Fig. 1F). Transepithelial resistance measurements of Cx43-reduced REKs grown on cell culture inserts revealed no change in resistance in comparison to controls until day 3 when a small but significant decrease in transepithelial resistance was observed (Fig. 1G). To determine the effects of Cx43 knockdown on terminal differentiation of keratinocytes, we generated organotypic epidermis from nonsense vector control and Cx43-reduced REKs. The histological staining and the localization patterns in control organotypic epidermis revealed a tightly organized basal layer (Fig. 2, A and C, first layer above the dotted line) and a two- or three-cell thick suprabasal layer (Fig. 2, A and C, dotted line to first dashed line) with abundant evidence for Cx43 at cell-cell interfaces (Fig. 2C, arrows). Control organotypic epidermis also gave rise to a thick cornified layer (Fig. 2, A and C, between dashed lines) that contained sparse staining that we believe is nonspecific anti-Cx43 immunostaining or remnants of Cx43 trapped in the cornified layer (Fig. 2C). When Cx43 was partially reduced, evidence for sparse amounts of Cx43 could still be detected by immunofluorescence (Fig. 2D, arrows). Interestingly, whereas there was some basal cell layer organization, the overall thicknesses of the vital layer was reduced to one or two cell layers (between the dotted line and first dashed line), and the cornified layer (between dashed lines) was typically thinner compared with the wild-type (Fig. 2, B and D). In addition, the organotypic cultures generated from Cx43-reduced REKs were fragile and difficult to peel compared with wild-type and control cultures. Reduction of Cx43 in REKs did not significantly affect cell proliferation as assessed by the incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine or the overall rate of cell growth in two-dimensional cell cultures (data not shown). To assess whether Cx43 knockdown altered epidermal differentiation with respect to known molecular markers of keratinocyte differentiation, organotypic epidermis from vector control and Cx43-reduced REKs were immunoblotted for Cx26, keratin 14, involucrin, and loricrin. Quantification studies from six matched control and Cx43-S1 and -S2 knockdown organotypic cultures revealed that when Cx43 was reduced by ∼70-75%, Cx26 expression was diminished by ∼55-65%. Loricrin and involucrin were up-regulated in Cx43-reduced organotypic epidermis compared with control, whereas keratin 14 was not affected (Fig. 2, E and F). The extent of up-regulation of loricrin and involucrin was variable (∼1.2-4-fold compared with control organotypic epidermis) but consistently observed in all sets of epidermal differentiation assays. Overexpression of ODDD-linked Cx43 Mutants Alters the Coupling Status of Keratinocytes but Not Their Ability to Reach Terminal Differentiation—We examined the effects of two dominant-negative Cx43 mutants, G21R and G138R (16Paznekas W.A.

These overexpressed mutants have been shown to traffic to the cell membrane but fail to form functional gap junction channels (25Roscoe W. Veitch G.I. Gong X.Q. Pellegrino E. Bai D. McLachlan E.

Similar to wild-type REKs, Cx43 was found in gap junction plaques at the cell surface (Fig. 3, A and B, arrows) and in intracellular compartments (Fig. 3, A and B, arrowheads) in REKs overexpressing Cx43-GFP. Consistently, confocal microscopy revealed that both G21R and G138R mutants were found at the cell surface when overexpressed in REKs (Fig. 3, C and D, arrows) as well as within intracellular compartments (Fig. 3, C and D, arrowheads). Western blots indicated that the expression levels of wild-type and Cx43 GFP-tagged mutants were similar in these cells and that the overexpression of these constructs does not affect the level of endogenous Cx43 (Fig. 3E). The expression of the Cx43 mutants inhibited more than 50% of the incidence of dye coupling (Fig. 3F), suggesting that they had dominant-negative effects on co-expressed connexins in REKs. To assess the effect of overexpressing loss-of-function and dominant-negative Cx43 mutants (25Roscoe W. Veitch G.I. Gong X.Q. Pellegrino E. Bai D. McLachlan E. Shao Q. Kidder G.M. Laird D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11458-11466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) on keratinocyte differentiation, we generated organotypic epidermis from REKs overexpressing GFP-tagged wild-type or mutants (G21R and G138R) of Cx43. Similar to the organotypic epidermis from REKs-expressing Cx43-GFP, the organotypic epidermis from cells overexpressing Cx43 mutants showed a tightly organized basal layer (Fig. 4, A-F, above the dotted line) and a two- or three-cell-thick suprabasal layer (Fig. 4, A-F, dotted line to first dashed line) with abundant evidence for Cx43 at cell-cell interfaces (Fig. 4, D-F, arrows) as well as at intracellular locations. Similar to Cx43-GFP, organotypic epidermis generated from REKs expressing the Cx43 mutants gave rise to a thick cornified layer (Fig. 4, A-F, between dashed lines) with considerable evidence of GFP trapped in the cornified layer during keratinization. Although the thicknesses of the vital and cornified were variable, overall no difference in the architecture of the organotypic epidermis from REKs overexpressing the G21R and G138R GFP-tagged Cx43 mutants was observed when compared with organotypic epidermis derived from REKs expressing Cx43-GFP. Organotypic epidermis from REKs overexpressing Cx43-GFP and mutants Cx43 were immunoblotted for Cx43, Cx26, involucrin, keratin 14, and loricrin (Fig. 4G). There was an ∼60% decrease in keratin 14, a basal cell marker of keratinocytes, when either the G21R or G138R mutants were expressed (Fig. 4, G and H), but there was no change in the levels of endogenous Cx43, Cx26, involucrin, or loricrin. However, the reduction of keratin 14 in the organotypic epidermis from REKs overexpressing Cx43 mutants did not affect the ability of these cells to reach terminal differentiation as assessed by the levels of involucrin and loricrin and their overall architecture. Keratinocytes in Gja1Jrt/+Mice Differentiate Normally—Western blot (Fig. 5A) and densitometric analysis (Fig. 5B) of skin obtained from newborn wild-type and Gja1Jrt/+ mice revealed that the total Cx43 expression level was slightly reduced by ∼15-25%. There was no change in the expression level of Cx26 and of the differentiation markers keratin 14, involucrin, and loricrin (Fig. 5, A and B). Toluidine blue staining of 1-day-old pups revealed that there was no obvious change in epidermal barrier function in Gja1Jrt/+ mice when compared with controls (Fig. 5C). Because connexin-linked skin diseases have been usually observed during aging and in the presence of mechanical stress (31Richard G. Clin. Dermatol. 2005; 23: 23-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), the epidermis from 3-week-old wild-type and Gja1Jrt/+ mice was also examined.

This gating mechanism underlies many aspects of Kir channel physiology and pathophysiology; however, its structural basis is not well understood. Here, we demonstrate that H+ and PIP2 use a conserved gating mechanism defined by similar structural changes in the transmembrane (TM) helices and the selectivity filter. Our data support a model in which the gating motion of the TM helices is controlled by an intrasubunit hydrogen bond between TM1 and TM2 at the helix-bundle crossing, and we show that this defines a common gating motif in the Kir channel superfamily. Furthermore, we show that this proposed H-bonding interaction determines Kir channel pH sensitivity, pH and PIP2 gating kinetics, as well as a K+-dependent inactivation process at the selectivity filter and therefore many of the key regulatory mechanisms of Kir channel physiology."

Here we show that TPPP induces tubulin self-assembly into intact frequently bundled microtubules, and that the phosphorylation of specific sites distinctly affects the function of TPPP. In vitro phosphorylation of wild type and the truncated form (Δ3-43TPPP) of human recombinant TPPP was performed by kinases involved in brain-specific processes. A stoichiometry of 2.9 ± 0.3, 2.2 ± 0.3, and 0.9 ± 0.1 mol P/mol protein with ERK2, cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5), and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), respectively, was revealed for the full-length protein, and 0.4-0.5 mol P/mol protein was detected with all three kinases when the N-terminal tail was deleted. The phosphorylation sites Thr14, Ser18, Ser160 for Cdk5; Ser18, Ser160 for ERK2, and Ser32 for PKA were identified by mass spectrometry. These sites were consistent with the bioinformatic predictions. The three N-terminal sites were also found to be phosphorylated in vivo in TPPP isolated from bovine brain. Affinity binding experiments provided evidence for the direct interaction between TPPP and ERK2. The phosphorylation of TPPP by ERK2 or Cdk5, but not by PKA, perturbed the structural alterations induced by the interaction between TPPP and tubulin without affecting the binding affinity (Kd = 2.5-2.7 μm) or the stoichiometry (1 mol TPPP/mol tubulin) of the complex. The phosphorylation by ERK2 or Cdk5 resulted in the loss of microtubule-assembling activity of TPPP.

Currently there is limited information on the phosphorylation of TPPP, although it has been considered as a phosphoprotein (15Takahashi M. Tomizawa K. Ishiguro K. Sato K. Omori A. Sato S. Shiratsuchi A. Uchida T. Imahori K. FEBS Lett. 1991; 289: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). It was partially co-purified with tau protein kinase II (also denoted Cdk5) from bovine brain extract; and two of the Ser/Thr-Pro sites in synthetic peptides, segments of TPPP, were phosphorylated by Cdk5 (15Takahashi M. Tomizawa K. Ishiguro K. Sato K. Omori A. Sato S. Shiratsuchi A. Uchida T. Imahori K. FEBS Lett. 1991; 289: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Martin et al. (16Martin C.P. Vazquez J. Avila J. Moreno F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1586: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) suggested that rat brain TPPP could be phosphorylated near to stoichiometrically in vitro by Cdk5 and by PKA but practically not by glycogen synthase kinase 3. The aim of this work was to demonstrate that TPPP was able to promote the formation of intact-like MTs exhibiting a function characteristic of MAPs, and to establish the effect of phosphorylation on the unfolded “structure” of TPPP, on its interaction with tubulin as well as on its MT promoting and bundling activities. For these purposes we performed in vitro phosphorylation studies with human recombinant TPPP and with its truncated form, searched for the in vivo phosphorylation sites and interacting kinase partner(s), as well as studied the functional consequences of the specific phosphorylation events. Materials—DTT, iodoacetamide, NH4HCO3, and 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid were obtained from Sigma, the sequencing grade side-chain protected trypsin (modified by reductive methylation) was ordered from Promega. C18 ZipTip was from Millipore. MAP-free tubulin was purified from bovine brain as described in Ref. 17Na C.N. Timasheff S.N.

The PCR fragment was inserted into the XhoI and BamHI restriction sites of pET-15b producing pET15b-Δ3-43TPPP. Correct ligations were verified by DNA sequencing. Protein Purification—Recombinant human TPPP and p20 (TPPP3) were expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells and isolated as described previously (4Vincze O. Tőkési N. J. Oláh Hlavanda E. Zotter Á.

Protein Determination—The protein concentration was measured by the Bradford method (18Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar) using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Affinity Chromatography—Human recombinant TPPP was immobilized to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) and used for finding interacting proteins from bovine brain extract as described previously (6Oláh J.

The bound proteins were eluted with 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 0.5 m NaCl, and the protein bands obtained by SDS-PAGE (19Laemmli U.K. Nature (Lond.). 1970; 227: 680-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) were analyzed by mass spectrometry. Protein Phosphorylation—30 μg of recombinant human TPPP or its truncated form (Δ3-43TPPP) or p20 protein (TPPP3) were phosphorylated with PKA, ERK2, and Cdk5 in vitro. A typical reaction mixture contained 50 mm Tris-HCl; pH 7.5 buffer supplemented with 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 0.05 mm sodium vanadate, 25 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm ATP, and 0.4 μg PKA or 0.2 μg of ERK2 in a final volume of 100 μl. In one set of experiments 30 μg of recombinant human TPPP was phosphorylated with 0.1 μg of ERK2 to reduce the degree of modification. Phosphorylation with Cdk5 was conducted in the presence of 12 mm MOPS, pH 7.0 buffer, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm NaF, 0.2 mm sodium vanadate, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 27 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm ATP, and 0.05 μg of kinase. About 107 cpm of [γ-32P]ATP was added to the mixture for radioactive labeling. The reactions were initiated by the addition of the kinase and were terminated with 50 mm EDTA. 5-μl samples were withdrawn at regular time intervals for quantitative analysis. Phosphate incorporation into the proteins was determined by the method of Witt and Roskoski (20Witt J.J. Roskoski R. Anal. Biochem. 1975; 66: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) using Whatmann P-81 filter paper. The radioactivity was counted by Tscherenkov radiation. Aliquots of the samples were separated by SDS-PAGE (19Laemmli U.K. Nature (Lond.). 1970; 227: 680-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). Dried gels were analyzed by autoradiography using RX Fuji medical x-ray films. According to the densitometric scanning of the films with a Bio-Rad Multi-Analyst apparatus more than 90% of the incorporated radioactivity was found in the monomeric and dimeric forms of the proteins. A prestained protein ladder (Fermentas) was used for the estimation of the molecular masses. Radioactive and cold phosphorylation reactions were run parallel under identical conditions. The degree of phosphorylation in the latter case was checked by the method of back phosphorylation (21Nestler E.J. Greengard P. Nature. 1983; 305: 583-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Only the non-radioactive samples were subjected to functional studies and MS. In-gel Digestion—Digestion with side chain-protected porcine trypsin proceeded at 37 °C for 4 h. In-solution Digestion—Protein was dissolved in 6 m guanidine-HCl, disulfide bridges were reduced with dithiothreitol and free sulfhydryls alkylated with iodoacetamide. Then sample was diluted with 25 mm NH4HCO3 and digested with side chain-protected porcine trypsin at 37 °C for 4 h. Methyl Esterification—The protocol of Ficarro (22Ficarro S.B. McCleland M.L.

Phosphopeptide Enrichment by Immobilized Metal Ion Affinity Chromatography—In NTA magnetic agarose beads Ni2+ was displaced by Fe3+ as described by Thompson et al. (23Thompson A.J. Hart S.R. Franz C. Barnouin K. Ridley A. Cramer R. Anal. Chem. 2003; 75: 3232-3243Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) with final washing steps with a mixture of equal volumes of water, methanol, and acetonitrile. Methyl-esterified sample dissolved in water/methanol/acetonitrile was loaded onto the beads and vortexed for 15 min, then beads were washed three times with the loading solvent. Phosphopeptides were eluted with 0.42% H3P04 in 50% acetonitrile. An aliquot of the eluate was either directly analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS or diluted with 0.1% formic acid and loaded on the trapping column for LC-MS/MS. Phosphopeptide Enrichment by TiO2—A modified protocol of Larsen et al. (24Larsen M.R. Thingholm T.E. Jensen O.N. Roepstorff P. Jorgensen T.J.D. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2005; 4: 873-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar) was applied. The tryptic digest was dried down, re-dissolved in 1% trifluoroacetic acid/50% acetonitrile and mixed with TiO2 suspended in the same solvent. After a few minutes vortexing the supernatant was discarded, and TiO2 was washed three to five times with the same solvent. Phosphopeptides were eluted with 1% NH4OH. MALDI-TOF MS and PSD Analysis—These analyses were performed on a Bruker Reflex III MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer in 2,5-dihydroxy-benzoic acid matrix. Three point external calibration was used with standard peptides. PSD analysis was performed in 10-12 steps, lowering the reflectron voltage by 25% at each step, and then stitching the data together. While the MS conditions permitted monoisotopic mass measurements, in PSD mode average masses were determined. LC-MS/MS—Samples were analyzed on an Agilent 1100 nanoLC system on-line coupled to an XCT Plus ion trap mass spectrometer in information-dependent acquisition mode. For phosphopeptide analysis, occasionally a preferred mass list was included in data acquisition with m/z values calculated from MALDI-TOF data or derived from previous analyses. HPLC conditions were as follows: column: C18, 75 μm × 150 mm; flow rate 300 nl/min; gradient: 5-45% B in 16 min, up to 90% B for 3 min, then equilibrated at 5% B for 15 min; solvent A was 0.1% formic acid in water, solvent B: 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile; trapping: 10 μl/min flow rate, for 5 min in solvent A. Data Base Search—MS and MS/MS data were searched against the Swissprot 51.3 (250,296 sequences) and the NCBI 20070120 (4462937 sequences) non-redundant protein data-bases using the Mascot search engine v2.1. Mass tolerance was set according to the type of instrument and acquisition mode. No species restriction was used. Data were also manually inspected. Bioinformatic Methods—For prediction of phosphorylation and docking sites MotifScan (25Obenauer J.C. Cantley L.C. Yaffe M.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3635-3641Crossref PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar) was used. Multiple sequence alignment of vertebrate TPPPs was done by ClustalW (26Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (54908) Google Scholar). CD Measurements—CD spectra were acquired with a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter (Tokyo, Japan) in the 190-260 nm wavelength range employing 0.1-cm thermostated cuvettes at 25 °C, using 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) as described previously (4Vincze O. Tőkési N. J. Oláh Hlavanda E. Zotter Á. Horváth I. Lehotzky A. Tirián L. Medzihradszky K.F. Kovács J. Orosz F. Ovádi J. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 13818-13826Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). During the titration of 1 μm tubulin the difference ellipticity at 207 nm was determined as a function of the concentration of TPPP. Difference ellipticities were calculated from the ellipticity measured at 207 nm in the mixtures of two proteins and in the samples of the individual proteins. Turbidity Measurements—A total of 7 μm MAP-free tubulin was polymerized by 3 μm TPPP before and after phosphorylation at 37 °C in 50 mm MES buffer, pH 6.6, containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, and 50 mm KCl. In the absence of TPPP no tubulin assembly occurs. Absorbance was monitored at 350 nm by a Cary 50 spectrophotometer (Varian, Australia). Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)—The polymerized tubulin samples were centrifuged at 30,000 × g and 30 °C for 20 min and the pellet fraction was used for TEM. The pellets were fixed for 1 h in a mixture of 2% glutaraldehyde, 0.2% freshly prepared tannic acid, and 0.1 m sodium cacodylate (pH 7.4). After washing in cacodylate, they were postfixed in 0.5% OsO4, and embedded in Durcupan (Fluka, Switzerland). Thin sections were contrasted with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined in a Jeol CX 100 electron microscope (1Tirián L. Hlavanda E. Oláh J. Horváth I. Orosz F. Szabó B. Kovács J. Szabad J. Ovádi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13976-13981Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In Vitro Phosphorylation of TPPP—Recombinant human TPPP was phosphorylated by protein kinases (ERK2, Cdk5, and PKA) in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP under conditions to reach maximal phosphorylation within 2 h (see “Experimental Procedures”). Fig. 1 shows typical SDS/PAGE protein staining and autoradiographic images. Two characteristic phosphoprotein bands of 26.5 and 63 kDa appeared in the pictures corresponding to monomeric and dimeric species. By the addition of an excess DTT to the samples all of the dimers were converted to monomers (data not shown). The radioactivity incorporated into TPPP was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures”; the stoichiometry of the phosphorylation was found to be 2.9 ± 0.3, 2.2 ± 0.3, and 0.9 ± 0.1 mol P/mol protein for ERK2, Cdk5, and PKA kinases, respectively (Fig. 1). The phosphorylated protein bands were excised from the gels and digested with trypsin. After phosphopeptide enrichment, samples were analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS, MALDI-TOF PSD, and by LC-MS/MS on an ion trap mass spectrometer. Phosphopeptides were first identified by the 80-Da mass shift in comparison to the predicted molecular masses of tryptic peptides. Their identity was further confirmed by the β-elimination of phosphoric acid (98 Da) from the precursor ion under collision-induced dissociation (CID) or post source decay (PSD) conditions, a characteristic fragmentation step of Ser- and Thr-phosphorylated peptides (27Covey T.R. Sushan B.I. Bonner R. Shroder W. Hucho F. Jörnvall H. Höög J.O. Gustavsson A.M. Methods in Protein Sequence Analysis. Birkhauser Verlag Basel, 1991: 411-447Google Scholar). The sites of phosphorylation were assigned considering the 80 Da mass shift of the appropriate peptide fragments (Table 1).TABLE 1Identification of phosphorylation sites in human recombinant TPPP phosphorylated in vitro by Cdk5, ERK2, and PKAMH+m/zChargeSequencePositionEnrichmentSiteKinase998.0499.52+AISpSPTVSR[157-165]TiO2Ser-160Cdk5, ERK21011.6506.32+AIpSSPTVSR′[157-165]Fe-NTASer-159PKA1559.0780.02+NVTVTD′VD′IVFSK′[90-102]Fe-NTAThr-92PKA3081.71027.93+RLpSLE′S.E.′GAGE′GAAASPE′LSALE′ E′AFRR′[30-57]Fe-NTASer-32PKA1874.5625.53+AANRTPPKpSPGDPSKDR[10-26]TiO2Ser-18Cdk5, ERK21462.3488.13+TPPKpSPGDPSKDR[14-26]TiO2Ser-18Cdk5, ERK21504.3502.13+TPPKpSPGD′PSKD′R′[14-26]Fe-NTASer-18Cdk5, ERK21218.6609.82+TPPKpSPGD′PSK′[14-24]Fe-NTASer-18Cdk5, ERK21915.91915.91+AANRpTPPKSPGD′PSKD′R′[10-26]Fe-NTAThr-14Cdk5 Open table in a new tab In agreement with the minimal consensus of ERK2 and Cdk5, Ser, and Thr residues followed by Pro were targeted by these kinases. From the total of 4 such sites in TPPP, Ser18, and Ser160 were phosphorylated by ERK2, while Thr14, Ser18, and Ser160 were modified by Cdk5. PKA phosphorylated Ser32 within the single PKA consensus sequence KRLS in addition to Thr92 and Ser159 residues, which are in a less favorable sequence environment and may represent minor or unspecific sites. Therefore, we conclude that under in vitro conditions Thr14, Ser18, Ser32, and Ser160 of human TPPP are the main phosphorylation sites of the MT-associated kinases. Our structural prediction (8Orosz F. Kovács G.G. Lehotzky A. Oláh J. Vincze O. Ovádi J. Biol. Cell. 2004; 96: 701-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) suggested a quite extended region in the N terminus of TPPP (1-52 amino acids) with highly unfolded structure. As three of the main phosphorylation sites, Thr14, Ser18, and Ser32, are localized in this tail region we expressed a truncated form of the human TPPP that lacks the first 43 amino acid residues (Δ3-43TPPP) and investigated the consequences of this deletion. Fig. 1 demonstrates that the truncation of the protein significantly reduced both the rate and degree of its phosphorylation. A 0.4-0.5 mol of P/mol protein stoichiometry was reached after 2 h of incubation with ERK2, Cdk5, and PKA. As a negative control, the phosphorylation of recombinant human p20 (TPPP3), a homologue of TPPP that lacks the N-terminal tail, and the phosphorylation site corresponding to Ser160 in TPPP was also tested under similar conditions; and as expected virtually no 32P incorporation (0.02 mol of P/mol protein) was detected. These results suggest that ERK2 and Cdk5 phosphorylate the residues Thr14 and Ser18 in the N-terminal tail more vigorously than Ser160; and PKA efficiently modifies Ser32 that is also localized in the N terminus. Our data are consistent with the predictions by MotifScan (25Obenauer J.C. Cantley L.C. Yaffe M.B.

Premont R.T. Lefkowitz R.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 639-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (2125) Google Scholar). Protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2), the second member of the G protein-coupled PAR family, is involved in inflammation, pain, cell proliferation, and anti-apoptosis (2Cottrell G.S. Amadesi S. Schmidlin F. Bunnett N. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 1191-1197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Steinhoff M. Buddenkotte J. Shpacovitch V. Rattenholl A. Moormann C. Vergnolle N. Luger T.A.

A unique activation mechanism is responsible for PAR-2 activation by irreversible proteolytic cleavage by serine proteases, such as trypsin and tryptase (2Cottrell G.S. Amadesi S. Schmidlin F. Bunnett N. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 1191-1197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, a new N terminus is unmasked acting as a tethered ligand, which can interact with the second extracellular loop of the receptor and thereby initiate multiple signal transductions. A synthetic receptor-activating peptide (AP) with the sequence identical to that of the tethered ligand domain can also fully activate the receptor, bypassing receptor proteolysis (2Cottrell G.S. Amadesi S. Schmidlin F. Bunnett N. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 1191-1197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Upon activation, PAR-2 is rapidly sorted to early endosomes and then translocated to lysosomes where it is degraded (5Dery O. Thoma M.S. Wong H. Grady E.F. Bunnett N.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18524-18535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Therefore, PAR-2 resensitization requires the repopulation of cell-surface receptors from the presynthesized and newly synthesized PAR-2 that are stored at the Golgi apparatus (6Böhm S.K.

It has been shown that the GTPase Rab11a is partially involved in resensitization of PAR-2 (7Roosterman D. Schmidlin F. Bunnett N.W. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: C1319-C1329Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying exocytic PAR-2 transport from the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane are still poorly characterized. The mammalian p24 family, which includes type I transmembrane proteins of the early secretory pathway, is divided into p25 (α), p24A (β), p23 (γ), and p26 (δ) subfamilies (8Dominguez M. Dejgaard K.

Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 751-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). p24A, a major member of the p24 family, has been shown to localize in membranes of the intermediate compartment, cis-Golgi network, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (8Dominguez M. Dejgaard K. Fullekrug J. Dahan S. Fazel A. Paccaud J.P. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J. Nilsson T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 751-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 9Emery G. Rojo M.

Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 537-548Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The protein p24A has a large N terminus at the lumen and a highly conserved, short cytoplasmic C-tail at the cytosol. The cytoplasmic tail of p24A, containing conserved hydrophobic (FF) and basic (RR) motifs, is able to bind to coat protein (COP) I and COPII subunits (8Dominguez M. Dejgaard K. Fullekrug J. Dahan S.

This suggests that p24A is an important constituent of coatomers (14Kaiser C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3783-3785Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The importance of p24A on transport vesicles is also supported by the evidence that p24A, via its cytoplasmic tail, is able to interact with ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (ARF1) (12Contreras I.

Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar). The coiled-coil domain located at the N terminus of p24A has been shown to mediate the formation of a hetero-oligomeric complex between p24 proteins, which is a prerequisite for localization and cycling of p24 proteins in the early secretory pathway (9Emery G. Rojo M. Gruenberg J. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2507-2516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Ciufo L.F. Boyd A. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 447: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). These previous studies suggest that p24A, acting as cargo receptor as well as coat protein receptor, is involved in biogenesis of transport vesicles and subsequent protein trafficking between the ER and the Golgi apparatus and within the Golgi apparatus (13Fiedler K. Veit M. Stamnes M.A. Rothman J.E. Science. 1996; 273: 1396-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 20Schimmoller F. Singer-Kruger B. Schroder S. Kruger U. Barlowe C. Riezman H.

However, no specific cargo proteins for p24A have been identified so far (22Carney G.E. Bowen N.J. Biol. Cell. 2004; 96: 271-278Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, data from Caenorhabditis elegans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae implicate that p24A functions as quality control in the early secretory pathway but might not directly mediate cargo protein sorting (23Wen C. Greenwald I. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1165-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 24Springer S. Chen E. Duden R. Marzioch M. Rowley A. Hamamoto S. Merchant S. Schekman R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4034-4039Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Therefore, the precise functions of p24A are still a puzzle. Here we show for the first time that a GPCR, PAR-2, can be identified as a specific cargo protein of p24A. Moreover, we determined the interaction domains on both partner proteins. Importantly, studies on the physiological function of the interaction revealed that p24A regulates exocytic trafficking of PAR-2 from the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane. p24A serves in the biosynthetic pathway as a signal-dependent retention and release component to control subsequent receptor resensitization, which is initiated by activation of the small GTPase ARF1. Our findings provide novel functional insights into the physiological role of p24A, and also elucidate a molecular mechanism underlying PAR-2 resensitization. Plasmid Constructs—The FLAG tag (DYKDDDDK) followed by trypsin cleavage site of human PAR-2 amplified by PCR was cloned into pEAK-HA (hemagglutinin epitope) vector, and then the proopiomelanocortin signal sequence was introduced to the N terminus of the FLAG-PAR-2 fusion construct. pVL1392-EL2-GST, pcDNA-p24Amyc, pEGFP-p24A, and pEGFP-p24A deletion mutants all were constructed by standard PCR cloning. All of the cDNAs were mutated at the stop codon and conjugated with the tag at the C terminus. Primer sequences are available on request. Other constructs have been described previously (25Luo W. Wang Y. Hanck T. Stricker R. Reiser G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7927-7936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). pGEX-VHS-GAT and pGEX-VHS were kindly provided by J. S. Bonifacino (National Institutes of Health). The DNA sequences of plasmid constructs were confirmed to be in-frame by ABI 310 sequencer. Cell Culture and Transfection—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells 293 and primary rat astrocytes were cultured as described (25Luo W. Wang Y. Hanck T. Stricker R. Reiser G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7927-7936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 26Wang Y. Luo W. Stricker R. Reiser G. J. Neurochem. 2006; 98: 1046-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and transfected using magnet-assisted transfection (IBA GmbH, Germany) (4Wang Y. Luo W. Reiser G. Biochem. J. 2007; 401: 65-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 25Luo W. Wang Y. Hanck T. Stricker R. Reiser G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7927-7936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To activate PAR-2, cells were rinsed with Hanks' solution and stimulated with the specific peptide agonist, human PAR-2 AP SLIGKV-NH2 (100 μm, Bachem, for human PAR-2), or with the most potent peptide agonist 2-furoyl-LIGRLO-NH2 (50 μm, Bachem, for rat PAR-2) in serum-free medium. To prevent receptor resensitization, cells were pretreated with 10 μg/ml brefeldin A (Calbiochem) for 30 min prior to agonist stimulation. Protein-Protein Interaction in Vitro and in Vivo—To detect protein interaction in vitro, we performed the glutathione S-transferase (GST) pulldown assay (25Luo W. Wang Y. Hanck T. Stricker R. Reiser G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7927-7936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Cell extracts containing Myc-tagged p24A or green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged p24A derivatives were incubated overnight with GST fusion protein of PAR-2 derivatives immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare), followed by Western blot analysis with anti-Myc antibody (Invitrogen) or anti-GFP antibody (Cell Signaling Technology). Immunoprecipitation was also carried out as described (25Luo W. Wang Y. Hanck T. Stricker R. Reiser G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7927-7936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) to test protein interaction in vivo. Cell extracts were incubated overnight with antibodies indicated in the presence of protein A-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) or protein G-agarose beads (Sigma), followed by Western blot analysis with anti-Myc antibody (Invitrogen), anti-HA antibody (Cell Signaling Technology), or anti-PAR-2 (C-17) antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunofluorescence—Immunofluorescence analysis was carried out by using an LSM510 confocal laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss, Germany) (25Luo W. Wang Y. Hanck T. Stricker R. Reiser G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7927-7936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Detailed protocols are described in the Supplemental Material. siRNA—siRNA-based p24A knockdown, performed using magnet-assisted transfection (IBA GmbH, Germany) in HEK293-PAR-2-HA cells (25Luo W. Wang Y. Hanck T. Stricker R. Reiser G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7927-7936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), was evaluated by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and Western blot at 48 h after transfection. p24A siRNA labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 (5′-CCGGAUGUCCACCAUGACUdTdT-3′) was designed based on the mRNA sequence (GenBank™ accession number X92098) and synthesized by Qiagen. ARF1 ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool siRNA containing four individual siRNAs that target different regions of ARF1 open reading frame was obtained from Dharmacon (5′-UGACAGAGAGCGUGUGAAC-3′;5′-CGGCCGAGAUCACAGACAA-3′;5′-ACGAUCCUCUACAAGCUUA-3′;5′-GAACCAGAAGUGAACGCGA-3′). Control siRNA labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 (5′-UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGUdTdT-3′), which could not target any genes, was obtained from Qiagen. Cellular ARF1-GTPase Assay—Recombinant fusion proteins GST-VHS-GAT and GST-VHS as well as GST were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 cells, extracted in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100) supplemented with 1 mg/ml lysozyme (Sigma) and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics; one tablet per 50 ml), and purified with glutathione-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare). Primary rat astrocytes were treated with 50 μm 2-furoyl-LIGRLO-NH2 for the indicated times and lysed in modified RIPA buffer (26Wang Y. Luo W. Stricker R. Reiser G. J. Neurochem. 2006; 98: 1046-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The resulting cell lysates were incubated overnight with equal amounts of GST fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads, followed by Western blot with anti-ARF1 antibody (Epitomics). Total levels of each ARF1 in 2% of whole cell lysates used for precipitation were also determined by Western blot. Calcium Imaging—PAR-2-induced intracellular calcium mobilization in single cells was determined using the calcium-sensitive fluorescent dye Fura-2 AM (2 μm) (27Luo W. Wang Y. Reiser G. Brain Res. 2005; 1047: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Cells expressing GFP or GFP-tagged truncated p24As were chosen by the fluorescence microscope at 460-nm excitation wavelength. Statistical Analysis—Data were expressed as mean ± S.E. Differences within multiple groups were examined by one-way analysis of variance. p < 0.05 was considered significant. Analysis of the Interaction of PAR-2 with p24A—In a profile search for PAR-2-interacting proteins in the yeast two-hybrid system, we used human PAR-2 as bait (25Luo W. Wang Y. Hanck T. Stricker R. Reiser G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7927-7936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). There we identified p24A (residues 43-181, GenBank™ accession number X92098), a type I transmembrane protein of the early secretory pathway, to interact with PAR-2. To confirm the finding from the yeast system, we then performed the co-immunoprecipitation assay in transfected HEK293 cells co-expressing PAR-2-HA and p24Amyc. PAR-2-HA was precipitated by anti-HA antibody from transfected HEK293 cell lysates, and the interaction of PAR-2-HA with p24A was analyzed by Western blot using the anti-Myc antibody. As shown in Fig. 1A, p24A was specifically immunoprecipitated by PAR-2-HA in HEK293-PAR-2-HA + p24Amyc cells (lane 6) but not in the negative control wild-type HEK293 cells (lane 4) and HEK293-p24Amyc cells (lane 5). The nitrocellulose membrane was reprobed with the anti-HA antibody to confirm the specificity of the immunoprecipitation of PAR-2-HA. These results suggest that p24A interacts with PAR-2 within cells. Next, we asked whether the interaction of PAR-2 with p24A could occur in a relevant physiological system and whether this interaction was species-specific. We performed immunoprecipitation experiments with anti-p24A antibody in primary rat astrocytes. The interaction between PAR-2 and p24A was determined by Western blot using the anti-PAR-2 antibody. As shown in Fig. 1B, the anti-p24A antibody strongly precipitated PAR-2 from rat astrocytes (lane 2), whereas the control antibody (IgG) did not (lane 1). Immunoprecipitation by anti-PAR-2 antibody from rat astrocyte lysates served as positive control (Fig. 1B, lane 3). Similar results were also observed in analogous experiments carried out with primary rat cortical neurons (Fig. 1C). These results confirm the existence of an endogenous interaction between PAR-2 and p24A in a native system. Moreover, this interaction is not restricted to the human proteins. Analysis of the Domains of PAR-2 and p24A Responsible for the Interaction—To map the domain of PAR-2 responsible for the interaction with p24A, we next performed in vitro GST pulldown assays. Wild-type and truncated PAR-2-GST fusion proteins, which are depicted in Fig. 2A, were generated in Sf9 cells and purified by glutathione-Sepharose beads. Either wild-type or truncated PAR-2-GST fusion proteins on glutathione-Sepharose beads were further incubated overnight with the lysate of HEK293 cells expressing p24Amyc, and then the precipitates were analyzed for p24Amyc by Western blot using the anti-Myc antibody. As shown in Fig. 2B, p24A interacted with both PAR-2Δ(246-397)-GST (Δ(246-397)) and PAR-2Δ(1-213)-GST (Δ(1-213)) with binding capacities comparable with that of the wild-type PAR-2-GST (WT). The lack of interaction of p24A with GST confirmed the specificity of the precipitation (Fig. 2B). Because p24A is an intracellular protein, it is primarily thought that the intracellular loops and the carboxyl tail (C-tail) of the receptor would be required for the interaction. Therefore, we tested the interaction of p24A with the intracellular loops and the C-tail of PAR-2 in the GST pulldown assay. Interestingly, all the intracellular loops and the C-tail of PAR-2 failed to interact with p24A (Fig. 2C). Instead, we made the astonishing discovery that the second extracellular loop of PAR-2 (EL2) strongly interacted with p24A (Fig. 2D). Next, we determined the domain of p24A responsible for the interaction with PAR-2 in the GST pulldown assay. The wild-type and a series of truncated p24A-GFP fusion proteins were constructed and expressed in HEK293 cells, as depicted in Fig. 2E. Cell extracts containing the various p24A derivatives were incubated overnight with the wild-type PAR-2-GST immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads. Subsequent Western blot analysis, using the anti-GFP antibody, demonstrated that deletion of the N-terminal luminal part of p24A (ΔN) completely abolished the interaction with PAR-2-GST in the GST pulldown assay (Fig. 2F). However, proteins with C-terminal deletion (ΔC) and deletions of both the transmembrane domain and the C-terminal domain (ΔCT) in either case efficiently interacted with PAR-2-GST (Fig. 2F). The lack of interaction of PAR-2-GST with GFP confirmed the specificity of precipitation (Fig. 2F). These data strongly suggest that the N terminus of p24A is required for the interaction with PAR-2. The Golgi dynamics (GOLD) domain located at the N terminus of p24A is supposed to bind to cargo proteins (28Anantharaman V. Aravind L. Genome Biol. 2002; 3 (research0023)Google Scholar). Thus, we further tested whether the GOLD domain is involved in the interaction with PAR-2 in the GST pulldown assay. As expected, p24AΔGOLD-GFP (ΔG) failed to interact with PAR-2 (Fig. 2G, Pull-down), suggesting that the GOLD domain is required for the interaction with PAR-2. However, the single GOLD domain (G) only weakly bound to PAR-2 (Fig. 2G). Therefore, the GOLD domain is necessary but not sufficient to interact with PAR-2. Further experiments demonstrated that p24A-GL-GFP (GL), which contains the GOLD domain and a neighboring linker, indeed strongly interacted with PAR-2 (Fig. 2G, Pull-down). Identical results were also observed when we used PAR-2EL2-GST in the GST pulldown assay, showing that p24A-GL-GFP directly bound to the second extracellular loop of PAR-2 (supplemental Fig. 1). Therefore, these findings clearly demonstrate that p24A-GL (residues 1-105) is responsible for the interaction with PAR-2. Taken together, our data show that the N-terminal region of p24A (residues 1-105) specifically interacts with the second extracellular loop (EL2) of PAR-2. p24A Interacts with PAR-2 at the Golgi Apparatus—To localize the interaction of PAR-2 with p24A in the cells, we next performed in vivo immunofluorescence staining in co-transfected HEK293 cells. Using the antibody against HA, PAR-2-HA was predominantly detected at the plasma membrane and located in intracellular stores as well (Fig. 3A). By staining with the anti-Myc antibody, p24Amyc was shown to be distributed in the cytosol but strongly located at the Golgi apparatus (Fig. 3B), as revealed by co-localization with the Golgi apparatus marker GM130 (Fig. 3C) in the merged picture (Fig. 3D). The merged image clearly shows that p24A closely co-localized with the intracellular PAR-2, but not with the cell-surface receptor (Fig. 3D, indicated by arrowheads). Moreover, GM130 staining demonstrates that GM130 additionally co-localized with the intracellular PAR-2 and p24A (Fig. 3D, indicated by arrowheads). Therefore, these data clearly indicate that the interaction of PAR-2 with p24A occurs at the Golgi apparatus. In further experiments we used p24A small interfering RNA (siRNA). p24A siRNA was shown to specifically knock down p24A mRNA and protein expression. The levels were reduced by ∼60% in HEK293-PAR-2-HA cells (Fig. 4A). Immunostaining demonstrated that p24A knockdown completely eliminated the intracellular PAR-2 but had no effect on cell-surface receptors (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, we found that GM130 staining became diffuse in the cytosol in p24A-deficient HEK293-PAR-2-HA cells (Fig. 4B, arrowheads), indicating that the Golgi apparatus was disrupted by p24A knockdown. However, p24A knockdown had no effect on the organization of the ER, as shown by staining with the ER marker BiP (Fig. 4B). These results reveal that p24A is a crucial structural component of the Golgi apparatus. The redistribution of the intracellular PAR-2 might be due to the disruption of the structure of the Golgi apparatus by p24A siRNA. ARF1 Regulates the Interaction of PAR-2 with p24A—To examine the functional significance of the interaction, we evaluated whether activation of PAR-2 affects the interaction with p24A. As shown by the co-immunoprecipitation experiment in Fig. 5A, the precipitation of p24A was significantly reduced at 30 min after stimulation with the specific peptide agonist of PAR-2, the human PAR-2 AP, compared with that in unstimulated cells (0 min). The reduction in interaction was similarly observed at 60 min after receptor activation (Fig. 5A). The data summarized in the plot demonstrate that activation of PAR-2 significantly reduced the interaction with p24A by 64% at 30 min and by 57% at 60 min, respectively (Fig. 5A). Similar results were observed in HEK293-PAR-2-HA + p24Amyc cells treated with the PAR-2 agonist protease trypsin (data not shown). Therefore, these data indicate that p24A is dissociated from PAR-2 after receptor activation. Next, we asked by which mechanisms the cell-surface PAR-2 signals are transmitted to p24A, to induce protein dissociation from PAR-2 after receptor activation. p24A is able to interact with inactive ARF1-GDP (12Contreras I. Ortiz-Zapater E. Aniento F. Plant J. 2004; 38: 685-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 16Majoul I. Straub M. Hell S.W. Duden R. Soling H.D. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 139-153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), and activation of ARF1 would initiate transport vesicle assembly and cargo packaging, thereby resulting in protein trafficking along the secretory pathway (17D'Souza-Schorey C. Chavrier P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that activated ARF1 might regulate protein dissociation between PAR-2 and p24A. To test this assumption, rat astrocytes were stimulated with rat PAR-2 AP (50 μm) for the indicated time periods (Fig. 5B), and then cell lysates were used to measure the activated ARF1. The latter was precipitated specifically by GST-VHS-GAT in a GST pulldown assay. The GAT domain of GGA3 (Golgilocalized, γ ear-containing ARF-binding protein 3) has been shown to specifically interact with the activated ARF1 (29Dell'Angelica E.C. Puertollano R. Mullins C. Aguilar R.C. Vargas J.D. Hartnell L.M. Bonifacino J.S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 81-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) and can thus serve as a tool to demonstrate ARF1 activation. Activation of PAR-2 by PAR-2 AP time-dependently induced ARF1 activation in rat astrocytes (Fig. 5B). The maximal activation of ARF1 was observed at 20 min after stimulation with PAR-2 AP (summary in Fig. 5B), which was an early event prior to protein dissociation between PAR-2 and p24A. GST-VHS, the domain of GGA3 with no ARF1 binding, and GST were not able to pull down ARF1-GTP (Fig. 5B), confirming the specificity of precipitation by the GAT domain. Therefore, these data clearly demonstrate that ARF1 can be activated after stimulation with PAR-2 agonists. To further study whether activated ARF1 initiates protein dissociation between PAR-2 and p24A after receptor activation, we tested the effect of brefeldin A on the interaction of PAR-2 with p24A. Brefeldin A is an inhibitor of the guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and can prevent ARF1 activation within cells (30Morinaga N. Adamik R. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17417-17423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To this aim, HEK293-PAR-2-HA + p24Amyc cells were pretreated with brefeldin A, followed by human PAR-2 AP stimulation. Here we found that brefeldin A completely prevented protein dissociation of p24A from PAR-2 after PAR-2 activation, both at 30 and 60 min (Fig. 5C), indicating that activation of ARF1 results in protein dissociation of PAR-2 from p24A. When the cell-surface PAR-2 has been activated and internalized, the intracellular PAR-2 should be triggered to be sorted to the plasma membrane for receptor resensitization. Brefeldin A has been shown previously to inhibit PAR-2 resensitization ("

Homozygous knockouts of FEN-1 in mice are lethal to embryos (for review, see Refs. 1Henneke G. Kim E. Hubscher U. Trends Biochem.

T4 rnh deletion mutants give no phage production and accumulate unligated, lagging strand fragments in Escherichia coli hosts with defective polymerase I 5′ nuclease (6Hobbs L.J. Kim N.G. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6772-6777Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the mutants are hypersensitive to UV irradiation and anti-tumor agents (7Woodworth D.L. Kim K.N. Genetics. 1996; 143: 1081-1090Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).FEN-1 family nuclease activities are modulated by interactions with DNA replication clamps (e.g. eukaryotic proliferating cell nuclear antigen and T4 gene 45 clamp) and single-stranded DNA-binding proteins (e.g. eukaryotic replication protein A and T4 gene 32 protein) (5Bhagwat M.

T4 32 protein, binding on single-stranded DNA behind the nuclease, increases its processivity so that about 10-50 short oligonucleotides are removed in a single binding event (5Bhagwat M. Kim L.J. Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28523-28530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). On nicked substrates, T4 RNase H is stimulated by the T4 replication clamp but not by 32 protein (9Gangisetty O. Kim C.E. Bhagwat M. Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12876-12887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The interaction of T4 RNase H with 32 protein is largely responsible for the maturation of lagging strand fragments in the T4 replication system in vitro and T4 phage production in vivo (9Gangisetty O. Kim C.E. Bhagwat M. Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12876-12887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The primers are normally removed, whereas the single-stranded DNA covered by 32 protein is still between the nuclease and the polymerase that extends the adjacent fragment. The clamp likely serves a backup function, allowing the nuclease to be loaded on nicked molecules that are formed when polymerase completes synthesis of the next fragment but before RNase H removes the primer. The T4 mechanism is different from current models for the maturation of lagging strand fragments in eukaryotes. In the latter, strand displacement synthesis by polymerase δ creates flaps that are removed mainly by the FEN-1 flap endonuclease, a reaction stimulated by the proliferating cell nuclear antigen clamp (17Ayyagari R.

In the present report, we describe the 3.0-Å x-ray analysis of an active site mutant of T4 RNase H co-crystallized with a fork DNA ligand. This is the first structure of a FEN-1 enzyme containing a branched DNA substrate in its active site. No major conformational changes were detected in the protein structure upon binding of the DNA molecule. The crystal structure of the enzyme-substrate complex clearly delineates the arrangement of T4 RNase H, T4 32 protein, and the T4 45 clamp on the lagging strand and provides insight into the range of specificities displayed by individual members of the FEN-1 family of proteins.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein Expression and Purification—Recombinant native T4 RNase H (pNN2202) and the inactive D132N mutant (pNN2202-D132N) (29Bhagwat M.

Cells were grown in 6 liters of Luria-Bertani broth with 45 μg/ml ampicillin to an A600 of 0.6 (37 °C), induced with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h, harvested by centrifugation, and pellets were stored at -20 °C. Cells were suspended in 10 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 m NH4Cl, 10 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, and 0.3% polyethyleneimine) per gram of cell pellet, lysed using sonication, and centrifuged (20,000 × g, 4 °C, 30 min). Conductivity of the samples was reduced by dilution using buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) for each chromatographic step. Lysates were loaded onto a 50-ml SP-Sepharose column (SP Fast Flow, Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with SP buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NH4Cl, and 10 mm MgCl2) and eluted at ∼300 mm NaCl using SP buffer B (SP buffer A containing 0.75 m NaCl). Pooled fractions were loaded onto a 10-ml ceramic hydroxyapatite column (Bio-Rad Macro-Prep Type II) equilibrated with HA buffer A (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 1% glycerol) and then eluted with HA buffer B (HA buffer A plus 1 m (NH4)2SO4). Pooled HA fractions were loaded onto a 25-ml POROS HS column (Applied Biosystems) equilibrated with SP buffer A and eluted using SP buffer B; the protein was displaced at ∼350 mm NaCl. The purified proteins were concentrated by centrifugation (Millipore Amicon Ultra, 10,000 molecular weight cutoff), cryo-protected with 20% glycerol, and stored as aliquots of 1 ml at -80 °C.Preparation of Oligonucleotides—Oligonucleotides containing 18 and 24 bases to act as fork DNA substrate were designed according to previously reported sequences (30Harrington J.J. Kim M.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1235-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). High performance liquid chromatography-purified oligonucleotides (IDT, Coralville, IA) were dissolved in buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl) to a final concentration of 5 mm. Annealed fork substrates were prepared by first mixing 1:1 molar ratios of two partially complementary DNA strands in 0.5-ml Eppendorf tubes. These tubes were placed in hot water (95 °C), slow-cooled to room temperature overnight, moved to 4 °C, and then stored at -20 °C. Samples of fork DNA substrates used in the crystallization experiments were a 12-base complementary duplex, a 6-base 5′ arm, and a 12-base 3′ arm (Scheme 1).Mobility Shift Assays—Oligonucleotides were 5′ end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays were carried out as described by Jones et al. (31Jones C.E. Kim T.C. Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12067-12075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures were prepared containing 25 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, 60 mm potassium acetate, 20 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. Aliquots of 5 μl of the reaction mixture were made containing 2 nm 5′ 32P linear and fork DNAs, as shown in Fig. 1A. The aliquots were incubated at 30 °C for 1 min, and enzyme D132N T4 RNase H was added to give concentrations of 0, 10, 30, or 90 nm. The solutions were kept at 30 °C for an additional 5 min. The protein-DNA complexes were separated on 6% DNA retardation gels (Invitrogen).FIGURE 1Binding and digestion of linear, fork, and flap DNA by T4 RNase H.

Reaction mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 1 min before the addition of wild type RNase H for 30 s. Products were separated on a 15% polyacrylamide (19:1), 7 m urea denaturing gel. Gels were exposed to Kodak Biomax MR film. DNA sizing ladders were produced by digesting the 32P-labeled 18-mer in the RNase H nuclease reaction buffer with snake venom phosphodiesterase (Worthington Biochemical Corp.) for 2 min at 30 °C or DNA polymerase I, large Klenow fragment (New England Biolabs) for 10 min at the same temperature.Crystallization of D132N T4 RNase H with Fork DNA Substrate—Purified D132N RNase H was dialyzed at 4 °C against 25 mm Bis-Tris, pH 6.5, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NH4Cl, concentrated to 20 mg/ml (Millipore Amicon Ultra, 10,000 molecular weight cutoff), and mixed in an equimolar ratio with fork DNA substrate (10 mg/ml protein). Sparse matrix screening at 23 °C (Emerald BioStructures, Inc.) yielded crystals that were optimized by hanging drop vapor diffusion of droplets composed initially of 2 μl of protein, 4 μl of water, and 2 μl of the well solution. The latter consisted of 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 18% polyethylene glycol 2000 monomethyl ether (MME), and 20% glucose.Data Collection and Processing—Crystals for data collection were flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen, and diffraction data were collected at 100 K on a Rigaku FR-E High Brilliance x-ray generator (copper anode) interfaced with a Saturn 92 CCD detector (The Ohio Macromolecular Crystallography Consortium, The University of Toledo, Toledo, OH). Analysis of the x-ray data indicated that the enzyme-substrate complex crystallized in the orthorhombic space group P212121, with cell dimensions a = 68.16 Å, b = 84.99 Å, and c = 89.29 Å (Table 1). Data, which extended to 3.0 Å resolution, were processed with CrystalClear (Version 1.3.5, Rigaku MSC). Crystal statistics are presented in Table 1. Attempts to collect higher resolution data were unsuccessful. The Matthews coefficient of 2.7 and the solvent content of 53.4% indicated that the crystallographic asymmetric unit consisted of one D132N RNase H molecule and one bound 18/24 fork DNA ligand (32Matthews B.W.

Several rounds of model building and refinements allowed us to fit the nucleotides of the fork DNA substrate, typically adding a few nucleotides after each refinement. Refinements were carried out with CNS (35Brunger A.T. Kim P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T.

The complete 12-bp duplex, five bases of the 5′ arm (PDB chain C) and five bases of the 3′ arm (PDB chain D) were visible in the final model. Disorder prevented modeling of the remaining bases. Molecular figures of the enzyme and its DNA ligand were displayed and rendered with the program PyMOL. The enzyme-substrate complex was superimposed on the native T4 RNase H and on the Afu FEN-1 structures (PDB code 1RXW) (23Chapados B.R. Kim D.J. Han S. Qiu J. Yelent B. Shen B. Tainer J.A.

Atomic coordinates and structure factors have been deposited.RESULTST4 RNase H DNA Complexes and Nuclease Activity—Fig. 1A illustrates the analyses of linear and fork DNA substrates by electrophoretic mobility shift assay to identify the smallest DNA fragment that could form a tight complex with T4 RNase H. Successful candidates contained a 12-base duplex with varying lengths of non-complementary 5′ and 3′ arms. Gel shift assays indicated that a 6-base 5′ arm and a 12-base 3′ arm (the 18/24 fork substrate) are required for formation of stable binary complexes. Binding is not improved by the introduction of a 3′ duplex arm (data not shown) or the lengthening of the 3′ arm to 18 bases or an extension of the 5′ arm to 12 bases. Binding is abrogated in the absence of a 5′ arm.Hydrolysis of the 18/24 fork DNA primarily released a 7-mer single-stranded DNA fragment from the 5′ arm, with the cut site located one base into the duplex region near the branch point (Fig. 1B). Lower amounts of the 5- and 8-mers and traces of the 6-mer were also found. In contrast to the FEN-1 enzymes, which exhibit a preference for a double-flap DNA substrate with a short 5′ arm and a single 3′ overhanging base at the branch point (39Kaiser M.W. Kim N. Ma W. Miller C. Neri B. Fors L. Lyamichev V.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21387-21394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), T4 RNase H normally shows preference for single-flap and pseudo-Y (fork) substrates (5Bhagwat M. Kim L.J. Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28523-28530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Although catalytic activity seems opposite to what is usually observed for FEN-1 enzymes, the cleaving specificity of T4 RNase H on these three substrates is the same as that displayed by FEN-1 enzymes (30Harrington J.J. Kim M.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1235-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 40Qiu J. Kim R. Chapados B.R. Sherman M. Tainer J.A. Shen B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24394-24402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In our assays (Fig. 1C), T4 RNase H released mostly 19- and 21-base nucleotides from the single flap substrates, cleaving the flap strand on either side of the branch point but not at the branch point (20-base nucleotide product). Activity on double-flap substrate released 21 bases (one base into the duplex region), creating a nicked product identical to those generated by FEN-1 enzymes (Fig. 1C). However, the amount of hydrolysis was much lower for this substrate compared with the two other substrates (fork and single flap).Structure of T4 RNase H Bound to a Fork DNA Substrate—The two hydrated magnesium ions of the native enzyme, Mg1 and Mg2, are coordinated through water to the cluster of conserved acidic residues, with Mg1 having inner-sphere coordination to Asp-132 (21Mueser T.C. Kim N.G. Hyde C.C. Cell. 1996; 85: 1101-1112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Any Asp to Asn mutation of residues coordinated to Mg1 (Asp-19, Asp-71, Asp-132, and Asp-155) eliminates nuclease activity. In contrast, similar substitutions of residues coordinated to Mg2 (Glu-130, Asp-157, and Asp-200) only reduce the nuclease activity of T4 RNase H (29Bhagwat M. Kim D. Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28531-28538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).Early attempts to co-crystallize chelated native enzyme with DNA substrates failed to produce any crystals. However, using the D132N mutation to eliminate catalytic activity, crystals were obtained of the enzyme in complex with 18/24 branched DNA substrate. Data collection and refinement statistics are shown in Table 1. These statistics are comparable with other crystal structures of protein-DNA complexes that have been solved at similar resolution. Initial phases were obtained using molecular replacement of the protein model alone. A stereo image of the initial Fo - Fc electron density map is presented in Fig. 2A showing the density in the region of the DNA using phases obtained from the protein alone. Initially, a double-stranded 6-mer was manually positioned in this electron density with additional nucleotides added as phases improved. D132N T4 RNase H consists of residues 1-305, of which residues 91-96 are missing in the bridge region of the refined structure. The 18/24 fork DNA is modeled as a 17/17 fork DNA, with a double-stranded 12-mer and two 5-mer single-stranded arms. The final 2Fo - Fc electron density map is presented in Fig. 2B. The first base of the 5′ arm and the last seven bases of the 3′ arm are disordered. The entire 12-mer duplex belongs to the B-form of DNA with all Watson-Crick base pairs intact, including the base pair at the branch point. The 5′ arm traverses the active site cleft and continues in a direction perpendicular to the 12-mer duplex helical axis (Fig. 2C), whereas the 3′ arm follows a path parallel to the duplex region toward the C terminus of the protein (Fig. 2D and supplemental movie 2D associated with Fig. 2D).FIGURE 2Structure of T4 RNase H bound to branched DNA. A, stereo view of the initial Fo - Fc electron density map contoured at 1.5 σ after molecular replacement and simulated annealing (CNS) of the protein alone. This difference Fourier with calculated structure factor amplitudes and phases deriving only from the refined protein shows interpretable density for the DNA. For clarity, only the electron density in the region of the DNA substrate is shown in panels A and B. B, stereo view of the final 2Fo - Fc electron density map contoured at 1.0 σ is shown with the refined coordinates of the fork DNA. The density for the 3′ arm, refined at half occupancy, does not appear at this contour level (see “Results”). C, stereo view of a ribbon diagram of T4 RNase H (light gray) is shown with the modeled portion of the 18/24 fork DNA substrate (5′ arm, cyan;3′ arm, magenta). The 5′ arm lies across the active site below the disordered bridge (gray spheres). Helix H1, the residues shown in red (part of helix H4), and the S5-H7 loop make specific interactions with the 5′ arm and the branch point. Active site residues associated with magnesium binding are dark blue. The 3′ DNA arm (magenta) extends past the C terminus of the protein. The double-stranded 12-mer DNA is bound to the HhH2 motif (orange), which includes helices H7 and H8 and the extended loop between them. D, surface rendering of the T4 RNase H enzyme bound to the 18/24 fork DNA substrate. The colors are the same as in panels C, E, and F.

Proteins injected into the host cell by Salmonella activate the Rho GTPases, Rac1 and Cdc42, to induce actin polymerization. Following uptake, a different set of proteins inactivates Rac1 and Cdc42, returning the cytoskeleton to normal. Although the signaling pathways allowing Salmonella to invade host cells are beginning to be understood, many of the contributing factors remain to be elucidated. IQGAP1 is a multidomain protein that influences numerous cellular functions, including modulation of Rac1/Cdc42 signaling and actin polymerization. Here, we report that IQGAP1 regulates Salmonella invasion. Through its interaction with actin, IQGAP1 co-localizes with Rac1, Cdc42, and actin at sites of bacterial uptake, whereas infection promotes the interaction of IQGAP1 with both Rac1 and Cdc42. Knockdown of IQGAP1 significantly reduces Salmonella invasion and abrogates activation of Cdc42 and Rac1 by Salmonella. Overexpression of IQGAP1 significantly increases the ability of Salmonella to enter host cells and required interaction with both actin and Cdc42/Rac1. Together, these data identify IQGAP1 as a novel regulator of Salmonella invasion.

Together, these data identify IQGAP1 as a novel regulator of Salmonella invasion. Salmonella continues to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, causing food poisoning and typhoid fever. Using a highly intricate system, Salmonella is able to hijack the actin regulatory machinery of the host cell to promote bacterial entry. To do this, Salmonella uses a type III secretion system to inject a battery of effector proteins into the host cell (reviewed in Ref. 1Patel J.C. Rossanese O.W. Galan J.E. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2005; 26: 564-570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).

HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). To generate stable IQGAP1 knockdown cells, siIQ5 or siIQ8 sequences cloned into the retroviral vector pSuper (25Mataraza J.M. Briggs M.W. Li Z. Entwistle A. Ridley A.J. Sacks D.B. J. Biol.

HeLa cells were infected with the viral vectors for 48 h and allowed to express for a further 48 h. Cells were then cultured in medium containing 2 μg/ml puromycin to select for incorporation of the construct. After 2 weeks, HeLa cells with stable incorporation of the siRNA were obtained. Cells were transiently transfected with 5 μg of DNA using Lipo-fectamine2000 (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were derived from control or IQGAP1 knock-out mice and immortalized as described (17Ren J.G. Li Z. Sacks D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 10465-10469Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). MEFs were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Bacterial Quantification—Bacteria were quantified by serial dilution (29Steele-Mortimer O. Meresse S. Gorvel J.P. Toh B.H. Finlay B.B. Cell Microbiol. 1999; 1: 33-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Bacteria were grown for 16 h at 37 °C with shaking and then subcultured at a dilution of 1:10 (1 ml in 10 ml) in fresh Luria-Bertani broth (Sigma) and incubated at 37 °C with shaking until an optical density (at 600 nm) of 0.5 was reached. The culture was serially diluted and plated in triplicate onto Mac-Conkey agar (Remel Inc.) and incubated at 37 °C overnight. By quantifying the colony-forming units, the number of Salmonella present per ml of culture was determined, allowing the appropriate m.o.i. to be added to cultured cells. Gentamicin Protection Assay—Salmonella invasion was analyzed using a gentamicin protection assay (29Steele-Mortimer O. Meresse S. Gorvel J.P. Toh B.H. Finlay B.B. Cell Microbiol. 1999; 1: 33-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Following infection for 40 min with Salmonella (m.o.i. of 20 for HeLa and 30 for MEFs), cells were extensively washed with PBS. Cells were then cultured in medium containing 50 μg/ml gentamicin for 2 h to kill extracellular bacteria. After additional washes, cells were lysed in 100 μl of 1% Triton X-100 for 5 min at 22 °C. The number of bacteria was quantified by serial dilution, as described above. Immunocytochemical Analysis of Salmonella Invasion—Immunocytochemical quantification of invasion was performed essentially as described (7Patel J.C. Galan J.E. J.

Briefly, cells were infected for 40 min (HeLa) or 1 h (MEFs) and then cultured in gentamicin for 2 h. After extensive washing, cells were fixed. To detect extracellular bacteria, cells were incubated with anti-Salmonella antibodies without permeabilization followed by Alexa Fluor 488-labeled anti-rabbit secondary antibody, both for 1 h at 22 °C. Cells were washed and permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100, 3% bovine serum albumin/PBS for 1 h at 22 °C. Following permeabilization, cells were incubated for a second time with anti-Salmonella antibody (1 h at 22 °C) followed by Alexa Fluor 546-labeled anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1 h at 22 °C) to detect total Salmonella. For cells transfected with GFP-tagged IQGAP1 constructs, anti-GFP monoclonal antibodies were added during the second anti-Salmonella antibody incubation. The number of GFP-positive cells containing one or more intracellular bacteria was counted by fluorescent microscopy. Results were obtained from three separate experiments, each performed in quadruplicate. Over 700 cells were counted for GFP transfection, whereas between 100 and 200 cells were counted for transfections of GFP-tagged IQGAP1 constructs. Rac1 and Cdc42 GTPase Assays—Assays were performed essentially as described (24Swart-Mataraza J.M. Li Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol.

Equal amounts of protein lysate were incubated with GST-PAK-CRIB (for Rac1 and Cdc42) or GST-WASP-GBD (for Cdc42) for 3 h at 4 °C. Glutathione beads were used to pull down complexes of WASP-GBD with GTP-bound Cdc42 or PAK-CRIB with GTP-bound Rac1 and Cdc42 and washed in buffer A. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and probed for Cdc42 or Rac1, as indicated. Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism. One-way ANOVA tests or Student's t tests were used where appropriate, as indicated. IQGAP1 Localizes to Sites of Salmonella Invasion—To determine whether IQGAP1 is involved in Salmonella invasion, we first examined the localization of IQGAP1 during infection. Endogenous IQGAP1 is diffusively distributed throughout the cytoplasm of HeLa cells, with accumulation at the cell periphery (Fig. 1A, green). This distribution is similar to that documented with other cells (25Mataraza J.M. Briggs M.W. Li Z. Entwistle A. Ridley A.J. Sacks D.B. J. Biol.

IQGAP1 co-localizes with endogenous actin, Rac1, and Cdc42 around the cell periphery in uninfected HeLa cells (Fig. 1A). A large body of work has shown that actin, Rac1, and Cdc42 all localize at sites of Salmonella invasion (reviewed in Ref. 1Patel J.C. Rossanese O.W. Galan J.E. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2005; 26: 564-570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To examine whether IQGAP1 localizes to the same sites, HeLa cells were infected with wild type S. typhimurium at an m.o.i. of 20 (Fig. 1). Twenty minutes after infection, cells were fixed and stained for endogenous IQGAP1 (green), and actin, Cdc42, or Rac1 (red) and examined by confocal microscopy. Salmonella were identified using 4′, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (blue). In agreement with previous reports (32Chen L.M. Hobbie S. Galan J.E. Science. 1996; 274: 2115-2118Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 34Francis C.L. Ryan T.A. Jones B.D. Smith S.J. Falkow S. Nature. 1993; 364: 639-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar), wild type Salmonella induce the formation of actin-rich phagocytic cups, which also contain Cdc42 and Rac1 (Fig. 1B, red). Analysis of these structures shows that IQGAP1 co-localizes with actin, Rac1, and Cdc42 at sites of Salmonella invasion (Fig. 1B). IQGAP1 also co-localizes with the GEFs SopE and SopE2 at these phagocytic cups (Fig. 1B). In contrast, infection with non-invasive Salmonella HilA- fails to induce formation of the phagocytic cup. Neither IQGAP1, actin, Cdc42, nor Rac1 are enriched in sites of Salmonella HilA- attachment (Fig. 1C). Thus, invasion by Salmonella, not merely attachment of the bacteria, is required to induce redistribution of IQGAP1, actin, Rac1, and Cdc42. IQGAP1 Is Required for Efficient Invasion by Salmonella—To further examine the role of IQGAP1 in Salmonella invasion, we established HeLa cells with stable incorporation of a specific siRNA construct that reduces endogenous IQGAP1 (termed HeLa siIQ8 cells) or a control, non-silencing siRNA construct (termed HeLa siIQ5 cells) (Fig. 2A). (The siRNA oligonucleotides have been described previously (25Mataraza J.M. Briggs M.W. Li Z. Entwistle A. Ridley A.J. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41237-41245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar).) Endogenous IQGAP1 levels are reduced ∼75% in HeLa siIQ8 cells when compared with HeLa siIQ5 or untransfected cells (Fig. 2A). The ability of Salmonella to invade HeLa siIQ5 and HeLa siIQ8 cells was tested using a gentamicin protection invasion assay followed by quantification by serial dilution. The number of intracellular Salmonella is significantly decreased by 33% when endogenous IQGAP1 levels are reduced (Fig. 2B). The magnitude of the reduction is comparable with that observed with knockdown of Rac1 (7Patel J.C. Galan J.E. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 453-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). To validate the data derived from siRNA knockdown of IQGAP1, we tested the ability of Salmonella to invade cells lacking IQGAP1. We used a protocol described by Shi and Casanova (35Shi J. Casanova J.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; : 4698-4708Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to determine Salmonella invasion into MEFs. IQGAP1-null MEFs and MEFs from littermate controls (17Ren J.G. Li Z. Sacks D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 10465-10469Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) were infected with wild type Salmonella at an m.o.i. of 30 for 1 h followed by the addition of gentamicin for 2 h. Salmonella invasion was assessed with an immunocytochemical assay (7Patel J.C. Galan J.E. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 453-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 29Steele-Mortimer O. Meresse S.

Fixed cells were stained for extracellular and total Salmonella. Quantification revealed that the number of intracellular Salmonella in IQGAP1-null MEFs is 77% less than that in MEFs from littermate controls (Fig. 2, C and D). These data confirm that IQGAP1 is required for efficient invasion of host cells by Salmonella. The effect of reducing intracellular IQGAP1 levels on the formation of the phagocytic cup was also examined. HeLa siIQ8 and MEF-/- cells, with the pertinent control cell lines, were infected with Salmonella for 20 min. Immunocytochemistry revealed that the intensity of actin in the phagocytic cup in HeLa siIQ8 cells is less than that in HeLa siIQ5 cells (Fig. 2E). Essentially identical results were obtained with MEFs; actin staining in phagocytic cups of MEF-/- is reduced when compared with MEF+/+ (Fig. 2E). These data suggest that IQGAP1 is required for efficient polymerization of actin at the site of Salmonella invasion. Together these results demonstrate that IQGAP1 is an important component of the signaling processes underlying Salmonella invasion. Salmonella Invasion Promotes the Interaction of IQGAP1 with Rac1 and Cdc42—During host cell invasion by Salmonella, both Rac1 and Cdc42 are activated in response to bacterial effector proteins (1Patel J.C. Rossanese O.W. Galan J.E. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2005; 26: 564-570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 36Pizarro-Cerda J. Cossart P.

HeLa cells were infected with Salmonella for 10 or 20 min, and IQGAP1 was immunoprecipitated. When compared with non-infected cells, the amount of Rac1 and Cdc42 that co-immunoprecipitated with IQGAP1 is significantly increased by 77 and 42%, respectively, 20 min after the addition of Salmonella (Fig. 3). Although there is a small and reproducible increase in co-immunoprecipitation of both GTPases 10 min after the addition of Salmonella, this change is not statistically significant. The total amount of IQGAP1, Rac1, and Cdc42 in the cell lysates is not altered by Salmonella infection (Fig. 3A). These observations are consistent wi"
https://openalex.org/W1966882351,"Ataxin-3, a deubiquitinating enzyme, is the disease protein in spinocerebellar ataxia type 3, one of many neurodegenerative disorders caused by polyglutamine expansion. Little is known about the cellular regulation of ataxin-3. This is an important issue, since growing evidence links disease protein context to pathogenesis in polyglutamine disorders. Expanded ataxin-3, for example, is more neurotoxic in fruit fly models when its active site cysteine is mutated (1). We therefore sought to determine the influence of ataxin-3 enzymatic activity on various cellular properties. Here we present evidence that the catalytic activity of ataxin-3 regulates its cellular turnover, ubiquitination, and subcellular distribution. Cellular protein levels of catalytically inactive ataxin-3 were much higher than those of active ataxin-3, in part reflecting slower degradation. In vitro studies revealed that inactive ataxin-3 was more slowly degraded by the proteasome and that this degradation occurred independent of ubiquitination. Slower degradation of inactive ataxin-3 correlated with reduced interaction with the proteasome shuttle protein, VCP/p97. Enzymatically active ataxin-3 also showed a greater tendency to concentrate in the nucleus, where it colocalized with the proteasome in subnuclear foci. Taken together, these and other findings suggest that the catalytic activity of this disease-linked deubiquitinating enzyme regulates several of its cellular properties, which in turn may influence disease pathogenesis."

Two of these mothers had abnormally increased values for the urate pool, urate turnover, and 24-hour urinary excretion of uric acid. These two mothers also had reduced hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase activity and increased adenine phosphoribosyltransferase activity in erythrocyte lysates. All three mothers showed an abnormal increase in urate production, as judged by the rate of incorporation of glycinie into urate."
https://openalex.org/W1981751137,"Compared with kinases, the role of protein phosphatases in regulating biological functions is less well understood. Here we show that α4, a non-catalytic subunit of the protein phosphatase 2A, plays a major role in the control of cell spreading, migration, and cytoskeletal architecture. Fibroblasts lacking α4 were impaired in their ability to spread and migrate compared with wild-type cells, whereas enforced expression of α4 promoted cell spreading and migration. These effects were not restricted to fibroblasts. Using a T cell-specific α4 transgenic mouse model, increased α4 expression was found to increase lymphocyte motility and chemotaxis. Elevated α4 expression results in an increase in the GTP-bound state of Rac1, and GTP-bound Rac1 was dramatically reduced in α4-deficient cells. A constitutively active mutant of Rac1 rescued the defects of cell spreading and migration caused by α4 deletion, while inhibition of Rac1 blocked the ability of α4 to promote cell migration. Together, these data define a novel role for the protein phosphatase 2A regulatory subunit α4 in the regulation of cell spreading and migration.

Together, these data define a novel role for the protein phosphatase 2A regulatory subunit α4 in the regulation of cell spreading and migration. Cell migration is important in a variety of biological and pathological processes, including embryonic development, wound healing, angiogenesis, inflammation, tumor invasion, and metastasis (1Ridley A.J. Schwartz M.A. Burridge K. Firtel R.A. Ginsberg M.H. Borisy G. Parsons J.T. Horwitz A.R. Science. 2003; 302: 1704-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (3870) Google Scholar). Identifying the genes involved in the regulation of cell migration may lead to a better understanding of how cell migration contributes to these physiologic and pathologic events. It is generally accepted that the driving force for cell movement is provided by the dynamic reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, directing protrusion at the front of the cell and retraction at the rear (2Webb D.J. Parsons J.T. Horwitz A.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E97-E100Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). Cytoskeletal dynamics and cell adhesion are controlled by small GTPases of the Rho family, in particular RhoA, Rac, and Cdc42 (1Ridley A.J. Schwartz M.A. Burridge K. Firtel R.A. Ginsberg M.H. Borisy G. Parsons J.T. Horwitz A.R. Science. 2003; 302: 1704-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (3870) Google Scholar, 3Hall A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2005; 33: 891-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Among these, Rac induces actin polymerization and integrin adhesion complex assembly at the cell periphery, leading to membrane protrusion, and is essential for cell spreading and migration (4Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Nature. 2002; 420: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3875) Google Scholar). The activation of Rac can be mediated by stimulation of both growth factor and integrin receptors and requires GTP/GDP exchange factors (5Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Sondek J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 167-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1327) Google Scholar). Moreover, the cooperative action of other signaling components is required to promote coordinated assembly and disassembly of actin filaments, particularly protein kinases, including focal adhesion kinase, Src, Crk, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and mitogen-activated protein kinase, as has been reviewed elsewhere (6Alahari S.K. Reddig P.J. Juliano R.L. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2002; 220: 145-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In addition to kinases, it has been shown that several protein phosphatases are involved in the regulation of cell migration and spreading, such as phosphatase and tesin homolog (7Tamura M. Gu J. Matsumoto K. Aota S. Parsons R. Yamada K.M. Science. 1998; 280: 1614-1617Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar), Src homology 2-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase-2 (8Yu D.H. Qu C.K.

Unlike kinases, the activity and specificity of serine/threonine phosphatases is governed largely by their associated proteins (11Janssens V. Goris J. Biochem.

The α4 protein, also known as immunoglobulin-binding protein (IgBP1), is a PP2A-, PP4-, and PP6-associated protein. It was initially identified as a component of receptor signal transduction complexes in mammalian B and T lymphocytes and was later determined to be broadly expressed (12Inui S. Kuwahara K. Mizutani J. Maeda K. Kawai T. Nakayasu H. Sakaguchi N. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 2714-2723PubMed Google Scholar, 13Chuang E. Fisher T.S. Morgan R.W. Robbins M.D. Duerr J.M. Vander Heiden M.G.

PP2A is the major soluble serine/threonine phosphatase in mammalian cells and is predominantly found as a trimeric complex formed by the catalytic subunit (PP2Ac), core A scaffolding subunit, and any of the over 12 variable B components. Binding of α4 to PP2Ac displaces PP2Ac from A and B subunits due to an overlap in the binding site on PP2Ac (14Goldberg Y. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 57: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Several groups have reported that interaction of α4 with PP2Ac alters both the enzymatic activity and its substrate specificity (15Murata K. Wu J. Brautigan D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10624-10629Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 16Nanahoshi M. Tsujishita Y. Tokunaga C. Inui S. Sakaguchi N. Hara K. Yonezawa K.

Its yeast homologue, Tap42, is a PP2A regulatory subunit that functions in target of rapamycin (TOR)-dependent nutrient sensing (18Di Como C.J. Arndt K.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1904-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, the association of α4 with PP2A can be regulated by growth factor signals and modulators of the mammalian TOR pathway, such as rapamycin (15Murata K. Wu J. Brautigan D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10624-10629Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 19Kong M. Fox C.J. Mu J. Solt L. Xu A. Cinalli R.M. Birnbaum M.J. Lindsten T. Thompson C.B.

To date, the downstream targets and physiological roles of α4 have not been established. The yeast homologue of α4, Tap42, has been implicated in the distribution of actin via a Rho GTPase-dependent mechanism (21Wang H. Jiang Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3116-3125Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In studying the conditional deletion of α4 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), we observed that the α4-deleted cells adopted an altered morphology, appearing to be less spindle-shaped compared with control fibroblasts. 4M. Kong, unpublished data. This observation prompted us to investigate the role of α4 in cell adhesion and motility in mammalian cells. Using α4 knock-out or overexpressing cells, we demonstrate here that α4 plays a novel role in cell spreading and motility by influencing the activity of the cellular GTPase Rac. The results demonstrate that the protein phosphatase 2A binding partner α4 is a non-redundant regulator of cell spreading and migration. Cell Lines and DNA Constructs—MEFs were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/ml of penicillin, and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin. α4flox-immortalized MEFs stably expressing Bcl-xL were generated and infected as previously described (19Kong M.

Mouse α4 cDNA was generated by reverse transcription PCR using the primers 5′-TGC GAA TTC GCC ACC ATG GAT TAC AAG GAT GAC GAC GAT AAG GCA GCG TCT GAA GAC GAG TTA CTG-3′ and 5′-TGC GGA TCC CTA GCC CAT GTT CTG TCG GTT GCC GTA G-3′. Rac1V12 was a gift from Dr. Margaret M. Chou (University of Pennsylvania) and has been subcloned into the LPC retrovirus vector. Virus was generated and stable cell lines were generated as previously described (19Kong M. Fox C.J. Mu J. Solt L. Xu A. Cinalli R.M. Birnbaum M.J. Lindsten T. Thompson C.B. Science. 2004; 306: 695-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Lentiviral supernatant expressing Cre-estrogen receptor (ER) fusion protein was a gift from Dr. Eric Brown (University of Pennsylvania). Generation of α4 Transgenic Mice and Isolation of T Cells—α4 transgenic mice were generated by oocyte injection of a wild-type α4 transgene with a FLAG tag cloned into the EcoR I-SalI sites of a plasmid containing the CD2 promoter/enhancer, kindly provided by Dr. Paul E. Love (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). T cells were purified by negative selection as described before (22Cinalli R.M. Herman C.E. Lew B.O. Wieman H.L. Thompson C.B. Rathmell J.C. Eur. J. Immunol. 2005; 35: 786-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) (StemCell Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada). Purified T cells were cultured at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Gemini), 10 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen), 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma), and 10 mm HEPES (Invitrogen). Cell Spreading—Fibroblasts were starved in DMEM with 0.1% FBS overnight and collected by trypsinization. Equal numbers of cells were replated onto dishes coated with or without fibronectin (FN) (10 μg/ml). Cells were allowed to spread for the indicated times. Photographs were taken using phase-contrast with a 20× objective (TE300; Nikon). The percentage of spreading cells was then determined. Spread cells were defined as cells with extended processes, lacking a rounded morphology, and not phase-bright, whereas nonspread cells were rounded and phase-bright. Wound Healing Assay—Fibroblasts were grown in 60-mm culture dishes until confluent and were cultured in DMEM containing 0.1% FBS overnight. The cell monolayer was wounded with a linear scratch by a sterile 200-μl pipette tip. The wounded area was defined in each image by positioning lines in correspondence to the original scratch. The same wounded areas were photographed using phase-contrast with a 10× objective at 0 or 6 h after scratch on an inverted microscope (TE300; Nikon) with or without inhibitors. Okadaic acid, fostriecin, and Rac1 inhibitor 553502 were all from Calbiochem. Quantitative analysis of the wound closure was calculated by counting the number of cells per 9 × 104-μm2 wound area at 6 h using Metamorph software. Time-lapse microscopy was performed in the micro-incubator (model CSMI; Harvard Apparatus) with constant 37 °C temperature on an inverted microscope (Nikon Eclipse TE2000-E) equipped with a digital video camera (model Evolution QEi; Media Cybernetics) with 10× objective for 12 h. Images were taken every 5 min in the phase-contrast and were analyzed using Image-Pro Plus 5.1 software (Media Cybernetics). Transwell Cell Migration Assay—Transwell cell migration assay of the fibroblasts was performed using the CHEMICON® QCM™ 24-well Cell Migration Assay kit following user instructions. In brief, cells were cultured overnight in DMEM containing 0.1% FBS. The next day, cells were harvested and resuspended in DMEM containing 5% bovine serum albumin, added (1.5 × 105/300 μl) to the top of each migration chamber with an 8-μm pore size polycarbonate membrane, and allowed to migrate in the presence or absence of 10% serum into the lower chamber. After 3 or 6 h, the inserts were stained with the Cell Stain Solution (Chemicon), and cells that had not migrated were removed using a cotton swab. Migrated cells were then photographed using a microscope (MZ16FA; Leica) equipped with a digital camera (DC 500; Leica). To quantify the number of migrated cells, stained cells were subsequently extracted and detected on a standard microplate reader at 560 nm (Spectra-MAX190; Molecular Devices). For retroviral MIGRI-GFP-Cre-infected cells, non-migrated cells were removed using a cotton swab and the transwell chambers were analyzed by fluorescent microscopy using a microscope (Eclipse E300; Nikon) equipped with a 10× objective. In this way, only fluorescent (green) cells that had migrated were visualized and counted. For the T cell migration assay, purified T cells were cultured overnight before the migration assay. T cell migration was assayed in transwell plates with 5-μm pore size (Costar; Fisher, Atlanta, GA) with 600 μl of medium in the lower chambers with or without 10 ng/ml stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1) and 5 × 105 live T cells in 100 μl added to the upper chambers for 3 h at 37 °C. Cells that migrated to the lower chambers were counted using a hemocytometer. Immunofluorescence—Fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM containing 0.1% FBS for 24 h and replated onto coverslips coated with FN (10 μg/ml). Cells were allowed to spread for 30 min in DMEM containing 10% serum. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized for 10 min in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% Triton X-100. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.02% Triton X-100 and 1.5% FBS, followed by incubation with antibodies against vinculin (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were then incubated with rhodamine red or fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Images were taken using a Nikon E800 fluorescence microscope equipped with a CCD camera at 100× objective, and images were analyzed using the Metamorph software package. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot—Whole cell extracts were prepared either in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails I and II (Sigma-Aldrich) or lysis buffer as described before (23Kong M. Mounier C. Dumas V. Posner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5837-5844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). 20-30 μg of protein was loaded on pre-cast gels and transferred to nitrocellulose. Membranes were blocked with BLOTTO (5% nonfat dry milk and 0.1% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline) and incubated with antibodies against α4 (custom antibody from BIOSOURCE), phospho-Src-Ser-416, p-paxillin (Cell Signaling), actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), hemagglutinin (Roche Applied Science), and Bcl-xL (19Kong M. Fox C.J. Mu J. Solt L. Xu A. Cinalli R.M. Birnbaum M.J. Lindsten T. Thompson C.B. Science. 2004; 306: 695-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). To examine the phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase, cells were lysed and immunoprecipitation was performed using anti-PY antibody (Santa Cruz) followed by Western blot using focal adhesion kinase antibody (Cell Signaling). PP2A Activity Assay—The activity of cellular protein phosphatase 2A was assayed with a PP2A immunoprecipitation phosphatase assay kit (Upstate). Briefly, PP2Ac subunit was immunoprecipitated from 500 μg of total cell lysates using 2 μg of anti-PP2Ac antibody (clone 1D6; Upstate) for 2 h at 4 °C. PP2A activity was then assayed by incubating the immunoprecipitated protein with the synthetic phosphopeptide K-R-pT-I-R-R following the manufacturer's instructions. Rac1 Activation Assay—Rac1 activity was measured using the Cdc42/Rac Activation Assay kit (SGT445; Chemicon) according to the manufacturer's protocol. In brief, cells in one 100-mm dish were lysed, and 15 μl of 50% P21-activated kinase 1 P21-binding domain-agarose slurry was added to the cell lysates. Subsequently, an immunoblot was performed and PAK-precipitated GTP-Rac1 was detected by probing the membrane with a Rac1-specific monoclonal antibody, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. The total abundance of Rac1 was also determined by immunoblot analysis of cell lysates. α 4 Modulates Cell Spreading and Focal Adhesion Formation—During experiments to characterize the PP2A regulatory subunit α4, we observed that α4-deficient MEFs spread at a lower rate than control cells when trypsinized and transferred to fresh culture plates. To quantify this defect, α4flox MEFs were infected with retroviruses encoding either green fluorescence protein (GFP) expressed from an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) alone (Vec) or both a Cre recombinase and an IRES-GFP (Cre). Infected cells were collected at 48 h and plated on FN-coated dishes. As presented in Fig. 1A, a striking difference in the appearance of cell spreading on FN was observed. At 60 min, over 95% of the vector control cells appeared well extended and had achieved a flattened morphology. In contrast, only ∼22% of α4-deficient cells spread well. To determine whether loss of α4 induced a complete impairment or a delay of cell spreading, we investigated cell spreading at different time points. As shown in Fig. 1B, α4-deficient cells exhibited a significant delay in cell spreading compared with control cells yet they were still able to spread and achieve a flattened morphology if enough time were given, indicating that α4 deletion delayed but did not prevent spreading. Similar results were observed when cells were plated in serum or transferred to fibronectin-coated plates (Fig. 1B). Photographs using GFP fluorescence validated over 95% of the cells shown are GFP-positive cells (data not shown). In our previous study, we identified that α4 is required to maintain cell viability (19Kong M. Fox C.J. Mu J. Solt L. Xu A. Cinalli R.M. Birnbaum M.J. Lindsten T. Thompson C.B. Science. 2004; 306: 695-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Here we show that deletion of α4 leads to impaired cell spreading and migration. This effect could not be accounted for by apoptotic cell death because the α4flox MEFs used here were stably transfected with Bcl-xL and cell viability was >90% at the time of assay (data not shown). In addition, α4-deleted cells were still able to spread and achieve a flattened morphology if enough time were given (Fig. 1B). Thus, these data suggest that α4 is able to regulate cell spreading independent of its effect on apoptosis. Next, to further rule out the possibility that apoptosis may indirectly affect the cell cytoskeleton in α4-deleted cells, we investigated whether enforced expression of α4 promoted cell spreading. To address this question, several immortalized MEF cell lines expressing FLAG-tagged α4 were generated. Cells overexpressing α4 showed similar viability compared with vector control cells (data not shown). As presented in Fig. 1C, 20 min after plating on FN-coated dishes, >40% of α4-overexpressing cells attained a flattened morphology whereas only 15% of control cells achieved a flattened morphology at this time point. These data are representative of each of the stable α4-expressing cell lines we derived. These results suggest that α4 is a limiting component in the regulation of cell spreading. The effect of α4 on focal adhesion formation was next examined by staining the cells for vinculin. After 30 min of adhesion to FN, cells were processed for immunofluorescent labeling with anti-vinculin antibody. In vector-infected α4flox MEFs, vinculin was localized in focal adhesions present in multiple cell extensions. In contrast, Cre-infected cells possessed membrane ruffles but very few extensions or focal adhesions (Fig. 1D). The total number of focal adhesion spikes in α4-transfected cells was substantially increased in comparison with controls (Fig. 1E). In addition, similar results were obtained when staining for another focal adhesion protein, paxillin (data not shown). Despite the effects of α4 on adhesion complex formation, α4 overexpression did not affect the phosphorylation of the focal adhesion regulators Src, focal adhesion kinase, and paxillin (Fig. 1F). α4 Regulates Cell Migration—The role of α4 in regulating cell migration was also examined. The directed migration of vector-infected and Cre-infected α4flox MEFs was compared using an in vitro wound assay. As shown in Fig. 2A, when a confluent plate of cells was scratched by a sterile pipette tip, vector-infected cells extensively migrated into the wound area within 6 h. In contrast, the Cre-infected cells failed to migrate into the denuded area. We next determined whether α4 overexpression could promote cell migration. As shown in Fig. 2B, MEFs stably expressing FLAG-α4 displayed enhanced cell migration into the wound area. Using video time-lapse microscopy, we were able to track the migration of individual cells during this experiment. By tracking over 60 cells, we confirmed that cells overexpressing α4 displayed significantly increased motility (29.0 ± 1.6 μm/h in α4-expressing cells compared with 18.0 ± 1.3 μm/h in control cells; p < 0.0001) (Fig. 2C). Similar results were obtained using different clones. To further confirm the role of α4 in regulating cell motility, we used a two-chamber migration assay in which cells migrated through a membrane with 8-μm pores from serum-free medium toward a lower chamber with or without 10% serum. Consistent with the results from the wound assay, overexpression of α4 promoted cell migration either in the presence or absence of serum in the lower chamber (Fig. 3A). By taking advantage of α4flox MEFs infected with IRES-GFP or IRES-GFP-Cre, cells that migrated into the lower chamber were monitored by photographing the inner membrane with GFP fluorescence. Compared with vector-infected cells, the ability of Cre-infected cells to migrate into the lower chamber containing 10% serum was significantly reduced (Fig. 3B). α4 Functions through Modification of PP2A Activity—Several lines of evidence suggest that PP2A activity is required for cell migration and adhesion (24Kiely P.A. O'Gorman D. Luong K. Ron D. O'Connor R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 4041-4051Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 25Takahashi K. Nakajima E. Suzuki K. J. Cell Physiol. 2006; 206: 814-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Using the in vitro phosphatase assay, we observed that deletion of α4 resulted in reduced PP2A activity and overexpression of α4 led to increased PP2A activity (Fig. 4, A and B), suggesting PP2A activity is involved in α4-regulated cell migration. Inhibition of PP2A by either okadaic acid or forstriecin completely blocked α4-promoted cell migration (Fig. 4C). α4 Expression Levels Correlate with the Cellular Level of GTP-bound Rac1—Rac1 is known to be a critical regulator in cell spreading and motility and is required for focal adhesion formation (3Hall A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2005; 33: 891-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar, 26Guo F. Debidda M. Yang L. Williams D.A. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18652-18659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). We observed that α4 localized in the cell periphery, especially at protruding edges, during spreading in a pattern similar to that of the active form of Rac1 (Fig. 5A). Using an assay that specifically recognizes the active GTP-bound form of Rac1 in both α4-deficient and -overexpressing cells, the deletion of α4 by Cre infection was found to reduce the activation of Rac1 (Fig. 5B). Moreover, the level of GTP-bound Rac1 was enhanced by α4 expression (Fig. 5C). Rac1 Is a Mediator of α4-regulated Cell Migration—The above data suggest that α4 regulation of cell spreading and migration is epistatic to Rac1. If this is the case, the cytoskeletal defect induced by α4 deletion should be rescued by constitutively active Rac1. To test this, we first generated cell lines expressing a tamoxifen-inducible Cre-ER fusion protein in α4flox MEFs. Based on this, we further generated stable cell lines expressing constitutively active hemagglutinin-Rac1V12 in α4floxCre-ER MEFs (Fig. 6A). Consistent with the previous results, α4-deleted cells spread much less than control cells whereas expression of constitutively active Rac1 almost completely overcame this defect (Fig. 6B). Moreover, the two-chamber transwell assay demonstrated that Rac1V12 rescued the defect of cell migration caused by α4 deletion (Fig. 6C). To further show a functional correlation between α4 and Rac1, we tested whether inhibition of Rac1 would block α4-promoted cell migration. As shown in Fig. 6D, α4-promoted cell migration was almost completely abolished by a specific Rac1 inhibitor, 553502. Transgenic α4 Promotes Primary T Cell Motility—It has been reported that α4 is expressed in both T and B lymphocytes (27Onda M. Inui S. Maeda K. Suzuki M. Takahashi E. Sakaguchi N. Genomics. 1997; 46: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To test whether α4 regulation of cell motility is specific for fibroblasts or is also present in other cells, we generated T cell-specific α4 transgenic mice using a T cell-specific CD2 promoter/enhancer. T cells were isolated and purified to >99% purity as indicated by staining with the T cell marker Thy 1.2. Characterization of α4-transgenic T cells showed that an increased level of α4 has no observed effect on T cell development, proliferation, and viability (Fig. 7A and data not shown). To examine whether α4 regulates T cell motility, purified T cells from either wild-type or transgenic mice were analyzed using the two-chamber transwell assay in the absence or the presence of the chemokine SDF. Similar to our findings in fibroblasts, α4 transgenic T cells displayed enhanced migration both in the absence or presence of SDF (Fig. 7B). In agreement with the fibroblast results, increased GTP-bound Rac1 was found in α4 transgenic T cells (Fig. 7C). Using this in vivo transgenic system, we demonstrate that the ubiquitously expressed protein α4 plays a similar role in promoting cell migration both in fibroblasts and T cells. Reversible protein phosphorylation controlled by protein kinases and phosphatases is a major mechanism for regulating a variety of cellular processes. Unlike kinases, the activity and specificity of serine/threonine phosphatases is governed largely by their associated proteins (11Janssens V. Goris J. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 417-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1549) Google Scholar). The PP2A phosphatase complex contains two distinct forms of evolutionarily conserved regulatory subunits that do not appear to be functionally redundant. Here we show that the PP2A-associated protein α4 plays a critical role in regulating cell spreading and migration. Fibroblasts lacking α4 displayed significantly reduced ability to spread and migrate, whereas increased expression of α4 promoted cell spreading and migration. Inhibition of PP2A activity by specific inhibitors abolished the ability of α4 to promote cell migration, suggesting that α4 signals to critical regulators of cell migration through modification of PP2A activity and specificity. This effect of α4 correlated with changes in the GTP-bound state of the GTPase Rac1; overexpression of constitutively active Rac1 restored motility to α4-deficient cells, whereas inhibition of Rac1 blocked α4-promoted cell migration. Together, our results demonstrate that a specific protein phosphatase complex contributes to regulating cell cytoskeletal organization. The α4 homologue in yeast, Tap42, has been reported to influence actin organization via a Rho GTPase-dependent mechanism (21Wang H. Jiang Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3116-3125Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 28Torres J. Di Como C.J. Herrero E. De La Torre-Ruiz M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43495-43504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The present findings suggest that mammalian α4 retains this ability. Although in yeast PP2A activity might play a negative role in controlling the actin cytoskeleton (21Wang H. Jiang Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3116-3125Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), our data suggest that PP2A activity is required for α4 regulation of cell migration. The results demonstrate that Rac1 is a downstream effector for α4-mediated cell spreading and migration. Deletion of α4 resulted in impaired activation of Rac1 and overexpressing α4 led to an increase in GTP-bound Rac1. Expression of an active mutant of Rac1 in α4-deficient cells rescued α4 deletion-induced defects in cell spreading and migration, suggesting α4 functions upstream of Rac1 activation. These observations are consistent with the previous studies that Rac1 is a critical regulator of both cell spreading and migration (29van Leeuwen F.N. van Delft S. Kain H.E. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 242-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 30Hamelers I.H. Olivo C. Mertens A.E. Pegtel D.M. van der Kammen R.A. Sonnenberg A. Collard J.G. J.

Despite the fact that α4 overexpression led to increased focal adhesion spikes and deletion resulted in impaired focal adhesion formation, the phosphorylation status of several critical focal adhesion regulators did not change, including focal adhesion kinase, Src, and paxillin. Other studies have shown that Rac1 does not affect phosphorylation of Src or focal adhesion kinase yet it is required for Src, focal adhesion kinase, and vinculin to form a stable molecular complex, important for cell focal adhesion (26Guo F. Debidda M. Yang L. Williams D.A. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18652-18659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that α4 may regulate the focal adhesion complex via Rac1. What is upstream of α4 in controlling Rac1? It has been shown that the rapamycin-insensitive TOR complex TORC2 is involved in regulating cytoskeleton both in yeast and mammalian cells (32Schmidt A. Bickle M. Beck T. Hall M.N. Cell. 1997; 88: 531-542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 33Sarbassov D.D. Ali S.M. Kim D.H. Guertin D.A. Latek R.R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Sabatini D.M.

Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 1122-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (1701) Google Scholar). Like yeast TORC2, mammalian TORC2 also functions upstream of the Rho GTPase Rac1 (34Jacinto E. Loewith R. Schmidt A. Lin S. Ruegg M.A. Hall A. Hall M.N. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 1122-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (1701) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that α4 might act as a mediator of mammalian TORC2 in regulating Rac1 and cytoskeletal organization. The possible factors downstream of α4-phosphatase complex in regulating cell cytoskeleton are unknown. Using co-immunoprecipitation, we did not detect a direct interaction between α4 and Rac1,4 indicating that α4 may contribute to regulating Rac1 via a non-direct mechanism. Given the fact that TOR proteins regulate Rho GTPase activity via a GTP exchange factor, ROM2, in yeast, it is possible that α4-phosphatase complex signals to the cell cytoskeleton through modification of GTP/GDP exchange factor activity (32Schmidt A. Bickle M. Beck T. Hall M.N. Cell. 1997; 88: 531-542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Using T cell-specific transgenic mice, we are able to demonstrate that α4 also promotes T cell migration. It has been shown by many groups that Rac1 is a critical regulator in T cell migration (35Fukui Y. Hashimoto O. Sanui T. Oono T. Koga H. Abe M. Inayoshi A. Noda M. Oike M. Shirai T. Sasazuki T. Nature. 2001; 412: 826-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Given the fact that overexpression of α4 up-regulates the GTP-bound state of Rac1, it is not surprising that α4 promotes migration in transgenic T cells. Moreover, Rac1-mediated migration of T cells generally is integrin-dependent. Our results demonstrate that inhibition of integrin signaling using the integrin β1 antibody completely abolished the ability of α4 to promote T cell migration.4 These data further confirmed the cellular functional correlates between PP2A-α4 and Rac-1 signaling in regulating cell migration. Our previous work had demonstrated that α4-PP2A is involved in T cell receptor signaling, because the cytoplasmic domains of both CTLA-4 and CD28 can associate with PP2A and α4 (13Chuang E. Fisher T.S. Morgan R.W. Robbins M.D. Duerr J.M. Vander Heiden M.G. Gardner J.P. Hambor J.E. Neveu M.J. Thompson C.B. Immunity. 2000; 13: 313-322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Recently, another group showed that CTLA-4 increases T cell motility and overrides the T cell receptor-induced stop signal, yet how CTLA-4 regulates T cell motility remains unknown (36Schneider H. Downey J. Smith A. Zinselmeyer B.H. Rush C. Brewer J.M. Wei B. Hogg N. Garside P. Rudd C.E. Science. 2006; 313: 1972-1975Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar).

Margaret M Chou and Eric Brown for providing the Rac1 constructs and lentivirus supernatant expressing Cre-ER fusion protein, respectively.

The Down syndrome critical region 1 (DSCR1) gene, identified at the conserved trisomic 21 region in those patients, encodes a calcineurin inhibitor that inactivates nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFATc) activity. Here, we identify a regulatory sequence in the promoter region of human DSCR1 that dictates specific expression of a reporter gene in the endocardium, defined by the temporal and spatial expression of Nfatc1 during heart valve development. Activation of this evolutionally conserved DSCR1 regulatory sequence requires calcineurin and NFATc1 signaling in the endocardium. NFATc1 proteins bind to the regulatory sequence and trigger its enhancer activity. NFATc1 is sufficient to induce the expression of Dscr1 in cells that normally have undetectable or minimal NFATc1 or DSCR1. Pharmacologic inhibition of calcineurin or genetic Nfatc1 null mutation in mice abolishes the endocardial activity of this DSCR1 enhancer. Furthermore, in mice lacking endocardial NFATc1, the endogenous Dscr1 expression is specifically inhibited in the endocardium but not in the myocardium. Thus, our studies indicate that the DSCR1 gene is a direct transcriptional target of NFATc1 proteins within the endocardium during a critical window of heart valve formation.

The role of calcineurin in regulating DSCR1 expression in the heart remains undefined. Nor is there unambiguous evidence that DSCR1 is a direct transcriptional target of NFATc1 in the heart. Here, we identify an enhancer of the human DSCR1 gene that contains all the elements required to direct endocardial DSCR1 expression that is entirely defined by calcineurin/NFATc1 activity in the heart. We present both in vitro and in vivo evidence that the DSCR1 gene is a direct downstream target of the NFATc1 transcription factor in the endocardium of a developing heart.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMouse Husbandry—All mouse strains were maintained in outbred backgrounds at the Stanford University Research Animal Facility under the National Institutes of Health guidelines.

Nuclear proteins were extracted from embryonic hearts at embryonic day (E) 11.5 and E12.5. Anti-NFATc1 (clone 7A6, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used for antibody supershift experiments. Oligonucleotides used were: wild-type (wt)-NFAT-responsive element (NRE)-1, TCAGCTGTTTTTTCCATTCTCCCCAAGC; mutant-NRE1, TCAGCTGTTTGCTAGATTCTCCCCAAGC; wt-NRE2, AGCATAGGGAAAATGACTAAGG; mutant NRE2, AGCATAGCTAGCATGACTAAGG; wt-NRE3, ACGTCACCTCTTTCCAGTAGAAACTTACAC; mutant NRE3, ACGTCACCTCGCTAGAGTAGAAACTTACAC (sequences underlined represent the intact or mutant NFAT core binding sites).Plasmids, Cell Culture, and Transfection—Full-length mouse NFATc1 was cloned into pMES vector. The constitutively active calcineurin and DSCR1 luciferase reporter were described previously (26Chang C.P. McDill B.W. Neilson J.R. Joist H.E. Epstein J.A. Crabtree G.R. Chen F. J. Clin.

Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum and nonessential amino acids. Cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen).lacZ Staining, RNA in Situ Hybridization, and Immunostaining—Whole-mount lacZ staining was performed as described previously (7Chang C.P.

The mouse Dscr1 3′-untranslated region corresponding to exons 5, 6, and 7 was generated by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and subcloned into pCRII vector. This probe was common to all DSCR1 isoforms. In situ hybridization was performed using a standard protocol. For platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM)-1 staining, paraffin-embedded tissue sections were trypsin-digested and incubated with rat anti-PECAM-1 antibody (Pharmingen). NFATc1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was applied to paraformaldehyde-fixed REN cells. Alexa fluorophor-conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes) were used to visualize antibody staining.Adenoviral Infection, cDNA Microarray Analysis, and RT-PCR—The REN cell was infected with an adenoviral expression cassette consisting of a cytomegalovirus promoter, a constitutively activated NFATc1, and downstream green fluorescent protein (GFP) linked by internal ribosomal entry site (IRES). Cells were harvested for RNA isolation 2 days after infection. Human 10K cDNA chip was used for cDNA microarray analyses that were performed at Genomics/Microarray Facility, The Wistar Institute. The arrayed DNA (expressed sequence tag AA629707) was located at the 3′ end of DSCR1 for all four human transcript isoforms. For RT-PCR, total RNAs were isolated from independently infected REN cells. RT-PCR was performed using a standard protocol with the DSCR1 specific primers.RESULTSThe DSCR1 Regulatory Promoter Region Is Evolutionally Conserved and Under Calcineurin/NFATc1 Regulation—A promoter element located upstream of exon 4 of the human DSCR1 gene was identified previously (27Yang J. Rothermel B. Vega R.B. Frey N. McKinsey T.A. Olson E.N. Bassel-Duby R. Williams R.S. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: E61-E68Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The promoter showed an over 75% homology among rat, mouse, and human sequences, and the NREs within were perfectly conserved (Fig. 1A). By gel mobility shift analysis, we found that endogenous NFATc proteins present in the nuclear extracts of mouse embryonic hearts bound strongly to oligonucleotides containing the NRE1, -2, or -3 present in the promoter (Fig. 1B, lanes 1, 3, and 5). The presence of NFATc1 proteins in the binding complex was confirmed by disruption of the protein-DNA complexes with anti-NFATc1 antibody (Fig. 1B, lanes 2, 4, and 6). Furthermore, mutations of the canonical NFAT binding sites of NREs from GGAA(A/T)TTCC to CTAG(C/G)CTAG abolished the binding of endogenous NFATc1 proteins to NRE2 and -3 but not NRE1 (Fig. 1C, lanes 2, 4, and 6), suggesting that NFATc1 binds to canonical sites of NRE2 and -3, and a noncanonical site of NRE1, perhaps through GGAGA/TCTCC that is similar to the canonical site. Overall, these findings indicate that endogenous NFATc1 proteins bind to the NREs of the DSCR1 enhancer.To study whether NFATc1 could transactivate the DSCR1 promoter, we performed a luciferase reporter assay. The regulatory sequence of DSCR1 gene was cloned upstream of the luciferase reporter gene (27Yang J. Rothermel B. Vega R.B. Frey N. McKinsey T.A. Olson E.N. Bassel-Duby R. Williams R.S. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: E61-E68Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the MEFs, we found that overexpression of NFATc1 and constitutively active calcineurin (CnA*) (7Chang C.P. Neilson J.R. Bayle J.H. Gestwicki J.E. Kuo A. Stankunas K. Graef I.A. Crabtree G.R. Cell. 2004; 118: 649-663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) significantly enhanced the luciferase reporter activity (Fig. 1D). Overexpression of NFATc1 alone, however, had minimal activation of the reporter gene in MEFs because of the fact that NFATc proteins, whether overexpressed or endogenous, were located predominantly in the cytoplasm of MEFs in the absence of CnA* (data not shown). CnA* triggered the nuclear localization of endogenous or overexpressed NFATc proteins, leading to reporter activation (data not shown and Fig. 1D). Thus, the ability of NFATc1 proteins to bind to the enhancer and trigger the enhancer activity depends on their nuclear localization controlled by calcineurin. This indicates that NFATc proteins regulate the expression of DSCR1 at the transcriptional level. To examine whether NFATc1 could exert its transcriptional activity through the NREs of DSCR1 enhancer, we cloned the NRE3 element upstream of the luciferase reporter gene. We found that CnA* and NFATc1 strongly activated the luciferase expression of this reporter (Fig. 1E). Mutations of the NFAT binding site on NRE3 significantly reduced the transcriptional activity of NFATc1 on the reporter gene (Fig. 1E). Taken together, these studies indicate that NFATc1 proteins transcriptionally activate the DSCR1 enhancer through the NREs.NFATc1 Induces Endogenous DSCR1 Expression in Cells That Normally Have Undetectable or Minimal Expression of NFATc1 or DSCR1—To test whether NFATc proteins were sufficient to trigger endogenous DSCR1 expression, we chose the human mesothelioma cell line (REN cell) that had no detectable expression of NFATc1 and had only minimal expression of DSCR1. These cells were infected with either adenovirus expressing constitutively nuclear NFATc1-IRES-GFP (7Chang C.P. Neilson J.R. Bayle J.H. Gestwicki J.E. Kuo A. Stankunas K. Graef I.A. Crabtree G.R. Cell. 2004; 118: 649-663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) or with GFP and examined for the expression of DSCR1. The subcellular localization of the constitutively nuclear NFATc1 proteins was confirmed by immunostaining (Fig. 2A). Western blot analysis showed the expression of constitutive activated NFATc1 proteins in REN cells after infection with adenovirus (Fig. 2B). REN cells infected with control GFP-only virus did not express detectable endogenous NFATc1. Cells expressing NFATc1-IRES-GFP were sorted, cultured, and then subjected to transcript microarray analysis. Transcript analysis revealed that NFATc1 enhanced the expression of DSCR1 mRNA in REN cells by approximately 10-fold (Fig. 2C). The induction of DSCR1 mRNA expression was confirmed by semiquantitative RT-PCR in independently infected cells (Fig. 2D). These results indicate that NFATc1 is sufficient to activate endogenous DSCR1 expression.FIGURE 2The cDNA microarray analysis shows that NFATc1 activates endogenous DSCR1 expression. A, immunofluorescent staining shows nuclear localization NFATc1 proteins (red) in cells transfected with the constitutively nuclear NFATc1. B, Western blot analysis shows the expression of constitutively activated NFATc1 in REN cells after infection with adeno-NFATc1-IRES-GFP virus. REN cells infected with control GFP-only virus do not express detectable endogenous NFATc1 even with 10-fold protein loading. C, a graph showing that the ectopic expression of NFATc1 in REN cells markedly up-regulates DSCR1 mRNA expression (up to 11-fold, n = 4, p < 0.05).

Approximately 4-fold induction of DSCR1 mRNA by NFATc1 was observed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The DSCR1 Enhancer Activity in the Endocardium Requires Both Calcineurin and NFATc1—Both the in vitro binding and cellular transactivation assays suggested that NFATc transcriptionally regulated the expression of DSCR1. To investigate whether the enhancer activity of DSCR1 gene depends on NFATc proteins in vivo, we generated a transgenic mouse reporter line (DSCR1-lacZ), where a β-galactosidase reporter gene was driven by the human DSCR1 enhancer. By whole-mount lacZ staining, we found that the DSCR1-lacZ activity was expressed in the heart and neural tube during a specific time window of development from E9.5 to E12.5 (Fig. 3A). This expression pattern partially recapitulated the endogenous DSCR1 expression in the heart (28Vega R.B. Rothermel B.A. Weinheimer C.J. Kovacs A. Naseem R.H. Bassel-Duby R. Williams R.S. Olson E.N.

Detailed histological analysis of the heart revealed a specific expression of this transgene in endocardial cells (Fig. 3B). At E9.5, the transgene was expressed throughout the endocardium. By E11.5, the expression became limited to the cushion endocardium of the cardiac outflow tract and atrioventricular canal. This unique expression pattern was identical to that of NFATc1 as the latter was expressed in all endocardial cells at E9.5, and its expression became restricted to the cushion endocardial cells by E11.5 (7Chang C.P.

Staged pregnant transgenic mice (E8) were subcutaneously injected with cyclosporin A (CsA) at 50 mg/kg body weight. Embryos were harvested and analyzed 36 h later. CsA treatment prevents the transgene expression in the heart (arrows) and neural tube (arrowheads).

In Nfatc1 null embryos harboring the DSCR-lacZ reporter gene, we found that the expression of lacZ in the endocardium was abrogated (Fig. 3C), indicating that NFATc1 was required in vivo for DSCR1-lacZ expression. However, the expression of DSCR1-lacZ in the neural tube was not affected in the absence of NFATc1, consistent with the observation that NFATc1 was expressed in the endocardium (7Chang C.P.

Furthermore, we found that the dependence of DSCR1 expression on NFATc1 required calcineurin activity in the endocardium. Using cyclosporin A to inhibit calcineurin activity in utero (7Chang C.P.

Cell. 2004; 118: 649-663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), we showed that cyclosporin-treated embryos failed to express DSCR1 enhancer activity in the heart (Fig. 3D). NFATc1 proteins were localized to the cytoplasm in cyclosporin-treated embryos (Fig. 3E) and in embryos lacking endocardial calcineurin (data not shown), indicating that nuclear localization of NFATc1 controlled by calcineurin is crucial for DSCR1 activation in the endocardium. To investigate whether NFATc2, -c3, and -c4 were required for endocardial DSCR1 expression, we examined the expression of DSCR1-lacZ activity in Nfatc2/3/4 triple null embryos (7Chang C.P.

Cell. 2004; 118: 649-663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) and found that the DSCR1 enhancer activity was expressed normally in the heart in the absence of Nfatc2/3/4 (Fig. 3F). Of note, the DSCR1 enhancer activity in the neural tube required NFATc2/3/4 but not NFATc1 (Fig. 3, C and F). These results demonstrated a specific and unique in vivo requirement of calcineurin/NFATc1 for the DSCR1-lacZ expression in the endocardium.Endogenous DSCR1 Gene Expression in the Endocardium Requires NFATc1—To address whether endogenous DSCR1 expression required NFATc1 in the endocardium, we performed a RNA in situ hybridization in Nfatc1 null embryos with a probe specific for DSCR1. This probe was generated from the 3′-untranslated region corresponding to exons 5, 6, and 7 of mouse Dscr1 and detected all the common isoforms of Dscr1. We found that DSCR1 was expressed in both the endocardium and myocardium of wild-type mice at E12.5 (Fig. 4A). In mice lacking NFATc1, the expression of DSCR1 in the cushion endocardium was significantly reduced or abolished (Fig. 4, B and D). In contrast, its expression was preserved in the myocardium that did not normally express NFATc1 (Fig. 4B). To rule out a global change of gene expression in the endocardium of Nfatc1-/- mice, we examined the expression of endocardial PECAM-1 in the mutant mice. By immunostaining, we found no significant changes of endocardial PECAM-1 expression in Nfatc1-/- embryos (Fig. 4F). These observations ind"

Protecting cells from such aberrant proteins is non-sense-mediated decay (NMD), an RNA surveillance pathway that degrades transcripts harboring PTCs. A second response to nonsense mutations is the up-regulation of alternatively spliced transcripts that skip the PTC. This nonsense-associated altered splicing (NAS) response has the potential to rescue protein function, but the mechanism by which it is triggered has been controversial. Some studies suggest that, like NMD, NAS is triggered as a result of nonsense mutations disrupting reading frame, whereas other studies suggest that NAS is triggered when nonsense mutations disrupt exonic splicing enhancers (ESEs). Using T-cell receptor-β (TCRβ), which naturally acquires PTCs at high frequency, we provide evidence that both mechanisms act on a single type of mRNA. Mutations that disrupt consensus ESE sites up-regulated an alternatively spliced TCRβ transcript that skipped the mutations independently of reading frame disruption and the NMD factor UPF1. In contrast, reading frame-disrupting mutations that did not disrupt consensus ESE sites elicited UPF1-dependent up-regulation of the alternatively spliced TCRβ transcript. Restoration of reading frame prevented this up-regulation. Our results suggest that the response of an mRNA to a nonsense mutation depends on its context.

Although generally regarded as a beneficial quality control mechanism, NMD can sometimes be detrimental. For example, if the degraded transcript encodes a truncated protein that retains full or partial function, a reduction in its level by NMD has the potential to worsen clinical symptoms (1Frischmeyer P.A. Dietz H.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 1893-1900Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar, 6Holbrook J.A. Neu-Yilik G. Hentze M.W. Kulozik A.E. Nat.

A solution to this problem is provided by a second mechanism induced by nonsense mutations: nonsense-associated altered splicing (NAS). In NAS, alternative splicing produces a transcript that no longer contains the premature termination codon (PTC) generated by the nonsense mutations (8Mendell J.T. ap Rhys C.M. Dietz H.C. Science. 2002; 298: 419-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 9Wang J. Hamilton J.I. Carter M.S. Li S. Wilkinson M.F.

If the resulting transcript is in-frame and the skipped region does not encode a vital portion of the protein, NAS can produce a truncated protein that retains the function of the original, full-length protein. An example of beneficial NAS occurs in the dystrophin gene. Nonsense mutations induce an alternatively spliced dystrophin transcript encoding a truncated but active protein that produces a mild (Becker's) muscular dystrophy phenotype (11Chelly J. Gilgenkrantz H. Lambert M. Hamard G. Chafey P. Recan D. Katz P. de la Chapelle A. Koenig M.

A second example of beneficial NAS occurs in the LAMA2 gene; a nonsense mutation at position 2230 induces an alternatively spliced transcript encoding a truncated laminin α2 protein associated with a mild form of congenital muscular dystrophy (14Di Blasi C. He Y. Morandi L. Cornelio F. Guicheney P. Mora M. Brain. 2001; 124: 698-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).Two distinct mechanisms have been proposed for NAS. In class-I NAS, alternative splicing is triggered by mutations that disrupt exonic splicing enhancers (ESEs), short degenerate sequence elements that are bound by serine arginine (SR)-rich proteins (15Cartegni L. Chew S.L. Krainer A.R. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 285-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1723) Google Scholar, 16Valentine C.R. Mutat. Res. 1998; 411: 87-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Although the actual mechanism is not completely understood, ESEs are thought to improve splicing by recruiting SR proteins, which in turn recruit spliceosome components (15Cartegni L. Chew S.L. Krainer A.R. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 285-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1723) Google Scholar, 17Cooper T.A. Mattox W. Am. J. Hum.

When an ESE is disrupted by mutation, SR protein binding is reduced or prevented, which in turn lowers the inclusion frequency of the exon harboring that ESE. NAS is triggered if alternative splice sites are available to compete successfully with the normal splice sites for the spliceosomal apparatus. Because ESEs can be disrupted not only by nonsense, but also by missense and silent mutations, a hallmark of an exonic site susceptible to class-I NAS is that all three types of mutations have the potential to up-regulate the alternatively spliced transcript (15Cartegni L. Chew S.L. Krainer A.R. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 285-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1723) Google Scholar). Another feature of class-I NAS is that it is independent of reading frame. Documented examples of class-I NAS come from the BRCA1, fibrillin, and immunoglobulin μ (Igμ) genes (19Liu H.X. Cartegni L. Zhang M.Q. Krainer A.R. Nat.

Three lines of evidence support the existence of class-II NAS. First, nonsense mutations, but not missense mutations at corresponding positions, trigger an increase in the level of alternatively spliced transcripts from several genes, including minute virus of mice, fibrillin, and T-cell receptor β (TCRβ) (8Mendell J.T. ap Rhys C.M. Dietz H.C. Science. 2002; 298: 419-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 9Wang J. Hamilton J.I. Carter M.S. Li S. Wilkinson M.F.

Biol. 1999; 19: 1640-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Second, the up-regulation of the alternatively spliced transcripts in response to nonsense mutations is inhibited by blocking translation; i.e. by introducing a stem loop before the translation initiation start site or by mutating the start AUG or the Kozak consensus sequence (9Wang J. Hamilton J.I. Carter M.S. Li S. Wilkinson M.F. Science. 2002; 297: 108-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 10Wang J. Chang Y.F. Hamilton J.I. Wilkinson M.F. Mol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 22452-22458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Third, suppressor tRNAs repress the up-regulation of nonsense codon-bearing TCRβ transcripts (9Wang J. Hamilton J.I. Carter M.S. Li S. Wilkinson M.F. Science. 2002; 297: 108-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar).A similar phenomenon called the suppression of splicing response has been documented for the carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase, aspartate transcarbamylase, dihydroorotase, and human α-l-iduronidase transcripts. In this mechanism, in-frame PTCs within the intron appear to prevent the splicing machinery from using cryptic 5′-splice sites in the intron. This mechanism is likely to be distinct from NAS, because it is not affected by the protein synthesis inhibitor G418, suppressor tRNAs, or depletion of UPF1 by RNAi (27Wachtel C. Li B. Sperling J. Sperling R. RNA (N. Y.). 2004; 10: 1740-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).Recently, evidence challenging the existence of reading frame-dependent (class-II) NAS was reported (28Mohn F. Buhler M. Muhlemann O. RNA (N. Y.). 2005; 11: 147-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Mohn et al. (28Mohn F. Buhler M. Muhlemann O. RNA (N. Y.). 2005; 11: 147-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) found that up-regulation of the alternatively spliced transcript from a TCRβ minigene did not always correlate with disruption of reading frame, leading the authors to conclude that the up-regulation was not caused by disruption of reading frame. Here we reinvestigate this issue by introducing a series of nonsense, missense, and frameshift mutations at well defined positions in the TCRβ gene. Transfection experiments with these mutant TCRβ constructs indicated that mutations at consensus ESE-rich sites increased the level of alternatively spliced transcripts regardless of whether they disrupted reading frame, whereas mutations at sites devoid of consensus ESEs up-regulated alternatively spliced transcripts only when the mutations also disrupted reading frame. Our results provide evidence that TCRβ transcripts are subject to both classes of NAS and that the consequences of reading frame-disrupting mutations depend on context.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids—Construct A (β-290) is a wild-type TCRβ gene, as described previously (pAc/IF) (29Carter M.S. Li S. Wilkinson M.F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5965-5975Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). All other TCRβ constructs were derived from construct A by site-directed mutagenesis PCR (30Li S. Leonard D. Wilkinson M.F. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 985-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Construct B (β-1136) contains a single-nucleotide nonsense mutation at codon 123. Construct C (β-1135) contains a single-nucleotide missense mutation at codon 123. Constructs D (β-1011) and E (β-1012) contain one- or three-nucleotide insertions, respectively, at codon 91. Construct F (β-1013) contains a one-nucleotide deletion at codon 123. Construct G (β-1041) combines the mutations in constructs D and F. Construct H (β-1148) contains a single-nucleotide nonsense mutation at codon 126. Construct I (β-1147) contains a single-nucleotide missense mutation at codon 126. Construct J (β-1094) contains a one-nucleotide deletion at codon 126. Construct K (β-1115) combines the mutations in constructs D and J.Transfections—HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, as previously described (5Chan W.K.

They were grown to ∼40% confluence in 60-mm plates for transfection. Plates were transfected with 500 ng of TCRβ reporter construct and 50 ng of a β-globin expression vector construct (G-435) using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The transfection mixture was removed after 20 h, and 3 ml of fresh serum-containing media was added to each plate. Cells were harvested after additional 24-h incubation.RNA Interference—UPF1 and SMG1 were transiently depleted using siRNA oligonucleotides (Ambion) containing sequences previously described (8Mendell J.T. ap Rhys C.M.

Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 497-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were grown to ∼15% confluence in 60-mm plates before being transfected with siRNA oligonucleotides using Lipofectamine 2000, following the manufacturer's standard protocol. The final concentration of siRNA oligonucleotide was 100 nm for UPF1 and 200 nm for SMG1. The transfection mixture was removed after 20 h, and the cells were incubated for ∼24 h with 3 ml of fresh serum-containing media and then transfected with 500 ng of TCRβ reporter construct and 50 ng of β-globin expression vector using Lipofectamine according to the manufacturer's standard protocol. The transfection mixture was removed after 20 h, 3 ml of fresh serum-containing medium was added, and the cells incubated an additional 24 h before harvest.eIF4AIII was transiently depleted using an siRNA oligonucleotide containing sequences previously described (33Palacios I.M. Gatfield D. St Johnston D. Izaurralde E. Nature. 2004; 427: 753-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were grown to ∼40% confluence in 60-mm plates before being transfected with eIF4AIII and control (Luc) siRNA oligonucleotides (at a final concentration of 100 nm) using Lipofectamine 2000. After 6-h incubation, the cells were transfected with 500 ng of TCRβ reporter construct and 50 ng of β-globin expression vector using Lipofectamine. The transfection mixture was removed after 20 h, 3 ml of fresh serum-containing medium was added, and the cells were incubated an additional 24 h before harvest.UPF3a and/or UPF3b were depleted by transiently transfecting short hairpin (sh) RNA constructs against these factors using Lipofectamine in HeLa cell clones. These clones, grown to ∼40% confluence on 60-mm plates, already stably expressed UPF3a and/or UPF3b shRNAs (5Chan W.K. Huang L. Gudikote J.P. Chang Y.F. Imam J.S. Maclean 2nd, J.A. Wilkinson M.F. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 1820-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In addition to the shRNA constructs, the cells were transiently transfected with 500 ng of TCRβ reporter construct and 50 ng of β-globin expression vector. After 20-h incubation, the transfection mixture was removed, 3 ml of fresh serum-containing medium was added, and the cells were incubated an additional 24 h before harvest.RNA Isolation and Ribonuclease Protection Analysis—RNA was isolated with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Ribonuclease protection analysis was performed as described previously, using 10 μg of total cellular RNA (30Li S. Leonard D. Wilkinson M.F. J. Exp.

The SMG1 riboprobe was generated from a 193-nucleotide SMG1 cDNA fragment subcloned into pGEM-T Easy (Promega) after PCR amplification from a SMG1 cDNA template (G-376, provided by Dr. Alan P.

The UPF3a (G-539), UPF3b (G-540), and β-actin (G-98) riboprobes were previously described (5Chan W.K. Huang L. Gudikote J.P. Chang Y.F. Imam J.S. Maclean 2nd, J.A. Wilkinson M.F.

Imam J.S. Garcia R.F. Wilkinson M.F. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were harvested and lysed on ice for 30 min using radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, the lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 20 min, the supernatant was collected, and the protein concentration was determined using the DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). 5–20 μg of protein was electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to Hybond ECL nitrocellulose (Amersham Biosciences), incubated with a polyclonal antiserum against human UPF1 (provided by Dr. Jens Lykke-Andersen, University of Colorado, Boulder) at 1:5,000 dilution or a monoclonal antibody against β-actin (Sigma) at 1:10,000 dilution in 5% milk solution, and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antisera (Amersham Biosciences), respectively. Signals were visualized using ECL reagent (Pierce).RESULTSReading Frame-dependent NAS—As with our past studies (9Wang J. Hamilton J.I. Carter M.S. Li S. Wilkinson M.F. Science. 2002; 297: 108-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 10Wang J. Chang Y.F. Hamilton J.I. Wilkinson M.F. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 951-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), we utilized a productively rearranged TCRβ gene to study NAS. This gene, composed of the Lβ8.1 exon, a rearranged Vβ8.1-Dβ2-Jβ2.3 exon, and four Cβ exons, produces the normally spliced transcript (norm-mRNA) shown in Fig. 1 (A and B). It also produces an alternatively spliced transcript (alt-mRNA) derived as a result of an alternative splice-site acceptor (alt-SA) located in the intron upstream of the VDJ exon and an alternative splice-site donor (alt-SD) in the 5′-end of the VDJ exon (Fig. 1, A and B). The resulting alt-mRNA contains a portion of the intron and only the 5′-end of the VDJ exon but remains in frame. The vast majority of transcripts expressed from this TCRβ gene are norm-mRNA, with only a trace amount of alt-mRNA (9Wang J. Hamilton J.I. Carter M.S. Li S. Wilkinson M.F. Science. 2002; 297: 108-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 10Wang J. Chang Y.F. Hamilton J.I. Wilkinson M.F. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 951-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). However, introduction of nonsense and frameshift mutations leads to the degradation of most of the norm-mRNA by NMD and an increase in the level of alt-mRNA by NAS (9Wang J. Hamilton J.I. Carter M.S. Li S. Wilkinson M.F. Science. 2002; 297: 108-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 10Wang J. Chang Y.F. Hamilton J.I. Wilkinson M.F. Mol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 28995-29003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar).To assess whether the up-regulation of alt-mRNA occurs by a reading frame-dependent mechanism, we scanned the VDJ exon for positions at which to introduce nonsense mutations that would disrupt the reading frame but not known ESEs. Toward this end, we used the software program ESEfinder to identify consensus binding sites for the SR proteins ASF/SF2, SC35, SRp40, and SRp55 (38Cartegni L. Wang J. Zhu Z. Zhang M.Q. Krainer A.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3568-3571Crossref PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar). ESEs above the default threshold are shown in supplemental Fig. S1. From this analysis we selected codon 123 in which to make mutations. A nonsense mutation in this codon does not disrupt any known ESEs, according to ESEfinder analysis (construct B in supplemental Fig. S2A). As a control, we generated a missense mutation in the same codon that likewise does not affect any known consensus ESEs (construct C).To determine the effects of these mutations, we transiently transfected the constructs into HeLa cells, extracted total cellular RNA, and used ribonuclease protection analysis to quantify the levels of alt- and norm-mRNA. As we have described before (9Wang J. Hamilton J.I. Carter M.S. Li S. Wilkinson M.F. Science. 2002; 297: 108-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 10Wang J. Chang Y.F. Hamilton J.I. Wilkinson M.F. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 951-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), we used a riboprobe that gives a larger band for the alt-mRNA than for norm-mRNA, because the riboprobe hybridizes with the entire length of the alternative VDJ exon in alt-mRNA but only a portion of the VDJ exon in norm-mRNA (Fig. 1B). Consistent with our past studies demonstrating that TCRβ transcripts are subject to NMD (5Chan W.K. Huang L. Gudikote J.P. Chang Y.F. Imam J.S. Maclean 2nd, J.A. Wilkinson M.F.

Chem. 2002; 277: 18489-18493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), we found that the norm-mRNA was specifically down-regulated by the nonsense mutation but not the missense mutation (constructs B and C, respectively, Fig. 2A). Relevant to the present study, the nonsense mutation also triggered NAS, as it increased the level of the alt-mRNA (Fig. 2A). Using β-globin as an internal control, we found that alt-mRNA levels were increased by 3-fold in response to the nonsense mutation in construct B (Fig. 2B). In contrast, the missense mutation did not significantly increase alt-mRNA level (Fig. 2B). These results supported the hypothesis that the alternatively spliced TCRβ mRNA is up-regulated in response to disruption of reading frame.As an independent test of this hypothesis, we introduced frameshift mutations in the region of the VDJ exon skipped in the alt-mRNA. A frameshift in this region creates a PTC in the norm-mRNA but not the alt-mRNA, and thus we predicted it would trigger NAS. To test this prediction, we created construct D, which contains a one-nucleotide insertion at codon 91 that does not disrupt any consensus ESEs ( supplemental Fig. S2B). As a control, we generated a three-nucleotide mutation at the same codon (construct E) that retains the original reading frame and thus, unlike construct D, does not have an in-frame nonsense codon. As with construct D, construct E does not disrupt consensus ESEs ( supplemental Fig. S2B). We also generated a downstream compensatory one-nucleotide deletion in codon 123 (construct F) that does not disrupt consensus ESEs ( supplemental Fig. S2B). Finally, we generated a construct that combines the one-nucleotide insertion and deletion, restoring the original reading frame (construct G in supplemental Fig. S2B).We transiently transfected these constructs into HeLa cells and determined whether the mutations present in the constructs triggered NAS and NMD. We predicted that only the constructs with disrupted reading frame would give rise to transcripts regulated by NAS and NMD. In agreement with this prediction, we found that the level of alt-mRNA was increased and that of norm-mRNA decreased when the reading frame was disrupted by the one-nucleotide insertion or deletion (constructs D and F, respectively, Fig. 3, A and B). In contrast, the levels of alt- and norm-mRNA remained unchanged when the mutation was reading frame neutral or when the original frameshift was corrected by a downstream compensatory frameshift (constructs E and G, respectively, Fig. 3, A and B). The results from these four insertion and deletion constructs, in addition to those described earlier containing nonsense and missense mutations, support the hypothesis that TCRβ transcripts are subject to reading frame-dependent (class-II) NAS.Reading Frame-dependent NAS Depends on UPF1—Because, like NMD, class-II NAS is elicited by an in-frame nonsense codon, we predicted it would require the NMD factor UPF1. To test this, we depleted UPF1 with a double-stranded siRNA previously shown to effectively knockdown UPF1 (8Mendell J.T. ap Rhys C.M. Dietz H.C. Science. 2002; 298: 419-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). We found that transient transfection of this siRNA into HeLa cells reduced UPF1 protein leve"

We report here that TAp73 is necessary for the cellular response to oxidative stress and that TAp73 functions as a downstream target of p53 in this process. We show that p53 physically interacts with the TAp73 promoter under stress conditions that lead to cell death. Particularly, p53 binds to a palindromic site in the TAp73 promoter, activates the promoter of TAp73, and selectively induces TAp73 transcription. TAp73 expression is highly increased under oxidative stress in a p53-dependent manner. Furthermore, knock-down of TAp73 expression inhibits the cellular apoptotic response to oxidative damage. In contrast, the ectopic expression of TAp73 in p53–/– mouse embryonic fibroblasts induces oxidative cell death. Our findings demonstrate that p53 is a direct transcriptional regulator of TAp73. Our data reveal a new pathway for cellular protection against oxidative damage and provide evidence that TAp73 is a stress-response gene and a downstream effector in the p53 pathway.

Sidransky D. Vogelstein B. Harris C.C. Science. 1991; 253: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (7452) Google Scholar). p53 plays a fundamental role in multiple cellular processes, including cell cycle checkpoint control, cell death induction, DNA repair, and genetic stability (2Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6727) Google Scholar, 3Kastan M.B. Canman C.E. Leonard C.J.

Cell. 1992; 70: 937-948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar). p53 acts as a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein and activates transcription by binding specific DNA consensus sequences (6Kern S.E. Kinzler K.W. Bruskin A. Jarosz D. Friedman P. Prives C. Vogelstein B. Science. 1991; 252: 1708-1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar). The p53 consensus sequence was initially defined as two copies of the 10-bp motif 5′-PuPuPuC(A/T)(T/A) GPyPyPy-3′, separated by a 0–13-bp spacer (7El Deiry W.S. Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1744) Google Scholar). As a negative regulator of cell cycle progression, p53 functions to control the transition from G1 to S phase of the cell cycle. p53 does this through transcriptional induction of p21, a universal inhibitor of cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinases, which is required for cell cycle arrest in response to DNA damage caused by γ-irradiation (8Brugarolas J. Chandrasekaran C. Gordon J.I. Beach D. Jacks T. Hannon G.J. Nature. 1995; 377: 552-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar). It is well established that p53 functions as a mediator of cell death (9Yonish Rouach E. Resnitzky D. Lotem J. Sachs L. Kimchi A. Oren M. Nature. 1991; 352: 345-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (1991) Google Scholar). p53 is required for irradiation-induced apoptosis in mouse thymocytes and is associated with cellular sensitivity to drug-mediated cell killing in chemotherapy (10Lowe S.W. Schmitt E.M. Smith S.W. Osborne B.A. Jacks T. Nature. 1993; 362: 847-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (2764) Google Scholar, 11Lowe S.W. Ruley H.E. Jacks T. Housman D.E. Cell. 1993; 74: 957-967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2957) Google Scholar). p53 is also required for the apoptotic response to oxidative stress (12Yin Y. Terauchi T. Solomon G.G. Aizawa S. Rangarajan P.N. Yazaki Y. Kadowaki T. Barrett J.C. Nature. 1998; 391: 707-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which p53 regulates this apoptotic pathway have been explored extensively. It is known that p53 transactivation plays an essential role in induction of apoptosis (13Sabbatini P.

Almost all of these are functionally related with caspase signaling and mitochondrial apoptosis pathways (22Michael D. Oren M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Although p53 mediates apoptosis in response to oxidative stress, the downstream effectors of p53 function in this pathway are largely unknown. We previously reported that PAC1 and MKP2, protein phosphatases and inhibitors of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade, are two transcriptional targets of p53 in signaling the cellular response to nutritional stress and oxidative stress (23Yin Y. Liu Y.X. Jin Y.J. Hall E.J. Barrett J.C. Nature. 2003; 422: 527-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 24Shen W.H. Wang J. Wu J. Zhurkin V.B. Yin Y. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 6033-6039Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We propose that there are more targets of p53 transactivation involved in cellular defense processes. p73 was discovered due to its considerable homology to p53, and it was originally considered a potential tumor suppressor because of its location at chromosome 1p36, a region frequently deleted in neuroblastoma and other tumors (25Kaghad M. Bonnet H. Yang A. Creancier L. Biscan J.C. Valent A. Minty A. Chalon P. Lelias J.M. Dumont X. Ferrara P. McKeon F. Caput D. Cell. 1997; 90: 809-819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1536) Google Scholar). The p73 gene is able to encode transcriptionally active TA73, as well as an N-terminally truncated form, ΔNp73 (DNp73), lacking the transactivation domain, which is transcribed from a different promoter within intron 3 of the gene (26Irwin M.S. Kaelin W.G. Cell Growth & Differ. 2001; 12: 337-349PubMed Google Scholar). TAp73 protein shares structural and functional similarities with p53. The TAp73 gene encodes four polypeptides through alternative splicing of exons 11–13, designated as p73α,-β,-γ, and -δ. TAp73 is expressed in either a full-length form, p73α, or shorter mRNA variants: β (splicing out exon 13), γ (splicing out exon 11), and δ (splicing out exons 11, 12, and 13) (27De Laurenzi V. Costanzo A. Barcaroli D. Terrinoni A. Falco M. Annicchiarico-Petruzzelli M. Levrero M. Melino G. J. Exp. Med. 1998; : 1763-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). TAp73 has significant sequence identity to the transactivation, DNA binding, and oligomerization domains of p53. In addition, TAp73α has a SAM-like domain in its C terminus. TAp73 can bind to a p53 consensus sequence and transactivate some, but not all, p53-regulated genes. A main function of TAp73 is to mediate apoptosis, but unlike p53, it appears to be activated in response to certain types of DNA damage but not others (25Kaghad M. Bonnet H. Yang A. Creancier L.

In contrast, DNp73 acts in a dominant-negative manner and blocks transactivation of target genes by p53 and TAp73 (29Yang A. Kaghad M. Caput D. McKeon F. Trends Genet. 2002; 18: 90-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). The role of p73 in tumorigenesis is controversial. Unlike p53, which is the most commonly mutated gene in human cancer, mutations in the p73 gene are extremely rare (30Schwartz D.I. Lindor N.M. Walsh-Vockley C. Roche P.C. Mai M. Smith D.I. Liu W.

Pathol. 2006; 210: 385-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and there are no mutations found in hematopoietic cancers (32Stirewalt D.L. Clurman B. Appelbaum F.R. Willman C.L. Radich J.P. Leukemia (Basingstoke). 1999; 13: 985-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), breast cancer (30Schwartz D.I. Lindor N.M. Walsh-Vockley C. Roche P.C. Mai M. Smith D.I. Liu W. Couch F.J.

Liu W. Prostate. 1999; 39: 94-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). p73 mutations are restricted to certain tumors, such as non-Hodgkin lymphomas (34Stoffel A. Filippa D. Rao P.H. Leuk. Res. 2004; 28: 1341-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The expression of p73, however, is frequently altered in human tumors. For example, the expression of TAp73 is reduced in lymphoma and leukemia (35Corn P.G. Kuerbitz S.J. van Noesel M.M. Esteller M. Compitello N. Baylin S.B. Herman J.G. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3352-3356PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the over-expression of p73 was found in a variety of cancers, including those from breast, ovary, bladder, colon, and lung (36Zaika A.I. Kovalev S. Marchenko N.D. Moll U.M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3257-3263PubMed Google Scholar, 37Ng S.W. Yiu G.K. Liu Y. Huang L.W. Palnati M. Jun S.H. Berkowitz R.S. Mok S.C.

These observations suggest that p73 is not a classic tumor suppressor and even an oncogene. Although p53-null mice develop normally and are susceptible to tumorigenesis (40Donehower L.A. Harvey M. Slagle B.L. McArthur M.J. Montgomery C.A. Butel Jr., J.S. Bradley A. Nature. 1992; 356: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (4035) Google Scholar), p73 knock-out mice have neurological, pheromonal, and inflammatory defects but do not develop spontaneous tumors (41Yang A. Walker N. Bronson R. Kaghad M. Oosterwegel M. Bonnin J. Vagner C.H.B. Dikkes P. Sharpe A. McKeon F. Caput D. Nature. 2000; 404: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar). Thus, p53 and TAp73 have overlapping and distinct functions; p53 regulates the stress response to suppress tumorigenesis, and TAp73 might regulate both the stress response and development. Because p53 and TAp73 are linked to different upstream pathways, this family of transcription factors might regulate a common set of genes in response to different extracellular signals and developmental cues. On the other hand, p53 and TAp73 seem to be linked functionally in signaling apoptosis in mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEFs) 3The abbreviations used are:MEFmouse embryonic fibroblastFBSfetal bovine serumsiRNAsmall interfering RNAEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayChIPchromatin immunoprecipitationTUNELterminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labelingGygraysWTwild-typeRPAribonuclease protection assayAbantibodypAbpolyclonal antibody.3The abbreviations used are:MEFmouse embryonic fibroblastFBSfetal bovine serumsiRNAsmall interfering RNAEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayChIPchromatin immunoprecipitationTUNELterminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labelingGygraysWTwild-typeRPAribonuclease protection assayAbantibodypAbpolyclonal antibody. induced by DNA-damaging agents. It is shown that p53-deficient E1A mouse embryo fibroblasts are highly resistant to apoptosis (11Lowe S.W. Ruley H.E. Jacks T. Housman D.E. Cell. 1993; 74: 957-967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2957) Google Scholar). However, p53-mediated cell death induced by DNA-damaging agents is inhibited in p73-null E1A mouse embryo fibroblasts, suggesting that p73 is required for p53-dependent apoptosis in these E1A MEFs (42Flores E.R. Tsai K.Y. Crowley D. Sengupta S. Yang A. McKeon F. Jacks T. Nature. 2002; 416: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). This is puzzling because if p73 functions as a transcription factor in parallel with p53, loss of p73 should not affect p53 function. Instead, it is possible that p73 is a downstream target of p53. That could explain why p73 overexpression induces apoptosis in the absence of p53, but p53 needs p73 to mediate apoptosis. Our data lend support to this model. mouse embryonic fibroblast fetal bovine serum small interfering RNA electrophoretic mobility shift assay chromatin immunoprecipitation terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling grays wild-type ribonuclease protection assay antibody polyclonal antibody. mouse embryonic fibroblast fetal bovine serum small interfering RNA electrophoretic mobility shift assay chromatin immunoprecipitation terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling grays wild-type ribonuclease protection assay antibody polyclonal antibody. We have previously demonstrated that p53 is required for the cellular response to oxidative stress (12Yin Y. Terauchi T. Solomon G.G. Aizawa S. Rangarajan P.N. Yazaki Y. Kadowaki T. Barrett J.C. Nature. 1998; 391: 707-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 43Yin Y. Solomon G. Deng C. Barrett J.C. Mol. Carcinog. 1999; 24: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In this study, we report that p73α, which is referred to as TAp73 or TAp73α in the text, is transcriptionally regulated by p53 for signaling apoptosis following oxidative stress. We reveal that p53 transactivates the first promoter of the human p73 gene. We further demonstrate that p53 physically and specifically binds to a novel palindrome in the p73 promoter. It has been reported that combined loss of p63 and p73 inhibits p53-dependent apoptosis in response to DNA damage. We show here that reduction of TAp73 expression by its small interference RNA blocks p53-mediated cell death following oxidative stress. We propose that p53 is a transcriptional regulator of TAp73 and that TAp73 is necessary for the cellular response to oxidative stress. Cell Culture and DNA Transfection—EB and EB-1 have been described previously (44Zhao R. Gish K. Murphy M. Yin Y. Notterman D. Hoffman W.H. Tom E. Mack D.H. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 981-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). MEFs were described elsewhere (12Yin Y. Terauchi T. Solomon G.G. Aizawa S. Rangarajan P.N. Yazaki Y. Kadowaki T. Barrett J.C. Nature. 1998; 391: 707-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 45Almasan A. Yin Y. Kelly R.E. Lee E.Y. Bradley A. Li W. Bertino J.R. Wahl G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5436-5440Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Primary p73+/+ and p73–/– MEFs at passages 2–4 were cultured under normal growth conditions (42Flores E.R. Tsai K.Y. Crowley D. Sengupta S. Yang A. McKeon F. Jacks T. Nature. 2002; 416: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). Cancer cell lines used were originally purchased from ATCC. These cell lines were maintained in Earle's minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Transfection was performed using Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen). For transient transfection, 2 × 105 cells were seeded per well of a 6-well culture plate and incubated for 24 h. Plasmid DNA was added into 100 μl of serum-free medium, mixed with 50 μlof Lipofectamine reagent, and incubated for 15 min. The solution was added directly onto the cells in 2 ml of serum-free medium. The cells were incubated in Earle's minimal essential medium plus 20% FBS overnight. For stable clones, transfected cells were grown for about 2 weeks in a complete growth medium containing 2 μg/ml hygromycin B for hygro resistance. Colonies were picked for further studies. Construction of Luciferase Reporters, TAp73 Expression Plasmid, and siRNA Vector—Human genomic DNA was purified from normal human fibroblasts as template for promoter cloning. The regulatory region of the human TAp73α was amplified by PCR. The primers used to amplify the p73 promoter by PCR are as follows: 5′-GCGGGACCGTGGCTCCACAGGAGAAGTG-3′ (forward); 5′-GCGCCAAGTCCCAGGCCGATCCAACTCC-3′ (reverse). PCR reactions were performed under the following conditions: seven cycles of 94 °C, 2 s, 72 °C, 3 min, 35 cycles of 94 °C, 2 s, 67 °C, 3 min, and one cycle of 67 °C, 4 min. The promoter was ligated into the pGL3-basic reporter (Promega), resulting in pGL3/p73p-luc. pGL3/p73mt-luc was generated by changing the palindromic sequence from 5′-TGGACGCGGCCA-3′ to 5′-TTGACGCGGCCA-3′ as underlined using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), according to the manufacturer's protocol. The mouse TAp73 expression vector was constructed from a selectable constitutive expression vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). The full coding region of mouse TAp73α (1.9 kb) was amplified from a mouse cDNA library (Clontech) by PCR using the following primers: mp73-20up, 5′-GCAGAATGAGCGGCAGCGTT-3′ (forward); mp73-20dn, 5′-CGTTCCTCAGTGGCTCTCTG-3′ (reverse). The resulting PCR product (1928 bp) was ligated into pT-Adv and then subcloned into pcDNA3.1, resulting in pcDNA3/mp73. pSilencer 1.0-U6 siRNA expression vector (Ambion) was used to generate a TAp73/siRNA made against a 19-nucleotide-specific mouse TAp73α sequence, which is in the starting coding region of the mouse TAp73α. The U6/p73 siRNA construct was created by ligating the following annealed oligonucleotides into the designed sites of ApaI and EcoRI of the U6 vector as follows: forward, 5′-GGGACTAGCGAGGCATCAGTTCAAGAGACTGATGCCTCGCTAGTCCCTTTTTT-3′; reverse, 5′-AATTAAAAAAGGGACTAGCGAGGCATCAGTCTCTTGAACTGATGCCTCGCTAGTCCCGGCC-3′. A random sequence, GACCTCCTGTCCTATGAGG, was ligated into the U6 as a scrambled control. The constructs were sequenced to confirm that the designed fragments were introduced in-frame into vectors. Luciferase Assay—Cells were transiently transfected with plasmids in triplicate. A pCMV-β-galactosidase reporter plasmid was cotransfected to normalize the transfection efficiency. Cell extracts were processed using the Dual-Light kit (Tropix) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase activity was measured with a Berthold Autolumat LB953 rack luminometer. Luciferase values were normalized against β-galactosidase activity. Luciferase readout was always obtained from triplicate transfections and averaged. RNA Isolation, Northern Blot, and Western Blot—Total RNA was isolated from growing cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Poly(A)+ RNA was purified using a PolyATtract mRNA isolation system (Promega), according to the manufacturer's instructions. For Northern analysis, RNA was separated on a 1.2% formaldehyde gel and transferred to an N-Hybond membrane using a Turboblotter system (Schleicher & Schuell). The probe for TAp73 is based on the N-terminal sequence of TAp73, which is different from that of DNp73. The DNp73 probe is a unique sequence corresponding to the exon 3′ of DNp73α. DNA probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Biosciences) using the Prime-It RmT random primer labeling Kit (Stratagene). The membrane was hybridized with labeled DNA probes in the QuikHyb hybridization (Stratagene) at 65 °C for 2 h and developed for autoradiography. For Western blotting, growing cells at 60–70% confluence were lysed in cold Nonidet P-40 buffer with protease/phosphatase inhibitors. The samples were resolved by 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and then transferred onto nitrocellulose filters after protein separation. For the detection of TAp73, a monoclonal antibody specific for TAp73α (Calbiochem, ER-13) was used to recognize the α form of TAp73. We used an anti-DNp73 monoclonal antibody that recognizes the δ form of p73 (Calbiochem, 38C674). Immunoblots were incubated with primary antibodies and then incubated with peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG as secondary antibody. The signals were detected with enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). DNase I Footprinting Analysis—Fragments of the human p73 promoter were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase, digested with BamHI, and purified as the sense strand 5′-end-labeled probe. Recombinant p53 protein was produced in insect cells infected with a baculovirus vector expressing human WT p53 and partially purified through affinity chromatography. p53 protein was added to bind to radiolabeled probe fragment (1–2 104 cpm) at 37 °C for 20 min followed by the addition of DNase I from the Core footprinting system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The reaction products were subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions, and the gel was dried and exposed for autoradiography. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Oligonucleotides (pairs of sense and antisense) were synthesized, annealed, and labeled with 32P by using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP as described elsewhere (46Maiyar A.C. Huang A.J. Phu P.T. Cha H.H. Firestone G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12414-12422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Recombinant p53 protein was produced in insect cells infected with a baculovirus vector expressing human WT p53 and partially purified through affinity chromatography. 32P-labeled probes (2 × 104 cpm) were mixed with 0.5 μg of purified recombinant p53 in a 20-μl DNA binding reaction buffer consisting of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 4% Ficoll-400, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mg of poly(dI-dC). For specificity or competition controls, a labeled random oligonucleotide and excess of unlabeled corresponding oligonucleotide were added together in the reactions. For supershift, 100 ng of the anti-p53 monoclonal antibodies (pAb 421 or pAb 1801, Oncogene Research Products) was included. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 4 °C for 20 min, resolved by a 4% polyacrylamide gel, and exposed for auto-radiography. Oligonucleotides (5′-3′) used in electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) are: p73-36W, CCCGACTTGGACGCGGCCAGCTGGAGAGGCGGAGCG; p73-36M1, CCCGACTTttACGCGGCCAGCTGGAGAGGCGGAGCG; p73-36M2, CCCGACTTtGACGCGGCCAGCTGGAGAGGCGGAGCG; p73-36M3, CCCGACTTGGACGCGGCCAGCgGGAGAGGCGGAGCG; p21-30W, GGAAGAAGACTGGGCATGTCTGGGCAGAGA; nonspecific oligonucleotide NS30W, TCTCTCAGGCCTGCTGCTTAGGAGGCAACT; mp73-32W, TAGGAAACCCGGACTGCAGGCCGTGGCCCCCG. Transcriptional Regulation of TAp73 by p53 in Signaling Apoptotic Stress Response—To reveal the mechanism of the cellular response to genotoxic stress, we performed microarray analysis of gene expression profiles under stress conditions. We observed that TAp73 expression is increased following oxidative damage (data not shown). Because p53 is a controller of this process, we proposed that p53 is a regulator of TAp73. To determine whether p53 regulates the transcription of TAp73, we examined the expression of TAp73α, the full-length form of TAp73, in the p53-inducible system, EB-1. The EB cell line was originally derived from a human colon cancer with a mutant p53 gene. EB-1 is a stable cell clone of EB that expresses ectopic wild-type p53 (WT p53) under the control of the metallothionein promoter. p53 is induced by ZnCl2 (47Shaw P. Bovey R. Tardy S. Sahli R. Sordat B. Costa J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4495-4499Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar). EB-1 cells undergo cell cycle arrest following WT p53 induction alone and typical apoptosis following serum deprivation in the presence of p53 (23Yin Y. Liu Y.X. Jin Y.J. Hall E.J. Barrett J.C. Nature. 2003; 422: 527-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 47Shaw P. Bovey R. Tardy S. Sahli R. Sordat B. Costa J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4495-4499Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, the transcriptional level of p21, a p53 target gene involved in cell cycle regulation (48El Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7916) Google Scholar, 49Xiong Y. Hannon G.J. Zhang H. Casso D. Kobayashi R. Beach D. Nature. 1993; 366: 701-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (3171) Google Scholar), is low in uninduced EB-1 cells (middle panel, lane 1) but elevated following WT p53 induction by ZnCl2 (middle panel, lanes 2 and 3). TAp73α transcripts are undetectable in EB-1 without p53 (upper panel, lane 1). Interestingly, TAp73α transcription is only slightly induced in EB-1 cells with ZnCl2 (lane 1 versus lane 2), although p21 levels are highly increased (middle panel, lane 2), and cell cycle progression is blocked (8Brugarolas J. Chandrasekaran C. Gordon J.I. Beach D. Jacks T. Hannon G.J. Nature. 1995; 377: 552-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar, 23Yin Y. Liu Y.X. Jin Y.J. Hall E.J. Barrett J.C. Nature. 2003; 422: 527-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). However, TAp73α expression is greatly increased in EB-1 cells treated with both ZnCl2 and serum starvation (upper panel, lane 3) or H2O2 (lane 6), both of which increase the levels of p53 protein (lanes 3 and 6) and induce apoptosis (23Yin Y. Liu Y.X. Jin Y.J. Hall E.J. Barrett J.C. Nature. 2003; 422: 527-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 47Shaw P. Bovey R. Tardy S. Sahli R. Sordat B. Costa J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4495-4499Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar). ZnCl2 has no effect on TAp73α in parental EB cells (data not shown). We further examined the protein levels of TAp73α under these conditions. Although p53 protein is induced in the presence of ZnCl2 (Fig. 1B, lanes 2, 3, 5, and 6), the expression of TAp73α protein is increased only when p53 is induced by ZnCl2 plus serum starvation or oxidative damage (Fig. 1B, upper panel, lanes 3 and 6). Our results suggest that TAp73α is regulated by p53 and that stress conditions are necessary for TAp73α induction. To determine whether p53 is required for the induction of TAp73α transcription, we tested normal and p53-null mouse embryo fibroblasts (p53+/+ and p53–/– MEFs) for TAp73α expression in response to oxidative damage by H2O2, which induces apoptosis (43Yin Y. Solomon G. Deng C. Barrett J.C. Mol. Carcinog. 1999; 24: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We used a ribonuclease protection assay (RPA) for precise detection and quantitation of TAp73α mRNA following oxidative stress. As shown in Fig. 1C, the level of TAp73α mRNA is extremely low in p53+/+ MEFs (lane 1). However, TAp73α transcription is increased 11–12-fold following oxidative damage by H2O2 (lanes 2–4). In contrast, the level of TAp73α transcription is only increased by 1–1.5-fold in p53–/– MEFs following oxidative damage (lanes 5–8). Similarly, the expression of TAp73α protein is greatly increased following oxidative stress (Fig. 1D, lane 1 versus lane 3) in p53+/+ MEFs but not in p53–/– MEFs (Fig. 1D, lane 5 versus lane 7). TAp73α protein is not induced during cell cycle arrest caused by either γ-irradiation or serum starvation in these p53+/+ MEFs (Fig. 1D, lanes 2 and 4), although p21 is induced under these conditions. p21 is up-regulated by p53 following γ-irradiation or serum starvation in these MEFs at the translational and transcriptional levels (Fig. 1, D and E, lanes 2 and 4). These observations suggest that TAp73 is specifically inducible by oxidative stress in a p53-dependent manner and that p53 can regulate TAp73 in response to ox"
https://openalex.org/W2007096865,"ING proteins are putative tumor suppressor proteins linked to the p53 pathway and to the chromatin modification machinery. Here we have analyzed the role of the products of the murine Ing1 locus in cellular tumor-protective responses, using mouse primary fibroblasts where the Ing1 locus has been inactivated by the integration of a βgeo cassette. We show that Ing1-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts display a defective senescence-like antiproliferative response against oncogenic Ras, affecting several senescence-specific markers. This phenotype is accompanied by a reduced accumulation of p53, which can be explained by the reduced basal p53 protein stability in the Ing1-deficient background. Ing1 deficiency also results in defects in the appearance of heterochromatic marks upon expression of oncogenic Ras, suggestive of impaired heterochromatin formation during oncogene-induced senescence. Our results support an important role for the Ing1 locus in protection against oncogenic stress in vivo, both as a mediator of p53 activation and as a regulator of chromatin remodeling processes. ING proteins are putative tumor suppressor proteins linked to the p53 pathway and to the chromatin modification machinery. Here we have analyzed the role of the products of the murine Ing1 locus in cellular tumor-protective responses, using mouse primary fibroblasts where the Ing1 locus has been inactivated by the integration of a βgeo cassette.

Cepero E. Evan G. Nature. 2004; 432: 307-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar). The ING family of proteins includes several sequence-related and evolutionarily conserved proteins, connected both with the p53 pathway and with chromatin modification processes (reviewed in Refs. 2Shi X.

Several ING proteins have been shown to act as upstream regulators of p53 in overexpression experiments, either increasing p53 protein stability (4Leung K.M. Po L.S. Tsang F.C. Siu W.Y. Lau A.

In support of a possible role as tumor suppressors in human cancer, alterations in ING1, and other members of the ING family, have been described in different types of human tumors, including altered expression and aberrant subcellular localization and, less frequently, point mutation or homozygous deletion (19Nouman G.S.

Nature. 2004; 428: 328-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). The physiological significance of the in vitro data described above and the actual role of ING proteins in tumor-protective responses in vivo remain to be unequivocally tested. In this study, we have used primary embryonic fibroblasts derived from transgenic mice where the Ing1 locus has been disrupted by a gene trap cassette to address the participation of the products of this locus in p53-mediated cellular responses to stress. We find that Ing1 deficiency results in defects in p53 activation and chromatin remodeling, in the context of the protective response against oncogenic stress in murine fibroblasts, suggesting a critical role for the Ing1 locus in cellular senescence triggered by oncogenic stress. Generation of Ing1 Gene Trap Mice—The generation and phenotypical characterization of the Ing1 gene trap mice will be described in detail elsewhere. Essentially, murine embryonic stem cells (TBV-2) were electroporated with the gene trap vector pT1ATGbgeo as part of a genome-wide gene trapping screen (21Hansen J. Floss T. Van Sloun P. Fuchtbauer E.M. Vauti F. Arnold H.H. Schnutgen F. Wurst W. von Melchner H. Ruiz P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9918-9922Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The integration site of selected clones was identified by nucleotide sequencing, using a semi-automated 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends-PCR protocol. One clone with a single copy insertion in the murine Ing1 locus was used to generate chimeric mice by blastocyst injection, and germ line transmitting animals were bred to generate mice with targeted Ing1 alleles. Cell Culture—Preparation and passage of MEFs 4The abbreviations used are: MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; RT, reverse transcription; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine. and retroviral infection experiments were carried out as described previously (22Palmero I. Serrano M. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 333: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Fibroblasts from individual embryos from over 10 different litters were used in the study. The proliferation rate was estimated by counting the number of BrdUrd-positive cells by immunofluorescence (14Gonzalez L. Freije J.M. Cal S. Lopez-Otin C. Serrano M. Palmero I. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 5173-5179Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). For protein turnover assays, cycloheximide (Sigma) was added to the medium at a final concentration of 30 μg/ml. For growth curves, after infection and selection, cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 104 per well in 24-well dishes. At the indicated time points, cells were trypsinized and counted. Senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity was detected as described previously (22Palmero I. Serrano M. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 333: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Western Blotting Analysis—Preparation of total cell lysates, electrophoresis, and Western blot analysis were carried out as described (23Palmero I. Murga M. Zubiaga A. Serrano M. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2939-2947Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The following antibodies were used: anti-p33 ING1 (LG-1, a rabbit polyclonal against the C terminus of the human p33 ING1 protein; 1:1000 dilution), anti-p53 (CM-5, Novocastra; 1:500), anti-p19 ARF (54-75, a gift of David Parry, DNAX; 1:500), anti-p16 INK4a (M156, Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:100), anti-p21 CIP1 (sc-397, Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:500), anti-acetyl-p53 (Lys-373) (06-758, Trevigen; 1:100), anti-phospho-p53 (Ser-15) (16G8, Cell Signaling; 1:500), anti-H-Ras (sc-35, Biotechnology; 1:100), and anti-DcR2 (AAP-371C, StressGen; 1:250). An antibody against β-actin (AC-15, Sigma; 1:10,000) was used to control for equal loading. Immunoprecipitation—Immunoprecipitation was carried out essentially as described previously (14Gonzalez L. Freije J.M. Cal S. Lopez-Otin C. Serrano M. Palmero I. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 5173-5179Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Ten microliters of agarose-conjugated anti-p53 antibody slurry (sc-6243AC, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used for immunoprecipitation from total cell lysates. The immunocomplexes were resolved in 8% acrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for 3 h in 10% SDS. RT-PCR—Total RNA was prepared from asynchronously growing MEFs of early passage, using TRI Reagent (Sigma), and used to synthesize cDNA by reverse transcription, which was subsequently used for standard PCRs or real time quantitative PCR. The primers used are as follows: Ing1 exon 1a forward, 5′-CCTTCTCGTCCAGATTGG-3; Ing1 exon 1b forward, 5′-ATGTTGAGTCCTGCCAACGG-3; Ing1 exon 1b reverse, 5′-CTTGGTATTTGGCGTCGATCTCC-3; Ing1 exon 1c forward, 5′-ATCGCTTGTCGCGTTTCC-3; Ing1 exon 2 reverse, 5′-CTACCTGTTGTAAGCCC-3 (for standard PCR); and 5′-ACCAGCTCCACCATCTGACT-3′ (for quantitative PCR assays); β-Geo reverse, 5′-GATGTGCTGCAAGGCGATTA-3; Ing2 forward, 5′-CAGCAGCAGCTGTACTCG-3; Ing2 reverse, 5′-ATCACAGTCGTCAATCCCG-3; β-actin forward, 5′-TTGTAACCAACTGGGACGACATGG-3; β-actin reverse, 5′-GATCTTGATCTTCATGGTGCTAGG-3. For quantitative PCR, a Corbett Research Rotor Gene apparatus was used, following the manufacturer's instructions. Immunofluorescence—Immunofluorescence was carried out essentially as described in Gonzalez et al. (14Gonzalez L. Freije J.M. Cal S. Lopez-Otin C. Serrano M. Palmero I. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 5173-5179Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). p53 was detected with antibody CM5 (1:250 dilution) and p19 ARF with antibody 54-75 (1:250 dilution). Histone 3 trimethylated in Lys-9 (H3K9) was detected with antibody MAB3450 from Chemicon, and HP1γ with antibody 07-442 was from Upstate (both at a 1:2000 dilution). The secondary antibodies used were Alexa 594-conjugated goat anti-rabbit, Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse, and Alexa-488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (from Molecular Probes; 1:500 dilution). For quantitation of the staining intensities of heterochromatin markers in individual cells, regions of interest were defined so that they would fit in all nuclei, and the intensity for each channel was measured for all the individual regions of interest, using the Leica confocal image analysis software. At least 100 cells, from at least two different slides, were used for quantitation. Characterization of Ing1-deficient MEFs—The murine Ing1 locus contains four exons (1a, 1b, 1c, and 2), which give rise to three different transcripts through alternative splicing events (Fig. 1A). Their translation is predicted to give rise to two peptides: p33 ING1 (from an ATG codon in exon 1b) and p24 (from an internal ATG in exon 2) (24Zeremski M. Hill J.E. Kwek S.S. Grigorian I.A. Gurova K.V. Garkavtsev I.V. Diatchenko L. Koonin E.V. Gudkov A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32172-32181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We have mapped the site of integration of the βgeo cassette to the intron between exons 1b and 1c, 67 bp upstream of the start of exon 1c (Fig. 1A). Western blot analysis with a polyclonal antiserum against the C terminus of p33 and p24, in wild-type MEFs, revealed a band with a relative mobility of ∼37 kDa, corresponding to p33 ING1 (Fig. 1B) (24Zeremski M. Hill J.E. Kwek S.S. Grigorian I.A. Gurova K.V. Garkavtsev I.V. Diatchenko L. Koonin E.V. Gudkov A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32172-32181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A specific band with a mobility corresponding to p24 was never detected in our experiments. Western blot analysis in gene trap MEFs revealed a weak band of the same mobility as p33 ING1, most likely reflecting residual expression of the wild-type transcript, because of splicing around the gene trap insertion. Consistent with this result, RT-PCR analysis revealed a weak and barely detectable band for the wild-type transcript containing exons 1b and 2 in MEFs homozygous for the gene trap insertion. Similarly, the expression of the transcripts containing exon 1a or exon 1c was significantly reduced in the gene trap fibroblasts (Fig. 1C). The dramatic effect observed for the exon 1c-containing transcript is likely caused by the disruption of regulatory sequences in the exon 1c promoter by the integration of the βgeo cassette (Fig. 1A). Quantitative RT-PCR indicates that the amount of the 1b transcript in the gene trap MEFs is reduced to around 5% of wild-type levels. Similarly, the amount of p33 ING1 protein in the gene trap cells was reduced to ∼15% of normal levels (Fig. 1D). Among ING proteins, ING2 is the family member most closely related to ING1, both in terms of sequence and function (9Doyon Y. Cayrou C. Ullah M. Landry A.J. Cote V. Selleck W. Lane W.S. Tan S. Yang X.J. Cote J. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 51-64Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). To rule out possible compensation by other members of the ING family, we looked at the expression of the ING2 transcript by RT-PCR, and we found no significant differences between gene trap and wild-type cells (Fig. 1C). These results prove that the insertion of the gene trap cassette in the murine Ing1 locus has resulted in a dramatic reduction of the expression levels of all Ing1 transcripts and p33 ING1 protein, and they validate homozygous Ing1 gene trap MEFs (Ing1βgeo/βgeo, hereafter designated as g/g MEFs) as a valuable cellular model to study the impact of the deficiency of the products of this locus. Impact on Ras-induced Senescence—Chronic expression of an oncogenic version of the Ha-Ras oncogene (RasV12) triggers an antiproliferative response in primary cells, reminiscent of cellular senescence (25Serrano M. Lin A.W. McCurrach M.E. Beach D. Lowe S.W. Cell. 1997; 88: 593-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3942) Google Scholar). In MEFs, this response is mediated primarily by the ARF-p53 pathway (25Serrano M. Lin A.W. McCurrach M.E. Beach D. Lowe S.W. Cell. 1997; 88: 593-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3942) Google Scholar, 26Palmero I. Pantoja C. Serrano M. Nature. 1998; 395: 125-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar) and involves the stabilization and specific post-translational modifications of p53 (27Ferbeyre G. de Stanchina E. Querido E. Baptiste N. Prives C. Lowe S.W. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2015-2027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Pearson M. Carbone R. Sebastiani C. Cioce M. Fagioli M. Saito S. Higashimoto Y. Appella E. Minucci S. Pandolfi P.P. Pelicci P.G. Nature. 2000; 406: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar). Given the well established link of p33 ING1 to p53, and its putative role as a tumor suppressor gene, we decided to test the impact of Ing1 depletion in Ras-induced cell cycle arrest, a tumor-protective response mediated by p53. First, we measured the proliferation rate of retrovirally infected MEFs of both genotypes by BrdUrd incorporation. As expected, wild-type MEFs expressing RasV12 showed a clear reduction in the number of BrdUrd-positive cells, relative to vector-infected controls. Ing1 g/g MEFs, in contrast, were largely insensitive to the effect of Ras and showed a rate of BrdUrd-positive cells similar to or even higher than their controls (Fig. 2A and supplemental Fig. 1). The different response to Ras was also evident when we measured the growth rate of infected fibroblasts of both genotypes, over a period of 9 days post-selection. Although wild-type MEFs with Ras virtually did not increase in cell number during that period, Ing1-deficient MEFs with Ras grew at a rate slightly faster than their controls (Fig. 2B). Also, although Ras-infected wild-type MEFs displayed markers of the senescent phenotype, such as the senescence-associated β-galactosidase staining and a distinctive flattened morphology, Ing1-deficient MEFs retained a normal morphology and very low number of senescence-associated β-galactosidase-positive cells (Fig. 2, C and D). We wished to determine whether the attenuation in the antiproliferative response to Ras rendered Ing1-deficient cells fully permissive to Ras-induced transformation. With this purpose, infected fibroblasts were injected in the flank of nude mice, and the appearance of visible tumors was scored. No tumors were observed in wild-type or Ing1-deficient MEFs expressing oncogenic Ras, after up to 40 days, in conditions where Ras-infected p53-null MEFs formed sizable tumors (supplemental Fig. 2). Furthermore, no evidence of oncogenic transformation of Ing1-deficient cells was either observed in soft agar colony assays or foci formation assays (data not shown). Interestingly, the impact of Ing1 deficiency appears to be specific to the response to oncogenic stress, whereas other p53-mediated phenotypes we have studied in this and other cell types were not altered. For instance, g/g MEFs enter replicative senescence and reach immortalization at a rate indistinguishable from wild-type MEFs (supplemental Fig. 3). Also, apoptosis triggered by DNA damage or other stimuli in thymocytes is not affected by Ing1 status (supplemental Fig. 4). To understand the molecular basis of the impaired senescent response to Ras, we analyzed by Western blot the levels of several proteins involved in Ras-induced cellular senescence. The antiproliferative response elicited by Ras in mouse fibroblasts is typically accompanied by an accumulation of the p53 protein, which is mediated by the up-regulation of p19 ARF (26Palmero I. Pantoja C. Serrano M. Nature. 1998; 395: 125-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). Notably, the expression of RasV12 in g/g MEFs failed to provoke an increase of p53 protein levels at the same extent as wild-type cells (Fig. 3A), reflecting a defect in accumulation of p53 upon oncogenic stress. Basal p19 ARF levels were increased in g/g cells, most likely due to their higher population doubling number. Nevertheless, p19 ARF induction by Ras was similar to wild-type cells, suggesting that the signaling machinery linking oncogenic stress with ARF activation is not affected by the suppression of p33 ING1. Likewise, induction of the other product of the Ink4a/ARF locus, p16 INK4a, was observed irrespective of the presence of Ing1. p21 CIP1 protein levels were also increased in Ras-infected wild-type cells, as described previously, and no obvious difference was observed in g/g cells (Fig. 3B). The observed induction of p21 CIP1 in both genotypes, irrespective of arrest induction, most likely reflects a p53-independent effect of Ras expression on p21 protein levels (29Kivinen L. Tsubari M.

They also showed that Ing1 status did not affect the subcellular localization of either protein in the presence or absence of oncogenic stress (Fig. 3C). Impact on p53 Regulation—We decided to investigate the basis of the defective accumulation of p53 observed upon expression of oncogenic Ras. It has been proposed that p33 ING1 can contribute to p53 activity, both by increasing p53 protein stability (4Leung K.M. Po L.S. Tsang F.C. Siu W.Y. Lau A. Ho H.T. Poon R.Y. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 4890-4893PubMed Google Scholar) and by favoring the acetylation of specific lysine residues in the C terminus of the p53 protein (6Kataoka H. Bonnefin P. Vieyra D. Feng X. Hara Y. Miura Y. Joh T. Nakabayashi H. Vaziri H. Harris C.C. Riabowol K. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5785-5792PubMed Google Scholar). With this background, we first investigated whether the differences in p53 accumulation might reflect differences in basal protein stability. With this purpose, we measured the half-life of the p53 protein in MEFs of both genotypes by Western blot at different time points after inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide. As shown in Fig. 4, A and B, the half-life of p53 protein appeared significantly reduced in g/g cells. Different members of the ING family, including p33 ING1, have been shown to increase acetylation of p53 when overexpressed (5Nagashima M. Shiseki M. Miura K. Hagiwara K. Linke S.P. Pedeux R. Wang X.W. Yokota J. Riabowol K. Harris C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9671-9676Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 6Kataoka H. Bonnefin P. Vieyra D. Feng X. Hara Y. Miura Y. Joh T. Nakabayashi H. Vaziri H. Harris C.C. Riabowol K. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5785-5792PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether Ing1 could play a role in p53 acetylation in vivo, we investigated the degree of p53 acetylation after exposure to the genotoxic drug adriamycin, a stimulus known to trigger robust acetylation of p53 (33Bode A.M. Dong Z. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 793-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4C and data not shown). Using immunoprecipitation followed by Western blot with two commercial acetylation-specific antibodies, we could detect acetylated p53 with a comparable intensity in samples both from wild-type and Ing1 g/g MEFs treated with adriamycin. Similarly, Western blot with an antibody against serine 15-phosphorylated p53 gave indistinguishable results in both genotypes (Fig. 4C). These results support a role for Ing1 in control of p53 stability, although they rule out a significant role of Ing1 products in control of p53 post-translational modification in this setting. Chromatin Changes during Ras-induced Senescence—The implementation of cellular senescence in human primary fibroblasts, either triggered by oncogenic stress or by the accumulation of population doublings, involves changes in chromatin structure, with the appearance of heterochromatin domains linked to specific gene silencing (34Narita M.

Taking into account the participation of p33 ING1 in the control of histone modifications and chromatin structure, and prompted by the defects in Ras-induced arrest observed in Ing1-deficient MEFs, we studied the changes in chromatin structure after RasV12 infection in MEFs of normal and mutant genotypes. With this aim, we carried out immunofluorescence experiments with antibodies against histone 3 trimethylated in Lys-9 (H3K9) or HP1γ as markers of heterochromatin. The nuclear distribution of either of the heterochromatic marks studied was not overtly changed by RasV12 expression in cells of either genotype. However, when we quantitated the fluorescence intensity in individual nuclei (see Experimental Procedures), we observed a significant increase in H3K9 and HP1γ signals per nucleus in wild-type MEFs infected with RasV12 retroviruses, relative to vector-infected cells. (Fig. 5, A and B). When we analyzed both markers in Ras-infected g/g fibroblasts, we observed an increase in H3K9 signal, which was indistinguishable to wild-type cells. However, HP1γ staining in g/g cells remained unchanged after Ras infection (Fig. 5, A and B). Also, when the fluorescence signals for H3K9 and HP1γ were simultaneously scored for individual nuclei, we observed that expression of RasV12 translates in a clear correlation for both markers in wild-type cells, but this correlation was not observed in homozygous Ing1 gene trap MEFs (Fig. 5C). Taken together, these results suggest a role for Ing1 in HP1 binding to chromatin and presumably heterochromatin formation during Ras-induced senescence in mouse fibroblasts. The role of the family of ING proteins in tumor protection has recently attracted a substantial amount of interest. Biochemical evidence supports their connection to the p53 pathway and their participation in multiprotein complexes with chromatin modification activities. Thus, ING proteins might represent an important link between p53-mediated responses and chromatin regulation. In this study, we have taken a genetic approach to investigate the physiological role of the murine Ing1 locus in cellu"

Modification of Aβ by 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) initially increases the hydrophobicity of these peptides and subsequently leads to additional reactions, such as peptide cross-linking. To model these initial events, without confounding effects of subsequent reactions, we modified Aβ at each of its amino groups using a chemically simpler, close analogue of 4-HNE, the octanoyl group: K16-octanoic acid (OA)-Aβ, K28-OA-Aβ, and Nα-OA-Aβ. Octanoylation of these sites on Aβ-(1–40) had strikingly different effects on fibril formation. K16-OA-Aβ and K28-OA-Aβ, but not Nα-OA-Aβ, had increased propensity to aggregate. The type of aggregate (electron microscopic appearance) differed with the site of modification. The ability of octanoyl-Aβ peptides to cross-seed solutions of Aβ was the inverse of their ability to form fibrils on their own (i.e. Aβ ≈ Nα-OA-Aβ >> K16-OA-Aβ >> K28-OA-Aβ). By CD spectroscopy, K16-OA-Aβ and K28-OA-Aβ had increased β-sheet propensity compared with Aβ-(1–40) or Nα-OA-Aβ. K16-OA-Aβ and K28-OA-Aβ were more amphiphilic than Aβ-(1–40) or Nα-OA-Aβ, as shown by lower “critical micelle concentrations” and higher monolayer collapse pressures. Finally, K16-OA-Aβ and K28-OA-Aβ are much more cytotoxic to N2A cells than Aβ-(1–40) or Nα-OA-Aβ. The greater cytotoxicity of K16-OA-Aβ and K28-OA-Aβ may reflect their greater amphiphilicity. We conclude that lipidation can make Aβ more prone to aggregation and more cytotoxic, but these effects are highly site-specific. β-Amyloid (Aβ) aggregates at low concentrations in vivo, and this may involve covalently modified forms of these peptides.

One recently proposed answer to this question is that an aggregation-prone, covalently modified Aβ could catalyze aggregation of the unmodified peptide. In addition to catalyzing peptide aggregation, aldehyde-modified Aβ could also be cytotoxic to neurons by itself.

In this paper, we address two outstanding issues related to the effects of 4-HNE on the aggregation of Aβ. 1) There is little information on site-specific effects of 4-hydroxynonenal. Position-nonspecific addition of this lipid group seems to increase the propensity of Aβ to aggregate. 4-HNE, however, can react with amino, imidazole, guanidino, and hydroxyl groups (and thiols, which are not present in Aβ). These groups comprise nine of the 40 residues in Aβ-(1–40). It is unlikely that the addition of 4-HNE to all of these sites would have identical effects on aggregation. 2) There is little information that distinguishes initial versus subsequent effects of 4-HNE on protein aggregation. The initial addition of 4-HNE to a protein is followed by subsequent reactions of the adduct (21Bieschke J. Zhang Q. Bosco D.A. Lerner R.A. Powers E.T. Wentworth Jr., P. Kelly J.W. Acc. Chem. Res. 2006; 39: 611-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 34Sayre L.M. Lin D. Yuan Q. Zhu X. Tang X. Drug Metab. Rev. 2006; 38: 651-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 35Aoyama K.

Med. 2004; 37: 937-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). 4-HNE can form Michael adducts and Schiff bases, both of which can lead to protein cross-linking, cyclization, and rearrangements of the adduct. For example, the double bond of Michael adducts or Schiff bases can undergo epoxidation, and the 4-hydroxy group can be further oxidized to an aldehyde, either of which can lead to protein cross-linking by reaction with amino groups on adjacent molecules. Thus, 4-HNE initially increases the hydrophobicity of a protein and subsequently leads to protein cross-linking. Although either of these could increase Aβ aggregation, from the mechanistic point of view, it is important to distinguish between these two effects. To address these questions, we sought a model of 4-HNE that could conveniently be added to specific sites on Aβ, but not undergo subsequent reactions. Such a model would enable us to examine the role of increasing the hydrophobicity of the peptide at specific sites, without confounding effects, such as protein cross-linking or adduct rearrangements. For this reason, we chose to examine Aβ octanoylated at specific sites. The octanoyl group is similar to 4-HNE in chain length and polarity and is thus a good model for the lipidic effects of 4-HNE but, in contrast to the latter group, makes stable adducts. In this paper, we will describe synthetic Aβ with octanoyl adducts at its three amino groups, the side chains of Lys16 and Lys28 and the N-terminal amine, which are prone to modification by aldehydes. We will present evidence that the octanoylated Aβ peptides are more prone to aggregation and are more cytotoxic than unmodified Aβ. The magnitude and type of effect, however, depends strongly on the site of modification. We will also show that for this series of peptides, there is an inverse relationship between the ability of the peptide to form fibrils and its ability to induce mixed aggregates with unmodified Aβ. Peptide Synthesis, Lipidation, and Purification—The human Aβ-(1–40) peptide was synthesized manually by solid phase methods using standard t-butoxycarbonyl chemistry: NH2-DAEFRHDSGY10EVHHQKLVFF20AEDVGSNKGA30IIGLMVGGVV40-COOH. Peptides were prepared using preloaded (phenylacetamido)methyl resins (AnaSpec). Amino acids were deprotected with trifluoroacetic acid and coupled for 10 min with 0.5 m 2-(1H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (Peptides International). Peptides were cleaved from the resin with hydrogen fluoride in the presence of p-cresol and purified using a reverse-phase, C18 preparative HPLC column (Rainin Dynamax) with an acetonitrile gradient in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at 60 °C. Peptide purity was greater than 95% by analytical HPLC (Rainin C18 column). The molecular masses of the peptides were verified with electrospray ionization and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The addition of octanoyl groups was essentially as described previously (40Gordon D.J. Balbach J.J. Tycko R. Meredith S.C. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 428-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). For Aβ that was to be octanoylated at Lys16 or Lys28, (α-t-butoxycarbonyl)-l-Lys(ϵ-9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl) (AnaSpec) was incorporated into the peptide chain. The side chain 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl group was then removed with 20% piperidine, and octanoic acid was coupled to the free ϵ-amino group using 0.2 m O-(7-azabenzotriazole-1-yl)-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (Applied Biosystems). To octanoylate Aβ at its N terminus, the N-terminal t-butoxycarbonyl protecting group was removed, after which octanoic acid was added to the free amino group as described above. Lipidated peptides were purified as described for unmodified Aβ. As predicted, octanoylation of Aβ rendered it more hydrophobic, as shown by later elution from the C18 reverse phase HPLC column (supplemental Fig. 1). After purification, all peptides were lyophilized and then redissolved in acetonitrile/water/trifluoroacetic acid (30:70:0.1, v/v/v), and the concentration was measured by absorbance at 274.6 nm, using the extinction coefficient for tyrosine of 1183 m-1 cm-1 in this solvent. The peptide was then divided into aliquots containing 0.4 mg of purified peptide, lyophilized in siliconized tubes, and stored at -20 °C. In all cases, we used Aβ-(1–40), which hereafter will be referred to simply as Aβ. Immunohistochemistry—Immunohistochemical staining was performed on 4-μm sections from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded autopsy tissue. The tissue was obtained from autopsy-proven cases of Alzheimer disease that had a documented high amyloid plaque load based on the performed diagnostic markers that included immunohistochemical staining for β-amyloid and Bielschowski staining. Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked with 3% hydrogen peroxide. Antigen retrieval was carried out in citrate buffer (10 mm, pH 6.0) for 15 min at 100 °C in a microwave oven. A primary anti-HNE-Michael adduct antibody (a kind gift from Luke I. Szweda, Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation) at 1:1000 dilution was applied overnight at 4 °C. A subsequent reaction was performed with biotin-free horseradish peroxidase-labeled polymer of the EnVision plus detection system (DAKO, Carpinteria, CA). A positive reaction was visualized with diaminobenzidine solution followed by counterstaining with hematoxylin. Appropriate negative controls for the immunostaining were prepared by using nonimmune rabbit IgG. Fibrillogenesis Assays—Formation of fibrils was performed essentially as described earlier (41Sciarretta K.L. Gordon D.J. Petkova A.T. Tycko R. Meredith S.C. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 6003-6014Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Peptide aliquots were solubilized to 5 mm in Me2SO and diluted to 100 μm with 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.40. Peptide solutions were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was collected. Concentrations were confirmed by UV absorbance at 274.6 nm, using the extinction coefficient for tyrosine of 1420 m-1 cm-1 in this solvent, and corrected to ∼100 μm, unless otherwise indicated. Peptide solutions were incubated without stirring at 37 °C. Fibril aggregation kinetics were measured using a thioflavin T (ThT) assay on 10-μl aliquots, as described previously (42LeVine H. II I Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 274-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1213) Google Scholar). Data were fit to equations described below by nonlinear least squares analysis using Kaleidagraph software. Electron Microscopy—After incubation at 37 °C for sufficient time to form visible precipitates, 5-μl aliquots of fibril slurries were applied to glow-discharged, 1–400-mesh, carbon-coated support films, washed with water, and stained with 1% uranyl acetate for 30 s. Micrographs were recorded using a FEI Tecnai F30 electron microscope at magnifications of ×15,000 and ×98,000; the figures show an additional ×1.4 camera magnification. Circular Dichroic Spectroscopy—The CD spectra were recorded using an Aviv model 202 CD spectropolarimeter (Lakewood, NJ) equipped with a temperature-controlled holder. Peptides were dissolved in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.40. A 1-mm path length was used for measurements. The CD measurements were collected at 0.5-nm intervals from 265 to 190 nm with a 1-s averaging time and a 1-nm bandwidth. Five scans were collected, and the data were averaged and base line-corrected. For CD spectroscopy of peptide alone, aliquots of lyophilized peptide were dissolved in 500 μl of hexafluoroisopropyl alcohol (HFIP), and the mixture was then sonicated for 15 pulses using a Branson Sonifier 450 probe sonicator (Danbury, CT) at a power setting of 4.5. The HFIP was then evaporated under a gentle stream of N2. Although Me2SO is preferable for initial solubilization of Aβ, this solvent cannot be used for far UV CD spectroscopy. For measuring spectra, peptides were dissolved in 600 μl of 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.40. The peptide was centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was withdrawn, and its concentration was measured by absorbance at 274.6 nm, as described above. CD spectroscopy of the peptides in the presence of phospholipids was performed in two different ways. First, CD spectra were measured of peptides mixed with preformed 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospocholine (POPC) vesicles. Vesicles were formed by dissolving the phospholipids (Avanti Polar Lipids) in CHCl3/CH3OH (1:1, v/v) at a concentration of 2.5 mg/ml. Solvent was evaporated by a gentle stream of N2, and the lipid was suspended in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.40, by vortexing to yield a final lipid concentration of 1 mm POPC. The suspension was then sonicated as described above. For CD spectroscopy, POPC vesicles were added to peptide to yield a final peptide/POPC ratio of 1:20 (mol/mol). Second, CD spectra were measured of peptides that were mixed with POPC during the formation of vesicles. Peptide (∼0.4 mg) was dissolved in 500 μl of HFIP, and the sample was sonicated as described above. The solvent was then evaporated under a gentle stream of N2. POPC dissolved to 2.5 mg/ml in CHCl3/CH3OH (1:1, v/v) was then added to the peptide film, to give a final peptide/lipid ratio of 1:20 (mol/mol). The solvent was then dried under N2. Control samples consisted of peptide alone, without the lipid. Samples were then suspended in 600 μl of 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.40, and the mixture was then sonicated for 15 pulses at a sonicator setting of 4.5, after which most of the material appeared to be in solution. The mixture was then filtered using 0.2-μm cellulose acetate filters. Because of the possibility of light scattering from vesicles and/or protein aggregates, protein concentrations were measured by absorbance at 274.6 nm and also confirmed by analytical HPLC. Samples were injected onto a Varian Microsorb-MV C18 column (Lake Forest, CA), and the mass of peptide was measured by the area of the peak, compared with Aβ standards. CD spectra of these samples were measured immediately after making them and again at 48, 96, and 168 h. Surface Isotherms of Peptide Monolayers at the Air-Water Interface—Surface isotherms were measured essentially as described previously (40Gordon D.J. Balbach J.J. Tycko R. Meredith S.C. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 428-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). More details of these procedures are given in the supplemental materials. Diphenylhexatriene (DPH) Fluorescence—The critical micelle concentration was estimated using DPH fluorescence (46Zhang X. Jackson J.K. Burt H.M. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1996; 31: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Fluorescence measurements were performed using a Hitachi F-2000 fluorescence spectrophotometer. Because Me2SO interferes with these measurements, peptide samples were dissolved in 1 ml of HFIP to a concentration of ∼75 μm and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was removed, and the HFIP was evaporated under N2. Peptides were then redissolved in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.40, to various concentrations. DPH (Molecular Probes) was dissolved as a stock in tetrahydrofuran to a concentration of 10 mm; for measurements, the stock was diluted with tetrahydrofuran to a concentration of 200 μm. Measurements were made on 300 μl of peptide at various concentrations, to which 7.5 μl of DPH had been added. The samples were kept unsealed to allow evaporation of the tetrahydrofuran but were protected from light by aluminum foil to prevent photobleaching of the DPH. After 5 min of incubation (previous experimentation showed that this time was sufficient to obtain maximum fluorescence), fluorescence of the sample was measured (λEx = 358 nm, λEm = 430 nm) with a bandwidth of 10 nm and the photomultiplier setting at 700 V. Cross-seeding of Aβ by Seeds of Octanoylated Aβ Peptides—We investigated the extent to which fibrils of octanoylated Aβ were able to cross-seed solutions of Aβ; in these measurements, cross-seeding was always compared with self-seeding of Aβ solutions by Aβ fibrils. Fibrils were made specifically for cross-seeding studies starting with aliquots of HPLC-purified peptides. Aliquots of 0.4 μg of peptide were dissolved directly into 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.40, with no disaggregation procedure, to a final concentration of either 100 or 200 μm; no differences were observed between seeds formed at these two concentrations. For forming seeds, solutions were incubated at 37 °C for 168 h; ThT fluorescence was monitored daily, and by 168 h, this value had plateaued. For cross-seeding experiments, Aβ was first solubilized in undiluted Me2SO to a concentration of 5 mm; this was then diluted 50-fold into 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.40, to yield a final concentration of 100 μm. The solution was centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min, and the top ∼90% of the supernatant was taken for the experiment. To the soluble Aβ, seeds of the various peptides or no seeds were added. In all cases, seeds consisted of 1.5 nmol of fibrillar peptide, which represented 5% of the mass of peptide. Measurements represent the average of three experiments, each with two replicates. At various times, ThT fluorescence was measured in aliquots of the seeded solutions of Aβ, as described above. Size Exclusion Chromatography of Aβ and Octanoylated Aβ—Size exclusion chromatography of Aβ and the three octanoylated Aβ peptides was performed using a Superdex 200 (10/300 GL) column on an Agilent 1100 high pressure liquid chromatograph. Column effluent was monitored using a diode array detector, and the absorbances were recorded at 215 and 220 nm; flow rate was 0.5 ml/min. For these experiments, peptides were disaggregated by initially dissolving them in Me2SO, according to the procedure described previously (41Sciarretta K.L. Gordon D.J. Petkova A.T. Tycko R. Meredith S.C. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 6003-6014Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Size exclusion chromatography was performed on peptide solutions at different concentrations; concentration was varied by serial dilution of the initial solutions, which had peptide concentrations of 200 μm. Cell Viability Assay—Neuro2A (N2A) cells, generously provided by Drs. Godfrey Getz, Catherine Reardon, and Gopal Thinakaran, were maintained at 37 °C, 5% CO2, in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. Cells were seeded into 96-well plates and allowed to reach 70% confluence. Growth medium was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without serum or phenol red (“treatment medium”), and the cells were allowed to acclimate overnight. On the next day, half of the liquid in each well was replaced with the treatment medium containing one of the four peptides at various concentrations or treatment medium without peptide. The cells were then returned to the incubator for 2 days, after which cell viability was assessed by measuring the ability of cells to reduce 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide salt to purple formazen crystals. The crystals were solubilized with 10% Triton X-100, 0.1 n HCl in isopropyl alcohol at 37 °C overnight. The absorbance at 570 nm was measured using a Molecular Devices Versamax tunable microplate reader (Sunnyvale, CA); the background at 690 nm was subtracted from the reading. Rationale of These Studies—We synthesized three peptides, one octanoylated at each of the three amino groups in Aβ. The rationale was as follows. 1) As discussed above, 4-hydroxynonenal, a major product of unsaturated fatty acid oxidation, reacts with aggregating proteins and peptides in Alzheimer disease and other neurodegenerative diseases. We confirmed this finding immunohistochemically, using an anti-HNE adduct antibody; as shown in supplemental Fig. 2, localization of immunoreactivity against the 4-HNE adduct occurs in a pattern consistent with neuritic plaque deposition. 2) We wanted to examine the effects of adding a hydrophobic group, such as 4-HNE, on the initial stages of aggregation of Aβ. However, 4-HNE both increases the hydrophobicity of proteins or peptides to which it is added and also undergoes numerous subsequent reactions, including rearrangements and protein cross-linking reactions. In order to focus upon the initial stages of protein aggregation and examine the effects of added hydrophobicity, we sought a model of similar chain length and polarity as 4-HNE, but which would not undergo the subsequent rearrangements to which 4-HNE is prone. The octanoyl group fulfills these criteria, because it is of similar chain length and polarity as 4-HNE but has the advantages of chemical stability and synthetic simplicity (40Gordon D.J. Balbach J.J. Tycko R. Meredith S.C. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 428-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). 3) Although it has been shown that the addition of hydrophobic groups to Aβ increases its aggregation, little information is available on the site-specific effects of modification. There is good reason, however, to expect that modification of different parts of Aβ would have radically different effects. In particular, consider the three amino groups of Aβ, which are readily modified by lipid-derived aldehydes, such as 4-HNE. In the Aβ fibril (47Petkova A.T. Ishii Y. Balbach J.J. Antzutki"
https://openalex.org/W2006931976,"KcsA, a potassium channel from Streptomyces lividans, is a good model for probing the general working mechanism of potassium channels. To date, the physiological activator of KcsA is still unknown, but in vitro studies showed that it could be opened by lowering the pH of the cytoplasmic compartment to 4. The C-terminal domain (CTD, residues 112–160) was proposed to be the modulator for this pH-responsive event. Here, we support this proposal by examining the pH profiles of: (a) thermal stability of KcsA with and without its CTD and (b) aggregation properties of a recombinant fragment of CTD. We found that the presence of the CTD weakened and enhanced the stability of KcsA at acidic and basic pH values, respectively. In addition, the CTD fragment oligomerized at basic pH values with a transition profile close to that of channel opening. Our results are consistent with the CTD being a pH modulator. We propose herein a mechanism on how this domain may contribute to the pH-dependent opening of KcsA.

Permeation of ions across cellular membranes is essential to life, but it is energetically unfavorable due to the dielectric barrier formed by the lipidic components of the membrane. Ion channels provide means to overcome this barrier. These channels allow high flux of ions across the membrane while maintaining high selectivity in a well regulated manner (1Clapham D.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 342-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 2Hille B. Ion Channels of Excitable Membrane.Third Ed. Sinauer Associates, Inc, Sunderland, MA2001: 1-22Google Scholar). The mechanisms of efficiency, selectivity, and open-closed switching of channels have been the focus of many scientists in the field (3Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Ruta V. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2003; 423: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1633) Google Scholar, 4Long S.B. Campbell E.B. Mackinnon R.

Nature. 2003; 425: 200-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Toward these goals, studies on the potassium channel KcsA from Streptomyces lividans have provided a wealth of information. KcsA exists as a homotetramer with each subunit consisting of 160 residues (9Cortes D.M. Perozo E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10343-10352Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 10Schrempf H. Schmidt O. Kummerlen R. Hinnah S. Muller D. Betzler M. Steinkamp T. Wagner R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5170-5178Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Crystal structure of a truncated KcsA (consisting of residues 22–124 without the N- and C-terminal domains) (PDB id 1K4C) showed two transmembrane α-helices separated by a P loop in each subunit (11Doyle D.A. Morais Cabral J. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5696) Google Scholar, 12Zhou Y. Morais-Cabral J.H. Kaufman A. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2001; 414: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (1707) Google Scholar). The tetrameric structure resembles an inverted teepee with the base facing the extracellular side. The wall of the teepee is made up of eight helices (two from each monomer), and the body of the teepee is filled with four P loops (one from each monomer) forming a narrow passage that is selective for K+ ions. A mechanism for efficiency and selectivity was proposed based on this structure (11Doyle D.A. Morais Cabral J. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5696) Google Scholar, 13Noskov S.Y. Roux B. Biophys. Chem. 2006; 124: 279-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The mechanism for open-closed switching of KcsA, however, was not immediately evident from the structure of the truncated molecule in the crystal. KcsA has been demonstrated to be a pH-dependent channel in vitro, and it has been demonstrated that its opening probability increases as the intracellular pH decreases (14Cortes D.M. Cuello L.G. Perozo E. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117: 165-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar,15Heginbotham L. LeMasurier M. Kolmakova-Partensky L. Miller C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 551-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The gating site is located at the narrow opening of the teepee that faces the intracellular space (5Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 417: 523-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar).

Science. 1999; 285: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). The CTD was proposed to be a modulator for open-closed switching (14Cortes D.M. Cuello L.G. Perozo E. J. Gen.

Its partial removal (last 35 residues) destabilized the tetramer and increased ion flux through the channel at neutral pH, suggesting that it stabilized the closed state (14Cortes D.M. Cuello L.G. Perozo E. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117: 165-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). In addition, the deletion mutant was still able to open in a pH-dependent manner but with an altered transition profile, indicating that the primary pH sensor is not located in the last 35 residues (14Cortes D.M. Cuello L.G. Perozo E. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117: 165-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). A recent study suggested that the pH sensor is located at the N terminus end of the first transmembrane helix (H25 (18Takeuchi K. Takahashi H. Kawano S. Shimada I. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 15179-15186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar)). To date, the detailed mechanism of gate opening remains elusive and requires further investigation. We investigated the role of CTD in gate opening by examining (a) its contribution to the thermal stability of KcsA tetramer and (b) its oligomerization, at various pH values. We also proposed a mechanism to relate our findings to the open-closed switching of KcsA.

Cloning of KcsA (rKcsA), C-terminal His-tagged KcsA (chKcsA), and N-terminal His-tagged rCTD of KcsA—The DNA coding for KcsA was amplified by PCR with TaqDNA polymerase (Fermentas) from pQE60/kcsa (a gift from Dr. MacKinnon) with an alanine inserted at the second position to form rKcsA and chKcsA (rKcsA and chKcsA forward primer, 5′-GGTAACCATGGCTCCACCCATGCTGTCCGGTC-3′; rKcsA reverse primer, 5′-GCTAGAATTCCTATTACCGGCGGTTGTCGT-3′; and chKcsA reverse primer, 5′-GATTACCTCGAGCCGGCGGTTGTCGTCGAG-3′; NcoI, EcoRI, and XhoI restriction enzyme recognition sites are underlined in the primer sequences). The amplified products were cloned into a pET28a expression vector (Novagen) at its respective restriction enzyme recognition sites. The DNA coding for recombinant CTD fragment (rCTD) of KcsA (residues 116–160) was also amplified by PCR from pQE60/kcsa (forward primer, 5′-GGTAAGGATCCGGCCGGGAACAAGAGCGC-3′ and reverse primer, 5′-GCTAGAATTCCTATTACCGGCGGTTGTCGT-3′; BamHI and EcoRI restriction enzyme recognition sites are underlined in the primer sequences). The amplified product was cloned into a modified pET28a expression vector (Novagen) using BamHI and EcoRI sites. The modified pET28a expression vector has a BamHI restriction enzyme recognition site incorporated into the codons of the thrombin recognition site at the glycine and serine positions. Positive clones were selected by kanamycin. The plasmids for rKcsA, chKcsA, and rCTD were sequenced (MOBIX, McMaster University) and named pET28a/rkcsa, pET28a/chkcsa, and pET28a/hctd, respectively. Overexpression of rKcsA and chKcsA—Overnight culture of BL21(DE3) transformed with either pET28a/rkcsa or pET28a/chkcsa was diluted 10 times with LB containing 100 μg/ml kanamycin and incubated at 37 °C. After 1.5 h, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to the culture to a final concentration of 1 mm for induction. The culture was further incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. Cells were harvested by centrifuging the culture at 6,000 × g for 15 min. Purification of rKcsA—The cell pellet was resuspended in the lysis buffer (0.8% w/v NaCl, 0.04% w/v KCl, 0.12% w/v Na2HPO4, 0.04% w/v KH2PO4, 7.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.4) and lysed by French press three times at 10,000 p.s.i. The cell lysate was spun at 10,000 × g for 60 min. rKcsA were purified from the pellet and the supernatant. rKcsA in the pellet was solubilized as follows. (a) The pellet was resuspended in the binding buffer (see below) with ∼0.8% w/v LDAO; (b) the resuspension was incubated at room temperature with gentle mixing for 1 h; (c) the mixture was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 22 °C; and (d) the supernatant containing rKcsA was collected for further purification. rKcsA in the supernatant of the low speed centrifugation (10,000 × g) was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 22 °C. rKcsA in this pellet was solubilized as stated previously. Solubilized rKcsA was purified using a HiTrap S column. The column was first equilibrated with binding buffer (25 mm Bicine, K+, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 0.1% w/v LDAO), and the detergent-solubilized rKcsA was subsequently loaded onto the column. rKcsA was eluted with a linear gradient mixture of the binding buffer and elution buffer (25 mm Bicine, K+, pH 8.0, 1.0 m KCl, 0.1% w/v LDAO). The protein came out at 0.2 m KCl. Purification of chKcsA—The cell pellet was resuspended in the lysis buffer (20 mm Bicine, K+, pH 8.0, 150 mm KCl, 7.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and lysed by French press three times at 10,000 p.s.i. The cell lysate was spun at 100,000 × g for 60 min, and chKcsA were solubilized by resuspending the pellet in lysis buffer with 1% w/v LDAO and incubating at room temperature with gentle mixing overnight. The mixture was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 22 °C, and the supernatant was loaded onto a Ni2+-charged HiTrap chelating HP column. The column was washed with the lysis buffer with 0.1% w/v LDAO and 0.05 m imidazole. The bound protein was eluted by increasing the concentration of imidazole to 0.15 m. Chymotrypsin Digestion of rKcsA and chKcsA—80 μl of chymotrypsin (0.1 mg/ml) was added to 4 ml of purified rKcsA or chKcsA (0.25 mg/ml) and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. Subsequently, the reaction was quenched by the addition of 40 μl of 0.3 m phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and further incubated for 30 min. Then, the sample was concentrated with a Vivaspin concentrator (MWCO 50,000 Da) to a final volume of 1 ml. The rKcsA sample was used without further purification as CTD-truncated KcsA (KcsAΔCTD). The chKcsA sample was further purified by using a Ni2+-charged HiTrap chelating HP column to remove the cleaved C-terminal domain as well as any uncleaved chKcsA to generate the C-terminal truncated KcsA (rctKcsA). Reconstitution of rKcsA and rct-KcsA in Liposome and Formation of Giant Liposome—Micellar solution of lipid detergent (7.5 mg/ml POPE, 2.5 mg/ml POPG, 21 mg/ml CHAPS) in reconstitution buffer (450 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0) was prepared according to Heginbotham et al. (15Heginbotham L. LeMasurier M. Kolmakova-Partensky L. Miller C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 551-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 24Heginbotham L. Kolmakova-Partensky L. Miller C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 741-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Purified rKcsA or rctKcsA was added to the micellar solution to a final concentration of 30–60 μg/ml. A mixture of lipid detergent and rKcsA or chKcsA (1 ml) was dialyzed against reconstitution buffer (1 liter) in a dialysis bag (MWCO of 3,500 Da) at room temperature for 12 h with the buffer replaced once at the 6th h. Liposomes containing rKcsA or rctKcsA were fused to form giant liposomes for electrophysiological studies according to the freeze-thaw method of Kasahara and Hinkle (25Kasahara M. Hinkle P.C. The J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 7384-7390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, a glass culture tube with 0.5 ml of rKcsA- or rctKcsA-containing liposomes was put into liquid nitrogen for 2 min and thawed back to room temperature. This freeze-thaw cycle was repeated 5–6 times to produce giant liposomes. Channel Current Measurement by Cell-attached Patch Clamp Technique—All buffer solutions except the one at pH 7 contain 1 mm citric acid, 0.01 mm CaCl2. The pH values (3.8, 4.7, 5.2, and 6.2) of each solution were adjusted by the addition of KOH and KCl to yield a final solution with exactly 100 mm [K+]. The buffer solution at pH 7 contains 95 mm KCl, 5 mm KOH, 10 mm Hepes, and 0.01 mm CaCl2. The pH of this buffer was adjusted to 7 by the addition of HCl. 5 μl of giant liposomes was deposited onto a Petri dish (3.5 cm diameter) containing 200–300 μl of anchoring buffer (10 mm HEPES, 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4). The Petri dish was incubated at room temperature for 20 min to allow liposomes to anchor to the bottom of the dish. The Petri dish was rinsed extensively using the pH 3.8 buffer to remove unanchored liposomes. Then, the pH 3.8 buffer was used as the bath solution. The tip of a patch pipette containing a microelectrode and filled with the pH 3.8 buffer (10–20 megaohms of resistance for the open electrode) was apposed to an anchored liposome with the assistance of a micromanipulator to form a gigaseal (1–10 gigaohms) between the pipette and the liposome. 100 mV was applied across the gigaseal using a Model 2400 patch clamp amplifier (A-M Systems Inc., Carlsborg, WA) with the reference electrode sitting in the Petri dish. Cell-attached current signal (filtered at 2 KHz) was sampled at a rate of 4,096 Hz by a personal computer equipped with a USB-linked LabJack U12 DAQ device (LabJack Corp., Lakewood, CO). Different liposomes would be patched if no channel activity was detected within 30 min. Cell-attached channel currents at different pH values were measured on the same liposome with the bath solution changed to corresponding buffers. The data set was analyzed using the Molecular Devices pClamp 9.0 software (Molecular Devices Corp., Sunnyvale, CA). Thermal Stability Determination—200-μl samples of rKcsA and KcsAΔCTD were dialyzed in dialysis bags (MWCO 3,500 Da) at room temperature overnight against 200-ml solutions of 150 mm KCl, 0.1% v/v LDAO, and 15 mm buffers (pH 3–6, K+-citrate, pH 7, K+-phosphate, pH 8, K+-Hepes). 2 μl of thermal stability test solutions (10% w/v SDS, 9.3% w/v dithiothreitol, and 38% w/v glycerol) was added to 8 μl of dialyzed samples and heated for 30 min at constant temperatures ranging from 30 to 100 °C at 10 °C-intervals. The heated samples were allowed to cool to room temperature and analyzed on 15% SDS-PAGE. Scanned images of the gels were analyzed using ImageJ in integrated intensity mode to determine the amounts of tetramer and monomer in the samples. Fractional tetramer content was calculated by dividing the integrated density of tetramer by the combined integrated densities of tetramer and monomer. The thermal denaturation profiles (plots of fractional tetramer content versus temperature) for all pH values were analyzed to determine the temperatures at which half of the tetramers were dissociated (Tm) directly from the plot without curve fitting. Three independent experiments were performed for each pH and construct. Overexpression and Purification of His-tagged rCTD, rHCTD— Procedures for overexpression of rHCTD and cell lysis were the same as those for rKcsA except that the Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) was transformed with pET28a/hctd instead. Cell lysate was spun at 10,000 × g, and the supernatant was loaded onto a Ni2+-charged HiTrap chelating HP column. The column was washed with the lysis buffer with the addition of 0.1 m imidazole. The bound protein was eluted with 0.5 m imidazole in the lysis buffer. Thrombin Digestion of rHCTD and Purification of rCTD— Thrombin (144 units) was added to a 12-ml solution of purified rHCTD (1 mg/ml), and the reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 15 h to remove the His tag from the rHCTD. Then, the digested mixture was loaded onto a Sep-PaK Vac 12CC C18 cartridge pre-equilibrated with 0.1% v/v trifluoroacetic acid. After sample loading, the cartridge was washed with 12 ml of 0.1% v/v trifluoroacetic acid and followed by 12 ml of 0.1% v/v trifluoroacetic acid in 20% v/v acetonitrile. rCTD was eluted from the cartridge by 12 ml of 0.1% v/v trifluoroacetic acid in 50% v/v acetonitrile. The eluted protein fraction was diluted three times with 0.1% v/v trifluoroacetic acid, and rCTD was further purified using a Delta-Pak C18 column. The purified rCTD was lyophilized and analyzed on SDS-PAGE. Its identity was confirmed by mass spectrometry (McMaster Regional Center for Mass Spectrometry, McMaster University). Oligomerization State Determination of the rCTD—Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed on a Beckman Optima XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman-Coulter) at 22 °C. A cell with six channels of 12-mm optical path was used. The lyophilized rCTD was dissolved in water to a concentration of 10 mg/ml. The protein solutions of different concentrations (1, 2, and 3 mg/ml) at different pH values were prepared by adding KCl and corresponding buffers (pH 4–6, K+-citrate, pH 7, K+-phosphate/Tris-HCl, pH 8–9, Tris-HCl; the citrate and phosphate buffers were prepared by titrating citric acid and KH2PO4 against KOH to the desired pH values) to a final concentration of 227 mm KCl and 54 mm buffers. Sample channels were filled with 110 μl of protein solutions, and the reference channels were loaded with 120 μl of corresponding solutions without protein. All runs were performed at two speeds: 23,000 and 30,000 rpm. Absorption profiles at 280 nm of each centrifuged samples were collected after 17 and 19 h of centrifugation. The absorption profiles at the two time points were compared to ensure that equilibrium had been achieved. Absorption profiles were analyzed using the XL-A/XL-I data analysis software (Beckman Coulter). The partial specific volume of rCTD and the density of buffers were estimated with the program SEDNTERP (20Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Analytical Ultracentrifugation. The Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK1992Google Scholar). Overexpression, Purification, and Characterization of rKcsA and chKcsA—rKcsA was expressed in E. coli. and purified to homogeneity as analyzed on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2, A and C). KcsAΔCTD and rctKcsA were generated by limited chymotrypsin digestion as it was previously reported that KcsA can be cleaved specifically after residue 125 by chymotrypsin (21Molina M.L. Encinar J.A. Barrera F.N. Fernandez-Ballester G. Riquelme G. Gonzalez-Ros J.M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 14924-14931Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The activities of rKcsA and rctKcsA were confirmed by cell-attached patch clamp technique (Fig. 1, A–C). The pH profiles of rKcsA and rctKcsA were similar to that reported by Cortes et al. (14Cortes D.M. Cuello L.G. Perozo E. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117: 165-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) by Rb+ flux assay. Thermal Stability of Tetrameric rKcsA and KcsAΔCTD at Various pH Values—Tetrameric KcsA is stable even in the presence of harsh detergent such as SDS, and heating is required to dissociate it into monomer. Its thermal stability in SDS was used by Cortes et al. (14Cortes D.M. Cuello L.G. Perozo E. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117: 165-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 22Perozo E. Cortes D.M. Cuello L.G. Science. 1999; 285: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar) to determine the effect of various mutations (including CTD truncation) on the overall stability of the channel. It was reported that truncation of the CTD destabilized the channel. In addition, Rb+ flux assay was also used to characterize the CTD deletion mutants, and increased ion leakage at basic pH was observed. Cortes et al. (14Cortes D.M. Cuello L.G. Perozo E. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117: 165-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) concluded that the CTD stabilized the closed form of the channel. To have a better understanding of the molecular basis of this observed phenomenon and to settle a recent claim by Molina et al. (21Molina M.L. Encinar J.A. Barrera F.N. Fernandez-Ballester G. Riquelme G. Gonzalez-Ros J.M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 14924-14931Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) that truncation of the CTD did not destabilize KcsA tetramer, we extended the previous thermal stability studies carried out at a single pH to include a wide range of pH values. The tetramer-monomer dissociation temperature (Tm) for rKcsA was pH-dependent. At pH 5.0 or higher, it was about 80.0 °C and shifted dramatically to about 37.4 °C when pH was lowered to 4.0 (Fig. 2E). At pH 3.0, rKcsA existed mainly as monomer at all temperatures tested (data not shown). The pH-dependent Tm profile of KcsAΔCTD was quite different from its full-length counterpart. Tm of KcsAΔCTD was about 20.0 °C higher and 25.0 °C lower than rKcsA at pH 4.0 and 8.0, respectively. When pH was lowered to 3.0, KcsAΔCTD also existed as monomer. Oligomerization of rCTD at Various pH Values—The observed contradicting contribution of the CTD to the stability of tetrameric rKcsA at pH 4.0 and 8.0 can be related to its modulating role in the open-closed switching of the channel. rKcsA is destabilized in the pH range where the gate is opened and stabilized by its CTD in the pH range where the gate is closed. This hypothetical role of the CTD requires it to oligomerize in a pH-dependent manner. We therefore constructed a His-tagged recombinant fragment of the CTD (residues 116–160, rHCTD) and expressed it in E. coli. The expressed protein was purified to homogeneity as shown on 15% SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3). After removal of the His tag by thrombin digestion, the mass of the rCTD was determined by mass spectrometry to be 5,729.0 Da, which is close to the predicted value of 5,727.2 Da. We used sedimentation equilibrium to monitor the apparent molecular weight of the rCTD at various pH values, and the results are shown in Fig. 4. When we fit the data to a single species model, the apparent molecular masses of the rCTD at acidic pH values of 4, 5, and 6 were 5,049 ± 312, 5,551 ± 373, and 5,409 ± 298 Da (mean ± 95% confidence level generated by weighted function), respectively. These values were close to the expected mass of the rCTD in its monomeric form (5,727.2 Da). The apparent molecular mass of the sample increased to about 17,000 Da at neutral and basic pH values (Fig. 4C). It was more than three times the molecular mass of a monomer at acidic pH values (e.g. 3 × 5,409 Da). When the concentration of KCl was increased from 227 mm to 1.5 m, the apparent molecular mass increased and plateaued at 20,000 Da, which is close to that of a tetramer (Fig. 5). Since rKcsA exists as homotetramer in nature, its CTD is likely to form tetramer. When we fit the data to monomer-tetramer, monomer-dimer-tetramer, and monomer-trimer-tetramer models, all three models yielded similar Kd values for tetramer (3.0 × 10–12 m3). Since much higher Kd values for other oligomers (trimer, 1.2 × 104 m2, and dimer, 1.4 × 1012 m; data not shown) were obtained, the relative amount of these oligomers may be negligibly small.FIGURE 5Apparent molecular weight of rCTD determined by sedimentation equilibrium experiment at different concentration of KCl at pH 8.

Physiol. 2001; 117: 165-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) proposed that the CTD of KcsA may be involved in modulating the open-closed switching of the channel. Here, we examined this hypothesis by characterizing the biochemical and biophysical properties of the CTD. The primary structure of the CTD predicted that it is highly charged with a theoretical pI value around 10. About 44% of the CTD (22 out of 48 residues) are charged at neutral pH, with 12 positive and 10 negative residues, resulting in a theoretical net charge of about +2. Previous EPR studies showed close contacts among the CTDs at pH above neutral (14Cortes D.M. Cuello L.G. Perozo E. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117: 165-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) despite its theoretical net charge of +2, indicating the existence of substantial attraction among the CTDs. One can imagine when the environment was acidified such that the net charge in this region is further increased, a stronger repulsion force will override the attraction force and prevent the CTDs from staying together. This pH/charge-based repulsion among the CTDs may contribute to channel opening, whereas the attraction among the CTDs may contribute to the enhanced stability of the closed form as observed by Cortes et al. (14Cortes D.M. Cuello L.G. Perozo E. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117: 165-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). To test the hypothesis mentioned above, we measured the pH-dependent thermal stability of tetrameric KcsA and found that its denaturation profile was pH-dependent with close resemblance to the pH profile of its opening. The channel is more stable at neutral and basic pH values, where the gate of KcsA is mostly closed, than at acidic pH values, where the gate opens (15Heginbotham L. LeMasurier M. Kolmakova-Partensky L. Miller C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 551-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 23Irizarry S.N. Kutluay E. Drews G. Hart S.J. Heginbotham L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13653-13662Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This close correlation between the denaturation and opening pH profiles suggests that factors that affect the stability of KcsA tetramer may also have an influence on channel opening. We therefore investigated the role of the CTD in gating by comparing the thermal stability of rKcsA and that of KcsAΔCTD at various pH values. We found that the full-length channel is more stable than its CTD truncated counterpart at basic and neutral pH values, presumably due to the extra contacts among the CTDs. Interestingly, the full-length channel is less stable than the CTD truncated form at acidic pH when the channel is supposed to be in its open state. This is in agreement with the hypothesis that the principal molecular interactions responsible for stabilizing the KcsA tetramer are contained within the transmembrane domain and that the CTD is involved in modulating channel opening. If gate opening and closing are modulated by the dissociation and association of the CTD as our data suggest, then the interactions between the CTDs have to be strong enough to stabilize its own oligomerization independent of other parts of the channel. We examined the oligomeric state of rCTD at various pH values by sedimentation equilibrium to determine whether rCTD alone was sufficient to form oligomer in a pH-dependent manner. As expected, we found that rCTD formed oligomer (probably tetramer) at basic pH values and that no oligomer was detected at acidic pH values. Taken together, our data support the concept that interactions between the CTDs of rKcsA modulate gate opening and that the ionization state of residues within the CTD confers the pH dependence of this process. The transition pH for the oligomerization of rCTD is about 2 pH units higher than the reported value for channel opening (15Heginbotham L. LeMasurier M. Kolmakova-Partensky L. Miller C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 551-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 23Irizarry S.N. Kutluay E. Drews G. Hart S.J. Heginbotham L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13653-13662Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This discrepancy may be due to the extra force required to pull the transmembrane domain apart, and additional ionizable residues located at the CTD likely play a role in providing the required supplemental force. We set out to determine the residues involved in the observed pH-dependent thermal stability of rKcsA. The transition pH for gating (pH 5.2–6.5 (14Cortes D.M. Cuello L.G. Perozo E. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117: 165-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 15Heginbotham L. LeMasurier M. Kolmakova-Partensky L. Miller C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 551-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 23Irizarry S.N. Kutluay E. Drews G. Hart S.J. Heginbotham L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13653-13662Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar)) and oligomerization (pH 6.5) are close to the theoretical pKas of glutamic acid (4.25), aspartic acid (3.65), and histidine (6.00), which are abundant in the C-terminal domain (7 Glu, 3 Asp, 3 His). Among these three types of amino acids, the number of the histidines located in this region is the smallest, and its theoretical pKa is close to the pH transition point for channel opening. Thus, the histidine residues (His-124, His-128, and His-145) were chosen as targets for our mutation studies. Since removal of the last 20 residues from KcsA did not alter its pH profile of opening, whereas removal of the last 35 residues did (14Cortes D.M. Cuello L.G. Perozo E. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117: 165-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), we only mutated His-124 and His-128. No observable changes to the thermal stability of all mutants (H124A, H128A, and H124A-H128A; data not shown) were detected. The pH profiles of H124A in terms of gating as a full-length channel and oligomerization as an rCTD were also examined. Both profiles were the same as that of wild type (data not shown). These observations suggest that His-124 and His-128 are not the key residues in the pH sensor and that other ionizable residues in the CTD may be responsible for the observed pH-dependent thermal stability. Nevertheless, our data provide compelling evidence to support that the pH-dependent oligomerization of the C-terminal domain plays a significant role in modulating the gating of KcsA in a pH-dependent manner.

The subject's task was to manipulate this eye movement-yoked target cursor to perform either compensatory or pursuit eye tracking. The computer thereafter was programmed to store input eye-movement signals and read them out after a delay interval to control the yoked visual target cursor controlled by the eye movements. Delay time constants of 0.1 second significantly affected tracking. Eye movement-retinal feedback delays appeared to have an even more marked effect on positive pursuit eye tracking.
