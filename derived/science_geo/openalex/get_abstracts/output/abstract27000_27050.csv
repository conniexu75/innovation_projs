https://openalex.org/W2104018711,"An A to G transition mutation at nucleotide pair 8344 in human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has been identified as the cause of MERRF. The mutation alters the TψC loop of the tRNALys gene and creates a CviJI restriction site, providing a simple molecular diagnostic test for the disease. This mutation was present in three independent MERRF pedigrees and absent in 75 controls, altered a conserved nucleotide, and was heteroplasmic. All MERRF patients and their less-affected maternal relatives had between 2% and 27% wild-type mtDNAs and showed an age-related association between genotype and phenotype. This suggests that a small percentage of normal mtDNAs has a large protective effect on phenotype. This mutation provides molecular confirmation that some forms of epilepsy are the result of deficiencies in mitochondrial energy production."
https://openalex.org/W2038012168,"The amyloid beta peptide (A beta P) is a small fragment of the much larger, broadly distributed amyloid precursor protein (APP). Abundant A beta P deposition in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease suggests that altered APP processing may represent a key pathogenic event. Direct protein structural analyses showed that constitutive processing in human embryonic kidney 293 cells cleaves APP in the interior of the A beta P, thus preventing A beta P deposition. A deficiency of this processing event may ultimately prove to be the etiological event in Alzheimer's disease that gives rise to senile plaque formation."
https://openalex.org/W2063272219,"An amyloid protein that precipitates in the cerebral vessel walls of Dutch patients with hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis is similar to the amyloid protein in vessel walls and senile plaques in brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease, Down syndrome, and sporadic cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Cloning and sequencing of the two exons that encode the amyloid protein from two patients with this amyloidosis revealed a cytosine-to-guanine transversion, a mutation that caused a single amino acid substitution (glutamine instead of glutamic acid) at position 22 of the amyloid protein. The mutation may account for the deposition of this amyloid protein in the cerebral vessel walls of these patients, leading to cerebral hemorrhages and premature death."
https://openalex.org/W2010315866,"Major histocompatibility class I proteins display viral and self antigens to potentially responsive cells and are important for the maturation of T cells; beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2M) is required for their normal expression. Mouse chimeras derived from embryonic stem cells with a disrupted beta 2M gene transmitted the inactivated gene to their progeny. Animals homozygous for the mutated beta 2M gene were obtained at expected frequencies after further breeding. The homozygotes appeared normal, although no class I antigens could be detected on their cells and the animals are grossly deficient in CD4- CD8+ T cells, which normally mediate cytotoxic T cell function."
https://openalex.org/W2069350944,"An active site, cofactor-containing peptide has been obtained in high yield from bovine serum amine oxidase. Sequencing of this pentapeptide indicates: Leu-Asn-X-Asp-Tyr. Analysis of the peptide by mass spectrometry, ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, and proton nuclear magnetic resonance leads to the identification of X as 6-hydroxydopa. This result indicates that, contrary to previous proposals, pyrroloquinoline quinone is not the active site cofactor in mammalian copper amine oxidases. Although 6-hydroxydopa has been implicated in neurotoxicity, the data presented suggest that this compound has a functional role at an enzyme active site."
https://openalex.org/W1986828137,"Three new and likely related components of the cellular fusion machinery have been purified from bovine brain cytosol, termed alpha-SNAP (35 kd), beta-SNAP (36 kd), and gamma-SNAP (39 kd). Transport between cisternae of the Golgi complex measured in vitro requires SNAP activity during the membrane fusion stage, and each SNAP is capable of binding the general cellular fusion protein NSF to Golgi membranes. The SNAP-NSF-membrane complex may be an early stage in the assembly of a proposed multisubunit ""fusion machine"" on the target membrane. SNAP transport factor activity is also found in yeast. Yeast cytosol prepared from a secretion mutant defective in export from the endoplasmic reticulum (sec17) lacks SNAP activity, which can be restored in vitro by the addition of pure alpha-SNAP, but not beta- or gamma-SNAPs. These data suggest that the mechanism of action of SNAPs in membrane fusion is conserved in evolution."
https://openalex.org/W1975146102,"Lighting cycles synchronize (entrain) mammalian circadian rhythms by altering activity of cells in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus, a circadian pacemaker. Exposure of hamsters and rats to light pulses at those phases of the circadian rhythm during which light can shift the rhythm caused increased immunoreactivity for the product of the immediate-early gene c-fos in cells in the region of the SCN that receives retinal fibers. Light pulses also increased messenger RNA for the Fos protein and for the immediate-early protein NGFI-A in the rat SCN. Similar increases in mRNA for NGFI-A were seen in the SCN of hamsters. Thus cells in this portion of the SCN undergo alterations in gene expression in response to retinal illumination, but only at times in the circadian cycle when light is capable of influencing entrainment."

https://openalex.org/W2077925351,"An inhibitor of coagulation factor XIa was purified from serum-free conditioned medium of HepG2 liver cells. Platelets stimulated with thrombin or calcium ionophore (A23187) secrete a protein functionally and immunologically identical to the inhibitor, implying a role for this inhibitor in hemostasis. Analysis of the amino-terminal amino acid sequence and immunologic reactivity showed the inhibitor to be a truncated form of the Alzheimer's amyloid precursor protein that contains a Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitor domain and at least a portion of the amyloid β protein. It inhibits factor XIa and trypsin with a Ki of 450 ± 50 pM and 20 ± 10 pM, respectively. Heparin (1 unit/ml) did not significantly effect inhibition of trypsin, but inhibition of XIa was 15 times greater (Ki = 25 ± 15 pM) in the presence of heparin."
https://openalex.org/W1656440259,"A novel regulatory protein for the rho proteins (rhoA p21 and rhoB p20), belonging to a ras p21/ras p21-like small molecular weight (Mr) GTP-binding protein (G protein) superfamily, was purified to near homogeneity from bovine brain cytosol and characterized. This regulatory protein, designated here as GDP dissociation inhibitor (GDI) for the rho proteins (rho GDI), inhibited the dissociation of GDP from rhoB p20 and the binding of guanosine 5'-(3-O-thio)triphosphate (GTP gamma S) to the GDP-bound form of rhoB p20 but not of that to the guanine nucleotide-free form. The Mr value of rho GDI was estimated to be about 27,000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and from the S value, indicating that rho GDI is composed of a single polypeptide without a subunit structure. The isoelectric point was about pH 5.7. rho GDI made a complex with the GDP-bound form of rhoB p20 with a molar ratio of 1:1 but not with the GTP gamma S-bound or guanine nucleotide-free form. rho GDI did not stimulate the GTPase activity of rhoB p20 and by itself showed neither GTP gamma S-binding nor GTPase activity. rho GDI was equally active for rhoA p21 and rhoB p20 but was inactive for other ras p21/ras p21-like G proteins including c-Ha-ras p21, smg p25A, and smg p21. rho GDI activity was detected in the cytosol fraction of various rat tissues. These results indicate that, in mammalian tissues, there is a novel type of regulatory protein specific for the rho proteins that interacts with the GDP-bound form of the rho proteins and thereby regulates the GDP/GTP exchange reaction of the rho proteins by inhibiting the dissociation of GDP from and the subsequent binding of GTP to them. Since there is a GTPase-activating protein for the rho proteins stimulating the GTPase activity of the rho proteins in mammalian tissues, the rho proteins appear to be regulated at least by GTPase-activating protein and GDI in a dual manner."
https://openalex.org/W2095005214,"An ongoing controversy concerns the cellular distribution of the differentially spliced forms of the amyloid protein precursor (APP) mRNAs and changes in prevalence of these transcripts during Alzheimer's disease. In situ hybridization on serial sections was used to prove that most hippocampal pyramidal neurons contain both APP-751 and APP-695 mRNA species. The APP-751/APP-695 mRNA ratio is generally increased during Alzheimer's disease, as shown by RNA gel blot analysis. Moreover, there was a strong linear relation between the increase in APP-751/APP-695 mRNA ratio in pyramidal neurons and the density of senile plaques within the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. Thus, the increase in APP-751/APP-695 mRNA provides a molecular marker for regional variations in plaque density between individuals diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease by the commonly used composite criteria."
https://openalex.org/W2001597380,"Metabolic instability is characteristic of regulatory proteins whose in vivo concentrations must vary as a function of time. The cell type-specific alpha 2 repressor of the yeast S. cerevisiae is shown here to have a half-life of only approximately 5 min. Each of the two structural domains of alpha 2 carries a sequence that can independently target a normally long-lived protein for rapid destruction. Moreover, these two degradation signals are shown to operate via distinct mechanisms. Mutants deficient in the degradation of alpha 2 have been isolated and found to have a number of additional defects, indicating that the pathways responsible for alpha 2 turnover include components with multiple functions. Finally, we demonstrate that a short-lived subunit of an oligomeric protein can be degraded in vivo without destabilizing other, long-lived subunits of the same protein. This subunit-specific degradation makes possible a novel type of posttranslational remodeling in which a heteromeric protein could be functionally modified by selective, degradation-mediated replacement of its subunits."
https://openalex.org/W2038752962,"Stocks of D. melanogaster X chromosomes carrying terminal deletions (RT chromosomes) have been maintained for several years. Some of the chromosomes are slowly losing DNA from the broken ends (as expected if replication is incomplete) and show no telomere-associated DNA added to the receding ends. Two stocks carry chromosomes that have become ""healed"" and are no longer losing DNA. In both stocks the broken chromosome end has acquired a segment of HeT DNA, a family of complex repeats found only at telomeres and in pericentric heterochromatin. Although the HeT family is complex, the HeT sequence joined to the broken chromosome end is the same in both stocks. In contrast, the two chromosomes are broken in different places and have no detectable sequence similarity at the junction with the new DNA. Sequence analysis suggests that the new telomere sequences have been added by a specific mechanism that does not involve homologous recombination."
https://openalex.org/W1998871307,"Expression and DNA methylation of the transgene locus TKZ751 are controlled by genotype-specific modifier genes. The DBA/2 and 129 genetic backgrounds enhanced expression, while the BALB/c background suppressed expression, but only following maternal inheritance of the BALB/c modifier. Epigenetic modification of the transgene locus was cumulative over successive generations, which in BALB/c mice resulted in an irreversible methylation after three consecutive germline passages. Therefore, at the TKZ751 locus the germline fails to reverse previously acquired epigenetic modifications, a process that is usually essential to restore the genomic totipotency. Hence the genotype-specific modifier genes regulate penetrance and expressivity as well as parental imprinting of the TKZ751 locus through epigenetic modification."

https://openalex.org/W1555809258,"The recent availability (Hunter, S.W., Gaylord, H., and Brennan, P.J. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 12345-12351) of the well known arabinomannan of Mycobacterium leprae and Mycobacterium tuberculosis as the pure native lipoarabinomannan has resulted in its implication in key aspects of the immunopathogenesis of leprosy and tuberculosis. We had indicated that the lipid moiety of lipoarabinomannan is probably based on a diacylglycerol unit in that glycerol and the two fatty acids, hexadecanoate and 10-methyloctadecanoate, were identified. In addition, lipoarabinomannan was also shown to contain myo-inositol 1-phosphate. Evidence is now presented, based on selective radiolabeling and analysis of various cleavage fragments, that the inositol phosphate exists as both an alkalilable phosphodiester and as part of a phosphatidylinositol membrane anchor. The mannan of M. tuberculosis was also isolated as the native lipomannan. It also apparently contains a phosphatidylinositol unit but is devoid of the alkali-labile inositol phosphate residues. These lipopolysaccharides are apparently multiglycosylated versions of the well known myocobacterial mannosyl phosphatidylinositols and are prokaryotic versions of the growing list of phosphatidylinositol-anchored macromolecules. Immunogold labeling demonstrates that lipoarabinomannan is a true antigenic capsular or extracellular product of M. tuberculosis. The presence of a phosphatidylinositol residue on lipoarabinomannan may explain its interaction with macrophage membranes and role in mycobacterial pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2059485002,"Recent evidence suggests the involvement of phosphatidylcholine (PC) hydrolysis both in the control of normal cell growth and in transformation. We show here that the simple exogenous addition of Bacillus cereus PC-hydrolyzing phospholipase C (PC-PLC) is sufficient to elicit a potent mitogenic response in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts by a mechanism that is independent of protein kinase C. Our results on the additivity and synergism between B. cereus PC-PLC, PDGF, and insulin in the mitogenic response indicate that this novel phospholipid degradative pathway may be important in the mitogenic signaling cascade activated by PDGF."
https://openalex.org/W1598276635,"Photoreactivating enzyme, which specifically monomerizes pyrimidine dimers in UV-irradiated DNA, was purified 21,000-fold from the cyanobacterium Anacystis nidulans to apparent homogeneity with 41% overall yield. The enzyme consists of a single protein chain with 53,000 molecular weight. Maximal activity was found at pH 6.2 and 0.1 M NaCl. Purified photoreactivating enzyme exhibits a marked absorption spectrum with a main band in the blue region (maximum 437 nm), a protein band (maximum 266 nm), and a low intensity band above 500 nm. The molar extinction coefficient of native enzyme was estimated 53,000 at 437 nm. The action spectrum for photoreactivation shows maximal activity at 440 nm and correlates closely with the 437-nm absorption band. The enzyme contains two different intrinsic chromophores in equimolar amounts, which were identified as 7,8-didemethyl-8-hydroxy-5-deazariboflavin (FO) and (reduced) FAD. The low intensity absorption band of native photoreactivating enzyme exhibits a shoulder at 498 and maxima at 588 and 634 nm. This band is attributed to a neutral FAD semiquinone radical which accounts for the major part of the FAD present in dark equilibrated enzyme. Preillumination at 585 nm bleaches the semiquinone spectrum due to formation of fully reduced FAD, but exposure to air in the dark restores the spectrum completely. On preillumination at 437 nm the disappearance of FAD semiquinone is more rapid, indicating that the photoreduction is sensitized by the 8-hydroxy-5-deazaflavin chromophore. The 8-hydroxy-5-deazaflavin and possibly also the reduced FAD chromophore appear to act as a primary photon acceptor in the photoreactivation process."

https://openalex.org/W2005740894,"Three strategies for genetic analysis show that two inner membrane components of the export machinery, PrlA (SecY) and PrlG (SecE), interact directly while catalyzing the translocation of secreted proteins across the cytoplasmic membrane of E. coli. The first, suppressor-directed inactivation (SDI), exploits the specific interaction between dominant prl suppressors of signal sequence mutations and mutant LacZ hybrid proteins. The second, Sec titration, extends SDI to allow the identification of various Sec proteins that are present in the translocation complex. The third uses the synthetic lethality of certain double-mutant strains to infer physical interactions between gene products. Biochemical data obtained with SDI strains allow the identification of two different secretory intermediates and indicate that PrlG functions before PrlA in the secretion pathway."

https://openalex.org/W1595735296,"Synapsin I is a peripheral membrane protein of synaptic vesicles that mediates their attachment to the cytoskeleton. Human genomic clones containing the full coding sequence of synapsin I were isolated, and the exons were mapped and sequenced. Human synapsin I is encoded by a single copy gene containing 13 exons ranging in size from 58 base pairs to more than 1 kilobase that are unequally distributed over more than 30 kilobases of DNA on the X-chromosome. The differential splicing of the primary synapsin I transcript that generates synapsins Ia and Ib involves alternative use of splice acceptor sites at the last intron-exon boundary. The primary structure of synapsin I is highly conserved between the human, rat, and bovine proteins (95% identity). The intron placement within that primary structure correlates with the previously postulated domain model of the protein. Exon I contains domains A and B, while exon 12 contains almost all of domain D, and exon 13 contains the alternatively spliced domains E and F. Domain C, the central homologous domain implicated in the binding of synapsin I to actin and to synaptic vesicles, is divided into nine exons."
https://openalex.org/W1573915513,"In the course of an electrophoretic mutation screening program of 32,000 dried blood samples from newborns, 17 genetic variants of apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) were found and structurally analyzed. The following defects were identified by the combined use of high performance liquid chromatography, time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry, and sequence analysis: Pro3----Arg (1 x), Pro4----Arg (1 x), Asp89----Glu (1 x), Lys107----0 (4 x), Lys107----Met (2 x), Glu139----Gly (2 x), Glu147----Val (1 x), Pro165----Arg (4 x), and Glu198----Lys (1 x). The distribution of point mutations in the apoA-I gene leading to these 9 and 11 other variants of apoA-I reported previously was statistically analyzed. Substitutions are overrepresented in the 10 amino-terminal amino acids (p less than 0.001, chi 2-test) and in residues 103-177 (p less than 0.025, chi 2-test) or residues 103-198 (p less than 0.05, chi 2-test), respectively. We further noted the following. (i) Prolines were substituted by arginine or histidine residues at a frequency much higher than expected on the basis of random nucleotide substitutions (5 out of 18 non-neutral amino acid substitutions, p less than 0.001, chi 2-test). These substitutions are the result of transversions of cytosines contained within stretches of at least 5 consecutive cytosines in the apoA-I gene. The observed hypervariability of the apoA-I amino terminus, therefore, might be caused by a hot spot for mutation formed by the 7 subsequent cytosines in codons 3, 4, and 5. (ii) CpG dinucleotides were overrepresentatively affected by C----T transitions (5 out of 18 electrically nonneutral amino acid substitution, p less than 0.001, chi 2-test). The hypervariability of the apoA-I alpha-helical domain might therefore be caused by CpG dinucleotides predominantly occurring in codons 120-208 of apoA-I (82 out of 125). (iii) Comparison of mutation sites in the human apoA-I gene with sites of nonsynonymous substitutions revealed that amino acid substitutions found in human apoA-I were predominantly localized in areas that were little conserved during mammalian evolution. These regions may therefore represent areas of less structural constraint for the function of apoA-I."

https://openalex.org/W1521585242,"Synaptophysin, a major membrane protein of synaptic vesicles, contains four transmembrane regions and two intravesicular loops. Synaptophysin monomers associate into homopolymers that have the potential to form channels in the synaptic vesicle membrane. Here we show that in native synaptophysin, homopolymers are linked by noncovalent forces. The molecule contains unstable intramolecular disulfide bonds that undergo disulfide exchange during solubilization, thereby covalently cross-linking neighboring synaptophysin molecules. The locations of the intramolecular disulfide bonds in synaptophysin were determined, revealing that each of the two intravesicular loops of synaptophysin is circularized by a single disulfide bond. Cross-linking of synaptophysin by disulfide bonds can be triggered in synaptic vesicles and in intact cells by a cycle of reduction and oxidation, suggesting that native synaptophysin is a homomultimer in situ. In addition, chemical cross-linking of native synaptophysin demonstrates that a low molecular weight protein is specifically associated with synaptophysin complexes and is lost upon reduction of the intramolecular disulfide bonds. These data suggest that native synaptophysin forms a noncovalent homomultimeric complex whose structure and interaction with other proteins are dependent on the integrity of its intramolecular disulfide bonds and phospholipid environment."
https://openalex.org/W1544017354,"Vitamin A nutritional status has been implicated as important in maintaining the integrity of immune functions. We have determined the effect of vitamin A (retinol) depletion on the ability of young animals to produce antibodies after challenge with various bacterial antigens. Male Lewis rats raised on vitamin A-free or adequate diets were immunized either near 40 days of age, before signs of vitamin A deficiency were apparent, or near 47 days of age when symptoms of deficiency were beginning to be manifest. For rats immunized with polysaccharide antigens from Streptococcus pneumoniae or Neisseria meningitidis, antibody production did not exceed 0-19% of the response of control rats. Vitamin A depletion also severely compromised the response to two T cell-dependent antigens, tetanus toxoid and sheep red blood cells. In striking contrast, retinol-depleted rats immunized with lipopolysaccharides from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcesens produced an antibody response indistinguishable from retinol-sufficient animals. These lipopolysaccharides could elicit antibodies in rat pups, whereas the capsular polysaccharide antigens could not. This is consistent with the characteristics of type 1 and type 2 antigens, respectively. These studies indicate that retinol status is an important determinant of the humoral immune response to certain types of antigen and suggest that antibody production to capsular polysaccharides and T cell-dependent antigens is particularly dependent on adequate retinol status."
https://openalex.org/W2134197157,"We studied c-fos gene expression in rat fibroblasts by microinjection of regulatory DNA sequences, such as the serum response element (SRE) present in c-fos promotor, in order to compete directly with such sequences for binding of putative regulatory factors. We show that an additional fos intragenic regulatory element (FIRE) is located at the end of exon 1. When coinjected with an SRE oligonucleotide, it induced c-fos expression in quiescent cells, whereas injection of SRE sequence alone failed to do so. Moreover, injection in quiescent cells of an SRE oligonucleotide together with a p-fos-lacZ construct containing the c-fos SRE as well as an in-frame insertion of FIRE resulted in a block to beta-galactosidase expression that can be relieved by coinjection of the FIRE sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1494370604,"The 23.5-kDa Sec4 protein is required for vesicular transport between the Golgi apparatus and the plasma membrane in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In order to analyze its biochemical properties, we have purified the soluble pool of the wild-type protein from an overproducing yeast strain. At 30 degrees C, Sec4p bound [35S] guanosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S) with a rate of 0.18 min-1 in a reaction requiring micromolar concentration of free magnesium ions. The protein had high affinity for guanine nucleotides with Kd values for GTP gamma S and GTP of 3.7 nM and 3.5 nM, respectively, and that for GDP of 77 nM. The dissociation of [3H] GDP from Sec4p occurred with a rate of 0.21 min-1 suggesting that the association of GTP gamma S was the result of exchange for prebound GDP. The release of GTP from Sec4p was slow and correlated with a low inherent GTPase activity of 0.0012 min-1. By analogy with other classes of GTP binding proteins, both the nucleotide exchange and hydrolysis activities of Sec4p may be modulated in vivo to facilitate its role in the regulation of intercompartmental membrane traffic."

https://openalex.org/W1572740209,"An iodinated analog of the sulfonylurea, glyburide, has been synthesized which can be labeled to high specific activity and used to photolabel the sulfonylurea receptor. 5-Iodo-2-hydroxy-glyburide, has an iodo group replacing the chlorine at position 5 and a methoxy residue replacing the hydroxy group at position 2 on the benzamido ring. This analog retains biologic activity stimulating insulin secretion from a hamster beta cell line (HIT cells) at the same ED50 (0.4 nM) as glyburide. Scatchard analysis demonstrated high and low affinity binding sites on HIT cell membranes (Kd values of 0.36 nM and 277 nM and Bmax values of 1.6 and 100 pmol/mg of membrane protein, respectively). Competitive binding assays with unlabeled glyburide or 5-iodo-2-hydroxyglyburide yield Ki values of 0.5 and 1.0 nM, respectively. The analog can be covalently linked by ultraviolet irradiation to a membrane protein of Mr = 140,000. The photolabeling is completely blocked by unlabeled glyburide or the analog. Two other species of Mr = 65,000 and 43,000 are also photolabeled; these may be the low affinity sites. After photolabeling, the receptor has been purified partially by chromatographic procedures and is suitable for obtaining peptide sequence. The 140,000 molecular weight protein is identified as the sulfonylurea receptor since its binding constant, 0.36 nM, is closely correlated with its ability to stimulate insulin secretion (ED50 congruent to 0.4 nM)."
https://openalex.org/W1983594803,The NH2-terminal locations of a dimer containing the DNA binding domain of the yeast transcriptional activator GCN4 have been mapped on the binding sites 5'-CTGACTAAT-3' and 5'-ATGACTCTT-3'. Affinity cleaving was effected by synthetic GCN4 proteins with Fe.EDTA moieties at the NH2-terminus. Analysis of the DNA cleavage patterns for dimers of the Fe.EDTA-proteins corresponding to GCN4 residues 222 to 281 and 226 to 281 revealed that the NH2-termini were in the major groove nine to ten base pairs apart and were symmetrically displaced four to five base pairs from the central C of the recognition site. This result is consistent with the Y-shaped scissor grip-leucine zipper model recently proposed for a class of DNA binding proteins important in the regulation of gene expression.
https://openalex.org/W1513060264,"Sphingolipid biosynthesis was studied in cultured murine cerebellar cells in the absence and presence of exogenous sphingosine homologues with different alkyl chain lengths (12, 18, and 24 carbon atoms). Labeling of cells with [14C]serine for 24 h indicated that endogenous sphingosine biosynthesis with incorporation of radiolabeled serine was inhibited by these long chain bases (0.5-50 microM) in a concentration-dependent manner; the inhibition was fully reversible after removal of the long chain bases from the culture medium. Metabolic labeling of neurons with [14C]galactose provided strong evidence that the cells were able to use the exogenous sphingosine homologues, irrespective of their alkyl chain length, as substrates for the biosynthesis of glycosphingolipids. When the biosynthetically inert sphingoid, azidosphingosine (5-50 microM), was fed to the cells, de novo sphingosine and glycosphingolipid biosynthesis were both strongly inhibited."
https://openalex.org/W1575038201,"Cell surfaces of metastatic 13762 ascites rat mammary adenocarcinoma cells are covered with a sialomucin complex composed of the high Mr sialomucin ASGP-1 (approximately 600,000) and a concanavalin A-binding, integral membrane glycoprotein ASGP-2 (120,000). Antibodies prepared against ASGP-2 and deglycosylated ASGP-1 react on immunoblots of ascites cells or their isolated microvilli with the Mr = 120,000 species and the high Mr sialomucin, respectively. No cross-reactivity was observed. Under complex dissociating conditions, anti-ASGP-2 immunoprecipitated primarily components of Mr = 120,000 and about 400,000 from lysates of cells labeled for 1 h with mannose, glucosamine, and threonine. Under similar conditions, anti-ASGP-1 immunoprecipitated the Mr = 400,000 component and a second major labeled component of about 330,000. Pulse-chase labeling with 35S-labeled amino acids followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-ASGP-2 indicated a precursor-product relationship for the Mr = 400,000 component, designated pSMC-1 (precursor, sialomucin complex), and ASGP-2. Similar pulse-chase analyses of threonine-labeled cells using anti-ASGP-1 showed equivalent amounts of immunoprecipitated pSMC-1 and pSMC-2, both of which disappeared with kinetics similar to those observed for pSMC-1 immunoprecipitated with anti-ASGP-2. A precursor-product relationship of both pSMC-1 and pSMC-2 to ASGP-1 was suggested by combined precipitations with anti-ASGP-1 and peanut agglutinin, which precipitates ASGP-1 specifically. Immunoblot and lectin blot analyses indicated that pSMC-1 and pSMC-2 from the immunoprecipitates bind anti-ASGP-2, anti-ASGP-1, and concanavalin A. Moreover, these three components can also be labeled with mannose; the mannose was removed from 30-min pulse-labeled anti-ASGP-2 immunoprecipitates by incubation with endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H, indicating the presence of only high mannose N-linked oligosaccharides in pSMC-1. One-dimensional peptide maps of 35S-labeled pSMC-1 and Mr = 120,000 ASGP-2 showed several corresponding bands. These results indicate that both ASGP-1 and ASGP-2 can be synthesized from a common high Mr precursor. We propose that complex is formed from pSMC-1 by proteolytic cleavage to yield Mr = 120,000 ASGP-2 plus the precursor to ASGP-1 early in the transit pathway from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cell surface."
https://openalex.org/W1602413288,"Previous investigators have shown that exotoxin A undergoes a conformational switch to a hydrophobic state at low pH. This change appears to play a role in exotoxin A entry into cells by facilitating its penetration of the membranes of acidic organelles. We have examined the effects of pH, temperature, and denaturants in order to define the role of conformational changes in membrane penetration by the exotoxin. We find that two distinct low pH conformations exist. An intermediate low pH state (LI) dominates at pH 3.7-5.4 and is distinguished by blue-shifted fluorescence and weak or no hydrophobicity. The second low pH state (LII) is dominant below pH 3.7 and is characterized by red shifted fluorescence and strong hydrophobicity. LI is a folded state as judged by its spectroscopic properties and the observation that it undergoes distinct and cooperative thermal and denaturant induced unfolding transitions. LII appears to be more like a denatured state, as it shows no cooperative thermal or denaturant induced transitions and has spectroscopic properties very similar to exotoxin A that has been thermally denatured at pH 7. Exotoxin A in the LII state strongly binds detergent micelles and binds and inserts into model membranes. Therefore, denaturation-like conformational changes appear to play an important role in membrane insertion. The pH of the transition to a membrane-inserting state is influenced by the composition of the model membranes and is close to pH 5 in the presence of vesicles containing a phosphatidylglycerol/phosphatidylcholine mixture. These vesicles probably promote formation of the LII state via mass action effects. The implication of these results for membrane penetration and translocation of proteins without apparent hydrophobic regions, such as exotoxin A, is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2019898272,"The viral protein p6, required for the protein-primed initiation of replication of Bacillus subtilis phage phi 29, forms a nucleoprotein complex at the viral replication origins that shows novel features. Deoxyribonuclease I and hydroxyl radical footprinting data, as well as the induction of positive supercoiling, support a model in which a DNA right-handed superhelix tightly wraps around a multimeric p6 core. The interaction occurs through the DNA minor groove. The activity of p6 not only requires the formation of the complex but also its correct positioning, indicating that the other proteins involved in the initiation of replication recognize, at a precise position, either the p6 core or the DNA conformational change induced by p6."
https://openalex.org/W1493509832,"Intra-alveolar fibrin deposition is one of the pathological hallmarks of acute lung injury. Because alveolar epithelial cells play a central role in the repair process following acute lung injury, this study was undertaken to examine their potential to produce a plasminogen activator (PA). We now report the synthesis and secretion of PA by rat alveolar epithelial cells with the catalytic properties of a urokinase-type (u-PA) rather than tissue-type plasminogen activator. Studies of regulation of epithelial cell u-PA revealed: 1) phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) but not the inactive structural analog 4 alpha-PMA upregulated u-PA synthesis, putatively via the protein kinase C pathway; 2) PMA induction of u-PA activity was substantially inhibited by dexamethasone and completely inhibited by cycloheximide; 3) unstimulated alveolar epithelial cells had no detectable u-PA mRNA, whereas PMA exposure led to activation of the u-PA gene and accumulation of a 2.5-kilobase u-PA mRNA; and 4) cycloheximide did not abolish this induction of u-PA mRNA suggesting that intermediate protein synthesis was not necessary for the activation of transcription. In light of their capacity to promote fibrinolysis and their strategic anatomic location, alveolar epithelial cells are likely to play a key role in the extensive remodelling process that follows acute lung injury."
https://openalex.org/W1584178108,"At different concentrations, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) can either stimulate or inhibit cAMP formation in freshly isolated rabbit cortical collecting tubule (RCCT) cells, but in cultured RCCT cells PGE2 can only stimulate cAMP synthesis (Sonnenburg, W. K., and Smith W. L. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 6155-6160). Here, we report characteristics of [3H]PGE2 binding to membrane receptor preparations from both freshly isolated and cultured RCCT cells. [3H]PGE2 binding to membranes from freshly isolated RCCT cells was saturable and partially reversible. Equilibrium binding analyses indicated that in the absence of guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate (GTP gamma S) there is a single class of PGE2 binding sites (KD = 4.2 +/- 0.4 nM; Bmax = 583 +/- 28 fmol/mg); in the presence of 100 microM GTP gamma S, there is also only one class of binding sites but with a somewhat lower KD = 1.2 +/- 0.5 nM (Bmax = 370 +/- 40 fmol/mg). This stimulatory effect of GTP gamma S was blocked by pretreatment of the freshly isolated RCCT cells with pertussis toxin. The relative affinities of prostanoids for the [3H]PGE2-binding site were determined to be 17,18,19,20-tetranor-16-phenoxy-PGE2-methylsulfonylamide (sulprostone) approximately PGE2 approximately PGE1 approximately 16,16-dimethyl-PGE2 greater than carbacyclin approximately PGF2 alpha greater than PGD2. This is the order of potency with which prostaglandins inhibit arginine vasopressin-induced cAMP formation in fresh RCCT cells. Interestingly, [3H]PGE2 binding to membranes from cultured cells, which, unlike fresh cells, fail to show an inhibitory response to PGE2, was only 10-20% of that observed with membranes from fresh cells; moreover, binding of [3H]PGE2 to membranes from cultured cells was neither stimulated by GTP gamma S nor inhibited by sulprostone. The prostanoid binding specificities and the unusual pertussis toxin-sensitive, stimulatory effect of GTP gamma S on binding of [3H]PGE2 to membranes from freshly isolated RCCT cells are characteristics shared by a Gi-linked PGE receptor from renal medulla (Watanabe, T., Umegaki, K., and Smith, W. L. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 14340-14349). Our results suggest that the [3H]PGE2 binding site of freshly isolated RCCT cells is the PGE receptor which is coupled to a Gi to attenuate arginine vasopressin-induced cAMP synthesis in the renal collecting tubule."
https://openalex.org/W1539822781,"Adenine nucleotide transport over the carboxyatractyloside-insensitive ATP-Mg/Pi carrier was assayed in isolated rat liver mitochondria with the aim of investigating a possible regulatory role for Ca2+ on carrier activity. Net changes in the matrix adenine nucleotide content (ATP + ADP + AMP) occur when ATP-Mg exchanges for Pi over this carrier. The rates of net accumulation and net loss of adenine nucleotides were inhibited when free Ca2+ was chelated with EGTA and stimulated when buffered [Ca2+]free was increased from 1.0 to 4.0 microM. The unidirectional components of net change were similarly dependent on Ca2+; ATP influx and efflux were inhibited by EGTA in a concentration-dependent manner and stimulated by buffered free Ca2+ in the range 0.6-2.0 microM. For ATP influx, increasing the medium [Ca2+]free from 1.0 to 2.0 microM lowered the apparent Km for ATP from 4.44 to 2.44 mM with no effect on the apparent Vmax (3.55 and 3.76 nmol/min/mg with 1.0 and 2.0 microM [Ca2+]free, respectively). Stimulation of influx and efflux by [Ca2+]free was unaffected by either ruthenium red or the Ca2+ ionophore A23187. Calmodulin antagonists inhibited transport activity. In isolated hepatocytes, glucagon or vasopressin promoted an increased mitochondrial adenine nucleotide content. The effect of both hormones was blocked by EGTA, and for vasopressin, the effect was blocked also by neomycin. The results suggest that the increase in mitochondrial adenine nucleotide content that follows hormonal stimulation of hepatocytes is mediated by an increase in cytosolic [Ca2+]free that activates the ATP-Mg/Pi carrier."
https://openalex.org/W2065071837,"When immunoglobulin-expressing B cells are fused with fibroblasts, immunoglobulin expression is rapidly and selectively suppressed. here we demonstrate that the conserved octamer motif of a kappa light chain gene promoter plays a crucial role in mediating this ""extinction"" phenomenon. Replacement of this octamer site by an Sp1 or NF1 binding site is sufficient to bypass extinction. Furthermore, in early cell hybrids, immunoglobulin suppression is correlated with absence of the cell-specific transcription factor Oct-2 and its transcripts. Such hybrids cannot support transcription of a transiently introduced reporter plasmid, driven by an octamer-containing promoter, unless an expression vector encoding Oct-2 is cotransfected. Transfection of the same Oct-2 expression vector into hybrid cells is also sufficient to ""reactivate"" an integrated kappa promoter construct. Thus, our data further establish the role of Oct-2 for immunoglobulin transcription and show that in B cell x fibroblast hybrids, the lack of a necessary cell-specific transcription factor is involved in the extinction of immunoglobulin expression."
https://openalex.org/W2047837757,"The rab genes code for small GTP binding proteins that share with p21ras the ability to bind and hydrolyze GTP. They present significant sequence homologies with the products of YPT1 and SEC4, two small GTP binding proteins involved in the regulation of secretion in the yeast. Several rab genes are expressed in the developing and adult mouse brain. To test directly the possible involvement of these genes in neuronal differentiation, purified rab proteins produced in E. coli were introduced into neurons dissociated from E15 rat midbrain. The most striking effects were obtained with rab2 protein (rab2p). Compared with untreated cells, neurons loaded with rab2p presented an enhanced adhesion to the culture substratum. This phenomenon was visible 3 hr after seeding and was followed within 24 hr by a dramatic increase in neurite growth. Loading the same population of neurons with the products of four other rab genes either decreased neuronal adhesion and neurite growth or had no effect. These experiments suggest that the expression of rab2p plays an important role in neuronal differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1602902941,"A system for the delayed or pulsed release of biologically active substances was achieved by encapsulating liposomes containing the substance of interest inside microcapsules. The microcapsules retain the liposomes but allow controlled diffusion of the active substance when it is released from the liposomes. Furthermore, by coating the liposomes with phospholipase A2 (an enzyme that removes an acyl group from the 2 position of phospholipids) before placing them within the microcapsule, a pulsatile release pattern was achieved both in vitro and in vivo. The time of onset of the pulse as well as the release rate can be controlled by the amount of phospholipase A2, the molecular weight of the poly(l-lysine) that is used to coat the microencapsulated liposomes, and the composition of the phospholipid bilayer membrane. Even at 37°C the system would protect a model enzyme (horseradish peroxidase). When not placed inside the microencapsulated liposomes, the enzyme lost its activity in solution at 37°C in a few days, whereas it retained 40% of the initial activity after 30 days of incubation at 37°C inside the microencapsulated liposomes.—Kibat, P. G.; Igari, Y.; Wheatley, M. A.; Eisen, H. N.; Langer, R. Enzymatically activated microencapsulated liposomes can provide pulsatile drug release. FASEB J. 4: 2533-2539; 1990."
https://openalex.org/W1534316452,"Adenylosuccinate lyase was cloned by functional complementation of an Escherichia coli purB mutant using an avian liver cDNA expression library. The derived amino acid sequence is homologous to the bacterial purB-encoded adenylosuccinate lyase which catalyzes the same two steps in purine biosynthesis as the enzyme from animals. Avian adenylosuccinate lyase also shows regions of extensive sequence similarity to the urea cycle enzyme, argininosuccinate lyase. This homology suggests a similar mechanism for catalysis. Homology of adenylosuccinate and argininosuccinate lyases is intriguing because chickens do not utilize the urea cycle in nitrogen excretion. This is the first report of the cloning of a eukaryotic cDNA encoding adenylosuccinate lyase, and it affords a route to isolate the corresponding human gene which has been suggested to be defective in autistic children."
https://openalex.org/W2134667619,"In BALB/c lung and lymph node γδ T cells, a large fraction of the expressed Vδ5 genes consist of an invariant sequence, BID (for BALB/c invariant delta). BID results from a direct joining of the Vδ5, Dδ2, and Jδ1 segments, which conserve their complete germline coding sequences. In C57BL/6 (H-2b) mice, where identical and functional segments are present in the germline, BID is absent. It appears that BID+ γδ T cells are positively selected by factors encoded outside of the classical MHC region, as indicated by their dominance in F1() and in BALB.B (H-2b) mice. Additional observations, including the expression of BID in nu/nu but not in nu/nu mice, suggest that the expansion of BID+ T cells essentially occurs extrathymically."
https://openalex.org/W1480837412,"Although previous studies have indicated that N-linked oligosaccharides on lysosomal enzymes in Dictyostelium discoideum are extensively phosphorylated and sulfated, the role of these modifications in the sorting and function of these enzymes remains to be determined. We have used radiolabel pulse-chase, subcellular fractionation, and immunofluorescence microscopy to analyze the transport, processing, secretion, and sorting of two lysosomal enzymes in a mutant, HL244, which is almost completely defective in sulfation. [3H]Mannose-labeled N-linked oligosaccharides were released from immunoprecipitated alpha-mannosidase and beta-glucosidase of HL244 by digestion with peptide: N-glycosidase. The size, Man9-10GlcNAc2, and processing of the neutral species were similar to that found in the wild type, but the anionic oligosaccharides were less charged than those from the wild-type enzymes. All of the negative charges on the oligosaccharides for HL244 were due to the presence of 1, 2, or 3 phosphodiesters and not to sulfate esters. The rate of proteolytic processing of precursor forms of alpha-mannosidase and beta-glucosidase to mature forms in HL244 was identical to wild type. The precursor polypeptides in the mutant and the wild type were membrane associated until being processed to mature forms; therefore, sulfated sugars are not essential for this association. Furthermore, the rate of transport of alpha-mannosidase and beta-glucosidase from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi complex was normal in the mutant as determined by the rate at which the newly synthesized proteins became resistant to the enzyme, endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H. There was no increase in the percentage of newly synthesized mutant precursors which escaped sorting and were secreted, and the intracellularly retained lysosomal enzymes were properly localized to lysosomes as determined by fractionation of cell organelles on Percoll gradients and immunofluorescence microscopy. However, the mutant secreted lysosomally localized mature forms of the enzymes at 2-fold lower rates than wild-type cells during both growth and during starvation conditions that stimulate secretion. Furthermore, the mutant was more resistant to the effects of chloroquine treatment which results in the missorting and oversecretion of lysosomal enzymes. Together, these results suggest that sulfation of N-linked oligosaccharides is not essential for the transport, processing, or sorting of lysosomal enzymes in D. discoideum, but these modified oligosaccharides may function in the secretion of mature forms of the enzymes from lysosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1591203759,"Eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF-2) is shown to bind ATP with high affinity. Binding of ATP to eIF-2 induces loss of the ability to form a ternary complex with Met-tRNAf and GTP, while still allowing, and even stimulating, the binding of mRNA. Ternary complex formation between eIF-2, GTP, and Met-tRNAf is inhibited effectively by ATP, but not by CTP or UTP. Hydrolysis of ATP is not required for inhibition, for adenyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP), a nonhydrolyzable analogue of ATP, is as active an inhibitor; adenosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate) (ATP gamma S) inhibits far more weakly. Ternary complex formation is inhibited effectively by ATP, dATP, or ADP, but not by AMP and adenosine. Hence, the gamma-phosphate of ATP and its 3'-OH group are not required for inhibition, but the beta-phosphate is indispensible. Specific complex formation between ATP and eIF-2 is shown 1) by effective retention of Met-tRNAf- and mRNA-binding activities on ATP-agarose and by the ability of free ATP, but not GTP, CTP, or UTP, to effect elution of eIF-2 from this substrate; 2) by eIF-2-dependent retention of [alpha-32P]ATP or dATP on nitrocellulose filters and its inhibition by excess ATP, but not by GTP, CTP, or UTP. Upon elution from ATP-agarose by high salt concentrations, eIF-2 recovers its ability to form a ternary complex with Met-tRNAf and GTP. ATP-induced inhibition of ternary complex formation is relieved by excess Met-tRNAf, but not by excess GTP or guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate (GMP-PNP). Thus, ATP does not act by inhibiting binding of GTP to eIF-2. Instead, ATP causes Met-tRNAf in ternary complex to dissociate from eIF-2. Conversely, affinity of eIF-2 for ATP is high in the absence of GTP and Met-tRNAf (Kd less than or equal to 10(-12) M), but decreases greatly in conditions of ternary complex formation. These results support the concept that eIF-2 assumes distinct conformations for ternary complex formation and for binding of mRNA, and that these are affected differently by ATP. Interaction of ATP with an eIF-2 molecule in ternary complex with Met-tRNAf and GTP promotes displacement of Met-tRNAf from eIF-2, inducing a state favorable for binding of mRNA. ATP may thus regulate the dual binding activities of eIF-2 during initiation of translation."
