https://openalex.org/W2124509905,"A set of experimental data which describes a curve on semilogarithmic paper may reflect the operation of a continuum of exponential processes, particularly in biological systems where variability is expected. The ""backward projection"" technique for graphic separation of exponential processes is most misleading when applied to systems in which the processes are distributed so that the standard deviation of halftimes is large compared to the mean halftime."

https://openalex.org/W2061838915,"In laboratory inoculation experiments, Rosen rye seedlings were more susceptible, Genesee wheat seedlings were less susceptible, and Trail barley seedlings were not susceptible to Claviceps purpurea. Guttation fluids from these plants were used as media for the growth of germinating spores of C. purpurea. Growth experiments consisted of spores which were germinated in thin agar films on microscope slides. Germ tube growth was determined by counting the tubes that crossed the perimeter of a square in the microscope field, counting the conidia in the square, and computing the number of crosses per conidium. Rye guttation fluid produced the most growth and barley fluid the least. Thus the degree of susceptibility is correlated with the amount of growth of the parasite in vitro."

The absorption maxima and extinction coefficients of the colored reactions were also obtained. The test is not specific for DDT. Of the compounds tested, the reaction was given by those having the structure > CHCX(3) or > C=CX(2.)."

It was simultaneously announced that the prize in chemistry has been awarded to two Britons, John Cowdery Kendrew and Max Ferdinand Perutz, of Cavendish Laboratory, Cambridge, for their studies of protein structure."

https://openalex.org/W1995156198,"ENERAL philosophy claims to be the critical subject which lays down for all of us what we may be allowed to think, and yet it has played no part whatever in the great revolutions of human thought of the present century-those connected with relativity and the quantum theory. It might have been expected that the scientists would have been constantly consulting the philosophers as to the legitimacy of their various speculations, but nothing of the kind has happened. Since no one can dispense with some sort of metaphysic, each scientist has made one for himself, and no doubt they contain many crudities, but it would seem that a deep interest in metaphysic is a disadvantage rather than an advantage to the physicist-at least I have the impression that those of my friends who are most inclined to speculate on the ultimate things appear to be the ones whose scientific work is most hampered by doing so. Now I propose to risk a similar indiscretion. I want to embody in it the practical philosophy of a physicist, and I do not mean it as an attack on the pure philosophers, who are very reasonable people, only chargeable with the minor offence of not having made me want to read their books! I had better begin by stating shortly the ideas I intend to discuss. There is a notable contrast between the way we think about things and the way we think we ought to think about them."
