https://openalex.org/W3080981445,"Several studies have revealed that the hyper-inflammatory response induced by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a major cause of disease severity and death. However, predictive biomarkers of pathogenic inflammation to help guide targetable immune pathways are critically lacking. We implemented a rapid multiplex cytokine assay to measure serum interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and IL-1β in hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) upon admission to the Mount Sinai Health System in New York. Patients (n = 1,484) were followed up to 41 d after admission (median, 8 d), and clinical information, laboratory test results and patient outcomes were collected. We found that high serum IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α levels at the time of hospitalization were strong and independent predictors of patient survival (P < 0.0001, P = 0.0205 and P = 0.0140, respectively). Notably, when adjusting for disease severity, common laboratory inflammation markers, hypoxia and other vitals, demographics, and a range of comorbidities, IL-6 and TNF-α serum levels remained independent and significant predictors of disease severity and death. These findings were validated in a second cohort of patients (n = 231). We propose that serum IL-6 and TNF-α levels should be considered in the management and treatment of patients with COVID-19 to stratify prospective clinical trials, guide resource allocation and inform therapeutic options. Elevated levels of serum IL-6 and TNF-α at the time of hospitalization are independent and significant predictors of clinical outcome in two cohorts of patients with COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W3080611254,"Plasticity of cancer invasion and metastasis depends on the ability of cancer cells to switch between collective and single-cell dissemination, controlled by cadherin-mediated cell-cell junctions. In clinical samples, E-cadherin-expressing and -deficient tumours both invade collectively and metastasize equally, implicating additional mechanisms controlling cell-cell cooperation and individualization. Here, using spatially defined organotypic culture, intravital microscopy of mammary tumours in mice and in silico modelling, we identify cell density regulation by three-dimensional tissue boundaries to physically control collective movement irrespective of the composition and stability of cell-cell junctions. Deregulation of adherens junctions by downregulation of E-cadherin and p120-catenin resulted in a transition from coordinated to uncoordinated collective movement along extracellular boundaries, whereas single-cell escape depended on locally free tissue space. These results indicate that cadherins and extracellular matrix confinement cooperate to determine unjamming transitions and stepwise epithelial fluidization towards, ultimately, cell individualization."
https://openalex.org/W3080682266,"Immunotherapies that target programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and its ligand PD-L1 as well as cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA4) have shown impressive clinical outcomes for multiple tumours. However, only a subset of patients achieves durable responses, suggesting that the mechanisms of the immune checkpoint pathways are not completely understood. Here, we report that PD-L1 translocates from the plasma membrane into the nucleus through interactions with components of the endocytosis and nucleocytoplasmic transport pathways, regulated by p300-mediated acetylation and HDAC2-dependent deacetylation of PD-L1. Moreover, PD-L1 deficiency leads to compromised expression of multiple immune-response-related genes. Genetically or pharmacologically modulating PD-L1 acetylation blocks its nuclear translocation, reprograms the expression of immune-response-related genes and, as a consequence, enhances the anti-tumour response to PD-1 blockade. Thus, our results reveal an acetylation-dependent regulation of PD-L1 nuclear localization that governs immune-response gene expression, and thereby advocate targeting PD-L1 translocation to enhance the efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade."
https://openalex.org/W3080999617,"Large-scale whole-genome sequencing studies have enabled the analysis of rare variants (RVs) associated with complex phenotypes. Commonly used RV association tests have limited scope to leverage variant functions. We propose STAAR (variant-set test for association using annotation information), a scalable and powerful RV association test method that effectively incorporates both variant categories and multiple complementary annotations using a dynamic weighting scheme. For the latter, we introduce 'annotation principal components', multidimensional summaries of in silico variant annotations. STAAR accounts for population structure and relatedness and is scalable for analyzing very large cohort and biobank whole-genome sequencing studies of continuous and dichotomous traits. We applied STAAR to identify RVs associated with four lipid traits in 12,316 discovery and 17,822 replication samples from the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine Program. We discovered and replicated new RV associations, including disruptive missense RVs of NPC1L1 and an intergenic region near APOC1P1 associated with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol."
https://openalex.org/W3081407028,"Differences in cardiac and aortic structure and function are associated with cardiovascular diseases and a wide range of other types of disease. Here we analyzed cardiovascular magnetic resonance images from a population-based study, the UK Biobank, using an automated machine-learning-based analysis pipeline. We report a comprehensive range of structural and functional phenotypes for the heart and aorta across 26,893 participants, and explore how these phenotypes vary according to sex, age and major cardiovascular risk factors. We extended this analysis with a phenome-wide association study, in which we tested for correlations of a wide range of non-imaging phenotypes of the participants with imaging phenotypes. We further explored the associations of imaging phenotypes with early-life factors, mental health and cognitive function using both observational analysis and Mendelian randomization. Our study illustrates how population-based cardiac and aortic imaging phenotypes can be used to better define cardiovascular disease risks as well as heart–brain health interactions, highlighting new opportunities for studying disease mechanisms and developing image-based biomarkers."
https://openalex.org/W3080806893,"Esports as the competitive play of digital games has gained considerable popularity. However, a comprehensive framework for esport training is still missing. In this paper, a performance model integrating insights from game research and sport science is developed. Based on this model, an online questionnaire was designed and applied to investigate training in different esports regarding relevant competencies and training areas. Overall, 1,835 esports players voluntarily participated in the study. Age ranged from 13 to 47 years (M = 20,9; SD = 4,5), and males clearly dominated (95%). Furthermore, the mean weakly playing time was 20.03 hours (SD = 15.8). Training occupied 38.85% (7.75 h) of the playing time on average. On the one hand, the results reveal game-specific competence and training structures in the five esports selected for the study (Starcraft II, League of Legends, Rocket League, FIFA, and Counter Strike). On the other hand, the factor structure of competencies closely resembles the esports performance model. As a conclusion, esports training methods should always consider the specific competence profile of the respective esports game."
https://openalex.org/W3081387174,"Introduction Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia is associated to systemic hyper-inflammation and abnormal coagulation profile. D-dimer elevation is particularly frequent, and values higher than 1μg/mL have been associated with disease severity and in-hospital mortality. Previous retrospective studies found a high pulmonary embolism (PE) prevalence, however, it should be highlighted that diagnoses were only completed when PE was clinically suspected. Material and methods Single-center prospective cohort study. Between April 6th and April 17th 2020, consecutive confirmed cases of COVID-19 pneumonia with D-dimer >1 μg/mL underwent computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) to investigate the presence and magnitude of PE. Demographic and laboratory data, comorbidities, CTPA scores, administered treatments, and, clinical outcomes were analysed and compared between patients with and without PE. Results Thirty consecutive patients (11 women) were included. PE was diagnosed in 15 patients (50%). In patients with PE, emboli were located mainly in segmental arteries (86%) and bilaterally (60%). Patients with PE were significantly older (median age 67.0 (IQR 63.0–73.0) vs. 57.0 (IQR 48.0–69.0) years, p = .048) and did not differ in sex or risk factors for thromboembolic disease from the non-PE group. D-dimer, platelet count, and, C reactive protein values were significantly higher among PE patients. D-dimer values correlated with the radiologic magnitude of PE (p<0.001). Conclusions Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and D-dimer values higher than 1 μg/mL presented a high prevalence of PE, regardless of clinical suspicion. We consider that these findings could contribute to improve the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, by initiating anticoagulant therapy when a PE is found."
https://openalex.org/W3080690601,"Cardiometabolic disorders are frequently observed among those who have obesity as measured by body mass index (BMI). However, there is limited data available on the cardiometabolic profile of those who are non-obese by BMI but with a high body fat percentage (BFP), a phenotype frequently observed in the Indian population. We examined the prevalence of individuals with normal weight obesity (NWO) and the cardiometabolic profile of NWO individuals at high risk for type 2 diabetes(T2D) in a south Asian population.In the Kerala Diabetes Prevention Program, individuals aged between 30 to 60 years were screened using the Indian Diabetes Risk Score(IDRS) in 60 rural communities in the Indian state of Kerala. We used data from the baseline survey of this trial for this analysis which included 1147 eligible high diabetes risk individuals(IDRS >60). NWO was defined as BMI within the normal range and a high BFP (as per Asia-pacific ethnicity based cut-off); Non-obese (NO) as normal BMI and BFP and overtly obese (OB) as BMI ≥25 kg/m2 irrespective of the BFP. Data on demographic, clinical and biochemical characteristics were collected using standardized questionnaires and protocols. Body fat percentage was assessed using TANITA body composition analyser (model SC330), based on bioelectrical impedance.The mean age of participants was 47.3 ± 7.5 years and 46% were women. The proportion with NWO was 32% (n = 364; 95% CI: 29.1 to 34.5%), NO was 17% (n = 200) and OB was 51% (n = 583). Among those with NWO, 19.7% had T2D, compared to 18.7% of those who were OB (p value = 0.45) and 8% with NO (p value = 0.003). Among those with NWO, mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure were 129 ± 20; 78 ± 12 mmHg, compared to 127 ± 17; 78±11 mmHg among those with OB (p value = 0.12;0.94) and 120 ± 16; 71±10 mmHg among with NO (p value<0.001; 0.001), respectively. A similar pattern of association was observed for LDL cholesterol and triglycerides. After adjusting for other risk factors, the odds of having diabetes (OR:2.72[95% CI:1.46-5.08]) and dyslipidemia (2.37[1.55-3.64]) was significantly more in individuals with NWO as compared to non-obese individuals.Almost one-third of this South Asian population, at high risk for T2D, had normal weight obesity. The significantly higher cardiometabolic risk associated with increased adiposity even in lower BMI individuals has important implications for recognition in clinical practice."
https://openalex.org/W3080636251,"Determining the spatial organization of chromatin in cells mainly relies on crosslinking-based chromosome conformation capture techniques, but resolution and signal-to-noise ratio of these approaches is limited by interference from DNA-bound proteins. Here we introduce chemical-crosslinking assisted proximity capture (CAP-C), a method that uses multifunctional chemical crosslinkers with defined sizes to capture chromatin contacts. CAP-C generates chromatin contact maps at subkilobase (sub-kb) resolution with low background noise. We applied CAP-C to formaldehyde prefixed mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) and investigated loop domains (median size of 200 kb) and nonloop domains (median size of 9 kb). Transcription inhibition caused a greater loss of contacts in nonloop domains than loop domains. We uncovered conserved, transcription-state-dependent chromatin compartmentalization at high resolution that is shared from Drosophila to human, and a transcription-initiation-dependent nuclear subcompartment that brings multiple nonloop domains in close proximity. We also showed that CAP-C could be used to detect native chromatin conformation without formaldehyde prefixing."
https://openalex.org/W3080387940,"Background Ocular inflammation causes significant visual morbidity in the United States, yet little is known about the epidemiology of infectious uveitis and scleritis. This study aims to evaluate the epidemiology of infectious uveitis/scleritis employing a large national medical claims database. Methods This was a retrospective, case-control study, employing Optum’s de-identified Clinformatics® Data Mart Database, containing data from 21.5 million privately insured individuals with enrollment for at least 15 months within 2007–2015. Inclusion in the uveitis/scleritis sample required an index uveitis/scleritis diagnosis based on International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes. Exclusion criteria included index date within 3 months after intraocular surgery. Rates for uveitis/scleritis were determined by anatomic site. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to determine odds ratios for the incidence and prevalence of uveitis/scleritis by anatomic category. Findings Infectious etiologies accounted for less than 20% of uveitis/scleritis, with mean rates of 18.9 (incidence) and 60.6 (prevalence) per 100,000 persons. The mean prevalences of infectious anterior, intermediate, posterior, panuveitis, and scleritis were 27.7, 0.17, 23.4, 4.4, and 4.6, per 100,000, respectively. Overall risk of prevalent infectious uveitis/scleritis increased with age (OR>3.3 for each decade over age 18, p<0.01), female sex (OR = 1.2, p<0.01), non-Hispanic white race (OR<1 for all other races, p<0.01), as well as the East South Central census division (OR = 1.2, p<0.01), comprising Alabama, Kentucky, Missouri, and Tennessee. Medical comorbidities, including HIV infection (OR = 6.4, p<0.01) and rheumatologic disease (OR = 1.9, p<0.01), were common in the infectious uveitis/scleritis cohort. Conclusions The incidence and prevalence of infectious uveitis/scleritis in the United States were higher than previously reported estimates but remained lower than in developing countries. Rates varied by age, sex, race, and medical comorbidities, and may reflect differential susceptibility to various infectious agents with disparate geographic distributions within the United States."

https://openalex.org/W3081116366,"Epigenetic plasticity is a pivotal factor that drives metastasis. Here, we show that the promoter of the gene that encodes the ubiquitin ligase subunit FBXL7 is hypermethylated in advanced prostate and pancreatic cancers, correlating with decreased FBXL7 mRNA and protein levels. Low FBXL7 mRNA levels are predictive of poor survival in patients with pancreatic and prostatic cancers. FBXL7 mediates the ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation of active c-SRC after its phosphorylation at Ser 104. The DNA-demethylating agent decitabine recovers FBXL7 expression and limits epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and cell invasion in a c-SRC-dependent manner. In vivo, FBXL7-depleted cancer cells form tumours with a high metastatic burden. Silencing of c-SRC or treatment with the c-SRC inhibitor dasatinib together with FBXL7 depletion prevents metastases. Furthermore, decitabine reduces metastases derived from prostate and pancreatic cancer cells in a FBXL7-dependent manner. Collectively, this research implicates FBXL7 as a metastasis-suppressor gene and suggests therapeutic strategies to counteract metastatic dissemination of pancreatic and prostatic cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W3080299350,"Genetics of pigs has been well studied in Europe and Asia, but most of previous studies of molecular phylogeny of Sus scrofa have been based on sequences of both wild and domestic forms. In this study we analysed genetic traits of Sus scrofa from 13 regions in Asia (including previously undisclosed Eastern Caucasus and Trans-Baikal regions) using purely wild boar samples. Mitochondrial control region and Y-chromosome genes (AMELY & USP9Y) were employed to resolve phylogeographic relationships. We discussed spatio-temporal dynamics of wild boar distribution and compared molecular data to morphological and cytogenetic data on wild boar variability and taxonomy. A total of 51 haplotypes were detected in mtDNA control region and five haplotypes were found in combined sequences of Y-chromosome genes. The phylogeography of Asia-wide wild boars supported a hypothesis of migration from South-East Asia to South Asia, followed by migration to East and West Asia. We present a hypothesis about independent dispersal of wild boars into West Asia from South and North-East Asia. Mitochondrial DNA phylogeny generally fits the morphologically based intraspecies taxonomy. Distribution of chromosomal variants of wild boar presently does not show clear correlation with mtDNA clades."
https://openalex.org/W3081373177,"Roasting is the most common method of processing coffee. During roasting, aromatic compounds are generated due to various reactions, which are important for developing color, flavor and aroma. Acrylamide is an undesirable carcinogenic substance that is metabolically activated and formed during the coffee roasting process. Coffea arabica was first found in Ethiopia, and Ethiopia can produce a large volume of coffee. The major coffee-producing areas in Ethiopia are Hararghe, Sidama, Gimbi/Nekemte, Yergachefe and Limu. The primary purpose of this study was to quantify the acrylamide contents of brewed and roasted coffee collected from street coffee sellers and industrial processors found in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, and optimize the roasting conditions for Sidama coffee. The acrylamide contents were determined by HPLC using a DAD at 210 nm, the antioxidant property were examined using a UV–spectrophotometer, and moisture and nutrient composition of coffee was determined using the method described by the AOAC (Association of Official Analytical Chemists). The roasting temperature and time were optimized based on the acrylamide content, nutritional composition and antioxidant property of the coffee using central composite design. The roasting temperature and time significantly affected (p<0.05) the acrylamide level, nutritional composition and antioxidant property of the coffee. The acrylamide contents of street and industrial processed powdered coffee were 346 ±19 to 701±38μg/kg and 442±14 to 906±7μg/kg, respectively. Brewed coffee from street vendors and industrial processing had acrylamide contents of 25±2 to 49±1μg/L and 63±2 to 89±4μg/L, respectively. The EC50 values for scavenging radicals for the optimized coffee ranged from 171±0 to 111±4 μg/L. The optimal roasting temperature and time were 190°C and 6 minutes, at this temperature and time the acrylamide content decreased, and the antioxidant and nutritional compositions of the coffee improved."
https://openalex.org/W3081213870,"Background Data on morbidity and mortality are essential in assessing disease burden, monitoring and evaluation of health policies. The aim of this study is to describe the causes of morbidity and mortality in the wards of University of Calabar Teaching Hospital (UCTH). Methods The study took a retrospective approach evaluating causes of morbidity and mortality from 2012–2017. Causes of death were documented based on International Classification of Disease 10 (ICD-10). Data were retrieved from health records department, UCTH. Results Overall, 2,198 deaths were recorded out of the 49,287 admissions during the study period giving a mortality rate of 4.5% comprising 1,152 (52.4%) males and 1,046 (47.6%) females. A greater number of males were admitted via accident and emergency. Age group 15–45 years had the highest number of admissions (57.9%) and deaths (37.7%), while age group >65 years recorded the highest number of deaths per admission (9.7% mortality rate). The broad leading causes of death were infectious and parasitic disease and diseases of the circulatory system (cardiovascular diseases) accounting for 22.7% and 15.8% of all deaths, respectively. However, diseases of the circulatory system recorded the highest number of deaths per admission (13.7% mortality rate). Overall, infectious diseases were the chief cause of mortality in adults while conditions originating from perinatal period were the major cause of death in children. Septicemia (6.0%), stroke (4.2%), liver diseases (4.1%), tuberculosis (3.7%), diabetes (3.6%) and HIV/AIDS (3.4%) were the specific leading cases of deaths. Sepsis, chronic diseases of the tonsil and adenoids and malaria were the specific leading causes of death in children, while sepsis, stroke and liver diseases were the leading cause of death in adults. Conclusion Most causes of deaths in this study are preventable. This study revealed double burden of communicable and non-communicable diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3080312845,"The chemotherapeutic agent cisplatin is renowned for its ototoxic effects. While hair cells in the cochlea are established targets of cisplatin, less is known regarding the afferent synapse, which is an essential component in the faithful temporal transmission of sound. The glutamate aspartate transporter (GLAST) shields the auditory synapse from excessive glutamate release, and its loss of function increases the vulnerability to noise, salicylate, and aminoglycosides. Until now, the involvement of GLAST in cisplatin-mediated ototoxicity remains unknown. Here, we test in mice lacking GLAST the effects of a low-dose cisplatin known not to cause any detectable change in hearing thresholds. When administered at nighttime, a mild hearing loss in GLAST KO mice was found but not at daytime, revealing a potential circadian regulation of the vulnerability to cisplatin-mediated ototoxicity. We show that the auditory synapse of GLAST KO mice is more vulnerable to cisplatin administration during the active phase (nighttime) when compared to WT mice and treatment during the inactive phase (daytime). This effect was not related to the abundance of platinum compounds in the cochlea, rather cisplatin had a dose-dependent impact on cochlear clock rhythms only after treatment at nighttime suggesting that cisplatin can modulate the molecular clock. Our findings suggest that the current protocols of cisplatin administration in humans during daytime may cause a yet undetectable damage to the auditory synapse, more so in already damaged ears, and severely impact auditory sensitivity in cancer survivors."

https://openalex.org/W3080454854,"The natural antivitamin 2′-methoxy-thiamine (MTh) is implicated in the suppression of microbial growth. However, its mode of action and enzyme-selective inhibition mechanism have remained elusive. Intriguingly, MTh inhibits some thiamine diphosphate (ThDP) enzymes, while being coenzymatically active in others. Here we report the strong inhibition of Escherichia coli transketolase activity by MTh and unravel its mode of action and the structural basis thereof. The unique 2′-methoxy group of MTh diphosphate (MThDP) clashes with a canonical glutamate required for cofactor activation in ThDP-dependent enzymes. This glutamate is forced into a stable, anticatalytic low-barrier hydrogen bond with a neighboring glutamate, disrupting cofactor activation. Molecular dynamics simulations of transketolases and other ThDP enzymes identify active-site flexibility and the topology of the cofactor-binding locale as key determinants for enzyme-selective inhibition. Human enzymes either retain enzymatic activity with MThDP or preferentially bind authentic ThDP over MThDP, while core bacterial metabolic enzymes are inhibited, demonstrating therapeutic potential. Structural and biochemical analysis of E. coli transketolase with 2′-methoxy-thiamine shows that this antivitamin selectively inhibits the bacterial enzyme via a steric clash with a critical glutamate residue, preventing cofactor activation."
https://openalex.org/W3080146224,"The chemokine receptor CXCR4, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) capable of heteromerizing with other GPCRs, is involved in many processes, including immune responses, hematopoiesis, and organogenesis. Evidence suggests that CXCR4 activation reduces thrombin/protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1)-induced impairment of endothelial barrier function. However, the mechanisms underlying cross-talk between CXCR4 and PAR1 are not well-understood. Using intermolecular bioluminescence resonance energy transfer and proximity ligation assays, we found that CXCR4 heteromerizes with PAR1 in the HEK293T expression system and in human primary pulmonary endothelial cells (hPPECs). A peptide analog of transmembrane domain 2 (TM2) of CXCR4 interfered with PAR1:CXCR4 heteromerization. In HTLA cells, the presence of CXCR4 reduced the efficacy of thrombin to induce β-arrestin-2 recruitment to recombinant PAR1 and enhanced thrombin-induced Ca2+ mobilization. Whereas thrombin-induced extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) phosphorylation occurred more transiently in the presence of CXCR4, peak ERK1/2 phosphorylation was increased when compared with HTLA cells expressing PAR1 alone. CXCR4-associated effects on thrombin-induced β-arrestin-2 recruitment to and signaling of PAR1 could be reversed by TM2. In hPPECs, TM2 inhibited thrombin-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation and activation of Ras homolog gene family member A. CXCR4 siRNA knockdown inhibited thrombin-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Whereas thrombin stimulation reduced surface expression of PAR1, CXCR4, and PAR1:CXCR4 heteromers, chemokine (CXC motif) ligand 12 stimulation reduced surface expression of CXCR4 and PAR1:CXCR4 heteromers, but not of PAR1. Finally, TM2 dose-dependently inhibited thrombin-induced impairment of hPPEC monolayer permeability. Our findings suggest that CXCR4:PAR1 heteromerization enhances thrombin-induced G protein signaling of PAR1 and PAR1-mediated endothelial barrier disruption."
https://openalex.org/W3080236096,"Majority of neonatal deaths in developing countries have been associated with inappropriate or poorly practiced newborn care, specifically safe cord care, optimal thermal care and early initiation and practice of exclusive breastfeeding. There is limited information about the quality of these essential newborn care practices in Accra, Ghana. The main objective of this study was to assess the knowledge about and quality of essential newborn care practices (ENC) and determine related factors in La Dade Kotopon Municipal Assembly, Accra, Ghana. A questionnaire-based, cross-sectional study was conducted among 423 mothers and caregivers in two hospitals to assess safe cord care, optimal thermal care and exclusive breastfeeding. Knowledge was assessed using eight statements regarding ENC and categorized as ‘Adequate knowledge’ and ‘Inadequate knowledge’ using a composite score. Practices were similarly categorized as ‘Good’ and ‘Poor’ ENC. Data were exported from Microsoft Excel into STATA version 15 for statistical analysis. Descriptive statistics were generated and inferential analysis was done using chi-square test and logistic regression to determine factors associated with good ENC at 95% confidence level. All respondents sampled participated in the study. A total of 263 (62%) respondents had adequate knowledge and 308 (73%) respondents practiced appropriate newborn care (‘Good’ ENC). The likelihood of appropriate newborn care practices was lower among mothers/caregivers who were unemployed (AOR = 0.13, 95% CI: 0.09–0.26), who had a home delivery (AOR = 0.17, 95% CI: 0.11–0.69) and made their first antenatal visit in the third trimester (AOR = 0.02, 95% CI: 0.01–0.35) compared to their counterparts. Knowledge of ENC was not associated with practice in this study. Appropriate newborn care practices were relatively high among the respondents. Improving sources of livelihood and targeted education to encourage early antenatal visits and facility-based births might improve newborn care where it is inadequate."
https://openalex.org/W3081112659,"Background The Foot health of a child plays a pivotal role in their participation in play, locomotive activities, healthy lifestyle, somatic development, and weight management. The burden of flatfoot among children in Ethiopia is not known. The objective of this study was to analyze the structure of the medial foot arch using Staheli plantar arch index and investigate its associated factors among larger sample school children, aged 11–15 years in Ethiopia. Methods A school-based cross-sectional study was conducted among children aged 11–15 years from eleven randomly selected primary schools. The sample size was determined proportionally across school strength and governmental and private schools to ensure variety within the sample. Data collection consisted of physical measurements, footprint-based measures whilst full weight-bearing, and a structured questionnaire on foot pain, footwear type, and physical activity. Data were analyzed descriptively and through uni- and multivariate logistic regression model. Results A total of 823 children participated. The overall prevalence of flatfoot was 17.6% with a significant difference between age, gender, type of school, BMI, and type of footwear. Being younger (OR 3.3, 95% CI 1.6–6.7), male (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.0–2.4), experiencing foot pain (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.0–3.5), wearing closed shoe (OR 4.4, 95% CI 1.6–11.9), overweight (OR 3.8, 95% CI 1.2–8.7), obese (OR 4.2, 95% CI 2.5–10.9), and low level of physical activity (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.0–4.6) were significantly associated with flatfoot. Children who were overweight, obese, and also experiencing foot pain have a 2.8 (95% CI 1.62–5.94) and 4.1 (95% CI 2.85–8.31) times greater chance of having flatfoot respectively. The prevalence of flatfoot among 560 normal weight children was 17.5%. Conclusions The findings of this study demonstrated that the overall prevalence and the prevalence of flatfoot among normal-weight children are almost the same. There is a definite need to develop a screening algorithm for diagnosis and treatment indication for this children's lower extremity disorder."
https://openalex.org/W3080164395,"This study evaluated the influence of type 2 diabetes mellitus on bone loss, bone repair and cytokine production in hyperglycemic rats, treated or not with metformin. The animals were distributed as follow: Non-Hyperglycemic (NH), Non Hyperglycemic with Ligature (NH-L), Treated Non Hyperglycemic (TNH), Treated Non Hyperglycemic with Ligature Treated (TNH-L), Hyperglycemic (H), Treated Hyperglycemic (TH), Hyperglycemic with Ligature (H-L), Treated Hyperglycemic with Ligature (TH-L). At 40th day after induction of hyperglycemia, the groups NH-L, TNH-L, H-L, TH-L received a ligature to induce periodontitis. On the 69th, the TNH, TNH-L, TH, TH-L groups received metformin until the end of the study. Bone repair was evaluated at histometric and the expression levels of Sox9, RunX2 and Osterix. Analysis of the ex-vivo expression of TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-12, IL-4, TGF-β, IL-10, IL-6 and IL-17 were also evaluated. Metformin partially reverse induced bone loss in NH and H animals. Lower OPG/RANKL, increased OCN and TRAP expression were observed in hyperglycemic animals, and treatment with metformin partially reversed hyperglycemia on the OPG/RANKL, OPN and TRAP expression in the periodontitis. The expression of SOX9 and RunX2 were also decreased by hyperglycemia and metformin treatment. Increased ex vivo levels of TNF-α, IL-6, IL-4, IL-10 and IL-17 was observed. Hyperglycemia promoted increased IL-10 levels compared to non-hyperglycemic ones. Treatment of NH with metformin was able to mediate increased levels of TNF-α, IL-10 and IL-17, whereas for H an increase of TNF-α and IL-17 was detected in the 24- or 48-hour after stimulation with LPS. Ligature was able to induce increased levels of TNF-α and IL-17 in both NH and H. This study revealed the negative impact of hyperglycemia and/or treatment with metformin in the bone repair via inhibition of transcription factors associated with osteoblastic differentiation."

The performance and the finite sample properties of the different estimators are compared in terms of relative biases and relative mean squared errors. The Mont Carlo simulation study revels that the percentile and maximum product of spacing methods are highly competitive with the other methods for small and large sample sizes. To show the applicability and the importance of the proposed estimators, we analyze one real data set."
https://openalex.org/W3080728069,"Background/Purpose To date, studies examining polymicrobial infections in ocular disease have mostly been limited to keratitis or endophthalmitis. We characterized polybacterial infections compared to monobacterial infections in prior clinical studies evaluating besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension 0.6% for the treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis and report on associated microbiological outcomes. Methods In this post-hoc analysis, microbiological data for subjects with conjunctivitis due to one or more than one bacterial species in three previous studies (two vehicle-, one active-controlled) of besifloxacin were extracted. Bacterial species identified at baseline were deemed causative if their colony count equaled or exceeded species-specific prespecified threshold criteria. In subjects with polybacterial infections, the fold-increase over threshold was used to rank order the contribution of individual species. Baseline pathogens and their minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for common ophthalmic antibiotics were compared by infection type, as were microbial eradication rates following treatment with besifloxacin. Results Of 1041 subjects with culture-confirmed conjunctivitis, 17% had polybacterial and 83% had monobacterial conjunctivitis at baseline. In polybacterial compared to monobacterial infections, Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae were identified less frequently as the dominant infecting species (P = 0.042 and P<0.001, respectively), whereas Streptococcus mitis/S. mitis group was identified more frequently as dominant (P<0.001). Viral coinfection was also identified more frequently in polybacterial infections (P<0.001). Staphylococcus aureus was the most common coinfecting species in polybacterial infections and the second most common dominant species in such infections. With few exceptions, MICs for individual species were comparable regardless of infection type. Clinical microbial eradication rates with besifloxacin were high regardless of infection type (P≤0.016 vs vehicle at follow-up visits). Conclusions Approximately one in five subjects with bacterial conjunctivitis are infected with more than one bacterial species underscoring the need for a broad-spectrum antibiotic for such infections. Besifloxacin treatment resulted in robust eradication rates of these infections comparable to monobacterial infections. Trial registration NCT000622908, NCT00347932, NCT00348348"
https://openalex.org/W3080935205,"Regulation of gene expression at the translational level is key to determining cell fate and function. An RNA-binding protein, RNG140 (caprin2), plays a role in eye lens differentiation and has been reported to function in translational regulation. However, the mechanism and its role in eyes has remained unclear. Here, we show that RNG140 binds to the translation initiation factor eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF3) and suppresses translation through mechanisms involving suppression of eIF3-dependent translation initiation. Comprehensive ribosome profiling revealed that overexpression of RNG140 in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells reduces translation of long mRNAs, including those associated with cell proliferation. RNG140-mediated translational regulation also operates in the mouse eye, where RNG140 knockout increased the translation of long mRNAs. mRNAs involved in lens differentiation, such as crystallin mRNAs, are short and can escape translational inhibition by RNG140 and be translated in differentiating lenses. Thus, this study provides insights into the mechanistic basis of lens cell transition from proliferation to differentiation via RNG140-mediated translational regulation."
https://openalex.org/W3080099836,"The use of reference genes is required for relative quantification in gene expression analysis and the stability of these genes can be variable depending on the experimental design. Therefore, it is indispensable to test the reliability of endogenous genes previously to their use. This study evaluated nine candidate reference genes to select the most stable genes to be used as reference in gene expression studies with the femoral cartilage of normal and epiphysiolysis-affected broilers. The femur articular cartilage of 29 male broilers with 35 days of age was collected, frozen and further submitted to RNA extraction and quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis. The candidate reference genes evaluated were GAPDH, HMBS, HPRT1, MRPS27, MRPS30, RPL30, RPL4, RPL5, and RPLP1. For the gene stability evaluation, three software were used: GeNorm, BestKeeper and NormFinder, and a global ranking was generated using the function RankAggreg. In this study, the RPLP1 and RPL5 were the most reliable endogenous genes being recommended for expression studies with femur cartilage in broilers with epiphysiolysis and possible other femur anomalies."
https://openalex.org/W3081066059,"It is now widely accepted that the perception of emotional expression in music can be vastly different from the feelings evoked by it. However, less understood is how the locus of emotion affects the experience of music, that is how the act of perceiving the emotion in music compares with the act of assessing the emotion induced in the listener by the music. In the current study, we compared these two emotion loci based on the psychophysiological response of 40 participants listening to 32 musical excerpts taken from movie soundtracks. Facial electromyography, skin conductance, respiration and heart rate were continuously measured while participants were required to assess either the emotion expressed by, or the emotion they felt in response to the music. Using linear mixed effects models, we found a higher mean response in psychophysiological measures for the “perceived” than the “felt” task. This result suggested that the focus on one’s self distracts from the music, leading to weaker bodily reactions during the “felt” task. In contrast, paying attention to the expression of the music and consequently to changes in timbre, loudness and harmonic progression enhances bodily reactions. This study has methodological implications for emotion induction research using psychophysiology and the conceptualization of emotion loci. Firstly, different tasks can elicit different psychophysiological responses to the same stimulus and secondly, both tasks elicit bodily responses to music. The latter finding questions the possibility of a listener taking on a purely cognitive mode when evaluating emotion expression."
https://openalex.org/W3080855099,"Rabies is a lethal viral disease and dogs are the major disease reservoir in the Philippines. Spatio-temporal variations in environmental factors are known to affect disease dynamics. Some rabies-affected countries considered investigating the role of weather components in driving rabies cases and it has helped them to strategize their control efforts. In this study, cointegration analysis was conducted between the monthly reported rabies cases and the weather components, such as temperature and precipitation, to verify the effect of weather components on rabies incidence in Davao City, Philippines. With the Engle-Granger cointegration tests, we found that rabies cases are cointegrated into each of the weather components. It was further validated, using the Granger causality test, that each weather component predicts the rabies cases and not vice versa. Moreover, we performed the Johansen cointegration test to show that the weather components simultaneously affect the number of rabies cases, which allowed us to estimate a vector-error correction model for rabies incidence as a function of temperature and precipitation. Our analyses showed that canine rabies in Davao City was weather-sensitive, which implies that rabies incidence could be projected using established long-run relationship among reported rabies cases, temperature, and precipitation. This study also provides empirical evidence that can guide local health officials in formulating preventive strategies for rabies control and eradication based on weather patterns."
https://openalex.org/W3081203057,"World ecosystems are suffering from anthropogenic and natural pressure. The IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) has developed analogous criteria for the Red List of Threatened Species in order to perform similar risk assessments on ecosystems, creating the Red List of Ecosystems (RLE) methodology. One of the most significant challenges for the construction of these lists is gathering the available information to apply the criteria. By applying IUCN RLE criteria B (the extent of restricted geographic distribution of an ecosystem), we analyzed the threat level of 64 forest ecosystems of the Ecuadorian mainland. According to the results, limited distribution is the key risk to threatened ecosystems, which are associated with anthropogenic pressures. Our study showed that 22% of forest ecosystems are classified as threatened. This evaluation of the forest ecosystem status at a national level could lead to public awareness towards ecosystem conservation and provide reasonable strategies to managers."

https://openalex.org/W3080230605,"Vegetation mapping is of considerable significance to both geoscience and mountain ecology, and the improved resolution of remote sensing images makes it possible to map vegetation at a finer scale. While the automatic classification of vegetation has gradually become a research hotspot, real-time and rapid collection of samples has become a bottleneck. How to achieve fine-scale classification and automatic sample selection at the same time needs further study. Stratified sampling based on appropriate prior knowledge is an effective sampling method for geospatial objects. Therefore, based on the idea of stratified sampling, this paper used the following three steps to realize the automatic selection of representative samples and classification of fine-scale mountain vegetation: 1) using Mountain Altitudinal Belt (MAB) distribution information to stratify the study area into multiple vegetation belts; 2) selecting and correcting samples through iterative clustering at each belt automatically; 3) using RF (Random Forest) classifier with strong robustness to achieve automatic classification. The average sample accuracy of nine vegetation formations was 0.933, and the total accuracy of the classification result was 92.2%, with the kappa coefficient of 0.910. The results showed that this method could automatically select high-quality samples and obtain a high-accuracy vegetation map. Compared with the traditional vegetation mapping method, this method greatly improved the efficiency, which is of great significance for the fine-scale mountain vegetation mapping in large-scale areas."
https://openalex.org/W3080345530,"Although there is a wide array of evidence showing the beneficial effect of religiosity on violence among adolescents, nationwide studies in the general population are scarce. This study aims to explore whether religiosity is associated or not with diminishing violence in a Brazilian population-based representative sample. This observational cross-sectional study was conducted in 2011–2012 using face-to-face interviews and included 4,608 individuals 14 years and older. The survey included measures of religiosity (religious affiliation and importance of religion), violence (involvement in fights, domestic violence and police detention), depression, social support and alcohol dependence. We used logistic regression models and mediation analyses. In the total sample analyses, after adjustments, having a religious affiliation was inversely associated with lower involvement in fights (OR = 0.60,CI95%:0.37–0.98) and less police detention (OR = 0.37,CI95%:0.20–0.70), whereas the importance of religion was only associated with less fights (OR = 0.60,CI95%:0.36–0.99). Subanalyses revealed different associations depending on the age group evaluated. Mediation tests showed that the association of religious affiliation on violence outcomes was mediated by alcohol use. In conclusion, religiosity seems to be an important factor associated with lower levels of violence in this nationwide representative survey and alcohol dependence seems to mediate this relationship. Health professionals should be aware of these findings in their clinical practice."
https://openalex.org/W3081240286,"Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), one of the leading causes of cancer-related death, has a low 5-year survival rate owing to the inevitable acquired resistance toward antitumor drugs, platinum-based chemotherapy, and targeted therapy. Epidermal growth factor (EGF)-EGF receptor (EGFR) signaling activates downstream events leading to phospholipase C/inositol trisphosphate (IP3)/Ca2+ release from IP3-sensitive Ca2+ stores to modulate cell proliferation, motility, and invasion. However, the role of EGFR-mediated Ca2+ signaling in acquired drug resistance is not fully understood. Here, we analyzed alterations of intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) responses between gefitinib-sensitive NSCLC PC-9 cells and gefitinib-resistant NSCLC PC-9/GR cells, and we found that acute EGF treatment elicited intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) oscillations in PC-9 cells but not in PC-9/GR cells. PC-9/GR cells presented a more sustained basal [Ca2+]i level, lower endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ level, and higher spontaneous extracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]e) influx than PC-9 cells. Notably, restricting [Ca2+]e in both cell types induced identical [Ca2+]i oscillations, dependent on phospholipase C and EGFR activation. Consequently, restricting [Ca2+]e in PC-9/GR cells upregulated gefitinib-mediated poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage, an increase in Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, cytotoxicity, and apoptosis. In addition, nuclear factor of activated T cell (NFAT1) induction in response to EGF was inhibited by gefitinib in PC-9 cells, whereas EGF-mediated NFAT1 induction in PC-9/GR cells was sustained regardless of gefitinib treatment. Restricting [Ca2+]e in PC-9/GR cells significantly reduced EGF-mediated NFAT1 induction. These findings indicate that spontaneous [Ca2+]e influx in NSCLC cells plays a pivotal role in developing acquired drug resistance and suggest that restricting [Ca2+]e may be a potential strategy for modulating drug-sensitivity."

Rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) are the most widely used nonhuman primates in biomedical research. We constructed a high-resolution genetic map of the rhesus genome based on whole genome sequence data from Indian-origin rhesus macaques. The genetic markers used were approximately 18 million SNPs, with marker density 6.93 per kb across the autosomes. We report that the genome-wide recombination rate in rhesus macaques is significantly lower than rates observed in apes or humans, while the distribution of recombination across the macaque genome is more uniform. These observations provide new comparative information regarding the evolution of recombination in primates."
https://openalex.org/W3080570863,"Nocturnin (NOCT) is a eukaryotic enzyme that belongs to a superfamily of exoribonucleases, endonucleases, and phosphatases. In this study, we analyze the expression, processing, localization, and cellular functions of human NOCT. We find that NOCT protein is differentially expressed and processed in a cell and tissue type-specific manner to control its localization to the cytoplasm or mitochondrial exterior or interior. The N terminus of NOCT is necessary and sufficient to confer import and processing in the mitochondria. We measured the impact of cytoplasmic NOCT on the transcriptome and observed that it affects mRNA levels of hundreds of genes that are significantly enriched in osteoblast, neuronal, and mitochondrial functions. Recent biochemical data indicate that NOCT dephosphorylates NADP(H) metabolites, and thus we measured the effect of NOCT on these cofactors in cells. We find that NOCT increases NAD(H) and decreases NADP(H) levels in a manner dependent on its intracellular localization. Collectively, our data indicate that NOCT can regulate levels of both mRNAs and NADP(H) cofactors in a manner specified by its location in cells."
https://openalex.org/W3080708048,"Adjusted plus minus (APM) measures have redefined our understanding of player value in basketball and hockey, where both are team games featuring player productivity spillovers. APM measures use seasonal play-by-play data to estimate individual player contributions. If a team's overall score margin success is figuratively represented by a pie, APM measures are well-designed to slice the pie and attribute individual contributions accordingly. However, they do not account for the possibility that better players can increase the overall size of the pie and thus increase the size of the slice (overall APM value) for teammates. Herein, we use data from NBA player-season Real Plus Minus (RPM)—a leading APM measure—for all recorded player-seasons from 2013–19 and player lineup data to test whether RPM is related to teammate quality. We run sets of linear fixed effect regression models to explain variation in RPM across player-seasons. We also employ a two-stage least square (2-SLS) method for robustness check. Both empirical approaches address potential endogeneity in the relationship of interest. We find strong evidence that RPM is related to on-court teammate quality. Despite adjusting for teammate and opponent quality, RPM does not control for complementarity effects. As such, RPM is not suited for out-of-sample prediction."

A significant element of resource handling is power regulation. With increasing requirement of wireless data transmission services, it is essential to devise energy harvesting techniques for mobile devices. In this research, a new methodology has been proposed for distributed power regulation in cognitive radio, networks of CR are grounded on non-cooperation game phenomenon and pricing technique. QoS (Quality of service) of the user of CR is anticipated as a beneficial activity through pricing as well as dissemination of energy generating as an unbeneficial game wherein the consumers increase their overall efficacy. The price is defined as an actual function of transmission power to upraise the pricing of the most distant consumers. The proposed mathematical model shows that the proposed game model has a Nash equilibrium and is also unique. Furthermore, in order to make the proposed algorithm valid for green communication within the wireless network, the best response technique was proposed. Finally, simulation results showed that the proposed energy harvesting technique, grounded on a unique function of the utilization, reduces the consumption of transmission power and greatly improves the convergence speed; which are suitable for the vision of the 5G networks."
https://openalex.org/W3081103573,"Chinese hamster ovary cells have been the workhorse for the production of recombinant proteins in mammalian cells. Since biochemical, cellular and omics studies are usually affected by the lack of suitable fractionation procedures to isolate compartments from these cells, differential and isopycnic centrifugation based techniques were characterized and developed specially for them. Enriched fractions in intact nuclei, mitochondria, peroxisomes, cis-Golgi, trans-Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) were obtained in differential centrifugation steps and subsequently separated in discontinuous sucrose gradients. Nuclei, mitochondria, cis-Golgi, peroxisomes and smooth ER fractions were obtained as defined bands in 30–60% gradients. Despite the low percentage represented by the microsomes of the total cell homogenate (1.7%), their separation in a novel sucrose gradient (10–60%) showed enough resolution and efficiency to quantitatively separate their components into enriched fractions in trans-Golgi, cis-Golgi and ER. The identity of these organelles belonging to the classical secretion pathway that came from 10–60% gradients was confirmed by proteomics. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD019778. Components from ER and plasma membrane were the most frequent contaminants in almost all obtained fractions. The improved sucrose gradient for microsomal samples proved being successful in obtaining enriched fractions of low abundance organelles, such as Golgi apparatus and ER components, for biochemical and molecular studies, and suitable for proteomic research, which makes it a useful tool for future studies of this and other mammalian cell lines."
https://openalex.org/W3080283726,"Adipocyte browning appears to be a potential therapeutic strategy to combat obesity and related metabolic disorders. Recent studies have shown that apelin, an adipokine, stimulates adipocyte browning and has negative cross-talk with angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1 receptor) signaling. Here, we report that losartan, a selective AT1 receptor antagonist, induces browning, as evidenced by an increase in browning marker expression, mitochondrial biogenesis, and oxygen consumption in murine adipocytes. In parallel, losartan up-regulated apelin expression, concomitant with increased phosphorylation of protein kinase B and AMP-activated protein kinase. However, the siRNA-mediated knockdown of apelin expression attenuated losartan-induced browning. Angiotensin II cotreatment also inhibited losartan-induced browning, suggesting that AT1 receptor antagonism-induced activation of apelin signaling may be responsible for adipocyte browning induced by losartan. The in vivo browning effects of losartan were confirmed using both C57BL/6J and ob/ob mice. Furthermore, in vivo apelin knockdown by adeno-associated virus carrying-apelin shRNA significantly inhibited losartan-induced adipocyte browning. In summary, these data suggested that AT1 receptor antagonism by losartan promotes the browning of white adipocytes via the induction of apelin expression. Therefore, apelin modulation may be an effective strategy for the treatment of obesity and its related metabolic disorders."

Currently, only one full-length genomic sequence (the prototype strain) has been deposited in the GenBank database. In this study, three EV-B93 were identified, including one from an acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) patient (named 99052/XZ/CHN/1999, hereafter XZ99052) and two from healthy children (named 99096/XZ/CHN/1999 and 99167/XZ/CHN/1999, hereafter XZ99096 and XZ99167, respectively) from Tibet in 1999 during the polio eradication program. The identity between the nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the Tibet EV-B93 strain and the EV-B93 prototype strain is 83.2%-83.4% and 96.8%-96.9%, respectively. The Tibet EV-B93 strain was found to have greater nucleotide sequence identity in the P3 region to another enterovirus EV-B107 as per a phylogenetic tree analysis, which revealed that recombination occurred. Seroepidemiology data showed that EV-B93 has not produced an epidemic in Tibet and there may be susceptible individuals. The three Tibet EV-B93 strains are temperature-resistant with prognosticative virulence, suggesting the possibility of a potential large-scale outbreak of EV-B93. The analyzed EV-B93 strains enrich our knowledge about this serotype and provide valuable information on global EV-B93 molecular epidemiology. What is more, they permit the appraisal of the serotype's potential public health impact and aid in understanding the role of recombination events in the evolution of enteroviruses."
https://openalex.org/W3080584470,"Background Psoriasis is associated with hyperlipidemia. Few studies have examined the association among psoriasis, hyperlipidemia, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). It remains a topic of debate whether statin treatment for hyperlipidemia prevents the development of CKD in patients with psoriasis. Objective We investigated whether there is an association among psoriasis, hyperlipidemia and CKD. If so, we asked whether statin treatment for hyperlipidemia reduces the risk of CKD in patients with psoriasis. Methods A Taiwan nationwide population-based cohort study between 1997 and 2010 included 2,912 patients with psoriasis and 8,736 matched patients without psoriasis (1:3 propensity score matched according to age, sex, and region); 104,609 patients without psoriasis but with hyperlipidemia and 104,609 matched patients without psoriasis or hyperlipidemia (1:1). The hazard ratios, relative risks, and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using Cox proportional hazards model. Results Psoriasis significantly increased the risk of CKD (adjusted hazard ratio 2.48, 95% confidence interval 1.81–3.40), and so did hyperlipidemia (adjusted hazard ratio 2.93, 95% confidence interval 2.79–3.08). Compared to treatment without statins, statin treatment for hyperlipidemia reduced the risk of CKD in patients with psoriasis (adjusted relative risk 0.58, 95% confidence interval 0.55–0.62). Conclusion As well as hyperlipidemia, psoriasis significantly increased the risk of CKD. Statin treatment for hyperlipidemia reduced the risk of CKD in patients with psoriasis."

https://openalex.org/W3081434498,"Purpose Viral upper respiratory infections are associated with significant health and economic impact. This study sought to determine the efficacy of routine immune system micronutrient supplementation on the incidence, duration and severity of common cold symptoms. Methods This pilot study was a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of N = 259 with asymptomatic participants aged 18 to 65 in two cold seasons of 2016 and 2017. The treatment group received an immune system targeted micronutrient caplet, while the placebo group received a micronized cellulose caplet externally identical to the treatment caplet. Weekly surveys were sent electronically to participants to document common cold incidence, duration and severity. Primary statistical results were obtained using mixed-effects logistic regressions to account for longitudinal measurements for participants. Results The odds of acquiring an upper respiratory infection, adjusted for potential confounders, was estimated to be 0.74 times lower in the treatment group (p = 0.14). The odds of reporting specific symptoms were statistically lower in the treatment arm compared to the placebo arm for runny nose (OR = 0.53, p = 0.01) and cough (OR = 0.51, p = 0.04). Shorter durations of runny nose and cough were also observed in the treatment arm compared to placebo (both p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in severity of symptoms in either group. The observed proportion of reported cold symptoms in the treatment group was lower compared to the placebo group between late January and February in two consecutive cold seasons. Given the physical, workplace and economic impact of upper respiratory infections, this low cost and low risk intervention should be further studied with more robust investigation and meticulous experimental design."
https://openalex.org/W3080351483,"Implantation of bone marrow-derived cells (BMCs) into mouse hearts post-myocardial infarction (MI) limits cardiac functional decline. However, clinical trials of post-MI BMC therapy have yielded conflicting results. While most laboratory experiments use healthy BMC donor mice, clinical trials use post-MI autologous BMCs. Post-MI mouse BMCs are therapeutically impaired, due to inflammatory changes in BMC composition. Thus, therapeutic efficacy of the BMCs progressively worsens after MI but recovers as donor inflammatory response resolves. The availability of post-MI patient BM mononuclear cells (MNCs) from the TIME and LateTIME clinical trials enabled us to test if human post-MI MNCs undergo a similar period of impaired efficacy. We hypothesized that MNCs from TIME trial patients would be less therapeutic than healthy human donor MNCs when implanted into post-MI mouse hearts, and that therapeutic properties would be restored in MNCs from LateTIME trial patients. Post-MI SCID mice received MNCs from healthy donors, TIME patients, or LateTIME patients. Cardiac function improved considerably in the healthy donor group, but neither the TIME nor LateTIME group showed therapeutic effect. Conclusion: post-MI human MNCs lack therapeutic benefits possessed by healthy MNCs, which may partially explain why BMC clinical trials have been less successful than mouse studies."
https://openalex.org/W3080911220,"The morphology and physiology of diaspores play crucial roles in determining the fate of seeds in unpredictable habitats. In some genera of the Brassicaceae different types of diaspores can be found. Lepidium appelianum produces non-dormant seeds within indehiscent fruits while in L. campestre dormant seeds are released from dehiscent fruits. We investigated whether the allocation of relevant defence compounds into different tissues in different Lepidium species may be related to the diverse dispersal strategy (indehiscent and dehiscent) and seed physiology (non-dormant and dormant). Total glucosinolate concentration and composition were analysed in immature and mature seeds and pericarps of L. appelianum and L. campestre using high-performance liquid chromatography. Moreover, for comparison, transgenic RNAi L. campestre lines were used that produce indehiscent fruits due to silencing of LcINDEHISCENCE, the INDEHISCENCE ortholog of L. campestre. Total glucosinolate concentrations were lower in immature compared to mature seeds in all studied Lepidium species and transgenic lines. In contrast, indehiscent fruits of L. appelianum maintained their total glucosinolate concentration in mature pericarps compared to immature ones, while in dehiscent L. campestre and in indehiscent RNAi-LcIND L. campestre a significant decrease in total glucosinolate concentrations from immature to mature pericarps could be detected. Indole glucosinolates were detected in lower abundance than the other glucosinolate classes (aliphatic and aromatic). Relatively high concentrations of 4-methoxyindol-3-ylmethyl glucosinolate were found in mature seeds of L. appelianum compared to other tissues, while no indole glucosinolates were detected in mature diaspores of L. campestre. The diaspores of the latter species may rather depend on aliphatic and aromatic glucosinolates for long-term protection. The allocation patterns of glucosinolates correlate with the morpho-physiologically distinct fruits of L. appelianum and L. campestre and may be explained by the distinct dispersal strategies and the dormancy status of both species."
https://openalex.org/W3080504755,"Introduction HIV is a highly diverse virus with significant genetic variability which may confer biologic differences that could impact on treatment outcomes. Materials and methods We studied the association between HIV subtypes and immunologic and virologic outcomes in a longitudinal cohort of 169 patients on combination antiretroviral therapy. Participants were followed up for 5 years. Demographic data, CD4 cell count and viral loads (VL) were extracted from medical records. Whole protease gene and codon 1–300 of the reverse transcriptase gene were sequenced and analysed. Results Sixty-four percent of participants were females with a median age of 35 years. Twelve different subtypes were observed, the commonest being CRF 02_AG (55.0%) and subtypes G (23.1%). All subtypes showed steady rise in CD4 count and there was no difference in proportion who achieved CD4+ cell count rise of ≥100 cells/μL from baseline within 12 months’ post-initiation of ART, or ≥350 cells/μL at 60 months’ post-initiation. Median time to attaining a rise of ≥350 cells/μL was 24 months (6–48 months). The proportion that achieved undetectable VL at month 6 and 12 post-initiation of ART were comparable across subtypes. At end of 5th year, there was no statistical difference in proportion with virologic failure. Conclusion No association between HIV subtypes and immunologic or virologic response to therapy was observed, suggesting that current first-line ART may have similar efficacy across subtype predominating in South-West Nigeria."

https://openalex.org/W3081191451,"The Solanum tuberosum plant specific insert (StPSI) has a defensive role in potato plants, with the requirements of acidic pH and anionic lipids. The StPSI contains a set of three highly conserved disulfide bonds that bridge the protein’s helical domains. Removal of these bonds leads to enhanced membrane interactions. This work examined the effects of their sequential removal, both individually and in combination, using all-atom molecular dynamics to elucidate the role of disulfide linkages in maintaining overall protein tertiary structure. The tertiary structure was found to remain stable at both acidic (active) and neutral (inactive) pH despite the removal of disulfide linkages. The findings include how the dimer structure is stabilized and the impact on secondary structure on a residue-basis as a function of disulfide bond removal. The StPSI possesses an extensive network of inter-monomer hydrophobic interactions and intra-monomer hydrogen bonds, which is likely the key to the stability of the StPSI by stabilizing local secondary structure and the tertiary saposin-fold, leading to a robust association between monomers, regardless of the disulfide bond state. Removal of disulfide bonds did not significantly impact secondary structure, nor lead to quaternary structural changes. Instead, disulfide bond removal induces regions of amino acids with relatively higher or lower variation in secondary structure, relative to when all the disulfide bonds are intact. Although disulfide bonds are not required to preserve overall secondary structure, they may have an important role in maintaining a less plastic structure within plant cells in order to regulate membrane affinity or targeting."

However, the molecular basis underlying their differences remains largely unknown. In this study, we analyzed the genetic divergences between the transcriptomes of MED and TV. In total, 2,944 pairs of orthologous genes were identified. The average identity of amino acid sequences between the two species is 93.6%. The average nonsynonymous (Ka) and synonymous (Ks) substitution rates and the ratio of Ka/Ks of the orthologous genes are 0.0389, 2.23 and 0.0204, respectively. The low average Ka/Ks ratio indicates that orthologous genes tend to be under strong purified selection. The most divergent gene classes are related to the metabolisms of xenobiotics, cofactors, vitamins and amino acids, and this divergence may underlie the different biological characteristics between the two species of whiteflies. Genes of differential expression between the two species are enriched in carbohydrate metabolism and regulation of autophagy. These findings provide molecular clues to uncover the biological and molecular differences between the two species of whiteflies."
