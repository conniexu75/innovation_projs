https://openalex.org/W3114432452,"When two is better than four Batteries based on the reaction of zinc and oxygen have been used for more than a century, but these have been primary (that is, nonrechargeable) cells. These batteries use an alkaline electrolyte and require a four-electron reduction of oxygen to water, which is a slow process. Sun et al. show that with the right choice of nonalkaline electrolyte, the battery can operate using a two-electron zinc-oxygen/zinc peroxide chemistry that is far more reversible. By making the electrolyte hydrophobic, water is excluded from the near surface of the cathode, thus preventing the four-electron reduction. These batteries also show higher energy density and better cycling stability. Science , this issue p. 46"

However, because of the thinness of the membranes and their internal variability, it has been hard to determine which aspects of the membranes most affect their performance. Culp et al. combined electron tomography, nanoscale three-dimensional (3D) polyamide density mapping, and modeling of bulk water permeability with zero adjustable parameters to quantify the effect of 3D nanoscale variations in polymer mass on water transport within the polyamide membrane (see the Perspective by Geise). They found that variability in local density most affects the performance of the membranes. Better synthesis methods could thus improve performance without affecting selectivity.

Applying relatively large amounts of strain to diamond may shift its electronic properties, which is of interest for a number of applications. Dang et al. elastically stretched micrometer-sized plates of diamond along different crystallographic directions. These relatively large samples show that deep-strain engineering can be accomplished in more uniform diamond specimens and may have a large impact on the electronic properties.

Bertolini et al. used a ribosome-profiling approach to explore the existence of a cotranslational assembly mode based on the interaction of two nascent polypeptides, which they call the “co-co” assembly. Proteome-wide data were used to show whether, when, and how efficiently nascent complex subunits interact. The findings also show that human cells use co-co assembly to produce hundreds of different homo-oligomers. Co-co assembly involving ribosomes translating one messenger RNA may resolve the longstanding question of how cells prevent unwanted interactions between different protein isoforms to efficiently produce functional homo-oligomers.

https://openalex.org/W3117945779,"Metamorphic proteins switch between different folds, defying the protein folding paradigm. It is unclear how fold switching arises during evolution. With ancestral reconstruction and nuclear magnetic resonance, we studied the evolution of the metamorphic human protein XCL1, which has two distinct folds with different functions, making it an unusual member of the chemokine family, whose members generally adopt one conserved fold. XCL1 evolved from an ancestor with the chemokine fold. Evolution of a dimer interface, changes in structural constraints and molecular strain, and alteration of intramolecular protein contacts drove the evolution of metamorphosis. Then, XCL1 likely evolved to preferentially populate the noncanonical fold before reaching its modern-day near-equal population of folds. These discoveries illuminate how one sequence has evolved to encode multiple structures, revealing principles for protein design and engineering."
https://openalex.org/W3114891200,"Tissue homeostasis is perturbed in a diversity of inflammatory pathologies. These changes can elicit endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, protein misfolding, and cell death. ER stress triggers the unfolded protein response (UPR), which can promote recovery of ER proteostasis and cell survival or trigger programmed cell death. Here, we leveraged single-cell RNA sequencing to define dynamic transcriptional states associated with the adaptive versus terminal UPR in the mouse intestinal epithelium. We integrated these transcriptional programs with genome-scale CRISPR screening to dissect the UPR pathway functionally. We identified QRICH1 as a key effector of the PERK-eIF2α axis of the UPR. QRICH1 controlled a transcriptional program associated with translation and secretory networks that were specifically up-regulated in inflammatory pathologies. Thus, QRICH1 dictates cell fate in response to pathological ER stress."

https://openalex.org/W3113400036,"Neuroendocrine (NE) cells are epithelial cells that possess many of the characteristics of neurons, including the presence of secretory vesicles and the ability to sense environmental stimuli. The normal physiologic functions of solitary airway NE cells remain a mystery. We show that mouse and human airway basal stem cells sense hypoxia. Hypoxia triggers the direct differentiation of these stem cells into solitary NE cells. Ablation of these solitary NE cells during hypoxia results in increased epithelial injury, whereas the administration of the NE cell peptide CGRP rescues this excess damage. Thus, we identify stem cells that directly sense hypoxia and respond by differentiating into solitary NE cells that secrete a protective peptide that mitigates hypoxic injury."

https://openalex.org/W3117470911,"Shake, rattle, and help each other along In classical statistical mechanics, the deterministic dynamics of a many-body system are replaced by a probabilistic description. Chvykov et al. work toward a similar description for the nonequilibrium self-organization of collectives of active particles. In these systems, continuously input energy drives localized fluctuations, but larger-scale ordering can emerge, such as in the flight of a flock of birds. A key concept in their theory is the importance of rattling, whereby ordered patterns emerge through local collisions between neighbors at specific frequencies. The authors demonstrate this behavior using a set of flapping robots and produce related simulations of the robot behavior. Science , this issue p. 90"

https://openalex.org/W3119667860,"There have been many studies attempting to disentangle the relation between motivation and mental fatigue. Mental fatigue occurs after performing a demanding task for a prolonged time, and many studies have suggested that motivation can counteract the negative effects of mental fatigue on task performance. To complicate matters, most mental fatigue studies looked exclusively at the effects of extrinsic motivation but not intrinsic motivation. Individuals are said to be extrinsically motivated when they perform a task to attain rewards and avoid punishments, while they are said to be intrinsically motivated when they do for the pleasure of doing the activity. To assess whether intrinsic motivation has similar effects as extrinsic motivation, we conducted an experiment using subjective, performance, and physiological measures (heart rate variability and pupillometry). In this experiment, 28 participants solved Sudoku puzzles on a computer for three hours, with a cat video playing in the corner of the screen. The experiment consisted of 14 blocks with two alternating conditions: low intrinsic motivation and high intrinsic motivation. The main results showed that irrespective of condition, participants reported becoming fatigued over time. They performed better, invested more mental effort physiologically, and were less distracted in high-level than in low-level motivation blocks. The results suggest that similarly to extrinsic motivation, time-on-task effects are modulated by the level of intrinsic motivation: With high intrinsic motivation, people can maintain their performance over time as they seem willing to invest more effort as time progresses than in low intrinsic motivation."
https://openalex.org/W3118183045,"Cloud-aerosol interactions remain a major obstacle to understanding climate and severe weather. Observations suggest that aerosols enhance tropical thunderstorm activity; past research, motivated by the importance of understanding aerosol impacts on clouds, has proposed several mechanisms that could explain that observed link. Here, we show that high-resolution atmospheric simulations can reproduce the observed link between aerosols and convection. However, we also show that previously proposed mechanisms are unable to explain the invigoration. Examining underlying processes reveals that, in our simulations, high aerosol concentrations increase environmental humidity by producing clouds that mix more condensed water into the surrounding air. In turn, higher humidity favors large-scale ascent and stronger convection. Our results provide a physical reason to expect invigorated thunderstorms in high-aerosol regions of the tropics."
https://openalex.org/W3118283755,"In the present study, records on 115,291 heifers distributed in 113 herds were used to investigate the association between age at the first calving ( AFC ) and lactation performance, lactation curve, the length of the first calving interval ( CI ), calf birth weight ( CBW ), and the incidence of dystocia in Holstein heifers in Iran. Based on the AFC, the heifers were classified into eight classes: AFC of 541 to 690 d, 691 to 720 d, 721 to 750 d, 751 to 780 d, 781 to 810 d, 811 to 840 d, 841 to 900 d, and 901 to 1200 d (AFC1 to AFC8, respectively). Multiple regression mixed models were used to investigate the association between AFC and lactation curve parameters, partial and 305-d lactation performance, 100- and 305-d SCS, and the length of the first calving (CI) interval. The mean (SD) and median AFC across all heifers was 760.2 (74.01) and 750 d, respectively. Of 115,291 heifers included, 28,192 and 7,602 heifers were, respectively, ≤ 720 and &gt; 900 d when calving for the first time. More than 44% of the heifers were at 691 to 750 d (23 to 25 months) of age when calving for the first time. An increased AFC was associated with increased partial and 305-d lactation performance, 100- and 305-d SCS, initial milk yield, milk production at the peak of lactation, upward and downward slopes of the lactation curve. The 305-d fat percentage was associated with AFC; however, there was no association between AFC and 305-d protein percentage. An increased AFC was also associated with decreased milk production persistency, delayed peak time, longer CI, and higher calf birth weight. Compared to heifers calving for the first time between 691 to 780 d (23 to 26 months) of age, both increasing and decreasing AFC were associated with increased risk of dystocia. Controlling AFC is an important management factor in achieving a lower risk of dystocia, higher lactation performance, lower SCS, and shorter length of the calving interval."
https://openalex.org/W3120156514,"Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a severe form of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) that is responsible for a growing fraction of cirrhosis and liver cancer cases worldwide. Changes in the gut microbiome have been implicated in NASH pathogenesis, but the lack of suitable murine models has been a barrier to progress. We have therefore characterized the microbiome in a well-validated murine NASH model to establish its value in modeling human disease.The composition of intestinal microbiota was monitored in mice on a 12- or 24-week NASH protocol consisting of high fat, high sugar Western Diet (WD) plus once weekly i.p injection of low-dose CCl4. Additional mice were subjected to WD-only or CCl4-only conditions to assess the independent effect of these variables on the microbiome.There was substantial remodeling of the intestinal microbiome in NASH mice, characterized by declines in both species diversity and bacterial abundance. Based on changes to beta diversity, microbiota from NASH mice clustered separately from controls in principal coordinate analyses. A comparison between WD-only and CCl4-only controls with the NASH model identified WD as the primary driver of early changes to the microbiome, resulting in loss of diversity within the 1st week. A NASH signature emerged progressively at weeks 6 and 12, including, most notably, a reproducible bloom of the Firmicute order Erysipelotrichales.We have established a valuable model to study the role of gut microbes in NASH, enabling us to identify a new NASH gut microbiome signature."
https://openalex.org/W3120947223,"In some patients, migraine attacks are associated with symptoms of allodynia which can be localized (cephalic) or generalized (extracephalic). Using functional neuroimaging and cutaneous thermal stimulation, we aimed to investigate the differences in brain activation of patients with episodic migraine (n = 19) based on their allodynic status defined by changes between ictal and interictal pain tolerance threshold for each subject at the time of imaging. In this prospective imaging study, differences were found in brain activity between the ictal and interictal visits in the brainstem/pons, thalamus, insula, cerebellum and cingulate cortex. Significant differences were also observed in the pattern of activation along the trigeminal pathway to noxious heat stimuli in no allodynia vs. generalized allodynia in the thalamus and the trigeminal nucleus but there were no activation differences in the trigeminal ganglion. The functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) findings provide direct evidence for the view that in migraine patients who are allodynic during the ictal phase of their attacks, the spinal trigeminal nucleus and posterior thalamus become hyper-responsive (sensitized)–to the extent that they mediate cephalic and extracephalic allodynia, respectively. In addition, descending analgesic systems seem as “switched off” in generalized allodynia."
https://openalex.org/W3118361364,"The research aims to provide new empirical evidence by testing the impact of the external shocks namely: oil prices and the U.S interest rate on Turkey’s real estate market by using three techniques of co-integration tests namely: the newly developed bootstrap autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) testing approach as proposed by (McNown et al. 2018), the new approach involving the Bayer-Hanck (2013) combined co-integration test, Hatemi-J (2008) co-integration testing approach. The ARDL model is utilized to explore the relationship between the variables. The findings show that the oil prices have a positive impact on Turkey’s real estate market, the results confirm that there is a significant impact of oil prices on Turkey’s real estate market through the domestic interest rate. Furthermore, the results demonstrated that there is a significant spillover influence of the U.S. interest rates on Turkey’s real estate market through oil prices and domestic interest rates. This study suggests that the following factors led to increasing the sensitivity and volatility of the Turkish real estate market to oil prices and the U.S. interest rate fluctuations: the presence of economic interdependence between the USA and Turkey, and the majority of the external debts and the reserve currency in Turkey are composed in the USD, and Turkey’s oil imports hit record high in last years. Finally, this article suggests that policymakers in Turkey should pay close attention to the effects of external shocks namely the oil prices and U.S. interest rates on Turkish markets to maintain economic and financial stability."
https://openalex.org/W3119252947,"Although 2D cell cultures are commonly used to predict therapy response, it has become clear that 3D cultures may better mimic the in vivo situation and offer the possibility of tailoring translational clinical approaches. Here, we compared the response of 2D and 3D colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines to irradiation and chemotherapy. Classic 2D cultures and 3D spheroids of CRC cell lines (CaCo2, Colo205, HCT116, SW480) were thoroughly established, then irradiated with doses of 1, 4, or 10 Gy, using a clinical-grade linear accelerator. The response was assessed by immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, and TUNEL assays. Upon irradiation, CRC 3D spheroids were morphologically altered. After irradiation with 10 Gy, annexin V/PI staining revealed a 1.8- to 4-fold increase in the apoptosis rate in the 2D cell cultures (95% CI 3.24±0.96), and a 1.5- to 2.4-fold increase in the 3D spheroids (95% CI 1.56±0.41). Irradiation with 1 Gy caused 3- and 4-fold increases in TUNEL positive cells in the CaCo2 and HCT116 (p = 0.01) 2D cultures, respectively, compared with a 2-fold increase in the 3D spheroids. Furthermore, the 2D and 3D cultures responded differently to chemotherapy; the 3D cultures were more resistant to 5-FU and cisplatin, but not to doxorubicin and mitomycin C, than the 2D cultures. Taken together, CRC cells cultured as 3D spheroids displayed markedly higher resistance to irradiation therapy and selected chemotherapeutic drugs than 2D cultures. This in vitro difference must be considered in future approaches for determining the ideal in vitro systems that mimic human disease."
https://openalex.org/W3120968875,"Graphene reportedly exerts positive effects on plant root growth and development, although the corresponding molecular response mechanism remains to be elucidated. Maize seeds were randomly divided into a control and experimental group, and the roots of Zea mays L. seedlings were watered with different concentrations (0–100 mg/L) of graphene to explore the effects and molecular mechanism of graphene on the growth and development of Z . mays L. Upon evaluating root growth indices, 50 mg/L graphene remarkably increased total root length, root volume, and the number of root tips and forks of maize seedlings compared to those of the control group. We observed that the contents of nitrogen and potassium in rhizosphere soil increased following the 50 mg/L graphene treatment. Thereafter, we compared the transcriptome changes in Z . mays roots in response to the 50 mg/L graphene treatment. Transcriptional factor regulation, plant hormone signal transduction, nitrogen and potassium metabolism, as well as secondary metabolism in maize roots subjected to graphene treatment, exhibited significantly upregulated expression, all of which could be related to mechanisms underlying the response to graphene. Based on qPCR validations, we proposed several candidate genes that might have been affected with the graphene treatment of maize roots. The transcriptional profiles presented here provide a foundation for deciphering the mechanism underlying graphene and maize root interaction."

https://openalex.org/W3119485784,"Canine leishmaniasis (CanL) is a zoonotic parasitic disease caused by Leishmania infantum in the Mediterranean area and transmitted by phlebotomine sand fly vectors. The domestic dog is the main reservoir host. The aim of this study was to assess the influence of different individual, environmental and spatial risk factors on the dog exposure to L . infantum and to estimate the seroprevalence among owned and kennel dogs, in the Lazio region (central Italy), where canine leishmaniasis is endemic. In the period 2010–2014, 13,292 sera from kennel and owned dogs were collected by official and private veterinarians. The presence of anti- Leishmania IgG was analysed by indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT), using a 1:80 titre cut-off. At the univariable analysis, CanL seropositivity was associated with sex, size, breed, coat length, living with other dogs and forest/semi-natural land cover. At the multivariable analysis, age, ownership and attitude were confirmed as risk factors, being more than 2 years old, owned, and hunting dogs at higher risk. Being a Maremma sheepdog was a protective factor. A true overall seroprevalence of 6.7% (95% CI: 6.2–7.2) was estimated in the whole population while 7.3% (95% CI: 6.8–7.8) was estimated in kennel dogs and 74.3% (95% CI: 70.8–77.6) in owned dogs. The role of kennels as a key component for CanL active and passive surveillance was also highlighted. This study confirmed the endemicity of CanL in the Lazio region and focused some factors that can influence the seropositivity of dogs in a Mediterranean region."
https://openalex.org/W3118833847,"In this paper, entropy, coupling coordination degree, spatial auto-analysis, LISA time path, and other methods have been used to analyze the coupling coordination degree of urban resilience and urbanization quality of 14 cities in Liaoning Province from 2009 to 2019. The results show that: 1. The number of highly resilient cities accounts for 14.3% of the total number of cities in Liaoning Province, and the overall resilience degree is low; the spatial distribution shrinks along the Shenyang–Dalian Economic Belt toward both sides, with obvious “core-margin” characteristics. 2. The average score of urbanization quality increased from 0.0574 to 0.0966, showing a fluctuating upward trend; the regional difference was significant, and the “dual-core” characteristic was prominent. 3. During the study period, the 14 cities of Liaoning Province were in a state of imbalance, and there was a positive correlation between the coupling degree and the coordination degree. Moran’s I decreased from 0.237 to 0.220 and the spatial agglomeration characteristics also weakened. Further analysis of the spatial and temporal linkage characteristics of the coupling relationship shows that the relative length of LISA time path presents characteristics of protrusion in the central region and shrinkage on the East and West sides, and the curvature presents characteristics that are smaller in the North and larger in the South."
https://openalex.org/W3118912378,"The Tapanuli Orangutan ( Pongo tapanuliensis ) is the most threatened great ape species in the world. It is restricted to an area of about 1,000 km 2 of upland forest where fewer than 800 animals survive in three declining subpopulations. Through a historical ecology approach involving analysis of newspaper, journals, books and museum records from the early 1800s to 2009, we demonstrate that historically Pongo tapanuliensis inhabited a much larger area, and occurred across a much wider range of habitat types and at lower elevations than now. Its current Extent of Occurrence is 2.5% and 5.0% of the historical range in the 1890s and 1940s respectively. A combination of historical fragmentation of forest habitats, mostly for small-scale agriculture, and unsustainable hunting likely drove various populations to the south, east and west of the current population to extinction. This happened prior to the industrial-scale forest conversion that started in the 1970s. Our findings indicate how sensitive P . tapanuliensis is to the combined effects of habitat fragmentation and unsustainable take-off rates. Saving this species will require prevention of any further fragmentation and killings or other removal of animals from the remaining population. Without concerted action to achieve this, the remaining populations of P . tapanuliensis are doomed to become extinct within several orangutan generations."
https://openalex.org/W3119937636,"Foraminifera are a group of mostly marine protists with high taxonomic diversity. Species identification is often complex, as both morphological and molecular approaches can be challenging due to a lack of unique characters and reference sequences. An integrative approach combining state of the art morphological and molecular tools is therefore promising. In this study, we analysed large benthic Foraminifera of the genus Amphisorus from Western Australia and Indonesia. Based on previous findings on high morphological variability observed in the Soritidae and the discontinuous distribution of Amphisorus along the coast of western Australia, we expected to find multiple morphologically and genetically unique Amphisorus types. In order to gain detailed insights into the diversity of Amphisorus , we applied micro CT scanning and shotgun metagenomic sequencing. We identified four distinct morphotypes of Amphisorus , two each in Australia and Indonesia, and showed that each morphotype is a distinct genotype. Furthermore, metagenomics revealed the presence of three dinoflagellate symbiont clades. The most common symbiont was Fugacium Fr5, and we could show that its genotypes were mostly specific to Amphisorus morphotypes. Finally, we assembled the microbial taxa associated with the two Western Australian morphotypes, and analysed their microbial community composition. Even though each Amphisorus morphotype harboured distinct bacterial communities, sampling location had a stronger influence on bacterial community composition, and we infer that the prokaryotic community is primarily shaped by the microhabitat rather than host identity. The integrated approach combining analyses of host morphology and genetics, dinoflagellate symbionts, and associated microbes leads to the conclusion that we identified distinct, yet undescribed taxa of Amphisorus . We argue that the combination of morphological and molecular methods provides unprecedented insights into the diversity of foraminifera, which paves the way for a deeper understanding of their biodiversity, and facilitates future taxonomic and ecological work."
https://openalex.org/W3119036229,"Several gene expression studies have been previously conducted to characterize molecular basis of Wooden Breast myopathy in commercial broiler chickens. These studies have generally used a limited sample size and relied on a binary disease outcome (unaffected or affected by Wooden Breast), which are appropriate for an initial investigation. However, to identify biomarkers of disease severity and development, it is necessary to use a large number of samples with a varying degree of disease severity. Therefore, in this study, we assayed a relatively large number of samples (n = 96) harvested from the pectoralis major muscle of unaffected (U), partially affected (P) and markedly affected (A) chickens. Gene expression analysis was conducted using the nCounter MAX Analysis System and data were analyzed using four different supervised machine-learning methods, including support vector machines (SVM), random forests (RF), elastic net logistic regression (ENET) and Lasso logistic regression (LASSO). The SVM method achieved the highest prediction accuracy for both three-class (U, P and A) and two-class (U and P+A) classifications with 94% prediction accuracy for two-class classification and 85% for three-class classification. The results also identified biomarkers of Wooden Breast severity and development. Additionally, gene expression analysis and ultrastructural evaluations provided evidence of vascular endothelial cell dysfunction in the early pathogenesis of Wooden Breast."
https://openalex.org/W3120479419,"The entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium acridum in oil-based formulations (Green Muscle ® (GM)) is a biopesticide for locust control lacking side-effects on biodiversity, unlike chemical insecticides. Under controlled conditions, GM-treated locusts and grasshoppers attract predators, a complementary advantage in locust control. We assessed avian predation on a population of desert locusts in northern Niger aerially sprayed operationally with GM with 107 g viable conidia ha -1 . Populations of adult locusts and birds and vegetation greenness were assessed simultaneously along two transects from 12 days before until 23 days after treatment. Common kestrels Falco tinnunculus and lanners F . biarmicus were the predominant avian predators. Regurgitated pellets and prey remains were collected daily beneath “plucking posts” of kestrels. Locusts started dying five days post-spray and GM had its maximum effect one-two weeks after the spray, with 80% efficacy at day 21. After spraying, bird numbers increased significantly ( P &lt;0.05) concurrent with decreasing desert locust densities. Locust numbers decreased significantly ( P &lt;0.001) with both time since spraying and decreasing greenness. Before spraying, kestrel food remains under plucking posts accounted for 34.3 ±13.4 prey items day -1 , of which 31.0 ±11.9 were adult desert locusts (90.3%), reducing post-spray to 21.1 ±7.3 prey items day -1 , of which19.5 ±6.7 were adult desert locusts (92.5%), attributable to decreased use of the plucking-posts by the kestrels rather than an effect of the spray. After spraying, kestrels took significantly ( P &lt;0.05) more larger female (75–80%) than smaller male (20–25%) locusts. Avian predation probably enhanced the impact of the GM on the desert locust population, especially by removing large adult females. No direct or indirect adverse side-effects were observed on non-target organisms including locust predators such as ants and birds. These substantial ecological advantages should also be considered when choosing between conventional chemical and biopesticide-based locust control."

https://openalex.org/W3119492906,"Background In Ghana, home delivery among women in urban areas is relatively low compared to rural areas. However, the few women who deliver at home in urban areas still face enormous risk of infections and death, just like those in rural areas. The present study investigated the factors associated with home delivery among women who live in urban areas in Ghana. Materials and methods Data for this study was obtained from the 2014 Ghana Demographic and Health Survey. We used data of 1,441 women who gave birth in the 5 years preceding the survey and were dwelling in urban areas. By the use of Stata version 14.2, we conducted both descriptive and multivariable logistic regression analyses. Results We found that 7.9% of women in urban areas in Ghana delivered at home. The study revealed that, compared to women who lived in the Northern region, women who lived in the Brong Ahafo region [AOR = 0.38, CI = 0.17–0.84] were less likely to deliver at home. The likelihood of home delivery was high among women in the poorest wealth quintile [AOR = 2.02, CI = 1.06–3.86], women who professed other religions [AOR = 3.45; CI = 1.53–7.81], and those who had no antenatal care visits [AOR = 7.17; 1.64–31.3]. Conversely, the likelihood of home delivery was lower among women who had attained secondary/higher education [AOR = 0.30; 0.17–0.53], compared to those with no formal education. Conclusion The study identified region of residence, wealth quintile, religion, antenatal care visits, and level of education as factors associated with home delivery among urban residents in Ghana. Therefore, health promotion programs targeted at home delivery need to focus on these factors. We also recommend that a qualitative study should be conducted to investigate the factors responsible for the differences in home delivery in terms of region, as the present study could not do so."
https://openalex.org/W3119977721,"Introduction Taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) have gained support as a policy response to adverse health effects associated with SSB consumption. On July 1, 2017, Oakland, California, implemented a one-cent/ounce tax on SSBs with ≥25 calories/12 fluid ounces. This study estimated the long-term impact of the tax on taxed and untaxed beverage prices. Methods Data on 5,830 taxed and 5,146 untaxed beverage prices were obtained from 99 stores in Oakland and 111 stores in Sacramento (comparison site), California, in late May-June 2017 and June 2019. Linear regression difference-in-differences models were computed with store and product fixed effects, with robust standard errors clustered on store, weighted based on volume sold by beverage sweetener status, type, and size. Results Taxed beverage prices increased by 0.73 cents/ounce (95% CI = 0.47,1.00) on average in supermarkets and grocery stores in Oakland relative to Sacramento and 0.74 cents/ounce (95% CI = 0.39,1.09) in pharmacies, but did not change in convenience stores (-0.09 cents/ounce, 95% CI = -0.56,0.39). Untaxed beverage prices overall increased by 0.40 cents/ounce (95% CI = 0.05,0.75) in pharmacies but did not change in other store types. Prices of taxed individual-size soda specifically increased in all store types, by 0.91–2.39 cents/ounce (p&lt;0.05), as did prices of untaxed individual-size soda in convenience stores (0.79 cents/ounce, 95% CI = 0.01,1.56) and pharmacies (1.66 cents/ounce, 95% CI = 0.09,3.23). Conclusions Two years following SSB tax implementation, there was partial tax pass-through with differences by store type and by beverage type and size within store type."

The purpose of this study was to evaluate variables, mainly surgery and hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy, associated with treatment outcomes in patients with a diagnosis of ARONJ at a single center. We enrolled consecutive patients who presented to our hospital for the management of stage 2 or 3 ARONJ between January 2003 and December 2019. The relationship between potentially predictive factors and outcome variables was examined using statistical analyses, along with a subgroup analysis based on disease stage. Of 252 patients included in this study, 206 had stage 2 ARONJ and 46 had stage 3 ARONJ. There were 119 patients with osteoporosis and 133 with malignant disease. In total, 139 patients were healed, and the healing rate of patients with stage 3 ARONJ was lower than that of patients with stage 2 ARONJ. With regard to the combination of surgery and HBO therapy, most patients underwent HBO before and after surgery. In the univariable analysis, surgery showed a therapeutic effect in both stage 2 and 3 ARONJ, whereas HBO showed a therapeutic effect in stage 2 ARONJ. In the multivariable analysis for stage 2 ARONJ, extensive surgery showed a stronger association with healing than conservative surgery, whereas ≥46 sessions of HBO therapy was less associated with healing than was non-HBO therapy. Our findings suggest that extensive surgery is highly effective against ARONJ regardless of disease stage if there is a sequestrum separation and systemic tolerance, whereas HBO therapy before and after surgical approach can be effective. Further studies are needed to identify treatment strategies for patients with treatment-refractory ARONJ who may be forced to undergo long-term HBO therapy with the expectation of sequestrum separation."

Therefore, we aimed to investigate the incidence rates and trends over time in the population of children and adolescents in one of the federal states of Germany, in Saxony. Methods Over the 10-year period 2000–2009 all 31 children’s hospitals and pediatric gastroenterologists, respectively in Saxony reported all IBD patients up to 15 years of age to the Saxon Pediatric IBD Registry. The completeness of the registry was estimated as 96.7% by independent surveys in the years 2005–2009. Incidence rates were presented as age-standardized incidence rates (ASR) regarding New European Standard Population 1990 per 100,000 person-years (PY) with 95% confidence intervals [CI]. Joinpoint and linear regression was used for trend analyses. Results 344 patients with confirmed IBD between 2000–2009 were included in the epidemiological evaluation: 212 (61.6%) patients with CD, 122 (35.6%) with UC and 10 (2.9%) with unclassified IBD (IBD-U). The ASR per 100,000 PY over the whole observation period was 7.2 [6.4–7.9] for IBD, 4.4 [3.8–5.0] for CD, 2.6 [2.1–3.0] for UC and 0.2 [0.1–0.3] for IBD-U. For IBD, the ASR per 100,000 PY increased from 4.6 [2.8–6.3] in 2000 to 10.5 [7.5–13.6] in 2009. The incidence trend analysis of ASRs using the joinpoint regression confirmed a significant increase of IBD as well as UC. The mean age at first diagnosis decreased significantly during the observation period from 11.5 (11.0–13.4) in 2000 to 9.6 (5.1–13.5) years in 2009. The median of the diagnostic latency among IBD patients was 3 months. Conclusion The incidence of IBD in children and adolescents in Saxony was slightly higher than the average of other countries in the same time period and followed the trend towards a general increase of IBD. The age at diagnosis was subject to a very unfavorable downward trend."
https://openalex.org/W3118505964,"Introduction Pneumonia of unknown cause was detected on 30 December 2019 in China. It was categorized as an outbreak and named as COVID-19 by the World Health Organization. The pandemic affects all people, but patient groups such as hemodialysis (HD) patients have been particularly affected. We do not know if refugees suffered more during the outbreak. In this study, we compared depressive symptom frequency between Syrian refugee HD patients and Turkish ones. Methods The study had a single-center, cross-sectional design. Demographic and clinical data were collected retrospectively from patients’ files containing details about past medical history, demographic variables and laboratory values. Validated Turkish and Arabic forms of Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) were used to assess depressive symptoms. BDI scores were compared according to nationality, demographic features and clinical data. A BDI score more than 14 was accepted as suspicion of depression. Results 119 patients were enrolled in the study. After the exclusion of 22 patients, 75 Turkish and 22 Syrian patients were included for further analysis. The median BDI (interquartile range) score for Turkish and Syrian patients were 12 (7–23) and 19.5 (12.7–25.2), respectively (p = 0.03). Suspicion of depression was present at 42.7% of Turkish, and 72.7% of Syrian HD patients (p = 0.013). Regarding all patients, phosphorus level, Kt/V, and nationality were significantly different between patients with and without suspicion of depression (p = 0.023, 0.039, 0.013, respectively). Conclusion Syrian patients had higher BDI scores and more depressive symptoms than Turkish patients. Additional national measures for better integration and more mental support to Syrian HD patients are needed."
https://openalex.org/W3119421254,"Background Despite an overall reduction in suicide, educational disparities in suicide have not decreased over the last decade. The mechanisms behind educational disparities in suicide, however, remain unclear: low educational status may increase the risk of suicide (“causation”) or low educational status and suicide may share confounders. This paper assesses whether educational disparities in suicide (EDS) are more likely to be due to causation. Method The DEMETRIQ study collected and harmonized register-based data on mortality follow-up from forty population censuses from twelve European populations. More than 102,000 suicides were registered over 392 million person-years. Three analyses were carried out. First, we applied an instrumental variable approach that exploits changes in the legislation on compulsory educational age to instrument educational status. Second, we analyzed EDS by age under the hypothesis that increasing EDS over the life cycle supports causation. Finally, we compared EDS in men and women under the assumption that greater EDS in women would support causation. Findings The instrumental variable analysis showed no evidence for causation between higher education and suicide, for men or women. The life-cycle analysis showed that the decrease of educational inequalities in suicide between the baseline 1991 period and the 2001 follow-up period was more pronounced and statistically significant in the first three younger age groups. The gender analysis indicated that EDS were systematic and greater in men than in women: the rate ratio of suicide for men with low level of education (RR = 2.51; 95%CI:2.44–2.58) was higher than the rate ratio in women (RR = 1.32; 95CI%:1.26–1.38). Interpretation Overall, there was little support for the causation hypothesis, suggesting that the association between education and suicide is confounded. Educational inequalities in suicide should be addressed in early life by early targeting of groups who struggle to complete their education and display higher risk of mental disorder or of mental health vulnerabilities."
https://openalex.org/W3120013074,"Dealing with traffic congestion is one of the most pressing challenges for cities. Transport authorities have implemented several strategies to reduce traffic jams with varying degrees of success. The use of reversible lanes is a common approach to improve traffic congestion during rush hours. A reversible lane can change its direction during a time interval to the more congested direction. This strategy can improve traffic congestion in specific scenarios. Most reversible lanes in urban roads are fixed in time and number; however, traffic patterns in cities are highly variable and unpredictable due to this phenomenon’s complex nature. Therefore, reversible lanes may not improve traffic flow under certain circumstances; moreover, they could worsen it because of traffic fluctuations. In this paper, we use cellular automata to model adaptive reversible lanes(aka dynamic reversible lanes). Adaptive reversible lanes can change their direction using real-time information to respond to traffic demand fluctuations. Using real traffic data, our model shows that adaptive reversible lanes can improve traffic flow up to 40% compared to conventional reversible lanes. Our results show that there are significant fluctuations in traffic flow even during rush hours, and thus cities would benefit from implementing adaptive reversible lanes."
https://openalex.org/W3120502159,"Prisoner’s dilemma game is the most commonly used model of spatial evolutionary game which is considered as a paradigm to portray competition among selfish individuals. In recent years, Win-Stay-Lose-Learn, a strategy updating rule base on aspiration, has been proved to be an effective model to promote cooperation in spatial prisoner’s dilemma game, which leads aspiration to receive lots of attention. In this paper, according to Expected Value Theory and Achievement Motivation Theory, we propose a dynamic aspiration model based on Win-Stay-Lose-Learn rule in which individual’s aspiration is inspired by its payoff. It is found that dynamic aspiration has a significant impact on the evolution process, and different initial aspirations lead to different results, which are called Stable Coexistence under Low Aspiration , Dependent Coexistence under Moderate aspiration and Defection Explosion under High Aspiration respectively. Furthermore, a deep analysis is performed on the local structures which cause defectors’ re-expansion, the concept of END- and EXP-periods are used to justify the mechanism of network reciprocity in view of time-evolution, typical feature nodes for defectors’ re-expansion called Infectors, Infected nodes and High-risk cooperators respectively are found. Compared to fixed aspiration model, dynamic aspiration introduces a more satisfactory explanation on population evolution laws and can promote deeper comprehension for the principle of prisoner’s dilemma."
https://openalex.org/W3118445770,"Neuropathic pain is a chronic debilitating condition caused by injury or disease of the nerves of the somatosensory system. Although several therapeutic approaches are recommended, none has emerged as an optimal treatment leaving a need for developing more effective therapies. Given the small number of approved drugs and their limited clinical efficacy, combining drugs with different mechanisms of action is frequently used to yield greater efficacy. We demonstrate that the combination of trazodone, a multifunctional drug for the treatment of major depressive disorders, and gabapentin, a GABA analogue approved for neuropathic pain relief, results in a synergistic antinociceptive effect in the mice writhing test. To explore the potential relevance of this finding in chronic neuropathic pain, pharmacodynamic interactions between low doses of trazodone (0.3 mg/kg) and gabapentin (3 mg/kg) were evaluated in the chronic constriction injury (CCI) rat model, measuring the effects of the two drugs both on evoked and spontaneous nociception and on general well being components. Two innate behaviors, burrowing and nest building, were used to assess these aspects. Besides exerting a significant antinociceptive effect on hyperalgesia and on spontaneous pain, combined inactive doses of trazodone and gabapentin restored in CCI rats innate behaviors that are strongly reduced or even abolished during persistent nociception, suggesting that the combination may have an impact also on pain components different from somatosensory perception. Our results support the development of a trazodone and gabapentin low doses combination product for optimal multimodal analgesia treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3120341889,"Introduction Individual’s early life style and health behaviors are directly linked to chronic non-communicable diseases. Considering the increased burden of NCDs during the last two decades, the aim of this study is to assess co-occurrence/clustering of lifestyle risk factors and its association with different socio-demographic and economic characteristics among adult men and women in India from 2005–2016. Methods This study utilized the data from the National Family Health Survey 2005–06 and 2015–16 survey rounds. Multinomial logistic regression is employed to evaluate co-occurrence of multiple risk factors among adult men and women of different socio-economic and demographic characteristics to identify the subgroups with elevated risk of clustering of multiple unhealthy lifestyle risk factors. Results More adult men in India tend to exhibit clustering of multiple non-communicable disease risk factors than females. Individuals between 30–49 years of age, residing in urban areas, the population with no education, separated couples and those from poor economic strata are the specific population subgroups show higher prevalence of co-occurrence of multiple risk factors. The regional pattern of clustering of risk factors shows that the prevalence of co-occurrence of multiple risk factors is higher among men and women from the North-Eastern part of India compared to the other regions of the country. Conclusion The prevalence of clustering of multiple risk factors associated with chronic NCDs is substantially high and has increased between 2005–06 to 2015–16. India may therefore experience a significant increase in the burden of chronic non-communicable diseases in the coming years. We therefore conclude that appropriate strategies should be implemented by policy makers and the government to reduce the overall health burden of NCDs due to lifestyle habits."
https://openalex.org/W3119779251,"This study provides regional-scale data on drivers of horseshoe crab ( Limulus polyphemus ) presence along the northcentral Gulf of Mexico coast and has implications for understanding habitat suitability for sparse horseshoe crab populations of conservation concern worldwide. To collect baseline data on the relationship between environmental factors and presence of horseshoe crabs, we surveyed four sites from the Fort Morgan peninsula of Mobile Bay, Alabama (AL) to Horn Island, Mississippi (MS). We documented number, size and sex of live animals, molts, and carcasses as metrics of horseshoe crab presence and demographics for two years. Data were compared to in situ and remotely sensed environmental attributes to assess environmental drivers of occurrence during the time of study. Overall, greater evidence of horseshoe crab presence was found at western sites (Petit Bois and Horn Islands) compared to eastern sites (Dauphin Island, Fort Morgan peninsula), mediated by a combination of distance from areas of high freshwater discharge and interannual variation in weather. Higher sex ratios also were found associated with higher occurrence, west of Mobile Bay. Land cover, particularly Bare Land and Estuarine Emergent Wetland classes that are common to western sites, was most predictive of live animal and to some extent carcass occurrence. Our findings suggest that small-scale variation in habitat quality can affect occurrence of horseshoe crabs in sparse populations where density is not a limiting factor. Data from molts and carcasses were informative to supplement live animal data and may be useful to enhance ecological assessment and support conservation and management in regions with sparse populations."
https://openalex.org/W3120997750,"Large amounts of effort have been invested in trying to understand how a single genome is able to specify the identity of hundreds of cell types. Inspired by some aspects of Caenorhabditis elegans biology, we implemented an in silico evolutionary strategy to produce gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that drive cell-specific gene expression patterns, mimicking the process of terminal cell differentiation. Dynamics of the gene regulatory networks are governed by a thermodynamic model of gene expression, which uses DNA sequences and transcription factor degenerate position weight matrixes as input. In a version of the model, we included chromatin accessibility. Experimentally, it has been determined that cell-specific and broadly expressed genes are regulated differently. In our in silico evolved GRNs, broadly expressed genes are regulated very redundantly and the architecture of their cis-regulatory modules is different, in accordance to what has been found in C . elegans and also in other systems. Finally, we found differences in topological positions in GRNs between these two classes of genes, which help to explain why broadly expressed genes are so resilient to mutations. Overall, our results offer an explanatory hypothesis on why broadly expressed genes are regulated so redundantly compared to cell-specific genes, which can be extrapolated to phenomena such as ChIP-seq HOT regions."
https://openalex.org/W3118795287,"The traditional approach to biomarker discovery for any pathology has been through hypothesis-based research one candidate at a time. The objective of this study was to develop an agnostic approach for the simultaneous screening of plasma for consistent molecular differences between a group of individuals exhibiting a pathology and a group of healthy individuals. To achieve this, we focused on developing a predictive tool based on plasma for the amount of brain amyloid-β deposition as observed in PET scans. The accumulation of brain amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques is a key risk factor for the development of Alzheimer’s disease. A contrast was established between cognitively normal individuals above the age of 70 that differed for the amount of brain amyloid-β observed in PET scans (INSIGHT study group). Positive selection was performed against a pool of plasma from individuals with high brain amyloid and negative selection against a pool of plasma from individuals with low brain amyloid This enriched, selected library was then applied to plasma samples from 11 individuals with high levels of brain amyloid and 11 individuals with low levels of brain Aβ accumulation. Each of these individually selected libraries was then characterized by next generation sequencing, and the relative frequency of 10,000 aptamer sequences that were observed in each selection was screened for ability to explain variation in brain amyloid using sparse partial least squares discriminant analysis. From this analysis a subset of 44 aptamers was defined, and the individual aptamers were synthesized. This subset was applied to plasma samples from 70 cognitively normal individuals all above the age of 70 that differed for brain amyloid deposition. 54 individuals were used as a training set, and 15 as a test set. Three of the 15 individuals in the test set were mis-classified resulting in an overall accuracy of 80% with 86% sensitivity and 75% specificity. The aptamers included in the subset serve directly as biomarkers, thus we have named them Aptamarkers. There are two potential applications of these results: extending the predictive capacity of these aptamers across a broader range of individuals, and/or using the individual aptamers to identify targets through covariance analysis and reverse omics approaches. We are currently expanding applications of the Aptamarker platform to other diseases and target matrices."

Germination was studied under controlled laboratory conditions. The seeds were subjected to KNO 3 , NH 4 NO 3 and NH 4 Cl in four doses (1, 10, 50 and 100 mM) and to distilled water. Final germination percentage, index of germination velocity and index of germination synchrony were determined. Content of nitrogen in the soil probed from the site of seeds collection was also analyzed. Significant effects of type of the nitrogen compounds and their concentrations were observed. High concentrations of nitrogen-containing salts inhibited completion of germination in almost all species. Helichrysum arenarium and Hypericum perforatum showed preference for NH 4 + over NO 3 ‒ , whereas Arnoseris minima , Alyssum montanum , Jasione montana and Spergula morisonii showed preference for NO 3 ‒ over NH 4 + . Centaurea scabiosa , C . stoebe and Hypochaeris radicata had no preference and wide tolerance to the type of nitrogen-containing compound. Echium vulgare showed differential response hard for interpretation. A . montanum and J . montana showed stenotopic behavior in terms of nitrogen-related conditions. It is proposed that nitrogen-rich soil gaps favor establishment of more nitro-tolerant plant species (e.g. C . scabiosa , C . stoebe and H . radicata ) as compared to nitrogen-poor ones."
https://openalex.org/W3119839364,"Background Job evaluation has been widely used to establish a foundation for internal equity and other human resource functions. The United Kingdom adopts the National Health Service (NHS) Job Evaluation scheme to determine the pay bands for most NHS staff and ensure equal pay for work of equal value. The challenges of recruiting and retaining physicians in Chinese public hospitals have heightened the need for a reliable job evaluation system to ensure the equality of physician compensation. The aim of this study was to construct job evaluation factors of physicians in Chinese public hospitals based on the NHS Job Evaluation scheme and to examine the reliability and validity of the established system. Methods Questionnaire surveys and statistical analyses were used to determine the job evaluation factors for physicians. The preliminary screening of the evaluation factors was based on a literature review, focused interviews with physicians and the Delphi method. Based on the results of preliminary screening, a questionnaire with 25 factors was designed to survey physicians regarding the importance of each factor in physician job evaluation. After the pretest, final questionnaire data were collected from 900 physicians by adopting a stratified sampling from 6 tertiary public hospitals in Beijing. A principal component analysis was used for factor extraction and structural validity analysis. The reliability was determined using Cronbach’s alpha. Results The results of the principal component analysis showed that the 25 physician job evaluation factors were grouped into the 5 dimensions of Task Characteristics , Knowledge , Responsibility , Effort/Environment , and Skills . The Cronbach’s alpha coefficients of the five dimensions ranged from 0.841 to 0.909, which indicated a high level of reliability. The result of the factor analysis indicated fair structural validity. The content validity was established by building onto the NHS Job Evaluation scheme and other well-established job evaluation systems. Conclusions Our study indicates that the Chinese version of physician job evaluation is an instrument with fair reliability and validity, which fully reflects the characteristics of physicians in Chinese public hospitals. This system can provide an important basis for developing a physician compensation plan and ensuring internal equity in healthcare organizations."
https://openalex.org/W3121119553,"Background Depression and anxiety are common mental health problems that are strongly associated with sleep disturbances, according to community-based researches. However, this association has not been investigated among patients admitted for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). We examined the prevalence of depression and anxiety in inpatients with various CVDs and their association with sleep disturbances. Materials and methods This cross-sectional study included 1294 patients hospitalized for CVDs in a Japanese university hospital were evaluated for their mental status using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), for sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) using pulse oximetry, and for sleep quality using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Results Patient characteristics were as below: mean age, 63.9±14.7 years; 25.7% female. Overall, 18.9% had depression (HADS-depression≥8) and 17.1% had anxiety (HADS-anxiety≥8). The presence of depression was associated with female sex, older age, higher plasma brain natriuretic peptide level, lower estimated glomerular filtration rate, and the prevalence of heart failure. Overall, 46.5% patients were categorized as having a poor sleep quality (PSQI&gt;5), and 28.5% patients had SDB (3% oxygen desaturation index&gt;15). Although depression and anxiety were not associated with SDB, they were independently associated with poor sleep quality (OR = 3.09, 95% CI 2.19–4.36; OR = 3.93, 95% CI 2.71–5.69, respectively). Conclusions Depression and anxiety were not uncommon in patients with CVDs. Poor sleep quality could be an important risk factor linked to psychological disturbances."
https://openalex.org/W3114495255,"“Are you OK?” my principal investigator (PI) asked me. I had just broken down crying in his office during one of our meetings. “It doesn't seem like you're OK.” He was right. But I wasn't ready to be vulnerable with him, so I evaded the question. Later, I wondered why. When I mentor undergrads, I make a point of connecting with them on a personal level and reaching out to them when they seem to need help. For the past year, I had been yearning for someone to do the same for me. So why hadn't I accepted the gesture when it finally came?



> “Concealing my stuggles … hampered my ability to be my true self in the lab.” 

Things had started to go downhill for me during the third year of my Ph.D. My science wasn't going as planned, and I was in the midst of a long-standing conflict with a colleague. I was dragging myself into the lab at 1 p.m., my face hidden beneath my hood, headphones on to drown out the chatter around me. I stopped speaking up in meetings. The quality and quantity of my work dropped. With my downcast eyes, slow gait, and slumped posture, I tried to signal that I needed help—but nobody reached out. To my labmates, I may have just seemed stressed or tired. As for my PI, he seemed to not want to pry into my personal life. I felt alone and helpless, hesitant to share my struggles because I wasn't sure that anyone cared.

For a while, my undergrads kept me functioning. Their curiosity spurred me to plan experiments and read papers. My duty to them forced me out of bed and into the lab, where I set aside my own distress and put on the disguise of an encouraging mentor. I enthusiastically asked about their classes and weekend plans, their extracurricular activities and postgraduation ambitions. Mentoring offered a consolation: If I couldn't make my mark in science, at least I could have an impact on my mentees' career trajectories and support them through their own challenges.

When one of my undergrads began to act lethargic and distracted, for example, I reached out to ask whether there was anything I could do. Though usually reticent, she opened up. She thanked me for checking in and offering a sympathetic ear, and we adjusted her lab workload to accommodate her needs. Why was it that I could be there for my mentees, yet no one could be there for me?

Soon enough, I lost the high I got from mentoring. My patience gave way to irritation. When my undergrads made simple mistakes, I had a harder time being understanding. I knew that I couldn't wait any longer to seek help. I finally contacted the therapist I had connected with at the beginning of grad school and started medication for my now-diagnosed anxiety and depression.

Then came that meeting with my adviser. Because our relationship had always been strictly professional, I wasn't sure he really wanted to know about my troubles any more than my other colleagues seemed to. I also worried that he would think less of me if I told him I was having a hard time.

Yet concealing my struggles from my closest colleagues hampered my ability to be my true self in the lab—the place where I spent most of my waking hours. Eventually, I worked up the courage to tell close friends and supportive labmates. Many listened and empathized, and I realized that just because they hadn't reached out didn't mean they didn't care.

In the end, I told my PI too. It was incredibly awkward at first, but with time, we became more comfortable having frank, candid conversations. We made arrangements to minimize the conflict I had with my colleague and devised a plan to balance my scientific interests with my graduation timeline. I'm still working on my mental health, but I finally feel like I'm headed in the right direction.

The experience has taught me that when I need help and support, sometimes I need to ask for it. And when it's offered, even from an unlikely source, I should embrace it."
https://openalex.org/W3120373144,"For the last couple of decades, there has been a significant growth in sequencing data, leading to an extraordinary increase in the number of gene variants. This places a challenge on the bioinformatics research community to develop and improve computational tools for functional annotation of new variants. Genes coding for epigenetic regulators have important roles in cancer pathogenesis and mutations in these genes show great potential as clinical biomarkers, especially in hematologic malignancies. Therefore, we developed a model that specifically focuses on these genes, with an assumption that it would outperform general models in predicting the functional effects of amino acid substitutions. EpiMut is a standalone software that implements a sequence based alignment-free method. We applied a two-step approach for generating sequence based features, relying on the biophysical and biochemical indices of amino acids and the Fourier Transform as a sequence transformation method. For each gene in the dataset, the machine learning algorithm–Naïve Bayes was used for building a model for prediction of the neutral or disease-related status of variants. EpiMut outperformed state-of-the-art tools used for comparison, PolyPhen-2, SIFT and SNAP2. Additionally, EpiMut showed the highest performance on the subset of variants positioned outside conserved functional domains of analysed proteins, which represents an important group of cancer-related variants. These results imply that EpiMut can be applied as a first choice tool in research of the impact of gene variants in epigenetic regulators, especially in the light of the biomarker role in hematologic malignancies.

https://openalex.org/W3121111199,"Do one’s hierarchical preference for attachment support from a particular person over other people (attachment hierarchy) and his/her discomfort with closeness and uneasiness about being dependent on that particular person (attachment avoidance) inversely overlap? These two constructs have been distinctly conceptualized. Attachment hierarchy has been regarded as a normative characteristic of attachment relationships, while attachment avoidance has been considered to reflect an individual difference of relationship quality. Employing bifactor analyses, we demonstrated a unidimensional general factor of these two concepts in four studies exploring Czech young adults’ relationships with mother, father, friends, and romantic partner (Study 1); U.S. young adults’ relationships with a romantic partner (Study 2); Czech adolescents’ relationships with mother, father, and friends (Study 3); and Japanese young adults’ relationships with mother, father, and romantic partner (Study 4). These convergent results provide the replicable and generalizable evidence that one’s attachment avoidance toward a particular person and her/his placement of that particular person in the attachment hierarchy are inversely overlapping."
