https://openalex.org/W2730479429,"The intestinal epithelial barrier, composed of epithelial cells, tight junction proteins and intestinal secretions, prevents passage of luminal substances and antigens through the paracellular space. Dysfunction of the intestinal barrier integrity induced by toxins and pathogens is associated with a variety of gastrointestinal disorders and diseases. Although butyrate is known to enhance intestinal health, its role in the protection of intestinal barrier function is poorly characterized. Therefore, we investigated the effect of butyrate on intestinal epithelial integrity and tight junction permeability in a model of LPS-induced inflammation in IPEC-J2 cells. Butyrate dose-dependently reduced LPS impairment of intestinal barrier integrity and tight junction permeability, measured by trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and paracellular uptake of fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran (FITC-dextran). Additionally, butyrate increased both mRNA expression and protein abundance of claudins-3 and 4, and influenced intracellular ATP concentration in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, butyrate prevented the downregulation of Akt and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation by LPS, indicating that butyrate might enhance tight junction protein abundance through mechanisms that included activation of Akt/mTOR mediated protein synthesis. The regulation of AMPK activity and intracellular ATP level by butyrate indicates that butyrate might regulate energy status of the cell, perhaps by serving as a nutrient substrate for ATP synthesis, to support intestinal epithelial barrier tight junction protein abundance. Our findings suggest that butyrate might protect epithelial cells from LPS-induced impairment of barrier integrity through an increase in the synthesis of tight junction proteins, and perhaps regulation of energy homeostasis."

Patient activation is considered the most reliable indicator of patients' ability to manage health autonomously. Only a few studies have tried to assess the role of psychosocial factors in promoting patient activation. A more systematic modeling of the psychosocial factors explaining the variance of patient activation is needed.To test the hypothesized effect of patient activation on medication adherence; to test the the hypothesized effects of positive emotions and of the quality of the patient/doctor relationship on patient activation; and to test the hypothesized mediating effect of Patient Health Engagement (PHE-model) in this pathway.This cross-sectional study involved 352 Italian-speaking adult chronic patients. The survey included measures of i) patient activation (Patient Activation Measure 13 -short form); ii) Patient Health Engagement model (Patient Health Engagement Scale); iii) patient adherence (4 item-Morinsky Medication Adherence Scale); iv) the quality of the patients' emotional feelings (Manikin Self Assessment Scale); v) the quality of the patient/doctor relationship (Health Care Climate Questionnaire). Structural equation modeling was used to test the hypotheses proposed.According to the theoretical model we hypothesized, research results confirmed that patients' activation significantly affects their reported medication adherence. Moreover, psychosocial factors, such as the patients' quality of the emotional feelings and the quality of the patient/doctor relationship were demonstrated to be factors affecting the level of patient activation. Finally, the mediation effect of the Patient Health Engagement model was confirmed by the analysis.Consistently with the results of previous studies, these findings demonstrate that the Patient Health Engagement Model is a critical factor in enhancing the quality of care. The Patient Health Engagement Model might acts as a mechanism to increase patient activation and adherence."
https://openalex.org/W2724237167,"For several hundred years freshwater crayfish (Crustacea-Decapoda-Astacidea) have played an important ecological, cultural and culinary role in Scandinavia. However, many native populations of noble crayfish Astacus astacus have faced major declines during the last century, largely resulting from human assisted expansion of non-indigenous signal crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus that carry and transmit the crayfish plague pathogen. In Denmark, also the non-indigenous narrow-clawed crayfish Astacus leptodactylus has expanded due to anthropogenic activities. Knowledge about crayfish distribution and early detection of non-indigenous and invasive species are crucial elements in successful conservation of indigenous crayfish. The use of environmental DNA (eDNA) extracted from water samples is a promising new tool for early and non-invasive detection of species in aquatic environments. In the present study, we have developed and tested quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays for species-specific detection and quantification of the three above mentioned crayfish species on the basis of mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase 1 (mtDNA-CO1), including separate assays for two clades of A. leptodactylus. The limit of detection (LOD) was experimentally established as 5 copies/PCR with two different approaches, and the limit of quantification (LOQ) were determined to 5 and 10 copies/PCR, respectively, depending on chosen approach. The assays detected crayfish in natural freshwater ecosystems with known populations of all three species, and show promising potentials for future monitoring of A. astacus, P. leniusculus and A. leptodactylus. However, the assays need further validation with data 1) comparing traditional and eDNA based estimates of abundance, and 2) representing a broader geographical range for the involved crayfish species."

Several studies have looked at the association between magnesium and depression, yet its role in symptom management is unclear. The objective of this trial was to test whether supplementation with over-the-counter magnesium chloride improves symptoms of depression. An open-label, blocked, randomized, cross-over trial was carried out in outpatient primary care clinics on 126 adults (mean age 52; 38% male) diagnosed with and currently experiencing mild-to-moderate symptoms with Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) scores of 5-19. The intervention was 6 weeks of active treatment (248 mg of elemental magnesium per day) compared to 6 weeks of control (no treatment). Assessments of depression symptoms were completed at bi-weekly phone calls. The primary outcome was the net difference in the change in depression symptoms from baseline to the end of each treatment period. Secondary outcomes included changes in anxiety symptoms as well as adherence to the supplement regimen, appearance of adverse effects, and intention to use magnesium supplements in the future. Between June 2015 and May 2016, 112 participants provided analyzable data. Consumption of magnesium chloride for 6 weeks resulted in a clinically significant net improvement in PHQ-9 scores of -6.0 points (CI -7.9, -4.2; P<0.001) and net improvement in Generalized Anxiety Disorders-7 scores of -4.5 points (CI -6.6, -2.4; P<0.001). Average adherence was 83% by pill count. The supplements were well tolerated and 61% of participants reported they would use magnesium in the future. Similar effects were observed regardless of age, gender, baseline severity of depression, baseline magnesium level, or use of antidepressant treatments. Effects were observed within two weeks. Magnesium is effective for mild-to-moderate depression in adults. It works quickly and is well tolerated without the need for close monitoring for toxicity."
https://openalex.org/W2727475156,"Background Sepsis is a serious medical condition with increasing prevalence and high mortality. The role of the autonomic nervous system in pathophysiology of sepsis has been increasingly researched. The objective of this study is to evaluate the Heart rate variability (HRV) as a predictor of mortality in septic patients. Methods This was a prospective cohort of patients diagnosed with sepsis. Patient recruitment was carried out at ICU in tertiary university hospital between March 2012 and February 2014. Clinical data and laboratory exams were collected at admission. Each patient underwent a 20-minute Holter and a 24-hour Holter on the first day of enrollment. The primary outcome was the 28-day all-cause mortality. Results A total of 63 patients were included. Patients were categorized into nonsurvivor group (n = 16) or survivor group (n = 47) depending on this endpoint. Survivors were younger (48.6 years vs. 63.0 years), had better renal function and lower values in severity scores (APACHE II and SOFA) compared to nonsurvivors. In the 20-minute Holter, SDNN, Total Power, VLF Power, LF Power and LF/HF of nonsurvivors were significantly lower than those of survivors (p = <0.001, p = 0.003, p = 0.002, p = 0.006, p = 0.009 respectively). ROC curve of SDNN was built, showing area under the curve of 0.772 (0.638–0.906) for mortality. The value of 17ms was chosen as best SDNN cutoff to discriminate survivors and nonsurvivors. In the Cox proportional regression, adjusted for SOFA score and for APACHE II, a SDNN ≤ 17ms was associated with a greater risk of death, with hazard ratios of 6.3 (1.4–28.0; p = 0.015) and 5.5 (1,2–24,8; p = 0.027), respectively. The addition of the dichotomized SDNN to the SOFA model reduced AIC and increased the concordance statistic and the R2, indicating that predictive power of the SDNN + SOFA model is better than predictive power of SOFA only. Conclusions Several HRV parameters are reduced in nonsurviving septic patients. SDNN ≤17 is a risk factor for death in septic patients, even after adjusting for severity scores."
https://openalex.org/W2729103233,"This study investigated the influence of Trichoderma asperellum on active oxygen production in maize seedlings under saline-alkaline stress conditions. Two maize cultivars were tested: 'Jiangyu 417' ('JY417'), which can tolerate saline-alkaline stress; and, 'Xianyu 335' ('XY335'), which is sensitive to saline-alkaline stress. The seedlings were grown on natural saline-alkaline soil (pH 9.30) in plastic pots. To each liter of saline-alkaline soil, 200 mL of T. asperellum spore suspension was applied; three fungal suspensions were used, namely, 1 × 103, 1 × 106, and 1 × 109 spores/L. A control with only the vehicle applied was also established, along with a second control in which untreated meadow soil (pH 8.23) was used. Root and leaf samples were collected when the seedlings had three heart-shaped leaves and the fourth was in the developmental phase. Physical and biochemical parameters related to oxidation resistance were assessed. The results indicated that the 'JY417' and 'XY335' seedlings showed different degrees of oxidative damage and differences in their antioxidant defense systems under saline-alkaline stress. As the spore density of the fungal suspension increased, the K+ and Ca2+ contents in the seedlings increased, but Na+ content decreased. Moreover, fungal treatment promoted the synthesis or accumulation of osmolytes, which enhanced the water absorbing capacity of the cells, increased antioxidant enzyme activities, enhanced the content of non-enzyme antioxidants, and reduced the accumulation of reactive oxygen species. Fungal treatment alleviated oxidative damage caused by the saline-alkaline stress in roots and leaves of the seedlings. The application of T. asperellum overcame the inhibitory effect of saline-alkaline soil stress on the growth of maize seedlings. In the present experiment, application with 1 × 109 spores/L gave the optimal results."

Using the person-specific approach described by Fisher (2015), we devised an initial 4-step algorithm for devising a treatment plan based on modular cognitive behavioral therapy using results obtained from within-person factor analyses and dynamic factor models. Then, we describe the improvement and digitization of the algorithm, termed Dynamic Assessment Treatment Algorithm (DATA). The development, structure, and clinical implications of DATA are discussed."

The nine tissue biomarkers were immunohistochemically stained on tissue microarrays of RCC, and the semi-quantitative H-score, including intensity score, was used to grade the sample. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to evaluate tissue markers significant for overall survival (OS), cancer-specific survival (CSS), and recurrence-free survival (RFS) after adjusting for significant clinicopathological parameters.Samples from 351 RCC patients were included. The mean age of the patients was 53.9 years; the rates of pathologic T1-2/≥T3 stage, Fuhrman 1+2/3+4 grade, recurrence, and death were 269/65(80.5/19.5%), 222/107 (67.5/32.5%), 6.6%, and 10.5%, respectively. Median OS, CSS, and RFS were 220.6, 220.6, and 147.1 months, respectively. The multivariable analysis showed that pathologic T stage and Fuhrman nuclear grade were significantly associated with OS and CSS. Pathologic T stage and tumor size were associated with RFS. After adjusting for these significant prognostic clinicopathological factors, Ki-67 was significantly associated with OS (hazard ratio [HR], 2.7), CSS (HR, 3.82), and RFS (HR, 4.85) and pS6 was associated with CSS (HR, 8.63) and RFS (HR, 8.51) in the multivariable model (p<0.05).pS6 and Ki-67 are significant prognostic factors of RCC; however, BAP1, PBRM1, TGase 2, PD-L1, CA9, PTEN loss, and PSMA markers did not show this association."
https://openalex.org/W2644368976,"The objective of this pilot study was to compare the different ways of measuring salivary alpha-amylase (sAA, enzymatic vs. concentration) and to evaluate the influence that the different ways of reporting the results can have in sAA interpretation. For this purpose, sAA was measured by direct quantification and also by an enzymatic assay in three different naturalistic situations, a physical stressor (situation 1) and two mental stressors of different intensity (situations 2 and 3). The results were expressed in three different ways (without correction, multiplied by flow rate and divided by protein concentration). sAA concentration and activity increased just after situations 1 and 3. When values were multiplied by the flow rate, significant changes after situation 1 were detected only for sAA activity but not for sAA concentration, being these changes of lower significance and magnitude that those observed for sAA activity without any correction. In addition, a significant increase in sAA activity was found at T+15 in situation 2. In situation 3 the significant decrease in sAA at T+15 disappeared. When values were divided by protein concentration, there were no significant changes in situations 1 or 3, but a decrease in situation 2 at T+0 and an increase at T+15. sAA activity and concentration showed a significant correlation in all situations. This pilot study points out that the way of expressing sAA can influence the results obtained in different stress models and also their interpretation. Therefore, how sAA is reported and the factors involved in the different ways of expressing sAA, should be taken into consideration for an objective interpretation of sAA values."

CERT's N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain targets it to the Golgi by binding to phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns(4)P) in the Golgi membrane, whereas its C-terminal StAR-related lipid transfer domain (START) carries out ceramide transfer. Hyperphosphorylation of a serine-rich motif immediately after the PH domain decreases both PtdIns(4)P binding and ceramide transfer by CERT. This down-regulation requires both the PH and START domains, suggesting a possible inhibitory interaction between the two domains. In this study we show that isolated PH and START domains interact with each other. The crystal structure of a PH–START complex revealed that the START domain binds to the PH domain at the same site for PtdIns(4)P-binding, suggesting that the START domain competes with PtdIns(4)P for association with the PH domain. We further report that mutations disrupting the PH–START interaction increase both PtdIns(4)P-binding affinity and ceramide transfer activity of a CERT-serine–rich phosphorylation mimic. We also found that these mutations increase the Golgi localization of CERT inside the cell, consistent with enhanced PtdIns(4)P binding of the mutant.

These findings suggest the possibility of an autoinhibitory interaction between the PH and START domains and prompted our investigations. Our data show that isolated PH and START domains interact with a dissociation constant (KD) of ∼9.2 μm. We also determined the crystal structure of a protein complex formed by these two domains. The structure reveals that the START domain interacts with PH domain at its PtdIns(4)P-binding site. Moreover, the β1/β2 loop of the PH domain, which interacts with the membrane interfacial region, is completely shielded by the START domain (7.Sugiki T. Takeuchi K. Yamaji T. Takano T. Tokunaga Y.

Competition assays indicate the START domain competes with PH domain association with PtdIns(4)P-containing liposomes. Consistent with the structural finding, disruption of the PH–START interaction in a SR phosphorylation-mimic CERT restores both PtdIns(4)P binding and ceramide transfer activity. Moreover, with these mutations CERT also exhibited increased Golgi localization. Altogether, our structural, biochemical, and cellular investigations revealed that the START domain associates with the PH domain at the same site used for PH domain membrane-binding and confers CERT functional regulation. Phosphorylation of the Ser/Thr residues of CERT SR leads to down-regulation of PtdIns(4)P-binding by the PH domain and ceramide transfer by the START domain. This regulation is suggested to involve a direct interaction between the PH and START domains of CERT (12.Kumagai K. Kawano M. Shinkai-Ouchi F. Nishijima M. Hanada K.

To understand the structural basis of CERT functional regulation, we solved the crystal structure of a PH–START complex to 2.4 Å, limiting resolution (Table 1). Electron density allowed for building of 97 residues of the 103-residue PH domain and 235 of the 239-residue START domain.

Open table in a new tab In the complex structure, the β6′/β7′ and β8′/β9′ loops of the START domain clamp onto the β1/β2 loop of the PH domain and buries an interface of 614 Å2 (Fig. 1, B and C). Notably, the β6′/β7′ loop of the START domain occupies the cavity of the PH domain that is used for PtdIns(4)P-binding. Moreover, the β1/β2 loop of the PH domain, which makes significant energetic contributions to CERT PH domain association with membranes, is completely sandwiched by the β6′/β7′ and β8′/β9′ loops of the START domain (7.Sugiki T.

Crystal structure of the pleckstrin homology domain from the ceramide transfer protein: implications for conformational change upon ligand binding.PLoS ONE. 2013; 8: e79590Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The PtdIns(4)P-binding site and the β1/β2 loop of the PH domain are collectively referred as the “basic groove” due to a significant number of basic residues in that area (7.Sugiki T. Takeuchi K. Yamaji T. Takano T. Tokunaga Y. Kumagai K. Hanada K. Takahashi H. Shimada I. Structural basis for the Golgi association by the pleckstrin homology domain of the ceramide trafficking protein (CERT).J.

The electrostatic surface potential maps of the PH and START domains in the complex show that the negatively charged β6′/β7′ loop of the START domain fits snuggly into the basic groove of the PH domain (Fig. 1D). Comparison of the CERT PH–START complex structure with a HADDOCK-generated structure model of the PH/diC6–PtdIns(4)P complex shows a clash between START domain and diC6–PtdIns(4)P-binding to PH domain (7.Sugiki T.

These observations suggest that PH domain-binding to START domain is incompatible with its association with PtdIns(4)P-containing membranes. We also used nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) chemical shift perturbation to examine the binding interface between the PH and START domains. Adding unlabeled START domain to the 15N-labeled PH domain leads to reduction or complete loss of the peak intensities of some residues, suggesting intermediate exchange in the PH domain in the presence of the START domain (supplemental Fig. S2A). The residues that vanished or showed 90% or more reduction of peak intensity are mapped onto the crystal structure of the PH domain (PDB code 4HHV) (supplemental Fig. S2B). As a comparison, shown in supplemental Fig. S2C are residues that are affected by the addition of diC6–PtdIns(4)P to 15N labeled PH domain (8.Prashek J. Truong T. Yao X. Crystal structure of the pleckstrin homology domain from the ceramide transfer protein: implications for conformational change upon ligand binding.PLoS ONE. 2013; 8: e79590Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). It can be observed that perturbations of the PH domain by START domain and diC6–PtdIns(4)P occur in similar regions, indicating overlapping binding interfaces. The findings from these NMR studies are consistent with the PH–START complex crystal structure (Fig. 1B). EBI PISA and CCP4 program CONTACT were used to analyze the PH–START interface (15.Krissinel E. Henrick K. Inference of macromolecular assemblies from crystalline state.J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 372: 774-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (6771) Google Scholar, 20.Winn M.D. Ballard C.C. Cowtan K.D. Dodson E.J. Emsley P. Evans P.R. Keegan R.M. Krissinel E.B. Leslie A.G. McCoy A.

Crystallogr. 2011; 67: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (9206) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). The PH and START domain interface consists of 20 residues from the PH domain and 17 residues from the START domain. Specifically, Lys32, Trp33, Tyr36, Trp40, Arg43, Tyr54, Arg66, and Tyr96 of the PH domain form multiple contacts with the START domain. These PH domain interface residues are also involved in binding to PtdIns(4)P-containing membranes either through direct interactions with PtdIns(4)P or through interactions with the membrane interfacial region (7.Sugiki T. Takeuchi K. Yamaji T. Takano T. Tokunaga Y. Kumagai K. Hanada K. Takahashi H. Shimada I.

Crystal structure of the pleckstrin homology domain from the ceramide transfer protein: implications for conformational change upon ligand binding.PLoS ONE. 2013; 8: e79590Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), i.e. the PH domain uses the same set of residues for START domain and PtdIns(4)P-containing membrane interaction. Three residues in the β6′/β7′ loop of the START domain, Glu494, Asn495, and Glu498, form extensive hydrogen bonds with PH domain residues Lys32, Tyr36, Arg43, Tyr54, and Arg66 (Fig. 2, B and C). Phe598, the last residue of the START domain, interacts with Tyr36 through π-π stacking (Fig. 2C). Val533 and Pro535 in the β8′/β9′ loop make hydrophobic contacts with PH domain residues Trp33, Trp40, and Tyr96 (Fig. 2D). In addition, the backbone CO of Val533 forms a hydrogen bond with Trp33 indole ring NH group (Fig. 2D). The β8′/β9′ loop of the START domain, although not in direct competition with the PH domain PtdIns(4)P-binding site, shields the β1/β2 loop and would, therefore, prevent PH/membrane association. The PH–START complex structure clearly suggests that PtdIns(4)P and START domain binding by the PH domain are incompatible interactions. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) was used to determine the affinity between the PH and START domains. ITC measurements were performed by injecting PH protein into START protein. Global fitting of three separate measurements using a single-site model yields a ΔH of −12.1 (−13.1, −11.3) kcal/mol and a KD of 9.2 (8.1, 10.5) μm (Fig. 3). To evaluate the contributions of interface residues in the interaction, site-directed mutants were generated in both the PH and START domains. The abilities of these mutants to compete for binding against the wild-type PH–START interaction were assessed in an AlphaScreen competition assay (21.Bielefeld-Sevigny M. AlphaLISA immunoassay platform- the “no-wash” high-throughput alternative to ELISA.Assay Drug. Dev. Technol. 2009; 7: 90-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4A). IC50 values of 2.0 and 2.2 μm were obtained for the wild-type (WT) PH and START domains, respectively (Fig. 4, B–D). A PH domain R43A mutant showed a >8-fold increase in IC50 (16.8 μm) as compared with PH WT (Fig. 4, B and D). However, the IC50 for the Y54A mutant (1.5 μm) is similar to that of the PH WT, and the IC50 values for the R43A/Y54A and the R43A mutants are also close to each other (Fig. 4, B and D). One-way analysis of variance statistics indicate that the IC50 differences measured for the R43A and R43A/Y54A mutants versus PH WT domain were statistically significant, whereas Y54A was not (Fig. 4E). These results indicate that Arg43 significantly contributes to the PH–START interaction, whereas the contribution from Tyr54 is negligible. It is likely that despite the short distance, Tyr54 is not positioned at an optimal orientation for hydrogen-bond formation with Glu494. It is also conceivable that other nearby basic residues, such as Lys56, may engage in interactions with Glu494 in the Y54A mutant, thus making this residue less critical for START domain binding. We also attempted to measure the IC50 of a W33A/R43A/Y54A PH domain mutant, but the experiments were unsuccessful. Using NMR 1H,15N 2D heteronuclear single-quantum correlation (HSQC) experiments, we found that the W33A/R43A/Y54A mutant maintains the overall tertiary fold of the PH domain (supplemental Fig. S3). We speculate the difficulties with these experiments were likely caused by protein aggregation at high concentrations in the presence of the AlphaScreen beads. As an alternative to the AlphaScreen competition assay, we used 2D HSQC experiments to evaluate the effect of the W33A/R43A/Y54A mutations on START domain binding. The presence of a 1× unlabeled PH WT domain led to extensive broadening of the 15N-labeled START domain peaks, likely from intermediate binding exchange (supplemental Fig. S4A). In contrast, the addition of 1× PH W33A/R43A/Y54A mutant lead to little change in the START domain spectrum, suggesting a much-reduced affinity between the PH W33A/R43A/Y54A mutant and the START domain (supplemental Fig. S4B). To validate the role of the β6′/β7′ and β8′/β9′ loops of the START domain in the PH–START interaction, START domain mutants E494R/N495K and E494R/N495K/P535R/E537K and a mutant in which a (GGS)2 linker replaces the β6′/β7′ loop (Δ493–498 (GGS)2) were tested in the AlphaScreen competition assay (Fig. 4A). The E494R/N495K and the Δ493–498 (GGS)2 mutants both displayed significant decreases in affinity compared with START WT domain with an IC50 of 34.7 and 59.5 μm, respectively, demonstrating the importance of the β6′/β7′ loop in mediating the PH–START interaction (Fig. 4, C–E). The E494R/N495K/P535R/E537K mutant showed the most loss in affinity with an IC50 of 86.1 μm, confirming that both loops of the START domain contribute to PH domain binding (Fig. 4, C–E). Altogether, these competition assays establish that the START domain uses the β6′/β7′ and β8′/β9′ loops to engage with the PtdIns(4)P-binding site of the PH domain. The crystal structure of the PH–START complex predicts that the START domain competes with PtdIns(4)P-containing membranes for binding to the PH domain (7.Sugiki T. Takeuchi K. Yamaji T. Takano T.

To test this hypothesis, an AlphaScreen competition assay in which the ability of START domain to compete against PtdIns(4)P-embedded liposomes for PH domain association was evaluated (Fig. 5A). An IC50 value of 1.5 μm was obtained for the PH WT protein, which is comparable with the reported affinity of the PH domain for PtdIns(4)P-embedded liposomes (7.Sugiki T. Takeuchi K. Yamaji T.

https://openalex.org/W2733647648,"Protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) is an essential enzyme controlling about 85% of the total cellular arginine methylation in proteins. We have shown previously that PRMT1 is an important regulator of innate immune responses and that it is required for M2 macrophage differentiation. c-Myc is a transcription factor that is critical in regulating cell proliferation and also regulates the M2 transcriptional program in macrophages. Here, we sought to determine whether c-Myc in myeloid cells is regulated by PRMT1-dependent arginine methylation. We found that PRMT1 activity was necessary for c-Myc binding to the acetyltransferase p300. PRMT1 inhibition decreased p300 recruitment to c-Myc target promoters and increased histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) recruitment, thereby decreasing transcription at these sites. Moreover, PRMT1 inhibition blocked c-Myc-mediated induction of several of its target genes, including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARG) and mannose receptor C-type 1 (MRC1), suggesting that PRMT1 is necessary for c-Myc function in M2 macrophage differentiation. Of note, in primary human blood monocytes, p300-c-Myc binding was strongly correlated with PRMT1 expression, and in liver sections, PRMT1, c-Myc, and M2 macrophage levels were strongly correlated with each other. Both PRMT1 levels and M2 macrophage numbers were significantly lower in livers from individuals with a history of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, known to have defective cellular immunity. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that PRMT1 is an important regulator of c-Myc function in myeloid cells. PRMT1 loss in individuals with cirrhosis may contribute to their immune defects."

However, the entire nervous system of adult ascidians has yet to be functionally and anatomically investigated. In this study, we have revealed the whole dorsal and siphon nervous system of the transgenic adult ascidian of Ciona intestinalis Type A (Ciona robusta) in which a Kaede reporter gene is expressed in a pan-neuronal fashion. The fluorescent signal of Kaede revealed the innervation patterns and distribution of neurons in the nervous system of Ciona. Precise microscopic observation demonstrated the clear innervation of the anterior and posterior main nerves to eight and six lobes of the oral and atrial siphons, respectively. Moreover, visceral nerves, previously identified as unpaired nerves, were found to be paired; one nerve was derived from the posterior end of the cerebral ganglion and the other from the right posterior nerve. This study further revealed the full trajectory of the dorsal strand plexus and paired visceral nerves on either side from the cerebral ganglion to the ovary, and precise innervation between the cerebral ganglion and the peripheral organs including the gonoduct, cupular organ, rectum and ovary. The differential innervation patterns of visceral nerves and the dorsal strand plexus indicate that the peripheral organs including the ovary undergo various neural regulations. Collectively, the present anatomical analysis revealed the major innervation of the dorsal and siphon nervous systems of adult Ciona."
https://openalex.org/W2734190773,"Objectives The nationwide impact of antimicrobial-resistant infections on healthcare facilities throughout Japan has yet to be examined. This study aimed to estimate the disease burden of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections in Japanese hospitals. Design Retrospective analysis of inpatients comparing outcomes between subjects with and without MRSA infection. Data source A nationwide administrative claims database. Setting 1133 acute care hospitals throughout Japan. Participants All surgical and non-surgical inpatients who were discharged between April 1, 2014 and March 31, 2015. Main outcome measures Disease burden was assessed using hospitalization costs, length of stay, and in-hospital mortality. Using a unique method of infection identification, we categorized patients into an anti-MRSA drug group and a control group based on anti-MRSA drug utilization. To estimate the burden of MRSA infections, we calculated the differences in outcome measures between these two groups. The estimates were extrapolated to all 1584 acute care hospitals in Japan that have adopted a prospective payment system. Results We categorized 93 838 patients into the anti-MRSA drug group and 2 181 827 patients into the control group. The mean hospitalization costs, length of stay, and in-hospital mortality of the anti-MRSA drug group were US$33 548, 75.7 days, and 22.9%, respectively; these values were 3.43, 2.95, and 3.66 times that of the control group, respectively. When extrapolated to the 1584 hospitals, the total incremental burden of MRSA was estimated to be US$2 billion (3.41% of total hospitalization costs), 4.34 million days (3.02% of total length of stay), and 14.3 thousand deaths (3.62% of total mortality). Conclusions This study quantified the approximate disease burden of MRSA infections in Japan. These findings can inform policymakers on the burden of antimicrobial-resistant infections and support the application of infection prevention programs."
https://openalex.org/W2724538835,"High latitude benthos are globally important in terms of accumulation and storage of ocean carbon, and the feedback this is likely to have on regional warming. Understanding this ecosystem service is important but difficult because of complex taxonomic diversity, history and geography of benthic biomass. Using South Georgia as a model location (where the history and geography of benthic biology is relatively well studied) we investigated whether the composition of functional groups were critical to benthic accumulation, immobilization and burial pathway to sequestration–and also aid their study through simplification of identification. We reclassified [1], [2]) morphotype and carbon mass data to 13 functional groups, for each sample of 32 sites around the South Georgia continental shelf. We investigated the influence on carbon accumulation, immobilization and sequestration estimate by multiple factors including the compositions of functional groups. Functional groups showed high diversity within and between sites, and within and between habitat types. Carbon storage was not linked to a functional group in particular but accumulation and immobilization increased with the number of functional groups present and the presence of hard substrata. Functional groups were also important to carbon burial rate, which increased with the presence of mixed (hard and soft substrata). Functional groups showed high surrogacy for taxonomic composition and were useful for examining contrasting habitat categorization. Functional groups not only aid marine carbon storage investigation by reducing time and the need for team size and speciality, but also important to benthic carbon pathways per se. There is a distinct geography to seabed carbon storage; seabed boulder-fields are hotspots of carbon accumulation and immobilization, whilst the interface between such boulder-fields and sediments are key places for burial and sequestration."
https://openalex.org/W2725878222,"Background The multiple imputation approach to missing data has been validated by a number of simulation studies by artificially inducing missingness on fully observed stage data under a pre-specified missing data mechanism. However, the validity of multiple imputation has not yet been assessed using real data. The objective of this study was to assess the validity of using multiple imputation for “unknown” prostate cancer stage recorded in the New South Wales Cancer Registry (NSWCR) in real-world conditions. Methods Data from the population-based cohort study NSW Prostate Cancer Care and Outcomes Study (PCOS) were linked to 2000–2002 NSWCR data. For cases with “unknown” NSWCR stage, PCOS-stage was extracted from clinical notes. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the missing at random assumption adjusted for variables from two imputation models: a basic model including NSWCR variables only and an enhanced model including the same NSWCR variables together with PCOS primary treatment. Cox regression was used to evaluate the performance of MI. Results Of the 1864 prostate cancer cases 32.7% were recorded as having “unknown” NSWCR stage. The missing at random assumption was satisfied when the logistic regression included the variables included in the enhanced model, but not those in the basic model only. The Cox models using data with imputed stage from either imputation model provided generally similar estimated hazard ratios but with wider confidence intervals compared with those derived from analysis of the data with PCOS-stage. However, the complete-case analysis of the data provided a considerably higher estimated hazard ratio for the low socio-economic status group and rural areas in comparison with those obtained from all other datasets. Conclusions Using MI to deal with “unknown” stage data recorded in a population-based cancer registry appears to provide valid estimates. We would recommend a cautious approach to the use of this method elsewhere."
https://openalex.org/W2727525767,"The South American sea lion (Otaria flavescens) is widely distributed along the southern Atlantic and Pacific coasts of South America with a history of significant commercial exploitation. We aimed to evaluate the population genetic structure and the evolutionary history of South American sea lion along its distribution by analyses of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and 10 nuclear microsatellites loci. We analyzed 147 sequences of mtDNA control region and genotyped 111 individuals of South American sea lion for 10 microsatellite loci, representing six populations (Peru, Northern Chile, Southern Chile, Uruguay (Brazil), Argentina and Falkland (Malvinas) Islands) and covering the entire distribution of the species. The mtDNA phylogeny shows that haplotypes from the two oceans comprise two very divergent clades as observed in previous studies, suggesting a long period (>1 million years) of low inter-oceanic female gene flow. Bayesian analysis of bi-parental genetic diversity supports significant (but less pronounced than mitochondrial) genetic structure between Pacific and Atlantic populations, although also suggested some inter-oceanic gene flow mediated by males. Higher male migration rates were found in the intra-oceanic population comparisons, supporting very high female philopatry in the species. Demographic analyses showed that populations from both oceans went through a large population expansion ~10,000 years ago, suggesting a very similar influence of historical environmental factors, such as the last glacial cycle, on both regions. Our results support the proposition that the Pacific and Atlantic populations of the South American sea lion should be considered distinct evolutionarily significant units, with at least two managements units in each ocean."
https://openalex.org/W2724115973,"Here we describe derivatives of the HEK293T cell line that are defective in their ability to generate mucin-type O-linked glycosylation. Using CRISPR/Cas9 and a single-cell GFP-sorting procedure, the UDP-galactose-4-epimerase (GALE), galactokinase 1 (GALK1), and galactokinase 2 (GALK2) genes were knocked out individually and in combinations with greater than 90% of recovered clones having the desired mutations. Although HEK293T cells are tetraploid, we found this approach to be an efficient method to target and disrupt all 4 copies of the target gene. Deficient glycosylation in the GALE knockout cell line could be rescued by the addition of galactose and N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) to the cell culture media. However, when key enzymes of the galactose/GalNAc salvage pathways were disrupted in tandem (GALE+GALK1 or GALE+GALK2), O-glycosylation was eliminated and could not be rescued by the addition of either galactose plus GalNAc or UDP-galactose plus UDP-GalNAc. GALK1 and GALK2 are key enzymes of the galactose/GalNAc salvage pathways. Mass spectrometry was performed on whole cell lysate of the knockout cell lines to verify the glycosylation phenotype. As expected, the GALE knockout was almost completely devoid of all O-glycosylation, with minimal glycosylation as a result of functional salvage pathways. However, the GALE+GALK1 and GALE+GALK2 knockout lines were devoid of all O-glycans. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed that the disruption of GALE, GALK1, and GALE+GALK2 had little effect on the N-glycome. But when GALE was knocked out in tandem with GALK1, N-glycans were exclusively of the high mannose type. Due to the well-characterized nature of these five knockout cell lines, they will likely prove useful for a wide variety of applications."
https://openalex.org/W2731380181,"Building proteins into larger, post-translational assemblies in a defined and stable way is still a challenging task. A promising approach relies on so-called tag/catcher systems that are fused to the proteins of interest and allow a durable linkage via covalent intermolecular bonds. Tags and catchers are generated by splitting protein domains that contain intramolecular isopeptide or ester bonds that form autocatalytically under physiological conditions. There are already numerous biotechnological and medical applications that demonstrate the usefulness of covalent linkages mediated by these systems. Additional covalent tag/catcher systems would allow creating more complex and ultra-stable protein architectures and networks. Two of the presently available tag/catcher systems were derived from closely related CnaB-domains of Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus dysgalactiae proteins. However, it is unclear whether domain splitting is generally tolerated within the CnaB-family or only by a small subset of these domains. To address this point, we have selected a set of four CnaB domains of low sequence similarity and characterized the resulting tag/catcher systems by computational and experimental methods. Experimental testing for intermolecular isopeptide bond formation demonstrated two of the four systems to be functional. For these two systems length and sequence variations of the peptide tags were investigated revealing only a relatively small effect on the efficiency of the reaction. Our study suggests that splitting into tag and catcher moieties is tolerated by a significant portion of the naturally occurring CnaB-domains, thus providing a large reservoir for the design of novel tag/catcher systems."
https://openalex.org/W2615368501,"Lactobacillus pentosus MP-10, isolated from brines of naturally fermented Aloreña green table olives, exhibited high probiotic potential. The genome sequence of L. pentosus MP-10 is currently considered the largest genome among lactobacilli, highlighting the microorganism’s ecological flexibility and adaptability. Here, we analyzed the complete genome sequence for the presence of acquired antibiotic resistance and virulence determinants to understand their defense mechanisms and explore its putative safety in food. The annotated genome sequence revealed evidence of diverse mobile genetic elements, such as prophages, transposases and transposons involved in their adaptation to brine-associated niches. In-silico analysis of L. pentosus MP-10 genome sequence identified a CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)/cas (CRISPR-associated protein genes) as an immune system against foreign genetic elements, which consisted of six arrays (4–12 repeats) and eleven predicted cas genes [CRISPR1 and CRISPR2 consisted of 3 (Type II-C) and 8 (Type I) genes] with high similarity to L. pentosus KCA1. Bioinformatic analyses revealed L. pentosus MP-10 to be absent of acquired antibiotic resistance genes, and most resistance genes were related to efflux mechanisms; no virulence determinants were found in the genome. This suggests that L. pentosus MP-10 could be considered safe and with high-adaptation potential, which could facilitate its application as a starter culture and probiotic in food preparations."
https://openalex.org/W2731719105,"Kindlin-2 (K2), a 4.1R-ezrin-radixin-moesin (FERM) domain adaptor protein, mediates numerous cellular responses, including integrin activation. The C-terminal 15-amino acid sequence of K2 is remarkably conserved across species but is absent in canonical FERM proteins, including talin. In CHO cells expressing integrin αIIbβ3, co-expression of K2 with talin head domain resulted in robust integrin activation, but this co-activation was lost after deletion of as few as seven amino acids from the K2 C terminus. This dependence on the C terminus was also observed in activation of endogenous αIIbβ3 in human erythroleukemia (HEL) cells and β1 integrin activation in macrophage-like RAW264.1 cells. Kindlin-1 (K1) exhibited a similar dependence on its C terminus for integrin activation. Expression of the K2 C terminus as an extension of membrane-anchored P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) inhibited integrin-dependent cell spreading. Deletion of the K2 C terminus did not affect its binding to the integrin β3 cytoplasmic tail, but combined biochemical and NMR analyses indicated that it can insert into the F2 subdomain. We suggest that this insertion determines the topology of the K2 FERM domain, and its deletion may affect the positioning of the membrane-binding functions of the F2 subdomain and the integrin-binding properties of its F3 subdomain. Free C-terminal peptide can still bind to K2 and displace the endogenous K2 C terminus but may not restore the conformation needed for integrin co-activation. Our findings indicate that the extreme C terminus of K2 is essential for integrin co-activation and highlight the importance of an atypical architecture of the K2 FERM domain in regulating integrin activation."
https://openalex.org/W2731757899,"Behavioral responses of silver carp (Hypopthalmichthys molitrix), bighead carp (H. nobilis), and common carp (Cyprinus carpio) to a complex, broadband sound were tested in the absence of visual cues to determine whether these species are negatively phonotaxic and the roles that sound pressure and particle motion might play mediating this response. In a dark featureless square enclosure, groups of 3 fish were tracked and the distance of each fish from speakers and their swimming trajectories relative to sound pressure and particle acceleration were analyzed before, and then while an outboard motor sound was played. All three species exhibited negative phonotaxis during the first two exposures after which they ceased responding. The median percent time fish spent near the active speaker for the first two trials decreased from 7.0% to 1.3% for silver carp, 7.9% to 1.1% for bighead carp, and 9.5% to 3% for common carp. Notably, when close to the active speaker fish swam away from the source and maintained a nearly perfect 0° orientation to the axes of particle acceleration. Fish did not enter sound fields greater than 140 dB (ref. 1 μPa). These results demonstrate that carp avoid complex sounds in darkness and while initial responses may be informed by sound pressure, sustained oriented avoidance behavior is likely mediated by particle motion. This understanding of how invasive carp use particle motion to guide avoidance could be used to design new acoustic deterrents to divert them in dark, turbid river waters."
https://openalex.org/W2676625555,"Pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp.) is a major food legume cultivated in semi-arid tropical regions including the Indian subcontinent, Africa, and Southeast Asia. It is an important source of protein, minerals, and vitamins for nearly 20% of the world population. Due to high carbon sequestration and drought tolerance, pigeonpea is an important crop for the development of climate resilient agriculture and nutritional security. However, pigeonpea productivity has remained low for decades because of limited genetic and genomic resources, and sparse utilization of landraces and wild pigeonpea germplasm. Here, we present a dense intraspecific linkage map of pigeonpea comprising 932 markers that span a total adjusted map length of 1,411.83 cM. The consensus map is based on three different linkage maps that incorporate a large number of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers derived from next generation sequencing data, using Illumina GoldenGate bead arrays, and genotyping with restriction site associated DNA (RAD) sequencing. The genotyping-by-sequencing enhanced the marker density but was met with limited success due to lack of common markers across the genotypes of mapping population. The integrated map has 547 bead-array SNP, 319 RAD-SNP, and 65 simple sequence repeat (SSR) marker loci. We also show here correspondence between our linkage map and published genome pseudomolecules of pigeonpea. The availability of a high-density linkage map will help improve the anchoring of the pigeonpea genome to its chromosomes and the mapping of genes and quantitative trait loci associated with useful agronomic traits."
https://openalex.org/W2725211858,"What wavelengths do undulatory swimmers use during propulsion? In this work we find that a wide range of body/caudal fin (BCF) swimmers, from larval zebrafish and herring to fully-grown eels, use specific wavelength (ratio of wavelength to tail amplitude of undulation) values that fall within a relatively narrow range. The possible emergence of this constraint is interrogated using numerical simulations of fluid-structure interaction. Based on these, it was found that there is an optimal specific wavelength (OSW) that maximizes the swimming speed and thrust generated by an undulatory swimmer. The observed values of specific wavelength for BCF animals are relatively close to this OSW. The mechanisms underlying the maximum propulsive thrust for BCF swimmers are quantified and are found to be consistent with the mechanisms hypothesized in prior work. The adherence to an optimal value of specific wavelength in most natural hydrodynamic propulsors gives rise to empirical design criteria for man-made propulsors."
https://openalex.org/W2726763326,"Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the causative agent of gonorrhea, has a number of factors known to contribute to pathogenesis; however, a full understanding of these processes and their regulation has proven to be elusive. Post-translational modifications (PTMs) of bacterial proteins are now recognized as one mechanism of protein regulation. In the present study, Western blot analyses, with an anti-acetyl-lysine antibody, indicated that a large number of gonococcal proteins are post-translationally modified. Previous work has shown that Nε-lysine acetylation can occur non-enzymatically with acetyl-phosphate (AcP) as the acetyl donor. In the current study, an acetate kinase mutant (1291ackA), which accumulates AcP, was generated in N. gonorrhoeae. Broth cultures of N. gonorrhoeae 1291wt and 1291ackA were grown, proteins extracted and digested, and peptides containing acetylated-lysines (K-acetyl) were affinity-enriched from both strains. Mass spectrometric analyses of these samples identified a total of 2686 unique acetylation sites. Label-free relative quantitation of the K-acetyl peptides derived from the ackA and wild-type (wt) strains demonstrated that 109 acetylation sites had an ackA/wt ratio>2 and p-values <0.05 in at least 2/3 of the biological replicates and were designated as ""AckA-dependent"". Regulated K-acetyl sites were found in ribosomal proteins, central metabolism proteins, iron acquisition and regulation proteins, pilus assembly and regulation proteins, and a two-component response regulator. Since AckA is part of a metabolic pathway, comparative growth studies of the ackA mutant and wt strains were performed. The mutant showed a growth defect under aerobic conditions, an inability to grow anaerobically, and a defect in biofilm maturation. In conclusion, the current study identified AckA-dependent acetylation sites in N. gonorrhoeae and determined that these sites are found in a diverse group of proteins. This work lays the foundation for future studies focusing on specific acetylation sites that may have relevance in gonococcal pathogenesis and metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2642219954,"Isoflavonoids are secondary metabolites that play a variety of roles in plant-microbe interactions and plant defenses against abiotic stresses. Here we report a new MYB transcription factor (TF) gene, GmMYBJ3, that is involved in the isoflavonoids biosynthesis. The GmMYBJ3 gene is 1,002 bp long and encodes a protein of 333 amino acids. Amino acid sequence analysis showed that GmMYBJ3 is a typical R2R3 MYB TF. Yeast expression experiment demonstrated that GmMYBJ3 has its transcription activity in the nucleus and is transiently expressed in onion epidermal cells. The GmMYBJ3 gene was transformed into soybean and the expression activity of the GmMYBJ3 gene was significantly positively correlated with total isoflavonoid accumulation in soybean. Transient expression assays indicated that GmMYBJ3 can activate CHS8 expression. Furthermore, we analyzed the expressions of several genes known involved in the isoflavonoid biosynthesis, including CHS8, CHI1A, PAL1, IFS2 and F3H, in the GmMYBJ3 transgenic plants. The results showed that the expression levels of CHS8 and CHI1A were significantly increased in the transgenic plants compared to wild-type plants, but those of PAL1, IFS2 and F3H remained similar between the transgenic and wild-type plants. These results suggest that GmMYBJ3 participates in the isoflavonoid biosynthesis through regulation of CHS8 and CHI1A in soybean."
https://openalex.org/W2725935914,"Climate change and species invasions interact in nature, disrupting biological communities. Based on this knowledge, we simultaneously assessed the effects of climate change on the native distribution of the Amazonian fish Colossoma macropomum as well as on its invasiveness across river basins of South America, using ecological niche modeling. We used six niche models within the ensemble forecast context to predict the geographical distribution of C. macropomum for the present time, 2050 and 2080. Given that this species has been continuously introduced into non-native South American basins by fish farming activities, we added the locations of C. macropomum farms into the modeling process to obtain a more realistic scenario of its invasive potential. Based on modelling outputs we mapped climate refuge areas at different times. Our results showed that a plenty of climatically suitable areas for the occurrence of C. macropomum occurrence are located outside the original basins at the present time and that its invasive potential is greatly amplified by fish farms. Simulations of future geographic ranges revealed drastic range contraction in the native region, implying concerns not only with respect to the species conservation but also from a socio-economic perspective since the species is a cornerstone of artisanal and commercial fisheries in the Amazon. Although the invasive potential is projected to decrease in the face of climate change, climate refugia will concentrate in Paraná River, Southeast Atlantic and East Atlantic basins, putting intense, negative pressures on the native fish fauna these regions. Our findings show that short and long-term management actions are required for: i) the conservation of natural stocks of C. macropomum in the Amazon, and ii) protecting native fish fauna in the climate refuges of the invaded regions."
https://openalex.org/W2658070701,"Background High-risk (HR) human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is an established cause of malignant disease. We used a societal perspective to estimate the cost of HR HPV-related cervical, vulvar, vaginal, anal, and penile precancer and cancer, and oropharyngeal cancer in Sweden in 2006, 1 year before HPV vaccination became available in the country. Materials and methods This prevalence-based cost-of-illness study used diagnosis-specific data from national registries to determine the number of HR HPV-related precancers and cancers. The HR HPV-attributable fractions of these diseases were derived from a literature review and applied to the total burden to estimate HR HPV-attributable costs. Direct costs were based on health care utilization and indirect costs on loss of productivity due to morbidity (i.e., sick leave and early retirement) and premature mortality. Results The total annual cost of all HR HPV-attributable precancers and cancers was €94 million (€10.3/inhabitant). Direct costs accounted for €31.3 million (€3.4/inhabitant) of the total annual cost, and inpatient care amounted to €20.7 million of direct costs. Indirect costs made up €62.6 million (€6.9/inhabitant) of the total annual cost, and premature mortality amounted to €36 million of indirect costs. Cervical precancer and cancer was most costly (total annual cost €58.4 million). Among cancers affecting both genders, anal precancer and cancer, and oropharyngeal cancer were the most costly (€11.2 million and €11.9 million, respectively). For oropharyngeal cancer, males had the highest health care utilization and represented 71% of the total annual cost. Penile precancer and cancer was least costly (€2.6 million). Conclusion The economic burden of HR HPV-related precancers and cancers is substantial. The disease-related management and treatment costs we report are relevant as a point of reference for future economic evaluations investigating the overall benefits of HPV vaccination in females and males in Sweden."
https://openalex.org/W2668757385,"The cellular prion protein (PrPC) has been extensively studied because of its pivotal role in prion diseases; however, its functions remain incompletely understood. A unique line of goats has been identified that carries a nonsense mutation that abolishes synthesis of PrPC. In these animals, the PrP-encoding mRNA is rapidly degraded. Goats without PrPC are valuable in re-addressing loss-of-function phenotypes observed in Prnp knockout mice. As PrPC has been ascribed various roles in immune cells, we analyzed transcriptomic responses to loss of PrPC in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from normal goat kids (n = 8, PRNP+/+) and goat kids without PrPC (n = 8, PRNPTer/Ter) by mRNA sequencing. PBMCs normally express moderate levels of PrPC. The vast majority of genes were similarly expressed in the two groups. However, a curated list of 86 differentially expressed genes delineated the two genotypes. About 70% of these were classified as interferon-responsive genes. In goats without PrPC, the majority of type I interferon-responsive genes were in a primed, modestly upregulated state, with fold changes ranging from 1.4 to 3.7. Among these were ISG15, DDX58 (RIG-1), MX1, MX2, OAS1, OAS2 and DRAM1, all of which have important roles in pathogen defense, cell proliferation, apoptosis, immunomodulation and DNA damage response. Our data suggest that PrPC contributes to the fine-tuning of resting state PBMCs expression level of type I interferon-responsive genes. The molecular mechanism by which this is achieved will be an important topic for further research into PrPC physiology."
https://openalex.org/W2734005608,"We investigated the association between autoimmune thyroid disease and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) using nationwide insurance claims data for the entire Korean population. Claims data for the period 2009–2013 were retrieved from the National Health Insurance System database. SLE and thyroid disease were identified using the International Classification of Diseases codes and medication information. Logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate the association between SLE and thyroid disease. The study used records from 17,495 patients with SLE and 52,485 age- and sex-matched control subjects. A greater prevalence of Graves’ disease (0.94% vs. 0.46%, P < 0.001), Hashimoto’s thyroiditis (2.68% vs. 0.80%, P < 0.001), and thyroid cancer (1.81% vs. 1.30%, P < 0.001) was observed in SLE patients than in control subjects. Multivariate regression analyses demonstrated that SLE was significantly associated with an increased risk of both autoimmune thyroid disease and thyroid cancer (Graves’ disease: odds ratio [OR] 2.07, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.70–2.53; Hashimoto’s thyroiditis: OR 3.42, 95% CI 3.00–3.91; thyroid cancer: OR 1.40, 95% CI 1.22–1.60). Age- and sex- stratified analyses revealed that the risk of autoimmune thyroid disease in SLE patients was increased for all age groups and the female group. An association between thyroid cancer and SLE was identified only in the 20- to 59-year-old age group and in the female group. Using a large population-based study, we demonstrated that patients with SLE are at a greater risk of developing thyroid disease than matched control individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2726485560,"Aim of the paper The paper aims at describing and explaining net profit flows per country for the period 1980–2009. Net profit flows result from Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) stock and profit repatriation: inward stock creating a profit outflow and outward FDI stock a profit inflow. Profit flows, especially ‘normal’ ones are not commonly researched. Theoretical background According to world-system theory, countries are part of a system characterised by a core, semi-periphery and periphery, as shown by network analyses of trade relations. Network analyses based on ownership relations of TransNational Corporations (TNCs) show that the top 50 firms that control about 40% of the world economy are almost exclusively located in core countries. So, we may expect a hierarchy in net profit flows with core countries on top and the periphery at the bottom. FDI outflows from the core countries especially rose in the 1990s, so we may expect that the difference has grown in time. Data and results A dataset on 'net profit flow' per country is developed. There are diverging developments in net profit flows since the 1980s, as expected: ever more positive for core countries, negative and ever lower for semi-peripheral and peripheral countries, in particular from the 1990s onwards. A fixed effects quantile regression using publicly available data confirms the prediction that peripheral countries share a unique characteristic: their outward investments do not have a positive influence on net profit flow as is the case with semi-peripheral and core countries. The most probable explanation is that peripheral outward investments are indirectly owned by firms located in core and semi-peripheral countries, so all peripheral profit inflows end up in those countries."
https://openalex.org/W2679424403,"Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease or hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy is the most prevalent inherited peripheral neuropathy and is associated with over 90 causative genes. Mutations in neurofilament light polypeptide gene, NEFL cause CMT2E, an axonal form of CMT that results in abnormal structures and/or functions of peripheral axons in spinal cord motor neurons and dorsal root ganglion neurons. We have previously generated and characterized a knock-in mouse model of CMT2E with the N98S mutation in Nefl that presented with multiple inclusions in spinal cord neurons. In this report, we conduct immunofluorescence studies of cultured dorsal root ganglia (DRG) from NeflN98S/+ mice, and show that inclusions found in DRG neurites can occur in embryonic stages. Ultrastructural analyses reveal that the inclusions are disordered neurofilaments packed in high density, segregated from other organelles. Immunochemical studies show decreased NFL protein levels in DRG, cerebellum and spinal cord in NeflN98S/+ mice, and total NFL protein pool is shifted toward the triton-insoluble fraction. Our findings reveal the nature of the inclusions in NeflN98S/+ mice, provide useful information to understand mechanisms of CMT2E disease, and identify DRG from NeflN98S/+ mice as a useful cell line model for therapeutic discoveries."
https://openalex.org/W2672888891,"Agricultural usage of phosphorus (P) is largely driven by the amount of P removed from fields in harvested plant matter as offtake needs to be balanced by P fertilizer application. Reducing P concentration in grains is a way to decrease P offtake and reduce P fertilizer requirements or soil P mining where insufficient P is applied. Our objective was to assesses the genotypic variation for grain P concentration present within the rice gene pool and resolve to what extent it is affected by environment (P supply) or associated with genetic factors. About 2-fold variation in grain P concentrations were detected in two rice diversity panels, however, environmental effects were stronger than genotype effects. Genome wide association studies identified several putative loci associated with grain P concentrations. In most cases this was caused by minor haplotype associations with high grain P concentrations while associations with reduced P concentrations were identified on chromosomes 1, 6, 8, 11 and 12. Only the latter type of locus is of interest in breeding for reduced P concentrations and the most promising locus was at 20.7 Mb on chromosome 8, where a rare haplotype that was absent from all modern varieties studied reduced grain P concentration by 9.3%. This and all other loci were not consistently detected across environments or association panels, confirming that genetic effects were small compared to effects of environment. We conclude that the genetic effects detected were not sufficiently large or consistent to be of utility in plant breeding. Instead breeding efforts may have to rely on small to medium effect mutants already identified and attempt to achieve a more pronounced reduction in grain P concentration through the introgression of these mutants into a single genetic background."
https://openalex.org/W2730597608,"Here we characterize the modification-dependent restriction enzyme (MDE) EcoBLMcrX in vivo, in vitro and in its genomic environment. MDE cleavage of modified DNAs protects prokaryote populations from lethal infection by bacteriophage with highly modified DNA, and also stabilizes lineages by reducing gene import when sparse modification occurs in the wrong context. The function and distribution of MDE families are thus important. Here we describe the properties of EcoBLMcrX, an enzyme of the E. coli B lineage, in vivo and in vitro. Restriction in vivo and the genome location of its gene, ecoBLmcrX, were determined during construction and sequencing of a B/K-12 hybrid, ER2566. In classical restriction literature, this B system was named r6 or rglAB. Like many genome defense functions, ecoBLmcrX is found within a genomic island, where gene content is variable among natural E. coli isolates. In vitro, EcoBLMcrX was compared with two related enzymes, BceYI and NhoI. All three degrade fully cytosine-modified phage DNA, as expected for EcoBLMcrX from classical T4 genetic data. A new method of characterizing MDE specificity was developed to better understand action on fully-modified targets such as the phage that provide major evolutionary pressure for MDE maintenance. These enzymes also cleave plasmids with m5C in particular motifs, consistent with a role in lineage-stabilization. The recognition sites were characterized using a site-ranking approach that allows visualization of preferred cleavage sites when fully-modified substrates are digested. A technical constraint on the method is that ligation of one-nucleotide 5' extensions favors G:C over A:T approximately five-fold. Taking this bias into account, we conclude that EcoBLMcrX can cleave 3' to the modified base in the motif Rm5C|. This is compatible with, but less specific than, the site reported by others. Highly-modified site contexts, such as those found in base-substituted virulent phages, are strongly preferred."
https://openalex.org/W2731494672,"The Sardinella aurita fishery off northeastern Venezuela, region of seasonal wind-driven coastal-upwelling, accounts for 90% of the Caribbean Sea small pelagic catch. This law-protected artisanal fishery takes place up to ~10 km offshore. The spatial distribution, number of schools, and biomass of S. aurita were studied using eight hydro-acoustic surveys (1995–1998). The study included the analysis of satellite-derived sea surface temperature and chlorophyll-a. Surveys were grouped by strong, weak, and transitional upwelling seasons. Relationships between these observations were analyzed using Generalized Additive Models. Results show that during the primary upwelling season (January-May) sardines were widely distributed in upwelling plumes that extended up to 70 km offshore. In the other hand, during the weak upwelling season (September-October) higher sardine densities were found within 10 Km off the coastal upwelling foci. The number of small pelagic schools was directly correlated with small pelagic densities; however, regardless of the season, higher numbers of small pelagic schools were always closer to the shoreline, especially during warm conditions. These two behaviors increase the availability and catchability of sardines for the artisanal fishery during the warm season, regardless of the total stock size. Using this evidence, we pose the hypothesis that the collapse of the regional S. aurita fishery in 2005 was due to a combination of stressful habitat conditions sustained since 2004. These included bottom-up factors due to food scarcity caused by weak upwelling, combined with top-down stress due to overfishing, as sardines accumulated in narrow diminished upwelling plumes located close to the coast. The increased catchability within easily accessible upwelling foci led to the demise of this biological resource, which as of 2014 had not yet recovered. Environmental conditions affecting the sardine habitat needs to be taken into account for the management of this stock. For example, during years with weak upwelling, special measures should be taken during the warm season on the second half of the year to avoid further pressure on the stock."
https://openalex.org/W2687223092,"A simple and reliable method for the detection of specific nitrogen-fixing bacteria in both free-living and bacteroid forms is essential for the development and application of biofertilizer. Traditionally, a polyclonal antibody generated from an immunized rabbit was used for detection. However, the disadvantages of using a polyclonal antibody include limited supply and cross-reactivity to related bacterial strains. This is the first report on the application of phage display technology for the generation of a rabbit recombinant monoclonal antibody for specific detection and monitoring of nitrogen-fixing bacteria in both free-living form and in plant nodules. Bradyrhizobium sp. DOA9, a broad host range soil bacteria, originally isolated from the root nodules of Aeschynomene americana in Thailand was used as a model in this study. A recombinant single-chain fragment variable (scFv) antibody library was constructed from the spleen of a rabbit immunized with DOA9. After three rounds of biopanning, one specific phage-displayed scFv antibody, designated bDOA9rb8, was identified. Specific binding of this antibody was confirmed by phage enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (phage ELISA). The phage antibody could bind specifically to DOA9 in both free-living cells (pure culture) and bacteroids inside plant nodules. In addition to phage ELISA, specific and robust immunofluorescence staining of both free-living and bacteroid forms could also be observed by confocal-immunofluorescence imaging, without cross-reactivity with other tested bradyrhizobial strains. Moreover, specific binding of free scFv to DOA9 was also demonstrated by ELISA. This recombinant antibody can also be used for the study of the molecular mechanism of plant–microbe interactions in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2728751761,"Background and objective Respiration is known to affect cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) movement. We hypothesised that increased inspiratory resistance would affect the dynamic relationship between blood pressure (BP) changes and subarachnoid space width (SAS) oscillations. Methods Experiments were performed in a group of 20 healthy volunteers undergoing controlled intermittent Mueller Manoeuvres (the key characteristic of the procedure is that a studied person is subjected to a controlled, increased inspiratory resistance which results in marked potentiation of the intrathoracic negative pressure). BP and heart rate (HR) were measured using continuous finger-pulse photoplethysmography; oxyhaemoglobin saturation with an ear-clip sensor; end-tidal CO2 with a gas analyser; cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV), pulsatility and resistive indices with Doppler ultrasound. Changes in SAS were recorded with a new method i.e. near-infrared transillumination/backscattering sounding. Wavelet transform analysis was used to assess the BP and SAS oscillations coupling. Results Initiating Mueller manoeuvres evoked cardiac SAS component decline (-17.8%, P<0.001), systolic BP, diastolic BP and HR increase (+6.3%, P<0.001; 6.7%, P<0.001 and +2.3%, P<0.05, respectively). By the end of Mueller manoeuvres, cardiac SAS component and HR did not change (+2.3% and 0.0%, respectively; both not statistically significant), but systolic and diastolic BP was elevated (+12.6% and +8.9%, respectively; both P<0.001). With reference to baseline values there was an evident decrease in wavelet coherence between BP and SAS oscillations at cardiac frequency in the first half of the Mueller manoeuvres (-32.3%, P<0.05 for left hemisphere and -46.0%, P<0.01 for right hemisphere) which was followed by subsequent normalization at end of the procedure (+3.1% for left hemisphere and +23.1% for right hemisphere; both not statistically significant). Conclusions Increased inspiratory resistance is associated with swings in the cardiac contribution to the dynamic relationship between BP and SAS oscillations. Impaired cardiac performance reported in Mueller manoeuvres may influence the pattern of cerebrospinal fluid pulsatility."
https://openalex.org/W2733246123,"The development of high-throughput biomolecular technologies has resulted in generation of vast omics data at an unprecedented rate. This is transforming biomedical research into a big data discipline, where the main challenges relate to the analysis and interpretation of data into new biological knowledge. The aim of this study was to develop a framework for biomedical big data analytics, and apply it for analyzing transcriptomics time series data from early differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells towards the mesoderm and cardiac lineages. To this end, transcriptome profiling by microarray was performed on differentiating human pluripotent stem cells sampled at eleven consecutive days. The gene expression data was analyzed using the five-stage analysis framework proposed in this study, including data preparation, exploratory data analysis, confirmatory analysis, biological knowledge discovery, and visualization of the results. Clustering analysis revealed several distinct expression profiles during differentiation. Genes with an early transient response were strongly related to embryonic- and mesendoderm development, for example CER1 and NODAL. Pluripotency genes, such as NANOG and SOX2, exhibited substantial downregulation shortly after onset of differentiation. Rapid induction of genes related to metal ion response, cardiac tissue development, and muscle contraction were observed around day five and six. Several transcription factors were identified as potential regulators of these processes, e.g. POU1F1, TCF4 and TBP for muscle contraction genes. Pathway analysis revealed temporal activity of several signaling pathways, for example the inhibition of WNT signaling on day 2 and its reactivation on day 4. This study provides a comprehensive characterization of biological events and key regulators of the early differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells towards the mesoderm and cardiac lineages. The proposed analysis framework can be used to structure data analysis in future research, both in stem cell differentiation, and more generally, in biomedical big data analytics."
https://openalex.org/W2726253302,"Breakthrough cancer Pain (BTcP) has a high prevalence in cancer population. Patients with BTcP reported relevant health care costs and poor quality of life. The study assessed the cost-effectiveness of the available Oral Fentanyl Formulations (OFFs) for BTcP in Italy. A decision-analytical model was developed to estimate costs and benefits associated with treatments, from the Italian NHS perspective. Expected reductions in pain intensity per BTcP episodes were translated into, percentage of BTcP reduction, resource use and Quality-Adjusted-Life-Years (QALYs). Relative efficacy, resources used and unit costs data were derived from the literature and validated by clinical experts. Probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analyses were performed. At base-case analysis, Sublingual Fentanyl Citrate (FCSL) compared to other oral formulations reported a lower patient's cost (€1,960.8) and a higher efficacy (18.7% of BTcP avoided and 0.0507 QALYs gained). The sensitivity analyses confirmed the main results in all tested scenarios, with the highest impact reported by BTcP duration and health care resources consumption parameters. Between OFFs, FCSL is the cost-effective option due to faster reduction of pain intensity. However, new research is needed to better understand the economic and epidemiologic impact of BTcP, and to collect more robust data on economic and quality of life impact of the different fentanyl formulations. Different fentanyl formulations are available to manage BTcP in cancer population. The study is the first that assesses the different impact in terms of cost and effectiveness of OFFs, providing new information to better allocate the resources available to treat BTcP and highlighting the need of better data."
https://openalex.org/W2732405407,"The precise etiology of preeclampsia is unknown. Family studies indicate that both genetic and environmental factors influence its development. One of these factors is NFkB, whose activation depends on NEMO (NFkB essential modulator. This is the first study to investigate the association between the existence of single nucleotide variant of the NEMO gene and the appearance of preeclampsia. A total of 151 women (72 preeclamptic women and 79 controls) and their children were examined. Sanger sequencing was performed to identify variants in the NEMO gene in the preeclamptic mothers. The maternal identified variants were then sought in the studied groups of children, and in the maternal and child controls, using RFLP-PCR. Real-time RT-PCR was performed to assess NEMO gene expression in maternal blood, umbilical cord blood and placentas. The sequencing process indicated the existence of two different variants in the 3'UTR region of the NEMO gene of preeclamptic women (IKBKG:c.*368C>A and IKBKG:c.*402C>T). The simultaneous occurrence of the TT genotype in the mother and the TT genotype in the daughter or a T allele in the son increased the risk of preeclampsia development 2.59 fold. Additionally, we found that the configuration of maternal/fetal genotypes (maternal TT/ daughter TT or maternal TT/son T) of IKBKG:c.*402C/T variant is associated with the level of NEMO gene expression. Our results showed that, the simultaneous occurrence of the maternal TT genotype (IKBKG:c.*402C>T variants) and TT genotype in the daughter or T allele in the son correlates with the level of NEMO gene expression and increases the risk of preeclampsia development. Our observations may offer a new insight into the genetic etiology and pathogenesis of preeclampsia."

A multicenter qualitative study with four patients included due to the rare combination of hereditary ataxia and ITB therapy was designed to elucidate participants’ experiences through semi-structured interviews. The transcribed text was analyzed according to content analysis guidelines. Overall we identified living in the present/ taking one day at a time as the main theme covering the following categories: 1) Uncertainty about the future as a consequence of living with a hereditary disease; The disease; 2) Impact on life as a whole, 3) Influence on personal life in terms of feeling forced to terminate employment, 4) Limiting daily activities, and 5) ITB therapy, advantages, and disadvantages. Uncertainty about the future was the category that affected participants’ personal life, employment, and daily activities. The participants’ experience of receiving ITB therapy was expressed in terms of improved quality of life due to better body position and movement as well as better sleep and pain relief."
https://openalex.org/W2730144229,"Tibet is a highly hepatitis B virus (HBV) endemic area. Two types of C/D recombinant HBV are commonly isolated in Tibet and have been previously described. In an effort to better understand the molecular characteristic of these C/D recombinant strains from Tibet, we undertook a multistage random sampling project to collect HBsAg positive samples. Molecular epidemiological and bio-informational technologies were used to analyze the characteristics of the sequences found in this study. There were 60 samples enrolled in the survey, and we obtained 19 whole-genome sequences. 19 samples were all C/D recombinant, and could be divided into two sub-types named C/D1 and C/D2 according to the differences in the location of the recombinant breakpoint. The recombination breakpoint of the 10 strains belonging to the C/D1 sub-type was located at nt750, while the 9 stains belonging to C/D2 had their recombination break point at nt1530. According to whole-genome sequence analysis, the 19 identified strains belong to genotype C, but the nucleotide distance was more than 5% between the 19 strains and sub-genotypes C1 to C15. The distance between C/D1with C2 was 5.8±2.1%, while the distance between C/D2 with C2 was 6.4±2.1%. The parental strain was most likely sub-genotype C2. C/D1 strains were all collected in the middle and northern areas of Tibet including Lhasa, Linzhi and Ali, while C/D2 was predominant in Shannan in southern Tibet. This indicates that the two recombinant genotypes are regionally distributed in Tibet. These results provide important information for the study of special HBV recombination events, gene features, virus evolution, and the control and prevention policy of HBV in Tibet."
https://openalex.org/W2674025968,"Although sedation esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) is now widely used, previous research has reported that sedation during EGD exhibits a negative effect on esophagogastric junction (EGJ) exposure. Atropine might improve EGJ exposure, as noted in clinical practice. The aim of this study was to examine whether sedation had a negative effect on EGJ observation in the Chinese population, and whether atropine had some ability to act as an antidote to this unexpected secondary effect of sedation.In this cross-sectional study, subjects were divided into the following three groups according to the methods of EGD examination: the non-sedation group, the propofol-fentanyl combined sedation group and the combined sedation with atropine administration group. The EGJ observation was assessed by a key photograph taken with the endoscopic camera 1 cm from the EGJ, which was rated on the following four-degree scale: excellent (score = 4), good (score = 3), fair (score = 2) and poor (score = 1).The EGJ exposure was better in the sedation group administered atropine (score = 2.64±1.05) than in the sedation group (score = 1.99±1.08, P<0.05) but not as good as in the non-sedation group (score = 3.24±1.12, P<0.05). Reduced detection of EGJ diseases in the sedation group was also found, compared to the non-sedation group (P<0.05). Only the use of atropine (OR = 2.381, 95%CI: 1.297-4.371, P = 0.005) was independently associated with excellent observation of the EGJ during sedation EGD.Combined propofol-fentanyl sedation reduces the extent of exposure of the EGJ during EGD and reduces the detection of EGJ diseases. The application of atropine in the sedation endoscopy examination helped to achieve better EGJ observation, but still cannot achieve an equal extent of exposure compared to non-sedation EGD."
https://openalex.org/W2726091305,"SK-UT-1 uterine leiomyosarcomas (Ut-LMS) cells were transduced with a fatty acid synthase (FASN)-containing retroviral vector to recapitulate the “lipogenic phenotype of cancer.” Consistent with this model, forced expression of FASN enhanced SK-UT-1 proliferation, migration, and cellular motion. Further investigation showed FASN promotes trimethylation of H3K9 (H3K9me3) and acetylation of H3K27 (H3K27ac) in SK-UT-1 cells. In contrast, siRNA targeting of FASN in high endogenous FASN expressing SK-LMS-1 Ut-LMS cells inhibits trimethylation of H3K9 and acetylation of H3K27. Palmitate, the predominant fatty acid product of FASN, increased H3K9me3, H3K27ac and H3K27me3 detection in SK-UT-1 cells. FASN promoted histone 3 methylation and acetylation through alteration of histone 3-modifying enzymatic activities (HDAC, HDM, HMT and HAT). ChIP-seq in SK-UT-1-FASN cells with anti-H3K9me3 antibody identified regions of enriched binding compared to vector-only cells. One differentially-enriched gene, CRISP1, was investigated further by ChIP-PCR. The transcriptionally repressive function of H3K9me3 was confirmed in CRISP1. Our results provide mechanistic insight into the pathobiology of the “lipogenic phenotype of cancer.” Here, FASN reprograms the Ut-LMS epigenome through chromatin remodeling to promote the “malignant phenotype.”"
https://openalex.org/W2725110305,"Two variants of the two-component Lantibiotic Lichenicidin, produced by the strains B. Licheniformis VK21 and I89 (Lchα/ Lchβ and Bliα/ Bliβ peptides, respectively) have been investigated by means of 2 μs-long all-atom molecular dynamics simulations combined with Markov State Models. This rigorous statistical analysis enabled to evaluate the dynamic and kinetic properties of the aforementioned systems which are not accessible via experimental techniques. The structural flexibility characteristic of these small peptides is understood by a delicate equilibrium between random coil, α-helices and β-sheet structures. The undergoing secondary structure transitions from an α-helix to a β-sheet observed for Lchα and Lchβ peptides, were not present in the Bliα component and provide new insights to understand their mechanism of action."
https://openalex.org/W2716078583,"Protein α-helical coiled coil structures are known to induce antibodies able to block critical functions in different pathogens. In a previous study, a total of 50 proteins of Plasmodium vivax erythrocytic asexual stages containing α-helical coiled coil structural motifs were identified in silico, and the corresponding peptides were chemically synthesized. A total of 43 peptides were recognized by naturally acquired antibodies in plasma samples from both Papua New Guinea (PNG) and Colombian adult donors. In this study, the association between IgG antibodies to these peptides and clinical immunity was further explored by measuring total IgG antibody levels to 24 peptides in baseline samples from a longitudinal study of children aged 1-3 years (n = 164) followed for 16 months. Samples were reactive to all peptides tested. Eight peptides were recognized by >50% of individuals, whereas only one peptide had < 20% reactivity. Children infected at baseline were seropositive to 23/24 peptides. No significant association was observed between antibody titers and age or molecular force of infection, suggesting that antibody levels had already reached an equilibrium. There was a strong association between antibody levels to all peptides and protection against P. vivax clinical episodes during the 16 months follow-up. These results suggest that the selected coiled coil antigens might be good markers of both exposure and acquired immunity to P. vivax malaria, and further preclinical investigation should be performed to determine their potential as P. vivax vaccine antigens."
https://openalex.org/W2642618664,"Aims Chronic allograft nephropathy is a worldwide issue with the major feature of progressive allograft fibrosis, eventually ending with graft loss. Adenosine has been demonstrated to play an important role in process of fibrosis. Our study aimed to investigate the relationship between adenosine and fibrosis in renal allograft acute rejection in rat. Materials and methods Wistar rats and SD rats were selected as experimental animals. Our study designed two groups. In the allograft transplantation group, kidneys of Wistar rats were orthotopically transplanted into SD rat recipients, the same species but not genetically identical, to induce acute rejection. Kidney transplantations of SD rats to SD rats which were genetically identical were served as the control. We established rat models and detected a series of indicators. All data were analyzed statistically. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results Compared with the control group, levels of adenosine increased significantly in the allograft transplantation group, in which acute rejection was induced (P<0.05). Progressive allograft fibrosis as well as collagen deposition were observed. Conclusions These findings suggested that level of adenosine was upregulated in acute rejection after kidney allograft transplantation in rat. Acute rejection may promote renal allograft fibrosis via the adenosine signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2733926122,"Purpose Herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) causes genital herpes, one of the most common sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in the U.S. HSV-1, commonly associated with cold sores, is increasing as a cause of genital herpes. Abstinence-only sexual health classes, commonly taught in Virginia, generate young adults who are under-educated in sexual health, increasing STI risks. College students in southwest Virginia were surveyed to assess comprehensiveness of high school health education regarding HSV-1 and HSV-2 and to identify students’ preferred methods for STI education. Methods To obtain data on knowledge of HSV, comprehensiveness of sexual health education in high school, and preferred learning methods, 237 college students participated in an online questionnaire and 28 students were interviewed using structured interviews. Results Questionnaire and interview data indicated that Family Life Education classes need to include more comprehensive information on prevention, viral transmission, and differences between HSV-1 and HSV-2. The majority of total respondents (both the questionnaire and interview) (65%) reported non-comprehensive high school sexual health education. The majority of interview (79%) and questionnaire (55%) respondents wished they had learned more about herpes and other STIs in high school. Education preferences of both interviewed and surveyed respondents included interactive internet programs or games, more realistic lectures, and learning about STIs later in high school when students reported greater sexual activity. Conclusion Our results indicate that more comprehensive sexual health education is needed and wanted by students in southwest Virginia. More relevant educational programs should be implemented for VA high school students utilizing technology and interactive methods to improve student engagement in sexual health education. Implications and contribution These studies provide information on knowledge of herpes simplex viruses among college students, comprehensiveness of sexual health education received in high schools, and preferred methods to learn about HSV and other STIs. These studies inform the facilitation of improved health education practices and programs for high school and college students."
