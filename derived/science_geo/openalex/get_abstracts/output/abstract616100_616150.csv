The bandgap of organic semiconductors can be tuned over a wide range, but, for a two-terminal device that directly connects the cells, the currents produced must be nearly equal. Meng et al. used a semiempirical analysis to choose well-matched top- and bottom-cell active layers. They used solution processing to fabricate an inverted tandem device that has a power conversion efficiency as high as 17.4%. Science , this issue p. 1094"

In the context of human cancer, it defines the identities of malignant cells and the diversity of tumor tissue. We studied 72,501 single-cell transcriptomes of human renal tumors and normal tissue from fetal, pediatric, and adult kidneys. We matched childhood Wilms tumor with specific fetal cell types, thus providing evidence for the hypothesis that Wilms tumor cells are aberrant fetal cells. In adult renal cell carcinoma, we identified a canonical cancer transcriptome that matched a little-known subtype of proximal convoluted tubular cell. Analyses of the tumor composition defined cancer-associated normal cells and delineated a complex vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling circuit. Our findings reveal the precise cellular identities and compositions of human kidney tumors."

Kalhor et al. engineered a mouse line carrying 60 independent loci of hgRNAs, thus generating a large number of unique barcodes in various embryonic and extraembryonic tissues in fully developed mice. This method demonstrates lineage tracing from the very first branches of the development tree up to organogenesis events and was used to elucidate embryonic brain patterning.

We estimated the number of overweight and obese pregnant women among 184 countries and determined the time-related trend from 2005 to 2014. Based on panel data model, we determined the effects of food energy supply, urbanization, gross national income and female employment on the number of overweight and obese pregnant women.We estimated that 38.9 million overweight and obese pregnant women and 14.6 million obese pregnant women existed globally in 2014. In upper middle income countries and lower middle income countries, there were sharp increases in the number of overweight and obese pregnant women. In 2014, the percentage of female with overweight and obesity in India was 21.7%, and India had the largest number of overweight and obese pregnant women (4.3 million), which accounted for 11.1% in the world. In the United States of America, a third of women were obese, and the number of obese pregnant women was 1.1 million. In high income countries, caloric supply and urbanization were positively associated with the number of overweight and obese pregnant women. The percentage of employment in agriculture was inversely associated with the number of overweight and obese pregnant women, but only in upper middle income countries and lower middle income countries.The number of overweight and obese pregnant women has increased in high income and middle income countries. Environmental changes could lead to increased caloric supply and decreased energy expenditure among women. National and local governments should work together to create a healthy food environment."
https://openalex.org/W2887272845,"A complex implicated in kidney health Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a common genetic disease that can lead to kidney failure. Mutations in the proteins PKD1 and PKD2 are linked to the disease, but the function of these proteins remains unclear, both in physiology and disease. PKD1 has been implicated in the sensing of chemical and mechanical force stimuli, and PKD2 is proposed to be a calcium ion channel. Su et al. show that the transmembrane regions form a PKD1-PKD2 complex assembled in a 1:3 ratio. Their high-resolution cryo–electron microscopy structure confirms that the complex adopts transient receptor potential channel architecture, with some distinctive features. Mapping disease-causing mutations onto the structure suggests that pathogenesis may come from incorrect folding or trafficking of the complex rather than from disruption of channel activity.

Lacteals are lymphatic vessels that act as the highway for chylomicron transport, but it is unclear how passage occurs. Zhang et al. report that two endothelial cell receptors, neuropilin-1 (NRP1) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 (VEGFR1, also known as FLT1), are required to convert the entry spaces between lacteals from open junctions to closed, zipped structures (see the Perspective by McDonald).

https://openalex.org/W2885626252,"Delayed gingival wound healing is widely observed in periodontal patients with diabetes. However, the molecular mechanisms of the impaired function of gingival fibroblasts in diabetes remain unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate changes in the properties of human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs) under high-glucose conditions. Primary HGFs were isolated from healthy gingiva and cultured with 5.5, 25, 50, and 75 mM glucose for 72 h. In vitro wound healing, 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU), and water-soluble tetrazolium salt (WST-8) assays were performed to examine cell migration and proliferation. Lactase dehydrogenase (LDH) levels were measured to determine cytotoxicity. The mRNA expression levels of oxidative stress markers were quantified by real-time PCR. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) were also measured in live cells. The antioxidant N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC, 1 mM) was added to evaluate the involvement of ROS in the glucose effect on HGFs. As a result, the in vitro wound healing assay showed that high glucose levels significantly reduced fibroblast migration and proliferation at 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h. The numbers of cells positive for EdU staining were decreased, as was cell viability, at 50 and 75 mM glucose. A significant increase in LDH was proportional to the glucose concentration. The mRNA levels of heme oxygenase-1 and superoxide dismutase-1 and ROS levels were significantly increased in HGFs after 72 h of exposure to 50 mM glucose concentration. The addition of NAC diminished the inhibitory effect of high glucose in the in vitro wound healing assay. The results of the present study show that high glucose impairs the proliferation and migration of HGFs. Fibroblast dysfunction may therefore be caused by high glucose-induced oxidative stress and may explain the delayed gingival wound healing in diabetic patients."

By using fluorescent probes and microscopy, Cheng and Ferrell show that in frog eggs (which are very large cells), waves of apoptotic signals can be seen passing through the egg cytoplasm. The pathways that trigger cell death have positive feedback loops that lead to self-regenerating waves. The speed of the waves (∼30 micrometers per minute) is too fast to be explained by diffusion.

Those that now live in the marine environment have had to adapt to the particular selective pressures that this environment imposes. Meyer et al. surveyed the genomes of several marine mammal species to identify regions of convergent change. Multiple losses of the Paraoxonase 1 gene are evident in marine mammals, likely resulting from remodeling of lipid metabolism or antioxidant networks. The multiple occurrences of this loss of function across taxa indicate an evolutionary benefit. However, Paraoxonase 1 is the primary mammalian defense against organophosphorus toxicity. Marine mammals may be at a great disadvantage in the Anthropocene if run-off of this agricultural product into the marine environment continues. Science , this issue p. 591"
https://openalex.org/W2886501130,"During navigation, hippocampal spatial maps are thought to interact with action-planning systems in other regions of cortex. We here report a key role for spike-time coordination in functional coupling of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) to the hippocampus through the thalamic nucleus reuniens (NR). When rats perform a T-maze alternation task, spikes of neurons in mPFC and NR exhibit enhanced coordination to the CA1 theta rhythm before the choice point on the maze. A similar coordination to CA1 theta rhythm was observed in neurons of the supramammillary nucleus (SUM). Optogenetic silencing of SUM neurons reduced the temporal coordination in the mPFC-NR-CA1 circuit. Following SUM inactivation, trajectory representations were impaired in both NR and CA1, but not in mPFC, indicating a failure in transmission of action plans from mPFC to the hippocampus. The findings identify theta-frequency spike-time coordination as a mechanism for gating of information flow in the mPFC-NR-CA1 circuit."

Little attention has been paid to changing physicians' prescribing behavior. Using a randomized controlled trial format, Doctor et al. monitored the effect of notifying physicians who had a patient die of opioid overdose within 12 months of a prescription. The physicians received an injunction to prescribe safely from their county's medical examiner. This intervention led to reductions in high-intensity prescribing, reductions in the likelihood that an opioid-naïve patient received a prescription, and a reduction in overall cumulative opioid intake.

https://openalex.org/W2887723978,"How is neuronal activity across distant brain regions orchestrated to allow multiple stimuli to be stored together in working memory, yet maintained separate for individual readout and protection from distractors? Using paired recordings in the prefrontal and parietal cortex of monkeys discriminating numbers of items (numerosities), we found that working memory content is structured by frequency-specific oscillatory synchrony. Parieto-frontal signaling in the beta band carried information about the most recent numerical input. Fronto-parietal coupling in the theta band differentiated between multiple memorized numerosities. Task-relevant and distracting stimuli were nested in spiking activity of single prefrontal neurons, but could be separated by reading out spikes at distinct phases of parietal theta oscillations. The strength of phase-locked, cross-regional memory coding predicted task performance. Frequency-specific communication channels in the fronto-parietal network could enable serial bottom-up and parallel top-down information transmission, providing an important mechanism to protect working memory from interference."
https://openalex.org/W2887047452,"Vanadium (V) can be absorbed by plants and regulate their growth and development, although contrasting effects have been reported among species and handling conditions. The objective of this work was to evaluate the beneficial effect of V on pepper plants (Capsicum annuum L.). The plants were grown in a hydroponic system with the application of four V concentrations (0, 5, 10, and 15 μM NH₄VO₃). Four weeks after the beginning of the treatments, growth, flowering, biomass, chlorophyll concentration, total amino acids, total soluble sugars, and nutrients were determined in leaves, stems, and roots. The application of 5 μM V increased plant growth, induced floral bud development, and accelerated flowering. The chlorophyll concentration varied according to the type of plant part analyzed. The concentrations of amino acids and sugars in leaves and roots were higher with 5 μM. With 10 and 15 μM V, the plants were smaller and showed toxicity symptoms. The K concentration in leaves decreased as the V dose increased (0 to 15 μM). However, 5 μM V increased the concentrations of N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Cu, Mn, and B, exclusively in stems. The application of 15 μM V decreased the concentrations of Mg and Mn in leaves, but increased those of P, Ca, Mg, Cu, and B in roots. We conclude that V has positive effects on pepper growth and development, as well as on the concentrations of amino acids and total sugars. V was antagonistic with K, Mg, and Mn in leaves, while in stems and roots, there was synergism with macro and micronutrients. Vanadium is a beneficial element with the potential to be used in biostimulation approaches of crops like pepper."

Following the hypotheses (i) that the effects are mediated by conserved arginine(s) and (ii) that the PT is mediated by the F-ATP synthase, we have narrowed the search to 60 arginines. Most of these residues are located in subunits α, β, γ, ϵ, a, and c and were excluded because PGO modification did not significantly affect enzyme catalysis. On the other hand, yeast mitochondria lacking subunit g or bearing a subunit g R107A mutation were totally resistant to PT inhibition by PGO. Thus, the effect of PGO on the PT is specifically mediated by Arg-107, the only subunit g arginine that has been conserved across species.

The PT is mediated by opening of a regulated channel, the permeability transition pore (PTP), which coincides with the mitochondrial megachannel (MMC) identified by electrophysiology (2Kinnally K.W. Campo M.L. Tedeschi H. Mitochondrial channel activity studied by patch-clamping mitoplasts.J. Bioenerg.

The mammalian PTP/MMC displays a range of conductance states, which can be as high as 1.2 nanosiemens, corresponding to a pore with a diameter of about 2 nm. The channel also visits lower conductance states that may be the basis for selective permeation of small solutes (4Szabo I. Zoratti M. Mitochondrial channels: ion fluxes and more.Physiol.

Depending on open time and channel size, the PTP/MMC can participate in Ca2+ homeostasis (short-term and/or low-conductance openings that provide a pathway for fast Ca2+ release) (5Bernardi P. von Stockum S.

The mammalian PTP is modulated by binding of cyclophilin D (CyPD), which favors pore opening after matrix accumulation of Ca2+, an essential permissive factor (7Giorgio V. Guo L. Bassot C.

Regulation of the PTP is complex; opening is favored by CyPD, Pi, and oxidative stress, whereas it is inhibited by matrix H+, Mg2+, adenine nucleotides, and cyclosporin A, which displaces CyPD and desensitizes the pore to Ca2+ (8Bernardi P.

The most recent hypothesis about the molecular nature of the PTP/MMC is that it originates from a conformational change occurring on F-ATP synthase when Mg2+ is replaced by Ca2+ at the catalytic site.

Here, we have found that the effect of phenylglyoxal (PGO) on the PTP differs between species and used sequence comparison and mutagenesis to identify the unique arginine of F-ATP synthase subunit g (of a total of 60 conserved residues) that mediates the PTP-modulating effect of PGO in yeast. This finding is a step forward in the molecular understanding of PTP regulation and further supports the hypothesis that the PTP forms from F-ATP synthase. Consistent with the effect of PGO on the PTP of rat liver mitochondria, PGO desensitized the PTP to Ca2+ in mouse liver mitochondria (MLM) (Fig. 1A) as well as in mitochondria from Saccharomyces cerevisiae in the presence of ETH129, a selective ionophore that allows Ca2+ equilibration across the inner membrane in yeast mitochondria (Fig. 1B). In either case, the desensitizing effect can be appreciated from the increased Ca2+ retention capacity (CRC) of PGO-treated mitochondria (Fig. 1, A and B). Unexpectedly, PGO caused instead sensitization of the pore to Ca2+ in permeabilized human HEK293 (Fig. 1C) and Drosophila S2R+ cells (Fig. 1D). Sensitization of PTP opening by PGO in human and Drosophila cells was not due to digitonin permeabilization, as it was also observed in mitochondria isolated from these cells (results not shown). These findings indicate that the ability to modulate the PTP by PGO has been conserved across species. Under the assumptions (i) that the observed differences depend on specific features of the PTP rather than on the existence of species-specific reactive sites and (ii) that these sites are located on the F-ATP synthase, we narrowed the search of the reactive arginine(s) from 135 (yeast) to 60 arginines that are conserved between F-ATP synthases of S. cerevisiae, Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, and Drosophila melanogaster (the positions of these residues in the yeast, human, and mouse enzymes are reported in Table 1).Table 1Number and positions of arginine residues conserved between F-ATP synthase of S. cerevisiae, H. sapiens, and M. musculus (in parentheses when different)SubunitTotal numberPositions in S. cerevisiaePositions in H. sapiens (M. musculus)α264, 9, 67, 77, 127, 143, 163, 165, 176, 198, 201, 208, 225, 247, 295, 316, 323, 324, 328, 341, 345, 399, 410, 435, 457, 4605, 12, 73, 83, 133, 149, 169, 171, 182, 204, 207, 214, 231, 253, 301, 322, 329, 330, 334, 347, 351, 405, 416, 441, 463, 466β1793, 105, 127, 139, 223, 225, 262, 264, 277, 293, 307, 328, 370, 389, 439, 441, 445109, 121, 143, 155, 239, 241, 279, 281, 294, 310, 324, 345, 387, 406, 456, 458, 462γ74, 31, 42, 153, 266, 290, 2924, 23, 34, 143, 253, 277, 279a1186159c139c1: 99, c2: 104 (109), c3: 105 (104)ϵ25, 236, 24OSCP28, 11414, 117b1200208f15650 (44)e1815g110796Total606060 Open table in a new tab Due to the large number of arginine residues and their specific relevance to enzymatic activity of F-ATP synthase, we assessed whether treatment with PGO affects the catalytic properties of the enzyme in MLM and yeast mitochondria (YM). In MLM, a trend toward a slight inhibition of ATP hydrolysis was observed (but this did not reach statistical significance), and the catalytic activity maintained its sensitivity to oligomycin (Fig. 2A), and respiratory stimulation by ADP was not affected (Fig. 2B). Similarly, in YM, both ATP hydrolytic activity and respiratory stimulation by ADP were unaffected by PGO (Fig. 2, C and D). Blue native gel separation and in-gel activity staining after digitonin extraction did not reveal any major effect of PGO on F-ATP synthase oligomeric state in MLM (Fig. 2E). In these experiments, we used MLM because they are easy to purify and because the mouse enzyme is virtually identical to the human and yeast species for composition of conserved arginines (Table 1). Analysis of dimers and monomers resolved by SDS-PAGE and silver staining demonstrated that treatment with PGO did not alter the pattern and relative abundance of F-ATP synthase subunits (Fig. 2F). Based on these results, the arginine residues of the F1 sector, subunit a, and c-ring were not investigated further. Taking advantage of the yeast model and of the species-specific response to PGO, we performed a set of mutagenesis experiments in yeast cells to identify the arginine residue(s) conferring the modulatory effect to PGO. We first investigated whether OSCP, which contains two conserved arginine residues (Table 1), could be involved in conferring the species specificity to the effects of PGO, which are opposite in human and yeast mitochondria (Fig. 1). Deletion of the ATP5 gene encoding for OSCP (ΔATP5) prevented F-ATP synthase assembly and growth on glycerol, both features being rescued by reexpression of the WT yeast gene (ΔATP5 + yOSCP) (Fig. 3, A–C). Replacement with the human OSCP gene (ΔATP5 + hOSCP) was instead essentially unable to rescue F-ATP synthase assembly unless the yeast mitochondrial targeting sequence replaced the human sequence in the construct (ΔATP5 + yhOSCP). Indeed, only the chimeric protein allowed assembly of a functional F-ATP synthase complex, which grew normally on glycerol (Fig. 3, A–C). The rescued mutant displayed an increased CRC in response to PGO (i.e. the same response of WT yeast mitochondria) (Fig. 3D). Thus, OSCP does not confer species specificity to the effects of PGO on the PTP. Both subunit e and g possess a conserved arginine residue (Arg-8 and Arg-107 in the yeast sequence, respectively, Fig. 4). These residues correspond to Arg-15 and Arg-96, respectively, in the human sequence (Table 1). To test whether these residues are involved in PTP modulation by PGO, we first analyzed deletion mutants of subunit g (ΔATP20) and of subunit e (ΔTIM11). The effect of PGO was completely abolished in the ΔATP20 deletion mutant lacking subunit g (Fig. 5A), and a similar, albeit somewhat smaller, effect was observed with the ΔTIM11 mutant lacking subunit e (Fig. 5B). To explore the role of individual arginines, we generated specific point mutants and tested their CRC. Remarkably, the R107A mutation in subunit g dramatically blunted the effect of PGO (Fig. 5C), whereas the R8A mutation in subunit e was ineffective, with an identical sensitivity to PGO as the WT species (Fig. 5D). This result was puzzling because subunit e only has one conserved arginine in position 8, and therefore we would have expected the same result following either deletion of the subunit e gene or the R8A mutation. This apparent contradiction was resolved by analysis of the expression of the e and g subunits in the ΔATP20 and ΔTIM11 mutants. Indeed, deletion of the ATP20 gene led to the expected disappearance of subunit g only, whereas deletion of the TIM11 gene caused the disappearance of both subunit e and g (Fig. 5E). Both Arg-8 and Arg-107 are located next to the GXXXG dimerization domains (Figure 4., Figure 5.F), and we suspect that this is the region where the PTP forms.Figure 5.Arg-107 of yeast F-ATP synthase subunit g mediates the effects of PGO on the CRC.

Channel formation by yeast F-ATP synthase and the role of dimerization in the mitochondrial permeability transition.J. Biol.

Yeast cells can grow by fermentation in glucose-rich medium, whereas they need ATP generated from oxidative phosphorylation in glycerol medium. The ATP20 R107A mutant grew both on the glucose and glycerol (Fig. 6A), indicating that the mutation did not influence the function of F-ATP synthase. The ΔTIM11 and ΔATP20 mutants expectedly did not display dimers after digitonin extraction and blue native PAGE (Fig. 6B). Mitochondria reexpressing either WT or R107A subunit g had functional dimers indistinguishable from those of WT BY4743 cells (Fig. 6B) with identical subunit composition, as judged from SDS-PAGE and silver staining (Fig. 6C). Thus, the R107A replacement in subunit g did not influence the assembly, activity, and stability of F-ATP synthase. We next tested whether the PGO adduct affects the properties of the PTP. One emerging issue is pore size, which is affected by the deletion of lateral stalk subunits OSCP and b even when the CRC is apparently unaffected (24He J. Carroll J. Ding S. Fearnley I.M. Walker J.E. Permeability transition in human mitochondria persists in the absence of peripheral stalk subunits of ATP synthase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2017; 114 (10.1073/pnas.1711201114 28784775): 9086-9091Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). We therefore measured Ca2+-induced swelling in yeast mitochondria in the presence of ETH129 to allow electrophoretic Ca2+ uptake. The swelling rate was significantly inhibited by PGO in mitochondria reexpressing WT subunit g but not the R107A mutant, which displayed a lower rate of swelling (Fig. 7, A–C). Because yeast subunit g also contains an arginine residue at position 106, we employed synthetic test peptides corresponding to the 88–114 amino acid segment of WT or containing the R106A replacement. Following reaction with PGO, the peptides were analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS. The results revealed that one adduct with a molecular mass of 116 Da was formed on both the WT and the R106A modified peptide (Fig. 7D). This molecular mass corresponds to one molecule of PGO covalently attached to the guanidine moiety of arginine. Formation of one single adduct in the WT peptide carrying two adjacent arginines suggests that reaction of Arg-107 with PGO may reduce the reactivity of Arg-106. PGO desensitizes the yeast PTP to Ca2+ (thus increasing the CRC), whereas it sensitizes it in human HEK293 cells (thus decreasing the CRC; see Fig. 1). We exploited this phenotypic difference to test whether expression of human subunit g is able to switch the inhibitory effect of PGO in yeast mitochondria to the inducing effect seen in human mitochondria. Deletion of the ATP20 gene encoding for yeast subunit g prevented dimerization of F-ATP synthase, which could be rescued by both expression of ATP20 and of ATP5L (which encodes human subunit g) (Fig. 8A). As for WT yeast (compare with Fig. 1), PGO increased the CRC of ΔATP20 mitochondria reexpressing ATP20, whereas replacement with ATP5L totally prevented the desensitizing effects of PGO, which rather decreased the CRC (Fig. 8B), as also seen in permeabilized HEK293 cells. These results suggest that subunit g confers species specificity to the effects of PGO on the PTP.

In this study, we evaluated the roles of the endocytic pathway genes Clathrin heavy chain (Chc), Clathrin adaptor protein AP50, ADP ribosylation factor-like 1 (Arf72A), Vacuolar H+ ATPase 16 kDa subunit (Vha16), and small GTPase Rab7 and putative sid-1-like genes (silA and silC) in RNAi response in western corn rootworm (WCR) using a two-stage dsRNA exposure bioassay. Silencing of Chc, Vha16, and AP50 led to a significant decrease in the effects of laccase2 dsRNA reporter, indicating that these genes are involved in RNAi response. However, the knockdown of either Arf72A or Rab7 did not suppress the response to laccase2 dsRNA. The silencing of the silC gene did not lead to a significant reduction in mortality or increase in the expression of V-ATPase A reporter. While the silencing of the silA gene significantly decreased insect mortality, significant changes in V-ATPase A expression were not detected. These results suggest that clathrin-dependent endocytosis is a biological mechanism that plays an important role during RNAi response in WCR adults. The fact that no definitive support for the roles of silA or silC in RNAi response was obtained support the idea that RNAi response varies greatly in different insect species, demanding additional studies focused on elucidating their involvement in this mechanism."

Analogous activation pathways exist for Th1 and Th2 cells, which respond to signals from a STAT-activating factor plus an IL-1 family cytokine to induce transcription of effector cytokines. T helper 1 (TH1) cells exhibit robust IFN-γ production in response to stimulation with IL-12 plus IL-18 (14.Murphy K.M. Ouyang W. Farrar J.D. Yang J. Ranganath S. Asnagli H. Afkarian M. Murphy T.L.

IL-18 cannot itself induce Ifng; its role is in augmenting the effects of STAT4 on Th1 development (15.Robinson D. Shibuya K. Mui A. Zonin F. Murphy E. Sana T. Hartley S.B. Menon S. Kastelein R. Bazan F. O'Garra A.

IL-12 activates the transcription factors STAT4 and AP-1, and as an IL-1 family member, IL-18 has been demonstrated to activate the NF-κB pathway (18.Dinarello C.A. IL-18: A TH1-inducing, proinflammatory cytokine and new member of the IL-1 family.J. Allergy Clin.

These signals converge on sequences in and around the gene encoding IFN-γ to induce its expression. Balasubramani et al. (17.Balasubramani A. Shibata Y. Crawford G.E. Baldwin A.S. Hatton R.D.

Modular utilization of distal cis-regulatory elements controls Ifng gene expression in T cells activated by distinct stimuli.Immunity. 2010; 33 (20643337): 35-4710.1016/j.immuni.2010.07.004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) described differential utilization of cis-elements in the regulation of the Ifng contingent on the method of stimulus. Demonstration that IL-12–induced STAT4 is required to recruit the NF-κB factor RelA to key cis-regulatory elements for enhancement of Ifng transcription reinforces the notion that one aspect of IL-12 and IL-18 synergy is at the level of DNA binding. In this study, we report that multiple STAT-dependent enhancer elements govern Il17a/f expression, and we demonstrate that IL-1β not only heightens IL-23–induced STAT3 binding to these elements but also enables recruitment of STAT3 to additional regulatory sites contained within the extended Il17 locus and induces NF-κB factors that directly regulate Il17a/f transcription in collaboration with STAT3. Our data build on previous studies demonstrating that the IL-1 induced NF-κB pathway is operative in the reinforcement of STAT3 activation through effects on SOCS3 and Jak2 and determine that in addition to its involvement in early Th17 differentiation events, IL-1β serves to promote acute transcription of Il17a/f by exerting direct effects on these gene loci. We previously observed that treatment of Th17 effector cells with IL-1 (α or β) can induce IL-17 production independently of TCR stimulation in a manner dependent on STAT3, and we noted that IL-17 production was maximal when IL-1 and IL-23 were used in combination (11.Lee Y.K. Landuyt A.E. Lobionda S. Sittipo P. Zhao Q. Maynard C.L. TCR-independent functions of Th17 cells mediated by the synergistic actions of cytokines of the IL-12 and IL-1 families.PLoS One. 2017; 12 (29023599): e018635110.1371/journal.pone.0186351PubMed Google Scholar). In an effort to understand how IL-1 signaling could impact STAT3-dependent transcription of Il17a and Il17f, we first performed comparative long-range DNase I hypersensitivity (DHS) mapping of the murine Il17a—;Il17f gene locus in naïve and in vitro-polarized Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells to identify potential cis-regulatory elements (19.Crawford G.E. Davis S. Scacheri P.C. Renaud G. Halawi M.J. Erdos M.R. Green R. Meltzer P.S. Wolfsberg T.G. Collins F.S. DNase-chip: a high-resolution method to identify DNase I hypersensitive sites using tiled microarrays.Nat. Methods. 2006; 3 (16791207): 503-50910.1038/nmeth888Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Prominent DNase I HS peaks localized to an ∼200-kb region surrounding the Il17a/f genes (Fig. 1A). Naïve CD4+ cells as well as Th1 and Th2 cells were largely devoid of DNase I HS sites, but Th17 cells exhibited 13 discernable peak clusters that corresponded well with evolutionarily conserved noncoding sequences (CNS). Most of the hypersensitivity peaks were present in resting polarized Th17 cells, indicating that the majority of cis-regulatory elements in the Il17a/f locus are remodeled during Th17 differentiation. TCR stimulation of polarized Th17 cells, whether by anti-CD3 or the TCR signaling surrogate phorbol ester (PMA) plus ionomycin, induced additional hypersensitive sites at CNS elements A−97, A−37, and A+6, suggesting a role for these regions as acutely activated, stimulus-dependent Il17a/f enhancers. Although TCR stimulation induced alterations in chromatin structure at the aforementioned CNS, accessibility of these stimulus-dependent hypersensitivity sites was not induced by cytokine co-signaling (IL-23 + IL-1β); the accessibility profile of the extended Il17a/f locus in cytokine-stimulated cells closely mirrored that of resting Th17 cells, suggesting that signals downstream of the IL-23 and IL-1 receptors likely act on enhancer elements accessible in resting Th17 cells, and they are unlikely to act at CNSs A−97, A−37, and A+6. To verify that we had likely identified all cis-elements involved in the regulation of Il17a/f transcription, we probed the region for putative insulator elements by assessing the binding of the CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) and a subunit of its associated cohesin, Rad21. CTCF has been shown to be required for barrier and enhancer-blocking activities of many insulator elements (20.Dorsett D. Cohesin: genomic insights into controlling gene transcription and development.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2011; 21 (21324671): 199-20610.1016/j.gde.2011.01.018Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), and cohesin is hypothesized to organize chromatin structure in a manner that facilitates insulator function (21.Wendt K.S. Peters J.M. How cohesin and CTCF cooperate in regulating gene expression.Chromosome Res. 2009; 17 (19308701): 201-21410.1007/s10577-008-9017-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). We mapped CTCF and Rad21 sites by ChIP-chip (Fig. 1B) and found that strong signals for CTCF and Rad21 co-localized to only two sites in the extended Il17a/f locus: DNase I-hypersensitive sites (DHS) A−118 and F−13. DHS A−118 represents an evolutionarily-conserved sequence (CNS), but DHS F−13 lies in a region of noncoding DNA that lacks sequence conservation across species. The locations of these sites, flanking the Il17a/f loci beyond the most distal Th17-specific DNase-hypersensitive regions and situated in or adjacent to the neighboring genes Pkhd1 and Mcm3, respectively, are consistent with a role for A−118 and F−13 as boundary elements. Notably, CTCF and Rad21 binding at DHSs A−118 and F−13 were greatest in Th17 cells but were also evident in naïve CD4 and Th1 cells (Fig. 1C). Although all CTCF-binding sites exhibited Rad21 binding, we detected additional prominent Rad21-binding sites near regions of DNase hypersensitivity (A−34 and A+8) that did not correspond to areas of sequence conservation. It is possible that these regions represent foci of cohesin binding that attribute to cohesin's role in sister chromatid interactions and/or serve a distinct function in gene regulation. As a regulator of higher-order chromatin structure, cohesin contributes to the formation of chromatin loops (21.Wendt K.S. Peters J.M. How cohesin and CTCF cooperate in regulating gene expression.Chromosome Res. 2009; 17 (19308701): 201-21410.1007/s10577-008-9017-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 22.Lee G.R. Kim S.T.

In that regard, DNase I hypersensitivity at CNS A−118 was only induced in Th17 cells following activation by TCR or cytokine signaling, suggesting its possible participation in activation-dependent chromatin looping and/or cis-regulatory activity. To assess the function of the cis-elements identified in the Il17a/f locus, we utilized a promoter–reporter assay in primary murine Th17 cells. The indicated CNS elements were subcloned upstream of a minimal Il17a or Il17f promoter, and firefly luciferase expression from transfected cells was used as a surrogate for transcriptional activity. CNSs A−118, A−97, A−37, A+10, A+28, and F−7 exhibited significant enhancement of promoter activity upon restimulation with anti-CD3 (Fig. 2A), indicating an ability of these cis-elements to augment TCR-driven Il17a gene transcription. Enhancer activity was retained for CNSs A−97, −37, +10, and +28 under conditions of cytokine restimulation (Fig. 2B), with a significant increase in luciferase activity by addition of IL-1β over IL-23 alone. Similar data were obtained for all CNSs relative to a 295-bp fragment of the Il17f promoter (data not shown). We examined the enhancer CNS sequences for predicted transcription factor-binding sites and found that a composite STAT/Bcl6-binding site was unique to the four cis-elements that enhanced cytokine-driven Il17 transcription with CNS A+10 also possessing overlapping nuclear factor of activated T cells and NF-κB sites (Fig. S1). Based on this finding, as well as the knowledge that STAT3 is integral to Il17a/f transcription (23.Holland S.M. DeLeo F.R. Elloumi H.Z. Hsu A.P. Uzel G. Brodsky N. Freeman A.F. Demidowich A.

These mutations significantly diminished cytokine-driven enhancer activity for all of the CNSs tested (Fig. 2C), consistent with the capacity of these cis-elements to bind STAT3 and function in acute transcriptional regulation following cytokine stimulus. Previous studies have demonstrated STAT3 binding to cis-elements spanning 90 kb of the extended Il17a/f locus (26.Durant L. Watford W.T. Ramos H.L. Laurence A. Vahedi G. Wei L. Takahashi H. Sun H.W.

To confirm these results and assess for recruitment of STAT3 to genomic elements more distal, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis for STAT3 binding across a region encompassing ∼180 kb of sequence surrounding Il17a and Il17f. Consistent with previous reports, we detected STAT3 binding at CNSs A+10, A+28, and the Il17f promoter following stimulation with IL-23. (Fig. 2D). Notably, however, we found that addition of IL-1β had a marked effect on STAT3 binding across the locus; compared with stimulation with IL-23 alone, IL-23 plus IL-1β induced both significant increases in STAT3 recruitment to CNSs A+10 and A+28 and substantial STAT3 binding at A−97 and the Il17a promoter that was not detected in the absence of IL-1 signaling. Although enhancer activity associated with accessible sites at CNSs A−118, A−37, and F−7 did not exhibit STAT3 binding, it is likely that these elements exert effects on Il17a/f transcription through interactions with other transcription factors not yet identified. Collectively, these results indicate that enhancers at CNSs A−97, A+10, A+28, and the Il17a and Il17f promoters bind STAT3 to regulate Il17a/f transcription following activation, and factors induced by IL-1R signaling enhance STAT3 binding to key cis-regulatory elements participating in the Il17a/f transcription. Given the observation that IL-1 treatment enhanced STAT3 binding to cis-elements regulating Il17a/f expression, we wished to further examine the nature of the synergism between IL-1R and Jak/STAT signals. IL-1R signaling is initiated when IL-1α or IL-1β binds to the IL-1R1 subunit, enabling recruitment of an accessory receptor subunit, IL-1RAP. Ligand-induced juxtaposition of TIR domains on the cytoplasmic tails of IL-1R subunits recruits myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88 (MYD88), and subsequently IL-1R–associated kinase 4 (IRAK4), tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), as well as additional downstream signaling molecules (29.Sims J.E.

Activation of IL-1R signaling typically results in activation of the NF-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways (30.Suzuki N. Suzuki S. Yeh W.C.

We first assessed the NF-κB factors activated by IL-1 signaling in Th17 cells and compared the kinetics of NF-κB nuclear localization with that of STAT3 phosphorylation induced by concomitant IL-23 signaling (Fig. 3A and Fig. S2). We limited our study to RelA, c-Rel, and p50, as these NF-κB factors are expressed in T cells (33.Köntgen F. Grumont R.J. Strasser A. Metcalf D. Li R. Tarlinton D. Gerondakis S.

IL-1β triggered NF-κB nuclear import of NF-κB proteins RelA, c-Rel, and p50 and was not significantly altered by the addition of IL-23. Nuclear translocation of the NF-κB proteins took place within 10 min of cytokine exposure, and STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation occurred concordantly (8.Basu R. Whitley S.K. Bhaumik S. Zindl C.L.

Peak expression of NF-κB proteins in the nucleus of Th17 cells paralleled that of STAT3 activation, and expression of both NF-κB and STAT3 began to decline between 2 and 4 h following cytokine stimulus.

Despite the enormous health and social impact of adolescent pregnancy, there is a dearth of nationally representative studies on factors associated with adolescent pregnancies in Nepal. Therefore, this study aimed to examine trends and factors associated with adolescent pregnancies in Nepal, using pooled data of three nationally representative demographic surveys.Data for this study was derived from the recent three consecutive (2006, 2011 and 2016) Nepal Demographic and Health Surveys (NDHS). A total of 7,788 adolescent women aged 15-19 years included in the analysis. Trends and multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to examine the factors associated with adolescent pregnancy.Over the study period (2006-2016), the rate of adolescent pregnancy was 173 [95% Confidence Interval (CI): 159, 188] per 1000 women aged 15-19 years. Adolescent pregnancy was significantly higher among woman with middle household wealth index [adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR) 2.19, 95% confidence interval CI 1.65, 2.91] or poor household wealth index (aOR 2.37, 95% CI 1.76, 3.21). Similarly, Dalit (aOR 1.87, 95% CI 1.50, 2.34) or Madhesi (aOR 1.67, 95% CI 1.32, 2.11); and unemployed (aOR 1.28, 95% CI 1.09, 1.50) women had higher odds of adolescent pregnancies. In contrast, adolescent pregnancy was significantly lower among educated women (aOR 0.60, 95% CI 0.48, 0.74), and women with access to media exposure to public health issues (aOR 0.75, 95% CI 0.64, 0.88).Access to the media exposure on public health issues can be the effective efforts to reduce adolescent pregnancy. Women who have low maternal education, low wealth index, unemployed, and ethnic groups such as Dalits, and Madeshi needs to be targeted while designing and implementing policies and programs."

The study aimed to assess the uptake of HIV testing during pregnancy and associated factors among Ethiopian women.We analyzed the 2016 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey dataset. Women who gave birth within one year prior to the survey were included in the analysis. Uptake of HIV testing during pregnancy is defined as receiving HIV testing service during pregnancy and/or at the time of delivery and knew the test results. Adjusted odds ratios (AORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated by using step-wise backward logistic regression analyses to identify factors associated with HIV testing during pregnancy.A total of 2114 women who were pregnant in the last one year prior to the survey were included in the analysis. Of these, only 35.1% were tested for HIV and received the test results during pregnancy. About one third of women who had antenatal care follow-up missed the opportunity to be tested for HIV. Compared to women who had no formal education, those who had primary level education (AOR = 1.55; 95% CI: 1.12-2.15), secondary level education (AOR = 2.56 95%CI: 1.36-3.82), or higher education (AOR = 3.95, 95%CI: 1.31-11.95) were more likely to be tested for HIV during pregnancy. Similarly, having awareness about mother-to-child transmission of HIV (AOR = 2.03, 95%CI: 1.48-2.78), and living in urban areas (AOR = 3.30, 95%CI: 1.39-7.85) were positively and independently associated with uptake of HIV during pregnancy. Women who have stigmatizing attitude towards HIV positive people were less likely to be tested for HIV (AOR = 0.57, 95%CI: 0.40-0.79).Uptake of HIV testing during pregnancy is low. Missed opportunity among women who had antenatal care visits was very high. Integrating HIV testing with antenatal care services, improving HIV testing service quality and access are essential to increase uptake of HIV testing during pregnancy and reach the goal of eliminating MTCT."
https://openalex.org/W2886365431,"Resistance to chemotherapy remains a critical barrier to effective cancer treatment. Although cisplatin is one of the most commonly used chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), mechanisms of resistance to this drug are not fully understood. Here, we report a novel cisplatin-resistance mechanism involving SET Domain Containing 2 (SETD2), a histone H3 lysine 36 (H3K36) trimethyltransferase, and cAMP-responsive element-binding protein 1 (CREB1). A549 cells selected in vivo to give brain metastases exhibited cisplatin resistance and decreased expression of phosphorylated CREB1. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis identified a missense mutation in SETD2 (p.T1171K), and we demonstrated that SETD2-mediated trimethylation of H3K36 (H3K36me3) and CREB1 phosphorylation are critical for cellular sensitivity to cisplatin. Moreover, we showed that suppression of SETD2 or CREB1 and ectopic expression of mutant SETD2 conferred cisplatin resistance through inhibition of H3K36me3 and ERK activation in NSCLC cells. Our results provide evidence that SETD2 and CREB1 contribute to cisplatin cytotoxicity via regulation of the ERK signaling pathway, and their inactivation may lead to cisplatin resistance."

Although it is known that some FGFR isoforms confer advantages in cell proliferation and survival, the mechanism by which the subversion of different FGFR isoforms contributes to PCa progression is incompletely understood. Here, we report that fibroblast growth factor (FGF) promotes NF-κB signaling in PCa cells and that this increase is associated with FGFR1 expression. Disruption of FGFR1 kinase activity abrogated both FGF activity and NF-κB signaling in PCa cells. Of note, the three common signaling pathways downstream of FGFR1 kinase, extracellular signal–regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K/AKT), and phosphoinositide phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ), were not required for FGF-mediated NF-κB signaling. Instead, transforming growth factor β–activating kinase 1 (TAK1), a central regulator of the NF-κB pathway, was required for FGFR1 to stimulate NF-κB signaling. Moreover, we found that FGFR1 promotes NF-κB signaling in PCa cells by reducing TAK1 degradation and thereby supporting sustained NF-κB activation. Consistently, Fgfr1 ablation in the transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) model reduced inflammation in the tumor microenvironment. In contrast, activation of the FGFR1 kinase in the juxtaposition of chemical-induced dimerization (CID) and kinase 1 (JOCK1) mouse model increased inflammation. As inflammation plays an important role in PCa initiation and progression, these findings suggest that ectopically expressed FGFR1 promotes PCa progression, at least in part, by increasing inflammation in the tumor microenvironment.

https://openalex.org/W2885770732,"Bird collisions with buildings are the second largest anthropogenic source of direct mortality for birds (365-988 million birds killed annually in the United States). Recent research suggests that this mortality occurs disproportionately across species. However, previous work had relied on regional and annual measures of relative species abundance. Our research identifies which species experience higher or lower collision rates than expected from local abundances using two sets of citizen science data: Minnesota Project BirdSafe and the Mississippi River Twin Cities Important Bird Area Landbird Monitoring Program. Our analysis used a measure of relative species abundance that spatially overlaps the area monitored for building collisions and was measured weekly, allowing for a temporally and spatially more specific analysis than most previous analyses. Abundance and collision data were used to model phylogenetic and behavioral traits associated with increased collision risk. Behavioral traits included diurnal/nocturnal migration timing, length of migration, and foraging strategies. Our analysis shows that birds that predominately migrate during the day have a decreased risk of building collisions despite peak collision numbers occurring during early morning; this result suggests that more nuanced behavioral or physiological differences between diurnal and nocturnal migrants could contribute to bird-building collision risk. Additionally, for many species, local abundance is the predominant determining factor for collision risk. However, for ~20% of species studied, the family, genus, and/or species of a bird may affect the collision risk."

Herein we report a study on the mechanism through which TF recognizes the proline residue in the unfolded client protein during the cis/trans isomerization process.

Molecular dynamics simulation revealed that TF exploits the backbone amide group of Ile195 to form an intermolecular hydrogen bond with the carbonyl oxygen of the amino acid residue preceding the proline residue at the transition state, which presumably stabilizes the transition state and thus accelerates the isomerization. The importance of such intermolecular hydrogen-bond formation during the catalysis was further corroborated by the activity assay and NMR relaxation analysis.

https://openalex.org/W2886256175,"Sulfated glycans are known to be involved in several glycan-mediated cell adhesion and recognition pathways. Our mRNA transcript analyses on the genes involved in synthesizing GlcNAc-6-O–sulfated glycans in human colon cancer tissues indicated that GlcNAc6ST-2 (CHST4) is preferentially expressed in cancer cells compared with nonmalignant epithelial cells among the three known major GlcNAc-6-O-sulfotransferases. On the contrary, GlcNAc6ST-3 (CHST5) was only expressed in nonmalignant epithelial cells, whereas GlcNAc6ST-1 (CHST2) was expressed equally in both cancerous and nonmalignant epithelial cells. These results suggest that 6-O-sulfated glycans that are synthesized only by GlcNAc6ST-2 may be highly colon cancer–specific, as supported by immunohistochemical staining of cancer cells using the MECA-79 antibody known to be relatively specific to the enzymatic reaction products of GlcNAc6ST-2. By more precise MS-based sulfoglycomic analyses, we sought to further infer the substrate specificities of GlcNAc6STs via a definitive mapping of various sulfo-glycotopes and O-glycan structures expressed in response to overexpression of transfected GlcNAc6STs in the SW480 colon cancer cell line. By detailed MS/MS sequencing, GlcNAc6ST-3 was shown to preferentially add sulfate onto core 2–based O-glycan structures, but it does not act on extended core 1 structures, whereas GlcNAc6ST-1 prefers core 2–based O-glycans to extended core 1 structures. In contrast, GlcNAc6ST-2 could efficiently add sulfate onto both extended core 1– and core 2–based O-glycans, leading to the production of unique sulfated extended core 1 structures such as R-GlcNAc(6-SO3−)β1-3Galβ1–4GlcNAc(6-SO3−)β1–3Galβ1–3GalNAcα, which are good candidates to be targeted as cancer-specific glycans.

https://openalex.org/W2887262796,"Periodontal disease is common in dogs and is initiated by gingival plaque composed of several hundred bacterial species. Some of these species have specifically been pointed out as potential periodontal pathogens, such as Treponema spp. Treponema spp. are difficult to culture and therefore the majority have been detected by culture-independent methods, such as PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction). This leaves many Treponema spp. uncharacterized and unnamed. In this study, treponemes were investigated in gingival plaque from dogs with varying degree of periodontal disease with the aim to describe their occurrence and diversity in dogs. The methods used were culture, phase-contrast microscopy, PCR targeting the 16SrRNA-tRNAIle intergenic spacer region (ISR2), sequencing of the ISR2 and phylogenetic analysis. Treponema spp. were detected in samples from 10 out of 11 dogs and isolates were obtained from six dogs. Both healthy and periodontitis affected dogs were Treponema positive. Phylogenetic analysis, based on ISR2 sequences, revealed a large diversity of treponemes in the study population that were found to be distributed mainly in two groups, corresponding to the human oral treponeme phylogroups II (Treponema denticola) and IV (Treponema maltophilum) genetic groups. They were generally more distantly related to other treponemes in these groups. Treponemes from dogs with periodontitis and dogs with mild gingivitis without periodontitis did not differ in any obvious way. The results indicate that several phylotypes of oral treponemes are common in dogs regardless of periodontal status."
https://openalex.org/W2887404910,"The acute respiratory distress syndrome is not only associated with a high mortality, but also goes along with cognitive impairment in survivors. The cause for this cognitive impairment is still not clear. One possible mechanism could be cerebral inflammation as result of a ""lung-brain-crosstalk"". Even mechanical ventilation itself can induce cerebral inflammation. We hypothesized, that an acute lung injury aggravates the cerebral inflammation induced by mechanical ventilation itself and leads to neuronal damage.After approval of the institutional and state animal care committee 20 pigs were randomized to one of three groups: lung injury by central venous injection of oleic acid (n = 8), lung injury by bronchoalveolar lavage in combination with one hour of injurious ventilation (n = 8) or control (n = 6). Brain tissue of four native animals from a different study served as native group. For six hours all animals were ventilated with a tidal volume of 7 ml kg-1 and a scheme for positive end-expiratory pressure and inspired oxygen fraction, which was adapted from the ARDS network tables. Afterwards the animals were killed and the brains were harvested for histological (number of neurons and microglia) and molecular biologic (TNFalpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6) examinations.There was no difference in the number of neurons or microglia cells between the groups. TNFalpha was significantly higher in all groups compared to native (p < 0.05), IL-6 was only increased in the lavage group compared to native (p < 0.05), IL-1beta showed no difference between the groups.With our data we can confirm earlier results, that mechanical ventilation itself seems to trigger cerebral inflammation. This is not aggravated by acute lung injury, at least not within the first 6 hours after onset. Nevertheless, it seems too early to dismiss the idea of lung-injury induced cerebral inflammation, as 6 hours might be just not enough time to see any profound effect."
https://openalex.org/W2886667548,"Prolonged darkness leads to carbohydrate starvation, and as a consequence plants degrade proteins and lipids to oxidize amino acids and fatty acids as alternative substrates for mitochondrial ATP production. We investigated, whether the internal breakdown of glucosinolates, a major class of sulfur-containing secondary metabolites, might be an additional component of the carbohydrate starvation response in Arabidopsis thaliana (A. thaliana). The glucosinolate content of A. thaliana leaves was strongly reduced after seven days of darkness. We also detected a significant increase in the activity of myrosinase, the enzyme catalyzing the initial step in glucosinolate breakdown, coinciding with a strong induction of the main leaf myrosinase isoforms TGG1 and TGG2. In addition, nitrilase activity was increased suggesting a turnover via nitriles and carboxylic acids. Internal degradation of glucosinolates might also be involved in diurnal or developmental adaptations of the glucosinolate profile. We observed a diurnal rhythm for myrosinase activity in two-week-old plants. Furthermore, leaf myrosinase activity and protein abundance of TGG2 varied during plant development, whereas leaf protein abundance of TGG1 remained stable indicating regulation at the transcriptional as well as post-translational level."

A number of protein chaperones, including heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70), promote the degradation and/or refolding of misfolded proteins and thereby prevent their aggregation. Here, we report that, in various SCA14-associated, aggregating PKCγ variants, endogenous Hsp70 is incorporated into aggregates and that expression of these PKCγ mutants up-regulates Hsp70 expression. We observed that PKCγ binds Hsp70 and that this interaction is enhanced in the SCA14-associated variants, mediated by the kinase domain that is involved in amyloid-like fibril formation as well as the C2 domain of PKCγ. Pharmacological up-regulation of Hsp70 by the Hsp90 inhibitors celastrol and herbimycin A attenuated the aggregation of mutant PKCγ in primary cultured Purkinje cells. Up-regulation of Hsp70 diminished net PKCγ aggregation by preventing aggregate formation, resulting in decreased levels of apoptotic cell death among primary cultured Purkinje cells expressing the PKCγ variant.

https://openalex.org/W2885855737,"Regulator of G protein signaling 14 (RGS14) is a multifunctional brain scaffolding protein that integrates G protein and Ras/ERK signaling pathways. It is also a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein. RGS14 binds active Gαi/o via its RGS domain, Raf and active H-Ras–GTP via its R1 Ras-binding domain (RBD), and inactive Gαi1/3 via its G protein regulatory (GPR) domain. RGS14 suppresses long-term potentiation (LTP) in the CA2 region of the hippocampus, thereby regulating hippocampally based learning and memory. The 14-3-3 family of proteins is necessary for hippocampal LTP and associative learning and memory. Here, we show direct interaction between RGS14 and 14-3-3γ at two distinct sties, one phosphorylation-independent and the other phosphorylation-dependent at Ser-218 that is markedly potentiated by signaling downstream of active H-Ras. Using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET), we show that the pSer-218–dependent RGS14/14-3-3γ interaction inhibits active Gαi1–AlF4− binding to the RGS domain of RGS14 but has no effect on active H-Ras and inactive Gαi1–GDP binding to RGS14. By contrast, the phosphorylation-independent binding of 14-3-3 has no effect on RGS14/Gαi interactions but, instead, inhibits (directly or indirectly) RGS14 nuclear import and nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. Together, our findings describe a novel mechanism of negative regulation of RGS14 functions, specifically interactions with active Gαi and nuclear import, while leaving the function of other RGS14 domains intact. Ongoing studies will further elucidate the physiological function of this interaction between RGS14 and 14-3-3γ, providing insight into the functions of both RGS14 and 14-3-3 in their roles in modulating synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus."

Previously, we showed that NODAL expressed in maternal endometrial stromal cells is able to affect NODAL and STOX1 expression in placental extravillous trophoblasts. The effect of maternal NODAL on placental NODAL expression is achieved via Activin A, while preliminary data suggests that maternal NODAL affects STOX1 expression in trophoblasts potentially via IGF1. In the current study, T-HESC endometrial stromal cells were treated with siRNAs against NODAL after which IGF1 mRNA expression was determined by quantitative RT-PCR, while IGF1 secretion was measured by ELISA. Recombinant IGF1 and inhibitors of the MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways were added to SGHPL-5 extravillous trophoblasts after which the effects on STOX1 mRNA and STOX1 protein expression were determined. The effect of IGF1 and the MAPK and PI3K/AKT inhibitors on the invasive capacity of SGHPL-5 cells was investigated by performing invasion assays. We found that T-HESC cells treated with NODAL siRNAs showed significant upregulation of IGF1 mRNA expression and IGF1 protein secretion. Addition of IGF1 to SGHPL-5 cell media significantly upregulated STOX1 mRNA and protein expression. Using inhibitors of the PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathway showed that the effect of IGF1 on STOX1 expression is accomplished via MAPK signaling. Secondly, PI3K inhibition independently leads to reduced STOX1 expression which can be rescued by adding IGF1. IGF1 was unable to influence the invasive capacity of SGHPL-5 cells, while inhibiting the PI3K/AKT pathway did reduce the invasion of these cells. To conclude, here we show that downregulated NODAL expression in endometrial stromal cells, previously associated with pre-eclampsia like symptoms in mice, increases IGF1 secretion. Increased levels of IGF1 lead to increased expression levels of STOX1 in extravillous trophoblasts via the MAPK pathway, hereby identifying a novel signaling cascade involved in maternal-fetal communication."

Among PCGs, high conservation is observed in cytochrome oxidase genes with cox1 exhibits the highest conservation. Conversely, NADH dehydrogenase and ATPase subunit genes are more variable with atp8 presents the maximal variation. Comparison of the gene order indicates complex rearrangement in bees. Most of the rearranged events are located in the tRNA clusters of trnI-trnQ-trnM, trnW-trnC-trnY, and trnA-trnR-trnN-trnS1-trnE-trnF. Furthermore, we present the most comprehensive mitochondrial phylogeny of bee families. The monophyly of each family and the long-tongued bees is highly supported. However, short-tongued bees are inferred as paraphyletic relative to the sister relationship between Melittidae and other bee families. Furthermore, to improve the resolution of phylogeny, various datasets and analytical approaches are performed. It is indicated that datasets including third codons of PCGs facilitate to produce identical topology and higher nodal support. The tRNA genes that have typical cloverleaf secondary structures also exhibit similar positive effects. However, rRNAs present poor sequence alignment and distinct substitution saturation, which result in negative effects on both tree topology and nodal support. In addition, Gblocks treatment can increase the congruence of topologies, but has opposite effects on nodal support between the two inference methods of maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference."

https://openalex.org/W2887174992,"Protein minimization is an attractive approach for designing vaccines against rapidly evolving pathogens such as human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1), because it can help in focusing the immune response toward conserved conformational epitopes present on complex targets. The outer domain (OD) of HIV-1 gp120 contains epitopes for a large number of neutralizing antibodies and therefore is a primary target for structure-based vaccine design. We have previously designed a bacterially expressed outer-domain immunogen (ODEC) that bound CD4-binding site (CD4bs) ligands with 3-12 μm affinity and elicited a modest neutralizing antibody response in rabbits. In this study, we have optimized ODEC using consensus sequence design, cyclic permutation, and structure-guided mutations to generate a number of variants with improved yields, biophysical properties, stabilities, and affinities (KD of 10-50 nm) for various CD4bs targeting broadly neutralizing antibodies, including the germline-reverted version of the broadly neutralizing antibody VRC01. In contrast to ODEC, the optimized immunogens elicited high anti-gp120 titers in rabbits as early as 6 weeks post-immunization, before any gp120 boost was given. Following two gp120 boosts, sera collected at week 22 showed cross-clade neutralization of tier 1 HIV-1 viruses. Using a number of different prime/boost combinations, we have identified a cyclically permuted OD fragment as the best priming immunogen, and a trimeric, cyclically permuted gp120 as the most suitable boosting molecule among the tested immunogens. This study also provides insights into some of the biophysical correlates of improved immunogenicity."
https://openalex.org/W2887813499,"The role of the nfuA gene encoding an iron-sulfur ([Fe-S]) cluster-delivery protein in the pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa was investigated. The analysis of nfuA expression under various stress conditions showed that superoxide generators, a thiol-depleting agent and CuCl2 highly induced nfuA expression. The expression of nfuA was regulated by a global [2Fe-2S] cluster containing the transcription regulator IscR. Increased expression of nfuA in the ΔiscR mutant under uninduced conditions suggests that IscR acts as a transcriptional repressor. In vitro experiments revealed that IscR directly bound to a sequence homologous to the Escherichia coli Type-I IscR-binding motifs on a putative nfuA promoter that overlapped the -35 element. Binding of IscR prevented RNA polymerase from binding to the nfuA promoter, leading to repression of the nfuA transcription. Physiologically, deletion of nfuA reduced the bacterial ability to cope with oxidative stress, iron deprivation conditions and attenuated virulence in the Caenorhabditis elegans infection model. Site-directed mutagenesis analysis revealed that the conserved CXXC motif of the Nfu-type scaffold protein domain at the N-terminus was required for the NfuA functions in conferring the stress resistance phenotype. Furthermore, anaerobic growth of the ΔnfuA mutant in the presence of nitrate was drastically retarded. This phenotype was associated with a reduction in the [Fe-S] cluster containing nitrate reductase enzyme activity. However, NfuA was not required for the maturation of [Fe-S]-containing proteins such as aconitase, succinate dehydrogenase, SoxR and IscR. Taken together, our results indicate that NfuA functions in [Fe-S] cluster delivery to selected target proteins that link to many physiological processes such as anaerobic growth, bacterial virulence and stress responses in P. aeruginosa."

Change post-intervention was measured for lower extremity motor score, soleus H-reflex facilitation; seated balance function; ambulation; spasticity; and pain. Results Only 9 of 21 enrolled participants completed both interventions. Thirteen participants completed at least one intervention. Although there were no statistically significant differences, multimodal training tended to increase short-interval H-reflex facilitation, whereas treadmill training tended to improve dynamic seated balance. Discussion The low number of participants who completed both phases of the crossover intervention limited the power of this study to detect significant effects. Other potential explanations for the lack of significant differences with multimodal training could include insufficient engagement of lower extremity motor cortex using skilled upper extremity exercises; and lack of skill transfer from upright postural stability during multimodal training to seated dynamic balance during testing. To our knowledge, this is the first published study to report seated posturography outcomes after rehabilitation interventions in individuals with SCI. Conclusion In participants with chronic incomplete SCI, a novel mix of multimodal exercises incorporating balance exercises with skilled upper extremity exercises showed no benefit compared to an active control program of body weight-supported treadmill training. To improve participant retention in long-term rehabilitation studies, subsequent trials would benefit from a parallel group rather than crossover study design."

This paper uses survey data from about 9,000 individual investors across China to explore the predictability of decision behaviors by studying demographic characteristics that are relatively easy to obtain. After applying Pearson's chi-squared test, Spearman rank correlation test, and several data mining methods, we verified that demographic characteristics are closely linked to decision behaviors, and it would be an economical and feasible solution for financial organizations to build initial behavioral prediction models especially when investors' behavioral data are insufficient."
https://openalex.org/W2885654762,"The renin-angiotensin system (RAS), which plays an important role in the progression of heart failure, is efficiently blocked by the inhibition of renin, the rate-limiting enzyme in the RAS cascade. In the present study, we investigated the cardioprotective effects of TAK-272 (SCO-272, imarikiren), a novel, orally effective direct renin inhibitor (DRI), and compared its efficacy with that of aliskiren, a DRI that is already available in the market. TAK-272 was administered to calsequestrin transgenic (CSQ-tg) heart failure mouse model that show severe symptoms and high mortality. The CSQ-tg mice treated with 300 mg/kg, the highest dose tested, of TAK-272 showed significantly reduced plasma renin activity (PRA), cardiac hypertrophy, and lung congestion. Further, TAK-272 reduced cardiomyocyte injury accompanied by an attenuation of the increase in NADPH oxidase 4 and nitric oxide synthase 3 expressions. TAK-272 also prolonged the survival of CSQ-tg mice in a dose-dependent manner (30 mg/kg: P = 0.42, 100 mg/kg: P = 0.12, 300 mg/kg: P < 0.01). Additionally, when compared at the same dose level (300 mg/kg), TAK-272 showed strong and sustained PRA inhibition and reduced the heart weight and plasma N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) concentration, a heart failure biomarker, while aliskiren showed a significant weaker PRA inhibition and failed to demonstrate any cardioprotective effects. Our results showed that TAK-272 is an orally active and persistent renin inhibitor, which reduced the mortality of CSQ-tg mice and conferred protection against cardiac hypertrophy and injury. Thus, TAK-272 treatment could provide a new therapeutic approach for heart failure."
https://openalex.org/W2887653493,"In the context of type 1 diabetes research and the development of insulin-producing β-cell replacement strategies, whether pancreatic ductal cells retain their developmental capability to adopt an endocrine cell identity remains debated, most likely due to the diversity of models employed to induce pancreatic regeneration. In this work, rather than injuring the pancreas, we developed a mouse model allowing the inducible misexpression of the proendocrine gene Neurog3 in ductal cells in vivo. These animals developed a progressive islet hypertrophy attributed to a proportional increase in all endocrine cell populations. Lineage tracing experiments indicated a continuous neo-generation of endocrine cells exhibiting a ductal ontogeny. Interestingly, the resulting supplementary β-like cells were found to be functional. Based on these findings, we suggest that ductal cells could represent a renewable source of new β-like cells and that strategies aiming at controlling the expression of Neurog3, or of its molecular targets/co-factors, may pave new avenues for the improved treatments of diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2885480507,"The CHD3-like chromatin remodeling protein MOM1 and the PIAS-type SUMO E3 ligase-like protein PIAL2 are known to interact with each other and mediate transcriptional silencing in Arabidopsis. However, it is poorly understood whether and how the interaction is involved in transcriptional silencing. Here, we demonstrate that, while the PIAL2 interaction domain (PIAL2-IND) is required for PIAL2 dimerization, MOM-PIAL2 interaction, and transcriptional silencing, a transgene fusing the wild-type MOM1 protein with the PIAL2 protein defective in PIAL2-IND can completely restore transcriptional silencing in the mom1/pial2 double mutant, demonstrating that the artificial fusion of MOM1 and PIAL2 mimics the in vivo interaction of these two proteins so that PIAL2-IND is no longer required for transcriptional silencing in the fusion protein. Further, our yeast two-hybrid assay identifies a previously unrecognized SUMO interaction motif (SIM) in the conserved MOM1 motif CMM3 and demonstrates that the SIM is responsible for the interaction of MOM1 with SUMO. Given that eukaryotic PIAS-type SUMO E3 ligases have a conserved role in chromatin regulation, the findings reported in this study may represent a conserved chromatin regulatory mechanism in higher eukaryotes."

https://openalex.org/W2886137549,"Camellia japonica (Naidong), a Tertiary relict species with a unique biological and cultural characteristic, is a special ecotype of C. japonica and is the northernmost distributed populations of C. japonica in the world. This study investigated the interactive responses of C. japonica (Naidong) to shade and nitrogen deposition focusing on seedling growth, leaf morphology and leaf physiology under two light regimes (15% and 65% of full sunlight to represent deep shade and slight shade respectively) and three nitrogen deposition regimes (0, 6 and 12 g N m-2 year-1) in a greenhouse. After 123 d of treatment, the results showed that the deep shade reduced the growth of seedlings significantly compared to slight shade, but improved the specific leaf area, leaf water content, chlorophyll content and Fv/Fm of plants. Moderate nitrogen (6 g N m-2 year-1) supply increased the crown area, specific leaf area, leaf water content, chlorophyll content and water use efficiency of seedlings. However, high nitrogen (12 g N m-2 year-1) supply reduced the basal diameter, crown area, specific leaf area and leaf water content. No significant interaction of shade and nitrogen deposition on C. japonica (Naidong) was found. There is a threshold of nitrogen deposition for the growth of C. japonica (Naidong). Camellia japonica (Naidong) populations should be protected by collecting of germplasm resources and carrying out the ex situ conservation."
https://openalex.org/W2885684161,"Unsaturated omega-3 fatty acids, especially docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), when fed to dogs improves cognitive and neurological development. Supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids such as DHA and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) has also been associated with lipid peroxidation, which in turn has been implicated in reduced body weight and altered bone formation. To assess the impact of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation on skeletal growth, diets containing three levels of DHA and EPA (0.01 and 0.01%, 0.14 and 0.12%, and 0.21 and 0.18%, respectively) were fed to bitches during gestation and lactation with puppies also supplemented through weaning. Thus, the subjects studied were the puppies supplemented with DHA and EPA through gestation and early postnatal life. The hip joint conformation of the puppies (n = 676) was recorded at adulthood using two radiographic, non-invasive evaluations. In this population, females had higher hip distraction indices (DI) than males. Males from the lower two levels of DHA and EPA supplementation had significantly smaller hip DI than all females and males from the highest DHA and EPA supplementation. In contrast, there were no diet effects on anatomical indicators of hip joint conformation and no visible arthritic changes. These data suggest that dietary supplementation of DHA and EPA during gestation and the perinatal period to weaning does not adversely influence hip joint formation of dogs."
https://openalex.org/W2886460306,"As September approaches, a new cohort of junior faculty members are taking up their first positions as research group leaders. I was there 3 years ago, making career-shaping decisions—sometimes without much mentoring or support. I learned a lot in my first years—how to write a grant, manage rejection, and supervise students, to name just a few—and it was all trial by fire. Though I made it through and had some successes along the way, I certainly could have used advice about how to set up and run my lab. I've learned that my experience is the norm, which inspired me and a group of other early-career principal investigators to interview leaders in our fields about how they built successful research groups. Here are some of the lessons they shared.

FIND YOUR NICHE. Before you even begin to interview for a faculty job, you need to decide what your lab's focus will be. You must be a pioneer, “carving out a niche for yourself that is unique, and where you'll be at the top of the heap,” says Margaret McFall-Ngai, a professor at the University of Hawaii at Manoa who was among the first to study squid-bacteria interactions. Identify how your skills intersect with the science that excites you, in the most promising uncharted territory. Plan big while identifying key publication checkpoints along the way. Your tenure case depends on it.

FIND YOUR PEOPLE. Good science is done by talented people. “If you have an excellent person who wants to work with you, try to hire them at all costs, even if you have to spend the last of your money,” says Gregor Weihs, a professor of photonics at the University of Innsbruck in Austria. On the flip side, hiring the wrong people can be a real drain on the group. “Never hire just because you can,” Weihs says. Get to know prospective lab members by teaching graduate classes and taking on undergraduates for smaller projects, and use your network to find promising graduate students at other institutions.

IT PAYS TO WORK TOGETHER. To secure major funding, “it's better to try and see if you can chase it together rather than all competing for the same buck,” says Melvyn Goodale, a professor of neuroscience at Western University in London, Canada, who helped form an 11-institution research consortium, the Canadian Action and Perception Network. If your goals are aligned with those of other labs, then it makes sense to work together on a joint application rather than against each other. Writing grant applications as a group can help spark new ideas, and many minds working together can increase your chance of success. Even if you don't get funded, writing a group grant can deepen your collaborative relationships for years to come.

BUILD A NETWORK. To make connections when you're just starting out, you need to be your own marketing department. “It's not just doing the research; it's making it known,” says Yoshua Bengio, a professor at the University of Montreal in Canada who works on artificial intelligence. These days, a lot of networking is done online. Get on Twitter and follow your 10 favorite research labs. Look at who they follow to find more connections. Tweet about the work you publish and interesting papers you read to help people identify your niche and get to know your research brand.

Finally, don't be afraid to reach out to senior faculty members to seek out mentoring, share your work, and ask for input on grant applications. Their feedback will be invaluable, and some day you will pay it forward to a new cohort of junior faculty members. There is knowledge and experience all around. You may be surprised at people's willingness to share it.
