https://openalex.org/W2595688496,"Since the discovery of topological insulators and semimetals, there has been much research into predicting and experimentally discovering distinct classes of these materials, in which the topology of electronic states leads to robust surface states and electromagnetic responses. This apparent success, however, masks a fundamental shortcoming: topological insulators represent only a few hundred of the 200,000 stoichiometric compounds in material databases. However, it is unclear whether this low number is indicative of the esoteric nature of topological insulators or of a fundamental problem with the current approaches to finding them. Here we propose a complete electronic band theory, which builds on the conventional band theory of electrons, highlighting the link between the topology and local chemical bonding. This theory of topological quantum chemistry provides a description of the universal (across materials), global properties of all possible band structures and (weakly correlated) materials, consisting of a graph-theoretic description of momentum (reciprocal) space and a complementary group-theoretic description in real space. For all 230 crystal symmetry groups, we classify the possible band structures that arise from local atomic orbitals, and show which are topologically non-trivial. Our electronic band theory sheds new light on known topological insulators, and can be used to predict many more."

Previous studies have been unable to identify the full spectrum of driver genes and molecular processes that operate in medulloblastoma subgroups. Here we analyse the somatic landscape across 491 sequenced medulloblastoma samples and the molecular heterogeneity among 1,256 epigenetically analysed cases, and identify subgroup-specific driver alterations that include previously undiscovered actionable targets. Driver mutations were confidently assigned to most patients belonging to Group 3 and Group 4 medulloblastoma subgroups, greatly enhancing previous knowledge. New molecular subtypes were differentially enriched for specific driver events, including hotspot in-frame insertions that target KBTBD4 and ‘enhancer hijacking’ events that activate PRDM6. Thus, the application of integrative genomics to an extensive cohort of clinical samples derived from a single childhood cancer entity revealed a series of cancer genes and biologically relevant subtype diversity that represent attractive therapeutic targets for the treatment of patients with medulloblastoma. Genomic analysis of 491 medulloblastoma samples, including methylation profiling of 1,256 cases, effectively assigns candidate drivers to most tumours across all molecular subgroups. Medulloblastomas are highly malignant brain tumours that develop during childhood. Paul Northcott and colleagues analysed the whole-genome sequences of 491 medulloblastomas in order to characterize the genomic landscape across tumours and identify new drivers and mutational signatures. Their integrative genomic analyses, including methylation profiling of 1,256 medulloblastomas, identifies subgroup-specific driver mutations and suggests additional tumour subtypes. The authors assign driver mutations to a high proportion of the less well characterized Group 3 and Group 4, which together contribute to more than 60% of all medulloblastomas."
https://openalex.org/W2739085298,"A complex containing two uranium ions and three potassium ions, held together by a nitride group and a flexible molecular framework, can reduce and functionalize N2 under mild conditions. Molecular nitrogen (N2) is cheap and widely available, but very unreactive and difficult to transform into useful compounds. Molecular complexes that bind and reduce N2 under mild conditions are known, but are not usually well characterized and only rarely react further to form new N–H or N–C bonds. Marta Falcone et al. now report that a complex containing two uranium ions and three potassium ions held together by a nitride group and a flexible molecular framework can reduce N2 and subsequently induce the formation of new N–H or N–C bonds under mild conditions. Full characterization of the complex shows that the flexible, electron-rich multimetallic nitride-bridged core unit is essential, and could be used to guide the design of other molecular complexes that are capable of cleaving the strong N2 bond and transforming this resource into useful chemicals. Molecular nitrogen (N2) is cheap and widely available, but its unreactive nature is a challenge when attempting to functionalize it under mild conditions with other widely available substrates (such as carbon monoxide, CO) to produce value-added compounds. Biological N2 fixation can do this, but the industrial Haber–Bosch process for ammonia production operates under harsh conditions (450 degrees Celsius and 300 bar), even though both processes are thought to involve multimetallic catalytic sites1,2. And although molecular complexes capable of binding and even reducing N2 under mild conditions are known, with co-operativity between metal centres considered crucial for the N2 reduction step1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14, the multimetallic species involved are usually not well defined, and further transformation of N2-binding complexes to achieve N–H or N–C bond formation is rare2,6,8,10,15,16. Haber noted17, before an iron-based catalyst was adopted for the industrial Haber–Bosch process, that uranium and uranium nitride materials are very effective heterogeneous catalysts for ammonia production from N2. However, few examples of uranium complexes binding N2 are known18,19,20,21,22, and soluble uranium complexes capable of transforming N2 into ammonia or organonitrogen compounds have not yet been identified. Here we report the four-electron reduction of N2 under ambient conditions by a fully characterized complex with two Uiii ions and three K+ centres held together by a nitride group and a flexible metalloligand framework. The addition of H2 and/or protons, or CO to the resulting complex results in the complete cleavage of N2 with concomitant N2 functionalization through N–H or N–C bond-forming reactions. These observations establish that a molecular uranium complex can promote the stoichiometric transformation of N2 into NH3 or cyanate, and that a flexible, electron-rich, multimetallic, nitride-bridged core unit is a promising starting point for the design of molecular complexes capable of cleaving and functionalizing N2 under mild conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2605249253,"Weyl semimetals are materials where electrons behave effectively as a kind of massless relativistic particles known asWeyl fermions. These particles occur in two flavours, or chiralities, and are subject to quantum anomalies, the breaking of a conservation law by quantum fluctuations. For instance, the number of Weyl fermions of each chirality is not independently conserved in parallel electric and magnetic field, a phenomenon known as the chiral anomaly. In addition, an underlying curved spacetime provides a distinct contribution to a chiral imbalance, an effect known as the mixed axial-gravitational anomaly, which remains experimentally elusive. However, the presence of a mixed gauge-gravitational anomaly has recently been tied to thermoelectrical transport in a magnetic field, even in flat spacetime, opening the door to experimentally probe such type of anomalies in Weyl semimetals. Using a temperature gradient, we experimentally observe a positive longitudinal magnetothermoelectric conductance (PMTC) in the Weyl semimetal NbP for collinear temperature gradients and magnetic fields (DT || B) that vanishes in the ultra quantum limit. This observation is consistent with the presence of a mixed axial-gravitational anomaly. Our work provides clear experimental evidence for the existence of a mixed axial-gravitational anomaly of Weyl fermions, an outstanding theoretical concept that has so far eluded experimental detection."
https://openalex.org/W2736395436,"In soft ferromagnetic materials, the smoothly varying magnetization leads to the formation of fundamental patterns such as domains, vortices and domain walls. These have been studied extensively in thin films of thicknesses up to around 200 nanometres, in which the magnetization is accessible with current transmission imaging methods that make use of electrons or soft X-rays. In thicker samples, however, in which the magnetization structure varies throughout the thickness and is intrinsically three dimensional, determining the complex magnetic structure directly still represents a challenge. We have developed hard-X-ray vector nanotomography with which to determine the three-dimensional magnetic configuration at the nanoscale within micrometre-sized samples. We imaged the structure of the magnetization within a soft magnetic pillar of diameter 5 micrometres with a spatial resolution of 100 nanometres and, within the bulk, observed a complex magnetic configuration that consists of vortices and antivortices that form cross-tie walls and vortex walls along intersecting planes. At the intersections of these structures, magnetic singularities-Bloch points-occur. These were predicted more than fifty years ago but have so far not been directly observed. Here we image the three-dimensional magnetic structure in the vicinity of the Bloch points, which until now has been accessible only through micromagnetic simulations, and identify two possible magnetization configurations: a circulating magnetization structure and a twisted state that appears to correspond to an 'anti-Bloch point'. Our imaging method enables the nanoscale study of topological magnetic structures in systems with sizes of the order of tens of micrometres. Knowledge of internal nanomagnetic textures is critical for understanding macroscopic magnetic properties and for designing bulk magnets for technological applications."
https://openalex.org/W2738411688,"No immunogen to date has reliably elicited broadly neutralizing antibodies to HIV in humans or animal models. Advances in the design of immunogens that antigenically mimic the HIV envelope glycoprotein (Env), such as the soluble cleaved trimer BG505 SOSIP, have improved the elicitation of potent isolate-specific antibody responses in rabbits and macaques, but so far failed to induce broadly neutralizing antibodies. One possible reason for this failure is that the relevant antibody repertoires are poorly suited to target the conserved epitope regions on Env, which are somewhat occluded relative to the exposed variable epitopes. Here, to test this hypothesis, we immunized four cows with BG505 SOSIP. The antibody repertoire of cows contains long third heavy chain complementary determining regions (HCDR3) with an ultralong subset that can reach more than 70 amino acids in length. Remarkably, BG505 SOSIP immunization resulted in rapid elicitation of broad and potent serum antibody responses in all four cows. Longitudinal serum analysis for one cow showed the development of neutralization breadth (20%, n = 117 cross-clade isolates) in 42 days and 96% breadth (n = 117) at 381 days. A monoclonal antibody isolated from this cow harboured an ultralong HCDR3 of 60 amino acids and neutralized 72% of cross-clade isolates (n = 117) with a potent median IC50 of 0.028 μg ml-1. Breadth was elicited with a single trimer immunogen and did not require additional envelope diversity. Immunization of cows may provide an avenue to rapidly generate antibody prophylactics and therapeutics to address disease agents that have evolved to avoid human antibody responses."

All the patients were aged 40 years or above, having left ventricular systolic dysfunction, belonging to NYHA class III and IV. Cox regression was used to model mortality considering age, ejection fraction, serum creatinine, serum sodium, anemia, platelets, creatinine phosphokinase, blood pressure, gender, diabetes and smoking status as potentially contributing for mortality. Kaplan Meier plot was used to study the general pattern of survival which showed high intensity of mortality in the initial days and then a gradual increase up to the end of study. Martingale residuals were used to assess functional form of variables. Results were validated computing calibration slope and discrimination ability of model via bootstrapping. For graphical prediction of survival probability, a nomogram was constructed. Age, renal dysfunction, blood pressure, ejection fraction and anemia were found as significant risk factors for mortality among heart failure patients."
https://openalex.org/W2736691594,"Aberrant proliferation and activation of lung fibroblasts contribute to the initiation and progression of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). However, the mechanisms responsible for the proliferation and activation of fibroblasts are not fully understood. The objective of this study was to investigate the role of miR-101 in the proliferation and activation of lung fibroblasts. miR-101 expression was determined in lung tissues from patients with IPF and mice with bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. The regulation of miR-101 and cellular signaling was investigated in pulmonary fibroblasts in vitro. The role of miR-101 in pulmonary fibrosis in vivo was studied using adenovirus-mediated gene transfer in mice. The expression of miR-101 was down-regulated in fibrotic lungs from patients with IPF and bleomycin-treated mice. The down-regulation of miR-101 occurred via the E26 transformation-specific (ETS) transcription factor. miR-101 suppressed the WNT5a-induced proliferation of lung fibroblasts by inhibiting NFATc2 signaling via targeting Frizzled receptor 4/6 and the TGF-β-induced activation of lung fibroblasts by inhibition of SMAD2/3 signaling via targeting the TGF-β receptor 1. Adenovirus-mediated miR-101 gene transfer in the mouse lung attenuated bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis and improved lung function. Our data suggest that miR-101 is an anti-fibrotic microRNA and a potential therapeutic target for pulmonary fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W2739475813,"Obesity is associated with chronic low-grade inflammation, and metabolic regulators linking obesity to inflammation have therefore received much attention. Secreted C1q/TNF-related proteins (CTRPs) are one such group of regulators that regulate glucose and fat metabolism in peripheral tissues and modulate inflammation in adipose tissue. We have previously shown that expression of CTRP6 is up-regulated in leptin-deficient mice and, conversely, down-regulated by the anti-diabetic drug rosiglitazone. Here, we provide evidence for a novel role of CTRP6 in modulating both inflammation and insulin sensitivity. We found that in obese and diabetic humans and mouse models, CTRP6 expression was markedly up-regulated in adipose tissue and that stromal vascular cells, such as macrophages, are a major CTRP6 source. Overexpressing mouse or human CTRP6 impaired glucose disposal in peripheral tissues in response to glucose and insulin challenge in wild-type mice. Conversely, Ctrp6 gene deletion improved insulin action and increased metabolic rate and energy expenditure in diet-induced obese mice. Mechanistically, CTRP6 regulates local inflammation and glucose metabolism by targeting macrophages and adipocytes, respectively. In cultured macrophages, recombinant CTRP6 dose-dependently up-regulated the expression and production of TNF-α. Conversely, CTRP6 deficiency reduced circulating inflammatory cytokines and pro-inflammatory macrophages in adipose tissue. CTRP6-overexpressing mice or CTRP6-treated adipocytes had reduced insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation and glucose uptake. In contrast, loss of CTRP6 enhanced insulin-stimulated Akt activation in adipose tissue. Together, these results establish CTRP6 as a novel metabolic/immune regulator linking obesity to adipose tissue inflammation and insulin resistance.

Expression of Ctrp6 in the visceral (epididymal) adipose tissue is up-regulated in leptin-deficient ob/ob mice, a genetic model of severe obesity and insulin resistance (9.Wong G.W. Krawczyk S.A. Kitidis-Mitrokostas C. Revett T. Gimeno R. Lodish H.F.

J. 2008; 416: 161-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Conversely, the expression of Ctrp6 in ob/ob mice is down-regulated by the administration of rosiglitazone, an anti-diabetic drug (9.Wong G.W. Krawczyk S.A. Kitidis-Mitrokostas C. Revett T. Gimeno R.

J. 2008; 416: 161-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Mice lacking adiponectin, an insulin-sensitizing adipokine, also have higher serum levels of CTRP6 (9.Wong G.W. Krawczyk S.A. Kitidis-Mitrokostas C. Revett T. Gimeno R. Lodish H.F.

J. 2008; 416: 161-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). A meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies also implicates human CTRP6/C1QTNF6 as a candidate gene that confers susceptibility to type 1 diabetes (33.Cooper J.D. Smyth D.J. Smiles A.M. Plagnol V. Walker N.M. Allen J.E. Downes K. Barrett J.C. Healy B.C. Mychaleckyj J.C. Warram J.H. Todd J.A. Meta-analysis of genome-wide association study data identifies additional type 1 diabetes risk loci.Nat. Genet. 2008; 40: 1399-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). In the present studies, we aimed to uncover the metabolic role of CTRP6 using gain- and loss-of-function mouse models. We provide here the first genetic and physiological evidence that CTRP6 functions as a secreted regulator of glucose metabolism and inflammation in vivo. Similar to the mouse gene (9.Wong G.W. Krawczyk S.A. Kitidis-Mitrokostas C. Revett T. Gimeno R. Lodish H.F. Molecular, biochemical and functional characterizations of C1q/TNF family members: adipose-tissue-selective expression patterns, regulation by PPAR-gamma agonist, cysteine-mediated oligomerizations, combinatorial associations and metabolic functions.Biochem. J. 2008; 416: 161-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), human CTRP6 is relatively broadly expressed in adult tissues, including adipose tissue (Fig. 1A). To address whether adipose expression of CTRP6 is altered in human obesity, we measured its mRNA levels in visceral (omental) and subcutaneous fat depots. Expression of CTRP6 in both omental and subcutaneous fat depots was positively correlated with body mass index (BMI) (Fig. 1, B and C). Compared with lean controls, CTRP6 expression was strikingly up-regulated in both the visceral and subcutaneous fat depots of obese individuals with and without type 2 diabetes (Fig. 1, D and E). We next addressed whether our observations in humans hold true for diet-induced obese mouse models. Parallel to human data, expression of mouse Ctrp6 was significantly up-regulated in both the visceral (epididymal) and subcutaneous (inguinal) white adipose tissue of obese mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) relative to lean controls fed a matched control low-fat diet (LFD) (Fig. 2A). Although Ctrp6 is also expressed in interscapular brown adipose tissue (BAT), its levels were not different between HFD-fed and LFD-fed mice (Fig. 2A). To identify which cell population within the fat depot contributes to changes in Ctrp6 expression in response to obesity, we examined Ctrp6 mRNA levels in isolated adipocytes and cells of the stromal vascular fraction (SVF). Whereas both adipocytes and SVF cells express Ctrp6 transcript, its expression was significantly higher in SVF cells in both visceral and subcutaneous fat depots of HFD-fed mice relative to LFD-fed controls (Fig. 2B). SVF contains immune cells, such as macrophages, as well as endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells. Given that large numbers of macrophages are known to infiltrate the fat pad in the obese state (1.Xu H. Barnes G.T. Yang Q. Tan G. Yang D. Chou C.J. Sole J. Nichols A. Ross J.S. Tartaglia L.A. Chen H. Chronic inflammation in fat plays a crucial role in the development of obesity-related insulin resistance.J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 112: 1821-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (5186) Google Scholar, 2.Weisberg S.P. McCann D. Desai M. Rosenbaum M. Leibel R.L. Ferrante Jr., A.W. Obesity is associated with macrophage accumulation in adipose tissue.J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 112: 1796-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (7458) Google Scholar), elevated CTRP6 in obesity could be produced by adipose tissue macrophages. In support of this finding, when cultured macrophages (RAW264.7) were exposed to high glucose, mimicking the diabetic state, expression of Ctrp6 was significantly induced (Fig. 2C). Mannitol is not metabolized by cells and thus serves as an osmotic control. A genetic loss-of-function mouse model was used to interrogate the metabolic role of Ctrp6 (Fig. 3A). Two sets of primers were designed to amplify a sequence within intron 2 of the WT allele and a sequence spanning the downstream deletion site in the lacZ gene to confirm the genotype of WT and KO mice, respectively (Fig. 3B). As expected from targeted disruption of the gene, Ctrp6 mRNA was absent from epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT), inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT), liver, skeletal muscle, and primary bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMM) of KO mice (Fig. 3C). The Ctrp6 gene is not required for development, although it is expressed throughout embryogenesis (9.Wong G.W. Krawczyk S.A. Kitidis-Mitrokostas C. Revett T. Gimeno R. Lodish H.F. Molecular, biochemical and functional characterizations of C1q/TNF family members: adipose-tissue-selective expression patterns, regulation by PPAR-gamma agonist, cysteine-mediated oligomerizations, combinatorial associations and metabolic functions.Biochem. J. 2008; 416: 161-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Ctrp6 KO mice were born at the expected Mendelian ratio and appeared normal with no gross developmental abnormalities. To determine the contribution of CTRP6 to systemic energy metabolism in the normal and obese states, Ctrp6 WT and KO male mice were fed an HFD or a control LFD for 20 weeks, beginning at 4 weeks of age. On an LFD, we observed no differences in body weight, body composition (fat and lean mass), food intake, metabolic rate, energy expenditure, or physical activity level between Ctrp6 WT and KO mice (Fig. 4). When challenged with an HFD, Ctrp6 WT and KO mice also did not differ in body weight (Fig. 5A), body composition (Fig. 5B), or food intake (Fig. 5C). However, metabolic rate as measured by the rates of oxygen consumption (V̇O2) and carbon dioxide production (V̇CO2) were much higher in Ctrp6 KO mice compared with WT littermates (Fig. 5, D and E). Respiratory exchange ratios (RER) were not different between the two groups (Fig. 5F), indicating comparable oxidation of fat and carbohydrates as a fuel source. The increased metabolic rate seen in Ctrp6 KO mice also resulted in enhanced energy expenditure relative to WT controls (Fig. 5G). No differences, however, were observed in physical activity or postprandial thermogenesis (Fig. 5, H and I).Figure 5Increased metabolic rate and energy expenditure in Ctrp6 KO male mice fed an HFD.

Loss of CTRP6 did not alter serum adiponectin and leptin levels in response to HFD (Fig. 6, A and B). In contrast, circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines, TNF-α and MCP-1, were significantly lower in Ctrp6 KO mice relative to WT littermates (Fig. 6, C and F). Serum IL-1β and IL-6 levels were not different between WT and KO mice (Fig. 6, D and E). Interestingly, white blood cell, especially monocyte, numbers were reduced in Ctrp6 KO mice (Fig. 6G). Two phenotypic and functional subsets of mature blood monocytes have been described: Ly6Chi and Ly6Clo (34.Sunderkötter C. Nikolic T. Dillon M.J. Van Rooijen N. Stehling M. Drevets D.A. Leenen P.J. Subpopulations of mouse blood monocytes differ in maturation stage and inflammatory response.J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 4410-4417Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar, 35.Gordon S. Taylor P.R. Monocyte and macrophage heterogeneity.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 5: 953-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (3826) Google Scholar). The Ly6Chi blood monocytes are thought to be the source of macrophages that get recruited to sites of inflammation in tissues. The circulating levels of monocytes and neutrophils were assessed by flow cytometry (Fig. 6H). Ctrp6 KO mice have reduced Ly6Chi monocytes compared with WT mice (Fig. 6I). No differences were observed in Ly6Clo monocytes and neutrophils between the two groups (Fig. 6, J and K). These results suggest a better systemic inflammatory profile in CTRP6-deficient animals. We next determined whether local inflammatory profiles within adipose tissue differ between Ctrp6 WT and KO mice. Although adipose tissue weight was not different between WT and KO mice (Fig. 7A), histology revealed a striking reduction in adipose tissue macrophages infiltrating the visceral fat pad and their associated crownlike structures (Fig. 7, B and C). Crownlike structures consist of macrophages surrounding dying or dead adipocytes. When we examined the cell size distribution, WT mice had significantly greater numbers of small adipocytes (<500 μm2) corresponding to dead cells compared with Ctrp6 KO mice (Fig. 7D). In support of the histology data, mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory M1 macrophage marker genes Cd11c and TNF-α were markedly reduced in eWAT of Ctrp6 KO mice relative to WT controls (Fig. 7E). The expression of the pan-macrophage marker gene, F4/80, however, was not different between the two groups. These results suggest that CTRP6 deficiency dampens the local inflammatory milieu within adipose tissue in response to high-fat feeding. To determine whether reduced TNF-α expression in eWAT is causally linked to CTRP6, we treated cultured mouse macrophages (RAW264.7) with recombinant CTRP6 protein to test whether CTRP6 could directly induce TNF-α expression. With 6-h treatment, recombinant CTRP6 dose-dependently induced the mRNA expression and secreted protein levels of TNF-α (Fig. 8, A and B). Treatment of RAW264.7 macrophages with recombinant CTRP6 for a longer time course (24 h) had even stronger effects on inducing TNF-α mRNA and protein expression and secretion (Fig. 8, C and D). To further confirm these observations, we repeated the same experiments in cultured primary macrophages obtained from the bone marrow. A significant increase in TNF-α mRNA and protein expression and secretion was also observed in primary macrophages treated with recombinant CTRP6 for 24 h (Fig. 8, E and F). These results indicate that CTRP6 can directly modulate pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression in macrophages and that its absence in the KO mice reduced TNF-α in eWAT in response to high-fat feeding. We next sought to determine whether reduced adipose tissue inflammation in Ctrp6 KO mice affects systemic insulin sensitivity. When challenged with a bolus of insulin, the rate of insulin-stimulated glucose clearance in peripheral tissues was significantly greater in Ctrp6 KO mice compared with WT littermates (Fig. 9, A and B). Consistent with enhanced insulin sensitivity, the rate of glucose disposal in response to glucose infusion was also significantly greater in Ctrp6 KO mice (Fig. 9, C and D). To determine whether CTRP6 could directly regulate insulin sensitivity independent of its effects on local inflammatory response within fat depots, we established a CTRP6 overexpression mouse model using hydrodynamic tail vein (HTV) injection (36.Zhang G. Budker V. Wolff J.A. High levels of foreign gene expression in hepatocytes after tail vein injections of naked plasmid DNA.Hum. Gene Ther. 1999; 10: 1735-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar). HTV injection of naked plasmid DNA is a simple, effective, and widely used method of in vivo gene delivery, leading to an overexpression of the encoded cDNA in liver (36.Zhang G. Budker V. Wolff"
https://openalex.org/W2739418797,"Many fine-scale features of ribosomes have been explained in terms of function, revealing a molecular machine that is optimized for error-correction, speed and control. Here we demonstrate mathematically that many less well understood, larger-scale features of ribosomes—such as why a few ribosomal RNA molecules dominate the mass and why the ribosomal protein content is divided into 55–80 small, similarly sized segments—speed up their autocatalytic production. The large number of small, similarly sized proteins and the small number of heavy RNA molecules that make up a ribosome reduce the time required for reproduction. Several ribosomal RNAs form the backbone structure of the ribosome and generally constitute most of its mass, but dozens of ribosomal proteins (r-proteins) are needed to complete the macromolecular complex. All of these components are needed in stoichiometric amounts, but their production is complicated by the fact that the ribosome must translate all of the r-proteins needed to make a new copy of itself. Johan Paulsson and colleagues provide a mathematical analysis of features of the ribosome to explain how they are optimized for this autocatalytic assembly. For example, they demonstrate that r-proteins should be numerous, short and of similar lengths to maximize their own production."
https://openalex.org/W2737470345,"Abstract Pyroptosis is a form of cell death important in defenses against pathogens, but which can also result in a potent and sometimes pathological inflammatory response. During pyroptosis, gasdermin D (GSDMD), the pore-forming effector protein, is cleaved, forms oligomers, and inserts into the membranes of the cell, resulting in rapid cell death. However, the potent cell death induction caused by GSDMD has complicated our ability to understand the biology of this protein. Studies aimed at visualizing GSDMD have relied on expression of GSDMD fragments in epithelial cell lines that naturally lack GSDMD expression and also lack the proteases necessary to cleave GSDMD. In this work, we performed mutagenesis and molecular modeling to strategically place tags and fluorescent proteins within GSDMD that support native pyroptosis and facilitate live-cell imaging of pyroptotic cell death. Here, we demonstrate that these fusion proteins are cleaved by caspases-1 and 11 at Asp-276. Mutations that disrupted the predicted p30-p20 autoinhibitory interface resulted in GSDMD aggregation, supporting the oligomerizing activity of these mutations. Furthermore, we show that these novel GSDMD fusions execute inflammasome-dependent pyroptotic cell death in response to multiple stimuli and allow for visualization of the morphological changes associated with pyroptotic cell death in real time. This work therefore provides new tools that not only expand the molecular understanding of pyroptosis, but also enable its direct visualization."

In mammals, high SOD activity is detectable in sperm and seminal plasma, and loss of SOD activity has been correlated with male infertility; however, the underlying mechanisms of sperm infertility remain to be clarified. Here we report that the deletion of two major SOD genes in Caenorhabditis elegans, sod-1 and sod-2, causes sperm activation defects, leading to a significant reduction in brood size. By examining the reactivity to the sperm activation signals Pronase and triethanolamine, we found that sod-1;sod-2 double mutant sperm cells display defects in pseudopod extension.

Surprisingly, H2O2, the dismutation product of SOD, could activate sod-1;sod-2 mutant sperm treated with Pronase. Moreover, the H2O2 scavenger ebselen completely inhibited pseudopod extension in wild-type sperm treated with Pronase, and H2O2 could directly induce pseudopod extension in wild-type sperm.

In aerobic organisms, incomplete reduction of molecular oxygen constantly generates superoxide radicals (O2̇̄). Although O2̇̄ is considered to have low reactivity, it can act as a precursor for highly toxic reactive oxygen species, including hydroperoxyl radical, hydroxyl radical, and peroxynitrite. Approximately 1% of O2̇̄ molecules are protonated at physiological pH, forming hydroperoxyl radical, which is sufficiently reactive to initiate lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation (1.Oueslati K. de La Pomélie D.

The free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is a useful model organism to examine the effects of gene depletion on reproduction because it is genetically tractable, easily manipulated, and has a unique reproductive system. In C. elegans, there are two sexes: self-fertilizing hermaphrodite, in which the germline produces both sperm and oocytes, and male, in which the germline produces only sperm (26.Kimble J. Hirsh D. The postembryonic cell lineages of the hermaphrodite and male gonads in Caenorhabditis elegans.Dev. Biol. 1979; 70: 396-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). C. elegans sperm consists of amoeboid cells lacking flagella that move by extending the pseudopod (27.Smith H.E. Ward S.

The reproductive system of the hermaphrodite consists of two tubular oviducts that are connected to a central uterus through two spermathecae. Fertilization occurs when the oocyte is pushed into the spermatheca that stores sperm. Because the fertilized eggs push out the sperm into the uterus simultaneously when they exit the spermatheca, sperm must crawl back into the spermatheca to fertilize the subsequent ovulated oocytes. C. elegans has five SOD genes encoding two cytosolic CuZn-SOD enzymes (sod-1 and sod-5), two mitochondrial Mn-SOD enzymes (sod-2 and sod-3), and one extracellular CuZn-SOD enzyme (sod-4).

Deletion of the mitochondrial superoxide dismutase sod-2 extends lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans.PLoS Genet. 2009; 5: e1000361Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) reported that single-gene deletion mutants of sod-1 and sod-2 cause a reduction in brood size in C. elegans. Furthermore, deletion of all SOD genes (sod-1;2;3;4;5 quintuple mutants) also decreases the brood size; however, the mechanism underlying this reduced fertility remains unclear (30.Van Raamsdonk J.M. Hekimi S. Superoxide dismutase is dispensable for normal animal lifespan.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 5785-5790Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). In this study, we generated C. elegans mutants lacking the genes encoding CuZn-SOD and Mn-SOD homologs (sod-1 and sod-2, respectively) and found that the deletion of sod-1 and sod-2 severely decreased brood size. sod-1;sod-2 double-mutant sperm was defective in pseudopod extension without suffering oxidative modification of sperm proteins. Pronase-triggered sperm activation analysis in sod-1 and sod-2 single mutants revealed that sod-2 is required for pseudopod extension. By stimulating the spermatid with H2O2, we found that the production of H2O2 by SOD-2 is a key factor in pseudopod extension of C. elegans sperm. We first examined the brood sizes of individual SOD gene deletion mutants (Fig. 1). Consistent with previous reports, the brood sizes of sod-1 and sod-2 mutants were reduced by 50% compared with the wild type; however, the brood sizes of sod-3, sod-4, and sod-5 mutants were not significantly affected (29.Van Raamsdonk J.M. Hekimi S. Deletion of the mitochondrial superoxide dismutase sod-2 extends lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans.PLoS Genet. 2009; 5: e1000361Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 30.Van Raamsdonk J.M. Hekimi S. Superoxide dismutase is dispensable for normal animal lifespan.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 5785-5790Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). In C. elegans, sod-1 and sod-2 encode the major isoforms of cytosolic CuZn-SOD and mitochondrial Mn-SOD, respectively. In contrast, sod-5 and sod-3 are minor inducible isoforms of CuZn-SOD and Mn-SOD, respectively. To avoid redundancy, we generated sod-1sod-5 and sod-2;sod-3 double mutants and found that the brood sizes of both double mutants were slightly reduced compared with individual single mutants. To eliminate a large fraction of SOD activity in C. elegans, we generated sod-1;sod-2 double mutants. We found that the brood sizes of sod-1;sod-2 mutants were reduced to 15% that of the wild type. These data indicate that sod-1 and sod-2 serve as the primary SOD isoforms in the reproduction of C. elegans. Because the brood size was remarkably reduced by depletion of sod-1 and sod-2 in C. elegans, the reason for infertility in the sod-1;sod-2 mutant was investigated. In C. elegans, the self-fertilizing hermaphrodite produces both sperm and oocytes. In the hermaphrodite gonad, 300 sperm are produced during the late larval stage, and thereafter, oocytes are produced over the subsequent lifetime (26.Kimble J. Hirsh D. The postembryonic cell lineages of the hermaphrodite and male gonads in Caenorhabditis elegans.Dev. Biol. 1979; 70: 396-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). Because the quality and quantity of sperm limit the brood size of C. elegans, we first focused on defects of sperm in sod-1;sod-2 mutants (Fig. 2). A round, non-motile spermatid yielded by meiosis undergoes a dynamic morphological change, so-called sperm activation, forming non-flagellated ameboid cells for crawling movement (Fig. 2A and Refs. 27.Smith H.E. Ward S. Identification of protein-protein interactions of the major sperm protein (MSP) of Caenorhabditis elegans.J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 605-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 28.Nelson G.A. Roberts T.M. Ward S. Caenorhabditis elegans spermatozoan locomotion: amoeboid movement with almost no actin.J. Cell Biol. 1982; 92: 121-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The activation signal is transduced through SPE-8–group proteins, and the sperm can be activated in vitro by several factors, including a protease (Pronase), an ionophore (monensin), and a weak base (triethanolamine, TEA) (31.Ward S. Hogan E. Nelson G.A. The initiation of spermiogenesis in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.Dev. Biol. 1983; 98: 70-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 32.Nelson G.A. Ward S. Vesicle fusion, pseudopod extension and amoeboid motility are induced in nematode spermatids by the ionophore monensin.Cell. 1980; 19: 457-464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). To examine the process of pseudopod formation, we performed in vitro activation of sperm isolated from wild-type and sod-1;sod-2 mutant males (Fig. 2B). As Pronase serves as an SPE-8–group protein activator, 75% of wild-type sperm were fully activated following Pronase treatment, showing an actively extended pseudopod (Fig. 2C). The remaining 25% were composed of incompletely activated sperm with a partially extended pseudopod or a non-activated spermatid without any pseudopod formation. On the other hand, in sod-1;sod-2 mutants, fully activated sperm accounted for 40% of sperm cells, and the fractions of incompletely activated sperm and non-activated spermatids were increased to 2- and 4-fold of those in the wild type, respectively (Fig. 2C). Next, we tested the response of sod-1;sod-2 mutant sperm to TEA treatment. Activating sperm with TEA bypasses the requirement for Spe-8–class signaling components (33.Shakes D.C. Ward S. Initiation of spermiogenesis in C. elegans: a pharmacological and genetic analysis.Dev. Biol. 1989; 134: 189-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). With TEA treatment, 40% and 30% of wild-type sperm were fully and incompletely activated, respectively (Fig. 2D). The remaining 30% was composed of non-activated spermatids. On the other hand, the response to TEA was dramatically decreased in sod-1;sod-2 mutant sperm. Non-activated sperm accounted for 95% of isolated sperm, which was three times higher than that of wild-type sperm (Fig. 2D). These data indicate that sod-1;sod-2 mutant sperm has defects in pseudopod extension. Here we reveal that sod-1;sod-2 mutant sperm are defective in pseudopod extension. In the activated ameboid sperm, the assembly of MSP at the leading edge of the pseudopod and disassembly at the pseudopod–cell body interface provide the protrusive force for ameboid movement (Fig. 2A and Refs. 34.Sepsenwol S. Ris H. Roberts T.M. A unique cytoskeleton associated with crawling in the amoeboid sperm of the nematode, Ascaris suum.J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 55-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 35.Roberts T.M. Ward S. Centripetal flow of pseudopodial surface components could propel the amoeboid movement of Caenorhabditis elegans spermatozoa.J. Cell Biol. 1982; 92: 132-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To obtain insight into the pseudopod extension defects in sod-1;sod-2 mutant sperm, we first examined the change of content and localization of MSP in wild-type and sod-1;sod-2 mutant sperm. To isolate large amounts of sperm sufficient for biochemical analysis, a temperature-sensitive mutation of the fem-3 gene q20 was introduced to sod-1;sod-2 mutants (36.Barton M.K. Schedl T.B. Kimble J. Gain-of-function mutations of fem-3, a sex-determination gene in Caenorhabditis elegans.Genetics. 1987; 115: 107-119Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hermaphrodites of the fem-3 mutant and the sod-1;sod-2;fem-3 triple mutant produce only sperm at a restrictive temperature. Sperm isolated from ∼20,000 hermaphrodites of fem-3 and sod-1;sod-2;fem-3 mutants grown at restrictive temperature were subjected to Western blot analysis to determine MSP levels. In sod-1;sod-2;fem-3 mutant sperm, the MSP level was not significantly affected compared with fem-3 sperm (Fig. 3A). Likewise, immunostaining of MSP did not show clear differences between fem-3 and sod-1;sod-2;fem-3 mutant sperm (Fig. 3B). C. elegans has 28 genes encoding MSP, and the degree of amino acid sequence identity is very high (97–100%) (37.Ward S. Burke D.J. Sulston J.E. Coulson A.R. Albertson D.G. Ammons D. Klass M. Hogan E. Genomic organization of major sperm protein genes and pseudogenes in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 199: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 38.Klass M.R. Kinsley S. Lopez L.C. Isolation and characterization of a sperm-specific gene family in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1983; 171: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Of interest is that all of them contain two cysteine residues, at positions of 60 and 75 (Fig. 3C). Because the thiol moiety of cysteine is very sensitive to oxidation (40.Miki H. Funato Y. Regulation of intracellular signalling through cysteine oxidation by reactive oxygen species.J. Biochem. 2012; 151: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), we next examined an oxidative modification of cysteine residues in MSP. Sperm homogenates were reacted with 4-acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulphonic acid (AMS), a free thiol alkylating reagent (41.Biteau B. Labarre J. Toledano M.B. ATP-dependent reduction of cysteine-sulphinic acid by S. cerevisiae sulphiredoxin.Nature. 2003; 425: 980-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). The alkylated protein increases the molecular mass by 0.5 kDa per alkylated cysteine. When the alkylation of MSP was monitored over 4 h, the band intensity of the AMS-alkylated form increased in a time-dependent manner not only in fem-3 mutants but also in sod-1;sod-2;fem-3 mutants, suggesting that the cysteine residues in MSP exist as free thiol forms in both fem-3 mutant and sod-1;sod-2;fem-3 mutant sperm (Fig. 3, D and E). Taken together, these data indicate that neither the change in content nor oxidative modification of MSP were responsible for pseudopod extension defects in sod-1;sod-2 mutant sperm. In vivo staining of isolated sperm by H2DCFDA, an indicator of intracellular H2O2, revealed that the level of H2O2 was lower in sod-1;sod-2 mutant sperm than in wild-type sperm (Fig. 4A). Because SOD produces H2O2 by the dismutation of O2̇̄, we examined the possibility that H2O2 promotes Pronase-triggered sperm activation. When treated with 0.3 mm H2O2, Pronase can activate sod-1;sod-2 mutant sperm, showing a level of activation comparable with that of the wild type (Fig. 4B). To confirm the involvement of H2O2 in Pronase-triggered sperm activation, we examined the effects of ebselen, a potent H2O2 scavenger (42.Pearson J.K. Boyd R.J. Density functional theory study of the reaction mechanism and energetics of the reduction of hydrogen peroxide by ebselen, ebselen diselenide, and ebselen selenol.J. Phys. Chem. A. 2007; 111: 3152-3160Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 43.Yang C.F. Shen H.M. Ong C.N. Protective effect of ebselen against hydrogen peroxide-induced cytotoxicity and DNA damage in HepG2 cells.Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 57: 273-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The results showed that ebselen inhibited pseudopod extension in wild-type sperm treated with Pronase (Fig. 4C). It was further examined whether H2O2 directly promotes pseudopod extension in C. elegans (Fig. 5). Wild-type sperm responded to H2O2 in a dose-dependent manner, raising the possibility that H2O2 acts as an activator of pseudopod extension (Fig. 5A). Ebselen inhibited pseudopod extension in wild-type sperm treated with 1.25 mm H2O2 (Fig. 5B). In addition, ebselen treatment dramatically reduced the brood size of the wild-type in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5C). Taken together, these data strongly suggest that SOD is involved in sperm activation of C. elegans by producing H2O2 as an activator of pseudopod extension. To identify the gene that causes sperm activation defects in sod-1;sod-2 mutants, we compared Pronase-dependent pseudopod extension of sperm in sod-1 and sod-2 single mutants. In Pronase-treated sod-2 mutant sperm, fully activated sperm accounted for 40% of sperm cells, and the fraction of incompletely activated sperm was increased to 4-fold that of the wild type (Fig. 6A). Similar defects were also observed in sod-1;sod-2 mutant sperm treated with Pronase. In contrast, the fraction of activated sperm was not significantly affected in the sod-1 mutant compared with the wild type. In vivo staining of isolated sperm by H2DCFDA revealed that the level of H2O2 was lower in sod-2 mutant sperm than in wild-type sperm (Fig. 6B). Moreover, in combination with H2O2, Pronase can activate sod-2 mutant sperm, showing a level of activation comparable with that of the wild-type (Fig. 6C). Sperm activation defects in sod-2 and sod-1;sod-2 mutant males were examined in vivo by crossing with dpy-11 hermaphrodites. Male sperm are known to outcompete hermaphrodite sperm; thus, the majority of embryos produced after mating are outcross progeny (44.LaMunyon C.W. Ward S. Larger sperm outcompete smaller sperm in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.Proc. Biol. Sci. 1998; 265: 1997-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 45.LaMunyon C.W. Ward S. Sperm precedence in a hermaphroditic nematode (Caenorhabditis elegans) is due to competitive superiority of male sperm.Experientia. 1995; 51: 817-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6D, when crossed with sod-2 and sod-1;sod-2 mutant males, the number of outcross progeny was reduced to 50% of that of wild-type male. These data strongly suggest that SOD-2 is involved in Pronase-dependent sperm activation in C. elegans. Although the degree of sperm activation defects was similar in sod-2 and sod-1;sod-2 mutants, the brood size of sod-1;sod-2 mutants was significantly reduced compared sod-2 mutants (Figure 1, Figure 6A), suggesting that sod-1;sod-2 mutants have defects not only in sperm but also in oocytes. To investigate this possibility, sod-1;sod-2 mutant hermaphrodites were outcrossed with wild-type males (Fig. 6E). When crossed with wild-type males, sod-1;sod-2 mutant hermaphrodites produced ∼250 outcross progeny, corresponding to 50% of that of wild-type hermaphrodites. In addition, the number of outcross progeny was also reduced in sod-1 mutant hermaphrodites when crossed with wild-type males, suggesting that sod-1 mutants have defects in the oocyte. These data indicate that deletion of sod-2 is responsible for the defects of pseudopod extension in sod-1;sod-2 mutant sperm. In C. elegans, several reports have shown that deletion of SOD genes reduces fertility; however, the mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, by comparing the reactivity of SOD gene–deleted C. elegans sperm with the activation signals, we demonstrated that simultaneous deletion of the sod-1 and sod-2 genes attenuated pseudopod extension, leading to a reduction in brood size (Figure 1, Figure 2). Because O2̇̄ acts as a precursor of highly reactive oxygen species that modify cysteine residues in proteins, we first hypothesized that oxidative modification of cysteine in MSP causes sperm activation defects in sod-1;sod-2 mutants. However, significant differences were not observed between sod-1;sod-2 mutant and wild-type sperm (Fig. 3). In addition, carbonylation of sperm protein was not significantly affected in sod-1;sod-2 mutants compared with the wild-type (data not shown). These data suggest that oxidative modification of MSP would be negligible in sod-1;sod-2 mutant sperm. To confirm this possibility, sod-1;sod-2 mutants were treated with deferoxamine, a potent iron chelator, which did not restore the brood size (48 ± 5 broods in intact sod-1;sod-2 mutants versus 50 ± 3 broods in deferoxamine-treated sod-1;sod-2 mutants). Taken together, these results indicate that oxidative stress is not responsible for the reduction in brood size in sod-1;sod-2 mutants. In this study, we found that H2O2 produced by SOD-2 is involved in sperm activation in C. elegans. H2O2 functions as a downstream signaling molecule for Pronase-dependent pseudopod extension because ebselen inhibited Pronase-dependent sperm activation in wild-type worms (Figure 4, Figure 5). Liu et al. (46.Liu Z. Wang B. He R. Zhao Y. Miao L. Calcium signaling and the MAPK cascade are required for sperm activation in Caenorhabditis elegans.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2014; 1843: 299-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) showed that calcium signaling is required for Pronase-triggered sperm activation in C. elegans.

Previous studies have indicated that miR-200c acts as a tumour suppressor in various cancers by downregulating high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) and thereby suppressing EMT and metastasis. In addition, miR-200c was reported to be downregulated and correlated with poor outcomes in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, its functional role in HMGB1 regulation in NSCLC is still unclear. This study aimed to clarify whether miR-200c acts as a tumour suppressor in NSCLC by downregulating HMGB1, which is associated with EMT, invasion, cytoskeleton rearrangement, and migration in vitro and in vivo. In order to demonstrate HMGB1 downregulation by miR-200c, the NSCLC cell line A549 was transfected with miR-200c mimic or inhibitor. The mimic significantly reduced HMGB1 expression and suppressed EMT, invasion, and migration, while the inhibitor generated the opposite effects. Additionally, using xenograft mouse models, we confirmed that HMGB1 overexpression increased tumour EMT. In summary, our results demonstrated that miR-200c could suppress EMT, invasion, and migration of NSCLC cells by downregulating HMGB1."

Promoting new lymphatic vessels (lymphangiogenesis) is a promising strategy to reverse these cardiovascular disorders via restoring lymphatic function. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) members VEGF-C and VEGF-D are both potent candidates for stimulating lymphangiogenesis, though maintaining spatial and temporal control of these factors represents a challenge to developing efficient therapeutic lymphangiogenic applications. Injectable alginate hydrogels have been useful for the controlled delivery of many angiogenic factors, including VEGF-A, to stimulate new blood vasculature. However, the utility of these tunable hydrogels for delivering lymphangiogenic factors has never been closely examined. Thus, the objective of this study was to utilize ionically cross-linked alginate hydrogels to deliver VEGF-C and VEGF-D for potential lymphangiogenic applications. We demonstrated that lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) are sensitive to temporal presentation of VEGF-C and VEGF-D but with different responses between the factors. The greatest LEC mitogenic and sprouting response was observed for constant concentrations of VEGF-C and a high initial concentration that gradually decreased over time for VEGF-D. Additionally, alginate hydrogels provided sustained release of radiolabeled VEGF-C and VEGF-D. Finally, VEGF-C and VEGF-D released from these hydrogels promoted a similar number of LEC sprouts as exogenously added growth factors and new vasculature in vivo via a chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay. Overall, these findings demonstrate that alginate hydrogels can provide sustained and bioactive release of VEGF-C and VEGF-D which could have applications for therapeutic lymphangiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2736933564,"Calmodulin-like (CML) proteins are major EF-hand–containing, calcium (Ca2+)–binding proteins with crucial roles in plant development and in coordinating plant stress tolerance. Given their abundance in plants, the properties of Ca2+ sensors and identification of novel target proteins of CMLs deserve special attention. To this end, we recombinantly produced and biochemically characterized CML36 from Arabidopsis thaliana. We analyzed Ca2+ and Mg2+ binding to the individual EF-hands, observed metal-induced conformational changes, and identified a physiologically relevant target. CML36 possesses two high-affinity Ca2+/Mg2+ mixed binding sites and two low-affinity Ca2+-specific sites. Binding of Ca2+ induced an increase in the α-helical content and a conformational change that lead to the exposure of hydrophobic regions responsible for target protein recognition. Cation binding, either Ca2+ or Mg2+, stabilized the secondary and tertiary structures of CML36, guiding a large structural transition from a molten globule apo-state to a compact holoconformation. Importantly, through in vitro binding and activity assays, we showed that CML36 interacts directly with the regulative N terminus of the Arabidopsis plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase isoform 8 (ACA8) and that this interaction stimulates ACA8 activity. Gene expression analysis revealed that CML36 and ACA8 are co-expressed mainly in inflorescences. Collectively, our results support a role for CML36 as a Ca2+ sensor that binds to and modulates ACA8, uncovering a possible involvement of the CML protein family in the modulation of plant-autoinhibited Ca2+ pumps.

Calcium (Ca2+) is a crucial second messenger in plants, where it couples the perception of endogenous and environmental signals to plant responses (1.Sanders D. Pelloux J. Brownlee C. Harper J.F. Calcium at the crossroads of signaling.Plant Cell. 2002; 14: S401-S417Crossref PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar2.Dodd A.N. Kudla J. Sanders D. The language of calcium signaling.Annu. Rev.

Calcium and reactive oxygen species rule the waves of signaling.Plant Physiol. 2013; 163: 471-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Ca2+ signals are transmitted by stimulus-specific cytosolic Ca2+ elevations that result from the concerted action of both Ca2+ influx (channels) and Ca2+ efflux (pumps and carriers) systems, which temporally shape and spatially define Ca2+ dynamics, commonly referred to as the “Ca2+ signature” (3.Kudla J.

These signatures are believed to encode information from primary stimuli and, therefore, to contribute to the stimulus specificity of the biological response. Nonetheless, another layer of specificity in Ca2+ signaling is achieved via the function of Ca2+ sensors, which detect alterations in intracellular free Ca2+ concentration decoding specific Ca2+ signatures into downstream physiological responses (7.Luan S. Kudla J. Rodriguez-Concepcion M. Yalovsky S. Gruissem W.

Most Ca2+sensors harbor the EF-hand motif, a helix-loop-helix structure binding one Ca2+ ion. The EF-hand binds Ca2+ through a pentagonal bipyramidal arrangement, and the chelating residues are notated either based on their linear positions (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 12) or on their tertiary coordination geometry (X, Y, Z, −Y, −X, and −Z) (8.Gifford J.L.

In the canonical EF-hand, positions 1 (X), 3 (Y), 5 (Z), and 12 (−Z) are side-chain oxygen ligands, 7 (−Y) is a backbone carbonyl ligand, and 9 (−X) is a water ligand hydrogen-bonded to one loop residue (8.Gifford J.L.

Ca2+ binding modifies the conformation of EF-hand proteins resulting in changes in enzymatic activity of the Ca2+ sensor itself or allowing it to interact with and alter the target protein activity (9.Permyakov E.A.

Altogether, these studies do not support a functional redundancy hypothesis for CMLs, which could be key positive and/or negative regulator components in the coordination of plant responses to different environmental stimuli (15.Ranty B. Aldon D. Cotelle V. Galaud J.P. Thuleau P. Mazars C. Calcium sensors as key hubs in plant responses to biotic and abiotic stresses.Front. Plant Sci. 2016; 7: 327Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). However, to date only a few of these proteins have been clearly shown to function as Ca2+ sensors by describing their Ca2+-binding (e.g. dissociation constants, stoichiometry, ligand specificity) and structural properties and by identifying their biological targets. Thus, a detailed characterization of CMLs at the biochemical and structural levels combined with the identification of distinct downstream targets is essential in determining the high level of specificity that allows the plant cell to transduce diverse stimuli into proper physiological responses. In the present study, we characterized CML36 from A. thaliana. In particular, using different complementary biophysical and biochemical methods, we analyzed whether CML36 possesses the structural and binding properties of Ca2+ sensor proteins. We found that CML36 behaves as a Ca2+ sensor, in that it experiences Ca2+-dependent changes in secondary and tertiary structure and in the exposure of hydrophobic regions. Moreover, we identified a biological target, providing evidence that CML36 interacts directly with Arabidopsis Ca2+-ATPase isoform 8 (ACA8), a type IIB Ca2+ pump localized at the plasma membrane (PM) that contributes to the overall Ca2+ homoeostasis and to the control of intracellular Ca2+ signaling by actively extruding Ca2+ from the cytosol into the apoplast (16.Bonza M.C. Morandini P. Luoni L. Geisler M. Palmgren M.G. De Michelis M.I.

We identified the specific CML36-binding site at the N terminus of ACA8 and demonstrated that the interaction between ACA8 and CML36 promotes the pump Ca2+-dependent hydrolytic activity in vitro. Collectively, our findings allowed us to classify CML36 as a Ca2+ sensor, uncovering a possible involvement of CML36 in the modulation of the plant autoinhibited Ca2+ pump. Recombinant production of full-length CML36 (CML36 f.l.) resulted in a highly unstable protein (with a high propensity to aggregate and precipitate) at the concentrations required for efficient protein-based biophysical and structural analyses. CML36 contains an extended N-terminal region (residues 1–60) and a Ca2+-binding region (residues 61–209) with four EF-hand motifs. The extended N-terminal region was found to be remarkably intrinsically disordered using the GeneSilico MetaDisorder Service (19.Kozlowski L.P. Bujnicki J.M. MetaDisorder: A meta-server for the prediction of intrinsic disorder in proteins.BMC Bioinformatics. 2012; 13: 111Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), and therefore a truncated variant of CML36 was created by deleting the first 60 residues. The resulting mutant (residues 61–209, named CML36-C) was very stable even at high concentrations and was therefore used for all biophysical and structural analyses. Typical features of Ca2+ sensors include Ca2+-induced conformational changes that often expose hydrophobic surfaces necessary for target recognition. Thus, we examined Ca2+-dependent conformational changes and surface hydrophobicity of recombinant CML36-C by using an array of biophysical and structural techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), circular dichroism (CD), 1-anilino-8-naphthalene sulfonate (ANS) fluorescence spectroscopy, and size-exclusion chromatography (SEC). Moreover, because of the high concentration of free Mg2+ in plant cells (0.5–2 mm) (20.Waters B.M. Moving magnesium in plant cells.New Phytol. 2011; 190: 510-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 21.Maathuis F.J. Physiological functions of mineral macronutrients.Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2009; 12: 250-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar) we also analyzed the behavior of CML36-C upon the addition of Mg2+, to determine the specificity of CML36 in discriminating cytosolic Ca2+ signals against a ∼102–104-fold excess of the chemically similar divalent cation Mg2+. Mg2+ binding to EF-hands is physiologically important; distinct roles have been proposed for the binding of this ion (8.Gifford J.L. Walsh M.P. Vogel H.J.

Insights into modulation of calcium signaling by magnesium in calmodulin, troponin C and related EF-hand proteins.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2011; 1813: 913-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), such as a structural role, by conferring structural stability to an otherwise poorly defined molten globule apo-state, or roles in the Ca2+-dependent regulation of cellular processes by modulating the affinity of EF-hands for Ca2+. NMR spectroscopy was used to investigate the structural rearrangements of CML36-C upon the addition of metal ions. The signals in a two-dimensional 1H-15N heteronuclear single-quantum coherence (HSQC) NMR spectrum belong to the HN groups of the protein. The frequency of HN signals (chemical shift) correlates with the chemical environment of the observed nuclei and is influenced by both local and global structure. The 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of apoCML36-C is characterized by the presence of fewer peaks than expected, severe line broadening, and poor chemical shift dispersion, especially in the proton dimension (Fig. 1A). These spectral features suggest that apoCML36-C undergoes conformational fluctuations typical of a molten globule state, similar to other EF-hand proteins in their apoforms (23.Ames J.B. Dizhoor A.M. Ikura M. Palczewski K. Stryer L. Three-dimensional structure of guanylyl cyclase-activating protein-2, a calcium-sensitive modulator of photoreceptor guanylyl cyclases.J. Biol.

Metal ion binding properties and conformational states of calcium- and integrin-binding protein.Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2558-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). A change in the HSQC spectrum of CML36-C was observed upon the addition of a saturating concentration of Mg2+ (Fig. 1B). The spectrum is characterized by more uniform peak intensities and an increased chemical shift dispersion, indicating that Mg2+-bound CML36-C adopts a more stable tertiary structure compared with the apoprotein. However, the number of peaks in the Mg2+-bound form remained much lower than expected considering the non-proline residues in the amino acid sequence of CML36-C (150 residues), and many peaks in the central area of the HSQC spectrum still appeared rather broad, meaning that some portions of the Mg2+-bound protein may not be structured or may still possess a high degree of flexibility. Remarkably, the addition of saturating Ca2+ concentrations to the apoCML36-C resulted in a more dramatic change in the CML36-C HSQC spectrum, where ∼120 peaks with good chemical shift dispersion became visible (Fig. 1C), indicating that the addition of Ca2+ promotes a global structural rearrangement throughout the protein. By comparing the position of the peaks in the two metal-bound forms, it was evident that Ca2+ induced conformational changes in CML36-C distinct and separate from those induced by Mg2+, which is in line with a putative Ca2+ sensor function of the protein. The far- and near-UV CD analyses were consistent with the interpretation of the apoCML36-C as a molten globule state, as in apoCML36-C the secondary structure is conserved to a large extent, whereas the tertiary structure is highly fluctuating. Panels A and B of Fig. 2 show the far- and near-UV regions of the CD spectra of apoCML36-C and Ca2+- or Mg2+-bound CML36-C, respectively. As evident in Fig. 2A, the far-UV CD spectra for the apoform and both holoforms of CML36-C show two negative bands with minima at 208 and 222 nm, characteristic of proteins with a high α-helical content. However, the reduced θ222/208 ratio observed in apoCML36-C (0.67 for apoCML36-C versus 0.83 and 0.82 for Ca2+-CML36-C and Mg2+-CML36-C, respectively) suggests the presence of some regions of high flexibility or random coil structures. Despite the absence of Trp residues, CML36-C has two Tyr and eight Phe residues, and the corresponding bands are well-resolved in the near-UV CD spectra (Fig. 2B). Signals in the 275–290-nm range can be associated with the microenvironment of Tyr residues, whereas the bands observed in the 250–270-nm region, with minima at 262 and 268 nm, are ascribable to Phe residues. The switch of CML36-C from the holo- to the apoform produces considerable changes in this part of the CD spectrum (Fig. 2B), suggesting a partial collapse of the tertiary structure. A common feature of Ca2+ sensors is the increase in surface-exposed hydrophobicity upon Ca2+ binding, which we investigated by the use of the fluorescent probe ANS. This dye is a hydrophobic compound that shows a blue-shift in the maximum emission and a considerable increase in fluorescence upon binding to hydrophobic regions of proteins. In the presence of apoCML36-C, we detected a ∼7-nm blue-shift and a modest increase in the emission of ANS in comparison with ANS alone (Fig. 2C), suggesting that apoCML36-C possesses exposed hydrophobic portions. The addition of Mg2+ did not cause further changes to the spectrum, whereas upon the addition of Ca2+ a further blue-shift (∼12 nm) and a 1.6-fold increase in fluorescence emission was observed, indicating that CML36-C undergoes a Ca2+-dependent exposure of hydrophobic surfaces. Analytical SEC, together with pulsed-field gradient diffusion NMR studies, was conducted to examine the hydrodynamic radius (Rh) of CML36-C in the apo-state and the Mg2+-bound and Ca2+-bound states (Table 1). Notably, in all of these states, the obtained Rh resulted in an apparent molecular mass overestimation, which has been observed in various Ca2+ sensor proteins (26.Sorensen B.R.

Moreover, CML36-C displays a higher electrophoretic mobility in the presence of Ca2+ both in denaturing and native conditions (Fig. 2, D and E), which is a well-documented phenomenon for CaM proteins (29.Astegno A.

Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) was used to monitor Ca2+ and Mg2+ binding to CML36-C, which allows the determination of accurate values of apparent dissociation constants (Kd) for multiple binding sites and related changes in enthalpy (ΔH). Representative ITC isotherms are shown in Fig. 3, and the thermodynamic binding parameters obtained are listed in Table 2. Titration of CaCl2 into apoCML36-C at physiological salt concentrations (Fig. 3A, black line) produced a multiphasic binding isotherm with an initial exothermic phase followed by an endothermic phase. The data best fit a four-site sequential binding model that reflected the presence of two classes of binding sites (Table 2): the first class comprises two high-affinity sites (Kd1 = 91 ± 17 nm and Kd2 = 122 ± 13 nm, respectively) with a heat release between −12 and −10 kcal/mol of CaCl2; and the second class likely represents the binding of two Ca2+ ions with lower affinity (Kd3 = 104 ± 9 μm and Kd4 = 345 ± 24 μm) with ΔH ∼ 3 kcal/mol of CaCl2. The Ca2+ titration was also performed in the presence of 5 mm Mg2+ (Fig. 3A, red line, and Table 2). Mg2+ did not greatly affect the affinity constants associated with Ca2+ binding to sites 3 and 4 of CML36-C, indicating no binding of Mg2+ to these sites, whereas the Kd values of sites 1 and 2 were shifted to lower affinity. Moreover, Mg2+ had an effect on the ΔH of sites 1 and 2, as the process was less exothermic than that without Mg2+. This behavior, likely suggesting that in the presence of Mg2+ these two sites could be formed and structurally stable, prompted us to quantitate the direct binding of Mg2+ to CML36-C. Titration of MgCl2 into apoCML36-C resulted in an exothermic binding isotherm (Fig. 3B), giving the best fit with the binding of two Mg2+ ions to protein with a Ka value of 9.2E3 ± 0.7E3 m−1 (which corresponds to a Kd value of 109 ± 8 μm), an enthalpy ΔH of −3.9 ± 0.7 kcal mol−1.Table 2Thermodynamics of Ca2+ binding to CML36-C in the absence and presence of Mg2+No Mg2++5 mm Mg2+KaΔHKaΔHm−1kcal mol−1m−1kcal mol−1Site 11.1E7 ± 0.6E7−11.9 ± 0.53.5E6 ± 0.5E6−6.6 ± 0.1Site 28.2E6 ± 0.9E6−9.6 ± 0.61.8E6 ± 0.3E6−6.1 ± 0.2Site 39.6E3 ± 0.8E33.6 ± 0.48.7E3 ± 1.1E32.8 ± 0.1Site 42.9E3 ± 0.2E32.2 ± 0.13.2E3 ± 0.4E32.0 ± 0.3 Open table in a new tab The stoichiometry of Ca2+ and Mg2+ binding was further confirmed by analysis of the 1H-15N HSQC NMR spectra of CML36-C.

In Ca2+-saturated CML36-C, the presence of four downfield-shifted peaks corresponding to Gly-84 (EF-1), Gly-121 (EF-2), Gly-157 (EF-3), and Gly-194 (EF-4) confirms that Ca2+ is bound to the four EF-hands, as seen by ITC analysis (Fig. 4A). The addition of saturating amounts of Mg2+ to apoCML36-C caused the appearance of two downfield-shifted NMR peaks, assigned to Gly-157 and Gly-194 (Fig. 4B, green), indicating that Mg2+ is bound to EF-3 and EF-4. Notably, the addition of Ca2+ to Mg2+-bound CML36-C caused the two downfield peaks at 10.55 ppm (Gly-157) and 10.45 ppm (Gly-194) to disappear and the appearance of the four glycine peaks in the position typical of the Ca2+-bound protein (Fig. 4B, red), suggesting that the Ca2+ ion could displace Mg2+ from EF-3 and EF-4. To fully understand the roles of Ca2+ sensors, the identification of physiologically relevant targets is essential.

https://openalex.org/W2738557117,"Mitochondrial calcium plays critical roles in diverse cellular processes ranging from energy metabolism to cell death. Previous studies have demonstrated that mitochondrial calcium uptake is mainly mediated by the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) complex. However, the roles of the MCU complex in calcium transport, signaling, and dysregulation by oxidative stress still remain unclear. Here, we confirmed that Drosophila MCU contains evolutionarily conserved structures and requires essential MCU regulator (EMRE) for its calcium channel activities. We generated Drosophila MCU loss-of-function mutants, which lacked mitochondrial calcium uptake in response to caffeine stimulation. Basal metabolic activities were not significantly affected in these MCU mutants, as observed in examinations of body weight, food intake, body sugar level, and starvation-induced autophagy. However, oxidative stress-induced increases in mitochondrial calcium, mitochondrial membrane potential depolarization, and cell death were prevented in these mutants. We also found that inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor genetically interacts with Drosophila MCU and effectively modulates mitochondrial calcium uptake upon oxidative stress. Taken together, these results support the idea that Drosophila MCU is responsible for endoplasmic reticulum-to-mitochondrial calcium transfer and for cell death due to mitochondrial dysfunction under oxidative stress."

However, it is unclear whether intended or unintended pregnancies are contributing to observed increases. Methods We analyzed retrospective data from the Canadian HIV Women’s Sexual and Reproductive Health Cohort Study (CHIWOS). Kaplan-Meier methods and GEE Poisson models were used to measure cumulative incidence and incidence rate of pregnancy after HIV diagnosis overall, and by pregnancy intention. We used multivariable logistic regression models to examine independent correlates of unintended pregnancy among the most recent/current pregnancy. Results Of 1,165 WLWH included in this analysis, 278 (23.9%) women reported 492 pregnancies after HIV diagnosis, 60.8% of which were unintended. Unintended pregnancy incidence (24.6 per 1,000 Women-Years (WYs); 95% CI: 21.0, 28.7) was higher than intended pregnancy incidence (16.6 per 1,000 WYs; 95% CI: 13.8, 20.1) (Rate Ratio: 1.5, 95% CI: 1.2–1.8). Pregnancy incidence among WLWH who initiated cART before or during pregnancy (29.1 per 1000 WYs with 95% CI: 25.1, 33.8) was higher than among WLWH not on cART during pregnancy (11.9 per 1000 WYs; 95% CI: 9.5, 14.9) (Rate Ratio: 2.4, 95% CI: 2.0–3.0). Women with current or recent unintended pregnancy (vs. intended pregnancy) had higher adjusted odds of being single (AOR: 1.94; 95% CI: 1.10, 3.42), younger at time of conception (AOR: 0.95 per year increase, 95% CI: 0.90, 0.99), and being born in Canada (AOR: 2.76, 95% CI: 1.55, 4.92). Conclusion Nearly one-quarter of women reported pregnancy after HIV diagnosis, with 61% of all pregnancies reported as unintended. Integrated HIV and reproductive health care programming is required to better support WLWH to optimize pregnancy planning and outcomes and to prevent unintended pregnancy."

Previous research has provided valuable insight in global Achilles tendon mechanics, but limitations with the technique used remain. Furthermore, given the global approach evaluating muscle-tendon junction to insertion, regional differences in tendon mechanical properties might be overlooked. However, recent advancements in the field of ultrasound imaging in combination with speckle tracking have made an intratendinous evaluation possible. This study uses high-frequency ultrasound to allow for quantification of regional tendon deformation. Also, an interactive application was developed to improve clinical applicability. A dynamic ultrasound of both Achilles tendons of ten asymptomatic subjects was taken. The displacement and regional strain in the superficial, middle and deep layer were evaluated during passive elongation and isometric contraction. Building on previous research, results showed that the Achilles tendon displaces non-uniformly with a higher displacement found in the deep layer of the tendon. Adding to this, a non-uniform regional strain behavior was found in the Achilles tendon during passive elongation, with the highest strain in the superficial layer. Further exploration of tendon mechanics will improve the knowledge on etiology of tendinopathy and provide options to optimize existing therapeutic loading programs."
https://openalex.org/W2736432040,"Early mobilization and rehabilitation, multidisciplinary stroke expertise and comprehensive therapies are fundamental in a stroke unit. To achieve effective and safe stroke care, the physical environment in modern stroke units should facilitate the delivery of evidence-based care. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to explore patients’ activities and interactions in a stroke unit before the reconstruction of the physical environment, while in a temporary location and after reconstruction. This case study examined a stroke unit as an integrated whole. The data were collected using a behavioral mapping technique at three different time points: in the original unit, in the temporary unit and in the new unit. A total of 59 patients were included. The analysis included field notes from observations of the physical environment and examples from planning and design documents. The findings indicated that in the new unit, the patients spent more time in their rooms, were less active, and had fewer interactions with staff and family than the patients in the original unit. The reconstruction involved a change from a primarily multi-bed room design to single-room accommodations. In the new unit, the patients’ lounge was located in a far corner of the unit with a smaller entrance than the patients’ lounge in the old unit, which was located at the end of a corridor with a noticeable entrance. Changes in the design of the stroke unit may have influenced the patients’ activities and interactions. This study raises the question of how the physical environment should be designed in the future to facilitate the delivery of health care and improve outcomes for stroke patients. This research is based on a case study, and although the results should be interpreted with caution, we strongly recommend that environmental considerations be included in future stroke guidelines."
https://openalex.org/W2737606003,"The receptor tyrosine kinase family consisting of Tyro3, Axl, and Mer (TAM) is one of the most recently identified receptor tyrosine kinase families. TAM receptors are up-regulated postnatally and maintained at high levels in adults. They all play an important role in immunity, but Axl has also been implicated in cancer and therefore is a target in the discovery and development of novel therapeutics. However, of the three members of the TAM family, the Axl kinase domain is the only one that has so far eluded structure determination. To this end, using differential scanning fluorimetry and hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, we show here that a lower stability and greater dynamic nature of the Axl kinase domain may account for its poor crystallizability. We present the first structural characterization of the Axl kinase domain in complex with a small-molecule macrocyclic inhibitor. The Axl crystal structure revealed two distinct conformational states of the enzyme, providing a first glimpse of what an active TAM receptor kinase may look like and suggesting a potential role for the juxtamembrane region in enzyme activity. We noted that the ATP/inhibitor-binding sites of the TAM members closely resemble each other, posing a challenge for the design of a selective inhibitor. We propose that the differences in the conformational dynamics among the TAM family members could potentially be exploited to achieve inhibitor selectivity for targeted receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2737936804,"Background The antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is defined by simultaneous presence of vascular clinical events and antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL). The aPL considered as diagnostics are lupus anticoagulant and antibodies anticardiolipin (aCL) and anti-ß2 glycoprotein-I (aB2GP1). During recent years, IgA aB2GP1 antibodies have been associated with thrombotic events both in patients positive, and mainly negative for other aPL, however its value as a pro-thrombotic risk-factor in asymptomatic patients has not been well defined. Objective To test the role of IgA anti B2GP1 as a risk factor for the development of APS-events (thrombosis or pregnancy morbidity) in asymptomatic population with a 5-year follow-up. Methods 244 patients isolated positive for anti-beta2-glycoprotein I IgA (Group-1 study) and 221 negative patients (Group-2 control) were studied. All the patients were negative for IgG and IgM aCL. Results During the follow-up, 45 patients (9.7%) had APS-events, 38 positive for IgA-aB2GP1 and 7 negative (15.6% vs 3.2%, p<0.001). The incidence rate of APS-events was 3.1% per year in IgA-aB2GP1 positive patients and 0.6% per year in the control group. Arterial thrombosis were the most frequent APS-events (N = 25, 55%) and were mainly observed in Group-1 patients (21 vs 4, p = 0.001). Multivariate analysis were shown as independent risk-factors for the development of APS-events, age, sex (men) and presence of IgA-aB2GP1 (odds ratio 5.25, 95% CI 2.24 to 12.32). Conclusion The presence of IgA-aB2GP1 in people with no history of APS-events is the main independent risk factor for the development of these types of events, mainly arterial thrombosis."

Psychological research has shown that mind perception correlates with moral judgments and that immoral behaviors (i.e., intentional harm) facilitate mind perception toward otherwise mindless victims. We conducted a vignette experiment (N = 129; Mage = 21.8 ± 6.0 years) concerning human-robot interactions and extended previous research’s results in two ways. First, mind perception toward the robot was facilitated when it received a benevolent behavior, although only when participants took the perspective of an actor. Second, imagining a benevolent interaction led to more positive attitudes toward the robot, and this effect was mediated by mind perception. These results help predict what people’s reactions in future human-robot interactions would be like, and have implications for how to design future social rules about the treatment of robots."

The greatest hydrolysis rate on corn starch granule was observed with α-amylase, followed by gluco- and β-amylases. Temperature increase enhanced glucoamylase reaction rate more drastically than other enzyme treatments. Final hydrolysis level with glucoamylase reached to 66.9%, close to 67.5% of α-amylolysis. The α-amylase-treated PSGs displayed the greatest pore size and ratio of cavity-to-granule diameters. Gelatinization onset temperatures of PSGs increased to 72.1 (α-), 68.7 (β-), and 68.1°C (gluco-amylolysis) after 8 h; enthalpy changes of β- and gluco-amylase-treated PSGs increased to 13.4, and 13.1 J/g but α-amylase-treated one showed slightly reduced value of 8.5 J/g. Water holding capacities of PSGs were 209.7 (α-), 94.6 (β-), and 133.8% (gluco-amylolysis), and the untreated control had 89.1%; oil holding capacities of them showed 304.5, 182.7, and 211.5%, respectively, while the untreated control had 161.8%. Thus, enzyme types and their reaction conditions can be applied to generate desirable cavity and pore sizes in starch granules. This biocatalytic approach could contribute to develop tailor-made PSGs with distinct internal structure for specific uses in wide range of food, pharmaceutical and other industrial applications."

We aimed to determine whether hypoalbuminemia (HA) at admission could be a risk factor for the development of AKI and mortality in hospitalized patients.We enrolled patients who were admitted to Seoul National University Bundang Hospital from January 2013 to December 2013. HA at admission was defined as a serum albumin level < 3.4 mg/dL measured within two days after admission. AKI was defined as an increase in the serum creatinine level by ≥0.3 mg/dL or ≥1.5 times of the baseline value during the hospital stay.A total of 19,472 patients were enrolled and divided into HA and normoalbuminemia (NA) groups at admission. The incidence of AKI was 10.7% (340/3179) in the HA group and 4.1% (662/16293) in the NA group (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.243; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.069-1.445; P = 0.005). The hazard ratios for the 30-day, 90-day, and 1-year mortality were 1.873 (95% CI, 1.383-2.537; P < 0.001), 1.710 (95% CI, 1.410-2.072; P < 0.001), and 1.372 (95% CI, 1.214-1.551; P < 0.001), compared to the NA group. In patients with AKI, albumin replacement improved renal recovery (OR, 2.605; 95% CI, 1.450-4.681; P = 0.001). The mortality rate was not different according to albumin replacement.HA is associated with the development of AKI and high mortality in hospitalized patients. Replacement of albumin after the development of AKI may contribute to renal recovery. Further clinical trials are warranted."

Insulin-mediated transcription of Atgl, the enzyme that mediates the rate-limiting step in lipolysis, is a key point of this regulation. Under conditions such as obesity or insulin resistance, Atgl transcription is often misregulated, which can contribute to overall disease progression. The mechanisms by which Atgl is induced during adipogenesis are not fully understood. We utilized computational approaches to identify putative transcriptional regulatory elements in Atgl and then tested the effect of these elements and the transcription factors that bind to them in cultured preadipocytes and mature adipocytes. Here we report that Atgl is down-regulated by the basal transcription factor Sp1 in preadipocytes and that the magnitude of down-regulation depends on interactions between Sp1 and peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor γ (PPARγ). In mature adipocytes, when PPARγ is abundant, PPARγ abrogated transcriptional repression by Sp1 at the Atgl promoter and up-regulated Atgl mRNA expression. Targeting the PPARγ–Sp1 interaction could be a potential therapeutic strategy to restore insulin sensitivity by modulating Atgl levels in adipocytes.

Under normal physiological conditions, plasma levels of NEFAs are controlled via clearance of circulating FAs and storage as TGs in adipose tissue. After meals, the pool of plasma NEFAs is increased by as much as 50% by lipoprotein lipase–mediated cleavage of newly circulating TGs, whereas basal-level mobilization of NEFAs by lipolysis in adipose tissue is impaired by the release of insulin (1.Lafontan M.

Obese individuals display several altered characteristics in this process, including decreased ability of adipose tissue to mobilize stored lipids, loss of insulin-mediated inhibition of NEFA release, and a general increase in plasma NEFA levels. There remains substantial debate regarding the meaning of the correlation between increased hypertrophy of adipocytes and high plasma NEFA levels in obesity (1.Lafontan M. Langin D.

The initial and rate-limiting step in TG breakdown is mediated by the enzyme ATGL, which yields the metabolites FA and diacylglycerol. The predominant mechanism by which insulin regulates Atgl is via transcriptional control (6.Kershaw E.E. Hamm J.K. Verhagen L.A. Peroni O. Katic M. Flier J.S.

Insulin activates the mTORC1 pathway and simultaneously stimulates transcription of the transcription factor Egr1 in a mTORC1-dependent manner.

Transcription of Atgl is regulated by insulin, and insulin-mediated gene expression can be mediated via binding of the transcription factor Sp1 to specific promoters, which is itself transcriptionally regulated by insulin (31.Pan X. Solomon S.S. Borromeo D.M. Martinez-Hernandez A. Raghow R.

In addition, PPARγ mediates transcription of target genes via a functional interaction with Sp1 (25.Sugawara A. Uruno A. Kudo M. Ikeda Y. Sato K. Taniyama Y. Ito S. Takeuchi K. Transcription suppression of thromboxane receptor gene by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ via an interaction with Sp1 in vascular smooth muscle cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9676-9683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This inspired us to investigate the involvement of insulin-responsive Sp1 in the regulation of Atgl and to explore the potential of the PPARγ–Sp1 interaction to regulate Atgl gene expression during adipocyte differentiation. Analysis of approximately 3 kb of the DNA sequence immediately upstream of the Atgl transcription start site by Genomatix and TRANSFAC matrices revealed a putative Sp1-binding site at the minimal promoter (−50 to −36 bp). This site is conserved across numerous species, including mice and humans, suggesting an important biological function (Fig. 1A). Therefore, to test the involvement and mechanism of Sp1 in regulating the expression of Atgl, 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were co-transfected with luciferase reporter constructs of varying 5′ end deletions of the Atgl promoter and an Sp1 expression vector. Sp1 overexpression significantly decreased luciferase activity across all Atgl promoter constructs, indicating that Sp1 binding at the minimal promoter region (−192 to +21) can negatively affect Atgl expression (Fig. 1B). We examined the predicted Sp1-binding site by selectively mutating five conserved nucleotides (−46 5′-CCGCC-3′ −42), as shown in Fig. 1C. These mutations completely prevented the inhibitory effect of Sp1 on the minimal promoter of Atgl (Fig. 1D), confirming the involvement of this site in the transcriptional inhibition of Atgl. When 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were transfected with variable-length Atgl promoter-luciferase reporter constructs and incubated with mithramycin A, an Sp1 inhibitor, for 24 h, it also abrogated the inhibitory effect of endogenous Sp1 when transfected with the −192/+21 and −373/+21 constructs containing the Sp1-binding site (Fig. 1E). This further demonstrates that Sp1 exerts inhibitory control over Atgl gene expression via the Sp1-binding site at −36 to −50. The significance of Sp1 on endogenous Atgl gene expression was further investigated by Sp1 depletion and overexpression studies in 3T3-L1 cells. Knockdown of Sp1 in preadipocytes via a lentiviral vector producing shRNA targeting Sp1 increased the mRNA levels of Atgl relative to a control shRNA (Fig. 2, A and B). Conversely, overexpression of Sp1 in cultured adipocytes by electroporation (Fig. 2, C and D) resulted in lower expression levels of ATGL mRNA and protein (Fig. 2, E and F) with a concomitant reduction in basal glycerol release in the medium (Fig. 2G). In addition, cultured preadipocytes treated with mithramycin A (10 μm) showed significant increase in ATGL levels both in the presence and absence of insulin (Fig. 2H). Also, in the presence of insulin, mithramycin A decreased Sp1 mRNA levels and increased Atgl mRNA levels (Fig. 2G). Collectively, this demonstrates that Sp1 mediates the negative regulation of Atgl in preadipocytes. The data further support that Sp1 reduces glycerol release in adipocytes via mechanisms that involve Atgl. Levels of PPARγ protein increase dramatically during adipogenesis, correlating with an increase in Atgl mRNA and protein levels (supplemental Fig. 1). Bioinformatic analyses identified putative PPARγ-binding sites in the Atgl promoter at −2424, −1674, and −1573 bp (14.Kim J.Y. Tillison K. Lee J.H. Rearick D.A. Smas C.M.

To test this, PPARγ and Sp1 overexpression plasmids were co-transfected with wild-type or Sp1 site–mutated −2979/+21 bp Atgl promoter constructs in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes.

Upon mutation of the Sp1-binding site in the full-length Atgl promoter, PPARγ overexpression no longer induced Atgl expression (Fig. 3A). These data suggest that the Sp1 site (−50 bp to −36 bp) contributes to the regulation of Atgl by PPARγ in the context of the −2979 to +21 promoter construct. The Sp1-mediated transcriptional repression of Atgl in preadipocytes allows transcriptional activation by PPARγ during adipocyte differentiation. Furthermore, the presence of the Sp1 site has a positive effect on PPARγ-mediated transcriptional activation of the Atgl promoter. To further support this hypothesis, PPARγ overexpression alone or with Sp1 did not induce reporter activity of the shorter Atgl promoter fragment (−192/+21) in either the presence or absence of the Sp1 mutation (Fig. 3B). Taken together, we speculate that induction of PPARγ expression during adipogenesis reverses the negative control of Sp1 over Atgl transcription, presumably via direct interaction with Sp1. The fact that PPARγ increases luciferase activity in the presence of Sp1 in the full-length promoter but not in the minimal promoter fragment shows that PPARγ stimulates Atgl transcription via binding sites upstream of −192 and by interacting directly with the Sp1-binding site at −50 bp to −36 bp. We speculate that the Sp1-mediated transcriptional down-regulation that is reversed by PPARγ is a stoichiometric transcriptional phenomenon in which there is a reversal of the role of the transcription complex, depending upon the available transcription factor levels. To further test this hypothesis, we knocked down PPARγ in preadipocytes via shRNA (Fig. 3C, left panel). PPARγ deficiency decreased Atgl mRNA levels (Fig. 3C, right panel), further supporting the conclusion that PPARγ is a positive transcriptional regulator of Atgl in preadipocytes via mechanisms that involve its interaction with Sp1 and inhibition of the Sp1-mediated negative regulation of Atgl transcription. As the data suggested that Sp1 is a negative regulator of Atgl transcription in preadipocytes and that PPARγ overrides this process, we further investigated the importance of the Sp1-binding site on PPARγ-mediated transactivation of Atgl transcription. During adipogenesis, there is a decrease in the nuclear levels of Sp1 and an increase in PPARγ levels in 3T3-L1 cells (supplemental Fig. 1). We co-transfected 3T3-L1 preadipocytes with full-length Atgl luciferase reporter constructs containing mutations at both the Sp1 (−50 bp to −36 bp) and PPARγ-binding sites (−2428 bp to −2408 bp). We did not observe an increase in reporter activity by overexpression of PPARγ or PPARγ and Sp1 combined (Fig. 4A). PPARγ alone did not increase luciferase activity either in the presence or absence of the PPARγ agonist rosiglitazone. This indicates that the effect of the PPARγ-binding site is to positively drive transcription of Atgl. In mature adipocytes, expression from the full-length Atgl promoter (−2979/+21) containing the PPARγ- and Sp1-binding sites was significantly greater than that from the minimal promoter (−192/+21) containing only the Sp1-binding site (Fig. 4B), suggesting a positive regulatory role of PPARγ. Interestingly, mutation of the Sp1-binding site in the full-length promoter that contains the PPARγ-binding site decreased Atgl reporter expression (Fig. 4B), suggesting a positive role of Sp1 in Atgl transcription in mature adipocytes, where PPARγ is abundant. This effect is lost in the minimal promoter lacking the PPARγ-binding site (Fig. 4B) and is in contrast to the data from preadipocytes, in which mutation of the Sp1 site in the full-length promoter increased expression of the Atgl reporter construct (Fig. 3A). Together, this suggests that PPARγ-mediated transactivation of Atgl is partially driven by the Sp1-binding site and that PPARγ binding to the promoter is essential to positively drive transcription of Atgl in mature adipocytes. Interestingly, this regulation is cell-type specific, as a luciferase reporter assay performed using Sp1 overexpression vectors and the full-length Atgl promoter construct in MEF and C2C12 cells did not result in the reduction in luciferase activity that was detected in preadipocytes (Figs. 1B and 4C). To examine the physical interaction between Sp1 and PPARγ proteins, co-immunoprecipitations were performed from 3T3-L1 protein lysates; they demonstrated that Sp1 interacts with PPARγ in this cell type (Fig. 4E). In addition, ChIP analysis of Sp1 binding to the minimal Atgl promoter identified Sp1 genomic occupancy at the Atgl1 promoter in both preadipoctyes and mature adipocytes (Fig. 4F). Taken together, these data support the hypothesis that Sp1 and PPARγ coordinately directly regulate Atgl transcription in a cell type- and stage-dependent manner that is governed by the changes in PPARγ abundance that occur during adipocyte differentiation (Fig. 5). It has been well-documented that active transcriptional complexes can adopt alternative functions when bound to additional co-activators or co-repressors (35.Barolo S. Posakony J.W.

For example, Klf1 is a transcription factor that exhibits alternate functions in hematopoietic cells, depending on the stage of development. In erythroid cells, a primitive cell type, Klf1 functions as an activator of β-globin expression. However, in hematopoietic cells, a definitive cell type, Klf1 switches to function as a repressor of β-globin expression (38.Chen X. Bieker J.J. Stage-specific repression by the EKLF transcriptional activator.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 10416-10424Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). As Sp1 is a prominent member of the KLF family of transcription factors, similar mechanisms could explain the transcriptional switch identified in this study. Our results showed that the shortest fragment of the Atgl promoter (−192/+21) contains an evolutionarily conserved Sp1-binding site that is capable of inhibiting Atgl transcription when Sp1 is overexpressed exogenously. This negative impact of Sp1 on Atgl transcription is modulated by PPARγ. In addition, cell type–specific responses were observed. In MEFs, which produce negligible amounts of PPARγ, a positive regulation of the Atgl promoter was observed when Sp1 was expressed exogenously, further supporting the critical nature of the cellular transcription factor milieu in Atgl gene regulation. In adipocytes, we found that Sp1 allows PPARγ-mediated transactivation via a protein–protein interaction between Sp1 and PPARγ (Fig. 4E). PPARγ-mediated transactivation of the Atgl promoter decreased when the conserved Sp1 overlapping binding site at the proximal promoter was mutated (Fig. 4B). We propose that, although Sp1 maintains a steady promoter binding at the minimal promoter, as identified by ChIP analysis (Fig. 4F), and PPARγ and Sp1 directly interact (Fig. 4E), there is a complete reversal of the repressive transcription complex to an activating transcription complex during adipogenesis that governs the fate of Atgl transcription (Fig. 5). PPARγ heterodimerizes with RXRα, binds to peroxisomal proliferator response elements, and exhibits ligand-induced transactivation of gene expression (39.Juge-Aubry C. Pernin A. Favez T. Burger A.G.

On Santa Cruz Island, the abundance of introduced plant species is low in the arid lowlands of the Galapagos National Park, but increases with elevation into unprotected humid highlands. Two common alien plant species, guava (Psidium guajava) and passion fruit (Passiflora edulis) occur at higher elevations yet their seeds are dispersed into the lowlands by migrating Galapagos tortoises (Chelonoidis spp.). Tortoises transport large quantities of seeds over long distances into environments in which they have little or no chance of germination and survival under current climate conditions. However, climate change is projected to modify environmental conditions on Galapagos with unknown consequences for the distribution of native and introduced biodiversity. We quantified seed dispersal of guava and passion fruit in tortoise dung piles and the distribution of adult plants along two elevation gradients on Santa Cruz to assess current levels of ‘wasted’ seed dispersal. We computed species distribution models for both taxa under current and predicted future climate conditions. Assuming that tortoise migratory behaviour continues, current levels of “wasted” seed dispersal in lowlands were projected to decline dramatically in the future for guava but not for passion fruit. Tortoises will facilitate rapid range expansion for guava into lowland areas within the Galapagos National Park where this species is currently absent. Coupled with putative reduction in arid habitat for native species caused by climate change, tortoise driven guava invasion will pose a serious threat to local plant communities."
https://openalex.org/W2739026359,"Skin cancer is the most common cancer, and exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, namely UVA and UVB, is the major risk factor for skin cancer development. UVA is significantly less effective in causing direct DNA damage than UVB, but UVA has been shown to increase skin cancer risk. The mechanism by which UVA contributes to skin cancer remains unclear. Here, using RNA-Seq, we show that UVA induces autophagy and lysosomal gene expression, including the autophagy receptor and substrate p62. We found that UVA activates transcription factor EB (TFEB), a known regulator of autophagy and lysosomal gene expression, which, in turn, induces p62 transcription. Next, we identified a novel relationship between p62 and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), a prostaglandin synthase critical for skin cancer development. COX-2 expression was up-regulated by UVA-induced p62, suggesting that p62 plays a role in UVA-induced skin cancer. Moreover, we found that p62 stabilizes COX-2 protein through the p62 ubiquitin-associated domain and that p62 regulates prostaglandin E2 production in vitro In a syngeneic squamous cell carcinoma mouse model, p62 knockdown inhibited tumor growth and metastasis. Furthermore, p62-deficient tumors exhibited reduced immune cell infiltration and increased cell differentiation. Because prostaglandin E2 is known to promote pro-tumorigenic immune cell infiltration, increase proliferation, and inhibit keratinocyte differentiation in vivo, this work suggests that UVA-induced p62 acts through COX-2 to promote skin tumor growth and progression. These findings expand our understanding of UVA-induced skin tumorigenesis and tumor progression and suggest that targeting p62 can help prevent or treat UVA-associated skin cancer."

Ideally, this is accomplished under as low sequencing coverage as possible. Here we report our attempt to meet these goals with a novel library construction and library amplification methodology. In our approach, single-cell genomic DNA is first fragmented with saturated transposition to make a primary library that uniformly covers the whole genome by short fragments. The library is then amplified by a carefully optimized PCR protocol in a uniform and synchronized fashion for next-generation sequencing. Each step of the protocol can be quantitatively characterized. Our shallow sequencing data show that the library is tightly distributed and is useful for the determination of copy number variations."
https://openalex.org/W2738937083,"Candidaemia is a bloodstream infection caused by Candida species that primarily affects specific groups of at-risk patients. Because only small candidaemia patient cohorts are available, classical genome wide association cannot be used to identify Candida susceptibility genes. Therefore, we have applied an integrative genomics approach to identify novel susceptibility genes and pathways for candidaemia. Candida-induced transcriptome changes in human primary leukocytes were assessed by RNA sequencing. Genetic susceptibility to candidaemia was assessed using the Illumina immunochip platform for genotyping of a cohort of 217 patients. We then integrated genetics data with gene-expression profiles, Candida-induced cytokine production capacity, and circulating concentrations of cytokines. Based on the intersection of transcriptome pathways and genomic data, we prioritized 31 candidate genes for candidaemia susceptibility. This group of genes was enriched with genes involved in inflammation, innate immunity, complement, and hemostasis. We then validated the role of MAP3K8 in cytokine regulation in response to Candida stimulation. Here, we present a new framework for the identification of susceptibility genes for infectious diseases that uses an unbiased, hypothesis-free, systems genetics approach. By applying this approach to candidaemia, we identified novel susceptibility genes and pathways for candidaemia, and future studies should assess their potential as therapeutic targets."

RS has been demonstrated in motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) induced with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Here, we investigated the effect of inter-train interval (ITI) on the induction of RS of MEPs with the attempt to optimize the investigative protocols. Trains of TMS pulses, targeted to the primary motor cortex by neuronavigation, were applied at a stimulation intensity of 120% of the resting motor threshold. The stimulus trains included either four or twenty pulses with an inter-stimulus interval (ISI) of 1 s. The ITI was here defined as the interval between the last pulse in a train and the first pulse in the next train; the ITIs used here were 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 12, and 17 s. RS was observed with all ITIs except with the ITI of 1 s, in which the ITI was equal to ISI. RS was more pronounced with longer ITIs. Shorter ITIs may not allow sufficient time for a return to baseline. RS may reflect a startle-like response to the first pulse of a train followed by habituation. Longer ITIs may allow more recovery time and in turn demonstrate greater RS. Our results indicate that RS can be studied with confidence at relatively short ITIs of 6 s and above."
https://openalex.org/W2737448865,"Background In the diabetic heart the β-adrenergic response is altered partly by down-regulation of the β1-adrenoceptor, reducing its positive inotropic effect and up-regulation of the β3-adrenoceptor, increasing its negative inotropic effect. Statins have clinical benefits on morbidity and mortality in diabetic patients which are attributed to their “pleiotropic” effects. The objective of our study was to investigate the role of statin treatment on β-adrenergic dysfunction in diabetic rat cardiomyocytes. Methods β-adrenergic responses were investigated in vivo (echocardiography) and ex vivo (left ventricular papillary muscles) in healthy and streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats, who were pre-treated or not by oral atorvastatin over 15 days (50 mg.kg-1.day-1). Micro-array analysis and immunoblotting were performed in left ventricular homogenates. Data are presented as mean percentage of baseline ± SD. Results Atorvastatin restored the impaired positive inotropic effect of β-adrenergic stimulation in diabetic hearts compared with healthy hearts both in vivo and ex vivo but did not suppress the diastolic dysfunction of diabetes. Atorvastatin changed the RNA expression of 9 genes in the β-adrenergic pathway and corrected the protein expression of β1-adrenoceptor and β1/β3-adrenoceptor ratio, and multidrug resistance protein 4 (MRP4). Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibition abolished the beneficial effects of atorvastatin on the β-adrenoceptor response. Conclusions Atorvastatin restored the positive inotropic effect of the β-adrenoceptor stimulation in diabetic cardiomyopathy. This effect is mediated by multiple modifications in expression of proteins in the β-adrenergic signaling pathway, particularly through the NOS pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2739018154,"Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) is the most aggressive malignancy of the thyroid, during which undifferentiated tumors arise from the thyroid follicular epithelium. ATC has a very poor prognosis due to its aggressive behavior and poor response to conventional therapies. Gene-directed enzyme/prodrug therapy using genetically engineered mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) is a promising therapeutic strategy. The doxycycline (DOX)-controlled Tet inducible system is the most widely utilized regulatory system and could be a useful tool for therapeutic gene-based therapies. For example, use a synthetic “tetracycline-on” switch system to control the expression of the therapeutic gene thymidine kinase, which converts prodrugs to active drugs. The aim of this study was to develop therapeutic MSCs, harboring an inducible suicide gene, and to validate therapeutic gene expression using optical molecular imaging of ATC. We designed the Tet-On system using a retroviral vector expressing herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV1-sr39TK) with dual reporters (eGFP-Fluc2). Mouse bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSC) were transduced using this system with (MSC-Tet-TK/Fluc2) or without (MSC-TK/Fluc) the Tet-On system. Transduced cells were screened and characterized. Engineered MSCs were co-cultured with ATC (CAL62/Rluc) cells in the presence of the prodrug ganciclovir (GCV) and stimulated with DOX. The efficiency of cell killing monitored by assessing Rluc (CAL62/Rluc) and Fluc (MSC-Tet-TK/Fluc and MSC-TK/Fluc) activities using IVIS imaging. Fluc activity increased in MSC-Tet-TK/Fluc cells in a dose dependent manner following DOX treatment (R2 = 0.95), whereas no signal was observed in untreated cells. eGFP could also be visualized after induction with DOX, and the HSV1-TK protein could be detected by western blotting. In MSC-TK/Fluc cells, the Fluc activity increased with increasing cell number (R2 = 0.98), and eGFP could be visualized by fluorescence microscopy. The Fluc activity and cell viability of MSC-Tet-TK/Fluc and MSC-TK/Fluc cells decreased significantly following GCV treatment. A bystander effect of the therapeutic cells confirmed in co-cultures of CAL62 cells, an anaplastic thyroid cancer cell line, with either MSC-Tet-TK/Fluc cells or MSC-TK/Fluc cells. The Rluc activity in MSC-Tet-TK/Fluc co-cultures, derived from the CAL62/Rluc cells, decreased significantly with GCV treatment of DOX treated cultures, whereas no significant changes were observed in untreated cultures. In addition, the Fluc activity of MSC-Tet-TK/Fluc cells also decreased significantly with DOX treatment whereas no signal was present in untreated cultures. A bystander effect also be demonstrated in co-cultures with MSC-TK/Fluc cells and CAL62/Rluc; both the Rluc activity and the Fluc activity were significantly decreased following GCV treatment. We have successfully developed a Tet-On system of gene-directed enzyme/prodrug delivery using MSCs. We confirmed the therapeutic bystander effect in CAL62/Rluc cells with respect to MSC-Tet-TK/Fluc and MSC-TK/Fluc cells after GCV treatment with and without DOX. Our results confirm the therapeutic efficiency of a suicide gene, with or without the Tet-On system, for ATC therapy. In addition, our findings provide an innovative therapeutic approach for using the Tet-On system to eradicate tumors by simple, repeated administration of MSC-Tet-TK/Fluc cells with DOX and GCV."

Direct high-affinity binding of hPg/plasmin to pattern D GAS is fully recapitulated by the hPg kringle 2 domain (K2hPg) and a short internal peptide region (a1a2) of a specific subtype of bacterial surface M protein, present in all GAS pattern D strains. To better understand the nature of this binding, critical to the virulence of many GAS skin-tropic strains, we used high-resolution NMR to define the interaction of recombinant K2hPg with recombinant a1a2 (VKK38) of the M protein from GAS isolate NS455. We found a 2:1 (m/m) binding stoichiometry of K2hPg/VKK38, with the lysine-binding sites of two K2hPg domains anchored to two regions of monomeric VKK38. The K2hPg/VKK38 binding altered the VKK38 secondary structure from a helical apo-peptide with a flexible center to an end-to-end K2hPg-bound α-helix. The K2hPg residues occupied opposite faces of this helix, an arrangement that minimized steric clashing of K2hPg. We conclude that VKK38 provides two conformational lysine isosteres that each interact with the lysine-binding sites in K2hPg. Further, the adoption of an α-helix by VKK38 upon binding to K2hPg sterically optimizes the side chains of VKK38 for maximal binding to K2hPg and minimizes steric overlap between the K2hPg domains.

Although penicillin-type antibiotics are effective drugs against GAS diseases, more virulent pathovars have emerged because of the ability of this microbe to remodel its genome to adapt to specialized environmental niches within the host. These changes primarily occur through intra- and interspecies horizontal transfer and recombination of genetic materials, including integration of prophages and their associated virulence genes (e.g. superantigens) (1.Ochman H.

Among these virulence determinants, the single-chain, surface-resident multifunctional M protein, present as a single type on all GAS strains, and utilized for GAS serotyping, is of particular relevance because it is used by GAS for a variety of survival benefits (e.g. adhesion to host cells (7.Frick I.M.

PAM is a ∼42-kDa single-chain protein, assembled as a dimer in the mature protein, that has evolved in a modular fashion. The hypervariable N terminus of PAM-type M proteins contains two short A domain repeats (a1a2) that have been identified as the binding determinants for hPg (17.Berge A. Sjöbring U.

The resulting structural model that was developed involved the formation of an internal conformational isostere of lysine from side chains of VEK30 (His17, Arg18, and Glu20). Their proper orientation depended on the adoption of a VEK30 α-helix upon binding. However, the KD of this interaction was ∼30–50-fold weaker than that of the PAM53–K2hPg complex. A redesign of VEK30 resulting from an addition of two C-terminal amino acids (30RH31) from PAM53 or five C-terminal amino acids (30RHDHD34) from PAM53 (Table 1) strengthened the binding affinity of the resulting peptides (VEK32 and VEK35, respectively) to that of full-length PAM53 (12.Bhattacharya S.

Open table in a new tab The results presented herein demonstrate for the first time that a peptide, VKK38, from a PAM-containing isolate, NS455, harbors two binding sites for K2hPg. Upon binding to K2hPg, VKK38 undergoes a conformational transition from a predominantly random coil to an end-to-end α-helix. Overall, the data obtained reveal a mechanism for binding of PAM to hPg that will facilitate the targeting of these virulence factors of GAS in disease management. The PAM-subtype M protein is present in all pattern D GAS serotypes, and its sequence variability in different GAS isolates provides natural mutations in which to assess the nature of its various functions. The most well-studied PAM was originally extracted from GAS isolate AP53 (18.Wistedt A.C. Ringdahl U. Müller-Esterl W. Sjøbring U. Identification of a plasminogen-binding motif in PAM, a bacterial surface protein.Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 569-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). GAS NS455 is another pattern D direct hPg-binding isolate (28.McKay F.C. McArthur J.D. Sanderson-Smith M.L. Gardam S. Currie B.J. Sriprakash K.S. Fagan P.K. Towers R.J. Batzloff M.R. Chhatwal G.S. Ranson M. Walker M.J. Plasminogen binding by group A streptococcal isolates from a region of hyperendemicity for streptococcal skin infection and a high incidence of invasive infection.Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 364-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and we aligned PAMs from AP53 (PAM53) and NS455 (PAM455) to determine the extent to which these two proteins from different pattern D strains were similar (Fig. 1). At the N termini, the signal peptides (residues 1–41) of the two PAMs exhibit very high homology; however, low homology was observed in the immediate downstream hypervariable domains, thus accounting for their different serotypes (emm53 for AP53 and emm52 for NS455). Following the hypervariable region are the a1 (residues Val97–Glu115) and a2 (residues Glu116–Asp130) repeats in PAM53 and, correspondingly, Val103–Glu124 and Glu125–Asp139 in PAM455. Both proteins have two RH dipeptides, one in the a1 region (113RH114 in PAM53 and 119RH120 in PAM455) and another in the a2 segment (126RH127 in PAM53 and 135RH136 in PAM455). These RH residues, supported by Glu125 in PAM53, are most relevant for formation of the lysine isostere needed for hPg binding. hPg binding occurs at RH1 and/or RH2. It is noteworthy that at the end of the a1 repeat in PAM455, a tripeptide insertion, 121VHD123, was found that interrupted the relative orientation of Glu125 with RH1. One central issue in this study is whether this VHD natural insert would make a significant difference in the hPg-binding pattern and structure of PAM455 compared with PAM53. Other important domains are present in all M proteins. In PAM-type M proteins, downstream of the a2 region, somewhat higher homology is seen in the B-like repeats. The C1–C3 repeats, the D-repeats, and the Pro-Gly (PG) region, used for pattern mapping, have high homology between the PAM proteins. Both PAMs have been identified as pattern D subtypes with high tropism for skin infections (29.Bessen D.E. Izzo M.W. Fiorentino T.R. Caringal R.M. Hollingshead S.K. Beall B. Genetic linkage of exotoxin alleles and emm gene markers for tissue tropism in group A streptococci.J. Infect. Dis. 1999; 179: 627-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In addition, the downstream sortase A motifs were identical, thus ensuring that both mature PAMs are covalently anchored to the cell wall. The binding affinities of full-length PAMs to hPg or of VEK/VKK peptides (listed in Table 1) to K2hPg were assessed by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). The prototype PAM53 has strong binding ability to hPg, with a KD of ∼1 nm, consistent with previous results (12.Bhattacharya S. Liang Z. Quek A.J. Ploplis V.A. Law R. Castellino F.J. Dimerization is not a determining factor for functional high affinity human plasminogen binding by the group A streptococcal virulence factor PAM and is mediated by specific residues within the PAM a1a2 domain.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 21684-21693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Despite PAM455 containing a naturally occurring 121VHD123 motif immediately following the RH dipeptide in the a1 repeat (RH1), no effects on the binding affinity of PAM455 to hPg were found (Table 2). This is also true for the mutation D117A in PAM53 as well as the insertion (▾) of 115VHD117 or 115VHA117 into PAM53 at the end of the a1 domain. In addition, mutation of PAM455 to a form without the VHD tripepetide (PAM455/Δ121VHD123) also did not show a significant difference in hPg binding. Therefore, the presence of VHD at the end of the a1 region does not affect the binding of PAM to hPg.Table 2Binding isotherms of full-length PAMs to hPgProteinkon × 105koff × 10−4KDm−1 s−1s−1nmPAM535.6 ± 0.23.1 ± 0.10.6 ± 0.02PAM53/▾115VHA11712.4 ± 1.95.5 ± 0.60.5 ± 0.06PAM53/▾115VHD1179.1 ± 0.16.2 ± 2.00.7 ± 0.2PAM45510.8 ± 3.41.6 ± 0.080.2 ± 0.07PAM455/Δ121VHD1237.0 ± 0.33.1 ± 0.0020.46 ± 0.02 Open table in a new tab The truncated peptides, including a1a2 repeats from AP53 and NS455, have been constructed and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 cells. The expressed peptides are numbered from the Val1 at the beginning of the a1 domains; VEK peptides are from PAM53, and VKK peptides are from PAM455. Insertion of 19VHD21 into VEK peptides, VEK30 (VEK30/▾19VHD21), VEK32 (VEK32/▾19VHD21), and VEK35 (VEK35/▾19VHD21), does not change their binding affinities to hPg (Table 3). VEK30/▾19VHD21 exhibits a high dissociation rate; thus, we confirmed its KD to K2hPg using the SPR affinity method. A value of 59 ± 3 nm was determined for the KD of this interaction, which is comparable with that obtained from kinetic analysis of the binding (Fig. 2). It is noted that the binding affinity observed from VEK30 and VEK30/▾19VHD21 is about 50-fold weaker compared with that of VEK32 and VEK35, because VEK30 only harbors a single RH motif. Furthermore, VKK38, as the counterpart of VEK35, but with the 19VHD21 motif, binds to K2hPg with a KD of ∼1 nm, a value very similar to that of VEK35 (1.9 nm). Thus, both sets of binding data, from full-length PAMs to hPg and from VEK/VKK peptides to K2hPg, indicate that the VHD tripeptide that naturally occurs in some PAMs does not significantly affect the binding of these ligands to hPg and K2hPg.Table 3Binding constants of VEK/VKK peptides to K2hPgPeptideaThe KD values for VEK30/K2hPg (56 nm), VEK32/K2hPg (1.1 nm), and VEK35/K2hPg (1.9 nm) are taken from a previous publication (12).kon × 105koff × 10−4KDm−1 s−1s−1nmVEK30/▾19VHD21aThe KD values for VEK30/K2hPg (56 nm), VEK32/K2hPg (1.1 nm), and VEK35/K2hPg (1.9 nm) are taken from a previous publication (12).8.0 ± 0.7336 ± 242 ± 2VEK32/▾19VHD21aThe KD values for VEK30/K2hPg (56 nm), VEK32/K2hPg (1.1 nm), and VEK35/K2hPg (1.9 nm) are taken from a previous publication (12).67 ± 5.714 ± 1.00.2 ± 0.002VKK3827 ± 18.9 ± 0.20.3 ± 0.1a The KD values for VEK30/K2hPg (56 nm), VEK32/K2hPg (1.1 nm), and VEK35/K2hPg (1.9 nm) are taken from a previous publication (12.Bhattacharya S.

Open table in a new tab Because of the two RH groups in VKK38, it is important to demonstrate whether each RH motif binds to K2hPg separately. The binding properties of VKK38 to K2hPg were measured by combining isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC), and NMR titrations. ITC measurements were carried out by titrating a constant level of K2hPg in the cell with variable amounts of VKK38 and measuring the incremental liberation of heat (Fig. 3A). The exothermic reaction leveled after ∼40 μm of VKK38, implying saturation of all binding sites on VKK38 by K2hPg. At this stage, the concentration of K2hPg was ∼95 μm, and the molar ratio of VKK38–K2hPg was calculated as 0.42, suggesting a binding stoichiometry of 2:1 (m/m) for K2hPg–VKK38. These results were confirmed by determining the molecular weight of the VKK38–K2hPg complex utilizing AUC (Fig. 3B). To obtain the needed sample, VKK38 was mixed with excess K2hPg, and the tightly bound complex of VKK38 and K2hPg was separated from free components by passing the solution over a gel filtration column. The sequence-based calculated molecular masses of VKK38–K2hPg at a 1:1 (m/m) ratio and 1:2 (m/m) ratio were 14,451 and 25,170 Da, respectively. From AUC analysis, the apparent molecular mass of the complex was 22,890 ± 230 Da, suggesting that VKK38 possesses two binding sites for K2hPg. 1H-15N HSQC experiments were recorded on [15N]VKK38 samples titrated with increasing concentrations of unlabeled K2hPg. A tight VKK38–kringle 2 complex is suggested by the observation of two cross-peaks for a subset of the residues during the titration. Amide resonances of the residues at N and C termini of VKK38 were continually shifted until a plateau was reached at an ∼1:2 (m/m) ratio of VKK38 to K2hPg (Fig. 4A), again suggesting that two binding sites for K2hPg are present on VKK38 at the 1:2 VKK38/kringle 2 ratio. Two mutant peptides, VKK38/R17A/H18A and VKK38/R34A/H35A, were separately designed by replacing RH1 and RH2 with alanines to confirm the nature of the binding sites for K2hPg on VKK38. AUC analysis was then performed on the complex of VKK38/R17A/H18A–K2hPg and VKK38/R33A/H34A–K2hPg. Molecular masses of 12,500–15,500 Da were obtained for these complexes (supplemental Fig. 1S). These results further confirm that VKK38, comprising the a1a2 domain of PAM, contains two binding sites for K2hPg, and the binding is mediated by RH motifs in each repeat of the a1a2 domain. The structure prediction for VKK38 in its nonbound form was performed by use of the TALOS-N program on the basis of chemical shift data (Fig. 5A). NOESY spectra were analyzed to define the secondary and tertiary structure of apo-VKK38. However, most residues of apo-VKK38 only have sequential connectivities, suggesting a lack of secondary structural elements. The N- and C-terminal regions, residues Val1–Asp6 and Leu29–Tyr38, exist as random coils in VKK38. However, VKK38 has helical character formed by residues Glu7–Lys14 and Glu22–Arg28. These two α-helical segments are connected by a loop from residue Asn15 to Glu22, which contains RH1. The conformation of VKK38 changes significantly when it forms a complex with K2hPg, as has been demonstrated from chemical shift changes (Fig. 4B), secondary structure predictions using TALOS-N, and the solution structures generated by Xplor-NIH along with NOE restraints (Fig. 5C). Bound VKK38 shows an α-helix from Asn5 to Asp37. It is noted that in the nonbound form, the 19VHD21 motif and the second RH group (33RH34) are located in flexible loop regions but become more rigid in the complex. Compared with RH2 (33RH34), RH1 (17RH18) remains in a less structured region, which bends the helix in this region. As shown in Fig. 5C, the two RH groups are positioned on opposite faces of the VKK38 helix. However, RH2 is close to the C terminus, which leaves sufficient space for VKK38 to bind two K2hPg molecules. Importantly, we observe that when the bound forms of 17RH18 in VKK38 and VEK30 are overlaid, the position of Glu20 in VEK30 is replaced by Asp21 in VKK38 (Fig. 5D). On the same face with residues 17RH18 and Asp21, other charged residues are present (viz. Glu7, Lys14, Asp21, Glu25, Glu32, and Arg28). Meanwhile, the 33RH34 group with Asp37 exists on the opposite face with more uncharged residues (viz. Asn5, Val8, Val19, and Leu26). A previous structural study of the VEK30–K2hPg complex has shown that in K2hPg, a hydrophobic aromatic groove formed by Tyr35, Phe40, Trp60, Trp70, and Tyr72, combined with an anionic center formed by Asp54 and Asp56 and a cationic locus at Arg69, was predicte"

We investigated the perceptions of that factors associated with HIV vaccine trials participation among Black MSM and TW in New York. Methods Self-administered online questionnaires were administered to 18–29 years of NYC residents who identified as Black MSM and TW, assessing demographics, awareness and willingness to participate in HIV vaccine trials, barriers and facilitators associated with willingness, and sexual behaviors. Frequency summation was performed to determine barriers and facilitators, and logistic regression analysis was performed to determine factors association with expressed willingness. Results Black MSM and TW who reported engaging in risk behaviors had a 61% lower likelihood of participating in HIV vaccine trials when compared to those who did not report engaging in any risk behavior. Facilitators associated with trial participation were: cash compensation, confidentiality regarding participation, public transportation vouchers, gift cards, and food or grocery vouchers as potential facilitators for trial participation. Conversely, fear of side effects from the vaccine, concerns about testing positive on routine HIV testing due to an HIV vaccine, limited knowledge of research trials, and fear of being judged as HIV-positive were perceived as barriers. Conclusions These findings provided insights into the considerations and perceptions of Black MSM and TW towards HIV vaccine trials. However, further studies are needed to delineate the complex mechanisms underlying the decision-making process and establish approaches to increase study participation in this population."

Moreover, we introduce the Bernoulli distribution to balance the maximum values with the expected values of the feature mappings subspace. Finally, we design a simple model to verify the pooling ability of mixout units and a Mixout-units-based Network-in-Network (NiN) model to analyze the feature learning ability of the mixout models. We argue that our proposed units improve the pooling ability and that mixout models can achieve better feature learning and classification performance."
https://openalex.org/W2738071270,"Chlordecone (Kepone) (CLD) is a highly persistent pesticide which was extensively used in the French West Indies; high levels of CLD can still currently be found in large agricultural areas. As CLD transfers from soil to animals mainly via involuntary ingestion, the consumption of foodstuffs derived from animals raised in contaminated areas may significantly contribute to exposure of humans to CLD. The present study was designed to test the efficacy of two different activated carbons (ACs) sources in limiting CLD transfer from soil to animal. Three soils (ASs) were prepared according to the OECD guideline 207. One standard soil (SS) lacking AC, and two modified preparations of SS supplemented with 2% coconut-based activated carbon (ORBO), SSO or with 2% lignite-based one (DARCO), SSD. All three soils were spiked with 10 μg of kepone per g of dry matter and aged for three weeks. This study involved 15 goat kids randomly assigned to the 3 experimental groups (n = 5/group), which were fed the experimental matrices at an exposure dose of 10 μg CLD per kg of body weight per day. After 21 d of oral exposure, CLD in adipose tissue and liver were analysed by LC-MS-MS. A significant decrease of 63.7% and 74.7% of CLD concentrations in adipose tissue and liver, respectively, were obtained from animals exposed using SS containing DARCO as compared to those receiving only SS. Decreases in CLD levels of 98.2% (adipose tissue) and 98.7% (liver) were obtained for animals exposed using SS containing ORBO. This study leads us to conclude that (i) the presence of AC in CLD-contaminated soil strongly reduces CLD bioavailability, and (ii) the efficacy depends on the nature and characteristics of the AC used."

This is explained in terms of ""hard"" and ""soft"" fascination of built and natural scenes. Given a lack of direct empirical evidence for this assumption we propose that perceptual saliency of scene content can function as an empirically derived indicator of fascination. Saliency levels were established by measuring speed of scene category detection using a Go/No-Go detection paradigm. Experiment 1 shows that built scenes are more salient than natural scenes. Experiment 2 replicates these findings using greyscale images, ruling out a colour-based response strategy, and additionally shows that built objects in natural scenes affect saliency to a greater extent than the reverse. Experiment 3 demonstrates that the saliency of scene content is directly linked to cognitive restoration using an established restoration paradigm. Overall, these findings demonstrate an important link between the saliency of scene content and related cognitive restoration."

We used Cox proportional hazards regression to examine the relationship between wellbeing (measured using the CASP-12) and incidence of COPD over a follow-up period of 9 years.There was a significant association between wellbeing and COPD risk. In age-adjusted analyses, a standard deviation increase in CASP-12 score was associated with a reduced risk of COPD; hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) for men and women were 0.67 (0.60-0.75) and 0.80 (0.73-0.87) respectively. After additional adjustment for demographic and health behaviour variables, this association remained significant for men but not for women: the fully-adjusted hazard ratios were 0.80 (0.70-0.91) and 0.91 (0.82-1.03) respectively.Greater wellbeing is associated with a reduced risk of COPD, particularly in men.

https://openalex.org/W2737665541,"Coal and gas outbursts are dynamic failures that can involve the ejection of thousands tons of pulverized coal, as well as considerable volumes of gas, into a limited working space within a short period. The two-phase flow of gas and pulverized coal that occurs during an outburst can lead to fatalities and destroy underground equipment. This article examines the interaction mechanism between pulverized coal and gas flow. Based on the role of gas expansion energy in the development stage of outbursts, a numerical simulation method is proposed for investigating the propagation characteristics of the two-phase flow. This simulation method was verified by a shock tube experiment involving pulverized coal and gas flow. The experimental and simulated results both demonstrate that the instantaneous ejection of pulverized coal and gas flow can form outburst shock waves. These are attenuated along the propagation direction, and the volume fraction of pulverized coal in the two-phase flow has significant influence on attenuation of the outburst shock wave. As a whole, pulverized coal flow has a negative impact on gas flow, which makes a great loss of large amounts of initial energy, blocking the propagation of gas flow. According to comparison of numerical results for different roadway types, the attenuation effect of T-type roadways is best. In the propagation of shock wave, reflection and diffraction of shock wave interact through the complex roadway types."

Forty-three of these samples were used for Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex detection by quantitative PCR and other 21 for subtyping the genetically different variants of M. caprae. Furthermore, three Matrix lysis samples were used for Next Generation Sequencing. Our results confirm that Matrix lysis is a fast and precise method for detecting Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex in native tissue samples. However, at the moment it reaches its limits when the samples were analyzed by Next Generation Sequencing and RD4 subtyping."
https://openalex.org/W2739331050,"Individuals learn to classify percepts effectively when the task is initially easy and then gradually increases in difficulty. Some suggest that this is because easy-to-discriminate events help learners focus attention on discrimination-relevant dimensions. Here, we tested whether such attentional-spotlighting accounts are sufficient to explain easy-to-hard effects in auditory perceptual learning. In two experiments, participants were trained to discriminate periodic, frequency-modulated (FM) tones in two separate frequency ranges (300–600 Hz or 3000–6000 Hz). In one frequency range, sounds gradually increased in similarity as training progressed. In the other, stimulus similarity was constant throughout training. After training, participants showed better performance in their progressively trained frequency range, even though the discrimination-relevant dimension across ranges was the same. Learning theories that posit experience-dependent changes in stimulus representations and/or the strengthening of associations with differential responses, predict the observed specificity of easy-to-hard effects, whereas attentional-spotlighting theories do not. Calibrating the difficulty and temporal sequencing of training experiences to support more incremental representation-based learning can enhance the effectiveness of practice beyond any benefits gained from explicitly highlighting relevant dimensions."

This study seeks to provide subsidies for the monitoring of the onchocerciasis transmission in the country. The study was carried out at the Homoxi and Thirei villages, located in the Yanomami Indigenous Land, in the state of Roraima. This area presents hyperendemicity, high blackflies densities, large population migrations and mining activities. The Homoxi and Thirei villages are assisted by the Brazilian Ministry of Health. To conduct the present study, the village leader, health leaders and the Brazilian Ethics Committee were consulted. Blackflies captures were carried out simultaneously at the Homoxi and Thirei, using systematized methods to allow for comparisons between the traditional Human Landing Catch (HLC) and HLC protected by the MosqTent®. The female blackflies were captured at two equidistant capture stations per locality, by two collectors per station, for five consecutive days. Individuals captured by interval/station/day were counted, identified and maintained at -20°C. The underlying probability distributions and the differences between the methods for the independent sample data were verified in a comparative statistical analysis between the use of the MosqTent® and the HLC. A total of 10,855 antropophilic blackflies were captured by both methodologies. A total of 7,367 (67.87%) blackflies belonging to seven species were captured by MosqTent® —Simulium incrustatum s.l (99.06%); S. guianense s.l (0.74%), S. oyapockense s.l (0.01%), S. exiguum (0.10%), S. metallicum (0.05%), S. ochraceum (0.03%) and S. minusculum s.l (0.01%). Moreover, 3,488 (32.14%) blackflies belonging to four species were captured by HLC—S. incrustatum s.l (98.33%); S. guianense s.l (1.38%), S. oyapockense s.l (0.26%) and S. metallicum (0.03%). The MosqTent® was more effective and efficient when compared to HLC. When comparing total blackflies captured/day, the MosqTent® was more efficient than HLC (p = 0.031) with a means of 799.4 blackflies/day versus 217.6 blackflies/day by HLC. The results demonstrated improved performance and high reliability of the MosqTent® compared to the traditional HLC method."
https://openalex.org/W2739181200,"Tissue factor (TF) is expressed in vascular and nonvascular tissues and functions in several pathways, including embryonic development, inflammation, and cell migration. Many risk factors for atherosclerosis, including hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and smoking, increase TF expression. To better understand the TF-related mechanisms in atherosclerosis, here we investigated the role of 12/15-lipoxygenase (12/15-LOX) in TF expression. 15(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15(S)-HETE), the major product of human 15-LOXs 1 and 2, induced TF expression and activity in a time-dependent manner in the human monocytic cell line THP1. Moreover, TF suppression with neutralizing antibodies blocked 15(S)-HETE–induced monocyte migration. We also found that NADPH- and xanthine oxidase–dependent reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CaMKIV) activation, and interactions between nuclear factor of activated T cells 3 (NFATc3) and FosB proto-oncogene, AP-1 transcription factor subunit (FosB) are involved in 15(S)-HETE–induced TF expression. Interestingly, NFATc3 first induced the expression of its interaction partner FosB before forming the heterodimeric NFATc3–FosB transcription factor complex, which bound the proximal AP-1 site in the TF gene promoter and activated TF expression. We also observed that macrophages from 12/15-LOX−/− mice exhibit diminished migratory response to monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1) and lipopolysaccharide compared with WT mouse macrophages. Similarly, compared with WT macrophages, monocytes from 12/15-LOX−/− mice displayed diminished trafficking, which was rescued by prior treatment with 12(S)-HETE, in a peritonitis model. These observations indicate that 15(S)-HETE–induced monocyte/macrophage migration and trafficking require ROS-mediated CaMKIV activation leading to formation of NFATc3 and FosB heterodimer, which binds and activates the TF promoter.

The findings that although lipid molecules such as oxidized low density lipoprotein (oxLDL) and oxidized 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine (oxPAPC) induce TF expression in endothelial cells, monocytes, and macrophages, and high density lipoprotein (HDL) blocks its expression, provide additional lines of evidence for the possible role of TF in atherosclerosis (17.Owens 3rd, A.P.

Since the discovery that human atherosclerotic plaques contain abundant levels of both mRNA and protein levels of 15-lipoxygenase (15-LOX), many studies using pharmacological and genetic approaches have shown a role for this enzyme in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis (21.Ylä-Herttuala S.

Because atherosclerotic plaques produce 15(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15(S)-HETE) as a predominant eicosanoid, a major arachidonic acid metabolite of 15-LOX1/2 (24.Simon T.C. Makheja A.N.

In this study, we report that 15(S)-HETE induces TF expression and its activity in human monocytes and inhibition or depletion of TF levels blocks 15(S)-HETE–induced monocyte migration. In addition, we show that 15(S)-HETE–induced TF expression and its activity require reactive oxygen species (ROS)–dependent calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CaMKIV)–mediated nuclear factor of activated T cells 3 (NFATc3) and FosB interactions and their occupancy of AP-1 site in the TF promoter. Our observations also suggest that the migration of monocytes to inflamed peritoneum is dependent on 12/15 lipoxygenase (12/15-LOX)–mediated TF expression. Thus, these findings provide evidence for the role of TF in 12/15-LOX–induced monocyte migration in vitro and monocyte trafficking in vivo. TF expression increases with the progression of atherosclerotic lesions (10.Celi A. Cianchetti S. Dell'Omo G. Pedrinelli R.

Disruption of the 12/15-lipoxygenase gene diminishes atherosclerosis in apo E-deficient mice.J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1597-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar), we asked the question whether there is any link between 12/15-LOX and TF in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, particularly monocyte/macrophage buildup in the vessel wall. To address this notion, we tested the effect of 15(S)-HETE, a major arachidonic acid metabolite of human 15-LOX1/2, on TF expression in THP1 cells, a human monocytic cell line. 15(S)-HETE not only induced the expression of TF at both mRNA and protein levels, but also increased its activity in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). The specificity experiments have revealed that 15(S)-HETE is the most potent HETE in inducing TF expression as compared with other HETEs (Fig. 1B). To understand the functional significance of TF expression by 15(S)-HETE, we tested its involvement in 15(S)-HETE–induced monocyte migration, as it is a key player in vascular inflammation, atherogenesis, and atherothrombosis. Neutralizing TF antibodies (anti-human TF Ab-D3) (27.Kirchhofer D. Moran P. Chiang N. Kim J. Riederer M.A. Eigenbrot C. Kelley R.F. Epitope location on tissue factor determines the anticoagulant potency of monoclonal anti-tissue factor antibodies.Thromb. Haemost. 2000; 84: 1072-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) besides abolishing 15(S)-HETE–induced Factor Xa generation also suppressed its effects on monocyte migration (Fig. 1C). In addition, depletion of TF levels by its antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) attenuated 15(S)-HETE–induced monocyte migration (Fig. 1C). We have previously demonstrated a role for NADPH oxidase and xanthine oxidase–mediated ROS production in 15(S)-HETE–induced THP1 cell migration (23.Kotla S. Singh N.K. Heckle M.R. Tigyi G.J. Rao G.N. The transcription factor CREB enhances interleukin-17A production and inflammation in a mouse model of atherosclerosis.Sci. Signal. 2013; 6: ra83Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Therefore, to explore the mechanisms underlying 15(S)-HETE–induced TF expression, we have studied the role of NADPH oxidase and xanthine oxidase. Apocynin, diphenyleneiodonium (DPI), and allopurinol, the NADPH oxidase and xanthine oxidase inhibitors, respectively (23.Kotla S. Singh N.K. Heckle M.R. Tigyi G.J. Rao G.N. The transcription factor CREB enhances interleukin-17A production and inflammation in a mouse model of atherosclerosis.Sci. Signal. 2013; 6: ra83Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), suppressed 15(S)-HETE–induced TF expression and its activity (Fig. 2A). To confirm these findings, we used an ASO approach. Depletion of either p47Phox, a component of NADPH oxidase (28.Drummond G.R. Selemidis S. Griendling K.K. Sobey C.G. Combating oxidative stress in vascular disease: NADPH oxidases as therapeutic targets.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2011; 10: 453-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar), or xanthine oxidase substantially attenuated 15(S)-HETE–induced TF expression and its activity (Fig. 2B). Inhibition or depletion of NADPH oxidase or xanthine oxidase by pharmacological and ASO approaches, respectively, also negated the effect of 15(S)-HETE on monocyte migration (Fig. 2, C and D). A large number of studies have shown that ROS play a role in the activation of both serine/threonine and tyrosine kinases in modulating cellular signal transduction (29.Holmström K.M. Finkel T. Cellular mechanisms and physiological consequences of redox-dependent signalling.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2014; 15: 411-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (1290) Google Scholar). In addition, a recent study has shown that ROS mediate activation of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CaMKs) (30.Howe C.J. Lahair M.M. McCubrey J.A. Franklin R.A. Redox regulation of the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44573-44581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Because nothing is known on the role of CaMKs in TF expression and having found that 15(S)-HETE–induced TF expression and activation require ROS production, we wanted to test the effect of 15(S)-HETE on the activation of CaMKs. 15(S)-HETE, while having no major effect on the phosphorylation of CaMKI or CaMKII, induced the serine phosphorylation of CaMKIV in a time-dependent manner with maximum effect at 30 min (Fig. 3A). Based on this observation, we tested the role of CaMKIV in 15(S)-HETE–induced TF expression and monocyte migration. Our results showed that STO609, a potent inhibitor of CaMKIV (31.Tokumitsu H. Inuzuka H. Ishikawa Y. Ikeda M. Saji I. Kobayashi R. STO-609, a specific inhibitor of the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15813-15818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), suppressed 15(S)-HETE–induced TF expression and its activity (Fig. 3B). In line with these observations, STO609 also blocked 15(S)-HETE–induced monocyte migration (Fig. 3B). To confirm these observations we also used an ASO approach. Knockdown of CaMKIV by its ASOs inhibited 15(S)-HETE–induced expression and enzymatic activity of TF, as well as monocyte migration (Fig. 3C). To understand the link between ROS and CaMKIV, we further examined the role of NADPH oxidase and xanthine oxidase in 15(S)-HETE–induced CaMKIV activation. Inhibition or depletion of either NADPH oxidase or xanthine oxidase attenuated the effect of 15(S)-HETE on CaMKIV phosphorylation (Fig. 3D). These results indicate that NADPH oxidase and xanthine oxidase–mediated ROS production is required for CaMKIV activation in TF expression facilitating monocyte migration in response to 15(S)-HETE. Many studies have reported a role for various transcriptional mechanisms in the regulation of TF expression in response to a wide array of stimulants in a variety of cell types (18.Bochkov V.N.

To find out which of these transcriptional mechanisms are involved in 15(S)-HETE–induced TF expression, we cloned ∼2.1 kb human TF promoter and performed TRANSFAC analysis. TRANSFAC analysis showed the presence of four SP1-binding sites, three NFAT-binding sites, one NFκB-binding site, one CREB-binding site, and three AP-1–binding sites (Fig. 4A). Using ∼2.1 kb TF promoter-luciferase construct, we observed a 7-fold increase in the promoter activity in response to 15(S)-HETE as compared with vehicle control (Fig. 4B). This result infers a role for transcriptional mechanisms in 15(S)-HETE–induced TF expression. To identify the regulatory elements involved in 15(S)-HETE–induced TF promoter activity, we performed serial promoter deletion analysis. Promoter deletion analysis revealed the presence of 15(S)-HETE–responsive element(s) between 0.23 kb and 0.19 kb region of the promoter from the transcription start site. Because two AP-1 sites are present in this region and to find whether these sites are involved in 15(S)-HETE–induced TF promoter activity, we performed site-directed mutagenesis. We found that disruption of the proximal but not the distal AP-1 site attenuates 15(S)-HETE–induced TF promoter activity (Fig. 4B). These findings reveal the importance of the proximal AP-1 site in 15(S)-HETE–induced transcriptional regulation of TF expression. To identify the AP-1 components mediating 15(S)-HETE–induced TF promoter activity, we studied the time course effect of 15(S)-HETE on the expression of the Fos and Jun family of proto-oncogenes. 15(S)-HETE, although having little effect on cFos, Fra1, cJun, and JunD levels, induced the expression of FosB, Fra2, and JunB levels (Fig. 4C). Based on these observations we tested the role of these proto-oncogenes in 15(S)-HETE–induced TF promoter activity. Depletion of FosB but not Fra2 or JunB levels using their respective ASOs blocked 15(S)-HETE–induced 0.23 kb TF promoter-luciferase activity (Fig. 4D). In accordance with these findings, depletion of FosB but not JunB or Fra2 attenuated 15(S)-HETE–induced TF expression and its activity as well as monocyte migration (Fig. 4E). In addition, pharmacological inhibition or ASO-mediated depletion of NADPH oxidase, xanthine oxidase, or CaMKIV suppressed FosB expression and 0.23 kb TF promoter-luciferase activity (Fig. 4, F–K). These observations show that NADPH oxidase and xanthine oxidase-mediated ROS production and CaMKIV activation are required for FosB induction in enhancing AP-1–dependent TF expression at transcriptional level. Although Jun proteins can form active AP-1 complex via either homodimerization or heterodimerization involving the Jun or Fos family of proteins, the Fos family members by themselves cannot form functional AP-1 and therefore require partnership with Jun proteins or another family of transcriptional factors (34.Kouzarides T. Ziff E. The role of the leucine zipper in the fos–jun interaction.Nature. 1988; 336: 646-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar, 35.Macián F. López-Rodríguez C. Rao A. Partners in transcription: NFAT and AP-1.Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2476-2489Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). To identify the binding partner(s) for FosB in 15(S)-HETE–induced transcriptional transactivation of TF promoter, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments. As shown in Fig. 5A, FosB was found to exist in complex with cFos, Fra1, cJun, JunB, JunD, ATF2, CREB, NFATc1, NFATc2, NFATc4, p65, PPARγ, and STAT1 constitutively, and 15(S)-HETE had no effect on these interactions. However, FosB association with NFATc3 was found to be increased in a time-dependent manner in response to 15(S)-HETE (Fig. 5A). Therefore, we next sought to study the role of NFATc3 on TF expression and activity. Blockade of NFATs by CsA, a potent inhibitor of calcineurin (35.Macián F. López-Rodríguez C. Rao A. Partners in transcription: NFAT and AP-1.Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2476-2489Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar), suppressed 15(S)-HETE–induced TF promoter activity and its expression (Fig. 5B). Interestingly, blockade of NFATs also decreased 15(S)-HETE–induced FosB expression (Fig. 5B). In line with these results, depletion of NFATc3 levels using its ASOs attenuated 15(S)-HETE–induced FosB and TF expression as well as TF activity (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, depletion of NFATc3 levels reduced 15(S)-HETE–induced TF promoter activity and monocyte migration (Fig. 5, C and D). In addition, we observed that 15(S)-HETE induces the translocation of NFATc3 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in a time-dependent manner and this translocation requires NADPH oxidase, xanthine oxidase, and CaMKIV activation (Fig. 5, E and F). To find whether both FosB and NFATc3 bind to the proximal AP-1 site, we studied the time course effect of 15(S)-HETE on AP-1 DNA–binding activity using proximal AP-1 element as a biotin-labeled probe. 15(S)-HETE induced AP-1 DNA–binding activity in a time-dependent manner with a maximum effect at 2 h (Fig. 6A). In addition, supershift analysis indicated that only FosB and NFATc3 but not Fra2 or JunB bind to this AP-1 site (Fig. 6A). To confirm these observations, we performed ChIP and chromatin re-immunoprecipitation (re-ChIP) assays. ChIP assay showed that FosB and NFATc3 bind to the same region of the TF promoter containing the proximal AP-1 site (Fig. 6B). The re-ChIP analysis of anti-FosB or anti-NFATc3 chromatin immunocomplexes for the presence of NFATc3 and FosB, respectively, further confirmed that NFATc3 and FosB bind to the same region (Fig. 6B). In addition, depletion of NADPH oxidase, xanthine oxidase, or CaMKIV using their ASOs blocked the recruitment of NFATc3 and FosB to the TF promoter in response to 15(S)-HETE (Fig. 6, C and D). Based on all these observations, it may be suggested that NFATc3, by inducing and partnering with FosB, binds to AP-1 site on TF promoter and enhances its activity in a manner that is dependent on NADPH oxidase and xanthine oxidase–mediated ROS production and CaMKIV activation. To explore the functional significance of 15(S)-HETE and TF link in vivo, we isolated peritoneal macrophages from WT and 12/15-LOX−/− mice and subjected them to monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1) and LPS-induced migration. It is interesting to note that both MCP-1 and LPS stimulate the migration of only WT and not 12/15-LOX−/− macrophages (Fig. 7A). To substantiate the role of TF in macrophage migration in vivo, we also measured MCP-1 and LPS-i"

https://openalex.org/W2737019810,"Neisseria gonorrhoeae is the causative organism of gonorrhoea, a sexually transmitted disease that globally accounts for an estimated 80 to 100 million new infections per year. Increasing resistances to all common antibiotics used for N. gonorrhoeae treatment pose the risk of an untreatable disease. Further knowledge of ways of infection and host immune response are needed to understand the pathogen-host interaction and to discover new treatment alternatives against this disease. Therefore, detailed information about immunogenic proteins and their properties like epitope sites could advance further research in this area. In this work, we investigated immunogenic proteins of N. gonorrhoeae for linear epitopes by microarrays. Dominant linear epitopes were identified for eleven of the nineteen investigated proteins with three polyclonal rabbit antibodies from different immunisations. Identified linear epitopes were further examined for non-specific binding with antibodies to Escherichia coli and the closely related pathogen Neisseria meningitidis. On top of that, amino acids crucial for the antibody epitope binding were detected by microarray based alanine scans."
https://openalex.org/W2739368509,"Acid hydrolases utilize a carbohydrate-dependent mechanism for lysosomal targeting. These hydrolases acquire a mannose 6-phosphate tag by the action of the GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase enzyme, allowing them to bind receptors and traffic to endosomes. Loss of GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase results in hydrolase hypersecretion and profound lysosomal storage. Little, however, is known about how these cellular phenotypes affect the trafficking, activity, and localization of surface glycoproteins. To address this question, we profiled the abundance of surface glycoproteins in WT and CRISPR-mediated GNPTAB−/− HeLa cells and identified changes in numerous glycoproteins, including the uptake receptor LRP1 and multiple receptor tyrosine kinases. Decreased cell surface LRP1 in GNPTAB−/− cells corresponded with a reduction in its steady-state level and less amyloid-β-40 (Aβ40) peptide uptake. GNPTAB−/− cells displayed elevated activation of several kinases including Met receptor. We found increased Met phosphorylation within both the kinase and the docking domains and observed that lower concentrations of pervanadate were needed to cause an increase in phospho-Met in GNPTAB−/− cells. Together, these data suggested a decrease in the activity of the receptor and non-receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatases that down-regulate Met phosphorylation. GNPTAB−/− cells exhibited elevated levels of reactive oxygen species, known to inactivate cell surface and cytosolic phosphatases by oxidation of active site cysteine residues. Consistent with this mode of action, peroxide treatment of parental HeLa cells elevated phospho-Met levels whereas antioxidant treatment of GNPTAB−/− cells reduced phospho-Met levels. Collectively, these findings identify new mechanisms whereby impaired lysosomal targeting can impact the activity and recycling of receptors."
