https://openalex.org/W1995549179,"The morphologies and dynamics of aggregates formed by surfactant molecules are known to influence strongly performance properties spanning biology, household cleaning, and soil cleanup. Molecular dynamics simulations were used to investigate the morphology and dynamics of a class of surfactants, the gemini or dimeric surfactants, that are of potential importance in several industrial applications. Simulation results show that these surfactants form structures and have dynamic properties that are drastically different from those of single-chain surfactants. At the same weight fraction, single-chain surfactants form spherical micelles whereas gemini surfactants, whose two head groups are coupled by a short hydrophobic spacer, form thread-like micelles. Simulations at different surfactant concentrations indicate the formation of various structures, suggesting an alternative explanation for the unexpected viscosity behavior of gemini surfactants."
https://openalex.org/W2034544814,Results from a global coupled ocean-atmosphere climate model and a model with specified tropical convective heating anomalies show that the South Asian monsoon was an active part of the tropical biennial oscillation (TBO). Convective heating anomalies over Africa and the western Pacific Ocean associated with the TBO altered the simulated pattern of atmospheric circulation for the Northern Hemisphere winter mid-latitude over Asia. This alteration in the mid-latitude circulation maintained temperature anomalies over South Asia through winter and helped set up the land-sea temperature contrast for subsequent monsoon development. South Asian snow cover contributed to monsoon strength but was symptomatic of the larger scale alteration in the mid-latitude atmospheric circulation pattern.
https://openalex.org/W2023721543,"The trillionfold concentration of sound energy by a trapped gas bubble, so as to emit picosecond flashes of ultraviolet light, is found to be extremely sensitive to doping with a noble gas. Increasing the noble gas content of a nitrogen bubble to about 1% dramatically stabilizes the bubble motion and increases the light emission by over an order of magnitude to a value that exceeds the sonoluminescence of either gas alone. The spectrum also strongly depends on the nature of the gas inside the bubble: Xenon yields a spectral peak at about 300 nanometers, whereas the helium spectrum is so strongly ultraviolet that its peak is obscured by the cutoff of water."
https://openalex.org/W2032905426,"Seismic profiling data indicate that the thickness of an accreted oceanic terrane of Paleocene and early Eocene age, which forms the basement of much of the forearc beneath western Oregon and Washington, varies by approximately a factor of 4 along the strike of the Cascadia subduction zone. Beneath the Oregon Coast Range, the accreted terrane is 25 to 35 kilometers thick, whereas offshore Vancouver Island it is about 6 kilometers thick. These variations are correlated with variations in arc magmatism, forearc seismicity, and long-term forearc deformation. It is suggested that the strength of the forearc crust increases as the thickness of the accreted terrane increases and that the geometry of the seaward edge of this terrane influences deformation within the subduction complex and controls the amount of sediment that is deeply subducted."
https://openalex.org/W2034114512,"A major question in Mesozoic biogeography is how the land-based dinosaurian radiation responded to fragmentation of Pangaea. A rich fossil record has been uncovered on northern continents that spans the Cretaceous, when continental isolation reached its peak. In contrast, dinosaur remains on southern continents are scarce. The discovery of dinosaurian skeletons from Lower Cretaceous beds in the southern Sahara shows that several lineages of tetanuran theropods and broad-toothed sauropods had a cosmopolitan distribution across Pangaea before the onset of continental fragmentation. The distinct dinosaurian faunas of Africa, South America, and Asiamerica arose during the Cretaceous by differential survival of once widespread lineages on land masses that were becoming increasingly isolated from one another."
https://openalex.org/W2081356929,"Coastal zone color scanner (CZCS) imagery of the western Ross Sea revealed the Presence of an intense phytoplankton bloom covering >106,000 square kilometers in early December 1978. This bloom developed inside the Ross Sea polynya, within 2 weeks of initial polynya formation in late November. Primary productivity calculated from December imagery (3.9 grams of carbon per square meter per day) was up to four times the values measured during in situ studies in mid-January to February 1979. Inclusion of this early season production yields a spring-to-summer estimate of 141 to 171 grams of carbon per square meter, three to four times the values previously reported for the western Ross Sea."
https://openalex.org/W2085586282,"The ion-molecule reaction NH(3)(+) + ND(3) has been studied at various collision energies (1 to 5 electron volts in the center of mass) with preparation of the NH(3)(+) reagent in two nearly isoenergetic vibrational states. One state corresponds to pure out-of-plane bending of the planar NH(3)(+) ion (0.60 electron volts), whereas the other state is a combination of in-plane and out-of-plane motion (0.63 electron volts). The product branching ratios differ markedly for these two vibrational-state preparations. The differences in reactivity suggest that the in-plane totally symmetric stretching mode is essentially inactive in controlling the branching ratio of this reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1968989293,"A dynamic theory that connects electronic motions and the nonlinear optical response of conjugated polyenes is developed by introducing the concept of electronic normal modes. A useful picture for the mechanism of optical nonlinearities is obtained by identifying the few dominant modes. This quasi-particle electron-hole representation establishes a close analogy with small semiconductor particles (quantum dots) and is very different from the traditional approach based on electronic eigenstates. The effective conjugation length (coherence size), which controls the scaling and saturation of the static third-order susceptibility Ï‡(3) with the number of double bonds, is related to the coherence of the relative motion of electron-hole pairs created upon optical excitation."

https://openalex.org/W1976376102,A method was employed whereby it was possible to determine the growth pattern of hydra without using the traditional techniques of grafting and vital staining. It has been shown that hydra possess a growth region just below the hypostome where constant cell proliferation renews the tissues of the animal completely every few weeks.

https://openalex.org/W1980411142,Millington's description of pore structure in porous media is compared with conclusions based on the network theory. Experimental gas-diffusion data for moist sand indicate that this porous material has a network structure in which each pore is connected to about 15 other pores.
