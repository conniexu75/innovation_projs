https://openalex.org/W1975141727,"Remodeling Gone Awry The identification of genes that are mutated at high frequency in human tumors can provide important clues to the molecular pathways that drive tumor growth, which in turn can potentially lead to more effective therapies. Jones et al. (p. 228 , published online 9 September; see the cover) looked for such mutations in ovarian clear cell carcinoma, a rare but particularly lethal form of ovarian cancer. Of 42 tumors examined, 57% were found to harbor inactivating mutations in ARID1A , a gene coding for a subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, which functions as a master regulator of transcription factor action and gene expression. Thus, proteins associated with the epigenetic control of gene expression can contribute to the development of human cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2086871516,"Different subtypes of GABAergic neurons in sensory cortex exhibit diverse morphology, histochemical markers, and patterns of connectivity. These subtypes likely play distinct roles in cortical function, but their in vivo response properties remain unclear. We used in vivo calcium imaging, combined with immunohistochemical and genetic labels, to record visual responses in excitatory neurons and up to three distinct subtypes of GABAergic neurons (immunoreactive for parvalbumin, somatostatin, or vasoactive intestinal peptide) in layer 2/3 of mouse visual cortex. Excitatory neurons had sharp response selectivity for stimulus orientation and spatial frequency, while all GABAergic subtypes had broader selectivity. Further, bias in the responses of GABAergic neurons toward particular orientations or spatial frequencies tended to reflect net biases of the surrounding neurons. These results suggest that the sensory responses of layer 2/3 GABAergic neurons reflect the pooled activity of the surrounding population--a principle that may generalize across species and sensory modalities."
https://openalex.org/W1987485108,"Neuronal oscillations in the gamma band (30-80 Hz) have been suggested to play a central role in feature binding or establishing channels for neural communication. For these functions, the gamma rhythm frequency must be consistent across neural assemblies encoding the features of a stimulus. Here we test the dependence of gamma frequency on stimulus contrast in V1 cortex of awake behaving macaques and show that gamma frequency increases monotonically with contrast. Changes in stimulus contrast over time leads to a reliable gamma frequency modulation on a fast timescale. Further, large stimuli whose contrast varies across space generate gamma rhythms at significantly different frequencies in simultaneously recorded neuronal assemblies separated by as little as 400 microm, making the gamma rhythm a poor candidate for binding or communication, at least in V1. Instead, our results suggest that the gamma rhythm arises from local interactions between excitation and inhibition."

Herein’ we describe a new approach to test the heteromerization of 2 receptors’ or 2 receptor subunits’ and to study the stoichiometry of the resulting complexes. As a proof-of-concept study’ we investigated whether metabo-tropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs)’ in addition to being well-known homodimers’ can form heteromers. To that aim’ we combine the benefits of time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (trFRET) with the specific’ cell-surface labeling of SNAP- and CLIP-tagged rat mGluR subunits’ expressed in a mammalian cell line. First’ we show that mGlu2 and mGlu4 subunits (but not mGlu2 and mGlu1) can heteromerize. Moreover’ our trFRET data are consistent with mGluR subunits forming strict homodimeric receptors on single expression’ and a combination of strict het-erodimeric and strict homodimeric receptors on coex-pression. Second’ a comprehensive analysis reveals that from the 21 possible pairs of 2 mGluR subunits out of 7 subtypes (mGlul to 8’ but not 6)’ only 11 are able to form heterodimers. These findings were further validated by biochemical and functional complementation studies. In addition to describing a new method to analyze cell-surface receptor complexes’ our data reveal a new level of complexity within the mGluR family.—Doumazane’ E.’ Scholle, P., Zwier, J.

https://openalex.org/W2084487847,"TGF-β promotes cell migration and invasion, an attribute that is linked to the pro-metastasis function of this cytokine in late stage cancers. The LIM 1863 colon carcinoma organoid undergoes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in response to TGF-β. This process is markedly accelerated by TNF-α, and we found that the levels of miR-21 and miR-31 were prominently elevated under the synergistic actions of TGF-β/TNF-α. Consistent with this, overexpression of either miR-21 or miR-31 significantly enhanced the effect of TGF-β alone on LIM 1863 morphological changes. More importantly, transwell assays demonstrated the positive effects of both miR-21 and miR-31 in TGF-β regulation of LIM 1863 motility and invasiveness. Elevated levels of miR-21 and miR-31 also enhanced motility and invasiveness of other colon carcinoma cell lines. We present compelling evidence that TIAM1, a guanidine exchange factor of the Rac GTPase, is a direct target of both miR-21 and miR-31. Indeed in LIM 1863 cells, suppression of TIAM1 is required for miR-21/miR-31 to enhance cell migration and invasion. Therefore, we have uncovered miR-21 and miR-31 as downstream effectors of TGF-β in facilitating invasion and metastasis of colon carcinoma cells."
https://openalex.org/W2055864551,"Cachectic muscle wasting is a frequent complication of many inflammatory conditions, due primarily to excessive muscle catabolism. However, the pathogenesis and intervention strategies against it remain to be established. Here, we tested the hypothesis that Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is a master regulator of inflammatory muscle catabolism. We demonstrate that TLR4 activation by lipopolysac-charide (LPS) induces C2C12 myotube atrophy via up-regulating autophagosome formation and the expression of ubiquitin ligase atrogin-1/MAFbx and MuRF1. TLR4-mediated activation of p38 MAPK is necessary and sufficient for the up-regulation of atrogin1/MAFbx and autophagosomes, resulting in myotube atrophy. Similarly, LPS up-regulates muscle autophagosome formation and ubiquitin ligase expression in mice. Importantly, autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine completely abolishes LPS-induced muscle proteolysis, while proteasome inhibitor lacta-cystin partially blocks it. Furthermore, TLR4 knockout or p38 MAPK inhibition abolishes LPS-induced muscle proteolysis. Thus, TLR4 mediates LPS-induced muscle catabolism via coordinate activation of the ubiq-uitin-proteasome and the autophagy-lysosomal pathways.—Doyle, A., Zhang, G., Abdel Fattah, E. A., Eissa, N.

https://openalex.org/W2085669080,"The encoding of odors by spatiotemporal patterns of mitral/tufted (M/T) cells in the vertebrate olfactory bulb has been discussed controversially. Motivated by temporal constraints from behavioral studies, we investigated the information contained in odor-evoked first-spike latencies. Using simultaneous recordings of dozens of M/T cells with a high temporal resolution and quantitative ensemble correlation techniques, we show that latency patterns, and in particular latency rank patterns, are highly odor specific and reproducible. They reliably predict the odor identity as well as the odor concentration on a single-trial basis and on short timescales-in fact, more reliably than patterns of firing rates. Furthermore, we show that latency ranks exhibit a better reproducibility at the level of M/T cells than in olfactory receptor neurons. Our results suggest that the latency patterns of M/T cells contain all the information higher brain centers need to identify odors and their concentrations."
https://openalex.org/W2040326475,"Transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is a promising therapy for ischemic injury; however, inadequate survival of implanted cells in host tissue is a substantial impediment in the progress of cellular therapy. Secreted Frizzled-related protein 2 (sFRP2) has recently been highlighted as a key mediator of MSC-driven myocardial and wound repair. Notably, sFRP2 mediates significant enhancement of MSC engraftment in vivo. We hypothesized that sFRP2 improves MSC engraftment by modulating self-renewal through increasing stem cell survival and by inhibiting differentiation. In previous studies we demonstrated that sFRP2-expressing MSCs exhibited an increased proliferation rate. In the current study, we show that sFRP2 also decreased MSC apoptosis and inhibited both osteogenic and chondrogenic lineage commitment. sFRP2 activity occurred through the inhibition of both Wnt and bone morphogenic protein (BMP) signaling pathways. sFRP2-mediated inhibition of BMP signaling, as assessed by levels of pSMAD 1/5/8, was independent of its effects on the Wnt pathway. We further hypothesized that sFRP2 inhibition of MSC lineage commitment may reduce heterotopic osteogenic differentiation within the injured myocardium, a reported adverse side effect.

IntroductionBone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) 2The abbreviations used are: MSCmesenchymal stem cellsFRP2secreted Frizzled-related protein 2BMPbone morphogenic proteinHSChematopoietic stem cellCRDcysteine-rich domain. are an attractive candidate for cell-mediated wound repair. Because of their plasticity, MSCs have been utilized in several preclinical and clinical trials of tissue regeneration (1Jorgensen C. Gordeladze J. Noel D. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2004; 15: 406-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 2Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar). 3U.S. National Library of Medicine, U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, Clinicaltrials.gov, Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communications. MSCs have been able to repair infarcted myocardium, bone, and soft tissue, albeit with varying degrees of success (3Orlic D. Kajstura J. Chimenti S. Jakoniuk I. Anderson S.M. Li B. Pickel J. McKay R. Nadal-Ginard B. Bodine D.M. Leri A. Anversa P. Nature. 2001; 410: 701-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (4670) Google Scholar). These promising results are inconsistent, partly due to the low levels of engraftment of MSCs within the injured tissues (4Iso Y. Spees J.L. Serrano C. Bakondi B. Pochampally R. Song Y.H. Sobel B.E. Delafontaine P. Prockop D.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 354: 700-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Hence, strategies to increase survival and engraftment within the wound may enhance MSC therapy.Self-renewal is an intrinsic property of stem cells that allows them to give rise to non-differentiated daughter cells by proliferating, preventing apoptosis, and avoid lineage commitment (5Satija N.K. Gurudutta G.U. Sharma S. Afrin F. Gupta P. Verma Y.K. Singh V.K. Tripathi R.P. Stem Cells Dev. 2007; 16: 7-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 6Schofield R. Biomed. Pharmacother. 1983; 37: 375-380PubMed Google Scholar). This process is important for the maintenance of a stem cell pool that, in the case of MSCs, can exert a more robust effect within the context of a wound. Although several cytokines, growth factors, adhesion molecules, and extracellular matrix components have been identified as cues that signal MSCs to differentiate, the molecular signals that modulate MSC self-renewal remain unknown (5Satija N.K. Gurudutta G.U. Sharma S. Afrin F. Gupta P. Verma Y.K. Singh V.K. Tripathi R.P. Stem Cells Dev. 2007; 16: 7-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Data from the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) field have documented the involvement of Wnt, Notch, and BMP signaling cascades in self-renewal; these pathways are implicated in the expansion of undifferentiated HSCs that upon transplantation into lethally irradiated mice successfully reconstitute the cleared bone marrow (7Reya T. Clevers H. Nature. 2005; 434: 843-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (2986) Google Scholar, 8McReynolds L.J. Gupta S. Figueroa M.E. Mullins M.C. Evans T.

Although no data are available to demonstrate the role of these pathways in MSC self-renewal, the Wnt and BMP cascades are involved in MSC lineage commitment. Canonical Wnt signaling directs osteogenic differentiation of MSCs by stimulating the expression of osteocalcin (10Gaur T. Rich L. Lengner C.J. Hussain S. Trevant B. Ayers D. Stein J.L. Bodine P.V. Komm B.S. Stein G.S. Lian J.B. J. Cell Physiol. 2006; 208: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), this pathway is also involved in early chondrogenesis (11Goldring M.B. Tsuchimochi K. Ijiri K. J. Cell Biochem. 2006; 97: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). The BMP pathway also modulates osteogenic differentiation of MSCs by controlling osteocalcin (12Manton K.J. Leong D.F. Cool S.M. Nurcombe V. Stem Cells. 2007; 25: 2845-2854Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and BMP2 induces chondrocyte fate determination (13Denker A.E. Haas A.R. Nicoll S.B. Tuan R.S. Differentiation. 1999; 64: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The Wnt cascade is involved in other cellular processes besides differentiation; canonical Wnt signaling inhibition, through the activity of Dkk-1, increases human MSC proliferation without overt differentiation (14Gregory K.E. Ono R.N. Charbonneau N.L. Kuo C.L. Keene D.R. Bächinger H.P. Sakai L.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27970-27980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which MSCs modulate these signaling events during growth and/or lineage commitment remain unknown. The data herein, describe the ability of sFRP2 to promote MSC self-renewal by inhibition of both the Wnt and BMP pathways.Secreted frizzled-related protein-2 (sFRP2) has recently been implicated by our group and others as a mediator of MSC-driven myocardial and wound repair; however, the mechanisms are unclear. sFRP2-mediated regeneration can be attributed, at least in part, to its paracrine role in mediating myocardial survival by inhibiting apoptosis (15Mirotsou M. Zhang Z. Deb A. Zhang L. Gnecchi M. Noiseux N. Mu H. Pachori A. Dzau V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 1643-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). However, there are compelling data that sFRP2 has direct effects on MSCs themselves. Overexpression of sFRP2 by MSCs results in increased MSC proliferation and long-term engraftment in vivo (16Alfaro M.P. Pagni M. Vincent A. Atkinson J. Hill M.F. Cates J. Davidson J.M. Rottman J. Lee E. Young P.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 18366-18371Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar).The members of the secreted frizzled-related protein (sFRPs) family contain a region with high homology to the cysteine-rich domain (CRD) of the Wnt-pathway frizzled receptors (17Rattner A. Hsieh J.C. Smallwood P.M. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Nathans J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 2859-2863Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). sFRPs bind Wnt glycoproteins through the CRD, preventing them from reaching their cognate receptors (18Finch P.W. He X. Kelley M.J. Uren A. Schaudies R.P. Popescu N.C. Rudikoff S. Aaronson S.A. Varmus H.E. Rubin J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 6770-6775Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). The five mammalian members, sFRP1–5, have been associated with several developmental and disease processes (19Ezan J. Leroux L. Barandon L. Dufourcq P. Jaspard B. Moreau C. Allières C. Daret D.

Uren A. Schaudies R.P. Popescu N.C. Rudikoff S. Aaronson S.A. Varmus H.E. Rubin J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 6770-6775Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar).Here, we demonstrate that sFRP2 plays dual and important roles in increasing MSC self-renewal by inhibiting both the Wnt and BMP pathways. We show that sFRP2 confers apoptotic resistance to MSCs in parallel to Wnt pathway inhibition. sFRP2 affects the rate of MSC multilineage differentiation; processes directed by Wnt and BMP signaling. This article is the first to demonstrate that sFRP2 directly inhibits BMP signaling in MSCs. The data contained within describe the mechanisms by which sFRP2 enhances MSC self-renewal to promote MSC-mediated wound healing.DISCUSSIONMSCs are utilized in a variety of preclinical models to ameliorate wound healing. Enhanced cardiac tissue repair mediated by MSCs, in concert with clinical studies suggesting that their clinical use is feasible and safe, have spurred a number of clinical trials using bone marrow-derived MSCs as regenerative cell therapy. At least 14 trials are currently ongoing using MSCs to treat myocardial disease (clinicaltrials.gov).3 However, our understanding on how MSCs mediate cardiac and soft tissue repair, including aspects that regulate MSC self renewal, remains incomplete.sFRP2 has been identified as a factor mediating myocardial repair and wound granulation tissue formation by MSCs (15Mirotsou M. Zhang Z. Deb A. Zhang L. Gnecchi M. Noiseux N. Mu H. Pachori A. Dzau V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 1643-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 16Alfaro M.P. Pagni M. Vincent A. Atkinson J. Hill M.F. Cates J. Davidson J.M. Rottman J. Lee E. Young P.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 18366-18371Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Although sFRP2 has been postulated to function as a paracrine modulator of cardiomyocyte apoptosis (30Zhang Z. Deb A. Zhang Z. Pachori A. He W. Guo J. Pratt R. Dzau V.J. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2009; 46: 370-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), we have provided compelling data that sFRP2 is an important autocrine factor for MSCs themselves. sFRP2 overexpression directly up-regulated MSC proliferation in vitro and enhanced their long-term engraftment in mouse models of myocardial injury and wound granulation tissue. In these studies we sought to better clarify how sFRP2 was coordinating repair by MSCs at the cellular level. Our studies showed that sFRP2 is an important modulator of MSC self-renewal. In addition to its published role to enhance proliferation (16Alfaro M.P. Pagni M. Vincent A. Atkinson J. Hill M.F. Cates J. Davidson J.M. Rottman J. Lee E. Young P.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 18366-18371Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), we report that it also inhibits both MSC apoptosis and their differentiation along osteogenic and chondrogenic lineages.Our previous study showed that sFRP2 resulted in a dose-dependent increase in human and murine MSC proliferation in vitro. Conversely, addition of recombinant Wnt3a (or its overexpression in MSCs) resulted in a decreased proliferation rate. Dkk1, an inhibitor of canonical Wnt signaling, has been demonstrated to increase human MSC proliferation and entry into the cell cycle in vitro (14Gregory K.E. Ono R.N. Charbonneau N.L. Kuo C.L. Keene D.R. Bächinger H.P. Sakai L.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27970-27980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Taken together with our findings that sFRP2 was able to decrease functional canonical Wnt signaling in MSCs (16Alfaro M.P. Pagni M. Vincent A. Atkinson J. Hill M.F. Cates J. Davidson J.M. Rottman J. Lee E. Young P.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 18366-18371Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), these data suggested that sFRP2 increased proliferation through inhibition of canonical Wnt signaling.The sFRP family has also been termed the secreted apoptosis-related proteins, or SARPs, and as their name suggests has been documented to play important roles in the cytoprotection of distinct cells (31Melkonyan H.S. Chang W.C. Shapiro J.P. Mahadevappa M. Fitzpatrick P.A. Kiefer M.C. Tomei L.D. Umansky S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 13636-13641Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Herein we demonstrated that sFRP2 served to protect MSCs from apoptosis under basal and hypoxic conditions. This pro-survival effect was likely to be mediated by sFRP2 inhibition of canonical Wnt signaling as sFRP2 decreased both β-catenin and cleaved caspase 3 levels. The anti-apoptotic action of sFRP2 in MSCs closely mirrors its recently reported paracrine anti-apoptotic effects on cardiomyocytes through direct binding of Wnt3a and inhibition of Wnt3a-induced activation of caspase activities (30Zhang Z. Deb A. Zhang Z. Pachori A. He W. Guo J. Pratt R. Dzau V.J. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2009; 46: 370-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar).MSCs are capable of differentiating into multiple connective tissue lineages, in particular bone, cartilage and fat. Differentiation of MSCs along these lineages occurs at very low levels spontaneously but is accelerated by specific differentiation-inducing culture conditions. By testing for biochemical and genetic markers characteristic of adipose, cartilage, and osteogenic lineages, we showed that sFRP2 inhibited differentiation of MSCs along both cartilage and osteogenic lineages in vitro. We further demonstrated a sFRP2-dependent decrease in transcript levels of Runx2, a transcription factor necessary for osteogenic commitment. Wnt and BMP pathways regulate Runx2 transcript levels, and BMP is a known critical regulator of both osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation of MSCs, we evaluated the effect of sFRP2 on the BMP pathway. Our data provided evidence that sFRP2 inhibited BMP signaling: sFRP2 inhibited nuclear levels of BMP effectors, pSMAD1/5/8, as well as BMP signaling-dependent Id-1 driven reporter gene. Inhibition of pSMAD1/5/8 occurred within 30 min, independently of protein synthesis, and was not affected by the addition of the Wnt inhibitor, pyrvinium. These data suggested that sFRP2 inhibition of BMP signaling did not result from cross-talk between the Wnt/BMP pathways and occurred independently of its effect on Wnt inhibition. Moreover, BMP signaling inhibition occurred both with the addition of recombinant sFRP2 as well as in cells overexpressing sFRP2, suggesting that sFRP2 inhibited BMP in a non-self-autonomous manner.The mechanism by which sFRP2 directly inhibits BMP signaling in mammalian cells is not known and, until this report, only clues as to its involvement in BMP signaling were available. For example, the non-mammalian homologue of sFRPs, Sizzled (Szl), establishes dorsal-ventral patterning in the Drosophila melanogaster, Xenopus, and zebrafish by regulating gradients of BMPs in the developing embryos (27Collavin L. Kirschner M.W. Development. 2003; 130: 805-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The vertebrate dorsal center secretes BMP antagonists, among which chordin is known to sequester BMP ligands to prevent receptor binding (32Sasai Y. Lu B. Steinbeisser H. Geissert D. Gont L.K. De Robertis E.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 779-790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar). Szl inhibits BMP signaling by inhibiting the activity of Xolloid-related (Xlr), the metalloproteinase that degrades chordin. In this developmental process the effect of Szl on Xlr allows sequestration of BMPs by chordin (33De Robertis E.M. Kuroda H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 20: 285-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar) and ultimately BMP pathway inhibition. In a cell-free in vitro system, mouse sFRP2 interacted with Xenopus Xlr to prevent the degradation of Xenopus chordin (34Lee H.X. Ambrosio A.L. Reversade B. De Robertis E.M. Cell. 2006; 124: 147-159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Another recent report suggests sFRP2 may play a role in BMP inhibition in the developing embryo; unilateral electroporation of murine BMP and sFRP2 into the chick neural tube blocked the induction of BMP downstream targets (35Misra K. Matise M.P. Dev. Biol. 2010; 337: 74-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 36Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar, 37Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar). This study did not address whether the observed BMP inhibition was an indirect or a direct effect of sFRP2.In this report, we show direct, Wnt-independent inhibition of BMP signaling molecules, accomplished not only by overexpression of sFRP2 by MSCs, but by the addition of recombinant mouse sFRP2 to the extracellular space. This biochemical inhibition led to functional inhibition of BMP signaling observed by a decrease in both chondrogenic and osteogenic lineage commitment of MSCs. Compiling our data with the information available about sFRP2 and its non-mammalian homologues, we speculate that the effects of sFRP2 as a BMP inhibitor are carried out in the extracellular space. Our results support the following model (Fig. 6): Increased expression of sFRP2 in MSCs inhibits both canonical Wnt and BMP signaling. The resulting cellular effects of sFRP2 on proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation impact MSC self-renewal and ultimately engraftment within the wound.Recent reports have highlighted the potential complication of spontaneous in situ osteogenic differentiation of MSCs following cardiac cell therapy. We assessed heterotopic calcification in two, independent in vivo models following MSC cell therapy. Our data showed that in the setting of myocardial infarction and within experimental granulation tissue generated in PVA sponges, sFRP2-expressing MSCs demonstrated significantly fewer foci of ectopic calcification than GFP-MSCs. These data suggest that sFRP2-mediated inhibition of differentiation may reduce the risk of heterotopic cartilage and/or bone tissues observed with MSC therapy.Despite direct injection of large numbers of cells into tissues, preclinical studies show poor engraftment with only small numbers or no MSCs remaining after 30 days. Hence, a better understanding of the molecular players, such as sFRP2, that favorably modulate MSC self-propagation, engraftment, and differentiation may alter the overall efficacy of MSC cardiac and wound therapy.

Because of their plasticity, MSCs have been utilized in several preclinical and clinical trials of tissue regeneration (1Jorgensen C. Gordeladze J. Noel D. Curr. Opin.

This process is important for the maintenance of a stem cell pool that, in the case of MSCs, can exert a more robust effect within the context of a wound. Although several cytokines, growth factors, adhesion molecules, and extracellular matrix components have been identified as cues that signal MSCs to differentiate, the molecular signals that modulate MSC self-renewal remain unknown (5Satija N.K.

Data from the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) field have documented the involvement of Wnt, Notch, and BMP signaling cascades in self-renewal; these pathways are implicated in the expansion of undifferentiated HSCs that upon transplantation into lethally irradiated mice successfully reconstitute the cleared bone marrow (7Reya T. Clevers H. Nature. 2005; 434: 843-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (2986) Google Scholar, 8McReynolds L.J. Gupta S. Figueroa M.E. Mullins M.C. Evans T.

Although no data are available to demonstrate the role of these pathways in MSC self-renewal, the Wnt and BMP cascades are involved in MSC lineage commitment. Canonical Wnt signaling directs osteogenic differentiation of MSCs by stimulating the expression of osteocalcin (10Gaur T. Rich L. Lengner C.J. Hussain S. Trevant B. Ayers D. Stein J.L. Bodine P.V. Komm B.S. Stein G.S. Lian J.B. J. Cell Physiol. 2006; 208: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), this pathway is also involved in early chondrogenesis (11Goldring M.B. Tsuchimochi K. Ijiri K. J. Cell Biochem. 2006; 97: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). The BMP pathway also modulates osteogenic differentiation of MSCs by controlling osteocalcin (12Manton K.J. Leong D.F. Cool S.M. Nurcombe V. Stem Cells. 2007; 25: 2845-2854Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and BMP2 induces chondrocyte fate determination (13Denker A.E. Haas A.R. Nicoll S.B. Tuan R.S. Differentiation. 1999; 64: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The Wnt cascade is involved in other cellular processes besides differentiation; canonical Wnt signaling inhibition, through the activity of Dkk-1, increases human MSC proliferation without overt differentiation (14Gregory K.E. Ono R.N. Charbonneau N.L. Kuo C.L. Keene D.R. Bächinger H.P. Sakai L.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27970-27980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which MSCs modulate these signaling events during growth and/or lineage commitment remain unknown. The data herein, describe the ability of sFRP2 to promote MSC self-renewal by inhibition of both the Wnt and BMP pathways.Secreted frizzled-related protein-2 (sFRP2) has recently been implicated by our group and others as a mediator of MSC-driven myocardial and wound repair; however, the mechanisms are unclear. sFRP2-mediated regeneration can be attributed, at least in part, to its paracrine role in mediating myocardial survival by inhibiting apoptosis (15Mirotsou M. Zhang Z. Deb A. Zhang L. Gnecchi M. Noiseux N. Mu H. Pachori A. Dzau V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 1643-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). However, there are compelling data that sFRP2 has direct effects on MSCs themselves. Overexpression of sFRP2 by MSCs results in increased MSC proliferation and long-term engraftment in vivo (16Alfaro M.P. Pagni M. Vincent A. Atkinson J. Hill M.F. Cates J. Davidson J.M. Rottman J. Lee E. Young P.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 18366-18371Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar).The members of the secreted frizzled-related protein (sFRPs) family contain a region with high homology to the cysteine-rich domain (CRD) of the Wnt-pathway frizzled receptors (17Rattner A. Hsieh J.C. Smallwood P.M. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Nathans J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 2859-2863Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). sFRPs bind Wnt glycoproteins through the CRD, preventing them from reaching their cognate receptors (18Finch P.W. He X. Kelley M.J. Uren A. Schaudies R.P. Popescu N.C. Rudikoff S. Aaronson S.A. Varmus H.E. Rubin J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 6770-6775Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). The five mammalian members, sFRP1–5, have been associated with several developmental and disease processes (19Ezan J. Leroux L. Barandon L. Dufourcq P. Jaspard B. Moreau C. Allières C. Daret D.

We show that sFRP2 confers apoptotic resistance to MSCs in parallel to Wnt pathway inhibition. sFRP2 affects the rate of MSC multilineage differentiation; processes directed by Wnt and BMP signaling. This article is the first to demonstrate that sFRP2 directly inhibits BMP signaling in MSCs. The data contained within describe the mechanisms by which sFRP2 enhances MSC self-renewal to promote MSC-mediated wound healing."
https://openalex.org/W2129852552,"Three-dimensional structures of NagZ of Bacillus subtilis, the first structures of a two-domain β-N-acetylglucosaminidase of family 3 of glycosidases, were determined with and without the transition state mimicking inhibitor PUGNAc bound to the active site, at 1.84- and 1.40-Å resolution, respectively. The structures together with kinetic analyses of mutants revealed an Asp-His dyad involved in catalysis: His(234) of BsNagZ acts as general acid/base catalyst and is hydrogen bonded by Asp(232) for proper function. Replacement of both His(234) and Asp(232) with glycine reduced the rate of hydrolysis of the fluorogenic substrate 4'-methylumbelliferyl N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminide 1900- and 4500-fold, respectively, and rendered activity pH-independent in the alkaline range consistent with a role of these residues in acid/base catalysis. N-Acetylglucosaminyl enzyme intermediate accumulated in the H234G mutant and β-azide product was formed in the presence of sodium azide in both mutants. The Asp-His dyad is conserved within β-N-acetylglucosaminidases but otherwise absent in β-glycosidases of family 3, which instead carry a ""classical"" glutamate acid/base catalyst. The acid/base glutamate of Hordeum vulgare exoglucanase (Exo1) superimposes with His(234) of the dyad of BsNagZ and, in contrast to the latter, protrudes from a second domain of the enzyme into the active site. This is the first report of an Asp-His catalytic dyad involved in hydrolysis of glycosides resembling in function the Asp-His-Ser triad of serine proteases. Our findings will facilitate the development of mechanism-based inhibitors that selectively target family 3 β-N-acetylglucosaminidases, which are involved in bacterial cell wall turnover, spore germination, and induction of β-lactamase."
https://openalex.org/W2112171859,"The emerging concept of generating cancer stem cells from epithelial-mesenchymal transition has attracted great interest; however, the factors and molecular mechanisms that govern this putative tumor-initiating process remain largely elusive. We report here that miR-200a not only regulates epithelial-mesenchymal transition but also stem-like transition in nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells. We first showed that stable knockdown of miR-200a promotes the transition of epithelium-like CNE-1 cells to the mesenchymal phenotype. More importantly, it also induced several stem cell-like traits, including CD133(+) side population, sphere formation capacity, in vivo tumorigenicity in nude mice, and stem cell marker expression. Consistently, stable overexpression of miR-200a switched mesenchyme-like C666-1 cells to the epithelial state, accompanied by a significant reduction of stem-like cell features. Furthermore, in vitro differentiation of the C666-1 tumor sphere resulted in diminished stem-like cell population and miR-200a induction. To investigate the molecular mechanism, we demonstrated that miR-200a controls epithelial-mesenchymal transition by targeting ZEB2, although it regulates the stem-like transition differentially and specifically by β-catenin signaling. Our findings reveal for the first time the function of miR-200a in shifting nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell states via a reversible process coined as epithelial-mesenchymal to stem-like transition through differential and specific mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2007609428,"Natural dietary agents have drawn a great deal of attention toward cancer prevention because of their wide safety margin. However, single agent intervention has failed to bring the expected outcome in clinical trials; therefore, combinations of chemopreventive agents are gaining increasingly popularity. In the present study, we investigated a combinatorial approach using two natural dietary polyphenols, luteolin and EGCG, and found that their combination at low doses (at which single agents induce minimal apoptosis) synergistically increased apoptosis (3-5-fold more than the additive level of apoptosis) in both head and neck and lung cancer cell lines. This combination also significantly inhibited growth of xenografted tumors in nude mice. The in vivo findings also were supported by significant inhibition of Ki-67 expression and increase in TUNEL-positive cells in xenografted tissues. Mechanistic studies revealed that the combination induced mitochondria-dependent apoptosis in some cell lines and mitochondria-independent apoptosis in others. Moreover, we found more efficient stabilization and ATM-dependent Ser(15) phosphorylation of p53 due to DNA damage by the combination, and ablation of p53 using shRNA strongly inhibited apoptosis as evidenced by decreased poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and caspase-3 cleavage. In addition, we observed mitochondrial translocation of p53 after treatment with luteolin or the combination of EGCG and luteolin. Taken together, our results for the first time suggest that the combination of luteolin and EGCG has synergistic/additive growth inhibitory effects and provides an important rationale for future chemoprevention trials of head and neck and lung cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2052753918,"Angiogenesis contributes to various pathological conditions. Due to the resistance against existing antiangiogenic therapy, an urgent need exists to understand the molecular basis of vessel growth and to identify new targets for antiangiogenic therapy. Here we show that cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5), an important modulator of neuronal processes, regulates endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis, suggesting Cdk5 as a novel target for antiangiogenic therapy. Inhibition or knockdown of Cdk5 reduces endothelial cell motility and blocks angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. We elucidate a specific signaling of Cdk5 in the endothelium; in contrast to neuronal cells, the motile defects upon inhibition of Cdk5 are not caused by an impaired function of focal adhesions or microtubules but by the reduced formation of lamellipodia. Inhibition or down-regulation of Cdk5 decreases the activity of the small GTPase Rac1 and results in a disorganized actin cytoskeleton. Constitutive active Rac1 compensates for the inhibiting effects of Cdk5 knockdown on migration, suggesting that Cdk5 exerts its effects in endothelial cell migration via Rac1. Our work elucidates Cdk5 as a pivotal new regulator of endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis. It suggests Cdk5 as a novel, pharmacologically accessible target for antiangiogenic therapy and provides the basis for a new therapeutic application of Cdk5 inhibitors as antiangiogenic agents."
https://openalex.org/W1991716344,"Complex I pumps protons across the membrane by using downhill redox energy. Here, to investigate the proton pumping mechanism by complex I, we focused on the largest transmembrane subunit NuoL (Escherichia coli ND5 homolog). NuoL/ND5 is believed to have H(+) translocation site(s), because of a high sequence similarity to multi-subunit Na(+)/H(+) antiporters. We mutated thirteen highly conserved residues between NuoL/ND5 and MrpA of Na(+)/H(+) antiporters in the chromosomal nuoL gene. The dNADH oxidase activities in mutant membranes were mostly at the control level or modestly reduced, except mutants of Glu-144, Lys-229, and Lys-399. In contrast, the peripheral dNADH-K(3)Fe(CN)(6) reductase activities basically remained unchanged in all the NuoL mutants, suggesting that the peripheral arm of complex I was not affected by point mutations in NuoL. The proton pumping efficiency (the ratio of H(+)/e(-)), however, was decreased in most NuoL mutants by 30-50%, while the IC(50) values for asimicin (a potent complex I inhibitor) remained unchanged. This suggests that the H(+)/e(-) stoichiometry has changed from 4H(+)/2e(-) to 3H(+) or 2H(+)/2e(-) without affecting the direct coupling site. Furthermore, 50 μm of 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)-amiloride (EIPA), a specific inhibitor for Na(+)/H(+) antiporters, caused a 38 ± 5% decrease in the initial H(+) pump activity in the wild type, while no change was observed in D178N, D303A, and D400A mutants where the H(+) pumping efficiency had already been significantly decreased. The electron transfer activities were basically unaffected by EIPA in both control and mutants. Taken together, our data strongly indicate that the NuoL subunit is involved in the indirect coupling mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2019954654,"Anesthetic agents can induce a paradox activation and sensitization of nociceptive sensory neurons and, thus, potentially facilitate pain processing. Here we identify distinct molecular mechanisms that mediate an activation of sensory neurons by 2,6-diisopropylphenol (propofol), a commonly used intravenous anesthetic known to elicit intense pain upon injection. Clinically relevant concentrations of propofol activated the recombinant transient receptor potential (TRP) receptors TRPA1 and TRPV1 heterologously expressed in HEK293t cells. In dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, propofol-induced activation correlated better to expression of TRPA1 than of TRPV1. However, pretreatment with the protein kinase C activator 4β-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) resulted in a significantly sensitized propofol-induced activation of TRPV1 in DRG neurons as well as in HEK293t cells. Pharmacological and genetic silencing of both TRPA1 and TRPV1 only partially abrogated propofol-induced responses in DRG neurons. The remaining propofol-induced activation was abolished by the selective γ-aminobutyric acid, type A (GABA<sub>A</sub>) receptor antagonist picrotoxin. Propofol but not GABA evokes a release of calcitonin gene-related peptide, a key component of neurogenic inflammation, from isolated peripheral nerves of wild-type but not TRPV1 and TRPA1-deficient mice. Moreover, propofol but not GABA induced an intense pain upon intracutaneous injection. As both the release of calcitonin gene-related peptide and injection pain by propofol seem to be independent of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, our data identify TRPV1 and TRPA1 as key molecules for propofol-induced excitation of sensory neurons. This study warrants further investigations into the role of anesthetics to induce nociceptor sensitization and to foster postoperative pain."

Fbw7 is a bona fide tumor suppressor, and loss-of-function mutations in FBXW7 have been identified in diverse human tumors. Although much is known about targets of the Fbw7 ubiquitin ligase pathway, relatively little is known about the regulation of Fbw7 expression. We identified a panel of candidate microRNA regulators of Fbw7 expression within a study of gene expression alterations in primary erythroblasts obtained from cyclin ET74A T393A knock-in mice, which have markedly dysregulated cyclin E expression. We found that overexpression of miR-223, in particular, significantly reduces FBXW7 mRNA levels, increases endogenous cyclin E protein and activity levels, and increases genomic instability. We next confirmed that miR-223 targets the FBXW7 3′-untranslated region. We then found that reduced miR-223 expression in primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts leads to increased Fbw7 expression and decreased cyclin E activity. Finally, we found that miR-223 expression is responsive to acute alterations in cyclin E regulation by the Fbw7 pathway.

We demonstrate a mechanism by which survivin acetylation at this position results in its homodimerization, while deacetylation promotes the formation of survivin monomers that heterodimerize with CRM1 and facilitate its nuclear export. Using proteomic analysis, we identified the oncogenic transcription factor STAT3 as a binding partner of nuclear survivin. We show that acetylated survivin binds to the N-terminal transcriptional activation domain of the STAT3 dimer and represses STAT3 transactivation of target gene promoters. Using multiplex PCR and DNA sequencing, we identified a single-nucleotide polymorphism (A → G) at Lys-129 that exists as a homozygous mutation in a neuroblastoma cell line and corresponds with a defect in survivin nuclear localization. Our results demonstrate that the dynamic equilibrium between survivin acetylation and deacetylation at amino acid 129 determines its interaction with CRM1, its subsequent subcellular localization, and its ability to inhibit STAT3 transactivation, providing a potential route for therapeutic intervention in STAT3-dependent tumors.

Here, we test whether CBP/p300-interacting transacti-vator with ED-rich tail 2 (CITED2), a mechanosensitive transcriptional coregulator, mediates this chondropro-tective effect of moderate mechanical loading. In vivo, hind-limb immobilization of Sprague-Dawley rats up-regulates MMP-1 and causes rapid, histologically detectable articular cartilage degradation. One hour of daily passive joint motion prevents these changes and up-regulates articular cartilage CITED2. In vitro, moderate (2.5 MPa, 1 Hz) intermittent hydrostatic pressure (IHP) treatment suppresses basal MMP-1 expression and up-regulates CITED2 in human chondro-cytes, whereas high IHP (10 MPa) down-regulates CITED2 and increases MMP-1. Competitive binding and transcription assays demonstrate that CITED2 suppresses MMP-1 expression by competing with MMP transactivator, Ets-1 for its coactivator p300. Furthermore, CITED2 up-regulation in vitro requires the p38δ isoform, which is specifically phosphorylated by moderate IHP.

We showed previously that nuclear localization of the mutant AR was necessary but not sufficient for SBMA. Here we show that an interdomain interaction of the AR that is central to its function within the nucleus is required for AR aggregation and toxicity. Ligands that prevent the interaction between the amino-terminal FXXLF motif and carboxyl-terminal AF-2 domain (N/C interaction) prevented toxicity and AR aggregation in an SBMA cell model and rescued primary SBMA motor neurons from 5α-dihydrotestosterone-induced toxicity. Moreover, genetic mutation of the FXXLF motif prevented AR aggregation and 5α-dihydrotestosterone toxicity. Finally, selective androgen receptor modulators, which prevent the N/C interaction, ameliorated AR aggregation and toxicity while maintaining AR function, highlighting a novel therapeutic strategy to prevent the SBMA phenotype while retaining AR transcriptional function."

Calcium is exported back to the endolymph via the splice variant w/a of the PMCA2 of the stereocilia membrane. To further investigate the role of the pump, we have identified and characterized a novel ENU-induced mouse mutation, Tommy, in the PMCA2 gene. The mutation causes a non-conservative E629K change in the second intracellular loop of the pump that harbors the active site. Tommy mice show profound hearing impairment from P18, with significant differences in hearing thresholds between wild type and heterozygotes. Expression of mutant PMCA2 in CHO cells shows calcium extrusion impairment; specifically, the long term, non-stimulated calcium extrusion activity of the pump is inhibited.

Confocal imaging combined with flash photolysis of caged calcium showed impairment of calcium export in both Tommy heterozygotes and homozygotes. Immunofluorescence studies of the organ of Corti in homozygous Tommy mice showed a progressive base to apex degeneration of hair cells after P40.

The amplification action activates the MET process in inner hair cells and consequent release of neurotransmitter to afferent dendrites of spiral ganglion neurons whose action potentials relay acoustic information to the central nervous system (6Fuchs P.A.

In all types of hair cells, MET channels are gated by tension applied through extracellular tip links, which are oriented along the main symmetry axis of the hair bundle from the apex of one stereocilium to the lateral wall of its taller neighbor (7Pickles J.O. Comis S.D. Osborne M.P. Hear. Res. 1984; 15: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Recent work (8Beurg M. Fettiplace R. Nam J.H. Ricci A.J. Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12: 553-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar) has confirmed that MET channels are located at the lower end of the tip link, in the two shorter rows of stereocilia (9Denk W. Holt J.R. Shepherd G.M. Corey D.P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1311-1321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Earlier experiments performed under non-physiological conditions of Ca2+ concentrations (mm range) showed that ∼90% of the MET current was carried by K+ and 10% by Ca2+ (10Ricci A.J. Fettiplace R. J. Physiol. 1998; 506: 159-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). More recent work has indicated that the fraction of MET current carried by Ca2+ decreases directly in proportion to its external concentration, accounting for only ∼0.2% of the current in a saline comparable with endolymph (11Beurg M. Nam J.H. Chen Q. Fettiplace R. J. Neurophysiol. 2010; 104: 18-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), in which the Ca2+ concentration (∼20 µm) is about 100-fold lower that in all other extracellular fluids (12Bosher S.K. Warren R.L. Nature. 1978; 273: 377-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The entry of Ca2+ has so far been considered vital for adaptation of the mechanotransduction process (1Gillespie P.G. Müller U. Cell. 2009; 139: 33-44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), but these concepts may now have to be revised (11Beurg M. Nam J.H. Chen Q. Fettiplace R. J. Neurophysiol. 2010; 104: 18-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Ca2+ entering through MET channels is rapidly buffered by endogenous mobile chelators, e.g. parvalbumin (13Hackney C.M. Mahendrasingam S. Penn A. Fettiplace R. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 7867-7875Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). However, Ca2+ must be eventually exported back to the endolymph by the PMCA pump, which is highly concentrated in the stereocilia plasma membrane (11Beurg M. Nam J.H. Chen Q. Fettiplace R. J. Neurophysiol. 2010; 104: 18-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 14Crouch J.J. Schulte B.A. Hear. Res. 1995; 92: 112-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 15Kozel P.J. Friedman R.A.

The pump isoform of the stereocilia, PMCA2, which is coded by the ATP2b2 gene, is known to be essential for hearing and balance (15Kozel P.J. Friedman R.A. Erway L.C. Yamoah E.N. Liu L.H. Riddle T.

PMCA2 has properties that set it apart from all other PMCAs (19Brini M. Coletto L. Pierobon N. Kraev N. Guerini D. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24500-24508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar); it has very high affinity for the activator calmodulin, yet its activity is only modestly activated by it (19Brini M. Coletto L. Pierobon N. Kraev N. Guerini D. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24500-24508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 20Hilfiker H. Guerini D. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26178-26183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike the other three PMCA basic isoforms, PMCA2 has peculiarly high activity in the absence of the activator calmodulin, i.e. it pumps Ca2+ out of cells at a relatively high constant rate. All PMCA transcripts undergo alternative splicing at site A in the cytosolic loop connecting transmembrane domains 2 and 3 and at site C in the cytosolic tail of the pump. The splicing process is uniquely complex in PMCA2, as it involves the insertion of up to three exons at site A and of two at site C. The site A inserts are in-frame and generate variant w when all three exons are inserted; those at site C create instead a novel stop codon, truncating the pump prematurely and generating variant a. Recent work has conclusively shown that splicing at site A dictates apical targeting in hair cells for PMCA2 and that the rodent hair-bundle isoform is variant PMCA2w/a; the basolateral plasma membrane of the hair cell contains instead PMCA1 (21Hill J.K.

Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 2995-3007Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Tests of the activity of the various PMCA2s expressed in model cells have revealed a decreased ability of the w/a variant to control incoming Ca2+ pulses in comparison to the non inserted z/b variant (23Ficarella R. Di Leva F. Bortolozzi M. Ortolano S. Donaudy F. Petrillo M. Melchionda S. Lelli A. Domi T. Fedrizzi L. Lim D. Shull G.E. Gasparini P. Brini M. Mammano F. Carafoli E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 1516-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), which, as mentioned, responds with a lower activation to the arrival of Ca2+ pulses with respect to the ubiquitous PMCA1 or PMCA4 pumps (19Brini M.

The stereocilia of vestibular hair cells and OHCs are the only plasma membrane in which the w/a variant of PMCA2 has so far been detected in mammals (21Hill J.K. Williams D.E. LeMasurier M. Dumont R.A. Strehler E.E. Gillespie P.G. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 6172-6180Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The unusually low concentration of Ca2+ in the endolymph that bathes them (12Bosher S.K. Warren R.L. Nature. 1978; 273: 377-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) has evidently led to the evolutionary selection of a PMCA variant with the peculiar Ca2+ exporting properties of PMCA2w/a. It has been known for more than a decade that ablation of the ATP2b2 gene produces hereditary deafness in mice (15Kozel P.J. Friedman R.A. Erway L.C. Yamoah E.N. Liu L.H. Riddle T. Duffy J.J.

PMCA2 mutations were then discovered linked to recessively inherited deafness in mice (17Street V.A. McKee-Johnson J.W. Fonseca R.C. Tempel B.L. Noben-Trauth K. Nat.

Mackenzie F. Brooker D. Fray M. Glenister P. Brown S.D. M The Tommy Mouse Mutant Is a New Allele of dfw That Displays Semi-dominant Age-related Hearing loss. Association for Research in Otolaryngology, Mt. Royal, NJ2003Google Scholar). The mutation affects a highly conserved residue located next to the active site in the cytosolic loop that connects transmembrane domains 4 and 5 of the enzyme. This residue is classified as E584 in the z/b variant of the PMCA2 but corresponds to E629 in the PMCA2w/a variant due to the 45-amino acid site A insertion in the first intracellular loop. The analysis of the defect in model cells overexpressing the mutated pump and in hair cells of organotypic utricular cultures has revealed a marked depression of the unstimulated, long term ability of the PMCA2w/a variant to export Ca2+ from the stereociliary cytosol. All animals used for Tommy mutant line derivation were housed and maintained in the Mary Lyon Centre at MRC Harwell under specific pathogen-free conditions in individually ventilated cages with environmental conditions outlined in the Home Office Code of Practice. Animal procedures were carried out in line with Home Office regulations, and mice were euthanized by Home Office Schedule 1 methods. The Tommy mutant line was derived from a dominant ENU mutagenesis screen at the MRC MGU Harwell (28Isaacs A.M. Davies K.E. Hunter A.J. Nolan P.M. Vizor L. Peters J. Gale D.G. Kelsell D.P. Latham I.D.

All animals used for ABR recordings and fluorescence microscopy experiments were housed and maintained in the Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine, Padua, Italy. The care and use of the animals were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Padua. Mice were screened according to the SHIRPA protocol (28Isaacs A.M. Davies K.E. Hunter A.J. Nolan P.M. Vizor L. Peters J. Gale D.G. Kelsell D.P. Latham I.D. Chase J.M. Fisher E.M. Bouzyk M.M. Potter A. Masih M. Walsh F.S. Sims M.A. Doncaster K.E. Parsons C.A. Martin J.

Mice with unaffected hearing elicit the “preyer” response, a backwards flick of the ear pinnae. In most cases the preyer reflex is followed by startle response that can range from a contracting of the neck muscles to a rapid jump backwards. A lack of either of the responses was recorded as no response to the click box (29Hardisty-Hughes R.E. Parker A. Brown S.D. Nat. Protoc. 2010; 5: 177-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). We used a pooling strategy employing DNA from affected mice and genome-wide fluorescent simple sequence length polymorphism-based screening (28Isaacs A.M. Davies K.E. Hunter A.J. Nolan P.M. Vizor L. Peters J. Gale D.G. Kelsell D.P. Latham I.D. Chase J.M. Fisher E.M. Bouzyk M.M. Potter A. Masih M. Walsh F.S. Sims M.A. Doncaster K.E. Parsons C.A. Martin J. Brown S.D. Rastan S. Spurr N.K. Gray I.C. Hum. Mol.

Additional polymorphic markers within the critical region were identified from public databases (microsatellite markers: Mouse Genome Informatics, Broad Institute Genetic Map of the Mouse Genome (Whitehead/MIT) and Center for Inherited Disease Research; single nucleotide polymorphism markers: Ensembl, Genomics Institute of the Novartis Research Foundation website) and were tested for polymorphism in the parental strains BALB/cAnN and C3H/HeH. For high resolution mapping, polymorphic microsatellite and single nucleotide polymorphism amplicons were analyzed on 6% acrylamide gels using the single-stranded conformational polymorphism method allowing the Tmy critical region to be reduced to a 6-centimorgan interval flanked by polymorphic microsatellite markers D6Mit287 and D6Mit150 and encompassing the dfw critical region. Mice aged between P18 and P90 were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of zolazepam (25 mg/Kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg). Supplemental doses were then administered as needed. Body temperature was kept at 38 °C by a feedback-controlled heating pad. Each recording procedure lasted up to 70 min. Acoustic stimuli were produced in the free field within a foam-padded, shielded acoustic chamber by a System 3 Real-time Signal Processing System (Tucker-Davis Technologies, Alachua, FL) combined with an ES1 electrostatic speaker mounted 4 cm in front of the mouse's ear. Stimuli consisted in tone bursts (1-ms rise/decay; 3-ms plateau) at 8, 14, 20, 26, and 32 kHz, and clicks (0.1 ms) delivered at a repetition rate of 13 Hz. A maximum of 100 db sound pressure level, was employed for all stimuli. To monitor electrical signals, a subdermal (active) needle electrode was inserted at the vertex, whereas ground and reference electrodes were inserted subdermally in the loose skin beneath the pinnae of opposite ears. Bioelectrical potentials were differentially amplified (50,000×), filtered (5–8,000 Hz), and digitized (25 µs) for averaging (AT MIO 16XE-10, Labview 7.0, National Instruments Corp., Austin, TX). ABR threshold was defined as the lowest step in a 10-db decremented scale at which the IV wave could be recognized by a trained Audiometry specialist. Judgment of threshold was confirmed by a second specialist. In case the IV wave of the ABR could not be discerned in response to the maximum 100-db sound pressure level stimulus, a nominal threshold of 110 db sound pressure level was assigned. mRFP was amplified from pCDNA3.1/zeo-mRFP (donated by Dr. M. Zaccolo, Padua, Italy) using the following primers: forward, 5′-GCGCTAGCATGGCCTCCTCCGAGGACGTCA-3′, and reverse, 5′-GCAGATCTGAGGCGCCGGTGGAGTGGCGG-3′, bearing restriction sites for NheI and BglII, respectively (in bold). The PCR product was than digested with NheI and BglII and inserted in pEGFP-c1 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) digested with NheI and BglII to create pmRFP-c1. PMCA2 w/a in pMM2 (donated by Dr. E. Strehler, Rochester, MN) was excised by independent digestion with SalI-EcoRI and EcoRI-KpnI and inserted into XhoI-KpnI sites of pmRFP-c1 in a three-part ligation reaction resulting in pmRFP-PMCA2 w/a. The construct was controlled by sequencing. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out to obtain the mutant cloned in the appropriate vector. pmRFP-PMCA2 w/a was used as the target, and experiments were performed according to the manufacturer's standard protocol (QuikChange, Stratagene, Cedar Creek, TX). The following primers were used: Tommy 5′-AGCAAAGGTGCTTCGAAGATTGTGCTCAAAA-3′ (forward) and 5′-TTTTGAGCACAATCTTCGAAGCACCTTTGCT-3′ (reverse). The nucleotide that determines the mutation is underscored. CHO cells were grown in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). Before transfection, they were seeded onto 13-mm glass coverslips and allowed to grow to 50% confluence. Transfection with 3 µg of plasmid DNA (or 1.5:1.5 µg in the case of co-transfection) was carried out with a calcium phosphate procedure (30Brini M. Marsault R. Bastianutto C. Alvarez J. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9896-9903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Immunocytochemistry quantified the expressed pump proteins in the plasma membrane of transfected cells. CHO cells expressing the PMCA2 variants were stained with polyclonal isoform-specific PMCA antibody 2N (Affinity Bioreagent, Inc., Golden, CO) or a monoclonal antibody recognizing all pump isoforms (5F10, Affinity Bioreagent) at a 1:100 dilution in PBS. Staining was carried out with Alexa 488-labeled anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen) at a 1:50 dilution in PBS, and total fluorescence intensity in membrane was quantified using software developed in the Laboratory, as previously described (23Ficarella R. Di Leva F. Bortolozzi M. Ortolano S. Donaudy F. Petrillo M. Melchionda S. Lelli A. Domi T. Fedrizzi L. Lim D. Shull G.E. Gasparini P. Brini M. Mammano F. Carafoli E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

For each construct, fluorescence was averaged over a total of 50 cells in 3 different slides. 36 h after transfection CHO cells were washed twice with cold PBS buffer and scraped in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). After centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min, the cells were resuspended in 80 µl of lysis buffer and subjected to three cycles of freeze and thaw. The proteins of the lysates were quantified using the Bradford reagent (Sigma). 20 µg of proteins were loaded on 7.5% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes that were incubated with polyclonal PMCA2 antibody 2N (Sigma, diluted 1:1000) and monoclonal β-actin antibody (Sigma). After incubation with anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidize-conjugated secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), the blots were developed with ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences). The quantitative analysis was carried out by densitometric analysis using the Kodak 1D Image Analysis program (Kodak Scientific Imaging System, New Haven, CT). Antibodies against β-actin were used to normalize the data obtained from the densitometric analyses. Recombinant cytosolic aequorin, as produced inactive by CHO cell transfection, was reconstituted in functional chemiluminescent protein by incubating cells for 1–3 h with 5 µm prosthetic group coelenterazine in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 1% FCS at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Additions to the KRB medium (1 mm CaCl2, 100 µm ATP) were made as specified in the legend of Fig. 5. The experiments and luminescence calibration into Ca2+ values were carried out according to Brini et al. (30Brini M. Marsault R. Bastianutto C. Alvarez J. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9896-9903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Data are reported as the mean ± S.D. Statistical differences were evaluated by Student's 2-tailed t test for unpaired samples. A p value <0.01 was considered statistically significant. We have previously shown that the contribution of the native endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pump (SERCA) to the reduction of Ca2+ level in the cytoplasm is marginal in cells that overexpress PMCA variants (23Ficarella R. Di Leva F. Bortolozzi M. Ortolano S. Donaudy F. Petrillo M. Melchionda S. Lelli A. Domi T. Fedrizzi L. Lim D. Shull G.E. Gasparini P. Brini M. Mammano F. Carafoli E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 1516-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). SERCA pump inhibitors were, thus, not used in these experiments. Furthermore, by comparison with the results of control experiments performed in naive cells (not transfected with PMCA constructs), we determined that the recovery phase is dominated by the overexpressed PMCA2 pump. Similarly, the contribution of plasma membrane Ca2+ influx channels, opened by the emptying of intracellular stores, to the lowering of cytosolic Ca2+ was disregarded, assuming it would have been the same in all conditions tested. Utricles were excised from wild type, heterozygous, or homozygous Tommy mice between P6 and P7. Postnatal mice were decapitated for inner ear extraction, the otic capsule was opened medially in a dissection solution, and the utricle was extracted by micro forceps. The dissection saline was composed of Hanks' balanced salt solution (catalogue no. H6648; Sigma) with 10 mm Hepes, 10,000 units/liter penicillin, and 25 µg/liter Fungizone. The endolymphic compartment was cut open, and the otolithic membrane was removed by the flux of a syringe filled with saline. The utricle epithelium was fixed by Cell-Tak (BD Biosciences) mixed with 90% NaHCO3 to the lateral side of a glass capillary (1.5 mm diameter, 5 mm length) that had been previously glued to a microscope slide by a small drop of Sylgard Silicon Elastomer (Dow Corning, Wiesbaden, Germany). The organs were preserved in culture for 1 day at 37 °C in a complete medium of 95% DMEM/Ham's F-12 (1:1) (with l-glutamine, without Hepes; Invitrogen) and 5% FBS. At recording time, i.e. 1 day after dissection, utricle cultures were loaded with 10 µm Fluo-4 AM (Invitrogen) and 10 µm o-nitrophenyl-EGTA AM (Invitrogen) for 50 min at 37 °C in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 25 µm sulfinpyrazone and Pluronic F-127 (0.1%). For deesterification, cultures were superfused for 10 min with Hanks' balanced salt solution (Invitrogen) supplemented with 4.5 g/liter glucose and 2 mm anhydrous CaCl2 (pH 7.4, osmolality 330 mOsm) and transferred to a chamber mounted on the stage of an upright confocal system (Bio-Rad Radiance 2100) incorporating an Eclipse E600FN optical microscope (Nikon Instruments Europe B.V., 1183AS Amstelveen, The Netherlands) equipped with a water immersion objective (Fluor 60×, 1.0 N.A., Nikon). Intracellular Fluo-4 fluorescence was excited by the 488-nm line of an argon-ion laser and selected around 528 nm by a HQ528/50m narrow-band interference filter. A rapid increase in cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) was achieved by the photorelease of Ca2+ from the Ca2+-bound state of o-nitrophenyl-EGTA. The ultraviolet (UV) illumination used for Ca2+ uncaging covered an area of about 10,000 µm2, comprising a few hair cells, and was generated by a 375-nm solid state laser connected to the microscope through a 600-nm-diameter optical fiber. The recollimated fiber output was reflected off a dichromatic beam splitter (400 DCLP, Chroma) positioned at 45° just above the microscope objective lens. UV light was delivered for 60 ms during the 40th frame (frame rate 7 Hz) under control of a transistor-transistor logic signal generated by a PC that monitored the frame trigger output of the confocal microscope. After obtaining readout for the Fluo-4 base-line fluorescence, f0, in the hair cell, exposure to UV light generated a uniform Ca2+ transient distributed over the whole cell. Ca2+ concentration change was probed by the Δf/f0 signal, defined as the percentage change of Fluo-4 fluorescence f relative to f0 (31Mammano F. Bortolozzi M. Verkhratsky A. Petersen O. Calcium Measurement Methods. Vol. 43. Humana Press, New York2010: 57-80Google Scholar). Image sequences were stored on a disk and processed off-line as previously described (23Ficarella R. Di Leva F.

Here, we show that long actin filaments can be obtained by polymerizing unlabeled rabbit skeletal actin (RS-actin) onto both ends of the short rhodamine-phalloidin-stabilized Plasmodium falciparum actin I (Pf-actin) filaments. Following annealing, hybrid filaments of micron length and ""zebra-striped"" appearance are observed by fluorescence microscopy that are stable enough to move over myosin class II motors in a gliding filament assay. Using negative stain electron microscopy we find that pure Pf-actin stabilized by jasplakinolide (JAS) also forms long filaments, indistinguishable in length from RS-actin filaments, and long enough to be characterized structurally. To compare structures in near physiological conditions in aqueous solution we imaged Pf-actin and RS-actin filaments by atomic force microscopy (AFM). We found the monomer stacking to be distinctly different for Pf-actin compared with RS-actin, such that the pitch of the double helix of Pf-actin filaments was 10% larger. Our results can be explained by a rotational angle between subunits that is larger in the parasite compared with RS-actin. Modeling of the AFM data using high-resolution actin filament models supports our interpretation of the data. The structural differences reported here may be a consequence of weaker inter- and intra-strand contacts, and may be critical for differences in filament dynamics and for regulation of parasite motility."
https://openalex.org/W2075962621,"Sulfiredoxin (Srx) is an enzyme that catalyzes the reduction of cysteine sulfinic acid of hyperoxidized peroxiredoxins and exerts a protective antioxidant role. Here we investigated the regulatory mechanism of Srx induction by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in mouse macrophages. LPS up-regulated Srx expression on the transcriptional level. The promoter region of the Srx gene contained putative NF-κB and AP-1 (activator protein-1) sites, and the proximal site of three AP-1 sites was embedded within the antioxidant response element (ARE), a cis-acting element for Nrf2 (nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor). Mutational analysis of the Srx promoter revealed that Srx induction is dependent on AP-1 sites and ARE but not on NF-κB sites. Consistently, both transcription factors, AP-1 and Nrf2, were required for LPS-mediated Srx induction, as revealed by chromatin immunoprecipitation using antibodies specific for c-Jun and c-Fos and little Srx induction in Nrf2-null bone marrow-derived macrophages. Among mitogen-activated protein kinases that mediate the signal transduction by LPS, JNK played a major role in Srx induction. Moreover, chemical antioxidants, such as N-acetylcysteine and butylated hydroxyanisole, and the NADPH oxidase inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium inhibited Srx induction as well as generation of reactive oxygen species, both of which were also suppressed in Nox2 (NADPH oxidase 2)-deficient bone marrow-derived macrophages. These results suggest that LPS-mediated Srx induction is dependent on both AP-1 and Nrf2, which is regulated by Nox2-derived reactive oxygen species."
https://openalex.org/W1996774536,"Metabotropic GABA(B) receptors are abundantly expressed at glutamatergic synapses where they control excitability of the synapse. Here, we tested the hypothesis that glutamatergic neurotransmission may regulate GABA(B) receptors. We found that application of glutamate to cultured cortical neurons led to rapid down-regulation of GABA(B) receptors via lysosomal degradation. This effect was mimicked by selective activation of AMPA receptors and further accelerated by coactivation of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors. Inhibition of NMDA receptors, blockade of L-type Ca(2+) channels, and removal of extracellular Ca(2+) prevented glutamate-induced down-regulation of GABA(B) receptors, indicating that Ca(2+) influx plays a critical role. We further established that glutamate-induced down-regulation depends on the internalization of GABA(B) receptors. Glutamate did not affect the rate of GABA(B) receptor endocytosis but led to reduced recycling of the receptors back to the plasma membrane. Blockade of lysosomal activity rescued receptor recycling, indicating that glutamate redirects GABA(B) receptors from the recycling to the degradation pathway. In conclusion, the data indicate that sustained activation of AMPA receptors down-regulates GABA(B) receptors by sorting endocytosed GABA(B) receptors preferentially to lysosomes for degradation on the expense of recycling. This mechanism may relieve glutamatergic synapses from GABA(B) receptor-mediated inhibition resulting in increased synaptic excitability."

To study the structural basis of the neurotoxicity mediated by the E2–25K-UBB+1 interaction, we determined the three-dimensional structures of UBB+1, E2–25K and the E2–25K/ubiquitin, and E2–25K/UBB+1 complex. The structures revealed that ubiquitin or UBB+1 is bound to E2–25K via the enzyme MGF motif and residues in α9 of the enzyme. Polyubiquitylation assays together with analyses of various E2–25K mutants showed that disrupting UBB+1 binding markedly diminishes synthesis of neurotoxic UBB+1-anchored polyubiquitin. These results suggest that the interaction between E2–25K and UBB+1 is critical for the synthesis and accumulation of UBB+1-anchored polyubiquitin, which results in proteasomal inhibition and neuronal cell death.

The pathological hallmarks of neurodegenerative diseases are the accumulation of abnormal proteins, neuritic plaques, neuropil threads, and neurofibrillary tangles (1Lee V.M. Goedert M. Trojanowski J.Q. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1121-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (2162) Google Scholar). Although all aspects of this aggregation are considered harmful, the aberrant protein accumulation is likely the principal cause of disease. Among these proteins are presenilin-processed amyloid-β peptide (Aβ), 4The abbreviations used are: Aβamyloid-β peptideE1ubiquitin-activating enzymeE2ubiquitin-conjugating enzymeE3ubiquitin-protein ligaseGFPugreen fluorescent protein fused to a short degronNOESYtwo-dimensional nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) spectroscopyr.m.s.d.root mean square deviationUbubiquitinUBAubiquitin-associated domainUBB+1the frame shift mutant of ubiquitin BUPSubiquitin-proteasome systemHSQCheteronuclear single quantum correlationTROSYtransverse relaxation optimized spectroscopyDsRedDiscosoma sp. red fluorescent protein. a mutant form of ubiquitin (UBB+1), and polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin (2de Pril R.

UBB+1 was first identified as a frameshift mutant of the ubiquitin (Ub) B protein in the brains of neurodegenerative disease patients (3van Leeuwen F.W. de Kleijn D.P. van den Hurk H.H. Neubauer A.

Neither Aβ nor UBB+1 is found in young patients not suffering from dementia, but they are observed in older Alzheimer disease patients (4Hilbich C. Mönning U. Grund C. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26571-26577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The genes from which UBB+1 mRNAs are transcribed contain several GAGAG motifs, and dinucleotide deletions (ΔGA) from within the GAGAG motif result in an abnormal C-terminal sequence. Normally these aberrant proteins are removed by the Ub-proteasome system (UPS), which executes the proteolytic degradation of aberrant proteins via a Ub-tagging mechanism (3van Leeuwen F.W. de Kleijn D.P. van den Hurk H.H.

Within the UPS, Ub tagging of target molecules entails enzymatic reactions catalyzed by the E1 (Ub-activating), E2 (Ub-conjugating), and E3 (Ub-ligating) enzymes. Once E3 tags a target molecule with mono- or polyUb, the tagged molecule is recognized by the 26 S proteasome and degraded (6Fang S. Weissman A.M. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 1546-1561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the healthy brain both β-amyloid precursor protein and UBB+1 molecules are targets for the UPS and are degraded by the 26 S proteasome (7Sherman M.Y. Goldberg A.L. Neuron. 2001; 29: 15-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar, 8Ciechanover A. Brundin P. Neuron. 2003; 40: 427-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar). In the brains of Alzheimer patients, however, both UBB+1 and Ub are present within aggregation plaques also containing β-amyloid precursor protein, which is indicative of UPS dysfunction (9Fischer D.F. De Vos R.A. Van Dijk R. De Vrij F.M. Proper E.A. Sonnemans M.A. Verhage M.C. Sluijs J.A. Hobo B. Zouambia M. Steur E.N. Kamphorst W. Hol E.M. Van Leeuwen F.W.

When at normal basal levels, UBB+1 can be removed by the UPS. But when its expression is up-regulated, UBB+1 inhibits the 26 S proteasome in a dose-dependent manner, resulting in the accumulation of aberrant proteins (11van Tijn P. de Vrij F.M. Schuurman K.G. Dantuma N.P. Fischer D.F. van Leeuwen F.W. Hol E.M. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 1615-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The aberrant C terminus of UBB+1 prevents its activation and, therefore, subsequent ligation to substrates due to the absence of a residue corresponding to Gly76 in Ub; instead, UBB+1 serves as a scaffold for ligation of Ub molecules to produce polyUb that is anchored by UBB+1 (on the unaffected Lys-48 site). These molecules are reportedly refractory to the deubiquitinating enzyme system (12Lam Y.A. Pickart C.M. Alban A. Landon M. Jamieson C. Ramage R. Mayer R.J. Layfield R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 9902-9906Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Consequently, when UBB+1-anchored polyUb is targeted to the 26 S proteasome, it acts as a functional antagonist, inhibiting the activity of the proteasome and leading to Aβ neurotoxicity (13Song S. Kim S.Y. Hong Y.M. Jo D.G. Lee J.Y. Shim S.M. Chung C.W. Seo S.J. Yoo Y.J. Koh J.Y. Lee M.C. Yates A.J. Ichijo H. Jung Y.K. Mol.

E2–25K is an unusual member of the E2 family in that it is competent to catalyze ubiquitin chain extension independent of E3 ligases (15Chen Z. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21835-21842Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to an E2 domain that is 22–48% identical to other human E2s, E2–25K also contains a UBA domain that is unique to this paralog (supplemental Fig. 1A). UBA domains appear to be generally involved in interactions with Ub, but the precise function of the E2–25K UBA domain is currently unclear, although evidence suggests it is important for polyubiquitylation activity. Moreover, a chimeric protein in which the UBA domain of E2–25K was fused to the E2 domain of yeast UBC4 showed no polyUb synthetic activity, suggesting that polyubiquitylation by E2–25K is dependent on the relative conformations of the E2 and UBA domains and their specific interactions (15Chen Z. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21835-21842Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, it was recently reported that an active site mutation, C92S or S86Y, or deletion of the UBA domain of E2–25K eliminated Aβ neurotoxicity (13Song S. Kim S.Y. Hong Y.M. Jo D.G. Lee J.Y. Shim S.M. Chung C.W. Seo S.J. Yoo Y.J. Koh J.Y. Lee M.C. Yates A.J. Ichijo H. Jung Y.K. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 553-563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Based on these findings, it was proposed that UBB+1 interacts with the UBA domain of E2–25K and participates in the polyubiquitylation process that produces the UBB+1-anchored polyUb chains. Details of the mechanism are not yet known, however. In this report we present the three-dimensional structures of UBB+1, E2–25K, E2–25K/Ub, and E2–25K/UBB+1 determined by x-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy. We also analyzed in detail the interaction between E2–25K and UBB+1 and propose that the accumulation of UBB+1-anchored polyUb reflects a direct interaction between the E2–25K UBA domain and UBB+1 and results in cell death due to proteasomal inhibition. The cDNAs encoding E2–25K, UBB+1, and Ub were amplified by PCR using synthetic oligonucleotides and subcloned into the Escherichia coli expression vectors pET32a (Amersham Biosciences) and pET28b (Novagen) and the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3. The sense primers were designed to encode the tobacco etch virus protease recognition sequence (ENLYFQG). Residue-specific mutations of E2–25K (M172A, G173A, F174A, V190A, T194A, L198A, V190A/T194A, M172A/F174A/L198A) were accomplished using the PCR mutation method (16Hutchison 3rd, C.A. Phillips S. Edgell M.H. Gillam S. Jahnke P. Smith M. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 6551-6560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All plasmid DNAs were transformed into E. coli strain BL21 (DE3), which was grown in LB or M9 minimal medium for 12 h at 25 °C after induction with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. After the affinity chromatography, we removed the TRX-His tag (pET32a) or His tag (pET28b) by incubation with tobacco etch virus or thrombin protease, respectively, for 12 h at 25 °C. The purified proteins were then subjected to size exclusion chromatography on Superdex 75 (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with final buffer. For NMR experiments, 15N- or 13C/15N-labeled proteins were purified from cells grown in M9 minimal medium containing 15NH4Cl (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories Inc.) with or without d-[13C6]glucose (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories Inc.). E2–25K, Ub, and UBB+1 were concentrated to 20, 30, and 30 mg/ml, respectively, using a centriprep (Amicon). The buffer used for E2–25K and Ub crystallization contained 20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5) and 150 mm NaCl. The buffer used for UBB+1 crystallization contained 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 150 mm NaCl. E2–25K crystals were grown at 18 °C in a 2-μl sitting drop containing equal volumes of protein solution and mother liquor (100 mm sodium cacodylate (pH 6.6), 18% (w/v) PEG 8000, and 100 mm sodium acetate). The purified E2–25K was mixed with Ub or UBB+1 at a 1:2 molar ratio. Crystals of E2–25K/Ub and E2–25K/UBB+1 complexes were grown in a 2-μl hanging drop containing equal volumes of the protein solution and mother liquor (E2–25K/Ub: 100 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5), 25% (w/v) PEG 3350, and 50 mm sodium fluoride; E2–25K/UBB+1: 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) and 25% (w/v) PEG 3350). The crystals were cryoprotected in reservoir solution supplemented with 10% or 25% (v/v) glycerol. All the diffraction data were collected at 100 K. Diffraction data for E2–25K were collected at 2.4 Å resolution on a Rigaku FR-E generator equipped with a R-AXIS IV2+ detector, then processed and scaled using CRYSTALCLEAR (Rigaku). The structure was solved using the molecular replacement method with the program AMORE (17Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr.

For E2–25K titration, the molar ratios of 15N-labeled E2–25K to UBB+1 or Ub were 1:1, 1:2.5, 1:5, 1:7.5, and 1:10. For UBB+1 or Ub titration, the molar ratios were 1:1, 1:2.5, and 1:5. Chemical shift perturbations were calculated using the equation ΔδAV = ((Δδ1H)2 + (Δδ15N/5)2)1/2, where ΔδAV, Δδ1H, and Δδ15N are the average, proton, and 15N chemical shift changes, respectively. We determined the dissociation constant (Kd) from the NMR titration. After confirmation of complex saturation at a molar ratio of 1:10, we selected six isotherms (Met-172, Gly-173, Phe-174, Val-190, Thr-194, and Leu-198) and plotted the proton chemical shift changes based on the molar ratio. For nonlinear curve fitting (33Murphy J.M. Korzhnev D.M. Ceccarelli D.F. Briant D.J. Zarrine-Afsar A. Sicheri F. Kay L.E. Pawson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 14336-14341Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), we used the equation y(x) = 0.5b[(x + 1 + a) − ((x + 1 + a)2 − 4x)0.5], where x, a, and b are the unlabeled UBB+1/or Ub/15N-labeled E2–25K molar ratio, Kd/(total 15N labeled E2–25K concentration), and maximum proton chemical shift change (Δδ1H), respectively, and y(x) is the Δδ1H at a given x. All calculations were done using ORIGIN 7.5 software (OriginLab Corp.). Ub or UBB+1 were cloned into pGEX-4T-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences), expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells, and purified on glutathione-Sepharose. Wild-type or mutant E2–25K was incubated with GST alone, GST-Ub, or GST-UBB+1 in 1× PBS at a molar ratio of 1:1 for 3 h at 4 °C in the presence of 50 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads (Peptron). The bound proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed by Western blotting using an anti-E2–25K antibody. B103 cells (rat neuroblastoma cells) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. Cells were transfected using LipofectamineTM reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol, after which their viability was assessed based on the morphology of GFP+ cells viewed under a fluorescence microscope (Leica DMRBE). We measured the accumulation green fluorescent protein fused to a short degron (GFPu) and Discosoma sp. red fluorescent protein (DsRed) as an index of intracellular proteasome activity in 293F cells overexpressing wild-type E2–25K or E2–25K mutants. Twenty-four hours after transfection of pDsRed plasmid and wild-type or mutant pGFPu-E2–25K plasmid into 293F cells, the cells were examined under a fluorescence microscope. 293F cells expressing only GFP (pcDNA3) were detected based on their red color; because the GFP was successfully removed by proteasome, only DsRed was detected. E2–25K transfectants were detected based on their yellow color, reflecting the combination of the green fluorescence from GFPu and red fluorescence from DsRed. Inhibition of proteasome was examined as previously described by Song et al. (13Song S. Kim S.Y. Hong Y.M. Jo D.G. Lee J.Y. Shim S.M. Chung C.W. Seo S.J. Yoo Y.J. Koh J.Y. Lee M.C. Yates A.J.

Briefly, pGFPu (an artificial proteasome substrate; 50 ng) together with each plasmid expressing E2–25K (500 ng) and pDsRed (50 ng) was transiently transfected into 293F cells. After 24 h the transfectants were examined under a fluorescence microscope to determine the relative numbers of GFP+ and DsRed+ cells. To assay UBB+1 anchoring, the ubiquitylation activities of E2–25K and its mutants were measured based on an in vitro reaction run with UBB+1 (50 μm), Ub (50 μm), E1 (0.1 μm), E2–25K (1 μm), and ATP (5 mm). The 20-μl reaction mixtures containing wild-type or mutant E2–25K proteins were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C and analyzed by Western blotting with rat polyclonal anti-UBB+1 antibody (2000:1), which was previously described by Song et al. (13Song S. Kim S.Y. Hong Y.M. Jo D.G. Lee J.Y. Shim S.M. Chung C.W. Seo S.J. Yoo Y.J. Koh J.Y. Lee M.C. Yates A.J. Ichijo H. Jung Y.K. Mol.

Two molecules of E2–25K were observed in the asymmetric unit; the overall conformations of the two E2–25K proteins were almost identical, with a root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) of 0.77 Å for 196 Cα atom pairs. The crystal structure of E2–25K revealed two well defined domains, the E2 and ubiquitin associating (UBA) domains, that are linked by a short tether (154-GAPVSS-159) and tightly interact (Fig. 1A). The canonical E2-core-fold (residues 1–153) is defined by a β-sheet (β1-β4) with flanking helices (α1-α6). The UBA domain consists of a three-helix bundle (α7-α9) with a hydrophobic core formed by helix α7 (Leu-166 and Leu-169), helix α8 (Val-179 and Leu-183) and a loop connects helices α8 and α9 (Trp-188). This structure is similar to that of a recently described E2–25K M172A mutant (34Wilson R.C. Hughes R.C. Flatt J.W. Meehan E.J. Ng J.D. Twigg P.D. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2009; 65: 440-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar); the r.m.s.d. between that structure and ours was 0.64 Å for 200 Cα atom pairs. The E2 and UBA domains interact with one another through both hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions. The interface is made predominantly by helices α5-α6 of the E2 domain and helices α7-α8 of the UBA domain (Fig. 1B). Tyr-162, Ile-180, and Trp-188 of the UBA domain form a hydrophobic patch adjacent to residues Trp-80, Met-140, Leu-147, Trp-148, and Val-151 of the E2 domain (Fig. 1B). The hydrophobic interactions between the two domains are further stabilized by several hydrogen bonds (Tyr-152–Asn177, Trp-148—Ser-184, and Thr-144—Trp-188), and the 6-residue tether also contributes to the clustering of the two domains through both hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions. The active site is composed of the β4-α3 and α4-α5 loops. The Ub conjugating residue Cys-92 and the residue involved in activity regulation, Ser-86, are situated in close proximity to Asn-83 and Asp-127, respectively (Fig. 1C). To understand the structural basis of Ub recognition by E2–25K, we solved the structure of the E2–25K/Ub complex (Fig. 2A). The structures of the Ub-complexed and apo forms of E2–25K were nearly identical with an r.m.s.d. of 0.77 Å for 196 Cα atom pairs. E2–25K binds to Ub mainly via residues in the α7-α8 loop and helix α9 and involves about 400 Å2 of surface area (4.1% of total surface area) (Fig. 2B). That the surface of the intermolecular contact is relatively small is consistent with the low binding affinity (Kd = 400 μm) between E2–25K and Ub (35Raasi S. Varadan R. Fushman D. Pickart C.M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 708-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), as compared with other UBA domains whose affinities for Ub have been reported (Kd = 10–500 μm) (36Hicke L. Schubert H.L. Hill C.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 610-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). The UBA domain interacts with Ub mainly via the hydrophobic patches formed by Leu-8, Ile-44, His-68, and Val-70 of Ub and Met-172, Phe-174, Val-190, Thr-194, and Leu-198 of the UBA domain. Electrostatic interactions further stabilize the hydrophobic interactions; the backbone carbonyl group of Met-172 and the side chain of Glu-195 in the UBA interact with the backbone amide group of Gly-47 and the side chain of Arg-42 in Ub, respectively (Fig. 2B). The backbone NMR resonance assignments of E2–25K were completed using data from TROSY-based triple resonance experiments (supplemental Fig. 2). The TROSY-HSQC spectra for E2–25K at various molar ratios in solution with Ub were consistent with the crystal structure and showed that residues involved in intermolecular interaction experience marked chemical shift changes upon Ub binding (Fig. 2C and supplemental Fig. 3A). The average Kd was 1.514 ± 0.342 mm. Sequence comparison of the E2–25K UBA domain with other UBA domains showed that the residues forming the hydrophobic patch that interact with Ub are well conserved (supplemental Fig. 1B). To confirm the contribution made by critical residues in E2–25K to Ub binding, we carried out pulldown assays with various E2–25K mutants. In contrast to wild-type E2–25K, single mutations (M172A, F174A, V190A, T194A, and L198A), a double mutation (V190A/T194A), and a triple mutation (M172A/F174A/L198A) within the UBA domain all disrupted E2–25K ability to bind Ub, whereas a G173A mutation, which did not affect the hydrophobic interaction, had little effect on binding (Fig. 2D). The solution structure of UBB+1 shows a well structured and defined region with a Ub sequence (M1-G75) and a C-terminal structure with an aberrant tail (Tyr-76—Gln-95) (Fig. 3A and supplemental Fig. 3B). When we separately superimposed the two regions using backbone atoms, the Ub region was well fitted with an r.m.s.d. of 0.54 ± 0.16 Å, whereas the tail region (G75-H88) had an r.m.s.d. of 1.86 ± 0.23 Å. This implies that the aberrant tail of UBB+1 has a structure, although it is not well defined due to a lack of NOE information. Heteronuclear NOE data were consistent with the structural tendency of the tail region, i.e. the tail region had a heteronuclear NOE value of about 0.48 (Fig. 3B), which indicates the region has a structure that is independent of the Ub region. In addition, the two regions of UBB+1 show distinctly different dynamic behaviors (supplemental Fig. 3C). To better understand the structural basis of the interaction between UBB+1 and E2–25K, we determined the crystal structure of the E2–25K/UBB+1 complex. The overall structure of the complex was similar to that of the E2–25K/Ub complex; the r.m.s.d. between the two structures was 1.08 Å for 269 Cα atom pairs (Fig. 4, A and B). In addition, the r.m.s.d. between E2–25K in complex with Ub and UBB+1 was 0.69 Å for 197 Cα atom pairs, whereas the r.m.s.d. between Ub and UBB+1 in complex with E2–25K was 0.59 Å for 72 Cα atom pairs. Notably, the electron density for the main chain C-terminal residues (amino acids 73–75) was clearly observable in the E2–25K/UBB+1 structure, whereas this region was highly disordered and invisible within t"
https://openalex.org/W2009577867,"The kallikrein-kinin system, along with the interlocking renin-angiotensin system, is a key regulator of vascular contractility and injury response. The principal effectors of the kallikrein-kinin system are plasma and tissue kallikreins, proteases that cleave high molecular weight kininogen to produce bradykinin. Most of the cellular actions of kallikrein (KK) are thought to be mediated by bradykinin, which acts via G protein-coupled B1 and B2 bradykinin receptors on VSMCs and endothelial cells. Here, we find that primary aortic vascular smooth muscle but not endothelial cells possess the ability to activate plasma prekallikrein. Surprisingly, exposing VSMCs to prekallikrein leads to activation of the ERK1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade via a mechanism that requires kallikrein activity but does not involve bradykinin receptors. In transfected HEK293 cells, we find that plasma kallikrein directly activates G protein-coupled protease-activated receptors (PARs) 1 and 2, which possess consensus kallikrein cleavage sites, but not PAR4. In vascular smooth muscles, KK stimulates ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloprotease) 17 activity via a PAR1/2 receptor-dependent mechanism, leading sequentially to release of the endogenous ADAM17 substrates, amphiregulin and tumor necrosis factor-α, metalloprotease-dependent transactivation of epidermal growth factor receptors, and metalloprotease and epidermal growth factor receptor-dependent ERK1/2 activation. These results suggest a novel mechanism of bradykinin-independent kallikrein action that may contribute to the regulation of vascular responses in pathophysiologic states, such as diabetes mellitus."
https://openalex.org/W2167018447,"One of the proliferating cell nuclear antigen loader complexes, Ctf18-replication factor C (RFC), is involved in sister chromatid cohesion. To examine its relationship with factors involved in DNA replication, we performed a proteomics analysis of Ctf18-interacting proteins. We found that Ctf18 interacts with a replicative DNA polymerase, DNA polymerase ε (pol ε). Co-immunoprecipitation with recombinant Ctf18-RFC and pol ε demonstrated that their binding is direct and mediated by two distinct interactions, one weak and one stable. Three subunits that are specifically required for cohesion in yeast, Ctf18, Dcc1, and Ctf8, formed a trimeric complex (18-1-8) and together enabled stable binding with pol ε. The C-terminal 23-amino acid stretch of Ctf18 was necessary for the trimeric association of 18-1-8 and was required for the stable interaction. The weak interaction was observed with alternative loader complexes including Ctf18-RFC(5), which lacks Dcc1 and Ctf8, suggesting that the common loader structures, including the RFC small subunits (RFC2-5), are responsible for the weak interaction. The two interaction modes, mediated through distinguishable structures of Ctf18-RFC, both occurred through the N-terminal half of pol ε, which includes the catalytic domain. The addition of Ctf18-RFC or Ctf18-RFC(5) to the DNA synthesis reaction caused partial inhibition and stimulation, respectively. Thus, Ctf18-RFC has multiple interactions with pol ε that promote polymorphic modulation of DNA synthesis. We propose that their interaction alters the DNA synthesis mode to enable the replication fork to cooperate with the establishment of cohesion."
https://openalex.org/W2047504529,"Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-like cytokine (TL1A) is a T-cell costimulator that bolsters cytokine-induced activation through death receptor 3 (DR3). To explore the relationship between T-cell activation and TL1A responsiveness, flow cytometry profiled DR3 expression in resting and activated T cells. In human CD4(+) T cells, DR3 was induced rapidly following activation and expressed prominently by interleukin (IL)-17-secreting T cells (Th17). Splenic T cells from wild-type and DR3-deficient mice showed that TL1A activation of DR3 inhibits Th17 generation (81 ± 2.6% at 100 ng/ml TL1A) from naive T cells. This response was not associated with suppression of T-cell proliferation. Using neutralizing antibodies or T cells derived from genetically modified mice, TL1A inhibition of Th17 development was found to be independent of IL-2, IL-27, γIFN, IFNAR1, and STAT1. Under suboptimal TCR activation, TL1A continued to block IL-17A secretion, however, the reduced threshold of TCR engagement was now linked with an increase in TL1A-driven proliferation. In contrast, fully committed Th17 cells displayed an altered TL1A responsiveness and in the absence of TCR costimulation supported the maintenance of T cell IL-17A expression. Consequently, TL1A orchestrates unique outcomes in naive and effector T-helper cells, which may affect the proliferation, differentiation and maintenance of Th17 cells in peripheral compartments and inflamed tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2067497860,"We recently demonstrated that the Gla domain-dependent interaction of protein C with endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) leads to dissociation of the receptor from caveolin-1 and recruitment of PAR-1 to a protective signaling pathway. Thus, the activation of PAR-1 by either thrombin or PAR-1 agonist peptide elicited a barrier-protective response if endothelial cells were preincubated with protein C. In this study, we examined whether other vitamin K-dependent coagulation protease zymogens can modulate PAR-dependent signaling responses in endothelial cells. We discovered that the activation of both PAR-1 and PAR-2 in endothelial cells pretreated with factor FX (FX)-S195A, but not other procoagulant protease zymogens, also results in initiation of protective intracellular responses. Interestingly, similar to protein C, FX interaction with endothelial cells leads to dissociation of EPCR from caveolin-1 and recruitment of PAR-1 to a protective pathway. Further studies revealed that, FX activated by factor VIIa on tissue factor bearing endothelial cells also initiates protective signaling responses through the activation of PAR-2 independent of EPCR mobilization. All results could be recapitulated by the receptor agonist peptides to both PAR-1 and PAR-2. These results suggest that a cross-talk between EPCR and an unknown FX/FXa receptor, which does not require interaction with the Gla domain of FX, recruits PAR-1 to protective signaling pathways in endothelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2012100512,"Phosphatidic acid (PA) is one of the major phospholipids in the plasma membrane. Although it has been reported that PA plays key roles in cell survival and morphology, it remains unknown when and where PA is produced in the living cell. Based on the principle of Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET), we generated PA biosensor, and named Pii (phosphatidic acid indicator). In these biosensors, the lipid-binding domain of DOCK2 is sandwiched with the cyan fluorescent protein and yellow fluorescent protein and is tagged with the plasma membrane-targeting sequence of K-Ras. The addition of synthetic PA, or the activation of phospholipase D or diacylglycerol kinase at the plasma membrane, changed the level of FRET in Pii-expressing cells, demonstrating the response of Pii to PA. The biosensor also detected divergent PA content among various cell lines as well as within one cell line. Interestingly, the growth factor-induced increment in PA content correlated negatively with the basal PA content before stimulation, suggesting the presence of an upper threshold in the PA concentration at the plasma membrane. The biosensor also revealed uneven PA distribution within the cell, i.e. the basal level and growth factor-induced accumulation of PA was higher at the cell-free edges than at the cell-cell contact region. An insufficient increase in PA may account for ineffective Ras activation at areas of cell-cell contact. In conclusion, the PA biosensor Pii is a versatile tool for examining heterogeneity in the content and distribution of PA in single cells as well as among different cells."

https://openalex.org/W1998408889,"Myosin IIIa (Myo3A) transports cargo to the distal end of actin protrusions and contains a kinase domain that is thought to autoregulate its activity. Because Myo3A tends to cluster at the tips of actin protrusions, we investigated whether intermolecular phosphorylation could regulate Myo3A biochemical activity, cellular localization, and cellular function. Inactivation of Myo3A 2IQ kinase domain with the point mutation K50R did not alter maximal ATPase activity, whereas phosphorylation of Myo3A 2IQ resulted in reduced maximal ATPase activity and actin affinity. The rate and degree of Myo3A 2IQ autophosphorylation was unchanged by the presence of actin but was found to be dependent upon Myo3A 2IQ concentration within the range of 0.1 to 1.2 μm, indicating intermolecular autophosphorylation. In cultured cells, we observed that the filopodial tip localization of Myo3A lacking the kinase domain decreased when co-expressed with kinase-active, full-length Myo3A. The cellular consequence of reduced Myo3A tip localization was decreased filopodial density along the cell periphery, identifying a novel cellular function for Myo3A in mediating the formation and stability of actin-based protrusions. Our results suggest that Myo3A motor activity is regulated through a mechanism involving concentration-dependent autophosphorylation. We suggest that this regulatory mechanism plays an essential role in mediating the transport and actin bundle formation/stability functions of Myo3A."
https://openalex.org/W2059268708,"Dendritic spines are small actin-rich structures that receive the majority of excitatory synaptic input in the brain. The actin-based dynamics of spines are thought to mediate synaptic plasticity, which underlies cognitive processes, such as learning and memory. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that regulate actin dynamics in spines and synapses. In this study we show the multifunctional actin-binding protein vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) regulates the density, size, and morphology of dendritic spines by inducing actin assembly in these structures. Knockdown of endogenous VASP by siRNA led to a significant decrease in the density of spines and synapses, whereas expression of siRNA-resistant VASP rescued this defect. The ability of VASP to modulate spine and synapse formation, maturation, and spine head enlargement is dependent on its actin binding Ena/VASP homology 2 (EVH2) domain and its EVH1 domain, which contributes to VASP localization to actin-rich structures. Moreover, VASP increases the amount of PSD-scaffolding proteins and the number of surface GluR1-containing α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid receptors (AMPARs) in spines. VASP knockdown results in a reduction in surface AMPAR density, suggesting a role for this protein in regulating synaptic strength. Consistent with this, VASP significantly enhances the retention of GluR1 in spines as determined by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching and increases AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission. Collectively, our results suggest that actin polymerization and bundling by VASP are critical for spine formation, expansion, and modulating synaptic strength."
https://openalex.org/W1984977801,"Alginates are commercially valuable and complex polysaccharides composed of varying amounts and distribution patterns of 1-4-linked β-D-mannuronic acid (M) and α-L-guluronic acid (G). This structural variability strongly affects polymer physicochemical properties and thereby both commercial applications and biological functions. One promising approach to alginate fine structure elucidation involves the use of alginate lyases, which degrade the polysaccharide by cleaving the glycosidic linkages through a β-elimination reaction. For such studies one would ideally like to have different lyases, each of which cleaves only one of the four possible linkages in alginates: G-G, G-M, M-G, and M-M. So far no lyase specific for only G-G linkages has been described, and here we report the construction of such an enzyme by mutating the gene encoding Klebsiella pneumoniae lyase AlyA (a polysaccharide lyase family 7 lyase), which cleaves both G-G and G-M linkages. After error-prone PCR mutagenesis and high throughput screening of ∼7000 lyase mutants, enzyme variants with a strongly improved G-G specificity were identified. Furthermore, in the absence of Ca(2+), one of these lyases (AlyA5) was found to display no detectable activity against G-M linkages. G-G linkages were cleaved with ∼10% of the optimal activity under the same conditions. The substitutions conferring altered specificity to the mutant enzymes are located in conserved regions in the polysaccharide lyase family 7 alginate lyases. Structure-function analyses by comparison with the known three-dimensional structure of Sphingomonas sp. A1 lyase A1-II' suggests that the improved G-G specificity might be caused by increased affinity for nonproductive binding of the alternating G-M structure."

In the present study, we have demonstrated a Ca(2+)-dependent, stoichiometric interaction between CaM and a CaM-binding domain (CaMBD) located within the C terminus of CaSR (residues 871-898). Our studies suggest a wrapping around 1-14-like mode of interaction that involves global conformational changes in both lobes of CaM with concomitant formation of a helical structure in the CaMBD. More importantly, the Ca(2+)-dependent association between CaM and the C terminus of CaSR is critical for maintaining proper responsiveness of intracellular Ca(2+) responses to changes in extracellular Ca(2+) and regulating cell surface expression of the receptor."

Before diquat treatment, Ames dwarf mice, compared with nonmutant littermate controls, had 2- to 6-fold higher levels of expression of mRNAs for immediate early genes and 2- to 5-fold higher levels of mRNAs for genes dependent on the transcription factor Nrf2. Diquat led to a 2-fold increase in phosphorylation of the stress kinase ERK in control (but not Ames dwarf) mice and to a 50% increase in phosphorylation of the kinase JNK2 in Ames dwarf (but not control) mice. Diquat induction of Nrf2 protein was higher in dwarf mice than in controls. Of 6 Nrf2-responsive genes evaluated, 4 (HMOX, NQO-1, MT-1, and MT-2) remained 2- to 10-fold lower in control than in dwarf liver after diquat, and the other 2 (GCLM and TXNRD) reached levels already seen in dwarf liver at baseline. Thus, livers of Ames dwarf mice differ systematically from controls in multiple stress resistance pathways before and after exposure to diquat, suggesting mechanisms for stress resistance and extended longevity in Ames dwarf mice."

Genetic studies confirm the findings; transient knockdown of Smad2, Smad3, or p38 MAPK blunt Tgfβ2 effects, as does Cre recombinase treatment of Tgfbr2fl/fl MEFs to delete Tgfβ receptor II. Chromatin immunoprecipitation reveals that Tgfβ rapidly induces Smads 2/3 binding and histone H3 acetylation at genomic DNA proximal to Arf exon 1β. This is followed by increased RNA polymerase II binding and progressively increased Arf primary and mature transcripts from 24 through 72 h, indicating that increased transcription contributes to p19Arf increase. Last, Arf induction by oncogenic Ras depends on p38 MAPK but is independent of TβrI activation of Smad 2.

Genetic studies confirm the findings; transient knockdown of Smad2, Smad3, or p38 MAPK blunt Tgfβ2 effects, as does Cre recombinase treatment of Tgfbr2fl/fl MEFs to delete Tgfβ receptor II. Chromatin immunoprecipitation reveals that Tgfβ rapidly induces Smads 2/3 binding and histone H3 acetylation at genomic DNA proximal to Arf exon 1β. This is followed by increased RNA polymerase II binding and progressively increased Arf primary and mature transcripts from 24 through 72 h, indicating that increased transcription contributes to p19Arf increase. Last, Arf induction by oncogenic Ras depends on p38 MAPK but is independent of TβrI activation of Smad 2. These findings add to our understanding of how developmental and tumorigenic signals control Arf expression in vivo and in cultured MEFs. Arf is conserved in amniotes as a gene encoding p19Arf (p14ARF in humans), a tumor suppressor that exerts its effects by both p53-dependent and -independent mechanisms (1Sherr C.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 663-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Early studies, predominantly in cultured cells, showed that Arf is induced to check proliferation in sequentially passed MEFs 3The abbreviations used are: MEFmouse embryo fibroblastRNA Pol IIRNA polymerase IITβrI and TβrIITgfβ type I and type II receptors, respectively. in vitro (2Kamijo T.

Moreover, Arf expression is augmented in the presence of certain oncoproteins, like adenovirus E1A, Myc, E2F, Bcr-Abl, and RasV12 (3Zindy F. Eischen C.M. Randle D.H. Kamijo T. Cleveland J.L.

These findings coupled with the initial failure to identify Arf expression in the developing mouse embryo (8Zindy F. Quelle D.E. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar) led to the concept that Arf acts as an oncogene sensor that is induced by cell autonomous mechanisms in response to inappropriate or excessive cell proliferation signals (9Lowe S.W. Sherr C.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2003; 13: 77-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). mouse embryo fibroblast RNA polymerase II Tgfβ type I and type II receptors, respectively. More recent observations point toward Arf regulators extending beyond oncogenic signals. For instance, mouse Arf expression increases with age in a variety of cells that have not suffered overt oncogenic stress (10Krishnamurthy J. Torrice C. Ramsey M.R. Kovalev G.I. Al-Regaiey K. Su L. Sharpless N.E. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 114: 1299-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (1115) Google Scholar). Closer evaluation of the developing mouse embryo shows Arf to be robustly expressed in a temporally and spatially restricted pattern in the developing hyaloid vessels and cornea in the eye and also in perivascular cells flanking the intra-embryonic umbilical vessels (11McKeller R.N. Fowler J.L. Cunningham J.J. Warner N. Smeyne R.J. Zindy F. Skapek S.X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 3848-3853Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 12Martin A.C. Thornton J.D. Liu J.

A developmental function of p19Arf is only clear in the pericyte-like cells in the hyaloid vessels of the primary vitreous, where it prevents overgrowth of the pericytes to prompt the developmentally timed regression of the hyaloid vessels (12Martin A.C. Thornton J.D. Liu J. Wang X. Zuo J. Jablonski M.M. Chaum E. Zindy F. Skapek S.X. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2004; 45: 3387-3396Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Homozygous Arf deletion results in primary vitreous hyperplasia, ocular lens opacification, retinal dysplasia, and blindness by 2 weeks of age (11McKeller R.N. Fowler J.L. Cunningham J.J. Warner N. Smeyne R.J. Zindy F. Skapek S.X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 3848-3853Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 12Martin A.C. Thornton J.D. Liu J. Wang X. Zuo J. Jablonski M.M.

The expanded role of p19Arf in the embryo raises the question of how developmental signals operate and whether they overlap with oncogenic signals controlling Arf. Using a candidate-gene approach, transforming growth factor β2 (Tgfβ2), a member of the Tgfβ cytokine superfamily, was recently found to be critical for Arf expression at several sites in the developing mouse (13Freeman-Anderson N.E. Zheng Y. McCalla-Martin A.C. Treanor L.M. Zhao Y.D. Garfin P.M. He T.C. Mary M.N. Thornton J.D. Anderson C. Gibbons M. Saab R. Baumer S.H. Cunningham J.M. Skapek S.X. Development. 2009; 136: 2081-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Supporting the importance of this finding, mouse embryos lacking Tgfβ2 have primary vitreous hyperplasia similar to that observed in Arf−/− embryos (14Sanford L.P. Ormsby I.

Importantly, these observations can be replicated in vitro because exogenous Tgfβ2 enhances Arf expression in cultured MEFs and maintains a proliferation arrest in an Arf-dependent manner (13Freeman-Anderson N.E. Zheng Y. McCalla-Martin A.C. Treanor L.M. Zhao Y.D. Garfin P.M. He T.C. Mary M.N. Thornton J.D. Anderson C. Gibbons M. Saab R. Baumer S.H. Cunningham J.M. Skapek S.X. Development. 2009; 136: 2081-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), thereby providing a model system to further investigate mechanisms. Members of the Tgfβ superfamily frequently modulate the transcription of key target genes through Smad proteins, which directly transduce Tgfβ receptor activation to the nucleus. In addition, Smad-independent signaling through p38 MAPK, ERK, PI3K/Akt, and JNK provide alternative mechanisms of gene activation (16Derynck R. Zhang Y.E. Nature. 2003; 425: 577-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (4292) Google Scholar). In this manuscript we demonstrate that Tgfβ and p19Arf act on cells of the same lineage; that Arf is required for the anti-mitogenic effects of Tgfβ in vivo and that both Smad- and p38 MAPK-dependent mechanisms underlie Arf induction by Tgfβ.

Genesis. 2002; 32: 73-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) were obtained from A. Chytil and H. L. Moses (Vanderbilt University). AC-Tgfβ1 transgenic mice were previously described (20Srinivasan Y. Lovicu F.J. Overbeek P.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 625-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Wnt1-Cre transgenic mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (stock #003829). Primary MEFs from wild type (WT), ArflacZ/lacZ, and Tgfbr2fl/fl mice were obtained and cultivated as previously described (8Zindy F. Quelle D.E. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Animal studies were approved by the University of Chicago Animal Care and Use Committee. Tgfβ1, -2, and -3 and BMP-2 were purchased from R&D Systems, Inc. (Minneapolis, MN). The siRNA targeting Smads 2 and 3, p38 MAPK, and control reagents were from Dharmacon, Inc. (Lafayette, CO). Anisomycin, SB203580, SP600125, U0126, and LY294002 (EMD Chemicals Inc; Gibbstown, NJ) and SB431542 (Tocris Bioscience; Ellisville, MO) were used in some experiments involving MEFs. β-Galactosidase in cultured cells was measured using a commercially available kit (Applied Biosystems; Foster City, CA). Adenovirus vectors encoding red fluorescent protein and Cre recombinase were produced in our laboratory using vectors provided by T. C. He (University of Chicago). Murine stem cell virus-based retrovirus vectors encoding human H-RASV12 were produced in our laboratory using vectors from Addgene (Cambridge, MA). Antibodies used in Western blotting experiments were directed against the following: Smad2/3, phospho-Smad2, phospho-p38 MAPK, phospho-Akt, phospho-p44/42 MAPK, and phospho-JNK (Cell Signaling Technology; Danvers, MA); TβrII and Hsc70 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.; Santa Cruz, CA); p19Arf (Abcam Inc; Cambridge, MA). Female mice pregnant with embryonic day (E) 13.5 litters received BrdU (10 mg/g in PBS) by intraperitoneal injection 4 and 2 h before euthanasia using CO2. Whole embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 4 h at 4 °C and then equilibrated in 20% sucrose overnight at 4 °C. Fixed embryo heads were embedded in TBS Tissue Freezing Media (Fisher) before cryostat sectioning. Hematoxylin- and eosin-staining was performed using 5-μm sections as previously described (2Kamijo T. Zindy F. Roussel M.F. Quelle D.E. Downing J.R. Ashmun R.A. Grosveld G. Sherr C.J.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2424-2433Crossref PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar). For BrdU staining, 5-μm sections were blocked in 10% donkey serum, 0.1% Triton X-100, PBS at room temperature and then stained using sheep α-BrdU polyclonal antibody (1:100, Fitzgerald Industries International; Action, MA) at room temperature for 90 min. The primary antibody was detected with a Dylight 488-conjugated donkey anti-sheep secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA). Sections were mounted in VectaShield mounting media with DAPI (Vector Laboratories, Inc; Burlingame, CA) and visualized using a Leica DM IRB fluorescent microscope at 400× magnification. The fraction of DAPI-positive cells in the vitreous that were BrdU-positive was determined using at least three embryos from two or more different litters. Quantification was verified by two individuals who were blinded to the genotypes. Photomicrographs were obtained using an Optronics camera and MagnaFire 2.1C imaging software (Optronics, Goleta, CA). Early passage wild type and ArflacZ/lacZ MEFs were treated with either Tgfβ1 (5 ng/ml), Tgfβ2 (5 ng/ml), Tgfβ3 (10 ng/ml), or BMP2 (150 ng/ml) or an equivalent volume of vehicle (4 mm HCl) for 1.5–72 h. Arf-null 10T1/2 cells were transduced with Gfp- or Arf-expressing retrovirus as negative and positive controls for Western blotting. In some experiments SB203580 (20 μm), SB431542 (10 μm), SP600125 (10 μm), U0126 (10 μm), and LY 294002 (5 μm) were applied to MEFs for 20 min before Tgfβ2 or vehicle was added to the culture media. In some studies, wild type MEFs or ArflacZ/lacZ MEFs were seeded at 50% confluence in 6- or 12-well plates 24 h before transfection using of siRNA targeting specific genes (or scrambled siRNA as a control) (0.5 μm) using DharmaFECT 2 (Dharmacon) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In some studies, Tgfbr2fl/fl MEFs were infected with adenovirus encoding Cre recombinase or red fluorescent protein as a control for 48 h before exposure to vehicle or Tgfβ2 for Western blotting for p19Arf. In some experiments, early passage wild type MEFs were infected with retrovirus encoding H-RASV12 and treated with SB203580 (20 μm) and SB431542 (10 μm) concurrently. For all studies Western blotting and β-galactosidase assays were performed in wild type and ArflacZ/lacZ MEFs, respectively, as previously described (13Freeman-Anderson N.E. Zheng Y. McCalla-Martin A.C. Treanor L.M. Zhao Y.D. Garfin P.M. He T.C. Mary M.N. Thornton J.D. Anderson C. Gibbons M. Saab R. Baumer S.H. Cunningham J.M. Skapek S.X. Development. 2009; 136: 2081-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Experimental findings were confirmed in at least two independent experiments, with quantitative data from β-galactosidase assays pooled from all representative experiments. As a control for SB203580 activity, the p38 MAPK assay (Cell Signaling Technology) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, phosphorylated p38 MAPK was immunoprecipitated from the corresponding cell lysate, and its activity was determined by in vitro kinase assay measuring phosphorylation of its substrate ATF-2. For ChIP experiments, wild type MEFs (3 × 106/ChIP) were treated with Tgfβ2 (5 ng/ml) or vehicle for 1.5 h or 24 h. Cells were cross-linked and sonicated as previously described (13Freeman-Anderson N.E. Zheng Y. McCalla-Martin A.C. Treanor L.M. Zhao Y.D. Garfin P.M. He T.C. Mary M.N. Thornton J.D. Anderson C.

Development. 2009; 136: 2081-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and then subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-Smad2/3 antibody (sc6033, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-acetylated histone H3 (06-599, Millipore, Billerica, MA), or anti-RNA polymerase II (sc899, Santa Cruz). Goat IgG (AB-108-C, R&D Systems) and rabbit IgG (sc2027, Santa Cruz) were used as negative controls. Protein A/G-Sepharose beads (sc2003, Santa Cruz) were used to collect the protein-chromatin complexes. The beads were washed sequentially with low salt, high salt, LiCl, and TE buffers (Upstate ChIP kit, Millipore) and eluted in 0.1 m NaHCO3, 1% SDS. Cross-linking was reversed by incubation at 67 °C overnight, and the genomic DNA was extracted using Qiagen PCR purification kit. A total of 7% of the precipitated DNA and 1% input DNA was amplified by PCR using primer sets for different regions of Arf (distal, 5′-TTCCAGGCCTTGCCATCTTCCTAT-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGGTCTGGCTGCAGTAAAGTAGCA-3′ (reverse); proximal, 5′-AGATGGGCGTGGAGCAAAGAT-3′ (forward) and 5′-ACTGTGACAAGCGAGGTGAGAA-3′ (reverse); Nedcin (5′-GGTCCTGCTCTGATCCGAAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGGTCGCTCAGGTCCTTACTT-3′ (reverse)). Immunoprecipitated DNA was amplified and quantified using Fast SYBR Green Master mix and the StepOnePlus real-time PCR system (both from Applied Biosystems). Results are pooled from two or three individual experiments. Total RNA extraction and cDNA preparation were accomplished using RNeasy (Qiagen) and Superscript III RT (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed using Fast SYBR Green Master mix and the StepOnePlus real-time PCR system (both from Applied Biosystems). The following gene-specific primers were used: mature Arf transcript, 5′-TTCTTGGTGAAGTTCGTGCGATCC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CGTGAACGTTGCCCATCATCATCA-3′ (reverse); primary Arf transcript, 5′-TGGCCATAGAGGTGAACCCTTCTT-3′ (forward) and 5′-ATCCTGCACCGAGAAAGCACTGAA-3′ (reverse); Gapdh mature transcript, 5′-TCAACAGCAACTCCCACTCTTCCA-3′ (forward) and 5′-ACCCTGTTGCTGTAGCCGTATTCA-3′ (reverse). Results are pooled from three separate experiments. Quantitative data are presented as the mean ± S.D. from three or more representative experiments. Statistical significance (p value <0.05) was calculated using Student's t test. Arf expression is blunted in the developing eyes of Tgfβ2−/− embryos (13Freeman-Anderson N.E. Zheng Y. McCalla-Martin A.C. Treanor L.M. Zhao Y.D. Garfin P.M. He T.C. Mary M.N. Thornton J.D. Anderson C. Gibbons M. Saab R. Baumer S.H. Cunningham J.M. Skapek S.X. Development. 2009; 136: 2081-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and both Arf−/− and Tgfβ2−/− embryos have primary vitreous hyperplasia evident at embryonic day (E) 13.5 (13Freeman-Anderson N.E. Zheng Y. McCalla-Martin A.C. Treanor L.M. Zhao Y.D. Garfin P.M. He T.C. Mary M.N. Thornton J.D. Anderson C. Gibbons M. Saab R. Baumer S.H. Cunningham J.M. Skapek S.X.

EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2803-2814Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These observations imply that Tgfβ2 lies “upstream” of Arf. Furthermore, they are consistent with the idea that p19Arf is required for the anti-proliferative effects of Tgfβ2 in the mouse eye. To formally test this hypothesis, we took advantage of a transgenic mouse line in which Tgfβ1 is expressed from the αA-crystallin promoter (here called AC-Tgfβ1 mice) (20Srinivasan Y. Lovicu F.J. Overbeek P.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 625-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Indeed, previous studies demonstrated that transgenic expression of Tgfβ1 can rescue the Tgfβ2-dependent primary vitreous hyperplasia in E18.5 embryos, although the mechanism for the rescue has not been elucidated (22Zhao S. Overbeek P.A. Dev. Biol. 2001; 237: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This finding coupled with our prior observation that Tgfβ1 can activate the Arf promoter in cultured MEFs in a manner comparable with Tgfβ2 (13Freeman-Anderson N.E. Zheng Y. McCalla-Martin A.C. Treanor L.M. Zhao Y.D. Garfin P.M. He T.C. Mary M.N. Thornton J.D. Anderson C. Gibbons M. Saab R. Baumer S.H. Cunningham J.M. Skapek S.X. Development. 2009; 136: 2081-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) allowed us to explore the epistatic relationship between Tgfβ2 and Arf in vivo. Histological examination of eyes from E13.5 embryos revealed vitreous hyperplasia restricted to the ArfGfp/Gfp and Tgfβ2−/− embryos as compared with their heterozygous littermates (Fig. 1, A and B). Hyperplasia was associated with increased BrdU incorporation in cells in the primary vitreous (Fig. 1, C and D). Ectopic Tgfβ1 blunted the excess proliferation in AC-Tgfβ1+, Tgfβ2−/− embryos as compared with Tgfβ2−/− embryos (Fig. 1D, top panel). In contrast, the Arf−/− defect and deregulated cell proliferation was unchanged in E13.5 AC-Tgfβ1+, Arf−/− embryos at E13.5 (Fig. 1, B and D, bottom panel). Hence, the capacity for Tgfβ1 to arrest proliferation in vivo depends on Arf and illustrates the fact that Tgfβ2 lies upstream of Arf. The fact that some Arf-expressing cells co-express TβrII in the eye (13Freeman-Anderson N.E. Zheng Y. McCalla-Martin A.C. Treanor L.M. Zhao Y.D. Garfin P.M. He T.C. Mary M.N. Thornton J.D. Anderson C. Gibbons M. Saab R. Baumer S.H. Cunningham J.M. Skapek S.X. Development. 2009; 136: 2081-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) indicates that Tgfβ2 might signal directly to cells expressing p19Arf. To further address this, we took advantage of the fact that members of the Sommer laboratory (23Ittner L.M. Wurdak H. Schwerdtfeger K. Kunz T. Ille F. Leveen P. Hjalt T.A. Suter U. Karlsson S. Hafezi F. Born W. Sommer L. J. Biol. 2005; 4: 11Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) previously showed that blocking Tgfβ signals in cells derived from a Wnt1-expressing lineage leads to primary vitreous hyperplasia. This was accomplished by breeding Wnt1-Cre mice into the Tgfβr2fl/fl mouse strain in which exon 4 Tgfbr2 can be conditionally deleted by Cre-mediated recombination (19Chytil A. Magnuson M.A. Wright C.V. Moses H.L. Genesis. 2002; 32: 73-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). We investigated whether primary vitreous hyperplasia would similarly occur in animals in which Arf is inactivated in the same lineage. We accomplished this by breeding Wnt1-Cre mice with animals in which with exon 1β of Arf is flanked by LoxP sites (17Gromley A. Churchman M.L. Zindy F. Sherr C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 6285-6290Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These Arffl/fl animals were previously used with ArfCre/Cre and Pdgfrβfl/fl animals by Gromley et al. (17Gromley A. Churchman M.L. Zindy F. Sherr C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 6285-6290Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) to formally show that conditional deletion of Pdgfrβ anatomically and functionally rescues the postnatal Arf−/− eye phenotype. As a control, we confirmed that Cre promoted recombination in cells populating the primary vitreous by analyzing Wnt1-Cre, Rosa26lacZ/+ mouse embryos. 4S. X. Skapek, unpublished data. Histological examination of eyes from postnatal day (P) 15 Wnt1-Cre, Arffl/fl mice revealed a hyperplastic retrolental mass that was not observed in Wnt1-Cre, Arffl/+ or Arffl/fl littermates (Fig. 2A; additional data not shown). Vitreous hyperplasia was also observed in Wnt1-Cre, Arffl/fl embryos at E13.5 (Fig. 2B), and this correlated with increased BrdU incorporation in these cells (Fig. 2, C and D); both of these findings reflect the phenotype of Arf−/− mice (11McKeller R.N. Fowler J.L. Cunningham J.J. Warner N. Smeyne R.J. Zindy F. Skapek S.X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 3848-3853Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 21Silva R.L. Thornton J.D. Martin A.C. Rehg J.E. Bertwistle D. Zindy F. Skapek S.X. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2803-2814Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This finding demonstrates that the cells that are controlled by p19Arf arise in the Wnt1 expressing neural crest and further supports a model in which Tgfβ directly influences the cells expressing Arf. Having confirmed the functional relationship between these two proteins, we sought to better define the mechanisms by which Tgfβ controls Arf. We took advantage of a cell culture system using early passage MEFs from wild type E14.5 embryos. To understand the kinetics of p19Arf induction, we treated the MEFs with Tgfβ2 for 1.5, 24, and 48 h. In this context, p19Arf protein was minimally increased at 24 h and was significantly higher at 48 h (Fig. 3A), suggesting that p19Arf induction was not an immediate Tgfβ2 response. We also measured the ability of each of the closely related Tgfβ1, -2, and -3 proteins to enhance Arf expression by using MEFs derived from an ArflacZ/lacZ reporter mouse in which the first exon of Arf is replaced by lacZ cDNA (13Freeman-Anderson N.E. Zheng Y. McCalla-Martin A.C. Treanor L.M. Zhao Y.D. Garfin P.M. He T.C. Mary M.N. Thornton J.D. Anderson C. Gibbons M. Saab R. Baumer S.H. Cunningham J.M. Skapek S.X.

ArflacZ/lacZ MEFs derived are functionally Arf−/−, and β-galactosidase expression can be used as a surrogate for Arf promoter activity. Our previous work showed that the time course for β-galactosidase induction by Tgfβ2 parallels that of p19Arf protein (Fig. 3A) (13Freeman-Anderson N.E. Zheng Y. McCalla-Martin A.C. Treanor L.M. Zhao Y.D. Garfin P.M. He T.C. Mary M.N. Thornton J.D. Anderson C. Gibbons M. Saab R. Baumer S.H. Cunningham J.M. Skapek S.X. Development. 2009; 136: 2081-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). All three of the related Tgfβ proteins induced β-galactosidase expression in the MEFs (Fig. 3B, lanes 2, 4, and 6). The relatively small increases in the Arf promoter in ArflacZ/lacZ MEFs as compared with p19Arf induction (compare Fig. 3, A, lanes 5 and 6 to B, lanes 3 and 4) indicated that increased Arf transcription might be complemented by additional, post-transcription effects such as transcript stabilization or increased translation. In contrast, BMP-2, another Tgfβ superfamily member (16Derynck R. Zhang Y.E. Nature. 2003; 425: 577-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (4292) Google Scholar, 24Itoh S. Itoh F. Goumans M.J. Ten Dijke P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6954-6967Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar), failed to induce β-galactosidase (Fig. 3C). These findings suggest that Tgfβ1, -2, or -3 act through the classical pathway involving ALK-5 and TβrII rather than BMP type I receptors (ALK-2, ALK-3, and ALK-6) (16Derynck R. Zhang Y.E. Nature. 2003; 425: 577-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (4292) Google Scholar, 24Itoh S. Itoh F. Goumans M.J. Ten Dijke P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6954-6967Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). We previously showed Arf and TβrII to be co-expressed in some pericyte-like cells in the primary vitreous in the mouse (13Freeman-Anderson N.E. Zheng Y. McCalla-Martin A.C. Treanor L.M. Zhao Y.D. Garfin P.M. He T.C. Mary M.N. Thornton J.D. Anderson C. Gibbons M. Saab R. Baumer S.H. Cunningham J.M. Skapek S.X. Development. 2009; 136: 2081-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To directly confirm the importance of this receptor in Arf gene activation, we used MEFs derived from the above-mentioned Tgfbr2fl/fl mouse. When the MEFs were infected with adenovirus encoding Cre recombinase, TβrII expression fell (Fig. 3D, lanes 3 and 4 versus 1 and 2). Tgfβ2 augmented p19Arf in Tgfbr2fl/fl MEFs when they were infected with control adenovirus encoding red fluorescent protein (Fig. 3D, lane 2 versus lane 1) but not in MEFs in which Cre recombinase had diminished TβrII expression (Fig. 3D, lane 4 versus lane 3). Given the role that Smads 2 and 3 play in response to Tgfβ2, we sought to define the relative importance of these two proteins in Arf regulation. We used gene-specific siRNA to knock down their expression singly and in combination in wild type and ArflacZ/lacZ MEFs (Fig. 4, A and B, top panel; the supplemental figure). Despite the very low Smad3 expression as compared with Smad 2, knockdown of either one impaired Tgfβ2 induction of the native Arf locus and β-galactosidase in wild type and ArflacZ/lacZ MEFs, respectively; interestingly, targeting both proteins further limited Arf induction (Fig. 4, A and B, bottom panel). These findings indicate that Smad2 and -3 cooperatively control Arf induction by Tgfβ2. To investigate whether Smad-independent signals also influence Tgfβ2 induction of p19Arf, we used a panel of chemical inhibitors targeting a variety of pathways recognized to be infl"
https://openalex.org/W2092236331,"The hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis is an integrated hormone network that is essential for maintaining metabolic homeostasis. It has long been known that thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), a central component of the HPT axis, can be made by cells of the immune system; however, the role of immune system TSH remains enigmatic and most studies have viewed it as a cytokine used to regulate immune function. Recent studies now indicate that immune system-derived TSH, in particular, a splice variant of TSHβ that is preferentially made by cells of the immune system, is produced by a subset of hematopoietic cells that traffic to the thyroid. On the basis of these and other findings, we propose the novel hypothesis that the immune system is an active participant in the regulation of basal metabolism. We further speculate that this process plays a critical role during acute and chronic infections and that it contributes to a wide range of chronic inflammatory conditions with links to thyroid dysregulation. This hypothesis, which is amenable to empirical analysis, defines a previously unknown role for the immune system in health and disease, and it provides a dynamic connection between immune-endocrine interactions at the organismic level."
https://openalex.org/W1965369066,"Our previous studies showed that an angled boomerang-shaped structure of the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) fusion domain is critical for virus entry into host cells by membrane fusion. Because the acute angle of ∼105° of the wild-type fusion domain promotes efficient non-leaky membrane fusion, we asked whether different angles would still support fusion and thus facilitate virus entry. Here, we show that the G13A fusion domain mutant produces a new leaky fusion phenotype. The mutant fusion domain structure was solved by NMR spectroscopy in a lipid environment at fusion pH. The mutant adopted a boomerang structure similar to that of wild type but with a shallower kink angle of ∼150°. G13A perturbed the structure of model membranes to a lesser degree than wild type but to a greater degree than non-fusogenic fusion domain mutants. The strength of G13A binding to lipid bilayers was also intermediate between that of wild type and non-fusogenic mutants. These membrane interactions provide a clear link between structure and function of influenza fusion domains: an acute angle is required to promote clean non-leaky fusion suitable for virus entry presumably by interaction of the fusion domain with the transmembrane domain deep in the lipid bilayer. A shallower angle perturbs the bilayer of the target membrane so that it becomes leaky and unable to form a clean fusion pore. Mutants with no fixed boomerang angle interacted with bilayers weakly and did not promote any fusion or membrane perturbation."
https://openalex.org/W1971613578,"Interaction of SIRPα with its ligand, CD47, regulates leukocyte functions, including transmigration, phagocytosis, oxidative burst, and cytokine secretion. Recent progress has provided significant insights into the structural details of the distal IgV domain (D1) of SIRPα. However, the structural roles of proximal IgC domains (D2 and D3) have been largely unstudied. The high degree of conservation of D2 and D3 among members of the SIRP family as well as the propensity of known IgC domains to assemble in cis has led others to hypothesize that SIRPα forms higher order structures on the cell surface. Here we report that SIRPα forms noncovalently linked cis homodimers. Treatment of SIRPα-expressing cells with a membrane-impermeable cross-linker resulted in the formation of SDS-stable SIRPα dimers and oligomers. Biochemical analyses of soluble recombinant extracellular regions of SIRPα, including domain truncation mutants, revealed that each of the three extracellular immunoglobulin loops of SIRPα formed dimers in solution. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments using cells transfected with different affinity-tagged SIRPα molecules revealed that SIRPα forms cis dimers. Interestingly, in cells treated with tunicamycin, SIRPα dimerization but not CD47 binding was inhibited, suggesting that a SIRPα dimer is probably bivalent. Last, we demonstrate robust dimerization of SIRPa in adherent, stimulated human neutrophils. Collectively, these data are consistent with SIRPα being expressed on the cell surface as a functional cis-linked dimer."
https://openalex.org/W1979210580,"At the core of Saccharomyces cerevisiae telomeres is an array of tandem telomeric DNA repeats bound site-specifically by multiple Rap1 molecules. There, Rap1 orchestrates the binding of additional telomere-associated proteins and negatively regulates both telomere fusion and length homeostasis. Using electron microscopy, viscosity, and light scattering measurements, we show that purified Rap1 is a monomer in solution that adopts a ringlike or C shape with a central cavity. Rap1 could orchestrate telomere function by binding multiple telomere array sites through either cooperative or independent mechanisms. To determine the mechanism, we analyze the distribution of Rap1 monomers on defined telomeric DNA arrays. This analysis clearly indicates that Rap1 binds independently to each nonoverlapping site in an array, regardless of the spacing between sites, the total number of sites, the affinity of the sites for Rap1, and over a large concentration range. Previous experiments have not clearly separated the effects of affinity from repeat spacing on telomere function. We clarify these results by testing in vivo the function of defined telomere arrays containing the same Rap1 binding site separated by spacings that were previously defined as low or high activity. We find that Rap1 binding affinity in vitro correlates with the ability of telomeric repeat arrays to regulate telomere length in vivo. We suggest that Rap1 binding to multiple sites in a telomere array does not, by itself, promote formation of a more energetically stabile complex."

https://openalex.org/W1993285211,"The stereospecific oxidative degradation of uric acid to (S)-allantoin was recently shown to proceed via three enzymatic steps. The final conversion is a decarboxylation of the unstable intermediate 2-oxo-4-hydroxy-4-carboxy-5-ureidoimidazoline (OHCU) and is catalyzed by OHCU decarboxylase. Here we present the structures of Klebsiella pneumoniae OHCU decarboxylase in unliganded form and with bound allantoin. These structures provide evidence that ligand binding organizes the active site residues for catalysis. Modeling of the substrate and intermediates provides additional support for this hypothesis. In addition we characterize the steady state kinetics of this enzyme and report the first OHCU decarboxylase inhibitor, allopurinol, a structural isomer of hypoxanthine. This molecule is a competitive inhibitor of K. pneumoniae OHCU decarboxylase with a K(i) of 30 ± 2 μM. Circular dichroism measurements confirm structural observations that this inhibitor disrupts the necessary organization of the active site. Our structural and biochemical studies also provide further insights into the mechanism of catalysis of OHCU decarboxylation."

Pulmonary damage of oxygen toxicity is related to the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In the present study, we investigated the effect of hyperoxia on the production of peroxynitrite in pulmonary artery endothelial cells (PAEC) and mouse lungs. Incubation of PAEC under hyperoxia (95% O2) for 24 h resulted in an increase in peroxynitrite formation. Uric acid, a peroxynitrite scavenger, prevented hyperoxia-induced increase in peroxynitrite. The increase in peroxynitrite formation is accompanied by increases in nitric oxide (NO) release and endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) activity. We have previously reported that association of eNOS with β-actin increases eNOS activity and NO production in lung endothelial cells. To study whether eNOS-β-actin association contributes to increased peroxynitrite production, eNOS-β-actin interaction were inhibited by reducing β-actin availability or by using a synthetic peptide (P326TAT) containing a sequence corresponding to the actin binding site on eNOS.

A LOV/LOV protein (LLP) has been found from Arabidopsis thaliana (AtLLP) as a two LOV domain-containing protein. However, its function remains unknown. We isolated cDNA clones coding for an LLP homolog from tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) and two homologs from the moss Physcomitrella patens. The tomato LLP (SlLLP) contains two LOV domains (LOV1 and LOV2 domains), as in AtLLP. Most of the amino acids required for association with chromophore are conserved in both LOV domains, except that the amino acid at the position equivalent to the cysteine essential for cysteinyl adduct formation is glycine in the LOV1 domain as in AtLLP. When expressed in Escherichia coli, SlLLP binds FMN and undergoes a self-contained photocycle upon irradiation of blue light. Analyses using mutant SlLLPs revealed that SlLLP binds FMN in both LOV domains, although the LOV1 domain does not show spectral changes on irradiation. However, when Gly66 in the LOV1 domain, which is located at the position equivalent to the essential cysteine of LOV domains, is replaced by cysteine, the mutated LOV1 domain shows light-induced spectral changes.

They isolated VTC2 (vitamin C defective 2), VTC2L (VTC2-like), and BLH10A and BLH10B (BEL1-like homeodomain 10 A and B proteins) as interacting proteins in yeast cells.

However, the flavin binding and photochemical properties of the A. thaliana PLP are unclear because the recombinant protein expressed in Escherichia coli did not show absorption spectra of flavin-binding proteins (18Ogura Y.

In this study, we isolate cDNAs coding for PLP homologs from tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) and the moss Physcomitrella patens, and phylogenetic analysis shows that the PAS domains of the homologs, even the PAS domain of A. thaliana PLP, are closely related to the LOV domain. Thus, we propose that the isolated LOV domain-containing protein should be referred to as LOV/LOV protein (LLP), instead of PLP. Here, we analyze chromophore binding and photochemical properties of LLP from S. lycopersicum using wild-type and mutant proteins expressed in E. coli. We also examine both LOV domains of both PpLLPs for FMN binding and photochemical properties. To obtain tomato LLP cDNA, RT-PCR was performed using total RNA from flowers of tomato (S. lycopersicum cv. Micro-Tom). The primers and DNA polymerase used were LLP-S-F and LLP-S-R (supplemental Table S1) and KOD-Plus (Toyobo, Tsuruga, Japan), respectively. The PCR products were inserted into the pGEM-T easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI) after treatment with ExTaq polymerase (Takara, Otsu, Japan) to add dT at the 3′ ends. Two clones were sequenced, and the complete match of the nucleotide sequences was verified between them. The obtained nucleotide sequence has been submitted to GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ Data Bank with accession number AB576162. For protein expression of SlLLP, cDNA of SlLLP was amplified by PCR using the two primers LLP-F and LLP-R (supplemental Table S1). The PCR product was digested with XhoI and NotI and cloned into the XhoI-NotI site of pThioHisA plasmid (Invitrogen), and the resulting plasmid was named pThio-SlLLP. The SlLLP recombinant protein is expressed as a fusion protein with His-Patch thioredoxin at the N terminus and His6 at the C terminus. E. coli JM109 having pRARE2LysS (Novagen, Madison, WI) that supplies tRNAs for rare codons to enhance the expression of eukaryotic proteins was used for the host cell. The transformants, JM109 cells harboring pThio-SlLLP and pRARE2LysS, were grown overnight at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani medium (30 ml) supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg ml−1) and chloramphenicol (30 μg ml−1). The overnight-cultured cells (20 ml in LB medium) were added to M9 medium (1 liter) supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg ml−1) and chloramphenicol (30 μg ml−1) and were grown at 25 °C to an optical density (600 nm) of ∼0.35. Protein expression was carried out for 20 h at 20 or 25 °C in the presence of 1.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, frozen at −80 °C, thawed at 25 °C, and then resuspended in 20 ml of a disruption solution (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 m NaCl, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 20 mm imidazole) with 0.2% (w/v) Tween 60. After sonication for disruption, the cell extract was centrifuged at 35,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was loaded onto a nickel-Sepharose 6 Fast Flow column (1 ml of bed volume; GE Healthcare). The column was washed twice with 10 ml of the disruption solution with 0.2% (w/v) Tween 60, twice with 10 ml of the disruption solution, and then once with 5 ml of the disruption solution with 75 mm imidazole. The protein was eluted with 3 ml of the disruption solution with 200 mm imidazole. The eluate was added to 9 ml of a buffer solution (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) and loaded onto a HiTrapQ column (GE Healthcare). The column was washed with the buffer solution with 0.15 m NaCl, and then the protein was eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (0.15–0.8 m). Mutant versions of pThio-SlLLP were generated by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis (19Higuchi R. Krummel B. Saiki R.K. Nucleic.

The resulting PCR products were mixed and used as templates for next PCR using LLP-F and LLP-R primers. PCRs were performed with KOD-Plus DNA polymerase (Toyobo). The resulting PCR products were cloned into pThioHisA (Invitrogen). pThio-SlLLP-C295A, -R67D, and -R296D were used for protein expression of SlLLP-C295A, -R67D, and -R296D, respectively. To express SlLLP-R67D/R296D, the 5.2- and 0.4-kb MunI-XbaI fragments of pThio-SlLLP-R67D and pThio-SlLLP-R296D, respectively, were ligated. The resulting pThio-SlLLP-R67D/R296D was used for SlLLP-R67D/R296D expression. To express SlLLP-G66C/R296D, the pThio-SlLLP-G66C/R296D plasmid was constructed using mismatch primers (supplemental Table S1) and pThio-SlLLP-R296D as a template. PCR and cloning into the pThioHisA plasmid were performed as described above. For protein expression, cDNAs were amplified by PCR using the two primers listed in supplemental Table S1. The PCR products were digested with EcoRI and XhoI and cloned into the EcoRI-XhoI site of pGEX-6P-1 plasmid (GE Healthcare), and the resulting plasmids were introduced into E. coli Rosetta2 (DE3) pLysS (Novagen, Madison, WI). The transformants were grown overnight at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani medium (10 ml) supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg ml−1) and chloramphenicol (30 μg ml−1). The overnight-cultured cells (4 ml in LB medium) were added to LB medium (0.5 liter) supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg ml−1) and chloramphenicol (30 μg ml−1) and were grown at 25 °C to an optical density (600 nm) of ∼0.5. Protein expression was carried out for 20 h at 20 °C in the presence of 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, frozen at −80 °C, thawed at 25 °C, and then resuspended in 25 ml of a disruption solution (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5% (w/v) glycerol, 0.1 m NaCl, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA) with 0.2% (w/v) Triton X-100. After sonication for disruption, the cell extract was centrifuged at 35,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was loaded onto a glutathione-Sepharose 6 column (0.7 ml of bed volume; GE Healthcare). The column was washed twice with 10 ml of the disruption solution with 0.2% (w/v) Triton X-100 and twice with 10 ml of the disruption solution. The proteins were eluted with the disruption solution with 10 mm glutathione. The nucleotide sequences have been submitted to the GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ Data Bank with accession numbers AB576160 (PpLLP1) and AB576161 (PpLLP2). Absorption spectra for recombinant proteins were obtained using a spectrophotometer (Multispec-1500; Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). For light-induced absorption changes, the samples were irradiated with blue light for 10 s at 600 μmol m−2 s−1, and the spectra were recorded at 25 °C at regular intervals as described in the figure legends. For light-induced absorption changes of SlLLP-R67D, the sample was centrifuged briefly to remove any aggregates from the protein solution before measuring spectra. A high power blue LED (LXHL-LB3C; Phillips Lumileds, CA) was used as a light source for the light irradiation. The fluence rates were measured using a quantum sensor (LI-250A; LI-COR, Lincoln, NE). Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford as described in the instructions accompanying the Bio-Rad protein assay kit with γ-globulin as a standard. To determine the concentration of FMN associated with SlLLP, purified protein samples were denatured by treatment with 1% SDS, and the concentrations of the released FMN were calculated by using a series of FMN standards as described by Christie et al. (2Christie J.M. Salomon M. Nozue K. Wada M. Briggs W.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 8779-8783Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). To examine whether A. thaliana PLP (AtPLP) binds flavin as chromophore and shows a LOV domain photocycle, we tried to produce recombinant protein of AtPLP in E. coli. However, it was difficult to find optimal conditions to express a sufficient amount of the recombinant protein because of its high insolubility and low protein expression level, as was the case in another study (18Ogura Y. Komatsu A. Zikihara K. Nanjo T. Tokutomi S. Wada M. Kiyosue T. J. Plant Res. 2008; 121: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Thus, we decided to try to express homologs of AtPLP in E. coli. Using the amino acid sequence of AtPLP as a query in a BLAST search on a tomato (S. lycopersicum) EST database (MiBASE, Kazusa DNA Research Institute) and the P. patens genome database (JGI), we found one homolog from S. lycopersicum and two homologs from P. patens. The cDNAs coding for the homologs were obtained by RT-PCR and sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequences are shown in Fig. 1A and aligned with AtPLP and the homologous sequence in Oryza sativa (rice), which is from the rice genome database. Approximately 100 amino acids in N- and C-terminal regions showed high similarity (Fig. 1A, underlining). Phylogenetic analysis of those amino acid sequences with various PAS domain sequences clearly showed that all of the sequences including the PAS domain of AtPLP were clustered with LOV domains of phototropins (Fig. 2), as is the case with a former phylogenetic analysis (20Ishikawa M. Takahashi F. Nozaki H. Nagasato C. Motomura T. Kataoka H. Planta. 2009; 230: 543-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Thus, we propose that the isolated LOV domain-containing protein and AtPLP should be referred to as LLP, instead of PLP. The S. lycopersicum homolog is named SlLLP, and the two P. patens homologs are named PpLLP1 and PpLLP2, and the N-terminal and the C-terminal LOV domains are named LOV1 and LOV2 domains, respectively (Fig. 1A). A highly conserved short region was found in the C terminus (Fig. 1A, double underlining).FIGURE 2Phylogenetic tree of LOV domain sequences of LLPs with PAS domain superfamily sequences. The tree was constructed by the NJ method after ClustalX alignment of the amino acid sequences of LOV domains of LLPs and PAS domains. Bootstrap values in the NJ analysis were carried out based on 1,000 replications using ClustalX. Bootstrap values higher than 50% are shown for each clade. The scale indicates 0.1 nucleotide substitutions/site. PAS domain sequences were collected from the PF00989 family of the Pfam protein families database (28Finn R.D. Mistry J. Tate J. Coggill P. Heger A. Pollington J.E. Gavin O.L. Gunasekaran P. Ceric G. Forslund K. Holm L. Sonnhammer E.L. Eddy S.R. Bateman A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: D211-D222Crossref PubMed Scopus (2484) Google Scholar). LOV domain sequences were used from phototropin 1 (PHOT1) of A. thaliana (ARATH), phototropin A1 and B1 (PHOTA1 and PHOTB1) of P. patens (PHYPA), and LLPs of S. lycopersicum (SOLLY), A. thaliana (ARATH), and P. patens (PHYPA).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fig. 1B compares the amino acid sequences of the LOV1 and LOV2 domains of LLPs with those of the LOV domains of A. thaliana phototropin 1 (Fig. 1B). Most of the conserved amino acids that are associated with flavin binding (21Crosson S. Moffat K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 2995-3000Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar) are conserved in both LOV domains of LLPs (asterisks in Fig. 1B). However, the amino acids at the position of the cysteine that is essential for photoproduct formation in LOV domains are different in the LOV1 domains of A. thaliana (glycine), O. sativa (alanine), and S. lycopersicum (glycine) LLPs (Fig. 1, A, open arrowhead, and B, arrowhead). To characterize the properties of flavin binding and photocycle of SlLLP, a fusion protein of SlLLP with His-Patch thioredoxin at the N terminus and His6 at the C terminus was expressed in E. coli. The His-Patch thioredoxin and His6 were fused to facilitate the purification of the fusion protein by affinity chromatography on a nickel-agarose column. The SlLLP was purified to near homogeneity by affinity chromatography and anion exchange chromatography (Fig. 3A, arrowhead). The estimated molecular mass (56.4 kDa) by SDS-PAGE was in agreement with the theoretical values (58.8 kDa) from the amino acid sequences. The 56.4-kDa polypeptide was recognized by both anti-thioredoxin and anti-His6 antibodies (data not shown). Minor lower molecular mass polypeptides (32.9 and 30.0 kDa; Fig. 3A, asterisks) likely result from SlLLP degradation because the polypeptides were recognized by either anti-thioredoxin or anti-His6 antibodies, respectively, but not both (data not shown). The purified SlLLP exhibited features of LOV domains described previously for phototropin and other LOV domain-containing proteins (2Christie J.M. Salomon M. Nozue K. Wada M. Briggs W.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 8779-8783Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar, 4Kasahara M. Swartz T.E. Olney M.A. Onodera A. Mochizuki N. Fukuzawa H. Asamizu E. Tabata S. Kanegae H. Takano M.

Nature. 2003; 426: 302-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar), with absorption peaks in the UV-A and blue regions of the spectra and prominent vibrational bands in the blue (Fig. 3B). The flavin associated with SlLLP was identified as FMN by thin layer chromatography, according to its mobility against standard FAD, FMN, and riboflavin samples (supplemental Fig. S1). The molar ratio of FMN to protein was 0.37 for SlLLP (supplemental Table S2), although it was expected that the molar ratio will become ∼2 because SlLLP contains two LOV domains. Irradiation of SlLLP with strong blue light induced a decrease of absorption in the blue region of flavin absorption (∼450 nm). During a subsequent dark incubation, the blue absorption was restored to the initial state (Fig. 4A). Three isosbestic points present at 322, 388, and 405 nm suggest that the light-induced absorption change is the consequence of FMN-cysteinyl adduct formation (3Salomon M. Christie J.M. Knieb E. Lempert U. Briggs W.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9401-9410Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar), not that of the photoreduction that occurs in many flavoproteins. A mutant SlLLP (SlLLP-C295A) was investigated because Cys295 in LOV2 domain (Fig. 1A, arrowhead) is likely the residue to form the FMN-cysteinyl adduct. The SlLLP-C295A did not exhibit any absorption change on irradiation with strong blue light (Fig. 4B). These properties indicate that an FMN-cysteinyl adduct was formed upon irradiation with blue light in SlLLP, as is the case with the LOV domain of phototropin, and Cys295 in the LOV2 domain of SlLLP is the site of FMN-cysteinyl adduct formation. We noticed that when samples after nickel-Sepharose 6 Fast Flow column, which contain 200 mm imidazole added to elute recombinant protein from the column, were used for analyzing light-induced absorption changes, the half-life of photoproduct became very short compared with samples excluding imidazole by ion exchange chromatography. Fig. 5 shows the effect of imidazole on the rate of dark reversion of photoproduct. The half-lives of photoproduct under conditions with and without imidazole were 61.4 s and 65.4 min, respectively (Fig. 5). The rate of dark reversion became ∼64-fold faster in the presence of imidazole. The imidazole-dependent acceleration of dark reversion was also seen in cyanobacterial LOV domains (22Narikawa R. Zikihara K. Okajima K. Ochiai Y. Katayama M. Shichida Y. Tokutomi S. Ikeuchi M. Photochem. Photobiol. 2006; 82: 1627-1633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the LOV2 domain of oat phototropin 1 (23Alexandre M.T. Arents J.C. van Grondelle R. Hellingwerf K.J. Kennis J.T. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 3129-3137Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The loss of light-induced absorption changes by replacement of Cys295 in the LOV2 domain of SlLLP shows that the LOV2 domain is an FMN-binding site. However, it is unclear whether the LOV1 domain binds FMN. To investigate whether the LOV1 domain of SlLLP binds FMN, we constructed a truncated form of SlLLP consisting of the LOV1 domain alone as well as that consisting of the LOV2 domain alone. However, both truncated proteins were expressed as insoluble protein. The full-length polypeptide seems to be required for expression in a soluble form. We tried to express a full-length SlLLP with a point mutation, by which the mutant protein is considered to dissociate FMN from the LOV2 domain, so that the potential flavin binding site remaining in the mutant protein would be the LOV1 domain. A candidate position of the point mutation was Arg296, next to the indispensable cysteine for photoreaction (Fig. 1B, #), because the arginine next to the cysteine in LOV domains has been shown to interact with the phosphate group of FMN by forming a salt bridge (21Crosson S. Moffat K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 2995-3000Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 24Fedorov R. Schlichting I. Hartmann E. Domratcheva T. Fuhrmann M. Hegemann P. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 2474-2482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), and point mutations of the arginine result in a complete loss of FMN binding (3Salomon M. Christie J.M. Knieb E. Lempert U. Briggs W.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9401-9410Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). The SlLLP-R296D, in which Arg296 was replaced by aspartate, was constructed. Fig. 6A shows the absorption spectrum of the SlLLP-R296D, which was similar to those of LOV domains. However, no absorption change upon blue light irradiation was observed (Fig. 6B). Flavin released from SlLLP-R296D showed the same mobility as standard FMN in a TLC analysis. Thus, FMN is suggested to bind to the LOV1 domain, but the LOV1 domain did not undergo the typical photocycle of LOV domains on the time scale of 0.1 s, probably because the LOV1 domain contains a glycine at the position equivalent to the conserved cysteine essential for FMN-cysteinyl adduct formation in LOV domains (Fig. 1B, arrowhead). Next, we constructed a mutant SlLLP, SlLLP-R67D/R296D, in which Arg67 in the LOV1 domain was replaced by aspartate in addition to the R296D replacement. We expected that the LOV1 domain would fail to bind FMN as a consequence of the R67D mutation because the Arg67 in the LOV1 domain is equivalent to Arg296 in the LOV2 domain (Fig. 1B, #). Fig. 6C shows the absorption spectrum of SlLLP-R67D/R296D. It lacks all but a minor absorption peak in the blue region, showing that SlLLP-R67D/R296D did not bind FMN, and the R67D replacement resulted in a loss of FMN binding. This result indicates that the LOV1 domain in SlLLP binds FMN. We constructed a mutant SlLLP, SlLLP-G66C/R296D, in which Gly66 in the LOV1 domain (Fig. 1A, open arrowhead) was replaced by cysteine in the R296D background. We expected that the G66C replacement might generate LOV domain photochemistry for the LOV1 domain because Gly66 is located at the position corresponding to the cysteine essential for photochemistry in the LOV domain. The absorption spectrum of SlLLP-G66C/R296D was similar to that of SlLLP-R296D (Fig. 6, A and D). SlLLP-G66C/R296D showed an absorption change upon blue light irradiation and a subsequent dark recovery (Fig. 6E). Three isosbestic points are present at 343, 384, and 406 nm. The light-induced absorption change is likely the consequence of FMN-cysteinyl adduct formation with the Cys66. The single G66C amino acid replacement confers photochemistry to the LOV1 domain. SlLLP-R67D, in which Arg67 in the LOV1 domain was replaced by aspartate (Fig. 1B, #), showed the typical spectrum of a LOV domain (Fig. 6F). When measuring light-induced absorption changes and dark recovery of SlLLP-R67D, we observed aggregation in the protein solution. To reduce and remove the aggregation, 5% (w/v) glycerol was added to the protein solution, and the protein solution was centrifuged before measuring each time spectrum. Fig. 6G shows the absorption change upon irradiation of blue light and subsequent dark recovery of SlLLP-R67D. The absorption decrease was not restored to the initial state (Fig. 6G), probably because of the removal of the aggregated protein and the consequent decrease in the concentration of SlLLP-R67D. When each absorption spectrum was expanded to have the same absorbance at 405 nm (one of the isosbestic points of SlLLP), spectral changes of SlLLP-R67D became similar to those of wild-type SlLLP (compare Figs. 4A and 6H). The absorbances at 450 nm of SlLLP-R67D and wild-type SlLLP were decreased to 33 and 49% of those of the initial non-light-irradiated forms, respectively (Figs. 4A and 6H), showing that the relative amount of FMN involved in the light-induced absorption change in SlLLP-R67D is higher than that in wild-type SlLLP. The replacement of Arg67 resulted in dissociation of FMN bound to the LOV1 domain and increased in the relative amount of FMN able to form the FMN-cysteinyl adduct in SlLLP-R67D. This result also shows that the LOV1 domain in SlLLP binds FMN. To characterize the properties of flavin binding and photocycle of PpLLP1 and PpLLP2, the full-length proteins and each of the four LOV domains were expressed in E. coli as GST fusion proteins. Full-length PpLLP1 and PpLLP2 and LOV domains of PpLLP1 (PpLLP1LOV1 and PpLLP1LOV2) and PpLLP2 (PpLLP2LOV1 and PpLLP2LOV2) were purified by affinity chromatography. FMN was detected by a thin layer chromatography from PpLLP1 and PpLLP2 (supplemental Fig. S1). Fig. 7 shows absorption spectra and spectral changes upon blue light irradiation. All of the purified recombinant proteins exhibited spectral features of LOV domain-containing protein, i.e. absorption peaks in the UV-A and blue regions, light-induced absorption change, and having three isosbestic points during the absorption change (Fig. 7). Semilogarithmic plots for photoproduct remaining versus time after a light exposure (dark incubation time) were nearly log-linear for the single LOV domain proteins (Fig. 8), indicating that regeneration of the dark form is first order. The rate constants of dark recovery for PpLLP1 LOV1 and LOV2 were 3.5 and 6.9 × 10−2 min−1, and those for PpLLP2 LOV1 and LOV2 were 33 and 3.9 × 10−2 min−1, respectively. The dark recovery of the LOV1 domain is faster than that of the LOV2 domain in both PpLLP1 and PpLLP2. The dark recovery of the full-length LLP1 was slower than that of the LLP2.FIGURE 8Reaction kinetics for the dark recovery of the light-activated full-length and LOV domain proteins from PpLLP1 and PpLLP2. The kinetic data were obtained by following the absorption changes at 450 nm in Fig. 7.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In this study, we demonstrate that LLPs are plant flavoproteins that undergo the typical photocycle of other LOV domain-containing proteins such as phototropins. Although the physiological function of LLPs remain unknown, homologous sequences have been found from A. thaliana, S. lycopersicum, O. sativa, and P. patens (as shown in Fig. 1A) and also from poplar (Populus trichocarpa), grapevine (Vitis vinifera), and the spikemoss Selaginella moellendorffii in their complete genome sequences by BLAST search (supplemental Fig. S2). When compared with amino acid sequences of LLPs from flowering plants and P. patens, not only the LOV domains but also the intervening sequences between LOV1 and LOV2 domains and the C-terminal extensions outside of LOV2 domains show significant similarities. This sequence conservation suggests that LLPs of flowering plants and P. patens are evolutionarily related. The amino acid at the position equivalent to the essential cysteine in the LOV1 domain of angiosperm LLPs is glycine or alanine, whereas that of the moss P. patens LLPs and the spikemoss S. moellendorffii LLP is cysteine (Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. S2). The cysteine in the LOV1 domain seems to be lost in the evolution from spikemoss to angiosperm. The wide distribution implies that LLP may play a role in common physiological responses of plants. A. thaliana LLP was first described in a review by Crosson et al. (17Crosson S. Rajagopal S. Moffat K. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), referred to as PLP, and has been so far referred to as PLP in several studies (1Christie J.M. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2007; 58: 21-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar, 18Ogura Y. Komatsu A. Zikihara K. Nanjo T. Tokutomi S. Wada M. Kiyosue T. J. Plant Res. 2008; 121: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 25Ogura Y. Tokutomi S. Wada M. Kiyosue T. Plant Signal Behav. 2008; 3: 966-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Because LOV domains are members of the large and diverse superfamily of PAS domains (2Christie J.M. Salomon M. Nozue K. Wada M. Briggs W.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 8779-8783Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar), the amino acid sequences of PAS and LOV domains resemble each other. In the case of A. thaliana LLP, the essential cysteine for photochemical reaction of LOV domains is not conserved in the LOV1, so that the N-terminal domain is recognized only as a PAS domain. However, a phylogenetic analysis clearly shows that the N-terminal domains of A. thaliana and S. lycopersicum LLPs are more closely related to LOV domains of phototropins than to PAS domains (Fig. 2). Thus, we propose that the N-terminal domains should be classified as LOV domains. Only one amino acid replacement (G66C) restored LOV domain-like photochemistry in the LOV1 domain of SlLLP. Amino acids required for the photochemical reaction have been maintained even in the absence of the cysteine. This fact suggests that LOV1 domains of angiosperm LLPs may have lacked the cysteine during their evolution. The LOV1 domains of A. thaliana phototropin 1 and 2 are proposed to function as a dimerization site for the phototropins (26Katsura H. Zikihara K. Okajima K. Yoshihara S. Tokutomi S. FEBS Lett. 2009; 583: 526-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the dimer formation is light-independent (26Katsura H. Zikihara K. Okajima K. Yoshihara S. Tokutomi S. FEBS Lett. 2009; 583: 526-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Therefore, a photochemical function of LOV1 domains may not be necessary to allow them to undergo protein-protein interaction. Although the LOV1 domain of SlLLP does not show any light-induced spectral change, FMN binding in the LOV1 domain might be required to keep the proper three-dimensional structure for its dimerization function. The molar ratio of FMN to protein for wild-type SlLLP was 0.37 (supplemental Table S2), although we expected that it would become ∼2 because SlLLP contains two LOV domains. In addition to SlLLP, all of the SlLLP variants and all proteins derived from PpLLP1 and PpLLP2 showed low molar ratios compared with the value expected from the number of LOV domain having the potential FMN binding in each protein (supplemental Tables S2 and S3). However, the measured ratios of the proteins containing one potential FMN-binding LOV domain become roughly half of those containing two potential domains (supplemental Tables S2 and S3). In the case of phototropins, it has been shown that the ratios are 0.6 to 1.0 for single and 1.2 to 2.1 for double LOV domain-containing proteins (2Christie J.M. Salomon M. Nozue K. Wada M. Briggs W.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 8779-8783Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). The low ratios could be due to low affinity of LOV domains of LLPs to FMN, and FMN could be released from the LOV domains during purification. It could also be possible that the capacity of FMN biosynthesis in E. coli cells is not sufficient to provide FMN to all expressed proteins. Although the protein samples used in this study include apoprotein without FMN, properties of FMN binding and light-dependent FMN-cysteinyl adduct formation are probably not affected by the presence of the apoprotein. Imidazole accelerates the rate of dark reversion of SlLLP (Fig. 5). The imidazole-dependent acceleration was also observed in PpLLP1 and PpLLP2 (supplemental Fig. S3). Alexandre et al. (23Alexandre M.T. Arents J.C. van Grondelle R. Hellingwerf K.J. Kennis J.T. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 3129-3137Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) have shown that, using LOV domains of phototropins, imidazole acts as base and catalyzes the dark reversion via abstraction of the proton from N5 position of the FMN-cysteinyl adduct. In LLPs, imidazole probably acts through the same mechanisms. The authors also suggest that a histidine can be involved in the tuning of the rate of dark reversion via a hydrogen bonding network from a surface-exposed histidine because of the absence of a histidine in the vicinity of FMN chromophore in Avena sativa PHOT1 LOV2 used for their experiments (23Alexandre M.T. Arents J.C. van Grondelle R. Hellingwerf K.J. Kennis J.T. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 3129-3137Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The histidines of LLPs (His340 of SlLLP, His370 of PpLLP1, and His383 of PpLLP2), which are located at the positions equivalent to the above-mentioned surface-exposed histidine of A. sativa PHOT1 LOV2, could act as intrinsic base catalysts via a hydrogen bonding network. On the other hand, the histidine is not conserved even in the LOV domains that have been already recognized the imidazole-dependent acceleration of dark reversion: Chlamydomonas reinhardtii PHOT LOV2 (23Alexandre M.T. Arents J.C. van Grondelle R. Hellingwerf K.J. Kennis J.T. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 3129-3137Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and cyanobacterial LOVs (All2875-LOV and Alr3170-LOV) (22Narikawa R. Zikihara K. Okajima K. Ochiai Y. Katayama M. Shichida Y. Tokutomi S. Ikeuchi M. Photochem. Photobiol. 2006; 82: 1627-1633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The imidazole-dependent acceleration may not be related to the presence of an intrinsic histidine involved in the dark reversion. Ogura et al. (18Ogura Y. Komatsu A. Zikihara K. Nanjo T. Tokutomi S. Wada M. Kiyosue T. J. Plant Res. 2008; 121: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) have shown that AtLLP interacts with VTC2, VTC2L, BLH10A, and BLH10B in yeast two-hybrid systems. The interactions with VTC2L, BLH10A, and BLH10B are specifically diminished by blue light irradiation in yeast cells, suggesting that LLP may function as a photoreceptor (18Ogura Y. Komatsu A. Zikihara K. Nanjo T. Tokutomi S. Wada M. Kiyosue T. J. Plant Res. 2008; 121: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The LOV2 domain of A. thaliana phototropin 2 binds to its C-terminal Ser/Thr kinase domain in the dark and inhibits the kinase activity (27Matsuoka D. Tokutomi S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 13337-13342Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). When irradiated with light, LOV2 domain dissociates from the kinase domain so that the kinase activity is activated (27Matsuoka D. Tokutomi S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Because LLPs do not contain effector domains in themselves, unlike phototropins, binding proteins such as those mentioned above may be working as effectors. The photochemical properties of LLPs shown in this study indicate that LLP family proteins have the potential to function in light perception. As a next step, it is important to elucidate the biological function of LLPs. Making gene disruptions of P. patens and studying phenotypes of the gene disruptants may reveal their possible photoreceptor roles.

https://openalex.org/W2032378988,"How cell morphology and the cell cycle are coordinately regulated is a fundamental subject in cell biology. In fission yeast, 2 germinal center kinases (GCKs), Sid1 and Nak1, play an essential role in septation/cytokinesis and cell separation/cell polarity control, respectively, as components of the septation initiation network (SIN) and the morphogenesis Orb6 network (MOR). Here we show that a third GCK, Ppk11, is also required for efficient cell separation particularly, at a high temperature. Although Ppk11 is not essential for cell division, this kinase plays an auxiliary role in concert with MOR in cell morphogenesis. Ppk11 physically interacts with the MOR component Pmo25 and is localized to the septum, by which Ppk11 is crucial for Pmo25 targeting/accumulation to the septum. The conserved C-terminal WDF motif of Ppk11 is essential for both septum accumulation of Pmo25 and efficient cell separation. In contrast its kinase activity is required only for cell separation. Thus, both interaction of Ppk11 with Pmo25 and Ppk11 kinase activity are critical for efficient cell separation.

The fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe is an excellent model system in which to study this coordinated regulation (for reviews, see Refs. 1Hayles J. Nurse P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

Upon cell division, cortical F-actin moves from the new end, which is newly produced by division, to the old end, which existed in the previous cell cycle; and the cell growth is initiated from only the old end. Upon NETO at about 0.34 of the cell cycle, F-actin localization shifts from the old end to both ends, thereby changing growth polarity from monopolar to bipolar. This growth polarity is maintained during the following interphase. At the onset of mitosis, the cell growth ceases; and the cortical F-actin patches at both ends disappear, having been translocated to the medial ring, which corresponds to the following division site. The onset of cytokinesis is triggered by the septation initiation network (SIN), 4The abbreviations used are: SINseptation initiation networkGCKgerminal center kinaseMBMMO25 binding motifKDkinase domainMORmorphogenesis Orb6 network. analogous to the budding yeast mitotic exit network (MEN), that comprises Spg1 GTPase and a downstream kinase cascade (Cdc7, Sid1, and Sid2; Ref. 6Simanis V.

Genome sequencing shows that fission yeast cells have 3 GCKs, i.e. Sid1, Nak1, and Ppk11. Sid1 and Nak1 are essential for cell growth, and play a critical role in septation/cytokinesis and cell morphogenesis (cell separation and cell polarity control), respectively, as components of SIN and the morphogenesis Orb6 network (MOR) (6Simanis V.

DNA fragments containing the pmo25+:GFP:kanr gene were amplified by PCR from a pmo25+:GFP:kanr strain with the primers containing 5′-extensions with ppk11+-specific DNA sequences and integrated into the ppk11+ locus in WT cells. All plasmids were constructed by using standard molecular biology techniques. In general, gene fragments were cloned as PCR products from genomic DNA with primers containing 5′-extensions with specific restriction sites. The yeast 2-hybrid system was used to detect possible interactions between Ppk11 and MOR components. DNA fragments containing the ppk11+ gene were cloned in frame with the GAL4-DNA binding domain (pGBKT7) and the GAL4-transcription activating domain (pACT2). Interaction was tested in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain Y190 co-transformed with the 2-hybrid plasmids. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by using pJK148-ppk11+ (pTG24) as a template and a QuikChange kit (Stratagene) to introduce the point mutation, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Successful mutagenesis for each mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The mutated ppk11 gene was integrated into the leu1–32 locus of the ppk11-deleted cells. Preparation of whole-cell extracts, immunoprecipitation, and immunoblotting were performed as previously described (25Bähler J. Nurse P.

Protein samples were electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE gels and electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose filters. The primary antibodies, mouse monoclonal anti-GFP (8362–1; Clontech), anti-HA (HA.11; BabCO), anti-Myc (9E10, BabCO), anti-PSTAIRE (sc-53; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti phospho-Cdc2 (Tyr15) (9111S; Cell Signaling Technology), were used for detection of the epitope-tagged proteins, Cdc2, and Cdc2 phosphorylated on its Tyr-15. Immunoprecipitation was done by using anti-HA (HA.11, BabCO) or anti-GFP antibody (Roche), and magnetizable beads conjugated to protein A (Dynabeads, DYNAL). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-rabbit IgG or anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Biosciences) was used as the second antibody. Enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Biosciences) was used to detect bound antibody. Cytological techniques were performed as described previously (9Kanai M. Kume K. Miyahara K. Sakai K.

Calcofluor white (Sigma) was used to monitor cell wall growth, and 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Sigma) and Hoechst 333342 (Calbiochem) were used for observing chromatin regions. For the observation of Ppk11-GFP, the cells expressing Ppk11-GFP were fixed with methanol (−20 °C) for 20 min and washed three times with sterile water. Fixed-cell images were collected with an Axiophot 2 MOT (ZEISS) and AxioCam MRm CCD camera; and the images were further processed with AxioVision software. Live-cell images were collected with an IX70 (OLYMPUS) and DeltaVision sectioning system. GFP intensity was measured with ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health). The genome of fission yeast contains 3 ORFs that encode GCKs Nak1, Sid1, and Ppk11 (Fig. 1A), in which there is a distinct peptide sequence, (v/i)GTPyWMAPEv (a small letter indicates less conservation), termed the Ste20 signature sequence (8Dan I. Watanabe N.M. Kusumi A. Trends Cell. Biol. 2001; 11: 220-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar), in the kinase subdomain VIII (Fig. 1B). Nak1 and Sid1 are essential for cell growth, and their roles have been established as a signaling component of MOR and SIN, respectively. In contrast, the role of Ppk11 remains elusive, though this GCK is known to be non-essential for cell division at least under normal growth conditions (28Bimbó A. Jia Y. Poh S.L. Karuturi R.K. den Elzen N. Peng X. Zheng L. O'Connell M. Liu E.T. Balasubramanian M.K. Liu J. Eukaryot. Cell. 2005; 4: 799-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). To investigate the potential role of Ppk11 in cell division, we examined defective phenotypes of ppk11-deleted (Δppk11) cells at various temperatures (18–36 °C). The growth rates of Δppk11 cells at the lower temperatures (18–30 °C) were indistinguishable from those of wild-type (WT) cells, but its growth rate at the high temperature (36 °C) was reduced by 50% compared with that for the WT cells (data not shown). After incubation at 36 °C for 4 h, the population of monopolar cells in Δppk11 was significantly increased to 50% (data not shown), as previously described (29Koyano T. Kume K. Konishi M. Toda T. Hirata D. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2010; 74: 1129-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In addition, after a prolonged incubation at 36 °C for 12 h, the population of septated cells in Δppk11 was increased by 2-fold (∼40%) compared with that in WT cells (Fig. 2A), indicating that Ppk11 was important for cell separation at the high temperature.FIGURE 2Phenotype of ppk11-deletion mutant and localization of Ppk11. A, wild type (WT, 972), ppk11-deleted (Δppk11, DH1520-1B), and ppk11-kinase dead mutant (ppk11-K35R, TG174-20) cells grown in YPD medium at 25 °C were shifted to 36 °C and incubated for 12 h. Cell morphology was observed by staining with Calcofluor (n > 200 cells). In fission yeast, Calcofluor stains septa most brightly and also stains newly synthesized cell wall in the growing cell end, which can be easily distinguished from the non-growing dark cell end. The data on the frequency of septated cells were analyzed by statistical processing (chi-squared tests). The Δppk11 and ppk11-K35R cells showed significant increases (p < 0.01) in frequency of septated cells. B, cell morphology of ppk11-deletion mutant during the cell cycle. The elutriated early G2 cells were cultured at 30 or 36 °C and taken at the indicated times for observation of morphology and nuclear number. C, Ppk11 protein level during the cell cycle. The elutriated early G2 cells having ppk11+:13Myc:kanr (Ppk11-Myc, TG3-3) were cultured at 30 °C and taken at the indicated times for observation of cell morphology and for immunoblotting. Total cell extracts prepared from the samples of the same cultures were immunoblotted with anti-Myc (for Ppk11-Myc), anti-Cdc2 phosphorylated on its tyrosine-15 (for Cdc2pY15), and PSTAIR (for Cdc2). D, live image of Ppk11-GFP and Sad1-RED during the cell cycle. WT cells having ppk11+:GFP:kanr and sad1+:dsRED:LEU2 (DH1247-4A) grown in YES5 medium at 25 °C were used.

At 36 °C, the onset of mitosis in Δppk11 cells was delayed by 20 min compared with that for WT cells, suggesting that the ppk11-deletion induced a modest G2-delay. Further, separating cells in Δppk11 cells accumulated (27%) after mitosis (open triangles in Fig. 2B), indicating that Ppk11 is required for efficient cell separation at the high temperature. In addition to the defect in cell separation, the transition from monopolar to bipolar in Δppk11 cells was delayed by 20–40 min compared with that in WT cells (green squares in Fig. 2B), indicating that Ppk11 played an important role in NETO progression, as previously suggested (29Koyano T.

To investigate whether the kinase activity of Ppk11 was important for cell separation, we constructed the kinase dead ppk11-K35R mutant, in which the conserved lysine of the ATP binding site in the kinase subdomain II (Fig. 1B) was substituted with arginine, and this ppk11-K35R mutated gene was integrated into the leu1 locus in Δppk11 cells. The ppk11-K35R mutant cells showed septation defects indistinguishable from those of the Δppk11 cells (Fig. 2A), indicating that the kinase activity of Ppk11 was required for efficient cell separation. To examine the protein level of Ppk11 during the cell cycle, we constructed WT cells expressing Ppk11-Myc or Ppk11-GFP under the chromosomal native promoter. These epitope-tagged strains were morphologically normal rods, and the frequency of septated cells was the same as for WT cells, indicating that the tagged proteins were fully functional. The level of Ppk11-Myc protein did not change during the cell cycle (Fig. 2C). Next we observed Ppk11 localization by living cell imaging of Ppk11-GFP with a DeltaVision RT system (note that an SPB marker, Sad1-RED, is also included; Fig. 2D). Interestingly, Ppk11-GFP was localized to the medial region of the cell in post-anaphase (Fig. 2D, upper panels, at 30 min). The localization of Ppk11-GFP to split rings was also observed (Fig. 2D, lower panels). This observation suggests that Ppk11 co-localized to the septa rather than to the contractile actomyosin ring. Upon cell separation, Ppk11-GFP disappeared within 5 min from the new ends of the cells, and no specific localization was evident afterward until the next mitosis. To investigate whether the localization of Ppk11 required SIN function, we examined Ppk11 localization in various SIN kinase mutants (cdc7-24, sid1-239, and sid2-250). In these SIN mutant cells cultured at 36 °C for 4 h, no clear localization of Ppk11 to the medial region in post-anaphase cells was observed (Fig. 3A). This observation is consistent with our foregoing results that suggested Ppk11 to be co-localized with septa rather than with the actomyosin ring, as SIN is required for septum formation. SIN is required for 2 events upon mitotic exit. One is formation of the septum, while the other is constriction of the actomyosin ring, both of which are essential for successful cell division (6Simanis V. J. Cell. Sci. 2003; 116: 4263-4275Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). To distinguish between the two possibilities that activation of SIN is required for Ppk11 localization to the medial region or formation of a functional actomyosin ring is essential, we examined Ppk11 localization in cdc15-140, a ts mutant defective in actomyosin ring assembly but nonetheless in which SIN is activated. As shown in Fig. 3B, no clear localization of Ppk11 to the medial region of the cell was observed (Fig. 3B). This result indicates that the localization of Ppk11 to the medial region requires a proper actomyosin ring assembly and function. To investigate a possible functional relationship between Ppk11 and MOR, we examined the cell morphology of the Δppk11MOR double mutants at the semi-permissive temperature of 33 °C. The percentage of septated cells in the double mutants between Δppk11 and 3 MOR mutants, nak1-125, mor2-786, and orb6-25, was higher than that in each single mutant (Fig. 4A), indicating that Ppk11 plays an auxiliary role in concert with MOR in cell separation. In addition we measured the cell size of septated cells in these double mutants. The roundness (diameter/length, D/L in Fig. 4B) of the Δppk11MOR double mutant was greater than that of the each single MOR mutant (Fig. 4B), indicating that Ppk11 also has an auxiliary role in concert with MOR in cell polarity control. Thus Ppk11 and MOR are functionally related in not only cell separation but also cell polarity control. We have previously shown the interactions among the MOR components by using the yeast 2-hybrid system and co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 5A) (9Kanai M. Kume K. Miyahara K. Sakai K. Nakamura K. Leonhard K. Wiley D.J. Verde F. Toda T. Hirata D. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3012-3025Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To investigate whether Ppk11 interacts with the MOR components, we first performed the yeast 2-hybrid assay between Ppk11 and individual MOR components, Pmo25, Nak1, Orb6, and Mor2. Among these components examined, we detected an interaction, albeit modest, with Pmo25 (Fig. 5B). To substantiate this result, we performed co-immunoprecipitation using a strain expressing Ppk11-HA and Pmo25-GFP from the chromosomal native promoters. As shown in Fig. 5C, Ppk11-HA and Pmo25-GFP did exhibit co-precipitation in a reciprocal fashion. Next we explored co-localization between Ppk11 and Pmo25 in live imaging using a strain containing Ppk11-GFP and Pmo25-tdTomato expressed from each endogenous native promoter (Fig. 5D). As previously shown (9Kanai M. Kume K. Miyahara K. Sakai K. Nakamura K. Leonhard K. Wiley D.J. Verde F. Toda T. Hirata D. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3012-3025Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), Pmo25 was found in 2 SPBs during early mitosis (Fig. 5D, cell at 0 min), 1 SPB during anaphase B (15–35 min), and the medial region (25–45 min) and in both new cell ends upon cell division (60 min). Although Ppk11 was not localized to the mitotic SPB(s), it was localized to the medial region during anaphase B (20–45 min) and both new ends of the cell, indicating partial overlapping localization between Pmo25 and Ppk11. It is noteworthy that Ppk11 appeared to be localized to the medial region slightly earlier than Pmo25 (20–25 min, see below). To investigate whether the localization of Ppk11 is dependent on MOR function, we examined Ppk11 localization in various ts MOR mutants (pmo25-35, nak1-125, mor2-786, and orb6-25). In these MOR mutants cultured at 36 °C for 4 h, clear localization of Ppk11 to the medial region was observed (Fig. 6A), indicating that the localization of Ppk11 to the medial region did not require the MOR components. We next examined conversely whether localization of the MOR components is dependent on Ppk11 function. In Δppk11 cells, Pmo25 was normally localized to the mitotic SPB(s), but the localization of Pmo25 to the medial region was substantially compromised (Fig. 6B, Pmo25-GFP). On the other hand, other MOR components, Nak1, Mor2, and Orb6, in Δppk11 cells were all localized normally (Fig. 6B). To quantify Pmo25 accumulation at the septum, we compared the intensity of the Pmo25-GFP localized to the septum between WT and Δppk11 cells in the same visual field. To distinguish Pmo25-GFP signals from WT and Δppk11 cells, we mixed 2 strains, one being WT cells expressing both Pmo25-GFP and Crn1-tdTomato, and the other, Δppk11 cells expressing only Pmo25-GFP. Quantification of the septum-localized Pmo25-GFP signals in the same visual field indicated that, as expected, the Pmo25-GFP intensity in the medial region of Δppk11 cells was decreased to 25% compared with that for the WT (Fig. 6C). The total amount of Pmo25-GFP protein in the Δppk11 cells was the same as that in the WT cells (data not shown). These results indicate that Ppk11 is required for accumulation of Pmo25 at the septum. The C-terminal Trp-Glu-Phe residues (WEF motif) of STRAD bind to MO25, and mutations of these residues abolish this interaction (18Boudeau J. Baas A.F. Deak M. Morrice N.A. Kieloch A. Schutkowski M.

Prescott A.R. van Aalten D.M. Alessi D.R. J. Cell. Sci. 2004; 117: 6365-6375Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). We searched for a similar sequence in GCKs and found that the GCKs functionally related to MO25 possess the MO25 binding motif (MBM) at their C-terminal regulatory regions (Figs. 1A and 7A). To investigate whether the C-terminal WDF motif of Ppk11 is important for Ppk11 function, we constructed the ppk11Δ8 mutant, in which 8 residues from the C terminus, containing the MBM (WDF), was truncated, and examined the mutant phenotype (the frequency of septated cells; Fig. 7B, top), localization of the Ppk11Δ8-GFP protein to the septum (Fig. 7B, middle), and localization of Pmo25-GFP to the septum in the ppk11Δ8 mutant (Fig. 7B, bottom). As before, to investigate septum localization of Ppk11Δ8-GFP, we mixed 2 strains, WT cells expressing both Ppk11-GFP and Crn1-tdTomato and the mutant cells expressing only the Ppk11Δ8-GFP, and quantified GFP signals in the same field (Fig. 7B, middle). In a similar way, to investigate septum localization of Pmo25-GFP in the ppk11Δ8 mutant, we used 2 strains, WT cells expressing both Pmo25-GFP and Crn1-tdTomato and the mutant cells only expressing Pmo25-GFP (Fig. 7B, bottom). The ppk11Δ8 mutant showed the defective cell separation (the increase in septated cells; Fig. 7B, top); and on this mutant background, the accumulation of Pmo25 to the septum decreased to 31% compared with that in WT cells (Fig. 7B, bottom), indicating that the WDF motif of Ppk11 was important for not only efficient cell separation but also accumulation of Pmo25 to the septum. The septum localization of the Ppk11Δ8 mutant protein was also slightly reduced compared with that of the Ppk11-wt protein (Fig. 7B, middle), though the amount of Ppk11Δ8 mutant protein was indistinguishable from that of the Ppk11 wild-type protein (data not shown), suggesting that the C-terminal 8 residues of Ppk11 was partially important for its own localization to the septum. To confirm the role of the WDF motif in Ppk11 function, we constructed the ppk11-WDF/AAA mutant, in which the residues WDF were substituted with alanines. The ppk11-WDF/AAA mutant cells showed defects in both cell separation and the accumulation of Pmo25 to the septum (Fig. 7B, top and bottom). Indeed, the interaction of Ppk11 with Pmo25 was abolished by the WDF/AAA mutation in the yeast 2-hybrid assay (Fig. 5B). If the WDF motif is essential for both its interaction with Pmo25 and accumulation of Pmo25 to the septum, the requirement of the WDF motif would be bypassed by the fusion of Pmo25 to Ppk11Δ8. To address this point, we constructed the ppk11Δ8-pmo25+ strain, in which the ppk11Δ8 gene (WDF-less, see above) was fused in-frame with pmo25+. As expected, defects in both cell separation and accumulation of Pmo25 to the septum in the ppk11Δ8 mutant cells were rescued by the Pmo25 fusion (Fig. 7B, compare ppk11Δ8 and ppk11Δ8-pmo25+). Like Pmo25, the Ppk11Δ8-Pmo25 fusion protein was localized normally to the mitotic SPB(s) and the septum (Fig. 7C). These results indicate that the major, if not sole, role of the WDF motif of Ppk11 lies in the interaction with Pmo25, thereby accumulating/targeting this protein to the septum site. Finally we examined whether the kinase activity of Ppk11 is essential for accumulation of Pmo25 at the septum. In the ppk11-K35R mutant, the septum localization of Pmo25-GFP was slightly reduced but localized at a relatively normal level (78% of that in wt cells, Fig. 7B), suggesting that the kinase activity of Ppk11 was not essential for accumulation of Pmo25 to the septum. GCKs play pivotal roles in various aspects of cell signaling in eukaryotes, and normally constitute kinase cascades like MAPK pathways (7Daniels R.H. Bokoch G.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 350-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 8Dan I. Watanabe N.M. Kusumi A. Trends Cell. Biol. 2001; 11: 220-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). Fission yeast contains 3 GCKs and previous work including our laboratory shows that Sid1 and Nak1 are components of SIN and MOR, and play essential roles in septum formation/cytokinesis and cell morphogenesis, respectively (6Simanis V. J. Cell. Sci. 2003; 116: 4263-4275Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 9Kanai M. Kume K. Miyahara K. Sakai K. Nakamura K. Leonhard K. Wiley D.J. Verde F. Toda T. Hirata D. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3012-3025Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In this study, we analyzed the role of the third GCK, Ppk11, in the cell morphogenesis. Ppk11 is not essential for cell growth but is important for efficient cell separation at the high temperature. Ppk11 is localized to the medial region after mitosis, more specifically probably to the septum, as it shows double-ring patterns upon cytokinesis. Localization of Ppk11 to the medial region requires a functional actomyosin ring, rather than SIN activation per se. Like other GCKs, Ppk11 does not exert its function on its own, but instead it acts at least in part with MOR, as this kinase physically interacts with Pmo25, one of the MOR components. Importantly Pmo25 accumulation/targeting to the medial region substantially depends on the Ppk11 protein. The absence of Ppk11 in MOR mutants exaggerates cell morphogenesis defects. These results lead us to conclude that Ppk11 plays an auxiliary but independent function in cell separation and cell polarity control coordinately with MOR. A model for functional interaction between Ppk11 and SIN/MOR in cell morphogenesis is depicted in Fig. 8. Ppk11 was important for efficient cell separation particularly at the high temperature. The Ppk11 kinase dead mutant cells, in which Pmo25 localized to the septum relatively normally, showed a defect in cell separation. These results suggest that Ppk11 protein plays a dual role in cell separation, one as a protein kinase, while the other acts as a structural platform for the Pmo25 accumulation/recruitment, which would contribute to the activation of other MOR component kinases such as Nak1 and Orb6, especially under the high temperature condition (Fig. 8, red dotted line). Consistent with this notion, the localization of Ppk11 to the septum precedes that of Pmo25. We envision that, by interacting with and accumulating Pmo25 to the medial region, Ppk11 is further activated at the site of cytokinesis, thereby in turn activating a downstream substrate(s)/kinase(s) for efficient cell separation. In Δppk11 cells, a certain amount of Pmo25 was still localized at the septum, indicating that Ppk11 per se is not essential for the localization of Pmo25 to the septum. Under a stringent condition such as the high temperature, a larger amount of Pmo25 protein at the septum, mediated by Ppk11, would be important for completion of cell separation through full activation of GCKs Nak1 and Ppk11. The Ppk11 protein level was not changed by the high temperature-shift (data not shown). It is possible that a target molecule(s) of Ppk11 might be induced under the high temperature condition. The partnership between MO25 and GCK appears to be evolutionally conserved among eukaryotes (11Nozaki M. Onishi Y. Togashi S. Miyamoto H. DNA Cell. Biol. 1996; 15: 505-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 12Karos M. Fischer R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1999; 260: 510-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 13Hergovich A. Stegert M.R. Schmitz D. Hemmings B.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 7: 253-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). We showed that in fission yeast Pmo25 physically/functionally interacts with 3 GCKs, i.e. Sid1, Nak1, and Ppk11 (9Kanai M. Kume K. Miyahara K. Sakai K. Nakamura K. Leonhard K. Wiley D.J. Verde F. Toda T. Hirata D. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3012-3025Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 15Kume K. Goshima T. Miyahara K. Toda T. Hirata D. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2007; 71: 615-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). In other organisms, it has been shown that MO25 interacts with just 1 GCK. Our result is thus the first evidence showing the interaction of MO25 with multiple GCKs. The biological significance of this Pmo25 network is still not fully understood. To clarify this point, it would be important for construction of the pmo25 mutant that lacks the ability to interact with GCKs or the double/triple GCK mutants that lack the ability to interact with Pmo25. MO25 physically interacts with GCK and activates downstream kinases. Sid1 and Pmo25 are important for the activities of the downstream kinases Nak1 and Orb6. In the MOR pathway, Pmo25 and Nak1 activate the downstream NDRK Orb6. The identification of a putative downstream kinase of Ppk11, other than Orb6, would be important for understanding a role of Ppk11 in cell morphogenesis. As in general GCK activates NDRK, we searched for a putative downstream NDRK(s) whose deletion exhibits the defect in cell separation similar to that seen in Δppk11 cells. Our homology search indicates that fission yeast has 5 non-essential NDRKs (Orb6-homologous NDRK-like kinases) on the genome that might act together with Ppk11. However, so far we have not found any NDRKs whose deletion results in defective cell separation, at least a single deletion. 5T. Goshima and D. Hirata, unpublished results. It is possible that some of these NDRKs share functions in cell separation in a redundant fashion. Multiple deletions would be necessary to address this point further. GCK Nak1 physically interacts with NDRK Orb6. To identify the downstream kinase of Ppk11, it would be intriguing to search for a kinase(s) that interacts with Ppk11. In the ppk11-WDF/AAA mutant cells the septum localization of Pmo25 decreased significantly to 41% compared with that in WT cells; however, the Ppk11-WDF/AAA mutant protein was localized normally to the septum. This result indicates that the WDF motif of Ppk11 is important for the interaction with Pmo25 but not for the septum localization of Ppk11. A septum-targeting sequence might exist on Ppk11. It would be interesting to identify such a sequence on Ppk11 for the septum localization. Two GCKs, Sid1 and Nak1, also possess a MO25 binding motif (MBM) in their C-terminal regulatory regions. The importance of MBM in these GCKs for their function should be clarified. Further domain analysis should provide us with valuable information on the biological significance of the MO25-GCK network.

We used a combination of molecular biology and whole-cell patch clamp to investigate the functional role of a long N-terminal polyacidic motif (NPAM) in a Cavβ subunit of the human parasite Schistosoma mansoni (βSm), a motif that does not occur in other known Cavβ subunits. When expressed in human embryonic kidney cells stably expressing Cav2.3, βSm accelerates Ca2+/calmodulin-independent inactivation of Cav2.3. Deleting the first 44 amino acids of βSm, a region that includes NPAM, significantly slows the predominant time constant of inactivation (τfast) under conditions that prevent Ca2+/CaM-dependent inactivation (βSm: τfast = 66 ms; βSmΔ2–44: τfast = 111 ms, p < 0.01). Interestingly, deleting the amino acids that are N-terminal to NPAM (2–24 or 2–17) results in faster inactivation than with an intact N terminus (τfast = 42 ms with βSmΔ2–17; τfast = 40 ms with βSmΔ2–24, p < 0.01). This suggests that NPAM is the structural determinant for accelerating Ca2+/calmodulin-independent inactivation. We also created three chimeric subunits that contain the first 44 amino acids of βSm attached to mammalian β1b, β2a, and β3 subunits. For any given mammalian β subunit, inactivation was faster if it contained the N terminus of βSm than if it did not. Co-expression of the mammalian α2δ-1 subunit resulted in doubling of the inactivation rate, but the effects of NPAM persisted. Thus, it appears that the schistosome Cav channel complex has acquired a new function that likely contributes to reducing the amount of Ca2+ that enters the cells in vivo. This feature is of potential interest as a target for new antihelminthics.

This feature is of potential interest as a target for new antihelminthics. The cytoplasmic β subunit of high voltage-activated Ca2+ (Cav) channels targets the pore-forming α1 subunit to the plasma membrane and affects its biophysical phenotype (1Obermair G.J. Tuluc P. Flucher B.E. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2008; 8: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 2Karunasekara Y. Dulhunty A.F. Casarotto M.G. Eur. Biophys. J. 2009; 39: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). An important function of Cavβ subunits is to modulate the inactivation rate of Cav channels. Inactivation of Cav channels is a life-sustaining property that maintains tight control of intracellular levels of Ca2+ (3Morad M. Soldatov N. Cell Calcium. 2005; 38: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). For instance, in neurons, the spatial-temporal dynamics of Ca2+ microdomains, which determine qualitative and quantitative aspects of neurotransmission, depend on the biophysical properties of the Cav channels, such as conductance and inactivation rate as well as the nature of the intracellular buffers (for review, see Ref. 4Rizzuto R. Pozzan T. Physiol. Rev. 2006; 86: 369-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). Invertebrate Cav channels are less well characterized than mammalian Cav channels. However, Cav channels are validated targets widely exploited in pharmacotherapy as well as by naturally occurring toxins (5Twede V.D. Miljanich G. Olivera B.M. Bulaj G. Curr. Opin. Drug Discov. Devel. 2009; 12: 231-239PubMed Google Scholar). Understanding the idiosyncrasies of invertebrate Cav channels could be useful for design of appropriate therapeutic strategies against invertebrate pathogens such as schistosomes. Schistosomes are parasitic flatworms that are the causative agents of schistosomiasis, a tropical disease that affects an estimated 200 million people worldwide. The current drug of choice against schistosomiasis is praziquantel, which affects Ca2+ homeostasis in adult worms (6Doenhoff M.J. Hagan P. Cioli D. Southgate V. Pica-Mattoccia L. Botros S. Coles G. Tchuem Tchuenté L.A. Mbaye A. Engels D. Parasitology. 2009; 136: 1825-1835Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Adults of Schistosoma mansoni express Cav2 and Cav1 orthologues as well as two β subunit subtypes (7Kohn A.B. Lea J. Roberts-Misterly J.M. Anderson P.A. Greenberg R.M. Parasitology. 2001; 123: 489-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 8Kohn A.B. Anderson P.A. Roberts-Misterly J.M. Greenberg R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36873-36876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The modus operandi of the schistosome Cav channels remains largely unknown primarily due to technical challenges in expressing α1 subunits and to fast rundown of Ca2+ currents in native preparations (9Mendonça-Silva D.L. Novozhilova E. Cobbett P.J. Silva C.L. Noël F. Totten M.I. Maule A.G. Day T.A. Parasitology. 2006; 133: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 10Novozhilova E. Kimber M.J. Qian H.

It is expected that these channels would express better in helminthic clonal cell lines as these may have some specific factors that are needed for functional expression of these α1 subunits; to our knowledge these cells lines are not yet available. In contrast, the schistosome cytoplasmic β subunits express robustly in mammalian cells (11Salvador-Recatalà V. Schneider T. Greenberg R.M. BMC Physiol. 2008; 8: 6Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and in Xenopus oocytes (8Kohn A.B. Anderson P.A. Roberts-Misterly J.M. Greenberg R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36873-36876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The less conventional of the two β subunits has unusual structural and functional properties and appears to be involved in the action of praziquantel (8Kohn A.B. Anderson P.A. Roberts-Misterly J.M. Greenberg R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36873-36876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In contrast, less data are available for the more conventional schistosome β subunit, which does not appear to play a role in praziquantel action. This subunit, referred to as βSm heretofore, resembles mammalian β subunits in that it significantly increases current density, modulates steady-state inactivation, and displaces the peak of the voltage-current relationship to the hyperpolarized direction. However, unlike other β subunits, βSm has a long N-terminal poly acidic motif (abbreviated as NPAM herein) of 15 aspartate and glutamate residues that mediates rapid rundown of Cav2.3 currents (11Salvador-Recatalà V. Schneider T. Greenberg R.M. BMC Physiol. 2008; 8: 6Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Although NPAM appears to represent the main difference between schistosome and mammalian β subunits, one has to consider that even very minor differences between ion channel subunits can have major physiological and pharmacological consequences. Indeed, subtle changes are currently exploited in a variety of selective drugs and toxins. For example, pyrethroids, which are commonly used as insecticides, target the voltage-gated Na channels (Nav) of insects but not those of mammals despite the extensive structural and functional similarities between the Nav channels of insects and mammals. Indeed, a single amino acid is responsible for the sensitivity of insect Nav channels to pyrethroid insecticides (12Vais H. Atkinson S. Eldursi N. Devonshire A.L. Williamson M.S. Usherwood P.N. FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 135-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 13Vais H. Williamson M.S. Devonshire A.L. Usherwood P.N. Pest Manag. Sci. 2001; 57: 877-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Similarly, the capability of the other schistosome (variant) β subunit to confer praziquantel sensitivity to an otherwise non-susceptible α1 subunit can be abolished by mutating a single amino acid residue (14Kohn A.B. Roberts-Misterly J.M. Anderson P.A. Khan N. Greenberg R.M. Parasitology. 2003; 127: 349-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In another case the sensitivity of the GABA receptor to ethanol requires a string of 8 amino acids in one of the γ subunits (15Wafford K.A. Burnett D.M. Leidenheimer N.J. Burt D.R. Wang J.B.

By analogy with this latter study, it is reasonable to suppose that the 15-amino acid-long polyacidic motif of the schistosome βSm subunit could serve as a drug target itself or might influence the action of drugs on schistosome Cav channels. Nevertheless, the rationale for our study goes beyond identifying a pharmaceutical target against schistosomes and is geared to obtaining a better understanding of an important player in the physiology of the neuromuscular system of these invertebrates, i.e. Cav channels. These insights will almost certainly be an advantage in the design and/or identification of effective pharmacophores. Because acidic motifs that occur in channel and non-channel proteins bind Ca2+ ions to modulate protein function (16Xiao Q. Prussia A. Yu K. Cui Y.Y. Hartzell H.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2008; 132: 681-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 17Schreiber M. Salkoff L. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 1355-1363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the polyacidic motif in βSm would bind Ca2+ to interfere with Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent inactivation. To this end we recorded Cav2.3 currents in conditions that allow Ca2+/calmodulin-mediated inactivation and in conditions that prevent it. Surprisingly, we found that the effects of NPAM 2The abbreviations used are: NPAMN-terminal polyacidic motifEGFPenhanced green fluorescent proteinBis-Tris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diolVDIvoltage-dependent inactivationBAPTA1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid. on Cav inactivation appear to be Ca2+/calmodulin-independent. Here we show a detailed characterization of the role of NPAM in modulating the inactivation properties of Cav2.3 currents and provide a discussion of how the biophysical modulation of Cav channels by NPAM-containing β subunits, which are found so far only in parasitic trematodes, may contribute to the parasitic mode of life of these species.

Tissue culture dishes were purchased from Corning, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media (DMEM) was purchased from Invitrogen, and poly-l-lysine, ATP, and the calcium phosphate transfection kit were purchased from Sigma. Restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs and oligonucleotide primers were from MWG biotech. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells stably transfected with human Cav2.3d were cultured in DMEM supplemented with l-glutamine, glucose, and 10% fetal bovine serum in a humidified atmosphere (95%) with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells were used for up to 25 passages and were split every 2–4 days. For electrophysiological recordings, cells were seeded in Petri dishes coated with poly-l-lysine, and transfection of β subunits and, in some cases the α2δ-1 subunit (accession number AF286488.1), was performed with calcium phosphate on cells seeded on 60-mm Petri dishes at a confluence of 50–60% using 10 μg of the construct per dish. Using standard methods, we cloned all β subunits into the pXOOM vector (18Jespersen T. Grunnet M. Angelo K. Klaerke D.A. Olesen S.P. Biotechniques. 2002; 32: 536-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), which contains the gene for green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a marker for transfection. Chimeric β subunits were constructed by splicing the N-terminal region of the schistosome βSm (corresponding to amino acids 1–47) to the nearly full-length coding regions of the three mammalian β subunits. The respective portions were amplified from plasmid templates by PCR using GoTaq DNA Polymerase Green Master Mix (Promega) and primers containing appropriate restriction sites. For β1b and β3 chimeras, the forward primer for amplification of βSm (5′-GGGGATCCATGCAATGTTGTCGAGGATATTCA-3′) was designed to correspond to the first 8 amino acids of the sequence and contained a BamHI site at its 5′ end. The βSm reverse primer was designed against amino acids 55–61 and contained a BglII site at its 5′ end (5′-GGAGATCTTTTATAATCATCTTCATCATCT-3′). For the β2a chimeras, the βSm forward primer (5′-GGGGATCCATGCAATGTTGTCGAGGATATTCA-3′) was designed to maintain the palmitoylated cysteine residues found in β2a at positions 3 and 4, thought to be important for the effects of this subunit on inactivation (19Chien A.J. Carr K.M. Shirokov R.E. Rios E. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26465-26468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The portions of the different mammalian β subunits were amplified using subunit-specific primers with a BglII restriction site at the 5′ end of the forward primers and a NotI restriction site at the 5′ end of the reverse primers. For β1b (accession number X61394; amino acids 7–597), the forward primer was 5′-GGAGATCTATGTCCCGGGGCCCTTACCCA-3′; for β2a (accession number M80545; amino acids 9–604), the forward primer was 5′-GGAGATCTTTTATAATCATCTTCATCATCT-3′; and for β3 (accession number M88751; amino acids 5–484), the forward primer was 5′-GGAGATCTTACGTGCCCGGGTTTGAGGAC-3′. The reverse primers were: 5′-GGGCGGCCGCTCAGCGGATGTAGACGCCTTG-3′ (β1b); 5′-GGGCGGCCGCTCATCATTGGCGGATGTATACAT-3′ (β2a); 5′-GGGCGGCCGCTCAGTAGCTGTCCTTAGGCC-3′ (β3). These reverse primers were all designed against the final amino acids and stop codon of the open reading frames. All fragments were amplified using standard PCR conditions (annealing temperature = 50 °C). After cleanup of the reactions over Qiaquik columns (Qiagen), the eluted products were digested with BglII, re-purified, and ligated. A small portion of this ligation mix was used as the template for another amplification of the full-length, chimeric construct using βSm forward and mammalian β subunit reverse primers. This PCR product was gel-purified, digested with BamHI and NotI, and ligated into the BamHI/NotI-digested pXOOM, and this ligation was used to chemically transform Top 10 (Invitrogen)-competent cells. All clones were sequenced, and only those without PCR (or other) errors were used for subsequent experiments. The strategy we used changes amino acid 47 of βSm from Glu to Arg. βSm and βSmΔ2–44 were amplified by PCR using a reverse primer that removed the stop codon at the end of the open reading frame. Amplification with this primer, therefore, allowed for insertion of the β subunit coding region into the pcDNA3-EGFP plasmid (Addgene #13031) such that the β subunits would be tagged with EGFP at the C terminus. HEK cells stably expressing Cav2.3d were transfected with these EGFP-tagged β subunit constructs as previously described. For confocal microscopy experiments, cells were plated onto poly-l-lysine-coated glass-bottomed 35-mm tissue culture dishes (MatTek). Confocal images of the cellular distributions of the EGFP-tagged βSm and its N-deletion mutant βSmΔ2–44 were acquired 24 h after transfection with a spinning disk confocal microscope (Leica) using a 100× oil-immersion objective. Images were acquired using an argon laser (excitation, 488 nm; emission, BP emission filter). Membrane proteins from EGFP-βSm- or EGFP- βSmΔ2–44-transfected HEK cells were extracted using the ProteoJET Membrane Protein Extraction kit (Fermentas) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells were washed and permeabilized and then transferred to microcentrifuge tubes. After centrifugation at 10,000 × gmax, membrane protein extraction buffer was added to the supernatant and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with shaking, then the membrane protein extract was centrifuged at 10,000 × gmax for 15 min at 4 °C to remove debris, and the supernatant was saved at −70 °C for further analysis. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford Assay (Fermentas). Two micrograms of protein were separated on a 4–12% Bis-Tris Nupage gel (Invitrogen) and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Invitrogen). After blocking with TBS, Tween (TBST) plus 5% nonfat dry milk, the blot was incubated in a 1:1000 dilution of anti-GFP rabbit polyclonal antibody (ab-290, Abcam) in TBST plus 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h at room temperature. After washing in TBST, blots were incubated in goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:15,000; Jackson ImmunoResearch), washed, and visualized with Supersignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Scientific Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings were obtained 24–48 h after transfection of the β subunits using an Axopatch 200B (Molecular Devices). Cell capacitances were 10–15 picofarads. Series resistance was compensated by 70%. Voltage pulses from −20 mV to +70 mV were delivered in 5-mV intervals every 5 s from a holding potential of −80 mV. Data were acquired at sampling intervals of 50 μs and filtered at 5 kHz during acquisition. The bath solution contained 10 mm CaCl2 or BaCl2, 160 mm triethylammonium (TEA) chloride, 10 mm HEPES, and 0.1 mm EGTA, pH (TEA-OH) 7.4. Patch pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass and fire-polished before each experiment and had resistances between 1 and 1.5 megaohms. Membrane seals were obtained by applying negative pressure. All experiments were performed at room temperature (22 °C). The pipette solution contained 110 mm cesium methane sulfonate, 10 mm HEPES, 0.5 mm EGTA, and 5 mm Mg2+ATP, pH (CsOH) 7.3. In experiments designed to prevent Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent inactivation, EGTA was replaced with BAPTA (5 mm). In some control experiments, no chelators were added to the pipette solution. Current-voltage relationships were obtained as a first step to ensure that the cell produced viable currents. Maximum amplitude currents were used to estimate the time constants of the fast and slow components of macroscopic inactivation. To estimate the kinetics of macroscopic inactivation, the decaying phases of maximal Ca2+ currents evoked with depolarizing pulses from a holding potential of −80 mV were fitted to a double exponential equation of the form y = y0 + A1 exp(−x/τ1) + A2 exp (−x/τ2), where τ1 and τ2 are the time constants, A1 and A2 are the amplitudes, and y0 is the offset. Some β subunits induce faster inactivation than others. When inactivation was particularly slow, such as when β2a is coexpressed, longer pulses of at least 1 s were used. For consistency, the same portion of the pulse length is shown for all cases. To estimate the kinetics of macroscopic activation, the activating phases of maximal Ca2+ currents evoked with depolarizing pulses from a holding potential of −80 mV were fitted to a single exponential equation of the form y = y0 + A exp(−x/τ). The voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation was determined by plotting the normalized peak current evoked by a depolarizing pulse to elicit the maximum current as a function of the voltage of a preceding 2-s pre-pulse test (between −120 and +20 mV). Currents were normalized with respect to the current elicited from −120 mV. Steady-state inactivation curves were fitted by a Boltzmann function of the form F(V) = Imax/{1 + exp [V0.5 − V)/K]}, where Imax is the maximal current, V is the pre-pulse voltage, K is the slope factor, and V0.5 is the voltage at which inactivation is half-maximal. Data were acquired with an Axopatch 200 B amplifier and Clampex 2.0 software and analyzed with Clampfit 2.0 software (Molecular Devices). Inactivation kinetics analyses were performed with IGOR PRO (WaveMetrics, Lake Oswego, OR). To determine the significance of differences in data, Student's t tests were performed. In the cases where the variances between the two groups being compared were significantly different, the Welch correction was applied. We previously described an unusual, highly acidic domain (NPAM) near the N terminus of the “conventional” Cav βSm subunit from S. mansoni (11Salvador-Recatalà V. Schneider T. Greenberg R.M. BMC Physiol. 2008; 8: 6Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). To test whether the NPAM region in βSm modulates Cav channels in a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent manner, we transfected HEK cells stably expressing Cav2.3 channels with wild type, deleted, or modified β subunits that contain the schistosome NPAM domain and studied how they modulate inactivation of Cav2.3 in conditions that allow or suppress the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent inactivation process. Fig. 1 shows a diagram of the experimental setup. In this set of experiments 5 mm BAPTA was included in the pipette solution to prevent Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent inactivation in Cav2.3 channels, so that inactivation occurs via voltage-dependent inactivation (VDI) only (20Leroy J. Pereverzev A. Vajna R. Qin N. Pfitzer G. Hescheler J. Malécot C.O. Schneider T. Klöckner U. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2003; 18: 841-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 21Liang H. DeMaria C.D.

The subunits tested included native βSm; βSm with the N-terminal 44 amino acids deleted (βSmΔ2–44), and chimeric mammalian β subunits with the N-terminal region of βSm attached to the N terminus. The inactivating portion of the Ca2+ currents was optimally fitted to a bi-exponential function. In these experiments, co-expression of β subunits containing the N terminus of βSm robustly accelerated inactivation kinetics of Ca2+ currents through Cav2.3 channels (Fig. 2A). Both fast and slow components of inactivation were accelerated for all subunits, except for βSm-β1b, which accelerated only the fast component of inactivation with respect to β1b (Fig. 2, B and C). In these experiments 0.5 mm EGTA was included in the pipette solution, a condition that is expected to allow for accumulation of the intracellular Ca2+ necessary for Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent inactivation of Cav2.3 (20Leroy J. Pereverzev A. Vajna R. Qin N. Pfitzer G. Hescheler J. Malécot C.O. Schneider T. Klöckner U. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2003; 18: 841-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 21Liang H. DeMaria C.D. Erickson M.G. Mori M.X. Alseikhan B.A. Yue D.T. Neuron. 2003; 39: 951-960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). In most of these experiments, the addition or deletion of the N terminus of βSm to a β subunit did not significantly alter the rate of inactivation of Cav2.3 currents (Fig. 3A). An exception is βSm-β2a, which accelerated both fast and slow kinetic components of inactivation with respect to β2a (Fig. 3, B and C). Data obtained from whole-cell patch clamp experiments in which no chelators had been added to the patch solution (supplemental Fig. S1) were similar to those obtained with 0.5 mm EGTA in the patch pipette (Fig. 3). Taken together, the data shown in the previous section do not support our initial hypothesis that the acidic motif in the N terminus of βSm modulates the inactivation process mediated by Ca2+/calmodulin. Instead, our data strongly point to the likelihood that the βSm N terminus accelerates the VDI process. To further confirm this finding, we tested the action of the N terminus of βSm on Ba2+ currents, as Ba2+ does not bind calmodulin (22Chao S.H. Suzuki Y. Zysk J.R. Cheung W.Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 1984; 26: 75-82PubMed Google Scholar), and therefore, using Ba2+ as the charge carrier is an alternative approach to suppress Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent inactivation. As shown in Fig. 4A, Ba2+ currents also inactivated significantly faster with coexpression of NPAM- containing β subunits than with coexpression of β subunits that did not contain NPAM. When NPAM was attached to βSm, β1b, or β3, it accelerated only the predominant fast component of inactivation (Fig. 4, B and C). When attached to β2a, it modulated both fast and slow components of inactivation as when the combination Ca2+out/BAPTAin was used (compare with Fig. 3). To further assess the role of NPAM on inactivation kinetics of Cav2.3, we plotted the fast and slow time constants of Ba2+ current inactivation as a function of voltage. Fig. 5, left and center panels, shows that inactivation kinetics were weakly dependent on voltage. The addition or deletion of NPAM did not alter the voltage sensitivity of inactivation kinetics. However, the relative weights of the two components of inactivation were modulated by NPAM (Fig. 5, right panels). Specifically, the relative weight of the fast component was significantly augmented (concomitantly with a decrease of the relative weight of the slow inactivating component) in all cases when the coexpressed β subunit contained NPAM. In the case of β3, which increases the fast component of inactivation more than the other β subunits, the addition of NPAM shifted all the weight of the inactivation process toward the fast component (Fig. 5D, right panel).FIGURE 5Voltage dependence of the kinetics of fast and slow components of inactivation for Cav2.3 Ba2+ currents; role of the N terminus of a schistosome β subunit (βSm).

Fast and slow τ values were derived by two-exponential fits of the inactivating portions of Ca2+ currents. Data points represent mean ± S.E. Statistical significance of differences between the means was obtained from unpaired Student's t tests. n = 3–7.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because the α2δ-1 subunit is known to accelerate inactivation of Cav2.3 currents and α2δ-1 subunits are commonly found in high voltage-activated Cav channel complexes in native cells (23Qin N. Olcese R. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 1998; 274: C1324-C1331Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we set out to test the effect of the N terminus of βSm in the presence of an α2δ subunit. Coexpression of rat α2δ-1 doubled the rate of both fast and slow components of inactivation. This effect was more pronounced when co-expressed with βSm, β1b, and β3 than with β2a. However, in the presence of α2δ-1, NPAM-containing β subunits significantly further accelerated inactivation in all cases, except for β2a, where only a minor acceleration was observed (Fig. 6). We next wanted to determine whether the region of βSm N-terminal to NPAM has a role in inactivation. In addition, there remained the possibility that the structural determinants for accelerating inactivation resided in this region rather than in NPAM itself. To this end we generated two additional N-terminal deletion mutants that left NPAM intact: βSmΔ2–17, which lacks the first 17 amino acids, and βSmΔ2–24, which lacks those same amino acids and additionally lacks a short acidic motif at position 18–24 (Fig. 7A). Whole-cell Ba2+ currents were then recorded in the presence of either of these βSm versions. To our surprise, Ba2+ currents inactivated faster with coexpression of either βSmΔ2–17 or βSmΔ2–24 than with coexpression of the full βSm (Fig. 7B). Both fast and slow components of inactivation were significantly accelerated by deleting the amino acids that precede NPAM (Fig. 7, C and D). This sugges"

(2004) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 101, 13726–13731). In this study, we found an enzyme involved in the first step of isonitrile metabolism, isonitrile hydratase, that hydrates isonitrile to the corresponding N-substituted formamide. First, we investigated the optimum culture conditions for the production of isonitrile hydratase. The highest enzyme activity was obtained when A. pascens F164 was cultured in a nutrient medium containing N-benzylformamide. This Arthrobacter isonitrile hydratase was purified, characterized, and compared with Pseudomonas putida N19-2 isonitrile hydratase (InhA), which is the sole one reported at present. Arthrobacter isonitrile hydratase was found to have a molecular mass of about 530 kDa and to consist of 12 identical subunits. The apparent Km value for cyclohexyl isocyanide was 0.95 ± 0.05 mm. A. pascens F164 grew and exhibited the isonitrile hydratase and N-substituted formamide deformylase activities when cultured in a medium containing an isonitrile as the sole carbon and nitrogen sources. However, both enzyme activities were not observed on culture in a medium containing glycerol and (NH4)2SO4 as the sole carbon and nitrogen sources, respectively. These findings suggested that the Arthrobacter enzyme is an inducible enzyme, possibly involved in assimilation and/or detoxification of isonitrile. Moreover, gene cloning of the Arthrobacter enzyme revealed no sequence similarity between this enzyme and InhA. Comparison of their properties and features demonstrated that the two enzymes are biochemically, immunologically, and structurally different from each other.

Like nitrile, isonitrile is generally highly toxic and produced in nature, probably for self-defense, by various organisms, including bacteria, fungi, marine sponges, etc. (10Edenborough M.S. Herbert R.B. Natl. Prod. Rep. 1988; 5: 229-245Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Scheuer P.J. Acc. Chem. Res. 1992; 25: 433-439Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar). For example, xanthocillin was first isolated as an isocyano metabolite from Penicillium notatum, and this isonitrile exhibits a wide antibiotic activity spectrum (12Cafieri F. Fattorusso E. Magno S. Santacroce C. Sica D. Tetrahedron. 1973; 29: 4259-4262Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar). There have been many other reports about such naturally occurring isocyanides, but information is quite limited on the metabolism of isonitrile. Some metabolic isonitrile intermediates have been elucidated through incorporation experiments, and we initially reported two enzymes involved in isonitrile metabolism. First, we discovered isonitrile hydratase in Pseudomonas putida N19-2, which catalyzes the hydration of an isonitrile to the corresponding N-substituted formamide (R-NH-CHO) (6Goda M. Hashimoto Y.

It has been approved as a new enzyme by the Nomenclature Committee of the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (NC-IUBMB), EC 4.2.1.103. Next, we discovered N-substituted formamide deformylase in Arthrobacter pascens F164, which catalyzes the hydrolysis of a N-substituted formamide to the corresponding amine (R-NH2) and formic acid (8Fukatsu H. Hashimoto Y. Goda M. Higashibata H. Kobayashi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 13726-13731Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). It has also been approved as a new enzyme by the NC-IUBMB, EC 3.5.1.91. They are novel enzymes that are involved in the metabolism of isonitrile and N-substituted formamide, respectively. These enzymes have provided us with new knowledge about isonitrile metabolism; however, their biochemical properties (e.g. three-dimensional structure and reaction mechanism) have not been clarified in detail. Furthermore, it remains unknown why A. pascens F164 has an isonitrile-metabolizing enzyme. In this study, we discovered a novel isonitrile hydratase in A. pascens F164. Comparative study of the two isonitrile hydratases, this Arthrobacter isonitrile hydratase and InhA, revealed differences in physicochemical properties and structural features between the strains. Arthrobacter isonitrile hydratase is completely different from InhA and thus is a new type of isonitrile hydratase. Cyclohexyl isocyanide and N-cyclohexylformamide were purchased from Fluka Chemie GmbH (Buchs, Switzerland) and Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan), respectively. TOYOPEARL Butyl-650 M was purchased from Tosoh Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). A low molecular weight standard kit was obtained from GE Healthcare. Thyroglobulin and molecular weight markers for molecular mass determination with an AKTA purifier (GE Healthcare) were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries Co., Ltd. (Osaka, Japan), and Oriental Yeast Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan), respectively. All other chemicals used were from commercial sources and were of reagent grade. All the reactions were performed under linear conditions as to protein (∼0.4 mg/ml) and time (10 min). Isonitrile hydratase activity was assayed in a reaction mixture (200 μl) consisting of 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (KPB) (pH 7.5), 40 mm cyclohexyl isocyanide, 10% methanol, and an appropriate amount of enzyme. Methanol was added to enhance the solubility of the substrate. The enzyme activity was not inhibited even in the presence of 10% (v/v) methanol (data not shown). The reaction was carried out at 25 °C for 10 min and stopped by adding a 3-fold volume of cold methanol to the reaction mixture. The amount of N-cyclohexylformamide formed was determined by HPLC with a Shimadzu LC-6A system (Kyoto, Japan) equipped with a Cosmosil 5C18-AR-II column (reversed-phase, 4.6 × 150 mm; Nacalai Tesque, Inc., Kyoto, Japan). The absorbance was measured at 210 nm. The following solvent system was used: 10 mm KH2PO4/H3PO4 buffer (pH 2.5), acetonitrile (2:1 v/v) at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. One unit of isonitrile hydratase activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzed the formation of 1 μmol of N-cyclohexylformamide/min from cyclohexyl isocyanide under the above conditions. The nitrilase activity was assayed under the same conditions as for the isonitrile hydratase assay system, using a nitrile instead of an isonitrile. Also, the reaction product was determined with a gas chromatograph (GC-14BPF; Shimadzu) equipped with a flame ionization detector and a glass column (3.2 mm × 2.1 m) packed with Gaskuropack 56 (80/100% mesh; GL-Science, Tokyo, Japan). One unit of nitrilase activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzed the formation of 1 μmol carboxylic acid/min from the corresponding nitrile under the above conditions. The specific activity is expressed as units/mg of protein. Protein concentrations were determined by the Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 dye binding method of Bradford (13Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar), using dye reagent supplied by Nacalai Tesque Inc. A. pascens F164 was taken from a glycerol stock and then inoculated for the first subculture. The first subculture was carried out at 28 °C for 24 h with reciprocal shaking in a 500-ml shaking flask containing 100 ml of 2YT medium (14Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Then 10 ml of the first subculture was inoculated into a 2-liter shaking flask containing 990 ml of NZCYM medium (14Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) containing N-benzylformamide (NBFA) 3The abbreviation used is: NBFAN-benzylformamide. at a final concentration of 0.05% (w/v). Unless otherwise stated, the above medium containing NBFA was used for the enzyme preparation. The second culture was also performed at 28 °C with reciprocal shaking. After 60 h of incubation, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 10,400 × g at 4 °C and then washed twice with 10 mm KPB (pH 7.5). N-benzylformamide. The culture medium for investigating the role of the Arthrobacter isonitrile hydratase was composed of 0.4% (w/v) glycerol, 0.07% (w/v) (NH4)2SO4, 0.5% (w/v) K2HPO4, 0.5% (w/v) KH2PO4, 0.5% (w/v) MgSO4·7H2O, 0.005% (w/v) FeSO4·7H2O, and 0.1% (v/v) vitamin mixture (6Goda M. Hashimoto Y. Shimizu S. Kobayashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23480-23485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) (pH 7.0). Unless otherwise stated, glycerol and (NH4)2SO4 were used as the sole carbon and nitrogen sources, respectively. The washed cells from 2 liters of culture broth were suspended in 100 ml of 100 mm KPB (pH 7.5) and then disrupted by sonication at 200 watts for 10 min/10 ml with an Insonator model 201 m (Kubota, Tokyo, Japan). The cell debris was removed by centrifugation. The resulting supernatant solution was fractionated with ammonium sulfate (20–35% saturation) and then dissolved in 10 mm KPB (pH 7.5), containing 10% saturated ammonium sulfate. The dialyzed solution was applied to a first TOYOPEARL Butyl-650 M column (5.0 × 30 cm) equilibrated with 10 mm KPB (pH 7.5) containing 10% saturated ammonium sulfate. The enzyme was eluted by lowering the concentration of ammonium sulfate (10% to 0% saturation) in 1.5 liters of the same buffer. The active fractions were combined and precipitated with ammonium sulfate to give 40% saturation. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation and then dissolved in 10 mm KPB (pH 7.5) containing 10% saturated ammonium sulfate. The enzyme solution was put on a second TOYOPEARL Butyl-650 M column (5.0 × 30 cm) equilibrated with 10 mm KPB (pH 7.5) containing 10% saturated ammonium sulfate. The enzyme was eluted by lowering the concentration of ammonium sulfate (10 to 0% saturation) in 1.5 liters of the same buffer. The active fractions were combined and precipitated with ammonium sulfate to give 40% saturation. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation and then dissolved in 10 mm KPB (pH 7.5). The enzyme solution was dialyzed against 10 mm KPB (pH 7.5) and then centrifuged. The homogeneity of the purified protein was confirmed by SDS-PAGE. SDS-PAGE was performed in a 12.5% polyacrylamide slab gel according to Laemmli (15Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). The gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. The molecular mass of the enzyme subunit was determined from the relative mobilities of marker proteins, phosphorylase b (97 kDa), albumin (66 kDa), ovalbumin (45 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (30 kDa), trypsin inhibitor (20.1 kDa), and α-lactalbumin (14.4 kDa). The purified enzyme sample was applied to a Superose 6 HR 10/30 column (GE Healthcare), which was attached to an AKTA purifier (GE Healthcare), and then eluted with 50 mm KPB (pH 7.5) containing 0.15 m KCl at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The absorbance of the effluent was recorded at 280 nm. The molecular mass of the enzyme was calculated from the mobilities of the following standard proteins: thyroglobulin (660 kDa), glutamate dehydrogenase (290 kDa), lactate dehydrogenase (142 kDa), enolase (67 kDa), adenylate kinase (32 kDa), and cytochrome c (12.4 kDa). All glassware was soaked in 2 m HCl overnight and then exhaustively rinsed with distilled water before use. Prior to analysis, the enzyme was dialyzed against 10 mm KPB (pH 7.5). The dialysis had no effect on the enzyme activity (data not shown). The enzyme sample containing 1.6 mg of protein/ml was analyzed with an inductivity coupled radiofrequency plasma spectrometer, Shimadzu ICPS-8100 (27.120 MHz; Kyoto, Japan). The metal contents of the enzyme sample were determined from the calibration curves for standard solutions. CD measurements were carried out with a Jasco spectropolarimeter, model J-720W (Japan Spectroscopic Co., Tokyo), equipped with a thermal incubation system at 20 °C with a 1-mm path length cell. CD spectra were obtained at the protein concentration of 0.2 mg/ml in the far-UV region (200–260 nm). The following isonitrile compounds were examined as to substrate specificity: cyclohexyl isocyanide, benzyl isocyanide, 1-pentyl isocyanide, tert-butyl isocyanide, methyl isocyanoacetate, ethyl isocyanoacetate, and isocyanomethyl phosphonic acid diethyl ether. The levels of the reaction products were determined with the same HPLC system as used under “Enzyme Assay.” The following wavelengths were used for monitoring: 190 nm for N-tert-butylformamide, 192 nm for N-benzylformamide and N-1-pentylformamide, 195 nm for N-formylglycine methyl ester and N-formylglycine ethyl ester, 210 nm for N-cyclohexylformamide, and 230 nm for isocyanomethyl phosphonic acid diethyl ether, respectively. The following nitrile compounds utilized as substrates by nitrilase that exhibited sequence similarity with Arthrobacter isonitrile hydratase (see “Results”) were examined as to substrate specificity: acetonitrile, propionitrile, acrylonitrile, n-butyronitrile, isobutyronitrile, methacrylonitrile, crotononitrile, 2-methylbutyronitrile, benzonitrile, cyclohexane carbonitrile, and 4-cyanopyridine. The levels of the reaction products (acids) were determined with the same GC system as used under “Enzyme Assay.” A female New Zealand White rabbit was immunized four times at 2-week intervals. The first and second injections were performed intradermally with the purified Arthrobacter isonitrile hydratase (500 μg) in Freund's complete adjuvant (BD Biosciences). The booster injection was of 500 μg of antigen homogenized in an equal volume of incomplete adjuvant (BD Biosciences). As for InhA antiserum, InhA was used for injection instead of the Arthrobacter isonitrile hydratase after purification of InhA by the method reported previously (7Goda M. Hashimoto Y. Takase M. Herai S. Iwahara Y. Higashibata H. Kobayashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45860-45865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Western blotting analysis was carried out as described below. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and then electroblotted onto PVDF membranes (Sequi-BlotTM, Bio-Rad). After blocking with 5% (w/v) skim milk, the blots were incubated with rabbit antiserum directed against the purified Arthrobacter isonitrile hydratase or InhA, respectively, at room temperature for 1 h and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA) for 1 h. The immunoreactive proteins were detected with an ECL Western blotting detection kit (GE Healthcare). The partial NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified Arthrobacter isonitrile hydratase was analyzed by means of automated Edman degradation. To determine its internal sequences, the purified enzyme was digested with a lysyl endopeptidase (Wako Pure Chemical Industries Co., Ltd.) or an endoproteinase Asp-N (Takara Bio Inc., Otsu, Japan), respectively. The peptide fragments were sequenced by automated Edman degradation. Escherichia coli DH10B (Invitrogen) was used as the host for pUC plasmids (14Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). E. coli transformants were grown in 2YT medium. Genomic DNA was prepared from A. pascens strain F164 (8Fukatsu H. Hashimoto Y. Goda M. Higashibata H. Kobayashi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 13726-13731Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). An oligonucleotide sense primer (23-mer, 256 variants, 5′-ATGGAYCAYCCNCCNTTYTTYGC-3′) and an antisense primer (20-mer, 48 variants, 5′-ACCATDATRTTRTTRTCYTT-3′) were synthesized based on the NH2-terminal (MDHPKFKA) and internal amino acid (KDNNIMV) sequences of the enzyme, respectively. A reaction mixture (50 μl) comprising 35 ng of genomic DNA, 200 pmol of each primer, and KOD plus DNA polymerase (TOYOBO, Osaka, Japan) was subjected to PCR (94 °C 30 s, 58 °C 30 s, and 72 °C 60 s; 30 cycles), and the amplified DNA fragment (about 300 bp) was gel-purified. The DNA fragment was then used as a probe for Southern hybridization and colony hybridization to clone the full-length Arthrobacter isonitrile hydratase gene. Southern hybridization was carried out by using an Alkphos Direct Labeling and Detection System with CDP-Star (GE Healthcare) according to the procedure recommended by the supplier. Colony hybridization was carried out as follows: recombinant colonies were transferred to a nylon membrane, lysed with denaturing buffer (0.5 m NaOH, 1.5 m NaCl) for 15 min, and then treated with neutralizing buffer (1 m Tris-HCl, 1.5 m NaCl (pH 7.5)) for 5 min and 2× SSC (1× SSC = 0.15 m NaCl, 15 mm sodium citrate) for 15 min, successively. After DNA fixation by UV cross-linking, the membrane was washed in 2× SSC containing 0.1% SDS, and then hybridization was carried out with the same system as used for Southern hybridization. Nucleotides were sequenced by the dideoxy chain terminating method using an Applied Biosystems Prism 310 genetic analyzer. The nucleotide sequence data reported in this paper appear in the DDBJ/GenBank data base under accession number AB573018. We had already found that the isonitrile hydratase was produced in A. pascens F164 when NBFA was added to the culture medium (8Fukatsu H. Hashimoto Y. Goda M. Higashibata H. Kobayashi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 13726-13731Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). When benzyl isocyanide was used as the substrate for the cell-free extracts, we identified the following two metabolites in the reaction mixture: N-benzylformamide and benzylamine (data not shown). We could not determine the exact level of N-substituted formamide formation, because N-substituted formamide deformylase was also formed under the above culture conditions, which degraded the N-substituted formamide (formed from isonitrile by isonitrile hydratase) to the corresponding amine. Thus, we constructed a highly precise assay system for isonitrile hydratase activity. First, we attempted to find a suitable isonitrile that can be degraded by the Arthrobacter isonitrile hydratase whose resultant reaction product cannot be degraded by N-substituted formamide deformylase. In the previous study (8Fukatsu H. Hashimoto Y. Goda M. Higashibata H. Kobayashi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 13726-13731Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), we found that N-substituted formamide deformylase was not able to degrade N-cyclohexylformamide to the corresponding amine. Therefore, we changed the substrate from benzyl isocyanide to cyclohexyl isocyanide and detected the production of N-cyclohexylformamide but no production of cyclohexyl amine (data not shown). These results indicate the successful measurement of the actual isonitrile hydratase activity even in the presence of N-substituted formamide deformylase under the used assay conditions. Using this cell-free extracts assay method, we investigated the optimum culture conditions for Arthrobacter isonitrile hydratase production in this strain. Because we used a minimal medium containing glycerol and N-benzylformamide as the sole carbon and nitrogen sources, respectively, the bacterial growth rate was slow, and the total and specific activities in the cells were low (0.00137 ± 0.00002 units/ml of culture and 0.011 ± 0.0002 units/mg, respectively). At first, we examined the effects of various nutrient media containing NBFA and found that NZCYM medium was the most suitable for the preparation of cells with high enzyme activity (0.00517 ± 0.00097 units/ml of culture and 0.016 ± 0.003 units/mg). Next, we investigated the effects of the following compounds added to the NZCYM medium on the enzyme formation: two isonitriles (i.e. benzyl isocyanide and cyclohexyl isocyanide), NBFA, N-benzylacetamide, and benzylamine. Isonitrile was added to a final concentration of 0.05% (v/v) to the medium and each of the others was added to a final concentration of 0.05% (w/v) to the medium. Benzylamine and N-benzylacetamide did not induce isonitrile hydratase activity (0.00045 ± 0.00005 units/mg and 0.00048 ± 0.00008 units/mg, respectively). Furthermore, we did not obtain a large amount of cells from the culture in the medium containing benzyl isocyanide or cyclohexyl isocyanide at a high concentration (0.05%). However, the highest isonitrile hydratase activity was obtained in the presence of NBFA in the culture medium (0.016 ± 0.0003 units/mg). As for examination of cultivation time, cultivation was carried out in the above medium at 28 °C with shaking. The highest specific activity was observed in the cells grown for 60 h. We established the optimum conditions for the production of isonitrile hydratase by A. pascens F164 (0.0156 ± 0.00005 units/ml of culture and 0.029 ± 0.0001 units/mg); the enzyme activity in the culture broth reached ∼11.4 and 2.6 times higher than that under the initial conditions (0.00137 ± 0.00002 units/ml of culture and 0.011 ± 0.0002 units/mg). Purification of the enzyme was carried out from an extract of cells cultured in the presence of NBFA. Through the purification steps described under “Experimental Procedures,” the enzyme was purified 14.6-fold with a yield of 41.3% (Table 1). The purified enzyme gave only one band on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1), which corresponded to a molecular mass of 43 kDa. Further evidence of the purity of the enzyme preparation was provided by the results of gel filtration on a Superose 6 HR 10/30 column, which gave a single symmetrical protein peak (Fig. 2). The molecular mass of the native enzyme was determined to be 530 kDa by gel filtration chromatography.TABLE 1Purification of Arthrobacter isonitrile hydrataseStepTotal proteinTotal activitySpecific activityYieldmgunitsunits/mg%Cell-free extract75648.4 ± 0.10.0640 ± 0.0014100(NH4)2SO4 (0.20–0.35)16338.3 ± 0.60.235 ± 0.01679.1First Butyl-Toyopearl 650 M35.229.1 ± 1.20.827 ± 0.03960.1Second Butyl-Toyopearl 650 M21.420.0 ± 0.30.935 ± 0.01241.3 Open table in a new tab FIGURE 2Molecular mass determination of the purified isonitrile hydratase.

However, none of these 67 metals was detected within the limits of the assay. The absorption spectrum of the purified enzyme in 10 mm KPB (pH 7.5) showed maximum absorbance at 280 nm; however, no other peak absorption or shoulder was observed (Fig. 3). These findings suggested that no cofactor would bind to the enzyme. The CD spectrum of Arthrobacter isonitrile hydratase was examined (Fig. 4).FIGURE 4CD spectra of Arthrobacter isonitrile hydratase and InhA. Isonitrile hydratase from A. pascens F164 was examined.

The reaction was carried out at 25 °C. After a 10-min incubation, the amounts of residual benzyl isocyanide and N-benzylformamide were determined. The N-benzylformamide formed and the benzyl isocyanide remaining amounted to 1.59 and 3.41 mm, respectively. No formation of other compounds was observed. The results indicated that benzyl isocyanide was stoichiometrically hydrated to N-benzylformamide. The effects of pH and temperature on the enzyme activity were examined. The enzyme exhibited maximum activity at pH 7.3–7.7, as shown in Fig. 5A. As to the effect of pH, the substrate is partly decomposed into N-cyclohexylformamide on spontaneous and chemical (nonenzymatic) reaction under acidic conditions under pH 6.0. Thus, the enzyme activity under pH 6.0 shown in Fig. 5A was calculated from the modified amount of product; we subtracted the amount of N-cyclohexylformamide formed in the control (the reaction mixture without the enzyme) from that in each sample before the calculation. The substrate was stable over pH 6.5. The optimal temperature was 35 °C, and enzyme activity was rapidly lost above 40 °C (Fig. 5B). The substrate was very stable under 50 °C. The stability of the enzyme was examined at various pH values. After the enzyme had been incubated at 25 °C for 30 min in six buffers at a concentration of 100 mm (citrate/KOH buffer (pH 4.0–6.0"
