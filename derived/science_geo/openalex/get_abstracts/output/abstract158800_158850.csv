https://openalex.org/W1504584187,"The cause of Parkinson's disease (PD) is unknown, but epidemiological studies suggest an association with pesticides and other environmental toxins, and biochemical studies implicate a systemic defect in mitochondrial complex I. We report that chronic, systemic inhibition of complex I by the lipophilic pesticide, rotenone, causes highly selective nigrostriatal dopaminergic degeneration that is associated behaviorally with hypokinesia and rigidity. Nigral neurons in rotenone-treated rats accumulate fibrillar cytoplasmic inclusions that contain ubiquitin and α-synuclein. These results indicate that chronic exposure to a common pesticide can reproduce the anatomical, neurochemical, behavioral and neuropathological features of PD."

https://openalex.org/W1557933310,"The endocytosis of AMPA receptors is thought to be important in the expression of long-term depression (LTD) triggered by NMDA receptor activation. Although signaling pathways necessary for LTD induction have been identified, those responsible for the regulated internalization of AMPA receptors are unknown. Here we show that activation of NMDA receptors alone can trigger AMPA receptor endocytosis through calcium influx and activation of the calcium-dependent protein phosphatase calcineurin. A distinct signaling mechanism mediates the AMPA receptor endocytosis stimulated by insulin. These results demonstrate that although multiple signaling pathways can induce AMPA receptor internalization, NMDA receptor activation enhances AMPA receptor endocytosis via a signaling mechanism required for the induction of LTD."
https://openalex.org/W1580261990,"In cricket, a batsman watches a fast bowler's ball come toward him at a high and unpredictable speed, bouncing off ground of uncertain hardness. Although he views the trajectory for little more than half a second, he can accurately judge where and when the ball will reach him. Batsmen's eye movements monitor the moment when the ball is released, make a predictive saccade to the place where they expect it to hit the ground, wait for it to bounce, and follow its trajectory for 100–200 ms after the bounce. We show how information provided by these fixations may allow precise prediction of the ball's timing and placement. Comparing players with different skill levels, we found that a short latency for the first saccade distinguished good from poor batsmen, and that a cricket player's eye movement strategy contributes to his skill in the game."

Each gene product interacts with recombination/DNA repair proteins in pathways that participate in preserving intact chromosome structure. However, it is unclear to what extent such functions specifically suppress breast and ovarian cancer. Here we analyse what is known of BRCA gene function and highlight some unanswered questions in the field."

https://openalex.org/W1507515137,"Internalization of postsynaptic AMPA receptors depresses excitatory transmission, but the underlying dynamics and mechanisms of this process are unclear. Using immunofluorescence and surface biotinylation, we characterized and quantified basal and regulated AMPA receptor endocytosis in cultured hippocampal neurons, in response to synaptic activity, AMPA and insulin. AMPA-induced AMPA receptor internalization is mediated in part by secondary activation of voltage-dependent calcium channels, and in part by ligand binding independent of receptor activation. Although both require dynamin, insulin- and AMPA-induced AMPA receptor internalization are differentially dependent on protein phosphatases and sequence determinants within the cytoplasmic tails of GluR1 and GluR2 subunits. AMPA receptors internalized in response to AMPA stimulation enter a recycling endosome system, whereas those internalized in response to insulin diverge into a distinct compartment. Thus, the molecular mechanisms and intracellular sorting of AMPA receptors are diverse, and depend on the internalizing stimulus."
https://openalex.org/W1590431286,"Improvement after practicing visual texture discrimination does not occur until several hours after practice has ended. We show that this improvement strongly depends on sleep. To specify the process responsible for sleep-related improvement, we compared the effects of 'early' and 'late' sleep, dominated respectively by slow-wave and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Discrimination skills significantly improved over early sleep, improved even more over a whole night's sleep, but did not improve after late sleep alone. These findings suggest that procedural memory formation is prompted by slow-wave sleep-related processes. Late REM sleep may promote memory formation at a second stage, only after periods of early sleep have occurred."
https://openalex.org/W1503588279,"An odor perception is the brain's interpretation of the activation pattern of many peripheral sensory neurons that are differentially sensitive to a wide variety of odors. The sensitivity of these neurons is determined by which of the thousand or so odor receptor proteins they express on their surface. Understanding the odor code thus requires mapping the receptive range of odorant receptors. We have adopted a pharmacological approach that uses a large and diverse pool of odorous compounds to characterize the molecular receptive field of an odor receptor. We found a high specificity for certain molecular features, but high tolerance for others-a strategy that enables the olfactory apparatus to be both highly discriminating, and able to recognize several thousand odorous compounds."
https://openalex.org/W1858802571,"Cerebellar long-term depression (LTD) is a calcium-dependent process in which coincident activity of parallel fiber (PF) and climbing fiber (CF) synapses causes a long-lasting decrease in PF synaptic strength onto Purkinje cells. Here we show that pairing CF activation with bursts of PF activity triggers large (>10 microM) calcium signals in Purkinje cell dendrites. When PFs are densely activated, signals span whole dendritic branchlets and are mediated by voltage-dependent calcium entry. When PFs are sparsely activated, however, signals are restricted to single spines and blocked by metabotropic glutamate receptor antagonists. Single-spine signals and sparse-stimulation LTD are also blocked by thapsigargin, indicating that calcium must be released from stores. Single-spine signals and sparse-stimulation LTD are greatest when PF activation precedes the CF activation within 50-200 ms. This timing rule matches the properties of several forms of motor learning, providing a link between behavior and functional properties of cerebellar synaptic plasticity."

https://openalex.org/W1877112462,"The cellular mechanisms responsible for large miniature currents in some brain synapses remain undefined. In Purkinje cells, we found that large-amplitude miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) were inhibited by ryanodine or by long-term removal of extracellular Ca2+. Two-photon Ca2+ imaging revealed random, ryanodine-sensitive intracellular Ca2+ transients, spatially constrained at putative presynaptic terminals. At high concentration, ryanodine decreased action-potential-evoked rises in intracellular Ca2+. Immuno-localization showed ryanodine receptors in these terminals. Our data suggest that large mIPSCs are multivesicular events regulated by Ca2+ release from ryanodine-sensitive presynaptic Ca2+ stores."
https://openalex.org/W1501755754,"The continuously changing optic flow on the retina provides information about direction of heading and about the three-dimensional structure of the environment. Here we use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to demonstrate that an area in human cortex responds selectively to components of optic flow, such as circular and radial motion. This area is within the region commonly referrred to as V5/MT complex, but is distinct from the part of this region that responds to translation. The functional properties of these two areas of the V5/MT complex are also different; the response to optic flow was obtained only with changing flow stimuli, whereas response to translation occurred during exposure to continuous motion."

https://openalex.org/W2113534068,"A single exposure to an object can produce long-lasting behavioral change. Here, using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we provide evidence for long-lasting changes in cortical activity associated with perceiving and naming objects. In posterior regions, we observed an immediate (30-second) and long-lasting (3-day) decrease in neural activity after brief (200-ms) exposure to nameable and nonsense objects. In addition, slower-developing decreases in left inferior frontal activity were observed concurrently with increases in left insula activity, only for nameable objects. These time-dependent cortical changes may reflect two distinct learning mechanisms: the formation of sparser, yet more object-form-specific, representations in posterior regions, and experience-induced reorganization of the brain circuitry underlying lexical retrieval in anterior regions."

https://openalex.org/W1545480326,"The mammalian circadian clock resides in neurons of the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). Light entrains phase resetting of the clock using the retino-hypothalamic tract, via release of glutamate. Nighttime light exposure causes rapid, transient induction of clock and immediate-early genes implicated in phase-shifting the pacemaker. Here we show that a nighttime light pulse caused phosphorylation of Ser10 in histone H3's tail, in SCN clock cells. The effect of light was specific, and the kinetics of H3 phosphorylation were characteristic of the early response, paralleling c-fos and Per1 induction. Using fos-lacZ transgenic mice, we found that H3 phosphorylation and Fos induction occurRed in the same SCN neurons. Systemic treatment with the GABAB receptor agonist baclofen prevented light-induced c-fos and Per1 expression and H3 phosphorylation, indicating that one signaling pathway governs both events. Our results suggest that dynamic chromatin remodeling in the SCN occurs in response to a physiological stimulus in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W1503082749,"Benzodiazepines (BZs) act on gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptors such as alpha1beta2gamma2 through key residues within the N-terminal region of alpha subunits, to render their sedative and anxiolytic actions. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the BZs' other clinical actions are not known. Here we show that, with low concentrations of GABA, diazepam produces a biphasic potentiation for the alpha1beta2gamma2-receptor channel, with distinct components in the nanomolar and micromolar concentration ranges. Mutations at equivalent residues within the second transmembrane domains (TM2) of alpha, beta and gamma subunits, proven important for the action of other anesthetics, abolish the micromolar, but not the nanomolar component. Converse mutation of the corresponding TM2 residue and a TM3 residue within rho1 subunits confers diazepam sensitivity on homo-oligomeric rho1-receptor channels that are otherwise insensitive to BZs. Thus, specific and distinct residues contribute to a previously unresolved component (micromolar) of diazepam action, indicating that diazepam can modulate the GABAA-receptor channel through two separable mechanisms."

https://openalex.org/W1500633991,"We induced people to experience a false-memory illusion by first asking them to visualize common objects when cued with the corresponding word; on some trials, a photograph of the object was presented 1800 ms after the cue word. We then tested their memory for the photographs. Posterior brain potentials in response to words at encoding were more positive if the corresponding object was later falsely remembered as a photograph. Similar brain potentials during the memory test were more positive for true than for false memories. These results implicate visual imagery in the generation of false memories and provide neural correlates of processing differences between true and false memories."
https://openalex.org/W1522066427,"The limbic system is necessary to associate stimuli with their motivational and emotional significance. The perirhinal cortex is directly connected to this system, and neurons in this region carry signals related to a monkey's progress through visually cued reward schedules. This task manipulates motivation by displaying different visual cues to indicate the amount of work remaining until reward delivery. We asked whether rhinal (that is, entorhinal and perirhinal) cortex is necessary to associate the visual cues with reward schedules. When faced with new visual cues in reward schedules, intact monkeys adjusted their motivation in the schedules, whereas monkeys with rhinal cortex removals failed to do so. Thus, the rhinal cortex is critical for forming associations between visual stimuli and their motivational significance."
https://openalex.org/W1642418647,"No population increases without limit. The processes that prevent this can operate in either a density-dependent way (acting with increasing severity to increase mortality rates or decrease reproductive rates as density increases), a density-independent way, or in both ways simultaneously. However, ecologists disagree for two main reasons about the relative roles and influences that density-dependent and density-independent processes have in determining population size. First, empirical studies showing both processes operating simultaneously are rare. Second, time-series analyses of long-term census data sometimes overestimate dependence. By using a density-perturbation experiment on arctic ground squirrels, we show concurrent density-dependent and density-independent declines in weaning rates, followed by density-dependent declines in overwinter survival during hibernation. These two processes result in strong, density-dependent convergence of experimentally increased populations to those of control populations that had been at low, stable levels."
https://openalex.org/W1984363765,"The elongated dorsal appendages of the reptile Longisquama insignis , from the Triassic of Kyrgyzstan1, have recently been reinterpreted as the first record of feathers in a non-avian tetrapod2 — long predating the feathers of the oldest known bird, Archaeopteryx. Here we present evidence that the dorsal scales of Longisquama are not feathers, and that they are in fact strikingly different from avian feathers. We conclude that Archaeopteryx remains the oldest known feathered tetrapod."
