https://openalex.org/W1970449860,"CHEMICAL decomposition of nitrite in soil1–7 resembles microbial denitrification by producing gaseous end-products, N2 and N2O (refs. 8–11). NO and N2 are formed in sterile soil over a wide pH range12, and N2 is also formed in sterile aqueous solutions containing nitrite and iron13,14. We show here that NO, N2 and N2O are products of non-biological nitrite decomposition in soil."

https://openalex.org/W1996361809,WE have measured the vapour pressure isotope effect (VPIE) between H218O and H216O ice from −17° C to 0° C and have obtained results in disagreement with those reported by Matsuo and Matsubaya1. In order to check our measurements we have also determined the VPIE in the liquid phase and obtained results in good agreement with Szapiro and Steckel2. Also we have calculated from the present data an ice–liquid fractionation factor in good agreement with O'Neil's directly measured value of 1.0030 ± 0.0002 (ref. 3).
https://openalex.org/W2084976655,THE tropylium1–3 and N-heterocyclic cations4–6 have been shown to act as electron acceptors in forming complexes of the electron–donor–acceptor type with halide ions and aromatic hydrocarbons as donors. Aliphatic amines form adducts of the σ-complex type with N-heterocyclic cations7.

https://openalex.org/W1971003957,"I AM writing not about prostaglandins but about requests for reprints of a Nature article1 about them. In the first two months after this was published, I received 615 reprint requests of which 53 per cent came from the USA or Canada. Thirty-eight per cent of these, and 16 per cent of those from other countries, bore the name of the sender only in typewritten or rubber-stamped form. Of the handwritten names, internal evidence suggested that many were not personal signatures."

https://openalex.org/W4244108468,"THE article by J. A. Howard1, “Increased Luminance in the Direction of Reflex Reflexion—a recently observed Natural Phenomenon”, is no doubt interesting. It may, however, be useful to point out that this “recently observed phenomenon” is identical with the heiligenschein, extensively discussed in the classical book of Pernter–Exner, Meteorologische Optik2, with several references to earlier reports. The first observation goes back to Winterfeld3 (1804), which can hardly be called “recent”. A brief description is also found in my book4."
