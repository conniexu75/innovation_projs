https://openalex.org/W2046165746,"Most neurons form synapses exclusively with other neurons, but little is known about the molecular mechanisms mediating synaptogenesis in the central nervous system. Using an in vitro system, we demonstrate that neuroligin-1 and -2, postsynaptically localized proteins, can trigger the de novo formation of presynaptic structure. Nonneuronal cells engineered to express neuroligins induce morphological and functional presynaptic differentiation in contacting axons. This activity can be inhibited by addition of a soluble version of beta-neurexin, a receptor for neuroligin. Furthermore, addition of soluble beta-neurexin to a coculture of defined pre- and postsynaptic CNS neurons inhibits synaptic vesicle clustering in axons contacting target neurons. Our results suggest that neuroligins are part of the machinery employed during the formation and remodeling of CNS synapses."

Dscam binds directly to both Dock's SH2 and SH3 domains. Genetic studies revealed that Dscam, Dock and Pak, a serine/threonine kinase, act together to direct pathfinding of Bolwig's nerve, containing a subclass of sensory axons, to an intermediate target in the embryo. Dscam also is required for the formation of axon pathways in the embryonic central nervous system. cDNA and genomic analyses reveal the existence of multiple forms of Dscam with a conserved architecture containing variable Ig and transmembrane domains. Alternative splicing can potentially generate more than 38,000 Dscam isoforms. This molecular diversity may contribute to the specificity of neuronal connectivity."
https://openalex.org/W1969008019,"To clarify the key role of Rad50 in DNA double-strand break repair (DSBR), we biochemically and structurally characterized ATP-bound and ATP-free Rad50 catalytic domain (Rad50cd) from Pyrococcus furiosus. Rad50cd displays ATPase activity plus ATP-controlled dimerization and DNA binding activities. Rad50cd crystal structures identify probable protein and DNA interfaces and reveal an ABC-ATPase fold, linking Rad50 molecular mechanisms to ABC transporters, including P glycoprotein and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator. Binding of ATP gamma-phosphates to conserved signature motifs in two opposing Rad50cd molecules promotes dimerization that likely couples ATP hydrolysis to dimer dissociation and DNA release. These results, validated by mutations, suggest unified molecular mechanisms for ATP-driven cooperativity and allosteric control of ABC-ATPases in DSBR, membrane transport, and chromosome condensation by SMC proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2102653975,"The initiation of chromosome segregation at anaphase is linked by the spindle assembly checkpoint to the completion of chromosome-microtubule attachment during metaphase. To determine the function of the mitotic checkpoint protein Mad2 during normal cell division and when mitosis goes awry, we have knocked out Mad2 in mice. We find that E5.5 embryonic cells lacking Mad2, like mad2 yeast, grow normally but are unable to arrest in response to spindle disruption. At E6.5, the cells of the epiblast begin rapid cell division and the absence of a checkpoint results in widespread chromosome missegregation and apoptosis. In contrast, the postmitotic trophoblast giant cells survive without Mad2. Thus, the spindle assembly checkpoint is required for accurate chromosome segregation in mitotic mouse cells, and for embryonic viability, even in the absence of spindle damage."
https://openalex.org/W1971766102,"Ena/VASP proteins have been implicated in cell motility through regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and are found at focal adhesions and the leading edge. Using overexpression, loss-of-function, and inhibitory approaches, we find that Ena/VASP proteins negatively regulate fibroblast motility. A dose-dependent decrease in movement is observed when Ena/VASP proteins are overexpressed in fibroblasts. Neutralization or deletion of all Ena/VASP proteins results in increased cell movement. Selective depletion of Ena/VASP proteins from focal adhesions, but not the leading edge, has no effect on motility. Constitutive membrane targeting of Ena/VASP proteins inhibits motility. These results are in marked contrast to current models for Ena/VASP function derived mainly from their role in the actin-driven movement of Listeria monocytogenes."
https://openalex.org/W2096049571,"The E. coli 6S RNA was discovered more than three decades ago, yet its function has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate that 6S RNA associates with RNA polymerase in a highly specific and efficient manner. UV crosslinking experiments revealed that 6S RNA directly contacts the sigma70 and beta/beta' subunits of RNA polymerase. 6S RNA accumulates as cells reach the stationary phase of growth and mediates growth phase-specific changes in RNA polymerase. Stable association between sigma70 and core RNA polymerase in extracts is only observed in the presence of 6S RNA. We show 6S RNA represses expression from a sigma70-dependent promoter during stationary phase. Our results suggest that the interaction of 6S RNA with RNA polymerase modulates sigma70-holoenzyme activity."
https://openalex.org/W2056862346,"Drosophila Roundabout (Robo) is the founding member of a conserved family of repulsive axon guidance receptors that respond to secreted Slit proteins. Little is known about the signaling mechanisms which function downstream of Robo to mediate repulsion. Here, we present genetic and biochemical evidence that the Abelson (Abl) tyrosine kinase and its substrate Enabled (Ena) play direct and opposing roles in Robo signal transduction. Genetic interactions support a model in which Abl functions to antagonize Robo signaling, while Ena is required in part for Robo's repulsive output. Both Abl and Ena can directly bind to Robo's cytoplasmic domain. A mutant form of Robo that interferes with Ena binding is partially impaired in Robo function, while a mutation in a conserved cytoplasmic tyrosine that can be phosphorylated by Abl generates a hyperactive Robo receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1975482089,"Cellular export of cyclic nucleotides has been observed in various tissues and may represent an elimination pathway for these signaling molecules, in addition to degradation by phosphodiesterases. In the present study we provide evidence that this export is mediated by the multidrug resistance protein isoform MRP5 (gene symbol ABCC5). The transport function of MRP5 was studied in V79 hamster lung fibroblasts transfected with a human MRP5 cDNA. An MRP5-specific antibody detected an overexpression of the glycoprotein of 185 ± 15 kDa in membranes from MRP5-transfected cells and a low basal expression of hamster Mrp5 in control membranes. ATP-dependent transport of 3′,5′-cyclic GMP at a substrate concentration of 1 μmwas 4-fold higher in membrane vesicles from MRP5-transfected cells than in control membranes. This transport was saturable with a Km value of 2.1 μm. MRP5-mediated transport was also detected for 3′,5′-cyclic AMP at a lower affinity, with a Km value of 379 μm. A potent inhibition of MRP5-mediated transport was observed by several compounds, known as phosphodiesterase modulators, including trequinsin, with a Ki of 240 nm, and sildenafil, with a Ki value of 267 nm. Thus, cyclic nucleotides are physiological substrates for MRP5; moreover, MRP5 may represent a novel pharmacological target for the enhancement of tissue levels of cGMP.

Similarly, export of 3′,5-cGMP, upon stimulation of guanylyl cyclases in response to nitric oxide or natriuretic peptides, has been demonstrated in many cells, including endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, kidney epithelial cells, and lung fibroblasts (5Hamet P.

This secretion has been considered as a means of removing the excess of intracellular cyclic nucleotides. Thus, the cellular elimination pathways of these second messengers comprise metabolic degradation by phosphodiesterases, as well as export across the plasma membrane. In addition, a role of extracellular cyclic nucleotides in cell-cell cross-talks has been suggested (8Patel M.J. Wypij D.M. Rose D.A. Rimele T.J. Wiseman J.S. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

For example, extracellular cAMP acts as a chemoattractant and differentiation factor in the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum by binding to surface receptors for cAMP (11Janssens P.W. van Haastert P.J.M. Microbiol. Rev. 1987; 51: 396-418Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both cAMP, as well as cGMP, secretion has been shown to be unidirectional and energy-dependent (4Fehr T.F. Dickinson E.S.

Furthermore, a primary active transport of cGMP has been demonstrated directly in inside-out membrane vesicles from human erythrocytes (12Sager G. Ørbo A. Pettersen R.H. Kjøstad K.E. Scand. J. Clin.

The transport of both cyclic nucleotides has been shown to be inhibited by probenecid, suggesting that this export is mediated by a transporter for amphiphilic anions (10Millul V. Prie D.

Members of the multidrug resistance protein (MRP)1 family have been recognized as export pumps for amphiphilic anions, particularly for conjugates of lipophilic compounds with glutathione or several other anionic residues. The best characterized members with respect to transport function are MRP1 (16Cole S.P.C. Bhardwaj G. Gerlach J.H. Mackie J.E. Grant C.E. Almquist K.C. Stewart A.J. Kurz E.U. Duncan A.M.V.

Gerrard B. Hutchinson A. Dean M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 1649-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) followed by cloning of cDNA fragments (26Kool M. de Haas M. Scheffer G.L. Scheper R.J. van Eijk M.J.T. Juijn J.A. Baas F. Borst P. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3537-3547PubMed Google Scholar). MRP5 has been shown to be ubiquitously expressed with high transcript levels in brain, skeletal muscle, lung, and heart and only low levels in liver (26Kool M. de Haas M. Scheffer G.L.

Gene. 2000; 242: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, nothing was known so far about the physiological function of MRP5. In the present study, we stably expressed an MRP5 cDNA, cloned from human brain, in V79 hamster lung fibroblasts. The substrate specificity of the recombinant protein was assessed using isolated membrane vesicles from these cells and control cells. The results identify cyclic nucleotides as physiological substrates of this MRP family member. [2,8-3H]cAMP (0.8 TBq/mmol) and [8-3H]cGMP (0.3 TBq/mmol) were obtained from Hartmann Analytic, Braunschweig, Germany. Unlabeled cyclic nucleotides, 8-bromo-cGMP, N 2,2′-O-dibutyryl-cGMP, the phosphodiesterase inhibitors Zaprinast and Trequinsin, and the protein standard mixture (26–180 kDa) for SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were from Sigma. Sildenafil was extracted from a commercially available 100-mg tablet (Viagra®, Pfizer; obtained from a local pharmacy) and purified by high performance liquid chromatography using a C18 Hypersil column as described by Warrington et al. (31Warrington J.S. Shader R.I. von Moltke L.L. Greenblatt D.J. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2000; 28: 392-397PubMed Google Scholar). MK 571 (3-([{3-(2-[7-chloro-2-quinolinyl]ethenyl)phenyl}-{(3-dimethylamino-3-oxopropyl)-thio}-methyl]thio) propanoic acid) was obtained from Alexis Corp., San Diego, CA. [14,15,19,20-3H]Leukotriene C4(4.2 TBq/mmol), 17β-d-glucuronosyl [6,7-3H]estradiol (1.8 TBq/mmol), and [glycine-2-3H]glutathione ([3H]GSH, 1.6 TBq/mmol) were obtained from NEN Life Science Products. [3H]Glutathione disulfide ([3H]GSSG) was synthesized from [3H]GSH as described (32Leier I. Jedlitschky G. Buchholz U. Center M. Cole S.P. Deeley R.G. Keppler D. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 433-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The AMF antibody was raised in rabbits against the 14 carboxyl-terminal amino acids of the deduced MRP5 sequence (AMFAAAENKVAVKG) coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin in a procedure similar to that described previously (20Büchler M. König J. Brom M. Kartenbeck J. Spring H. Horie T. Keppler D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15091-15098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar, 33Schnölzer M. Alewood P. Jones A. Alewood D. Kent S.B.H. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1992; 40: 180-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). A full-length MRP5 cDNA was cloned from a human brain 5′-STRETCH PLUS cDNA library, prepared from whole cerebral brain of a caucasian male (CLONTECH). Initially, polymerase chain reaction primers were chosen from the partial MRP5sequence published by Kool et al. (Ref. 26Kool M. de Haas M. Scheffer G.L. Scheper R.J. van Eijk M.J.T. Juijn J.A. Baas F. Borst P. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3537-3547PubMed Google Scholar; GenBankTM/EBI accession number U83661) and used for amplification of a 600-bp fragment from the 3′-end of the MRP5 sequence. This fragment was used as a probe for screening of this library by plaque hybridization, performed as described (34Jedlitschky G. Cassidy A.J. Sales M. Pratt N. Burchell B. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 837-843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The screening yielded a 1.6-kb partial MRP5clone. Subsequently, the missing 5′-half of the full-length sequence was obtained by polymerase chain reaction using gene-specific primers based on the sequence published by Belinsky et al. (Ref. 27Belinsky M.G. Bain L.J. Balsara B.B. Testa J.R. Kruh G.D. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1998; 91: 888-889Google Scholar; GenBankTM/EBI accession number AF104942). Overlapping polymerase chain reaction fragments were amplified and subcloned into the pGEM®-T Easy vector (Promega). Several clones from each fragment were subcloned and sequenced to identify and eliminate mutations introduced by Taq polymerase misreading. The 1.6-kb clone, together with the overlapping polymerase chain reaction products, yielded a 4.5-kb cDNA with an open reading frame encoding 1437 amino acids. The coding sequence was identical to the published sequence with GenBankTM/EBI accession number AF104942, except for the following differences: a 2-bp alteration within a single codon (T,T compared with C,C at nucleotide positions 292 and 293 in the published sequence) results in a conservative substitution of Ala to Val. Another 2-bp alteration within a single codon (nucleotides 1323 and 1325 of the published sequence) results in a substitution of a Ser for a Gly. This difference, however, was also reported by McAleer et al. (Ref. 28McAleer M.A. Breen M.A. White N.L. Matthews N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23541-23548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar; GenBankTM/EBI accession numberAF146074) and by Suzuki et al. (35Suzuki T. Nishio K. Sasaki H. Kurowa H. Saito-Ohara F. Ikeuchi T. Tanabe S. Terada M. Saijo N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 334-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) in the truncated MRP5 termed SMRP (GenBankTM/EBI accession number AB005659). The complete 4.5-kb cDNA insert was excised from the pGEM®-T Easy vector and cloned into the NotI site of the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1/Hygro (Invitrogen). The correct orientation and integrity of the cDNA in the expression vector was assessed by restriction analysis and sequencing of the cloning site. Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts V79 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin. The cells were transfected with the pcDNA3.1/Hygro-MRP5 cDNA construct or the vector only using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After 48 h, the cells were split, and stable transfectants were selected using medium containing 600 μg/ml hygromycin B (Invitrogen). Resistant clones were screened by Northern blot and immunoblot analyses for MRP5 expression. Sodium butyrate (5 mm) was added to the cells 40 h before harvesting to enhance the expression of the recombinant protein (36Chen W.Y. Bailey E.C. McCune S.L. Dong J. Townes T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5798-5803Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 37Cui Y. König J. Buchholz U. Spring H. Leier I. Keppler D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 929-937PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA (30 μg), isolated from transfected cells using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen), was fractionated on a 1.2% formaldehyde/agarose gel and transferred to Duralon UV membranes (Stratagene). A 32P-labeled 970-bp fragment of the MRP5 cDNA or a β-actin control probe were used for detection. Membranes were hybridized and washed with high stringency as described (34Jedlitschky G. Cassidy A.J. Sales M. Pratt N. Burchell B. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 837-843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Membrane fractions were diluted with sample buffer und incubated at 37 °C for 20 min prior to separation on a 7.5% SDS polyacrylamide gel. Immunoblotting was performed using a tank blotting system (Bio-Rad) and an enhanced chemiluminescence horseradish peroxidase detection system (NEN Life Science Products). Plasma membrane vesicles from transfected V79 cells were prepared from hypotonically lysed cells as described (38Keppler D. Jedlitschky G. Leier I. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 292: 607-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). ATP-dependent transport of3H-labeled substrates into inside-out membrane vesicles was measured by rapid filtration through nitrocellulose filters essentially as described (38Keppler D. Jedlitschky G. Leier I. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 292: 607-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Membrane vesicles (50 μg of protein) were incubated in the presence of 4 mm ATP, 10 mmMgCl2, 10 mm creatine phosphate, 100 μg/ml creatine kinase, and labeled substrate, in an incubation buffer containing 250 mm sucrose, and 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4. The final incubation volume was 75 μl. The substrate and inhibitor concentrations are given in the respective figure legends. For inhibition studies compounds were added from a stock solution in an appropriate solvent (dimethyl sulfoxide or ethanol, final concentration < 0.5% v/v), and identical concentrations of the vehicle were used in control samples. Aliquots (20 μl) of the incubations were taken at the times indicated, diluted in 1 ml of ice-cold incubation buffer, and filtered immediately through nitrocellulose filters (0.2 μm pore size, pre-soaked in incubation buffer). Filters were rinsed with 5 ml of incubation buffer, dissolved in liquid scintillation fluid, and counted for radioactivity. In control experiments, ATP was replaced by an equal concentration of 5′-AMP. Rates of net ATP-dependent transport were calculated by subtracting values obtained in the presence of 5′-AMP as a blank from those in the presence of ATP. For determination of kinetic constants, transport rates were measured at five different substrate concentrations (0.5–10 μm for cGMP and 20–500 μm for cAMP). Km values were determined as substrate concentration at half-maximal velocity of transport under these conditions. Similar results were obtained by use of double-reciprocal plots and direct curve fitting to the Michaelis-Menten equation. Human MRP5 cDNA was cloned from a human brain cDNA library and characterized as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A stable clonal cell line (V79-MRP5) was established after transfection of Chinese hamster V79 fibroblasts with the MRP5-vector construct and selection in hygromycin B. A control hygromycin-resistant clone was obtained from transfection with the parental vector (V79-Co). Expression of MRP5 was analyzed first on the mRNA level by Northern blotting (Fig. 1 A) performed on total RNA isolated from these cell lines. A transcript of approximately 4.5 kb was detected only in the MRP5-transfected cells under high stringency conditions using a 970-bp fragment of the human MRP5 cDNA as a probe. Further, immunoblot analysis was performed on crude membranes (100,000 × g Pellets) and purified plasma membrane vesicles (Membranes) using the polyclonal antibody AMF directed against the carboxyl terminus of MRP5 (Fig. 1, Band C). This antibody specifically detected a diffuse band, characteristic for glycosylated proteins, at 170–200 kDa. This is consistent with the molecular mass of about 220 kDa reported for an enhanced green fluorescent protein-MRP5 fusion protein (28McAleer M.A. Breen M.A. White N.L. Matthews N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23541-23548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). A protein with the same apparent molecular mass was detected also in the control cells and was assumed to represent the endogenous hamster Mrp5. The detection signal was, in all V79-MRP5 membrane preparations, about 5- to 8-fold stronger than in the control cells. In addition, a significant signal was obtained in membranes of human erythrocytes, indicating the expression of MRP5 in red blood cells (Fig. 1 C). The antibody showed no cross-reactivity with human MRP1, MRP2, MRP3, or MRP6 (not shown). ATP-dependent transport of [3H]cGMP and [3H]cAMP, which proceeded into the fraction of inside-out-oriented vesicles, was studied during a 10-min period (Fig. 2). ATP-dependent transport (Fig. 2, left panels) was calculated by subtracting the vesicle-associated radioactivity in the presence of 5′-AMP from the values obtained in the presence of ATP. ATP-dependent [3H]cGMP accumulation at the standard concentration of 1 μm was 2.3 ± 0.6 pmol × mg protein −1 at 10 min in vesicles from vector-transfected control cells (V79-Co), which exhibited expression of endogenous Mrp5 (Fig. 1, B and C). The membranes from MRP5-transfected cells (V79-MRP5) showed a 4-fold higher ATP-dependent transport with 9.3 ± 0.9 pmol × mg protein −1 at 10 min (Fig. 2, upper panels). The amount of [3H]cGMP taken up by the vesicles was markedly decreased by increasing the osmolarity of the extravesicular medium, indicating transport into the intravesicular space. At a concentration of 1 m sucrose (outside the vesicles) the transport rate was 22.2 ± 3.3% (mean ± S.D.,n = 3) of the value obtained under standard conditions with 250 mm sucrose. The rate of ATP-dependent transport of [3H]cAMP at the same concentration (1 μm) was 2.2 ± 0.4 pmol × mg protein−1 at 10 min (Fig. 2, lower panels) with V79-MRP5 vesicles. This transport was below the detection limit with membranes from control cells under these conditions and substrate concentration (1 μm). At a concentration of 1 μm, ATP-dependent transport of [3H]cGMP in V79-MRP5 was about 4-fold higher than [3H]cAMP transport (Fig. 2, lower right panel). The higher affinity of MRP5 to cGMP is reflected in an apparent Km of 2.1 ± 0.2 μm for cGMP compared with a Km value of 379 ± 24 μm for cAMP (Fig. 3). The transport efficiency (Vmax/Km) was 2100 μl × mg protein −1 × min −1 for cGMP and only 90 μl × mg protein −1 × min −1 for cAMP.Figure 3Kinetic analysis of MRP5-mediated cAMP and cGMP transport and its inhibition by trequinsin. Rates of ATP-dependent transport of [3H]cGMP (upper panel) and [3H]cAMP (lower panel) were determined in V79-MRP5 membranes at five different substrate concentrations as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The substrate concentration at half-maximal velocity of transport (Km values) were calculated from double-reciprocal Lineweaver-Burk plots. In addition, transport of cGMP was analyzed in the presence of 1 μm trequinsin (▴,upper panel), and the inhibition constant (Ki ) for competitive inhibition was determined. Points represent mean values ± S.D. from triplicate determinations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Inhibition studies with several amphiphilic anions are summarized in TableI. ATP-dependent transport of cGMP in V79-MRP5 membranes was inhibited to about 50% by fluorescein diacetate at a concentration of 50 μm. This anionic fluorescent dye had been identified as an MRP5 substrate in accumulation studies in cells transfected with an enhanced green fluorescent protein-MRP5 construct (28McAleer M.A. Breen M.A. White N.L. Matthews N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23541-23548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Probenecid, a commonly used inhibitor of organic anion transporters, inhibited cGMP transport at the same concentration (50 μm) by about 68%. Under the conditions used, inhibition by cAMP was detected only at relatively high concentrations (above 100 μm). This is in line with the relatively high Km value for this compound (Fig. 3). MK571, a leukotriene receptor antagonist, which inhibits MRP1-mediated transport in sub-micromolar concentrations (17Jedlitschky G. Leier I. Buchholz U. Center M. Keppler D. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4833-4836PubMed Google Scholar), had no inhibitory effect on MRP5-mediated transport in concentrations up to 50 μm. Several compounds structurally related to cGMP (Fig. 4) and currently used as phosphodiesterase inhibitors were identified as potent inhibitors of cGMP transport. Trequinsin inhibited MRP5-mediated cGMP transport competitively with a Ki value of 240 nm(Fig. 3). A similarly potent inhibition was observed with sildenafil, with a Ki value of 267 nm (figure not shown).Table IInhibition of MRP5-mediated cGMP transportCompoundConcentration[3H]cGMP transportμm% of control None (control)100 cAMP50035.5 ± 6.2 Fluorescein diacetate5049.2 ± 6.6 Probenecid5031.7 ± 4.0 MK57150130.5 ± 25.3cGMP Analogs/phosphodiesterase inhibitors 8-Bromo-cGMP1069.3 ± 4.2 N 2,2′-O-Dibutyryl-cGMP1060.1 ± 4.8 Zaprinast1041.0 ± 3.9165.5 ± 7.9 Trequinsin126.2 ± 4.2 Sildenafil122.0 ± 3.4Membrane vesicles from V79-MRP5 cells were incubated with [3H]cGMP (1 μm) for 15 min at 37 °C in the presence of several amphiphilic anions and compounds known as phosphodiesterase inhibitors at the concentrations indicated.

Because glutathione and glucuronate conjugates are high affinity substrates for MRP1, MRP2, and MRP3 (24König J. Nies A.T. Cui Y. Leier I. Keppler D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1461: 377-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar), transport of these compounds was measured in V79-MRP5 and control membranes. No significant MRP5-mediated transport of leukotriene C4 could be detected in incubations with [3H]leukotriene C4 in concentrations from 25 nm to 1 μm with various proportions of labeled and unlabeled substrate, yielding final specific activities from 0.2 to 1.7 TBq/mmol. No MRP5-mediated high affinity transport could also be detected with 17β-glucuronosyl [3H]estradiol (0.2–5 μm; 0.2–2.0 TBq/mmol) and [3H]GSSG (1–100 μm; 0.3–3.2 TBq/mmol). Transport of these compounds was well detectable under these conditions in membranes from MRP1-overexpressing cells (not shown). Cyclic GMP has emerged as a major focus in signal transduction research. Mediating most of the effects of nitric oxide, it plays an important role in smooth muscle relaxation, neutrophil degranulation, inhibition of platelet aggregation, neural communication in the brain, and several other physiological processes (for review see Refs. 39Moncada S. Palmer R.M. Higgs E.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 109-142PubMed Google Scholar and40Garthwaite J. Boulton C.L. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 683-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar). On one hand, cellular cGMP levels are determined by the rate of synthesis by guanylyl cyclases and, on the other hand, by the elimination rate. Elimination pathways comprise degradation by phosphodiesterases, as well as active export into the extracellular space (Fig. 5). This is in line with the observation that in cerebral cells and platelets, after stimulation with nitric oxide, the cGMP accumulation is decreased faster than it could be explained solely by the phosphodiesterase activity (41Bellamy T.C. Wood J. Goodwin D.A. Garthwaite J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2928-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The knowledge about the structure and function of the protein families involved in cGMP synthesis and degradation has grown vastly the last years, whereas little was known so far about the molecular identity of the proteins that mediate the cellular export. Studies in membrane vesicles from human erythrocytes suggested that cGMP is transported by an organic anion transport ATPase (12Sager G. Ørbo A. Pettersen R.H. Kjøstad K.E. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Invest. 1996; 56: 289-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 13Schultz C. Vaskinn S. Kildalsen H. Sager G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1161-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 14Sundkvist E. Jaeger R. Sager G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1463: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The reported characteristics of this transport system in erythrocytes, including the Km value of 2.4 μm for cGMP (13Schultz C. Vaskinn S. Kildalsen H. Sager G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1161-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and the lack of affinity for the MRP1 substrate leukotriene C4(14Sundkvist E. Jaeger R. Sager G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1463: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), are similar to our findings on MRP5-mediated cGMP transport (see Fig. 3, Table I, and “Inhibition of MRP5-mediated cGMP Transport”). There is only some discrepancy with respect to cAMP transport. Based on the observation that 100 μm of cAMP caused only a poor inhibition of cGMP transport, it was concluded that the export system for cGMP was not shared with cAMP. We could observe MRP5-mediated transport of [3H]cAMP, but with a more than 20-fold lower transport efficiency (Vmax/Km) than that for cGMP (see Fig. 3 and the second paragraph under “Results”). Therefore, we obtained also a poor inhibition of cGMP transport by cAMP at concentrations below 100 μm (Table I). Because of the high Km value for cAMP (379 μm, Fig.3), MRP5-mediated cAMP transport may only be significant under conditions with high intracellular cAMP levels. Because of the reported transport activity, we analyzed MRP5 expression in erythrocyte membranes and obtained a significant signal with the MRP5-specific AMF antiserum (Fig. 1 C). This indicates that MRP5 represents at least a major constituent of the cGMP export in human erythrocytes. Secretion of cGMP in response to nitric oxide has been also observed in rat lung fibroblasts (8Patel M.J. Wypij D.M. Rose D.A. Rimele T.J. Wiseman J.S. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1995; 273: 16-25PubMed Google Scholar). This is in line with our observation of a basal cGMP transport in our parental or vector-transfected control cells and the detection of a glycoprotein recognized by the MRP5-specific antibody in the control cells (Fig. 1, B and C). Little was known so far about the function of MRP5. Studies in human embryonic kidney cells transfected with a green fluorescent protein-MRP5 construct indicated that it mediates export of the anionic dye fluorescein diacetate ATP-dependently, but glutathione-independently (28McAleer M.A. Breen M.A. White N.L. Matthews N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23541-23548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). This is in agreement with the inhibition of cGMP transport by this compound (Table I). Unlike MRP1 and MRP2, MRP5 seems not to confer resistance against anthracyclines, Vinca alkaloids, and epipodophyllotoxins (28McAleer M.A. Breen M.A. White N.L. Matthews N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23541-23548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 29Wijnholds J. Mool C.A.A.M. Scheffer G.L. Scheper P. Borst P. Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 1999; 40 (abstr.): 315Google Scholar). However, MRP5-mediated low level resistance against thiopurines has been reported (29Wijnholds J. Mool C.A.A.M. Scheffer G.L. Scheper P. Borst P. Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 1999; 40 (abstr.): 315Google Scholar). Comparison of hydropathy profiles of MRP5 with other members of the MRP family indicated that its structure is most similar to that of MRP4. Both lack the hydrophobic extension of about 200 amino acids (first five transmembrane domains) present in MRP1, MRP2, and MRP3 (27Belinsky M.G. Bain L.J. Balsara B.B. Testa J.R. Kruh G.D. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1998; 91: 888-889Google Scholar, 42Borst P. Evers R. Kool M. Wijnholds J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1461: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). MRP4 has been found to be overexpressed in T-lymphoid CEM-r1 cells resistant to nucleoside-based antiviral drugs, and an energy-dependent efflux of the nucleoside phosphonate 9-(2-phosphonyl-methoxyethyl)adenine (PMEA) and of azidothymidine monophosphate from these cells has been demonstrated (43Schuetz J.D. Connelly M.C. Sun D. Paibir S.G. Flynn P.M. Srinivas R.V. Kumar A. Fridland A. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 1048-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Very recently, an MRP5-mediated efflux of PMEA and 6-thioinosine from transfected human embryonic kidney cells and Madin-Darby canine kidney cells has been reported (44Wijnholds J. Mol C.A.A.M van Deemter L. de Haas M. Scheffer G.L. Baas F. Beijnen J.H. Scheper R.J. Hatse S. De Clercq E. Balzarini J. Borst P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7476-7481Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). In these cells an enhanced efflux of S-(2, 4dinitrophenyl)glutathione and of glutathione across the basolateral membrane was observed. In isolated membrane vesicles, we could not detect a significant MRP5-mediated transport of the MRP1 and MRP2 substrates leukotriene C4, 17β-glucuronosyl estradiol, and glutathione disulfide. In addition, cGMP transport was not inhibited by the cysteinyl leukotriene analog MK571, a potent inhibitor of MRP1- and MRP2-mediated transport. This, however, does not exclude MRP5-mediated transport of other glutathione and glucuronate conjugates or complexes or transport of these compounds at high substrate concentrations. Our present study identifies for the first time natural cyclic nucleotides as substrates of an ATP-binding cassette transporter of the MRP family. cGMP and cAMP are also the first phosphate substrates for which ATP-dependent transport by an MRP family member was demonstrated directly in isolated membrane vesicles. Other MRP family members, especially MRP4, may function as transporters for cyclic nucleotides, as well. Based on RNase protection assays, however, expression of MRP4 is low in most tissues under normal conditions, whereas MRP5 is abundant in almost every organ, with low expression only in liver (26Kool M. de Haas M. Scheffer G.L. Scheper R.J. van Eijk M.J.T. Juijn J.A. Baas F. Borst P. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3537-3547PubMed Google Scholar). Because cGMP is the high affinity substrate for MRP5, this transporter may be a novel pharmacological target to interfere especially with the cGMP elimination from cells and enhance the intracellular cGMP concentration under various pathophysiological conditions, especially to relax vascular smooth muscles in treatment of angina pectoris, arterial hypertension, or erectile dysfunction. We could already demonstrate a relatively potent inhibition of this transport by several compounds known as phosphodiesterase inhibitors, including sildenafil as the most prominent one. Thus, these compounds can enhance intracellular cGMP levels through a dual action on cGMP degradation and export (Fig. 5). Compounds, inhibiting more specifically the transport system, may be identified in future studies and could be useful to determine the role of the ATP-dependent export in signal termination.

FOG-2(-/-) embryos die at midgestation with a cardiac defect characterized by a thin ventricular myocardium, common atrioventricular canal, and the tetralogy of Fallot malformation. Remarkably, coronary vasculature is absent in FOG-2(-/-) hearts. Despite formation of an intact epicardial layer and expression of epicardium-specific genes, markers of cardiac vessel development (ICAM-2 and FLK-1) are not detected, indicative of failure to activate their expression and/or to initiate the epithelial to mesenchymal transformation of epicardial cells. Transgenic reexpression of FOG-2 in cardiomyocytes rescues the FOG-2(-/-) vascular phenotype, demonstrating that FOG-2 function in myocardium is required and sufficient for coronary vessel development. Our findings provide the molecular inroad into the induction of coronary vasculature by myocardium in the developing heart."

From its primary sequence, ABC1 appears to be a pore-forming protein consisting of 6+6 transmembrane domains connected by a hydrophobic segment (32Luciani M.F. Denizot F. Savary S. Mattei M.G. Chimini G. Genomics. 1994; 21: 150-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). It has two nucleotide-binding domains, which bind ATP and hydrolyze it in order to power active transport of unknown substrate(s). It was first identified in macrophages as a potential transporter for interleukin-1 (32Luciani M.F. Denizot F. Savary S. Mattei M.G. Chimini G.

The present study was undertaken to determine if increased efflux of cholesterol was correlated to the up-regulation of ABC1 mRNA and protein. Using J774 as a model system, we established a standard protocol, which we then applied to a variety of cell types. This revealed a close correlation between ABC1 message levels and increased efflux. The relationship was confirmed by studies of elicited macrophages from theAbc1 −/− mouse. The following were purchased from Sigma: phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, fetal bovine serum (FBS), calf serum, bovine serum albumin (essentially fatty acid free), gentamicin (g), β-mercaptoethanol, l-glutamine, and 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)adenosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate (cpt-cAMP). 2-Hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (2-OH-β-CD) was a gift from Cerestar USA, Inc.

U-937 human monocytes were grown in suspension in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS, 0.01 m Hepes, 1% sodium pyruvate, 0.25% glucose. THP-1 human monocytes were grown in the same medium supplemented with 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol. THP-1 and U-937 were differentiated before use by incubating them for 3 days on growth medium supplemented with 50 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. COS-7 primate kidney cells were grown on DMEM with 10% calf serum. CaCo2, human enterocytes, were grown in DMEM with 20% FBS and 2 mm glutamine. Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-KI) were grown in Ham's F-12 with 5% FBS. Fu5AH rat hepatoma cells, HepG2 human hepatoma cells, L-cell mouse fibroblasts and WI38/VA13 cells (SV40-transformed human lung fibroblasts) were grown in EMEM with 10% FBS for HepG2 and fibroblasts and 5% calf serum for Fu5AH. GM3468A normal human skin fibroblasts were grown in EMEM with 20% FBS. MPM were isolated from male B6C3F1 mice 5 days after intraperitoneal injection with 2000 mg/kg 10% thioglycollate (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI). 5.0 × 105 of MPM per well were seeded in 12-well plates in RPMI 1640 with 15% FBS and allowed to attach for 4 h before use. All media were supplemented with 50 μg/ml gentamicin. All cells were incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Cells were seeded in 12- or 24-well plates or 100-mm dishes and then grown to 80–90% confluence before use. Abc1-deficient (−/−) mice were developed by gene targeting in DBA-1J ES cells using a non-isogenic targeting construct to delete 6 exons coding for the first nucleotide-binding domain as described (41McNeish J. Aiello R.J. Guyot D. Turi T. Gabel C. Aldinger C. Hoppe K.L. Roach M.L. Royer L.J. de Wet J. Broccardo C. Chimini G. Francone O.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Elicited peritoneal macrophages were obtained from control and Abc1-deficient mice as described above for B6C3F1 mice. Free human apoA-I and human high density lipoprotein (HDL3) were obtained as described previously (42Mahlberg F.H. Rothblat G.H. J. Biol.

ApoA-I was solubilized by dissolving 3 mg/ml in 6 m guanidine-HCl and holding it overnight at 4 °C. This solution was extensively dialyzed against a buffer of 10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.15 m NaCl, and 1 mmEDTA, filtered (0.45 μm Millipore), and stored at 4 °C. Fresh solutions were made up approximately once every 2 weeks. Monolayers that were used for cholesterol efflux studies were washed with MEM-Hepes, then incubated for 24 h in RPMI 1640 containing [1,2-3H]cholesterol (2 μCi/well) as described previously (12Sakr S.W. Williams D.L. Stoudt G.W. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1438: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The labeling medium also contained 1% FBS and 2 μg/ml CP-113,818 ACAT inhibitor. The ACAT inhibitor was used to ensure that all labeled cholesterol was present as free cholesterol. Parallel cultures grown in 100-mm dishes were used for the determination of ABC1 protein and mRNA. These monolayers were incubated with the same media without [1,2-3H]cholesterol. Following the 24-h labeling period, cells were washed and then incubated with 0.2% bovine serum albumin in RPMI 1640 with or without 0.3 mm cpt-cAMP for 12 h, unless otherwise indicated. After this 12-h incubation, some wells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, dried, and extracted with isopropyl alcohol. These wells provided baseline (time 0 (T 0)) values for total [1,2-3H]cholesterol content. Unlabeled monolayers grown in 100-mm dishes were harvested for total RNA isolation with TriZolTM reagent (Life Technologies, Inc., Grand Island, NY) or for protein analysis with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.02% sodium azide, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm Pefabloc, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, pH 8.0). Cells were scraped from the monolayers, repeatedly pipetted, and then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 4 min to pellet nuclei and debris. Lysates for mRNA and protein supernatants were stored at −70 °C. Cpt-cAMP-treated and control monolayers containing [1,2-3H]cholesterol were washed with MEM-Hepes and incubated for 4 h in the presence and absence of cholesterol acceptors at the concentrations indicated in the text or figures. The following acceptors were used: human lipid-free apolipoprotein A-I, HDL3, 2-OH-β–CD (44Christian A.E. Haynes M.P. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 2264-2272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) (45Rothblat G.H. Phillips M.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 1982; 257: 4775-4782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and human apolipoproteins E, C-I, C-II, or C-III. Cholesterol efflux was quantified by removing replicate 150-μl aliquots of the incubation medium containing the indicated acceptor, followed by filtration though a 0.45-μm multiscreen plate (Millipore, Corp., Bedford, MA). The radioactivity present in the incubation medium was determined by liquid scintillation counting and the percent of radiolabeled cholesterol released (% efflux) was calculated as: (cpm in medium at 4 h/cpm at time 0) × 100. Determination of cholesterol and protein were as previously described (46McCloskey H.M. Rothblat G.H. Glick J.M. Biochim. Biophys.

After extraction, RNA was precipitated with isopropyl alcohol and its integrity was assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Fifteen micrograms of total RNA were separated in a 1% agarose gel containing 2.2 m formaldehyde. RNA was transferred to Hybond-XL Nylon membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and cross-linked. A 518-base pair probe extending from residues 3110 to 3627 on the murine ABC1 cDNA was used to detect expression with the rapid hybridization system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's conditions. To verify equal loading of RNA, ABC1 probes were stripped and the membranes were rehybridized with a mouse cyclophilin probe (Ambion, Austin, TX). 32P radioactive emissions were recorded on a phosphorscreen and scanned with a PhosphorImager (Fuji, Stamford, CT) set to detect over a 5-order linear range of sensitivity. The hybridization signals were digitized and quantified. Cellular extracts were spun to remove debris. Cell lysate supernatants containing 6 μg of total protein were loaded, electrophoresed on 3–8% NuPAGETM Tris acetate gels (Novex, San Diego, CA), and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Murine ABC1 was detected with a rabbit site-directed primary antibody raised against residues 2177–2199 of the mature ABC1 protein. Membranes were then incubated with a goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase with visualization by enhanced chemiluminescence ECL PlusTM(Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's conditions. Results are reported as mean ± S.D. Statistical significance was determined by two-tailed Student's t test (GraphPad Prism version 3.0, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Our initial objective was to study the effect of cpt-cAMP treatment on cholesterol efflux and ABC1 mRNA in the J774 mouse macrophage system. Cell monolayers were prelabeled with [1,2-3H]cholesterol together with an ACAT inhibitor to ensure that all of the radiolabeled cholesterol released from the cell was derived from an unesterified cholesterol pool. A standard protocol was adopted in which monolayers were treated for 12 h with cpt-cAMP. This was followed by a 4-h incubation with various acceptors, during which time the fractional release of cellular labeled cholesterol was quantified (see “Experimental Procedures”). The absolute amount of efflux differed among the acceptors, a reflection of differences in concentration and efficiency. Cpt-cAMP treatment resulted in a marked stimulation of cholesterol efflux to apoA-I (14-fold) and HDL (3-fold) (Fig. 1). In contrast to apolipoprotein-containing acceptors, efflux to other acceptors (2-OH-β-CD, SUVs, bile acid micelles) was not increased by cpt-cAMP treatment (Fig. 1). Furthermore, cpt-cAMP enhanced efflux to other exchangeable apolipoproteins as shown in Fig.2. At equivalent mass concentrations, efflux was greatest to apoA-I and lowest to apoC-III. Thus, cpt-cAMP-stimulated efflux can be observed for exchangeable apolipoproteins and HDL, but not for other acceptors of cholesterol which have no protein component, such as CD, SUVs, or bile acid micelles.Figure 2Efflux of [3H]cholesterol from J774 cells incubated with various lipid-free apolipoproteins.Cells were pretreated with 0.3 mm cpt-cAMP as described in the legend to Fig. 1. Treated and control wells were incubated for 4 h with human apoA-I, apoE, apoC-I, C-II, or C-III in RPMI supplemented with 0.2% bovine serum albumin. All apolipoproteins were present at 20 μg/ml. Solid bars are monolayers pretreated with cpt-cAMP, open bars are untreated monolayers. Data are expressed as percent efflux. Data are mean ± S.D.,n = 3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In another series of experiments performed under the same protocol, 0.3 mm 8-Br-cGMP (8-bromoguanosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate) was substituted for cpt-cAMP. No stimulation of efflux was observed (data not shown). However, when J774 cells were pretreated with prostaglandin E1 or E2 (0.1 μm), cholesterol efflux was stimulated 7- and 9-fold, respectively (data not shown). To determine if the increased efflux in response to cpt-cAMP was a result of increased ABC1, J774 cells were pretreated with cpt-cAMP over a range of concentrations and the relationship between ABC1 mRNA and efflux was examined. After 12 h of exposure to cpt-cAMP, there was a dramatic increase in ABC1 mRNA expression (Fig.3). Stimulated efflux also depends on the duration of treatment with cpt-cAMP (12Sakr S.W. Williams D.L. Stoudt G.W. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1438: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). A time course of incubation was performed to determine the kinetics of ABC1 mRNA expression, protein synthesis, and efflux (Fig. 4). An increase in ABC1 message was detected within the first 15 min of treatment (1.2-fold over time zero). Cpt-cAMP elicited a reproducible biphasic increase in ABC1 mRNA levels (Fig. 4). An initial peak of induction was observed at 2 h. At later times, a second phase of ABC1 mRNA induction was observed which peaked at 6 h (15-fold above levels at time 0) and was much more prolonged than the initial transient increase. Protein levels begin to rise steadily after the first hour of treatment, while increased efflux is detected after 2 h (Fig. 4). From this and other data, the rate of change in efflux is greatest between 6 and 8 h after treatment (Fig. 4). Thus, a rise in ABC1 message and protein preceded efflux and there was a parallel increase in protein and efflux thereafter. Interestingly, two bands of ABC1 protein were detected (Fig.5); the lower molecular mass species migrated at approximately 210 kDa while the higher molecular mass species was also induced by cpt-cAMP and may have been a phosphorylated or post-translationally processed form of ABC1 protein.Figure 5Time course of ABC1 protein expression in J774 macrophages. Cells were treated with 0.3 mmcpt-cAMP and protein was isolated as described in the legend to Fig. 1and under “Experimental Procedures.” Six micrograms of total protein were loaded per lane.

https://openalex.org/W1988887868,"The accurate segregation of chromosomes at mitosis requires that all pairs of chromatids bind correctly to microtubules prior to the dissolution of sister cohesion and the initiation of anaphase. By analyzing the motion of GFP-tagged S. cerevisiae chromosomes, we show that kinetochore-microtubule attachments impose sufficient tension on sisters during prometaphase to transiently separate centromeric chromatin toward opposite sides of the spindle. Transient separations of 2–10 min duration occur in the absence of cohesin proteolysis, are characterized by independent motion of the sisters along the spindle, and are followed by the apparent reestablishment of sister linkages. The existence of transient sister separation in yeast explains the unusual bilobed localization of kinetochore proteins and supports an alternative model for spindle structure. By analogy with animal cells, we propose that yeast centromeric chromatin acts as a tensiometer."

The to amino acid sequence shows similarity to two ligand binding proteins, including juvenile hormone binding protein. to mRNA is expressed in the head and the cardia, crop, and antennae-structures related to feeding. to expression is induced by starvation, which is blocked in all arrhythmic central clock mutants, suggesting a direct molecular link between the circadian clock and the feeding/starvation response. A to mutant has aberrant locomotor activity and dies rapidly in response to starvation, indicating a link between locomotor activity, survival, and food status. We propose that to participates in a novel circadian output pathway that conveys temporal and food status information to feeding-relevant metabolisms and activities."

Both IRF-3 and IRF-7 are regulated in part by virus-induced C-terminal phosphorylation, leading to nuclear translocation, stimulation of DNA binding, and transcriptional activities. Structure-function studies with IRF-7 suggested a complex organization of the C-terminal region, with a constitutive activation domain located between amino acids 150–246, an accessory inducibility region at the very end of IRF-7 between amino acids 467 and 503, and an inhibitory region (amino acids 341–467) adjacent to the C-terminal end that interferes with transactivation. Furthermore, an element that increases basal and virus-inducible activity is located between amino acids 278 and 305. A transcriptionally active form of IRF-7 was also generated by substitution of Ser-477 and Ser-479 residues with the phosphomimetic Asp. IRF-7, particularly IRF-7(S477D/S479D), was a strong transactivator of type I interferon and RANTES chemokine gene expression.

Among the many virus- and IFN-inducible proteins are the growing family of interferon regulatory factors (IRFs), which now consists of nine members as well as several virally encoded IRFs (8Nguyen H. Hiscott J. Pitha P.M. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1997; 8: 293-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). The presence of IRF-like binding sites in the promoter region of IFNβ and IFNα genes implicated the IRF factors as direct regulators of IFN gene induction (9Fujita T. Sakakibara J. Sudo Y.

Cell. 1988; 54: 903-913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). Within the IRF family, IRF-3 and IRF-7 have recently been identified as key regulators for the induction of IFNs (reviewed in Ref. 14Mamane Y. Heylbroeck C. Genin P. Algarte M. Servant M. Lepage C. DeLuca C. Kwon H. Lin R. Hiscott J. Gene. 1999; 237: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). IRF-3 is expressed constitutively in a variety of tissues and demonstrates a unique response to virus infection (15Au W.-C. Moore P.A. Lowther W. Juang Y.-T. Pitha P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11657-11661Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Latent cytoplasmic IRF-3 is post-translationally modified and activated through phosphorylation of specific serine residues located in its C-terminal end following virus infection (16Lin R. Heylbroeck C. Pitha P.M. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2986-2996Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar, 17Wathelet M.G. Lin C.H. Parakh B.S. Ronco L.V. Howley P.M. Maniatis T. Mol.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1087-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). Following virus infection, inducible phosphorylation of IRF-3 at the C terminus relieves an intramolecular association between two autoinhibitory domains, unmasking the N-terminal DNA binding and C-terminal IRF association domains (IAD). The conformational change in IRF-3 results in the formation of homodimers through the IAD. IRF-3 dimers translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, associate with the CBP/p300 coactivator, and stimulate DNA binding and transcriptional activities (reviewed in Refs. 14Mamane Y. Heylbroeck C. Genin P. Algarte M. Servant M. Lepage C. DeLuca C. Kwon H. Lin R. Hiscott J. Gene. 1999; 237: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar and 20Hiscott J. Pitha P. Génin P. Nguyen H. Heylbroeck C. Mamane Y. Algarté M. Lin R. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1999; 19: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). IRF-3 phosphorylation ultimately results in its degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (16Lin R. Heylbroeck C. Pitha P.M. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2986-2996Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar, 21Ronco L. Karpova A. Vidal M. Howley P. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2061-2072Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). These biological features implicate IRF-3 as an important component of the immediate early response to virus infection (14Mamane Y. Heylbroeck C. Genin P. Algarte M. Servant M. Lepage C. DeLuca C. Kwon H. Lin R. Hiscott J. Gene. 1999; 237: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar, 20Hiscott J. Pitha P. Génin P. Nguyen H. Heylbroeck C. Mamane Y. Algarté M. Lin R. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1999; 19: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Overexpression of IRF-3 significantly enhances virus-mediated expression of type I IFN genes and results in the induction of an antiviral state (22Juang Y.T. Lowther W. Kellum M. Au W.C. Lin R. Hiscott J. Pitha P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9837-9842Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Other studies demonstrated that transcription of the CC-chemokine RANTES was up-regulated by virus infection, mediated through IRF-3 activation and binding to overlapping ISRE-like elements in the −100 region of the RANTES promoter (23Lin R. Heylbroeck C. Genin P. Pitha P. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 959-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). IRF-7 was first described to bind and repress the Qp promoter region of the Epstein-Barr virus-encoded gene, EBNA-1, which contains an ISRE-like element (24Nonkwello C. Ruf I.K. Sample J. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6887-6897Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Zhang L. Pagano J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5748-5757Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Unlike IRF-3, IRF-7 is not expressed constitutively in cells. Rather, expression is induced by IFN, lipopolysaccharide, and virus infection. As with IRF-3, virus infection appears to induce phosphorylation of IRF-7 at its C terminus, a region that is highly homologous to IRF-3 C-terminal end (26Marié I. Durbin J.E. Levy D.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6660-6669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Sato M. Hata N. Asagiri M. Nakaya T. Taniguchi T. Tanaka N. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). IRF-7 also localizes to the cytoplasm in uninfected cells and translocates to the nucleus after phosphorylation (27Sato M. Hata N. Asagiri M. Nakaya T. Taniguchi T. Tanaka N. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar, 28Au W.C. Moore P.A. LaFleur D.W. Tombal B. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29210-29217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Two groups have identified potential serine residues targeted for inducible phosphorylation by homology to IRF-3. Marié et al. (26Marié I. Durbin J.E. Levy D.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6660-6669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) mutated the Ser-425/Ser-426 in the murine IRF-7, based on homology to Ser-385/Ser-386 in IRF-3. This mutant was not phosphorylated and did not activate IFNα gene expression (26Marié I. Durbin J.E. Levy D.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6660-6669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Satoet al. (27Sato M. Hata N. Asagiri M. Nakaya T. Taniguchi T. Tanaka N. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar) generated a deletion mutant in which the region containing the potential sites of inducible phosphorylation between aa 411 and 453 was truncated. The mutant no longer translocated to the nucleus following virus infection, implicating inducible phosphorylation as a critical step for translocation. Cumulative molecular and biological results with IRF-3 and IRF-7 suggest a new model of IFN gene activation (reviewed in Ref. 14Mamane Y. Heylbroeck C. Genin P. Algarte M. Servant M. Lepage C. DeLuca C. Kwon H. Lin R. Hiscott J. Gene. 1999; 237: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Type I IFN genes can be subdivided into two groups: 1) immediate-early genes activated in response to virus infection by a protein synthesis-independent pathway (IFNβ and murine IFNα4); and 2) delayed-type genes, which include the other IFNα subtypes in which expression is dependent on de novo protein synthesis (26Marié I. Durbin J.E. Levy D.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6660-6669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Following virus infection, IRF-3, NF-κB, and ATF-2/c-Jun are post-translationally activated by inducer-mediated phosphorylation. These proteins cooperate to form a transcriptionally active enhanceosome at the IFNβ promoter, together with the CBP/p300 transcriptional coactivator and the chromatin-associated HMG (high mobility group) protein (29Falvo J.V.

IRF-3 also up-regulates IFNα4 expression in murine cells (26Marié I. Durbin J.E. Levy D.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6660-6669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Secreted IFN produced from a subset of initially infected cells acts through an autocrine and paracrine loop, which requires intact IFN receptor and JAK-STAT pathways. IFN activation of the ISGF3 complex results in the transcriptional up-regulation of IRF-7 (26Marié I. Durbin J.E. Levy D.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6660-6669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Sato M. Hata N. Asagiri M. Nakaya T. Taniguchi T. Tanaka N. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Virus infection activates IRF-7 through inducible phosphorylation, and phosphorylated IRF-7 participates together with IRF-3 in the transcriptional induction of immediate-early and delayed-type IFN genes (26Marié I. Durbin J.E. Levy D.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6660-6669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Sato M. Hata N. Asagiri M. Nakaya T. Taniguchi T. Tanaka N. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). In mice with a targeted disruption of either STAT-1, p48, or the type I IFN receptor, IRF-7 is not up-regulated, hence the amplification loop of IFN induction is not observed (26Marié I. Durbin J.E. Levy D.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6660-6669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Sato M. Hata N. Asagiri M. Nakaya T. Taniguchi T. Tanaka N. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Because of the common and distinct biological features of IRF-3 and IRF-7, we sought to identify the structural features of IRF-7 that regulate transcriptional activation, dimerization, and cytoplasmic to nuclear translocation. Our results demonstrate that IRF-7 possesses distinct structural characteristics compared with IRF-3 that impart complementary rather than redundant functional roles to these proteins in cytokine gene activation. Wild type IRF-7 expression plasmids were prepared by cloning the IRF-7A cDNA (polymerase chain reaction-amplified from pcDNA-IRF-7A, a gift from Drs. L. Zhang and J. Pagano) into the pFlag-CMV-2 (pFlag-IRF-7) or 5′-myc-pcDNA3 (myc-IRF-7) vector. The point mutations and deletion mutations of IRF-7 were generated by overlap polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis with Vent DNA polymerase, and mutations were confirmed by sequencing. The IFNB-luciferase reporter was generated by cloning the EcoRI-TaqI fragment (−280 to +20, filled in with Klenow enzyme) from pUCβ26 into theNheI site (filled in with Klenow enzyme) of the pGL3-basic vector (Promega). RANTES/pGL3 luciferase reporter was prepared by cloning the BglII-SalI fragment (−397 to +5, filled in with Klenow enzyme) from the RANTES/CAT (chloramphenicol acetyltransferase) reporter plasmid (23Lin R. Heylbroeck C. Genin P. Pitha P. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 959-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) into the NheI site (filled in with Klenow enzyme) of the pGL3-basic vector. IFNA1/pGL3 reporters (−140 to +9) were generated by cloning the polymerase chain reaction products from 293 cell genomic DNA into the SmaI site of the pGL3-basic vector. GFP-IRF-7 expression plasmids were generated by cloning cDNAs encoding wild type or mutated forms of IRF-7 into the downstream of enhanced green fluorescent protein in the pEGFP-C1 vector (CLONTECH). All transfections for luciferase assays were carried out in human embryonic kidney 293 cells grown in minimum essential medium (αMEM, Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, glutamine, and antibiotics. Subconfluent cells were transfected with 10 ng of pRLTK reporter (Renilla luciferase for internal control), 100 ng of pGL-3 reporter (firefly luciferase, experimental reporter), and 200 ng of expression plasmids by calcium phosphate coprecipitation method. The reporter plasmids were RANTES/pGL-3, IFNB/pGL3, and IFNA1/pGL-3; the transfection procedures were described previously (35Lin R. Beauparlant P. Makris C. Meloche S. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1401-1409Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At 24 h after transfections, reporter gene activities were measured by the Dual-luciferase reporter assay following the instructions in the Promega Technical Manual. To confirm expression of the transgenes, equivalent amounts of whole cell extract (20 μg) were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) in a 10% polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to Hybond transfer membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in a buffer containing 30 mmTris, 200 mm glycine, and 20% methanol for 1 h. The membrane was blocked by incubation in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% dried milk for 1 h and then probed with monocolonal Flag antibody M2 (Sigma) in 5% milk-phosphate-buffered saline at a dilution of 1:3000. These incubations were done at 4 °C overnight or at room temperature for 1–3 h. After four 10-min washes with phosphate-buffered saline, membranes were reacted with a peroxidase-conjugated secondary goat anti-mouse antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at a dilution of 1:2500. The reaction was then visualized with the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as recommended by the manufacturer. Whole cell extracts were prepared 48 h after transfection with 5 μg of expression plasmids as indicated in individual experiments. Cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 60 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 ng/μl chymostatin, and 0.25 μm microcystin. Equivalent amounts of whole cell extract (20 μg) were assayed for IRF-7 binding in gel shift analysis using32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide corresponding to the PRDI-PRDIII region of the IFNB promoter (′-GAAAACTGAAAGGGAGAAGTGAAAGTG-3′) Complexes were formed by incubating the probe with 20 μg each of the whole cell extracts or indicated amounts of recombinant proteins. The binding mixture (20 μl) contained 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 10 μg/μl of bovine serum albumin; 62.5 μg/ml of poly(dI-dC) was added to reduce nonspecific binding. After a 20-min incubation with probe, extracts were loaded on a 5% polyacrylamide gel (60:1 cross-link) prepared in 0.5× Tris-boric acid-EDTA buffer. After running at 100–150 V for 3 h, the gel was dried and exposed to a Kodak film at −70oc overnight. To demonstrate the specificity of protein·DNA complex formation, the cell extract was preincubated with anti-Flag antibody M2 (Sigma). 293 cells were cotransfected with expression plasmids encoding wild type or mutated IRF-3 and IRF-7 as indicated. Whole cell extracts (200–300 μg) were prepared from co-transfected cells, and the extracts were incubated with 2 μl of anti-Myc antibody 9E10 cross-linked to 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed five times with lysis buffer and eluted by boiling the beads for 3 min in 1× SDS-sample buffer. Eluted proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to Hybond transfer membrane, and incubated with anti-IRF-3, anti-Flag, or anti-Myc antibody (1:1000–1:3000). Immunocomplexes were detected by ECL, a chemiluminescence-based system. To analyze the subcellular localization of wild type and mutated forms of IRF-7 proteins in uninfected and virus infected cells, the GFP-IRF-7 expression plasmids (5 μg) were transiently transfected into COS-7 cells by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method. For virus infection, transfected cells were infected with Sendai virus (80 hemagglutinating units/ml for 2 h) at 24 h post-transfection. GFP fluorescence was analyzed in living cells with a Leica fluorescence microscope using a 40× objective. The IRF-7 transcription factor shares many structural features with the IRF-3 factor, including the N-terminal DNA binding domain common to all IRF members, a putative IRF association domain in the C-terminal half of the protein, and a serine-rich domain located at the C-terminal end of the molecule between aa 471 and 487, which is the target of virus-inducible phosphorylation (26Marié I. Durbin J.E. Levy D.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6660-6669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Sato M. Hata N. Asagiri M. Nakaya T. Taniguchi T. Tanaka N. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Because of the involvement of IRF-7 in the activation of delayed-type IFNA genes (26Marié I. Durbin J.E. Levy D.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6660-6669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we sought to analyze the structural features of IRF-7 as they relate to transactivation. We initially determined whether IRF-7 contained a long atypical C-terminal transactivation domain as described for IRF-3 (34Lin R. Mamane Y. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2465-2474Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). To localize the putative IRF-7 transactivation domain, wild type IRF-7 and a series of IRF-7 deletion mutations were generated, co-transfected into 293 HEK cells together with an IFNA1 promoter construct, and examined for their ability to stimulate IFNA1 reporter gene activity (Fig.1 A). Co-expression of IRF-7 alone without virus induction resulted in a 40-fold stimulation of IFNA1 promoter activity. Deletion of 28 (IRF-7-(475)) or 97 (IRF-7-(416)) amino acids from the C-terminal region of IRF-7 reduced transactivation activity modestly to 15- and 24-fold, respectively, whereas cotransfection of IRF-7(aa 380) restored transcription to 55-fold. Further deletion to aa 340 and 246 resulted in a form of IRF-7 that activated transcription 100-fold. The next deletions to aa 200 and 150 essentially eliminated IRF-7 transactivation of the IFNA1 promoter. Next, the effect of Sendai virus infection on IRF-7-stimulated IFNA1 expression was determined. In 293 cells cotransfected with vector alone, virus infection activated IFNA1 luciferase reporter gene activity up to 5.5-fold. Cotransfection of full-length IRF-7 enhanced virus-induced expression to 365-fold, whereas deletion of the C-terminal region of IRF-7 to a protein of 475, 416, or 380 aa totally abrogated this activity (Fig. 1 A). Although deletion of IRF-7 to a protein of 340 or 246 aa resulted in a 100–120-fold stimulation of transcription, these deletions were not further activated by virus infection (Fig. 1 A). An internal deletion of IRF-7, which removed aa 247–467, activated transcription more than 1500-fold, to a level of activity that was much higher than seen with wild type IRF-7 irrespective of virus induction (Fig. 1 B). When a smaller deletion (Δ247–415) of this region was generated, IRF-7 activity was reduced more than 100-fold, indicating that the region between aa 416 and 467 was an important component of the inhibitory domain. The next construct, Δ247–372, further decreased activity, indicating that the full C-terminal inhibitory region may be located between aa 372 and 467. Other smaller deletions of this region (Δ247–335 and Δ247–305) had no further effect on IRF-7 activity, because virtually all of the transactivation capacity of IRF-7 was blocked. Interestingly, analysis of the small internal deletion Δ247–278 revealed that both basal level (13-fold) and virus-inducible activity (>200-fold) were significantly restored to IRF-7, which indicated that the region between aa 278 and 305 contributed to virus inducibility. Deletion of the constitutive activation domain (Δ151–246) resulted in an IRF-7 with weak activity (1.7-fold) but with about 10-fold inducibility by virus (Fig.1 B) because of the presence of the C-terminal composite element. Similar results were also obtained with these constructs in other cell types including COS-7, HEC1B, and U937 with RANTES, IFNB, and IFNA promoters (data not shown). This deletion analysis suggested a complex structure to the C-terminal region of IRF-7, with a constitutive activation domain located between aa 150 and 246, an accessory inducibility region at the very end of IRF-7 between aa 468 and 503, and an inhibitory region adjacent to the C-terminal end, located between aa 341 and 467, which interferes with transactivation. Furthermore, a virus-activated domain (VAD), which increases basal and virus inducible activity, is located between aa 278 and 305. Like IRF-3, IRF-7 contains a serine-rich domain located in the C-terminal region between aa 471 and 487 (Fig.2 A) that is a target for virus-induced phosphorylation (26Marié I. Durbin J.E. Levy D.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6660-6669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Sato M. Hata N. Asagiri M. Nakaya T. Taniguchi T. Tanaka N. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). In the case of IRF-3, substitution of the Ser-Thr residues in the region aa 396–405 with the phosphomimetic Asp generated a constitutively active form of IRF-3 that activated the IFNB promoter over 100-fold (16Lin R. Heylbroeck C. Pitha P.M. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2986-2996Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). Given the sequence similarities between the C-terminal ends of IRF-3 and IRF-7 and the effect of C-terminal deletion on virus-induced IRF-7 activity (Fig. 1), we sought to generate a constitutively active form of IRF-7 by phosphomimetic amino acid substitution of different C-terminal serines (Fig. 2 A). Substitution of Ser-477 and Ser-479 with the phosphomimetic Asp resulted in a form of IRF-7 that activated the IFNA promoter up to 200-fold (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, the substitution of Ser-471 and Ser-472 or Ser-483 and Ser-487 with Asp dramatically reduced the transactivation activity of IRF-7. Introduction of the phosphomimetic at other serine sites (Asp-475 and Asp-476, or Asp-475, Asp-476, Asp-483, and Asp-487, into IRF-7(S477D/S479D), IRF-7(S475D/S477D/S479D), and IRF-7(S475D/S476D/S477D/S479D/S483D/S487D)) did not further augment the transactivation activity of IRF-7(S477D/S479D) (Fig.2 B). The transactivation activity of these constitutively active forms of IRF-7 (S477D/S479D), IRF-7(S475D/S477D/S479D), and IRF-7(S475D/S476D/S477D/S479D/S483D/S487D) was further stimulated by virus infection (Fig. 2 B). It is possible that sequences within the C-terminal region and the VAD (aa 278–305) are required for maximal response to virus infection. As predicted, substitution of Ser-477 and Ser-479 with alanine resulted in a form of IRF-7 that was unable to respond to virus infection (Fig.2 B). Together, these results are reminiscent of IRF-3 in that multiple serine residues were identified that affected IRF activity. Mutation of some residues caused a loss of IRF-7 activity that was not restored by mutation to a phosphomimetic amino acid, whereas other serine residues were inactivated by alanine substitution but constitutively activated by phosphomimetic substitution (34Lin R. Mamane Y. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2465-2474Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). IRF-7 is localized predominantly in the cytoplasm, and viral infection stimulates IRF-7 translocation to the nucleus (28Au W.C. Moore P.A. LaFleur D.W. Tombal B. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29210-29217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). To investigate the effect of deletion and point mutations on IRF-7 localization, different forms of IRF-7 were linked to GFP, transfected into COS-7 cells, and examined for Sendai virus-induced changes in subcellular localization (Fig.3). IRF-7 localized mainly to the cytoplasm in uninfected cells, and Sendai virus infection resulted in IRF-7 translocation to the nucleus within 8 h in ∼50% of the cells (Fig. 3 A). The IRF-7 form lacking the C-terminal end (aa 1–246) was constitutively localized to the nucleus (Fig.3 B), suggesting that a nuclear localization sequence may be present in the N-terminal region of IRF-7 between aa 1 and 246. Furthermore, any of the IRF-7 forms lacking the region between aa 416 and 467, including IRF-7(Δ247–467) and IRF-7(Δ416–467), localized to the nucleus in uninfected cells (Fig. 3, C andD). Within this region, a leucine-rich region was identified (448LVLVKLEPWLCRVHL462) that represents a consensus for a nuclear export sequence. Other deletions (IRF-7(Δ247–415) or IRF-7"

One reason for muscle wasting relates to a decrease in food intake. This study addressed the role of leucine as a regulator of protein breakdown in mouse C2C12 myotubes and aimed to determine which cellular responses regulate the process. Determination of the rate of protein breakdown indicated that leucine is one key regulator of this process in myotubes because starvation for this amino acid is responsible for 30–40% of the total increase generated by total amino acid starvation. Leucine restriction rapidly accelerates the rate of protein breakdown (+11 to 15% (p < 0.001) after 1 h of starvation) in a dose-dependent manner. By using various inhibitors, evidence is provided that acceleration of protein catabolism results mainly from an induction of autophagy, activation of lysosome-dependent proteolysis, without modification of mRNA levels encoding the lysosomal cathepsins B, L, or D. Those results suggest that autophagy is an essential cellular response for increasing protein breakdown in muscle following food deprivation. Induction of autophagy precedes a decrease in global protein synthesis (−20% to −30% (p < 0.001)) that occurs after 3 h of leucine starvation. Inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activity does not abolish the effect of leucine starvation and the level of phosphorylated ribosomal S6 protein is not affected by leucine withdrawal. These latter data provide clear evidence that the mTOR signaling pathway is not involved in the mediation of leucine effects on both protein synthesis and degradation in C2C12 myotubes.

Protein degradation is performed by elaborate proteolytic systems located in multiple compartments. One characterized enzymatic system is the proteasome mainly localized in the cytosol. It is a multisubunit proteolytic complex composed of a central multicatalytic core, the 20 S proteasome, which can be associated to different regulatory complexes, especially the 19 S regulator (or PA700) to form the 26 S proteasome (1Tanaka K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 537-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). One way for the targeting of substrates to the 26 S proteasome is their conjugation to ubiquitin (2Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6821) Google Scholar). Intracellular protein degradation also occurs in the lysosome, enriched in multiple hydrolytic enzymes, especially the cathepsins (3Kirschke H. Barrett A.J. Glaumann H. Ballard F.J. Chemistry of Lysosomal Proteases; Lysosomes: Their Role in Protein Breakdown. Academic Press, New York1987: 193-238Google Scholar). The accession of substrates to the lysosome can be achieved by macroautophagy. During this process, cytosolic components are enclosed in structures generated from portions of the endoplasmic reticulum free of ribosomes, named autophagosomes, which then fuse with the lysosome (4Dunn J., W.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 139-143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). The process of autophagy started to be studied at the molecular level in yeast with the cloning of a series of genes, by complementation of autophagy-defective mutants (5Tsukada M. Ohsumi Y. FEBS Lett. 1993; 333: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (1389) Google Scholar). In particular, a new conjugation system involved in the formation of autophagosomes has been characterized (6Mizushima N. Noda T. Yoshimori T. Tanaka Y. Ishii T. George M.D. Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi M. Ohsumi Y. Nature. 1998; 395: 395-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1267) Google Scholar). It is similar to the ubiquitin conjugation system, but involves a set of distinct, non-homologous proteins, named Apg(s) (7Tanida I. Mizushima N. Kiyooka M. Ohsumi M. Ueno T. Ohsumi Y. Kominami E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1367-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 8Shintani T. Mizushima N. Ogawa Y. Matsuura A. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5234-5241Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Those proteins are conserved in humans, and their genes are expressed in many tissues, including liver and skeletal muscle (9Mizushima N. Sugita H. Yoshimori T. Ohsumi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33889-33892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). In the liver, autophagy is an important physiological response and some amino acids can regulate this sequestration pathway. Indeed, it has been shown that after amino acid withdrawal, liver perfusion with a group of eight amino acids leads to an inhibition of autophagy at the sequestration step (10Mortimore G.E. Poso A.R. Lardeux B.R. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1989; 5: 49-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 11Blommaart E.F. Luiken J.J. Meijer A.J. Histochem. J. 1997; 29: 365-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Among them, leucine, phenylalanine, and tyrosine are the most potent to inhibit the formation of autophagosomes. In skeletal muscle, amino acids, together with hormones, are key regulators of protein metabolism (12Rooyackers O.E. Nair K.S. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1997; 17: 457-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 13Sugden P.H. Fuller S.J. Biochem. J. 1991; 273: 21-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 14Grizard J. Dardevet D.

The importance of branched chain amino acids, especially leucine, in the regulation of mRNA translation has been demonstrated in animal models (15Buse M.G. Reid S.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1975; 56: 1250-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar, 16Hong S.O. Layman D.K. J. Nutr. 1984; 114: 1204-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Recentin vitro studies on rat L6 myoblasts revealed that leucine stimulates global protein synthesis through the regulation of the initiation factor eIF2B1(17Kimball S.R. Horetsky R.L. Jefferson L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30945-30953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In addition, leucine activates the signal transduction pathway involving mTOR (18Kimball S.R. Shantz L.M. Horetsky R.L. Jefferson L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11647-11652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The mTOR kinase regulates eIF4E availability via the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 (19Beretta L. Gingras A.C. Svitkin Y.V. Hall M.N. Sonenberg N.

Shin T.B. Schreiber S.L. Nature. 1995; 377: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). The mTOR kinase also regulates yeast autophagy (21Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Biol.

Increased muscle protein breakdown associated with starvation generates free amino acids which enter the circulation. These amino acids supply peripheral tissues to maintain vital functions, from de novoprotein synthesis to hepatic gluconeogenesis. Severe diseases, like cancer, trauma, or sepsis, are also characterized by a loss of skeletal muscle proteins that provide amino acids for wound healing and synthesis of acute phase proteins (23Grimble R.F. Clin. Sci. 1996; 91: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 24Hulsewe K.W. Deutz N.E. de Blaauw I. van der Hulst R.R. von Meyenfeldt M.M. Soeters P.B. Proc. Nutr.

The involvement of the different proteolytic systems in muscle wasting has been extensively studied in various animal models (25Attaix D. Taillandier D. Bittar E.E. Rivett A.J. Intracellular Protein Degradation. JAI Press Inc., Greenwich, CT1998: 235-266Google Scholar). The ATP-proteasome-dependent pathway is activated in muscle of septic or cachectic animals (26Voisin L.

Physiol. 1995; 268: E996-E1006PubMed Google Scholar). In models of fasting, this proteolytic pathway is activated as well, as a consequence of the induction of stress hormones like glucocorticoids that oppose the anabolic effects of insulin (30Wing S.S. Goldberg A.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: E668-E676PubMed Google Scholar). Muscle lysosomal-dependent proteolysis is also elevated during fasting (30Wing S.S. Goldberg A.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: E668-E676PubMed Google Scholar), and increased expression of mRNAs encoding some cathepsins has been observed in chronic septic phase (26Voisin L. Breuille D. Combaret L.

Boirie Y. Ralliere C. Taillandier D. Aurousseau E. Schoeffler P. Arnal M. Attaix D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2714-2718Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). So far, few studies have addressed how the major intracellular proteolytic systems react to changes in the levels of specific amino acids independently of hormonal regulation. In view of the evidence that leucine regulates skeletal muscle protein synthesis, and the possible regulation of autophagy and protein synthesis through common signaling pathways, we addressed herein the following issues. Using the C2C12 mouse muscle cell line, we first established and characterized the contribution of leucine in the regulation of protein breakdown; second, we determined which cellular response(s), autophagy, and proteolytic system(s) are regulated by amino acids or leucine availability; third, we studied the involvement of the mTOR pathway in the adaptive response to leucine depletion. Evidence is given here for leucine as an essential regulator of protein breakdown in muscle, and the induction of autophagy as a cellular adaptation responsible for the increased lysosomal-dependent protein breakdown measured after amino acid starvation. Moreover, we demonstrate that leucine starvation regulates autophagy and protein synthesis through an mTOR-independent signaling pathway. The C2C12 mouse muscle cell line was from the ATCC. The C2C12 cells (30 × 103cells/cm2) were plated in 24-well dishes and grown for one day in DMEM containing 4.5 g/liter glucose, sodium pyruvate (1 mm), gentamycin (10 mg/liter), and 10% fetal calf serum. Fusion and differentiation of myoblasts into myotubes was then induced by replacing fetal calf serum in the medium with 5% horse serum (HS) for 2 days and then 2% HS for 2 more days. After 5 days, a fusion index of 70–80% was generally achieved. At day 4 of differentiation, myotubes were incubated for 18 h (0.5 ml of medium/well) in differentiation medium containing 2% HS and 7 μCi ofl-[35S]Met/ml. Cells were rinsed once with culture medium. During the successive chase periods, cells were incubated with either DMEM/F12 (Sigma), medium lacking leucine prepared from DMEM/F12 base medium (Sigma), or medium lacking all amino acids (Life Technologies, Inc.). Each medium was supplemented with 2% dialyzed HS and 2 mml-Met. Cells were first incubated for 1 h in complete medium as a control for identicalKd calculated as described below. A second chase was then performed during 3 h and eventually followed by additional ones performed with fresh medium for 10–21 h. The different culture media and chase periods used are indicated in the figure legends. Aliquots of culture medium (20 μl) were taken at different times during the successive chase periods. Proteins were precipitated at 4 °C with trichloroacetic acid (17% final) in the presence of 5 μg of bovine serum albumin. At the end of the chase, cells were rinsed once in PBS and also precipitated at 4 °C in 10% trichloroacetic acid. DNA and protein content as well as the residual radioactivity of cells were determined as described in Ref. 32Rehfeldt C. Walther K. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 251: 294-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar. Protein degradation was represented in two different manners: 1)l-[35S]Met release (percentage of total incorporated radioactivity) as a function of time (total radioactivity is the sum of the residual radioactivity of the cells and the trichloroacetic acid-soluble and insoluble radioactivities at different time points); and 2) Kd increase expressed as a percentage of variation relative to control during the time-course experiment. The rate of protein degradation, Kd, that represents the percentage of degraded protein per h, was determined from the slope of ln(A0/A) as a function of time (formula Kd ×t = ln(A0/A)), where A0 is the total incorporatedl-[35S]Met during the 18 h of labeling and A is the remaining l-[35S]Met at time t. For cells cultured in complete medium, the percentage of protein degraded per hour (Kd) in all separate experiments equals 3.2 ± 0.6. Statistically significant differences were confirmed using Student's t test (n = 6). The following inhibitors were used for blocking the different proteolytic pathways. 3-Methyladenine (10 mm) inhibits autophagy, concanamycin A (1 μm) blocks the lysosomal proton pump and inhibits lysosome-dependent proteolysis, and lactacystin (2 μm) irreversibly inhibits proteasome enzymatic activities. Cells were incubated in various culture media for a given time as indicated in the figure legends. During the last 1 h, l-[35S]Met was added (2 μCi/well for a 24-well plate). Cells were rinsed once in PBS and precipitated at 4 °C in 10% trichloroacetic acid. DNA and protein content, as well as incorporatedl-[35S]Met, were determined as described in Ref. 32Rehfeldt C. Walther K. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 251: 294-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar. The rate of protein synthesis was calculated from the trichloroacetic acid-insoluble radioactivity incorporated per hour and per microgram of protein. Results were expressed as relative decreases in l-[35S]Met incorporation compared with 100% of the controls. Target DNAs were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using appropriate oligonucleotides, purified and denatured (95 °C for 10 min) before dotting on Hybond N+ membrane (50 ng for each cDNA). Dotted DNA was cross-linked by UV irradiation. Total RNA was extracted using guanidium thiocyanate (33Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63084) Google Scholar). A synthetic mRNA of Arabidopsis thalianacytochromec554 (cDNA cloned in pHD-1 vector (kindly provided by H. Hofte, INRA Versailles, France)) was synthesized from the T3 promoter using the RiboMax large scale production system (Promega). Following oligo(dT) annealing, 15 μg of total RNA were reverse-transcribed for 2 h at 42 °C with Superscript II (Life Technologies, Inc.) in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP. c554 mRNA was added to the reverse transcription reaction (0.25% of estimated mRNA) for normalization and quantification after hybridization. Following reverse transcription, total RNA was degraded by NaOH treatment and the complex probe purified by gel filtration on G50. Pre-hybridization (24 h) and hybridization (48 h) were performed at 68 °C in 5× SSC, 5× Denhardt's reagent, 0.5% SDS, sonicated DNA (100 μg/ml), and membranes were washed at 68 °C (one in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS; one in 0.5× SSC, 0.1% SDS; one in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS). Hybridization signals were detected using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) and quantified using ImageQuant software. C2C12 myoblasts were cultured on 60-mm plates and differentiated as described for 24-well plates. At day 5, an 8-h time course was performed using different culture media as indicated in the figure legends. Medium lacking all amino acids was supplemented with l-Met to reproduce the conditions used during catabolism measurement. Myotubes were scraped and disrupted in 150 μl of RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm NaF, 2 mm Na3VO4, 0.1 mm okadaic acid, 25 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 pg/ml leupeptin). Soluble proteins were recovered after a 10-min centrifugation (12,000 × g), and their concentration determined using BCA reagent (34Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18503) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of protein were heated 10 min at 90 °C and analyzed in 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206602) Google Scholar), and then transferred to Hybond C. The membranes were blocked (0.2% nonfat dry milk in PBS), exposed to anti-S6P antiserum, washed and exposed to an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin. Fluorescent immunoconjugates were revealed using the ECF detection reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and detected using a PhosphorImager and quantified using ImageQuant software. As leucine is a key regulator of protein synthesis in muscle, we aimed to determine whether it was also a regulator of protein breakdown in this tissue. Moreover, in order to estimate the relative contribution of leucine in the regulation of protein metabolism in muscle cells, the effect of its depletion was compared with that of total amino acids depletion. During a 24-h time-course experiment, the lack of amino acids or leucine in the culture medium induced a higher release ofl-[35S]Met as compared with control (Fig.1 A). The increase in protein breakdown for cells exposed to medium lacking all amino acids was between 20% and 35% (p < 0.001), compared with an 11–15% (p < 0.001) increase when cells were leucine-starved. In the same cells, the protein/DNA ratio was diminished by 9–15% after 24 h of leucine starvation compare with a 15–18% decrease for total amino acid starvation (Fig.1 B). These results demonstrate that leucine may be one key regulator of protein breakdown in muscle cells as starvation for this amino acid is responsible for 30–40% of the increase in protein breakdown generated by total amino acid starvation. The role of leucine on muscle protein breakdown was further characterized by: 1) performing short time-course kinetics, 2) studying the effect of leucine re-supplementation, and 3) performing a leucine dose response. A 3-h time-course experiment showed that leucine starvation induced an acceleration of l-[35S]Met release compared with control, as early as 20–30 min (+7% (p < 0.05)) to reach the maximal increase of 11–15% (p < 0.001) after 1 h (Fig. 2 A). To determine whether this response could be reversed, acceleration of protein breakdown was first induced by leucine starvation during 8 h and medium was then replaced by complete medium containing 420 μm leucine (Fig. 2 B). The accelerated protein breakdown in leucine-replenished cells compared with cells in complete medium was still significant after 15 min but no more after 30 min. In order to assess whether the effect of leucine starvation was dose-dependent, a time course experiment for protein breakdown with different concentrations of leucine was performed. At 140 or 210 μm leucine, which corresponds to average physiological plasma concentrations of this amino acid (36Adibi S.A. Modesto T.A. Morse E.L. Amin P.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1973; 225: 408-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 37Bergstrom J. Furst P. Vinnars E. Clin. Sci. 1990; 79: 331-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), no difference in protein breakdown was measured compared with cells cultured with 420 μm of leucine. At 25 μm, leucine increased protein breakdown to almost the same extent as in leucine-starved cells. At 70 or 50 μm leucine, the increase in protein breakdown was always below that measured in leucine-starved cells, but significant with an average of 10% (Fig.2 C). Altogether, those results demonstrate that proteolysis in myotubes is sharply regulated by leucine availability in a concentration-dependent manner. In addition to characterize the effect of leucine on protein breakdown, we measured its effect on protein synthesis by the determination ofl-[35S]Met incorporation normalized to protein content (Fig. 2 D). A time-course experiment indicated that leucine starvation started to decrease global protein synthesis after 3 h to reach a maximum of 20–30% after 8 h or more. The same result was observed with 25 μm leucine in the culture medium, whereas an 8-h exposure to 70 μmleucine did not alter protein synthesis (data not shown). In the liver, it has clearly been shown that amino acids regulate autophagy (10Mortimore G.E. Poso A.R. Lardeux B.R. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1989; 5: 49-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). No study to date has examined whether autophagy could be activated in muscle cells in response to amino acid limitation. Then, the effect of 3-methyladenine, which inhibits the early stages of autophagosome formation (38Seglen P.O. Gordon P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 1889-1892Crossref PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar), was studied (Fig. 3 A). The presence of the inhibitor in control cells did not significantly modify the rate of protein breakdown, suggesting a lack or low level of basal autophagy in C2C12 myotubes. When added together with medium lacking all amino acids (Fig. 3 A, 1) or leucine (Fig.3 A, 2), 3-methyladenine prevented the protein breakdown from increasing. As proteins sequestrated by autophagy are degraded in the lysosome, the preferential involvement of lysosome in amino acid regulation of proteolysis was confirmed by using inhibitors of either lysosome- or proteasome-dependent proteolytic pathways. The presence of the lysosome inhibitor concanamycin A in control cells caused a 23–27% (p < 0.001) decrease in proteolysis (Fig.3 B, 1). When added together with medium lacking all amino acids, concanamycin A prevented the increase in protein breakdown (Fig. 3 B, 1). The presence of lactacystin in control cells also decreased the rate of basal protein breakdown (∼45% (p < 0.001)) (Fig. 3 B,2). When added together with medium lacking all amino acids (Fig. 3 B, 2) or leucine (data not shown), lactacystin did not prevent or reduce the increase of protein breakdown. Altogether, these results suggest that amino acid withdrawal induces autophagy and that the measured acceleration of protein breakdown is lysosome- but not proteasome-dependent. Because amino acid limitation can affect gene expression at the transcriptional level (39Jousse C. Bruhat A. Fafournoux P. Curr. Opin. Clin. Nutr. Metab. Care. 1999; 2: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), we studied the effect of amino acids or leucine starvation on mRNA levels of some components of the proteolytic systems. In order to be consistent with experiments measuring the rate of protein degradation, medium lacking all amino acids was supplemented with methionine. As shown in Fig.4, the increase in the rate of protein breakdown following amino acid starvation is not correlated with an elevation of mRNAs encoding the cysteine proteinases cathepsin B and L or the aspartyl proteinase cathepsin D. In addition, there is no modification in the level of mRNAs encoding ubiquitin or some subunits of the 26 S proteasome. In general, there is a tendency for a slight decrease in mRNA levels for all the tested targets. The overall data suggest that amino acid availability does not exert an effect on proteolysis by modifying gene expression of some major components of the lysosome- and proteasome-dependent proteolytic pathways. It has been shown that treatment with rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTOR activity that controls S6 and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation (19Beretta L. Gingras A.C. Svitkin Y.V. Hall M.N. Sonenberg N.

To determine whether it was also the case in our model of leucine starvation in C2C12 myotubes, the effect of rapamycin treatment was first studied. As shown in Fig.5 A, rapamycin induced a 14% (p < 0.001) increase in the protein breakdown as compared with control, together with a 20% decrease in protein synthesis, as shown by l-[35S]Met incorporation performed in independent experiments (data not shown). The response was the same with concentrations of rapamycin comprising between 30 and 200 nm (data not shown). When leucine starvation was combined with rapamycin treatment, there was an additive effect as a 25% increase in protein breakdown was measured as compared with control (Fig. 5 A). This first result suggested the existence of two signaling pathways mediating this response. To verify this hypothesis, two types of experiments were performed (Fig. 5 B). 1) The effect of rapamycin was measured once myotubes had been leucine-starved for 3 h, and 2) the effect of leucine starvation was measured once cells had been incubated for 3 h in the presence of 50 nm rapamycin. The additive effect of both stimuli was still observed. The evidence that leucine starvation induces autophagy in muscle cells via an mTOR-independent pathway was further confirmed by the study of the level of phosphorylated S6 ribosomal protein during an 8-h time-course experiment. This is an index of the p70s6kactivity, known to be under the control of mTOR (20Brown E.J. Beal P.A. Keith C.T. Chen J. Shin T.B. Schreiber S.L. Nature. 1995; 377: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). The level of the protein was also determined in myotubes starved for all amino acids, except methionine to be consistent with experiments measuring the rate of protein degradation. As shown in Fig.6, rapamycin treatment induced a loss of the S6-P protein after a 3-h treatment. This confirms that mTOR signaling pathway is effectively inhibited by rapamycin. Therefore, following rapamycin treatment, the effect of leucine starvation on autophagy cannot signal through mTOR. Moreover, a 3-h leucine starvation (Fig. 6) or a 3-h treatment with 70 μm leucine (data not shown) did not modify significantly the level of S6-P compared with controls, indicating that mTOR signaling pathway is not inhibited. However, both treatments induce autophagy (see Fig.2 C). There was no reduction in the level of S6-P after 0.5 or 1.5 h of amino acid or leucine starvation, which excluded a transient effect on p70s6k activity. This result was not a consequence of the presence of serum. Indeed, the removal of horse serum from the medium concom"

https://openalex.org/W2071981344,"TRAF proteins are major mediators for the cell activation, cell survival, and antiapoptotic functions of the TNF receptor superfamily. They can be recruited to activated TNF receptors either by direct interactions with the receptors or indirectly via the adaptor protein TRADD. We now report the structure of the TRADD-TRAF2 complex, which is highly distinct from receptor-TRAF2 interactions. This interaction is significantly stronger and we show by an in vivo signaling assay that TRAF2 signaling is more readily initiated by TRADD than by direct receptor-TRAF2 interactions. TRADD is specific for TRAF1 and TRAF2, which ensures the recruitment of clAPs for the direct inhibition of caspase activation in the signaling complex. The stronger affinity and unique specificity of the TRADD-TRAF2 interaction are crucial for the suppression of apoptosis and provide a mechanistic basis for the perturbation of TRAF recruitment in sensitizing cell death induction."
https://openalex.org/W2003973797,"The nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway functions to degrade transcripts containing nonsense codons. Transcripts containing mutations that insert an upstream open reading frame (uORF) in the 5'-UTR are degraded through NMD. However, several naturally occurring uORF-containing transcripts are resistant to NMD. Here we demonstrate that the GCN4 and YAP1 mRNAs, which contain uORFs, harbor a stabilizer element (STE) that prevents rapid NMD by interacting with the RNA binding protein Pub1. Conversely, a uORF-containing mRNA that lacks an STE, such as CPA1, is degraded by the NMD pathway. These results indicate that uORFs can play a pivotal role regulating both translation and turnover and that the Pub1p is a critical factor that modulates the stability of uORF-containing transcripts."

In this study, we found that thrombin treatment of microglia induced NO release/inducible nitric-oxide synthase expression, a prominent marker of activation. The effect of thrombin on NO release increased dose-dependently within the range of 5–20 units/ml. In immunoblot analyses, inducible nitric-oxide synthase expression was detected within 9 h after thrombin treatment. This effect of thrombin was significantly reduced by protein kinase C inhibitors, such as Go6976, bisindolylmaleimide, and Ro31-8220. Within 15 min, thrombin activated three subtypes of mitogen-activated protein kinases: extracellular signal-regulated kinase, p38, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase. Inhibition of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway and p38 reduced the NO release of thrombin-treated microglia. Thrombin also activated nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) within 5 min, and N-acetyl cysteine, an inhibitor of NF-κB, reduced NO release. However, thrombin receptor agonist peptide (an agonist of protease activated receptor-1 (PAR-1)), could not mimic the effect of thrombin, and cathepsin G, a PAR-1 inhibitor, did not reduce the effect of thrombin. These results suggest that thrombin can activate microglia via protein kinase C, mitogen-activated protein kinases, and NF-κB but that this occurs independently of PAR-1.

Many studies have reported that activated microglia produce inflammatory mediators such as NO, tumor necrosis factor α, and prostaglandins, factors that affect the onset and progression of brain diseases (1Giulian D. Baker T.J. J. Neurosci. 1986; 6: 2163-2178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Minghetti L. Levi G. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 2690-2698Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 3Lee S.C. Liu W.

Cell Immunol. 1992; 141: 111-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). For example, microglial activation precedes neuronal cell death in ischemia, and profound microglial activation is commonly observed in seriously injured regions of the brain (5Rupalla K. Allegrini P.R. Sauer D. Wiessner C. Acta Neuropathol. 1998; 96: 172-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 6Zhang Z. Chopp M. Powers C. Brain Res. 1997; 744: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Furthermore, neuronal cell death because of ischemia can be reduced by the inhibition of microglial activation (7Yrjanheikki J. Keinanen R. Pellikka M. Hokfelt T. Koistinaho J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15769-15774Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). The risk and progression of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease can also be reduced by anti-inflammatory drugs that suppress microglial activation (8Breitner J.C. Gau B.A. Welsh K.A.

However, it has not been clearly shown how the microglial activation occurs in the injured brain.Thrombin is a well known protease involved in blood coagulation and wound healing. In addition, thrombin seems to have diverse functions in many different types of cells. Thrombin induces proliferation of fibroblasts (10Glenn K.C. Carney D.H. Fenton J.W. Cunningham D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 6609-6616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and smooth muscle cells (11McNamara C.A. Sarembock I.J. Gimple L.W. Fenton J.W. Coughlin S.R. Owens G.K. J. Clin.

Glia. 1997; 21: 244-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Many studies have reported inflammatory functions of thrombin. Thrombin acts as a chemotactic agent for inflammatory cells such as monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils and induces secretion of cytokines from these kinds of cells (15Bizios R. Lai L. Fenton J.W. Malik A.B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1986; 128: 485-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 16Jones A. Geczy C.L. Immunology. 1990; 71: 236-241PubMed Google Scholar, 17Naldini A. Sower L. Bocci V. Meyers B. Carney D.H. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 177: 76-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). More importantly, thrombin injected into a rat brain induces the infiltration of inflammatory cells, brain edema, and reactive gliosis (18Nishino A. Suzuki M. Ohtani H. Motohashi O. Umezawa K. Nagura H. Yoshimoto T. J. Neurotrauma. 1993; 10: 167-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). However, the effect of thrombin on microglial cells has not yet been studied, although microglia are the major immune effector cells in the brain.The intracellular signaling mechanisms activated by thrombin are diverse. In endothelial cells, thrombin activates Src family tyrosine kinases, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) (19Ellis C.A. Malik A.B. Gilchrist A. Hamm H. Sandoval R. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T. Tiruppathi C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13718-13727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar).1 In vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells, thrombin produces reactive oxygen species (ROS) (20Patterson C. Ruef J. Madamanchi N.R. Barry-Lane P. Hu Z. Horaist C. Ballinger C.A. Brasier A.R. Bode C. Runge M.S. J. Biol.

Endothelium. 1998; 6: 113-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In astrocytes, thrombin activates protein kinase C and small GTP-binding protein Rho (14Suidan H.S. Nobes C.D. Hall A. Monard D. Glia. 1997; 21: 244-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 22Bhat N.R. Zhang P. Hogan E.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 165: 417-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar,23Ubl J.J. Reiser G. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1997; 433: 312-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Protease activated receptor-1 (PAR-1) has been reported to serve as a thrombin receptor in many types of cells including platelets, endothelial cells, and astrocytes (24Brass L.F. Molino M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 25Debeir T. Vige X. Benavides J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 323: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In activating PAR-1, thrombin cleaves the extracellular N terminus of this receptor. The newly formed N terminus then binds to the receptor and activates it (26Vu T.K. Hung D.T. Wheaton V.I. Coughlin S.R. Cell. 1991; 64: 1057-1068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2650) Google Scholar). Non-PAR thrombin receptors have also been reported on fibroblasts (27Sower L.E. Payne D.A. Meyers R. Carney D.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 247: 422-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). On these cells, the non-PAR has high affinity for thrombin, and activation of the non-PAR induces expression of genes that are not induced by the activation of PAR-1. However, the intracellular signaling mechanisms linked to non-PAR have not yet been clarified. The results of this study revealed that thrombin induces NO release/iNOS expression in microglia via PKC, MAPK, and NF-κB. However, PAR-1 does not seem to be involved in this function of thrombin.DISCUSSIONThe results in this study indicate that thrombin could be a mediator of brain inflammation, because thrombin induces NO release and iNOS expression in microglia, which are major immune effector cells in the brain. The intracellular signaling mechanisms that mediate the function of thrombin in microglia can be compared with those of other microglial activators. LPS and β-amyloid peptide have been known to be microglial activators. Recently we reported that gangliosides, components of the plasma membrane, could induce microglial activation (35Pyo H. Joe E. Jung S. Lee S.H. Jou I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34584-34589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The microglial activation of thrombin could be achieved via similar intracellular signaling pathways. PKC may thus be the common mediator of microglial activation. PKC inhibitors reduce NO release by microglia treated with LPS (33Hellendall R.P. Ting J.P. J. Neuroimmunol. 1997; 74: 19-29Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 34McMillian M.K. Vainio P.J. Tuominen R.K. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1997; 56: 301-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and gangliosides (data not shown) as they inhibited thrombin-induced NO release. (Fig. 2). Recently, it has been reported that in microglia PKC isoforms, such as α, δ, and ε, are activated by β-amyloid (36Nakai M. Hojo K. Yagi K. Saito N. Taniguchi T. Terashima A. Kawamata T. Hashimoto T. Maeda K. Gschwendt M. Yamamoto H. Miyamoto E. Tanaka C. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1179-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). MAPKs are other common mediators of microglial activation. ERK, p38, and JNK/SAPK are activated by thrombin, LPS, β-amyloid, and gangliosides (28Pyo H. Jou I. Jung S. Hong S. Joe E.H. Neuroreport. 1998; 9: 871-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 35Pyo H. Joe E. Jung S. Lee S.H. Jou I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34584-34589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). However, some discrepancies still exist with regard to the effect of inhibitors of the ERK pathway (PD98059) and p38 (SB203580) on the action of these activators. LPS- and thrombin-induced nitrite production was significantly reduced by PD98059 and SB203580, whereas ganglioside-induced nitrite production was inhibited by PD98059 but not by SB203580 (28Pyo H. Jou I. Jung S. Hong S. Joe E.H. Neuroreport. 1998; 9: 871-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 35Pyo H. Joe E. Jung S. Lee S.H. Jou I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34584-34589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). NF-κB is also a common mediator of microglial activation. Microglial activators, such as β-amyloid, interferon-γ, and gangliosides activate NF-κB (35Pyo H. Joe E. Jung S. Lee S.H. Jou I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34584-34589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 37Bonaiuto C. McDonald P.P. Rossi F. Cassatella M.A. J. Neuroimmunol. 1997; 77: 51-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), and inhibition of NF-κB reduced NO release (35Pyo H. Joe E. Jung S. Lee S.H. Jou I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34584-34589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar).In addition to PKC, MAPK, and NF-κB, Src family tyrosine kinases, PI3-K, and ROS have also been reported to mediate the function of thrombin in many kinds of cells. Thrombin has been known to activate a Src family tyrosine kinase in astrocytes (22Bhat N.R. Zhang P. Hogan E.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 165: 417-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and endothelial cells (19Ellis C.A. Malik A.B. Gilchrist A. Hamm H. Sandoval R. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T. Tiruppathi C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13718-13727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In microglia, however, selective inhibitors of Src family tyrosine kinases, PP2 and lavendustin A, did not inhibit the action of thrombin (data not shown). PI3-K has been known to mediate thrombin-induced proliferation of smooth muscle cells (38Krymskaya V.P. Penn R.B. Orsini M.J. Scott P.H. Plevin R.J. Walker T.R. Eszterhas A.J. Amrani Y. Chilvers E.R. Panettieri R.A.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: L65-L78PubMed Google Scholar), and ROS have been known to induce the expression of chemokines and cell adhesion molecules in endothelial cells, epithelial cells, and lymphoma cells (39Roebuck K.A. Int. J. Mol. Med. 1999; 4: 223-230PubMed Google Scholar, 40Vlahopoulos S. Boldogh I. Casola A. Brasier A.R. Blood. 1999; 94: 1878-1889Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, PI3-K may not be involved in the thrombin effect on microglia, because PI3-K inhibitors, such as wortmannin and LY294002, had little effect on thrombin-induced NO release (data not shown). Although NAC that increases reduced form of glutathione level dose-dependently reduced thrombin-induced NO release (Fig.6), ROS scavengers, such as catalase and superoxide dismutase did not inhibit thrombin-induced nitrite production (data not shown). Thus, ROS that could be removed by these scavengers do not seem to mediate thrombin-induced NO release.PAR-1 has been suggested as a thrombin receptor. In astrocytes and C6 glioma cells, thrombin-induced Ca2+ mobilization is mimicked by TRAP and blocked by cathepsin G (41Ubl J.J. Vohringer C. Reiser G. Neuroscience. 1998; 86: 597-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 42Kaufmann R. Lindschau C. Hoer A. Henklein P. Adomeit A. Haller H. Liebmann C. Oberdisse E. Nowak G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1996; 46: 641-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Activation of platelets could be achieved by both thrombin and TRAP (43Ofosu F.A. Freedman J. Dewar L. Song Y. Fenton J.W. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 283-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, in microglia TRAP did not induce NO release and iNOS mRNA expression (Fig. 7). Furthermore, cathepsin G had no effect on the thrombin-induced NO release (Fig. 8), although the effect of thrombin was reduced by hirudin, which inhibits protease function of thrombin (44Olivier D. Corvera C.U. Steinhoff M Bunnett N.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C1429-C1452Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Grutter M.G. Priestle J.P. Rahuel J. Grossenbacher H. Bode W. Hofsteenge J. Stone S.R.

Haemostasis. 1991; 21 (Suppl. 1): 27-31PubMed Google Scholar) (data not shown). We also tested the effect of prothrombin in the absence of factor VII and X that change prothrombin into thrombin. Prothrombin dose-dependently induced microglial NO release (data not shown). These results suggest that, in microglia, thrombin induces NO release via a PAR-1-independent pathway. Recent studies in other laboratories could support this conclusion. In myoblasts, thrombin protected myoblasts from apoptosis, whereas TRAP did not (47Chinni C. de Niese M.R. Tew D.J. Jenkins A.L. Bottomley S.P. Mackie E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9169-9174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In fibroblasts, TRAP and TP508 (a peptide fragment of thrombin different from TRAP) induced differential patterns of gene expression, suggesting additional nonproteolytic action of thrombin (27Sower L.E. Payne D.A. Meyers R. Carney D.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 247: 422-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, until recently, information regarding thrombin receptors other than PAR-1 has been limited, although PAR-3 and 4 also have been suggested. Therefore, further studies are needed to characterize thrombin receptors in microglia. Microglia are major immune effector cells in the central nervous system, and activation of microglia is a common phenomenon that appears when the brain suffers injury. Many studies have reported that activated microglia produce inflammatory mediators such as NO, tumor necrosis factor α, and prostaglandins, factors that affect the onset and progression of brain diseases (1Giulian D. Baker T.J. J. Neurosci. 1986; 6: 2163-2178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Minghetti L. Levi G. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 2690-2698Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 3Lee S.C. Liu W.

Cell Immunol. 1992; 141: 111-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). For example, microglial activation precedes neuronal cell death in ischemia, and profound microglial activation is commonly observed in seriously injured regions of the brain (5Rupalla K. Allegrini P.R. Sauer D. Wiessner C. Acta Neuropathol. 1998; 96: 172-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 6Zhang Z. Chopp M. Powers C. Brain Res. 1997; 744: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Furthermore, neuronal cell death because of ischemia can be reduced by the inhibition of microglial activation (7Yrjanheikki J. Keinanen R. Pellikka M. Hokfelt T. Koistinaho J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15769-15774Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). The risk and progression of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease can also be reduced by anti-inflammatory drugs that suppress microglial activation (8Breitner J.C. Gau B.A. Welsh K.A.

Thrombin is a well known protease involved in blood coagulation and wound healing. In addition, thrombin seems to have diverse functions in many different types of cells.

Glia. 1997; 21: 244-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Many studies have reported inflammatory functions of thrombin. Thrombin acts as a chemotactic agent for inflammatory cells such as monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils and induces secretion of cytokines from these kinds of cells (15Bizios R. Lai L. Fenton J.W. Malik A.B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1986; 128: 485-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 16Jones A. Geczy C.L. Immunology. 1990; 71: 236-241PubMed Google Scholar, 17Naldini A. Sower L. Bocci V. Meyers B. Carney D.H. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 177: 76-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). More importantly, thrombin injected into a rat brain induces the infiltration of inflammatory cells, brain edema, and reactive gliosis (18Nishino A. Suzuki M. Ohtani H. Motohashi O. Umezawa K. Nagura H. Yoshimoto T. J. Neurotrauma. 1993; 10: 167-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). However, the effect of thrombin on microglial cells has not yet been studied, although microglia are the major immune effector cells in the brain. The intracellular signaling mechanisms activated by thrombin are diverse. In endothelial cells, thrombin activates Src family tyrosine kinases, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) (19Ellis C.A. Malik A.B. Gilchrist A. Hamm H. Sandoval R. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T. Tiruppathi C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13718-13727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar).1 In vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells, thrombin produces reactive oxygen species (ROS) (20Patterson C. Ruef J. Madamanchi N.R. Barry-Lane P. Hu Z. Horaist C. Ballinger C.A. Brasier A.R. Bode C. Runge M.S. J. Biol.

Endothelium. 1998; 6: 113-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In astrocytes, thrombin activates protein kinase C and small GTP-binding protein Rho (14Suidan H.S. Nobes C.D. Hall A. Monard D. Glia. 1997; 21: 244-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 22Bhat N.R. Zhang P. Hogan E.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 165: 417-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar,23Ubl J.J. Reiser G. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1997; 433: 312-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Protease activated receptor-1 (PAR-1) has been reported to serve as a thrombin receptor in many types of cells including platelets, endothelial cells, and astrocytes (24Brass L.F. Molino M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 25Debeir T. Vige X. Benavides J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 323: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In activating PAR-1, thrombin cleaves the extracellular N terminus of this receptor. The newly formed N terminus then binds to the receptor and activates it (26Vu T.K. Hung D.T. Wheaton V.I. Coughlin S.R. Cell. 1991; 64: 1057-1068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2650) Google Scholar). Non-PAR thrombin receptors have also been reported on fibroblasts (27Sower L.E. Payne D.A. Meyers R. Carney D.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 247: 422-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). On these cells, the non-PAR has high affinity for thrombin, and activation of the non-PAR induces expression of genes that are not induced by the activation of PAR-1. However, the intracellular signaling mechanisms linked to non-PAR have not yet been clarified. The results of this study revealed that thrombin induces NO release/iNOS expression in microglia via PKC, MAPK, and NF-κB. However, PAR-1 does not seem to be involved in this function of thrombin. DISCUSSIONThe results in this study indicate that thrombin could be a mediator of brain inflammation, because thrombin induces NO release and iNOS expression in microglia, which are major immune effector cells in the brain. The intracellular signaling mechanisms that mediate the function of thrombin in microglia can be compared with those of other microglial activators. LPS and β-amyloid peptide have been known to be microglial activators. Recently we reported that gangliosides, components of the plasma membrane, could induce microglial activation (35Pyo H. Joe E. Jung S. Lee S.H. Jou I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34584-34589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The microglial activation of thrombin could be achieved via similar intracellular signaling pathways. PKC may thus be the common mediator of microglial activation. PKC inhibitors reduce NO release by microglia treated with LPS (33Hellendall R.P. Ting J.P. J. Neuroimmunol. 1997; 74: 19-29Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 34McMillian M.K. Vainio P.J. Tuominen R.K. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1997; 56: 301-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and gangliosides (data not shown) as they inhibited thrombin-induced NO release. (Fig. 2). Recently, it has been reported that in microglia PKC isoforms, such as α, δ, and ε, are activated by β-amyloid (36Nakai M. Hojo K. Yagi K. Saito N. Taniguchi T. Terashima A. Kawamata T. Hashimoto T. Maeda K. Gschwendt M. Yamamoto H. Miyamoto E. Tanaka C. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1179-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). MAPKs are other common mediators of microglial activation. ERK, p38, and JNK/SAPK are activated by thrombin, LPS, β-amyloid, and gangliosides (28Pyo H. Jou I. Jung S. Hong S. Joe E.H. Neuroreport. 1998; 9: 871-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 35Pyo H. Joe E. Jung S. Lee S.H. Jou I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34584-34589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). However, some discrepancies still exist with regard to the effect of inhibitors of the ERK pathway (PD98059) and p38 (SB203580) on the action of these activators. LPS- and thrombin-induced nitrite production was significantly reduced by PD98059 and SB203580, whereas ganglioside-induced nitrite production was inhibited by PD98059 but not by SB203580 (28Pyo H. Jou I. Jung S. Hong S. Joe E.H. Neuroreport. 1998; 9: 871-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 35Pyo H. Joe E. Jung S. Lee S.H. Jou I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34584-34589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). NF-κB is also a common mediator of microglial activation. Microglial activators, such as β-amyloid, interferon-γ, and gangliosides activate NF-κB (35Pyo H. Joe E. Jung S. Lee S.H. Jou I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34584-34589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 37Bonaiuto C. McDonald P.P. Rossi F. Cassatella M.A. J. Neuroimmunol. 1997; 77: 51-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), and inhibition of NF-κB reduced NO release (35Pyo H. Joe E. Jung S. Lee S.H. Jou I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34584-34589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar).In addition to PKC, MAPK, and NF-κB, Src family tyrosine kinases, PI3-K, and ROS have also been reported to mediate the function of thrombin in many kinds of cells. Thrombin has been known to activate a Src family tyrosine kinase in astrocytes (22Bhat N.R. Zhang P. Hogan E.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 165: 417-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and endothelial cells (19Ellis C.A. Malik A.B. Gilchrist A. Hamm H. Sandoval R. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T. Tiruppathi C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13718-13727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In microglia, however, selective inhibitors of Src family tyrosine kinases, PP2 and lavendustin A, did not inhibit the action of thrombin (data not shown). PI3-K has been known to mediate thrombin-induced proliferation of smooth muscle cells (38Krymskaya V.P. Penn R.B. Orsini M.J. Scott P.H. Plevin R.J. Walker T.R. Eszterhas A.J. Amrani Y. Chilvers E.R. Panettieri R.A.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: L65-L78PubMed Google Scholar), and ROS have been known to induce the expression of chemokines and cell adhesion molecules in endothelial cells, epithelial cells, and lymphoma cells (39Roebuck K.A. Int. J. Mol. Med. 1999; 4: 223-230PubMed Google Scholar, 40Vlahopoulos S. Boldogh I. Casola A. Brasier A.R. Blood. 1999; 94: 1878-1889Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, PI3-K may not be involved in the thrombin effect on microglia, because PI3-K inhibitors, such as wortmannin and LY294002, had little effect on thrombin-induced NO release (data not shown). Although NAC that increases reduced form of glutathione level dose-dependently reduced thrombin-induced NO release (Fig.6), ROS scavengers, such as catalase and superoxide dismutase did not inhibit thrombin-induced nitrite production (data not shown). Thus, ROS that could be removed by these scavengers do not seem to mediate thrombin-induced NO release.PAR-1 has been suggested as a thrombin receptor. In astrocytes and C6 glioma cells, thrombin-induced Ca2+ mobilization is mimicked by TRAP and blocked by cathepsin G (41Ubl J.J. Vohringer C. Reiser G. Neuroscience. 1998; 86: 597-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 42Kaufmann R. Lindschau C. Hoer A. Henklein P. Adomeit A. Haller H. Liebmann C. Oberdisse E. Nowak G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1996; 46: 641-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Activation of platelets could be achieved by both thrombin and TRAP (43Ofosu F.A. Freedman J. Dewar L. Song Y. Fenton J.W. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 283-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, in microglia TRAP did not induce NO release and iNOS mRNA expression (Fig. 7). Furthermore, cathepsin G had no effect on the thrombin-induced NO release (Fig. 8), although the effect of thrombin was reduced by hirudin, which inhibits protease function of thrombin (44Olivier D. Corvera C.U. Steinhoff M Bunnett N.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C1429-C1452Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Grutter M.G. Priestle J.P. Rahuel J. Grossenbacher H. Bode W. Hofsteenge J. Stone S.R.

Haemostasis. 1991; 21 (Suppl. 1): 27-31PubMed Google Scholar) (data not shown). We also tested the effect of prothrombin in the absence of factor VII and X that change prothrombin into thrombin. Prothrombin dose-dependently induced microglial NO release (data not shown). These results suggest that, in microglia, thrombin induces NO release via a PAR-1-independent pathway. Recent studies in other laboratories could support this conclusion. In myoblasts, thrombin protected myoblasts from apoptosis, whereas TRAP did not (47Chinni C. de Niese M.R. Tew D.J. Jenkins A.L. Bottomley S.P. Mackie E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9169-9174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In fibroblasts, TRAP and TP508 (a peptide fragment of thrombin different from TRAP) induced differential patterns of gene expression, suggesting additional nonproteolytic action of thrombin (27Sower L.E. Payne D.A. Meyers R. Carney D.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 247: 422-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, until recently, information regarding thrombin receptors other than PAR-1 has been limited, although PAR-3 and 4 also have been suggested. Therefore, further studies are needed to characterize thrombin receptors in microglia.

Pancreatic, cardiac, and vascular smooth muscle KATP channels, which consist of different subtypes of SURx, differ in their responses to cellular metabolic state. To explore the possibility that different interactions of SURx with nucleotides cause differential regulation of KATP channels, we analyzed the properties of nucleotide-binding folds (NBFs) of SUR1, SUR2A, and SUR2B. SURx in crude membrane fractions was incubated with 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP or 8-azido-[γ-32P]ATP under various conditions and was photoaffinity-labeled. Then, SURx was digested mildly with trypsin, and partial tryptic fragments were immunoprecipitated with antibodies against NBF1 and NBF2. Some nucleotide-binding properties were different among SUR subtypes as follows. 1) Mg2+ dependence of nucleotide binding of NBF2 of SUR1 was high, whereas those of SUR2A and SUR2B were low. 2) The affinities of NBF1 of SUR1 for ATP and ADP, especially for ATP, were significantly higher than those of SUR2A and SUR2B. 3) The affinities of NBF2 of SUR2B for ATP and ADP were significantly higher than those of SUR2A. This is the first biochemical study to analyze and compare the nucleotide-binding properties of NBFs of three SUR subtypes, and our results suggest that their different properties may explain, in part, the differential regulation of KATP channel subtypes. The high nucleotide-binding affinities of SUR1 may explain the high ability of SUR1 to stimulate pancreatic KATP channels. It is also suggested that the C-terminal 42 amino acids affect the physiological roles of SUR2A and SUR2B by changing the nucleotide-binding properties of their NBFs.

The differences between these channels may be caused, at least in part, by differences in SUR subtype. However, it is not clear how SUR subtypes cause the different properties of KATP channel subtypes. We have already shown that NBF1 of SUR1 is a Mg2+-independent high affinity ATP-binding site, that NBF2 is a Mg2+-dependent low affinity ATP-binding site, and that MgADP binding at NBF2 stabilizes the 8-azido-ATP binding at NBF1 of SUR1 (19Matsuo M.

In this study, to determine the reasons for differences among KATP channel subtypes, we investigated the nucleotide-binding properties and the stabilization effect of three subtypes of SUR, SUR1, SUR2A, and SUR2B.

Proteins were UV-irradiated for 5 min (at 254 nm, 5.5 milliwatts/cm2) on ice before or after removing free 8-azido-[32P]ATP. To remove free 8-azido-[32P]ATP, ice-cold TEM buffer was added to the sample, and the supernatant was removed after centrifugation (15,000 × g, 5 min, 2 °C). Pellets were resuspended in TEE buffer containing 5 μg/ml trypsin and 250 mm sucrose to 10 μg of membrane proteins/μl and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. Then 100 μl of RIPA buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, and 1% sodium deoxycholate) containing 100 μg/ml (p-amidinophenyl)methanesulfonyl fluoride was added to the samples to terminate proteolysis, and membrane proteins were solubilized for 30 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation for 15 min at 15,000 × g, tryptic fragments were immunoprecipitated from the supernatant with the antibody raised against NBF1 or NBF2 of hamster SUR1 prepared as described (20Matsuo M. Kioka N. Amachi T. Ueda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37479-37482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Samples were electrophoresed on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and autoradiographed. Bound 8-azido-[32P]ATP in NBF1 or NBF2 was measured by scanning with a radioimaging analyzer (BAS2000, Fuji Photo Film Co.). Membranes (20 μg of proteins) were incubated with 50 μm8-azido-[α-32P]ATP in 3 μl of TEM buffer containing 2 mm ouabain for 3 min at 37 °C. The reactions were stopped by adding ice-cold TEM buffer, and free 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP was removed after centrifugation (15,000 × g, 5 min, 2 °C). Pellets were resuspended in 10 μl of TEM or TEE buffer containing 2 mm ouabain and 1 mm ATP or ADP. The mixture was incubated for 15 min at 37 °C and UV-irradiated on ice. Samples were electrophoresed on a 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and autoradiographed. Bound 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP in SURx was measured using the radioimaging analyzer as described above. We demonstrated previously that mild digestion of SUR1 with trypsin produces 35- and 65-kDa fragments containing NBF1 and NBF2, respectively, and that we can analyze the ATP-binding properties of NBF1 and NBF2 separately after immunoprecipitation (20Matsuo M. Kioka N. Amachi T. Ueda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37479-37482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We examined whether NBFs of SUR2A and SUR2B can be also separated by mild tryptic digestion followed by immunoprecipitation. When SUR1, photoaffinity-labeled with 50 μm 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP, was mildly digested with trypsin, 100- and 35-kDa labeled fragments were immunoprecipitated with the anti-NBF1 antibody, and 100- and 65-kDa labeled fragments were immunoprecipitated with the anti-NBF2 antibody as previously reported (20Matsuo M. Kioka N. Amachi T. Ueda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37479-37482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) (Fig.1 A). The 100- and 65-kDa fragments were detected with the anti-C terminus antibody on Western blotting (Fig. 2 A). These results suggest that SUR1 is first digested with trypsin at site 1 to produce the tryptic 100-kDa fragment, containing both NBF1 and NBF2, and that the 100-kDa fragment is further digested to the 35-kDa fragment, which contains NBF1, and the 65-kDa fragment, which contains NBF2, as shown in Fig. 2 D.Figure 2Limited digestion of SURx with trypsin.Membrane proteins (25 μg) from host COS-7 cells or COS-7 cells expressing SUR1 (A), SUR2A (B), or SUR2B (C) were digested with 5 μg/ml trypsin at 37 °C for the indicated periods and separated by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Limited tryptic fragments were detected with anti-C terminus of SUR1 (A and C) or SUR2A (B) antibody. Undigested SURx, 100-kDa, and 65-kDa tryptic fragments are indicated. Experiments were performed in duplicate.D, predicted diagram of limited trypsin digestion of SURx.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) When photoaffinity-labeled SUR2A and SUR2B were digested with trypsin under the same conditions, they produced 65- and 35-kDa fragments but very little 100-kDa fragment (Fig. 1, B and C). On Western blotting, 65-kDa fragments of SUR2A and SUR2B, but little 100-kDa fragment, were detected by antibodies against the C termini of SUR2A and SUR1, respectively (Fig. 2, B and C). The antibody raised against the C terminus of SUR1 recognized SUR2B as shown in Fig. 2 C, because the C-terminal 42 amino acids of SUR2B are similar to those of SUR1 (14Isomoto S. Kondo C. Yamada M.

These results suggest that SUR2A and SUR2B are digested with trypsin at site 1 and site 2 simultaneously to produce the tryptic 35-kDa fragment, which contains NBF1, and the 65-kDa fragment, which contains NBF2. It also indicated that antibodies raised against NBFs of SUR1 can be used to precipitate NBFs of SUR2A and SUR2B. To investigate the ATP-binding properties of NBFs of SURx, SURx was photoaffinity-labeled with 50 μm8-azido-[α-32P]ATP under various conditions and mildly digested with trypsin (Fig. 3). Tryptic fragments were immunoprecipitated with anti-NBF1 or anti-NBF2 antibody. NBF1 of SUR1 was labeled with 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP even in the presence of metal-chelating agent EDTA (Fig. 3 A, lane 1) or CDTA (lane 2), whereas NBF2 was labeled only in the presence of Mg2+ (lane 7). NBF1 was labeled with 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP by UV irradiation even after removing free ligand with excess cold buffer (lane 4), whereas NBF2 was not (lane 8), indicating that the bound 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP did not dissociate from NBF1 during washing of membranes with excess cold buffer. These results suggest that 8-azido-ATP binding to NBF1 is Mg2+-independent and very stable, whereas that to NBF2 is Mg2+-dependent and unstable as reported previously (20Matsuo M. Kioka N. Amachi T. Ueda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37479-37482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In the case of SUR2A (Fig. 3 B) and SUR2B (Fig.3 C), both NBF1 and NBF2 were labeled with 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP either in the presence of EDTA (lanes 1 and 5) or Mg2+ (lanes 3 and 7). However, when Mg2+ was completely depleted by chelating with CDTA, which has stronger Mg2+-chelating ability than EDTA, NBF2 was not labeled with 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP (lane 6), whereas NBF1 was (lane 2). NBF1 was labeled with 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP by UV irradiation after removing free ligand with excess cold buffer (lane 4), whereas NBF2 was not (lane 8). These results suggest that 8-azido-ATP binding to NBF1 of SUR2A and SUR2B is Mg2+-independent and very stable, whereas that to NBF2 is Mg2+-dependent and unstable similar to SUR1. However, Mg2+ dependence of 8-azido-ATP binding to NBF2 of SUR2A and SUR2B is much lower than that of SUR1. In our previous study, it was suggested that NBF2 of SUR1 may have ATPase activity, because NBF2 of SUR1 was photoaffinity-labeled with 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP but not with 8-azido-[γ-32P]ATP as shown in Fig.4 A (lanes 2 and4). We examined whether NBFs of SUR2A and SUR2B could be labeled with 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP and 8-azido-[γ-32P]ATP (Fig. 4, B andC). NBF1s of SUR2A and SUR2B were photoaffinity-labeled with both 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP (lane 1) and 8-azido-[γ-32P]ATP (lane 3) in the presence of Mg2+. However, NBF2s of SUR2A and SUR2B were labeled with 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP (lane 2) but not with 8-azido-[γ-32P]ATP (lane 4) in the presence of Mg2+. NBF2s of SUR2A and SUR2B were labeled with both 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP and 8-azido-[γ-32P]ATP in the presence of EDTA but were not labeled in the presence of CDTA (data not shown). These results suggest that bound 8-azido-[32P]ATP is hydrolyzed and γ-phosphate dissociates from NBF2 of SURx in the presence of Mg2+, although NBF1 of SURx have no or little ATPase activity. We have suggested that NBF1 of SUR1 is a high affinity 8-azido-ATP-binding site and NBF2 is a low affinity 8-azido-ATP-binding site (19Matsuo M. Tucker S.J. Ashcroft F.M. Amachi T. Ueda K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 458: 292-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 20Matsuo M. Kioka N. Amachi T. Ueda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37479-37482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To know the affinity for ATP and ADP of NBFs of SURx, we examined inhibition of 8-azido-ATP binding by ATP and ADP. When SURx was photoaffinity-labeled with 50 μm 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP in the presence of cold ATP or ADP, photoaffinity labeling of both NBFs of SURx was inhibited by ATP and ADP in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.5), indicating that ADP as well as ATP binds to NBFs. The K i values for ATP and ADP of NBFs were calculated, and the values and nucleotide-binding properties are summarized in Table I. TheK i values of NBF1 for ATP were 4.4 ± 3.7, 110 ± 41, and 51 ± 13 μm in SUR1, SUR2A, and SUR2B, respectively. Those of NBF1 for ADP were 26 ± 8.6, 86 ± 23, and 66 ± 7.5 μm in SUR1, SUR2A, and SUR2B, respectively. Thus, the affinities of NBF1 for both ATP and ADP are significantly higher in SUR1 than in SUR2A and SUR2B. This is consistent with the concentration dependence of photoaffinity labeling of NBF1 of SURx with 8-azido-[32P]ATP; the degree of photoaffinity labeling was saturated at about 5 μm in SUR1, but saturation was seen at about 50 μm in SUR2A and SUR2B (data not shown). The affinity of NBF1 of SUR1 for ATP is significantly higher than that for ADP, although the affinities of NBF1 of SUR2A and SUR2B are not significantly different between ATP and ADP. The K i values of NBF2 for ATP were 60 ± 26, 120 ± 39, and 38 ± 26 μm in SUR1, SUR2A, and SUR2B, respectively. Those of NBF2 for ADP were 100 ± 26, 170 ± 70, and 67 ± 40 μm in SUR1, SUR2A, and SUR2B, respectively. Thus, the affinities of NBF2 of SUR2A for ATP and ADP are significantly lower than those of SUR2B.Table ICharacteristics of NBFs of SURxSUR subtypeNBFK i ATPK i ADPMg2+dependency1-aMg2+ dependency of nucleotide binding of NBF2 of SUR1 is high (++), and those of SUR2A and SUR2B are low (+).

Open table in a new tab We reported previously that ADP stabilizes the binding of prebound 8-azido-[32P]ATP at NBF1 on SUR1, either by direct binding to NBF2 or hydrolysis of bound ATP at NBF2 (21Ueda K. Komine J. Matsuo M. Seino S. Amachi T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Diabetes. 2000; 49: 114-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We examined whether two NBFs of SUR2A and SUR2B bind nucleotides cooperatively. When membranes from COS-7 cells expressing SUR2A or SUR2B are incubated with 50 μm8-azido-[α-32P]ATP, both NBF1 and NBF2 bind 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP. Because 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP bound to NBF2 dissociates during washing of membranes with excess buffer at 0 °C but that bound to NBF1 does not, we can estimate the stabilization effect of nucleotides bound to NBF2 on 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP binding to NBF1 during postincubation at 37 °C as shown in Fig.6. When membranes were postincubated in the absence of Mg2+, 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP quickly dissociated from NBF1 of SUR2A and SUR2B (Fig.7). When membranes were postincubated in the presence of Mg2+ without nucleotide, 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP gradually dissociated from NBF1 in a time-dependent manner as in the case of SUR1 (21Ueda K. Komine J.

However, 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP did not dissociate from NBF1 in the presence of both Mg2+ and nucleotide (Fig. 7), indicating that MgATP and MgADP stabilize 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP binding at NBF1 as in the case of SUR1 (21Ueda K.

Membrane proteins (20 μg) from COS-7 cells expressing SUR2A or SUR2B were incubated with 50 μm 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP, and free 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP was removed by washing membranes with excess cold buffer. Proteins were photoaffinity-labeled immediately or after postincubation with or without nucleotides in the presence or absence of Mg2+ for 15 min at 37 °C. The amount of photoaffinity-labeled 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP is shown as percentage of that of SUR2A (white bars) or SUR2B (black bars) UV-irradiated immediately after resuspension. Experiments were performed in triplicate, and the average values are represented with S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In the present study, we have compared the nucleotide-binding properties of each NBF of SURx to elucidate the molecular mechanisms responsible for the differential regulation of KATP channel subtypes in various organs. Some nucleotide-binding properties were found to be similar among all the SUR subtypes as follows: 1) NBF1 is a Mg2+-independent ATP- and ADP-binding site; 2) NBF2 is a Mg2+-dependent ATP- and ADP-binding site; 3) 8-azido-ATP binds to NBF1 very stably and does not dissociate at 0 °C; 4) MgATP or MgADP binding to NBF2 stabilizes 8-azido-ATP binding at NBF1; 5) NBF2 may have ATPase activity, whereas NBF1 has showed no or little ATPase activity. However, some properties are different among SUR subtypes as follows. 1) Nucleotide binding to NBF2 of SUR1 is highly Mg2+-dependent, whereas Mg2+ dependence of nucleotide binding to NBF2 of SUR2A and SUR2B is low. 2) The affinities of NBF1 of SUR1 for ATP and ADP, especially for ATP, are significantly higher than those of SUR2A and SUR2B. 3)"
https://openalex.org/W1992210744,"Interactions between transcription factors bound to separate operator sites commonly play an important role in gene regulation by mediating cooperative binding to the DNA. However, few detailed structural models for understanding the molecular basis of such cooperativity are available. The c1 repressor of bacteriophage lambda is a classic example of a protein that binds to its operator sites cooperatively. The C-terminal domain of the repressor mediates dimerization as well as a dimer-dimer interaction that results in the cooperative binding of two repressor dimers to adjacent operator sites. Here, we present the x-ray crystal structure of the lambda repressor C-terminal domain determined by multiwavelength anomalous diffraction. Remarkably, the interactions that mediate cooperativity are captured in the crystal, where two dimers associate about a 2-fold axis of symmetry. Based on the structure and previous genetic and biochemical data, we present a model for the cooperative binding of two lambda repressor dimers at adjacent operator sites."
https://openalex.org/W1983471764,"The light intermediate chains (LICs) of cytoplasmic dynein consist of multiple isoforms, which undergo post-translational modification to produce a large number of species separable by two-dimensional electrophoresis and which we have proposed to represent at least two gene products.

Vallee R.B. Nature. 1987; 330: 181-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar), which functions as a molecular motor that moves cellular components toward the minus ends of microtubules and determines the distribution of many vesicular organelles (2Vallee R.B. Sheetz M.P. Science. 1996; 271: 1539-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic dynein has also been found to be involved in many aspects of mitosis, where it is found at the kinetochore, spindle poles, and cell cortex (3Steuer E.R. Wordeman L. Schroer T.A.

The cytoplasmic dynein complex is composed of four subunit classes: the heavy (HCs),1 intermediate (ICs), light intermediate (LICs), and light chains (LCs). The dynein heavy chains are large (532 kDa) polypeptides that contain four ATPase domains and are responsible for microtubule binding and catalytic activity (2Vallee R.B. Sheetz M.P. Science. 1996; 271: 1539-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The intermediate chains are a diverse set of subunits derived by alternative splicing from two different genes (8Vaughan K.T. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1507-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). The ICs have been found to be responsible for the interaction of the dynein complex with a second complex called dynactin, which is required for dynein-based motility, by directly binding to the p150 Glued dynactin subunit (8Vaughan K.T. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1507-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 9Karki S. Holzbaur E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28806-28811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Dynactin is thought to be involved in linking dynein to various organelles in the cell; thus the intermediate chains have been proposed to have an important function in dynein targeting (7Echeverri C.J. Paschal B.M. Vaughan K.T. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 617-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). The LCs are a diverse family of low and very low molecular weight subunits (10King S.M. Dillman III, J.F. Benashski S.E. Lye R.J. Patel-King R.S. Pfister K.K. J. Biol.

Cell. 1999; 97: 877-887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). The HCs, ICs, and LCs all have homologous counterparts in flagellar and ciliary forms of dynein. The LICs, however, are unique to cytoplasmic dynein. They contain a P-loop consensus sequence of unknown function (14Gill S.R. Cleveland D.W. Schroer T.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 645-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 15Hughes S.M. Vaughan K.T. Herskovits J.S. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 17-24PubMed Google Scholar). Two-dimensional electrophoresis of both rat and chicken LICs reveals numerous LIC species, at least some of which result from phosphorylation of the LIC polypeptides (14Gill S.R. Cleveland D.W. Schroer T.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 645-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 15Hughes S.M. Vaughan K.T. Herskovits J.S. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 17-24PubMed Google Scholar). Based on molecular cloning of one of the rat LICs and peptide microsequencing, we proposed that there are at least two different LIC genes per organism (15Hughes S.M. Vaughan K.T. Herskovits J.S. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 17-24PubMed Google Scholar). Comparison of the chicken sequence, DLC-A, to the sequence of our rat LIC2 clones and bovine LIC peptide sequences suggests that DLC-A is the chicken isoform of LIC1 and that LIC1 and LIC2 are different gene products (15Hughes S.M. Vaughan K.T. Herskovits J.S. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 17-24PubMed Google Scholar). Northern blotting suggests that both LICs have a wide tissue distribution (14Gill S.R. Cleveland D.W. Schroer T.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 645-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 15Hughes S.M. Vaughan K.T. Herskovits J.S. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 17-24PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we demonstrated that recombinant full-length and truncated LIC polypeptides bind to pericentrin, a structural component of the centrosome that is thought to be involved in organizing microtubule nucleating material. Pericentrin has been observed to move in a linear fashion along microtubules toward the centrosome (16Young A. Dictenberg J. Purohit A. Tuft R. Doxsey S.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2047-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Quantitative analysis of centrosomal components during the cell cycle indicated that pericentrin, along with γ-tubulin, accumulates from G1 through metaphase, at which time the centrosomal level drops dramatically (17Dictenberg J.B. Zimmerman W. Sparks C.A. Young A. Vidair C. Zheng Y. Carrington W. Fay F.S. Doxsey S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 163-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar), although somewhat different results have been reported for γ-tubulin in a different system (18Khodjakov A. Rieder C.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 585-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Using a co-overexpression and immunoprecipitation assay, we tested a number of dynein and dynactin subunits for the ability to bind to pericentrin. Of all the expression constructs used, only full-length and truncated LIC were found to co-immunoprecipitate with overexpressed pericentrin. Furthermore, when we repeated this experiment in35S-labeled cells, pericentrin and a LIC fragment were the only specific immunoprecipitated species detected, demonstrating a direct interaction. These results suggest that the LICs, like the ICs, are responsible for linking dynein to its cargo. In this study, we report the cDNA cloning and sequencing of rat LIC1, establishing the existence of two LIC genes, and we compare the ability of both LIC1 and LIC2 to bind to pericentrin. We find that LIC1, but not LIC2, is capable of this interaction, and we have identified the central portions of both LIC1 and pericentrin as the interacting regions. To determine whether a distinct pericentrin-binding form of the dynein complex exists, we examined the LIC content of dynein and have found that the LICs form homooligomers, but not heterooligomers, and that in triple overexpression studies, HC can bind to either LIC1 or LIC2, but not both. Furthermore, endogenous LIC1, but not LIC2, co-immunoprecipitates with overexpressed pericentrin. These results indicate that the LICs specify different subtypes of dynein, only one of which interacts with pericentrin. A rat brain cDNA library in the Lambda ZAP II vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was screened by plaque hybridization as described previously (15Hughes S.M. Vaughan K.T. Herskovits J.S. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 17-24PubMed Google Scholar) with probes random-primed (DECAprime II kit, Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX) from rat LIC2 cDNA (15Hughes S.M. Vaughan K.T. Herskovits J.S. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 17-24PubMed Google Scholar). Isolated cDNA clones were sequenced (Sequenase, version 2.0, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and compared with LIC peptide and LIC2 cDNA sequence (15Hughes S.M. Vaughan K.T. Herskovits J.S. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 17-24PubMed Google Scholar). We identified one LIC1 cDNA and used probes random-primed from it to isolate additional LIC1 cDNAs from the library. The 5′-end of the cDNA was obtained using the Marathon cDNA amplification kit with rat brain mRNA (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). The entire LIC1 cDNA sequence was assembled and analyzed using the GCG DNA analysis programs, including BESTFIT and PILEUP. The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) data bases were scanned using BLAST (19Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (68293) Google Scholar). LIC1 and LIC2 mammalian expression constructs (see Fig. 3) were made by removing the β-gal sequence from pCMV β (CLONTECH) withNotI (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA) digestion and inserting LIC1 and LIC2 full-length or partial cDNAs. The LIC cDNAs had 3′-end NotI sites and coding sequence for epitope tags: myc (MEQKLISEEDLN), HA (YPYPVPDYA), or FLAG (DYKDDDDK) added by PCR. NotI restriction sites were added to the 5′-ends by either PCR or cloning into pARK (gift from Dr. Melissa Gee), which has NotI sites flanking the MCS. LIC1 P-loop point mutations were made using the Chameleon double-stranded, site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). To produce an amino-terminal fragment of pericentrin (pHAI/pericentrin 1–575), we cut the full-length HA-pericentrin construct (20Purohit A. Tynan S.H. Vallee R. Doxsey S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 481-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) withPaeR7I creating a clone extending from the start codon (nucleotide 295) to nucleotide 2019. A truncated central domain of pericentrin containing nucleotides 2587–4317 of the full-length pericentrin was constructed (pHAI/pericentrin 764–1341) by PCR amplification using clone lambda Pc1.2 (21Doxsey S.J. Stein P. Evans L. Calarco P.D. Kirschner M. Cell. 1994; 76: 639-650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar), a 5′-primer with a 5′-EcoRI restriction enzyme site (5′-GCGAATTCCTGAAACGCCAACAT3-′) and a 3′-primer with a 3′-PaeR7I site (5′-CGATTTCCTCTGCTTTATCC3-′). The PCR product was digested with EcoRI and PaeR7I and ligated into the pHAI plasmid digested with EcoRI/PaeR7I. A third truncated form of pericentrin coding for the carboxyl terminus (pHAI/pericentrin 1341–1920) was constructed by digesting lambda pc1.2 with XbaI. The restriction fragment was cut byPaeR7I and inserted into pHAI to yield a clone containing nucleotides 4317–6309, with a stop codon at nucleotide 6054. The LIC1 and LIC2 cDNAs were put into theNdeI site of pET 15b (Novagen, Inc., Madison, WI) expression vector and expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21DE3. The bacteria were lysed by French press, and the cell debris was pelleted. The bacterial cytoplasm was passed over a nickel affinity column (Novagen), washed, and eluted with imidazole (Sigma). The eluates were dialyzed into Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline and concentrated in Slide-A-Lyzer dialysis cassettes (Pierce, Rockford, IL). The recovered proteins were conjugated to preactivated keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Pierce), mixed with Freund's complete or incomplete adjuvant (Pierce) and injected into New Zealand White rabbits (Millbrook Farms, Amherst, MA). After the initial injections and two more boosts, blood was collected and the sera were tested against COS-7 cell extract on immunoblots (7Echeverri C.J. Paschal B.M. Vaughan K.T. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 617-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Anti-myc polyclonal antibody used was described previously (22Gee M.A. Heuser J.E. Vallee R.B. Nature. 1997; 390: 636-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar); anti-HA polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies were purchased from BAbCO (Richmond, CA); and anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody and affinity resin were purchased from Sigma. Secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies were purchased from Jackson Immunoresearch Labs, Inc. (West Grove, PA). COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc., Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cells were transfected (LipofectAMINE, Life Technologies, Inc.) for 6–12 h with 1–4 μg of DNA. Transfections were individually optimized for each construct and combinations of constructs. 30–48 h after transfection, the cells were harvested by washing the monolayer twice with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline and scraping into modified RIPA buffer (100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm Pefabloc SC (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and 2 μg/ml leupeptin and pepstatin). The cells were placed in a microcentrifuge tube on ice for 20 min and then spun in a microcentrifuge at maximum speed for 10 min. The resulting extract was used for all co-immunoprecipitation experiments with protein G (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech)- or protein A (Pierce)-Sepharose beads and the appropriate antibody. Immunoprecipitations were incubated overnight at 4 °C with gentle agitation. The beads were then washed with modified RIPA buffer five times at room temperature and eluted into 2× SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer at 100 °C for 5 min. The entire eluate and a sample of the supernatant were used for immunoblotting. Co-transfection efficiency was determined by double indirect immunofluorescence microscopy and varied considerably between combinations of constructs. When extracts from singly transfected cultures were mixed, co-precipitation was never observed, indicating that interactions between co-expressed proteins occurred in vivo. Co-immunoprecipitation of overexpressed pericentrin and endogenous LICs was performed essentially as described above, with the following change: the beads were eluted with 2× SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer, which did not contain β-mercaptoethanol, at 100 °C for 5 min. Bovine LIC peptide sequences generated in our earlier study (15Hughes S.M. Vaughan K.T. Herskovits J.S. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 17-24PubMed Google Scholar) included one LIC1 (indicated as LIC 57/59 in the previous manuscript) peptide sequence that was unique but corresponded to part of the deduced sequence from chicken DLC-A, suggesting the existence of a second LIC gene in rat. To test this possibility, we isolated additional LIC cDNAs from a rat brain cDNA library; we identified a novel cDNA clone, which we termed LIC1. Two different mRNAs were represented among LIC1 clones obtained; they differed only in their polyadenylation site, consistent with what was reported for chicken DLC-A (14Gill S.R. Cleveland D.W. Schroer T.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 645-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The complete cDNA sequence of rat LIC1 has been deposited (GenBank™ accession numberAF181992). A line diagram of the two rat LICs is shown in Fig.1 A. Using BESTFIT, we find rat LIC1 to be 65% identical (71% similar) to rat LIC2 and 81% identical (90.8% similar) to DLC-A. The sequences are closely related throughout the entire length, with the greatest divergence being at the ends. Fig.1 A shows the location of the peptide sequences that we reported previously (15Hughes S.M. Vaughan K.T. Herskovits J.S. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 17-24PubMed Google Scholar). Two of the LIC2-derived peptides do not have homologous sequences in LIC1 (Fig. 1 A, line 1); one of these peptides is at the amino terminus, and the other is within the relatively divergent portion of the carboxyl terminus (amino acids 400 to the end). The rat LIC1 sequence contains regions corresponding to all of the peptide sequences we previously obtained from the LIC1 doublet, including the peptide that was found only in DLC-A (Fig.1 A, line 3), thus confirming our hypothesis that DLC-A is the chicken isoform of LIC1. Both of these sequences contain a P-loop consensus (Fig. 1 A, open boxes atleft) sequence, which has been found to be highly conserved among LICs (see “Discussion”). We note that a LIC1 antiserum cross-reacted with LIC2, consistent with the high degree of sequence conservation; surprisingly, an anti-LIC2 serum was monospecific (Fig.1 B). We note that during the course of these experiments we also obtained cDNA clones that indicated there are four alternative LIC2 isoforms in rat (Fig. 1 A, open boxes labeled Aand B); the human LIC2 isoforms have all appeared in GenBank™ (23Maeda S. Nam S.Y. Fujisawa M. Nakamuta N. Ogawa K. Kurohmaru M. Hayashi Y. Cell Struct. Funct. 1998; 23: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). We have obtained no comparable pattern in our LIC1 cDNAs. Because rat LIC1 and LIC2 are very highly homologous to each other, we were interested in potential functional similarities or differences between them. Our initial analysis of pericentrin binding made use of LIC1, but the relative ability of different LICs to interact with pericentrin was not explored (20Purohit A. Tynan S.H. Vallee R. Doxsey S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 481-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows co-immunoprecipitation assays in which HA-pericentrin was overexpressed with LIC1-myc or LIC2-myc. Anti-HA immunoprecipitates of pericentrin were probed with anti-myc to detect the LICs. Only LIC1, and not LIC2, was found to co-immunoprecipitate with pericentrin. All LICs sequenced to date contain a P-loop consensus sequence, indicating potential ATPase activity. Because this P-loop is well conserved from human to Caenorhabditis elegans (see “Discussion”), it is likely that it plays a functional role in LIC activities. To test for any effect of ATPase activity on the LIC1/pericentrin interaction, we constructed two different full-length LIC1 constructs with point mutations in the P-loop sequence. Because it is difficult to predict the effects on binding and/or nucleotide hydrolysis in response to point mutations (24Saraste M. Sibbald P.R. Wittinghofer A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 430-434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1726) Google Scholar), we tested a mutation of the invariant lysine (K80) to glutamic acid (E) and a mutation of the threonine (T81) to alanine. Both of these point mutants were used in the co-immunoprecipitation assay with pericentrin. We were unable to detect any binding differences between these mutants and wild type LIC1 (Fig. 3, and data not shown). To determine whether specific regions within LIC1 and pericentrin were important in their interaction, we evaluated a series of truncation mutants of both LIC1 and pericentrin in our co-immunoprecipitation assay. Fig. 3 shows LIC1 truncations in a summary of the results of co-immunoprecipitation assays using full-length HA-pericentrin (data for several of these truncations are shown in Figs. 2 and4). This series of truncations shows that the region of LIC1 between amino acids 140 and 236 is important in the interaction. Mutants that contain any part of this region were found to interact with HA-pericentrin in the assay, whereas mutants that do not contain any of this region did not interact. Fig. 4 shows three fragments of pericentrin, the amino-terminal, central, and carboxyl-terminal portions. The full-length LIC1 would not co-express with all of the pericentrin fragments, so amino- and carboxyl-terminal truncated LIC1 fragments were used. We found that both bind to the central portion of pericentrin, amino acids 764–1341. In light of the finding that pericentrin binds to LIC1, but not LIC2, we tested the ability of LICs to homooligomerize or heterooligomerize. We overexpressed LIC1-HA with LIC1-myc or LIC2-myc (Fig.5 A). When LIC1-HA was immunoprecipitated with anti-HA, only LIC1-myc was found to co-precipitate, indicating that LIC1 forms homooligomers, but not heterooligomers. Fig. 5 B shows that oligomers will also form from LIC2-myc and LIC2-FLAG. Homooligomers also occurred when the myc-tagged constructs had point mutations in the P-loop sequences (data not shown), indicating that a functional P-loop is not required for LIC self-association. It is not possible for us to tell from these experiments how many LIC molecules form a homooligomer. We used triple overexpression to determine whether LIC1 and LIC2 homooligomers were present in the same or different dynein complexes (Fig. 6). LIC1-HA and LIC2-myc were overexpressed along with C1140-myc, a dynein heavy chain construct that binds to the LICs (see accompanying article (25Tynan S.H. Purohit A. Doxsey S.J. Vallee R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32769-32774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar)). Fig. 6 Ashows the triple overexpression extract immunoprecipitated with both anti-HA and anti-LIC2. When probed with anti-myc, C1140-myc was found in both immunoprecipitates, but LIC2-myc was only found in anti-LIC2 and not in anti-HA precipitations. Fig. 6 B shows the same blots reprobed with anti-HA to localize LIC1-HA. LIC1-HA is found only in anti-HA and not in anti-LIC2 immunoprecipitations. This experiment demonstrates that each LIC independently associates with HC; LIC1 and LIC2 do not bind to HC simultaneously. Finally, we tested our hypothesis that there are two different dynein populations by looking at the endogenous LICs that co-precipitate with overexpressed pericentrin. Our previous work has shown that overexpressed pericentrin will precipitate endogenous dynein HC and IC. LIC content has not been demonstrated due to technical difficulties caused by the similar molecular weights of the LICs and the antibody heavy chain. To avoid this problem, we eluted anti-HA precipitations with sample buffer lacking β-mercaptoethanol (Fig.7), which kept the antibody intact, so that it did not interfere with the LICs. As predicted, endogenous LIC1 co-precipitated with pericentrin, but LIC2 was not detected, demonstrating the existence of a subpopulation of dynein, which contains only LIC1. We have identified a second LIC gene in rat, confirming our earlier hypothesis (15Hughes S.M. Vaughan K.T. Herskovits J.S. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 17-24PubMed Google Scholar) and further accounting for the considerable diversity in LIC forms observed in purified cytoplasmic dynein complexes. We have also demonstrated that LIC1 is specific for pericentrin binding and that the LICs form homooligomers, but not heterooligomers. Through triple overexpression studies, we have shown that the two LIC isoforms cannot bind to HC simultaneously. These results together provide evidence for the existence of functionally distinct cytoplasmic dynein complexes that differ by LIC content. From comparisons of rat LIC2 and chicken DLC-A sequences we previously hypothesized the existence of two different but related LIC genes in rat (15Hughes S.M. Vaughan K.T. Herskovits J.S. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 17-24PubMed Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences of LIC1 and LIC2 differ throughout the entire length, and the DNA sequences are only 68% identical, with no large (>30 nucleotides) stretches of complete identity, supporting the idea that they are derived from different genes. LIC1 and LIC2 amino acid sequences account for all 11 peptide sequences that we obtained from bovine cytoplasmic dynein LICs (15Hughes S.M. Vaughan K.T. Herskovits J.S. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 17-24PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that there are no additional LIC genes. BLAST searches of the C. elegans genome, which is nearly complete, with either LIC sequence yield only one match. The gene product is an LIC that is equally homologous to both LIC1 and LIC2. These results suggest that C. elegans has only one LIC gene. Because the full range of LIC functions is not known in any species, it remains to be seen whether a single LIC in C. elegans can carry out all LIC functions or if the diversity provided by two separate vertebrate LICs allows for additional roles for this class of subunit. Despite relatively low homology between rat and worm sequences, the C. elegans LIC has a conserved P-loop sequence, further suggesting that the LICs are functional ATPases. No sequences homologous to LIC have been found in the S. cerevisiae genome, apparently indicating that LIC is not involved in the limited functions attributed to yeast dynein. It is also interesting to note that the LICs have not appeared among nuclear migration mutants of Aspergillus nidulans (the nud mutants) (26Morris N.R. Exp. Cell Res. 1976; 98: 204-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 27Xiang X. Beckwith S.M. Morris N.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2100-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) and Neurospora crassa (the ropy mutants) (28Plamann M. Minke P.F. Tinsley J.H. Bruno K.S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). All other dynein subunit classes and some dynactin subunits have been identified in the screening of these mutants, suggesting that the LICs may not be involved in nuclear migration. The isoform specificity of pericentrin binding that we describe here adds strong support for the specificity of the LIC-pericentrin interaction. The interaction site (amino acid 140–236 of LIC1) is bracketed in Fig. 1 A. This region shows a high degree of identity between LIC1 and LIC2 except for amino acids 201–219, which appears to be isoform-specific. This region may account for the binding specificity of LIC1. The P-loop sequence of LIC1 is located amino-terminal to the interaction region. Mutations in the P-loop do not appear to have any obvious effect on the LIC1/pericentrin interaction. Some fragments of LIC1 bind more efficiently to pericentrin than full-length LIC1 does; for example, LIC1N174 and LIC1C173 each contain part of the interacting region, and each co-immunoprecipitate with pericentrin more efficiently than full-length LIC1. The most likely explanation for this observation is that when LIC1 is truncated, regulatory elements are removed, allowing for maximum binding between LIC1 and pericentrin. Conversely, the pericentrin fragment that binds to LIC1 does not bind any better than full-length pericentrin, suggesting that any regulation of the interaction occurs with LIC1, rather than pericentrin. We would expect the LIC1/pericentrin interaction to be highly regulated to allow for the slow accumulation and rapid dissociation of pericentrin at the centrosome. γ-Tubulin has been found to co-immunoprecipitate with and accumulate at the centrosome with pericentrin (17Dictenberg J.B. Zimmerman W. Sparks C.A. Young A. Vidair C. Zheng Y. Carrington W. Fay F.S. Doxsey S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 163-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). γ-Tubulin does not associate with the central portion of pericentrin, 2W. Zimmerman and S. Doxsey, unpublished results. in contrast to LIC1 (Fig. 4). This suggests that pericentrin may be capable of associating with LIC1 (and thus dynein) and the γ-tubulin containing γ-tubulin ring complex at the same time. This would allow for the γ-TURC complex to be transported to the centrosome at the same time as pericentrin, without any components of the complex directly binding to dynein. Our findings that only LIC1 binds to pericentrin and that LIC1 and LIC2 binding to HC is mutually exclusive suggest that a substantial subfraction of dynein is incapable of binding to pericentrin. In other work (see accompanying manuscript), we have demonstrated that the LIC1 and LIC2 binding sites on the HC are identical, further supporting our contention that the LICs bind to the HC, and thus the complex, mutually exclusively to define functional subfractions of dynein. LIC1-containing dynein can bind to pericentrin, whereas LIC2 dynein cannot, and there may be LIC-less dynein that also cannot. This adds diversity to the pool of dynein in the cell. The subcellular targeting of dynein may be simplified by the existence of dynein subtypes, each of which is responsible for a given set of dynein functions. Pericentrin binding is likely to be one of several functions of LIC1, because there appears to be considerably more LIC1 than pericentrin in cells. This suggests that other mechanisms are still required for the specific binding of dynein to various cellular components, but alternative LIC subunit content provides some amount of specificity. We have speculated that the LICs may be responsible for a non-dynactin-based targeting mechanism for dynein, perhaps specific for soluble proteins rather than membrane-bound organelles (20Purohit A. Tynan S.H. Vallee R. Doxsey S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 481-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In this view, The LICs would function independently of dynactin, with each having different targeting specificities. Dynactin-mediated targeting of dynein would, presumably, involve either a subfraction of dynein, which lacks LICs or in which the LICs have been inactivated. However, given that p50 overexpression has been observed to disrupt the accumulation of pericentrin at centrosomes (16Young A. Dictenberg J. Purohit A. Tuft R. Doxsey S.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2047-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), it is also quite possible that dynactin and the LICs function in concert in certain situations to support both binding and motility. Further work is necessary to determine the actual relationship between LIC- and dynactin-mediated functions. We thank Dr. Elizabeth Luna for her assistance in using 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends to complete the 5′-end of the LIC1 cDNA."

The diverse roles are demonstrated by the Elav family of RNA-binding proteins, where various members have been shown to regulate several processes involving mRNA.

Events such as RNA processing, mRNA transport, mRNA stability, and mRNA translation are examples of regulatory steps that involve RNA-binding proteins (RBPs)1 (1Siomi H. Dreyfuss G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 345-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). A superfamily of RBPs has been defined that contains a conserved domain, called the RNA recognition motif (RRM), an 80–90 amino acid domain (2Birney E. Kumar S. Krainer A.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5803-5816Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar, 3Kenan D.J. Query C.C. Keene J.D. Trends Biochem.

The most highly conserved sequences within the RRM are the ribonucleoprotein 1 (RNP1) and RNP2 motifs that are signature sequences for the RRM and have been shown to specifically interact with RNA (5Nagai K. Oubridge C. Ito N. Avis J. Evans P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 235-240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 6Draper D.E. J. Mol.

Chem. 1988; 263: 3307-3313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Often, consecutive copies of the RRM combine to form a single RNA-binding domain (8Ding J. Hayashi M.K. Zhang Y. Manche L.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 725-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), although a single RRM can function to specifically bind RNA (3Kenan D.J. Query C.C. Keene J.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 214-220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar, 4Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. Science. 1994; 265: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar, 5Nagai K. Oubridge C. Ito N. Avis J. Evans P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 235-240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). In addition, the RRM can serve to mediate protein-protein interactions (13Wang J. Dong Z. Bell L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22227-22235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 14Samuels M. Deshpande G. Schedl P.

RRM-containing proteins (RRM proteins) usually have multiple functional domains, both an RNA-binding domain comprised of the RRM(s) and other domains that provide other functions to the corresponding full-length protein (16Biamonti G. Riva S. FEBS Lett. 1994; 340: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). For example, the human heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A1 has two consecutive RRMs at the amino terminus that bind RNA or single-stranded DNA and then a carboxyl-terminal domain that contains a nuclear localization signal (17Siomi H. Dreyfuss G. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 551-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar), mediates protein-protein interactions (18Cartegni L. Maconi M. Morandi E. Cobianchi F. Riva S. Biamonti G. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 337-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), and encodes an RNA annealing activity (19Pontius B.W. Berg P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8403-8407Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Thus, RRM-containing proteins function as components of RNP complexes that mediate many post-transcriptional regulatory events. The importance of RBPs in development is underscored by the isolation of mutants with interesting developmental phenotypes where the defective gene encodes an RBP. In Drosophila melanogaster(20Yao K.M. Samson M.L. Reeves R. White K. J. Neurobiol. 1993; 24: 723-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), Caenorhabditis elegans (21Lundquist E.A. Herman R.K. Rogalski T.M. Mullen G.P. Moerman D.G. Shaw J.E. Development. 1996; 122: 1601-1610PubMed Google Scholar), mouse (22Ebersole T.A. Chen Q. Justice M.J. Artzt K. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 260-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), andArabidopsis thaliana (23Macknight R. Bancroft I. Page T. Lister C. Schmidt R. Love K. Westphal L. Murphy G. Sherson S. Cobbett C. Dean C. Cell. 1997; 89: 737-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar), mutants with defects in RBPs are defective in cell growth and differentiation. An example of an RBP that regulates development is provided by the Bruno protein and its role as a translational repressor of oskar mRNA. InDrosophila, oskar is required for formation of germ cells and positioning of the posterior of the embryo (24Lehmann R. Nüsslein-Volhard C. Cell. 1986; 47: 141-152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Bothoskar mRNA and the encoded protein must be properly localized to the posterior pole of the oocyte for correct development (25Ephrussi A. Lehmann R. Nature. 1992; 358: 387-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 26Kim-Ha J. Kerr K. Macdonald P.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 403-412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Localized expression of Oskar protein is determined in part by translational silencing of the oskar mRNA outside of the posterior of the oocyte. This repression is mediated bycis-acting sequences in the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) ofoskar mRNA called Bruno response elements (BREs) and a corresponding trans-acting factor, the Bruno protein. Deletion of these BREs results in inappropriate translation of Oskar protein in the anterior end of the oocyte leading to embryos with two posterior poles. The Bruno protein is an RRM-containing protein present in oocytes. Extracts prepared from Drosophila ovaries recapitulate this Bruno-dependent translational repression of oskar mRNA in vitro (27Lie Y.S. Macdonald P.M. Development. 1999; 126: 4989-4996PubMed Google Scholar). By regulating the localized expression of Oskar, Bruno has a key role in germ cell formation and early embryogenesis. The Bruno protein is similar in domain structure to the Elav family of proteins (28Good P.J. Semin. Cell. Dev. Biol. 1997; 8: 577-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Members of this family provide examples of the diversity in RBP functions and regulatory mechanisms. The original member of this family, the elav gene, was identified inDrosophila through mutants with an embryoniclethal, abnormal visual system phenotype (20Yao K.M. Samson M.L. Reeves R. White K. J. Neurobiol. 1993; 24: 723-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). One mechanism of Elav protein function is to regulate the alternative splicing of a cell adhesion molecule (29Koushika S.P. Lisbin M.J. White K. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1634-1641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). A related gene in Drosophila, rbp9, functions in the cytoplasm during oogenesis and appears to control the accumulation of the Bag-of-Marbles protein, a regulator of oocyte differentiation (30Kim-Ha J. Kim J. Kim Y.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2505-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In vertebrates, four genes have been identified by similarity to theDrosophila elav gene (31Good P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4557-4561Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The corresponding proteins, which are detected both in the nucleus and the cytoplasm, bind to AU-rich elements in mRNA and can regulate the stability, translation, and localization of target mRNAs (28Good P.J. Semin. Cell. Dev. Biol. 1997; 8: 577-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 32Antic D. Keene J.D. Am. J. Hum. Gen. 1997; 61: 273-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Members of the Elav family play roles in regulating differentiation because overexpression of different family members enhances the differentiation of 1) 3T3-L1 cells into adipocytes (33Jain R.G. Andrews L.G. McGowan K.M. Pekala P.H. Keene J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 954-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), 2) the teratocarcinoma cell line N-Tera2 into neurons (34Antic D. Lu N. Keene J.D. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 449-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 35Antic D. Keene J.D. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 183-197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), 3) chicken neural crest stem cells into neurons (36Wakamatsu Y. Weston J.A. Development. 1997; 124: 3449-3460Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and 4) the PC12 pheochromocytoma cells into neurons (37Kasashima K. Terashima K. Yamamoto K. Sakashita E. Sakamoto H. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 667-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In embryos, overexpression of Elav-like proteins results in altered neural differentiation in both frogs (38Perron M. Furrer M.P. Wegnez M. Theodore L. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1999; 43: 295-303PubMed Google Scholar) and mice (39Akamatsu W. Okano H.J. Osumi N. Inoue T. Nakamura S. Sakakibara S. Miura M. Matsuo N. Darnell R.B. Okano H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9885-9890Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Thus, the Elav family has diverse roles in regulating development through several different mechanisms. The Xenopus laevis etr-1 gene previously was identified as a marker of the developing nervous system and is distantly related to theelav gene (40Knecht A.K. Good P.J. Dawid I.B. Harland R.M. Development. 1995; 121: 1927-1936PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, the Etr-1 protein was shown to be related to the Drosophila Bruno protein (41Webster P.J. Liang L. Berg C.A. Lasko P. Macdonald P.M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2510-2521Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Here we describe a family of human genes related to both Etr-1 and Bruno. The corresponding proteins have three RRMs and share a domain structure with the Elav family of proteins. We have characterized in detail two members of this family, the BRUNOL2 gene, which is ubiquitously expressed, and the BRUNOL3 gene, which is expressed preferentially in muscle, heart, and the nervous system. The BRUNOL2 and BRUNOL3 proteins bind to the same RNA sequence as theDrosophila Bruno protein, demonstrating a conservation of both protein sequence and RNA binding specificity. This binding occurs through the first two consecutive RRMs. The BRUNOL2 protein is identical to the CUGBP1, an RBP that binds to CUG repeats and is implicated in the etiology of the triplet repeat expansion disease myotonic dystrophy (42Timchenko L.T. Miller J.W. Timchenko N.A. DeVore D.R. Datar K.V. Lin L. Roberts R. Caskey C.T. Swanson M.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4407-4414Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Thus, members of this gene family may be involved in human disease as well as differentiation of specific cell types. The nomenclature for the genes in this family identified to date varies according to how the original clone was isolated. The original name for the family, Etr, e lav-type ribonucleoprotein, is easily confused with the Elav family of genes. Other names, CUGBP, CAGH4, and neuroblastoma apoptosis-relatedRNA-binding protein (NAPOR) (see text) define limited properties of only one or two genes. Because the genes in this family are highly related by sequence, we propose a standard nomenclature to clearly identify this relationship. Similar to the Elav family, we propose that this family be named for the Drosophila member of the family, Bruno. According to the HUGO nomenclature (43White J.A. McAlpine P.J. Antonarakis S. Cann H. Eppig J.T. Frazer K. Frezal J. Lancet D. Nahmias J. Pearson P. Peters J. Scott A. Scott H. Spurr N. Talbot Jr., C. Povey S. Genomics. 1997; 45: 468-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), the human genes are named Bruno-like (BRUNOL), and each distinct gene receives a different number. The relationship of this nomenclature to that of previously isolated genes is as follows:BRUNOL1 = CAGH4 (44Margolis R.L. Abraham M.R. Gatchell S.B. Li S.H. Kidwai A.S. Breschel T.S. Stine O.C. Callahan C. McInnis M.G. Ross C.A. Hum. Genet. 1997; 100: 114-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar);BRUNOL2 = CUGBP1 (42Timchenko L.T. Miller J.W. Timchenko N.A. DeVore D.R. Datar K.V. Lin L. Roberts R. Caskey C.T. Swanson M.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4407-4414Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar); andBRUNOL3 = ETR-3 (45Lu X. Timchenko N.A. Timchenko L.T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) or NAPOR1, -2, and -3 (46Choi D.K. Ito T. Mitsui Y. Sakaki Y. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 223: 21-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The name of the genes in other species uses the nomenclature appropriate to that species. Sequences of the human Bruno proteins were identified by searching the GenBankTM expressed sequence tag (EST) and high throughput genomic sequence (HTGS) data bases with the frog BrunoL-1 protein sequence using TBLASTN. Unless otherwise noted, EST cDNA clones were obtained either directly from the I.M.A.G.E. consortium or purchased from Research Genetics, American Type Culture Collection, or Genome Systems. Further sequencing of the cDNA clones was performed manually by Sequenase 2.0 dideoxy-sequencing reactions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The sequence was obtained either from templates generated by transposon insertion using vector oligonucleotides (47Strathmann M. Hamilton B.A. Mayeda C.A. Simon M.I. Meyerowitz E.M. Palazzolo M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1247-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) or from the original insert with synthetic oligonucleotide primers (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cDNA clone names sequenced to identify different Bruno contigs and the corresponding accession numbers for the sequences are identified in Table I. The clone F2607 was obtained from C.C. Liew (University of Toronto). The EST corresponding to HFBCC22 had two EcoRI inserts from two different genes. The 1.0-kilobase pair fragment corresponding to BRUNOL2 cDNA was subcloned and used for sequencing. For BRUNOL2, two cDNA clones that had an overlap of 440 base pairs were combined to obtain the sequence for the complete open reading frame. These two clones had a single difference, the addition of 12 base pairs in the linker region of the corresponding protein in clone HIBBL93 that was absent in HFBCC22.Table IEST and genomic clones corresponding to different human Bruno-like genesNameEST clones1-aThe clone name for EST clones sequenced to determine corresponding protein sequence.cDNA size1-bThe content of the cDNA in the EST clones.Genomic sequence1-cThe accession number of genomic sequences used to extract exon sequence.Accession no.BRUNOL1HIBBM44PartialAC068971AF284423BRUNOL2HFBCC22; HIBBL93FullAC019059AF248648BRUNOL3F2607FullAL157704U69546BRUNOL4172299; 221695; EST28405PartialAC015966AF248650AF248651BRUNOL5173660PartialAC005331; AC006505;AC010649AF248649BRUNOL6N.D.1-dN.D., not done.

Open table in a new tab For BRUNOL4 and BRUNOL5, the cDNA sequences do not encode the complete open reading frame so additional sequence information was extracted from the HTGS data base to identify the missing sequences. First, the corresponding cDNA sequences were used to identify genomic sequence corresponding to the respective cDNA. The accession numbers for the genomic sequences are in Table I. Then exons identical to the cDNA sequence were assembled to confirm the cDNA sequence. Finally, the missing exons were identified from TFASTA searches of the genomic sequence with the XenopusBrunoL-1 protein sequence. The conservation of sequence was sufficient to identify the missing exons, whereas a manual inspection of the sequence identified the precise exon boundaries. These missing exons were assembled to complete a full-length predicted open reading frame. For Fig. 1 B, the full-length sequence is predicted from the genomic sequence, while Isoform A and Isoform B are predicted from EST clones I.M.A.G.E.:2340766 and I.M.A.G.E.:221695, respectively. For BRUNOL6, the complete predicted open reading frame was extracted from the HTGS sequence by similarity to theXenopus BrunoL-1 protein. Chromosome location was obtained from public data bases of radiation hybrid maps using sequence-tagged sites linked to either cDNA or genomic clones. The data were obtained from the UniGene data base and GeneMap'99 web site. A similar strategy of data base searching was used to identify genes in other species. In C. elegans, the cDNA clone yk109f3, encoding the Etr-1 protein, was obtained from Yuji Kohara and sequenced (Accession no. U53931). This cDNA corresponds to gene T01D1.2. In Drosophila, the same genomic DNA clone that encodes the 3′-end of thearrest (bruno) gene also contains exons that encode a related protein, Dm Bruno-2. 2Berkelely Drosophila Genome Project (1999) Accession no. AC005711. Additional exons encoding a protein (Dm Bruno-3) related to Bruno are present at a different chromosomal location. 3M. Adams and J. C. Venter (1999) Accession no. AC017632.

An EST fromHalocynthia roretzi encodes a putative protein corresponding to the first two RRMs of a Bruno protein. 4K. W. Makabe (1999) Accession no.AV384552. Mouse EST clones I.M.A.G.E.:467796 and I.M.A.G.E.:474835 were partially sequenced and shown to encode the mouse orthologs of BRUNOL2 andBRUNOL4, respectively. 5P. Good and D. Herring, unpublished data. Suzukiet al. (52Suzuki H. Maegawa S. Nishibu T. Sugiyama T. Yasuda K. Inoue K. Mech. Dev. 2000; 93: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) recently reported the identification of the zebrafish etr-1 (brunol-1) and brul(brunol-2) genes. Other Bruno genes in rat, mouse, and zebrafish identified by data base searching were detected but are not reported because of their orthologous relationship to the genes described in this report. Sequence analysis was performed with web-based searches of data bases through the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and using the GCG suite of programs (Wisconsin Package Version 8.0, Genetics Computer Group (GCG), Madison, WI). The multiple sequence alignment was produced with the GCG Pileup program, whereas the tree dendrogram was produced with ClustalW and then displayed with TreeView. The cDNA inserts for BRUNOL2and BRUNOL3 were labeled by random-primed synthesis in the presence of [32P]dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and used to probe a human tissue Northern blot (CLONTECH; Catalog 7760–1) with hybridization and washing conditions as described previously (53Good P.J. Rebbert M.L. Dawid I.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 999-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Following washing, the filter was exposed to a phosphorstorage screen for 24 h, and the signal was detected with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). General molecular biology methods were as described in Sambrook et al. (54Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Primers used to amplify cDNA inserts are listed in TableII. To express BrunoL proteins in bacteria, cDNA inserts where inserted into the pET30 expression vector (Novagen). For human BRUNOL1, mouse BrunoL-2, and mouse BrunoL-4, inserts from an EST clone, clones HIBBM44, I.M.A.G.E.:467796, and I.M.A.G.E.:474835, respectively, were ligated into the appropriate pET30 expression vector to produce an in-frame His-tagged protein. ForXenopus BrunoL-1, the third RRM was PCR-amplified with the XBrunoL-1 RRM3 AUG primer and a vector oligo using a plasmid DNA template (40Knecht A.K. Good P.J. Dawid I.B. Harland R.M. Development. 1995; 121: 1927-1936PubMed Google Scholar) and inserted into pET30 between the NcoI andXhoI sites. For Xenopus BrunoL-3 and human BRUNOL3, the full-length open reading frame was amplified from a plasmid template with a primer encoding the putative AUG start codon and a vector primer and inserted into pET30 between the NcoI and SmaI sites. For human BRUNOL2, primers encoding the putative AUG start codon and an antisense primer in the 3′-UTR were used to amplify the cDNA from human brain cDNA (Invitrogen). The resulting PCR product was subcloned into pUC18 and sequenced to verify the identity of the clone. This cDNA was excised from pUC18 with BspLU11I and SalI and inserted into pET30 between the NcoI and XhoI sites. The expression plasmid for the Xenopus ElrC will be described elsewhere. 6P.

Open table in a new tab Using the nomenclature from the legend to Fig. 6, plasmids encoding R1–1, R1–2, R1R2, and R1R2link were made by digesting the full-length pET30/XBrunoL-3 with EcoRI, NcoI,PvuII, and StuI, respectively, further digesting with XhoI at the 3′-end of the insert, filling in overhanging ends with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I, and religation with T4 DNA ligase. Following transformation in bacteria, the correct plasmids were selected by size and restriction enzyme pattern. For the plasmid encoding LinkR3, the originalXenopus BrunoL-3 cDNA insert was digested withNcoI and XhoI and inserted into pET30 between theNcoI and XhoI sites. For the plasmid encoding R2, the RRM2 sequences were amplified with PCR primers from the originalXenopus BrunoL-3 cDNA insert and subcloned into pGEM-T Easy according to the instructions from the supplier (Promega). This insert was further subcloned into pET30 between the NcoI andXhoI sites. Mutations in the conserved RNP1 motif of the first two RRMs were introduced using PCR-based mutagenesis. For both the first and second RRMs, the conserved aromatic amino acids in the RNP1 motif were changed to leucine residues. For RRM1,101KGCCFVTF108 was changed to101KGCCLVTL108, whereas for RRM2,190RGCAFVTF197 was changed to190RGCALVTL197. The entire open reading frame for Xenopus BrunoL-3 was amplified with a PCR primer encoding the putative AUG codon (XBrunoL-3 AUG) and a T7 vector primer from the original cDNA insert6 and inserted into pGEM-T Easy. This parent plasmid was mutagenized using synthetic oligonucleotides using the ExSite mutatgenesis kit according to the supplier's instructions (Stratagene). The subsequent insert was sequenced to confirm the mutation before inserting into theBamHI site of pGEX3X. To make mutations in both the first and second RRMs, a plasmid with a mutation in the first RRM was subjected to a second round of mutagenesis to change the second RRM. Both pET30- and pGEX3X-based expression plasmids were transformed into BLR(DE3)::pLysS cells (Novagen), protein expression was induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and soluble proteins were prepared from sonicated cell lysates according to the Novagen pET system manual. The glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins were purified by glutathione-agarose affinity chromatography and dialyzed into Bruno binding buffer (6 mmHepes, pH 7.9, 30 mm KCl, and 2 mmMgCl2). The UV-cross-linking assay was performed as described by Webster et al. (41Webster P.J. Liang L. Berg C.A. Lasko P. Macdonald P.M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2510-2521Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The plasmids p116 (BRE) and p120 (BREM) (Phillipa Webster, Department of Genetics,"

It contains an extraordinarily elongated loop because of an unique insertion of 12–16 amino acids compared with the other members of tumor necrosis factor family. Biological implication of the frame insertion has not been clarified. We have determined the crystal structure of TRAIL in a complex with the extracellular domain of death receptor DR5 at 2.2 Å resolution. The structure reveals extensive contacts between the elongated loop and DR5 in an interaction mode that would not be allowed without the frame insertion. These interactions are missing in the structures of the complex determined by others recently. This observation, along with structure-inspired deletion analysis, identifies the critical role of the frame insertion as a molecular strategy conferring specificity upon the recognition of cognate receptors. The structure also suggests that a built-in flexibility of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family members is likely to play a general and important role in the binding and recognition of tumor necrosis factor family members.

Ligands belonging to the TNF family are expected to function as a homotrimer as suggested by the crystal structures of a subset of the family (TNFα, TNFβ, CD40L, and TRAIL). The monomeric unit of these proteins contains two β-pleated sheets, which form a β-sandwich conforming to the jellyroll topology. The TNFR family members are transmembrane proteins with several exceptions that contain an extracellular domain only. The extracellular domain of the receptors is characterized by the concatenated cysteine-rich domains (CRDs) (5Bazan J.F. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 603-606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) that are responsible for ligand binding. Although most of the intracellular domains of the receptor family members are not conserved, those of a subset of the receptors contain a common death domain. It is a protein-protein interaction motif that recruits cellular partners and ultimately activates a protease cascade leading to apoptosis. Despite the same structural scaffolds, namely the β-sandwich for the TNF family and the concatenated CRDs for the TNFR family, the recognition between cognate ligands and receptors is achieved in a highly specific manner with typical dissociation constants in nanomolar range. TRAIL is a recently identified member of the TNF family (6Wiley S.R. Schooley K. Smolak P.J. Din W.S. Huang C.P. Nicholl J.K. Sutherland G.R. Smith T.D. Rauch C. Smith C.A.

Immunol. 1998; 28: 1492-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). An unique feature of TRAIL distinguished from those of other TNF family members is an insertion of 12–16 amino acids (depending on the proteins compared with) near the N terminus (9Cha S.-S.

Furthermore, repeated intravenous injections of TRAIL in nonhuman primates did not cause detectable toxicity to normal tissues and organs, including liver tissues (23Ashkenazi A. Pai R.C. Fong S.

A working hypothesis for the selective antitumoral activity of TRAIL is that the decoy receptors are preferentially expressed in normal cells compared with tumor cells and interfere with the TRAIL action (13Pan G.

The structure of TRAIL-receptor complex should provide valuable insights into molecular recognition between the two families that are rapidly expanding. Recently, two crystal structures of TRAIL in complex with the extracellular domain of DR5 (sDR5) were reported (26Hymowitz S.G. Christinger H.W. Fuh G. Ultsch M. O'Connell M. Kelley R.F.

However, neither of them sheds light on biological implication of the frame-insertion in the AA"" loop. In this study, we independently determined the 2.2 Å crystal structure of TRAIL-sDR5 complex. It reveals extensive interactions of the AA"" loop with the receptor, whereas previous structures show virtually no interaction between the two. The newly revealed binding mode accurately reflects previous and a new deletion analyses of the loop and enables us to correctly highlight molecular strategies for controlling specificity between members of the TNF and TNFR superfamilies. Active human TRAIL (residues 114–281) was expressed and purified as a soluble form fromEscherichia coli (9Cha S.-S. Kim M.-S. Choi Y.H. Sung B.-J. Shin N.K. Shin H.-C. Sung Y.C. Oh B.-H. Immunity. 1999; 11: 253-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). sDR5 gene (encoding residues 1-130) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from human fetal cDNA library. The gene was inserted into the downstream of the T7 promoter on the expression plasmid pET-21b(+), and the plasmid was introduced in E. coli strain BL21 (DE3). Cells were grown to an A 600 of approximately 0.4 in Luria-Bertani medium containing 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C, and the expression of sDR5 was induced by 0.5 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside. After 7 h induction at 27 °C, cells were harvested and resuspended in a 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) and disrupted by sonication. After centrifugation, supernatants were consecutively loaded on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Qiagen) and Hi-Trap Q (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) columns. The purified TRAIL and sDR5 were mixed in 1:1 molar ratio. After 12 h of incubation at 4 °C, the mixture was loaded on Superdex 200 HR 10/30 sizing column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The fractions containing the TRAIL-sDR5 complex were collected and used for crystallization. Crystals of the complex were obtained using a precipitant solution containing 16% polyethylene glycol 3000, 0.05 m sodium acetate (pH 4.5), 0.55m sodium acetate, and 0.6 m NaCl. The crystals belonged to the space group P21 with cell dimensions a = 68.63, b = 124.81,c = 128.37 Å, and β = 104.49°. The asymmetric unit contained two trimeric complexes of TRAIL and sDR5. A 2.2 Å data set was collected using x-ray beam (λ= 1.0 Å) from the BL6A beamline at the Photon Factory (Japan) and processed with the programs DENZO and SCALEPACK (32Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

The favorable crystal packing of the two solutions with marginal space for sDR5 molecules confirmed the correctness of the solutions. The initial electron densities obtained by solvent flattening and 2-fold noncrystallographic symmetry density averaging using the CCP4 suite (33CCP4 Acta Crystallogr. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19668) Google Scholar) allowed us to build a partial sDR5 model. As the manual fitting and structure refinement were in progress, weak but continuous electron densities extended from Arg-130 became stronger, obviously showing features of the side chains of residues 130–135 on the AA"" loop. Crystallographic refinements, iterative map calculations, and model building were done using the programs X-PLOR (34Brünger, A. T. (1992) X-PLOR, Version 3.843. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT.Google Scholar) and program O (35Jones T.A. Kjeldgaard M. O , version 5.9. Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden1993Google Scholar). The 2-fold noncrystallographic symmetry restraints were maintained only for TRAIL until the last refinement cycle. From the beginning of the refinement, 5% of the total reflections were set aside for monitoring R freevalue.

TRAIL deletion mutant (Δ132–135) was constructed using the overlapping polymerase chain reaction method as reported (36Du Z. Regier D.A. Desrosiers R.C. BioTechniques. 1995; 18: 376-378PubMed Google Scholar). The correct construction and expression were verified by nucleotide sequencing, mass spectrometry, and circular dichroism spectroscopy. Measurement of the apparent K D values between sDR5 and wild type and Δ132–135 TRAIL was carried out using a BIAcore 2000 biosensor (Biosensor, Sweden). sDR5 (30 μg/ml in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.6) was covalently bound to the carboxylated dextran matrix at a concentration of 998 response units by an amine coupling method as suggested by the manufacturer. A flow path involving two cells was employed to simultaneously measure kinetic parameters from one flow cell containing sDR5-immobilized sensor chip and the other flow cell containing an underivatized chip. For kinetic measurements, TRAIL samples, ranging from 300 to 900 nm were prepared by dilution with the HBS buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0.005% polysorbate, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). Injection of each of 80 μl of TRAIL solution into the flow cells (association phase) was followed by the flow of the HBS buffer (dissociation phase), both at 30 μl/min. Between cycles, the immobilized ligand was regenerated by injecting 30 μl of 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1.0m NaCl at 10 μl/min. All experiments were performed at 25 °C. The kinetic parameters were determined by nonlinear regression analysis according to 1:1 binding model using the BIAevaluation version 2.1 software provided by the manufacturer. The cytotoxic activity of TRAIL variants were measured on human SK-HEP-1 hepatoma cells (American Type Culture Collection HTB-52). Briefly, a total of 50 μl of the cells in 10% fetal bovine serum and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was transferred to individual wells of 96-well microplates at a density of 1 × 104 cells/well. Wild type or the mutant TRAIL diluted in the 50 μl of the same medium was added to the wells at various concentrations (0–1 μg/ml), and the cells were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. Cell viability was determined by measuring the cellular metabolic activity with 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (thiazoyl blue, Sigma-Aldrich) added to the medium at a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. Absorbance was measured at 540 nm. We obtained the crystals of the TRAIL-sDR5 complex whose crystal packing is totally different from those of the other two crystals of the complex reported earlier (26Hymowitz S.G. Christinger H.W.

Chen N. Xu X.-N. Stuart D.I. Jones E.Y. Screaton G.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 1048-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The crystals contained six molecules of TRAIL and sDR5 (two trimeric complexes) in the asymmetric unit and provided six independent views. The structure of the complex was determined by molecular replacement (TableI) and refined to 2.2 Å resolution. The final model consists of TRAIL residues 120–135 and 146–281 in each monomer, sDR5 residues 21–128 of two copies, and residues 21–102 and 116–123 of the other four copies, two metal ions, and 162 water molecules. Residues 1–20 of sDR5 are completely disordered. In this section, we mainly describe the new findings obtained from this study and their biological implications. However, we refrain from describing structural features common in the three complex structures such as the interactions between TRAIL and sDR5 at the lower and upper contact regions (see below). The overall structure of TRAIL in a complex with sDR5 is virtually the same as that of the uncomplexed TRAIL structure we reported earlier (9Cha S.-S. Kim M.-S. Choi Y.H. Sung B.-J. Shin N.K. Shin H.-C. Sung Y.C. Oh B.-H. Immunity. 1999; 11: 253-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). A TRAIL monomer contains two antiparallel β-pleated sheets that form a β-sandwich as a core scaffold and interacts with the adjacent subunits in a head-to-tail fashion to form a bell-shaped homotrimer. Structural variation between the uncomplexed and complexed TRAIL structures is concentrated in the loop regions, with dramatic differences observed in the AA"", CD, and EF loops (Fig. 1). The CD and EF loops that are disordered in the uncomplexed structure become ordered on binding to sDR5. The AA"" loop (residues 130–160) displays the most remarkable structural changes. Although the conformation of residues 146–160, which interact heavily with the core scaffold, is well maintained, the flexible segment composed of residues 130–145 (9Cha S.-S. Kim M.-S. Choi Y.H. Sung B.-J. Shin N.K. Shin H.-C. Sung Y.C. Oh B.-H. Immunity. 1999; 11: 253-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) undergoes a drastic positional change (Fig. 1). The initial part of the segment penetrates into the receptor-binding site and interacts with sDR5 (Fig.1 B). This translocation is manifested by the strong electron densities observed for residues 130–135 of all the six TRAIL molecules in the asymmetric unit. A TRAIL monomer contains a single cysteine, Cys-230. The cysteine residues from the three monomers are close to each other and form a triangular geometry with the three cysteinyl sulfur atoms as apexes. This triangular arrangement is perpendicular to the molecular 3-fold axis. A strong electron density observed near the cysteinyl sulfur atoms at the first cycle of the structure refinements indicated a metal binding. This is different from the structure of uncomplexed TRAIL (9Cha S.-S. Kim M.-S. Choi Y.H. Sung B.-J. Shin N.K. Shin H.-C. Sung Y.C. Oh B.-H. Immunity. 1999; 11: 253-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and that of TRAIL-sDR5 complex (Protein Data Bank code 1D4V) of Mongkolsapaya et al. (27Mongkolsapaya J. Grimes J.M. Chen N. Xu X.-N. Stuart D.I. Jones E.Y. Screaton G.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 1048-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), both of which were determined with refolded TRAIL. It is, however, consistent with the structure of TRAIL-sDR5 complex (Protein Data Bank code 1D0G) of Hymowitz et al. (26Hymowitz S.G. Christinger H.W. Fuh G. Ultsch M. O'Connell M. Kelley R.F. Ashkenazi A. de Vos A.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 563-571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar) in which the three cysteines chelate Zn2+ with the fourth coordination arm, Cl−. Removal of the Zn2+ by chelating agents was shown to result in a 90-fold decrease in apoptotic activity and a marked decrease in melting temperature (28Hymowitz S.G. O'Connell M.P. Ultsch M.H. Hurst A. Totpal K. Ashkenazi A. de Vos A.M. Kelley R.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 633-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Previously, we reported that refolded Zn2+-unbound TRAIL slowly converted into an inactive monomeric or dimeric form (9Cha S.-S. Kim M.-S. Choi Y.H. Sung B.-J. Shin N.K. Shin H.-C. Sung Y.C. Oh B.-H. Immunity. 1999; 11: 253-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Although the zinc site is buried in the trimeric interface (Fig. 1), and thus Zn2+binding cannot directly influence the binding affinity of TRAIL for the receptors, it must be critical for maintaining the active trimeric structure of the protein (26Hymowitz S.G.

The TRAIL receptors contain two repeats of extracellular CRDs, whereas other TNFR family members contain three or more CRDs (29Smith C.A. Farrah T. Goodwin R.G. Cell. 1994; 76: 959-962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1829) Google Scholar). sTNFR55 is composed of four CRDs; two central CRDs corresponding to the CRDs of TRAIL receptors, the N-terminal and the C-terminal CRDs. The basic repeating structural unit of the extracellular domain is a set of smaller modules that are the building blocks of CRDs (5Bazan J.F. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 603-606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 30Naismith J.H. Sprang S.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 74-79Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). sDR5 has modular composition of N1 (residues 28–41), A1+B2 (CRD1; residues 44–84), and A1+B2 (CRD2; residues 86–125) (Fig. 2 A). A1 and B2 modules are composed of 12–17 and 21–24 amino acids, respectively. They are defined by the consensus sequence Cys1-Xaa2-Gly-Xaa-Tyr (or Phe)-Xaa-Xaa4–9-Cys2 and Cys1-Xaa2-Cys2-Xaa3–6-Xaa5-Cys3-Thr-Xaa2–5-Asn-Thr-Val-Cys4, respectively (30Naismith J.H. Sprang S.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 74-79Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), where n in Xaan is the number of intervening amino acids. The A1 modules exhibit a single disulfide bond between Cys1 and Cys2, while the B2 module has two disulfide bonds (Cys1:Cys3 and Cys2:Cys4). The N1 module has only one disulfide bond but is structurally related to the B2 module (Fig. 2 B). Interestingly, in place of a N1 module in sDR5, a B2 module is located at the corresponding position in sTNFR55. Residues 28–34 of the N1 module, which is structurally homologous to the B2 module (Fig.2 B), are involved in tight backbone interactions with the A1 module in CRD1 of sDR5 (figure not shown), and these interactions are conserved in sTNFR55. Consequently, the domain conformation and the arrangement of CRD1 relative to the N1 module in sDR5 are virtually the same as those of the corresponding CRD relative to the B2 module in sTNFR55. A superposition of the structures of TRAIL-sDR5 and TNFβ-sTNFR55 discloses that the N1 module and CRD1 in sDR5 and the corresponding B2 module and CRD in sTNFR55 adopt virtually the same geometry on complex formation (Fig.3 A). The structurally similar B2 and N1 modules appear to be functionally replaceable without affecting receptor-binding mode.Figure 3Superposition of the ligand-receptor complexes and that of sDR5 molecules. A, the TRAIL-sDR5 and TNFβ−sTNFR55 complexes are superposed using only the structurally conserved Cα atoms on the β-sheets of the ligand molecules. Cα atoms are shown with the omission of TNFβ. sDR5 and sTNFR55 are shown in green and violet, respectively. TRAIL is in light green. B, the six sDR5 molecules with the ordered B2 modules in three TRAIL-sDR5 complex structures are superposed, showing the variation in the relative position of the B2 module in CDR2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The domain structures of TNFR family members are very flexible, as was first observed for sTNFR55 that adapts its structure to changes in solvent conditions or upon binding to TNFβ (31Naismith J.H. Devine T.Q. Kohno T. Sprang S.R. Structure. 1996; 4: 1251-1262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). A superposition of the TRAIL-sDR5 and TNFβ-sTNFR55 structures shows a clear difference in the relative orientation between CRD2 and the corresponding CRD of sTNFR55 (Fig. 3 A). A torsional angle change of ∼30° occurs at the connection (Gln-85) between CRD1 and CRD2 of sDR5 compared with sTNFR55 bound to TNFβ (Fig. 3 A). Apparently, the domain movement complements the geometric differences in the receptor-binding surfaces of the two ligands for specific interactions between pairs of residues. It probably is a common feature of the receptor family. The six sDR5 molecules in the asymmetric unit exhibit a large structural disparity in the B2 module of CRD2. Although the B2 module and the three successive residues at the C terminus in two sDR5 molecules are well ordered, those in the other four molecules are highly disordered. Because of different crys"
https://openalex.org/W2081163705,"Cytoplasmic dynein is a molecular motor complex consisting of four major classes of polypeptide: the catalytic heavy chains (HC), intermediate chains (IC), light intermediate chains (LIC), and light chains (LC). Previous studies have reported that the ICs bind near the N terminus of the HCs, which is thought to correspond to the base of the dynein complex. In this study, we co-overexpressed cytoplasmic dynein subunits in COS-7 cells to map HC binding sites for the ICs and LICs, as well as HC dimerization. We have found that the LICs bind directly to the N terminus of the HC, adjacent to and overlapping with the IC binding site, consistent with a role for the LICs in cargo binding. Mutation of the LIC P-loop had no detectable effect on HC binding. We detected no direct interaction between the ICs and LICs. Using triple overexpression of HC, IC and LIC, we found that both IC and LIC are present in the same complexes, a result verified by anti-IC immunoprecipitation of endogenous complexes and immunoblotting. Our results indicate that the LICs and ICs must be located on independent surfaces of cytoplasmic dynein to allow each to interact with other proteins without steric interference.

Our results indicate that the LICs and ICs must be located on independent surfaces of cytoplasmic dynein to allow each to interact with other proteins without steric interference. heavy chain intermediate chain light intermeditate chain light chain Cytoplasmic dynein is a very large complex that functions as a minus-end-directed microtubule-based motor protein (1Paschal B.M. Vallee R.B. Nature. 1987; 330: 181-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Dynein has been implicated in many cellular functions, including several aspects of mitosis, as well as a variety of interphase processes, including vesicle transport and organelle positioning (2Vallee R.B. Sheetz M.P. Science. 1996; 271: 1539-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The dynein complex has been found to be made up of a number of subunit classes: heavy chains (HC),1 intermediate chains (IC), light intermediate chains (LIC) and light chains (LC). All cytoplasmic dynein subunits except for the LICs have homology with subunits of axonemal dynein, the motor complex that powers flagellar and ciliary beating. The organization of the subunits within the complex is not fully known. The cytoplasmic dynein complex is two-headed, with each head being attached to a stem; the stems come together to form a base, which is involved in attachment to cargo. The head structure contains four ATPase consensus sequences, which are thought to power the motor (3Holzbaur E.L. Vallee R.B. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 339-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Additional insight into the structure of the heavy chain has recently been gained with the identification of a specific microtubule binding site that lies at the tip of a small stalk protruding from the dynein head (4Gee M.A. Heuser J.E. Vallee R.B. Nature. 1997; 390: 636-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The stalk seems to be responsible for force transmission between the globular portion of the motor domain and the microtubule surface. The ICs have been localized by immunoelectron microscopy to the base of the dynein complex (5Steffen W. Hodgkinson J.L. Wiche G. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 117: 227-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In this position, they are perfectly situated for binding to dynactin and other targeting or cargo polypeptides. Recently, the IC interaction site was mapped to the N-terminal region of the heavy chain sequence, the region thought to form the base, usingDictyostelium cytoplasmic dynein subunits (6Habura A. Tikhonenko I. Chisholm R.L. Koonce M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15447-15453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The HC dimerization site was deduced to be immediately C-terminal to the IC binding site. The location of the light intermediate chains within the dynein complex is unknown. We have recently found that LIC1 binds specifically to pericentrin (7Purohit A. Tynan S.H. Vallee R. Doxsey S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 481-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 8Tynan S.H. Purohit A. Doxsey S.J. Vallee R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32763-32768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), a centrosomal protein, which is known to be transported to the centrosome in a dynein-dependent fashion (9Young A. Dictenberg J. Purohit A. Tuft R. Doxsey S.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2047-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). These results have revealed a targeting function for the LICs. This study was initiated to gain further insight into the apparent function of the LICs in targeting. To this end, we have mapped their binding site within the dynein complex and compared it to the sites for IC binding and HC dimerization. We have found that the LICs, as well as the ICs, bind to the base of the complex, putting them both in position to be involved in targeting. Additionally, we have shown that the LICs and ICs bind to the heavy chain on overlapping binding sites, but we detect no contact between them, suggesting that the LICs and ICs are on distinct surfaces of the dynein complex and may interact independently with other structures. LIC1-myc, LIC2-myc, LIC1-myc, and LIC2-myc point mutants, IC-myc, HC-FLAG, HC-C1140-myc, HC-C260-myc, and HC-N1137-FLAG constructs are described elsewhere (4Gee M.A. Heuser J.E. Vallee R.B.

Additional HC 5′-end constructs were made by adding a myc tag at the appropriate location using polymerase chain reaction, then cloning into HC-C1140-myc in the pARK vector at the PmlI site of HC. The entire clone was then inserted into pCMVβ (CLONTECH) from which the β-galactosidase sequence had been removed by NotI (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA) digestion. Other HC fragments were made by adding NotI sites, myc tag, and Kozak sequence by polymerase chain reaction using VENT DNA polymerase (New England BioLabs), followed by NotI digestion and direct cloning intoNotI-digested pCMVβ.

Immunoprecipitations were performed using protein G (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) beads or M2 affinity resin (Sigma) overnight at 4 °C with gentle agitation. Beads were washed five times with modified RIPA buffer and eluted with 2× SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer at 100 °C for 3 min. The entire eluate and a sample of the supernatant were used for immunoblotting. Co-transfection efficiency was detected as noted in the companion paper (8Tynan S.H. Purohit A. Doxsey S.J. Vallee R.B.

To begin to develop a clear picture of how the cytoplasmic dynein subunits are associated with each other, we used co-overexpression and immunoprecipitation of various combinations of dynein subunits to test whether one subunit would co-precipitate the other. In these experiments, the high levels of protein being used minimize the contribution of indirect interactions that are mediated by endogenous protein, as demonstrated by negative results (Fig.1 C) and triple overexpression (see Fig. 5).Figure 6Mapping of LIC and IC binding sites within the cytoplasmic dynein HC.

The IC and LIC do not co-precipitate (Fig. 1 C), suggesting that they bind independently to the HC. In previous work (8Tynan S.H. Purohit A. Doxsey S.J. Vallee R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32763-32768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) we found that pericentrin binding by LIC1 and LIC multimerization were not affected by point mutations in the P-loop sequences (LIC1: Lys80 to Glu; Thr81 to Ala; LIC2: Lys67 to Glu). Fig.2 shows that these same point mutations do not appreciably affect HC binding. The IC has been reported to interact with the HC near the N terminus (6Habura A. Tikhonenko I. Chisholm R.L. Koonce M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15447-15453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This region is likely to be located at the base of the complex where the ICs have been observed by electron microscopy to be located at the base (5Steffen W. Hodgkinson J.L. Wiche G. J. Struct.

We used HC fragments to identify the general location of LIC binding. In this experiment, we overexpressed HC and HC fragments in COS-7 cells, immunoprecipitated them, and then looked for co-precipitating endogenous subunits (Fig.3). Full-length HC and the N-terminal fragment (C1140-myc) co-immunoprecipitated IC, LIC1, and LIC2, whereas the C-terminal three quarters of the HC (N1137-FLAG) did not precipitate any endogenous dynein subunits. Previously, we demonstrated that LIC1 and LIC2 binding to the dynein heavy chain is mutually exclusive, thus suggesting that the LICs specify different subtypes of dynein and that LICs can function as targeting subunits of dynein (8Tynan S.H. Purohit A. Doxsey S.J. Vallee R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32763-32768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The ICs also function in targeting, so it is possible that the LICs are alternative to the ICs and that only one of the subunits would be present in a dynein molecule. Previous studies (12Dillman III, J.F. Pfister K.K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1671-1681Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 13Dillman III, J.F. Dabney L.P. Karki S. Paschal B.M. Holzbaur E.L. Pfister K.K. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6742-6752Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have demonstrated that anti-IC immunoprecipitations co-precipitate polypeptides of 50–55 kDa, the identities of which have not been conclusively determined. To determine conclusively whether LICs and ICs are present in the same complex, we took two approaches, first, we immunoprecipitated endogenous dynein complex from COS-7 cells using anti-IC antibody 74.1 and probed the immunoprecipitate with anti-HC, IC, and LIC polyclonal antibodies (Fig. 4). The results show that both LIC1 and LIC2 are co-immunoprecipitated with IC and are capable of binding to IC-containing dynein. As an alternative approach to this question, and as a control to the other co-immunoprecipitation experiments, we performed a triple overexpression and immunoprecipitation experiment. In this case, we overexpressed the myc-tagged N terminus of HC with myc-tagged IC and LIC1, immunoprecipitated LIC, and probed for all of the subunits with anti-myc antibody. Fig. 5 shows that IC co-immunoprecipitates in the triple expression, confirming the previous result that LICs and ICs can co-exist in dynein complexes. To further our understanding of dynein subunit interactions, we created numerous rat HC expression constructs for mapping LIC and IC binding sites within the rat cytoplasmic dynein HC. The summary of mapping co-immunoprecipitations is shown in Fig. 6 (data from several of the fragments is shown in Fig. 7). From comparison of overlapping and contiguous fragments, we have deduced the LIC and IC binding sites, shown at the bottom of each panel. Comparison of LIC1 and LIC2 indicated that the binding sites are identical, as predicted. The LIC binding site was found to lie between amino acids 649 and 800 on the rat HC and the IC binding site between amino acids 446 and 701. Fig. 8shows a summary of co-immunoprecipitations using the HC fragments with full-length HC (several examples of the data are shown in Fig.9). These results indicate that HC dimerization is mediated by an extended region of the HC sequence, which includes the LIC and IC binding regions, and extends more toward the motor (head) domain than the subunit binding sites. Interestingly, there is a region at the extreme N terminus that does not show binding to any of the subunits tested, including HC itself. We note that in the HC-flag/HC-myc co-immunoprecipitation (see Fig. 9, top panel) overexposure of the Western blot revealed numerous myc-reactive degradation products that are absent from the immunoprecipitate. Because the myc tag is located at the C terminus, this result provides independent evidence that C-terminal fragments do not bind to the full-length HC. In this study, we have found that the cytoplasmic dynein ICs and LICs bind directly to the HC, and we have mapped the LIC and IC binding sites within the rat cytoplasmic dynein HC sequence. Both subunits bind to the N terminus of the HC, with their binding sites overlapping within the primary sequence. Despite the close proximity of their binding sites, we have detected no interaction between the ICs and LICs. However, we have demonstrated that they co-immunoprecipitate in the presence of HC, indicating that they interact indirectly through this polypeptide. Additionally, we have found that the LIC1 and LIC2 binding sites on the HC are identical. Finally, we have found that a large portion of the N-terminal region of the HC, including, but substantially greater than, the IC and LIC binding regions, is responsible for HC dimerization. In previous work (7Purohit A. Tynan S.H. Vallee R. Doxsey S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 481-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 8Tynan S.H. Purohit A. Doxsey S.J. Vallee R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32763-32768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) we tested numerous dynein and dynactin subunits for the ability to bind to pericentrin and found that only LIC1 interacts. Because pericentrin has been found to be transported to the centrosome in a dynein-dependent fashion (9Young A. Dictenberg J. Purohit A. Tuft R. Doxsey S.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2047-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), our data supported a role for LIC1 in mediating the binding of dynein to this particular form of cargo. The localization of the LIC binding site to the N terminus of the heavy chain, which presumably places the LICs at the base of the dynein complex, further supports a targeting role. The LICs bind to a region of the rat heavy chain located between amino acids 649 and 800. Our previous work (8Tynan S.H. Purohit A. Doxsey S.J. Vallee R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32763-32768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) showed that LIC1 and LIC2 exhibit a high degree of sequence homology yet are present in distinct dynein complexes. Our finding that they share a common HC binding site, along with their inability to heterooligomerize (8Tynan S.H. Purohit A. Doxsey S.J. Vallee R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32763-32768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), suggests that they compete with each other for HC binding. The LIC and IC binding sites are distinct but overlapping within the HC primary sequence, as demonstrated by our co-immunoprecipitation results (Figs. 6 and 7). The LICs co-immunoprecipitate with the HC constructs N649C907 and C674 but not with N547C649. These results demonstrate that the part of the C674 HC fragment that contains LIC binding elements is between amino acids 649 and 674. This region is within the boundaries of the IC binding site, amino acids 446–701. Despite this clear overlap of the binding regions, we have found that LIC and IC can bind to a common dynein HC (Figs. 4 and 5), although they do not interact with each other directly when free in solution (Fig. 1). Presumably, the surfaces within the folded HC for LIC and IC binding must be topologically distinct to allow for independent binding (see below). Our results explain the observations of Gill et al. (14Gill S.R. Cleveland D.W. Schroer T.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 645-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), who observed that the ICs and LICs could be differentially extracted from the HC by potassium iodide. Other work (5Steffen W. Hodgkinson J.L. Wiche G. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 117: 227-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) showed that, when the ICs and LICs are removed from dynein, they will co-peak at low S on a sucrose gradient; however, there is no evidence that a direct interaction caused the co-sedimentation. The IC binding site within the Dictyostelium HC has been reported to lie between amino acids 629 and 730 (6Habura A. Tikhonenko I. Chisholm R.L. Koonce M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15447-15453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This region of theDictyostelium HC is homologous to amino acids 589–690 of the rat heavy chain and is similar to the IC binding site deduced from our current data (amino acids 446–701). However, we have found the N-terminal boundary of the binding site to lie between amino acids 446 and 549, upstream of the N-terminal boundary in theDictyostelium HC. This difference may reflect the phylogenetic distance between rat and Dictyostelium or differences in the sensitivities of the methods used for assaying polypeptide interactions (see below). Comparing the rat HC sequence to that of the Dictyostelium HC, there is a very high degree of homology within the IC binding region; the deducedDictyostelium binding site shows 64% identity (72% similarity) with the equivalent region of rat HC. Extending the binding site from rat HC amino acid 589 to 516 still gives 61% identity (69% similarity), but the degree of homology is considerably lower beyond this point. Based on these considerations, it seems reasonable to deduce that the IC binding site begins at or around amino acid 516 on the rat HC (amino acid 559 in Dictyostelium). Beyond the C-terminal end of the deduced IC binding site, a high degree of homology persists. This region corresponds to the remainder of the LIC binding site identified here (amino acids 649–800 of rat HC), which shows 56% identity (62% similarity) with the equivalentDictyostelium sequence. We have found that HC dimerization occurs across a large portion of the N-terminal region of the HC (amino acids 300–1140). Our data differ significantly in this regard from those of Habura et al.(6Habura A. Tikhonenko I. Chisholm R.L. Koonce M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15447-15453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), who found the Dictyostelium HC dimerization site to include amino acids 627–780 plus additional, unidentified sequence C-terminal to this region. A major difference in these two reports may involve the sensitivity of methods being used. Habura et al.(6Habura A. Tikhonenko I. Chisholm R.L. Koonce M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15447-15453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) used HC fragments translated in reticulocyte lysates and assayed for protein-protein interactions by cross-linking the fragments or by binding them to bacterially expressed HC. Cross-linking yielded fewer dimerizing fragments than did binding of in vitro translated HC fragments to bacterially expressed HC, suggesting (6Habura A. Tikhonenko I. Chisholm R.L. Koonce M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15447-15453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) that there are significant differences in sensitivities even between these methods. These approaches involve the use of low concentrations of fragment, in contrast to the co-overexpression method used here. Because of the higher levels of protein involved in our co-expression assay, it may be better suited for detecting partial binding sites (Figs. Figure 6, Figure 7, Figure 8, Figure 9 (7Purohit A. Tynan S.H. Vallee R. Doxsey S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 481-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 8Tynan S.H. Purohit A. Doxsey S.J. Vallee R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32763-32768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar)). We cannot tell whether the affinities of the partial binding sites differ. Conceivably, some of the interactions detected in our study could be nonspecific, but this possibility is disputed by several observations. First, several HC fragments that tested positive in the HC-HC interaction assay (for example, N907C1100 and N261C440, Figs.Figure 6, Figure 7, Figure 8, Figure 9) were clearly negative when tested against ICs and LICs. In addition, other fragments clearly interacted differentially with the LICs and ICs, with N547C649 interacting with IC but not LIC, and N758C907 interacting with LICs but not ICs (Figs. 6 and 7); only N649C907 showed interaction with all of the subunits tested (Figs.Figure 6, Figure 7, Figure 8, Figure 9). Finally, the co-immunoprecipitation assay has proven to be very selective in other contexts (7Purohit A. Tynan S.H. Vallee R. Doxsey S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 481-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 8Tynan S.H. Purohit A. Doxsey S.J. Vallee R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32763-32768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The HC-HC interaction site identified in the current study is much more extensive than those found for the ICs and LICs. We have shown that several HC fragments that do not bind to IC or LIC bind to HC, adding further support to the contention (6Habura A. Tikhonenko I. Chisholm R.L. Koonce M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15447-15453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 15Mazumdar M. Mikami A. Gee M.A. Vallee R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6552-6556Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) that the HCs do not need accessory subunits for dimerization. This important conclusion is further substantiated by the observation that LIC or IC co-overexpression was not required for HC-myc/HC-FLAG dimerization (see Figs. 8 and 9). Whether binding of LIC and IC to the HC requires HC dimerization is not clear. LIC and IC binding cannot be tested in the absence of HC dimerization using the fragments produced in the current study, and it remains to be seen whether such a test will be possible. We also note that the C-terminal boundary of the HC self-association domain determined in the current study ends between amino acids 900 and 1100. Previous work has suggested that the N terminus of the motor domain lies between amino acids 1137 and 1455 (4Gee M.A. Heuser J.E. Vallee R.B. Nature. 1997; 390: 636-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 16Samso M. Radermacher M. Frank J. Koonce M.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 927-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Our finding that the N1137 fragment of the HC does not bind to full-length HC is consistent with this model. Finally, there is a relatively short sequence at the N terminus extending to amino acid 300 that does not seem to be involved in binding to any of the subunits examined here. This region may play a role in binding to some of the LCs or other as yet unidentified proteins. Fig. 10 shows a representation of our current understanding of the structural organization of the dynein complex. Although the IC and LIC binding sites overlap within the HC primary sequence, both subunits are present in the same dynein pool as demonstrated by immunoprecipitation of endogenous LIC-containing dynein in COS-7 cells using anti-IC antibodies, as well as by triple overexpression and co-immunoprecipitation (Figs. 4 and 5). This suggests that the LICs and ICs must be associated with different surfaces of the complex. HC dimerization must occur on yet another surface of the HC based on similar considerations. This three-dimensional picture of the dynein complex would allow for the ICs to bind to the dynactin complex on one side of dynein, whereas LICs could bind cargo proteins, such as pericentrin, on a different dynein surface. Pericentrin may also be bound to other binding partners, such as the γ-tublin ring complex. It remains to be seen whether dynein can use dynactin-mediated and LIC-mediated interactions simultaneously and how such interactions would be orchestrated to maintain proper localization of various cellular components."

However, it was not clear whether both cooperate in this process. We show here that BiP and PDI act synergistically in the in vitro folding of the denatured and reduced Fab fragment. Several ATP-dependent cycles of binding, release, and rebinding of the unfolded antibody chains by BiP are required for efficient reactivation. Our data suggest that in the absence of BiP unfolded antibody chains collapse rapidly upon refolding, rendering cysteine side chains inaccessible for PDI. BiP binds the unfolded polypeptide chains and keeps them in a conformation in which the cysteine residues are accessible for PDI.

Immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein (BiP),1 an ER-located member of the Hsp70 chaperone family, was originally found noncovalently associated with immunoglobulin heavy chains (6Haas I.G. Wabl M. Nature. 1983; 306: 387-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). It is known that BiP associates transiently with a large number of newly synthesized proteins in the ER (7Hendershot L.M. Bole D. Kohler G. Kearny J.F. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 761-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 8Knittler M.R. Haas I.G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1573-1581Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 9Segal M.S. Bye J.M. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.-J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 227-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Like other Hsp70 proteins, BiP has a weak ATPase activity (10Kassenbrock C.K. Kelly R.B. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1461-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Binding of ATP is necessary for the release of peptides bound to BiP (11Wei L. Hendershot L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26670-26676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). BiP has a binding site selective for linear sequences of seven amino acids containing hydrophobic residues (12Blond-Elguindi S. Cwirla S.E. Dower W.J. Lipshutz R.J. Sprang S.R. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.-J. Cell. 1993; 75: 717-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Based on this binding algorithm, BiP binding sequences were identified in the light chain and in the VH, CH1 and CH3 domains of the heavy chain (13Knarr G. Gething M.-J. Modrow S. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27589-27594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). PDI is a homodimer of 55-kDa subunits, which catalyzes the formation of disulfide bonds (14Freedman R.B. Nall B.T. Ill K.A. Conformation and Forces in Protein Folding. American Association for the Advancement of Science, Washington, D. C.1991: 204-214Google Scholar). Because PDI also binds to different peptides that lack cysteines (15Noiva R. Kimura H. Roos J. Lennarz W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19645-19649Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it had been proposed that PDI acts not only as an enzyme but also as a chaperone (16Noiva R. Lennarz W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3553-3556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Wang C.C. Tsou C.L. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1515-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 18Wang C.C.

Wang C.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). However, in the refolding of antibody fragments, PDI has no chaperone-like effect but acts as an enzyme that catalyzes disulfide bond formation and reshuffling (20Lilie H. McLaughlin S. Freedman R. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14290-14296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The antibody Fab fragment is a good model system, because antibody domains contain a disulfide bond that is part of the hydrophobic core of the protein. We used the Fab fragment of the murine monoclonal antibody MAK33 (21Buckel P. Hübner-Parajsz C. Lenz H. Haug M. Beaucamp K. Gene ( Amst. ). 1987; 51: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) for examining the influence of BiP and PDI on the refolding and reoxidation of antibodies, because the effect of PDI on antibody reactivation had been investigated in detail before (20Lilie H. McLaughlin S. Freedman R. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14290-14296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PDI has to be present during the initial stages of folding to influence the reaction. This may be due to the kinetic competition between Fab structure formation and accessibility of the cysteines for PDI (20Lilie H. McLaughlin S. Freedman R. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14290-14296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here we addressed the question of whether the binding of unfolded antibody fragments to BiP may keep the cysteines accessible for PDI and whether these folding helpers cooperate in a synergistic way. Phosphocreatine, creatine phosphatase, apyrase, and BSA (RIA Grade) were from Sigma. MAK33 Fab was from Roche Diagnostics. Human PDI was expressed in Escherichia colistrain BL21(DE3). The pet 23a-based plasmid containing the coding sequence for PDI was obtained from R. Freedman and L. Ruddock (University of Kent, UK). Cells were grown at 37 °C in LB medium supplemented with 100 μg ml−1 ampicillin at anA600 of 0.6. Gene expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm. After 6–7 h, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Cell pellets were washed and resuspended in 0.1 m Tris/HCl, pH 8, 2 mm EDTA containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics). The cells were lysed using a disrupter (Constant Systems). After centrifugation (40,000 × g, 40 min, 4 °C) to remove debris, PDI was enriched by heat treatment and ammonium sulfate precipitation. First the cell extract was heated up to 54 °C and maintained at this temperature for 15 min. After cooling, the extract was centrifuged (40,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C), and the pellet was discarded. (NH4)2SO4 was added to the supernatant to 55% saturation. After stirring for 30 min at room temperature, the precipitate was centrifuged (40,000 ×g, 40 min, 4 °C), and the pellet was discarded. Further (NH4)2SO4 was added to a final saturation of 85%, and the material was centrifuged as before. The pellet was dissolved in 100 ml of 20 mmsodium-phosphate buffer, pH 6.3, and dialyzed against the same buffer. The dialyzed material was loaded on to a resource Q column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 20 mm sodium-phosphate buffer, pH 6.3. For elution, a linear NaCl gradient was applied. PDI was detected between 0.3 and 0.4 m NaCl by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Next, the PDI-containing fractions were bound to a hydroxylapathite column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.3, and eluted with a linear sodium phosphate gradient. The PDI-containing fractions were pooled and dialyzed overnight against 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, 300 mm NaCl, pH 6.3. The dialyzed fractions were applied to a Superdex 200-pg gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, 300 mm NaCl, pH 6.3. The protein was concentrated by Amicon ultrafiltration, dialyzed against 50 mm NH4HCO3, and freeze-dried. The freeze-dried enzyme was stored at −20 °C. The concentration of PDI was determined using the published extinction coefficient of E280, 0.1%1 cm = 0.795. Here molar concentrations refer to the dimer. Murine BiP was expressed in the E. coli strain M15. The pASK-based plasmid contains the coding sequence for BiP with a His6 tag at its COOH terminus (22Knarr G. Modrow S. Todd A. Gething M.-J. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29850-29857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Expression and purification was carried out basically as described previously (22Knarr G. Modrow S. Todd A. Gething M.-J. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29850-29857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Cell pellets were washed and resuspended in 40 mm Hepes (pH 7.0) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics) and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cells were lysed using a disrupter (Constant Systems). After centrifugation (40,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C) to remove debris, the supernatant was loaded on a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-Sepharose fast flow column. BiP was detected in a sharp peak at 150 mm imidazole. The fractions containing BiP were pooled, dialyzed overnight against 40 mm Hepes, 0.5 m NaCl, 5% glycerol, pH 7.5, and concentrated by Amicon ultrafiltration. The concentrated protein solution was applied to a Superdex 200-pg gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 40 mm Hepes, 0.5 m NaCl, 5% glycerol, pH 7.5. The protein was dialyzed overnight against 40 mm Hepes, 5% glycerol, pH 7.5, and concentrated by Amicon ultrafiltration. The protein was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −20 °C. The concentration of BiP was determined using the published extinction coefficient of E280, 0.1%1 cm = 0.395. Here molar concentrations refer to the monomer. Denaturation and renaturation of the proteolytically derived Fab fragment were carried out as described previously (20Lilie H. McLaughlin S. Freedman R. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14290-14296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Fab fragment was denatured in 6 m guanidinium chloride, 0.1 mTris, pH 8.0, for 2 h at 25 °C. Reduction of the disulfide bonds was achieved by adding 0.3 m dithioerythritol to the denaturation solution. Renaturation was initiated by diluting the denatured protein 100-fold into the buffer preincubated at 15 °C containing 0.1 m Tris, pH 7.0, with vigorous stirring for 10 s. The renaturation buffer contained in addition 6 mm GSSG, and the final concentration of DTE was 3 mm. In the cases indicated, the renaturation buffer was supplemented with an ATP-regenerating system containing 0.5 mm ATP, 10 mm phosphocreatine, and 35 units/ml creatine phosphatase. Refolding was carried out at 15 °C. The final concentrations during renaturation were 0.2 μm for Fab and 60 mm for guanidinium chloride. PDI was reduced in the presence of 1 mm dithioerythritol for 10 min before it was added to the renaturation buffer. Light chain and Fd fragment of MAK33 were expressed recombinantly in the E. coli strain BL21(DE3) harboring the plasmid for either the light chain or the Fd fragment (23Buchner J. Rudolph R. Nature Biotechnol. 1991; 9: 157-161Crossref Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Cells were grown at 37 °C in LB media supplemented with 100 μg ml−1 ampicillin at anA600 of 0.5. Gene expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm. After 24 h, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Inclusion body isolation and solubilization were performed as described previously (23Buchner J. Rudolph R. Nature Biotechnol. 1991; 9: 157-161Crossref Scopus (396) Google Scholar). The cell pellet was resolved in 0.1 mTris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.0, and incubated with 1.5 mg of lysozyme/g of cells for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were lysed with a disrupter (Constant Systems). The lysed cells were incubated with 10 μg of DNase I and 3 mm MgCl2 for 30 min at 25 °C to digest the DNA. The inclusion bodies were isolated by adding 0.5 volumes of 60 mm EDTA, 6% Triton X-100, 1.5m NaCl, pH 7.0, and incubation for 30 min at 4 °C. The inclusion body pellet was centrifuged (40,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C) and washed in 0.1 m Tris, 20 mmEDTA, pH 7.0. The pellet was resolved in 0.1 m Tris, 8m urea, 100 mm dithioerythritol, pH 8.0, and incubated for 2 h at 25 °C. After a pH shift to pH 4.0 and centrifugation (40,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C) the solution was dialyzed overnight against 5 m urea, pH 4.0. The purity and protein concentration of the preparations were checked by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Bradford assay (24Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). The ELISA assay was carried out as described previously (23Buchner J. Rudolph R. Nature Biotechnol. 1991; 9: 157-161Crossref Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 25Schmidt M. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16829-16833Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In short, dimeric muscle-specific human creatine kinase was attached to tubes using the biotin/streptavidin system. At the times indicated, aliquots of the refolding Fab fragment were diluted in ELISA buffer. To prevent further reactivation of the Fab fragment, the samples were kept on ice, and trypsin with a final concentration of 400 μg/ml was added. Binding of functionally refolded Fab fragments to dimeric muscle-specific human creatine kinase was detected by using peroxidase-coupled anti-mouse-IgG-antiserum. The amount of functionally reactivated protein was quantified by comparison with standard curves obtained with the authentic Fab fragment. ATPase activity of BiP was determined as described previously (13Knarr G. Gething M.-J. Modrow S. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27589-27594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The assay was carried out in the same buffer used for the refolding experiments (0.1 m Tris, pH 7.0, 50 mm KCl, and 2 mm MgCl2). 5 μm BiP was incubated at 37 °C with 500 μm (final concentration) unlabeled ATP and 10 μCi of [α-32P]ATP in a total volume of 30 μl. ATP hydrolysis was stopped after different times by adding EDTA (final concentration 24 mm). After thin layer chromatography on polyethyleneimine-cellulose (Merck), the ATP/ADP ratio was quantified with a Molecular Dynamics Storm 860 PhosphorImager. Hydrolysis rates were corrected for uncatalyzed, spontaneous ATP hydrolysis at the respective conditions. It had been shown previously that PDI influences the reactivation of denatured and reduced Fab fragments in vitro. Whereas in the absence of PDI hardly any refolding could be achieved, the presence of PDI lead to reactivation yields of about 20% (Ref. 20Lilie H. McLaughlin S. Freedman R. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14290-14296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and Fig.1). It is known that in vivoBiP associates transiently with immunoglobulin heavy and light chains (8Knittler M.R. Haas I.G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1573-1581Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 9Segal M.S. Bye J.M. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.-J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 227-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and BiP binding sequences were determined in the Fab fragment of antibodies (13Knarr G. Gething M.-J. Modrow S. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27589-27594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). It had therefore been proposed that BiP could act together with PDI in the folding of antibodies (20Lilie H. McLaughlin S. Freedman R. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14290-14296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we performed refolding experiments in the presence of either PDI, BiP, or both folding helpers. BSA was used to test whether nonspecific protein effects influence the reaction. As shown in Fig. 1, no reactivation could be achieved in the presence of BSA, whereas with PDI 20% reactivation was obtained, as described previously (20Lilie H. McLaughlin S. Freedman R. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14290-14296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of BiP alone, the reactivation yields were 15%. Surprisingly, when ATP was present in addition to BiP, no further increase in reactivation yields was observed. In the presence of PDI and BiP, 35% of the molecules reached the native state. This corresponds to the sum of the reactivation yields of BiP (15%) and PDI (20%). However, in the presence of BiP, PDI, and ATP, yields of 50% were observed (Fig. 1). This indicates that BiP and PDI act in a synergistic way and that this effect is ATP-dependent. Using radiolabeled [α-32P]ATP, we demonstrated that the ATPase of BiP did not lose activity during reactivation (48 h) and that the ATP-regenerating system stayed effective (data not shown). Next, we asked how the influence of BiP on the refolding reaction depends on the BiP/Fab ratio. We performed experiments in which different amounts of BiP were present during the refolding reaction. As shown in Fig. 2, reaction yields increased with increasing BiP concentrations up to a BiP/Fab ratio of about 10:1. This indicates that there is a kinetic competition between binding to BiP and rapid structure formation or misfolding. It had been shown that the effect of PDI on refolding decreased when PDI was added after the initiation of refolding with a half-time of less than 10 s. After 30 s, the addition of PDI no longer influenced the reactivation process (20Lilie H. McLaughlin S. Freedman R. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14290-14296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This effect was not due to a change in the redox environment, since the number of sulfhydryl groups did not change during this period of time (20Lilie H. McLaughlin S. Freedman R. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14290-14296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We reasoned that the positive effect of BiP on the reactivation of the Fab fragment could be due to prevention of structure formation. If this way BiP kept the cysteines accessible for PDI for a longer period of time, we should be able to increase the time span during which the addition of PDI is effective. To test this, we performed refolding experiments in the absence and presence of BiP, adding PDI at certain time points after the initiation of the refolding reaction. As shown in Fig.3, reactivation yields decreased dramatically when PDI was added after the initiation of refolding in the absence of BiP. After 3 min, the addition of PDI had no detectable effect on Fab reactivation. In the presence of BiP, however, an influence on the reactivation was still observed, when PDI was added 20 min after starting reactivation. The decrease of reactivation yields was 6 times slower than in the absence of BiP. From the previous experiments, it was clear that BiP influences the folding of the Fab fragment in an ATP-dependent way. However, it was not established whether this effect involves the interaction with one or both of the polypeptide chains of the Fab fragment. To answer this question, we used isolated Fd and light chain obtained as inclusion bodies after recombinant expression in E. coli. After denaturation and reduction of the respective inclusion body proteins, we performed folding reactions with either light chain or Fd in the presence or absence of BiP. In a second step, the individual folding reactants were combined and further incubated in the presence of PDI and ATP. As shown in Fig. 4, nearly the same reactivation yields were achieved for the complete Fab fragment and for Fd and light chain combined immediately after initiating reactivation. However, if light chain and Fd were combined after starting refolding, reactivation yields decreased dramatically from 20 to 5% within the first minute. When either Fd or light chain was preincubated in the presence of BiP, reactivation yields of 50% were achieved if the antibody chains were combined immediately. The reactivation yields decreased as fast as in the absence of BiP if the chains were combined after starting reactivation. However, when light chain and Fd were both preincubated in the presence of BiP, this decrease could be decelerated effectively. Since we did not observe any difference in the time course and yield of reactivation when either light chain or Fd were preincubated with BiP, it is obviously important for refolding that BiP binds to both antibody chains. In vivo, the folding and formation of disulfide bonds in antibody chains seems to start cotranslationally, and complete oxidation is achieved posttranslationally (26Bergman L.W. Kuehl M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 5690-5694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). During these processes, the antibody chains interact with PDI, which catalyzes formation and reshuffling of disulfide bonds (14Freedman R.B. Nall B.T. Ill K.A. Conformation and Forces in Protein Folding. American Association for the Advancement of Science, Washington, D. C.1991: 204-214Google Scholar). Although PDI shows chaperone-like activity independent of its isomerase activity in the refolding of proteins containing no disulfide bonds (27Cai H. Wang C.C. Tsou C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24550-24552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Song J.L. Wang C.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 312-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), the function of PDI in the folding of antibodies seems to be restricted to its isomerase activity (20Lilie H. McLaughlin S. Freedman R. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14290-14296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An influence of PDI on the folding of an antibody Fab fragment in vitro could be detected only when PDI was present during the initial phase of refolding. Based on these results, it was speculated that BiP may be able to keep the cysteine residues accessible for PDI (13Knarr G. Gething M.-J. Modrow S. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27589-27594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 20Lilie H. McLaughlin S. Freedman R. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14290-14296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) To test whether BiP and PDI cooperate in the folding of antibody chains, we performed in vitro folding experiments with the denatured and reduced Fab fragment of the monoclonal antibody MAK33 in the presence and absence of folding helpers. We were able to show that BiP and PDI act in a synergistic way, since the reactivation yields were not only the sum of the yields obtained in the presence of one of the folding factors. An unexpected feature of the folding of antibodies was revealed by experiments in which the antibody chains were first preincubated separately and then combined during reactivation. The yields decreased dramatically even after short times of separation during refolding, suggesting that contacts between the two chains are important already during early stages of folding. This explanation is in agreement with results showing that specific domain interactions can occur in reduced antibody domains. 2M. Thies and J. Buchner, unpublished results. The results presented here led to a model for the oxidative folding of antibodies in vitro shown in Fig.5. Starting from the denatured and reduced polypeptide chains, folding of the Fab fragment can occur in three different reactions. Under the conditions used, spontaneous reactivation in the absence of folding factors is not possible. However, after optimization of buffer conditions, as shown previously, up to 40% of the reduced and denatured Fab could be reactivated (23Buchner J. Rudolph R. Nature Biotechnol. 1991; 9: 157-161Crossref Scopus (396) Google Scholar). These experiments were performed in the presence of high concentrations of l-arginine. l-Arginine acts as a “labilizing” agent that preferentially destabilizes incorrectly folded or aggregation-prone species (29Rudolph R. Tschesche H. Modern Methods in Protein and Nucleic Acid Analysis. Walter de Gruyter, Berlin1990: 149-171Google Scholar, 30Buchner J. Pastan I. Brinkmann U. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 205: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Because the correctly folded species is not affected by arginine, the folding reaction is shifted toward the correctly folded structure by an iterative mechanism. This strong dependence of the folding on reaction conditions suggests that misfolding is a major factor in structure formation of antibodies in vitro. In the presence of PDI and under otherwise nonpermissive folding conditions, up to 20% of the molecules reach the native state when PDI is present from the start of reactivation. The limited ability of PDI to influence antibody folding may be explained by a kinetic competition between Fab structure formation and accessibility of the cysteines for PDI. The cysteines seem to become rapidly buried in the core of the folding polypeptide chains, and the influence of PDI on disulfide bond formation is therefore very inefficient. In the presence of PDI and BiP, the antibody chains take a much more efficient folding route. Binding to BiP seems to prevent the unfolded antibody chains from forming conformations in which the cysteines are buried. Several ATP-dependent cycles of binding, release, and rebinding are necessary for maximum oxidation of the antibody chains. As previously observed for other chaperones, an excess of BiP over Fab is required in this assay. This is due to the kinetic competition between unproductive folding reactions and the binding to BiP. It seems that BiP has to be able to trap the unfolded polypeptide chains rapidly at the beginning of refolding. In addition, repeated ATP-dependent binding and release cycles of BiP and Fab are required during reactivation. The ATP dependence of the reaction is in agreement with previous results, demonstrating that the release of peptides bound to BiP is dependent on its ATPase activity (31Gaut J.R. Hendershot L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7248-7255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Haas I.G. Experientia. 1994; 50: 1012-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 33Hendershot L.M. Wei L. Gaut J. Melnick J. Aviel S. Argon Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5269-5274Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). During these ATP-dependent cycles, PDI may bind to the antibody chains simultaneously with BiP or after BiP is released from the polypeptide chain. In this context, it remains to be seen how co-chaperones and additional ER-specific folding helpers such as Grp94, PPI, calreticulin, and calnexin (2Stevens F.J. Argon Y. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 443-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 5Bergeron J.J. Brenner M.B. Thomas D.Y. Williams D.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 19: 124-128Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (455) Google Scholar) modulate the effects of BiP and PDI on antibody folding. Specifically, Hsp70 proteins are known to be regulated by J-domain-containing proteins (34Bukau B. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2397) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated inSaccharomyces cerevisiae that BiP (Kar2p) interacts with at least three ER-located HSP70 proteins, Sec63p (35Feldheim D. Rothblatt J. Schekman R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3288-3296Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 36Misselwitz B. Staeck O. Rapoport T.A. Mol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 12889-12892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Three DnaJ domain-containing proteins have been found in mammalian cells: Mtj1p, Sec63p (39Brightman S.E. Blatch G.L. Zetter B.R. Gene ( Amst. ). 1995; 153: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 40Skowronek M.H. Rotter M. Haas I.G. Biochemistry. 1999; 380: 1133-1138Google Scholar), and a Scj1p homolog (ERj3p) (41Bies C. Guth S. Janoschek K. Nastainczyk W. Volkmer J. Zimmermann R. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 1175-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Yeast Sec63p interacts with the ATP-bound form of BiP and stimulates hydrolysis, resulting in the rapid trapping of peptides, which are then only slowly released upon nucleotide exchange (36Misselwitz B. Staeck O. Rapoport T.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 593-603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar,42Gething M.-J. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 465-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Although BiP has a marked effect on antibody refolding, the overall folding rate remains very slow, as observed in previous studies (20Lilie H. McLaughlin S. Freedman R. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14290-14296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is known that the oxidation of the cysteines and reshuffling of disulfide bonds take place during the whole time course of renaturation (20Lilie H. McLaughlin S. Freedman R. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14290-14296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, disulfide bond formation or a folding/association step which is required for correct disulfide bond formation seems to be the limiting step in antibody folding. It has been shown previously that formation of the intrachain disulfide bond of antibody domains is a slow process because the cysteine residues are buried in the core of the protein (43Goto Y. Hamaguchi K. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 146: 321-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Therefore, their accessibility is largely restricted for thiol reagents and even more for a large enzyme like PDI. Although we do not have direct experimental evidence, it is tempting to speculate that the inability of BiP and PDI to influence reactivation when added at later stages of folding may be due to a preceding structural collapse. These results suggest that different classes of folding helper proteins including components of the protein translocation work together synergistically in a network-like manner in the ER of eukaryotic cells.

In this paper, we investigated the mechanisms by which Grb7 and its association with FAK regulate cell migration. We found that deletion of the Grb7 SH2 domain eliminated partial Grb7 localization to focal contacts and its ability to stimulate cell migration. Replacement of the SH2 domain with the focal adhesion targeting sequence from FAK resulted in the focal contacts localization of the chimeric molecule and restored its activity to stimulate cell migration. We also found that Grb7 could be phosphorylated by FAK, which was dependent on the FAK kinase activity but not the presence of the Src family kinases. Cell adhesion also enhanced Grb7 phosphorylation in FAK+/+ cells but not FAK−/− cells, suggesting that Grb7 is a physiological substrate of FAK. Furthermore, both Grb7 and the chimeric molecule did not increase migration of FAK−/− cells, although the chimeric molecule was targeted to the focal contacts. Last, we showed that other Grb7 family members could not stimulate cell migration under similar experimental conditions.

The family members share a highly conserved molecular architecture: an NH2-terminal region containing proline-rich motifs, a central region with homology to theCaenorhabditis elegans protein Mig-10 and also containing a PH domain, and a COOH-terminal SH2 domain. Grb7 family proteins have been shown to interact with a variety of other cellular proteins including tyrosine kinase receptors and protooncogenes (26Stein D. Wu J. Fuqua S.A.W. Roonprapunt C.

Interestingly, differential expression of Grb7 has been reported in some human cancers and tumor cell lines, suggesting a possible function in tumorigenesis (34Tanaka S. Mori M. Akiyoshi T. Tanaka Y. Mafune K. Wands J.R. Sugimachi K. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 28-31PubMed Google Scholar, 35Tanaka S. Mori M. Akiyoshi T. Tanaka Y. Mafune K. Wands J.R. Sugimachi K. J. Clin.

The central domain of Grb7 family proteins is also called the GM (Grb and Mig) domain, which contains a region of >300 amino acids showing high sequence homology (approximately 50% amino acid identity) to a C. elegans gene product, Mig-10 (23Ooi J. Yajnik V. Immanuel D. Gordon M. Moskow J.J. Buchberg A.M. Margolis B. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1621-1630PubMed Google Scholar, 26Stein D. Wu J. Fuqua S.A.W. Roonprapunt C. Yajnik V. D'Eustachio P.

The Mig-10 protein has been shown to play a role in long range migration of neuronal cells during embryonic development (37Manser J. Wood W.B. Dev. Genet. 1990; 11: 49-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This suggested a possible role for Grb7 in the regulation of migration of mammalian cells. Indeed, we have recently found that Grb7 could interact with FAK through its Tyr-397 in an adhesion-dependent manner and that overexpression of Grb7 stimulated cell migration (12Han D.C. Guan J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24425-24430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). In this report, we investigated the mechanisms by which Grb7 and its interaction with FAK regulate cell migration. We found that the SH2 domain of Grb7 plays a role in cell migration by mediating Grb7 localization to focal contacts through its interaction with FAK. We also identified Grb7 as a direct FAK substrate, and tyrosine phosphorylation of Grb7 by FAK is critical for its ability to increase cell migration. Last, we found that unlike Grb7 itself, several other Grb7 family members could not stimulate cell migration under similar experimental conditions, suggesting a possibly unique role for Grb7 in regulation of mammalian cell migration. Protein A-Sepharose 4B, glutathione-agarose beads, human plasma fibronectin, and the mouse monoclonal α-vinculin were purchased from Sigma. LipofectAMINE was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. The mouse α-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody PY-20 was purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). The rabbit polyclonal α-Grb7, α-Grb10, α-Grb14, and α-HA antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The pEGFP-C3 plasmid encoding the green fluorescence protein (GFP) was as described (CLONTECH). Expression vectors encoding HA epitope-tagged Grb7 (pKH3-Grb7) and its SH2 domain (pKH3-Grb7.SH2) were described previously (12Han D.C. Guan J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24425-24430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The Grb7 segment containing the Pro-GM domain was generated by polymerase chain reaction amplification using the forward (5′-GGAATTCATATGGAGCTGGATCTGTCTCCAC-3′) and reverse (5′-GGAATTCACGTCGACAGTTGGGTGCGGTGGA-3′) primers. The polymerase chain reaction product was digested with EcoRI and cloned into pKH3 at the corresponding site to generate pKH3-Pro-GM. Similarly, the GM segment of Grb7 was polymerase chain reaction amplified using the sense (5′-CGGAATTCATAAGGTGTACAGTGAGGATGGG-3′) and antisense (5′-GGAATTCACGTCGACAGTTGGGTGCGGTGGA-3′) oligonucleotides and inserted into pKH3 to generate pKH3-GM. The sequence containing the GM-SH2 segment was polymerase chain reaction-amplified using the sense (5′-CGGAATTCATAAGGTGTACAGTGAGGATGGG-3′) and antisense (5′-CGAATTCGGGCTGAGGCATGAGCCAG-3′) primers and inserted into pKH3 to generate pKH3-GM-SH2. The DNA segment encoding focal adhesion-targeting (FAT) sequences was excised from pBS-FAK with NruI andEcoRV digestion. This fragment was inserted into pEGFP-C3 at the SmaI site to generate pEGFP-FAT. The FAT segment was then cut out from pEGFP-FAT by SalI and EcoRI digestion. It was then inserted into pKH3-Pro-GM or pKH3-GM at the corresponding sites to generate pKH3-Pro-GM-FAT or pKH3-GM-FAT, respectively. Expression vectors encoding human Grb10α and Grb10γ (32Liu F.

CHO cells were maintained in F-12 medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum. SYF and control fibroblast cells (39Klinghoffer R.A. Sachsenmaier C. Cooper J.A. Soriano P.

Ilic and were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Transient transfections of CHO, SYF, FAK−/−, and control fibroblasts were performed using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's guidelines. Cells were transfected with a combination of pEGFP-C3 and expression vectors in a 1:5 ratio (3 μg of total DNA). Two days after transfection, the cells were trypsinized and washed in serum-free medium. Approximately 1 × 105 cells were then replated on a 60-mm tissue culture dish that had been coated with 5 μg/ml human plasma fibronectin in PBS. After a 2-h incubation at 37 °C and 5% CO2, the medium was replaced with a CO2-independent medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 0.1% fetal bovine serum, and the cells were transferred into a humidified 37 °C chamber at atmospheric CO2. A fluorescent image was captured to detect GFP+ (i.e. positively transfected) cells. Time lapse phase-contrast images were then captured at 15-min intervals using the Image-Pro Plus software program version 3.0 and its specific cell motility macro called OMAware (Image Acquisition and Object Motility Analysis) version 1.1 for Windows NT version 4.0. These phase-contrast images were converted to black and white images using OMAware and saved as JPEG images. The OMAware program was then used to determine the velocity, distance traveled, and migration path for each cell based on its centroid as determined from the cell boundaries in the JPEG images. The mean velocity of the control (GFP−) cells was determined and the velocity of each transfected cell (GFP+) was calculated relative to this value. Data were collected using approximately 30 positively transfected cells in three independent assays for each expression vector. For most experiments, subconfluent cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and then lysed with 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 137 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mg/ml aprotinin, and 20 mg/ml leupeptin). For some experiments, cell lysates were prepared from suspended cells, or cells that had been replated on fibronectin using ice-cold modified radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mmTris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 5 mm EDTA, 30 mmNa2HPO4, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mg/ml aprotinin, and 20 mg/ml leupeptin), as described previously (40Guan J.L. Trevithick L.E. Hynes R.O. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 951-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 41Guan J.-L. Shalloway D. Nature. 1992; 358: 690-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation, and total protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay. Immunoprecipitations were carried out by incubating cell lysates with appropriate antibodies for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by incubation for 1.5 h with protein A-Sepharose. After washing, immune complexes were resolved using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Western blotting was carried out using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG as a secondary antibody and the Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ECL system for detection. Cells were processed for immunofluorescence staining as described with minor modification (40Guan J.L. Trevithick L.E. Hynes R.O. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 951-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Cells were plated on 18-mm coverslips that had been coated with 10 μg/ml human plasma fibronectin. They were incubated in a 37 °C incubator to allow for cell attachment and spreading. Cells were then fixed with 3% formaldehyde for 15 min, washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100, and washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline. They were stained with primary antibodies (α-HA (1:300), α-vinculin (1:50)) in the presence of 10% goat serum for 1 h at room temperature. After washing three times with phosphate-buffered saline, the bound primary antibodies were detected with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit (1:300) and rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse (1:150) antibodies, respectively. Image of stained cells was captured using an immunofluorescence microscope and a CCD camera. To investigate the mechanisms of stimulation of mammalian cell migration by Grb7, we constructed expression vectors encoding various fragments of Grb7 (Fig. 1 A). CHO cells were transiently transfected with these vectors. The expression of transfected Grb7 or its fragments were verified by Western blotting using anti-HA, which recognized the triple HA epitope tag fused to the N terminus of Grb7 or its fragments (Fig. 1 B). The effects of various Grb7 fragments on cell motility on fibronectin were then determined by using a time lapse imaging-based computerized motility analysis method (OMAware or Image Acquisition and Object Motility Analysis) as described under “Materials and Methods.” Fig.1 C shows that, consistent with our previous results (12Han D.C. Guan J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24425-24430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), Grb7 stimulated CHO cell migration on fibronectin, whereas transfection of control pKH3 vector did not affect cell motility when compared with untransfected cells. Interestingly, expression of the Grb7 fragment containing the GM and SH2 domains also stimulated cell migration, suggesting that the Pro-rich segment at the N terminus was not necessary for Grb7 function in cell migration. However, expression of neither the GM domain nor the SH2 domain alone increased CHO cell migration. Indeed, the expression of the SH2 domain alone inhibited cell migration, as observed previously in NIH3T3 cells (12Han D.C. Guan J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24425-24430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Expression of the fragment containing both the Pro-rich segment and GM domain also showed some inhibitory effect. These results suggested that the GM and SH2 domains of Grb7 function together to promote cell migration. Our previous studies have suggested a role for Grb7 binding to FAK via its SH2 domain in stimulation of cell migration (12Han D.C. Guan J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24425-24430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Other studies have indicated the critical importance of focal contact localization of FAK in its cellular functions, including regulation of cell migration (19Gilmore A.P. Romer L.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1209-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 42Richardson A. Parson J.T. Nature. 1996; 380: 538-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 43Zhao J.-H Reiske H. Gian J.-L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1997-2008Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Therefore, the Grb7 SH2 domain may be important for the function of Grb7 in cell migration by mediating Grb7 targeting to focal contacts through its association with FAK. To explore this possibility, we first analyzed the subcellular localization of Grb7 and its Pro-GM fragment lacking the SH2 domain. CHO cells were transfected with expression vectors encoding HA-tagged Grb7 or Pro-GM and were plated on fibronectin-coated coverslips. Immunofluorescence staining with anti-HA showed that Grb7 was localized in the cytoplasm as well as discrete regions of the plasma membrane resembling focal contacts (Fig.2 A, arrows). Staining of the same cells with anti-vinculin indicated its co-distribution with Grb7 in the focal contacts on the cell periphery (Fig. 2 B, arrows). In contrast, the Pro-GM fragment was detected only in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2, C andD). These results were consistent with our hypothesis that the Grb7 SH2 domain may be important for Grb7 function by mediating its binding to FAK and partial localization to focal contacts. To further investigate the above possibility, we generated a chimeric molecule (Pro-GM-FAT) that replaced the Grb7 SH2 domain with the FAT sequence from FAK (Fig.3 A). Double immunofluorescence staining for the chimeric molecule and vinculin confirmed their extensive co-localization in the cell peripheral and focal contacts, as expected (Fig. 2, E and F, arrows). The expression of transfected chimera molecules were also confirmed by Western blotting using anti-HA (Fig. 3 B). We then tested the effect of the chimeric molecule on cell motility in CHO cells. While either Pro-GM fragment (Fig. 1 C) or FAT alone (Fig.3 C) inhibited cell migration, expression of the chimeric protein composed of both segments increased cell migration significantly (Fig. 3 C). Similarly, another chimeric protein with the Grb7 GM domain fused to FAT also promoted cell migration, whereas the GM domain alone did not affect cell migration (Figs.1 B and 3 C). Taken together, these results suggested that the Grb7 SH2 domain was responsible for Grb7 localization in focal contacts through its binding to FAK, which may play an important role in stimulation of cell migration. To further explore the role of Grb7 interaction with FAK in the regulation of cell migration, we examined the possibility of tyrosine phosphorylation of Grb7 by FAK. CHO cells were co-transfected with pKH3-Grb7 encoding HA-tagged Grb7 and expression vectors encoding wild type, kinase-defective, or Tyr-397 to Phe mutant (Y397F) FAK. The cells were then lysed and immunoprecipitated with anti-Grb7 antibody followed by Western blotting with PY-20. As shown in Fig.4 A, Grb7 co-transfection with wild type FAK, but not the kinase-defective FAK (kd), resulted in a high level of tyrosine phosphorylation of Grb7. These results suggested that Grb7 might be a substrate for FAK. Interestingly, the Y397F mutant induced Grb7 phosphorylation to a lower level than the wild type FAK, suggesting that Grb7 association with FAK via Y397 (12Han D.C. Guan J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24425-24430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) may be required for efficient phosphorylation of Grb7 by FAK. Two other FAK associated proteins, paxillin and p130 cas, have been shown to be phosphorylated primarily by Src family kinases in the FAK-Src complex in a Tyr-397-dependent manner (17Vuori K. Hirai H. Aizawa S. Ruoslahti E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2606-2613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44Schaller M.D. Hildebrand J.D. Parson J.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3489-3505Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Therefore, an alternative explanation for a reduced phosphorylation by Tyr-397 mutant is that Grb7 is phosphorylated by Src family kinases rather than by (or in addition to) FAK. To assess this possibility directly, Grb7 was co-transfected with FAK into SYF cells lacking Src, Fyn, and Yes or control wild type cells (39Klinghoffer R.A. Sachsenmaier C. Cooper J.A. Soriano P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2459-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). Two days after transfection, cell lysates were prepared and immunoprecipitated with anti-Grb7 followed by Western blotting with PY-20. Fig. 4 Bshows that FAK induced Grb7 phosphorylation in both control and SYF cells (compare mock and FAK lanes), suggesting that Src family kinases were not involved in Grb7 phosphorylation by FAK. Furthermore, increased Grb7 phosphorylation was observed in the SYF cells compared with the control cells either with or without co-transfection of FAK (compare +/+ and −/− lanes). These results suggested that Grb7 is a direct substrate of FAK, whose phosphorylation is not dependent on the Src family kinases associated with FAK. To investigate potential function of Grb7 phosphorylation by FAK in cell migration, we first examined regulation of tyrosine phosphorylation of Grb7 by cell adhesion in FAK−/− and control FAK+/+ fibroblasts. Lysates were prepared from suspended cells or cells replated on fibronectins for 40 min. They were immunoprecipitated by anti-Grb7 and followed by Western blotting with PY-20 (Fig. 5). Consistent with our hypothesis that Grb7 is a direct substrate of FAK, no detectable tyrosine phosphorylation of Grb7 was observed in FAK−/− cells under either suspended or attached conditions. In control FAK+/+ fibroblasts, Grb7 exhibited an increased tyrosine phosphorylation upon cell adhesion to fibronectin. A similar increase in Grb7 phosphorylation was also observed in CHO cells used in most of our cell migration analysis. These results suggested that phosphorylation of Grb7 by FAK may play a role in cell migration. We also examined the subcellular localization of Grb7 and the chimeric molecule Pro-GM-FAT in FAK−/− cells. Cells were transfected with expression vectors encoding HA-tagged Grb7 or the chimeric molecule and were then plated on fibronectin-coated coverslips. Immunofluorescence staining with anti-HA showed Grb7 distribution in both the cytoplasm and membrane edges (Fig. 6 A). Co-staining with α-vinculin marked focal contacts. Inspection of both images as well as the merged image (data not shown) indicated a lack of co-localization of Grb7 with vinculin (Fig. 6, A andB), which is consistent with the idea that FAK is required for Grb7 (at least partial) localization in focal contacts. In contrast, HA-tagged Pro-GM-FAT chimeric protein showed extensive co-localization with vinculin in focal contacts in FAK−/− cells (Fig.6, C and D), indicating that the FAT sequence is sufficient for targeting molecules to focal contacts in the absence of endogenous FAK. Consistent with data in CHO cells (see Fig. 2,A and B), we also detected Grb7 co-localization with vinculin in focal contacts as well as the cytoplasm in FAK+/+ fibroblasts (Fig. 6, E and F), further supporting a role for FAK in Grb7 localization to focal contacts. To evaluate directly the role of Grb7 phosphorylation by FAK in cell migration, we examined the effects of Grb7 and the chimeric molecule Pro-GM-FAT on cell migration in FAK−/− cells. As reported previously (45Sieg D.J. Hauck C.R. Schlaepfer D.D. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2677-2691Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), transfection of FAK into these cells increased their migration on fibronectin (Fig. 7). Interestingly, expression of Grb7 did not stimulate cell migration but rather inhibited it. Furthermore, expression of the Pro-GM-FAT chimeric protein did not stimulate migration of the FAK−/− cells. Together with data in Fig. 3, these results demonstrated that Grb7 stimulation of cell migration is dependent on FAK expression. A lack of Grb7 phosphorylation in FAK−/− cells (see Fig. 5) is consistent with a role for Grb7 phosphorylation by FAK in cell migration. The inability of Pro-GM-FAT to stimulate cell migration despite its focal contact localization reinforced the potential critical importance of Grb7 phosphorylation by FAK in the regulation of cell migration. Several other Grb7 family members including Grb10α, Grb10γ, and Grb14 have been described, although their cellular functions are not totally understood at present (22Margolis B. Silvennoinen O.

Chem. 1997; 272: 2659-2667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). We investigated the possible role of these Grb7 family members in the regulation of cell migration using a similar assay. CHO cells were transiently transfected with expression vectors encoding Grb10α, Grb10γ, or Grb14 as well as Grb7 as a positive control. The expression of transfected Grb7, Grb10γ, and Grb14 were verified by Western blotting using appropriate antibodies (Fig.8 A). As expected, expression of Grb7 increased cell migration compared with cells transfected with vector alone (Fig. 8 B). However, we could not detect any stimulation of cell motility by Grb10α, Grb10γ, or Grb14 in these cells. They showed a slight inhibition of cell migration compared with untransfected or vector alone-transfected cells. Together, these results suggested that Grb7 may perform unique functions in mammalian cell migration among the related family members. Members of the Grb7 family adaptor proteins have been shown to bind a variety of other cellular signaling molecules. However, the functional significance of these interactions is largely unknown in the context of appropriate cellular processes. Recently, we have found that Grb7 interacted with FAK in an adhesion-dependent manner and that overexpression of Grb7 stimulated cell migration (12Han D.C. Guan J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24425-24430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). In this paper, we investigated the mechanisms of cell migration regulation by Grb7 interactions with FAK. We found that association of Grb7 with FAK via its SH2 domain was required for its localization to focal contacts and its ability to stimulate cell migration. We also identified Grb7 as a direct substrate of FAK and showed that Grb7 phosphorylation by FAK was necessary for stimulation of cell migration by Grb7. Formation of multiprotein complexes in the focal contacts has been proposed to be responsible for mediating integrin signaling pathways in regulation of various cellular functions (46Miyamoto S. Teremoto H. Coso O.A. Gutkind J.S. Burbelo P.D. Akiyama S.K. Yamamoto K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 791-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that displacement of FAK from the focal contacts by its C-terminal FRNK segment inhibited integrin-FAK signaling pathways in the regulation of cell spreading, migration, and cell cycle progression (19Gilmore A.P. Romer L.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1209-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 42Richardson A. Parson J.T. Nature. 1996; 380: 538-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 43Zhao J.-H Reiske H. Gian J.-L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1997-2008Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Interestingly, expression of a mislocalized FAK mutant competed with the endogenous FAK in focal contacts for binding other signaling molecules, which also functioned in a dominant negative manner to inhibit integrin-FAK signaling pathways in cell cycle regulation (43Zhao J.-H Reiske H. Gian J.-L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1997-2008Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Thus, recruitment of signaling molecules to focal contacts by FAK may play an important role in triggering downstream pathways. The SH2 domain of Grb7 has been shown to mediate its binding to FAK (12Han D.C. Guan J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24425-24430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). A small fraction of wild type Grb7 was detected in the focal contacts, and deletion of the SH2 domain abolished this focal contact localization (Fig. 2). Deletion of the SH2 domain also abolished Grb7's ability to stimulate cell migration (Fig. 1). Furthermore, replacement of the SH2 domain by the FAT sequence targeted the chimeric molecule directly to focal contacts and also maintained its ability to stimulate cell migration (Figs. 2 and 3). Together, these data strongly suggested that recruitment of Grb7 to the focal contacts by FAK plays a critical role in triggering downstream pathways leading to cell migration. Furthermore, the observation that only a small fraction of Grb7 is co-localized with FAK suggests that Grb7 interaction with FAK may be dynamic and regulated. This is consistent with the findings that the same Tyr-397 site of FAK also interacts with other signaling including Src family kinases (6Xing Z. Chen H.-C. Nowlen J.K. Taylor S. Shalloway D.

A. 1994; 91: 10148-10152Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar), and phospholipase Cγ (11Zhang X. Chattopadhyay A. Ji Q.-S. Owen J.D. Ruest P.J. Carpenter G. Hanks S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9021-9026Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). We also noted that while it did not promote cell migration, the Pro-GM segment of Grb7 actually inhibited it (Fig. 1). Without it being recruited to focal contacts by FAK, this fragment could interfere with either FAK-dependent or -independent signaling pathways in cell migration. Likewise, the full-length Grb7 also inhibited cell migration when it was not localized to focal contacts in FAK−/− cells (Fig. 7), which suggested an inhibition of the FAK-independent pathway. The mechanism by which Grb7 or its fragment affected such FAK-independent pathways in cell migration is unknown, although the Pro-rich sequences may be involved, since the GM domain only did not exhibit such activity in CHO cells (Fig. 1). Previous studies have shown that activation of FAK-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of several other proteins including p130 cas and paxillin (15Turner C.E. Miller J. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1583-1591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2635-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 17Vuori K. Hirai H.

Biol. 1997; 17: 1702-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). However, tyrosine phosphorylation of p130 cas is primarily by Src family kinases in the FAK-Src complexes, and FAK served as a linker to bring p130 cas and Src together (17Vuori K. Hirai H. Aizawa S. Ruoslahti E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2606-2613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, paxillin could be tyrosine-phosphorylated when Src was co-expressed with catalytically defective FAK, suggesting that Src kinase is responsible for phosphorylation and FAK functioned to bring Src and paxillin together (44Schaller M.D. Hildebrand J.D. Parson J.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3489-3505Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In contrast, several lines of evidence suggested that Grb7 is a direct substrate of FAK. First, tyrosine phosphorylation of Grb7 was induced by wild type FAK, but not by the kinase-defective FAK mutant (Fig. 4 A). Second, the absence of Src family kinases in the SYF cells did not prevent FAK-mediated Grb7 phosphorylation but rather enhanced it (Fig. 4 B). Third, tyrosine phosphorylation of Grb7 was also increased by cell adhesion to fibronectin, which was known to induce FAK activation (Fig.5). Finally, no Grb7 phosphorylation could be detected in FAK−/− cells even after cell adhesion (Fig. 5), which had been shown to activate the Src kinases in these cells (47Sieg D.J. Ilic D. Jones K.C. Damsky C.H. Hunter T. Schlaepfer D.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5933-5947Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to determine the sites phosphorylated on Grb7 by FAK, which may suggest other potential direct FAK substrates. It is interesting to note that Grb7 exhibited increased tyrosine phosphorylation by FAK in SYF cells compared with the control fibroblasts (Fig. 4 B). It is possible that Src family kinases binding to FAK at Tyr-397 could compete with Grb7 binding to FAK at the same site in normal cells. Therefore, the absence of Src family kinases in SYF cells would allow an increased Grb7 binding (or at least access) to FAK, leading to the very strong tyrosine phosphorylation of Grb7. Alternatively, Grb7 may bind to other intracellular signaling molecules in an Src-dependent manner in normal cells. The absence of Src family kinases in SYF cells could release the associated Grb7, allowing its increased interaction with and phosphorylation by FAK. Future studies will be necessary to determine these interesting possibilities. Our results showed that the Y397F FAK mutant was not as effective as wild type FAK in inducing Grb7 phosphorylation, suggesting that Grb7 association with FAK may facilitate its phosphorylation by FAK. However, the Y397F mutant clearly phosphorylated Grb7 (Fig. 4), indicating that association is not absolutely required. It is possible that co-localization of Grb7 with FAK at focal contacts (even without direct association) may increase the efficiency of Grb7 phosphorylation by FAK. Thus, Grb7 could be recruited into focal contacts by endogenous FAK and phosphorylated by both endogenous FAK and the overexpressed exogenous Y397F FAK mutant. These data suggested that Grb7 association with FAK as well as its focal contact recruitment by FAK may be important factors for Grb7 phosphorylation by FAK, although the precise mechanism of Grb7 phosphorylation by FAK will await further investigation. The functional significance of Grb7 phosphorylation by FAK is not well understood at present. A lack of tyrosine phosphorylation of Grb7 in FAK−/− cells correlated with its inability to stimulate cell migration in these cells. Furthermore, expression of the Pro-GM-FAT chimeric molecule failed to stimulate migration of FAK−/− cells, while it readily increased migration of FAK+/+ CHO cells. Subcellular localization studies indicated that the chimeric molecule was targeted to focal contacts in both cell types. Therefore, tyrosine phosphorylation of Grb7 may be necessary for its stimulation of cell migration. Alternatively, stimulation of cell migration by Grb7 may be dependent on other signaling pathways downstream of FAK (e.g. FAK/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase association (48Reiske H.R. Kao S.-C. Cary L.A. Guan J.-L. Lai J.-F. Chen H.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12361-12366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar)), which are defective in the FAK−/− cells. This is consistent with the idea that FAK could trigger multiple downstream signaling pathways, which regulate cell migration in a coordinated manner. It remains a future challenge to delineate the spatial and temporal regulations of FAK complexes with other signaling molecules in triggering multiple pathways in cell migration.

The two enhancers are 95% identical in sequence, and they are likely to have arisen as a consequence of the gene duplication event that yielded the apoC-I gene and the apoC-I′ pseudogene. Both enhancer sequences appear to have equivalent activity in directing apoE gene expression in peritoneal macrophages and in adipocytes, suggesting that their activity in specific cell types may be determined by common regulatory elements.

Science. 1988; 240: 622-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (3336) Google Scholar). It is a component of large remnant lipoproteins and large high density lipoproteins in plasma. ApoE has a key role in the metabolism of plasma lipoproteins by serving as a ligand for the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor family and binding to heparan sulfate proteoglycans. These functions of apoE mediate the clearance of remnant lipoproteins and apoE-rich large high density lipoproteins from plasma, resulting in the redistribution of cholesterol and triglycerides between peripheral tissues and the liver.

Lipidol. 1999; 10: 207-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). The E2 variant is defective in binding to receptors, and homozygosity for apoE2 is sometimes associated with type III hyperlipidemia and premature atherosclerosis (8Mahley R.W. Rall Jr., S.C.

The E4 variant increases the formation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles that are characteristic of Alzheimer's disease, making apoE4 a significant risk factor for this neurodegenerative disorder (9Roses A.D.

Macrophages have long been recognized as a source of apoE (12Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Ho Y.K. Havel R.J. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 7545-7549Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). ApoE is a marker for the developmental state of macrophages; the culture of mouse bone marrow cells in vitro shows that mature macrophages, but not their monocytic precursors, synthesize apoE (13Werb Z. Chin J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 1113-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages synthesize and secrete apoE.

Resident macrophages in a variety of tissues, including liver Kupffer cells (15Dawson P.A. Lukaszewski L.M. Ells P.F. Malbon C.C. Williams D.L. J.

Dexamethasone, a synthetic glucocorticoid, increases apoE mRNA levels in mature macrophages up to 6-fold over basal levels (18Zuckerman S.H. Evans G.F. O'Neal L. Atherosclerosis. 1993; 103: 43-54Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The uptake of acetylated LDL or cholesterol ester-rich β-migrating very low density lipoproteins into peritoneal macrophages stimulates apoE synthesis and secretion by 3–8-fold (12Basu S.K.

The response of macrophages to cholesterol is due to increased apoE gene transcription and higher apoE mRNA levels (19Mazzone T. Basheeruddin K. Poulos C. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 1055-1064Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lipid-loaded, macrophage-derived foam cells in aortic atherosclerotic lesions of cholesterol-fed rabbits synthesize and secrete apoE and appear to be the major source of apoE in the atherosclerotic arterial wall (20Rosenfeld M.E.

ApoE synthesis has been reported in both human and mouse adipose tissue (25Zechner R. Moser R. Newman T.C. Fried S.K. Breslow J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10583-10588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ApoE mRNA has also been detected in confluent cultured mouse fibroblasts that have been induced to become adipocytes by dexamethasone and insulin. Undifferentiated fibroblasts do not contain apoE mRNA (25Zechner R. Moser R. Newman T.C. Fried S.K. Breslow J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10583-10588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The level of apoE mRNA in differentiated adipocytes is increased further by raising the content of intracellular free cholesterol (25Zechner R. Moser R. Newman T.C. Fried S.K. Breslow J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10583-10588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a process that can be stimulated in adipocytes by the induction of LDL receptor-related protein by insulin (26Descamps O. Bilheimer D. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 974-981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the regulation of apoE production in both adipocytes and macrophages has intriguing similarities; the gene is not expressed in cellular precursors but is induced upon differentiation into mature cells and is further induced in each cell type by intracellular cholesterol and by a synthetic glucocorticoid. Consequently, it is likely these processes are controlled by common regulatory elements that are active in both cell types. The human apoE gene is located on chromosome 19 at the 5′ end of a 44-kilobase (kb) gene cluster that includes the apoC-I, apoC-IV, and apoC-II genes and the apoC-I′ pseudogene (27Allan C.M.

Mahley R.W. Taylor J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Bry W.I. Boyles J.K. Wardell M.R. Young S.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 270-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Cell-specific distal enhancers control the expression of the apoE gene cluster in all tissues (31Taylor J.M. Simonet W.S. Bucay N. Lauer S.J. de Silva H.V. Curr. Opin.

The promoters lack the ability to direct gene transcription in vivo in any cell in the absence of the distal enhancers (33Simonet W.S. Bucay N. Pitas R.E. Lauer S.J. Taylor J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8651-8654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The locations of two enhancers, hepatic control regions (HCR) 1 and 2, have been reported; HCR.1 is found 15 kb 3′ of the apoE gene, and HCR.2 is located 11 kb farther downstream (34Simonet W.S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 29113-29119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The two hepatocyte-specific enhancers have an 87% sequence identity, and they apparently arose as a result of the recent evolutionary gene duplication that yielded the apoC-I and apoC-I′ genes (28Allan C.M. Walker D. Taylor J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26278-26281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We report here on the localization of two macrophage/adipocyte enhancers that are nearly identical in sequence, constituting the second example of the regulatory impact of gene duplication on the control of gene expression in the apoE gene cluster. The constructs employed for these studies are illustrated in Fig. 1, A and B. The preparations of the 70-kb 198.KK cloned genomic fragment and the 10-kb HEG1, HESS1, LE1, LE2, and LE6 subfragments have been described (27Allan C.M. Walker D. Segrest J.P. Taylor J.M.

The CLE1 clone (36Reardon C.A. Lau Y.-F. Paik Y.-K. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Taylor J.M. J. Biol.

The 3′ terminus of the genomic insert was determined by nucleotide sequencing. The LE7, LE8, and LE9 DNA subfragments containing 672-, 597-, and 603-bp sequences, respectively, were generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from the LE1 DNA subfragment. Oligonucleotide sequences for PCR were as follows: 1) LE7 5′ end primer, 5′CCCAAGCTTCAACATGCGTTAGGAGGGACAT3′; 2) LE7 3′ end primer, 5′GGACTAGTCCCTATCAGATGGGCGTCTTTA3′; 3) LE8 5′ end primer, 5′CCCAAGCTTCACTGAGCCCTACTGGATGTTC3′; 4) LE8 3′ end primer, 5′GGACTAGTCCTTCAGCTGCAAAGCTCTGAG3′; 5) LE9 5′ end primer, 5′CCCAAGCTTAGTGTCCAGCTAAGGCGAC3′; 6) LE9 3′ end primer, 5′GGACTAGTGCCCGCAGGACCTTTATCAG3′. The resulting PCR products were digested with HindIII and SpeI and ligated to purified HEG1 to make transgene constructs (HEG.LE1 in Fig.1 A). Construct DNA was purified by standard methods (35Allan C.M. Taylor S. Taylor J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29113-29119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). All transgenic animals for these studies were generated in the inbred FVB/N mouse strain with constructs of the human apoE gene cluster (Fig.1, A and B) as described previously (27Allan C.M. Walker D. Segrest J.P. Taylor J.M. Genomics. 1995; 28: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Construct DNA was microinjected into zygotes at a concentration of 2 ng/μl in 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.2 mm EDTA. Transgenic founders and hemizygous offspring were identified by PCR analysis of tail tip DNA, and genomic DNA was analyzed further to confirm the presence of the LE7, LE8, and LE9 sequences in their respective transgenes. Two to four independent transgenic lines were analyzed for each construct, and cell or tissue samples from male and female mice were examined independently. Mouse peritoneal macrophages were collected 4 days after an intraperitoneal injection of 1.5 ml of sterile 4% thioglycollate broth (Difco). All subsequent procedures were carried out under sterile conditions. The cells were collected by intraperitoneal lavage with sterile Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The lavage fluid from three mice was pooled and centrifuged for 10 min at 800 × g. Pelleted cells were resuspended in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (DMEM) and then centrifuged again. After a second resuspension in DMEM, the cells were counted, and 3–10 × 106 cells were plated in 35-mm culture dishes. Nonadherent cells were removed after 3 h by two washes with DMEM, and the remaining macrophages were incubated overnight in DMEM supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum. Macrophage RNA was extracted by using Trizol Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) following the manufacturer's protocol. RNA hybridization probes for human apoE mRNA were transcribed as described (34Simonet W.S. Bucay N. Lauer S.J. Taylor J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8221-8229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by using bacteriophage T3 RNA polymerase in the presence of [α-32P]UTP (10 mCi/ml, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) from cDNA fragments that had been cloned in Bluescribe vectors (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). A mouse actin mRNA probe (m-actin 79) that was transcribed by using SP6 RNA polymerase was used to estimate the levels of RNA present in each sample. Human apoE and mouse actin protected 192 and 80 nucleotides, respectively, of their respective probes. RNase protection analysis was performed as described (37Gilman M. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 1.

Protected fragments were resolved by electrophoresis in 6% polyacrylamide gels containing 7 m urea and detected by autoradiography of the dried gels. Adipose tissues from retroperitoneal, inguinal, and reproductive sites from control and transgenic mice were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24–36 h and embedded in paraffin. Sections (7 μm) were cut with a rotary microtome, mounted on superfrost plus slides (Fisher), and stored at 4 °C until used. Before hybridization, slides were warmed to room temperature and baked at 55 °C for 30 min. Paraffin was removed from the slides by two successive 10-min immersions in xylene. Tissue sections were hydrated in a progression of 3-min washes in ethanol (100, 90, 70, 50, and 30%) and by three successive 5-min immersions in 1× PBS (137 mmNaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mmNa2HPO4·7H2O, 1.4 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.3). The sections were incubated with 20 μg/ml proteinase K (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl for 15 min at room temperature. Proteolytic activity was stopped by immersion for 10 min in 0.2% glycine in 1× PBS. Tissues were successively rinsed in 1× PBS for 5 min, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 1× PBS for 5 min, rinsed in 1× PBS for 5 min, and acetylated with 0.25% acetic anhydride in 0.1 mmtriethanolamine buffer at pH 8.0 for 10 min. After a final 5-min rinse in 1× PBS, tissue sections were dehydrated in a series of 3-min washes in ethanol (30, 50, 80, 95, and 100%). An RNA probe complementary to nucleotides 20–411 of human apoE mRNA was labeled with [α-33P]UTP to a specific activity of at least 2 × 104 Ci/mmol by using an RNA transcription kit (Stratagene). Labeled probes were purified through Micro Bio-Spin 30 chromatography columns (Bio-Rad). Tissue sections were incubated for 14–18 h in a humidified chamber at 42 °C with probes diluted to 2.0 × 106 cpm per slide in a buffer containing 50% formamide, 0.3 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 1× Denhardt's solution (0.2% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.02% Ficoll, 0.02% bovine serum albumin), 10% dextran sulfate, 250 μg/ml sperm DNA, and 0.1 mg/ml tRNA. The sections were washed twice at room temperature in 2× standard saline citrate solution (SSC), 1.0 mm EDTA for 10 min, and immersed in 20 μg/ml RNase A (Sigma) in 500 mmNaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 10 units/ml of T1 RNase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 1 h at 37 °C. Tissue sections were washed at 55 °C in six changes of 0.1× SSC with 1.0 mm EDTA for 4 h, rinsed twice for 10 min each in 0.5× SSC, dehydrated, and exposed at −20 °C to β-max film (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 4 days. Slides were dipped in NTB2 nuclear track emulsion (Eastman Kodak Co.), incubated at 4 °C for 5 days, and developed with D19 developer (Kodak). Sections were stained for 2 min with hematoxylin (Fisher), washed in Scott's Tap Water Substitute (Fisher) for 3 min, placed in 80% ethanol for 1 min, and then restained with eosin (Fisher) for 3 min. After dehydration in a graded series of ethanol (80, 95, and 100%), the sections were rinsed in xylene three times and overlaid with coverslips. Nucleotide sequences of intergenic regions in the human apoE gene cluster were determined by standard methods (27Allan C.M. Walker D. Segrest J.P. Taylor J.M. Genomics. 1995; 28: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). ApoE gene cluster sequences are also available in the GenBankTM data base (accession number AF050154). The nucleotide sequences were analyzed by Pustell DNA matrix and ClustalW alignment algorithms contained in the MacVector software suite (Oxford Molecular, Madison WI), and by sequence comparison algorithms in the Vector NTI (Informax, North Bethesda, MD) suite of programs. Additional analysis of nucleotide homologies was made by searching the GenBankTM and TRANSFAC (38Heinemeyer T. Chen X. Karas H. Kel A.E. Kel O.V. Liebich I. Meinhardt T. Reuter I. Schacherer F. Wingender E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 318-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) data bases. To determine the location of regulatory sequences that direct apoE gene expression in macrophages, peritoneal macrophages were isolated from transgenic mice that had been generated with the p198.KK, CLE1, and HEG1 genomic fragments (Fig.1 A). Total RNA was extracted and analyzed by RNase protection analysis. Macrophages from p198.KK transgenic mice contained human apoE mRNA, whereas cells from CLE1 and HEG1 did not react with the human antisense RNA probe (Fig.2). No RNA samples from any tissues of these mice hybridized to the apoE sense RNA probe (data not shown). These initial results suggested that no macrophage-specific regulatory activity was located in the proximal promoter or within 30 kb upstream of the apoE gene and that macrophage enhancer activity was located more than 1.7 kb downstream of the gene. Previous studies indicated that the HCR.1 domain had unique enhancer properties with a potential nuclear matrix attachment sequence and nucleosome organizing capability (39Dang Q. Taylor J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28667-28676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). 2Q. Dang and J. Taylor, unpublished observations. Therefore, we examined transgenic mice generated with constructs that covered this region of the apoE gene cluster to determine if macrophage expression activity might be located near HCR.1 (Fig. 1, A and B). Human apoE mRNA was detected in macrophage RNA from transgenic mice generated with HEG.LE1 and HEG.LE2 but not with HEG.LE6 (Fig. 2). To confirm the site of macrophage enhancer activity, additional constructs were generated that had the LE7, LE8, or LE9 portion of the LE1 domain. The HEG.LE8 construct expressed the apoE gene in macrophages, and only constructs that contained the LE8 sequence yielded human apoE mRNA in these cells (Fig. 2). A previous report (40Basheeruddin K. Rechtoris C. Mazzone T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1218: 235-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) indicated that activation of apoE gene expression in vitro during macrophage differentiation of cultured transformed THP-1 cells is associated with a regulatory element in the proximal promoter of the apoE gene that binds the transcription factor activator protein-1. This element was mapped to ∼600 nucleotides upstream of the transcription start site of the apoE gene, which places the regulatory element within a member of theAlu family of repeated sequences (41Paik Y.-K. Chang D.J. Reardon C.A. Davies G.E. Mahley R.W. Taylor J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3445-3449Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Although this regulatory element is present in the HEG1 genomic fragment, our results show that HEG1 is not expressed in macrophages in vivowithout the presence of the downstream multienhancer domain (Fig.2). The similarities in the control of apoE production reported for both macrophages and adipocytes suggested that the same regulatory domain might contain enhancer activity for apoE gene expression in both cell types. Therefore, adipose tissue was collected from adipose fat pads at three different sites from transgenic mice generated with various constructs (Fig. 1, A and B) and was examined byin situ hybridization. ApoE mRNA was detected in adipocytes from HEG.LE2 but not HEG.LE6 transgenic mice (Fig.3, A and B). No difference in apoE expression was observed in adipose tissue excised from any of the three sites examined (data not shown). Human apoE mRNA was also found in adipose tissue from p198.KK, HEG.LE1, and HEG.LE8 transgenic mice, but not in adipose tissue from CLE1, HEG.LE7, HEG.LE9, or HEG1 transgenic mice (data not shown). Thein situ hybridization results were verified by examining apoE mRNA in abdominal adipose tissue by RNase protection (Fig.4). These data confirmed that the LE8 portion, but not the LE7 or LE9 portion, of the LE1 domain directed transgene expression to adipose tissue. Thus, both adipose enhancer activity and macrophage enhancer activity co-localized to the same LE8 intergenic region.Figure 1Transgenic constructs of the human apoE gene cluster.

Total RNA isolated from tissues of transgenic mice was analyzed by RNase protection as in Fig. 2 with antisense probes for apoE mRNA (A–C) and actin (D–F). Only the HEG.LE8 construct is expressed at high levels in adipose tissue. The expression patterns of each construct in the three other tissues shown here serve as controls for this analysis. The HEG1 parent construct is normally expressed at high levels in the kidney, and this activity is retained in all three constructs as expected. A distinct enhancer domain (HCR.1) is located within the LE7 fragment and directs expression of the transgene at high levels in the liver, as previously reported (34Simonet W.S. Bucay N. Lauer S.J. Taylor J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8221-8229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Little if any expression of HEG1 is detected in testis (34Simonet W.S. Bucay N. Lauer S.J. Taylor J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8221-8229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a pattern consistent with the expression of the transgenes analyzed here.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The sequence of the LE8 region was compared with the nucleotide sequence of the human apoE gene cluster to determine if there were homologous sequences present elsewhere within this genomic domain. A 620-nucleotide region of homology was identified in the apoE/C-I intergenic region, located 3.3 kb downstream of the apoE gene. A comparison of the entire LE8 sequence and its upstream homologous sequence is shown in Fig. 5. The two regions are 95% identical in sequence, having a random distribution of nucleotide differences. A single nucleotide deletion located near the 5′ terminus of LE8 accounts for their difference in length. This sequence identity is greater than that of HCR.1 and HCR.2 (28Allan C.M. Walker D. Taylor J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26278-26281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), suggesting that enhancer function was likely to be preserved in both domains. Analysis of macrophage RNA from HESS1 (Fig. 1 A) transgenic mice supported the likelihood that the apoE/C-I intergenic element had full enhancer activity (Fig. 2). Similarly, adipose tissue from HESS1 transgenic mice was positive for apoE mRNA as determined by in situ hybridization (data not shown). We termed the upstream sequence multienhancer 1 (ME.1) and the downstream sequence multienhancer 2 (ME.2). Our identification of the multienhancer domains depended on the expression of human genomic fragments in transgenic mice. To minimize the possibility that our results might reflect potential position effects from neighboring sequences at the sites of transgene integration in the host mouse genome, we examined at least two independent founder lines for each construct. In addition, transgenic lines were generated with several different constructs containing the multienhancer domains (Fig. 1, A and B). The same pattern of expression was observed in each case, making it unlikely that artifactual position effects contributed to the cell specificity of transgene expression. To understand the regulatory activity of the ME.1 and ME.2 domains, we examined their nucleotide sequences for transcription factor binding motifs. Several high affinity binding motifs for the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and members of the CAAT element binding protein (C/EBP) transcription factor family were found throughout both multienhancer domains, as illustrated for ME.1 in Fig.6. Although the transcriptional activities of these motifs remain to be evaluated by direct functional tests, their presence in ME.1 and ME.2 is consistent with the roles of GR and C/EBP factors in macrophage and adipocyte function. For example, C/EBPα and C/EBPβ play obligatory roles in adipocyte differentiation, a process that is further modulated by glucocorticoids (42Wu Z. Bucher N.L.R. Farmer S.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4128-4136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43Wu Z. Rosen E.D. Brun R. Hauser S. Adelmant G. Troy A.E. McKeon C. Darlington G.J. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 151-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). In addition, C/EBPα is required for full activity of the promoters of several genes that are expressed in mature macrophages (44van Dijk T.B. Baltus B. Raaijmakers J.A.M. Lammers J.-W.J. Koenderman L. de Groot R.P. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 2674-2680PubMed Google Scholar, 45Iwama A. Zhang P. Darlington G.J. McKercher S.R. Maki R. Tenen D.G.

Biol. 1998; 18: 3915-3925Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, both C/EBPα and C/EBPβ appear to play critical roles in macrophage maturation (47Valledor A.F. Borràs F.E. Cullell-Young M. Celada A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1998; 63: 405-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The possibility that widely employed transcription factors like GR and C/EBP mediate ME.1 and ME.2 function suggests that interactions with specific cofactors are likely to be critical to achieving tissue-specific enhancer action. This mechanism has been suggested to account for the cell-specific activity of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) (48Juge-Aubry C. Pernin A. Favez T. Burger A.G. Wahli W. Meier C.A. Desvergne B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25252-25259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), another transcription family that is important for gene expression in macrophages, adipocytes, and other tissues (49Desvergne B. Wahli W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 649-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (2698) Google Scholar). Cofactor interactions and protein modifications, including phosphorylation, appear to be important in mediating PPAR binding to low affinity binding sites in regulatory domains of responsive genes (48Juge-Aubry C. Pernin A. Favez T. Burger A.G. Wahli W. Meier C.A. Desvergne B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25252-25259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Consequently, our finding of high affinity binding motifs for GR and C/EBP, and the apparent lack of high affinity binding sites for PPAR in ME.1 and ME.2 (Fig.7, legend), will require direct functional tests to evaluate their role in enhancer activity for the apoE gene. Clarification of these mechanisms is beyond the scope of this report, and we will test them in future studies. The finding of one copy of a duplicate enhancer element in the 5′-flanking region of the apoC-I′ gene (ME.2) and a second copy in the apoE/C-I intergenic region (ME.1) was unexpected. Our previous sequence analysis indicated that homology between the two apoC-I genes ended 259 nucleotides upstream of the apoC-I gene. However, Pustell DNA matrix analysis of the apoE gene cluster sequence compared with itself revealed an additional region of internal homology located 467 nucleotides further upstream of the apoC-I promoter. This upstream sequence was strikingly similar to sequences within the LE1 fragment where the apoC-I′ 5′-flanking region is located (Fig. 7). The 5′ region of sequence duplication extends 12 nucleotides into the adjacentAlu repeated sequence member, at which point nucleotide similarities diverge sharply (data not shown). Within the duplicated region, sequence identities are remarkably high, consistent with a conserved regulatory function for these regions. A comparison of the ec7 and cc13 Alu sequences (locations indicated in Fig. 7) reveals a 94% sequence identity (data not shown). This degree of sequence conservation is significantly greater than the 87% average identity found for ∼500 members of a majorAlu subfamily (50Kapitonov V. Jurka J. J. Mol. Evol. 1996; 42: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) and the 86% identity for Alusequences at large in the human genome (51Okada N. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1991; 1: 498-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The relatively high conservation of the ec7 and cc13 Alu sequences is consistent with the recent evolutionary duplication of the apoC-I genes (52Raisonnier A. J. Mol. Evol. 1991; 32: 211-219PubMed Google Scholar). Finding that the sequence identity between these particularAlu family members is comparable to that of the adjacent enhancer domains suggests that they may have a functional contribution to the apoE gene cluster, a possibility that remains to be determined. Our previous studies indicated that a 10-kb segment of the human apoE gene cluster had undergone a duplication event that resulted in the appearance of two copies of the apoC-I gene (27Allan C.M. Walker D. Segrest J.P. Taylor J.M. Genomics. 1995; 28: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We determined by nucleotide sequence analysis that the distal downstream end of the duplicated segment was located at the 3′ end of HCR.2 (28Allan C.M. Walker D. Taylor J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26278-26281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In the current study, both matrix analysis and direct sequence comparisons show that the upstream 5′ end of the duplicated genomic segment is at the 5′ end of the ME.1 domain and extending 12 nucleotides into the adjacent Alu sequence (Fig. 7). Thus, the upstream duplicated segment containing the functional apoC-I gene is 12 kb in length, and the downstream duplicated segment containing the inactive apoC-I′ pseudogene is 11 kb in length. The studies presented here show that the gene recombination events that resulted in the modern day human apoE gene cluster yielded duplicated enhancers, HCR.1 and HCR.2, for hepatocyte expression and duplicated enhancers, ME.1 and ME.2, for macrophage and adipocyte expression. The enhancer HCR.2 is located at the extreme 3′ end of the recombinant portion of the cluster, and ME.1 is located at the extreme 5′ end of the recombinant region (Fig. 1). Additional studies are underway to determine if distinct regulatory elements within ME.1 and ME.2 can be distinguished for the control of gene expression in macrophages and adipocytes.

Kinetic analyses showed that the new peak was a previously unknown intermediate state in the collagen helix-coil transition induced by UV light, and at least 80% of the total collagen was transformed to random chains via this state. Its rate of formation was increased by hydrogen peroxide and inhibited by free radical scavengers. SDS-polyacrylamide gels showed evidence of competing reactions of cross-linking and random primary chain scission. The cross-linking was evident from initial gelling of the collagen solution, but there was no evidence for a dityrosine cross-link. Primary chain scission was confirmed by end group analysis using fluorescamine. Electron microscopy showed that the segment long spacing crystallites formed from the intermediate state were identical to the native molecules. Clearly, collagen can undergo quite extensive damage by cleavage of peptide bonds without disorganizing the triple helical structure. This leads to the formation of a damaged intermediate state prior to degradation of the molecules to short random chains.

It has been reported that cross-linking and degradation (1Fujimori E. FEBS Lett. 1988; 235: 98-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) occur on exposure to UV, the relative proportions depending on the presence of oxygen, pH of solution, type of collagen, and wavelength of the UV.These effects have been attributed to absorption by the aromatic groups, phenylalanine and tyrosine, with the suggestion that cross-linking could be mediated through dityrosine cross-links (2Kato Y. Uchida K. Kawakishi S. Photochem. Photobiol. 1994; 59: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), although no detailed chemistry has been carried out to demonstrate the presence of this cross-link. For example, Kato et al. (3Kato Y. Takashi N. Shundro K. Photochem. Photobiol. 1995; 61: 367-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) reported loss of tyrosine and cross-linking in both type I and IV collagens but could not detect dityrosine, only DOPA.1 Kaminska and Sionkowska (4Kaminska A. Sionkowska A. Polymer Degradation Stability. 1996; 51: 19-26Crossref Scopus (131) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the infrared amide bands were shifted to a lower frequency, indicating that structural changes were taking place in the molecule. They also deduced that helix-random coil transitions were taking place by reduction in the viscosity (5Sionkowska A. Kaminska A. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1999; 24: 337-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Much earlier, Bailey (6Bailey A.J. Radiat. Res. 1967; 31: 206-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) had shown that ionizing-radiation (cobalt 60) reduced the denaturation temperature of collagen solutions in a biphasic manner, and Hayashi et al. (7Hayashi T. Curran-Patel S. Prockop D.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 4182-4187Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) reported a similar biphasic phenomenon when collagen was irradiated with UV light during CD measurements.The collagen family of proteins (currently 20) constitute 25% of the total protein mass of the body and determine architecture, tissue strength, and cell-collagen interactions. A characteristic feature of collagen is the triple helical structure of three left-handed polyproline type helices twisted into a right-handed superhelix. The formation of such a structure is due to the repeating sequence Gly-X-Y, where X and Y are often proline and hydroxyproline, respectively, and hydrogen bonding takes place between chains within the triple helix.On heating, the triple helix unfolds to produce random chains of gelatin (8Harrington W.F. von Hippel P.H. Adv. Protein Chem. 1969; 16: 1-138Google Scholar), and this transition has been studied by polarimetry (9Burjanadze T.V. Bezhitadze M.O. Biopolymers. 1992; 32: 951-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), spectrometry (10Danielsen C.C. Biochem. J. 1990; 272: 697-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), circular dichroism (7Hayashi T. Curran-Patel S. Prockop D.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 4182-4187Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and viscosity (11Rose C. Kumar M. Mandal A.B. Biochem. J. 1988; 249: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, we believe that the most powerful technique is differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), which provides direct measurements of thermodynamic characteristics and, unlike the other methods, is equally applicable to collagen solutions (12Privalov P.L. Tiktopulo E.I. Tischenko V.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 127: 203-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), fibers (13Tiktopulo E.I. Kajava A.V. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8147-8152Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and tissues (14Miles C.A. Ghelashvili M. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 3243-3252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Collagen monomers in solution unfold abruptly to yield a single, sharp, and highly energetic endotherm. We have shown that the thermal helix-coil transition proceeds via a single, first-order rate process (15Miles C.A. Burjanadze T.V. Bailey A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 245: 437-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) in which there is no intermediate state.In this paper, we report that the UV-induced transition proceeds via a previously unknown intermediate state and discuss the possible mechanisms involved. It was possible to demonstrate minor changes in the structure of the collagen molecule resulting in the intermediate state and follow the progression of cross-linking and degradation. An understanding of the mechanisms involved in these changes and their inhibition is obviously of considerable interest to the effect of UV on the aging of dermal collagen and the use of UV in the treatment of psoriasis, where there is a potential for damage to the underlying collagen fibers.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCollagen SolutionsCollagen solutions were prepared from tendons freshly dissected from frozen rat tails, dissolved in 0.5 m acetic acid, and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 20 min to remove undissolved material. The solution was scanned by DSC to determine the enthalpy of the transition per unit volume of the solution, and the concentration of collagen was calculated using a transition enthalpy of 70 J/g (12Privalov P.L. Tiktopulo E.I. Tischenko V.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 127: 203-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). On this basis, the solution concentration was adjusted to 2 mg/ml by the addition of 0.5 m acetic acid, prior to UV irradiation.Ultraviolet IrradiationSolutions were irradiated using UV-C light from two 6-watt fluorescent lamps (type TUV 6W; Philips, Croydon, Surrey, UK) each specified by the manufacturers to yield an output of 2.1 watts centered at 253.7 nm. The tubes were mounted in a plane with their axes parallel and 4 cm apart. To the rear of the tubes was a cylindrically concave reflecting head (Agar Products Ltd., Stansted, Essex, UK), directing the UV light forward through a 6 × 24-cm rectangular aperture. The collagen solution was held in a quartz cuvette, placed centrally in the beam with its front face positioned 1 cm from the tangential plane connecting the front surfaces of the fluorescent tubes.DSC AnalysisAfter measured irradiation times, 0.4 ml of solution was taken from the cuvette and diluted to 0.4 mg/ml with 0.5 m acetic acid. The solution was stirred and degassed for 8 min using a Thermovac apparatus (Microcal Inc., Northampton, MA) and scanned in a VP-DSC (Microcal) from 10 to 60 °C. Numerical analysis of the data was undertaken with the Microcal software using a cubic interpolation for the base line and a “non-two-state” fitting procedure with cursor initiation. To obtain convergence, it was necessary to provide initial estimates of ΔH v on the order of 105cal/mol. Least squares fitting of the nonlinear function (Equation 2) was performed using Origin Software.Hydrogen PeroxideTo investigate the effect of increasing OH⋅ radical concentration during UV irradiation, approximately 0.3% hydrogen peroxide (Sigma) was added to the collagen solution prior to irradiation.Thiourea and CysteamineTo examine the effect of reducing the free radical concentration during UV irradiation, the free radical scavengers, thiourea and cysteamine (Sigma), were added at concentrations of 1, 10, and 100 mmSLS Crystal FormationThe irradiated solutions were examined to see whether the collagen molecules were still capable of producing SLS crystals and fibers. SLS crystals were prepared as follows. Solutions were diluted to 0.2 mg/ml collagen in 0.05 m acetic acid and dialyzed against 0.4 g of ATP dissolved in 0.05 m acetic acid. The crystallites were examined by transmission electron microscopy (Philips 400). Other subsamples of the crystallites were degassed and run in the VP-DSC, and the collagen content of further samples were measured by hydroxyproline analysis both in the suspensions themselves, the pellet after centrifugation of a specified volume, and the supernatant. The latter tests were done to determine how much of the sample produced the SLS crystals.Chemical AnalysesAmino Acid CompositionThe composition of the irradiated collagen was determined to investigate any specificity in the degradation of the amino acids. The samples were hydrolyzed in 6m hydrochloric acid and analyzed on an Alpha Plus II Autoanalyzer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using the standard program, and detection of the amino acids was achieved by postcolumn derivatization using ninhydrin.Intermolecular Cross-linksThe presence of cross-links was determined on the Alpha Plus using a modified gradient as described previously in detail (16Sims T.J. Bailey A.J. J. Chromotogr. 1992; 582: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).Hydroxyproline AssayThe collagen content was determined by the standard colorimetric assay (17Bergman I. Loxley R. Anal. Chem. 1963; 35: 1961-1965Crossref Scopus (1290) Google Scholar) but employing the continuous system from Chemlab based on the method of Grant (18Grant R.A. J. Clin. Pathol. 1964; 17: 685-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar).Chemical Synthesis of DityrosineDityrosine was synthesized by peroxide oxidation of tyrosine according to the method described by Nomura et al.(19Nomura U. Suzuka N. Matsumoto Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4525-4534Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).End Group AnalysisDetermination of new amino acid end groups exposed on cleavage of the peptide chains was made by fluorescamine (Sigma). 0.2% (w/v) fluorescamine in acetone was added to 0.4 m lithium borate buffer, and fluorescence was read after 1 min using excitation at 390 nm and measuring emission at 475 nm, as described in detail (20Smolenski K.A. Avery N.C. Light N.D. Biochem. J. 1983; 213: 525-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Preliminary measurements with known quantities of glycine (Sigma) were used to calibrate the fluorescence reading in terms of numbers of amide groups.Polyacrylamide Gel ElectrophoresisThe molecular weight changes were demonstrated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (21Laemmli U. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206048) Google Scholar) followed by staining with Coomassie Blue; the stained gels were scanned using an Agfa Studioscan I flat bed scanner and Adobe Photoshop software; and the image was analyzed using the NIH Image package.DISCUSSIONWe have shown that ultraviolet light reduces the native triple helical collagen to random chains via an intermediate state of slightly lower thermal stability, at a T m of around 32 instead of 39 °C.The high enthalpy of denaturation and the highly cooperative thermal unfolding of the intermediate state are characteristic features of the triple helix and are therefore consistent with the intermediate state being mainly triple helical. Since the gels showed loss of both α- and β-bands together, we interpret the loss as being caused by chain scission. The gel analysis (Fig. 5) revealed that no intact α-chains remained after 1 h of irradiation, when about 60% of the collagen was in the intermediate state (Fig. 3). Chain scission is known to destabilize collagen (24Rossi A. Zanaboni G. Cetta G. Tenni R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 488-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Thus, we suggest that the intermediate state is a triple helix destabilized, at least partly, by UV-induced chain scission. While the triple helix remains intact, due to hydrogen bonding, a small number of chain scissions would be expected to cause little change in the enthalpy of denaturation, since most of the interchain hydrogen bonds would remain unaffected. The reduction in denaturation temperature would be caused mainly by entropic effects. Irradiated preparations, containing only intermediate state with very little native triple helix, still produced high yields of SLS crystallites, confirming that the intermediate state was triple helical and that the damaged triple helix was the same length as the native molecule (Table III). The intermediate state SLS crystals were less thermally stable than the native SLS crystals (Table III), reflecting the fact that the molecules themselves were intrinsically less stable, due to UV damage. The molecules in SLS crystals possessed a higher denaturation temperature than the same molecules in solution due to intermolecular interactions, as observed in fibers (14Miles C.A. Ghelashvili M. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 3243-3252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar).The formation of the intermediate state and the disappearance of the α1- and α2-chains on the gels (see Fig. 5) occurred at similar rates (compare Fig. 5 and Table II). We suggest that chain scission is predominantly random, occurring at many possible sites along the length of the chains as, by about 30 min of irradiation, the gels showed a rather uniform smearing out of the bands down the gel. However, we note that there is some evidence initially of specific scission with new bands occurring on the gels just below the α-bands. We suggest that these may be associated with parts of the molecule that are relatively sensitive to OH⋅ radical attack. These active radicals are presumably produced from H2O2 and O2−.The substantial increase in k 1 andk 2 that was observed upon introducing hydrogen peroxide into the sample was presumably caused by increased concentrations of OH⋅ radicals induced by the splitting of the hydrogen peroxide molecule into two OH⋅ radicals by ultraviolet light (23Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine. 3rd Ed. Oxford University Press, Oxford1999Google Scholar).The OH⋅ radicals clearly induce chain scission, which leads to loss of thermal stability. The involvement of OH⋅ radicals, which would be present along the whole length of the collagen molecule, would explain why the cutting of the α-chains is predominantly random at points along the chain. This explanation was reinforced by observations of the effect of the OH⋅ radical scavengers thiourea and cysteamine, which substantially reducedk 1 and k 2 and chain scission (gels not shown) even in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. These scavengers also reduced UV damage even when no peroxide was added; thiourea was so effective that at a concentration 100 mm there was no resolvable loss in thermal stability and no intermediate state even after 1-h irradiation (Fig. 8).Each scission event will cause more or less loss of thermal stability depending on its position along the chain. Our suggestion that the degradation of collagen to random coils is via the action of free radicals causing random scission along the length of all the α-chains is consistent with the observation that the endotherms at 39 and 32 °C are caused by a population of molecules that increase in heterogeneity and fall in thermal stability as the irradiation proceeds (Fig. 4). We suggest that the effect of several chain scissions reducesT m by opening up the helix. We speculate that the intermediate state is formed once the accumulated damage destabilizes the molecule beyond a critical level, which causes the transition temperature to flip from ∼39 to ∼32 °C, i.e. to flip to the intermediate state. Since the rate constant for generating the intermediate state is faster than that for its subsequent degradation, we deduce that the average number of scissions yielding the intermediate state is less than the average number of further scissions required to reduce the intermediate state to random coils.By drawing all of the results together, we can begin to piece together the possible sequence of events by which UV light reduces collagen molecules to random coils via an intermediate state. The primary effect of UV light is to generate free radicals in the water molecules surrounding the collagen molecule, and these radicals react with the collagen, destabilizing it. At least one of these reactions causes chain scission, which can occur at many sites along the length of the molecule, and the selection of these sites is predominantly random. The number of intact α-chains in the population of collagen molecules therefore declines, as observed in the gels, and the number of scission points increases, as observed. While there is evidence from the gels of some new bands being formed, indicating that some sites along the α-chains are more likely to be cut than others, the cutting is predominantly random. Thus, the majority of the cut α-chain matter was smeared out along the whole length of the gel. As irradiation proceeds, the number of undamaged molecules falls and the number of damaged molecules rises. A population of new molecules with different damaged sites is produced, and these molecules have slightly different thermal stabilities, broadening the denaturation endotherm and reducingT max. Provided the damage is less than a certain critical level, the mechanism by which the triple helix unfolds is basically unaltered, requiring the initial uncoupling of the α-chains of the major thermally labile unit at the C end of the molecule (15Miles C.A. Burjanadze T.V. Bailey A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 245: 437-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), followed by the rapid unzipping of the three chains along the length of the molecule. The enthalpies of activation are therefore the same in these slightly damaged molecules, and the reductions in stabilities are caused by an increase in the entropy of activation resulting from the increased flexibility of the damaged helix. Once sufficient damage has been inflicted, beyond the hypothetical critical level, the molecule becomes so unstable that the denaturation temperature flips, from its value around 39 °C to a new temperature around 32 °C. This is because the unzipping of the intermediate state needs fewer bonds to be broken initially to produce the required free energy of activation. The precise amount of damage that corresponds to the critical level has not been defined by these experiments, but comparison of the rate at which the number of undamaged chains declines in gels with the rate at which the intermediate state forms indicates that the critical level corresponds with at least two or all three chains being cut within the molecule. Thus, the single scission of a single chain is not sufficient to yield random coils, and the process of degradation of the native triple helix proceeds indirectly via an intermediate state. This intermediate state is basically triple helical and the same length as the unirradiated molecule, but with cuts in the α-chains. It therefore has an enthalpy of denaturation very close to that of native collagen, shows a highly cooperative denaturation process, and produces SLS crystals of the same length as those of native collagen.Further scission of the chains in the intermediate state destabilizes it even further. The T max of the denaturation endotherm therefore falls, while its width increases due to increasing heterogeneity in stability of the population of molecules comprising the intermediate state. Some scissions are sufficient to reduce part, or the whole, of the intermediate state molecule to random coils. With increasing irradiation times, the pool of molecules with a denaturation temperature around 39 °C declines to zero as they are reduced to the intermediate state, and all that remains are random chains and intermediate state. Finally, degradation of the intermediate state through chain scission continues until all of the molecules are reduced to random chains. The number of chain scissions required to cause complete disruption of the triple helical structure we estimate to be about 3 per chain on average, based on comparison with the gels. Since generation of the intermediate state requires on average about one cut per chain, the rate constant k 2 is always smaller than k 1.In summary, we have shown that the collagen molecule can be quite extensively damaged by cleavage of the primary peptide bonds without disorganizing the triple helical structure. This leads to the formation of a damaged “intermediate state” prior to degradation of the molecules to random chains. The initial gelation of the solution indicates that both cross-linking and chain cleavage are occurring but that the prevalent reaction is chain cleavage by hydroxyl radicals. An understanding of the mechanisms involved will be of considerable value in future studies of the effects of UV on dermal collagen in photoaging. Studies of the effect of UV radiation on the properties of the collagen molecule, in solution or in its aggregated fiber form, are rather limited. It has been reported that cross-linking and degradation (1Fujimori E. FEBS Lett. 1988; 235: 98-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) occur on exposure to UV, the relative proportions depending on the presence of oxygen, pH of solution, type of collagen, and wavelength of the UV. These effects have been attributed to absorption by the aromatic groups, phenylalanine and tyrosine, with the suggestion that cross-linking could be mediated through dityrosine cross-links (2Kato Y. Uchida K. Kawakishi S. Photochem. Photobiol. 1994; 59: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), although no detailed chemistry has been carried out to demonstrate the presence of this cross-link. For example, Kato et al. (3Kato Y. Takashi N. Shundro K. Photochem. Photobiol. 1995; 61: 367-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) reported loss of tyrosine and cross-linking in both type I and IV collagens but could not detect dityrosine, only DOPA.1 Kaminska and Sionkowska (4Kaminska A. Sionkowska A. Polymer Degradation Stability. 1996; 51: 19-26Crossref Scopus (131) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the infrared amide bands were shifted to a lower frequency, indicating that structural changes were taking place in the molecule. They also deduced that helix-random coil transitions were taking place by reduction in the viscosity (5Sionkowska A. Kaminska A. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1999; 24: 337-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Much earlier, Bailey (6Bailey A.J. Radiat. Res. 1967; 31: 206-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) had shown that ionizing-radiation (cobalt 60) reduced the denaturation temperature of collagen solutions in a biphasic manner, and Hayashi et al. (7Hayashi T. Curran-Patel S. Prockop D.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 4182-4187Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) reported a similar biphasic phenomenon when collagen was irradiated with UV light during CD measurements. The collagen family of proteins (currently 20) constitute 25% of the total protein mass of the body and determine architecture, tissue strength, and cell-collagen interactions. A characteristic feature of collagen is the triple helical structure of three left-handed polyproline type helices twisted into a right-handed superhelix. The formation of such a structure is due to the repeating sequence Gly-X-Y, where X and Y are often proline and hydroxyproline, respectively, and hydrogen bonding takes place between chains within the triple helix. On heating, the triple helix unfolds to produce random chains of gelatin (8Harrington W.F. von Hippel P.H. Adv. Protein Chem. 1969; 16: 1-138Google Scholar), and this transition has been studied by polarimetry (9Burjanadze T.V. Bezhitadze M.O. Biopolymers. 1992; 32: 951-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), spectrometry (10Danielsen C.C. Biochem. J. 1990; 272: 697-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), circular dichroism (7Hayashi T. Curran-Patel S. Prockop D.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 4182-4187Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and viscosity (11Rose C. Kumar M. Mandal A.B. Biochem. J. 1988; 249: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, we believe that the most powerful technique is differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), which provides direct measurements of thermodynamic characteristics and, unlike the other methods, is equally applicable to collagen solutions (12Privalov P.L. Tiktopulo E.I. Tischenko V.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 127: 203-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), fibers (13Tiktopulo E.I. Kajava A.V. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8147-8152Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and tissues (14Miles C.A. Ghelashvili M. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 3243-3252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Collagen monomers in solution unfold abruptly to yield a single, sharp, and highly energetic endotherm. We have shown that the thermal helix-coil transition proceeds via a single, first-order rate process (15Miles C.A. Burjanadze T.V. Bailey A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 245: 437-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) in which there is no intermediate state. In this paper, we report that the UV-induced transition proceeds via a previously unknown intermediate state and discuss the possible mechanisms involved. It was possible to demonstrate minor changes in the structure of the collagen molecule resulting in the intermediate state and follow the progression of cross-linking and degradation. An understanding of the mechanisms involved in these changes and their inhibition is obviously of considerable interest to the effect of UV on the aging of dermal collagen and the use of UV in the treatment of psoriasis, where there is a potential for damage to the underlying collagen fibers. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCollagen SolutionsCollagen solutions were prepared from tendons freshly dissected from frozen rat tails, dissolved in 0.5 m acetic acid, and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 20 min to remove undissolved material. The solution was scanned by DSC to determine the enthalpy of the transition per unit volume of the solution, and the concentration of collagen was calculated using a transition enthalpy of 70 J/g (12Privalov P.L. Tiktopulo E.I. Tischenko V.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 127: 203-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). On this basis, the solution concentration was adjusted to 2 mg/ml by the addition of 0.5 m acetic acid, prior to UV irradiation.Ultraviolet IrradiationSolutions were irradiated using UV-C light from two 6-watt fluorescent lamps (type TUV 6W; Philips, Croydon, Surrey, UK) each specified by the manufacturers to yield an output of 2.1 watts centered at 253.7 nm. The tubes were mounted in a plane with their axes parallel and 4 cm apart. To the rear of the tubes was a cylindrically concave reflecting head (Agar Products Ltd., Stansted, Essex, UK), directing the UV light forward through a 6 × 24-cm rectangular aperture. The collagen solution was held in a quartz cuvette, placed centrally in the beam with its front face positioned 1 cm from the tangential plane connecting the front surfaces of the fluorescent tubes.DSC AnalysisAfter measured irradiation times, 0.4 ml of solution was taken from the cuvette and diluted to 0.4 mg/ml with 0.5 m acetic acid. The solution was stirred and degassed for 8 min using a Thermovac apparatus (Microcal Inc., Northampton, MA) and scanned in a VP-DSC (Microcal) from 10 to 60 °C. Numerical analysis of the data was undertaken with the Microcal software using a cubic interpolation for the base line and a “non-two-state” fitting procedure with cursor initiation. To obtain convergence, it was nec"

In turn, phosphorylation of PLCβ by PKC may play a role in the regulation of receptor-mediated phosphatidylinositide (PI) turnover and intracellular Ca2+ release. Activation of endogenous PKC by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate inhibited both Gαq-coupled (oxytocin and M1 muscarinic) and Gαi-coupled (formyl-Met-Leu-Phe) receptor-stimulated PI turnover by 50–100% in PHM1, HeLa, COSM6, and RBL-2H3 cells expressing PLCβ3. Activation of conventional PKCs with thymeleatoxin similarly inhibited oxytocin or formyl-Met-Leu-Phe receptor-stimulated PI turnover. The PKC inhibitory effect was also observed when PLCβ3 was stimulated directly by Gαq or Gβγ in overexpression assays. PKC phosphorylated PLCβ3 at the same predominant site in vivo and in vitro. Peptide sequencing of in vitro phosphorylated recombinant PLCβ3 and site-directed mutagenesis identified Ser1105 as the predominant phosphorylation site. Ser1105 is also phosphorylated by protein kinase A (PKA; Yue, C., Dodge, K. L., Weber, G., and Sanborn, B. M. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 18023–18027). Similar to PKA, the inhibition by PKC of Gαq-stimulated PLCβ3 activity was completely abolished by mutation of Ser1105 to Ala. In contrast, mutation of Ser1105 or Ser26, another putative phosphorylation target, to Ala had no effect on inhibition of Gβγ-stimulated PLCβ3activity by PKC or PKA. These data indicate that PKC and PKA act similarly in that they inhibit Gαq-stimulated PLCβ3 as a result of phosphorylation of Ser1105. Moreover, PKC and PKA both inhibit Gβγ-stimulated activity by mechanisms that do not involve Ser1105.

Sci. 1992; 17: 414-417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). The inhibition of PI turnover by PKC may present a feedback for determining the frequency and amplitude of signals being transmitted. The mechanisms by which PKC inhibits agonist-stimulated PI turnover have not been well defined. PKC can phosphorylate certain G protein-coupled receptors (platelet-activating factor receptor, C5A receptor) and thereby inhibit PI turnover or intracellular calcium release (reviewed in Ref. 27Ali H. Richardson R.M. Haribabu B. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6027-6030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). PKC also appears to inhibit agonist-stimulated PI turnover at a post-receptor level (25Richardson R.M. Ali H. Tomhave E.D. Haribabu B. Snyderman R. J. Biol.

J. 1997; 326: 701-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), the physiological relevance of these observations has not been demonstrated. PLCβt, a turkey PLCβ isoform with highest homology to PLCβ2, is phosphorylated by conventional PKCs, and its catalytic activity is inhibited (29Filtz T.M. Cunningham M.L. Stanig K.J. Paterson A. Harden T.K. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). PLCβ3 is not phosphorylated by PKCαin vitro (23Litosch I. Recept. Signal Transduct. 1996; 6: 87-98PubMed Google Scholar). Nonetheless, a correlation between PLCβ3 phosphorylation and PKC inhibition of receptor-initiated PI turnover has been reported (21Ali H.

Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 1047-1053PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the importance of PLCβ3 phosphorylation by PKC, we have identified the phosphorylation site on PLCβ3and investigated which PKC subfamily can catalyze the phosphorylation. We report the identification of Ser1105 as the predominant PKC phosphorylation site, the involvement of conventional PKCs in this phosphorylation, and the convergence of PKC and PKA on phosphorylation and inhibition of PLCβ3 by Gαq. Furthermore, we find that Gβγ-stimulated PLCβ3activity is inhibited by both PKC and PKA by mechanisms that do not involve Ser1105 phosphorylation. Thymeleatoxin (Tx), Gö 6976, PKC catalytic fragment, PKCβ1, and PKCγ were obtained from Calbiochem. H-89 was purchased from Seikagaku America, Inc. (Rockville MD).

LipofectAMINE, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), phosphate-free DMEM, and all other cell culture reagents were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. [3H]Inositol (22 Ci/mmol) was obtained from American Radiolabeled Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO), [32P]orthophosphate (5 mCi/ml) and γ-[32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The RBL-2H3 cell line stably expressing fMLP receptor and fMLP were provided by Dr. D. Haviland, University of Texas, Houston. The plasmid encoding PKA catalytic subunit was provided by Dr. G. S. McKnight, Washington University (Seattle, WA). PLCβ3, Gαq, Gβ1, and Gγ2 plasmids were constructed as described elsewhere (12Yue C. Dodge K.L. Weber G. Sanborn B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18023-18027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 32Wu D. Katz A. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5297-52301Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutation of Ser26 to Ala was achieved with the mutagenic primer (5′-CGGCGCGGGGCTAAGTTCATCAAATGG-3′) identically as described for the Ser1105 → Ala mutation (12Yue C. Dodge K.L. Weber G. Sanborn B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18023-18027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) using GeneEditor. All plasmid sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Construction of baculovirus containing PLCβ3 Ser1105 → Ala(His)6 and purification of the recombinant protein from Sf9 cells were carried out as described for PLCβ3(His)6 (12Yue C. Dodge K.L. Weber G. Sanborn B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18023-18027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). For in vivo phosphorylation, COSM6 cells seeded in 6-well plates were transfected with PLCβ3(His)6 plasmid and metabolically labeled with [32P] ortho-phosphate (0.10 mCi) in 0.5 ml of phosphate-free DMEM for 90 min. After PMA (1 μm) treatment for 30 min, cells were lysed in 500 μl of M-PER lysis buffer (Pierce) containing a mixture of protease and phosphatase inhibitors (21Ali H. Fisher I. Haribabu B. Richardson R.M. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11706-11709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Phosphorylated PLCβ3(His)6was isolated with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin, separated on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, stained with Coomassie Blue, and analyzed by autoradiography. In vitro phosphorylation by PKC was carried out according to protocols provided by the vendor. Briefly, 0.8 μmpurified recombinant PLCβ3(His)6 or PLCβ3Ser1105 → Ala(His)6was incubated with purified constitutively active PKC fragment (0.04 μm) in the presence of 2.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 100 μm ATP in a total volume of 10 μl of PKC buffer (50 mm MES, pH 6.5, 1.25 mm EGTA, 12.5 mm MgCl2) for the times specified at 30 °C. Equal amounts of PLCβ3(His)6 were also incubated for 40 min with purified PKCβ1 or PKCγ (20 ng) in a total volume of 10 μl of reaction buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 μm CaCl2, 10 mmMgCl2, 100 μg/ml phosphatidylserine, 20 μg/ml diacylglycerol, 0.03% Triton X-100). Reactions were terminated by adding 10 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. Proteins were separated by 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and stained with Coomassie Blue. The phosphorylated bands were localized by autoradiography. The stoichiometry of PLCβ3phosphorylation by PKC was determined at 100 min by filter binding assay as described elsewhere (12Yue C. Dodge K.L. Weber G. Sanborn B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18023-18027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). For two-dimensional tryptic peptide mapping and phosphoamino acid analysis, 32P-labeled PLCβ3from in vivo or in vitro phosphorylation reactions was separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gel was stained with Coomassie Blue, dried between two layers of drying membranes, and exposed to Biomax-MS x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.). PLCβ3 bands were cut out and rehydrated in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8 (buffer A), overnight. After peeling off the drying membrane, each gel slice was boiled for 5 min in 100 μl of buffer A containing 5 mm dithiothreitol. The tube was cooled to room temperature, 50 μl of 100 mmiodoacetic acid was added, and the tube was incubated for 30 min in the dark at room temperature. The gel slice was washed again in buffer A and ground with a disposable pestle. The residual Coomassie Blue dye was removed by rinsing the gel slurry with 50 μl of 50% acetonitrile in buffer A. The tube was centrifuged at 15,000 × gfor 5 min, and the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was resuspended in 50 μl of acetonitrile and incubated for 5 min. The tube was centrifuged again, and the pellet was dried in a SpeedVac for 10 min after removal of supernatant. The pellet was resuspended in 75 μl of buffer A, and 2 μg of trypsin was added. The tube was incubated at 37 °C for 5 h before the addition of another 2 μg of trypsin, and the total incubation time was between 18 and 24 h. The liquid containing the digested peptides was recovered and further prepared for two-dimensional peptide mapping with a Hunter thin layer electrophoresis system (C.B.S. Scientific Co., Del Mar, CA) according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. External markers for each dimension were included in each thin layer plate to facilitate the comparison between samples. For phosphoamino acid analysis, about 100 cpm of total tryptic peptides mixture was used. Peptide sequencing using 32P-labeled PLCβ3(His)6 (150 pmol) recombinant protein purified from Sf9 cells was carried out as described elsewhere (12Yue C. Dodge K.L. Weber G. Sanborn B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18023-18027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). HeLa, COSM6, and RBL-2H3 cells were cultured as described for PHM1-41 cells (33Monga M. Ku C.Y. Dodge K.L. Sanborn B.M. Biol. Reprod. 1996; 55: 427-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). HeLa and COSM6 cells (1.8 × 105/well) were seeded in 6-well plates and transfected 16–24 h later as described (34Dodge K.L. Sanborn B.M. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 2265-2271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with M1 receptor (1 μg), Gαq (0.5 μg), Gβ1(0.375 μg), Gγ2 (0.375 μg), and PLCβ3(0.25 μg) as indicated. Empty rcCMV vector was added to bring the total amount of plasmid DNA to 1.25 μg per well. For effects of endogenous PKC on agonist-stimulated PI turnover, near confluent PHM1 and RBL-2H3 cells (12-well plates) and COSM6 and HeLa cells (6-well plates) were treated with 1 μm PMA or 100 ng/ml thymeleatoxin for 30 min in PBS+ (phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) plus 1.2 mm Ca2+, 1.0 mmMg2+, and 1.0 mm glucose) containing 10 mm LiCl prior to stimulation by agonists (100 nm oxytocin, 15 μm carbachol, or 100 nm fMLP) for 30 min. Where indicated, H-89 (10 μm) or Gö 6976 (8 μm) were added to PHM1-41 cells. After 15 min, PMA or CPT-cAMP were added, followed by oxytocin 15 min later. For direct stimulation of PLCβ3 by Gαq or Gβ1γ2, transfected COSM6 cells were first treated with 1 μm PMA for 30 min in PBS+ followed by addition of 20 mm LiCl for 30 min. Cells were lysed, and total IPs were determined as described (19Liu M. Simon M.I. Nature. 1996; 382: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The effect of activation of endogenous PKC on predominantly Gαq-coupled oxytocin receptor-initiated PI turnover (35Ku C.Y. Qian A. Wen Y. Anwer K. Sanborn B.M. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 1509-1515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was studied in PHM1-41 cells, a human myometrial smooth muscle cell line (33Monga M. Ku C.Y. Dodge K.L. Sanborn B.M. Biol. Reprod. 1996; 55: 427-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Stimulation of PHM1 cells with 100 nm oxytocin significantly increased the production of total IPs. Pretreating cells with 1 μm PMA completely inhibited this increase (Fig. 1 A). The PMA effect was not specific to the oxytocin receptor or to PHM1-41 cells. A similar inhibitory effect of PMA was also evident with Gαq-coupled M1 muscarinic receptor transfected into HeLa (Fig. 1 B) or COSM6 (Fig. 1 C) cells. In addition, PMA also significantly inhibited Gαi-coupled fMLP receptor-initiated PI turnover (36Jiang H. Kuang Y. Wu Y. Smrcka A. Simon M.I. Wu D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13430-13434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) in RBL-2H3 cells (Fig.1 D) in which the only PLCβ form expressed is PLCβ3 (21Ali H. Fisher I. Haribabu B. Richardson R.M. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11706-11709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This occurred under conditions where the fMLP receptor has been shown not to be phosphorylated by PKC (37Richardson R.M. Ali H. Pridgen B.C. Haribabu B. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10690-10695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These observations, together with those previously reported (21Ali H. Fisher I. Haribabu B. Richardson R.M. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11706-11709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 31Strassheim D. Law P.Y. Loh H.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 1047-1053PubMed Google Scholar), establish that the PKC inhibitory effect on G protein-coupled receptor-initiated PI turnover is a general mechanism and that the PKC effect can occur at a post-receptor level. To investigate the potential role of specific PKCs in this process, the effect of Tx, a specific activator of conventional PKCs (38Ryves W.J. Evans A.T. Olivier A.R. Parker P.J. Evans F.J. FEBS Lett. 1991; 288: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), was compared with PMA, which activates both conventional and novel PKCs (38Ryves W.J. Evans A.T. Olivier A.R. Parker P.J. Evans F.J. FEBS Lett. 1991; 288: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), in PHM1-41 and RBL-2H3 cell lines. In both cases, Tx was as effective as PMA in inhibiting oxytocin or fMLP-stimulated PI turnover at the concentration tested (Fig. 1, A and D). In addition, Gö 6976, an inhibitor of conventional PKC (39Qatsha K.A. Rudolph C. Marme D. Schachtele C. May W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4674-4678Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), was able to reverse the PMA inhibitory effect by ∼50% at a concentration of 4 μm (data not shown). These data provide evidence that conventional PKCs are capable of inhibiting Gαq- or Gαi-coupled receptor-initiated PI turnover. Because PLCβ3 is present in all four cell lines mentioned above and can be phosphorylated by PKC, at least in RBL-2H3 cells (21Ali H. Fisher I. Haribabu B. Richardson R.M. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11706-11709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), it is highly possible that PKC inhibits PI turnover by decreasing PLCβ3 activity. If so, PKC should inhibit the direct stimulation of PLCβ3 by Gαq or Gβγ. COSM6 cells transfected with both PLCβ3 and Gαq plasmids exhibited a marked increase in total [3H]IPs compared with transfection with either plasmid alone (Fig. 2 A). Consistent with the prediction, pretreating cells with PMA nearly abolished Gαq-stimulated PLCβ3 activity. Tx elicited a similar inhibitory effect on Gαq-stimulated PLCβ3 activity (data not shown). Cotransfection of Gβ1γ2 and PLCβ3 into COSM6 cells also resulted in marked increase in PI turnover. This increase was significantly reduced by PMA (Fig. 2 B), but the reduction was not of the magnitude observed for Gαq-stimulated PLCβ3. Thus PKC inhibition of PI turnover occurs at a post-receptor level, and this effect may require the phosphorylation of PLCβ3. PLCβ3 overexpressed in COSM6 cells exhibited significant 32P incorporation under basal conditions. Nonetheless, PMA induced a substantial increase in 32P incorporation into PLCβ3 (Fig.3 A). The phosphorylation of PLCβ3 by PKC was investigated further in vitro. Purified recombinant PLCβ3 was incubated with catalytically active PKC fragments (a rat brain mixture of multiple PKC isoforms, including α, β, and γ) in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. As shown in Fig. 3 B, PLCβ3 was phosphorylated in a time-dependent manner. A stoichiometry of 0.4 mol of phosphate/PLCβ3 was achieved after incubation with PKC for 100 min under these conditions. In similar experiments, no phosphorylation was seen in the absence of PKC (data not shown). Purified PKCβ1 or PKCγ also phosphorylated PLCβ3 in vitro, whereas no phosphorylation of PLCβ3 was observed in the absence of kinase (Fig. 3 C). As shown by two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping of in vivo 32P-labeled PLCβ3, trypsin digestion yielded multiple phosphopeptides in the basal state (Fig.4 A). PMA specifically induced phosphorylation on one predominant site (Fig. 4 B, indicated by the arrow). Minor sites increased by PMA were also present (indicated by arrowhead). We cannot exclude the contribution of incomplete digestion by trypsin to this pattern. In vitro, PKC phosphorylated PLCβ3 on one predominant site (Fig. 4 C, arrow). The migration of this peptide relative to the standards was identical to those observed in digests after in vivo phosphorylation. The phosphorylation occurred exclusively on serine residues (Fig.4 D). We utilized in vitro phosphorylated recombinant PLCβ3(His)6 to identify the PKC phosphorylation sites. After isolation by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, 32P-labeled PLCβ3 was digested with Lys C instead of trypsin to achieve more complete cleavage and fewer peptides (12Yue C. Dodge K.L. Weber G. Sanborn B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18023-18027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The digestion mixture was separated by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography, and fractions were recovered and counted. Fig.5 A shows the 32P distribution among these fractions. About 8% of 32P was found in the follow-through (fraction −1 to −4) and appeared to be free 32P as judged by phosphopeptide mapping (data not shown). Nearly 60% of the total 32P was recovered in fraction 12. This fraction was subjected to peptide sequencing. Although two peptides were identified in this fraction, nearly 90% of the total 32P was found in the fourth cycle (Fig.5 B). This clearly identified Ser1105 and not Ser1107 in the peptide Arg-His-Asn-Ser1105-Ile-Ser-Glu-Ala-Lys as the amino acid phosphorylated. Furthermore, mutation of Ser1105significantly diminished PLCβ3 phosphorylation by PKC in vitro (Fig. 5 C). This strongly argues that Ser1105 is the predominant site for PKC. Residual weak phosphorylation associated with Ser1105 → Ala mutant PLCβ3 could indicate the presence of other minor sites. Interestingly, Ser1105, unique to PLCβ3 among the PLCβ isoforms, is preferentially phosphorylated by PKA as well (12Yue C. Dodge K.L. Weber G. Sanborn B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18023-18027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that phosphorylation by PKA of Ser1105 is required for inhibition of Gαq-stimulated PLCβ3 activity by PKA. The finding that PKC also phosphorylates Ser1105 suggested that the same mechanism was utilized by PKC. To test this hypothesis, the Ser1105 → Ala mutant PLCβ3 was cotransfected with Gαq into COSM6 cells, and the effect of PMA was evaluated. As shown before (12Yue C. Dodge K.L. Weber G. Sanborn B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18023-18027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), the Ser1105 → Ala mutant PLCβ3 was as effective as the wild type enzyme in coupling to Gαq (Fig.6). Importantly, PMA inhibited Gαq-stimulated wild type PLCβ3 activity but had no effect on Gαq-stimulated Ser1105 → Ala PLCβ3 activity. These data unequivocally identify phosphorylation of Ser1105 by PKC as responsible for PKC inhibition of Gαq-stimulated PLCβ3activity. We also investigated the effect of mutating Ser1105 on PKC inhibition of Gβγ-stimulated PLCβ3 activity. The Ser1105 → Ala mutant PLCβ3 was as effective as wild type PLCβ3 in coupling to Gβ1γ2 (Fig.7 A). However in contrast to Gαq-stimulated PLCβ3 activity, PKC inhibited Gβ1γ2-stimulated Ser1105 → Ala mutant PLCβ3 activity to the similar degree as it did the wild type PLCβ3. Thus Ser1105 is not absolutely required for PKC inhibition of Gβ1γ2-stimulated PLCβ3activity. The N-terminal region of PLCβ3 appears to contribute to its interaction with Gβγ (40Bell R.M. Burns D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4661-4664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We had identified Ser26 in the peptide Arg-Arg-Gly-Ser-Lys as a potential phosphorylation site in this region. However, there was no effect of mutating Ser26 to Ala on PKC inhibition of Gβγ-stimulated PLCβ3 activity (Fig.7 A). In the face of the inability of mutation of Ser1105 and Ser26 to reverse the effect of PKC on Gβγ-stimulated PLCβ3 activity, we examined the effect of mutation of these residues on PKA-mediated inhibition as well. As seen in Fig.7 B, PKA inhibited Gβγ-stimulated PLCβ3activity. Mutation of Ser1105 or Ser26 also had no effect on inhibition by PKA of Gβγ-stimulated PLCβ3 activity. Phosphoryation of Ser1105 by PKC or PKA suppressed Gαq-stimulated PLCβ3 activity. This fact raised the interesting possibility that PKC activation might lead to PKA activation, resulting in indirect phosphorylation of PLCβ3 at the PKA site or vice versa. We addressed this possibility in PHM1-41 cells. As shown in Fig.8, H-89, a specific PKA inhibitor, reversed the inhibition by cAMP but did not affect the inhibition by PMA of oxytocin-stimulated PI turnover. Similarly, Gö 6976, a specific PKC inhibitor, significantly diminished the inhibitory effect of PMA but not of cAMP on oxytocin-stimulated PI turnover. These data indicate that PKC and PKA exert their inhibitory effects independent of each other. We have presented evidence that PKC inhibits Gαq-coupled (oxytocin and M1 muscarinic) and Gαi-coupled receptor (fMLP) receptor-initiated PI turnover in four different cell lines expressing PLCβ3. The response to endogenous PKC activation by PMA differs in order of magnitude between cell lines and the state of the receptor (endogenous or transfected). This variation may reflect differences in relative membrane permeability of PMA and the localization and abundance of the PKC isoforms responsible or the relative contribution of Gαq-coupling to PLCβ3 to PI turnover. We have also demonstrated in cotransfection assays that the PKC inhibitory effect occurred at the G protein-PLCβ3 level, and we have provided direct evidence to support the hypothesis that phosphorylation of PLCβ3 is involved in the PKC inhibitory effect on Gαq-coupled activation. The use of in vitro phosphorylated PLCβ3 for identifying the PKC phosphorylation site is supported by the demonstration that a similar site was phosphorylated by PKC in vivo and in vitro. PKC phosphorylates predominantly one residue, Ser1105, that is also phosphorylated by PKA (12Yue C. Dodge K.L. Weber G. Sanborn B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18023-18027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The marked reduction of in vitro phosphorylation of the Ser1105 → Ala PLCβ3 mutant further corroborates this finding. However, the remaining weak phosphorylation associated with this mutant indicates that PKC may phosphorylate other minor sites as well. Mutation of Ser1105 to Ala reversed completely the inhibition of Gαq-stimulated PLCβ3 activity by PKC. This provides conclusive evidence for the direct inhibition of PLCβ3 by PKC, a response identical to that seen previously for PKA (12Yue C. Dodge K.L. Weber G. Sanborn B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18023-18027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We also demonstrated that the inhibitory effect of PKC occurs in the absence of PKA inhibition, suggesting that it is not a consequence of indirect PKA activation. The convergence of PKC and PKA on Ser1105 underscores the importance of Ser1105 in the regulation of Gαq-stimulated PLCβ3 activity in diverse cellular processes and suggests possible redundancy for the inhibition of PLCβ3 activity by these two kinases. In addition, these data also argue that the effect of PKC or PKA targets PLCβ3 and not G protein or proteins involved in the production of substrate phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, as mutation of Ser1105 can completely reverse the inhibition by PKC or PKA of Gαq-stimulated PLCβ3 activity. In marked contrast, Ser1105 does not appear to be critical for inhibition of Gβγ-stimulated PLCβ3 activity by either PKC or PKA. Ser26 was also not required, although the N-terminal region of PLCβ3 appears to contribute to its interaction with Gβγ (40Bell R.M. Burns D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4661-4664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At present the mechanism for the inhibition of Gβγ-stimulated PLCβ3 activity by PKC or PKA remains unknown. It is unlikely that Gβ1γ2 is the direct target for the inhibitory effects of PKA or PKC as these proteins are not phosphorylated by PKC or PKA in vitro. 2C. Yue and B. M. Sanborn, unpublished observations. Identification of PKA or PKC minor phosphorylation sites may help to solve this question. Alternatively, the mechanism may involve phosphorylation of other molecules indirectly involved in the coupling (12Yue C. Dodge K.L. Weber G. Sanborn B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18023-18027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The effects of a conventional PKC-specific activator and an inhibitor indicate that conventional PKCs are capable of phosphorylating PLCβ3. This conclusion is supported by in vitro phosphorylation of PLCβ3 by the constitutively active PKC fragment and by purified PKCβ1 and PKCγ. The wide distribution of conventional PKCs (26Asaoka Y. Nakamura S. Yoshida K. Nishizuka Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 414-417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar) and PLCβ3 (2Singer W.D. Brown H.A. Sternweis P.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 475-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) in tissues correlates well with the generality of the PKC inhibitory effect on receptor-initiated PI turnover. We conclude that conventional PKCs phosphorylate PLCβ3and inhibit Gαq- and Gβγ-stimulated PLCβ3 activity. PKC and PKA act similarly in that they inhibit Gαq-stimulated PLCβ3 as a result of phosphorylation of Ser1105. Moreover, PKA and PKC both inhibit Gβγ-stimulated activity by mechanisms that do not involve Ser1105. We thank Dr. S. McKnight and Dr. D. Haviland for providing valuable experimental materials."

Activated PAR1 was rapidly recruited to clathrin-coated pits, where it colocalized with transferrin receptor (TfnR). Dominant-negative dynamin and clathrin hub mutants both blocked PAR1 internalization. Blockade of PAR1 internalization with dynamin K44A also inhibited activation-dependent PAR1 degradation. Thus activated PAR1 internalizes via clathrin-coated pits together with receptors that recycle and is then sorted away from such receptors and delivered to lysosomes. In the course of these studies we identified a mutant HeLa cell line, designated JT1, that was defective in PAR1 internalization. PAR1 signaled robustly in JT1 cells but was not phosphorylated or recruited to clathrin-coated pits after activation. Internalization of TfnR was intact in JT1 cells and internalization of β2-adrenergic receptor, a GPCR that internalizes and recycles, was present but perhaps reduced. Taken together, these studies suggest that PAR1 is internalized in a dynamin- and clathrin-dependent manner like TfnR and β2-adrenergic receptor but requires a distinct gene product for recruitment into this pathway.

Most cellular actions of thrombin appear to be mediated by a family of protease-activated G protein-coupled receptors (PARs)1 (1Coughlin S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Thrombin binds to and cleaves the amino-terminal exodomain of PAR1 to unmask a new amino terminus that then acts as a tethered ligand, triggering transmembrane signaling (1Coughlin S.R. Proc. Natl.

The β2-adrenergic receptor (β2-AR) has been a model system for dissecting the molecular mechanisms responsible for desensitization and resensitization of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling (13Yu S.S.

Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 666-676PubMed Google Scholar). β2-AR is initially uncoupled from signaling by rapid phosphorylation of the activated receptor by G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) and other kinases. Receptor phosphorylation promotes the binding of arrestin. Arrestin binding prevents receptor interaction with G proteins and thereby uncouples the receptor from signaling. Arrestin binding also facilitates recruitment of β2-AR to clathrin-coated pits and internalization from the plasma membrane (16Goodman O.J. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B.

Once internalized into endosomes, ligand dissociates from β2-AR, which is then dephosphorylated and recycled to the cell surface competent to signal again. Like β2-AR, activated PAR1 is rapidly phosphorylated and uncoupled from signaling (9Ishii K. Hein L. Kobilka B. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9780-9786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Ishii K. Chen J. Ishii M. Koch W.J. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 27719-27726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Exchanging the cytoplasmic carboxyl tails of PAR1 and the substance P receptor, a classic GPCR that internalizes and recycles like β2-AR, switched their trafficking behaviors (12Trejo J. Hammes S.R. Coughlin S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13698-13702Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar,21Trejo J. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2216-2224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Moreover, PAR1 bearing the substance P receptor carboxyl tail displayed exaggerated and prolonged signaling responses to thrombin compared with wild-type PAR1. This was due to recycling and “resignaling” by the chimeric receptors (12Trejo J. Hammes S.R. Coughlin S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13698-13702Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 21Trejo J. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2216-2224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Thus sorting of activated PAR1 to lysosomes rather than recycling is critical for temporal fidelity of PAR1 signaling. The molecular mechanisms by which PAR1 is internalized and sorted to lysosomes remain largely unknown. β2-AR and other GPCRs internalize from the plasma membrane via clathrin-coated pits (16Goodman O.J.

The transferrin receptor (TfnR), which internalizes and recycles, utilizes a similar if not identical pathway that is dependent upon both clathrin and dynamin, a GTPase that regulates budding of coated pits (reviewed in Refs. 24Schmid S.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 511-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar and 25Schmid S.L. McNiven M.A. De Camilli P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 504-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). However, several GPCRs appear to internalize via a distinct non-dynamin dependent pathway (26Zhang J. Ferguson S.S.G.

Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 31-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). This raises the following questions. Is activated PAR1 first internalized via clathrin-coated pits like β2-AR and TfnR and only later sorted away from recycling receptors and delivered to lysosomes? Or does activated PAR1 internalize via a pathway distinct from that used for recycling receptors from the outset? In this study, we report that activated PAR1 colocalizes with TfnR in coated pits and is internalized via a pathway that is both dynamin- and clathrin-dependent. Blockade of PAR1 internalization with dominant-negative dynamin also inhibited PAR1 degradation. These results strongly suggest that activated PAR1 initially internalizes via the same clathrin-coated pits used by TfnR and is then sorted away from recycling receptors and delivered to lysosomes. Characterization of a mutant HeLa cell line revealed that at least one distinct gene product is required for internalization of activated PAR1 versusTfnR or β2-AR, implying that at least partially distinct mechanisms are responsible for recruiting PAR1 versusβ2-AR to clathrin-coated pits. Peptide agonist SFLLRN was synthesized as the carboxyl amide and purified by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography. Isoproterenol and doxycycline were from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Biotinylated human holo-transferrin, biocytin, avidin, poly-l-lysine, and fibronectin were from Sigma. Monoclonal anti-FLAG M1 antibody was from Sigma. Rabbit polyclonal 1809 antibody was generated against a peptide representing the hirudin-like sequence in PAR1's amino terminus (29Hung D.T. Vu T.K. Wheaton V.I. Ishii K. Coughlin S.R. J. Clin.

HeLa cells stably expressing the tetracycline-regulatable chimeric transcription factor (tetR-VP16) were generously provided by S. Schmid, Scripps Institute, La Jolla, CA. Cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 4.5 mg/ml glucose, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc., Grand Island, NY). A cDNA encoding clathrin hub fragment that contained an amino-terminal T7 epitope (MASMTGGQQMG) was also provided by F. Brodsky, University of California, San Francisco (31Liu S.H. Marks M.S. Brodsky F.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1023-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). A PAR1 cDNA containing prolactin signal sequence followed by a FLAG epitope sequence (DYKDDDD) was co-transfected with a plasmid encoding a hygromycin resistance gene; stable transfectants were selected in 250 μg/ml hygromycin and screened by surface antibody binding (32Hung D.T. Vu T.-K.H. Nelken N.A. Coughlin S.R. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 827-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Stable transfectants expressing human β2-AR containing an amino-terminal HA epitope sequence (YPYDVPDYA) were generated similarly. A mutant HeLa cell line designated JT1 expressing PAR1 was transfected with HA-tagged β2-AR together with a plasmid encoding a puromycin resistance gene and stable transfectants were selected in 2.5 μg/ml puromycin and screened by surface antibody binding as described above. Recombinant adenoviruses encoding wild-type and mutant K44A dynamin isoforms were generated and used to infect HeLa cells as described previously (33Altschuler Y. Barbas S.M. Terlecky L.J. Tang K. Hardy S. Mostov K.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1871-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Briefly, ∼15 plaque-forming units/cell of recombinant adenovirus was incubated with cells for 2 h at 37 °C in HEPES buffer. Cells were washed and incubated for an additional 18 h at 37 °C in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.05 ng/ml doxycycline. At this concentration of doxycycline, sufficient dominant-negative dynamin was expressed to inhibit TfnR internalization by 80% but cytotoxic effects were minimal. Approximately equal amounts of wild-type and mutant dynamins were expressed as determined by immunoblot using 12CA5 antibody (both wild-type and mutant dynamins contained an amino-terminal HA epitope (34Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar)). HeLa cells grown on fibronectin-coated glass coverslips (22 × 22 mm) were transiently transfected with 2 μg of DNA, 2 μl of LIPOFECTIN Reagent, and 25 μl of PLUS Reagent for 3 h at 37 °C according to the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). Following transfections, DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum was added and cells were incubated for an additional 48 h at 37 °C. To follow internalization, cells expressing FLAG-tagged PAR1 were plated in 24-well dishes (Falcon, Lincoln Park, NJ) and incubated with 1 μg/ml anti-FLAG M1 antibody for 1 h at 4 °C. Cells were washed and exposed to agonist at 37 °C for various times. Next, surface-bound antibody was removed by three washes with PBS, Ca2+- and Mg2+-free containing 0.04% EDTA for 5 min at 4 °C. In cells expressing recombinant dynamins, surface-bound antibody was removed by three sequential washes (15 min at 4 °C) in PBS containing 0.6% BSA and 0.15 m glycine, pH 2.5. Cells were lysed in 150 μl of Triton lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 3% BSA, and 1% Triton X-100) and intracellular antibody was measured by ELISA (18Shapiro M.J.

TfnR endocytosis was measured using a modification of a previously described procedure (34Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). Cells plated in 24-well dishes (Falcon) were washed and incubated in DMEM containing 1 mg/ml BSA and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, for 1.5 h at 37 °C to deplete cells of transferrin. Cells were incubated with 2 μg/ml human biotinylated transferrin for 1 h at 4 °C. Unbound biotinylated transferrin was removed and medium was exchanged with warmed DMEM/BSA/HEPES, pH 7.4. Cells were incubated for various times at 37 °C. Following incubations, cells were washed and surface-bound biotinylated transferrin was masked by incubation with 100 μg/ml avidin for 1 h at 4 °C followed by 100 μg/ml biocytin for 1 h at 4 °C. Cells were washed and lysed with 200 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 0.2% BSA, and 1% Triton X-100 (blocking buffer). Internalized biotinylated transferrin was measured by ELISA. Briefly, 96-well Primaria plates (Falcon) were coated with 0.5 μg of anti-human transferrin antibody overnight at 4 °C. Each well was washed, incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with blocking buffer. Lysates were added and plates incubated overnight at 4 °C. Plates were washed, incubated with blocking buffer for 5 min, and washed again. Each well was incubated with 0.5 μg/ml horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin for 1 h at room temperature, washed as described above, and incubated with 150 μl of horseradish peroxidase substrate one-step 2,2′-azino-bis-3-ethylbenz-thiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (Pierce). The OD of each well was read at 405 nm using a Molecular Devices Microplate Reader (Sunnyvale, CA). The amount of internalized biotinylated transferrin measured in cell lysates was within the linear range of the assay as assessed by direct application of biotinylated transferrin. β2-AR internalization was examined using a modification of a previously described cell surface ELISA (21Trejo J. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2216-2224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells stably transfected with β2-AR containing an amino-terminal HA epitope sequence were plated in 24-well dishes and incubated with 1 μg/ml 12CA5 antibody for 1 h at 4 °C. Cells were washed to remove unbound antibody, incubated for various times at 37 °C, and the amount of internalized β2-AR was determined as described. Cell lysates were prepared, processed, and immunoblotted as described previously (21Trejo J. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2216-2224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The amount of PAR1 protein was measured as above except that immunoblots were developed using Enhanced Chemiluminescence (ECL) PlusTM (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Arlington, IL) and quantitated using a Molecular Dynamics Storm imaging system (Sunnyvale, CA). Phosphorylation of PAR1 was determined essentially as described (21Trejo J. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2216-2224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Cells stably expressing PAR1 were grown on fibronectin-coated glass coverslips (22 × 22 mm) and incubated with anti-PAR1 1809 antiserum (1:500) for 1 h at 4 °C, washed, and exposed to agonist at 37 °C. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min at 4 °C, washed, and permeabilized with 100% methanol (−20 °C) for 30 s. After permeabilization, cells were washed three times with PBS (1% nonfat dry milk, 150 mm sodium acetate, pH 7) and washed again three times with PBS (1% nonfat dry milk) (blocking buffer). Cells were then incubated with either 5 μg/ml anti-HA 12CA5 antibody (dynamin expression) or 1 μg/ml anti-T7 antibody (clathrin hub expression) for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were then incubated with species-specific fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. After secondary antibody incubations, cells were washed four times with PBS, once with Molecular ProbesSlowFade equilibration buffer, and SlowFadeanti-fade reagent was added to each coverslip before mounting. Images were collected using a Nikon Microphot-FXA fluorescence microscope (Melville, NY) fitted with a Plan Apo ×40 objective and the final composite was created using Adobe Photoshop 5.0. Cells were grown on glass coverslips (22 × 22 mm) coated with 0.1 mg/ml poly-l-lysine. Cells were equilibrated in DMEM containing 1 mg/ml BSA and 10 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, for 1 h at 37 °C and incubated with or without agonist. Cells were then incubated with 3 μg/ml anti-FLAG M1 antibody or anti-PAR1 1809 (1:500) antibody for 1 h at 4 °C to label surface PAR1. TfnR was labeled with 4 μg/ml anti-TfnR B3/25 antibody for 1 h at 4 °C. Unbound antibody was removed and plasma membrane patches were ripped from cells as described previously (34Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar,35Sanan D.A. Anderson R.G. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1991; 39: 1017-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Isolated plasma membrane patches were fixed, permeabilized, and washed with blocking buffer as described above. For PAR1 and TfnR colocalization experiments, plasma membrane patches were incubated with species-specific fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. For clathrin colocalization studies, plasma membrane patches were first incubated with anti-clathrin antibody (1:1000) for 1 h, washed, and incubated with species-specific fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies for an additional 1 h at room temperature. Cells were washed four times with PBS, once with equilibration buffer, and SlowFade anti-fade reagent was added to each coverslip before mounting. Confocal images were collected using a Bio-Rad MRC-1024 laser scanning confocal system (Cambridge, MA) configured and with a Nikon Eclipse TE300 inverted microscope and a Plan Apo ×100 oil objective. Fluorescent images, 0.5-μm X-Y sections, were collected sequentially at 512 × 512 resolution with ×2 optical zoom and processed using LaserSharp software. The final composite image was created using Adobe Photoshop 5.0. Colocalization of PAR1 with clathrin or TfnR was quantitated by counting PAR1 containing puncta specifically associated with clathrin or TfnR immunoreactive puncta indicated by the yellow color in the merged image. The data are expressed as the percent of clathrin or TfnR containing puncta that co-stained for PAR1. Cells were plated in 12-well dishes (Falcon) and labeled overnight with 2 μCi/mlmyo-[3H]inositol in DMEM containing 1 mg/ml BSA. Cells were washed and treated as described in the legend to Fig.9, and the accumulation of inositol phosphates was measured as described previously (36Nanevicz T. Wang L. Chen M. Ishii M.

A, wild-type and mutant HeLa cells labeled with [32P]orthophosphate were incubated in the absence (Ctrl) or presence of 100 μm SFLLRN for 3 min at 37 °C. Receptor immunoprecipitates were prepared from lysates of equivalent numbers of cells and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography.

Accumulated [3H]inositol phosphates were measured as described under “Materials and Methods.” The data (mean ± S.D.; n = 3) are representative of two independent experiments. Basal [3H]inositol formation was 914 cpm/well (untransfected), 515 cpm/well (wild-type), and 1024 cpm/well (mutant). The initial levels of PAR1 surface expression were 0.5 for wild-type, 0.6 for mutant, and 0.01 for untransfected cells (arbitrary units).

Accordingly, we first asked whether PAR1 undergoes activation-dependent internalization and degradation in HeLa cells like it does in fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and megakaryocyte-like cells. PAR1 internalization was assayed by measuring uptake of receptor-bound antibody. HeLa cells stably transfected with PAR1 bearing a FLAG epitope at its amino terminus were incubated with the calcium-dependent M1 FLAG antibody for 60 min at 4 °C; under these conditions only receptors residing at the cell surface were labeled with antibody. Unbound antibody was removed and cells were incubated in the presence or absence of agonist at 37 °C for various times to allow internalization of receptor-bound antibody. After these incubations, bound antibody remaining on the cell surface was removed by washing with PBS/EDTA, cells were lysed, and internalized antibody was quantitated by ELISA. In untransfected cells, virtually no antibody was bound or internalized. In PAR1-expressing cells not exposed to agonist, ∼10% of antibody initially bound to the cell surface was internalized at steady state (Fig. 1 A,Ctrl), consistent with some tonic cycling of PAR1 between the cell surface and an intracellular compartment (18Shapiro M.J.

Studies examining agonist-induced decreases in receptor-bound antibody on the cell surface yielded similar results (data not shown). These findings strongly suggest that PAR1 undergoes agonist-triggered internalization in HeLa cells. Agonist-triggered internalization of PAR1 is phosphorylation-dependent in several fibroblast-like cell lines. HeLa cells stably expressing PAR1 labeled with [32P]orthophosphate were incubated in the presence or absence of agonist SFLLRN for 3 min at 37 °C, lysed, and then immunoprecipitated with anti-PAR1 1809 antibody (29Hung D.T.

Analysis of the immunoprecipitates by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography revealed agonist-triggered PAR1 phosphorylation in transfected HeLa cells (Fig.1 B). To determine whether PAR1 underwent activation-dependent degradation in HeLa cells, PAR1-expressing cells were incubated in the presence or absence of agonist for 90 min at 37 °C. The amount of PAR1 protein remaining was then measured by immunoblot of whole cell lysates (Figs. 1 C and 2). One major transfection-"

By using mRNA differential display technique, we show, herein, that estradiol-17β (E2) and its catechol metabolite 4-hydroxy-E2 (4OHE2) can modulate uterine gene expression in ERα(−/−) mice. Whereas administration of E2 or 4OHE2 rapidly up-regulated (4–8-fold) the expression of immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein (Bip), calpactin I (CalP), calmodulin (CalM), and Sik similar protein(Sik-SP) genes in ovariectomized wild-type or ERα(−/−) mice, the expression of secreted frizzled related protein-2 (SFRP-2) gene was down-regulated (4-fold).

The uterus is a primary target for various estrogenic responses during the cycle and pregnancy. In the mouse, estrogen induces uterine epithelial cell proliferation, and together with progesterone (P4)1 it directs stromal cell proliferation and epithelial cell differentiation. These coordinated estrogen and P4 interactions prepare the uterus to the receptive state for implantation (reviewed in Ref. 4Dey S.K. Adashi E.Y. Rock J.A. Rosenwaks Z. Reproductive Endocrinology, Surgery and Technology. Lippincott-Raven, New York1996: 421-434Google Scholar). The mechanism by which estrogen renders the P4-primed uterus receptive for implantation is not clearly understood.Estrogen actions are primarily executed by its binding to nuclear estrogen receptors, ERα and/or ERβ, which are ligand-inducible transcription factors (5Tsai M.J.

They modulate transcription of genes by virtue of their binding as hormone receptor complexes to specific DNA sequences (hormone response elements) in target promoters (5Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Annu.

Despite the classical estrogenic actions, there is increasing evidence that gene transactivation or modulation of cell functions by estrogens is also mediated independent of nuclear ERs (7Das S.K.

In many cells, a myriad of estrogenic effects occurs rapidly within seconds or minutes. These responses do not require RNA or protein synthesis and are considered to be mediated by estrogen binding to the plasma membrane (10Watson C.S. Gametchu B. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1999; 220: 9-19Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Lieberherr M. Grosse B. Kachkache M. Balsan S. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1993; 8: 1365-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 12Aronica S.M.

For example, increases in intracellular cAMP, calcium influx, inositol triphosphate, and release of prolactin are all attributed to membrane-mediated estrogen actions (10Watson C.S. Gametchu B. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1999; 220: 9-19Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Lieberherr M. Grosse B. Kachkache M. Balsan S. J. Bone Miner.

Nature. 1977; 265: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar), the subject is still controversial. However, the identity of a membrane ER has recently been addressed by transfection studies in Chinese hamster ovary cells using cDNAs for ERα or ERβ (14Razandi M. Pedram A. Green G.L. Levin E.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 307-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). It was shown that functionally active ERα or ERβ is localized in the plasma membrane and in the nucleus originating from the same mRNA transcript. Furthermore, the existence of a membrane estrogen-binding protein, maxi-K channel, has also been reported (15Valverde M.A. Rojas P. Amigo J. Cosmelli D. Orio P. Bahamonde M.I. Mann G.E. Vergara C. Latorre R. Science. 1999; 285: 1929-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). This channel consists of a regulatory subunit α that confers higher Ca2+ sensitivity and binds to estrogen for channel activation in the presence of a pore-forming β-subunit.There is a general consensus that rapid actions of estrogens, especially in tissues lacking nuclear ERs, are the result of a novel mechanism that involves estrogen interaction with a yet unidentified receptor (7Das S.K. Taylor J.A. Korach K.S. Paria B.C. Dey S.K. Lubahn D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12786-12791Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). By using ERα-deficient mice and an ER antagonist, we have previously demonstrated that 4-hydroxyestradiol-17β (4OHE2), a catechol metabolite of estradiol-17β (E2), can induce the expression of lactoferrin (LF, an estrogen-responsive gene) in uteri of ERα(−/−) mice (7Das S.K. Taylor J.A. Korach K.S. Paria B.C. Dey S.K. Lubahn D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12786-12791Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The result suggested that the response is not mediated by ERα or ERβ and points toward a novel pathway of estrogen actions in the mouse uterus. To better understand the estrogen actions independent of ERα and/or ERβ, we sought to identify genes that are targets of E2and/or 4OHE2. We used mRNA differential display to identify estrogen-responsive genes in ERα(−/−) uteri. Upon identification, the expression patterns of these genes were analyzed in wild-type and ERα(−/−) uteri exposed to estrogens in the presence or absence of an ER antagonist. Although mRNA expression of four of the genes, glucose-regulated protein-78 kDa (GRP78)/immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein (Bip), calpactin I (CalP), calmodulin (CalM), and SIK-similar protein (Sik-SP) was up-regulated, the expression of the secreted frizzled-related protein-2 (SFRP-2) was down-regulated in the uterus by E2 or 4OHE2 in both the wild-type and ERα(−/−) mice. We also observed that these estrogenic responses are not influenced by an ER antagonist ICI-182,780 (ICI), a protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (Cyhx), or progesterone, suggesting that these effects occur independent of ERα, ERβ, protein synthesis, or progesterone receptor (PR).Bip, a member of the HSP70 (chaperone) family and a major protein of the endoplasmic reticulum lumen, is induced under a variety of stress situations (16Lee A.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). It is involved in the storage of rapidly exchanging Ca2+ pool and correct folding of the newly synthesized proteins (17Drummond I.A. Lee A.S. Resendez E.J. Steinhardt R.A. J. Biol.

CalP and CalM, two calcium-binding proteins, are expressed ubiquitously in eukaryotic cells and participate in the modulation of several Ca2+-dependent functions including protein kinase, adenylate cyclase, and cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase activities (20Schulman H.

Our present results showing the influence of estrogen on uterine expression of genes that are involved in three fundamental cellular functions, such as protein processing, calcium homeostasis, and Wnt signaling independent of the classical ER or PR pathway, suggest diverse mode of estrogen actions.DISCUSSIONMany of the diverse biological functions of estrogens are the result of their direct interactions with nuclear ERs. There is now evidence for specific functions and gene expression in the target organs elicited by estrogens independent of ERα and/or ERβ (7Das S.K. Taylor J.A. Korach K.S. Paria B.C. Dey S.K. Lubahn D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12786-12791Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 44Das S.K. Tan J. Johnson D.C. Dey S.K. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 2905-2915Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). For example, 4OHE2, but not E2, can induce LF expression, water imbibition, and macromolecular uptake in ERα(−/−) uteri, and these responses are not neutralized by ICI (7Das S.K. Taylor J.A. Korach K.S. Paria B.C. Dey S.K. Lubahn D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12786-12791Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The signaling system involved in these responses is not yet understood. The present investigation demonstrates that not only 4OHE2 but also E2 can modulate a group of genes in the uterus that are involved in protein processing, calcium homeostasis, and Wnt signaling without involving classical ERs, PR, and nascent protein synthesis. These unique uterine estrogenic responses point toward the concept that certain fundamental estrogenic functions, such as protein processing, calcium homeostasis, and Wnt signaling in the target organ are retained in the absence of classical ERs. Whether orphan or yet unidentified nuclear receptors are involved in these responses remains unknown. Nonetheless, our present results are intriguing and likely to stimulate further research in identifying the signaling mechanism for these responses.Although there are numerous examples of estrogen up-regulation of various genes in the uterus, very few reports of estrogen-induced down-regulation of uterine gene expression are available. Our present results showing up-regulation of Bip, CalP, CalM, andSik-SP mRNAs and down-regulation of SFRP-2mRNA in the uterus by estrogens independent of classical ERs, PR, or protein synthesis are unique and suggest that estrogen actions are more complex than currently recognized. Although estrogen induction of these genes is independent of ERs, their differential cell-specific expression between the wild-type and ERα(−/−) uteri suggests an interaction between this novel pathway and classical ERs in specifying cell-specific expression. Epithelial-mesenchymal “cross-talk” is important for normal uterine functions and gene expression (48Lim H. Ma L. Ma W.-G. Maas R.L. Dey S.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1005-1017Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that this cross-talk is impaired or absent in ERα(−/−) uteri causing differential cell-specific gene expression.In adult mice, estrogens produce a biphasic uterine response (49Kirkland J.L. Gardner R.N. Ireland J.S. Stancel G.M. Endocrinology. 1977; 101: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 50Harris J. Gorski J. Endocrinology. 1978; 103: 204-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The immediate early responses occur within 6 h of estrogen administration, and water imbibition and macromolecular uptake are two predominant characteristics. The late or growth responses occur by 18–30 h and are characterized by hyperplasia and hypertrophy. Our present observation of rapid modulation of genes after injection of estrogens suggests that specific early estrogenic responses are independent of classical ERs or new protein synthesis. However, these early responses could be important for the onset of the late growth phase that is ERα-dependent. The manifestation of these early responses with the absence of the growth phase in ERα(−/−) mice suggests the lack of the machinery for the growth phase. The induction of immediate early genes (c-fos, c-jun,and c-myc) by short-acting estrogens is not adequate to stimulate DNA synthesis in the rodent uterus (51Persico E. Scalona M. Cicatiello L. Sica V. Bresciani F. Weisz A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 171: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that the mitogenic stimulation requires further changes that depend on prolonged estrogen action. A cross-talk between the non-classical and classical actions of steroid hormones is described by Katzenellenbogen (52Katzenellenbogen B.S. Biol. Reprod. 1996; 54: 287-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). For example, protein kinase activators enhance the ERα transcriptional activity. There is also evidence that IGF-1 and agents that raise intracellular cAMP also stimulate ER phosphorylation and activation (53Aronica S.M. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 743-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Estrogen activation of the traditional “genomic” pathway involves mRNA and protein synthesis, whereas rapid estrogenic responses occurring via a non-traditional pathway are believed to be mediated via membrane receptor and do not require new protein synthesis. However, the identity of the putative membrane receptor is still controversial. Our observations of rapid estrogenic modulation of uterine gene expression independent of protein synthesis and classical ERs are also characteristics of an early response. Defining the signaling mechanism of the early estrogenic responses may have clinical significance in distinguishing the beneficial effects (cardiovascular and neurological protections) of estrogens from their long term detrimental (carcinogenic consequences) effects.Rapid responsiveness of uterine Bip and Sik-SP to estrogens could be physiologically important. The late estrogen action primarily involves uterine growth which requires correct folding and functioning of a variety of newly synthesized proteins. Because of the involvement of Bip in folding and translocation of nascent proteins within the endoplasmic reticulum, one of the early functions of estrogen could be to prepare the uterine environment for protein processing for the late phase. A chaperone-like role for Bip was recently reported in the rat uterus during decidualization (54Simmons D.G. Kennedy T.G. Biol. Reprod. 2000; 62: 1168-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Sik-SP could also be involved in similar functions, because of its chaperone-like functions. We suggest that genes regulated by estrogen independent of nuclear ERs could be linked with the ER-dependent late estrogenic effects.Calcium plays a major role in mediating estrogen signaling (55Improta-Brears T. Whorton A.R. Codazzi F. York J.D. Meyer T. McDonnell D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4686-4691Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 56Picotto G. Massheimer V. Boland R. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 119: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and it can act as a second messenger to induce Bip in monocytes (57Jacquier-Sarlin M.R. Dreher D. Polla B.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 226: 166-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Cellular calcium homeostasis depends on the concerted efforts of calcium-binding proteins. Since Bip, CalP, and CalM all bind calcium and are regulated in the uterus by estrogen, it is possible that calcium is involved in regulating these genes. The spatiotemporal regulation of uterine Bip, CalP, and CalM by estrogen suggests that these genes function in a coordinated manner. In rodents, uterine CalM levels increase during pregnancy and after estrogen treatment (58Yoshida T. Shinyashiki K. Noda K. Tohoku J. Exp. Med. 1985; 145: 381-385Google Scholar). Furthermore, an intrauterine injection of CalM antagonist (chlorpromazine) inhibits implantation in the rat (59Yang R.Z. Xie X.Y. Sun H.Y. Zhao M.H. Qian S.Z. Contraception. 1998; 58: 315-320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar), suggesting its role in this process. Since estrogen is an absolute requirement for implantation in mice, it is possible that one of the actions of estrogen in implantation is to induce CalM via a non-ER pathway. CalP is localized in the syncytiotrophoblast cells in the developing human placenta and possesses Fc gamma receptor activity, suggesting its role in immunomodulation (60Jensen T.S. Matre R. APMIS. 1995; 103: 433-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Uterine CalP expression by estrogen may have a role in local immunomodulation.The uterine regulation of SFRP-2 is an interesting observation, since very few genes are known to be down-regulated by estrogen (61Das S.K. Chakraborty I. Paria B.C. Wang X.-N. Plowman G. Dey S.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 691-705Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 62Lammers C.H. D'Souza U. Qin Z.H. Lee S.H. Yajima S. Mouradian M.M. Synapse. 1999; 34: 222-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 63Cardone A. Angelini F. Varriale B. Gen. Comp.

To our knowledge, this is a gene that is abundantly expressed in quiescent uterine stromal cells but is down-regulated by estrogens. Since SFRP-2 negatively regulates Wnt functions, it is envisioned that its down-regulation by estrogen allows Wnt-frizzled signaling to execute specific uterine functions. Wnt ligands participate in mesenchymal-epithelial interactions (66Weber-Hall S.J. Phippard D.J. Niemeyer C.C. Dale T.C. Differentiation. 1994; 57: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), and uterine expression of Wnt ligands (Wnt-4, Wnt-5a, andWnt-7) is tightly regulated during the estrous cycle by estrogen and/or P4 (67Miller C. Pavlova A. Sassoon D.A. Mech. Dev. 1998; 76: 91-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 68Bui T.D. Zhang L. Rees M.C.P. Bicknell R. Harris A.L. Br. J. Cancer. 1997; 75: 1131-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Since Wnts regulate cellular proliferation, differentiation, and/or reorganization, we suggest that they act as estrogen-mediated transducers of these events in the uterus. Bip could also be a part of this system, since Wnt-1 interacts with Bip for its secretion from the cell (69Kitajewski J. Mason J.O. Varmus H.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 784-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Wnts are involved in two signaling pathways. They can activate β-catenin that modulates transcription of specific target genes in the nucleus. They can also stimulate increases in intracellular Ca2+ or protein kinase C activity via activation of pertussis toxin-sensitive G-proteins. Whether these Wnt signaling pathways are operative in the uterus remains to be examined. Estrogens regulate diverse physiological responses including normal functioning of the reproductive and cardiovascular systems and bone metabolism (1Couse J.F. Korach K.S. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 358-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 2Stampfer M.J. Willett W.C. Colditz G.A. Rosner B. Speizer F.E. Hennekens C.H. N. Engl. J.

The uterus is a primary target for various estrogenic responses during the cycle and pregnancy. In the mouse, estrogen induces uterine epithelial cell proliferation, and together with progesterone (P4)1 it directs stromal cell proliferation and epithelial cell differentiation. These coordinated estrogen and P4 interactions prepare the uterus to the receptive state for implantation (reviewed in Ref. 4Dey S.K. Adashi E.Y. Rock J.A. Rosenwaks Z. Reproductive Endocrinology, Surgery and Technology. Lippincott-Raven, New York1996: 421-434Google Scholar). The mechanism by which estrogen renders the P4-primed uterus receptive for implantation is not clearly understood. Estrogen actions are primarily executed by its binding to nuclear estrogen receptors, ERα and/or ERβ, which are ligand-inducible transcription factors (5Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 451-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (2678) Google Scholar, 6Beato M. Herrlich P. Schultz G. Cell. 1995; 83: 851-857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1630) Google Scholar). They modulate transcription of genes by virtue of their binding as hormone receptor complexes to specific DNA sequences (hormone response elements) in target promoters (5Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 451-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (2678) Google Scholar, 6Beato M. Herrlich P. Schultz G. Cell. 1995; 83: 851-857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1630) Google Scholar). Despite the classical estrogenic actions, there is increasing evidence that gene transactivation or modulation of cell functions by estrogens is also mediated independent of nuclear ERs (7Das S.K. Taylor J.A. Korach K.S. Paria B.C. Dey S.K. Lubahn D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12786-12791Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 8Kelly M.J. Wagner E.J. Trends Endocrinol.

In many cells, a myriad of estrogenic effects occurs rapidly within seconds or minutes. These responses do not require RNA or protein synthesis and are considered to be mediated by estrogen binding to the plasma membrane (10Watson C.S. Gametchu B. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1999; 220: 9-19Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Lieberherr M. Grosse B. Kachkache M. Balsan S. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1993; 8: 1365-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 12Aronica S.M. Kraus W.L. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8517-8521Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). For example, increases in intracellular cAMP, calcium influx, inositol triphosphate, and release of prolactin are all attributed to membrane-mediated estrogen actions (10Watson C.S. Gametchu B. Proc.

The adult blood-feeding stage of this nematode parasite is responsible for nearly all of the clinically relevant sequelae of infection, most of which are directly attributable to gastrointestinal hemorrhage (4Layrisse M.

Using specialized teeth or cutting plates, the adult worm attaches to the intestinal mucosa, lacerating capillaries in the superficial mucosa and sucking blood into its buccal capsule (6Carroll S.M.

Chronic gastrointestinal blood loss at or near the site of attachment leads to iron deficiency anemia and protein malnutrition, which over time may cause growth retardation, cognitive impairment, and even death (2Keymer A.

Pathol. 1946; 22: 1081-1100PubMed Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that adult hookworms produce a number of substances that potentially aid in host invasion and/or parasite survival, thus contributing directly or indirectly to the pathogenesis of hookworm anemia (11Hotez P.J.

Molecular Approaches to Parasitology. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1995Google Scholar). Most of these so-called “virulence factors” have been isolated from the canine hookwormAncylostoma caninum, including the two major anticoagulant serine protease inhibitors from the adult blood-feeding stage. These related compounds, called A. caninum anticoagulant peptides 5 and 2, inhibit the proteolytic activities of coagulation factor Xa and the factor VIIa-tissue factor complex, respectively (13Cappello M.

Other bioactive molecules isolated from A. caninuminclude a hyaluronidase (15Hotez P.J. Cappello M. Hawdon J.M. Beckers C. Sakanari J. J. Infect.

In contrast to the canine hookworm, very little is known about comparable inhibitory activities in hookworm species that routinely infect humans. Ancylostoma ceylanicum is a hookworm species capable of completing its natural life cycle in a number of mammalian hosts, including humans, dogs, cats, and hamsters (19Chowdurry A.B. Schad G.A. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1972; 21: 300-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 20Carroll S.M. Grove D.I. Trop. Geogr. Med. 1986; 38: 38-45PubMed Google Scholar, 21Carroll S.M. Grove D.I. J. Infect. Dis. 1984; 150: 284-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Although not as prevalent worldwide as Ancylostoma duodenale orNecator americanus, A. ceylanicum has been reported to cause anemia in parts of India and Southeast Asia (19Chowdurry A.B. Schad G.A. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1972; 21: 300-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Using a combined molecular and biochemical approach, we have identified and characterized a novel Kunitz type serine protease inhibitor fromA. ceylanicum that blocks the activity of chymotrypsin, pancreatic elastase, neutrophil elastase, and trypsin. The inhibitory spectrum of A. ceylanicum Kunitz type inhibitor 1 (AceKI-1)1 is unique among all previously characterized members of the Kunitz family of serine protease inhibitors. Based on its broad biologic activity, this multifunctional inhibitor may play an important role in parasite survival within the intestine and thus contribute to the pathogenesis of hookworm anemia. The identification of AceKI-1, the first serine protease inhibitor isolated from a major human hookworm, represents an important step in the characterization of the molecular mechanisms of parasite survival within the human host. Ultimately, AceKI-1 may serve as a potential molecular target in an overall strategy aimed at interfering with the worm's ability to survive within the intestine, thereby limiting the duration of infection and reducing the cumulative effect of chronic blood loss. Infective third stage (L3) A. ceylanicum larvae (22Hawdon J.M. Volk S.W. Rose R. Pritchard D.I. Behnke J.M. Schad G.A.

Parasitol. 1992; 78: 1036-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) were generously provided by John Hawdon and Peter Hotez at The Yale University School of Medicine, and the parasite life cycle was maintained as described previously (24Garside P. Behnke J.M. Parasitology. 1989; 98: 283-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Three-week-old Syrian hamsters (LVG strain) were infected orally by gavage with 100–150 L3 per animal. At 21–28 days postinfection, the hamsters were euthanized, and the live adult hookworms were harvested manually from the intestinal mucosa. AdultA. caninum were obtained from the intestines of laboratory-infected dogs using a similar protocol (18Chadderdon R.C. Cappello M. J. Infect. Dis. 1999; 179: 1235-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 25Schad G.A. Exp. Parasitol. 1979; 47: 246-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Soluble protein extracts of adult hookworms were prepared by manually homogenizing adult worms in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, using a glass homogenizer (26Cappello M. Clyne L.P. McPhedran P. Hotez P.J. J. Infect. Dis. 1993; 167: 1474-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Soluble protein extracts, which represented the starting material for the purification and characterization of AceKI-1, were obtained by centrifugation at 10,000 ×g. Protein concentrations of each lot of hookworm extracts were determined using the BCA reagent from Pierce. Extracts of infective larval stage (L3) hookworms cultured from the feces of infected hamsters (24Garside P. Behnke J.M. Parasitology. 1989; 98: 283-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) were prepared similarly to the adult extracts. Adult hookworm excretory/secretory (ES) products were prepared by incubating live, freshly harvested adult worms in RPMI media with hamster serum (5% v/v) for 16 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2 (18Chadderdon R.C. Cappello M. J. Infect. Dis. 1999; 179: 1235-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The worms were removed, and the ES products were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 ×g prior to use. Fifty live adult A. ceylanicum were suspended in 1.0 ml of Trizol (Life Technologies, Inc.), and total RNA was isolated according to the manufacturer's protocol. The RNA pellet was washed with 75 and 100% ethanol, air-dried for 10 min, and resuspended in 40 μl of diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of total adultA. ceylanicum RNA was utilized to amplify A. ceylanicum cDNA (27Rico-Hesse R. Harrison L.M. Salas R.A. Tovar D. Nisalak A. Ramos C. Boshell J. de Mesa M.T. Nogueira R.M. da Rosa A.T. Virology. 1997; 230: 244-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). All primers (Fig. 1) were synthesized by the William Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory at Yale University School of Medicine. First strand cDNA was synthesized by incubating approximately 1 μg of total RNA, 10 mmdithiothreitol, and 100 ng (final concentration approximately 2 μm) of the degenerate antisense strand primer 3′-CKDGFYRD in first strand reaction buffer (final concentration 50 mmTris-HCl, 75 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, pH 8.3) (Life Technologies). The degenerate primer 3′-CKDGFYRD was based on a conserved amino acid sequence located near the carboxyl terminus of a family of serine protease inhibitors previously identified from the hookworm A. caninum (14Stanssens P.

The solution was heated for 90 s at 90 °C and cooled on ice. Each of four deoxynucleotides (final concentration 1 mm; dATP, dCTP, dGTP, dTTP; New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) was added along with 40 units of RNasin (Promega, Madison, WI) and 200 units of reverse transcriptase enzyme (Superscript II; Life Technologies). This mixture was incubated for 1 h at 42 °C and cooled on ice. The entire first strand cDNA mixture was combined with PCR primers 5′-SLXHO and 3′-CKDGFYRD (100 ng each), reaction buffer (final concentration 10 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, pH 8.3), and 1 mm (final concentration) of each of the deoxynucleotides. The sense strand primer 5′-SLXHO corresponds to the nematode spliced leader, a conserved 22-nucleotide sequence present at the 5′-end of many nematode mRNAs (31Krause M. Hirsh D. Cell. 1987; 49: 753-761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar, 32Bektesh S. Van Doren K. Hirsh D.

The reaction mixture was brought to a 49-μl total volume with diethyl pyrocarbonate water. Taq polymerase enzyme (5 units; Perkin-Elmer) was then added, and samples were placed in a thermal cycler (PCR Sprint; Hybaid, Middlesex, United Kingdom) for 40 cycles (94 °C for 15 s of denaturation, 55 °C for 5 s of annealing, and 72 °C for 30 s of extension). The reaction mixture was subjected to 1% agarose gel electrophoresis, and the PCR products were visualized by ethidium bromide staining. The resulting PCR products were ligated into the pCR2.1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) cloning vector by incubating 10 ng of PCR product, 50 ng of pCR 2.1 vector, T4 DNA ligase, and ligation buffer overnight at 14 °C. One Shot E. coli INVαF′ cells (Invitrogen) were transformed with the ligation product as per the manufacturer's protocol. Samples were plated onto LB agar plates containing 30 μg/ml kanamycin (Life Technologies) and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) (Life Technologies) and incubated for 12–14 h at 37 °C. White appearing colonies that grew on the selective media were screened for the appropriate sized insert by direct colony PCR using vector-specific primers (T7 Promoter, M13 Reverse), and by restriction enzyme digest (EcoRI; New England Biolabs) of isolated plasmid DNA. Miniprep plasmid DNA (Spin Miniprep Kit; QIAGEN, Valencia, CA) from positive colonies was sent to the Keck Foundation Laboratory at Yale for nucleotide sequencing. The partial cDNA sequence obtained above was then used to design a nondegenerate internal primer (5′-KUNITZ1A, Fig.1) in order to isolate the remainder of the AceKI-1 cDNA using a 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends protocol (34Schaefer B.C. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 227: 255-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). First strand cDNA was amplified by RT-PCR, as above, using 1 μg of total RNA and an antisense primer, 3′-TTTT. The amplified cDNA mixture was then used as template for PCR with the primers 3′-TTTT and 5′-KUNITZ1A. cDNA and translated protein sequences were analyzed for homology to other known genes and proteins using the BLAST algorithm through the National Center for Biotechnology Information (available on the World Wide Web). The translated full-length amino acid sequence of AceKI-1 was analyzed using the SignalP Program for prediction of signal sequence cleavage sites (available on the World Wide Web) (35Von Heijne G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4683-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (3692) Google Scholar, 36Nielson H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref Scopus (4923) Google Scholar). In order to produce recombinant protein, the AceKI-1 cDNA corresponding to the predicted mature protein sequence was cloned into the pET 28a prokaryotic expression vector (Novagen, Madison, WI). The ligated pET28a plasmid containing the AceKI-1 cDNA was transformed into ultracompetent E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and samples were plated onto LB/kanamycin plates and incubated for 12–16 h at 37 °C. Colonies were screened for the appropriate sized insert by direct colony PCR using a 5′ vector-specific primer (T7 Promoter) and a 3′ AceKI-1-specific primer (3′-ACEKIXHO), as well as by restriction enzyme digest of plasmid DNA. Isolated plasmid DNA from rAceKI-1-positive clones was subcloned intoE. coli strain BL21(DE3) pLysS cells (Stratagene) for optimization of expression. Cells were plated onto LB/kanamycin plates, and individual colonies were screened by PCR for the presence of AceKI-1 cDNA. A single colony of transformed BL21(DE3) pLysS E. colicontaining the rAceKI-1:pET28a construct was incubated with shaking in LB/kanamycin medium, and protein expression by the log phase culture (A600 = 0.6–1.0) was induced by the addition of 1 mm (final concentration) isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Labscientific Inc., Livingston, NJ). The time course of rAceKI-1 expression was followed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (37Schagger H von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10456) Google Scholar) with Coomassie staining and Western blotting of aliquots at 1–4 h postinduction. The antibody used for detection of rAceKI-1 is a horseradish peroxidase-labeled monoclonal antibody raised against the T7 epitope present in the pET 28a N-terminal fusion tag (Novagen). For large scale purification of recombinant protein, a 2-liter culture of log phase BL21(DE3) pLysS cells containing the pET28a:rAceKI-1 construct was induced as above with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. At 3 h postinduction, the cells were harvested and resuspended in one-tenth the original culture volume of binding buffer (5 mmimidazole, 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9). The solution was sonicated and centrifuged at 13,000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C to separate soluble and insoluble fractions. The soluble supernatant from the induced cell lysate was applied to a Hi-Trap chelating Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (5-ml bed volume) charged with 50 mmNi2SO4 at 25 °C and equilibrated with binding buffer. The column was washed with binding buffer containing 60 mm imidazole, and the bound protein eluted with buffer containing 1 m imidazole. Following affinity chromatography, the partially purified recombinant protein was subjected to reverse-phase HPLC using a C18 column (Vydac, Hesperia, CA). The bound protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 0–60% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Individual peaks of protein as detected by absorbance at 214 nm were collected and assayed for serine protease inhibitory activity as described below. Following rpHPLC, the purified rAceKI-1 was subjected to electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (38Stone K.L. DeAngelis R. LoPresti M. Jones J. Papov V. Williams K. Electrophoresis. 1997; 19: 1046-1052Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar), using a Micromass Q-Tof mass spectrometer, by the Keck Foundation Laboratory at Yale. Quantitative amino acid analysis was utilized to determine the molar concentration (39Stone K.L. McNulty D.E. LoPresti M.L. Crawford J.M. DeAngelis R. Williams K.R. Techniques in Protein Chemistry III. Academic Press, Inc., New York1992Google Scholar) of rpHPLC-purified rAceKI-1. Single stage chromogenic kinetic assays were used to characterize the inhibitory activity of r-AceKI-1 against six serine proteases (13Cappello M. Vlasuk G.P. Bergum P. Huang S. Hotez P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6152-6156Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 40Cappello M. Li S. Chen X. Li C.B. Harrison L. Beard C.B. Aksoy S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14290-14295Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). rAceKI-1 was preincubated with each of the enzymes listed below for 15 min at 25 °C followed by the addition of the appropriate chromogenic substrate. In a total volume of 200 μl in individual wells of a 96-well microtiter plate, the concentrations (expressed as final concentrations) of enzyme/substrate were as follows: porcine pancreatic elastase (1.5 nm; Sigma Aldrich)/Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Ala-p-nitroanilide (250 μm; Bachem, Torrence, CA); human neutrophil elastase (7.5 nm; Calbiochem)/elastase substrate 1 (250 μm; Calbiochem); bovine pancreatic α−chymotrypsin (3 nm; Sigma)/Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide (200 μm; Bachem); bovine pancreatic trypsin (4 nm; Sigma)/S2302 (250 μm; DiaPharma, West Chester, OH); human coagulation factor Xa (1.0 nm; Enzyme Research Laboratories, South Bend, IN)/S2765 (250 μm; DiaPharma); human α−thrombin (1.0 nm; Enzyme Research Laboratories)/S2238 (250 μm; DiaPharma). Absorbance changes at 405 nm were monitored over 5 min using a kinetic microplate reader (MRX HD; Dynex Laboratories, Chantilly, VA). Preliminary results were expressed as percentage of inhibition of rAceKI-1 activity using the following formula: percentage of inhibition = (1 − inhibited rate/uninhibited rate) × 100 (13Cappello M. Vlasuk G.P. Bergum P. Huang S. Hotez P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6152-6156Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 40Cappello M. Li S. Chen X. Li C.B. Harrison L. Beard C.B. Aksoy S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14290-14295Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The reaction rates were computed by the microplate reader software. A more detailed kinetic analysis was performed as follows to obtain apparent inhibition constants, Ki* (41Williams J.W. Morrison J.F. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 437-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 42Morrison J.F. Walsh C.T. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1988; 61: 201-300PubMed Google Scholar). In each microtiter well, varying rAceKI-1 concentrations were incubated for 15 min with a fixed enzyme concentration, as above. Following the addition of the appropriate chromogenic substrate, the changes in absorbance were monitored at 405 nm. This assay was repeated using increasing amounts of inhibitor and the ratio of inhibited velocity (Vi) to uninhibited velocity (Vo) was plotted against the corresponding rAceKI-1 concentration. All experiments were performed in triplicate. The raw experimental data (absorbance versus time) were analyzed using the computer program PlateKi version 1.02 (BioKin Ltd., Madison, WI; available on the World Wide Web). To determine the initial reaction velocities, the program fits reaction progress curves either to a straight line or to the quadratic parabola using an automatic model selection procedure, based on the sequential modified givens orthogonal transformation method (43Lawson C. Hanson R. Solving Least-Squares Problems. Prentice-Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ1974Google Scholar). In the second stage of the analysis, the program uses an automatic algorithm described recently (44Kuzmic̆ P. Sideris S. Cregar L. Elrod K. Rice K.D. Janc J.W. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 281: 62-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) to fit the initial velocities to the Morrison equation (Equation1) to determine the apparent inhibition constantsKi*.V=Vo[E]−[I]−Ki*+([E]−[I]−Ki*)2+4Ki*[E]2[E](Eq. 1) To ascertain the influence of substrate concentration on the apparent inhibition constant, the Ki* measurements were repeated at substrate concentrations ranging from 0.2 to 10.0 × Km. Assuming the competitive mechanism of inhibition, the true inhibition constants were computed from the apparent inhibition constant using the formula Ki =Ki*/(1 + [S]/Km) (45Delaria K.A. Muller D.K.

Soluble extracts from 200 adult A. ceylanicum were applied to a 300 × 7.5-mm size exclusion chromatography column (Bio-Sil TSK-125; Bio-Rad) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 mNaCl. Individual fractions were tested for serine protease inhibitory activity, as described above, and active fractions were pooled. The molecular mass of the presumed native AceKI-1 was estimated by extrapolation from a standard curve constructed from the elution profile of a mixture of protein standards (Bio-Rad) with known molecular masses (18Chadderdon R.C. Cappello M. J. Infect. Dis. 1999; 179: 1235-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Following size exclusion chromatography, the pooled active fractions were subjected to reverse-phase HPLC using a C18 column (Vydac; Hesperia, CA). The bound protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 0–60% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Individual peaks of protein as detected by absorbance at 214 nm were collected and assayed for serine protease inhibitory activity. The molecular mass of the rpHPLC-purified native AceKI-1 was determined by the Keck Foundation Laboratory at Yale using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectroscopy (MALDI-MS) with a VG TOFspec SE instrument (46Williams K.R. Samandar S.M. Stone K.L. Saylor M. Rush J. The Protein Protocols Handbook. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1996Google Scholar). In order to confirm that the purified native inhibitor was identical to the protein encoded by the AceKI-1 cDNA, a sample was sent to the Keck Facility for NH2-terminal amino acid sequencing using an Applied Biosystems sequencer equipped with an on-line HPLC system (39Stone K.L. McNulty D.E. LoPresti M.L. Crawford J.M. DeAngelis R. Williams K.R. Techniques in Protein Chemistry III. Academic Press, Inc., New York1992Google Scholar). A partial cDNA corresponding to AceKI-1 was initially amplified from adult A. ceylanicum RNA using RT-PCR. This 250-base pair partial cDNA contained the nematode spliced leader sequence and the 5′ ATG initiation codon but not the 3′ poly(A) tail. The remainder of the AceKI-1 cDNA was subsequently amplified from adult A. ceylanicum RNA using a combination of RT-PCR and 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends. This yielded a 300-base pair fragment that contained identical overlapping sequence with the initial cDNA clone. The full-length AceKI-1 cDNA contains an open reading frame of 252 nucleotides, corresponding to a translated protein of 84 amino acids (Fig. 2). Analysis using the SignalP program predicted a 16-amino acid secretory signal sequence, indicating cleavage of the protein between residues Cys16 and Ala17 of the translated full-length AceKI-1 clone. Based on this cleavage site, the translated sequence of the AceKI-1 cDNA predicts a mature protein of 68 amino acids with a molecular mass of 7889 Da and a pI of 6.79. The cDNA fragment corresponding to the mature 68-amino acid AceKI-1 was cloned in-frame into the pET28a prokaryotic expression vector. Induced cell lysates were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting using a monoclonal antibody against the pET28a fusion protein T7 tag. Although minimal protein expression was detected by Coomassie staining, Western blotting confirmed the presence of the rAceKI-1 fusion protein in the soluble fraction (not shown). The rAceKI-1 was purified from induced cell lysates using nickel resin affinity chromatography, followed by rpHPLC. The bound protein was eluted from the C18 rpHPLC column under a linear gradient of 0–60% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (Fig.3 A). Samples from individual peaks were tested for serine protease inhibition. Based on characterization of inhibitory activity, the rAceKI-1 eluted at an acetonitrile concentration of approximately 26%. Electrospray mass spectrometry determined that the molecular mass of rAceKI-1 following rpHPLC is 11,293 Da (Fig. 3 B). This compares to a predicted molecular mass of 11,451 daltons (mature protein (7889 Da) + fusion tag (3562 Da)), a difference of 158 Da or 1.4%. Based on quantitative amino acid analysis of the rpHPLC-purified protein, it is estimated that each liter of induced E. coli yielded approximately 0.5–1 mg of purified recombinant protein. The selectivity of rAceKI-1 was examined against 6 serine proteases, and inhibitory activity was demonstrated against chymotrypsin, pancreatic elastase, neutrophil elastase, and trypsin. At a molar ratio of 2:1 (inhibitor/enzyme), there was no detectable inhibition of the human coagulation serine proteases factor Xa or thrombin. A single stage chromogenic assay was used to measure the rate of enzyme hydrolysis of chromogenic substrate in the presence of increasing concentrations of rAceKI-1. Preliminary results of these kinetic assays showed that rAceKI-1 is a “tight binding” (41Williams J.W. Morrison J.F. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 437-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar"

Hence, agonist-induced desensitization of the δ-opioid receptor has been suggested to be via the receptor phosphorylation, arrestin-mediated pathway. However, due to the highly efficient coupling between the δ-opioid receptor and the adenylyl cyclase, the direct correlation between the rates of receptor phosphorylation and receptor desensitization as measured by the adenylyl cyclase activity could not be established. In the current studies, using an ecdysone-inducible expression system to control the δ-opioid receptor levels in HEK293 cells, we could demonstrate that the rate of deltorphin II-induced receptor desensitization is dependent on the receptor level. Only at receptor concentrations ≤90 fmol/mg of protein were rapid desensitizations (t 12 <10 min) observed. Apparently, deltorphin II-induced receptor desensitization involves cellular events in addition to receptor phosphorylation. Mutation of Ser363 in the carboxyl tail of the δ-opioid receptor to Ala completely abolished the deltorphin II-induced receptor phosphorylation but not the desensitization response. Although the magnitude of desensitization was attenuated, the rate of deltorphin II-induced receptor desensitization remained the same in the S363A mutant as compared with wild type. Also, the S363A mutant could internalize in the presence of deltorphin II. Only when the agonist-induced clathrin-coated pit-mediated receptor internalization was blocked by 0.4 m sucrose that the deltorphin II-induced receptor desensitization was abolished in the S363A mutant. Similarly, 0.4 m sucrose could partially block the agonist-induced rapid desensitization in HEK293 cells expressing the wild type δ-opioid receptor.

G protein-coupled receptors G protein-coupled receptor kinases [d-Pen2,5]enkephalin fluorescence-activated cell sorter ponasterone A hemagglutinin Within the proposed model by Lefkowitz and co-workers (1Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18677-18680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar) for G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR),1 the step that initiates receptor desensitization involves the phosphorylation of the receptor by protein kinases including the G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs), thereby promoting the recruitment of the cellular protein arrestin. Association of arrestin with the receptor enhances the uncoupling of the receptor from the respective G protein, thus blunting the signal transduction processes resulting in the receptor desensitization. The association of arrestin also appears to be critical in the agonist-induced, clathrin-coated vesicle-mediated receptor internalization (2Zhang J. Barak L.S. Winkler K.E. Caron M.G. Ferguson S.S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27005-27014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Arrestin also serves as an adaptor molecule in the β2-adrenergic receptor signaling such that a receptor-src kinase complex is formed through which activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases Erk-1 and Erk-2 (Erk1/2) by the β2-adrenergic agonist is accomplished (3Luttrell L.M. Ferguson S.S.G. Daaka Y. Miller W.E. Maudsley S. Della Rocca G.J. Lin F.T. Kawakatsu H. Owada K. Luttrell D.K. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1999; 283: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (1251) Google Scholar). Subsequent phosphorylation of GRKs and arrestin by the Erk1/2 serves as the feedback regulation of the activities of these proteins in the GPCRs signals transduction pathways (4Lin F.T. Miller W.E.

There appears to be a casual relationship between the δ-opioid receptor phosphorylation and desensitization. Pei et al. (6Pei G. Kieffer B.L. Lefkowitz R.J. Freedman N.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 173-177PubMed Google Scholar) reported that the agonist DPDPE-induced receptor phosphorylation could be potentiated by the co-expression of the GRK5 and was attenuated by the dominant negative GRK mutant. In the same study, the dominant negative GRK mutant blocked the DPDPE-induced receptor desensitization. Likewise, overexpression of GRK2 and arrestin in HEK293 cells could accelerate the DPDPE-induced δ-opioid receptor desensitization (7El Kouhen R. Maestri-El Kouhen O. Law P.Y. Loh H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9207-9215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Mutation of the last 4 Thr and Ser residues at the carboxyl tail of the receptor resulted in blockade of the GRK and arrestin-mediated desensitization in the Xenopus oocytes expressing the δ-opioid receptor (8Koover A. Nappey V. Kieffer B.L. Chavkin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27605-27611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Overexpression of β-arrestin 1 alone resulted in the attenuation of the δ-opioid receptor activity (9Cheng Z.J., Yu, Q.M. Wu Y.L . Ma L. Pei G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24328-24333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The desensitization of the endogenous δ-opioid receptor in the human neuroblastoma SK-N-BE cells was reported to correlate with the phosphorylation of the receptor (10Hasbi A. Polastron J. Allouche S. Stanasila L. Massotte D. Jauzac P. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2129-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). These studies supported the hypothesis of receptor phosphorylation as the mechanism for δ-opioid receptor desensitization.However, the δ-opioid receptor lacking the C-terminal 31 amino acids, the sites for agonist-induced phosphorylation, can be rapidly desensitized by pretreating the CHO cells with DPDPE for 10 min (11Wang C. Zhou D. Cheng Z. Wei Q. Chen J. Li G. Pei G. Chi Z. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The truncation of the δ-opioid receptor after Thr344 in the carboxyl tail domain of the receptor also resulted in the complete blockade of agonist-induced receptor phosphorylation in the HEK293 cells but not in the attenuation of the receptor internalization (12Murray S.R. Evans C.J. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24987-24991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). These studies suggested that the putative arrestin-mediated events, the agonist-induced δ-opioid receptor desensitization and internalization, could occur in the absence of the agonist-induced receptor phosphorylation.In order to reconcile the reported observations, the role of receptor phosphorylation in the δ-opioid receptor desensitization must be clearly defined. There should be a direct correlation between the ability of the agonist to induce receptor phosphorylation and rapid desensitization. In a recent report, we have determined that the failure to correlate μ-opioid agonist-induced receptor desensitization, as measured by the regulation of adenylyl cyclase activity, was due to the rapid recycling and resensitization of the receptor (13Law P.Y. Erickson L.J. El-Kouhen R. Dicker L. Solberg J. Wang W. Miller E. Burd A.L. Loh H.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 388-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The rate of the receptor desensitization also appeared to be dependent on the receptor level expressed on the cell surface. Since the δ-opioid receptor is highly efficiently coupled to the adenylyl cyclase (14Fantozzi R. Mullikin-Kilpatrick D. Blume A.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1981; 20: 8-15PubMed Google Scholar), the discrepancy in correlating the agonist-induced receptor phosphorylation and desensitization could stem from the presence of high receptor level expressed at the cell surface. Thus, the current studies were carried out to examine the role of receptor level in the δ-opioid agonist-induced receptor desensitization. By using the ecdysone-inducible expression system to control the expression of δ-opioid receptor in HEK293 cells, we could demonstrate a direct correlation between the receptor levels and the rates of agonist-induced receptor desensitization. Furthermore, we could demonstrate that the mechanism for agonist-induced rapid desensitization of the δ-opioid receptor involved both the phosphorylation and the agonist-induced internalization of the receptor.RESULTSAs with most GPCR, opioid receptor is rapidly phosphorylated upon the binding of the agonists (6Pei G. Kieffer B.L. Lefkowitz R.J. Freedman N.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 173-177PubMed Google Scholar, 7El Kouhen R. Maestri-El Kouhen O. Law P.Y. Loh H.H. J. Biol.

Though the rate of δ-opioid receptor desensitization, as measured by the regulation of adenylyl cyclase activity, was faster than that of the μ-opioid receptor, the rate of opioid receptor desensitization did not correlate with that of receptor phosphorylation (7El Kouhen R. Maestri-El Kouhen O. Law P.Y. Loh H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9207-9215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The discrepancy between the rates for receptor phosphorylation and desensitization could be explained partially by the high level of receptor being expressed (13Law P.Y. Erickson L.J. El-Kouhen R. Dicker L. Solberg J. Wang W. Miller E. Burd A.L. Loh H.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 388-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The percentage of the receptor on the cell surface that was not phosphorylated was sufficiently high enough to maintain the agonist activity during the short term agonist treatment. Only when the μ-opioid receptor level at the cell surface was relatively low (<50 fmol/mg protein) and the recycling of the receptor was blocked by monensin, then the rapid desensitization (in minutes) of the μ-opioid receptor was observed (13Law P.Y.

Since the coupling of δ-opioid receptor to adenylyl cyclase is highly efficient (14Fantozzi R. Mullikin-Kilpatrick D. Blume A.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1981; 20: 8-15PubMed Google Scholar), it is probable that the overexpression of the receptor is the reason for the failure to correlate the rates of δ-opioid receptor rapid desensitization and receptor phosphorylation (7El Kouhen R. Maestri-El Kouhen O. Law P.Y. Loh H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9207-9215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar).In order to control the δ-opioid receptor level expressed on the cell surface and also eliminate any probable artifact due to position expression, the ecdysone-inducible system was used in current studies. The advantage of this system is that the insect steroid hormone analog, ponasterone A (PA), has been reported to induce the gene of interest 200-fold with no measurable effect on the mammalian cell physiology (19No D. Yao T.P. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3346-3351Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar). Thus, the DORTAG and the Ser363mutant of DORTAG (DORTAGS363A) were subcloned into the pINDsp1 vector containing the hybrid ecdysone response element (E/GRE) with multiple SP1 elements and transfected into HEK293 cells (EcR-293) expressing the heterotrimeric ecdysone receptor (VgEcR) and the retinoid X receptor. The EcR-293 cells surviving the G418 and zeocin selection should be those cells that the levels of DORTAG or DORTAGS363A are under the control of PA. As shown in Fig. 1, we identified the EcR-293 clones that exhibited PA concentration-dependent expression of the δ-opioid receptor and the receptor mutant. The PA induction was carried out for 48 h because time-dependent studies indicated that maximal induction was achieved 36 h after the addition of PA (data not shown). In the absence of PA, the basal levels of δ-opioid receptor expressed in these cell lines were relatively low, <30 fmol/mg protein. In both cell lines, the receptor levels could be induced >100-fold at the highest concentration of PA used, 10 μm.Figure 3Time course of deltorphin II-induced phosphorylation of δ-opioid receptor.EcR-293 cells expressing the DORTAG were treated with 2.5 μm ponasterone A for 48 h. The cells were then labeled with 32Pi, treated with 1 μm deltorphin II for various time intervals, and the degrees of receptor phosphorylation were determined and quantified as described under “Materials and Methods.” A, represents the phosphoreceptor bands corresponding to the δ-opioid receptor at different time of deltorphin II treatment, as indicated. B, the gel represented in A was electroblotted on PVDF membrane, and Western analysis was carried out with the peroxidase-conjugated monoclonal antibodies (12CA5) to the hemagglutinin epitope tag. The bands from the phosphorimage inA and the receptor protein bands from the Western analysis in B were quantitatively analyzed. The degrees of δ-opioid receptor phosphorylation at different times of deltorphin II treatment were then normalized to the receptor protein content and are summarized in C. The values represent the averages from two phosphorylation experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 1Ponasterone A concentration-dependent induction of the δ−opioid receptor.

Afterward, the cells were harvested, and triplicate 1 nm [3H]diprenorphine binding was carried out in KRHB buffer in room temperature for 90 min.

As summarized in TableI, the antagonist diprenorphine affinities for the receptor were similar in both low and high level of δ-opioid receptor expressed. Furthermore, the affinities of the agonist deltorphin II for the receptor also were the same in the control EcR-293 cells and in cells treated with 1 μm PA. Most striking is the percentage of the receptor in the high affinity state was similar in EcR-293 cells expressing different levels of δ-opioid receptor (Table I). Since the ability to form high affinity complexes represents the interaction between the δ-opioid receptor and G proteins, these data indicate the receptor G protein coupling remains unchanged in the EcR-293 cells expressing the wide range of δ-opioid receptor.Table IRelative affinities of opioid ligands at different levels of δ-opioid receptor expressed in EcR-293 cellsPonasterone A[3H]Diprenorphine bindingDeltorphin II, K iK dB maxμmnmpmol/mg-proteinnm00.29 ± 0.120.03 ± 0.021.3 ± 0.3(79 ± 5%)540 ± 38010.61 ± 0.053.9 ± 0.092.5 ± 0.5(70 ± 1%)200 ± 60EcR-293 cells transfected with the DORTAGpINDsp1 were treated with ponasterone A for 48 h.

Open table in a new tab As expected, the potency and maximal activity of deltorphin II were dependent on the level of δ-opioid receptor expressed in EcR-293 cells. As shown in Fig. 2, in the EcR-293 cells expressing the basal level of δ-opioid receptor, deltorphin II was able to elicit 32 ± 1.2% maximal inhibition of the adenylyl cyclase activity. The potency of deltorphin II to produce 50% of maximal response, 1.8 ± 0.2 nm, was similar to the high affinity binding of the peptide to the receptor, 1.3 ± 0.3 nm. Thus, in the EcR-293 cells with basal level of receptor expression, the maximal opioid effect required the full occupancy of the receptor. However, when the EcR-293 cells were treated with 5 μm PA for 48 h, an increase in both the potency and maximal activity of deltorphin II was observed (Fig. 2). The increase in potency and maximal response of deltorphin II was PA concentration-dependent. As summarized in TableII, there was a pronounced increase in the potency of deltorphin II when the δ-opioid receptor level was increased by 3-fold in the presence of 0.1 μm PA. There was no further increase in the potency of deltorphin II in EcR-293 cells treated with PA concentration >0.5 μm for 48 h. There was also no parallel increase in the maximal activity of deltorphin II in EcR-293 cells treated with 0.5 μm or higher concentrations of PA, although there was a 2-fold difference in the receptor level being induced. Hence, as predicted by the classical receptor theory involving amplification of the signals, there is a critical δ-opioid receptor concentration involved in receptor signalling above which increase in the active receptor concentration will not alter both the efficacy and potency of the agonist.Figure 2Dependence of deltorphin II inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity on ponasterone A.

The IC50 and maximal inhibition values were then calculated by the analysis of the dose-response curves with GraphPad prism program. The values represent the average ± S.D. of a minimum of three different experiments, and the values in parentheses represent the amount of 2 nm[3H]diprenorphine specifically bound to cells treated with ponasterone A. Open table in a new tab When these EcR-293 cells were treated with deltorphin II, a rapid phosphorylation of the receptor was observed. As summarized in Fig.3 A, 1 μmdeltorphin II produced an apparent transient increase in the phosphorylation of the δ-opioid receptor, with maximal phosphorylation at 10 min after addition of agonist. The δ-opioid receptor maximally phosphorylated at 10 min was independent of the level of receptor being induced by PA (data not shown). With prolonged incubation with deltorphin II, there was a decrease in the apparent receptor phosphorylation level. However, this apparent decrease in receptor phosphorylation was due to the rapid decrease in the total cellular receptor protein content, as indicated by Western analysis (Fig. 3 B). When multiple experiments were summarized and the levels of receptor phosphorylation were normalized with the receptor Western analysis, a sustained deltorphin II-induced receptor phosphorylation was observed during 60 min of incubation (Fig.3 C). However, the deltorphin II-induced δ-opioid receptor desensitization proceeded in a much slower rate (Fig.4). The t 12 = 135 ± 73 min for the desensitization rate was observed, which was significantly slower than the rate of receptor phosphorylation. In the case of the μ-opioid receptor, the rate of agonist-induced receptor desensitization was increased if the recycling of the receptor was blocked by monensin (13Law P.Y. Erickson L.J. El-Kouhen R. Dicker L. Solberg J. Wang W. Miller E. Burd A.L. Loh H.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 388-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, 50 μmmonensin also could increase the rate of δ-opioid receptor desensitization. Although the t 12 for the agonist-induced receptor desensitization was increased to 62.3 ± 13 min in the presence of monensin, the rate still was much slower than that observed with receptor phosphorylation.Figure 4Rate of δ-opioid receptor desensitization in the presence of deltorphin II. EcR-293 cells expressing the δ-opioid receptor were treated with 1 μmponasterone A for 48 h and were exposed to 1 μmdeltorphin II for various amounts of time. Then the ability of 1 μm deltorphin II to inhibit the 10 μmforskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity after various times of agonist treatment in the absence (○) or presence (●) of 50 μm monensin was determined. The values represent the average ± S.D. of three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)As indicated with the PA concentration-dependent studies, the potency and maximal activity of deltorphin II were not affected by the active receptor density until the receptor concentration was decreased past a critical level (Table II). Hence, the failure to observe rapid desensitization of the δ-opioid receptor was due to the relatively high receptor level being induced. When the EcR-293 cells were treated with various concentrations of PA, a direct correlation between the δ-opioid receptor levels and the rates of receptor desensitization was observed (Fig. 5). The t 12 values, determined from the experiments summarized in Fig. 5 , correlated with the relative receptor levels induced in these EcR-293 cells (TableIII). At the basal level of the δ-opioid receptor expressed in EcR-293 cells, in the presence of monensin, 1 μm deltorphin II induced a rapid desensitization of the receptor with a t 12 value of 9 min. In contrast, the desensitization rate was significantly lower with the δ-opioid receptor concentration >1.5 pmol/mg protein,t 12 >60 min (Table III). Although in EcR-293 cells treated with 0.5 μm PA the t 12 value increased by 2-fold only with a 30-fold increase in the receptor level, a complete loss in the ability of δ-opioid receptor to inhibit the adenylyl cyclase was not observed (Fig. 5). Hence, by limiting the receptor concentration at the cell surface, a rapid rate for δ-opioid receptor desensitization similar to that of the receptor phosphorylation can be demonstrated.Table IIIRate of deltorphin II-induced δ-opioid receptor desensitization is dependent on receptor densityPonasterone AReceptor densityRate of desensitation,t 1/2 (min)μmpmol/mg protein00.034 ± 0.0329.6 ± 3.00.050.048 ± 0.0288.9 ± 1.00.10.087 ± 0.0139.9 ± 1.60.50.92 ± 0.09519.9 ± 3.611.48 ± 0.03362.3 ± 13.221.6 ± 0.03368.2 ± 16.252.24 ± 0.09698.5 ± 45.6The rates in which 1 μm deltorphin II lost its ability to inhibit the forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity in EcR293 cells pretreated with various concentrations of ponasterone A for 48 h were calculated from the data summarized in Fig. 5. The amount of δ-opioid opioid receptor expressed in the EcR293 cells at these ponasterone A concentrations was determined with 2 nm[3H]diprenorphine binding studies. Open table in a new tab With the ability to observe rapid desensitization, we can now address the issue of whether receptor phosphorylation is the mechanism for the blunting of δ-opioid receptor signaling. In a separate study, we determined that by mutating the Ser363 in the carboxyl tail domain of the δ-opioid receptor to Ala, the [d-Pen2,5]enkephalin (DPDPE)-induced receptor phosphorylation was completely eliminated. 2Maestri-El Kouhen, O., Wang, G., Solberg, J., Ericksen, L. J., Law, P. Y., and Loh, H. H. (2000) J. Biol. Chem., in press. Thus, we subcloned the DORTAGS363A into the pINDsp1 vector and established an EcR-293 cell line stably expressing this δ-opioid receptor mutant. As shown in Fig. 1, the expression of this mutant receptor binding was PA concentration-dependent also. However, the maximal level of receptor induced was 50% of the wild type at the high PA concentration tested. Similar to the EcR-293 cells expressing the wild type receptor, the potency and maximal activity of deltorphin II in EcR-293 cells expressing the DORTAGS363A was dependent on the PA concentration used in inducing the receptor (Table II). Thus, the mutation of this serine moiety did not affect the pharmacological profile of the receptor at various PA concentrations.Similar to our observation with DPDPE, deltorphin II did not induce phosphorylation of the δ-opioid receptor S363A mutant (Fig.6, A and B). If the phosphorylation is a prerequisite for the observed deltorphin II-induced rapid desensitization of the receptor, then the elimination of phosphorylation should eliminate the receptor desensitization. This was not the case. The EcR-293 cells expressing either the wild type or the mutant receptor were treated with 0.1 or 0.2 μm of PA, respectively. These concentrations of PA were chosen because similar levels of wild type and mutant receptors were expressed subsequently (Fig. 1). As summarized in Fig. 6 C, deltorphin II could induce the rapid desensitization of the δ-opioid receptor S363A mutant. Although the system was only 35% desensitized in the EcR-293 cells expressing the mutant receptor as compared with 100% desensitized in the cells expressing the wild type receptor, the rates of desensi"

Actin assembly, in turn, is controlled by members of the small GTPase Rho family, namely Rac1, Cdc42, and RhoA. We therefore investigated the possible role of these GTPases in modulating NHE3 activity. Cells stably expressing NHE3 were transiently transfected with inhibitory forms of Rac1, Cdc42, or RhoA and transport activity was assessed using microfluorimetry. NHE3 activity was not adversely affected by either dominant-negative Rac1 or Cdc42. By contrast, the inhibitory form of RhoA greatly depressed NHE3 activity, without noticeably altering its subcellular distribution. NHE3 activity was equally reduced by inhibiting p160 Rho-associated kinase I (ROK), a downstream effector of RhoA, with the selective antagonist Y-27632 and a dominant-negative form of ROK. Furthermore, inhibition of ROK reduced the phosphorylation of myosin light chain. A comparable net dephosphorylation was achieved by the myosin light chain kinase inhibitor ML9, which similarly inhibited NHE3. These data suggest that optimal NHE3 activity requires a functional RhoA-ROK signaling pathway which acts, at least partly, by controlling the phosphorylation of myosin light chain and, ultimately, the organization of the actin cytoskeleton."

An elucidation of the mechanisms underlying the FHBL phenotypes may provide valuable information on the metabolism of apo B-containing lipoproteins and the structure-function relationship of apo B. To generate a faithful mouse model of human FHBL, a subtle mutation was introduced into the mouse apo B gene by targeting embryonic stem cells using homologous recombination followed by removal of the selection marker gene by Cre-loxP-mediated site-specific recombination. The engineered mice bear a premature stop codon at residue 1767 and a 42-base pair loxP inserted into intron 24 of the apo B gene, thus closely resembling the apo B-38.9-producing mutation in humans. Apo B-38.9 was the sole apo B protein in homozygote (apob 38.9/38.9 ) plasma. In heterozygotes (apob +/ 38.9 ), apo B-100 and apo B-48 were reduced by 75 and 40%, respectively, and apo B-38.9 represented 20% of total circulating apo B. Hepatic apo B-38.9 mRNA levels were reduced by 40%. In culturedapob +/ 38.9 hepatocytes, apo B-100 was produced in trace quantities, and the synthesis rate of apo B-38.9 relative to apo B-48 was reduced by 40%. However, almost equimolar amounts of apo B-38.9 and apo B-48 were secreted into the media. Pulse-chase studies revealed that apo B-38.9 was secreted at a faster rate and more efficiently than apoB-48. Nevertheless, bothapob +/ 38.9 andapob 38.9/38.9 mice had reduced hepatic triglyceride secretion rates and fatty livers. Thus, low mRNA levels or defective secretion of apo B-38.9 may not be responsible for the FHBL phenotypes caused by the apo B-38.9 mutation. Rather, a reduced capacity of apo B-38.9 for triglyceride transport may account for the fatty livers in these mice.

Truncation-producing mutations in apob might impair the ability of the liver to secrete triglycerides due to low synthesis rates of the truncated apo B, its enhanced intracellular degradation, or its impaired assembly with lipids, resulting in a reduced capacity of the mutant apo B for transporting triglycerides. Gaining insights into apo B and lipid metabolism in FHBL at the molecular and cellular level may provide information critical not only to the elucidation of mechanisms for this disorder but also to defining further the structure-function relationship of apo B-100.However, FHBL patients are usually asymptomatic (6Schonfeld G.

It is not known whether these low observed levels of mRNA expression faithfully represent the mechanisms of FHBL existing in humans because in the mice, multiple copies of the gene-targeting construct were inserted into apob along with the desired mutations (16Homanics G.E.

The presence of these foreign DNA sequences in the genome might exert unnatural effects on the expression of the targeted gene or on genes nearby (20Hug B.A. Wesselschmidt R.L. Fiering S. Bender M.A. Epner E. Groudine M. Ley T.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2906-2912Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the meantime, due to the low intracellular concentrations of the mutant apo Bs in the mouse livers, it has been difficult to study their posttranslational fates. Consequently, little is known about the cellular secretion and the function of the mutant apo Bs. Furthermore, the effect of modifying mouse apob on hepatic triglyceride secretion is yet to be explored.To generate a faithful mouse model of FHBL, we have used ES cell homologous recombination technology to introduce an apo B-38.9-specifying single-nucleotide deletion into the exon 26 of mouseapob. The selection marker gene sequence that was introduced into intron 24 of apob during the homologous recombination step was subsequently deleted using the Cre-loxP system (20Hug B.A. Wesselschmidt R.L.

Cell. 1993; 73: 1155-1164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). Thus, the targeted apob allele of the resultant mice contains only a subtle mutation in the coding region plus a 34-base pair (bp) loxP sequence inserted into the middle of intron 24. This model more closely resembles the naturally occurring human apob mutations than the previously reported apob gene-targeted FHBL mouse models, in which large segments of extraneous DNA were retained. The apo B-38.9-bearing mice display fatty livers as well as FHBL phenotypes. We provide evidence suggesting that low mRNA levels or defective secretion of apo B-38.9 may not be responsible for the manifestation of these phenotypes. The apo B-38.9 truncation is secreted by hepatocytes more efficiently than apo B-48, but it has a reduced capacity for cellular triglyceride transport.DISCUSSIONThe FHBL associated with apo B-truncation-producing mutations is the best characterized subset of FHBL (6Schonfeld G. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1995; 15: 23-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 7Linton M.F. Farese Jr., R.V. Young S.G. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 521-541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, although the molecular bases of the genetic defects have been established, the corresponding cellular and molecular mechanisms that produce the FHBL phenotypes are relatively poorly understood. Previous studies usingapob-modified mice suggested that reduced mRNA levels of the mutant apob allele and the presumed resulting low production rates of apo B-containing lipoproteins might be primarily responsible for the FHBL phenotypes (16Homanics G.E.

In the current study, we have utilized a novel gene-targeting strategy to generate a mouse model that closely resembles the natural apo B-38.9 mutation in humans. In this FHBL model, levels of the apob 38.9 mRNA expression and intrahepatocytic synthetic rates of apo B-38.9 were reduced by approximately 40%. However, we did not note corresponding decreases in the rates of apo B-38.9 secretion. In fact, apo B-38.9 was secreted more efficiently than apo B-48. Thus, we demonstrated a dissociation between low apo B-38.9 mRNA levels and low apo B-38.9 synthesis rates on the one hand and the high secretion efficiency of apo B-38.9 on the other. Despite efficient apo B-38.9 secretion, rates of hepatic triglyceride secretion were reduced. This indicates that apo B-38.9 is defective for triglyceride transport, resulting in development of fatty livers in the mice. These are new insights into the structure-function relationship of apo B, as well as the FHBL syndrome.The apo B-38.9 mouse model reported here is unique in that only a single base pair deletion (nucleotide 5449) was introduced into the mouse apob coding region and one copy of Lox-P sequence (43 bp) was inserted into the middle of intron 24. Therefore, unlike the complex alterations introduced into apob in the previously reported FHBL mice (16Homanics G.E. Smith T.J. Zhang S.H. Lee D. Young S.G. Maeda N. Proc. Natl. Acad.

The apo B-38.9-bearing mice displayed characteristics typical of FHBL in humans, including low plasma levels of apo B-100 and apo B-38.9 and LDL cholesterol. Plasma levels of HDL cholesterol were dramatically reduced in the homozygous mice. Similar observations have been made in prenatal mice homozygous for apob null-knockout (29Huang L.-S. Voyiaziakis E.

We also observed no significant changes in the liver contents of apo AI protein and apo AI secretion by the hepatocytes due to the apo B-38.9 mutation (data not shown). Viableapob 38.9/38.9 mice were born and reached adulthood in significant numbers, albeit fewer were born than expected. Apo B plays an essential role in yolk sac nutrient transport for normal mouse embryonic development (29Huang L.-S. Voyiaziakis E. Markenson D.F. Sokol K.A. Hayek T. Breslow J.L. J. Clin.

The ability ofapob 38.9/38.9 mice to survive indicates that apo B-38.9 may be capable of performing this transporting role, at least in part.One of the major issues we wanted to clarify was whether and to what extent the apo B-38.9-specifying mutation affects the steady-state level of apoB mRNA, given the previously reported low apoB mRNA levels (∼ 10–30% of normal) in the apoB truncation-bearing mice (16Homanics G.E.

On allele-specific mRNA analysis and Northern blotting, the apo B-38.9 mutation did not affect the levels of mRNA expression of the wild type allele in heterozygotes, but it decreased the levels of mRNA expression of the apob 38.9 allele by 40–50%. The magnitude of this decrease is much smaller than those reported in other genetically engineered FHBL mice (16Homanics G.E. Smith T.J. Zhang S.H. Lee D. Young S.G. Maeda N. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Thus, it is not clear whether the differences in mutant apob mRNA levels between the various mice are related to the different gene-targeting strategies used, to the specific location of the premature stop codon, or to the length of the open reading frame on the apobtranscript.Apo B-48 synthesis and secretion were reduced by 50%, as expected, inapob +/ 38.9 hepatocytes compared withapob +/+ hepatocytes, indicating that the apo B-38.9 mutation does not interfere with the production rates of apo B-48 from the normal allele. A surprising finding is that although the apo B-38.9 mutation decreased apob 38.9 mRNA levels and the rates of intrahepatocytic apo B-38.9 synthesis by 40–50%, it did not cause a corresponding decrease in the cellular secretion of apo B-38.9 because apo B-38.9 was secreted more efficiently than apoB-48 by hepatocytes. In fact, nearly equal molar amounts of total apo B were secreted by theapob +/+,apob +/ 38.9 , andapob 38.9/38.9 hepatocytes. Previous studies (39McLeod R.S. Zhao Y. Selby S.L. Westerlund J. Yao Z.

The present study, for the first time, provides data verifying these observations under physiological settings. Unlike the situation in human livers, in which the apo B-100 is the sole apob product, apo B-48 accounted for more than 95% of the wild type apoB allele product from hepatocytes of the apob +/+ andapob +/ 38.9 mice, consistent with previous observations (5Higuchi K.

The relative rates of secretion of apoB-100 and apoB 38.9 remain to be determined inapob 100/38.9 mice.Triglyceride secretion was decreased in the hepatocytes ofapob +/ 38.9 mice and severely impaired inapob 38.9/38.9 mice, indicating that apo B-38.9, although secreted in expected molar quantities, may not be as capable as apo B-48, the physiological form of truncated apo B, for transporting triglycerides. This finding is consistent with a recent study of apo B-39-bearing mice that showed that the particle volume of plasma apo B-39-VLDL was only about half that of the apo B-48-VLDL (19Kim E.

A previous study has shown that truncating apo B at residue 1768 (i.e. apo B-38.95), only one residue downstream from the apo B-38.9-COOH terminus, caused fatty liver in a heterozygous FHBL patient (12Tarugi P.

Furthermore, we have recently demonstrated that human subjects heterozygous for apo B-4 or apo B-9 truncations have reduced hepatic VLDL-triglyceride secretion rates (44Elias N. Patterson B.W. Schonfeld G. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 2714-2721Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The results of the present study confirm and greatly extend the findings in humans. Thus, selected mutations in the apo B gene could cause a subset of fatty livers.Although apo B-48 and apo B-38.9 were secreted at similar rates inapob +/ 38.9 mice, the plasma concentration of apo B-38.9 was only about half of that of apo B-48. Likewise, the apo B-38.9 levels in plasmas of heterozygous FHBL human subjects were much lower than those of apo B100 (22Groenewegen W.A. Averna M.R. Pulai J. Krul E.S. Schonfeld G. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 1012-1025Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Most of the human (22Groenewegen W.A. Averna M.R. Pulai J. Krul E.S. Schonfeld G. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 1012-1025Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and mouse apo B-38.9 particles are of HDL particle sizes, whereas the apo B-48 particles are much larger. Due to their smaller sizes, the Lp B-38.9 particles may be distributed in the interstitial fluid, as well as in plasma, thereby diluting the plasma pool of apo B-38.9. Furthermore, apo B-38.9 may be cleared from plasma at a faster rate than apo B-48. We have previously shown that human lipoproteins containing short apo B truncations, including apo B-38.9, were cleared from the plasma much more rapidly than the apo B-100-"
https://openalex.org/W2025411849,"During B and T cell development, the RAG1/RAG2 protein complex cleaves DNA at conserved recombination signal sequences (RSS) to initiate V(D)J recombination. RAG1/2 has also been shown to catalyze transpositional strand transfer of RSS-containing substrates into target DNA to form branched DNA intermediates. We show that RAG1/2 can resolve these intermediates by two pathways. RAG1/2 catalyzes hairpin formation on target DNA adjacent to transposed RSS ends in a manner consistent with a model leading to chromosome translocations. Alternatively, disintegration removes transposed donor DNA from the intermediate. At high magnesium concentrations, such as are present in mammalian cells, disintegration is the favored pathway of resolution. This may explain in part why RAG1/2-mediated transposition does not occur at high frequency in cells."

Markedly reduced plasma HDL levels in PLTP gene knock-out mice have recently provided the first in vivo evidence for a crucial role of PLTP-mediated lipid transfer in the maintenance of HDL levels (9Jiang X.-C. Bruce C. Mar J. Lin M. Ji Y. Francone O.L. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 907-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). PLTP also facilitates free cholesterol influx into HDL (9Jiang X.-C. Bruce C. Mar J. Lin M. Ji Y. Francone O.L. Tall A.R. J. Clin.

This is followed by CE formation by lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase and, in species such as humans, redistribution of CE to triglyceride-rich lipoproteins by CETP. Although biochemical experiments indicate that PLTP and CETP have different abilities to transfer neutral lipids between lipoproteins, they also suggest overlap in their ability to transfer or exchange phospholipids. Both lipid transfer proteins have been reported to facilitate phospholipid exchange between the plasma lipoproteins (10Tall A.R. Abreu E. Shuman J. J. Biol.

In humans with genetic deficiency of CETP, plasma phospholipid exchange activities are about 50% of normal, suggesting that CETP and PLTP might contribute equally to this activity in human plasma (12Brown M.L. Hesler C. Tall A.R. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1990; 1: 122-127Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). However, PLTP enhances net transfer of phospholipids from phosphatidylcholine (PC) vesicles into HDL, whereas CETP does not (10Tall A.R. Abreu E. Shuman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 2174-2180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,11Lagrost L. Athias A. Gambert P. Lallemant C. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 825-835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is thought to be analogous to the transfer of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) phospholipids into HDL, but the ability of CETP to transfer phospholipids from VLDL into HDL has never been testedin vivo. Thus it is possible that there is in vivo redundancy in function. In the present study, this was evaluated by crossing the CETP transgene into the PLTP0 background. If there is redundancy of phospholipid transfer activities, CETP would be expected to ameliorate the low HDL state of PLTP deficiency. All phenotypic characterization was performed with female wild type (Wt), PLTP0, CETPTg, and CETPTg/PLTP0 mice (in the C57BL/6 background), 10–12 weeks old. Two diets were used: chow diet (Purina Laboratory Rodent Chow 5001) or chow diet plus 20% hydrogenated coconut oil and 0.15% cholesterol (Research Diets Inc., New Brunswick, NJ). Fasted blood (food was removed at 9:00 a.m., and blood was collected at 4:00 p.m.) was collected for lipoprotein isolation and lipid measurement. Total cholesterol, free cholesterol (FC), and phospholipid (PL) in plasma and lipoproteins were assayed by enzymatic methods (Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd., Osaka, Japan). Cholesteryl ester concentration was calculated by subtracting the amount of free cholesterol from the total plasma cholesterol. Lipoprotein profiles were obtained by fast protein liquid chromatography using a Sepharose 6B column as described previously (9Jiang X.-C. Bruce C. Mar J. Lin M. Ji Y. Francone O.L. Tall A.R. J.

A 200-μl aliquot of pooled plasma (from 7 animals) was loaded onto the column and eluted with TS buffer (50 mmTris, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.5) at a constant flow rate of 0.35 ml/min. An aliquot of 80 μl from each fraction (1 ml) was used for the determination of total cholesterol and phospholipid. 10 μmol of egg phosphatidylcholine containing 10 nmol of [3H]phosphatidylcholine (l-α-dipalmitoyl [2-palmitoyl-9,10-3H(N)]phosphatidylcholine) was dried under a stream of nitrogen, resuspended in 1 ml of a solution of 10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, probe-sonicated, and centrifuged. Transfer of radiolabeled phospholipid was measured by incubating 3 μl of plasma with radiolabeled phospholipid vesicles (125 nmol of PC) and HDL (250 μg of protein) in a final volume of 400 μl at 37 °C for 1 h. Vesicles were subsequently precipitated by the addition of 300 μl of a solution of 500 mm NaCl, 215 mmMnCl2, 445 units/ml heparin, and the radioactivity of a 500-μl aliquot of the supernatant was measured. Plasma VLDL was labeled with [3H]dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine as described previously (13Jeong T.S. Schissel S. Tabas I. Pownall H.J. Tall A.R. Jiang X.-C. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 905-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Mice were injected intravenously (femoral vein) with [3H]VLDL, 7.0 × 105 cpm. Blood (70 μl) was taken from the tail vein at different times. VLDL and LDL were precipitated using an HDL cholesterol reagent (Sigma), and the radioactivity in the supernatant, representing [3H]PC transferred from VLDL to HDL, was measured. HDL containing [3H]cholesteryl ester and LDL were prepared as described previously (14Morton R.E. Zilversmit D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11751-11757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CE transfer activity was measured by incubating 3 μl of plasma with radiolabeled CE-containing HDL and unlabeled LDL for 4 h, in 30 μl of 50 mm Tris, 159 mmNaCl, and 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, then precipitating the LDL by the heparin/Mn+2 method (15Swenson T.S. Simmons J.S. Hesler C.B. Bisgaier C. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16271-16274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and counting an aliquot of the supernatant. 10 μl of mouse plasma together with 4 μl of 40% sucrose and 3 μl of Sudan Black (0.04%) was loaded on an agarose gel containing 0.8 g of agarose, 5% sucrose, 50 mm sodium barbital, and 10 mm barbital. The gel was run in a 50 mm sodium barbital and 10 mmbarbital buffer at 80 V for 50 min. The gel was then blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane overnight. CETP was detected by incubating the membrane with 125I-labeled anti-CETP mAb (TP2) as described previously (16Hesler C.B. Swenson T.L. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2275-2282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The relative CETP concentration was determined by quantitative scanning using a PhosphorImager. To analyze the apolipoprotein composition, the ultracentrifugally isolated plasma lipoproteins (VLDL+LDL, d <1.063 g/ml; and HDL, d = 1.063–1.21 g/ml) were run on a 4–20% gradient SDS-PAGE gel under a reducing condition. The apolipoproteins then were stained by Coomassie Brilliant Blue as described. Apolipoprotein was quantitated by gel scanning software (NIH Image). Differences between groups were tested by Student's t test. Data are presented as the means ± S.D. To evaluate possible redundancy in the in vivo functions of PLTP and CETP, we crossed CETPTg and PLTP0 mice, both in the C57BL/6 background. Plasma PLTP activity analysis using [3H]PC vesicles as donor and HDL as acceptor, showed no PC transfer activity in either PLTP0 or CETPTg/PLTP0 mice (Fig. 1). This activity was detected at similar levels in Wt and CETPTg mice (Fig. 1). To evaluate the in vivo transfer of phospholipid between plasma lipoproteins, [3H]PC-VLDL was injected intravenously into mice of different genotypes. In CETPTg mice, there was rapid transfer of a substantial portion of PC radioactivity into HDL. In contrast, [3H]PC transfer from VLDL to HDL was almost absent in CETPTg/PLTP0 mice (Fig. 2), similar to results obtained in PLTP0 mice (9Jiang X.-C. Bruce C. Mar J. Lin M. Ji Y. Francone O.L. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 907-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). This suggests that in vivo CETP has no PLTP-like phospholipid transfer function, at least based on these assays.Figure 2In vivo transfer of PC from VLDL into HDL. Mice were injected intravenously (femoral vein) with [3H]dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine-VLDL, 7.0 × 105 cpm. Blood (70 μl) was taken from the tail vein at different times. VLDL and LDL were precipitated (see “Materials and Methods”). The radioactivity in supernatant, representing [3H]PC transferred from VLDL to HDL, was measured. Results are shown for CETPTg mice (n = 5) and PLTP0/CETPTg mice (n = 5).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Plasma CETP activity was also measured in these mice, using [3H]CE-HDL as a donor and excess unlabeled LDL as acceptor. This showed significantly lower activity in CETPTg/PLTP0 mice, compared with CETPTg mice (Fig. 3, 52 ± 6 versus 100 ± 9, arbitrary units,p < 0.001). As expected, CE transfer activity was not detected in either Wt or PLTP0 mice (Fig. 3). To confirm the result, we quantitated CETP mass in CETPTg and CETPTg/PLTP0 mouse plasma by agarose electrophoresis and immunoblot analysis. By this assay, CETP levels in CETPTg/PLTP0 mice were 25% (p < 0.05) lower than in CETPTg mice (Fig. 4).Figure 4Detection of CETP in CETPTg and CETPTg/PLTP0 mouse plasma. 10 μl of mouse plasma was run on a sodium barbital/barbital buffered agarose gel and blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane as described under “Materials and Methods.” CETP was detected by blotting with 125I-labeled anti-CETP mAb (TP2).

In PLTP0 mice, all HDL lipids were markedly reduced compared with Wt mice. Importantly, in CETPTg/PLTP0 mice, HDL-PL and HDL-CE were significantly decreased compared with PLTP0 mice. Plasma lipoprotein analysis by precipitation showed a significant reduction in total PL, HDL-PL and cholesteryl ester (HDL-CE) (31, 43, and 44%, respectively) in CETPTg/PLTP0 mice versus PLTP0 littermates (TableI). Non-HDL lipids were not significantly altered. All lipid levels, except non-HDL-FC, were significantly decreased in both PLTP0 and CETPTg/PLTP0 mice compared with Wt and CETPTg mice (Table I). Assessment of apolipoprotein composition of centrifugally isolated lipoproteins by reducing SDS-PAGE gels revealed a significant decrease of apolipoprotein AI in HDL (51 ± 6versus 100 ± 9, arbitrary units, p < 0.01) (Fig. 6). We noted that apoB100 was decreased in non-HDL from PLTP0 mice compared with Wt mice, as suggested previously (9Jiang X.-C. Bruce C. Mar J. Lin M. Ji Y. Francone O.L. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 907-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Also apoB100 was increased in non-HDL from CETPTg mice compared with Wt mice (Fig. 6), which is probably due to the down-regulation of the LDL receptor (17Jiang X. Masucci-Magoulas L. Mar J. Lin M.

Previously, we found that there is a dramatic accumulation of FC/PL-rich vesicular particles in PLTP0 mouse mice on a coconut oil-based high fat diet (0.15% cholesterol, 20% hydrogenated coconut oil) (9Jiang X.-C. Bruce C. Mar J. Lin M. Ji Y. Francone O.L. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 907-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). To determine whether CETP expression has an impact on the accumulation of these particles, 3-month-old female mice were challenged with the high fat diet for 2 weeks. HDL-PL and HDL-CE were significantly decreased in CETPTg/PLTP0 mice compared with PLTP0 mice (18 and 48%, respectively) (Table I). Like the PLTP0 mice, the double mutant mice also showed a dramatic increase in non-HDL-FC and non-HDL-PL levels compared with Wt and CETPTg mice (Table I). However, there was no significant difference between CETPTg/PLTP0 and PLTP0 mice in terms of the accumulation FC/PL-rich particles. These results suggest that the increased flux of lipid through the plasma compartment on the coconut oil-based high fat diet leads to accumulation of FC- and PL-enriched surface components of triglyceride-rich lipoprotein in the non-HDL fraction in PLTP-deficient mice. However, the expression of the human CETP gene in these mice does not influence the accumulation of such particles. Related members of the same gene family often show in vivo redundancy in their functions. As a result, knock-out of one gene may not result in an in vivo phenotype, until combined with deficiency of the related compensating gene. LDL receptor-related protein is an example, where the lipoprotein phenotype only becomes evident after combination with a knock-out of the LDL receptor (18Rohlmann A. Gotthardt M. Hammer R.E. Herz J. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 689-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Even though CETP and PLTP show moderate homology of sequence (19Day J.R. Albers J.J. Lofton-Day C.E. Gilbert T.L. Ching A.F.T. Grant F.J. O'Hara P.J. Marcovina S.M. Adolphson L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9388-9391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and similar structural features (1Bruce C. Beamer L.J. Tall A.R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 426-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 20Huuskonen J. Wohlfahrt G. Jauhiainen M. Ehnholm C. Teleman O. Olddonen V.M. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1123-1130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), they show no overlap in theirin vivo functions. This was demonstrated in the present study by preparing CETPTg/PLTP0 mice; the expression of CETP did not rescue the low HDL phenotype of PLTP deficiency. In fact the phenotypes were additive, resulting in markedly reduced HDL levels in the CETPTg/PLTP0 mouse. Similarly, the related plasma lipopolysaccharide-binding protein, even though it has some ability to transfer phospholipids in vitro (21Yu B. Hilman E. Wright S.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), does not compensate for deficiency of PLTP in vivo (9Jiang X.-C. Bruce C. Mar J. Lin M. Ji Y. Francone O.L. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 907-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Thus, these different members of the lipid transfer/lipopolysaccharide-binding gene family have evolved diversified, nonoverlapping functions. PLTP and CETP were originally shown to have distinct abilities to mediate net transfer of phospholipids from PC vesicles into HDL, even though both could stimulate phospholipid exchange between HDL and LDL or HDL and VLDL (10Tall A.R. Abreu E. Shuman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 2174-2180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both exchange and net transfer activities were stimulated by lipolysis of VLDL (22Tall A. Krumholz T. Olivecrona T. Deckelbaum R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 26: 842-851Google Scholar). The present findings support the original view that the net transfer of phospholipids from vesicles into HDL could be regarded as a model of the transfer of phospholipids from VLDL to HDL during lipolysis in vivo (10Tall A.R. Abreu E. Shuman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 2174-2180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies in PLTP0 mice have shown that low HDL primarily results from increased catabolism of HDL lipid and protein (23Qin S.C. Kawano K. Bruce C. Lin M. Bisgaier C. Tall A.R. Jiang X.-C. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 269-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the net transfer of phospholipids from VLDL to HDL serves to metabolically stabilize HDL in the circulation. In PLTP0 mice, the HDL is specifically depleted in PC molecules (23Qin S.C. Kawano K. Bruce C. Lin M. Bisgaier C. Tall A.R. Jiang X.-C. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 269-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This might account for the reduced levels of CETP in CETPTg/PLTP0 mice, compared with CETPTg mice, because HDL PC has been shown to represent the primary binding site for CETP in HDL (24Pattnaik N.M. Zilversmit D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 2782-2786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study we did not measure phospholipid exchange activity between the plasma lipoproteins, so it is possible that this activity and resultant changes in lipoprotein phospholipid molecular species composition were altered in CETPTg/PLTP0 mice. CETP and PLTP are likely to have substantial structural similarities. Three-dimensional structural modeling, based on the crystal structure of the related BPI (25Beamer L.J. Carroll S.F. Eisenberg D. Science. 1997; 276: 1861-1864Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), shows that both molecules have an extended, boomerang-shaped conformation (1Bruce C. Beamer L.J. Tall A.R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 426-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). There are two lipid-binding pockets, one in the N terminus and the other in the C terminus. The inability of PLTP to transfer CE and triglyceride could perhaps be related to the distinctive C-terminal helical peptide of CETP, which plays an essential role in neutral lipid transfer activity (26Wang S. Deng L. Milne R.W. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17487-17490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This peptide may perturb the surface of HDL in a way that facilitates entry of CE molecules into the N-terminal pocket. Recent site-directed mutagenesis studies indicate that the N-terminal lipid-binding pockets of both CETP and PLTP are involved in phospholipid exchange activity (20Huuskonen J. Wohlfahrt G. Jauhiainen M. Ehnholm C. Teleman O. Olddonen V.M. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1123-1130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 2C. Bruce and A. Tall, unpublished observation. Thus, the distinct functions of PLTP and CETP in mediating net phospholipid movement are probably not related to the properties of the lipid-binding pockets. Rather this could reflect different abilities of PLTP and CETP to bind to phospholipid donors in the circulation or to a distinct ability of PLTP to mediate fusion of lipoproteins or lipoproteins and vesicles (27Lusa s. Jauhiainen M. Metso J. Somerharju P. Ehnholm C. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 275-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). This latter property is poorly understood but could perhaps involve ternary complex formation. Crossing human apolipoprotein AITg mice with either human CETPTg or human LCATTg mice, the phenotypic effect of CETP and LCAT becomes much more pronounced, indicating that human CETP and LCAT work much better when they use human-like HDL as their substrate in mice (8Hayek T. Chajek-Shaul T. Walsh A. Agellon L.B. Moulin P. Tall A.R. Breslow J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar,29Francone O.L. Gong E.L. Ng D.S. Fielding C.J. Rubin E.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1440-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This preference is also shared by PLTP (30Jiang X.-C. Francone O.L. Bruce C. Milne R. Mar J. Walsh A. Breslow J.L. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 96: 2373-2380Crossref Scopus (163) Google Scholar). There is a possibility that the inability of CETP to reverse the phenotype of PLTP0 mice may be due to the fact that the HDL in these mice are a suboptimal lipoprotein substrate for CETP. However, it is not likely, because HDL levels in CETPTg/PLTP0 mice are further decreased compared with PLTP0 mice, indicating that HDL from PLTP0 mice still can serve as a CETP substrate. Several genetically determined low HDL states are now known, including rare apoA-I mutations (31Breslow J.L. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.R. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic Basis of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill, New York1989: 1251-1266Google Scholar), common missense or truncation variants in lipoprotein lipase (32Wittrup H.H. Tybjaerg-Hansen A. Nordestgaard D.B. Circulation. 1999; 99: 2901-2907Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), and, most recently, mutations in ABC1 (homozygous in the rare Tangier Disease and heterozygous in more common familial hypoalphalipoproteinemia) (33Brooks-Wilson A.

Genet. 1999; 22: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar). Although a human deficiency state of PLTP has not yet been described, the present study suggests that the phenotype would include markedly reduced HDL levels, analogous to the CETPTg/PLTP0 mice. Recent studies in ABC1 knock-out mouse liver using gene expression profiling approaches have shown that the largest change in any hepatic mRNA is up-regulation of PLTP (28McNeish J. Aiello R.J. Guyot D. Turi T. Gabel C. Aldinger C. Hoppe K.L. Roach M.L. Royer L.J. de Wet J. Broccardo C. Chimini G. Francone O.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 11: 4245-4250Crossref Scopus (475) Google Scholar). This suggests overlap in the functions of PLTP and ABC1. Thus, ABC1 may initiate nascent HDL formation by interacting with free apoA-I at the cell surface, and the activity of PLTP (transfer of PL from triglyceride-rich lipoproteins) may lead to further increase in the size of HDL particles (23Qin S.C. Kawano K. Bruce C. Lin M. Bisgaier C. Tall A.R. Jiang X.-C. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 269-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is interesting to speculate that compound deficiency states involving low activity variants of PLTP combined with common low activity variants of LPL or ABC1 could result in marked hypoalphalipoproteinemia."

As compared with the FPA isoform, the FPB isoform lacks the last 46 amino acids of the carboxyl terminus and, therefore, represents a truncated version of the FPA. We recently found (Pierce, K. L., Fujino, H., Srinivasan, D., and Regan, J. W. (1999)J. Biol. Chem. 274, 35944–35949) that stimulation of both isoforms with PGF2α leads to activation of a Rho signaling pathway, resulting in tyrosine phosphorylation of p125 focal adhesion kinase, formation of actin stress fibers, and cell rounding. Although the activation of Rho and subsequent cell rounding occur at a similar rate for both isoforms, we now report that following the removal of PGF2α the reversal of cell rounding is much slower for cells expressing the FPB isoform as compared with the FPA isoform. Thus, in HEK-293 cells that stably express the FPA isoform, the reversal of cell rounding appears to be complete after 1 h, whereas for FPB-expressing cells there is essentially no reversal even after 2 h. Similarly, the disappearance of stress fibers and dephosphorylation of p125 focal adhesion kinase following removal of agonist are much slower in FPB-expressing cells than in FPA-expressing cells. The mechanism of this differential reversal appears to involve a difference in receptor resensitization following the removal of agonist. Based upon whole cell radioligand binding, agonist-induced stimulation of inositol phosphate formation, and mobilization of intracellular Ca2+, the FPBisoform resensitizes more slowly than the FPA isoform. These findings suggest that the carboxyl terminus of the FPA is critical for resensitization and that the slower resensitization of the FPB isoform leads to prolonged signaling. This differential signaling distinguishes the FPA and FPB receptor isoforms and could be important toward understanding the physiological actions of PGF2α.

Thus, both the FPA and FPBisoforms share the same nine initial amino acids of their carboxyl termini after which the FPA continues for another 46 amino acids and the FPB just one. Except for this one amino acid, therefore, the FPB isoform is a truncated version of the FPA isoform. Initial studies of these isoforms indicated that both receptors had similar ligand binding profiles and similar stimulation of agonist-induced phosphoinositide turnover (1Pierce K.L. Bailey T.J. Hoyer P.B. Gil D.W. Woodward D.F. Regan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 883-887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Recently, however, we have found that the FPA isoform, but not the FPB, is subject to a rapid negative feedback regulation by PKC (6Fujino H. Srinivasan D. Pierce K.L. Regan J.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 353-358PubMed Google Scholar). This negative feedback by PKC probably involves phosphorylation at one or more of three PKC phosphorylation consensus sites that are present in the 46 amino acids that are unique to the carboxyl terminus of the FPA. Indeed, whole cell phosphorylation showed that the FPA was phosphorylated in an agonist-dependent fashion, whereas the FPBwas not. Besides coupling to Gq and the phosphoinositides signaling pathway, we have also found that the FPA and FPB prostanoid receptor isoforms activate Rho, a member of the Ras family of small G-proteins, to cause cell rounding, actin stress fiber formation, and tyrosine phosphorylation of p125 focal adhesion kinase (FAK) (7Pierce K.L. Fujino H. Srinivasan D. Regan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35944-35949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This activation of Rho and subsequent shape change is independent of Gq and probably occurs via activation of G12 and/or G13. This is consistent with the findings for other Gq/G11-coupled receptors, such as those for thrombin, thromboxane A2, and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) in which the agonist-induced formation of actin stress fibers has been shown to involve either G12 or G13 (8Gohla A. Offermanns S. Wilkie T.M. Schultz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17901-17907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). While no significant differences between the FPA and FPB receptor isoforms were found with respect to their activation of Rho and cell rounding, we have now found marked differences between these isoforms with respect to the reversal of cell rounding following removal of agonist. Thus, reversal of cell rounding, loss of stress fibers, and dephosphorylation of p125 FAK is much slower for cells expressing the FPB prostanoid receptor isoform than for the FPA. Based on the results of radioligand binding, agonist-stimulated inositol phosphate accumulation, and mobilization of intracellular calcium, it appears that this slower reversal is related to slower resensitization of the FPBisoform following agonist-induced desensitization. Therefore, while both isoforms initially desensitize to a similar extent following treatment with PGF2α, the FPB resensitizes more slowly than the FPA. We hypothesize that the slower resensitization of the FPB isoform is associated with prolonged signaling following the removal of agonist. HEK-293 cells stably expressing the FPA and FPB prostanoid receptor isoforms were generated and cultured as described previously (6Fujino H. Srinivasan D. Pierce K.L. Regan J.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 353-358PubMed Google Scholar, 7Pierce K.L. Fujino H. Srinivasan D. Regan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35944-35949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). These two cell lines have comparable levels of receptor expression judged both by radioligand binding (FPA, 3.55 ± 0.28 pmol/mg protein; FPB, 4.09 ± 0.49 pmol/mg protein) and by PGF2α-stimulated inositol phosphate formation. Cells were plated in six-well tissue culture dishes (Falcon) under half-confluent conditions (∼35,000 cells/well) and were grown without any changes of media for 3–4 days in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 250 μg/ml Geneticin, 200 μg/ml hygromycin B, and 100 μg/ml gentamicin. To examine agonist-induced cell rounding and its reversal, either vehicle (sodium carbonate, 0.002% final concentration) or agonist (PGF2α, 1 μm final concentration) was added to the media, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. The cells were then rapidly washed three times each with 1 ml of Opti-MEM (Life Technologies) at 37 °C and were placed either in 1 ml of Opti-MEM (to examine reversal) or in 1 ml of Opti-MEM containing PGF2α (to examine continuous agonist treatment). One hour later, the cells were visualized by phase-contrast microscopy using an Olympus IX70 microscope. Images were obtained using a Cohu 4915 CCD video camera and processed using IPLab Spectrum (Signal Analytics). Cells were split and grown as above for 3–4 days in six-well dishes containing 22-mm round glass coverslips. Cells were treated with either vehicle or 1 μm PGF2α for 60 min and were then rapidly washed three times each with 1 ml of Opti-MEM at 37 °C. Following the last wash, 1 ml of Opti-MEM or 1 ml of Opti-MEM containing 1 μm PGF2α was added to the cells. One hour later, the cells were fixed and were stained with TRITC-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) as described previously (7Pierce K.L. Fujino H. Srinivasan D. Regan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35944-35949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Cells were visualized by epifluorescence microscopy using a × 60 oil objective and optical band pass filters for Texas Red. Images were acquired as above. Cells were split and cultured as above in six-well plates. Following vehicle or drug treatments, the cells were washed and lysed, and 300 μg of protein was used for immunoprecipitation (1 μg/μl) as described previously (7Pierce K.L. Fujino H. Srinivasan D. Regan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35944-35949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) using 3 μl (0.6 μg) of rabbit polyclonal anti-FAK antibody (C-20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Lysates were rotated for 15 h at 4 °C, and 10 μl of a 1:1 slurry of protein A-agarose (Sigma) was added followed by rotation for an additional 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times, Laemmli sample buffer was added, and the samples were boiled and electrophoresed on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose, and the blots were incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of a monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY-20, Transduction Laboratories) for 1 h at room temperature with rotation. The blots were washed three times and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a 1:5000 dilution of a goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Sigma) conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. After washing three times, immunoreactivity was detected using SuperSignal enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). To ensure equal loading of proteins, the blots were stripped and reprobed as before with a 1:1000 dilution of anti-FAK antibody (C-20) and a 1:10,000 dilution of goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Sigma). Cells were cultured in 10-cm plates and were trypsinized, centrifuged at 500 ×g for 2 min, and resuspended in Opti-MEM at a concentration of 107 cells/ml. One-milliliter aliquots of cells were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C with either vehicle or 1 μm PGF2α, and the initial levels of receptor binding activity were assessed, as described below, by the radioligand binding of [3H]PGF2α (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To determine the recovery of binding activity, cells were subjected to the same initial 1-h incubation with either vehicle or PGF2α and were washed three times by centrifugation at 500 × g for 2 min followed by resuspension with 1 ml of Opti-MEM at 37 °C. The cells were incubated again for 60 min at 37 °C with either vehicle or 1 μm PGF2α (continuous treatment) and were then assayed for binding activity. For the measurement of [3H]PGF2α binding activity, cells were first washed three times as before using ice-cold MES buffer consisting of 10 mm MES (pH 6.0), 0.4 mmEDTA, and 10 mm MnCl2. Following the final wash, the cells were resuspended in ice-cold MES buffer at a concentration of 107 cells/ml, and 100 μl was added to a final assay volume of 200 μl containing 2.5 nm[3H]PGF2α alone (total binding) or 2.5 nm [3H]PGF2α plus 10 μm unlabeled PGF2α (nonspecific binding). Incubations were for 1 h at room temperature and were terminated by filtration through Whatman GF/C glass filters using a cell harvester (M-24R, Brandel). Filters were washed five times with the ice-cold MES buffer, and radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting in 7 ml of Safety-Solve (Research Products International). Receptor-stimulated total [3H]inositol phosphate accumulation was determined by anion exchange chromatography in cells that were preincubated withmyo-[2-3H]inositol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cells were cultured in 10-cm plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and incubated with 3 μCi/ml myo-[2-3H]inositol overnight. Cells were trypsinized, centrifuged at 500 × g for 2 min, and resuspended in Opti-MEM containing 10 mm LiCl at a concentration of 107 cells/ml. One-milliliter aliquots of cells were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C with either vehicle or 1 μm PGF2α for the measurement of initial [3H]inositol phosphate accumulation. For the measurement of [3H]inositol phosphate accumulation after wash-out, cells were subjected to the same initial treatment as above and were washed three times by centrifugation at 500 × g for 2 min followed by resuspension with 1 ml Opti-MEM containing 10 mm LiCl at 37 °C. The cells were then incubated for 60 min at 37 °C with either vehicle or 1 μmPGF2α (continuous treatment), and the accumulation of total [3H]inositol phosphates was determined. Assays were terminated by the addition of 2.5 ml of chloroform/methanol/water (1:1:0.5), after which 900 μl of the aqueous phase was removed and mixed with 2 ml of water and applied to a 2.5-ml column of Dowex AG1-X8 anion exchange resin (Bio-Rad). Following three washes with 5 ml of water and two washes with 5 ml of 5 mm borax, 60 mm sodium formate buffer, the [3H]inositol phosphates were eluted with 2 ml of 0.2 m ammonium formate, 0.1 m formic acid, and radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting in 7 ml of Safety-Solve (Research Products International). Cells were grown on 10-cm plates and were rinsed off the plates with Hanks' balanced salt solution, centrifuged for 5 min at 250 ×g, and washed once with the assay buffer consisting of 120 mm NaCl, 6 mm KCl, 1 mmMgSO4, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 20 mm HEPES, 1 mg/ml sodium pyruvate, and 1 mg/ml glucose (pH 7.4). The cell pellet was resuspended in the assay buffer at 3 × 106 cells/ml and then split between two centrifuge tubes. Fura-2/AM (Sigma) was added to both tubes (1 μm final concentration). Additionally, PGF2α (10 nmfinal concentration) was added to one of the tubes but not the other. After a 1-h incubation at 37 °C in a shaking water bath, the cells were washed twice with assay buffer and resuspended at 2 × 106 cells/ml. Aliquots (0.5 ml) of the cell suspensions were added to Eppendorf tubes, centrifuged for 5 min at 250 ×g, and placed on ice. The cell pellets were resuspended in 3 ml of assay buffer at 37 °C approximately 5 min prior to use and were then transferred to a stirred cuvette. Calcium signals were measured using a Perkin-Elmer LS-50 fluorescence spectrometer and excitation/emission wavelengths of 340/495 nm, respectively. For calibration of the Fura-2 signal, fmax was obtained by lysing the cells with digitonin (10 μl of 100 mg/ml in Me2SO) and fmin by quenching the signal with EGTA and sufficient 10 m NaOH to adjust the pH to 8.5. Recently, we have shown that treatment of the ovine FPA and FPB prostanoid receptor isoforms with PGF2αleads to changes in cellular morphology consisting of the retraction of filopodia, cell rounding, and a cobblestone appearance of cell aggregates (1Pierce K.L. Bailey T.J. Hoyer P.B. Gil D.W. Woodward D.F. Regan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 883-887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). These changes, which also included the agonist-induced formation of actin stress fibers and phosphorylation of p125 FAK, were found to involve activation of Rho. To see if these changes were reversible, cells were treated with 1 μmPGF2α for 1 h, after which they were washed and placed in fresh media. The top of Fig.1 shows the appearance of FPA- and FPB-expressing cells by phase-contrast microscopy after the initial 1-h treatment with 1 μm PGF2α. As can be seen by comparingpanels a and panels b, both the FPA- and FPB-expressing cells have lost their filopodia and are more rounded and aggregated in the presence of PGF2α. The bottom of Fig. 1 shows the appearance of the cells 1 h after wash-out, and a comparison ofpanels c reveals marked morphological differences between the FPA- and FPB-expressing cells. Thus, in FPA-expressing cells, the filopodia have been reestablished, while in FPB-expressing cells, the filopodia are absent and the cells are still aggregated. In the continuous presence of PGF2α (panels d), both FPA- and FPB-expressing cells remain rounded and aggregated. In cells that were never exposed to PGF2αbut were subjected to the same wash-out protocol (panels e), the cells maintained their original stellate morphology (cf. panels a). When examined 2 h after wash-out, the appearance of the cells was virtually indistinguishable from the data shown here for 1 h after wash-out (i.e. the FPAs had fully reversed, and the FPBs remained rounded and aggregated) (data not shown). Even after 24 and 48 h, there was relatively little reversal of cell rounding in the FPB-expressing cells; however, reversal was also more difficult to assess because of the effects of cell crowding. Therefore, the present studies focused on the events occurring within 2 h of agonist wash-out. HEK-293 cells are known to express endogenous receptors for LPA, whose activation causes changes in cellular morphology (9Della Rocca G.J. Maudsley S. Daaka Y. Lefkowitz R.J. Luttrell L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13978-13984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) similar to those observed here for PGF2α. To rule out the possibility of an intrinsic difference in the ability of the FPB-expressing cells to undergo reversal of their morphology, we examined the reversal of LPA-induced cell rounding. Thetop of Fig. 2 shows the appearance of FPA- and FPB-expressing cells after an initial 1-h treatment with 10 μm LPA. As can be seen by comparing panels a and panels b, both FPA- and FPB-expressing cells show a loss of filopodia and cell rounding in the presence of LPA. The bottom of Fig.2 shows the appearance of cells 1 h after wash-out, and as seen in panels c, for both the FPA- and FPB-expressing cells, the filopodia have been reestablished. When examined 2 h after wash-out, the effects of LPA were fully reversed for both receptor isoforms (data not shown). In the continuous presence of LPA (panels d), both the FPA- and FPB-expressing cells remained rounded with a complete absence of filopodia. Thus, the slower reversal of the FPB isoform following treatment with PGF2α is consistent with a receptor-specific effect and is not a property of this clonal cell line. As previously mentioned, treatment of FPA- and FPB-expressing cells with PGF2α has also been found to induce actin stress fiber formation and phosphorylation of p125 FAK. To examine the reversal of these responses following agonist wash-out, FPA- and FPB-expressing cells were initially treated with 1 μm PGF2α and were then washed and placed in fresh media containing either vehicle or 1 μmPGF2α. After the second incubation period, the cells were stained with TRITC-phalloidin to examine actin stress fiber formation (Fig. 3), or lysates were prepared and immunoprecipitated with anti-FAK antibodies followed by Western blotting to determine tyrosine phosphorylation of p125 FAK (Fig.4). Fig. 3 shows that after the initial treatment with PGF2α (panels b) both the FPA- and FPB-expressing cells showed prominent stress fiber formation (cf. panels a). Panels c of Fig. 3 show that in FPA-expressing cells the actin stress fibers were gone 1 h after agonist wash-out. In contrast, the actin stress fibers were still present in FPB-expressing cells, indicating that the loss of stress fibers following the wash-out of PGF2αwas slower for cells expressing the FPB isoform as compared with the FPA isoform.Figure 4PGF 2α -induced tyrosine phosphorylation of p125 FAK and its dephosphorylation following agonist wash-out in HEK-293 cells stably expressing ovine FPA(upper panel) and FPB(lower panel) prostanoid receptor isoforms. Two plates each of FPA- and FPB-expressing cells were treated with either vehicle (lanes a) or 1 μmPGF2α (lanes b) for 60 min at 37 °C. Four additional plates each of FPA- and FPB-expressing cells underwent an initial treatment with 1 μm PGF2α and were then washed out by rinsing three times with Opti-MEM followed by the addition of media containing either vehicle alone (lanes c and lanes d) or 1 μmPGF2α (lanes e and lanes f). After a 60 (lanes c andlanes e) or 120-min (lanes d and lanes f) incubation at 37 °C, the cells were examined for phosphorylation of p125 FAK by immunoprecipitation (IP) with anti-FAK antibodies and immunoblotting (IB) with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (PY). To ensure equal loading, the blots were stripped and reprobed with the anti-FAK antibody (lower windows of both panels). This experiment is representative of one of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fig. 4 shows that there was a similar delay in the dephosphorylation of p125 FAK for FPB-expressing cells. Thus, a comparison oflanes a and b shows that after the initial 1-h incubation with PGF2α, both FPA-expressing cells (upper panel) and FPB-expressing cells (lower panel) showed prominent phosphorylation of p125 FAK. However, at both 1 h (lanes c) and 2 h (lanes d) after agonist wash-out, the phosphorylation of FAK had returned to its original level for the FPA-expressing cells (cf. lane a), whereas in the FPB-expressing cells FAK remained highly phosphorylated. In the continuous presence of 1 μm PGF2α at both 1 h (lanes e) and 2 h (lanes f) FAK remained phosphorylated in both the FPA- and FPB-expressing cells. Recovery of [3H]PGF2α following agonist wash-out and competitive radioligand binding were used to determine if pretreatment of FPA- and FPB-expressing cells with PGF2α caused any subsequent changes in the affinity of PGF2α for these receptors. To measure the effectiveness of the washing protocol, cells expressing either the FPA or FPB receptor isoforms were incubated for 1 h with 1 μm PGF2α, to which a tracer amount of [3H]PGF2α was added. The cells were then washed three times, and the recovery of radioactivity in the wash was determined. For the FPA-expressing cells, 105 ± 3% of the initial radioactivity was recovered in the wash, while 104 ± 0.2% of the radioactivity was recovered in the wash from FPB-expressing cells. The amount of radioactivity remaining with the cells was negligible. Therefore, the slower reversal of PGF2α-induced shape change for cells expressing the FPB isoform is not due to a decreased ability to wash out PGF2α. The high efficiency of the washing procedure probably reflects the low permeability coefficient for the cellular influx of PGF2α (10Chan B.S. Satriano J.A. Pucci M. Schuster V.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6689-6697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and suggests that whole cell radioligand binding will predominantly reflect binding to cell surface receptors. Whole cell competitive radioligand binding was done with FPA- and FPB-expressing cells to determine if the slower reversal of shape change in cells expressing the FPB isoform could be correlated with an increased affinity of PGF2α for the receptor following pretreatment with agonist. Fig. 5 shows that pretreatment with 1 μm PGF2α for 1 h followed by wash-out resulted in approximately a 50% decrease in the maximal specific binding of [3H]PGF2α for both receptor isoforms with a slight decrease in affinity (∼1.5-fold) for both isoforms. These data suggest that both the FPA and FPB receptor isoforms undergo a similar degree of agonist-induced loss of binding activity and that the slower reversal of shape change in cells expressing the FPB isoform is unlikely to be the result of an increased affinity for PGF2α. PGF2α-induced receptor desensitization and subsequent resensitization following agonist wash-out was done to investigate possible mechanisms that might explain the slower reversal of cell rounding, actin stress fiber formation, and FAK phosphorylation by the FPB receptor isoform. This was examined by whole cell radioligand binding with [3H]PGF2α (Fig.6), by measurement of agonist-stimulated inositol phosphate formation (Fig. 7), and by measurement of agonist-stimulated intracellular Ca2+mobilization (Fig. 8). In Fig. 6, cells were initially treated with either vehicle or 1 μmPGF2α for 1 h and were then washed and assayed for the specific whole cell binding of [3H]PGF2α. A comparison ofcolumns 1 and 2 shows that this initial treatment resulted in a 50% decrease in specific binding for both the FPA-expressing cells (upper panel) and the FPB-expressing cells (lower panel), which is likely to reflect receptor internalization. To examine the recovery of binding activity, a second group of cells underwent the same initial treatment but were then washed and reincubated for another 1 h with either vehicle (columns 3 and 5) or 1 μm PGF2α (columns 4) and were again washed and assayed for [3H]PGF2α binding. A comparison of columns3 and 5 shows that specific [3H]PGF2α binding recovered completely for cells expressing the FPA isoform (upper panel), but was still decreased by 40% for cells expressing the FPB isoform (lower panel). These data are consistent with a slower resensitization, or recycling, of the FPB prostanoid receptor isoform as compared with the FPA isoform. Columns 4 show that continuous treatment with PGF2α did not further decrease [3H]PGF2α binding activity (cf. columns 2), and columns 5show that the incubation and washing conditions themselves did not decrease binding activity (cf. columns 1).Figure 7PGF 2α -stimulated total [3H]inositol phosphates accumulation following initial pretreatment with PGF 2α and after wash-out in HEK-293 cells stably expressing the ovine FPA(upper panel) and FPB(lower panel) prostanoid receptor isoforms. Two plates each of FPA- and FPB-expressing cells were trypsinized and treated with either vehicle (columns 1) or 1 μmPGF2α (columns 2) for 60 min at 37 °C, and total [3H]inositol phosphates were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Three plates each of FPA- and FPB-expressing cells were trypsinized and subjected to the same initial treatment with either vehicle (one plate) or 1 μm PGF2α(two plates) and were then washed out by rinsing three times with Opti-MEM followed by the addition of media containing either vehicle alone (columns 3 and 5) or 1 μm PGF2α (columns 4). After a 60-min incubation at 37 °C, the cells were washed, and total [3H]inositol phosphates were determined. Data were normalized to the initial treatment with PGF2α(columns 2). Each column is the mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments each performed in duplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 8PGF 2α stimulation of intracellular calcium mobilization in HEK-293 cells stably expressing the ovine FPA (upper panel) and FPB (lower panel) prostanoid receptor isoforms. Cells were treated with either vehicle (●) or 10 nmPGF2α (○) for 60 min at 30 °C. The cells were then washed, and intracellular Ca2+ was measured by Fura-2 assay as described under “Experimental Procedures” at the concentrations of PGF2α indicated above. Data are the means ± S.E. of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Agonist-stimulated total inositol phosphate accumulation was measured following initial treatment with PGF2α and following agonist wash-out to see if the slower reversal of cell rounding in cells expressing the FPB isoform might be associated with prolonged phosphoinositide signaling. A comparison ofcolumns 1 and 2 in Fig. 7 shows that in both FPA- and FPB-expressing cells there is a robust stimulation of total inositol phosphate accumulation after the initial 1-h treatment with 1 μm PGF2α. Following agonist wash-out in the FPA-expressing cells, there is no additional accumulation of total inositol phosphates when the cells are subsequently incubated with vehicle (cf. columns 2 and 3), but there is additional accumulation when the cells are reexposed to 1 μm PGF2α (cf. columns 2 and 4). On the other hand, following agonist wash-out in FPB-expressing cells, there is a slight increase in total inositol phosphates when the cells are incubated with vehicle (cf. columns 2 and3), but there is no additional accumulation when the cells are reexposed to PGF2α (cf. columns 2 and 4). It appears, therefore, that the FPB-expressing cells are functionally desensitized, whereas the FPA-expressing cells are not, which is consistent with either slower resensitization of the FPB isoform or more effective coupling of FPAreceptors to the phosphoinositide/Ca2+ signaling pathway. Furthermore, it does not appear that the slower reversal of PGF2α-induced shape change in the FPB-expressing cells can be explained by prolonged phosphoinositide signaling. To examine the effects of agonist pretreatment on intracellular Ca2+ signaling, FPA- and FPB-expressing cells were incubated for 1 h with either vehicle or 10 nm PGF2α and were washed and assayed for PGF2α-stimulated Ca2+mobilization by Fura-2 assay. Fig. 8 shows that for FPA-expressing cells (upper panel) there was a 25% decrease in the maximally stimulated mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ following agonist pretreatment. In contrast, there was a 60% decrease for the FPB-expressing cells (lower panel). As with the phosphoinositide data shown in Fig. 7, it appears that the FPB-expressing cells show a greater degree of functional desensitization of agonist-stimulated intracellular Ca2+ signaling as compared with the FPA-expressing cells. Again, this is consistent with slower resensitization of the FPB receptor isoform as compared with the FPA isoform. Also, it does not appear that enhanced intracellular Ca2+ signaling can explain the slower reversal of PGF2α-induced shape change in cells expressing the FPB isoform. Previously, we have demonstrated that agonist activation of the cloned ovine FPA and FPB prostanoid receptor isoforms expressed in HEK-293 cells leads to Rho-dependent cell rounding, including the formation of the actin stress fibers and tyrosine phosphorylation of p125 FAK (7Pierce K.L. Fujino H. Srinivasan D. Regan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35944-35949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). While no differences between the isoforms were found with respect to the induction of these responses, we now report that their reversal following agonist wash-out differs markedly between the isoforms. Thus, 1 h after the removal of PGF2α, FPA receptor-expressing cells have essentially returned to their original morphology, whereas FPB receptor-expressing cells are still rounded and show the presence of actin stress fibers and p125 FAK phosphorylation. These results indicate that in FPB-expressing cells there is a persistent activation of Rho-dependent signaling even after the removal of agonist. This difference is not a consequence of differing levels of receptor expression (both cell lines express similar levels) or their ability to activate phosphoinositide turnover (both receptors stimulate inositol phosphate turnover to a similar extent). Furthermore, this difference is not due to an intrinsic difference in the ability of these two clonal cells to undergo reversal. Thus, reversal of LPA-induced cell rounding following the removal of LPA was identical for both FPA- and FPB-expressing cells. Instead, it appears that the slower reversal of cell rounding following agonist wash-out in FPB-expressing cells is related to slower resensitization of the FPB receptor. At this time, we cannot determine if the persistent activation of Rho signaling by the FPBisoform is due to a failure to turn off the original signal or the failure to activate a termination signal. In either case, the structural basis for this difference resides in the 46 amino acids in the carboxyl terminus of the FPA isoform that are absent in the FPB isoform. As it concerns these 46 amino acids, we have recently shown that they are the target for PKC-mediated phosphorylation following treatment with PGF2α (6Fujino H. Srinivasan D. Pierce K.L. Regan J.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 353-358PubMed Google Scholar). The FPB receptor isoform, on the other hand, undergoes little or no agonist-dependent phosphorylation. The carboxyl terminus has also been shown to be a critical domain for regulatory phosphorylation in other prostanoid receptors. For example, both the thromboxane A2 receptor and the prostacyclin receptor undergo agonist-dependent phosphorylation in their carboxyl termini that is important for receptor desensitization. In the case of the thromboxane A2receptor, both PKC and a G-protein-coupled receptor kinase may be involved (11Habib A. Vezza R. Creminon C. Maclouf J. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7191-7200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). For the prostacyclin receptor, however, only PKC has been implicated (12Smyth E.M. Li W.H. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273 (13266): 23258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In both cases, phosphorylation was correlated with agonist-induced desensitization of second messenger signaling. The carboxyl terminus of the EP4 receptor has also been implicated in agonist-induced desensitization of second messenger signaling, although direct phosphorylation was not examined (13Bastepe M. Ashby B. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 126: 365-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, none of these studies have correlated the desensitization of signaling with radioligand binding, although the carboxyl terminus of the thromboxane A2 receptor was shown by immunofluorescence microscopy to promote agonist-induced internalization (14Parent J.-L. Labrecque P. Orsini M.J. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8941-8948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Presumably receptor internalization could account for desensitization of signaling, but this is not always the case. In fact, it is becoming evident that the process of receptor internalization itself is another aspect of signaling. Thus, agonist-induced activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades by G-protein-coupled receptors appears to involve receptor internalization (15Pitcher J.A. Tesmer J.G. Freeman J.L.R. Capel W.D. Stone W.C. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34531-34534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). As compared with studies of receptor desensitization, there has been relatively little work done on receptor resensitization. One recent study, however, compared the resensitization of β2-adrenergic receptors with vasopressin V2 receptors and found that the binding of arrestin-2 to the carboxyl termini of these receptors was a critical determinant in receptor resensitization (16Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32248-32257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). In the case of the β2-adrenergic receptors, which resensitize quickly, arrestin-2 dissociates from the receptors prior to internalization, whereas for the V2 receptors, which resensitize slowly, arrestin-2 is internalized with the receptors. The internalization of the V2 receptors was found to depend on a cluster of three serines in its carboxyl terminus. The relationship of this work to our present studies cannot be ascertained at this time. For example, the carboxyl terminus of the FPB receptor isoform does not contain any serines or threonines and therefore is not a substrate for a serine/threonine kinase. Yet the FPB isoform clearly undergoes agonist-dependent desensitization with respect to both phosphoinositide turnover and mobilization of intracellular Ca2+, and it appears to undergo internalization based upon whole cell radioligand binding. The FPB isoform does contain potential phosphorylation sites in its first, second, and third intracellular loops, but all of these are common to the FPAisoform and therefore cannot explain how these two receptor isoforms differ with respect to regulatory phosphorylation events. Clearly, phosphorylation of the carboxyl terminus could be relevant to the observed desensitization of the FPA isoform, which leads to the conclusion that the mechanisms underlying the desensitization of the FPA and FPB receptor isoforms are likely to differ. Likewise, their mechanisms of resensitization are likely to differ, which is reflected by our finding that the recovery of radioligand binding activity was slower for the FPB isoform as compared with the FPA following pretreatment with PGF2α. Can slower resensitization of the FPB isoform explain the slower reversal of PGF2α-induced cell rounding? This is presently unknown, but we believe it could be a link. Thus, the differential desensitization/resensitization mechanisms of the two isoforms could be associated with differences in collateral signaling that are critical to either turning on or turning off a reversal signal. For example, if the FPA receptor isoform is internalized via clathrin-coated pits, and the FPB is not, this could give rise to differential signaling of a receptor tyrosine kinase pathway that is permissive for the reversal process. Likewise, if the FPB isoform is internalized, without being phosphorylated, it may continue to signal and yet be desensitized with respect to whole cell radioligand binding. Other mechanisms that do not involve receptor desensitization or resensitization, such as differential activation of an unrecognized signal transduction pathway, may also be operative. To date, most studies of G-protein-coupled receptor isoforms have focused on potential differences in the activation of signal transduction pathways and/or initial regulatory events such as receptor desensitization. Not surprisingly, less attention has been given to the reversal of these processes, although they are essential in a physiological system. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a major difference between closely related receptor isoforms with respect to the reversal of receptor-initiated changes in cell morphology. We have found that although the time course and extent of PGF2α-induced cell rounding, actin stress fiber formation, and FAK phosphorylation are similar for the two isoforms, the reversal of these effects is much slower for the FPBisoform than the FPA. This difference is paralleled by slower resensitization of the FPB isoform with respect to radioligand binding and intracellular phosphoinositide/Ca2+signaling, although the causal relationship of these events to the reversal of cell rounding remains to be established."

We show here that transcription of the mouse Ccta gene is regulated by selenocysteine tRNA gene transcription activating factor (Staf) family zinc-finger transcription factors ZNF143 and ZNF76. Reporter gene assay using HeLa cells indicated that the Ccta gene promoter contains two 18-base pair-long cis-acting elements with similar sequences at –70 and –20 base pairs (designated CCT α subunit gene transcription activating element 1 (CAE1) and CAE2, respectively). By yeast one-hybrid screening of CAE1-binding factors, we isolated human ZNF143, which is known to activate transcription of selenocysteine tRNA and small nuclear RNA genes. DNA binding domains of ZNF143 and ZNF76 produced in E. coli recognized CAE1 and CAE2 elements in electrophoretic mobility shift assay. HeLa cell nuclear extract contained a protein that specifically binds to CAE1 and CAE2 and recognized by anti-ZNF143 antibody. Transcription from a minimal Ccta promoter containing CAE2 element in HeLa cells was enhanced by overexpression of full-length ZNF143 and ZNF76 but inhibited by that of their DNA binding domains alone. These results demonstrate that the Staf family proteins control transcription of at least one of the chaperone-encoding genes besides that of tRNA and small nuclear RNA genes.

This function is considered to be essential for cell growth, because null mutants of CCT subunit genes in budding yeast are lethal, and temperature-sensitive mutants are affected in cell division at restrictive temperatures due to abnormal assembly of tubulin and/or actin (10Stoldt V. Rademacher F. Kehren V. Ernst J.F. Pearce D.A. Sherman F. Yeast. 1996; 12: 523-529Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Double-torus-like structure of CCT with 8-fold symmetry was revealed by electron microscopy (11Llorca O. McCormack E.A. Hynes G. Grantham J. Cordell J. Carrascosa J.L. Willison K.R. Fernandez J.J. Valpuesta J.M. Nature. 1999; 402: 693-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). One molecule of CCT is constructed from 16 subunits and contains eight subunit species: α, β, γ, δ, ε, ζ-1, η, and θ in mammalian somatic cells (12Kubota H. Hynes G. Carne A. Ashworth A. Willison K. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 89-99Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar,13Kubota H. Hynes G. Willison K. Gene. 1995; 154: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). These subunits are encoded by independent genes, Ccta/Tcp-1, Cctb, Cctg, Cctd, Ccte, Cctz-1, Ccth, and Cctq, respectively, the expression patterns of which in mouse tissues are similar (14Kubota H. Yokota S. Yanagi H. Yura T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 492-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). For systematic studies of mammalian CCT subunit expression, we recently isolated a whole set of genomic DNA clones encoding mouse CCT subunits and determined entire nucleotide sequences (14Kubota H. Yokota S. Yanagi H. Yura T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 492-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Cct genes are highly expressed in tissues containing rapidly growing cells (14Kubota H. Yokota S. Yanagi H. Yura T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 492-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and their expression in cultured cells exhibits strong dependence on the growth rate (15Yokota S. Yanagi H. Yura T. Kubota H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37070-37078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In addition, CCT is up-regulated during recovery from chemical stress (16Yokota S. Yanagi H. Yura T. Kubota H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1658-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and this response may be mediated by heat shock transcription factors (HSFs) because all of the Cctgenes contain heat shock element, and their expression is activated by HSF1 and HSF2 in reporter gene assay (17Kubota H. Matsumoto S. Yokota S. Yanagi Y. Yura T. FEBS Lett. 1999; 461: 125-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Apart from HSFs, which are generally considered to work under stress conditions, no transcription factors regulating Cct gene expression have been identified so far. Selenocysteine tRNA gene transcription activating factor (Staf) is aXenopus zinc-finger transcription factor known to regulate the genes encoding selenocysteine tRNA (tRNAsec) and small nuclear RNA (snRNA), such as U1 and U6 (18Schuster C. Myslinski E. Krol A. Carbon P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3777-3787Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 19Schaub M. Myslinski E. Schuster C. Krol A. Carbon P.

Other snRNA and snRNA-type genes, including U2, U4, U5, Y4, 7SK, and MRP are also known to contain sequences recognized by Staf in vitro (19Schaub M. Myslinski E. Schuster C. Krol A. Carbon P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Staf monomer or homo-oligomer recognizes a 18-bp DNA sequence, and its binding consensus sequence has been determined. There are seven zinc-finger repeats for DNA binding in the middle of the Staf molecule and the amino-terminal portion contains a transcription activation domain. Two mammalian homologues of Staf, ZNF76 and ZNF143, have been isolated (21Ragoussis J. Senger G. Mockridge I. Sanseau P. Ruddy S. Dudley K. Sheer D. Trowsdale J. Genomics. 1992; 14: 673-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 22Tommerup N. Vissing H. Genomics. 1995; 27: 259-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and shown to recognize very similar sequences (23Adachi K. Saito H. Tanaka T. Oka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8598-8606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 24Myslinski E. Krol A. Carbon P. J. Biol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4846-4852Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). ZNF76 and ZNF143 are considered to play basically the same role as Staf, whereas the expression levels in various tissues are different between the two homologues. In reporter gene assay using HeLa cells, five CCT subunit genes, including Ccta, show strong transcriptional activity, comparable to that of the combination of SV40 promoter and enhancer (14Kubota H. Yokota S. Yanagi H. Yura T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 492-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Here, we report that the Ccta gene promoter contains two cis-acting elements recognized by Staf family transcription factors ZNF143 and ZNF76 and that these factors can up-regulate Ccta promoter activity in reporter gene assay using HeLa cells under nonstress conditions. We discuss the role of ZNF143 and ZNF76 for the regulation of cytosolic chaperonin expression in normally growing cells. The reporter construct containing the 5′ flanking region and first intron of mouseCcta gene in the firefly luciferase expression vector pGL3-basic (pCAL) was described previously (14Kubota H. Yokota S. Yanagi H. Yura T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 492-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The pCAL construct was deleted unidirectionally from 5′ upstream of the Ccta gene insert by a modified method of Henikoff (26Henikoff S. Gene. 1984; 28: 351-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (2832) Google Scholar) using mung bean nuclease instead of S1 nuclease (Fig.1 A). For intron-less constructs, the first intron was deleted from pCAL by a PCR-mediated method using a synthetic oligonucleotide with intron-less sequence as one of the primers, and the resulting construct (pCAL-pro) was deleted unidirectionally from 5′ upstream (Fig. 1 B) by cloning of PCR-amplified DNA fragments. Nucleotide substitutions, deletions, and insertions were also introduced into the reporter constructs by PCR. Effector plasmids were constructed as follows. Human ZNF76 cDNA was amplified from a human testis cDNA library (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) by PCR using the sequence described by Ragoussis et al. (21Ragoussis J. Senger G. Mockridge I. Sanseau P. Ruddy S. Dudley K. Sheer D. Trowsdale J. Genomics. 1992; 14: 673-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) as primers and cloned into the pCAGGS mammalian expression vector (27Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene. 1991; 108: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (4593) Google Scholar) (named p76E). Human ZNF143 cDNA was cloned as described under “One-hybrid Screening of CAE1-binding Factors” below, and subcloned into pCAGGS (p143E). cDNA fragments encoding the zinc-finger DNA binding domains of ZNF76 () or ZNF143 () (see Ref. 24Myslinski E. Krol A. Carbon P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21998-22006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) were also cloned into pCAGGS (p76ZFE and p143ZFE, respectively). Nucleotide sequences of all the reporter and effector constructs were confirmed using an automated sequencer, and supercoiled plasmid DNA prepared by ultracentrifugation in CsCl solution was used for transfection. HeLa cells (3 × 105) were inoculated in 3.5-cm dishes, cultured in 10% fetal calf serum/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 24 h, and cotransfected with 1.1 μg of the reporter plasmid expressing firefly luciferase and 0.1 μg of the pRL-SV40 internal control vector expressing sea pansy luciferase (Promega, Madison, WI) using 10 μl of LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). When effector constructs were employed, cells were cotransfected with 0.1 μg of the reporter, 1.0 μg of the effector, and 0.1 μg of the internal control. After 5 h of exposure to the DNA/LipofectAMINE complex in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, HeLa cells were further cultured for 19 h in 10% fetal calf serum/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Luciferase activities of the transfected cells were determined using the dual luciferase assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and the activity of firefly luciferase was normalized against that of sea pansy enzyme. One-hybrid screening was carried out essentially as described previously (28Mori K. Kawahara T. Yoshida H. Yanagi H. Yura T. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 803-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 29Yoshida H. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33741-33749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar). A fundamental one-hybrid screening vector (pEHEL2; see Fig.4 A) was constructed from pRCE4 (28Mori K. Kawahara T. Yoshida H. Yanagi H. Yura T. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 803-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) by removing the UPRE elements and replacing the backbone from pBR322 to pSP73 (Promega). This gives pEHEL2 unique cloning sites immediately upstream of the twoIRE1 promoters driving HIS3 and lacZstructural genes. Six repeats of the CAE1 sequence derived fromCcta promoter (Fig. 1 C) were cloned into theBglII site of pEHEL2 (upstream of the IRE1promoter driving HIS3). This plasmid was linearized byNcoI digestion and integrated into a his3Δ yeast strain (KMY1015; also carries ern1Δ to reduce background activities (28Mori K. Kawahara T. Yoshida H. Yanagi H. Yura T. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 803-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar)). The resulting yeast strain was transformed with a multicopy plasmid DNA library containing human B-cell-like lymphocyte cDNAs fused with a Gal4p transcription activation domain sequence (30Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.L. Yeh S.H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar) and plated on medium lacking histidine but supplemented with 150 μm 3-aminotriazole. After culture for 2 days at 30 °C, colonies were picked and grown in liquid medium, and then plasmid DNA was extracted. Following reamplification in E. coli, the nucleotide sequence of each clone was determined. The cDNA fragments encoding DNA binding domains of ZNF76 () or ZNF143 () were subcloned into the pGEX-6P-1 GST fusion protein expression vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (p76ZF-GST and p143ZF-GST, respectively). E. coli carrying each plasmid was cultured at 20 °C, and GST fusion protein was induced by addition of 0.1 mmisopropylthiogalactopyranoside for 6 h. Bacteria were sonicated in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1 mmZnCl2 and 0.25 mm(p-amidinophenyl)methanesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, and the GST fusion proteins were purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The purified proteins were stocked in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 0.1 mm ZnCl2 and 10% glycerol at −80 °C. Antibody against human ZNF143 was prepared by immunization of rabbits with synthetic multiple antigen peptide containing TGMIGENEQEKKMQIV (Z143P-2; positions 190–205 of ZNF143). IgG fraction was prepared from rabbit sera by protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column chromatography. Nuclear extract was prepared according to Sadowski and Gilman (31Sadowski H.B. Gilman M.Z. Nature. 1993; 362: 79-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotide probes (see Fig. 4 C) were radiolabeled using 32P-dCTP and Klenow fragment. The labeled probe (0.1 ng) was mixed with nuclear extract (10 μg) or purified GST fusion proteins (10 ng) in 20 μl of binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 25 mm NaCl, 25 mm KCl, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 12.5% glycerol, 50 ng/μl poly(dI-dC)) and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Complexes of probe DNA and binding proteins were separated by electrophoresis on 4% polyacrylamide gels (29:1) in 0.25× TBE buffer at 150 V and 4 °C for 2.25 h and visualized by autoradiography. Previously, we reported a reporter gene construct (pCAL) expressing firefly luciferase under the control of mouseCcta gene promoter/enhancer (14Kubota H. Yokota S. Yanagi H. Yura T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 492-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This plasmid construct contains a DNA fragment extending from 1695 bp upstream of the transcription start point to the second exon (Fig. 1 A, top). To search for cis-acting elements in this region, unidirectional deletions from the 5′ end were introduced into the construct, and luciferase activities of HeLa cells transiently transfected with these constructs were analyzed (Fig. 1 A). Although no significant elements affecting Cctatranscription were observed from –1695 to –566, activities down-regulating Ccta transcription were found in the region from –556 to –147. Trans-acting factors inhibiting theCcta promoter activity in HeLa cells may bind in this region. In contrast, the region extending from –147 to –13 showed activities up-regulating Ccta transcription. The deletion from –86 to –44 reduced the transcriptional activity by 10-fold, and the deletion from –44 to –13 caused a 30-fold reduction in the activity. The first intron showed activity up-regulatingCcta transcription by 2-fold. To analyze the transcriptional activity of the region between –147 and –13 in more detail, a reporter gene plasmid without the first intron (pCAL-pro; Fig. 1 B, top) was constructed from pCAL, and unidirectionally deleted with approximately 10–20-bp intervals. The transcriptional activity was greatly reduced when the construct was deleted from –86 to –75 bp and was gradually decreased by deletions from –65 to –31. The deletion from –31 to –19 bp abolished the transcriptional activity almost completely. These results indicate that there is a strong cis-acting element immediately downstream of –86 bp and weaker elements between –55 to –31. The region immediately downstream of –31 appeared to be essential for the minimumCcta promoter activity. Comparison of the nucleotide sequences in the promoter region indicate that there are two very similar 18-bp sequences immediately downstream of –86 and –31 (named CAE1 and CAE2, respectively; Fig.1 C), where strong transcriptional activities were detected by the reporter gene assay. Between the CAE1 and CAE2 elements, 13 residues are identical, and 4 residues are similar (A/G or T/C substitutions). These observations suggest that the sametrans-acting factor(s) may recognize these elements. Results very similar to Fig. 1 B were obtained using a distinct cell line, mouse fibroblast BALB/3T3 (data not shown), implying that these elements are recognized by transcription factors common to many cell types. Although we searched for possible trans-acting factors recognizing the CAE1 and CAE2 sequences by computer programs, no such factors were found at this stage. To examine the sequence specificity of the CAE1 element, double point mutations were introduced into the segment extending from –86 to –61 bp of the Ccta promoter (containing up to –86), and transcriptional activities of these mutants in HeLa cells were analyzed by reporter gene assay (Fig.2 A). The 16 residues from –80 to –63 bp, corresponding to DM4 to DM12 mutations, made significant contributions to Ccta transcription. This region overlaps with the 18-bp CAE1 element deduced from sequence similarity to CAE2, except for the TT at –81 and –82. The mutations in TCCCGG (–80 to –75 bp) and CCTTGCGG (–70 to –63) showed strong effects onCcta transcription, whereas those in CAGA (–74 to –71) showed weaker but significant effects. Further analysis by single point mutations (Fig. 2 B) suggested that the residues most critical for the CAE1 activity are CC at –78 and –77 (SM3 and SM4). Mutations on residues from –80 to –76 (SM1–SM5) had more severe effects than those at –70 to –78 (SM7–SM9) or –65 to –64 (SM12 and SM13). The others (SM6, SM11, and SM14) did not significantly affect the CAE1 activity. All the single mutations except for SM3 and SM4 showed weaker effect than double mutations at the same positions, suggesting that recognition of each base pair by a hypothetical transcription factor is rather loose, especially at the 3′ portion, probably due to the long recognition sequence of 18 bp. Because the recognition sequence of 18 bp is longer than that of most transcription factors and the middle portion of CAE1 appears to be less important than the 5′ and 3′ portions (Fig. 2 A), two independent transcription factors may recognize the 5′ and 3′ portions, respectively. To check this possibility, several deletions or insertions were introduced into the middle of the CAE1 element at –72, and transcriptional activities were analyzed (Fig. 2 C). These deletions/insertions completely abolished the CAE1 activity, indicating that the fixed length of the 5′ and 3′ portions are important for the CAE1 activity. The CAE1 element seemed to be recognized by a single binding unit (such as monomers, homo-oligomers, or hetero-oligiomers), but not by two independent factors. Furthermore, increasing number of CAE1 repeats incorporated into the CAE1-less Ccta promoter (containing up to –65) caused an increase in transcriptional activity up to 6.5-fold, although to slightly different extents between the forward and reverse orientations (Fig. 2 D), indicating that the CAE1 element has an enhancer-like activity. Taken together, these results suggest that the CAE1 element is bound by a transcription factor that recognizes the long sequence of approximately 18 bp, and that sequence recognition of this factor is tighter for the 5′ portion than middle and 3′ portions. Because the CAE1 sequence is similar to CAE2 (Fig. 1), the same transcription factor may recognize these elements. Double point mutations were introduced into the CAE2 element of Cctaminimum promoter (containing up to –31), at the positions where CAE1 activity was most effectively reduced: DM41 and DM42 mutations on CAE2 correspond to DM5 and DM10 mutations on CAE1 (Fig.3). These mutations reduced transcriptional activity by 10–20-fold, suggesting that the same transcription factor(s) recognize both the CAE1 and CAE2 elements and enhance Ccta transcription. To isolate clones encoding the hypothetical CAE1-binding factors, yeast one-hybrid screening was carried out essentially as described previously (28Mori K. Kawahara T. Yoshida H. Yanagi H. Yura T. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 803-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 29Yoshida H. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33741-33749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar). To generalize the vector system, a fundamental one-hybrid screening vector, pEHEL2 (Fig. 4 A), was constructed. This vector contains unique cloning sites immediately upstream of the two IRE1 promoters driving the yeastHIS3 and bacterial lacZ genes. Six repeats of the CAE1 element were inserted upstream of the IRE1 promoter driving HIS3 transcription, and the resulting plasmid (pCAEO1) was integrated into a his3Δ strain of yeast. The yeast strain obtained was transformed with a multicopy plasmid library containing human B-cell-like lymphocyte cDNAs fused with a Gal4p transcriptional activation domain (amplified from 106independent clones), and plated on medium lacking histidine but containing 150 μm 3-aminotriazole (an imidazoleglycerol phosphate dehydrase inhibitor that reinforces histidine auxotrophy). By plating approximately 107 transformants, 61 colonies were obtained after 2 days of incubation at 30 °C. Restriction patterns of plasmid DNAs recovered from these colonies revealed that they contain at least seven independent clones. Sequencing of these clones indicated that one encoded a full-length transcription factor known as ZNF143 (24Myslinski E. Krol A. Carbon P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21998-22006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4 B), and 46 of the 61 colonies were ZNF143. None of the other clones encoded DNA-binding protein. The β-galactosidase activity of yeast cells carrying the ZNF143 clone showed no significant difference from those carrying control plasmid (data no shown), indicating that the up-regulation of HIS3in the presence of ZNF143 is mediated by the CAE1 repeat. The yeast strain carrying CAE1-ERN1-HIS3, but not a control strain carrying ERN1-HIS3 without CAE1 insert, gave histidine-independent colonies on retransformation with the ZNF143 plasmid (data not shown), confirming that the histidine independence is specific to the CAE1 sequence. The human ZNF143 is a Staf family transcription factor known to control the expression of tRNAsec and snRNAs, such as U1 and U6 (24Myslinski E. Krol A. Carbon P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21998-22006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 25Rincon J.C. Engler S.K. Hargrove B.W. Kunkel G.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4846-4852Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The Xenopus homologue of ZNF143 is called Staf and has been well characterized (18Schuster C. Myslinski E. Krol A. Carbon P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3777-3787Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 19Schaub M. Myslinski E. Schuster C. Krol A. Carbon P.

In mammals, another member of this family was also identified and called ZNF76 (24Myslinski E. Krol A. Carbon P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21998-22006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) (Fig.4 B). We therefore cloned ZNF76 cDNA by PCR amplification from a human testis library and used it along with ZNF143 for further analysis. To confirm the CAE1 binding activity of ZNF143, the zinc finger domain of ZNF143 fused with GST was purified from E. coli carrying its expression plasmid. The purified ZNF143-GST fusion protein gave a single band by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Coomassie staining (data not shown) and was analyzed for its binding to radiolabeled CAE1 synthetic oligonucleotide probe (Fig. 4 C) by EMSA in the presence of a 10,000-fold excess of nonspecific competitor poly(dI-dC) (Fig.5 A). CAE1 probe was shifted to a slowly migrating band by addition of ZNF143-GST, and the binding of CAE1 and ZNF143-GST was completely competed by addition of 100-fold excess of known ZNF143/ZNF76 binding sequences, mouse tRNAsec (m-tRNAsec)-SBS (transcriptional activator of the mouse tRNAsec gene (23Adachi K. Saito H. Tanaka T. Oka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8598-8606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar); Fig.4 C) or h-U6-SBS (transcriptional activator of human U6 RNA gene (24Myslinski E. Krol A. Carbon P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21998-22006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar); Fig. 4 C). Similar results were obtained from EMSA analysis of ZNF76-GST (Fig. 4 B), whereas control experiments with GST alone gave no band shift (data not shown). Labeled CAE2 probe (Fig. 4 C) also revealed a mobility shift by ZNF143-GST and ZNF76-GST, and the shift patterns were nearly identical to those of CAE1 (data not shown). These results clearly indicate that the CAE1 and CAE2 elements are recognized by both the ZNF143 and ZNF76 transcription factors in a sequence-specific manner. In Fig. 4 C, the CAE1 and CAE2 sequences are aligned with the m-tRNAsec-SBS and h-U6-SBS sequences and the consensus sequences of Xenopus Staf determined by PCR-mediated affinity selection of binding DNAs (19Schaub M. Myslinski E. Schuster C. Krol A. Carbon P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) or footprint assay of native gene promoters (19Schaub M. Myslinski E. Schuster C. Krol A. Carbon P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). CAE1 and CAE2 are similar to m-tRNAsec-SBS and h-U6-SBS sequences, especially at the 5′ portion, which was shown to be more critical for transcriptional activation of Ccta than the middle and 3′ portions (Fig. 2). CAE1 and CAE2 sequences also match well with the Staf binding consensus sequences: 16 of 18 for CAE1 to consensus 1, 13 of"

Pre-α-inhibitor consists of a 25- and a 75-kDa polypeptide: bikunin and heavy chain 3 (H3), respectively. H3 is synthesized with a 30-kDa C-terminal extension, which is released in the Golgi complex through cleavage between an Asp and a Pro residue. We now provide evidence that this cleavage is triggered by the low pH in the late Golgi and occurs through an intramolecular process. First, incubation in vitro of the H3 precursor (proH3) at pH 6.0 or lower results in rapid cleavage of the protein. Second, the rate of the cleavage reaction does not depend on the concentration of proH3 and is not affected by the presence of various protease inhibitors. Third, raising the pH in organelles of cells producing proH3 abolishes cleavage during secretion. The amino acid residues near the cleavage site of proH3 differ from those of previously described self-cleaving proteins, indicating that the mechanisms of scission are different.

A common modification is proteolytic cleavage, which usually occurs late during intracellular transport: in the trans-Golgi network and/or in the secretory vesicles (1Halban P.A. Irminger J.C. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The cleavage typically occurs next to a dibasic sequence, and a number of enzymes have recently been identified that mediate this process (2Siezen R.J. Leunissen J.A. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 501-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). The ionic conditions along the secretory pathway vary: for example, the pH in the endoplasmic reticulum is around 7.0, approximately half a pH unit lower in the trans-Golgi, and slightly below 6.0 in the trans-Golgi network (3Demaurex N.

Some of the reactions occurring in the latter compartment, such as sorting of secreted proteins and cleavage of prohormones and proenzymes, have been shown to depend on low pH (1Halban P.A. Irminger J.C. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar,5Orci L. Ravazzola M. Amherdt M. Madsen O. Perrelet A. Vassalli J.D. Anderson R.G. J.

Raguenez G. Daveau M. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Bikunin is a 25-kDa protease inhibitor with a chondroitin-sulfate chain. In plasma, most of the bikunin is complexed with one or two polypeptides of about 75 kDa. There are three such polypeptides, named heavy chain 1, 2, and 3 (H1, H2, and H3),1 having sequence similarity of 38–55% within one species (9Chan P. Risler J.L. Raguenez G. Salier J.P. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Bikunin and the heavy chains are all synthesized by hepatocytes, and during their passage through the Golgi complex they become linked through an ester bond between a hydroxyl group of an internalN-acetylgalactosamine residue of the chondroitin sulfate chain and the α-carboxyl group of the C-terminal aspartic acid residue of the heavy chains (10Enghild J.J.

Michalski C. Fournet B. Mizon J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 881-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In this fashion, pre-α-inhibitor (PαI) is formed from one bikunin and one heavy chain (H3) and inter-α-inhibitor (IαI) from one bikunin and two heavy chains (H1 and H2) (10Enghild J.J. Salvesen G.

J. 1997; 328: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The physiological function of PαI and IαI is not clear, but it has been shown that hyaluronan in inflamed tissue contains covalently linked heavy chains; apparently hyaluronan can displace the chondroitin sulfate chain in the bikunin-containing proteins (13Zhao M. Yoneda M. Ohashi Y. Kurono S. Iwata H. Ohnuki Y. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26657-26663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Furthermore, IαI has been found to interact with TSG-6, a hyaluronan-binding and inflammation-related protein (14Wisniewski H.G. Burgess W.H. Oppenheim J.D. Vilcek J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7423-7429Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The heavy chains are synthesized as precursors with C-terminal extensions of about 30 kDa (15Gebhard W. Schreitmuller T. Hochstrasser K. Wachter E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 181: 571-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 16Bourguignon J. Diarra-Mehrpour M. Thiberville L. Bost F. Sesboüe R. Martin J.P. Eur. J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 18700-18709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). These fragments are released in the Golgi complex by cleavage between an Asp and a Pro residue (9Chan P. Risler J.L. Raguenez G. Salier J.P. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Using transfected COS-1 cells, we have previously shown that these two residues are absolutely essential for cleavage (18Thuveson M. Fries E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6741-6746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The fact that there is no known protease that specifically cleaves at an Asp-Pro site and that the cleavage of the heavy chain precursors occurs earlier than the cleavage of proproteins with dibasic sequences (19Sjoberg E.M. Fries E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 295: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) prompted us to study this reaction further. In the present paper we present evidence that the cleavage of the H3 precursor is autocatalytic. Tissue culture media, fetal bovine serum, and glutamine were obtained from Statens Veterinärmedicinska Anstalt (Uppsala, Sweden). Methylamine was obtained from Merck, and a protease inhibitor mixture containing 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride (AEBSF), pepstatin A,trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido(4-guanidino)butane (E-64), bestatin, leupeptin, and aprotinin was from Sigma. The expression vector pXM was obtained from Genetics Institute Inc. (Cambridge, MA), oligonucleotides from DNA Technology (Aarhus, Denmark), and Tran35S-label (>1000 Ci/mmol) from ICN. PαI was purified from rat plasma as described previously (12Blom A.M. Thuveson M. Fries E. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar); an antiserum to this protein was obtained by intramuscular injection of the protein into a rabbit. The cDNA coding for rat H3 (12Blom A.M. Thuveson M. Fries E. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) was subcloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pXM, which provides adenovirus late promotor-driven expression of introduced cDNA. Truncations of the C-terminal part of H3 were made by conversion of the codons corresponding to Cys662 and Pro823 to stop codons. Substitutions of amino acid residues as well as truncations were made with the unique site elimination procedure through the use of the U.S.E. Mutagenesis Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). All constructions were confirmed by DNA sequencing. COS-1 cells were grown to subconfluence (70–80%) in DMEM (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, and antibiotics (complete DMEM). After release with trypsin, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 10 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, and finally suspended in phosphate-buffered saline/Hepes at a concentration of 24 × 106 cells/ml. An aliquot of the cell suspension (0.5 ml) was transferred to an electroporation cuvette (0.5 cm), and 20 μg of plasmid DNA was added together with 50 μg of fish sperm DNA. After electroporation at 500 microfarads and 0.3 kV (Gene Pulser II, Bio-Rad), complete DMEM was added, and the cells were immediately plated onto a 6-cm Petri dish. The medium was changed when the cells had attached, after 3–4 h. Two days after the transfection, the cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in DMEM containing 2 μm methionine and supplemented with 2 mm glutamine and 1 mg/ml BSA. After 30 min, new medium containing [35S]methionine (0.1 mCi/plate) was added, and the cells were labeled for 4 h. In some experiments, the preincubation and labeling were performed in the presence of 5 or 10 mm methylamine. Aliquots of medium from cells producing H3 (150 μl) were mixed with 600 μl of 50 mm citric acid-Na2HPO4 buffers of different pH and incubated at 37 °C. The resulting pH was measured, and the reaction was stopped after various times by the addition of 150 μl of 1m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. In some experiments, the incubation was performed in the presence of protease inhibitors: AEBSF (2.0 mm), bestatin (80 μm), E-64 (28 μm), leupeptin (44 μm), pepstatin (30 μm), and aprotinin (1.6 μm), or EDTA (10 mm). When specified, the protein in the cell medium was either concentrated 10-fold through centrifugation (Microcon Centrifugal Filter Device, model YM-30, Millipore Co.) or diluted 10-fold in 50 mm citric acid-Na2HPO4, pH 6.0, before incubation. Finally, H3 was immunoprecipitated with formaldehyde-fixedStaphylococcus aureus particles as described previously (12Blom A.M. Thuveson M. Fries E. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In some samples, H3 was first isolated by immunoprecipitation and then incubated at pH 6.0. When indicated, the immune complexes were treated with SDS (6 mg/liter) or dithiothreitol (25 mm) for 10 min at 37 °C prior to incubation at pH 5.8 for 15 min. The immune complexes were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and the radioactive bands detected with a phosphor screen (Fujifilm, BAS-2500). The relative amounts of radioactivity in the protein bands were determined with the program Image Gauge v.3.3 (Science lab). We wanted to analyze the process by which the precursor of heavy chain 3 (proH3) is cleaved. We therefore sought to obtain the cleavage in a cell-free system. As a substrate we used the partially cleaved proH3 produced in COS-1 cells (18Thuveson M. Fries E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6741-6746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This recombinant protein was incubated with solubilized Golgi membranes isolated from rat liver (prepared as described in Ref. 20Hui N. Nakamura N. Slusarewicz P. Warren G. 2nd Ed. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Manual. 2. Academic Press, 1998: 46-55Google Scholar). The pH in the trans-Golgi network has been reported to be around 6.0 (3Demaurex N. Furuya W. D'Souza S. Bonifacino J.S. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2044-2051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), and this value was therefore chosen for the pH of the incubation mixture. As a control in this experiment a sample lacking the membranes was used. Fig. 1 A shows the electrophoretic analysis of the reaction: upon incubation the amount of proH3 (113 kDa) and of H3 (80 kDa) decreased and increased, respectively. To our surprise we found that cleavage occurred at the same rate whether Golgi membranes were present or not. Fig.1 B shows a quantitative analysis of the time course for the formation of H3 upon incubation. The amount increased rapidly during the first 60–100 min and then leveled off, yielding a maximum value of 50–53%; half-maximal cleavage occurred within 20–30 min. Further analysis showed that the pH optimum of the reaction was between 3.5 and 4.5 (Fig. 2).Figure 2pH dependence of proH3 cleavage in vitro. COS-1 cells expressing proH3 were labeled with [35S]Met for 4 h. Aliquots of the medium were mixed with solutions of different pH and incubated at 37 °C for 1 or 5 min. Induced cleavage was then assessed as described in the legend to Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In the experiments described above, medium from cells expressing proH3 was used without previous fractionation. To see whether cleavage was caused by a soluble factor present in the medium, we isolated proH3 by immunoprecipitation and then incubated the protein at low pH: the degree of cleavage was the same as that obtained with unfractionated medium (Fig.3, cf. bars 1 and2). In this experiment, the proH3 molecules were immobile during the cleavage reaction through their binding to the antibodies. The fact that these conditions did not affect the rate of cleavage suggested to us that the reaction was intramolecular. To further test this notion, we ascertained whether the cleavage reaction was concentration-dependent or not: 10-fold dilution or concentration of the protein had no significant effect on the processing rate (Fig. 3, bars 3 and 4). To determine whether cleavage was mediated by a protease attached to proH3, we assessed the effect of protease inhibitors. A mixture containing inhibitors against aminopeptidases as well as against serine, cysteine, and aspartic proteases (described under “Experimental Procedures”) was added; no inhibition of the processing could be detected (Fig. 3, bar 5). The presence of the metal ion chelator EDTA was also without effect (bar 6). In addition, analysis of proH3 by gel filtration showed that it occurred as a monomer (data not shown), ruling out the possibility that the cleavage reaction was intermolecular. To see if the native structure of proH3 was essential for cleavage, we incubated the protein in the presence of SDS: very little cleavage occurred (Fig. 3 B, bar 3). Treatment of H3 with dithiothreitol did not significantly affect cleavage (bar 2), indicating that disruption of its cysteine bridges does not induce a major conformational change. We then wanted to see if cleavage of proH3 during intracellular transport also requires low pH. It has previously been shown that treatment of cells with weak amines elevates the internal pH of the cellular organelles (21Oda K. Koriyama Y. Yamada E. Ikehara Y. Biochem. J. 1986; 240: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We therefore added methylamine to the medium of COS-1 cells expressing proH3 to a final concentration of 5 or 10 mm and determined the degree of cleavage. As shown in Fig. 4, cleavage decreased by approximately 45 and 70%, respectively. Using COS-1 cells transfected with proH3 cDNA, we have previously shown that the C-terminal extension is required for the coupling of H3 to bikunin (18Thuveson M. Fries E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6741-6746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). To see whether it also has a role in the cleavage reaction, we introduced various mutations in this part of proH3 and assessed their effect on cleavage. Deletion of the C-terminal extension, except for the 14 amino acid residues nearest the cleavage site, abolished cleavage, as did deletion of the last 65 amino acid residues (Fig.5 B, lanes 2 and3). In heavy chains 1 and 3 a segment of the C-terminal propeptide has been found to have sequence similarity with the multicopper-binding domain of multicopper oxidase proteins (9Chan P. Risler J.L. Raguenez G. Salier J.P. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), marked with a dashed line in Fig. 5 B. Substitution of Ser for Gly789 or Phe or His for Tyr791 within this domain abolished cleavage (<1% cleaved) or reduced it by approximately 75%, respectively (lanes 6 and 7). Mutation of another conserved Gly further upstream (Gly707to Ser) decreased the cleavage by approximately 50% (lane 4). The possible function of three clustered His residues near the multicopper oxidase region was also studied; mutation of His776, conserved within all three heavy chains, as well as His782 and His785, conserved between H2/H3 and H1/H3, respectively, to Asn decreased cleavage by approximately 95% (lane 5). Earlier studies have shown that the heavy chains of pre- and inter-α-inhibitor are synthesized as precursors with C-terminal extensions, which are cleaved off during transport to the cell surface; for all of these polypeptides cleavage seems to occur between an Asp and a Pro residue (15Gebhard W. Schreitmuller T. Hochstrasser K. Wachter E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 181: 571-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 16Bourguignon J. Diarra-Mehrpour M. Thiberville L. Bost F. Sesboüe R. Martin J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 771-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In the present study we found that incubation at low pH of the precursor of pre-α-inhibitor heavy chain (proH3) induced cleavage of its C-terminal extension. It has long been known that the bond between Asp and Pro residues is sensitive to acid treatment (22Piszkiewicz D. Landon M. Smith E.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1970; 40: 1173-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Thus, incubation in 75% formic acid for 24 h has often been used for the generation of specific fragments of polypeptides (23Landon M. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 47: 145-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). However, the rates reported for such cleavages are at least 100 times lower than those we obtained with proH3 under considerably less acidic conditions. Furthermore, we found that cleavage was optimal around pH 4 (Fig. 2) and that denaturation, which has been shown to improve the cleavage of other proteins (23Landon M. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 47: 145-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), abolished that of proH3 (Fig. 3 B, bar 3). These findings, together with the observation that the cleavage reaction was dilution independent and unaffected by immobilization of the protein (Fig. 3 A, bars 2–4), strongly suggest that proH3 is cleaved through an intramolecular reaction. To explain the acid lability of Asp-Pro bonds, it has been proposed that at low pH, the β-carboxyl group of Asp initiates a nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl carbon of the amide bond (see Fig.6) (22Piszkiewicz D. Landon M. Smith E.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1970; 40: 1173-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The resulting structure (withinsquare brackets) is unstable and may give rise to a break in the polypeptide chain. This reaction requires the presence of an adjacent protonated amide nitrogen. The degree of protonation of the amide nitrogen of a Pro residue is higher than those of all other amino acid residues, which could account for the acid sensitivity of a Asp-Pro bond. The simplest interpretation of our results is that this type of reaction occurs in the H3 precursor and that the rate is enhanced through the influence of the adjacent polypeptide structures. An observation that supports this model is that substitution of Glu for Asp, which precludes the formation of the pentagonal intermediate structure, completely abolishes cleavage (18Thuveson M. Fries E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6741-6746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Bikunin is synthesized as a precursor also containing α1-microglobulin (25Vetr H. Gebhard W. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1990; 371: 1185-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The two proteins are separated by a dibasic sequence and pulse-chase experiments with isolated rat hepatocytes have shown that the precursor is cleaved just before it reaches the cell surface (19Sjoberg E.M. Fries E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 295: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The same type of experiment has also shown that the cleavage of proH3 (which is a prerequisite for the coupling of H3 to bikunin) occurs about 10 min before the bikunin precursor is cleaved (19Sjoberg E.M. Fries E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 295: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the bikunin and H3 precursors are cleaved in different compartments: the secretory vesicles and the trans-Golgi/trans-Golgi network, respectively. The residence time of a secretory protein in the Golgi complex and the secretory vesicles is 5–20 min (26Fries E. Gustafsson L. Peterson P.A. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), indicating that the protein spends <10 min in the trans-Golgi (network). As judged by our in vitro experiments, this time would not be sufficient for efficient cleavage of proH3, given a pH in this part of the Golgi of about 6.0. It therefore seems that there must exist other factors that enhance the reaction. The Golgi is known to have a high free Ca2+concentration (27Anderson E.D. VanSlyke J.K. Thulin C.D. Jean F. Thomas G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1508-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), but we have not seen any effect of this ion on thein vitro cleavage reaction. Another possibility is that the pH is lower locally than what has been measured so far. In this context it is interesting to note that different cell lines differ in their capacity to cleave proH3 upon transfection (12Blom A.M. Thuveson M. Fries E. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 17Thogersen I.B. Enghild J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18700-18709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). If the different components of the proposed cleavage reaction (Fig. 6) would be in equilibrium, cleavage of the polypeptide would not be complete, as is the case in our system (see Fig. 1 B). However, if one of the final products would react irreversibly with another compound, the reaction would go to completion. Since anhydrides may react readily with carbohydrates, it is possible that the complete cleavage of the heavy chains seen in hepatocytes is due to their coupling to the chondroitin sulfate chain of bikunin. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that heavy chain 1 and 2 expressed in COS cells are cleaved only when coexpressed with bikunin (24Martin-Vandelet N. Paris S. Bourguignon J. Sesboüe R. Martin J. Diarra-Mehrpour M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 476-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that after cleavage of proH3, the C-terminal extension (in the absence of bikunin) remains bound to the heavy chain (18Thuveson M. Fries E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6741-6746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that one of the functions of this part of proH3 is to prevent molecules other than chondroitin sulfate to become coupled. We found that when H3 was expressed with a truncated C-terminal extension, cleavage did not take place, suggesting that the deleted part is essential for processing. A region of the C-terminal extension has been found to have sequence similarity with multicopper oxidases (9Chan P. Risler J.L. Raguenez G. Salier J.P. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5). When two conserved amino acid residues in this region were mutated, cleavage of the resulting protein was drastically reduced, implying a specific role for these residues in the reaction. However, truncation of the protein downstream of this region also abolished cleavage, indicating that the general structure of the C-terminal extension is essential for activity. A number of proteins have been shown to have the capacity to catalyze their own cleavage, such as glycosylasparaginases, the pyrovoyl enzyme precursor, and hedgehog proteins (reviewed in Ref. 28Perler F.B. Xu M.Q. Paulus H. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1997; 1: 292-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). A common feature of these reactions is an N-O or N-S acyl rearrangement of a serine, threonine, or cysteine residue at the C-terminal side of the cleavage site, yielding an unstable ester-containing intermediate. Since there is a Pro residue in the corresponding position in proH3, it seems that the cleavage mechanism of H3 is different from those previously described. We thank M. Salmivirta, E. Larsson, S.

The majority of these are integrated cotranslationally into the ER membrane and take their final topological form. In the initial steps of the cotranslational process, the signal sequences emerging from the ribosomes are recognized by signal recognition particles (SRPs) (1Walter P. Johnson A.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 87-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar), and the nascent chain-ribosome-SRP complex is targeted to ER. The signal sequences are released from SRP by SRP receptor and then are secondarily recognized by the translocon (2Rapoport T.A. Jungnickel B. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 271-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). The translocon composed of the Sec61p complex is responsible for the integration of the growing polypeptide chain into the membrane (3Matlack K.E.S. Mothes W. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1998; 92: 381-390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Once targeted to ER, the ribosomes do not detach from the membrane even though they are synthesizing the cytoplasmic domains of membrane proteins (4Mothes W. Heinrich S.U. Graf R. Nilsson I. von Heijne G. Brunner J. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1997; 89: 523-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The membrane topology of the nascent polypeptide is determined by certain sequences that have been called the “topogenic sequences” (5Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1496-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar). Type I signal-anchor (SA-I) sequence initiates the translocation of its amino-terminal portion and shows Nexo/Ccyt orientation, and signal peptide (SP) and type II signal-anchor (SA-II) sequence both mediate the translocation of their following portion in the Ncyt/Cexo orientation (6High S. Dobberstein B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 581-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 7Sakaguchi M. von Heijne G. Membrane Protein Assembly. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1997: 135-150Google Scholar). SP is cleaved by signal peptidase in the ER lumen. The SA-II sequence is not cleaved to eventually become the membrane-anchoring domain. These signal sequences are composed mainly of hydrophobic segments (H-region). Statistically, major differences between SP and SA sequences are the signal-peptidase cleavage site and the length of the H-region. The H-regions of signal-anchor sequences (17–27 residues) are longer than those of SP (7–14 residues) (8Nilsson I.M. Whitley P. von Heijne G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1127-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The function for the ER targeting of signal sequences are primarily specified by the H-region, and their orientation in the membrane are affected by its flanking sequence (7Sakaguchi M. von Heijne G. Membrane Protein Assembly. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1997: 135-150Google Scholar,9Wahlberg J.M. Spiess M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). For instance, the positively charged residues in the amino-terminal flanking sequences suppress the translocation of the amino-terminal domain, resulting in the Ncyt/Cexo orientation of the H-region. The tight and rapid folding of the amino-terminal domain also inhibits the translocation of the amino-terminal domain (10Denzer A.J. Nabholz C.E. Spiess M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6311-6317Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The ongoing translocation of polypeptide chain through the translocon is interrupted by a stop-transfer sequence, which eventually becomes a transmembrane (TM) segment. In the simple case of a type I transmembrane protein, the amino-terminal SP initiates the translocation of the extracellular domain, and the following TM segment thereafter interrupts the ongoing translocation. The stop-transfer function is also primarily determined by the hydrophobic segment and is enhanced by the positively charged residues in the following region (11Kuroiwa T. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. Omura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9251-9255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In multispanning membrane proteins in which various polypeptide segments span the lipid bilayer, some TM segments possess sufficient hydrophobicity to exert the topogenic functions described above, whereas others are not hydrophobic enough to exert signal and stop-transfer function (e.g. see Refs. 12Ota K. Sakaguchi M. Hamasaki N. Mihara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28286-28291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 13Tector M. Hartl F.U. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6290-6298Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Thus, not only simple combinations of topogenic sequences but also some variations should be considered. In the simple and classical mode, after the amino-terminal signal sequence targets the ribosomes to ER, TM segments show alternative functions of either “start-translocation” or “stop-translocation” (3Matlack K.E.S. Mothes W. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1998; 92: 381-390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 14Hegde R.S. Lingappa V.R. Cell. 1997; 91: 575-582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). If a previous sequence is either SP or SA-II, the following TM segments should interrupt the ongoing translocation. From a systematic examination, these functions require hydrophobicity of the segments (11Kuroiwa T. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. Omura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9251-9255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Kuroiwa T. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. Omura T. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1990; 108: 829-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 16Kuroiwa T. Sakaguchi M. Omura T. Mihara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6423-6428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In the second mode, the internal SA-I sequence forces its previous segment to form the transmembrane topology (17Ota K. Sakaguchi M. von Heijne G. Hamasaki N. Mihara K. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 495-503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Even the hydrophilic segment can achieve a transmembrane disposition via this mode. The third mode has been suggested to allow for the integration of TM segments with insufficient stop-transfer activity; e.g.when TM2 of band 3 was placed far from the preceding signal sequence (TM1), the TM2 segment was translocated through the membrane by more than 50% (12Ota K. Sakaguchi M. Hamasaki N. Mihara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28286-28291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The TM6 of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator is in the stop-transfer context, but it is not hydrophobic and cannot interrupt the movement of the polypeptide chain through the translocon (13Tector M. Hartl F.U. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6290-6298Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In this paper, we define the membrane topology of the two amino-terminal TM segments of the human erythrocyte band 3 and attempt to clarify the structural requirements for the integration of TM2 with a low stop-transfer function. TM2 is integrated in the membrane only when TM2 is located near the preceding SA-II sequence and when the preceding signal sequence possesses a long H-region. We, therefore, propose a novel mode for the integration of TM segments with weak topogenic functions. Polymerase chain reaction amplification was carried out with oligonucleotide primers that included appropriate restriction enzyme sites (the sites are indicated in parentheses below). The obtained DNA fragments were digested with the restriction enzymes and then ligated with plasmids digested with appropriate restriction enzymes. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed according to the method of Kunkel (18Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4894) Google Scholar). All the mutants were screened by restriction enzyme mapping and confirmed by DNA sequencing. The sequences of oligonucleotides used and full construction details for each plasmid are available from the authors. The DNA fragments coding for the human band 3 sequences from Thr375 to Phe411, Ala420, Leu427, Arg432, Gly436, Gly448, Gln457, and Gly466 were polymerase chain reaction-amplified and digested with NcoI/XhoI (the Thr375was changed to Met to produce the initiation methionine and theNcoI site; see Fig. 1). These DNA fragments (NcoI/XhoI) and the fragment encoding the mature bovine prolactin (XhoI/XbaI) were then ligated with pCITE2b (NcoI/XbaI). This reporter domain (gPL) contained the entire mature form of prolactin (from Thr31 to Cys229 plus the termination codon), which had been mutated as follows: K72N, K78Q, and K99Q for other cross-linking experiments, and T90N for generating the glycosylation. The DNA fragment coding for TM1 band 3 (Thr375-Leu427,NcoI/XhoI), the DNA fragments for the prolactin sequence (+10 (Thr31-Asn40,SalI/EcoRI), +25 (Thr31-Val55,SalI/EcoRI), +50 (Thr31-Phe80,SalI/EcoRI), +100 (Thr31-His127,SalI/EcoRI), and +200 (Thr31-Cys229,SalI/MunI)), and the DNA fragments for TM2 (Gly428-Gln457) and the gPL reporter domain (EcoRI/XbaI) were ligated on pCITE2b (NcoI/XbaI) (see Fig. 2). For the SP constructs, the DNA fragments coding for the amino-terminal SP of 30 residues and mature prolactin (+10 (Met1-Asn40,NcoI/EcoRI), +25 (Met1-Val55, NcoI/EcoRI), +50 (Met1-Phe80,NcoI/EcoRI), +100 (Met1-His127,NcoI/EcoRI), and +200 (Met1-Cys229, NcoI/MunI)), and the DNA fragment (EcoRI/XbaI) for TM2 and the gPL domain were ligated on pCITE2b (NcoI/XbaI) (see Figs. Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6). For the SA-II constructs, The DNA fragment (NcoI/XhoI) for Met1-Leu30 of dipeptidyl peptidase IV (19Ogata S. Misumi Y. Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3596-3601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used in procedure (ii) instead of the TM1 fragment. For the construction of cleavage mutants of the signal sequences, the cleavability was predicted by the method of Nielsen et al.(20Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4923) Google Scholar). The H-region of the uncleavable mutant of the SP(+10) construct was elongated as indicated below in Fig. 5. Both the in vitro transcription and translation were carried out essentially as described previously (21Sakaguchi M. Hachiya N. Mihara K. Omura T. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1992; 112: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). 1 μg of plasmid was linearized with ScaI and then was transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase at 37 °C for 60 min. The translation system contained 33% reticulocyte lysate, 110 mm KCl, and 1.7 mm Mg·Ac2, and 15.5 kBq/μl [35S]-EXPRESS protein-labeling mix (NEN Life Science Products). During all translation experiments with RM, the membrane vesicles were isolated by high salt floatation. The translation mixture of 25 μl was adjusted to a final volume of 150 μl containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 1.6 m sucrose, and 0.5m KCl and then was incubated on ice for 15 min in a centrifuge tube. 150 μl of 1.25 m sucrose and 150 μl of 0.25 m sucrose, in which both layers contained 0.5m KCl and 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), were overlaid on the mixture. The sucrose gradient was centrifuged at 320,000 ×g for 60 min at 4 °C. The upper two layers were collected as a membrane fraction, and the bottom layer was recovered as an unbound fraction. The membrane vesicles in the upper layers were treated with endoglycosidase H (EndoH) or proteinase K as follows. The aliquots were incubated in the denaturing buffer containing 0.5% SDS and 1% β-mercaptoethanol at 95 °C, adjusted to 50 mmwith sodium citrate (pH 5.5), and then treated with EndoH (New England BioLabs) at 30 °C for 30 min. Other aliquots were treated with proteinase K (200 μg/ml) on ice for 30 min (22Sakaki K. Sakaguchi M. Ota K. Mihara K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 454: 345-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The proteins were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid and were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized on a BAS-2000 or FLA-2000 phosphorimager (Fuji). Quantification was performed using MacBAS software (version 2.5.2, Fuji). The major objective of this work was to explore the topogenic rule that explains the integration of the band 3 TM2. Band 3 is a major integral membrane protein of erythrocyte and possesses anion exchange activity (23Hamasaki N. Okubo K. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1996; 42: 1025-1039PubMed Google Scholar). The amino-terminal half of about 400 amino acid residues is a large cytoplasmic domain, which is responsible for binding with the cytoskeleton. The following membrane domain of about 400 amino acid residues possesses more than ten TM segments (24Wood P.G. Prog. Cell Res. 1992; 2: 325-352Crossref Google Scholar). The individual stop-transfer functions of all anticipated TM segments of band 3 were assessed in vitro by using model proteins in which each TM segment was positioned 200 residues from the amino-terminal SP (12Ota K. Sakaguchi M. Hamasaki N. Mihara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28286-28291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In this context, the TM2 segment of the synthesized polypeptides were more than 55% translocated through the membrane, whereas other TM segments in the stop-transfer context (e.g. TM4, TM6, and TM8) efficiently acquired transmembrane disposition. To clarify the topogenic properties of the TM1–TM2 region, we made a series of fusion proteins, in which a reporter domain (gPL) was fused to the carboxyl terminus of various portions of band 3 membrane domain, starting from Thr375 (Fig. 1,A and B). The reporter domain is an entire bovine prolactin (gPL) that possesses an in-frame termination codon and mutation (T90N) to create a glycosylation site (Fig. 1 B). The translocation of the reporter domain across the ER membrane can be monitored either by its glycosylation or by its resistance against proteinase K. These constructs were translated in vitro in the absence or presence of RM (Fig. 1 C). When translated in the presence of RM, the membrane vesicles were isolated by high salt floatation, which can exclude polypeptides that had not been targeted to the membrane. It should therefore be noted that the RM(+) lanes include only the proteins that bound to RM. The aliquots of the membrane vesicles were treated by proteinase K or EndoH. The construct of Phe411 contained the band 3 sequence from Thr375 to Phe411 and the reporter domain. When it was synthesized in the absence of RM, it gave a single major band (lane 1). Upon being translated in the presence of RM, it was observed in the membrane fraction by only 18% (lane 2). The membrane-bound form was neither glycosylated (lane 3) nor proteinase K-resistant (lane 4). These results indicated that the Phe411 construct was not efficiently targeted to the membrane and that even the membrane-associated polypeptide did not show transmembrane disposition. In contrast, when the construct of Ala420 was synthesized in the presence of RM, a substantial amount of the higher molecular weight form was observed (lane 6). Upon EndoH treatment, two molecular species were observed (lane 7). Almost all membrane-associated products were resistant to the proteinase K treatment (lane 8). These bands disappeared after the proteinase K treatment in the presence of detergent (not shown). The data of glycosylation and resistance against the proteinase K indicated that the gPL domain of the membrane-targeted Ala420 construct was efficiently translocated across the membrane (Fig. 1 B, cases a andb). The smaller band observed after the EndoH treatment is highly likely to have resulted from processing by signal peptidase (case b), although other proteases in the ER lumen might be involved in the partial degradation. In any event, it is clear that the reporter domain of the membrane-targeted polypeptide was completely translocated across the membrane. The constructs from Leu427 to Gly448 gave similar result to those obtained with Ala420 construct. They were glycosylated at the reporter domain, and the membrane-bound polypeptides were almost completely resistant to proteinase K, indicating that the reporter domains of membrane-targeted polypeptides were efficiently translocated across the membrane (Fig. 1 B,cases a and b). In the EndoH(+) lanes of all these constructs, double bands were noted, demonstrating that the polypeptide in the membrane fraction was processed by signal peptidase or another unknown protease in the ER lumen (case b). As the created glycosylation site in the reporter domain was efficiently glycosylated as shown in subsequent experiments (Figs.2 and 3), we can assume that 50% (on average) of the translocated polypeptides were processed. These data demonstrated that the TM1 segment possesses a sufficient activity of SA-II sequence, and these findings are consistent with those of previous reports (12Ota K. Sakaguchi M. Hamasaki N. Mihara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28286-28291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 25Tam L.Y. Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. Reithmeier R.A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32542-32550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the longer constructs (Gln457 and Gly466) that included TM1 and whole TM2 gave only trace amounts of a glycosylated and proteinase K-resistant bands (Fig.1 C, lanes 26–32), although they efficiently recovered in the membrane fractions by more than 70% (lanes 26 and 30). Alkali extraction experiments also demonstrated these constructs to be tightly associated with the membrane (data not shown). Little processing by signal peptidase was observed with these constructs (lanes 27 and 31). It is highly likely that the processing site is inaccessible to the peptidase, because the TM2 interrupts the translocation. Taken together, we concluded that, in the original context, the TM2 segment efficiently interrupts the translocation that is initiated by TM1 and stably anchored in the membrane (Fig. 1 B, case c). However, the question remains as to how the TM2 segment interrupts the translocation in the original context. The polar sequence connecting TM1 and TM2 is only 11 residues long (Glu429-Glu439). To examine the effect of the loop length on the disposition of TM2, we constructed a series of model proteins in which the hydrophilic sequences from mature prolactin were inserted between Leu427 and Gly428 (Fig.2 A). These fusion proteins involve the band 3 sequence from Thr375 to Gln457, as indicated by spacers (shaded bars) in Fig. 2 A, and the reporter domain (gPL). When the spacer was 10 residues (+10) giving rise to a final loop length of 21, trace amounts of glycosylated and proteinase K-resistant forms were observed, as with the Gln457construct (Fig. 2 B, lanes 6 and 8). Therefore, this indicated that TM2 was integrated in the membrane and that almost all the reporter domain of membrane-bound polypeptide was on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane (Fig 2 C, case a). In contrast, the +200 construct was glycosylated by 55% and became proteinase K-resistant (lanes 10 and 12). The glycosylation was confirmed by EndoH treatment (lane 11). In this case, the partial processing of the translocated domain observed in Fig. 1 was not observed probably due to the difference of amino acid sequence at the junction. Because the proteinase K-resistant band was almost completely glycosylated (lane 12), it is thus reasonable to assume that the glycosylation efficiency of the translocated gPL domain is nearly 100%. Because the EndoH treatment gave no processed form, the translocation of TM2 and reporter domain of these constructs can be simply estimated by the extent of the glycosylation. Thus, the TM2 segment of the 55% membrane-bound +200 construct did not acquire transmembrane disposition but instead was translocated into the lumen (Fig. 2 C, case c), whereas the TM2 segment of only 45% polypeptide was integrated and left the reporter domain on the cytoplasmic side (case b). The efficiencies of glycosylation of gPL domains depend on the loop length (Fig.2 D), i.e. the population of polypeptide with membrane-integrated TM2 decreased as the inserted sequence became longer. These results suggest that TM2 must be near the preceding TM1 to be integrated into the membrane. To examine whether or not TM1 is a unique partner for TM2 integration, we made two series of constructs, in which the TM1 of the constructs in Fig. 2 was replaced with either SP of preprolactin or SA-II sequence of dipeptidyl peptidase IV (Fig. 3 A). In the case of the constructs with +10 insertion, the products of the SP version were 48% glycosylated, whereas the SA-II version was glycosylated by only 20% (Fig.3 B, lanes 1–4 versus 9–12). In contrast, both versions of the constructs with a +200 insertion were efficiently glycosylated and gave proteinase K-resistant forms (lanes 5–8 and 13–16). The proteinase K-resistant forms were efficiently glycosylated, thus indicating again that the glycosylation efficiency of the membrane-bound form should be expected to be a good index of the translocation (namely, failure of membrane integration) of the TM2 segment. The result obtained with various constructs showed that integration of the TM2 segment of SA-II versions strongly depended on the loop length (Fig. 3 C). In contrast, integration of the SP versions were at low level even when SP was in the proximity of TM2. These results demonstrate that the other SA-II can mediate the integration of TM2 when it is located in the proximity of TM2, but the SP was inefficient for TM2 integration. The preceding signal sequence seems to be one of the determinants of TM2 integration. Based on differences between the SP and SA-II sequences, we then examined the effects of (i) accessibility to the signal peptidase and (ii) the length of H-region. First, cleavage mutants of the +10 version constructs were made (Fig.4 A). A cleavable mutant (SA-II(C)) of the SA-II sequence slightly increased the glycosylation efficiency (B, lanes 2 and 6); namely, the cleavable mutation caused a slight decrease of integration of TM2 segment. After EndoH treatment, the SA-II(C) gave a single band that is smaller than the precursor form (lane 7), indicating that this mutant was completely cleaved by the signal peptidase. The proteinase K-resistant forms of the two constructs were glycosylated (lanes 4 and 8). On the other hand, an uncleavable mutant (SP(UC)) of SP also caused a slight increase in glycosylation (lanes 10 and 14), indicating that the mutation resulted in a slight decrease in integration of TM2 segment. After EndoH treatment of the translation products, SP(UC) showed a band with the same mobility as the precursor form (lanes 13 and 15), indicating that this mutant was, as expected, not cleaved. Because only trace amounts of the precursor form were detected in lane 11, the precursor form in the membrane fraction is thought to be negligible. The higher molecular weight band in lane 10 was resistant to proteinase K (lane 12) and disappeared after EndoH treatment (lane 11), thus indicating that it is a processed and glycosylated form of prolactin. Taken together, both mutations resulted in a slight decrease in the integration of TM2. We thus concluded that the cleavability of the proceeding signal sequence demonstrated no correlation with the efficiency of TM2 integration. The length of the H-regions of SP and SA-II sequence are clearly different (Fig. 5 A); the H-regions of signal-anchor sequences (17–27 residues) are longer than those of signal peptides (7–14 residues) (8Nilsson I.M. Whitley P. von Heijne G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1127-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). To address this effect on the TM2 integration, we inserted the residues of alanine and leucine into the H-region of SP(UC) (Fig. 5 B). By mutagenesis, the translocation of TM2 decreased according to the number of inserted residues (Fig. 5 C), whereas membrane anchoring was not affected (not shown). The mutant with an insertion of six alanine residues (+6A) showed a similar degree of integration as the TM1 construct. The length of the H-region of the mutant is equivalent to TM1 (Fig. 5 A). Interestingly, the insertion of alanine and leucine produced essentially the same results. It is, therefore, suggested that the length of the signal sequence preceding TM2 critically affects the fate of TM2. The extent of the TM2 integration depends on the loop length between TM1 and TM2. When the loop preceding TM2 was elongated, the TM2 segment tends to be translocated through the membrane (Fig. 2). In contrast, TM2 is integrated in the membrane in the original context where it is located in close proximity to TM1 (Fig. 1). There should be novel rules for maintaining the transmembrane topology of TM2, which possesses such a low stop-transfer activity (only 40–45%). The simplest explanation of this fact is that, when the loop is long, TM1 leaves the translocon and no longer takes part in the integration of TM2 (Fig. 6). Mothes et al.(4Mothes W. Heinrich S.U. Graf R. Nilsson I. von Heijne G. Brunner J. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1997; 89: 523-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) demonstrated that a preceding TM segment encounters membrane lipid even when the ribosome synthesizing the nascent polypeptide is still on the membrane. The alternative explanation for the dependence of the loop length is that chaperon-like factors in the lumen may exert some effect as the loop becomes longer, because BiP (Kar2p) is known to show a molecular ratchet function in the post-translational protein translocation of the yeast ER system (26Matlack K.E.S. Misselwitz B. Plath K. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1999; 97: 553-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). However, TM2 of SP version constructs was translocated through the membrane even when the loop was short (Fig. 3). Therefore, it is likely that such pulling forces, if they make any contribution at all, are not a major determinant of the fate of TM2 investigated here. Upon entering into the translocon, TM2 appears to directly interact with the preceding TM1 in the original context. What kind of interactions should be operative? The interaction is not sequence-specific, but depends on the length of the H-region of the preceding signal sequence (Figs. 3 and 5). Some hydrophobic packing between the two polypeptide chains may play a role in this process. Such interaction is comparable to the hydrophobic interaction that is frequently observed in folding intermediates of soluble proteins (27Travaglini-Allocatelli C. Cutruzzola F. Bigotti M.G. Staniforth R.A. Brunori M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 1459-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). SP did not effectively support the integration of TM2. The H-region is most likely too short to fully interact with TM2. It is also possible that this fact could reflect the positions of signal sequences within the translocon. It has been demonstrated that a signal peptide with a short H-region is positioned differently from the signal-anchor with a long H-region (8Nilsson I.M. Whitley P. von Heijne G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1127-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The long H-region of SA-II in the translocon is more accessible to the membrane lipid than is SP with a short H-region (28Martoglio B. Hofmann M. Brunner J. Dobberstein B. Cell. 1995; 81: 207-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). We therefore propose that closely located TM segments in multispanning membrane proteins cooperate in the translocon to establish the final membrane topology via somewhat direct interaction as indicated in the working model (Fig. 6). Hydrogen bonding and ionic bonding, in addition to hydrophobic interaction, should mediate specific recognition and stabilize some internal TM segments (29Lodish H.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1988; 13: 332-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Actually, the TM2 segment in the band 3 molecule was readily extracted by protease treatment after the alkaline denaturation of the erythrocyte membrane (30Hamasaki N. Okubo K. Kuma H. Kang D. Yae Y. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1997; 122: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). From this observation, it has been proposed that the some hydrophilic interaction stabilizes the TM2 in the membrane (31Hamasaki N. Kuma H. Ota K. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 729-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 32Kuma H. Inoue K. Fu G. Ando S. Lee S. Sugihara G. Hamasaki N. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1998; 124: 509-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). This type of consideration, such as containing charged amino acid residues, may help explain the cotranslational integration of various TM segments in the stop-transfer context; e.g. a TM segment near the carboxyl terminus of yeast Sec61p (33Wilkinson B.M. Critchley A.J. Stirling C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25590-25597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), S4 of shaker-type potassium channel (34Uozumi N. Nakamura T.

Hartl F.U. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6290-6298Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The direct interaction mode proposed here, as well as the internal SA-I mode (17Ota K. Sakaguchi M. von Heijne G. Hamasaki N. Mihara K. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 495-503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), explains the various topogenic processes of multispanning membrane proteins. Most importantly, in those cases, all the TM segments in the multispanning membrane proteins do not necessarily possess sufficient topogenic functions."

The best characterized laminin-1 (α1β1γ1) is a cross-shaped molecule in which all three chains contribute to the α-helical coiled-coil to form the long arm of the cross, whereas the short arms are composed of one chain each (8Beck K. Hunter I. Engel J. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 148-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). Since the N-terminal short arm region is truncated in α3 (splice variant of α3A), α4, β3, and γ2, we can define three groups of laminins; the cross-shaped laminins containing a complete complement of domains (laminins-1, -2, -3, -4, -10, and -11), the rod-shaped laminins lacking domains in all three short arms (laminin-5), and the Y-shaped laminins lacking an α chain short arm but remaining full-sized β and γ chains (laminins-6, -7, -8, and -9). Laminin-1, -2, and -4 form polymers by reversible self-assembly of monomers at short arms in a calcium ion- and temperature-dependent manner with a critical concentration of assembly of 70–140 nm (9Yurchenco P.D.

This polymerization of the cross-shaped laminins has a central role in forming the meshwork architecture of basement membranes. Since all three short arms are required for self-assembly (11Cheng Y.S.

Compared with β and γ chains, all α chains are unique in that their C termini contain a tandem of five laminin G-like (LG)1 modules, which form a large globular structure at the C-terminal end of laminins and contains binding sites for heparin (12Ott U.

Since truncation of N-terminal short arm and characteristic expression patterns suggest distinct activity of the α4 G domain from those of α1 and α2, we have overexpressed mouse α4LG1–LG5 indhfr-deficient CHO cells and compared its heparin binding activity with that of α1LG1–LG5 overexpressed in parallel. We report here that α4LG1–LG5 has stronger affinity to heparin than α1LG1–LG5. While the region spanning α4 LG2–LG3 had affinity comparable to α1LGs, α4LG4 was found to be responsible for the strong binging to heparin. Plasmids for the expression of recombinant mouse laminin α1LG1–LG5 and α4LG1–LG5 (Fig. 1) were constructed based on the pEF series of plasmids (31Niimi T. Kitagawa Y.

For pEFα4Gmyc, mouse laminin α4cDNA clones isolated from a mouse heart cDNA library constructed in λZAPII (Stratagene) were used. These included pA4-3 (covering the 1.4-kb fragment between nt 4261 and poly(A) tail; nucleotide numbers according Ref. 33Liu J. Mayne R. Matrix Biol. 1996; 15: 433-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), pA4-8 (1.4 kb, nt 3658–5021), pA4–14 (1.9 kb, nt 2714–4611), and pA4–15 (2.5 kb, nt 840–3315). The 0.7-kb EcoRI-XbaI fragment of pA4-8 and the 1.4-kb SacI-EcoRI fragment of pA4-14 were connected at the EcoRI end and subcloned inSacI and XbaI sites of pBluescript SK+ to generate pBSA4Sac/Xba. A cDNA fragment corresponding to nt 4954–5445 was prepared by PCR using pA4-3 as template and a reverse primer tagged with an extra 5′ EcoRV sequence. The resulting fragment was digested with XbaI andEcoRV, and subcloned into XbaI andEcoRV sites of pBSA4Sac/Xba to yield pBSA4Sac/EcoRV. A cDNA fragment nt 2497–2758t was prepared by PCR using pA4–15 as template and a forward primer tagged with an extra 5′ SmaI sequence. The resulting fragment was connected to the SacI-EcoRV fragment in pBSA4Sac-EcoRV after digestion with SmaI andSacI and inserted to SmaI and EcoRV sites of the pEFΔβ1S to generate pEFα4Gmyc. The sequence was confirmed to code for the mouse α4LG1–LG5 sequence from Gly833 to Ala1815 followed by a Myc-tag sequence. For construction of pEFα1Gmyc, a cDNA fragment coding for the mouse laminin α1 sequence (34Sasaki M. Kleinman H.K. Huber H. Deutzmann R. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16536-16544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) from Ile2100 to Pro3060 was prepared by RT-PCR using total RNA extracted from mouse embryonal carcinoma F9 cells and forward and reverse primers tagged with extra 5′ BamHI andEcoRV sequences, respectively. The laminin β1 fragment in pEFEΔβ1S was replaced by this fragment at BamHI andEcoRV sites to generate pEFα1Gmyc. α4LG4 module was expressed also in Escherichia coli as a GST fusion protein. For this, a cDNA fragment corresponding to nt 4357–4908 was prepared by PCR of pEFα4myc using a forward primer tagged with an extra 5′ BamHI sequence and a reverse primer tagged with an extra 5′ EcoRI sequence. The amplified fragment was digested with BamHI and EcoRI and inserted into corresponding sites of pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Site-directed mutagenesis was accomplished with Quick Change Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene). For H1518A mutation, paired primers of 5′-CTGTTCTTGGCCGCGGGTCGCTTGGTC-3′ and 5′-GACCAAGCGACCCGCGGCCAAGAACAG-3′ were used. For R1520A mutation, paired primers of 5′-CCTGTTCTTGGCCCATGGTGCGTTGGTCTTTATGTTTAATG-3′ and 5′-CATTAAACATAAAGACCAACGCACCATGGGCCAAGAACAGG-3′ were used. dhfr-deficient CHO DG44 cells (provided by Dr. Lawrence Chasin, Columbia University, New York) were used for overexpression of mouse α1LG1–LG5 and α4LG1–LG5 domains. Cells were maintained in α-minimal essential medium containing nucleosides and deoxynucleosides, and supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. Once the stable transfectants were established, α-minimal essential medium without nucleosides and deoxynucleosides was used. To check for N-glycosylation of G domains, cells were allowed to attach to culture dishes, washed with Dulbecco's modified PBS, and fed with fresh medium containing 10 μg/ml tunicamycin. After 12 h, cell lysates and conditioned media were analyzed by immunoblot using antiserum against c-Myc (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-789). Cells were transfected with the plasmids together with pGEMSVdhfr encoding a DHFR minigene (provided by Dr. Hiroshi Teraoka, Shionogi Research Laboratory, Osaka, Japan) by calcium-phosphate precipitation. Selection for stable transfectants and subsequent amplification of the introduced cDNA were carried out as described (35Kaufman R.J. Wasley L.C. Davies M.V. Wise R.J. Israel D.I. Dorner A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1233-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Expression levels of recombinant G domains were monitored by dot immunoassay of conditioned media with antiserum against c-Myc. Conditioned medium (about 500 ml each) of α1LG1–LG5 or α4LG1–LG5 expressing cells was harvested and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min to remove cell debris. The supernatant was adjusted to 0.5 mm N-ethylmaleimide, and applied to a 5-ml heparin affinity column (HiTrap, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; 3 ml/min) equilibrated in 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 150 mmNaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm N-ethylmaleimide (buffer A). For efficient binding, the flow-through was recycled about 5 times. Elution was carried out on a FPLC system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The column was washed with 30 ml of buffer A, eluted at 0.5 ml/min with a 150-ml linear gradient of 150 to 600 mm NaCl in buffer A, and 2.5-ml fractions were collected. Protein concentration in the fractions was determined with the BCA assay (Pierce) with BSA as standard. Purity and amount of recombinant protein was monitored by SDS-gel electrophoresis in 8% acrylamide gels under reducing conditions (20-μl aliquots). Pure fractions were combined, concentrated up to 0.4 mg/ml, and desalted using Centriprep-30 concentrators (Amicon). 500 ml of medium yielded about 3 mg of purified α1LG1–LG5 or α4LG1–LG5. Three 1-ml HiTrap heparin columns A, B, and C were equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 2 mmEDTA (buffer B) and loaded with 0.3 mg each of purified α4LG1–LG5. After washing with 3 ml of buffer B, column A was further washed with 3 ml of buffer B while the others were washed with 3 ml of buffer B containing 8 m urea. Columns A and C were then washed with 3 ml of buffer B while column B was washed with 3 ml of buffer B containing 8 m urea. Elution was performed on a FPLC system (0.1 ml/min) with a 30-ml linear gradient from 0 to 800 mmNaCl in buffer B for columns A and C, and in 8 m urea containing buffer B for column B. Proteins of 1-ml fractions were precipitated by 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid, pellets were washed with acetone, and dissolved in SDS sample buffer. Purified α4LG1–LG5 (1.2 mg) was digested at 37 °C with 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone-treated α-chymotrypsin (Sigma C-3142) or l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (Sigma T-8642) at a 1:50 enzyme/substrate ratio for 2 h. Digestion was stopped by addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to a final concentration of 1 mm. The digest was applied to a 1-ml Hi-trap heparin column. The column was washed with 6 ml of buffer A, bound protein was eluted on a FPLC system with a 30-ml linear gradient from 150 to 700 mm NaCl in buffer A, and 1-ml fractions were collected. For SDS-gel electrophoresis, fractions were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid as described above. Alternatively, digestion with trypsin was carried out after binding to a heparin column. Purified α4LG1–LG5 (0.4 mg) was bound to a 1-ml heparin column, and 15 μg of trypsin dissolved in 1 ml of 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2 was applied to the column. The column was incubated for 2 h at 37 °C and connected to a FPLC system. After washing with 6 ml of buffer A, the column was eluted (0.1 ml/min) with a 25-ml linear gradient from 150 to 600 mm NaCl in buffer A, and 1-ml fractions were collected. For Tricine-gel electrophoresis, fractions were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid as described. After electrophoresis, separated peptides were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250. Corresponding parts of the membrane were cut out, and the peptides were sequenced from the N terminus (36Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). N-Glycans of α4LG1–LG5 were cleaved with PNGase F (BioLabs) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 15 μl of enzyme solution and 30 μl of × 10 G7 buffer (500 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5) were added to purified protein (75 μg in 250 μl) and incubated at 37 °C overnight. As a control, 15 μl of water instead of the enzyme solution was used on a separate sample. After appropriate dilution, the digest was directly used for immunoblot and heparin binding analysis. Solid-phase assays were carried out as described with slight modification (37Aumailley M. Wiedemann H. Mann K. Timpl R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 184: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Multiwell plates (96 wells; Nunc) were incubated with 10 μg/ml heparin-BSA (Sigma) in 15 mmNa2CO3, 35 mm NaHCO3(pH 9.2), and 3 mm NaN3 as the first ligand for 18 h at 4 °C. Wells were then blocked with 1% (w/v) BSA in 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2 (blocking buffer) at room temperature for 2 h. After washing five times with 0.04% Tween 20 in PBS (10 mm Na2HPO4, 2 mmK2HPO4, 140 mm NaCl, and 3 mm KCl; washing buffer), wells were incubated with α1LG1–LG5 or α4LG1–LG5 serially diluted with blocking buffer as the second ligand. After incubation for 2 h at 4 °C, wells were washed five times with washing buffer, and the bound G domain was incubated with antiserum against α1LG1–LG5, α4LG1–LG5, or c-Myc with dilutions of 1:1000, 1:1000, or 1:400, respectively. After washing five times with washing buffer, bound antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) followed by addition of 0.4 mg/mlo-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (Sigma) dissolved in 50 mm phosphate citrate buffer and 0.01% H2O2. The reaction was stopped with 3m HCl. Color yields were determined at 492 nm in a Microplate Reader (Bio-Rad, Model 3550-UV). One-hundred and 16 peptides (A4G1–116) covering α4LG1–LG5 were designed according to the deduced amino acid sequenced in Ref. 33Liu J. Mayne R. Matrix Biol. 1996; 15: 433-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar. Twenty-four peptides (A4G74–97) corresponding to α4LG4 module and two control peptides (A4G82S and A4G82T) were synthesized by the 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) strategy and purified by high performance liquid chromatography as described previously (38Nomizu M. Kuratomi Y. Malinda K.M. Song S.Y. Miyoshi K. Otaka A. Powell S.K. Hoffman M.P. Kleinman H.K. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32491-32499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Purity and identity of the peptides were confirmed by an analytical high performance liquid chromatography and an ion spray mass spectrometer, respectively. Either of the synthetic peptides (21 μg), α4LG1–LG5 (3.4 μg) and heparin-Sepharose CL-6B beads (1 mg) were mixed in 70 μl of 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl. After incubation for 1 h at 4 °C, the mixture was loaded on an open column. Beads were flashed three times with 100 μl of the same buffer. Bound protein was extracted with SDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-gel electrophoresis. GST fusion proteins of α4LG4 module and the mutants were extracted fromE. coli by sonication in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 2 mm EDTA. The extract (5 ml) was applied to a heparin-Sepharose CL-6B column of 0.5 ml equilibrated with the same buffer. For efficient binding, the flow-through fraction was reloaded three times. The column was washed with 5 ml of the buffer and eluted with 5 ml each of the buffer containing 100, 200, 400, 500, 600, and 1000 mm NaCl. 10 μl of the fractions was analyzed by immunoblot. SDS-gel electrophoresis was performed using 8 or 12% acrylamide gels as described (39Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206597) Google Scholar). Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Samples were dissolved in SDS sample buffer with or without 2% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol. Tricine-gel electrophoresis was carried out as described (40Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10456) Google Scholar) followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250. For immunoblot analysis, proteins were transferred to Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and the membrane was blocked with 5% (w/v) skim milk in PBS (immunoblot blocking buffer) at room temperature for 2 h. After washing five times with 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS (immunoblot washing buffer), the membrane was incubated at room temperature for 2 h with antiserum against α1LG1–LG5, α4LG5, synthetic peptide having the sequence in α4LG5, c-Myc, or GST diluted in immunoblot blocking buffer 1:1000 or 1:400 as the first antibody. After further washing, the membrane was incubated at room temperature for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) diluted in immunoblot blocking buffer to 1:1000 as the second antibody. ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were used for developing. Antisera against α4LG1–LG5, α4LG1–LG5, and GST were raised by injecting the purified proteins into rabbits. Antiserum against a synthetic peptide LDESFNIGLKFEI (residues 1652–1665 of mouse α4) was raised as described (29Niimi T. Kumagai C. Okano M. Kitagawa Y. Matrix Biol. 1997; 16: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). dhfr-deficient CHO cells were transfected with plasmids encoding the G domains of mouse laminin α1 (α1LG1–LG5) and α4 (α4LG1–LG5) chains, respectively, together with a dhfr minigene (pGEMSVdhfr) (Fig.1). Cells overexpressing and secreting the G domains into the medium were selected among the clones resistant to increasing concentrations of methotrexate by dot-blot immunoassay using anti-c-Myc antiserum. To test for N-glycosylation of α4LG1–LG5 and α4LG1–LG5 in selected clones, media samples and lysates of cells grown in the presence and absence of tunicamycin were analyzed by SDS-gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting with antiserum against c-Myc (Fig. 2 A). Faster migration of the major band of ∼120 kDa in the presence of tunicamycin indicatesN-glycosylation of both α1LG1–LG5 and α4LG1–LG5. When compared with α4LG1–LG5, the larger migration difference observed for the tunicamycin-treated and untreated α1LG1–LG5 might reflect the different number of potential N-glycosylation sites (7 in α1LG1–LG5; 4 in α4LG1–LG5; compare Fig. 1). In contrast to the α1LG1–LG5 expressing cells, tunicamycin treatment of the α4LG1–LG5 expressing cells nearly completely blocked α4LG1–LG5 secretion. Detection of several distinct minor bands migrating faster than the full-length LG1–LG5 modules in the cell lysates suggests intracellular degradation of intermediates. Some degradation was also observed for the secreted proteins. Analysis of conditioned medium by SDS-gel electrophoresis performed under reducing or nonreducing conditions shows an increased mobility of the non-reduced α4LG1–LG5, whereas the migration position of the major part of α1LG1–LG5 remained unaffected (Fig. 2 B). This suggests a more compact configuration for the oxidized α4LG1–LG5 due to intrachain disulfide bonds, although the upward smear seen in the non-reduced sample could be due to some heterogeneity. The unchanged mobility observed for most of α1LG1–LG5 might indicate incomplete disulfide bond formation; the weak band migrating faster under non-reducing conditions might reflect a minor population with more disulfide bonds. α1LG1–LG5 and α4LG1–LG5 were purified by heparin affinity chromatography. Applying a linear gradient, the α1LG1–LG5 and α4LG1–LG5 eluted at salt concentrations of 300 and 470 mm, respectively, and analysis of column fractions by SDS-gel electrophoresis showed major bands in the migration positions of full-length G domains (Fig. 3). For both proteins, minor bands could bee seen at positions corresponding to about 50–60 kDa which on immunoblots were recognized by α1LG1–LG5- or α4LG1–LG5-specific antisera (not shown). Addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to the medium directly after harvesting reduced the amount of these contaminants suggesting that serine protease(s) produced by CHO cells digested the products. The differential heparin affinity of such fragments as especially observed for α4LG1–LG5 suggests that some subdomains contain high and low affinity binding sites. Binding of G domains to solid-phase heparin confirmed the high affinity of the α4 G domain (Fig. 4). Serially diluted α1LG1–LG5 or α4LG1–LG5 was incubated with heparin bound to the surface of multiwell plates. The concentrations required for half-maximal binding determined with specific antisera were 14 and 1.4 nm for α1LG1–LG5 and α4LG1–LG5, respectively. Antiserum against the c-Myc tag resulted in the same values confirming that the higher affinity of α4LG1–LG5 was not due to different titers of antisera. The half-maximal concentration determined for α1LG1–LG5 is in the same range as previously reported (19Talts J.F. Andac Z. Göhring W. Brancaccio A. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 863-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). When the same experiments were performed in the presence of 5 mmCa2+, no measurable changes for heparin affinity were observed for α4LG1–LG5 (data not shown). The results in Fig. 5show that N-glycan in α4LG1–LG5 is not essential for its high affinity binding to heparin. To remove N-linked carbohydrates, α4LG1–LG5 was treated with PNGase F. When analyzed by gel electrophoresis, more than 80% of the product migrated in a comparable position as the intracellular precursor produced in the presence of tunicamycin (Fig. 5 A). Despite the extensive digestion of N-glycans, α4LG1–LG5 retained its high affinity to solid-phase heparin indicating that this activity is not mediated by carbohydrates (Fig. 5 B). To determine whether the heparin binding activity depends on the native structure of α4LG1–LG5, de- and renaturation experiments with urea were performed. Three heparin columns A, B, and C were loaded with equal amounts of protein (Fig. 6). W"
https://openalex.org/W1982177011,"Orotidine 5′-phosphate (OMP) decarboxylase has the largest rate enhancement for any known enzyme. For an average protein of 270 amino acids from more than 80 species, only 8 amino acids are invariant, and 7 of these correspond to ligand-binding residues in the crystal structures of the enzyme from four species. It appears that the chemistry required for catalysis determines the invariant residues for this enzyme structure. A motif of three invariant amino acids at the catalytic site (DXKXXD) is also found in the enzyme hexulose-phosphate synthase. Although the core of OMP decarboxylase is conserved, it has undergone a variety of changes in subunit size or fusion to other protein domains, such as orotate phosphoribosyltransferase, during evolution in different kingdoms. The phylogeny of OMP decarboxylase shows a unique subgroup distinct from the three kingdoms of life. The enzyme subunit size almost doubles from Archaea (average mass of 24.5 kDa) to certain fungi (average mass of 41.7 kDa). These observed changes in subunit size are produced by insertions at 12 sites, largely in loops and on the exterior of the core protein. The consensus for all sequences has a minimal size of <20 kDa.

The consensus for all sequences has a minimal size of <20 kDa. orotidine 5′-monophosphate barbiturate 5′-monophosphate phosphoribosyl- transferase Orotidine 5′-monophosphate (OMP) decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.23) catalyzes the synthesis of UMP in the final reaction of the de novo pathway for the biosynthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides (Scheme FS1). Since all other pyrimidine nucleotides can be derived from UMP, this enzyme appears essential to all organisms (1Traut T.W. Jones M.E. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1996; 53: 1-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and it has now been sequenced from over 80 species. We present an analysis of this diverse set of sequences that demonstrates that, even while the subunit size has almost doubled in some species, a core set of important amino acids has remained invariant or highly conserved. This apparent structural flexibility is of interest since this enzyme has the currently greatest observed rate enhancement, defined ask cat/k non, by a factor of 1017 (2Radzicka A. Wolfenden R. Science. 1995; 267: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). The remarkable catalytic proficiency of OMP decarboxylase results from the exceptional stability of the carboxyl group of OMP, since the uncatalyzed decarboxylation of OMP has at ½ of 78 million years. This then makes it more significant that this enzyme has no cofactors (3Miller B.G. Smiley J.A. Short S.A. Wolfenden R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23841-23843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and makes interpretation of the catalytic mechanism a challenge. Four high quality crystal structures of OMP decarboxylase were recently produced: one from Archaea (Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum; Ref. 8Wu M. Mo Y. Gao J. Pai E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2017-2022Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), two from the EubacteriaBacillus subtilis (9Appleby T. Kinsland C. Begley T. Ealick S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2005-2010Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and Escherichia coli (10Harris P. Poulsen J.-C.N. Jensen K.F. Larsen S. Biochemsitry. 2000; 39: 4217-4224Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and one from a eukaryote, Saccharomyces cerevisiae (11Miller B.G. Hassell A.M. Wolfenden R. Milburn M.V. Short S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2011-2016Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). These enzymes were bound to the product UMP (9Appleby T. Kinsland C. Begley T. Ealick S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2005-2010Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) or to tight binding transition state analogs (8Wu M. Mo Y. Gao J. Pai E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2017-2022Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 10Harris P. Poulsen J.-C.N. Jensen K.F. Larsen S.

A. 2000; 97: 2011-2016Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). This enables a comparison of the amino acid residues in these structures shown to be necessary for ligand binding with the amino acids that are found to be invariant or highly conserved in all available sequences. Consistent with the demands dictated by the chemistry for this proficient reaction, the amino acid residues that have been maintained as invariant across all kingdoms of life are almost completely those that are essential for catalysis. Furthermore, the recent abundance of OMP decarboxylase sequence data has made it practical to define the phylogeny of this essential enzyme in comparison to earlier phylogenetic analyses. Work by Woese and colleagues (4Woese C.R. Fox G.E. Proc. Natl. Acd. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5088-5090Crossref PubMed Scopus (2342) Google Scholar, 5Woese C.R. Gutell R. Gupta R. Noller H.F. Microbiol. Rev. 1983; 47: 621-669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) led to the widely used ribosomal RNA sequences as a reference standard, since this molecule is an essential and presumably original component of the oldest organisms. Efforts have also been made to use proteins for this purpose. Since no single protein had been sequenced in enough organisms, Doolittle et al. (6Doolittle R. Feng D.-F. Tsang S. Cho G. Little E. Science. 1996; 271: 470-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar) chose to use 57 different proteins, for each of which sequences existed from at least four species. Their results show that phylogenetic relationships are not too dissimilar from relationships based on RNA, but their time scale for important divergence points was significantly different than for trees based on RNA studies. An element of uncertainty has entered the recently developed paradigm for a tree of life with the findings that genes may be transferred laterally between species. Comparison of the complete genomes ofMethanococcus jannashii, E. coli,Synechocystis 6803, and S. cerevisiae suggested that lateral transfer may have been on a large scale (7Rivera M.C. Jain R. Moore J.E. Lake J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6239-62444Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). The authors detected a pattern for two classes of genes: informational(maintenance and expression of DNA, and signaling), andoperational (enzymes of general metabolism). For yeast, informational genes were most closely related to M. jannashii (Archaea), while operational genes were closer toE. coli (bacteria). If transfer of genes between very different species is at all extensive, then no single gene (molecule) may serve as a unique reference standard to define any tree of life. It may then be necessary to have more such reference standards. Proteins that have an essential function, such as OMP decarboxylase, are good candidates for this role. The enzyme activity has been widely detected (1Traut T.W. Jones M.E. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1996; 53: 1-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and this implies that new sequences will continue to become available to help phylogenetic analyses. The amino acid sequences for all defined OMP decarboxylases were obtained from standard data bases. A majority of sequences is available in Swiss-Prot; a few sequences were found by BLAST searches of GenBank, and then translated. These latter sequences could be verified as true OMP decarboxylase sequences by the location of a critical motif, DXKXXDI XX T, where the uppercase letters represent invariant residues, Xis any residue, and the two underlined letters are almost invariant, being present in all but 2 or 3 of 82 sequences (see Fig. 1). Sequences were initially aligned with the program Pileup of the University of Wisconcsin Computer Group (GCG9). Since nine of these sequences are contained in a bifunctional UMP synthase, the OMP decarboxylase portion was identified by comparison to the consensus for all the monofunctional OMP decarboxylase sequences. For phylogenetic analyses a final alignment was obtained with the program CLUSTAL X (12Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (54899) Google Scholar,13Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 24: 4876-4882Crossref Scopus (35074) Google Scholar). An evolutionary tree was constructed using the PHYLIPfitch program (14Felsenstein J. Cladistics. 1989; 5: 164-166Google Scholar), from evolutionary distances calculated with the PHYLIP protdist program. Fig. 1 presents 13 representative sequences selected from an alignment of 82 OMP decarboxylase plus 11 hexulose-phosphate synthase sequences. The first 11 sequences are OMP decarboxylases. Because most of the signature motif (DXKXXDIXXT; evident at amino acid residues 145–154) was also located in sequences for hexulose-phosphate synthase, two sequences for this additional enzyme complete the listing in Fig. 1. An effort was made to use sequences representative of the taxonomic subgroups, while also including the range for subunit size and diversity. This alignment also illustrates that there are 11 consensus sequence segments, which define the secondary structure elements of the α/β barrel core structure (8Wu M. Mo Y. Gao J. Pai E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2017-2022Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 9Appleby T. Kinsland C. Begley T. Ealick S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 2000; 97: 2011-2016Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Inserts of varying sizes occur throughout the sequence, and always at positions where there are loops in the protein structures. In the key signature sequence at residues 145–154, the Asp, Lys, and Asp are absolutely invariant, suggesting that they were likely to be involved in the catalytic mechanism. Also invariant are an aspartate at position 59, a lysine at position 110, a glycine at 399, a glutamine at 422, and an arginine at 446. The position numbers are based on the alignment in Fig. 1, but all the individual enzymes are actually smaller, as shown next to their species name. Since alignment programs allow some gaps to optimize the alignment, the result shown in Fig. 1was visually adjusted to have Glu422 become invariant, aided by the information from the four crystal structures. These are yeast OMP decarboxylase bound to barbiturate monophosphate (BMP) (11Miller B.G. Hassell A.M. Wolfenden R. Milburn M.V. Short S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In each of these structures, 9–11 amino acids make important hydrogen bonds to the ligand at the catalytic site; the 9 consensus residues are indicated in Fig. 1 by symbols for hydrogen bonding (closedor open circles). Up to 6 other amino acids bind to a few of these amino acids that bind the nucleotide ligand directly, and help to stabilize them. Only one of these is at a consensus position (Asp145). Thus, of these 10 consensus residues shown to be necessary in the four crystal structures, 7 of them are at an invariant position in Fig. 1 (shown in bold), and the other three are at very conserved residues (in italic). The invariant amino acids tend to be at the ends of β strands, or in loops. Only Thr154 and Arg446 are in a helix. These results show the importance of the overall core α/β barrel structure, as well as the few essential amino acids therein. While 9 of the 10 residues shown by the four crystal structures to participate in binding were predicted in the sequence alignment, each of the structures also shows one or more additional amino acids that have a secondary role at the catalytic site, but these are not at the same position in the sequence alignment. This limited variety may be due to actual variations in the separate structures, and/or the somewhat different nucleotide ligands being bound. The usefulness and limits of such an alignment analysis become apparent. Fig. 2 depicts the yeast protein structure, and the specific residues involved in binding to the substrate analog BMP (11Miller B.G. Hassell A.M. Wolfenden R. Milburn M.V. Short S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2011-2016Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Of 7 amino acids whose side chains bind directly to BMP, 5 are invariant for more than 80 different species (Asp59, Lys147, Asp150, Gln422, Arg446) and one is highly conserved (Thr154). However, although 5 additional amino acids make side chain contacts to stabilize other amino acids that bind BMP, only 2 of these are invariant (Lys110, Asp145), while the other 3 are not even conserved (residues 57, 176, and 311). Of the many loops in the crystal structures, three are specifically identified in Fig. 1 and are known to participate at the catalytic site. OMP decarboxylases in the four protein structures, as well as in man, or mouse are normally dimeric (1Traut T.W. Jones M.E. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1996; 53: 1-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). An important structural feature that could not be anticipated from the sequence alignment is that the catalytic site is formed by segments of the two adjoining subunits in the four enzyme structures. Thus, loop A on one subunit containing Asp150–Thr154 connects across the dimer interface to complete the catalytic site made by residues Asp145 and Lys147 plus other amino acids shown in Fig. 3. Therefore, one half of the signature motif (Asp145-X-Lys147-X-X-Asp150-Ile151-X-X-Thr154) contributes to the catalytic site of one subunit in the functional dimer, while the second half of this motif contributes to the catalytic site of the adjoining subunit. Given the close spacing of these key residues in the primary sequence, it was not anticipated that they could contribute to separate catalytic sites on different subunits. However, this significant result for the active site architecture corroborates earlier kinetic studies, which showed that only the dimer form of OMP decarboxylase was catalytically competent (15Traut T.W. Payne R.C. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 6068-6074Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Thus, the recently obtained crystal structures (8Wu M. Mo Y. Gao J. Pai E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2017-2022Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 9Appleby T. Kinsland C. Begley T. Ealick S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 2000; 97: 2011-2016Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) are entirely consistent with these earlier kinetic studies. Two loops (loops B and C, Fig. 4) tend to be poorly defined in the apoenzyme, but clearly close over the catalytic pocket when a ligand is bound, and each loop contains a residue needed for binding (Fig. 1). Loops A and B appear to be constant in size, while Loop C is clearly variable, as defined in TableI. It is evident that this loop has a minimal size in Archaea, but is much larger in other species. Since the structure from M. thermoautotrophicum (Archaea) is the only structure showing water molecules at the active site (8Wu M. Mo Y. Gao J. Pai E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2017-2022Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), it appears that this loop functions to exclude water where this loop is large enough (11Miller B.G. Hassell A.M. Wolfenden R.

Truncation 2 is truncation 1 minus insert 7. Open table in a new tab Fig. 1 also shows three highly conserved amino acids that are not found to be involved in binding a ligand, and therefore may only be needed for part of the structure: Ile151, Pro398, and Gly399. Thus, of 12 amino acids identified in the sequence alignment, 9 of these are shown to be involved in the active site of the crystal structures. Of the 9 amino acids shown in the structures to be specifically involved in binding a ligand, 7 of these were apparent in the sequence alignment presented in Fig. 1. A phylogenetic analysis of the OMP decarboxylase sequences (Fig. 4) is in general fairly consistent with earlier evolutionary trees. Four large clusters are evident. Three of these correspond to the well established taxonomic kingdoms Archaea, Eubacteria, and Eukaryota. However, a quite distinct fourth group is evident; designated as “Mixed,” this group consists mainly of four mycobacteria, two members of the Thermus/Deinococcus group and one myxobacterium. More surprisingly, included in this group is one multicellular eukaryote, Trypanosoma cruzi. Since all other eukaryotes group well together, and at quite a distance from the mycobacterial subgroup, it may well be that the inclusion of T. cruzi in this subgroup is an example of lateral gene transfer. Among the eukaryotes, the multicellular species Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster are farther outliers from the main cluster than the simple slime moldDictyostelium discoideum. Also of interest is that the many fungi in this data set show as much or more diversity than all the multicellular eukaryotes. In examining the subunit sizes of OMP decarboxylases from the different species, it was evident that the Archaea had a distinctly smaller protein than the eukaryotes. When all proteins were analyzed for their size versus evolutionary distance from Aeropyrum pernix (Archaea), it became evident that the subunit size varied almost 2-fold from Archaea to the Pyrenomycetes fungi, and there appeared to be a modest correlation of increasing protein size with evolutionary distance from A. pernix (Fig.5 A). Since no unique functions or benefits have been described for the larger proteins, the data were reanalyzed by subtracting for each protein sequence the variable extensions at the N and C termini (Fig. 1, inserts 1, 2, and 12), as well as the single large insert of the Pyrenomycetes fungi, an example of which is insert 7 for Neurospora crassa at residues 195–299 (Fig. 1). The replot for this set of truncated sequences now shows much less variation in size (Fig. 5 B). The horizontal line suggests an average subunit size for the core domain of about 228 amino acids, with a variation of about 25 amino acids from this mean. This variation represents the remaining smaller inserts in the different species (see Table I). If only those residues for all species that are consistently present at any given position were used for this plot (the minimal consensus), the data set would reduce to about 180 amino acids. This would then be the smallest core domain, with a mass <20 kDa. A detailed analysis of all 12 insert positions for the major phylogenetic groups is listed in Table I. Insert numbers correspond to those in Fig. 1. Inserts 1 and 2, where they occur in the four structures, are separate helices, while insert 12 extends the final helix in these proteins (Fig. 3). Insert 2 is the immediate N-terminal addition found in almost all sequences. Since a few species have no insert 2, and since for Eubacteria insert 2 is fairly small, it is interpreted here as an early extension at the N terminus. Only the eukaryotes have an additional N-terminal extension, insert 1, which is generally in the 16–23-amino acid range (see Table I). The average size for most inserts is quite small. This reflects the fact that, for a given subgroup, only a few member species actually have an insert at that position. The inclusion of standard deviation values in Table Ishows that these values are often zero, indicating no variation in insert size, and this suggests that the function of many loops at which inserts occur may place a constraint on the size of the insert at a given position. The analysis of insert variations and their effect on subunit size is summarized in Table II. Thus, the average subunit for all species contains 270 amino acids. Eliminating the N- and C-terminal inserts produces a core subunit of 237 amino acids. Such an average core protein still contains many small inserts; by comparison, for Archaea alone the core size would only be 207 amino acids. If no inserts of any size are included, then the value for the minimal consensus sequence is ≥178 amino acids.Table IIScaling the core subunit size of OMP decarboxylaseGroupProteinAmino acidsno.All ODCasesNative270All ODCasesCore237ArchaeaCore207Consensus sequenceCore≥178 Open table in a new tab An additional level of complexity in the evolution of OMP decarboxylase is that the gene for this enzyme became fused with a second gene in all multicellular eukaryotes studied (Fig.6). The second gene always codes for orotate phosphoribosyl-transferase (orotate PRTase), the enzyme that immediately precedes OMP decarboxylase in the pathway for the de novo synthesis of UMP, so that the fused gene now codes for a bifunctional protein designated as UMP synthase (1Traut T.W. Jones M.E. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1996; 53: 1-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Since the arrangement of the fused genes, or of their protein domains, is commonly with the orotate PRTase preceding OMP decarboxylase, and since it is found in the slime mold D. discoideum, this fusion presumably occurred once at the beginning of the metazoan expansion, and has been stably maintained thereafter. Although T. cruzi also has a bifunctional UMP synthase, the domains are linked in the reverse order. The ready ability of the OMP decarboxylase to fuse with an orotate PRTase domain for a stable bifunctional UMP synthase is evident in the four protein structures. Each one shows that both the N terminus and C terminus extend side-by-side on one surface of the protein. These termini are evident at the lower right of the subunit structure in Fig. 3, or at the lower corners in Fig. 4. Therefore, linkage at either of these termini with orotate PRTase leads to a fairly similar overall structure for the bifunctional UMP synthase. This unusual pattern is again consistent with the origin of theT. cruzi OMP decarboxylase and UMP synthase being completely separate from all other eukaryotes. Since it has been proposed above that the acquisition of the OMP decarboxylase gene was by lateral transfer for this parasite, then the unusual reverse fusion with orotate PRTase (Fig. 6) may represent an independent event for the evolution of UMP synthases. An additional bifunctional protein containing OMP decarboxylase is suggested for Deinococcus radiodurans by the linkage of an open reading frame sequence that is 5′ to and contiguous with the coding sequence for OMP decarboxylase. The sequence of this putative protein domain, containing 315 amino acids, does not show significant identity with any of the orotate PRTases, and it remains unidentified. A BLAST search of GenBank with a bacterial OMP decarboxylase sequence identified the sequence for 3-hexulose-6-phosphate synthase (EC 4.1.2.X) from 11 species. This enzyme catalyzes the reversible aldol condensation shown in Scheme FS2, by which methanophile bacteria are able to incorporate one carbon compounds for biosynthesis of hexoses, which in turn are utilized for other pathways. It is very likely that the two enzymes diverged from a common ancestor, since of the 8 invariant amino acids in OMP decarboxylase, 5 are also found in hexulose-phosphate synthase at the corresponding position (last two sequence entries, Fig. 1). This enzyme from various methanophile bacteria is always an oligomer, although it may be a dimer (16Kato N. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 188: 397-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 17Yanase K. Ikeyama K. Mitsui R. Ra S. Kita K. Sakai Y. Kato N. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1996; 135: 201-205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a tetramer (18Müller R.H. Babel W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 188: 401-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), or a hexamer (19Ferenci T. Strøm T. Quayle J.R. Biochem. J. 1974; 144: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Since this enzyme also has the same unique motif found at the junction of the two subunits of OMP decarboxylase in forming the active site, then it would be consistent with the observed oligomer forms of hexulose-phosphate synthase for it to have a similar architecture for the catalytic site. Kinetic studies have emphasized that for hexulose-phosphate synthase divalent metals appear to be essential for activity, with Mg2+ and Mn2+ being equally effective, while other divalent cations had modest or no benefit (16Kato N. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 188: 397-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 18Müller R.H. Babel W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 188: 401-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 19Ferenci T. Strøm T. Quayle J.R. Biochem. J. 1974; 144: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, it was noted that this enzyme was somewhat unstable, and that the presence of metals improved stability for long term storage at −60 °C or short exposure to 60 °C (16Kato N. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 188: 397-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 18Müller R.H. Babel W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 188: 401-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 19Ferenci T. Strøm T. Quayle J.R. Biochem. J. 1974; 144: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Thus, it is not clear if the metals are essential for catalysis, or simply function in stabilizing the protein. The latter has been demonstrated as a benefit of metals in preparations with yeast OMP decarboxylase, although this enzyme does not require metals for activity (3Miller B.G. Smiley J.A. Short S.A. Wolfenden R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23841-23843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 20Cui W. DeWitt J. Miller S. Wu W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1999; 259: 133-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The results of such an extensive sequence analysis for a single gene support our emerging understanding of the conservation of protein structure during evolution. OMP decarboxylases from three kingdoms have now been defined as having an α/β barrel structure. By comparing those amino acids that are invariant or highly conserved across more than 80 species to the amino acids shown to be functional in the crystal structures, we see that through evolutionary divergence only the most structurally and functionally essential amino acids are conserved, and that amino acids identified by such an alignment are highly significant and most likely to be involved directly in catalysis. However, the validity of the above judgment is highly dependent on the size of the data base. Two papers analyzed OMP decarboxylase sequences available earlier, and found 48 invariant residues for a set of 17 sequences (21Radford A. J. Mol. Evol. 1993; 36: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), which became reduced to 10 invariant residues for a set of 20 sequences (22Kimsey H.K. Kaiser D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 819-824Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It must again be noted that on average such sequences code for 270 amino acids. In the present analysis, only 8 of these amino acids remain as invariant for 82 sequences, and 7 of these invariant residues participate in binding a transition state analog. Such a result is consistent with the hypothesis that invariant residues are chiefly specified by their essential role in the actual chemical reaction. What may be essential for this enzyme is the core α/β barrel structure, which is most likely very similar in all species. It is worth noting that inserts that occur at different positions of the sequence, and in different species, almost always occur in loops between elements of secondary structure (see Fig. 3). This suggests that such inserts are easily tolerated if they are on the outside of the core structure, and do not alter this core structure or sterically impede access of the ligands to the catalytic site. Thus, the single 100-amino acid insert shown for N. crassa (insert 7) may be viewed as a small domain attached to the side of the main α/β barrel core. Since at least seven species of fungi have retained this large insert, it may have a function yet to be discovered. The segments of consensus sequence generally have well defined boundaries (Fig. 1), and therefore defining the size of an insert between two such consensus segments is then not difficult. In a few cases, such boundaries are not as well defined, and we therefore set the boundary so as to accommodate the minimum sequence for any given species within such a segment. This may clearly influence the insert size shown for some species. Only the mycobacteria (mixed group, Table I) have evolved inserts at each of the 12 positions. All other species are lacking inserts at two or more of the 12 positions. No functions are currently known for any such insertions, and they may simply reflect a stochastic process that increases the size of transcribed RNA by various processes. The great variation in insert sizes and location suggests that such alterations with time of an ancestral protein core may be normal events that may confer no benefit, but are tolerated in the absence of any deficit. Although inserts may occur anywhere in the protein sequence, many of these may cause a harmful change in structure, and are therefore not maintained or observed. The increase in size with divergence distance from Archaea is produced by up to 12 inserts. About half of this size increase is produced by the three inserts that extend the N and C termini, and half of the increase is by all other inserts combined to the core of the protein. Inspection of the values for standard deviations in Table I suggests two possible patterns for such alterations in the protein's size. For the majority of inserts, the standard deviation is quite small. This would be consistent with a single insertion event, at a given position, and that divergence of species from that event occurred with minimal changes at that site. Where the standard deviation is quite large, as for insert 2 with Archaea, this represents an N-terminal extension that may have occurred separately in the different species (by alteration of the start codon), and therefore shows considerable diversity in the size of this extension. In addition to its ability to handle smaller inserts or additions to the core structure, the core domain itself is easily joined to at least two other protein domains (Fig. 6). With the demonstration thatT. cruzi can form UMP synthase in the alternate configuration (23Gao G. Nara T. Nakajima-Shimada J. Aoki T. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 149-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6), it becomes evident that in such gene fusions there must be adequate linker DNA to code for the connecting polypeptide between the two domains. This assumption is based on the fact that the OMP decarboxylase from yeast is only functional as a dimer. Kinetic studies obtained the same result for this enzyme activity in the mammalian UMP synthase, which adds further evidence that only the dimer is functional (15Traut T.W. Payne R.C. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 6068-6074Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 24Traut T.W. Payne R.C. Jones M.E. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 6062-6068Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the recent crystal structure (25Scapin G. Grubmeyer C. Sacchettini J.C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1287-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) of the bacterial orotate phosphoribosyltransferase presented a comparable architecture of an active dimer, since this enzyme also requires a loop from one subunit to form a part of the catalytic site of the adjacent subunit. Therefore, in the evolution of the bifunctional UMP synthase, the linkage of the two catalytic domains must be sufficiently extensive or flexible to permit each of the domains to align with its cognate domain in the adjacent UMP synthase subunit so that both the orotate phosphoribosyltransferase domains and the OMP decarboxylase domains can form functional catalytic sites across respective dimer interfaces. That this fusion of the same two genes occurred at least twice also suggests that some benefit is associated with the coupling of these two protein domains. Although the two domains of UMP synthase catalyze sequential metabolic steps, evidence for the strict channeling of the common metabolite (OMP) between the two domains was not observed (26Traut T.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 268: 108-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). However, with the ability to separately clone and express the two domains for the human UMP synthase, it was shown that the bifunctional protein has much greater stability than either of the independent catalytic domains (27Yablonski M.J. Pasek D.A. Han B.-D. Jones M.E. Traut T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10704-10708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and such a benefit may explain two different gene fusion events to produce UMP synthase. This latter finding also implies that some interaction must occur between the two different domains in UMP synthase to provide this observed stability."

The structures of the reactive intermediates formed upon UV irradiation of dTC and nicotine are unknown. Therefore, these photolabeling studies, while identifying residues contributing to the agonist sites, do not define the orientation of the drugs within the binding sites.In this report, we demonstrate that 4-benzoylbenzoylcholine (Bz2choline), which possesses a well defined photochemistry, can be used as a photoaffinity probe of the agonist-binding sites. As with other benzophenones, Bz2choline is activated by ultraviolet light at >320 nm, producing a C˙–O˙ diradical that can insert into C–H bonds but will not react with water (reviewed in Refs. 23Dorman G. Prestwich G.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5573-5661Crossref Scopus (766) Google Scholar, 24Kotzyba-Hibert F. Kapfer I. Goeldner M. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.

Photobiol. 1997; 65: 222-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Thus, proximity alone should determine which residues are covalently labeled, independent of the inherent reactivity of the amino acid side chains, which should enable Bz2choline to identify amino acids in proximity to the para position of a benzoylcholine ester when it is bound in the ACh-binding sites. We report here that Bz2choline is a competitive antagonist of the Torpedo nAChR binding with equal affinity (K D ∼1.4 μm) at the two ACh-binding sites. [3H]Bz2choline specifically photoincorporates into the nAChR γ- and δ-subunits with similar efficiencies, with specific incorporation within the α-subunit at no more than 10% the level in the γ- or δ-subunit. The primary sites of specific photoincorporation for [3H]Bz2choline are the homologous residues within Loop E of the non-α-subunits, γLeu-109 and δLeu-111.DISCUSSIONIn this paper we introduce [3H]Bz2choline as a novel antagonist photoaffinity probe of the nAChR. Bz2choline binds with high affinity (K D = 1 μm) to the two ACh sites, and its interaction with the ion channel domain is 1000-fold weaker, as judged by the inhibition of binding of [3H]H12-HTX. Whereas Bz2choline binding to the ACh site at the α-γ interface is 40-fold weaker than that of dTC (K H = 25 nm), it binds with similar affinity as dTC at the α-δ-binding site. Bz2choline is thus a potent competitive antagonist that upon UV irradiation will form a reactive intermediate of known structure (the excited state triplet ketone) that reacts via hydrogen abstraction and CH bond insertion (23Dorman G. Prestwich G.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5573-5661Crossref Scopus (766) Google Scholar). For TorpedonAChR-rich membranes equilibrated with [3H]Bz2choline, UV irradiation results in selective photoincorporation into γLeu-109 and the homologous residue in δ-subunit, δLeu-111, amino acids within Loop E of the ACh-binding sites. These results, which define the orientation in the ACh-binding site of the para position of this substituted benzoylcholine ester, provide a first definition of the orientation of a choline ester competitive antagonist when bound in the ACh site.When analyzed at the level of the intact subunits, [3H]Bz2choline was specifically photoincorporated into the nAChR γ- and δ-subunits at similar efficiencies, with specific incorporation into the α-subunit at less than 10% the efficiency of labeling of the γ- or δ-subunit. The inefficient labeling of the α-subunit was surprising. Whereas the sulfhydryl specificity of [3H]MBTA (4-(N-maleimido)-α-benzyltrimethylammonium) (41Kao P.N. Dwork A.J. Kaldany R.R. Silver M.L. Wideman J. Stein S. Karlin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11662-11665Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) restricts its reactivity to the α-subunits, containing the only known cysteines in the ACh-binding sites, the alkylating antagonist [3H]lophotoxin also reacted only with the α-subunits (42Abramson S.N. Li Y. Culver P. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12666-12672Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and for two competitive antagonist photoaffinity labels, photoincorporation in α-subunit either predominated ([3H]DDF (43Galzi J.L. Revah F. Bouet F. Menez A. Goeldner M. Hirth C. Changeux J.-P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5051-5055Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar)) or was at least at similar efficiency ([3H]dTC (3Pedersen S.E. Cohen J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2785-2789Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar)) as in the γ- or δ-subunit.Under equilibrium conditions with ACh sites fully occupied by [3H]Bz2choline, irradiation for 1 h resulted in specific photolabeling of ∼3–5% of γ- or δ-subunit. This efficiency of photolabeling was ∼10-fold higher than the labeling seen for [3H]dTC (3Pedersen S.E. Cohen J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2785-2789Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) or [3H]nicotine (12Middleton R.E. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6987-6997Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), but considerably lower than the stoichiometric labeling seen for benzophenone-based peptide photoaffinity probes of myosin light chain kinase (44Gao Z.-H. Zhi G. Herring B.P. Moomaw C. Deogny L. Slaughter C.A. Stull J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10125-10135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) or of many peptide hormone receptors (reviewed in Refs. 23Dorman G. Prestwich G.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5573-5661Crossref Scopus (766) Google Scholar and 25Prestwich G.D. Dorman G. Elliott J.T. Marecak D.M. Chaudhary A. Photochem. Photobiol. 1997; 65: 222-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar).Within the nAChR γ-subunit, ∼90% of 3H photoincorporation was inhibitable by Carb as well as dTC and α-BgTx. Thus the primary site of photolabeling is within the agonist-binding site. For the δ-subunit, whereas ∼70% of the 3H incorporation was inhibitable by Carb, it was not inhibited by α-BgTx. The origin of this difference was identified by analyzing the distribution of 3H in the δ-subunit fragments produced by EndoLys-C (Fig. 6). The 3H incorporation seen in the presence of α-BgTx was in an ∼10-kDa fragment distinct from the ∼20-kDa fragment that contains the Carb-inhibitable 3H incorporation in δ-subunit. The δ-subunit labeling seen in the presence of α-BgTx is likely to be within the ion channel domain, as it is inhibitable by tetracaine, and EndoLys-C is known to produce a 10-kDa fragment beginning at the amino terminus of δM2 (38Gallagher M.J. Cohen J.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 300-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). These data suggest that for nAChRs in the resting state, [3H]Bz2choline can be photoincorporated in the ion channel domain, most prominently in the δ-subunit. The low levels of 3H seen in the 10-kDa band for δ-subunit isolated from nAChRs labeled in the presence or absence of Carb indicate that there is little incorporation in this fragment when nAChRs are in the desensitized state (+Carb) and that, when [3H]Bz2choline occupies the agonist site, most nAChRs are probably in the desensitized state. Preferential photoincorporation in the ion channel domain in the closed channel state has also been seen for both [125I]TID (3-trifluoromethyl)-3-(m-[125I]iodophenyldiazirine (45White B.H. Cohen J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15770-15783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) and [3H]diazofluorene (46Blanton M.P. Dangott L.J. Raja S.K. Lala A.K. Cohen J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8659-8668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), whose efficiencies of photoincorporation are 10-fold higher in the resting state than in the desensitized state. Although [125I]TID was photoincorporated with similar efficiencies into the M2 segments of all subunits when nAChRs are in the resting state, [3H]diazofluorene was incorporated with high selectivity into δM2. Identification and characterization of these additional sites of [3H]Bz2choline photoincorporation are still in progress.To identify directly the amino acid(s) of the nAChR γ-subunit that were specifically photolabeled by [3H]Bz2choline, labeled γ-subunit was first digested with EndoLys-C which produced a 26-kDa fragment that was isolated and digested with V8 protease. This double digestion strategy was necessary to eliminate considerable contamination by the Na+/K+-ATPase β-subunit, which originates from contaminating membrane fragments present in the nAChR-rich membrane preparations and which has a mobility similar to the nAChR γ- and δ-subunits in our SDS-PAGE conditions (13Chiara D.C. Cohen J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32940-32950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Reversed-phase HPLC of the V8 protease digest isolated a 3H peak which contained a γ-subunit fragment beginning at γVal-102, and3H release in cycle 8 identified γLeu-109 as the primary site of [3H]Bz2choline photoincorporation in γ-subunit (Fig. 5). This conclusion was confirmed by radiosequence analysis of a chymotryptic digest of the labeled γVal-102 fragment which revealed 3H release in cycle 4 (i.e.cleavage after γTyr-105) and lack of 3H release in cycle 8 (Fig. 4). In addition, it was consistent with the fact that the labeled ∼12-kDa γ-subunit fragment produced by V8 protease also contained the site of endoglycosidase H-sensitive glycosylation in γ-subunit, γAsn-141 (15Chiara D.C. Xie Y. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6689-6698Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar).A similar approach was utilized to identify δLeu-111 as the primary site of agonist-inhibitable [3H]Bz2choline photoincorporation within the δ-subunit. Digestion with EndoLys-C produced labeled fragments of 20–29 kDa, which were isolated. Since γ-subunit was known to contaminate the δ-subunit isolated by preparative SDS-PAGE, the material isolated from the EndoLys-C digest could also contain the labeled γ-subunit fragment of similar mobility. The δ-subunit fragment was digested with EndoAsp-N to take advantage of the presence of δAsp-99. Sequence analysis of the peak of 3H from the reversed-phase HPLC separation of the EndoAsp-N digest revealed the presence of a fragment beginning at δAsp-99, and the major peak of 3H release was in cycle 13, consistent with labeling of δLeu-111, the homologous residue to γLeu-109 (Fig. 7). However, this HPLC fraction also contained fragments beginning at δAsp-76, γAsp-76, and γ-Glu-101 as well as a fragment from the Na+/K+-ATPase β-subunit, and there was 3H release in cycle 9 at a lower level than in cycle 13. Sequence analysis of the HPLC fractions on either side of the peak of 3H revealed that the mass levels of only the δAsp-99 fragment correlated with the level of 3H release in cycle 13 (Fig. 8). In addition, the levels of the fragment beginning at γGlu-101 did account for the 3H release seen in the ninth cycle of Edman degradation. Despite the fact that the δAsp-99 fragment was not isolated from the contaminating fragments, the data support the conclusion that δLeu-111 is the primary site of specific [3H]Bz2choline photoincorporation in δ-subunit.The levels of 3H incorporation in γLeu-109 (16 cpm/pmol) and δLeu-111 (∼8 cpm/pmol) in subunit fragments isolated from the same labeling experiment indicate that they are labeled at similar efficiencies and that [3H]Bz2choline is incorporated into ∼2–4% of the subunits at that position. The labeled 20–29-kDa fragments of the γ- and δ-subunits produced by EndoLys-C began at γGlu-47 and δGlu-47, and sequence analysis of those fragments allow direct estimation of the levels of [3H]Bz2choline incorporation in ACh-binding site Loop D, defined by γTrp-55 and Trp-57, the primary sites of [3H]dTC photoincorporation in the γ- and δ-subunits. No 3H release above background was detected while sequencing through γAsn-61 or δAla-61, which indicated that any incorporation in binding site Loop D is at <2% the efficiency of labeling of γLeu-109/δLeu-111.The selective photoincorporation of [3H]Bz2choline in γLeu-109 and δLeu-111 is striking. These are the first amino acids identified by affinity labeling within the nAChR agonist-binding sites other than Tyr, Trp, or Cys, amino acids with intrinsic side chain reactivity. Benzophenone affinity probes have been shown to react especially well with Met, but also with a wide variety of amino acids including Tyr, Ser, Gly, and Pro (24Kotzyba-Hibert F. Kapfer I. Goeldner M. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1995; 34: 1296-1312Crossref Scopus (383) Google Scholar). To our knowledge this is the first example of a benzophenone derivative reacting with a leucine residue within a native protein, presumably via CH bond insertion in the leucine side chain. Thus, the covalent incorporation of [3H]Bz2choline into γLeu-109/δLeu-111 certainly results from the proximity of the bound, excited state ketone with those amino acids. It is notable that there is no photolabeling of the adjacent γTyr-111/δArg-113 which in Torpedo nAChR have been identified by [3H]dTC affinity labeling and mutational analyses (15Chiara D.C. Xie Y. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6689-6698Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) as contributors to ACh-binding site Loop E. Also there is no photoincorporation in γMet-116/γTyr-117, positions that have been identified as dTC affinity determinants in the mouse nAChR γ-subunit (17Sine S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9436-9440Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar).In addition to the photoincorporation in γLeu-109/δLeu-111, there was also agonist-inhibitable photolabeling within α-subunit, albeit at <10% the efficiency in γ- or δ-subunit. Identification of the amino acids in the α-subunit that are also in proximity to photoactivated Bz2choline will further define proximity relations in the ACh-binding site.The results of photoaffinity labeling and mutational analyses have both provided consistent evidence that the ACh-binding sites are at subunit interfaces, with amino acids from γ- (or δ-) subunit making important contributions to binding sites for agonists and competitive antagonists. In contrast, available data concerning the structure of the nAChR based upon cryoelectron microscopy (1Miyazawa A. Fujiyoshi Y. Stowell M. Unwin N. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 765-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar) have been interpreted to suggest that ACh sites are within the α-subunits, with the non-α-subunits possibly contributing to the access way to the binding sites. The highly selective labeling of γLeu-109/δLeu-111, in conjunction with the lack of efficient specific labeling of any amino acids in the α-subunit, provides further evidence that amino acids from the non-α-subunits are directly involved in the structure of the ACh-binding sites. The Torpedo nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR)1 is composed of four homologous subunits in a stoichiometry of α2βγδ that associate pseudosymmetrically about a central axis that is the ion channel. Cryoelectron microscopic analyses of two-dimensional crystalline arrays of nAChRs provide a definition of three-dimensional structure approaching 5-Å resolution (1Miyazawa A. Fujiyoshi Y. Stowell M. Unwin N. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 765-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar), including a definition of changes in structure in the transmembrane region between closed and open channel states (2Unwin N. Nature. 1995; 373: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). Since there is as yet no direct identification of the path of the polypeptide chains or of the structure of the acetylcholine (ACh)-binding sites, our knowledge of the structure of the ACh-binding sites has been derived primarily from the results of affinity labeling and mutational analyses. The muscle type nAChR has two binding sites for agonists and competitive antagonists, located in the extracellular domain of the nAChR at the α-γ- and α-δ-subunit interfaces (3Pedersen S.E.

G protein-coupled receptor kinase adrenergic receptor Chinese hamster fibroblast guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate Desensitization, defined as a waning of a signal despite the presence of stimulus, is a common biological phenomenon. Many receptors that signal through guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) display desensitization in the presence of continuous agonist exposure (1Liggett S.B. Lefkowitz R.J. Sibley D. Houslay M. Regulation of Cellular Signal Transduction Pathways by Desensitization and Amplification. John Wiley & Sons, London1993: 71-97Google Scholar). Such regulation of receptor function is key to the cell being able to integrate the myriad of received signals in order to maintain homeostasis under a variety of physiologic and pathologic conditions. Receptor desensitization can be adaptive or maladaptive within the context of disease (2Bristow M.R. Lancet. 1998; 352: SI8-SI14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, the process can lead to clinical tachyphylaxis, which limits the therapeutic effectiveness of administered agonists (1Liggett S.B. Lefkowitz R.J. Sibley D. Houslay M. Regulation of Cellular Signal Transduction Pathways by Desensitization and Amplification. John Wiley & Sons, London1993: 71-97Google Scholar).The most rapid form of desensitization of G protein-coupled receptors is due to phosphorylation, leading to a decrease in coupling of the receptor to its cognate G protein. A family of serine/threonine protein kinases, termed G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs),1 serves to phosphorylate the agonist-occupied forms of these receptors, and are the kinases responsible for agonist-promoted (homologous) desensitization (3Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 692Crossref Scopus (1060) Google Scholar, 4Lohse M.J. Engelhardt S. Danner S. Bohm M. Basic Res. Cardiol. 1996; 91: 29-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Within the adrenergic receptor family, the β2-adrenergic (β2AR) and α2A-adrenergic (α2AAR) receptors have been extensively studied in regards to GRK-mediated phosphorylation and desensitization. For the β2AR, serines and threonines in the carboxyl-terminal tail of the receptor have been shown to be phosphorylated by one or more GRKs (5Hausdorff W.P. Bouvier M. O'Dowd B.F. Irons G.P.

For the α2AAR, four serines in the mid-portion of the third intracellular loop within the EESSSS motif, are the residues phosphorylated (7Liggett S.B. Ostrowski J. Chestnut L.C. Kurose H.

Allergy. 1991; 21: 269-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). For both receptors, the critical step to initiation of GRK-mediated phosphorylation is the attainment of the agonist-occupied or stabilized conformation, also termed the “active” conformation. Indeed, in the current model of GRK-mediated phosphorylation, the optimal conformation required for G protein coupling is considered the same as that required for GRK-mediated phosphorylation (3Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 692Crossref Scopus (1060) Google Scholar, 4Lohse M.J. Engelhardt S. Danner S. Bohm M. Basic Res. Cardiol. 1996; 91: 29-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Partial agonists, then, evoke receptor phosphorylation of the β2AR in direct proportion to their intrinsic activities (9Benovic J.L. Staniszewski C. Mayor Jr., F. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3893-3897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The α2ARs consist of three receptor subtypes, denoted α2A, α2B, and α2C. Each couple to the inhibitory G protein Gi, and thus serve to decrease adenylyl cyclase and intracellular cAMP levels in the cell (10Eason M.G. Kurose H. Holt B.D. Raymond J.R. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15795-15801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). While all three subtypes display similar Gi coupling, they differ in their propensity to undergo agonist-promoted phosphorylation and desensitization (11Liggett S.B. Adv. Pharmacol. 1998; 42: 438-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). We and others have shown in recombinant expressing cells that while α2A and α2Breceptors undergo short term agonist-promoted phosphorylation and desensitization, the α2C receptor does not (12Eason M.G.

Chem. 1996; 271: 18082-18087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This does not appear to be due to the lack of cellular expression of a particular GRK, as overexpression of GRKs 2, 3, 5, and 6 fail to evoke agonist-promoted phosphorylation of the α2CAR (14Jewell-Motz E.A. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18082-18087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Comparison of the sequences of the third intracellular loops of the α2A and α2C receptors (Fig. 1) shows that both have a number of serines and threonines in similar locations. While the α2C does not have the α2Asequence EESSS, which has been shown in vivo (15Eason M.G. Moreira S.P. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4681-4688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) andin vitro (16Onorato J.J. Palczewski K. Regan J.W. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Benovic J.L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5118-5125Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) to be an excellent substrate for GRK phosphorylation, it does have DESS within the mid-portion of the loop. We have considered that while the residues that might be phosphorylated by GRKs are present in both subtypes, the agonist-promoted intracellular milieu might be different between the two subtypes. This could thus be the basis of the differential phosphorylation of the two subtypes by agonist, rather than the presence or absence of phosphoacceptors per se. To address this, chimeric α2ARs were constructed which were composed of the α2A with substitution of the α2C third intracellular loop, and the α2C with substitution of the α2A third intracellular loop. These two chimera, along with the wild-type α2A and α2C receptors, were expressed in cells and agonist-promoted phosphorylation and desensitization studies undertaken.RESULTSThe results of radioligand binding studies are shown in TableI. The two wild-type receptors and the two chimeric receptors all bound [3H]yohimbine with high affinity. There were no differences between theKD for the α2A versusα2A(3LC), or the α2C versus α2C(3LA) receptor. Competition studies with the antagonist phentolamine revealed an ∼10-fold lower affinity for α2CAR compared with α2AAR. The respective chimeric receptors had affinities that were the same as the parent receptor, i.e.α2A(3LC) had the same affinity for phentolamine as α2AAR, and α2C(3LA) had the same affinity as α2CAR. These data indicate that substitution of the third intracellular loop had no significant conformational effect on the antagonist binding domains, which are localized within the transmembrane-spanning segments. The results from competition studies with the agonist epinephrine, however, revealed evidence of retrograde conformational effects of substituting the α2CAR third intracellular loop into the α2AAR. As shown in Table I, the K i for wild-type α2AAR for epinephrine was 347 ± 46 nm. Substitution of the α2CAR loop resulted in a decrease in affinity, with aK i of 1054 ± 52 nm for the α2A(3LC) receptor. The α2C(3LA) chimera had an epinephrine binding affinity that was not different than wild-type α2CAR (∼125 nm). A similar pattern was found with the agonist UK14304, except that only a ∼2-fold increase in K i occurred with the α2A(3LC) receptor (data not shown). The functional integrity of the receptors was determined in adenylyl cyclase assays, assessing the inhibition of forskolin-stimulated activity by epinephrine. Each chimeric receptor inhibited adenylyl cyclase by >65%, (TableII, (−) agonist column). Interestingly, the EC50 for epinephrine with the α2C(3LA) was lower than that for the other receptors.Table ILigand binding parameters of wild-type and chimeric receptorsα2Aα2A(3LC)α2Cα2C(3LA)K d, [3H]yohimbine1.9 ± 0.123.5 ± 0.432.8 ± 0.412.3 ± 0.13K i, phentolamine5.1 ± 0.457.6 ± 0.5965 ± 1678 ± 11K i, epinephrine347 ± 461054 ± 51*122 ± 14129 ± 25Radioligand binding was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Results are expressed in nanomolar and are from four independent experiments.

Open table in a new tab The above studies indicated that each of the chimeric receptors bound agonist with high affinity and functionally coupled to the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. Whole cell receptor phosphorylation studies were then undertaken to test our hypotheses concerning agonist-promoted phosphorylation. Cells expressing each hemagglutinin-tagged receptor were incubated with [32P]orthophosphate, treated with vehicle or the agonist epinephrine, and receptor-purified by immunoprecipitation using an epitope tag-specific antibody. Results of these studies are shown in Fig. 2. We obtained results similar to those that we previously reported for the two wild-type α2AAR and α2CAR (see Introduction). Thus, the α2AAR underwent agonist-promoted phosphorylation while the α2CAR did not. However, substitution of the α2CAR third intracellular loop into the α2AAR resulted in a receptor that underwent agonist-promoted phosphorylation equivalent to that of wild-type α2AAR. This strongly indicates that the third loop of the α2C has residues that can be phosphorylated, but that the intracellular milieu of the α2C outside of the third loop and/or the conformational changes in the loop, induced by agonist binding within the pocket established by the transmembrane-spanning domains, do not favor phosphorylation. In either case, one might predict that the α2AAR third loop would not undergo phosphorylation within the context of the α2CAR. This turned out to be so, as in parallel studies the α2C(3LA) receptor failed to undergo agonist-promoted phosphorylation (Fig. 2).Figure 2Agonist-promoted phosphorylation of wild-type and chimeric α2ARs. InA, a representative autoradiogram from a whole cell phosphorylation experiment is shown. In B, mean results from four independent experiments are shown. For the α2C and α2C(3LA) receptors, no receptor band was identified under basal or agonist-exposed conditions; thus, no quantitation is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We next considered whether these gain/loss phosphorylation phenotypes were also evident in functional (inhibition of adenylyl cyclase) desensitization studies. Cells in culture were exposed to vehicle or epinephrine, washed, membranes prepared, and agonist-mediated inhibition of forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activities determined. These results are shown in Table II and Fig.3. We have previously shown in recombinantly expressing CHW and Chinese hamster ovary cells that α2AAR undergo such desensitization, manifested by a 4–5-fold increase in the EC50 with little or no significant change in the maximal extent of adenylyl cyclase inhibition (12Eason M.G. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25473-25479Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, desensitization of α2CAR in Chinese hamster ovary cells is not observed under identical conditions. As shown, these phenotypes are also true in recombinantly expressing CHW cells. Of note, despite the fact that phosphorylation occurs with the α2A(3LC) receptor, no agonist-promoted desensitization of this receptor was detected (Fig. 3 C). Additionally, substitution of the α2AAR third loop into the α2CAR had no effect on the latter's lack of functional desensitization (Fig. 3 D).Figure 3Agonist-promoted desensitization of wild-type and chimeric α2ARs. Cells expressing the indicated receptor were treated with vehicle or epinephrine (Epi.) for 15 min, washed, membranes prepared, and agonist-promoted inhibition of forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activities determined. Only the α2AAR displayed desensitization, manifested by a rightward shift in the dose-response curve. Shown is a representative set of experiments. See Table II for mean results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The α2A and α2C receptors have highly similar first and second intracellular loops. The major difference in the short cytoplasmic tail is the lack of a palmitoylated cysteine of α2CAR. We have previously shown that this difference in the tail does not alter agonist-promoted desensitization (20Eason M.G. Jacinto M.T. Theiss C.T. Liggett S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11178-11182Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We thus considered that the conformation established by the transmembrane-spanning backbone of the parent receptor dictates phosphorylation status of the third intracellular loop. This hypothesis was further explored using agonists with substantial differences in structure. Since the extent of GRK2-mediated phosphorylation of the β2AR has been shown to be directly related to the agonist intrinsic activity (9Benovic J.L. Staniszewski C. Mayor Jr., F. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3893-3897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we first delineated the intrinsic activities of each agonist employed by measuring [35S]GTPγS binding. The agents ranged from being full agonists to weak partial agonists, with the lowest intrinsic activity being 0.06. Forpara-aminoclonidine, SKF43315, BHT920, and oxymetazoline, the extent of agonist-promoted phosphorylation appeared to be related to the intrinsic activity of the agonist (Fig.4). On the other hand, the α1AR agonist SKF89748, which displays weak partial agonist activity at the α2AAR (intrinsic activity = 0.06), evoked phosphorylation that was greater than the phosphorylation evoked by oxymetazoline, which has an intrinsic activity of 0.30. Additionally, UK14304, which was a full agonist, failed to promote phosphorylation to an extent similar to the other full agonist para-aminoclonidine, or the other near full agonists (Fig. 4). Taken together, it appears that phosphorylation of the α2AR evoked by agonist is highly sensitive to the conformation of the third intracellular loop induced/stabilized by agonist to such an extent that these properties dictate the extent of phosphorylation of the loop when phosphoacceptors are present, and are the basis for subtype-specific phosphorylation.Figure 4Agonist structure, not intrinsic activity, directs α2AAR phosphorylation.Intrinsic activities were determined in agonist-promoted [35S]GTPγS binding studies and are expressed as the fraction of the binding obtained for a given agonist compared with epinephrine. Agonist-promoted phosphorylation of α2AAR was determined in whole cell phosphorylation assays and expressed as the percentage of phosphorylation of a given agonist compared with that obtained with epinephrine. The concentrations of all agonists were 10 μm. OXY, oxymetazoline; PAC, para-aminoclonidine.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)DISCUSSIONAlthough short term agonist-promoted desensitization has been observed with many G protein-coupled receptors, about one-third of those tested appear not to display this regulatory behavior. One might consider, then, that certain cellular events controlled by some receptors are so critical that even under circumstances of prolonged agonist exposure receptor function is maintained.For the three α2AR subtypes, initial studies revealed similar binding affinities for endogenous catecholamines and similar functional coupling to the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase via Gi coupling. Subsequent studies have revealed important differences between the subtypes in regards to coupling to Gs (10Eason M.G. Kurose H. Holt B.D. Raymond J.R. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15795-15801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), stimulation of intracellular calcium (21Kukkonen J.P. Renvaktar A. Shariatmadari R. Akerman K.E. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

Chem. 1996; 271: 18082-18087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Desensitization of the α2AAR was found to be the most robust of the three subtypes, followed by the α2BAR (12Eason M.G. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25473-25479Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The α2CAR failed to display functional desensitization (12Eason M.G. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25473-25479Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or phosphorylation (13Kurose H. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10093-10099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) due to agonist exposure in recombinant cells. Site-directed mutagenesis of the human α2AAR has shown that agonist-promoted phosphorylation is confined to the third intracellular loop (7Liggett S.B. Ostrowski J. Chestnut L.C. Kurose H. Raymond J.R. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4740-4746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) at four serines (15Eason M.G. Moreira S.P. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4681-4688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) (residues 296–299, see Fig. 1). Each serine contributes ∼25% of the total phosphorylation. However, all four serines must be phosphorylated for agonist-promoted functional desensitization to occur (15Eason M.G. Moreira S.P. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4681-4688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In these studies, the finding that partial phosphorylation did not cause “partial” desensitization is consistent with the notion that the non-visual arrestins have strict requirements for binding to GRK-phosphorylated substrates leading to decreases in coupling to Gi. This notion supports the findings of the current work, where we observed phosphorylation of α2A(3LC), but a failure of this receptor to display agonist-promoted desensitization. Presumably, the third loop conformation attained is adequate for GRK phosphorylation but not subsequent arrestin binding.Using the current approach, it might be expected that substitution of the α2A third loop into the α2C receptor would confer phosphorylation, based on the assumption that the primary structure of this loop imparts the relevant features for the process. Similarly, substitution of the α2C third intracellular loop into the α2A would be expected to result in a receptor that failed to undergo agonist-promoted phosphorylation. Instead, we found that the presence or absence of phosphorylation was dependent on the subtype backbone rather than the third intracellular loop. The fact that agonists with different structures promoted markedly divergent degrees of phosphorylation of α2AAR (which was unrelated to intrinsic activity) supports the notion that the conformation stabilized by agonist is highly variable and has an important impact on third loop phosphorylation. Interestingly, although we observed these unexpected gain and loss phenotypes, and the differential phosphorylation of α2AAR by various agonists, we failed to observe phosphorylation of α2CAR due to exposure to any agonist tested (data not shown). Thus, although the ligand binding pocket of the α2AAR appears to be amenable to modification based on agonist structure, a similar scenario may not exist for α2CAR. However, since the highly phosphorylatable α2AAR third intracellular loop fails to undergo phosphorylation in the context of the α2CAR, the importance of residues outside of the loop is nonetheless clear.These results support the concept that agonists can stabilize receptor conformation in highly specific ways. This is illustrated in Fig.5. Here, agonist 1 is shown stabilizing a receptor in a specific R*1 conformation. Such a conformation may allow for effective coupling to G protein, but not for phosphorylation, or some other process. These processes might include other events that are agonist-promoted, such as coupling to a second G protein, internalization, or down-regulation. In this model, other conformations, such as R*2–R*4, might have such properties, and depending on the agonist, specific conformations and thus pathways or properties can be realized. Indeed, we have previously shown that α2AR coupling to Gs (a somewhat inefficient process) is highly dependent on agonist structure (23Eason M.G. Jacinto M.T. Liggett S.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 696-702PubMed Google Scholar). For drug development, this is particularly important in that it appears to be possible to design agonists with sufficient intrinsic activities that fail to undergo desensitization. Our findings also suggest that it is overly simplistic to consider agonist-based function to be strictly based on a “universal” active conformation.Figure 5General model of agonist interaction with α2AAR. In this depiction, receptor (R) is stabilized by two different agonists (A1, A2). The agonist-stabilized conformations (R*1--R*6) can be different for each agonist, such that differential G protein coupling, phosphorylation or other events are realized. In this example, agonist 2 does not evoke phosphorylation or coupling to G protein B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In summary, using chimeric-mutagenesis, we have shown that the third intracellular loops of both the α2AAR and α2CAR have residues that can be phosphorylated during short term agonist exposure. However, such phosphorylation is present only in the context of the α2AAR, and is indeed absent when these loops are in the context of the α2CAR backbone. These results indicate that the subtype ligand binding pockets, which direct third loop conformational changes, have a major influence on subtype-specific phosphorylation of the α2AR. Desensitization, defined as a waning of a signal despite the presence of stimulus, is a common biological phenomenon. Many receptors that signal through guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) display desensitization in the presence of continuous agonist exposure (1Liggett S.B. Lefkowitz R.J. Sibley D. Houslay M. Regulation of Cellular Signal Transduction Pathways by Desensitization and Amplification. John Wiley & Sons, London1993: 71-97Google Scholar). Such regulation of receptor function is key to the cell being able to integrate the myriad of received signals in order to maintain homeostasis under a variety of physiologic and pathologic conditions. Receptor desensitization can be adaptive or maladaptive within the context of disease (2Bristow M.R. Lancet. 1998; 352: SI8-SI14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, the process can lead to clinical tachyphylaxis, which limits the therapeutic effectiveness of administered agonists (1Liggett S.B. Lefkowitz R.J. Sibley D. Houslay M.

The most rapid form of desensitization of G protein-coupled receptors is due to phosphorylation, leading to a decrease in coupling of the receptor to its cognate G protein. A family of serine/threonine protein kinases, termed G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs),1 serves to phosphorylate the agonist-occupied forms of these receptors, and are the kinases responsible for agonist-promoted (homologous) desensitization (3Pitcher J.A.

We have titrated out AmiC repression activity in vivo by increased AmiR production in trans and shown AmiC regulation of the antitermination activity of AmiR by a steric hindrance mechanism. In the presence of the co-repressor butyramide we have isolated a stable AmiC·AmiR complex. Addition of the inducing ligand acetamide to the complex trips the molecular switch, causing complex dissociation and release of AmiR. The AmiC·AmiR butyramide complex exhibits acetamide-dependent, sequence-specific RNA binding activity and a Kd of 1.0 nm has been calculated for the AmiR·RNA interaction. The results show that amidase operon expression is controlled by a novel type of signal transduction system in which activity of a site-specific RNA binding activator is regulated via a sequestration mechanism.

Amidase activity is inducible by acetamide, propionamide, and lactamide, although only acetamide and propionamide are substrates for the enzyme. Butyramide is hydrolyzed very poorly by the enzyme and acts as a co-repressor of amidase expression (6Brammar W.J. Clarke P.H. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1964; 37: 307-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Amidase operon expression is regulated by a signal transduction system involving AmiC and AmiR (see Fig. 1, A and B). AmiC negatively regulates operon expression, and disruption of the amiC open reading frame leads to constitutive amidase synthesis (4Wilson S.A. Drew R.E. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4914-4921Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). AmiC functions as the ligand sensor conferring inducibility and amide sensitivity on the system and binds both inducing and non-inducing amides (4Wilson S.A. Drew R.E. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4914-4921Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Cousens D.J. Clarke P.H. Drew R.E. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1987; 133: 2041-2052PubMed Google Scholar, 8Wilson S.A. Wachira S.J. Drew R.E. Jones D. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3637-3642Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). AmiR, the response regulator, positively controls amidase expression, and disruption of the amiR gene leads to an amidase-negative phenotype. The protein functions as a transcription antitermination factor that mediates the extension of a short, constitutively synthesized, leader transcript through a rho-independent transcription terminator and into the operon (see Fig. 1, A and B) (9Drew R.E. Lowe N. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1989; 135: 817-823PubMed Google Scholar, 10Wilson S.A. Drew R.E. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3052-3057Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of amiC in the wild type strain PAC1 leads to a non-inducible phenotype, and overexpression of amiR leads to a semiconstitutive phenotype (4Wilson S.A. Drew R.E. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4914-4921Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Cousens D.J. Clarke P.H. Drew R.E. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1987; 133: 2041-2052PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggested that the mechanism of AmiC inhibition of amidase expression involved a direct protein-protein interaction with AmiR (4Wilson S.A. Drew R.E. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4914-4921Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Wilson S.A. Wachira S.J. Drew R.E. Jones D. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3637-3642Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Thus AmiC and AmiR form a signal transduction autogenous control circuit, regulating their own and amidase expression in response to inducing amides (10Wilson S.A. Drew R.E. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3052-3057Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The amidase operon is expressed from a strong constitutive Escherichia coli-like ς70 promoter sequence, followed by a short leader open reading frame of no apparent function, within which lies a rho-independent transcription termination sequence (T1). Downstream lies the amidase S-D1 sequence and amiE gene (Fig.1 C). The antitermination regulatory system was defined by the analysis of a 10-bp T1 terminator deletion, which led to amide-independent, AmiR-independent, constitutive amidase expression (9Drew R.E. Lowe N. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1989; 135: 817-823PubMed Google Scholar) and by transcript analysis, which showed constitutive production of the leader mRNA (10Wilson S.A. Drew R.E. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3052-3057Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Direct AmiR/leader mRNA interaction has been demonstrated in vivo by AmiR titration with excess leader transcript and the analysis of constructed leader region mutants. This study defined two short regions of RNA of different sequence within the leader transcript independently needed for full antitermination activity in vivo (11Wilson S.A. Wachira S.J. Norman R.A. Pearl L.H. Drew R.E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5907-5916Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), indicating that the interactions between AmiR and the leader transcript probably involve the correct three-dimensional presentation of these two protein recognition sequences. The structure of AmiC-acetamide has been determined and consists of a single polypeptide chain folded into two domains (12Pearl L.H. O'Hara B.P. Drew R.E. Wilson S.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5810-5817Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Each domain consists of a β-α-β topology linked by a hinge region and closed down with a trapped acetamide molecule within the ligand binding cleft, which lies at the interface of the two domains. The overall fold is very similar to that of members of the small molecule binding protein family, particularly to LivJ, the periplasmically located leucine/isoleucine/valine binding protein from E. coli. Attempts to overproduce and isolate AmiR have been unsuccessful, because the protein forms insoluble aggregates. The structure of the AmiC·AmiR-butyramide complex described in this paper has recently been determined by x-ray crystallography and comprises an intimate AmiR dimer bound to two AmiC monomers (13O'Hara B.P. Norman R.A. Wan P.T.C. Roe S.M. Barrett T.E. Drew R.E. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5175-5186Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Each AmiC monomer interacts simultaneously with both molecules in the dimer and makes identical contacts to the top surface formed by the two AmiR N-terminal domains. Comparison of AmiR with known structures revealed a significant similarity between the AmiR N-terminal domain and the response regulator receiver domain family of bacterial two-component signal transduction systems (13O'Hara B.P. Norman R.A. Wan P.T.C. Roe S.M. Barrett T.E. Drew R.E. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5175-5186Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, despite the structural homology of AmiR with this large group of regulators, there is no conservation of the key residues, suggesting that AmiR is the first member of the family not regulated by phosphorylation. The AmiR C-terminal domain consists of a long α-helix terminating in a three-helix bundle. Analysis of AmiR mutants deleted for C-terminal regions strongly implicated this domain in RNA binding, because the mutants are non-functional with respect to antitermination in vivo(13O'Hara B.P. Norman R.A. Wan P.T.C. Roe S.M. Barrett T.E. Drew R.E. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5175-5186Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In this paper we report the results of in vivo and in vitro studies to investigate the mechanism of AmiC regulation of AmiR antitermination activity, the isolation of an AmiC·AmiR-butyramide complex, and its use in showing acetamide-dependent, sequence-specific RNA binding. PAC1 is the wild type amidase-inducible strain (1Kelly M. Clarke P.H. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1962; 27: 305-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and PAC452 has a chromosomal deletion of the amidase operon (4Wilson S.A. Drew R.E. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4914-4921Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids pSW40 (pMMB66HE derivative, ApR, regulated amiR expression from the vector tac promoter), pMW42 (pGEM4Z derivative, ApR,ami operon leader region), and pRAN1 (pMMB66HE derivative, ApR, polymerase chain reaction-cloned amiC,amiR genes expressed from the vector tacpromoter) have been described previously (4Wilson S.A. Drew R.E. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4914-4921Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Wilson S.A. Wachira S.J. Norman R.A. Pearl L.H. Drew R.E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5907-5916Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Amidase activity in intact cells was measured as described previously (8Wilson S.A. Wachira S.J. Drew R.E. Jones D. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3637-3642Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). One unit represents 1 μmol of acetohydroxamate formed per minute. Specific activities presented are units per milligram of bacterial cells (14Drew R.E. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1984; 130: 3101-3111PubMed Google Scholar). Total equalized and washed cell pellets were dissolved in loading buffer, and the proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE (15Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose. AmiR quantitation used a polyclonal rabbit anti-maltose binding protein-AmiR serum (11Wilson S.A. Wachira S.J. Norman R.A. Pearl L.H. Drew R.E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5907-5916Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and horseradish peroxidase-linked goat anti-rabbit IgG for ECL Western blotting detection (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Fluorescence was detected by x-ray film, captured with a UVItech photodocumentation system and analyzed with UVIDoc and UVIBand software (UVI Cambridge, United Kingdom). The complex was isolated from PAC452, pRAN1 cells grown, harvested, and broken as described previously using buffers containing butyramide (11Wilson S.A. Wachira S.J. Norman R.A. Pearl L.H. Drew R.E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5907-5916Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The cleared lysate was ammonium sulfate-fractionated, and the 40–50% portion cut was resuspended in Buffer A (20 mmTris, pH 9.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 23 mm butyramide). 2 ml of extract (90 mg/ml) was subjected to preparative gel filtration (Superdex 200, HiLoad 16/60) and eluted with Buffer A + 150 mm NaCl. 1-ml fractions were collected, and those shown to contain most of the AmiC·AmiR complex by SDS-PAGE were pooled for anion-exchange chromatography. Pooled samples were fractionated using a HiLoad Q-Sepharose FF 26/10 column pre-equilibrated with Buffer A, and protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 0.15–0.8 m NaCl. 5.0-ml fractions were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Fractions containing most of the AmiC·AmiR complex were pooled and made up to 1.2 mammonium sulfate for hydrophobic interaction chromatography using a 20-ml phenyl-Sepharose HP column. The column was pre-equilibrated with Buffer A containing 1.0 m ammonium sulfate, and protein was eluted with Buffer A containing decreasing ammonium sulfate concentrations. 5.0-ml fractions were collected, and those containing most of the AmiC·AmiR complex were pooled. The protein was concentrated to 5 mg/ml (PM30 Diaflo Ultrafilter, Amicon) and subject to analytical gel filtration using a Superose 12 HR 10/30 column. Fractions identified as containing the AmiC·AmiR complex were pooled and concentrated to 16 mg/ml. For gel filtration studies, pooled and concentrated AmiC·AmiR-butyramide complex samples were analyzed using a Superose 12 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Samples were initially in Buffer A (containing 23 mm butyramide and 0.6 m NaCl). Acetamide was added, where necessary, and samples were incubated at 25 °C for 30 min. Fractions (0.2 ml) were collected after elution with Buffer A + 0.6 m NaCl containing either 23 mm butyramide or appropriate amounts of acetamide and trichloroacetic acid-precipitated. The precipitate was dissolved, and proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and quantitated using the UVItech photodocumentation system and analysis with UVIDoc and UVIBand software (UVI Cambridge). The Superose 12 column was calibrated using gel filtration standards (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Continuously labeled run-off RNA transcripts were produced from BstEII-linearized pMW42 using the T7 RiboMax system (Promega) and [α-32P]CTP. Full-length transcripts were isolated in 0.5 m ammonium acetate, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 0.1% SDS buffer after preparative PAGE, subsequently isopropanol-precipitated, dissolved in diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water, and quantitated spectrophotometrically. The labeled RNA and AmiC·AmiR-butyramide complex were mixed in 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and acetamide (136 mm) if necessary. Reactants were incubated at 4 °C for 20 min and then diluted into 20 mm Tris (pH 8.2), 80 mm NaCl, 50 mm KCl, 0.25 mm MgCl2, and acetamide (34 mm), if needed, and then incubated at 4 °C for a further 20 min. After addition of 50% glycerol, 1% bromphenol blue, samples were run on a 5% non-denaturing PAGE. The dried-down gels were exposed, and reaction products were quantitated using a FujiFilm phosphorimager. Previous studies using cloned amiC and amiR genes in both E. coli and P. aeruginosa showed that overexpression of amiR led to a semiconstitutive phenotype and overexpression of amiC to a non-inducible phenotype (4Wilson S.A. Drew R.E. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4914-4921Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Cousens D.J. Clarke P.H. Drew R.E. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1987; 133: 2041-2052PubMed Google Scholar). However, a normal amide-inducible phenotype was found with a regulated expression vector (pMW21) in which the two regulatory genes were present together in their normal orientation (8Wilson S.A. Wachira S.J. Drew R.E. Jones D. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3637-3642Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). It thus appeared that AmiC:AmiR stoichiometry was important for the maintenance of the inducible phenotype. This has been investigated by measurement of the amounts of AmiC and AmiR in total extracts of PAC452, PAC452,pMMB66EH, and PAC452,pRAN1. The host strain carries a chromosomal deletion of the amidase operon, and pRAN1 carries the polymerase chain reaction-cloned wild type genes, including S-D sequences, downstream from the pMMB66EH-regulated tac promoter. Plasmid pRAN1 shows IPTG-dependent lactamide-inducible, butyramide-repressible amidase expression in strain PAC327, an amiC,amiRdouble mutant host clearly showing the production of a normal AmiC:AmiR ratio from pRAN1 (not presented). After growth in medium containing IPTG, total cell pellets were solubilized, and the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2). The induced whole cell extract of PAC452,pRAN1 (lane 6) showed the presence of a major new band corresponding to AmiC and a fainter AmiR band neither of which are present in any other lane. Amounts of AmiC and AmiR were quantitated by scanning densitometry. The values obtained were standardized to molarities by application of a correction factor of 0.892 to the AmiR value obtained. This was obtained by scanning densitometry of a Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE gel containing a washed and solubilized AmiC·AmiR-butyramide crystal containing 2xAmiC/2xAmiR (13O'Hara B.P. Norman R.A. Wan P.T.C. Roe S.M. Barrett T.E. Drew R.E. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5175-5186Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In stained SDS-PAGE AmiR, overstains with respect to its Mr and AmiC and AmiR molarities are obtained by multiplication of AmiR values by 0.892. In Fig. 2 (lane 6) AmiC and AmiR together represent 9% of the total stained material in a molar ratio of 3.3:1. There is thus an excess of the AmiC-negative regulator within the cells. To investigate the effect of AmiR overproduction, amidase activity was measured and AmiR quantitated in non-induced and induced PAC1, PAC452, and in PAC1,pSW40 (TableI). PAC1 the wild type strain showed a non-induced background level of amidase activity (specific activity = 0.16) and a 40-fold S-lactamide-induced level of activity (7.07). Plasmid pSW40 is an IPTG-inducible amiR expression vector, and LacI regulation of the vector tac promoter is apparently leaky, because in the absence of IPTG with PAC1, pSW40 sufficient AmiR is produced to titrate out the excess AmiC and generate 12.9% (specific activity = 1.31) of the fully induced level of amidase expression. Addition of IPTG up to 0.1 mm showed a complete titration of AmiC repression activity and full operon expression (specific activity = 10.16) in the absence of inducing ligand (Table I). Experiments with added IPTG up to 0.150 mm showed no further increase in amidase specific activity (data not presented). Overproduction of AmiR in trans will lead to both increased amidase synthesis and additionally increased AmiC and AmiR production in the 3.3:1 ratio measured above. At any level of ligand-free amidase operon expression, sufficient additional AmiR must be produced from pSW40 to titrate out the molar excess of AmiC. Total AmiR was quantitated by ECL Western blotting in one experiment, and the values of the amidase specific activity and total AmiR from Run 8 are shown in Table I. The plot of total AmiR against amidase specific activity (Fig.3) showed a direct linear relationship between the two values consistent with a steric hindrance mechanism for the regulation of the antitermination activity of AmiR by AmiC.Table IAmidase activity and AmiR quantitation in P. aeruginosaS-Lactamide (0.2%)IPTGAverage amidaseRun 8AmidaseTotal AmiRmmspecific activityPAC10.160.162,861PAC1+7.074.9678,117PAC4520.330.23PAC1,pSW400.01.310.8223,630PAC1,pSW400.01252.972.5062,316PAC1,pSW400.02505.495.84102,065PAC1,pSW400.05008.368.60130,831PAC1,pSW400.075010.059.25139,929PAC1,pSW400.100010.8610.16127,567Amidase activity was measured in intact cells as μm of acetohydroxamate produced per minute per milligram of cells. Lactamide was added as a non-substrate inducer, and amiR expression from pSW40 was regulated by addition of IPTG. AmiR was quantitated in solubilized whole cells after SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Open table in a new tab Amidase activity was measured in intact cells as μm of acetohydroxamate produced per minute per milligram of cells. Lactamide was added as a non-substrate inducer, and amiR expression from pSW40 was regulated by addition of IPTG. AmiR was quantitated in solubilized whole cells after SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. A corollary of the steric hindrance mechanism is that, for cells growing under amide non-inducing or -repressing growth conditions, an AmiC·AmiR complex should exist in which the antitermination activity of AmiR is occluded by AmiC. Previous investigations using PAC1 showed that, during amidase induction studies in which activity was required for cell growth, as the cells entered stationary phase a second phase of enzyme induction occurred despite the absence of inducing amides in the growth medium at this time (6Brammar W.J. Clarke P.H. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1964; 37: 307-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). To overcome this potential problem strain PAC452,pRAN1 was grown in the presence of IPTG and butyramide for the isolation of an AmiC·AmiR complex. The major purification problem was the contamination of extracts by excess AmiC, which was removed during the gel filtration stages. The final product ran as a single peak in gel filtration chromatography (Fig.4 A) with a calculated Mr of 130,000 and an organization of 2xAmiC/2xAmiR from SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2, lane 8). The complex in the presence of butyramide was stable between pH 5.5 and 9.0 and was equally stable in the presence of up to 1 m NaCl as determined by gel filtration chromatography (not presented). The Kd of acetamide for AmiC was determined previously at 3.7 μm and that for butyramide at 0.31 mm(8Wilson S.A. Wachira S.J. Drew R.E. Jones D. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3637-3642Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Thus addition of equimolar acetamide to the AmiC·AmiR-butyramide complex would be expected to displace the butyramide from the AmiC ligand-binding site. It had been shown previously using a semipurified AmiC·AmiR-butyramide extract that addition of acetamide caused partial complex dissociation (11Wilson S.A. Wachira S.J. Norman R.A. Pearl L.H. Drew R.E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5907-5916Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To quantitate this effect AmiC·AmiR-butyramide samples were incubated with increasing amounts of acetamide (0.34 μm, 3.4 μm, 34 μm, 0.34 mm, and 34 mm). Changes were monitored by high resolution gel filtration chromatography (Fig.4), and the fractions collected were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot (not presented). The initial complex sample ran as a single discrete peak containing AmiC and AmiR, which represented 0% dissociation (Fig. 4 A). As the acetamide concentration was increased the main peak decreased and was replaced by a high Mr AmiR shoulder and a lower Mr AmiC peak. Fractions from the 34 mm acetamide run (Fig. 4 F) were analyzed by Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE, and the amounts and relative proportions of AmiC and AmiR present in each of the fractions and across the fractions was determined by scanning densitometry. The results showed that the presence of both AmiC and AmiR in the central peak seen in the column profile of this run corresponds to overlapping AmiR and AmiC peaks and not to the presence of any remaining complex. Thus, the central peaks seen in some of the runs represent a mixture of both undissociated complex and overlapping single species peaks, dependent on the added acetamide concentration. The area under the peaks was measured for all runs, and the proportion corresponding to the intact complex was calculated. A plot of the percentage complex against acetamide concentration shows that at 2.5 μmacetamide the complex is 50% dissociated (Fig.5). This value is close to the Kd of acetamide for AmiC (3.7 μm). Thus at an acetamide concentration at which 50% of the AmiC ligand binding sites are occupied, the complex is 50% dissociated into AmiC-acetamide and free AmiR. The AmiC and AmiR interactions involved in complex dissociation probably do not represent a true equilibrium situation, and thus it is not possible to calculate a Kd for the interaction. However, it is apparent that acetamide addition to the AmiC·AmiR-butyramide complex causes dissociation and the release of AmiR. The released AmiR appears to form a series of high molecular weight soluble aggregates shown as a broad shoulder on the elution profile. The monomer Mrof AmiR is 21,775 (3Lowe N. Rice P.M. Drew R.E. FEBS Lett. 1989; 246: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), and the position of the AmiR shoulder seen on the gel filtration profile shows the protein present as aggregates of Mr 130,000 and greater. Thus, AmiR must be present as at least a hexamer and other higher oligomeric forms. It is difficult at this stage to establish whether these forms are inactive aggregates due to the inherent properties of the protein or whether they represent a biologically relevant organization. The partially overlapping AmiC-acetamide peak seen under 100% dissociation conditions (Fig. 4 F) appears to comprise a mixture of AmiC-acetamide dimers (Mr 85,600) and trimers (Mr 128,600). The isolation of an AmiC·AmiR-butyramide complex represents the repressed configuration of the switch regulating amidase operon expression. In vivothe normal states of the switch are predicted to be that present under non-inducing growth conditions, i.e. small amounts of ligand-free AmiC·AmiR complex, and under inducing growth conditions,i.e. large amounts of AmiC-acetamide plus AmiR bound to the RNA leader sequence. The AmiC·AmiR-butyramide complex was subject to extensive equilibrium dialysis against amide-free buffer to reduce the butyramide to <40 pm and analyzed by high resolution gel filtration chromatography. The results (not presented) show the ligand-free AmiC·AmiR as a stable soluble trapped complex migrating as a single species of Mr 130,000 identical to the AmiC·AmiR-butyramide complex (Fig. 4 A). The role of AmiR as an antitermination factor was established by showing in vivo titration of the protein by competing leader transcripts produced in trans, and the analysis of leader transcript mutants in vivo in which the antitermination reaction failed to work (11Wilson S.A. Wachira S.J. Norman R.A. Pearl L.H. Drew R.E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5907-5916Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The proposed mechanism for the reaction is that of free AmiR interacting with the leader transcript, initially with the RNA sequences identified by the mutagenesis to generate an RNA/protein configuration in which the formation of the leader terminator stem/loop structure is precluded, allowing RNA polymerase to continue transcription into the operon. Only with the isolation of the AmiC·AmiR-butyramide complex have we obtained AmiR in a soluble form. Thus, to investigate the AmiR·RNA interaction in vitro we have used the AmiC·AmiR-butyramide complex and labeled leader RNA transcripts with analysis of the reaction products by non-denaturing PAGE. Initial studies used a fixed amount of continuously labeled gel-purified run-off transcript and increasing complex concentrations, which showed acetamide-dependent gel retardation (not presented). To investigate the interaction, fixed concentrations of complex were used with increasing amounts of transcript and the values of bound and unbound RNA were quantitated (Fig.6). The autoradiograph shows the transcript (16 nm) (lane 1), transcript plus protein complex (2.7 μm AmiR dimers) plus acetamide (lane 2), and reactions containing increasing labeled transcript (lanes 3–10). The transcript migrates as a major single band with a minor slower migrating uncharacterized form (lane 1). The transcript plus complex shows the migration of the RNA is retarded (lane 2). Lanes 6–10 show the presence of the unbound RNA. The levels of bound and unbound labeled transcript were quantitated (not shown). The curve of labeled transcript added versus labeled transcript bound displayed negative deviation from ideal behavior. Values obtained were used to generate a Scatchard plot, which shows non-linear characteristics (Fig.6 B). The calculated Kd for the binding of leader transcript to AmiR was 1.0 nm, and the value of κ indicates a stoichiometry between AmiR dimers and RNA of 152:1. A second attempt to determine the Kd of the AmiR·RNA interaction used fixed amounts of labeled transcript (13 nm) incubated with increasing concentrations of the AmiC·AmiR-butyramide complex (0.19–2.7 μm AmiR dimers) plus acetamide (not presented). The proportions of bound and unbound transcript were again quantitated and are shown in Fig.7. The AmiR concentration at which 50% of the transcript is bound was 172 nm, which would correspond to the Kd if the AmiR dimer/RNA stoichiometry was 1:1. Taking into account the calculated stoichiometry of 152:1, the Kd value here for the AmiR dimer/RNA interaction is 1.1 nm and close to the value obtained previously.Figure 7Effect of increasing AmiC·AmiR complex on labeled RNA transcript gel retardation.

The most probable explanation for these results is that, once the reaction is set up, the AmiC·AmiR complex completely dissociates and much of the AmiR released aggregates into a form that is unable to interact normally with the transcript. Reaction conditions used for these studies are the same as those used for the analysis of the AmiC·AmiR complex in which the complex was completely dissociated. To show the"

Virtually all individuals with SLE have joint and/or skin involvement, and between 30 and 70% of the patients have kidney, heart, lung, and central nervous system involvement (1Isenberg D.A. Horsfall A. Maddison P.J. Isenberg S.A. Woo P. Glass D. Oxford Textbook of Rheumatology. Oxford University Press, Oxford1998: 1145-1180Google Scholar). Anti-dsDNA antibodies are serological markers of SLE often reflecting disease activity (2Swaak A.J.G. Aarden L.A. Statius van Eps L.W. Feltkamp T.E.

Dis. 1993; 52: 14-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). These antibodies have been eluted from kidneys of both patients with SLE and various mouse models. Anti-phospholipid antibodies, especially anti-cardiolipin, are associated with recurrent thrombosis, miscarriages, and thrombocytopenia as part of the primary anti-phospholipid antibody syndrome (5Morrow J. Nelson J.L. Watts R. Isenberg D.A. Autoimmune Rheumatic Disease. Oxford University Press, Oxford1999: 216-232Google Scholar). Despite considerable improvement in the overall outcome, lupus continues to cause considerable morbidity and mortality.By using hybridoma technology we and others (6Winkler T.H. Jahn S. Kalden J.R.

Interestingly, although the anti-DNA antibodies studied appeared to be similar in that most bound dsDNA in ELISA and in Crithidia assays, they exhibited distinctive patterns of tissue binding and differing abilities to cause proteinuria (9Ehrenstein M.R.

Immunol. 1998; 28: 339-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar).The structural basis for antigen specificity and pathogenicity of these antibodies is poorly understood (11Kalsi J.K. Sutton B. Lupus. 1997; 6: 317-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Such an understanding, however, would be of considerable value in the development of therapies that can inhibit or disrupt protein-nucleic acid interactions (12Ben-Chetrit E. Eilat D. Ben-Sasson S.A. Immunology. 1988; 65: 479-485PubMed Google Scholar). Computer modeling of some of these antibodies has highlighted possible modes of interaction with DNA (13Kalsi J.K. Martin A.C.R. Hirabayashi Y. Ehrenstein M. Longhurst C.M. Ravirajan C. Zvelebil M. Stollar D.B. Thornton J.M. Isenberg D. Mol. Immunol. 1996; 33: 471-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, these models are of limited accuracy. A full understanding of the binding specificities can only be achieved by experimental determination of detailed three-dimensional structure of these antibodies alone and of their complexes with specific DNA antigens. However, a prerequisite of such a study is the ability to produce reasonable amounts (in excess of 5–10 mg) of the antibody protein.Our initial studies have therefore been focused on the cloning and overexpression of the Fab of a well characterized human anti-DNA antibody B3 (14Ehrenstein M.R. Longhurst C.M. Latchman D.S. Isenberg D.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1787-1797Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) in a heterologous cell expression system. We now describe construction of novel vectors pAGP2 (λ) and Bluntzeo that allow cloning of virtually any human lambda antibody. We also describe a novel cloning scheme that could be used for the cloning of many lambda antibodies belonging to Vλ1 and Vλ2 gene families known to represent a number of pathogenic autoantibodies in a PCR and/or non-PCR manner. The cloning scheme allowed us to clone rapidly two other well characterized antibodies 33H11 (anti-DNA, see Ref. 6Winkler T.H. Jahn S. Kalden J.R. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1991; 85: 379-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and UK4 (anti-cardiolipin, see Ref. 8Menon S. Rahman M.A. Ravirajan C.T. Kandiah D. Longhurst C.M. McNally T. Williams W.M. Latchman D.S. Isenberg D.A. J. Autoimmun. 1997; 10: 43-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) in a non-PCR manner.The technology further allowed us to construct hybrid Fabs by swapping of the heavy (H) and light (L) chains of the three antibodies with which to investigate the role of the two chains in dictating the autoantigen specificity. The contribution of H and/or L chain to the DNA/cardiolipin binding of an autoantibody has been the subject of considerable debate. Although a number of studies of murine anti-DNA antibodies have been reported (15Lacour M. Izui S. Eur. J. Immunol. 1991; 21: 839-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 16Radic M.Z.

Immunology. 1997; 159: 6083-6090Google Scholar), similar studies on human IgG anti-DNA antibodies are scarce (18Roben P. Barbas S.M. Sandoval L. Lecerf J.M. Stollar B.D. Solomon A. Silverman G.J. J.

Immunol. 1996; 157: 2449-2454PubMed Google Scholar) and provide only limited information. Given that over 90% of murine serum L chains are kappa (20Nissonoff A. Hopper J.E. Spring S.B. The Antibody Molecule. Academic Press, New York1975: 299-301Google Scholar), whereas approximately 40% of human serum L chains are lambda in addition to the human lambda locus being more extensive than that of the mouse (21Hieter P.A. Hollis G.F. Korsmeyer S.J. Waldmann T.A. Leder P. Nature. 1981; 294: 536-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), the information currently available on the L chain contribution in an autoantigen reactivity of an autoantibody from the mouse may not reliably represent similar L chain contribution in a human autoantibody. The autoantibodies studied presently possess lambda light chains encoded by 2A2 gene segment known to be most commonly used among humans (22Ignatovich O. Tomlinson I.M. Jones P.T. Winter G. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and also to exhibit pairing with different heavy chains (23de Wildt R.M. Hoet R.M.A. van Venrooij W.J. Tomlinson I.M. Winter G. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 895-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the 2A2 gene segment has no known mouse homologue (24Williams S.C. Frippiat J.P. Tomlinson I.M. Ignatovich O. Lefranc M.P. Winter G. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 220-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The autoantibodies studied presently thus present a relevant set of antibodies to investigate. Such an analysis of lupus autoantibodies might provide clues to the molecular basis for antigenic specificity that might in turn dictate pathogenicity. We report a quantitative assessment of the influence on anti-DNA/cardiolipin binding behavior, conferred to a human IgG antibody by its constituent H/L chain. This is an important step forward toward understanding and in vitro analysis of what could be an in vivo event.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCloning of B3 FabThree plasmid vectors (pAGP1, pAGP2, and pAWtac) and twoEscherichia coli strains (LM1035 and W3110) were obtained from CellTech (Slough, UK) for E. coli cloning and expression of the Fabs of kappa antibodies. The final expression vector pAWtac is based on pCTR008 (25Yarranton G.T. Mountain A. Rees A.R. Sternberg M.J.E. Wetzel R. Protein Engineering: A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1992: 302-325Google Scholar) involving the secretion of L and H chains under the direction of OmpA signal sequence and involves co-translational coupling between the cistrons (26Schoner B.E.

The cDNA encoding the variable (Vλ/VH) domains of L and H chains of the B3 antibody (14Ehrenstein M.R. Longhurst C.M. Latchman D.S. Isenberg D.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1787-1797Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) were amplified by PCR (95 °C, 2 min; 62 °C, 2 min; 72 °C, 30 s; 30 cycles) using Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, Hitchin, UK) for cloning into the above described vectors. However, the original CellTech vector pAGP2 contains L chain with kappa constant region. Since B3 is a lambda antibody, the prerequisite for its cloning was to replace the kappa constant with lambda constant region in pAGP2.For the construction of pAGP2 vector with lambda constant (Cλ) region, Cλ region on plasmid pLN10 was a kind gift from Dr. Ray Field of Cambridge Antibody Technology, Cambridge, UK. Construction of the vector pAGP2 (λ) has been summarized in Fig.1 a.The cloning scheme of the L (Vλ-Cλ) and H (VH-CH1) chain variable and constant domains into the final expression vector pAWtac via our new vector pAGP2 (λ) and CellTech vector pAGP1 has been summarized in Fig. 1 b. This scheme allows cloning of any lambda antibody Fab fragment and its overexpression in E. coli.Protein Expression, Detection, Purification, and QuantitationThe final expression vector pAWtac containing Vλ-Cλ and VH-CH1 was transferred to the expression strain W3110. Single colonies were picked from the transformants, and 50-ml cultures prepared in 250-ml shake flasks (overnight, 30 or 25 °C). Fresh 1.5-liter cultures in 5-liter flasks were then set up using the overnight culture to inoculate the medium to an A 600 of 0.08. Cultures were induced with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside (IPTG) at anA 600 of 0.5 and allowed to grow for a further 4–16 h. High Biomass Medium (13Kalsi J.K. Martin A.C.R. Hirabayashi Y.

Muslin cloth was used on the flasks to allow better aeration. A 600 was recorded at periodic intervals before and after induction and of the uninduced control cultures.Cultures were spun (9,000 rpm; 30 min; 4 °C; Sorvall, DuPont) following induction. Supernatant was saved for the detection of any leaked Fab protein from the cells. The cell pellet was suspended in ice-cold water (30 ml of distilled H2O per 1 liter of culture), stirred for 30 min at 4 °C, and spun as described above. The supernatant was filtered (0.22-μm filters; Millipore, Bedford, MA) and stored as a periplasmic fraction at 4 °C. The pellet was suspended in TE buffer (100 mm Tris·Cl, 10 mmEDTA; 1 ml of buffer per 25 ml of culture), sonicated, and spun (15,000 rpm; 1 h; 4 °C; Sorvall, DuPont). The supernatant was filtered (0.22-μm filters, Millipore, Bedford, MA) and stored at 4 °C as cell extract.Dot Blot, SDS-PAGE, and Western Blot Analyses of the Recombinant FabSamples of supernatant, periplasm, and cell extract were applied on the nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore; Bedford, MA). The membrane was then blocked (skimmed milk, 20 min), probed with goat anti-human lambda antibody (α-Hλ) conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (1 h), and developed using 5-bromo-4-chloro-4-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium substrate. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (27Bollag, D. M., and Edelstein, S. J. (1991) Protein Methods, pp. 46, 181–204, Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York.Google Scholar) following SDS-PAGE (28Kumar S. Pritchard D.I. Int. J.

Protein G-purified Fab protein was dialyzed against 10 mmsodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.3, and loaded on a heparin (heparin-Sepharose CL-6B; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column. The bound Fab protein was eluted with a 100–800 mm NaCl salt gradient. The purity of the purified Fab protein was assessed on SDS-PAGE gels under reducing and non-reducing conditions.Quantitative Assessment of the Expression of the Recombinant FabProtein concentration of the purified Fab was determined by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm (27Bollag, D. M., and Edelstein, S. J. (1991) Protein Methods, pp. 46, 181–204, Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York.Google Scholar) using UV-2401 PC (UV-visible recording spectrophotometer, Shimadzu Corp., Japan). The level of expression in individual periplasmic batches was assessed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Briefly, the polystyrene plate was coated with a monoclonal antibody to human lambda chain (Moα-Hλ, 1:1000; 4 °C, overnight) and blocked (PBS plus 10% Marvel skimmed milk, 1 h, 37 °C). A range of concentrations of the purified Fab (from 2,500 ng/ml, standard) and the periplasmic samples was applied (1 h, 37 °C) in doubling dilutions. Binding of the recombinant Fab was detected using goat α-Hλ conjugated to alkaline phosphatase and p-nitrophenyl phosphate as substrate. The quantity of the Fab present in the periplasmic samples was determined from the standard curve constructed using the OD values obtained for the standard Fab protein samples.Functional Assessment of the Recombinant FabPeriplasmic extracts were tested in ELISA for calf thymus dsDNA binding activities of the recombinant Fabs as described previously (29Le Page S.H. Williams W. Parkhouse D. Cambridge G. MacKenzie L. Lydyard P.M. Isenberg D.A. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1989; 77: 314-318PubMed Google Scholar). The recombinant Fab protein was also evaluated for its binding ability to dsDNA polar body of Crithidia lucilae as described elsewhere (30Ravirajan C.T. Kalsi J. Wiloch H.W. Barakat S. Tuaillon N. Irvine W. Cockayne A. Harris A. Williams D.G. Williams W. Axford J. Muller S. Isenberg D.A. Lupus. 1992; 1: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 b).Cloning of 33H11 and UK4The cloning scheme currently used involves the use of unique restriction sites identified to be naturally present in the framework 1 (5′ end) and J (3′ end) regions of the L and H chain variable domains and has the advantage of providing a non-PCR strategy thus avoiding the inclusion of mutations and the time-consuming sequencing steps. Furthermore, the proposed scheme involves the construction of ompA leader (5′ end) and constant (3′ end) regions on the two ends of the variable domain as opposed to replacing one variable domain with the other keeping ompA leader and constant regions intact. This strategy thus eliminates the possibility of the variable domain of one antibody not being replaced by that of the other due simply to the inefficient digestion of the DNA by the restriction enzymes employed resulting either in no digestion or in the self-ligation of the singly cut DNA. Furthermore, the proposed cloning strategy involves the use of carefully selected restriction enzymes providing efficient digestion of DNA and releases DNA fragments reliably distinguishable and separable on the gel. The sequences encoding for Vλ or VH of 33H11 and UK4 antibodies have been cloned in eukaryotic expression vectors pLN10 (Vλ) and pG1D1 (VH) for their expression as IgG in our laboratory. Vλ or VH were transferred from pLN10 and pG1D1 to pAWtac using the cloning scheme described below.Cloning of the Light ChainAll the three autoantibodies B3, 33H11, and UK4 are lambda antibodies and possess similar sequences up to 72 bp at 5′ end of Vλ. This region also contains a unique restriction site BsaI at position 42. Furthermore, the Jλ region of all the three antibodies possesses a unique restriction site AvrII at position 328 at the 3′ end. Since the region between BsaI and AvrII represents all the differences exhibited by the three antibodies in their Vλ domains, it was opportune to exploit the natural presence of these restriction sites for the cloning of their L chains. Although it was achievable by simply replacing the pre-existingBsaI-AvrII fragment of B3 Vλearlier cloned in pAGP2 (λ) by that of 33H11 or UK4, most of the available cloning vectors also contained BsaI and/orAvrII site rendering them unsuitable for the proposed purposes. One of the vectors PCR-Blunt used in our laboratory does not have AvrII site, however, possesses a BsaI site in the open reading frame of the ccdB lethal gene. We therefore constructed a new vector BluntZeo by deleting theBsaI site as described below.Construction of the Vector BluntZeoThe vector was constructed by deletion of an 899-bp FspI fragment containing BsaI site, from PCR-Blunt followed by self-ligation of the vector. The FspI fragment also possessed a part of the open reading frame of the kanamycin resistance gene thus resulting into the loss of kanamycin resistance by the novel vector. However, the presence also of the zeocin resistance gene allowed selection required during cloning. The novel vector had the advantage of being small (2.6 kilobase pair) and allowing the release of reliably distinguishable and conveniently separable fragments for gel purification following the digestions by the unique restriction enzymes selected for L chain cloning. Although the Cλregion of the antibodies also possessed a BsaI site, the cloning scheme described below efficiently overcame the posed problem by virtue of the fact that the construction of Cλ at 3′ end of the Vλ did not involve the use ofBsaI.The scheme presently employed for the cloning of the L chains has been summarized in Fig. 3 a and can be efficiently used for swapping of Vλ of the antibodies encoded by the same gene segment. However, swapping of Vλencoded by different gene segments (loci) within the two lambda gene families may result in the change of 1 or 2 (Vλ2) or up to 4 (Vλ1) amino acid residues upstream of the restrictions sites BsaI/BstEII in the framework 1 region. In order to eliminate such changes if required, we recommend PCR cloning of a Vλ encoded by the allele of interest via restriction sites NruI (5′ end) and BstEII (3′ end) in our vector V2 (Fig. 3 a) using the primers described earlier for the construction of our vector pAGP2 (λ) following necessary modifications incorporating residue changes. The described scheme (Fig. 3 a) can then be followed for a quick non-PCR cloning of other L chains encoded by the same locus via their transfer to our vector Bluntzeo using appropriate restriction sites (Fig. 3 a, III).Figure 3Scheme used for the cloning of human lambda antibodies 33H11 and UK4. a, cloning of light chain. The PCR-amplified Vλ and Cλ domains of B3 L chain were transferred as an EcoRI fragment from PCR-Blunt earlier constructed containing the sequenced domains, to BluntZeo (construct V1). The ompA signal sequence was then transferred as a KpnI fragment from pAGP2 (λ) to the 5′ end of the Vλ in BluntZeo(construct V2). Simultaneously, Vλ of 33H11 or UK4 cloned in pLN10 was transferred to BluntZeo asHindIII-BamHI fragment (construct V3). The constructs V2 and V3 allowed the construction of the final and pAGP2 (λ version) equivalent (Fig. 1) construct V4 by virtue of the presence of both donor (construct V2) or recipient (construct V3) antibody fragments on the same vector (BluntZeo) as follows. ompA signal sequence (BsaI-DraI) and subsequently Cλ(AvrII-SfiI) were transferred from V2 and inserted at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively, of the 33H11 or UK4 Vλ present in V3. b, cloning of heavy chain. The variable and constant domains of B3 along with the ompA signal sequence (ompA-VH-CH1), were transferred as anEcoRI fragment from pAGP1 (Fig. 1) to BluntZeo(construct V5). Simultaneously, VH of 33H11 or UK4 cloned in pG1D1 for their expression as IgG molecule in eukaryotic expression system was transferred to BluntZeo asHindIII-BamHI fragment (construct V6). The constructs V5 and V6 allowed the construction of the final and pAGP1 equivalent (Fig. 1 b) construct V8 via V7 by virtue of the presence of both donor (construct V5) or recipient (construct V6) H chain fragments on the same vector (BluntZeo) as follows. ompA signal sequence (PpuMI-DraI) and subsequently CH1 (BstEII-SfiI) were transferred from V5 and inserted at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively, of the 33H11 or UK4 VH present in V6. However, the CH1 domain also possesses a BstEII site which resulted in the release of a 219-bp fragment following digestion with BstEII. This 219-bp fragment released previously was inserted back in the intermediate vector V7 to achieve the construction of vector V8 containing the required ompA-VH-CH1 fragment of 33H11 or UK4. Construction of the new generation of the vector V5 involving the elimination of BstEII site in the H chain constant domain is currently underway. This vector will eliminate the cloning step currently required for the construction of the vector V8 from V7.kb, kilobase pair.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Cloning of the Heavy ChainB3, 33H11, and UK4 each possesses similar sequences up to 66 bp at 5′ end of VH. This region also contains two unique restriction sites PvuII at position 10 and PpuMI at position 48. Furthermore, JH region of all the three antibodies possesses a unique restriction site BstEII at position 346 at the 3′ end. Since the region between PpuMI and BstEII represents all the differences exhibited by the three antibodies in their VH domains, it provided an opportunity of convenient cloning of the H chains in a non-PCR manner involving these naturally occurring restriction sites in the VH region. It was achievable by simply replacing the pre-existingPvuII/PpuMI-BstEII fragment of B3VH, earlier cloned in pAGP1 by that of 33H11 or UK4. Since PpuMI and BstEII both generate sticky ends, the use of PpuMI was preferred over PvuII that generates blunt ends. Furthermore, the novel vector BluntZeo was chosen for the cloning also of the H chains of 33H11 and UK4, for two reasons. First, it did not possess the restriction sites selected. Second, it allowed the release of distinguishable and conveniently separable fragments for gel purification following the digestions by the selected unique restriction enzymes.The scheme for the cloning of the H chain fragment (VH and CH1 domains) has been summarized in Fig. 3 b. Given the proximity of the restriction sites PvuII orBsgI to the 5′ end, the use of these enzymes would allow the scheme to be used efficiently for swapping of the VHencoded by the same gene segment or different gene segments within a gene family or by different gene families, using the cloning vectors described. The occasional change of a residue upstream of these restriction sites can be eliminated by PCR cloning of a VHencoded by the allele of interest via restriction sites NruI (5′ end) and ApaI (3′ end) in our vector V5 (Fig.3 b) using the primers described earlier for the cloning of VH in pAGP1 following necessary modifications incorporating residue changes. The scheme (Fig. 3 b) can then be followed for non-PCR cloning of other H chains encoded by the same locus via their transfer to our vector Bluntzeo using appropriate restriction sites (Fig. 3 b).Construction of the Final Expression Vector for 33H11 and UK4 and the HybridsThe L (ompA-Vλ-Cλ) and subsequently the H (ompA-VH-CH1) chain variable and constant domains along with the ompA signal sequence were inserted into the final expression vector pAWtac via our new vectors V4 (pAGP2 λ equivalent) and V8 (pAGP1 equivalent) employing the scheme described in Fig. 1 b. In brief, the L chains of the three antibodies (B3, 33H11, or UK4) were singly inserted into pAWtac asXhoI-EcoRI fragments thus constructing the three intermediate vectors, one for each antibody L chain: pAWtac-L (B3), pAWtac-L (33H11), and pAWtac-L (UK4). The three H chains were finally singly inserted in each of the three constructs as EcoRI fragments, thus allowing the construction of the two-antibody (in addition to the earlier cloned B3) and six-hybrid final expression vectors. The key to the legends used in the figures is as follows: letters B, R, and U denote B3, 33H11, and UK4 respectively; the first of the two letters name of the Fab construct denotes the L chain and the second of the letters the H chain.Expression, Detection, and Functional Assessment of the FabsThe final expression vectors for the eight constructs were transferred to the expression strain W3110. The induction experiments, preparation of periplasm, dot blot, SDS-PAGE gel, Western blot analysis, and the functional assessment by anti-DNA antibody ELISA of the expressed Fabs were conducted as earlier described for B3 Fab. Anti-cardiolipin activity of the nine Fabs was determined using an anti-cardiolipin antibody ELISA as described previously (8Menon S. Rahman M.A. Ravirajan C.T. Kandiah D. Longhurst C.M. McNally T.

In the larval midgut of the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta, the VO complex is made up of four subunits with apparent molecular masses of 100 (a), 40 (d), 20 (e) and 17 (c) kDa. The hydrophilic portion, V1 ATPase, consists of eight distinct subunits of molecular mass 67 (A), 56 (B), 54 (H), 40 (C), 32 (D), 28 (E), 16 (G), and 14 kDa (F). Three interdigitating copies each of the nucleotide-binding subunits A and B form a head piece at the top of the molecule, whereas the remaining V1 subunits form a stalk connecting the head piece to the VO complex (3Wieczorek H.

J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 71-80Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Studies on the bovine clathrin-coated V-ATPase have shown that disulfide bond formation between the conserved residues Cys254 and Cys532 of the catalytic A subunit leads to reversible inactivation of the enzyme (12Feng Y. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19769-19772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Feng Y. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13224-13230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Such a reversibly inactivated, disulfide-bonded state has been found in significant fractions of V-ATPase in native clathrin-coated vesicles (12Feng Y. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19769-19772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Disulfide bonds at the catalytic site of the V-ATPase are also induced by the nitric oxide-generating reagent S-nitrosoglutathione (14Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1301-1305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the finding that in Neurospora crassa oxidizing and reducing agents have inhibitory and stabilizing effects, respectively, on the enzyme (15Dschida W.J.A. Bowman B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1557-1563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Moreover, a mutation in the cysteine biosynthetic pathway in yeast leads to defective vacuolar acidification, which can be corrected by a C261V mutation, suggesting that disulfide bond formation can cause inhibition of V-ATPase activity in vivo (16Oluwatosin Y.E. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 272: 28149-28157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (57) Google Scholar).In the present paper we show for the first time that reducing the V1 ATPase of M. sexta leads to significant structural changes in the head and bottom pieces of the complex. Altered mobility of the V1 subunits in polyacrylamide gels, decreased tryptophan fluorescence, and trypsin susceptibility are discussed in the light of these structural changes.RESULTSRemoving of the sulfhydryl-reducing agent, mercapthoethanol, from the purified V1 ATPase from M. sexta dropped the enzyme acticity from 1.8 to 0.6 μmol ATP of hydrolyzed per milligram of protein per minute. That inhibition of ATPase activity can be abolished by the addition of DTT, increasing the activity to 2.1 μmol of ATP hydrolyzed per milligram of protein per minute.As a preliminary to x-ray solution scattering experiments, the fluorescence emission of the oxidized and reduced state of the V1 ATPase was monitored using the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence, to determine whether or not the inhibition coincides with conformational changes in the enzyme. The V1 ATPase from M. sexta contains 21 tryptophans: 6, 1, 8, and 6 in subunits A, B, H, and C, respectively (36Gräf R. Novak F.J.S. Harvey W.R. Wieczorek H. FEBS Lett. 1992; 300: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 37Novak F.J.S. Gräf R. Waring R. Wolfersberger M.G. Wieczorek H. Harvey W.R. Biochim Biophys.

Acta. 2000; 1467: 369-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The reduction of V1(Fig. 1) decreases the quantum yield markedly, suggesting that at least changes of the secondary structure occur as a result of disulfide formation and/or interaction of tryptophan residue(s) with side chains (39Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1983Crossref Google Scholar).The conformational changes were investigated further by x-ray scattering to determine whether or not they were accompanied by changes of the quaternary structure of the V1 complex. The experimental solution scattering curves of the V1 ATPase under nonreducing conditions and that after reduction by DTT are presented in Fig. 2. The radii of gyration (Rg) of the oxidized and reduced V1 complex differ noticeably: 6.20 ± 0.06 and 5.84 ± 0.06 nm, respectively, whereas the maximum dimensions (Dmax) of both complexes remain the same: 22.0 ± 0.1 nm. Comparison of the normalized forward scattering with the values obtained for a reference of bovine serum albumin yields 560 ± 15 kDa for both forms, in agreement with that expected from the chemical composition of the V1 ATPase. This indicates that both forms of the V1 ATPase are monomeric in solution. The distance distribution functions in Fig.3 are typical for elongated particles. The fraction of larger distances is significantly diminished in the p(r) function upon reduction by DTT, suggesting that the particle becomes more compact in the reduced state than in the oxidized state of the enzyme.Figure 2Experimental and calculated scattering data from the V 1 ATPase.

The search volume was a sphere of radius r = 11 nm, and the packing radius of the dummy atoms was ra = 0.625 nm, yielding a total of 4028 atoms in the search volume. Out of these dummy atoms, 714 and 654 were ascribed to the particle in the final DAMs of the oxidized and reduced V1 complex, respectively, yielding excluded volumes of 986 and 904 nm3 and radii of gyration of 6.15 and 5.79 nm for the two models, respectively. The discrepancy with respect to the experimental data after subtracting a constant is about χ = 0.8 in both cases, and the final fits are presented in Fig. 2.Figure 4Low resolution models of the oxidized V1 ATPase (left panel) and reduced V1 ATPase (right panel). The radius of the sphere is 0.625 nm. The models were displayed on a SUN Workstation using the program ASSA (59Dietz K.-J. Heber U. Mimura T. Biochim. Biophys.

Ubbink-Kok T. Lolkema J.S. Brisson A. Konings W.N. Photosyn. Res. 1998; 57: 267-273Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and M. sexta (33Radermacher M. Ruiz T. Harvey W.R. Wieczorek H. Grüber G. FEBS Lett. 1999; 453: 383-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) obtained by electron microscopy and x-ray small angle scattering, respectively. Comparison of the two models in Fig. 4 indicates that the reduction of V1 ATPase makes the peripheral regions of the molecule more compact; these changes take place both in the globular head, where the major subunits A and B are located (32Boekema E.J. Ubbink-Kok T. Lolkema J.S. Brisson A. Konings W.N. Photosyn. Res. 1998; 57: 267-273Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 33Radermacher M. Ruiz T. Harvey W.R. Wieczorek H. Grüber G.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17659-17663Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and in the elongated stalk. At the top of the oxidized V1 complex a crown-like structure can be observed (Fig. 4, left panel), which is similar to the top domain of the quaternary structure of this complex that was determined from solution scattering data (40Svergun D.I. Konrad S. Huss M. Koch M.H.J. Wieczorek H. Altendorf K. Volkov V.V. Grüber G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17659-17663Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) using the ab initio shape determination procedure,SASHA (simulated annealing algorithm). In the reduced form this crown has an arrow-like shape. A prominent feature of the oxidized V1 ATPase is the approximately 3.5-nm wide protuberance at the bottom of the stalk. A similar protuberance is observed at the same site of the central stalk in electron micrographs of the V1 molecule from C. fervidus (32Boekema E.J. Ubbink-Kok T. Lolkema J.S. Brisson A. Konings W.N. Photosyn. Res. 1998; 57: 267-273Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). An intriguing observation is the conformational change of this protuberance into a wedge-like feature at the bottom of the stalk, because of reduction of the V1 molecule (Fig. 4,right panel). In summary, the V1 ATPase has an elongated mushroom-like shape with a head piece of approximately 15 and 16 nm in diameter in the oxidized and reduced V1ATPase, respectively, and a stalk that is about 11.5 nm long.The information content in solution scattering data is usually related to the number of Shannon channels (41Shannon C.E. Weaver W. The Mathematical Theory of Communication. University of Illinois Press, Urbana, IL1949Google Scholar, 42Moore P.B. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1980; 13: 168-175Crossref Google Scholar) in the experimental range. In our case this number is equal to Ns = smax Dmax /π = 15.4, and the use of thousands of spheres for ab initio shape retrieval might raise fears that the data would be over-interpreted. The shape of the oxidized V1 ATPase (Fig. 4, left panel) is very similar to the molecular envelope computed earlier from the solution scattering data using another ab initio shape determination procedure (40Svergun D.I. Konrad S. Huss M. Koch M.H.J. Wieczorek H. Altendorf K. Volkov V.V. Grüber G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17659-17663Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Given that the particle envelope in the latter study was described using only 17 free parameters, it is obvious that the effective number of independent parameters in the models presented here is much smaller than the number of dummy atoms in the search volume. The model in the simulated annealing algorithm procedure was kept at low resolution by the looseness penalty, and their spatial resolution is defined solely by the range of the data fitted as 2π/smax = 2.8 nm. Several independent shape restorations were performed to check the stability of the solution and yielded results very similar to those presented in Fig. 4.Firm evidence that reduction of the V1 molecule affects its structure was also obtained from tryptic digests of the protein in the nonreduced and reduced state. The time course of proteolysis was probed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig.5). Tryptic proteolysis of V1is characterized by a rapid cleavage of subunit B yielding two fragments, with apparent molecular masses of 25 and 34 kDa, respectively, as determined by MALDI mass spectrometry (Fig. 5 and Ref.43Grüber G. Radermacher M. Ruiz T. Godovac-Zimmermann J. Canas C. Kleine-Kohlbrecher D. Huss M. Harvey W.R. Wieczorek H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8609-8616Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). With a longer incubation time (up to 25 min) subunit B was cleaved further, thereby increasing the amount of the 25- and 34-kDa fragments. Among the stalk subunits C–H, subunit D was cleaved most rapidly, followed by subunits F, G, C, A, and H, with subunit E being cleaved the most slowly. By contrast, reduction of the V1ATPase by DTT causes slow cleavage of the complex; the subunits B, D, and F become remarkably stable toward the proteolytic activity of trypsin.Figure 5Time course of trypsin cleavage of the oxidized and reduced V1 ATPase from M. sexta(A).

Samples were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 17.5% total acrylamide and 0.4% cross-linked acrylamide gel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Many disulfide bond-containing proteins migrate faster in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis than do their reduced counterparts, presumably because the form containing disulfide is more compact (44Dunker A.K. Kenyon A.J. Biochem. J. 1976; 153: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Thus migration of proteins on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions can be used as a sensitive measure of the extent of native disulfide bond formation (45Scheele G. Jakoby R. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12277-12282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46Bardwell J.C.A. McGovern K. Beckwith J. Cell. 1991; 67: 581-589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). When applied onto a polyacrylamide gel (Fig.6 A), subunit A of the oxidized form (lane 3) migrates as a diffuse band (A1), which becomes more defined toward the anode (A2). Prolonged electrophoresis resolved A1 and A2 in two bands with apparent molecular masses of 64 and 62 kDa, respectively (Fig.6 B). By comparison, the reduced form of subunit A migrates as a defined band of approximately 64 kDa (lane 2), a molecular mass similar to that of A1 (lane 3). The bands A1 and A2 were identified as subunit A by MALDI mass spectrometry (not shown). Using a variety of available software packages for mass fingerprinting, we identified 20 peptides covering 46% of the subunit A sequence. However, we were not able to monitor unequivocally the appearance of disulfide bond formation between Cys254 and Cys532. This might be due to the incompleteness of in-gel tryptic digestion of the polypeptides used for mass spectrometry, which covers only 46% of the subunit A sequence. Moreover, the molecular mass difference of 2 Da between cystine and two cysteine residues can not be easily analyzed by MALDI mass spectrometry because of the broad isotope distribution at high carbon numbers and/or imperfect sample purity because of the partially hydrolyzed asparagine or glutamine residues (47Svoboda M. Meister W. Vetter W. J. Mass Spectrom. 1995; 30: 1562-1566Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar).Figure 6Analysis of the mobility of the oxidized and reduced V1 complex.

The effect of CaATP binding to the enzyme was investigated by x-ray scattering to determine whether or not it was accompanied by changes of the quaternary structure of V1. The use of CaATP as a substrate prevents possible inhomogeneity of the electron density because of the methanol, included in the MgATP assay (48Kuprin S. Gräslund A. Ehrenberg A. Koch M.H.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 217: 1151-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 49Mashimo S. Umehara T. J. Phys. Chem. 1991; 95: 6257-6260Crossref Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In this approach CaATP was added to the enzyme prior to removing of sulfhydryl reagents (see “Experimental Procedures”). The radius of gyration for the enzyme oxidized in the presence of CaATP was found to be 6.12 ± 0.04 nm. The scattering curve and the corresponding distance distribution function (not shown) nearly coincide with that of the oxidized enzyme (see above), indicating that the quaternary structure of the oxidized form is not altered significantly by the presence of CaATP prior to oxidation.DISCUSSIONVacuolar ATPases have been shown to be sensitive to the redox state of their environment (11Forgac M. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 71-80Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Feng Y. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19769-19772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Feng Y. Forgac M. J. Biol.

A mechanism of reversible disulfide bond formation between cysteine residues at the catalytic A subunit has been proposed to regulate the V-ATPase in vivo(13Feng Y. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13224-13230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1301-1305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Cys254 and Cys532 in subunit A of the bovine clathrin-coated V-ATPase have been shown to form this disulfide bond, leading to reversible inhibition of V-ATPase activity (13Feng Y. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13224-13230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Cys254 residue is located in the sequence of the phosphate-binding motif (G XGKTV), called the P-loop, whereas Cys532 is located in the C-terminal part and in close proximity to the adenine binding pocket of the nucleotide (50Zhang J. Vasilyeva E. Feng Y Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15494-15500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). These residues are conserved as cysteines in the A subunit of the V-ATPase from M. sexta (36Gräf R. Novak F.J.S. Harvey W.R. Wieczorek H. FEBS Lett. 1992; 300: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). It has been predicted that a disulfide bond between both residues would lock the enzyme into a closed conformation with nucleotide (ADP) unable to get out (11Forgac M. J. Exp.

The low resolution structure of the oxidized and reduced V1 ATPase, derived from experimental data, display a characteristic mushroom-like shape, with a head piece containing the nucleotide-binding subunits A and B (32Boekema E.J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 15494-15500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), whose N termini form a β-barrel domain in a crown-like fashion (51Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2734) Google Scholar, 52Bakhtiari N. Lai-Zhang J. Yao B. Mueller D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16363-16369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), the conformational changes at the top of the V1 ATPase presumably are due to rearrangements in the N termini of the A and B subunits. In agreement with this assignment are the two-dimensional average images of the V1VO ATPase from bovine clathrin-coated vesicles, where elongated features, attributed at least in part to the N termini of subunit A, can be seen (53Wilkens S. Vasilyeva E. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31804-31810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). As shown more recently by three-dimensional reconstruction of the related F1FO ATPase from Escherichia coli, a crown-like shape, which was not present in the absence of the nucleotide, evolves upon binding of the noncleavable nucleotide analogue AMP-PNP to the catalytic β subunit (54Böttcher B. Bertsche I. Reuter R. Gräber P. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Rearrangements in the N-terminal domains of the α and β subunits at the very top of F1 ATPase have been implicated in this structural alteration of the crown (54Böttcher B. Bertsche I. Reuter R. Gräber P. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Moreover, when AMP-PNP or ADP is bound to its catalytic site, subunit β adopts to the closed conformation, in which the adenine-binding pocket moves into close proximity of the P-loop and away when the binding site is empty (open conformation), as shown by the crystallographic models of the α3β3γ subcomplex of bovine heart (51Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2734) Google Scholar) and rat liver (55Bianchet M.A. Hullihen J. Pedersen P.L. Amzel M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11065-11070Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) F1 ATPase. There is a striking similarity in the fact that the crown structure of the E. coliF1FO ATPase (54Böttcher B. Bertsche I. Reuter R. Gräber P. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) evolves after binding of AMP-PNP (closed conformation), whereas a crown-like feature can be observed in the oxidized V1 ATPase, a state, in which the catalytic A subunit is proposed to be in a closed conformation (11Forgac M. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 71-80Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,14Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1301-1305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and turns into a wedge-like shape after reduction of V1. Consistent with these features are the similarity of the radii of gyration and the distance distribution functions of the oxidized form and the V1 ATPase that has been oxidized in the presence of CaATP.The conformational changes in the head piece because of reduction of the enzyme are in line with structural alterations in the stalk region (Fig. 4), which can be expected when the stalk couples catalytic site events with ion conduction in the VO portion. In particular the protuberance at the bottom of the stalk alters into a wedge-like shape after reduction and could enable the enzyme to transmit the activation events in the head piece to the VO complex. A model has been proposed in which V1 becomes released from VO by oxidation (15Dschida W.J.A. Bowman B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1557-1563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In this model, oxidizing agents like nitrate inhibit the V-ATPase by promoting the formation of a disulfide bond, followed by the release of V1. Whether the structural changes of the protuberance observed in the present studies cause dissociation of the V1 complex cannot be resolved at this stage, although the broadening of the base of the stalk suggests a change in binding strength.Strong evide"

The conserved features of this family are two membrane-spanning domains, usually with six transmembrane sequences each and two cytoplasmic nucleotide-binding domains (NBD). CFTR also contains a unique regulatory (R) domain. The membrane-spanning domains show topological similarity but little or no sequence similarity between different ABC transporters. In contrast, the NBDs show significant sequence conservation throughout the family. In CFTR, the membrane-spanning domains form an anion-selective pore (4Dawson D.C. Smith S.S. Mansoura M.K. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 47-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The channel can open after the R domain is phosphorylated. Then ATP binding and hydrolysis by the two NBDs open and close the pore (5Sheppard D.N. Welsh M.J. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 23-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar,6Gadsby D.C. Nairn A.C. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79 Suppl. 1: 77-107Crossref Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Previous studies have probed the structure and function of the CFTR NBDs by examining the functional consequences of applying nucleotide analogs and introducing site-directed mutations; those studies indicate that both NBD1 and NBD2 determine channel gating (for reviews see Refs.5Sheppard D.N. Welsh M.J. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 23-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar, 6Gadsby D.C. Nairn A.C. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79 Suppl. 1: 77-107Crossref Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 7Foskett J.K.

In addition, numerous mutations in the NBDs cause cystic fibrosis (8Welsh M.J. Tsui L.-C. Boat T.F. Beaudet A.L. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill, Inc., New York1995: 3799-3876Google Scholar). An important recent advance in understanding ABC transporters came when the three-dimensional crystal structures of three prokaryotic NBD proteins were solved (9Hung L.-W. Wang I.X. Nikaido K. Liu P.-Q. Ames G.F.-L. Kim S.-H. Nature. 1998; 396: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar,10Shyamala V. Baichwal V. Beall E. Ames G.F. J. Biol.

The structure of the ATP-binding subunit of the bacterial histidine transporter (HisP) provides a model for the binding of ATP to an NBD (9Hung L.-W. Wang I.X. Nikaido K. Liu P.-Q. Ames G.F.-L. Kim S.-H. Nature. 1998; 396: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). ATP binds to the surface of the NBD near an angle formed between the two “arms” of the NBD. Most of the nucleoside is solvent-exposed, and the β phosphate is buried by extensive hydrogen bonding with the Walker A phosphate binding loop (Ser41 to Lys45 and Ser46). One residue (His19) contacts the ribose of ATP. In addition, the side chain of a tyrosine residue (Tyr16) binds to the adenine ring of ATP through a hydrophobic interaction to bury almost half of the surface area of the nucleotide base (172 Å2). No other residues from HisP contact the adenine ring. Mutational studies of HisP confirm that Tyr16 plays a critical role in nucleotide binding; mutation of Tyr16 to Ser abolished both ATP binding and histidine transport (10Shyamala V. Baichwal V. Beall E. Ames G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18714-18719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The structures of LivF2 and the amino-terminal NBD of RbsA (11Armstrong S. Tabernero L. Zhang H. Hermodson M. Stauffacher C. Ped. Pulmonol., Suppl. 1998; 17: 91-92PubMed Google Scholar) show a very similar binding interaction between the NBD and ATP. In both cases, an aromatic residue (phenylalanine) stacks in a hydrophobic interaction with the adenine ring of ATP, and the remainder of the nucleotide base and ribose are solvent-exposed. Moreover, sequence alignment of other ABC transporter NBDs reveals a conserved aromatic amino acid 20–30 amino acids upstream of the start of the Walker A motif, in a relative position similar to that of Tyr16 in HisP (12Linton K.J. Higgins C.F. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 5-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 13Croop J. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 292: 101-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 14Schneider E. Hunke S. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1998; 22: 1-20Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We hypothesized that each NBD of CFTR contains a phenylalanine or tyrosine residue upstream of the Walker A motif that is a contact for ATP binding. We predicted that changing the chemical structure of this side chain would decrease ATP binding and thereby reduce channel activity. To test this hypothesis, we mutated six candidate residues to cysteine (four in NBD1 and two in NBD2) and measured changes in channel activity. We also examined the effect of applying MTSET to the channel to learn whether modification of an accessible cysteine would alter function. MTSET was purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals Inc. (Ontario, Canada). cAMP-dependent protein kinase was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). Lipofectin was obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. All other reagents were obtained from Sigma. CFTR mutants were prepared in the pTM1-CFTR4 plasmid (15Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4900) Google Scholar). Mutations were verified by both restriction enzyme analysis and by sequencing around the site of mutation. Wild-type and mutant CFTR proteins were transiently expressed in HeLa cells using the vaccinia virus/T7 expression system as described previously (16Anderson M.P. Welsh M.J. Science. 1992; 257: 1701-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Cells were studied 4–24 h after transfection, depending on the level of expression desired. Methods for excised, inside-out patch-clamp recordings were as described previously (17Carson M.R. Travis S.M. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1711-1717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Experiments were performed at 34–37 °C. The pipette (extracellular) solution contained: 140 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine, 100 mmaspartic acid, 35.5 mm HCl, 5 mmCaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm TES, pH 7.3, with 1 N HCl. The bath (intracellular) solution contained: 140 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine, 135.5 mm HCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 10 mm TES, 4 mm Cs(OH)2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na2ATP, pH 7.3, with 1 N HCl. MTSET was added to the cytosolic surface of patches at 200 μm final concentration. MTSET stock solutions were made fresh in ddH2O and stored on ice for less than 4 h. Data from patches containing many channels and patches containing 1–3 channels were collected at −40 and −80 mV, respectively. Data were filtered at 1 kHz using a variable eight-pole Bessel filter (Frequency Devices Inc., Haverhill, MA) and digitized at 5 kHz. Open state probability was determined from patches containing 1–3 channels. Data analysis was done using the pClamp 6.0 software package (Axon Instruments Inc., Foster City, CA). Fitting of data from patches containing many channels was performed using IgorPro 2.0 (WaveMetrics, Inc., Lake Oswego, OR). Data are presented as mean ± S.E. forn observations. Statistical significance was determined as indicated in the figure legends. p values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. In HisP, Tyr16 binds the adenine base of ATP (9Hung L.-W. Wang I.X. Nikaido K. Liu P.-Q. Ames G.F.-L. Kim S.-H. Nature. 1998; 396: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). To identify aromatic amino acids in CFTR that might have a function analogous to that of Tyr16, we compared the sequence of CFTR NBD1 and NBD2 to that of HisP (Fig.1). From the alignment with CFTR NBD1, we identified three potential aromatic homologues for HisP Tyr16: Phe429, Phe430, and Phe433. In NBD2, only Tyr1219 was a good homology candidate. Phe446 (NBD1) and Phe1232(NBD2) are also upstream of the Walker A domain in the predicted NBD domain. Although the HisP structure suggests that the side chains of Phe446 and Phe1232 face the protein interior where they stabilize domain structure, a phenylalanine is conserved at this position in CFTR from several species. Because of the sequence conservation, we chose to study these two residues in addition to the more obvious candidates. To test potential interactions between these residues and ATP, we mutated each to cysteine. When expressed in HeLa cells, CFTR-F429C, F430C, F433C, F446C, Y1219C, and F1232C all generated Cl−channel activity in excised, inside-out patches of membrane. Similar to wild-type CFTR, activity for each mutant required both cAMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation and ATP (data not shown). All the mutants had an open state probability (Po) similar to that of wild-type CFTR (TableI). The apparent pattern of single-channel gating in patches with one to three channels was not remarkably different for any of the mutants (not shown). In contrast, previously studied mutations in the NBD Walker A and B motifs reducePo by inhibiting nucleotide hydrolysis and possibly binding (17Carson M.R. Travis S.M. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1711-1717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 18Gunderson K.L. Kopito R.R.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1463-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and most current models of CFTR gating predict that nucleotide binding to each NBD is necessary to support activity (6Gadsby D.C. Nairn A.C. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79 Suppl. 1: 77-107Crossref Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 18Gunderson K.L. Kopito R.R.

These data suggest that mutation of the aromatic residues did not markedly disrupt the interaction of ATP with the NBDs. Because mutation of Try16 in HisP results in a large reduction in ATP binding and HisP function, our data suggest that the aromatic residues in CFTR have a role different from Tyr16in HisP.Table IOpen state probability (Po) of CFTR containing mutations of the aromatic residues identified in Fig. 1.ConstructPoWT0.29 ± 0.04F429C0.21 ± 0.03F430C0.30 ± 0.03F433C0.21 ± 0.03F446C0.34 ± 0.06Y1219C0.26 ± 0.07F1232C0.35 ± 0.02Data are mean ± S.E. from excised, inside-out patches containing one to three channels.

One potential consequence of altering NBD interactions with the adenine ring of ATP would be a change in the rank order of activity supported by different nucleoside triphosphates. We found that ATP generated more Cl− current than GTP or CTP in membrane patches containing multiple wild-type CFTR channel (Fig.2 A). These data are consistent with the results of earlier studies (21Anderson M.P. Berger H.A. Rich D.P. Gregory R.J. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. Cell. 1991; 67: 775-784Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). HisP and the histidine transporter complex have a similar specificity (22Ames G.F. Nikaido K. Groarke J. Petithory J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3998-4002Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If the aromatic residues in CFTR interact with the adenine ring of ATP, mutating these residues could alter the nucleotide specificity of CFTR. However, we found that the three nucleoside triphosphates generated relative amounts of current in the mutants that were similar to that of wild-type CFTR (Fig. 2 B). These data indicate that the aromatic residues do not play a key role in the ability of CFTR to discriminate between nucleoside triphosphate species. The location and function of Tyr16 in HisP indicate that it is solvent accessible. To learn whether the residues we identified in the CFTR NBDs might play a role in CFTR function, we reacted each aromatic to Cys mutant with MTSET. If the candidate residues are accessible, covalent modification of the inserted cysteine would introduce a positive charge and create a local environment substantially different from the hydrophobic aromatic ring of the wild-type residues. MTSET (200 μm) slowly decreased current of wild-type CFTR in the presence of ATP (Fig. 3), suggesting that the protein contains a cysteine that, when modified, inhibits channel function. Table II shows the apparent rate of inactivation based on an exponential fit to each curve. The NBD1 cysteine mutants were inactivated slowly at rates similar to wild-type (Fig. 3 and Table II). These data suggest that the cysteines introduced in NBD1 (at positions 429, 430, 433, and 446) either were not accessible for MTSET modification or their modification did not alter function (Fig. 3 and Table II). CFTR-Y1219C was more rapidly inactivated than wild-type, and CFTR-F1232C showed a tendency for more rapid inactivation (0.05 < p < 0.10). These data suggest that a cysteine inserted in NBD2 could be modified by MTSET to inhibit the channel, but the effect was small resulting in only a 2–3-fold increase in the reaction rate. If the residue was solvent-exposed, we expect a much more rapid inactivation (see below).Table IIApparent first-order rate constant of MTSET inhibition of CFTR current in the presence of 1 mm ATPCFTR variantkm−1s−1Wild-type23.1 ± 6.4F429C27.0 ± 16.7F430C34.6 ± 22.8F433C19.0 ± 5.5F446C36.1 ± 15.8Y1219C75.5 ± 20.1*F1232C68.5 ± 19.6Rate constants were determined from patches containing many channels by an exponential fit to the decrease in current following the addition of MTSET (200 μm).

Asterisk indicates p < 0.05 compared to wild-type (n ≥ 3 for each construct). If ATP normally binds an aromatic residue in NBD1 and NBD2, then it might interfere with the ability of MTSET to modify a cysteine at that position. That is, the presence of ATP might reduce access of MTSET to the introduced cysteine. At 1 mm ATP as we used above, the channel is almost maximally active; thus nucleotide occupancy of the NBDs may be high (23Travis S.M. Carson M.R. Ries D.R. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15336-15339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Winter M.C. Sheppard D.N. Carson M.R. Welsh M.J. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 1398-1403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), and ATP might have blocked accessibility of the introduced cysteine. Therefore, we tested the ability of MTSET to modify and inactivate the cysteine mutants in the absence of nucleotide. Fig. 4 A shows an example of current from each of the cysteine mutants; MTSET was applied for 60 s in the absence of ATP. Upon readdition of ATP, current did not completely return to its starting values. This was due to a combination of current rundown (25Jia Y. Mathews C.J. Hanrahan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4978-4984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 26Weinreich F. Riordan J.R. Nagel G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 55-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), which was also present in the negative control for each channel and MTSET inhibition. A summary of these data is shown in Fig. 4 B. Wild-type, CFTR-F429C, F430C, F433C, and F1232C all exhibited similar levels of activity after treatment with 200 μm MTSET in the absence of ATP. We interpret these data to mean that ATP did not compete with the ability of MTSET inactivation of these channels. In these experiments of modification without ATP, MTSET inhibited CFTR-Y1219C to a greater extent than wild-type CFTR and the other NBD mutants (Fig. 4, A and B). However, because MTSET also inactivated CFTR-Y1219C faster than the other channels in the presence of 1 mm ATP (Table II), we expected a greater inhibition during the timed application of MTSET in the absence of ATP. In the presence of ATP (Fig. 3), a 60-s treatment with MTSET reduced CFTR-Y1219C current to 47 ± 7% (n = 8) of the initial value. In the absence of ATP (Fig. 4), a 60-s treatment with MTSET reduced current to 26 ± 12% (n = 6) of the initial value. When we subtract the measured channel rundown of 37 ± 16% for CFTR-Y1219C (because of the time for washing and the absence of ATP), we expected a current that was 30% of the basal value. The close agreement of the measured and predicted values indicates that ATP did not interfere with the ability of MTSET to inactivate CFTR-Y1219C. To confirm more directly that the rate at which MTSET inactivated CFTR-Y1219C was independent of ATP, we examined the rate of inhibition in the presence of 25 μm ATP. This low ATP concentration is significantly below the EC50 value of ATP for CFTR under the conditions used in this study (21Anderson M.P. Berger H.A. Rich D.P. Gregory R.J. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. Cell. 1991; 67: 775-784Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Thus ATP occupancy of the NBDs should be low. If ATP interferes with MTSET modification and inactivation of CFTR-Y1219C, we expect to see a faster inactivation rate constant. Fig. 5 shows an example. The rate of inactivation for CFTR-Y1219C in 25 μm ATP (140 ± 81 m−1 s−1,n = 4) was ∼4 times the rate of inactivation for wild-type CFTR in 25 μm ATP (38 ± 3m−1 s−1, n = 3), similar to the ratio of CFTR-Y1219C inactivation to wild-type CFTR inactivation in 1 mm ATP. The rates of inactivation for each channel in 25 μm ATP were not significantly different from the rates in 1 mm ATP. These results indicate that ATP did not alter MTSET modification of CFTR-Y1219C. In contrast to the other channels, CFTR-F446C showed a more striking inhibition by MTSET in the absence than in the presence of ATP (compare Fig. 4, A and B, with Fig. 3) that was not explained by the rate of inhibition observed in the presence of ATP (Table II). This difference suggested either that nucleotide protected Cys446 from modification by MTSET or that binding of nucleotide caused a conformational change in CFTR that protected Cys446. To distinguish between these possibilities, we measured MTSET inhibition in the presence of ADP. ADP binds to CFTR NBDs and competes with ATP but does not support channel activity (16Anderson M.P. Welsh M.J. Science. 1992; 257: 1701-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar,23Travis S.M. Carson M.R. Ries D.R. Welsh M.J. J. Biol.

These data suggest that ATP and ADP occupancy of the NBD protected the protein from MTSET modification. We interpreted this to mean that Phe446 was located near the nucleotide binding site. The recent solutions of NBD crystal structures from prokaryotes provide a very important framework for understanding the structure and function of the NBDs of all ABC transporters, (9Hung L.-W. Wang I.X. Nikaido K. Liu P.-Q. Ames G.F.-L. Kim S.-H. Nature. 1998; 396: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar, 11Armstrong S. Tabernero L. Zhang H. Hermodson M. Stauffacher C. Ped. Pulmonol., Suppl. 1998; 17: 91-92PubMed Google Scholar).2Undoubtedly, the major features of these structures will apply throughout the family, but it is likely that there will be important structural and hence functional differences between individual members of the family. Here we tested one prediction of these structures in CFTR. An aromatic amino acid is conserved upstream of the Walker A motif of most ABC transporters (13Croop J. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 292: 101-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 14Schneider E. Hunke S. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1998; 22: 1-20Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The recent crystal structure of HisP implicates this residue, Tyr16, as a critical binding contact for the adenine ring of ATP. Mutation of this residue (Y16S) abolished the ability of HisP to bind ATP and consequently disrupted transport (10Shyamala V. Baichwal V. Beall E. Ames G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18714-18719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In CFTR, we identified aromatic residues that might be analogous to Tyr16; we found four candidates in NBD1 and two in NBD2. However, mutating these residues to cysteine failed to reduce Po. These results suggested that these residues do not have an important role in ATP binding. The location and function of residue 16 in HisP indicates that it is solvent exposed. However, the rates at which MTSET inactivated the NBD1 mutants were not significantly different from wild-type CFTR. Even though CFTR-Y1219C showed a faster inactivation than wild-type CFTR, this difference was small. Importantly, the inactivation rates were very slow relative to the reaction rate of MTSET with free thiols (28Stauffer D.A. Karlin A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6840-6849Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). The inactivation rates were also much slower than those measured for cysteines introduced into the Walker A motif or the LSGGQ motif of CFTR (29Cotten J.F. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31873-31879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). There are two interpretations of these data. The residues were not modified, suggesting that they are not solvent-exposed and not readily accessible. Alternatively the residues were modified but there were no major functional consequences. In either case, these results suggest that ATP binding may not involve the coordination of the adenine ring by an aromatic residue analogous to that in HisP, LivF, and RbsA. Although we think it less likely, an aromatic residue could stabilize ATP binding in CFTR; however, that residue would have to be located in a different region of the primary sequence. CFTR-F446C was the only channel in which nucleotide altered the inactivation rate. In the presence of ATP or ADP, MTSET inactivated the channel at a rate indistinguishable from wild-type CFTR. But in the absence of nucleotide, inactivation was faster. These data suggest that either residue 446 is near the nucleotide binding site and there is competition between MTSET and nucleotide or perhaps there is not direct competition, but nucleotide binding makes residue 446 less accessible. Our data do not allow a definitive distinction between these possibilities. However, we favor the later alternative because the unchanged Po relative to wild-type CFTR before covalent modification suggests that the phenylalanine side chain is not involved in stabilizing ATP binding. The data also suggest a relatively high degree of nucleotide occupancy at NBD1. That is, the time between ADP dissociation and ATP binding in the hydrolysis cycle, when Cys446 would be accessible to MTSET inhibition, must be relatively brief when the channel is studied in the presence of 1 mm ATP. This conclusion is consistent with nucleotide occlusion studies suggesting that NBD1 rapidly binds nucleotide, whereas ATP hydrolysis or ADP release are much slower (30Szabo K. Szakacs G. Hegeds T. Sarkadi B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12209-12212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The solvent accessibility of the nucleotide base and ribose in ABC transporter NBDs (9Hung L.-W. Wang I.X. Nikaido K. Liu P.-Q. Ames G.F.-L. Kim S.-H.

Although there is considerable diversity in the structural elements that bind nucleotide, many other proteins bind nucleotide in a cleft, with protein contacts on either side of the aromatic ring.

These interactions provide varying degrees of nucleotide specificity because of hydrogen bonding between the protein and the atoms associated with positions 1, 2, and 6 of the purine ring. These contacts allow discrimination between ATP, GTP, and pyrimidines. However, in CFTR and other ABC transporters, most of the energy for nucleotide binding may be contributed by the phosphate binding loop (Walker A). Alternatively, other regions of the protein outside a monomeric NBD might contribute to a pocket that binds the nucleotide base and ribose. The former possibility is supported by the low degree of nucleotide specificity in ABC transporters (22Ames G.F. Nikaido K. Groarke J. Petithory J. J. Biol.

Taken together, our findings of poor nucleotide discrimination for CFTR and the absence of a conserved critical aromatic contact in CFTR NBDs suggest that ATP is even more solvent-exposed when bound to CFTR NBDs than when bound to the bacterial NBDs. This structural model differs substantially from the nucleotide binding clefts of other superfamilies of nucleotide-binding proteins. This model may explain the finding that peptides that contain the CFTR Walker A motif but not much sequence closer to the amino terminus still bind ATP with high affinity (41Thomas P.J. Shenbagamurthi P. Ysern X. Pedersen P.L. Science. 1991; 251: 555-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 42Thomas P.J. Shenbagamurthi P. Sondek J. Hullihen J.M. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5727-5730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The superficial nature of the ATP binding model we propose for CFTR could also explain the observation that cysteine residues in the Walker A motifs of P-glycoprotein are accessible for disulfide-mediated cross-linking to large protein domains that would not be expected to enter a binding cleft (43Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19435-19438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that the aromatic residue, which binds the adenine ring of ATP in the structure of several prokaryotic NBDs, is not conserved in CFTR. Our data also highlight the considerable flexibility in the nucleotide-binding site of CFTR and to a model in which most of the binding energy for ATP is contributed by the phosphate groups.

The membrane distal catalytic domain (D2), while possessing a distinct, yet weaker in vitro activity, does not dephosphorylate any cellular substrates identified to date. A conserved D2 domain is present in many receptor-like PTPs (RPTPs), yet all have undetectable or extremely low activity. This indicates a non-redundant function of the tandem domains, with D2 perhaps playing a regulatory role.

CD45-D2 is specifically required, independent of any catalytic activity, for the in vivorecognition by CD45-D1 of its substrate, the T-cell receptor ζ-chain (18Kashio N. Matsumoto W. Parker S.

The in vitro interaction of PTPδ-D2 with D1 of PTPς inhibits PTPς-D1 activity, suggesting that D2 may regulate the formation and activity of receptor heterodimers (19Wallace M. Fladd C. Batt J. Rotin D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2608-2616Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, some D2 domains may have a catalytic function but possess a highly restricted or unusual substrate specificity. RPTPs that this could apply to include, for example, PTPα and LAR, the D2 domains of which have minimal substitutions in the 42 residues identified as conserved among all D1 domains and thus likely to be essential for catalysis (20Lim K.L. Ng C.H. Pallen C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1434: 275-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Both D2 domains assume the folding of their respective D1 domains, as predicted by PTPα-D2 modeling (11Lim K.L. Kolatkar P.R. Ng K.P. Ng C.H. Pallen C.J. J. Biol.

The D2 domain of PTPα clearly has intrinsic activity, which with some in vitro substrates can be as much as 10% of the D1 activity (8Wang Y Pallen C.J.

Substitution of two amino acids in PTP-D2 or LAR-D2 with Tyr and Asp that are conserved in these positions in all D1 domains confers a D1-equivalent catalytic competence, but the mutated D2s retain a distinct non-D1-like substrate specificity (11Lim K.L.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 914-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Crystal structure determination of PTP1B bound to substrate has shown that the aromatic ring of the conserved Tyr is involved in interactions with substrate phosphotyrosine and that the conserved general acid Asp is in close proximity to the bound phosphotyrosine (23Jia Z. Barford D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Science. 1995; 268: 1754-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). The equivalent residue in PTPα-D2 and LAR-D2 is hydrophobic but not aromatic, whereas Asp is replaced by the acidic residue Glu which is more distant from the substrate phosphate. Thus, essential catalytic amino acids are intact, and the D2 domain is folded correctly, but positioning and protonation of the conventional phosphotyrosine in the active site pocket is not optimal. Protein-protein interactions are key determinants of cell regulation and signal transduction events. Several such interactions have been described for PTPα and proposed to modulate its function. The extracellular region of PTPα associates in cis with the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked cell surface molecule contactin, possibly forming a receptor complex in which PTPα transduces a signal to activate the tyrosine kinase Fyn (24Zeng L. D'Alessandri L. Kalousek M.B. Vaughan L. Pallen C.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 707-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). A proposed dimerization of D1 involves the interaction of the N-terminal “wedge” region of one D1 domain with the active site of the partnering D1 domain, with consequent inhibition of catalytic activity (25Bilwes A.M. den Hertog J. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Nature. 1996; 382: 555-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). This wedge region can also interact in trans with the D2 domains of PTPα and other RPTPs, perhaps affecting PTPα dimer formation through the wedge-to-D1 interaction described above (26Blanchetot C. den Hertog J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12446-12452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). A phosphotyrosine located in the C-terminal tail region binds to Grb2-SH2 and Src-SH2. The former binding facilitates the subsequent binding of the Grb2-SH3 domain to a region in D1, which is proposed to inhibit D1 catalysis (27den Hertog J. Tracy S. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3020-3032Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 28Su J. Batzer A. Sap J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18731-18734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29den Hertog J.

Binding of the SH2 domain of Src to the same phosphotyrosine in the PTPα tail that can bind to Grb2 is hypothesized to facilitate PTPα-catalyzed dephosphorylation of the regulatory Tyr-527 residue in Src (31Zheng X.-M. Resnick R.J. Shalloway D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 964-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Other than PTPα homodimer formation, no protein interactions with PTPα-D2 have been reported. To search for such interacting proteins, the identification of which might illuminate D2 function, we have used radiolabeled PTPα-D2 to screen a cDNA expression library. The Ca2+-binding protein calmodulin was discovered to associate with PTPα-D2, and the binding site on D2 and the effect of calmodulin binding to D2 have been characterized. In addition, an in vivo association of calmodulin with the wild-type PTPα protein was observed. Numbering of the PTPα and PTPε amino acid sequences is according to Krueger et al. (32Krueger N.X. Streuli M. Saito H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3241-3252Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). The recombinant and mammalian expressed proteins used throughout this study are defined in Table I. The bacterial expression plasmids pGEX-KG containing PTPα-D1, PTPα-D2, PTPα-D1D2, and PTPε-D2 have been described (9Lim K.L. Lai D.S.Y. Kalousek M.B. Wang Y. Pallen C.J. Eur. J.

The plasmid pGEX-4T1-PTPα-D2C was constructed by insertion of a D2 fragment corresponding to aa 543–774 into pGEX-4T1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The plasmid pGEX-KG-PTPα-D2N (aa 486–542) was constructed by removing the D2C fragment from pGEX-KG-PTPα-D2. Nucleotides encoding PTPα-D2 (aa 486–774) were excised from pGEX-KG-PTPα-D2 and inserted into pGEX-2TK (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to create pGEX-2TK-PTPα-D2. The High Fidelity Taq DNA Polymerase kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used to amplify PTPα-N1 (aa 502–521), PTPα-N2 (aa 520–538), and PTPε-N2 (aa 422–440) using either pGEX-KG-PTPα-D2 or pGEX-KG-PTPε-D2 as the polymerase chain reaction template. The primer sequences were 5′-GGGGATCCAACAATGGATTAGAGGAG-3′ and 5′-GGCCGGGATCTTGTCATTCTGGAT-3′ for PTPα-N1, 5′-GGGGATCCGACAAGATGCGGACTGGA-3′ and 5′-GGGAATTCCTGTAAAACACGGTTCTT-3′ for PTPα-N2, and 5′-GGGGATCCGAGAACATGAGGACGGGC-3′ and 5′- GGGAATTCCTGGATGACCCTGGCCTT-3′ for PTPε-N2. These polymerase chain reaction fragments were then subcloned in-frame into pGEX-4T1-PTPα-D2C. All products from polymerase chain reactions were sequenced to ensure correct sequences.Table IRecombinant and mammalian expressed forms of PTPα and PTPɛ used in this studyNameAmino acid residuesPTPα1–774PTPα-D1D21–774, Δ167–485αD1D2167–774αD1167–485αD2486–774αD2-N486–542αD2-C543–774αN1-D2-C(502–521)–(543–774)αN2-D2-C(520–538)–(543–774)PTPɛ1–681ɛD2373–681ɛN2-αD2-Cɛ (422–440)–α(543–774)Numbering of the PTPα and PTPɛ amino acid sequences is according to Krueger et al.

(32Krueger N.X. Streuli M. Saito H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3241-3252Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Point mutations were introduced as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Mutations were introduced into the PTPα- and PTPε-D2 N2 fragments by polymerase chain reaction. The forward mutant primer sequences were 5′-GGGGATCCGAGAAGATGAGGACGGGC-3′ for ε-SM-N2 (N423K), 5′-GGGGATCCGACGAGATGCGGACTGGA-3′ for αN2 (K521E), 5′-GGGGATCCGACAACATGCGGACTGGA-3′ for αN2 (K521N), 5′-GGGAATTCCTGTAAAACACGCTTCTT-3′ for αN2 (N534K), and 5′-GGGAATTCCTGTAAAACACGGGCCTT-3′ for αN2 (N534A). For the PTPε double mutant (ε-DM-N2), the reverse mutant primer sequence was 5′-GGGAATTCCTGGATGACCCTGTTCTT-3′ (A436N). All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Mutant N2 fragments were then subcloned in-frame into pGEX-4T1-PTPα-D2C. Bacterially expressed GST-PTP fusion proteins were bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and purified either by elution with reduced glutathione (Sigma) or by cleavage with thrombin (Sigma). Purified PTPs were quantitated by Bradford or BCA analysis (Pierce) and visualized by SDS-PAGE. For radioactive labeling, pGEX-2TK-PTPα-D2 was expressed in Escherichia coli DH5αF′ and bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Bovine heart muscle kinase (Sigma) and [γ-32P]ATP (3000 mCi/mmol, NEN Life Science Products) were added and incubated with the beads at 4 °C for 30 min as described (34Pause A. Belsham G.J. Gingras A.C. Donze O. Lin T.A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1994; 371: 762-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). To remove unreacted [γ-32P]ATP, the beads were washed extensively with phosphate-buffered saline until no signal could be detected in the wash. The 32P-labeled PTPα-D2 polypeptide was then isolated following thrombin cleavage and the specific activity determined. A small portion of the sample was applied to SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography as a single band of the expected size. 2 × 106 clones from a human cerebellum cDNA expression library constructed in λZAP (a gift from T. Leung) were plated at 42 °C for 4 h and then overlaid with 10 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside-saturated nitrocellulose membranes (NEN Life Science Products) at 37 °C for another 8 h. Cells grown on the membranes were processed through a series of steps of denaturation and renaturation as described (34Pause A. Belsham G.J. Gingras A.C. Donze O. Lin T.A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1994; 371: 762-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar).32P-Labeled PTPα-D2 (106 cpm/ml) was added and incubated with the membranes in Hyb buffer (20 mmHepes-KOH, pH 7.7, 75 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 50–100 μm CaCl2, 1% non-fat dry milk) for 12 h. All procedures after the cell lysis step were performed at 4 °C. The membranes were washed three times in Hyb buffer, dried briefly, and exposed for autoradiography. Sixteen clones showing a positive signal were picked up and plated for the secondary screen. Fifteen of these had over 20% positive clones in 100-mm Petri dishes and were kept as putative PTPα-D2-binding molecules for further analysis. A BIAcore 2000 instrument (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used. Bovine brain calmodulin (a gift from M. Z. Zhang) was covalently linked to a sensor chip CM5 (BIAcore), and unreactive groups on the chip were inactivated by ethanolamine according to the manufacturer's instructions. Recombinant protein in running buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.7, 150 mm NaCl, 0.005% Tween 20, 1 mm CaCl2, or EGTA) was injected over the surface using the KINJECT command at a flow rate of 15 μl/min and a total volume of 240 μl. A 20-min dissociation period was provided, and the surface was regenerated by injection of 10 μl of 0.05% SDS. Cycles of injection and regeneration followed by running buffer flow were computer programmed for the binding comparison of different samples. BIA evaluation 3.0 software (BIAcore) was used to analyze data. The KD value was calculated according to a 1:1 interaction model by direct fitting of ligand binding at multiple concentrations around the KD . COS-1 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). NIH3T3 cells were a gift from P. Lobie. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and penicillin/streptomycin in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Transient transfections were performed at 50–70% cell confluency (100-mm dishes) using 5 μg of plasmid DNA and liposome-mediated transfection with LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described by the manufacturer. Cells were harvested 24–36 h after transfection. Transfection with the empty expression plasmid pJX41-neo was used as a control. Monoclonal antibodies toward VSVG (Sigma), FLAG (Sigma), and calmodulin (Upstate Biotechnology) were used for immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. Transfected NIH3T3 cells were lysed in buffer A (20 mmTris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Brij-96, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and the lysates were clarified by centrifugation. For immunoprecipitation, cell lysates were incubated with antibodies at 4 °C for 12 h. Protein G plus/protein A-agarose suspension (Calbiochem) was then added for another 3 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed five times in buffer B (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm CaCl2), resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and immunoblotted using the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Lysates of COS-1 cells expressing VSVG-PTPα, VSVG-PTPα-D2ΔD1, or FLAG-PTPε were incubated with 50 μl of calmodulin-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in the presence of 1 mm of CaCl2 or EGTA at 4 °C for 3 h. The beads were washed three times in buffer C (20 mmTris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) containing 1 mmCaCl2 or EGTA and eluted with 50 μl of buffer D (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mmEGTA). The eluates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-VSVG or anti-FLAG antibody. Phosphatase assays toward pNPP were performed at 30 °C in 450-μl reactions containing 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and with 1 mm CaCl2 or EGTA added as indicated in the figure legends. Some reactions contained bovine brain or recombinant calmodulin, and similar results were obtained with either form. The N2 peptide used in the competition experiments was synthesized commercially with an automated peptide synthesizer (BTC, NUS, Singapore) to >95% purity and added at the indicated concentrations. The apparent Km and Vmax of PTPα-D2 in the absence or presence of calmodulin was manually extrapolated from Lineweaver-Burk inverse plots of PTPα-D2 activity toward pNPP concentrations ranging from 1.25 to 10 mm. For Ki determination, the linear regression of the Km (app)/Vmaxvalues (the slopes in the inverse plot) were plotted against inhibitor concentration. The intersection of the linear regression with the x axis gives the negative Ki value. All reactions were carried out at 30 °C and terminated during the linear portion of the reaction. Released p-nitrophenol was quantitated as described previously (8Wang Y Pallen C.J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3231-3237Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Recombinant 32P-labeled PTPα-D2 was used to screen a human cerebellum cDNA expression library. Fifteen positive clones were identified after the secondary screen, and two of these encoded calmodulin. The recombinant and mammalian expressed proteins used throughout this study are defined in Table I. The interaction of PTPα-D2 and calmodulin was confirmed using surface plasmon resonance. PTPα-D2 bound in a Ca2+-dependent manner to bovine brain calmodulin coated on the sensor chip, with no binding observed in the presence of EGTA (Fig.1 A). In comparison, a greatly reduced but Ca2+-dependent binding occurred between calmodulin and PTPα-D1 (Fig. 1 B) or PTPα-D1D2 (Fig. 1 C). Increasing concentrations of PTPα-D2 resulted in increased binding (RU) to the calmodulin-coated sensor chip. The kinetics of interaction were fitted to a single interaction site model, and yielded a dissociation constant (KD) of 2.86 × 10−9m ± 0.31, suggestive of a specific and high affinity interaction. To define the calmodulin-binding site within PTPα-D2, two constructs were generated that expressed an N-terminal portion of D2 (D2-N, aa 486–542) or the remaining C-terminal portion of D2 with the tail region (D2-C, aa 543–774) (Fig.2 A). These regions of PTPα were expressed in bacteria as GST fusion proteins, affinity purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads, and either eluted from the beads (GST-D2-N) or cleaved from the GST with thrombin (D2-C) to give soluble purified polypeptides. Their interaction with a calmodulin-coated sensor chip was analyzed by surface plasmon resonance. The D2-C polypeptide showed little or no interaction with calmodulin, as was found with a control preparation of purified GST protein (Fig. 2,B and C). However, the GST-D2-N polypeptide bound to the immobilized calmodulin with very similar kinetics to the complete D2 polypeptide (Fig. 2 B). The irregularities in the D2-N binding curve may be due to the presence of degraded forms of the fusion protein that were detected by SDS-PAGE. The purified GST-D2-N fusion protein was also difficult to produce in any significant quantity. Nevertheless, these results indicate that the calmodulin-binding site resides within the N-terminal amino acids 486–542 of PTPα-D2. Analysis of the amino acid sequence in D2-N for candidate calmodulin-binding sites identified two overlapping subregions, N1 (aa 502–521) and N2 (aa 520–538) (Fig. 2 A), with positive charge distributions and the potential abilities to form an amphipathic helix, a favored structure for calmodulin binding (35Cox J.A. Comte M. Fitton J.E. DeGrado W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2527-2534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Engineered forms of the D2-C polypeptide with either N1 or N2 at the amino terminus were produced and tested for calmodulin binding. The N1 region conferred weak calmodulin binding upon the polypeptide. The presence of the N2 region conferred much stronger calmodulin binding ability to the polypeptide, and this was equivalent to the interaction with calmodulin observed with the complete D2 protein (Fig. 2 D). Thus the 19-amino acid sequence of N2 contains the calmodulin-binding site of PTPα-D2. PTPα shares considerable amino acid sequence homology with its closest relative, PTPε (32Krueger N.X. Streuli M. Saito H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3241-3252Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). The D2 domains of these PTPs have 72% amino acid identity, yet PTPε-D2 exhibited a relatively weak interaction with calmodulin (Fig.3, A and B). Following the identification of the N2 subregion of PTPα-D2 as the calmodulin-binding site, the corresponding N2 sequence in PTPε (aa 422–440) was examined. The 19-amino acid N2 regions were identical with the exceptions of two conservative substitutions (Asp-520 and Leu-537 in PTPα to Glu-422 and Ile-439, respectively, in PTPε) and two non-conservative replacements (Lys-521 and Asn-534 in PTPα to Asn-423 and Ala-436, respectively, in PTPε). This suggested that these amino acid differences, in particular the non-conserved residues, could be the basis for the differential interactions of PTPα-D2 and PTPε-D2 with calmodulin. Indeed, mutations of the positively charged Lys-521 of PTPα to either a negatively charged glutamic acid (K521E) or to the neutral Asn (K521N) present in this position in PTPε resulted in a greatly reduced binding to calmodulin (Fig.3 C). Mutation of neutral Asn-534 of PTPα to a positively charged lysine residue (N534K) or to the hydrophobic alanine residue (N534A) found in this position in PTPε also significantly reduced the strength of the interaction with calmodulin, although to a lesser extent than did the mutation of Lys-521 (Fig. 3 C). This indicates that both Lys-521 and Asn-534 of PTPα play a role in the interaction of PTPα-D2 with calmodulin and that substitution of either is sufficient to disrupt binding. Consistent with these results, a single point mutation in position 423 (N423K) of the PTPε N2 sequence (which restored the lysine residue found in this position in PTPα N2) was unable to restore calmodulin binding to a (PTPε-N2)-(PTPα-D2C) fusion protein. However, two simultaneous mutations of the non-conserved residues 423 and 436 of PTPε (N423K/A436N) that restored the amino acids correspondingly found in PTPα increased calmodulin binding by about 2-fold (Fig.3 D). Since the double mutation in PTPε N2 did not restore binding to a level comparable to that observed with PTPα N2, this indicates that both the conservative and the non-conservative amino acid differences between the PTPα and PTPε N2 subregions contribute to the distinct calmodulin binding properties of PTPα-D2 and PTPε-D2. The phosphatase activity of PTPα-D2 was assayed toward two defined D2 substrates,pNPP, and the RR-Src peptide, with and without calmodulin. Although calmodulin alone or in the presence of added EGTA had no effect on PTPα-D2 activity, calmodulin in the presence of added Ca2+ inhibited D2 activity toward pNPP (Fig. 4 A) and RR-Src (data not shown). However, neither PTPα-D1 nor PTPα-D1D2 activity was affected by calmodulin in the presence of Ca2+ or EGTA (Fig. 4, B and C), consistent with the inability of these recombinant forms of PT"
