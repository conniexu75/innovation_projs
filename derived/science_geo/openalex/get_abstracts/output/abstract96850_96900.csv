https://openalex.org/W1518136555,"The pH dependence of the binding of warfarin to human serum albumin has been studies by circular dichroism, fluorescence, and equilibrium dialysis. The pH dependences of the induced ellipticity and the fluorescent intensity of the warfarin . albumin complexes at low drug to protein ratios parallel the neutral to base transition, occurring in the protein over the pH range 6 to 9. Dialysis data show albumin to have a single high affinity site for warfarin over this pH range. This affinity is higher for the basic than for the neutral conformation. Calcium ions increase the high affinity constant of warfarin for albumin over the same pH region, by affecting the neutral to base transition. On the other hand, chloride ions reduce the induced ellipticity and the fluorescent intensity of the complexes at all pH investigated, the mechanism being primarily that of displacement of the drug from albumin."

https://openalex.org/W1599093857,"The biosynthetic pathway for the cyanogenic glucoside, dhurrin, involves the following intermediates: L-tyrosine, N-hydroxytyrosine, p-hydroxyphenylacetaldoxime, p-hydroxyphenylacetonitrile, and p-hydroxymandelonitrile. N-Hydroxytyrosine and p-hydroxy-phenylacetonitrile produced from L-tyrosine by microsomes from seedlings of Sorghum bicolor are utilized more effectively as substrates than exogenously added N-hydroxytyrosine and p-hydroxyphenylacetonitrile. The minimum values for the channeling ratios are 25 for N-hydroxytyrosine and 115 for p-hydroxyphenylacetonitrile. On the other hand, p-hydroxyphenylacetaldoxime produced internally exchanges readily with exogenously added p-hydroxyphenylacetaldoxime. These results indicate that the biosynthetic pathway is catalyzed by two mutienzyme complexes or by two multifunctional proteins and explain why the rate of the overall sequential reaction starting from L-tyrosine is greater than the rates of reaction initiated later in the sequence with the known intermediates N-hydroxytyrosine and p-hydroxyphenylacetonitrile. Attempts to cross-link chemically the last enzyme in the pathway, a soluble UDP-glucose glucosyl-transferase, to the microsomal system were unsuccesful."

https://openalex.org/W1598255749,"Besides carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase-catalyzed exchange diffusions, a relatively much slower unidirectional transport of carnitines also proceeds in mitochondria. The latter proceeds in the direction of the concentration gradient of carnitines and leads to the equilibration of carnitine concentration across the inner membrane. The same translocase that catalyzes exchange diffusion appears to catalyze unidirectional transport inasmuch as the two processes showed similar substrate specificity, sensitivity to inhibitors, high temperature coefficients, apparent affinity for carnitine, and a lack of energy requirement. The unidirectionally imported carnitine readily exchanged against medium carnitine, indicating that the two transport processes share the same pool of mitochondrial carnitine. Unidirectional transport appears to be functional in vivo; its operation seems not only to allow mitochondria to acquire carnitine but to adjust the rates of their faster exchange-diffusion reactions with changes in total tissue carnitine concentrations. The carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase was found to be about 15 times as active in mitochondria of rat liver as in those of heart."

https://openalex.org/W1518331340,The hepatic uptake of high density lipoprotein cholesteryl ester was determine in a nonrecycling isolated rat liver perfusion. High density lipoprotein rich in the E apoprotein (apoE) showed about 10 times more uptake of the ester on a single pass than the bulk of the high density lipoproteins rich in the A-I protein. The apoportein recoveries in the liver paralleled the ester for both lipoproteins. The uptake appeared to occur primarily in the hepatic parenchymal cell. Addition of human C-III-1 apoprotein to the rat apoE-rich high density lipoprotein inhibited the hepatic uptake of its constituents.

https://openalex.org/W1522939853,"Abstract GTP:mRNA guanylyltransferase, an enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of a GMP residue from GTP to the 5' end of RNA to form a cap structure identified as G(5')pppN-, has been isolated from HeLa cell nuclei. The enzyme has been purified approximately 1000-fold and separated by column chromatography (using DEAE-cellulose, phosphocellulose, Cibacron blue-agarose, and GTP-agarose) from a variety of other activities, including RNA triphosphatase and mRNA (guanine-7)methyltransferase. The reaction product was identified by its resistance to Penicillium nuclease and alkaline phosphatase, sensitivity to venom phosphodiesterase, and electrophoretic and chromatographic mobilities relative to authentic standards. Optimal enzyme activity was obtained at pH 7.5 in the presence of Mn2+ or Mg2+, GTP, and an appropriate acceptor polyribonucleotide. The enzyme was inhibited by elevated concentrations of salt and by sulfhydryl-binding reagents but was unaffected by S-adenosylmethionine or S-adenosylhomocysteine. A molecular weight of 48,500 was estimated by sucrose gradient centrifugation of purified enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1604758102,"In order to examine the subunit structure of membrane-associated spectrin, human erythrocyte membranes were cross-linked with a variety of photosensitive heterobifunctional reagents by flash photolysis millisecond cross-linking (Kiehm, D.J., and Ji, T.H. (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252, 8524-8531). Cross-linking of ghosts produced a series of new bands with apparent molecular weights of approximately 420,000, 710,000, and 910,000, as well as a band at the top of the gels. Evidence is presented that these three bands represent spectrin dimer, trimer, and tetramer, respectively. We propose that spectrin tetramer exists on the membrane as the predominant structural unit and that dimer is not a repeating structural unit."

At the same time, government regulations on the safety of new drugs have increased. But Fred Steward and George Wibberley argue that there is not a simple relationship between these two trends"

https://openalex.org/W1525115495,"A serine-threonine-rich galactoglycoprotein was isolated in homogeneous form from pooled normal human plasma. After precipitation of the major portion of the plasma proteins by Cohn's low temperature-low salt-ethanol procedure, the proteins and glycoproteins remaining in the supernatant solution of Cohn Fraction V were concentrated with the aid of DEAE-cellulose. Fractional elution from this ion exchange resin yielded a crude preparation of the galactoglycoprotein which was purified subsequently by gel filtration through Sephadex G-100. Homogeneity of the protein was established by several criteria of purity including disc polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and COOH-terminal amino acid analysis. The major physicochemical constants of the macromolecule including its molecular weight of 81,000 were measured. The chemical composition of this protein was found to be unusual: the total carbohydrate moiety accounts for 76% of its weight and consists of 23% sialic acid, 23% total neutral sugar, including 20% galactose, 1% fucose, and almost equal amounts of GalNAc and GlcNAc totalling 27%. The polypeptide moiety accounting for 26% of the weight of the glycoprotein distinguishes itself by a high content of serine and threonine."

https://openalex.org/W1539488073,"Abstract Iodoacetate reacts rapidly with one sulfhydryl group/subunit on aposerine transhydroxymethylase. The carboxymethylated apoenzyme does not recombine with pyridoxal 5'-phosphate. Under conditions used in the apoenzyme studies, the holoenzyme does not react to an appreciable extent with iodoacetate. The reaction of the apoenzyme with iodoacetate shows pseudo-first order kinetics with a half-life of about 3 min at 0 degrees C and pH 7.0. A pattern of saturation kinetics was found when increasing concentrations of iodoacetate were used. The half-maximum rate of inactivation occurred at 1.5 mM iodoacetate. Phosphate was observed to inhibit competitively the inactivation by iodoacetate with a Ki value of 1.8 mM. No inactivation of aposerine transhydroxymethylase was found when iodoacetamide was used in place of iodoacetate. These experiments suggest that removal of the pyridoxal 5'-phosphate from serine transhydroxymethylase exposes a reactive sulfhydryl group with a nearby cationic center which binds the carboxyl group of iodoacetate. The reactive sulfhydryl group was labeled with [14C]iodoacetate. From a chymotryptic digest, a 14C-containing peptide was isolated and determined to be: His-Pro-Lys-Leu-Ile-Ile-Ala-Gly-Thr-Ser-Cys(Cm)-Tyr."

https://openalex.org/W1573266064,"Newly synthesized microsomal membrane phospholipids of actively secreting myeloma cells all appear to decay rapidly, with initial half-lives of less than 1 h. Their rates of decay are similar to each other and to the rates observed earlier for the decay of the protein components of the membrane and also for the intracellular turnover of immunoglobulin light chain, the predominant secretory product of these cells. This evidence, which suggests that many different components of the membrane and, therefore, presumably the membrane itself turn over rapidly, provides support for the hypothesis that unidirectional membrane flow, accompanied by rapid synthesis of the membranes at the origin of flow and their rapid degradation at or near the terminus of flow, is the mechanism of intracellular transport of secretory product by the myeloma cell. An attractive feature of this mechanism is that rapid synthesis and degradation of the membranes could provide the driving force for membrane flow."

https://openalex.org/W1543848232,"A graph is presented which permits facile determination of the dissociation constant constant for a macromolecule . ligand complex from gel filtration results; it can be used without a detailed understanding of the remainder of the text. When a solution of macromolecules and radioactive ligand is subjected to gel filtrations, the amount of ligand associated with the eluted macromolecule is easily measured. This quantity is then used for obtaining the corresponding dissociation constant from the graph. Values given in the graph had been determined from an equation, which is presented in the text, by means of a program which is run on a programmable calculator (Texas Instruments SR-52). It is also demonstrated how the validity of dissociation constants so obtained can be checked independently by means of a second calculation. A modification of these procedures permits determination of the dissociation constant for those situations where there is moderate dilution of the eluted sample relative to that applied to the gel filtration column, and the graph incorporates results from such calculations. The successful application of the present approach to the determination of the dissociation constants for a tubulin . [3H]GDP complex is described. Also, the potential importance of the present approach relative to other techniques for dissociation constant determination is discussed."
