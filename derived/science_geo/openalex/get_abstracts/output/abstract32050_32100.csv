https://openalex.org/W2074351361,"Transcription of the lymphocyte-specific terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase gene begins at a single nucleotide, but no TATA box is present. We have identified a 17 bp element that is sufficient for accurate basal transcription of this gene both in vitro and in vivo. This motif, the initiator (Inr), contains within itself the transcription start site. Homology to the Inr is found in many TATA-containing genes, and specific mutagenesis influences both the efficiency and accuracy of initiation. Moreover, in the presence of either a TATA box or the SV40 21 bp repeats, a greatly increased level of transcription initiates specifically at the Inr. Thus, the Inr constitutes the simplest functional promoter that has been identified and provides one explanation for how promoters that lack TATA elements direct transcription initiation."
https://openalex.org/W1975642651,"A phosphatidylinositol (PI) kinase activity associated with certain protein tyrosine kinases important in cell proliferation phosphorylates the 3' hydroxyl position of PI to produce phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PI-3-P). Here we report that, in addition to PI-3' kinase activity, anti-phosphotyrosine (alpha-P-tyr) immunoprecipitates from platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-stimulated smooth muscle cells (SMC) contain lipid kinase activities that utilize the substrates phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI-4-P) and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI-4,5-P2). These activities are absent in alpha-P-tyr immunoprecipitates from quiescent SMC. The product of PI-4-P phosphorylation appears to be phosphatidylinositol-3,4-bisphosphate (PI-3,4-P2), a lipid not previously reported. The product of PI-4,5-P2 phosphorylation is phosphatidylinositol-trisphosphate (PIP3). PI-3-P was detected in quiescent SMC and increased only slightly in response to PDGF. PIP3 and the putative PI-3,4-P2 appeared only after the addition of mitogen. Both the temporal production of these novel phospholipids after PDGF stimulation and the observation of the enzymatic activities that produce them in alpha-P-tyr immunoprecipitates suggest that these phospholipids are excellent candidates for mediators of the PDGF mitogenic response."
https://openalex.org/W2004273103,"GMP-140 is an integral membrane glycoprotein found in secretory granules of platelets and endothelial cells. After cellular activation, it is rapidly redistributed to the plasma membrane. The cDNA-derived primary structure of GMP-140 predicts a cysteine-rich protein with multiple domains, including a ""lectin"" region, an ""EGF"" domain, nine tandem consensus repeats related to those in complement-binding proteins, a transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic tail. Some cDNAs also predict a soluble protein with a deleted transmembrane segment. The domain organization of GMP-140 is similar to that of ELAM-1, a cytokine-inducible endothelial cell receptor that binds neutrophils. This similarity suggests that GMP-140 belongs to a new family of inducible receptors with related structure and function on vascular cells."

https://openalex.org/W2040544223,"Monoclonal antibodies in the Hermes family recognize a lymphocyte structure that participates in lymphocyte adhesion to endothelium and has been suggested to be the human homolog of the murine Mel-14 lymph node homing receptor. Recently, antibodies against the Hermes antigen, the polymorphic glycoprotein Pgp-1 antigen, and the broadly expressed CDw44 antigen have been shown to recognize the same structure. In this work, cDNA clones encoding the CDw44 antigen were isolated and expressed in COS cells. Two forms were identified: a lymphoid form expressed in hematopoietic cells, and an epithelial form weakly expressed in normal epithelium but highly expressed in carcinomas. The extracellular domain of CDw44 bears homology to cartilage link proteins and a related segment of proteoglycan core protein. However, comparison with the recently identified sequence of the Mel-14 antigen shows that CDw44 and Mel-14 are unrelated."
https://openalex.org/W2078819000,"We have defined the RNA binding domain of the 70K protein component of the U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein to a region of 111 amino acids. This domain encompasses an octamer sequence that has been observed in other proteins associated with RNA, but has not previously been shown to bind directly to a specific RNA sequence. Within the U1 RNA binding domain, an 80 amino acid consensus sequence that is conserved in many presumed RNA binding proteins was discerned. This sequence pattern appears to represent an RNA recognition motif (RRM) characteristic of a distinct family of proteins. By site-directed mutagenesis, we determined that the 70K protein consists of 437 amino acids (52 kd), and found that its aberrant electrophoretic migration is due to a carboxy-terminal charged domain structurally similar to two Drosophila proteins (su(wa) and tra) that may regulate alternative pre-messenger RNA splicing."
https://openalex.org/W1996787107,"Lymphocyte interactions with high endothelial venules (HEV) during extravasation into lymphoid tissues involve an 85-95 kd class of lymphocyte surface glycoprotein(s), gp90Hermes (CD44). We report here the cloning of cDNA for gp90Hermes expressed in a mucosal HEV-binding B lymphoblastoid cell line, KCA. Northern hybridization revealed the presence of three invariant RNA bands at 1.5, 2.2, and 4.5 kb in mucosal HEV-, lymph node HEV-, or dual-binding cells. The deduced amino acid sequence predicts a mature protein with a C-terminal cytoplasmic tail, a hydrophobic transmembrane domain of 23 amino acids, and an N-terminal extracellular region of 248 amino acids. A proximal extracellular domain is the probable region of O-glycosylation and chondroitin sulfate linkage and displays at least two of the three immunodominant epitope clusters of native gp90Hermes. A distal region contains the majority of potential N-glycosylation sites and cysteines, and exhibits a striking homology to tandemly repeated domains of the cartilage link and proteoglycan core proteins. No significant similarities were found to the immunoglobulin, integrin, or cadherin gene families. Thus gp90Hermes represents a novel class of integral membrane protein involved in lymphocyte-endothelial cell interactions and lymphocyte homing."

Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor, type 1 (PAI-1) secretion by cultured human endothelial cells were not affected by exposure to venous shear stress (4 dynes/cm2). However, at arterial shear stresses of 15 and 25 dynes/cm2, the tPA secretion rate was 2.1 and 3.0 times greater, respectively, than the basal tPA secretion rate. PAI-1 secretion was unaffected by shear stress over the entire physiological range."
https://openalex.org/W1496473441,"The nature of non-transferrin-bound iron in the plasma or serum of iron-overloaded hemochromatosis patients was studied by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and high resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). 500-MHz proton Hahn spin-echo NMR spectra of plasma or serum, combined with the use of the iron chelator desferrioxamine, suggests complexation of iron ions with citrate and a possible involvement of acetate. Addition of FeCl3 to hemochromatosis samples broadened the NMR signals from citrate. HPLC analysis rigorously confirmed the presence of an iron-citrate complex in ultrafiltrates of plasma or serum studies with added FeCl3 or desferrioxamine supported this conclusion. It is proposed that non-transferrin-bound iron in the plasma of iron-overloaded patients exists largely as complexes with citrate and possibly also as ternary iron-citrate-acetate complexes. The presence of such complexes would account for the ability of non-transferrin-bound iron to be measurable by the bleomycin assay and for its rapid clearance from the circulation by the liver."
https://openalex.org/W1976432358,"Carcinoma cells express a novel integrin involved in cell adhesion to vitronectin, but not to fibrinogen or von Willebrand factor, whereas melanoma and endothelial cells express a vitronectin receptor (alpha v beta 3) that promotes cell attachment to all of these matrix components. The integrin responsible for this adhesive phenotype of carcinoma cells is composed of an alpha subunit that is indistinguishable from the alpha v of the vitronectin receptor and a beta subunit (beta x) that is distinct from any known integrin beta subunit. Accordingly, Northern blot analysis identifies an mRNA for alpha v, but not for beta 3 in carcinoma cells. This receptor appears to mediate cell adhesion to vitronectin as well as fibronectin since an antibody directed to its alpha subunit blocked carcinoma cell adhesion to both of these matrix proteins. These results suggest that homologous integrins with identical alpha subunits and structurally distinct beta subunits can account for the functional recognition of different matrixes by two cell types."
https://openalex.org/W2126154316,"RNAs coding for connexins 32, 43, and the putative lens gap junction protein MP26 were tested for their ability to induce cell-cell coupling in Xenopus oocyte pairs. Large, voltage-insensitive conductances developed when connexin32 and 43 RNA-injected oocytes were paired both with themselves and with each other. Oocyte pairs injected with water manifested small conductances, which were symmetrically voltage-dependent. MP26 RNA-injected pairs displayed no conductances above control values. Unexpectedly, connexin43/water oocyte pairs developed high, asymmetrically voltage-dependent conductances, a property not displayed by the connexin32/water pairs. In single oocytes, these proteins remained intracellular until pairing, at which time the connexins, but not MP26, concentrated at the appositional areas."
https://openalex.org/W2059917880,"Infections with the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum are characterized by sequestration of erythrocytes infected with mature forms of the parasite. Sequestration of infected erythrocytes appears to be critical for survival of the parasite and to mediate immunopathological abnormalities in severe malaria. A leukocyte differentiation antigen (CD36) was previously suggested to have a role in sequestration of malaria-infected erythrocytes. CD36 was purified from platelets, where it is known as GPIV, and was shown to be a receptor for binding of infected erythrocytes. Infected erythrocytes adhered to CD36 immobilized on plastic; purified CD36 exhibited saturable, specific binding to infected erythrocytes; and purified CD36 or antibodies to CD36 inhibited and reversed binding of infected erythrocytes to cultured endothelial cells and melanoma cells in vitro. The portion of the CD36 molecule that reverses cytoadherence may be useful therapeutically for rapid reversal of sequestration in cerebral malaria."

https://openalex.org/W2090436854,"Many diseases are dominated by persistent growth of capillary blood vessels. Tumor growth is also angiogenesis-dependent. Safe and effective angiogenesis inhibitors are needed to determine whether control of angiogenesis would be therapeutic. Heparin and certain steroids, administered together, can inhibit angiogenesis in a synergistic manner. This ""pair"" effect suggested that specific hydrophilic cycloamyloses may be suitable heparin substitutes. β-Cyclodextrin tetradecasulfate administered with a steroid inhibits angiogenesis at 100 to 1000 times the effectiveness of heparin in the chick embryo bioassay. This cyclic oligosaccharide also augments the anti-angiogenic effect of angiostatic steroids against corneal neovascularization in rabbits when β-cyclodextrin tetradecasulfate and a steroid are inserted into the cornea or applied topically as eyedrops."
https://openalex.org/W1982802162,Bacterial flagella are potent immunogens and aromatic-dependent (aro) Salmonella as live vaccines evoke humoral and cellular immune responses. Such strains expressing epitopes of protective antigens as inserts in flagellin would provide a novel way to vaccinate against diseases caused by unrelated pathogens. A synthetic oligonucleotide specifying an epitope of cholera toxin subunit B was inserted in a Salmonella flagellin gene. The chimeric flagellin functioned normally and the epitope was expressed at the flagellar surface. Parenteral administration to mice of an aro A flagellin-negative strain of S. dublin expressing the chimeric flagellin gene evoked antibody to cholera toxin.
https://openalex.org/W2045171292,"Glutamate activates a number of different receptor-channel complexes, each of which may contribute to generation of excitatory postsynaptic potentials in the mammalian central nervous system. The rapid application of the selective glutamate agonist, quisqualate, activates a large rapidly inactivating current (3 to 8 milliseconds), which is mediated by a neuronal ionic channel with high unitary conductance (35 picosiemens). The current through this channel shows pharmacologic characteristics similar to those observed for the fast excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC); it reverses near 0 millivolts and shows no significant voltage dependence. The amplitude of the current through this channel is many times larger than that through the other non-NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) channels. These results suggest that this high-conductance quisqualate-activated channel may mediate the fast EPSC in the mammalian central nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W1508223815,"Human myelin basic protein was fractionated into its various charge isomers by CM52 cation exchange chromatography. Approximately 25-30% of the total charge applied to the column appeared in the void volume. This material termed C-8, was further purified by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography. Amino acid analyses of C-8 revealed low Arg (7 residue % in C-8 compared to 11-12 residue % in C-1) and increased Glx residues. The low Arg was accounted for by a corresponding amount of citrulline. Sequence analysis after chemical fragmentation (cyanogen bromide and BNPS-skatole) and enzymatic (cathepsin D and carboxypeptidase S-1) digestion localized the citrulline at residues 25, 31, 122, 130, 159, and 170 of the amino acid sequence. The effect of this loss of positive charge on the ability of the protein to aggregate lipid vesicles was demonstrated with vesicles composed of phosphatidylcholine (92.2 mol %) and phosphatidylserine (7.8 mol %). C-1 was the most effective charge isomer, and C-8 was the least effective. The ability of these charge isomers to aggregate vesicles correlated with the net positive charge on each. Vesicles composed of phosphatidylcholine alone were not aggregated by lipophilin or any of the charge isomers. However, when lipophilin was incorporated into phosphatidylcholine vesicles (50% w/w), small, optically clear suspensions of vesicles were formed. None of C-1, C-2, or C-3 aggregated these vesicles, but C-8 produced rapid vesicle aggregation. Since the substitution of citrulline for Arg would generate several relatively long apolar sequences, these would enhance the ability of C-8 to interact with the hydrophobic lipophilin molecule, promoting vesicle aggregation by hydrophobic interactions. The mechanism by which citrulline is generated in myelin is not known, although enzymatic conversion has been described in other systems. Studies are underway to elucidate the mechanism by which this post-translational modification is generated."
https://openalex.org/W1533085584,"Abstract The Ku (p70/p80) autoantigen consists of two phosphoproteins of molecular mass approximately 70,000 and 80,000 forming a macromolecular complex that binds DNA. Autoantibodies from a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus were used to isolate cDNA clones encoding the human approximately 70-kDa Ku antigen (p70) from a lambda gt11 expression library. The deduced amino acid sequence of p70 consisted of 609 amino acid residues and was confirmed by partial amino acid sequencing. The protein contains two acidic domains of 61 residues (31% Glu + Asp) and 19 residues (53% Glu + Asp) that are similar in size and charge to those found in a number of proteins involved in transcriptional activation. The 61-residue acidic region is rich in serine, raising the possibility that its charge might be modulated by phosphorylation. The predicted amino acid sequence also contains two regions with periodic repeats of either alone, or alternating with serine every seventh position. The latter repeat displays sequence and secondary structural similarities with the leucine zipper regions of the c-myc and v-myc oncogene products. The p70 antigen does not appear to have extensive sequence homology with the 80-kDa Ku autoantigen based on analysis of RNA blots and immunological criteria. A major antigenic determinant or determinants recognized by human autoantibodies is located near a repeat on the carboxyl-terminal 190 amino acid residues of p70."
https://openalex.org/W1531765010,"Abstract Immobilized vitronectin was found to bind both purified plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) and the PAI-1 in conditioned culture medium of human sarcoma cells. Similarly, immobilized PAI-1 bound both purified vitronectin and vitronectin from normal human serum. These interactions were demonstrated using both enzyme immunoassay and radioiodinated proteins. Solid-phase vitronectin bound PAI-1 with Kd 1.9 x 10(-7) M, and the reverse interaction gave a Kd 5.5 x 10(-8) M. Evidence was also found for a second type of binding with a Kd below 10(-10) M. The molar ratios of the two proteins in the complex at the saturation levels were approximately one molecule of soluble PAI-1 bound per three molecules of immobilized vitronectin and approximately one molecule of soluble vitronectin being bound per one molecule of immobilized PAI-1. Binding of PAI-1 to vitronectin did not lead to an irreversible loss of the ability of PAI-1 to inhibit urokinase (u-PA) and tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA). Active u-PA released vitronectin-bound 125I-labeled PAI-1 radioactivity, suggesting that u-PA interacts with the complex. The Mr 50,000 urokinase cleavage product of PAI-1 also bound to vitronectin, but this bound fragment did not inhibit u-PA. Binding of PAI-1 to vitronectin did not interfere with the ability of vitronectin to promote the adhesion and spreading of cells. These results suggest that the interaction between vitronectin and PAI-1 may serve to confine pericellular u-PA activity to focal contact sites where cells use proteolysis in regional detachment."
https://openalex.org/W1615827574,"Treatment of normal human plasma with methylamine resulted in the discovery of an interleukin-1 beta(IL-1 beta) binding protein. The protein was labeled with 125I-IL-1 beta and the relative molecular mass (Mr) determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The protein-IL-1 beta complex had a Mr of approximately 400,000 in non-reducing sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis but became dissociated when exposed to beta-mercaptoethanol. The 125I-IL-1 beta labeled protein complex could be immunoprecipitated from plasma by using an anti-alpha 2-macroglobulin (alpha 2M) antiserum. Similarly, a monoclonal antibody (mAb) specific for electrophoretically fast (F)alpha 2M was able to adsorb the 125I-IL-1 beta labeled complex from plasma. The mAb was also capable of adsorbing F alpha 2M-125I-IL-1 beta complexes from binary reaction mixtures, but failed to adsorb free 125I-IL-1 beta. Experiments carried out with purified plasma alpha 2M established that IL-1 beta became bound to alpha 2M only upon reaction with trypsin or methylamine, which results in the appearance of free thiol groups in alpha 2M (F alpha 2M). There was no binding of IL-1 beta to the native form of alpha 2M (electrophoretically slow or S alpha 2M), which lacks free thiol groups. Pretreatment of F alpha 2M with N-ethylmaleimide or [ethylenebis(oxyethylenenitrilo)] tetraacetic acid prevented complex formation between F alpha 2M and IL-1 beta. In contrast, the yield of F alpha 2M IL-1 beta complex formation was increased severalfold in the presence of 2.5 mM Zn2+. These findings indicate that F alpha 2M interacts with IL-1 beta through a thiol-disulfide exchange reaction. Zn2+ may play a major role in bringing together the reactive domains of the adjoining peptide backbones into proper orientation. The ready complex formation between F alpha 2M and the pleiotropic cytokine IL-1 beta suggests a novel biological role for F alpha 2M, since F alpha 2M-IL-1 beta complexes, but not F alpha 2M alone, retained IL-1-like activity in the thymocyte costimulator bioassay."

https://openalex.org/W1681030146,"Although there have been several reports pertaining to the existence of the cGMP-gated channel in the disk membrane of rod photoreceptors, its density there relative to that of the photoreceptor plasma membrane is unknown. Using immunoblotting, immunohistochemical, and reconstitution techniques on purified disk and plasma membrane preparations, we found that the density of channels in the plasma membrane was at least 50-fold higher than that of the disk membrane. Purification of membrane fractions without prior digestion of cytoskeletal components by mild trypsinization was found to increase the amount of channel protein present in disk membrane preparations. We propose that the presence of the channel protein in rod disk membrane preparations is an artifact arising from fusion of plasma membrane components during permeabilization of the photoreceptor cell."
https://openalex.org/W1505417279,"The ability of thrombin and collagen to induce protein-tyrosine phosphorylation in intact human platelets was assessed by using antibodies to phosphotyrosine in conjugation with immunoblots. Upon stimulation by thrombin there was an increase in the amount of protein-tyrosine phosphorylation of three bands with molecular masses of 135, 124, and 76 kDa in a time-dependent manner. The tyrosine phosphorylation in these three proteins increased in a concurrent fashion and reached a maximum level in 10 s and then a plateau or a slight decrease. Stimulation by collagen was also followed by an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of 135- and 124-kDa proteins. Unlike stimulation by thrombin, collagen induced no obvious tyrosine phosphorylation of 76-kDa protein. The time courses for thrombin- or collagen-induced protein-tyrosine phosphorylation were similar to that for [14C] serotonin release. These results suggest that 135- and 124-kDa proteins are a common set of proteins that become phosphorylated on tyrosine residue during platelet activation."
https://openalex.org/W1980672650,"The N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) class of excitatory amino acid receptors regulates the strength and stability of excitatory synapses and appears to play a major role in excitotoxic neuronal death associated with stroke and epilepsy. The conductance increase gated by NMDA is potentiated by the amino acid glycine, which acts at an allosteric site tightly coupled to the NMDA receptor. Indole-2-carboxylic acid (I2CA) specifically and competitively inhibits the potentiation by glycine of NMDA-gated current. In solutions containing low levels of glycine, I2CA completely blocks the response to NMDA, suggesting that NMDA alone is not sufficient for channel activation. I2CA will be useful for defining the interaction of glycine with NMDA receptors and for determining the in vivo role of glycine in excitotoxicity and synapse stabilization."

We describe the isolation of the DNA-RNA compound, the determination of its nucleotide sequence, and the nucleotide sequence of the genes required for its formation. The sequence contains the coding regions for the DNA component, the RNA component, and an open reading frame encoding a reverse transcriptase.

https://openalex.org/W1508115229,"Biochemical characteristics of the RNase H activity associated with immunoaffinity purified human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) reverse transcriptase (RT) were examined. Glycerol gradient centrifugation of HIV RT resulted in a single peak of RNase H, associated with RT activity, with an apparent molecular weight of 110,000. HIV RNase H exhibited a marked substrate preference for poly(dC).[3H]poly(rG) compared to poly(dT).[3H]poly(rA). It did not hydrolyze single-stranded RNA or the DNA component of DNA.RNA hybrids. Products of the HIV RT-associated RNase H reaction consisted primarily of monomers, dimers, and trimers with 3' OH groups. This reaction was Mg2+ dependent, with greater than 90% of maximum activity at MgCl2 concentrations between 4 and 12 mM. The optimum KCl concentration for HIV RT catalyzed polymerization with a poly(rA).(dT)10 template. The optimum pH for HIV RNase H activity was between 8.0 and 8.5, in contrast to an optimum pH of 7.5 to 8.0 for HIV RT activity. The association of RNase H activity with the p66 component of HIV RT was demonstrated by activity gel analysis. These results indicate that HIV RT has an integral RNase H activity; however, some of its properties are different from those of RNase H associated with other retroviral RT's, and optimal assay conditions are different than those for HIV RT catalyzed DNA polymerization."
https://openalex.org/W2141638142,"Abstract A novel type of N-linked glycopeptides representing a major part of the glycans in human small intestinal epithelial cells from blood group A and O individuals were isolated by gel filtrations and affinity chromatography on concanavalin A-Sepharose and Bandeiraea simplicifolia lectin I-Sepharose. Sugar composition, methylation analysis, 1H NMR spectroscopy of the underivatized glycopeptides and FAB-mass spectrometry and electron impact-mass spectrometry of the permethylated glycopeptides indicated a tri- and tetra-antennary structure containing an intersecting N-acetylglucosamine and an alpha (1----6)-linked fucose residue in the core unit for the majority of the glycans. In contrast to most glycopeptides of other sources, the intestinal glycopeptides were devoid of sialic acid, but contained 6-7 residues of fucose. The outer branches contained the following structures: Fuc alpha 1-2Gal beta 1-3GleNAc beta 1- (H type 1) Fuc alpha 1-2Gal beta 1-4GleNAc beta 1- (H type 2) Gal beta 1-4 (Fuc alpha 1-3)GlcNAc beta 1- (X) Fuc alpha 1-2Gal beta 1-4(Fuc alpha 1-3)GleNAc beta 1- (Y) GalNAc alpha 1-3(Fuc alpha 1-2)Gal beta 1-3GleNAc beta 1- (A type 1) GalNAc alpha 1-3(Fuc alpha 1-2)Gal beta 1-4GleNAc beta 1- (monofucosyl A type 2) GalNAc alpha 1-3(Fuc alpha 1-2)Gal beta 1-4 (Fuc alpha 1-3)GlcNAc beta 1- (trifucosyl A type 2) The blood group determinant structures were mainly of type 2, whereas glycolipids from the same cells contained mainly type 1 determinants. The polyfucosylated glycans represent a novel type of blood group active glycopeptides. The unique properties of the small intestinal glycopeptides as compared with glycopeptides of other tissue sources may be correlated with the specialized functional properties of the small intestinal epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W1598062712,"Abstract An important physiological control of the glycoprotein hormone alpha-subunit is the negative feedback by thyroid hormones in the thyrotrope. A region of the rat glycoprotein hormone alpha-subunit gene that is involved in transcriptional regulation by thyroid hormone has been identified by transient transfection studies, and sequence-specific binding of the thyroid hormone receptor to a site within this region has been demonstrated. Deletion-mutation studies using plasmid expression vectors containing either 246, 170, or 80 base pairs of the 5'-flanking region of the rat alpha-subunit gene fused to the coding region of the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene demonstrate 3,5,3'-triiodo-L-thyronine (T3)-regulated expression in GH3 cells, a T3-responsive somatotrophic cell line. In order to investigate the possibility of thyroid hormone receptor interaction with this segment of the rat alpha-subunit gene, the binding of the thyroid hormone receptor to synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides was analyzed using an avidin-biotin complex DNA binding assay. An oligodeoxyribonucleotide representing a fragment of the alpha-subunit gene from -74 to -38, relative to the transcriptional start site, shows significant binding to [125I]T3-receptor complex present in nuclear extracts of GH3 cells. This fragment binds receptor to a degree similar to that seen with a fragment of the rat growth hormone gene which contains a putative thyroid hormone-responsive element. In addition, this fragment of the rat alpha-subunit gene binds to the in vitro synthesized human c-erbA beta protein, which has been identified as a member of the family of putative T3 receptors. These data demonstrate that a cis-active thyroid hormone-responsive element resides in the 5'-flanking region of the rat alpha-subunit gene and that the mechanism involved in the suppression of expression of this gene by T3 could involve specific binding of the thyroid hormone receptor to this region of the gene."

https://openalex.org/W1681220287,"The beta-adrenergic receptor kinase, which specifically phosphorylates the agonist-occupied beta-adrenergic receptor, is strongly inhibited by polyanions. Heparin and dextran sulfate inhibit the enzyme with an IC50 of approximately 0.15 microM. De-N-sulfated heparin is approximately 8-fold less potent. Other acid mucopolysaccharides such as heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfates B and C are also less effective. Polyaspartic and polyglutamic acid also inhibit with IC50 values of 1.3-2 microM. Inositol hexasulfate, with an IC50 of 13 microM is approximately 270-fold more potent than inositol hexaphosphate implicating the sulfate group as a major determinant of the inhibition. The inhibition by heparin is competitive with substrate and of mixed type with respect to ATP. Polycations also inhibit receptor phosphorylation by beta-adrenergic receptor kinase. Polylysine is more effective with an IC50 of 69 microM, while spermine (990 microM) and spermidine (2570 microM) are less potent. Polylysine, spermine, and spermidine are also able to block effectively the inhibition by heparin. The identification of compounds which specifically inhibit beta-adrenergic receptor kinase should prove useful in further defining the biological role of this enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1582473274,"Abstract Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of the insulin receptor were examined permeabilized rat adipocytes using pulse-chase techniques. Maximum insulin-dependent phosphorylation during a 2-min labeling period with 75 microM [gamma-32P]ATP was attained at 10(-6)-10(-7) M insulin with a small effect at 10(-9) M. The reaction utilized either Mn2+ or Mg2+, but insulin-dependent phosphorylation was 11-fold greater with Mn2+. In the absence of insulin, phosphorylation was 6-fold greater with Mn2+. With either cation, insulin (10(-7) M) was a potent stimulator of receptor phosphorylation with 5- and 8-fold increases above control levels the presence of Mg2+ and Mn2+, respectively. Phosphorylation of the insulin receptor reached an apparent steady state within 30 s at 37 degrees C under all conditions. By phosphoamino acid analysis, all insulin- and Mn2+-dependent phosphorylation the 95-kDa subunit of the insulin receptor was phosphotyrosine. A small amount of phosphoserine was detected, but it was not affected by either insulin or Mn2+. Dephosphorylation of the insulin receptor was examined by chasing labeled ATP after 2 min with a 40-fold excess of unlabeled ATP. Maximum dephosphorylation was reached 2 min under all conditions. Insulin had no effect on the dephosphorylation reaction. The labile fraction of Mn2+-dependent phosphoreceptor dephosphorylated to one-half of its initial level approximately 21 s at 37 degrees C. Vanadate, a potent phosphotyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, inhibited dephosphorylation of this phosphoreceptor by 25%. When vanadate was present during the 2-min labeling period, phosphorylation of control, and insulin-dependent receptor was increased by 50%. In summary, rapid in vitro autophosphorylation of the insulin receptor is coupled to an equally rapid dephosphorylation reaction permeabilized adipocytes. This suggests that phosphorylation of the insulin receptor is a dynamic, rapidly reversible, insulin-dependent response target cells and is consistent with it being involved insulin signal transduction and insulin action."

When 3-base mismatches were introduced into the stem structure immediately upstream of the branched rG residue to which msDNA is linked by a 2',5'-phosphodiester linkage, the production of msDNA was almost completely blocked. However, if additional 3-base substitutions were made on the other strand to resume the complementary base pairing, msDNA production was restored, being consistent with the proposed model of msDNA synthesis. We also found that the branched rG residue of pre-msdRNA could not be replaced with either rC or rA, while the 5' end (dC) of msDNA which is linked to the branched rG could be substituted with a dG residue. Together with several other mutations, the structural requirements of pre-msdRNA are discussed with respect to the mechanism of msDNA biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1658751919,"Abstract The expression of cloned bacteriophage phi X174 lysis gene E was analyzed in minicells of Escherichia coli using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Beside the 10-11-kDa protein-E, at least two additional protein bands were detected, associated with the inner membrane, which showed the same isoelectric point as E. To clarify whether these proteins were E-specific, two different antibodies directed against a beta-galactosidase-E' hybrid protein and a synthetic oligopeptide corresponding to the C-terminal end of protein-E were raised. Immunoadsorption studies with anti-peptide-specific antibodies resulted in the detection of protein-E as well as in the detection of proteins of higher molecular weight. Two of these protein bands were positively recognized by anti beta-galactosidase-E' antibodies. The latter protein bands had the same molecular weight as the putative protein-E bands detected by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis indicating that these bands represent protein-E-specific oligomers. These data support the idea that an E-specific oligomeric structure penetrating the inner and outer membrane of E. coli is formed during the lytic action of protein-E."
https://openalex.org/W1518141379,"A chimeric G α subunit cDNA, referred to as G α s/i(38), was constructed containing the complete 5′-untranslated region of G αs, the first 356 codons of the rat G α s and the last 36 codons and 428 base pairs of the 3′-untranslated region of the rat G α i cDNA. Transient expression of the G αs/i(38) protein in COS cells allowed detection of a chimeric protein which was recognized by antibodies generated against an internal G αs sequence as well as antibodies recognizing the carboxyl terminus of G αi2. Chinese hamster ovary cell clones stably expressing the chimeric G-protein α subunit transcript (G αs/i(38] demonstrated 1.5–2.5-fold constitutively elevated cyclic AMP levels and a 3–4-fold increase in the activity ratio of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, although expression of the chimeric polypeptide could not be demonstrated presumably because of low expression of the mutant αs. Expression of the rat G αs transcript yielded clones that were similar to wild-type Chinese hamster ovary cells in regard to cyclic AMP levels and protein kinase activity. In the presence of methyl isobutylxanthine, a cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor, cyclic AMP levels in clones expressing the G αs/i(38) transcript were 10–15-fold higher than G αs expressing clones. Adenylyl cyclase activation by guanosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate) (GTP γ S) in membranes from clones expressing the G αs/i(38) transcript demonstrated a diminished lag time for maximal activation, indicating an increased relative GDP dissociation rate for the chimeric G α subunit and an increase in total adenylyl cyclase activity relative to wild-type G α s expressing clones. Cholate extracts from membranes of G αs/i(38) expressing clones, when mixed with cyc− S49 membranes, reconstituted an increased GTP γ S-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity and a diminished lag time for maximal activation compared to cholate extracts prepared from G αs-expressing clones. The G αs/i(38) construct confers a dominant constitutive activation of adenylyl cyclase when expressed in cells in the presence of a background of wild-type G αs."
https://openalex.org/W1578295668,"Abstract The relationship between DNA polymerases alpha and delta are evaluated immunologically by monoclonal antibody specifically against DNA polymerase alpha and murine polyclonal antiserum against calf thymus DNA polymerase delta. DNA polymerases alpha and delta are found to be immunologically distinct. The structural relationship between the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-dependent calf DNA polymerase delta and DNA polymerase alpha from human and calf was analyzed by two-dimensional tryptic peptide mapping of the catalytic polypeptides. The results demonstrate that the catalytic polypeptides of the PCNA-dependent calf polymerase delta and DNA polymerase alpha are distinct, unrelated, and do not share any common structural determinants. The immunological and structural relationship between a recently identified PCNA-independent form of DNA polymerase delta from HeLa cells was also assessed. This PCNA-independent human polymerase delta was found to be immunologically unrelated to human polymerase alpha but to share some immunological and structural determinants with the PCNA-dependent calf thymus polymerase delta."
https://openalex.org/W1570342789,"Abstract Addition of 20 mM ammonium chloride during in vitro chase incubation of [35S]methionine pulse-labeled parotid tissue does not perturb the magnitude or radiochemical composition of secretion stimulated by isoproterenol. An apparent inhibition of stimulated output of radiolabeled secretory proteins that was observed when ammonium chloride was added immediately postpulse (but not at later time points prior to stimulation) could be accounted for by slowdown in Golgi transit of exocrine secretory protein at a stage prior to completion of terminal glycosylation. Thus, ammonium chloride does not block entry of newly synthesized secretory proteins into the secretagogue-releasable storage granule compartment. By contrast, ammonium chloride increases the output and substantially alters the relative composition of newly synthesized protein in unstimulated secretion. The latter effects could be assigned to stages of intracellular transport that normally occur at chase times greater than 60 min postpulse and thus are focused within the maturing acinar storage granule. Notably, the compositional alterations cannot reflect the preferential exocytosis of immature granules. Taken together, these results suggest that the sorting of exocrine secretory proteins into the secretagogue-regulated pathway may not involve positive selection by a pH-based process initiated in a pregranule compartment. Rather, unstimulated secretion may arise by a negative sorting (or exclusion) process that occurs during compaction of proteins for storage within maturing granules and that is perturbed by weak base addition. Sorted (or excluded) proteins would appear to follow the vesicular (nongranular) secretory pathway that originates in maturing granules (von Zastrow, M., and Castle, J.D. (1987) J. Cell Biol. 105, 2675-2684)."
https://openalex.org/W1503598995,"The endocytosis, recycling, and degradation of the insulin receptor were studied in IM-9 cells and U-937 cells by employing two monoclonal antibodies directed at the alpha subunit of the human insulin receptor, antibodies MA-5 and MA-10. Antibody MA-5 is an insulin agonist and MA-10 is an insulin antagonist (Forsayeth, J., Caro, J.F., Sinha, M.K., Maddux, B.A., and Goldfine, I.D. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 84, 3448-3451). Both monoclonal antibodies, like insulin, induced the endocytosis of the insulin receptor within 15 min. Upon removal of extracellular ligand the internalized receptor recycled to the cell surface. At this time there was no degradation of the receptor as measured by a sensitive insulin receptor radioimmunoassay. After 20 h of incubation, insulin and MA-5, but not MA-10, induced significant receptor degradation as measured by both insulin receptor radioimmunoassay and metabolic labeling studies. These studies demonstrated, therefore, that: 1) internalization and recycling of the receptor can be induced by antireceptor monoclonal antibodies that are either insulin agonists or insulin antagonists; 2) enhanced receptor degradation can be induced by monoclonal antibodies that are insulin agonists; and 3) the process of receptor internalization does not necessarily lead to enhanced receptor degradation. Since prior studies have indicated that neither MA-5 nor MA-10 enhance insulin receptor kinase activity, the present studies also suggest that insulin receptor endocytosis and degradation induced by ligands different than insulin can occur without activation of this process."
https://openalex.org/W1601407224,"Abstract Monoclonal antibodies against gizzard smooth muscle myosin were generated and characterized. One of these antibodies, designated MM-2, recognized the 17-kDa light chain and modulated the ATPase activities and hydrodynamic properties of smooth muscle myosin. Rotary shadowing electron microscopy showed that MM-2 binds 51 (+/- 25) A from the head-rod junction. The depression of Ca2+- and Mg2+-ATPase activities of myosin and Ca2+-ATPase activity of heavy meromyosin at low KCl concentration were abolished by MM-2. Viscosity measurement indicated that MM-2 inhibits the transition of 6 S myosin to 10 S myosin. While the rate of the production of subfragment-1 by papain proteolysis of 6 S myosin was inhibited by MM-2, the rate of proteolysis of the heavy chain of 10 S myosin was enhanced by MM-2 and reached the same rate as that of 6 S myosin plus MM-2. These results suggest that MM-2 inhibits the formation of 10 S myosin by binding to the 17-kDa light chain which is localized at the head-neck region of the myosin molecule. MM-2 increased the Vmax of actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase activities of both dephosphorylated myosin and dephosphorylated heavy meromyosin about 10- and 20-fold, respectively. MM-2 also activated the actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase activity of phosphorylated myosin at a low MgCl2 concentration and thus abolished the Mg2+-dependence of acto phosphorylated myosin ATPase activity. These results suggest that MM-2 inhibits the formation of 10 S myosin, and this results in the activation of actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase activity even in the absence of phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1680737488,"A mutation in the BALB/cHeA subline of mice has resulted in loss of the glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (glycerol-P dehydrogenase) activity in adult tissues. Analysis of F2 offspring segregating for enzyme activity levels and a PvuII restriction fragment length polymorphism in the Gdc-1 gene on Chromosome 15 indicates that the mutation has occurred in or around the structural gene. Southern blot analysis failed to detect any major change due to chromosomal insertion, deletion, or rearrangement of the mutant gene. In vitro measurements of transcription in isolated nuclei failed to detect any difference in transcription between the BALB/cHeA and BALB/cBy strains of mice. However, Northern blot analysis with poly(A+) RNA isolated from brown fat shows that the mutant has about a 50-fold reduction in hybridizable transcripts of altered size. The data suggest that the mutation affected the processing of nuclear transcripts of glycerol-P dehydrogenase. The morphological, physiological, and reproductive characteristics of the mutant mice appear normal. This suggests that alternate pathways of energy metabolism and lipid synthesis exist which obviate the function of glycerol-P dehydrogenase."

https://openalex.org/W1498232340,"Tumors and activated macrophages release angiogenic factors that stimulate migration and proliferation of capillaries. We studied the development of angiogenesis before the appearance of mesotheliomas in C57B1/6 mice. Weekly i.p. injections of crocidolite asbestos fibers produced mesotheliomas after 30-50 wk. The initial histologic response to asbestos fibers was a nodular lesion on the peritoneal lining composed of clusters of fibers, activated macrophages, and proliferating mesenchymal cells. The earliest visible evidence of angiogenesis was seen surrounding 7% of these lesions 14 days after a single injection of 200 μg of crocidolite asbestos fibers. After six weekly injections, 30% of the lesions containing asbestos fibers were surrounded by a capillary network radiating toward the center of the lesion. Other mineral fibers, including chrysotile asbestos and fiberglass, also induced angiogenesis after six weekly injections. In contrast, only 8% of the lesions containing short asbestos fibers (90.6% ≤ 2.0 μm) and 9% of the lesions containing silica particles showed evidence of angiogenesis. We conclude that tumorigenic mineral fibers induce angiogenesis in the peritoneal lining, whereas nontumorigenic mineral particles or short asbestos fibers are less effective. Ingrowth of new blood vessels around clusters of asbestos fibers may facilitate the later emergence of mesotheliomas at these sites.— Branchaud, R. M.; MacDonald, J. L.; Kane, A. B.

https://openalex.org/W1534161602,"Abstract Insulin treatment of rat H-35 hepatoma cells causes rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of a high molecular weight protein termed pp185 besides autophosphorylation of the beta-subunit of the insulin receptor (IR) in an intact cell system. To elucidate the molecular basis for tyrosine phosphorylation of pp185, cell-free phosphorylation of pp185 was performed using phosphotyrosine-containing proteins (PYPs) purified from detergent-solubilized cell lysates by immunoprecipitation with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. After insulin treatment of cells, marked increases of tyrosine phosphorylation of pp185 and IR were observed compared to noninsulin-treated cells. Site-specific antibodies that specifically inactivate IR kinase inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation of pp185 as well as the beta-subunit of IR. PYPs purified from detergent-free cell extracts contained pp185 but little IR; tyrosine phosphorylation of pp185 did not occur. Addition of IR kinase purified from human placenta to these PYPs restored insulin-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of pp185. These results suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of pp185 is catalyzed directly by IR kinase in this cell-free system."
https://openalex.org/W1608130260,"Abstract Dictyostelium discoideum glycoproteins contain mannose-6-SO4 in highly immunogenic N-linked oligosaccharides. To more precisely define the structural requirements of the antigenic determinant, we have analyzed the oligosaccharides synthesized by two mutant strains (HL241 and HL243) that lack it. Both mutant strains synthesize N-linked oligosaccharides which are very similar to each other but are smaller and less charged than those derived from the wild-type. Both mutants contain substantial amounts of Man-6-SO4, and only a single residue of Man-6-P-OCH3 per chain, in contrast to the wild-type which may have 1 or 2 such residues. Neutral species are similar to the wild-type in that they can still be modified by the addition of residues of fucose and N-acetylglucosamine. Both mutant strains synthesize a truncated lipid-linked oligosaccharide, Man6GlcNAc2, with the most probable structure being: (sequence; see text) based on Jack bean alpha-mannosidase, alpha-1,2-specific mannosidase digestions and methylation analysis. The presence of this small oligosaccharide appears to result from the loss of the mannosyltransferase(s) needed to synthesize structures larger than Man6GlcNAc2 and not from the absence of dolichol phosphate or dolichol-P-mannose synthetase. These data along with the analysis of another mutant strain suggest that the expression of the antigenic determinant requires a specific arrangement of Man-6-SO4 on the alpha-1,6 branch of the oligosaccharide linked to the beta-mannose."
https://openalex.org/W1497468909,"Abstract DNA sequences affecting the transcription of the Escherichia coli rnpB transcript encoding the catalytic M1 RNA subunit of RNase P have been analyzed. Previous work (Motamedi, H., Lee, Y., and Schmidt, F.J.) (1984) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 81, 3959-3963) identified S1 nuclease protection products corresponding to transcripts originating upstream of the M1 RNA gene. Sequence analysis of the upstream region of rnpB identified three regions homologous to the E. coli consensus promoter sequence. In the present work, analysis of in vitro transcription products by S1 nuclease mapping indicated that all three promoter homologies were capable of directing transcription. The nearest promoter, P-1, was approximately 100 times more active than either of the upstream homologies P-2 and vivo experiments, wherein the three promoter homologies preceding rnpB were cloned into the galactokinase (GalK) expression vector pKO100. The promoter homology nearest to the M1 RNA gene directed the synthesis of GalK above background. The upstream promoter homologies did not direct the synthesis of GalK at a level greater than 1% of transcription from P-1. Deletion of the upstream homologies did not affect transcription from P-1. It was concluded that P-1 is responsible for essentially all M1 RNA transcription in vivo. Single-round transcription experiments in vitro detected strong NusA-independent transcriptional pausing at nucleotides +118 and +121 of the rnpB transcript, with a half-life of 27 s when concentrations of NTPs were near the average Km for elongation. Pausing at these points was eliminated by substitution of ITP for GTP in the transcription mixture. This suggests that pausing is dependent on transcript secondary structure. The position of pausing corresponds to that of a dual stem and loop structure of M1 RNA which has recently been proposed on the basis of phylogenetic sequence analysis."

https://openalex.org/W1550191006,"The coat protein of belladonna mottle virus (a tymovirus) was cleaved by trypsin and chymotrypsin, and the peptides were separated by high performance liquid chromatography using a combination of gel permeation, reverse phase, and ion pair chromatography. The peptides were sequenced manually using the 4-N, N-dimethylaminoazobenzene-4'-isothiocyanate/phenyl isothiocyanate double-coupling method. The chymotryptic peptides were aligned by overlapping sequences of tryptic peptides and by homology with another tymovirus, eggplant mosaic virus. The belladonna mottle virus is more closely related to eggplant mosaic virus than to turnip yellow mosaic virus, the type member of this group, as evident from the sequence homologies of 57 and 32%, respectively. The accumulation of basic residues at the amino terminus implicated in RNA-protein interactions in many spherical plant viruses was absent in all the three sequences. Interestingly, the amino-terminal region is the least conserved among the tymoviruses. The longest stretch of conserved sequence between belladonna mottle virus and eggplant mosaic virus was residues 34-44, whereas it was residues 96-102 in the case of belladonna mottle virus and turnip yellow mosaic virus. A tetrapeptide in the region (residues 154-157) was found to be common for all the three sequences. It is possible that these conserved regions (residues 34-44, 96-102, 154-157) are involved in either intersubunit or RNA-protein interactions."
