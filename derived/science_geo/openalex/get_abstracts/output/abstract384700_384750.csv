https://openalex.org/W1997405626,"Riccardo Velasco and colleagues report the genome sequence of the 'Golden Delicious' domesticated apple. These data shed new insight into the genomic events that preceded the origin of this crop. We report a high-quality draft genome sequence of the domesticated apple (Malus × domestica). We show that a relatively recent (>50 million years ago) genome-wide duplication (GWD) has resulted in the transition from nine ancestral chromosomes to 17 chromosomes in the Pyreae. Traces of older GWDs partly support the monophyly of the ancestral paleohexaploidy of eudicots. Phylogenetic reconstruction of Pyreae and the genus Malus, relative to major Rosaceae taxa, identified the progenitor of the cultivated apple as M. sieversii. Expansion of gene families reported to be involved in fruit development may explain formation of the pome, a Pyreae-specific false fruit that develops by proliferation of the basal part of the sepals, the receptacle. In apple, a subclade of MADS-box genes, normally involved in flower and fruit development, is expanded to include 15 members, as are other gene families involved in Rosaceae-specific metabolism, such as transport and assimilation of sorbitol."
https://openalex.org/W1990473626,"α-Synuclein and Aging Transgenic α-synuclein can reverse the otherwise lethal neurodegeneration of cysteine string protein-α knockout mice via changes in SNARE proteins, which mediate synaptic vesicle release. Using experiments with purified recombinant proteins, triple αβγ-synuclein knockout mice, and studies of mouse aging, Burré et al. (p. 1663 , published online 26 August) now demonstrate that α-synuclein directly interacts with the SNARE protein synaptobrevin and functions as a catalyst for SNARE-complex assembly. The role of synucleins is fully dispensable in young animals, but becomes essential late in life, which suggests that α-synuclein maintains normal synaptic function during aging."
https://openalex.org/W1967003847,"In everyday life, many people believe that two heads are better than one. Our ability to solve problems together appears to be fundamental to the current dominance and future survival of the human species. But are two heads really better than one? We addressed this question in the context of a collective low-level perceptual decision-making task. For two observers of nearly equal visual sensitivity, two heads were definitely better than one, provided they were given the opportunity to communicate freely, even in the absence of any feedback about decision outcomes. But for observers with very different visual sensitivities, two heads were actually worse than the better one. These seemingly discrepant patterns of group behavior can be explained by a model in which two heads are Bayes optimal under the assumption that individuals accurately communicate their level of confidence on every trial."
https://openalex.org/W2054964992,"Freezing Tolerance Explained Freezing temperatures exact a toll on plant cells through various mechanisms, including disruption of water balances as ice crystals form. Cellular and organelle lipid bilayers are also put under stress. Moellering et al. (p. 226 , published online 26 August; see the Perspective by Browse ) analyzed the function of a protein in the model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana that, when disrupted, leaves plants more susceptible to damage by freezing. The protein, SENSITIVE TO FREEZING 2 (SFR2), shifts and swaps lipid headgroups, altering the chemistry of the chloroplast lipid bilayer membranes to stabilize them during freezing."
https://openalex.org/W2088458301,"The Kepler spacecraft is monitoring more than 150,000 stars for evidence of planets transiting those stars. We report the detection of two Saturn-size planets that transit the same Sun-like star, based on 7 months of Kepler observations. Their 19.2- and 38.9-day periods are presently increasing and decreasing at respective average rates of 4 and 39 minutes per orbit; in addition, the transit times of the inner body display an alternating variation of smaller amplitude. These signatures are characteristic of gravitational interaction of two planets near a 2:1 orbital resonance. Six radial-velocity observations show that these two planets are the most massive objects orbiting close to the star and substantially improve the estimates of their masses. After removing the signal of the two confirmed giant planets, we identified an additional transiting super-Earth-size planet candidate with a period of 1.6 days."
https://openalex.org/W2020584700,"Making Roots A tiny bunch of stem cells generates the bulk and diversity of plant roots. These cells are found at the root meristem and are themselves regulated by signaling inputs from a variety of sources. In Arabidopsis , Matsuzaki et al. (p. 1065 ) have identified a family of peptide factors that regulate these root stem cells. These peptides, known as root meristem growth factors, carry the post-translational modification, tyrosine sulfation, and are essential for maintaining the root stem cell niche."
https://openalex.org/W2022145641,"Swelling Pores Porosity is a key parameter when selecting materials for catalysts, chemical separations, gas storage, host-guest interactions, and related chemical processes. In most cases the porosity of a material is fixed. Rabone et al. (p. 1053 ; see the Perspective by Wright ) have described a molecular material in which the size of the pores changed during the sorption process. The porosity increased because a dipeptide linker between metal centers reoriented during uptake of some gases, thus improving the capacity of the material to adsorb."
https://openalex.org/W2125214575,"Construction of a complex virus may involve a hierarchy of assembly elements. Here, we report the structure of the whole human adenovirus virion at 3.6 angstroms resolution by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), revealing in situ atomic models of three minor capsid proteins (IIIa, VIII, and IX), extensions of the (penton base and hexon) major capsid proteins, and interactions within three protein-protein networks. One network is mediated by protein IIIa at the vertices, within group-of-six (GOS) tiles--a penton base and its five surrounding hexons. Another is mediated by ropes (protein IX) that lash hexons together to form group-of-nine (GON) tiles and bind GONs to GONs. The third, mediated by IIIa and VIII, binds each GOS to five surrounding GONs. Optimization of adenovirus for cancer and gene therapy could target these networks."

https://openalex.org/W1967998693,"Improving Earth Models The geophysical processes responsible for shaping the planet's surface and interior need largescale simulations, but to achieve high resolution at these scales is costly and tends to focus on gradual processes such as plate tectonics. By using large parallel supercomputers, Stadler et al. (p. 1033 ; see the Perspective by Becker ; see the cover) have improved on a commonly used method—adaptive mesh refinement—to increase the resolution of global geodynamic models to the scale of a single kilometer and been able to reveal unexpected insights into localized processes, such as subduction zone mechanics, thermal anomalies in the lower mantle, and the speed of movement of oceanic plates."
https://openalex.org/W1980781458,"Forced Open Traditionally, the study of reaction chemistry has relied on random encounters between molecules to initiate the proceedings. Heating and stirring increase the power and frequency of such encounters but provide little finer control. Very recently, chemists have learned how to initiate reactions more directly by embedding precursors in the backbone of a polymer large enough to manipulate with shear forces. Lenhardt et al. (p. 1057 ) applied this technique to a cyclopropyl ring-opening reaction. When the strained triangular carbon rings were embedded within a polymer, shear force applied by sonication ruptured their bonds as the polymer backbone stretched. The taut polymer then redirected the ring-opened intermediates toward a product differently arranged from that generated by simple heating."
https://openalex.org/W1987935503,"A phosphoramidate prodrug of 2'-deoxy-2'-α-fluoro-β-C-methyluridine-5'-monophosphate, PSI-7851, demonstrates potent anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) activity both in vitro and in vivo. PSI-7851 is a mixture of two diastereoisomers, PSI-7976 and PSI-7977, with PSI-7977 being the more active inhibitor of HCV RNA replication in the HCV replicon assay. To inhibit the HCV NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, PSI-7851 must be metabolized to the active triphosphate form. The first step, hydrolysis of the carboxyl ester by human cathepsin A (CatA) and/or carboxylesterase 1 (CES1), is a stereospecific reaction. Western blot analysis showed that CatA and CES1 are both expressed in primary human hepatocytes. However, expression of CES1 is undetectable in clone A replicon cells. Studies with inhibitors of CatA and/or CES1 indicated that CatA is primarily responsible for hydrolysis of the carboxyl ester in clone A cells, although in primary human hepatocytes, both CatA and CES1 contribute to the hydrolysis. Hydrolysis of the ester is followed by a putative nucleophilic attack on the phosphorus by the carboxyl group resulting in the spontaneous elimination of phenol and the production of an alaninyl phosphate metabolite, PSI-352707, which is common to both isomers. The removal of the amino acid moiety of PSI-352707 is catalyzed by histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein 1 (Hint1) to give the 5'-monophosphate form, PSI-7411. siRNA-mediated Hint1 knockdown studies further indicate that Hint1 is, at least in part, responsible for converting PSI-352707 to PSI-7411. PSI-7411 is then consecutively phosphorylated to the diphosphate, PSI-7410, and to the active triphosphate metabolite, PSI-7409, by UMP-CMP kinase and nucleoside diphosphate kinase, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2171595628,"Intracellular pH and Lipid Metabolism Intracellular pH regulates metabolism by poorly understood mechanisms, but biosensors are likely to be important in this process. Young et al. (p. 1085 ) took a systems-biology approach in yeast to identify in excess of 200 genes that regulate phospholipid metabolism. They found that the signaling lipid, phosphatidic acid, appeared to act as a cytosolic biosensor via the pH-dependent binding of protein effectors to phosphatidic acid. This pH-dependent mechanism directly affects gene expression and is involved in a pathway in which nutrient availability regulates phospholipid metabolism to control production of membranes."

Rational engineering of safe adenovirus vectors has been hampered by a lack of high-resolution structural information. Two papers now describe the structure of human adenovirus using complementary techniques. Reddy et al. (p. 1071 ; see the Perspective by Harrison ) have determined the crystal structure at 3.5 angstrom resolution, while Liu et al. (p. 1038 ; see the Perspective by Harrison ) solved the structure to 3.6 angstrom resolution by electron microscopy. Together the structures provide insights into viral assembly, stabilization, and cell entry mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2105586915,"Plants emit green leaf volatiles (GLVs) in response to herbivore damage, thereby attracting predators of the herbivores as part of an indirect defense. The GLV component of this indirect defense was thought to be a general wound signal lacking herbivore-specific information. We found that Manduca sexta-infested Nicotiana attenuata attract the generalist hemipteran predator Geocoris spp. as the result of an herbivore-induced decrease in the (Z)/(E) ratio of released GLVs, and that these changes in the volatile bouquet triple the foraging efficiency of predators in nature. These (E)-isomers are produced from plant-derived (Z)-isomers but are converted by a heat-labile constituent of herbivore oral secretions. Hence, attacking herbivores initiate the release of an indirect defense a full day before the attacked plants manufacture their own defensive compounds."

https://openalex.org/W2162657231,"Many important moral decisions, particularly at the policy level, require the evaluation of choices involving outcomes of variable magnitude and probability. Many economic decisions involve the same problem. It is not known whether and to what extent these structurally isomorphic decisions rely on common neural mechanisms. Subjects undergoing fMRI evaluated the moral acceptability of sacrificing a single life to save a larger group of variable size and probability of dying without action. Paralleling research on economic decision making, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and ventral striatum were specifically sensitive to the ""expected moral value"" of actions, i.e., the expected number of lives lost/saved. Likewise, the right anterior insula was specifically sensitive to outcome probability. Other regions tracked outcome certainty and individual differences in utilitarian tendency. The present results suggest that complex life-and-death moral decisions that affect others depend on neural circuitry adapted for more basic, self-interested decision making involving material rewards."
https://openalex.org/W2009342550,"The central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) serves as a major output of this structure and plays a critical role in the expression of conditioned fear. By combining cell- and tissue-specific pharmacogenetic inhibition with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we identified circuits downstream of CeA that control fear expression in mice. Selective inhibition of a subset of neurons in CeA led to decreased conditioned freezing behavior and increased cortical arousal as visualized by fMRI. Correlation analysis of fMRI signals identified functional connectivity between CeA, cholinergic forebrain nuclei, and activated cortical structures, and cortical arousal was blocked by cholinergic antagonists. Importantly, inhibition of these neurons switched behavioral responses to the fear stimulus from passive to active responses. Our findings identify a neural circuit in CeA that biases fear responses toward either passive or active coping strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2055848667,"Gaining from a Loss Mitotic recombination can cause a cell carrying heterozygous mutations in a tumor suppressor gene to lose the wild-type copy of the gene, setting the cell on the pathway to uncontrolled growth. But can mitotic recombination have beneficial effects in other settings—that is, lead to phenotypic correction of a diseased cell by facilitating loss of the disease-causing mutation? Choate et al. (p. 94 , published online 26 August; see the Perspective by Davis and Candotti ) now find evidence for this type of event in a rare skin disease called ichthyosis with confetti (IWC). Patients with IWC display severe scaling of the skin but have widespread patches of normal skin that reflect clonal expansion of revertant cells. The revertant cells showed loss of heterozygosity on chromosome 17q and, as a result of mitotic recombination, these cells selectively lost dominant disease-causing mutations in the keratin 10 gene ( KRT10 ), but retained the wild-type copy of the gene."
https://openalex.org/W2074955153,"West Nile virus (WNV) is the most common arthropod-borne flavivirus in the United States; however, the vector ligand(s) that participate in infection are not known. We now show that an Aedes aegypti C-type lectin, mosGCTL-1, is induced by WNV, interacts with WNV in a calcium-dependent manner, and facilitates infection in vivo and in vitro. A mosquito homolog of human CD45 in A. aegypti, designated mosPTP-1, recruits mosGCTL-1 to enable viral attachment to cells and to enhance viral entry. In vivo experiments show that mosGCTL-1 and mosPTP-1 function as part of the same pathway and are critical for WNV infection of mosquitoes. A similar phenomenon was also observed in Culex quinquefasciatus, a natural vector of WNV, further demonstrating that these genes participate in WNV infection. During the mosquito blood-feeding process, WNV infection was blocked in vivo with mosGCTL-1 antibodies. A molecular understanding of flaviviral-arthropod interactions may lead to strategies to control viral dissemination in nature."
https://openalex.org/W2084803447,"Cracking Up Transform faults perpendicular to mid-ocean ridges are some of the most prominently visual features on the sea floor. Because they form slowly over thousands of years, the lack of observational data means their mechanism of formation has remained controversial. Taking a numerical modeling approach, Gerya (p. 1047 ) suggests that due to asymmetric growth of the plate boundary, sections of the mid-ocean ridge become unstable and eventually rotate 90°. As the ridge continues to grow, the transform faults continue to develop long after their initiation. This mechanism also explains how offsets of these transform faults occur discontinuously as a result of new fractures at the ridge."
https://openalex.org/W2059882356,"The Keap1/Nrf2/ARE pathway controls a network of cytoprotective genes that defend against the damaging effects of oxidative and electrophilic stress, and inflammation. Induction of this pathway is a highly effective strategy in combating the risk of cancer and chronic degenerative diseases, including atherosclerosis and neurodegeneration. An acetylenic tricyclic bis(cyano enone) bearing two highly electrophilic Michael acceptors is an extremely potent inducer in cells and in vivo. We demonstrate spectroscopically that both cyano enone functions of the tricyclic molecule react with cysteine residues of Keap1 and activate transcription of cytoprotective genes. Novel monocyclic cyano enones, representing fragments of rings A and C of the tricyclic compound, reveal that the contribution to inducer potency of the ring C Michael acceptor is much greater than that of ring A, and that potency is further enhanced by spatial proximity of an acetylenic function. Critically, the simultaneous presence of two cyano enone functions in rings A and C within a rigid three-ring system results in exceptionally high inducer potency. Detailed understanding of the structural elements that contribute to the reactivity with the protein sensor Keap1 and to high potency of induction is essential for the development of specific and selective lead compounds as clinically relevant chemoprotective agents.

The Keap1/Nrf2/ARE pathway regulates the ability of eukaryotic organisms to adapt and survive under various conditions of oxidative, electrophilic, and inflammatory stress by signaling the expression of a network of more than 100 genes, many of which code for cytoprotective (“phase 2”) proteins. Under basal conditions, this pathway does not operate at its maximal capacity, but can be induced by a wide variety of different classes of small molecules (1Talalay P. Fahey J.W. Holtzclaw W.D.

This strategy protects cells against stressful conditions, and reduces the risk of developing cancer and chronic degenerative diseases. One universal property of inducers is their capacity to modify sulfhydryl groups by alkylation, oxidoreduction, or disulfide formation. Of central importance in this respect is the reaction of inducers with specific cysteine residues of the protein sensor Keap1 (3Dinkova-Kostova A.T. Holtzclaw W.D. Cole R.N. Itoh K. Wakabayashi N.

The identification and analysis of the mechanism of action of potentially useful upregulators (inducers) of the cytoprotective response has been greatly advanced by the development of a simple, cell-based microtiter plate assay, in which the potency of compounds to increase the specific activity of NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), a prototypic Nrf2-dependent gene, can be quantified in murine hepatoma cells (8Prochaska H.J.

Methods Enzymol. 2004; 382: 243-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). This system has identified many cytoprotectors, and led to the isolation of the isothiocyanate sulforaphane [1-isothiocyanato-4R-(methylsulfinyl)butane] from broccoli (10Zhang Y. Talalay P. Cho C.G. Posner G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 2399-2403Crossref PubMed Scopus (1518) Google Scholar). This discovery highlighted the importance of thiol reactivity (i.e. the isothiocyante functionality) for inducer activity. The isothiocyanate group was shown spectroscopically to react directly with specific cysteine residues of Keap1 (3Dinkova-Kostova A.T. Holtzclaw W.D. Cole R.N. Itoh K. Wakabayashi N. Katoh Y.

Toxicol. 2005; 18: 1917-1926Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). High potency depends on the presence of the methylsulfinyl group separated by a bridge of 4-methylene groups from the -N=C=S moiety. Replacement of the sulfinyl (S=O) by a carbonyl (C=O) group did not affect potency, but its replacement by a methylene (-CH2-) group drastically reduced potency (∼75-fold). Changes in the length of the methylene (-CH2)n bridge (where n = 3 or 5) resulted in modest reductions in inducer potency when compared with sulforaphane, and there were also reductions in inducer potency when the state of oxidation of the sulfinyl group was changed to sulfide (-S-) or sulfonyl (O=S=O). The critical relation of the distance and the topographic relation of the two reactive groups was also suggested by examining the inducer potencies of a series of isomeric norbornane analogs substituted with CH3CO- and -N=C=S groups (12Posner G.H. Cho C.G. Green J.V. Zhang Y. Talalay P. J. Med. Chem. 1994; 37: 170-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Very recently, a series of sulfoxythiocarbamate analogs of sulforaphane were synthesized that retain the structural features important for high inducer potency, i.e. a sulfinyl or a carbonyl group at a specific distance from the electrophilic functional group (13Ahn Y.H. Hwang Y. Liu H. Wang X.J. Zhang Y. Stephenson K.K. Boronina T.N. Cole R.N. Dinkova-Kostova A.T. Talalay P. Cole P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 9590-9595Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). A critical clue to the structural features of inducers required for the chemical signaling of induction was the recognition that many inducers contained Michael acceptors i.e. olefins or acetylenes that are rendered more electrophilic (positively charged) by conjugation with electron-withdrawing groups such as carbonyl [C=O], sulfinyl [S=O], nitrile [C≡N], or acetylene [C≡C]. Moreover, the inducer potencies of these Michael acceptors are closely correlated with the degree of their electrophilicity and consequently with their rates of reaction with nucleophiles (14Talalay P. De Long M.J. Prochaska H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1988; 85: 8261-8265Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar).

Among them, the acetylenic tricyclic bis(cyano enone) TBE-31 [(±)-(4bS,8aR,10aS)-10a-ethynyl-4b,8,8-trimethyl-3,7-dioxo-3,4b,7,8,8a,9,10,10a-octahydrophenanthrene-2,6-dicarbonitrile] (Fig. 1) retains and even exceeds the potency of CDDO analogs, which are the most potent compounds in our pool of semisynthestic triterpenoids in various in vitro and in vivo assays, including induction of cytoprotective enzymes (29Liby K.

Moreover, this compound inhibits pro-inflammatory responses in cells, and blocks the formation of aflatoxin-B1 (AFB1)-DNA adducts and AFB1-induced tumorigenesis in vivo (29Liby K. Yore M.M.

The present investigation addresses the structural requirements that determine the exceedingly high potency of this molecule in inducing cytoprotective proteins and the spectral characteristics of its reaction product with the protein sensor for inducers Keap1. Sufficient amount of TBE-31 for the in vivo studies was synthesized in 13 steps from 2-methoxycarbonylcyclohexanone according to our previous method (28Honda T. Sundararajan C. Yoshizawa H. Su X.

MCE-1 [(±)-3-ethynyl-3-methyl-6-oxocyclohexa-1,4-dienecarbonitrile] was synthesized in 12 steps from ethyl 4-oxocyclohexanecarboxylate (30Honda T. David E. Mierke D.F. U.S. Patent WO 2010/011782 A1. 2010; (January, 28)Google Scholar), which is commercially available at TCI America, Portland, OR. MCE-5 [(3,3,5,5-tetramethyl-6-oxocyclohex-1-enecarbonitrile)] was synthesized in five steps (30Honda T. David E. Mierke D.F. U.S. Patent WO 2010/011782 A1. 2010; (January, 28)Google Scholar) from 2,4,4-trimethylcyclohex-2-enone, which was prepared by Robinson annulation with isobutyraldehyde and ethyl vinyl ketone (31Paquette L.A.

MCE-2 [3,3-dimethyl-6-oxocyclohexa-1,4-dienecarbonitrile] was synthesized in 5 steps from 4,4-dimethylcyclohex-2-en-1-one by a known method (32Liu H.J. Yip J. Synlett. 2000; : 1119-1122Google Scholar). All compounds yielded acceptable HRMS data (±5 ppm) and 1H NMR spectra that exhibit no discernible impurities. Full details of the chemical synthesis and analyses of the MCEs are given in Ref. 30Honda T. David E. Mierke D.F. U.S. Patent WO 2010/011782 A1. 2010; (January, 28)Google Scholar. All cell lines were grown in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Murine hepatoma (Hepa1c1c7) cells were maintained in α-MEM basal medium supplemented with 10% FBS (heat-inactivated at 55 °C for 90 min with 1% activated charcoal). The stable human mammary ARE-reporter cell line originally derived from MCF-7 breast cancer cells, AREc32, was maintained in DMEM with glutamax, supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated FBS, penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) derived from day 13.5 embryos of wild-type or Nrf2-knock-out C57BL/6 mice were maintained in plastic culture dishes coated for 30 min with 0.1% (w/v) gelatin before use. MEF cells were grown in Iscoves Modified Dulbecco's Medium (with l-glutamine) supplemented with human recombinant epidermal growth factor (10 ng/ml), 1 × insulin/transferring/selenium, and 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated FBS. All animal experiments were performed in accordance with the regulations described in the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. SKH-1 hairless mice (6 weeks old) were obtained from Charles River (Germany) and were bred in our animal facility. The animals were kept on a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle, 35% humidity, and given free access to water and food (RM1 diet obtained from SDS Ltd., Witham, Essex, UK). We used 10–12-week-old SKH-1 hairless female mice. Of note, these mice are immunocompetent, but have a defect in the hair cycle, which results in permanent hair loss during adulthood. For topical applications, the animals were treated on their backs three times at 24-h intervals with 0.03, 0.1, or 0.3 μmol of TBE-31 dissolved in 80% aqueous acetone (v/v, 100 μl) over ∼5 cm2 area. Control skin received 80% acetone. Mice were euthanized 24 h after the final dose was applied. Each treated segment of their skin was harvested, flash-frozen in liquid N2, and stored at −80 °C until analyzed. For the feeding experiment, all animals received powdered RM1 diet for 1 week. Then, they were divided into three groups of four animals. Pure crystalline TBE-31 was mixed with the powdered diet in order to obtain 0.1 μmol/3 g diet (9.2 mg of TBE-31 per kg of diet) for the low-dose, and 0.3 μmol/3 g diet for the high-dose treatment groups, respectively. Group 1 received the control diet, Group 2 was fed the low-dose, and Group 3, the high-dose TBE-containing diet. After 11 days of feeding with these diets, the animals were euthanized and their liver, stomach, skin, and cerebral cortex were harvested, flash-frozen in liquid N2, and stored at −80 °C until analyzed. Hepa1c1c7 cells (104 per well) and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF, 2 × 104 per well) were grown in 96-well plates for 24 h and then exposed to serial dilutions of inducers for either 48 (Hepa1c1c7) or 24 h (MEF). Enzyme activity of NQO1 in cell lysates was determined by using menadione as a substrate as described (8Prochaska H.J. Santamaria A.B. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 169: 328-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 9Fahey J.W. Dinkova-Kostova A.T. Stephenson K.K. Talalay P. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 382: 243-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). To determine the enzyme activity in mouse organs, portions (∼50 mg) of snap-frozen tissues were pulverized under liquid nitrogen. The resulting powder was resuspended in 3 volumes (0.15 ml) of ice-cold 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and complete protease inhibitor mixture at a dose of one tablet/10 ml buffer. This material was mechanically homogenized in an ice bath. For skin samples only, mechanical homogenization was also followed by three freeze-thaw cycles. All resulting homogenates were subjected to two centrifugation steps at 4 °C (15,000 × g for 10 min, followed by 100,000 × g for 90 min). Protein concentrations (33Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18714) Google Scholar) and enzyme activities of NQO1 (8Prochaska H.J. Santamaria A.B. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 169: 328-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar) and GST (34Habig W.H. Jakoby W.B. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 77: 218-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) were determined in the final 100,000 × g supernatant fractions (cytosols), which were also used for Western blotting for GSTA1, GSTM1, and GSTP1. Potencies of induction of NQO1 were determined in a standard assay system, and were analyzed by the Median Effect Equation of Chou (35Chou T.C. Cancer Res. 2010; 70: 440-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (3801) Google Scholar, 36Chou T.C. Talalay P. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1984; 22: 27-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6008) Google Scholar). In this equation, fa/fu = (D/Dm)m, where fa is the fraction of a process that is affected, fu is the fraction that is unaffected, D is the concentration of a compound that is required to produce the effect fa, and Dm is the concentration at which there is 50% effect. Plots of log fa/fu with respect to log D are linear and a simple computer program permits determination of goodness of fit to linearity, the linear correlation coefficient, and the slope (Hill coefficient) of the lines. Application of this procedure to the increase (induction) of NQO1 have been described (37Liu H. Dinkova-Kostova A.T. Talalay P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 15926-15931Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting was performed as described (38Kelly V.P. Ellis E.M. Manson M.M. Chanas S.A. Moffat G.J. McLeod R. Judah D.J. Neal G.E. Hayes J.D. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 957-969PubMed Google Scholar). The antibodies against GSTA1 (1:5000 dilution), GSTM1 (1:2000 dilution), and GSTP1 (1:1000 dilution) were a gift from John D. Hayes (University of Dundee). The antibody against glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH, 1:5000 dilution) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co (Poole, Dorset, UK) and was used as a loading control. Recombinant murine Keap1 was expressed and purified as described (3Dinkova-Kostova A.T. Holtzclaw W.D. Cole R.N. Itoh K. Wakabayashi N. Katoh Y. Yamamoto M. Talalay P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 11908-11913Crossref PubMed Scopus (1615) Google Scholar). Two microliters of TBE-31 (dissolved in acetonitrile) were added to 200 μl of 20 mm Tris·HCl/0.005% Tween 20, pH 8.0, (final concentration of TBE, 50 μm). The UV-VIS spectrum was recorded by using a double-beam spectrophotometer (Cary 4000, Varian). The spectrum was recorded again after the same amount of TBE-31 was added to buffer which also contained either Keap1 (final concentration 10 μm) or DTT (final concentration 100 μm) against a Keap1 buffer blank or a DTT buffer blank, respectively. Similar experiments were performed with MCE-1 and MCE-5 (final concentration 100 μm) in place of TBE-31. For determination of the reaction stoichiometry, TBE-31 was titrated in 5-μl aliquots into 8 μm Keap1 in the same buffer in a final volume of 500 μl. AREc32 cells (1.2 × 104 per well) were grown in 96-well plates. After 24 h, the culture media were replaced with fresh DMEM media containing the compounds at three different concentrations, each in triplicate. Twenty-four hours later, cells were lysed, and the firefly luciferase activity was measured after addition of Luciferase Assay Reagent (Promega) as described (39Wang X.J. Hayes J.D. Wolf C.R. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 10983-10994Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) using a luminometer (Turner Designs Model TD-20/20, Promega). Control cells were treated with acetonitrile (final concentration 0.1%, v/v). All values are means ± 1 S.D. The differences between groups were determined by Student's t test with Dunnett's correction for multiple comparisons. To evaluate the inducer potency of the acetylenic tricyclic bis(cyano enone), TBE-31 (Fig. 1) in vivo, we applied three topical doses of small quantities (0.03, 0.1, or 0.3 μmol per application) of TBE-31 at 24-h intervals to the dorsal skin of hairless but immunocompetent SKH-1 mice (n = 3). These applications led to a robust, highly statistically significant, and dose-dependent induction of the cytosolic dicoumarol-sensitive NQO1 activity (with menadione as a substrate) by 3.5-, 4.2-, and 4.9-fold, respectively, in the underlying skin (Fig. 2A). Similarly, by using 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) as a substrate, a small, but significant induction in glutathione transferase (GST) activity was also found, by 1.3-, 1.5-, and 1.5-fold, respectively (Fig. 2B). Oral administration of 0.1 μmol (9.2 μg per g of diet, low-dose) or 0.3 μmol (high-dose) of TBE-31 per mouse per day for 11 days also resulted in a dose-dependent increase in NQO1 in three of four tissues (liver, stomach, skin, and cerebral cortex) examined. Importantly, no signs of toxicity were observed at either of these doses of TBE-31 as judged by similarity of body weights and behavior of the animals in all groups. Hepatic NQO1 increased by 2.4- and 3.5-fold with the low and the high oral doses of TBE-31, respectively (Fig. 3A). Remarkably, a virtually identical degree of induction was observed in skin, i.e. by 2.2- and 3.5-fold, indicating that even after oral intake, significant amounts of TBE-31 reached and exerted profound biological effects on the skin. The highest basal levels of NQO1 (∼20-fold higher than in the other organs examined) were in stomach; induction was also most robust in this organ, by 3.8- (low-dose) and 4.5-fold (high-dose). In contrast, no changes were observed in cerebral cortex, in agreement with the exceedingly low levels of TBE-31 detected in brain of CD-1 mice after a single oral dose (29Liby K. Yore M.M. Roebuck B.D. Baumgartner K.J. Honda T. Sundararajan C. Yoshizawa H. Gribble G.W. Williams C.R. Risingsong R. Royce D.B. Dinkova-Kostova A.T. Stephenson K.K. Egner P.A. Yates M.S. Groopman J.D. Kensler T.W. Sporn M.B. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 6727-6733Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), suggesting that TBE-31 is being excluded by the blood-brain barrier. Coordinately with NQO1, the glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity was also induced in liver, skin and stomach, but not in brain (Fig. 3B). Again, the highest level of induction was in stomach, by 3.5- and 5-fold with the low and the high doses of TBE-31, respectively. Hepatic GST activity was increased by 2.4- and 3.7-fold. In close agreement with the enzyme activity data, the protein levels of GSTA1, GSTM1, and GSTP1 isoforms were markedly and dose-dependently increased in liver and stomach (Fig. 3C). Band densitometric quantification showed that the low dose of TBE-31 elevated hepatic GSTA1, GSTM1, and GSTP1 by 1.4-, 1.6-, and 2.2-fold, respectively; the corresponding increases by the high dose of the compound were 1.7-, 1.9-, and 3.6-fold, respectively. In stomach, the low dose of TBE-31 induced GSTA1, GSTM1, and GSTP1 by 2.2-, 2.4-, and 2.3-fold, and the high dose by 2.4-, 3.3-, and 3.0-fold, respectively.FIGURE 3Induction of cytoprotective enzymes in vivo by dietary administration of TBE-31. Three groups of SKH-1 hairless mice (n = 4 per group) were placed on either control diet or diet containing TBE-31. Group 1 received the control diet, Group 2 was fed the low-dose (0.1 μmol/3 g diet), and Group 3, the high-dose (0.3 μmol/3 g diet) TBE-31 containing diet. After 11 days of feeding, the animals were euthanized, and the specific activities of NQO1 (A) and GST (B) were determined in cytosols from liver, skin, stomach, and cerebral cortex. Means ± S.D. are shown. p < 0.01 (*), p < 0.001 (**), p < 0.0001 (***). C, Western blots for GSTA1, GSTM1, and GSTP1 in which aliquots from liver or stomach cytosols (100,000 × g supernatant fractions) from each animal were resolved by SDS/PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P before being probed with the specific antibodies. Equal loading was confirmed by probing the blots with an antibody against GAPDH.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Three Michael acceptor-containing Monocyclic Cyano Enones (MCE) (Fig. 1) were designed and synthesized, i.e. MCE-1 [(±)-3-ethynyl-3-methyl-6-oxocyclohexa-1,4-dienecarbonitrile], MCE-2 [3,3-dimethyl-6-oxocyclohexa-1,4-dienecarbonitrile], and MCE-5 [(3,3,5,5-tetramethyl-6-oxocyclohex-1-enecarbonitrile)] (30Honda T. David E. Mierke D.F. U.S. Patent WO 2010/011782 A1. 2010; (January, 28)Google Scholar). Their inducer potencies for NQO1 were evaluated and compared with the potencies of the isothiocyanate sulforaphane, the double Michael acceptor-containing tricyclic bis(cyano enone)s TBE-9 [(±)-(4bS,8aR,10aS)-4b,8,8,10a-tetramethyl-3,7-dioxo-3,4b,7,8,8a,9,10,10a-octahydrophenanthrene-2,6-dicarbonitrile] and TBE-31, and with the pentacyclic triterpenoids CDDO and TP-225. For these comparisons, we used the Median Effect Equation of Chou (35Chou T.C. Cancer Res. 2010; 70: 440-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (3801) Google Scholar, 36Chou T.C. Talalay P. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1984; 22: 27-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6008) Google Scholar) which leads to a linear transformation of all experimental dose-effect determinations and provides the Dm value, the concentration of inducer that produces a 50% effect. Notably, the hitherto widely used conventional method of expressing inducer potencies as the CD values (Concentration required to Double the specific activity of NQO1) and Dm values are mathematically equivalent. But since the Dm values are derived from all experimental determinations whereas CD values rely on interpolation between values near the midpoint of effectiveness, the Dm determinations are much more robust. This type of analysis showed that the tricyclic double Michael acceptor TBE-31 is an exceedingly potent induce"
https://openalex.org/W2046192271,"Little is known about how chaperones in the endoplasmic reticulum are organized into complexes to assist in the proper folding of secreted proteins. One notable exception is the complex of ERp57 and calnexin that functions as part the calnexin cycle to direct disulfide bond formation in N-glycoproteins. Here, we report three new complexes composed of the peptidyl prolyl cis-trans-isomerase cyclophilin B and any of the lectin chaperones: calnexin, calreticulin, or calmegin. The 1.7 Å crystal structure of cyclophilin with the proline-rich P-domain of calmegin reveals that binding is mediated by the same surface that binds ERp57. We used NMR titrations and mutagenesis to measure low micromolar binding of cyclophilin to all three lectin chaperones and identify essential interfacial residues. The immunosuppressant cyclosporin A did not affect complex formation, confirming the functional independence of the P-domain binding and proline isomerization sites of cyclophilin. Our results reveal the P-domain functions as a unique protein-protein interaction domain and implicate a peptidyl prolyl isomerase as a new element in the calnexin cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2016469998,"A balance sheet describing the integrated homeostasis of secretion, absorption, and surface movement of liquids on pulmonary surfaces has remained elusive. It remains unclear whether the alveolus exhibits an intra-alveolar ion/liquid transport physiology or whether it secretes ions/liquid that may communicate with airway surfaces. Studies employing isolated human alveolar type II (AT2) cells were utilized to investigate this question. Human AT2 cells exhibited both epithelial Na+ channel-mediated Na+ absorption and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator-mediated Cl− secretion, both significantly regulated by extracellular nucleotides. In addition, we observed in normal AT2 cells an absence of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator regulation of epithelial Na+ channel activity and an absence of expression/activity of reported calcium-activated chloride channels (TMEM16A, Bestrophin-1, ClC2, and SLC26A9), both features strikingly different from normal airway epithelial cells. Measurements of alveolar surface liquid volume revealed that normal AT2 cells: 1) achieved an extracellular nucleotide concentration-dependent steady state alveolar surface liquid height of ∼4 μm in vitro; 2) absorbed liquid when the lumen was flooded; and 3) secreted liquid when treated with UTP or forskolin or subjected to cyclic compressive stresses mimicking tidal breathing.

Experiments in wild-type mice and the ex vivo human lungs demonstrated that liquid absorption was inhibited by glibenclamide, suggesting a role for CFTR-dependent Cl− absorption (13Fang X. Fukuda N. Barbry P. Sartori C. Verkman A.S. Matthay M.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 119: 199-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 14Fang X. Song Y. Hirsch J. Galietta L.J. Pedemonte N. Zemans R.L.

Moreover, both liquid absorption and Cl− uptake from the distal airspace were stimulated by β-agonists in wild-type mice but not in ΔF508 CFTR mutant mice (16Lindert J. Perlman C.E. Parthasarathi K. Bhattacharya J. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2007; 36: 688-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In contrast, evidence for alveolar liquid secretion was demonstrated by confocal microscopy in mice, which was blunted by the CFTR inhibitor (CFTRinh-172) and was absent in CFTR(−/−) mice, suggesting that the murine alveolar epithelium secrete liquid via CFTR. Thus, a challenge remains to understand the relative roles of CFTR-mediated Cl− absorption versus secretion within the alveolar space. Coordinate regulation of Na+ absorption and Cl− secretion in airway epithelia is mediated in part via the concentrations of nucleotides/nucleosides in the luminal extracellular compartment (17Tarran R. Trout L. Donaldson S.H. Boucher R.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2006; 127: 591-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). For example, ATP mediates regulatory responses via P2Y2 receptor stimulation, and ATP metabolism provides a source of adenosine for stimulation of the A2b adenosine receptor (18Button B. Picher M.

Recently, the mechanical stresses associated with tidal breathing have been shown to stimulate luminal nucleotide release from airway epithelial cells, providing a link between local stresses and regulation of airway surface liquid (ASL) volume (21Button B. Boucher R.C. Respir. Physiol. Neurobiol. 2008; 163: 189-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Similarly, purinergic signaling may contribute to the integrated control of ion/liquid homeostasis within the alveolar space. Nucleotide receptors and adenosine receptors (12Factor P. Mutlu G.M.

Whether a role for nucleotide release in response to the mechanical stresses of tidal breathing plays a role in regulating human alveolar liquid homeostasis is as yet unknown. In this study, we investigated the regulation of alveolar surface liquid (AvSL) volume, utilizing in vitro techniques. First, we identified the pathways that mediate Na+ absorption and Cl− secretion with electrophysiologic techniques in cultured normal human AT2 cells. Second, we studied the integrated functions of ion transport via measuring the volume of the AvSL produced by cultured normal human AT2 cells under basal and stimulated conditions with confocal microscopy. Normal lungs rejected for transplant by local and distant organ procurement agencies received by the University of North Carolina Cystic Fibrosis Center Tissue Culture Core were studied following protocols approved by the University of North Carolina Institutional Review Board. Human AT2 cells were isolated as previously described with slight modifications (25Dobbs L.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: L134-L147PubMed Google Scholar, 26Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar). The right middle lobe was selected, cannulated through the main stem bronchus, and removed from the rest of the lung. The distal airspaces were lavaged 10 times using a Ca2+- and Mg2+-free solution containing 0.5 mm EGTA (Sigma), 140 mm NaCl (Fisher), 5 mm KCl (Sigma), 2.5 mm Na2HPO4 (Fisher), 10 mm HEPES (Sigma), and 6 mm glucose (Sigma) and then lavaged three times using the solution above with no glucose but adding 2.0 mm CaCl2 (Sigma) and 1.3 mm MgSO4 (Sigma). Elastase (Worthington, Lakewood, NJ), 13 units/ml in the Ca2+- and Mg2+-containing solution above, was instilled into the distal airspaces, and the lobe was incubated at 37 °C for 45 min. Following digestion, the lobe was minced finely in the presence of 5% FBS (Atlanta Biological, Lawrenceville, GA) and DNase (Sigma) at 500 μg/ml. The suspension was filtered sequentially through two layers of sterile gauze, followed by filtration through 150- and 40-μm sterile nylon meshes (Small Parts, Miramar, FL). The filtrate was spun at 130 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The cell pellet was resuspended in DMEM plus 10% FBS and decanted onto PBS- and DMEM-rinsed Petri dishes coated with a human IgG antibody (500 μg/ml in Tris buffer, pH 9.5) (Sigma) against macrophages for 90 min at 37 °C. The nonadherent AT2 cells were collected, spun at 130 × g for 10 min, and resuspended in DMEM plus 10% FBS. The final AT2 suspension was seeded on rat tail collagen I-coated (250 μg/ml; Sigma) 1.12-cm2 inserts (Fisher; Corning 3460), in 5% CO2 at 37 °C at a concentration of 1.0 × 106 cells/insert. The cells were maintained in DMEM, 10% FBS with penicillin, streptomycin, gentamicin, and amphotericin. For the first 5 days of culture, the medium was supplemented with ceftazidime, tobramycin, and vancomycin (all cultures). The culture medium was changed 48 h after seeding. 72 h after isolation, the AT2 cells were washed once with PBS, and culture medium was added only to the basolateral side of the insert. All of the experiments were performed 4–9 days after seeding. Total RNA was extracted using TRI Reagent (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's protocol for every sample. Reverse transcription was performed using 2–5 μg of total RNA, and PCRs were performed using a GeneAmp PCR System 2,700 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). 40 cycles of PCR were performed. PCR products were resolved by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. The expression of all genes of interest was normalized to that of GAPDH. Primer sequences can be found in supplemental Table 1 (S1). Freshly isolated suspensions (cytospins), cultured human AT2 cells (on rat tail type-I collagen coated inserts), and mouse whole lung tissue were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, PBS for 5 min, permeabilized using 0.1% Triton X-100, PBS, and blocked in 2% BSA, PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100 for 1 h. The cells were probed with antibodies against the precursor form of surfactant protein C (proSP-C; Chemicon, Temecula, CA), AQP-3 (Chemicon), AQP-5 (Chemicon), or CFTR (J. Riordan, monoclonal antibody UNC 528) in 0.1% Triton X-100, PBS for 1 h at 37 °C (or overnight at 4 °C). Negative controls used species-specific IgG. The sample(s) were washed three times with PBS and then incubated with a secondary antibody (Alexa-Fluor 568 goat anti-mouse/rabbit) (Invitrogen) in 0.1% Triton X-100, PBS for 1 h at 37 °C in the dark. The cell nuclei were stained with either DAPI (Anaspec, Fremont, CA) or SYTOX® Green (Invitrogen), and the slides were washed, mounted, and imaged using confocal microscopy. Ussing chamber studies were performed on human AT2 cultures under basal conditions or after the addition of designated reagents under open circuit conditions (27Grubb B.R. Rogers T.D. Boucher R.C. Ostrowski L.E. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2009; 296: C1301-C1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Basal potential difference (PD) and changes in response to each added reagent were measured, and the equivalent short circuit (Ieq) was calculated as previously described (27Grubb B.R. Rogers T.D. Boucher R.C. Ostrowski L.E. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2009; 296: C1301-C1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 28Grubb B.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: G505-G513PubMed Google Scholar). The following agents were tested: amiloride (Sigma) (100 μm, luminal); forskolin (Sigma) (10 μm, luminal); UTP (GE Healthcare) (100 μm, luminal); ATP (GE Healthcare) (100 μm, luminal); adenosine (Sigma) (100 μm, luminal); UDP (Sigma), (100 μm, luminal); ionomycin (Sigma) (5 μm, luminal); or the CFTR inhibitor (CFTRinh-172; (10 μm, luminal). 5–9-Day-old cultures of normal AT2 cells were loaded with 2.5 μm fura-2/AM and basal Ca2+ levels, and Ca2+ mobilization in response to 100 μm UTP followed by ionomycin (10 μm) was measured by microfluorimetry in the presence of a HEPES-buffered saline solution containing 1.3 mm Ca2+, as previously described (29Ribeiro C.M.

The data are expressed as Δ340/380 (UTP-induced peak value − base-line value) fura-2 fluorescence. Real time basal ATP levels and release rates were performed as previously described (31Okada S.F.

Confluent AT2 cells with soluble luciferase (Sigma; L9506; 0.5–2.0 μg/culture) and luciferin (150 μm) added to the mucosal surface (90 μl) were gently placed in the Turner TD-20/20 luminometer. Luminescence was measured every minute until the ALU values reached steady state, the measure of basal concentrations. ATP release rates from resting AT2 cells were measured by monitoring ATP accumulation in real time after maximal inhibition of cell surface nucleotidase activities. The nucleotidase inhibitor mixture contained 300 μm β,γ-methylene-ATP, 30 μm ebselen, and 10 mm levamisole to inhibit ecto-nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterases, ecto-nucleotide triphosphate diphosphohydrolases, and nonspecific alkaline phosphatases. After the basal ATP concentration was recorded as described above, the inhibitor mixture was added to the mucosal liquid, and ATP concentrations were measured every minute. In selected experiments, forskolin (10 μm) was added during the release measurements. A standard curve for each experiment was also generated using a solution of ATP (GE Healthcare; 100 mm). AT2 cultures, under air-liquid interface conditions, were incubated with CellTraceTM Calcein Green, AM (3 μm; Invitrogen) for 20 min at 37 °C to stain live cells. The cells were washed with PBS, followed by apical addition of Texas Red-labeled 70-kDa dextran/PBS (2.5 mg/ml; Invitrogen) to measure AvSL height. For studies of basal AvSL regulation, 25 μl of Texas Red-labeled 70-kDa dextran, dextran, PBS, and perflurocarbon (50 μl) were added, and the cells were imaged immediately and serially for 24 h at five predetermined sites, as previously described (32Roomans G.M. Kozlova I. Nilsson H. Vanthanouvong V. Button B. Tarran R. J. Cyst. Fibros. 2004; 3: 135-139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Studies of forskolin or UTP were performed by incubating 25 μl of Texas Red-labeled 70-kDa dextran, PBS fluorophore on the cell surface for 30 min at 37 °C, followed by removal of excess dextran to initiate studies under steady state “thin film” conditions. The images were taken serially post-agonist addition with x-z confocal microscopy. In selected studies, apyrase (10 units/ml; Sigma) was added with the 70-kDa dextran, PBS solution for studies focused on: 1) control of basal AvSL height and 2) mechanisms of forskolin responses. For studies designed to measure inhibition of CFTR activity, the CFTR inhibitor (CFTRinh-172) was added to the 70-kDa dextran, PBS solution, and cultures were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, followed by the addition of forskolin or UTP. 25 μl of the Texas Red-labeled 70-kDa dextran, PBS fluorophore were added to the mucosal surface of AT2 cultures, and residual liquid was aspirated after 30 min, following which x-z confocal images were obtained at 0, 1, and 24 h under control conditions or under CCS (0–20 cmH2O), delivered by a published technique (21Button B. Boucher R.C. Respir. Physiol. Neurobiol. 2008; 163: 189-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). To explore the role of nucleotide release in CCS-mediated alveolar liquid responses, parallel AT2 cultures were treated with apyrase (10 units/ml; Sigma) in the 70-kDa dextran, PBS fluorophore for 30 min prior to the initiation of CCS. All of the experiments were performed in triplicate, and the cells were obtained from at least three different patient specimens. The data are presented as the means ± S.D., analyzed by one-way analysis of variance, and the differences were considered significant if p < 0.05 (*) and p < 0.01 (#). Following elastase digestion and filtration/enrichment, the purity of the final cell preparations was determined for human normal AT2 cells to be 91.7 ± 2.9% as assessed by immunostaining for proSP-C (normal; Fig. 1A, panel i). Freshly isolated cells also expressed other AT2 cell markers, including lamellar bodies imaged with the fluorescent probe Lysotracker® Green DND-26 (Lysotracker) (Fig. 1A, panel ii) and aquaporin-3 (AQP-3; Fig. 1A, panel iii), which was detected immunocytochemically. In contrast, preparations were negative for the AT1 cell marker aquaporin-5 (AQP-5; Fig. 1A, panel iv) (33Borok Z. Liebler J.M. Lubman R.L. Foster M.J. Zhou B. Li X. Zabski S.M. Kim K.J. Crandall E.D. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell Mol. Physiol. 2002; 282: L599-L608Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), as assessed by immunostaining. CFTR protein was detected in freshly isolated normal AT2 preparations by immunostaining/confocal microscopy (Fig. 1A, panel v). Normal human AT2 cells were seeded on rat tail type 1 collagen-coated polycarbonate filters and formed confluent monolayers within 96 h after seeding. Transepithelial resistance was 419.3 Ω*cm2 ± 168.1 at day 5 in culture (n > 3 different patient specimen codes). At day 5, the AT2 cell monolayers retained AT2-like features, as indexed by differential interference contrast microscopy (Fig. 1B, panel i), Lysotracker (Fig. 1B, panel ii), and proSP-C (Fig. 1B, panel iii) antibody immunostaining. To address the possibility that AT2 cells trans-differentiated in culture over time to an “AT1-like” cell phenotype, AT2 cells were probed over 14 days in culture with Lysotracker (Fig. 1B, panel iv), proSP-C (Fig. 1B, panel v), and AQP-5 antibodies (Fig. 1B, panel vi) and imaged by confocal microscopy. Cultures lost significant expression of the Lysotracker and pro-SPC with time. In contrast, AQP-5 expression increased, supporting the concept that AT2 trans-differentiation into AT1-like cells in culture has occurred by day 14. Human AT2 mRNA was isolated from fresh preparations and cells 2–14 days in culture, and RT-PCR was performed to characterize the expression of SP-C mRNA over time (Fig. 1C). Expression of SP-C decreased with time in culture. SP-A, AQP-3, and AQP-5 mRNA was analyzed at 5 and 14 days in culture by RT-PCR to more fully characterize the AT2 culture phenotype (Fig. 1D). Overall, these studies confirmed the reduction of AT2 markers (SP-A, SP-C, and AQP-3) and revealed the appearance of an AT1 marker (AQP-5) over time in our cultures. Therefore, all of the experiments within this study were performed on AT2 cultures 4–9 days after seeding. To identify which sodium channels/subunits were expressed in human AT2 cells, semi-quantitative PCR analysis was performed on mRNA from freshly isolated and AT2 cells 5 or 14 days in culture. The α, β, and γ subunits of ENaC were expressed at all time points; however, no expression of the δ subunit was detected (Fig. 2A). With respect to other electrogenic Na+ transporters, expression of the glucose-sodium transporter-2 (GLUT2/SLC2A2) was detected but not the glucose-sodium transporter-1 (GLUT1/SLC2A1) gene. In addition, mRNA expression of the α-cyclic nucleotide-gated Na+ channels (α-CNG1–3) was detected, but no expression was observed of the β-CNG1 in AT2 cultures. Bioelectric measurements of normal and CF AT2 cultures revealed small inhibitory responses (<5%) to the glucose-sodium transporter inhibitor (phloridzin) or the cyclic nucleotide-gated sodium channel inhibitor (diltiazem) (<5%), suggesting that Na+ transport in human AT2 cells is primarily mediated by ENaC. Therefore, we initiated experiments to further characterize ENaC-mediated Na+ absorption in human AT2 cultures. To measure basal ENaC-mediated Na+ absorption, normal human AT2 cells were treated with amiloride (100 μm), and the change in PD was measured (Fig. 2B). The basal equivalent short circuit current (Ieq) and the post-amiloride-sensitive Ieq values were 7.69 ± 1.9 and 3.11 ± 0.52 μA/cm2, respectively (Fig. 2C), suggesting that Na+ absorption (Δamiloride Ieq = 4.58 μA/cm2) is the dominant basal ion transport process. An amiloride dose-response curve for normal AT2 cultures revealed an IC50 of ∼5 × 10−7 m (Fig. 2D). Because agents that raise cellular cAMP levels increase Na+ absorptive rates in mouse and rat AT2 cells (34Lazrak A. Nielsen V.G. Matalon S. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell Mol. Physiol. 2000; 278: L233-L238Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), similar protocols were performed in human AT2 cells. Normal human AT2 cultures exposed to forskolin (10 μm) exhibited a rapid spike, followed by a slow gradual increase in PD that was inhibited by amiloride (Fig. 2E). The mean increase in Na+ absorption stimulated by forskolin was ∼6 μA·cm2. We first characterized cAMP-regulated/CFTR-mediated Cl− secretion in AT2 cells in Ussing chambers. Normal human AT2 cultures were treated with CFTRinh-172 (10 μm), a CFTR inhibitor (35Thiagarajah J.R. Song Y. Haggie P.M. Verkman A.S. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 875-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), to measure the contribution of CFTR to basal Ieq, followed by exposure to amiloride (Fig. 3A). The change in Ieq in response to CFTRinh-172 was small, ∼0.4 μA/cm2, suggesting that normal AT2 cells exhibit only a small rate of CFTR-mediated Cl− secretion under basal conditions (Fig. 3B). To assess the capacity of CFTR to accelerate Cl− secretion, human normal AT2 cultures were treated with forskolin in the presence of amiloride. Forskolin induced a rapid increase in the potential difference in AT2 cultures (Fig. 3C), consistent with anion (Cl−) secretion. The acute anion secretory effects of forskolin were significantly blocked in normal AT2 cells pretreated with CFTRinh-172 (Fig. 3D). These results suggest that forskolin-stimulated Cl− secretion in amiloride-pretreated normal AT2 cells is predominantly mediated via CFTR. We next measured [Ca2+]i-regulated Cl− secretion in human AT2 cells. There was little change in basal Ieq in response to putative Ca2+-activated chloride channel (CaCC) antagonists, e.g. DIDS or niflumic acid (data not shown). Increases in Ieq were observed when normal AT2 cultures were treated with the Ca2+ ionophore, ionomycin, in the presence of amiloride (Fig. 4A). DIDS or niflumic acid (general inhibitors of Ca2+-activated chloride channels) did not block the ionomycin-induced currents in normal AT2 cultures (data not shown). Surprisingly, the acute response to ionomycin was significantly inhibited in normal AT2 cultures pretreated with CFTRinh-172 (Fig. 4A). These data indicate that CFTR mediates [Ca2+]i-regulated anion secretion in normal human AT2 cells. We performed two further sets of experiments to explore the hypothesis that CFTR indeed mediated Ca2+-regulated chloride secretion. First, we confirmed that ionomycin indeed raised intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) similarly in normal human AT2 cells (Fig. 4B). Second, we performed semi-quantitative PCR analysis in freshly isolated, day 5 and 14 AT2 cells to identify expression of candidate Ca2+-regulated Cl− channels (Fig. 4C). CFTR was expressed, but no mRNA expression of TMEM16A, CLC2, or SLC26A9 was detected in AT2 cells. Moreover, no full-length Bestrophin-1 mRNA expression was detected. Collectively, these data suggest that AT2 cells secrete Cl− via CFTR in response to [Ca2+]i signaling in the absence of known CaCC channel expression. Luminal extracellular mediators, e.g. triphosphate nucleotides (UTP or ATP) and the adenine nucleoside, adenosine, have been shown to inhibit Na+ transpo"
https://openalex.org/W1987477158,"Nesprins and emerin are structural nuclear envelope proteins that tether nuclei to the cytoskeleton. In this work, we identified the cytoskeleton-associated α-N/E-catenins as novel nesprin-2-binding partners. The association involves the C termini of nesprin-2 giant and α-N/E-catenins. α-E/T/N-catenins are known primarily for their roles in cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion. Here, we show that, in addition, α-catenin forms complexes with nesprin-2 that include β-catenin and emerin. We demonstrate that the depletion of nesprin-2 reduces both the amount of active β-catenin inside the nucleus and T-cell factor/lymphoid-enhancing factor-dependent transcription. Taken together, these findings suggest novel nesprin-2 functions in cellular signaling. Moreover, we propose that, in contrast to emerin, nesprin-2 is a positive regulator of the Wnt signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2025732015,"Heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) is an important transcription factor in cellular stress responses, cancer, aging, and developmental processes including gametogenesis. Disruption of Hsf1, together with another HSF family member, Hsf2, causes male sterility and complete lack of mature sperm in mice, but the specific role of HSF1 in spermatogenesis has remained unclear. Here, we show that HSF1 is transiently expressed in meiotic spermatocytes and haploid round spermatids in mouse testis. The Hsf1(-/-) male mice displayed regions of seminiferous tubules containing only spermatogonia and increased morphological abnormalities in sperm heads. In search for HSF1 target genes, we identified 742 putative promoters in mouse testis. Among them, the sex chromosomal multicopy genes that are expressed in postmeiotic cells were occupied by HSF1. Given that the sex chromatin mostly is repressed during and after meiosis, it is remarkable that HSF1 directly regulates the transcription of sex-linked multicopy genes during postmeiotic repression. In addition, our results show that HSF1 localizes to the sex body prior to the meiotic divisions and to the sex chromocenter after completed meiosis. To the best of our knowledge, HSF1 is the first known transcription factor found at the repressed sex chromatin during meiosis."
https://openalex.org/W2149137645,"Welding generates complex metal aerosols, inhalation of which is linked to adverse health effects among welders. An important health concern of welding fume (WF) exposure is neurological dysfunction akin to Parkinson's disease (PD), thought to be mediated by manganese (Mn) in the fumes. Also, there is a proposition that welding might accelerate the onset of PD. Our recent findings link the presence of Mn in the WF with dopaminergic neurotoxicity seen in rats exposed to manual metal arc-hard surfacing (MMA-HS) or gas metal arc-mild steel (GMA-MS) fumes. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms further, we investigated the association of PD-linked (Park) genes and mitochondrial function in causing dopaminergic abnormality. Repeated instillations of the two fumes at doses that mimic ∼1 to 5 yr of worker exposure resulted in selective brain accumulation of Mn. This accumulation caused impairment of mitochondrial function and loss of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) protein, indicative of dopaminergic injury. A fascinating finding was the altered expression of Parkin (Park2), Uchl1 (Park5), and Dj1 (Park7) proteins in dopaminergic brain areas. A similar regimen of manganese chloride (MnCl(2)) also caused extensive loss of striatal TH, mitochondrial electron transport components, and Park proteins. As mutations in PARK genes have been linked to early-onset PD in humans, and because welding is implicated as a risk factor for parkinsonism, PARK genes might play a critical role in WF-mediated dopaminergic dysfunction. Whether these molecular alterations culminate in neurobehavioral and neuropathological deficits reminiscent of PD remains to be ascertained."
https://openalex.org/W2046699036,"Leishmania parasites use polymorphonuclear neutrophils as intermediate hosts before their ultimate delivery to macrophages following engulfment of parasite-infected neutrophils. This leads to a silent and unrecognized entry of Leishmania into the macrophage host cell. Neutrophil function depends on its cytoplasmic granules, but their mobilization and role in how Leishmania parasites evade intracellular killing in neutrophils remain undetermined. Here, we have found by ultrastructural approaches that neutrophils ingested Leishmania major promastigotes, and azurophilic granules fused in a preferential way with parasite-containing phagosomes, without promoting parasite killing. Azurophilic granules, identified by the granule marker myeloperoxidase, also fused with Leishmania donovani-engulfed vacuoles in human neutrophils. In addition, the azurophilic membrane marker CD63 was also detected in the vacuole surrounding the parasite, and in the fusion of azurophilic granules with the parasite-engulfed phagosome. Tertiary and specific granules, involved in vacuole acidification and superoxide anion generation, hardly fused with Leishmania-containing phagosomes. L. major interaction with neutrophils did not elicit production of reactive oxygen species or mobilization of tertiary and specific granules. By using immunogold electron microscopy approaches in the engulfment of L. major and L. donovani by human neutrophils, we did not find a significant contribution of endoplasmic reticulum to the formation of Leishmania-containing vacuoles. Live Leishmania parasites were required to be optimally internalized by neutrophils. Our data suggest that Leishmania promastigotes modulate their uptake by neutrophils, and regulate granule fusion processes in a rather selective way to favor parasite survival in human neutrophils."
https://openalex.org/W2114602831,"Endocytosis is a conserved cellular process in which nutrients, lipids, and receptors are internalized and transported to early endosomes, where they are sorted and either channeled to degradative pathways or recycled to the plasma membrane. MICAL-L1 and EHD1 are important regulatory proteins that control key endocytic transport steps. However, the precise mechanisms by which they mediate transport, and particularly the mode by which they connect to motor proteins, have remained enigmatic. Here we have identified the collapsin response mediator protein-2 (Crmp2) as an interaction partner of MICAL-L1 in non-neuronal cells. Crmp2 interacts with tubulin dimers and kinesin and negatively regulates dynein-based transport in neuronal cells, but its expression and function in non-neuronal cells have remained poorly characterized. Upon Crmp2 depletion, we observed dramatic relocalization of internalized transferrin (Tf) from peripheral vesicles to the endocytic recycling compartment (ERC), similar to the effect of depleting either MICAL-L1 or EHD1. Moreover, Tf relocalization to the ERC could be inhibited by interfering with microtubule polymerization, consistent with a role for uncoupled motor protein-based transport upon depletion of Crmp2, MICAL-L1, or EHD1. Finally, transfection of dynamitin, a component of the dynactin complex whose overexpression inhibits dynein activity, prevented the relocalization of internalized Tf to the ERC upon depletion of Crmp2, MICAL-L1, or EHD1. These data provide the first trafficking regulatory role for Crmp2 in non-neuronal cells and support a model in which Crmp2 is an important endocytic regulatory protein that links MICAL-L1·EHD1-based vesicular transport to dynein motors. Endocytosis is a conserved cellular process in which nutrients, lipids, and receptors are internalized and transported to early endosomes, where they are sorted and either channeled to degradative pathways or recycled to the plasma membrane. MICAL-L1 and EHD1 are important regulatory proteins that control key endocytic transport steps. However, the precise mechanisms by which they mediate transport, and particularly the mode by which they connect to motor proteins, have remained enigmatic. Here we have identified the collapsin response mediator protein-2 (Crmp2) as an interaction partner of MICAL-L1 in non-neuronal cells. Crmp2 interacts with tubulin dimers and kinesin and negatively regulates dynein-based transport in neuronal cells, but its expression and function in non-neuronal cells have remained poorly characterized.

Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 3381-3392Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Moreover, EHD proteins coordinate endocytic transport with Rab proteins through their interactions with common effectors that contain such NPF motifs (9Naslavsky N. Rahajeng J. Sharma M. Jovic M.

Cell. 2004; 15: 2410-2422Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). More recently, it was demonstrated that EHD1 interacts with the NPF-containing MICAL family protein, MICAL-L1, a Rab8 effector that localizes to EHD1-containing tubules and regulates endocytic transport and recycling (16Sharma M.

Cell. 2007; 18: 4129-4142Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), but to date, the mode by which EHD proteins are connected to dynein remains unknown. Here we identify the collapsin response mediator protein-2 (Crmp2) as a novel interaction partner of MICAL-L1 and demonstrate its function in the regulation of endocytic transport in non-neuronal cells, where it serves as a critical link between MICAL-L1·EHD1 vesicles and dynein motors. Crmp2 cDNA was obtained from a human brain cDNA library and cloned into a pHA-CMV vector (Clontech). siRNA-resistant HA-Crmp2 was generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), to produce a series of “silent mutations” within the regions recognized by the four oligonucleotides (Dharmacon). GFP-MICAL-L1 has been described previously (Sharma et al. (16Sharma M. Giridharan S.S. Rahajeng J. Naslavsky N. Caplan S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 5181-5194Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar)). MICAL-L1 CH and LIM domains were subcloned into pGEX-6p-2 vector (GE Healthcare). p50 dynamitin-GFP was kindly provided by Dr. Julie Donaldson. Custom design oligonucleotide duplexes targeting human EHD1 (Naslavsky et al. (15Naslavsky N. Boehm M. Backlund Jr., P.S. Caplan S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2410-2422Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar)) and ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool siRNA targeting MICAL-L1 and Crmp2 (Dharmacon) were transfected for 72 h using Dharmafect (Dharmacon) as described previously (16Sharma M. Giridharan S.S. Rahajeng J. Naslavsky N. Caplan S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 5181-5194Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The following antibodies and reagents were used in this study: mouse anti-Crmp2 antibody clone C4G (American Research Products), mouse polyclonal anti-MICAL-L1 antibody (Novus Biologicals), mouse anti-α-tubulin antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), mouse anti-human HLA-A, -B, and -C antibody (Leinco Technologies, Inc.), mouse anti-CD59 antibody (a kind gift from Dr. Vaclav Horejsi), mouse anti-HA antibody (Covance), mouse anti-GFP antibody (Roche Applied Science), rabbit anti-HA (Bethyl Laboratories, Inc.), Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Molecular Probes), Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Molecular Probes), Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Molecular Probes), horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.), Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated human transferrin (Invitrogen), and nocodazole (LKT Laboratories, Inc.). HeLa cells were grown on coverslips, transfected with FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science), and fixed with 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde as described previously (16Sharma M. Giridharan S.S. Rahajeng J. Naslavsky N. Caplan S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 5181-5194Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In some cases, cytosolic proteins were extracted by treatment for 1 min with 0.05% w/v saponin before fixation. Cells were immunostained as described (16Sharma M. Giridharan S.S. Rahajeng J. Naslavsky N. Caplan S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 5181-5194Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), and images were obtained using an LSM5 Pascal confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss) with a 63× 1.4 numerical aperture objective with appropriate filters. Transferrin uptake experiments were done essentially as described (16Sharma M. Giridharan S.S. Rahajeng J. Naslavsky N. Caplan S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 5181-5194Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). CD59 and major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I) uptake was performed in complete medium (DMEM plus serum) at 37 °C for either 15 min or 30 min, respectively, prior to acid rinse (0.5% acetic acid and 0.5 m NaCl, pH 3.0) for 1 min. Cells were fixed and immunostained with the appropriate fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibody. GST-MICAL-L1 CH and LIM domains and GST constructs were purified and utilized for pulldown experiments as described previously (16Sharma M. Giridharan S.S. Rahajeng J. Naslavsky N. Caplan S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 5181-5194Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). To identify potential links between the MICAL-L1·EHD1-based endocytic regulatory proteins and motor proteins, we generated a purified GST-MICAL-L1 protein (supplemental Fig. S1A) containing both the CH and the LIM domains to perform pulldown assays using homogenized bovine brain cytosol. Upon elution, specific bands from Coomassie Blue-stained gels were excised and subjected to the University of Nebraska Medical Center Mass Spectrometry and Proteomics Core Facility for identification using the LTQ Orbitrap. MASCOT search analysis yielded Crmp2 as a potential interaction partner. In neuronal cells, Crmp2 expression is required for axon outgrowth and axon-dendrite specification (23Arimura N. Menager C. Fukata Y. Kaibuchi K. J. Neurobiol. 2004; 58: 34-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Crmp2 has multiple binding domains, including a dihydropyrimidinase (DHPase) homology domain, a tubulin binding domain, a kinesin light chain-1 (KLC-1) binding domain, and two dynein heavy chain binding regions (24Arimura N. Hattori A. Kimura T. Nakamuta S. Funahashi Y. Hirotsune S. Furuta K. Urano T. Toyoshima Y.Y. Kaibuchi K. J. Neurochem. 2009; 111: 380-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S1B). We have demonstrated that Crmp2 is not only expressed in neuronal cell lines such as SK-N-MC but also in a variety of non-neuronal cell lines (supplemental Fig. S1C). To confirm MICAL-L1 binding to Crmp2, pulldown assays were done using GST-MICAL-L1 CH and LIM domains, and Crmp2 antibodies were utilized for immunoblotting. As shown, GST-MICAL-L1 CH and LIM domains pulled-down Crmp2, whereas the negative control (GST protein only) did not (Fig. 1A). To determine whether this interaction could be detected in lysates from non-neuronal cells, we transfected HeLa cells with HA-Crmp2 along with either GFP-MICAL-L1 or GFP-lgp120 (a lysosomal protein and negative control) and performed co-immunoprecipitation assays. As demonstrated, HA-Crmp2 interacted with GFP-MICAL-L1 but not with GFP-lgp120 (Fig. 1B). We next hypothesized that if the Crmp2-MICAL-L1 interaction is functionally significant, we would anticipate a level of co-localization between the two proteins in cells. Unfortunately, available Crmp2 antibodies were not useful for immunofluorescence experiments, necessitating the overexpression of a tagged version of Crmp2. Initial co-staining experiments determined that overexpressed Crmp2 was largely cytosolic, complicating attempts to gauge its co-localization with the endogenous MICAL-L1. We have previously shown that upon overexpression of certain proteins, their high levels in the cytoplasm can often mask an association with underlying membrane structures, and non-membrane-associated proteins can be removed by a brief cytosolic extraction (25Caplan S. Hartnell L.M. Aguilar R.C. Naslavsky N. Bonifacino J.S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 109-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Upon cytosol extraction, HA-Crmp2 was visualized in a partial co-localization with microtubules (supplemental Fig. S2, A–C), consistent with its known interaction with α-tubulin (26Gu Y. Ihara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17917-17920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). To further validate these findings, we employed nocodazole to induce microtubule depolymerization prior to immunostaining (supplemental Fig. S2, D–F). As observed (arrows), a large number of punctae were positive for both Crmp2 and α-tubulin, providing additional evidence of their co-localization. In addition, HA-Crmp2 also displayed a small degree of overlap with MICAL-L1 on tubular membranes (supplemental Fig. S2, G–I) and punctae (supplemental Fig. S2, J–L, arrows), suggesting that a transient interaction between these two proteins may have a significant role in non-neuronal cells. To investigate the functional role of Crmp2 and its interaction with MICAL-L1 in non-neuronal cells, we depleted Crmp2 with siRNA oligonucleotides. We observed that less than 10% of endogenous Crmp2 remained upon Crmp2-siRNA treatment, and the knockdown was specific as scrambled-siRNA oligonucleotides had no impact on Crmp2 expression levels (supplemental Fig. S3A). We then performed transferrin (Tf) uptake assays on mock- and Crmp2-siRNA-treated cells expressing GFP-Rab11 to mark recycling endosomes and the ERC, a tubulo-vesicular network of recycling endosomes localized to the perinuclear region of the cell (27Maxfield F.R. McGraw T.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1494) Google Scholar). As observed after 5 min of uptake, in mock-treated cells, internalized fluorochrome-labeled transferrin (Tf-568) was still localized primarily to peripheral vesicles and endosomes, with very little Tf-568 having arrived at the perinuclear ERC (Fig. 2, A–C). However, in cells depleted of endogenous Crmp2, MICAL-L1, or EHD1, internalized Tf-568 rapidly reached and accumulated at the ERC region (Fig. 2, D–L). To ensure the specificity of Crmp2 deletion and that the changes in Tf transport were not due to off-target effects, we designed an siRNA-resistant Crmp2 construct. As demonstrated, this Crmp2 construct was highly expressed even in the presence of Crmp2-siRNA (supplemental Fig. S3B). Importantly, when Crmp2 was reintroduced into cells depleted of endogenous Crmp2, internalized Tf-568 no longer rapidly translocated to the ERC (supplemental Fig. S3, C–H; compare Crmp2-transfected cells (yellow dashed border) with untransfected cells in F). Moreover, the rapid transport of internalized receptors to the ERC upon Crmp2 depletion was a general phenomenon that also included proteins internalized via clathrin-independent pathways, such as CD59 (Fig. 2, M–P, see co-localization with Rab11 at the ERC in cells outlined by dashed borders) and MHC I (Fig. 2, Q–T, see co-localization with Rab11 at the ERC in cells outlined by dashed borders). These data suggest a novel role for Crmp2 in partnership with MICAL-L1 and EHD1 in regulating the transport of internalized cargo from early endosomes to the ERC. Intriguing new studies have demonstrated that Crmp2 is a modulator of microtubule dynamics (26Gu Y. Ihara Y. J. Biol.

Neurochem. 2005; 93: 1371-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Based on our observations that the depletion of Crmp2, its interaction partner MICAL-L1, or EHD1 (which binds to MICAL-L1) affects Tf-568 intracellular transport, we hypothesized that Crmp2 might serve as a link between MICAL-L1·EHD1-based endocytic transport and dynein-based movement to the ERC along microtubules. Because dynein transports vesicles along microtubules, initially we determined whether intact microtubules are required for this rapid translocation of Tf to the ERC. The microtubule depolymerizing agent, nocodazole, was added to HeLa cells that were mock-treated or treated with Crmp2-siRNA, MICAL-L1-siRNA, or EHD1-siRNA (Fig. 3). Efficacy of microtubule depolymerization was demonstrated by anti-tubulin staining (data not shown). After 5 min of Tf-568 uptake, as expected in mock-treated cells, most of the Tf-568 was localized to the periphery of the cells, either in the absence or in the presence of nocodazole (Fig. 3, A and E). Upon siRNA treatment in the absence of nocodazole, Tf-568 accumulated at the ERC (Fig. 3, B–D). However, in the presence of nocodazole, the siRNA-treated cells exhibited an entirely peripheral distribution of internalized TF-568, with no accumulation at the ERC (Fig. 3, F–H). To test the idea that Crmp2 serves as a link between MICAL-L1·EHD1-based endocytic transport and dynein-based movement to the ERC, we utilized dynamitin-GFP, a protein that comprises part of the dynactin complex connecting organelle membranes to motor proteins (32Valetti C. Wetzel D.M. Schrader M. Hasbani M.J. Gill S.R. Kreis T.E. Schroer T.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 4107-4120Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) and whose overexpression inhibits dynein. Dynamitin-GFP was transfected into HeLa cells that were mock-treated or treated with Crmp2-siRNA, MICAL-L1-siRNA, or EHD1-siRNA, and the cells were then subjected to a 5-min uptake of Tf-568. As expected, in mock-treated cells, internalized Tf-568 was mostly localized to the periphery, and this did not change upon dynamitin-GFP expression (Fig. 3, I–K, dashed borders). Consistent with our earlier results, cells depleted of Crmp2, MICAL-L1, or EHD1 showed a rapid accumulation of Tf-568 at the perinuclear ERC (Fig. 3, L–T). However, in depleted cells that were also expressing dynamitin-GFP, rapid accumulation of Tf-568 at the ERC was prevented (Fig. 3, L–T, cells outlined by dashed borders). These data suggest that Crmp2 may link MICAL-L1·EHD1-based vesicular transport to cytoplasmic dynein. To date, little is known about the mechanisms linking EHD1 and MICAL-L1 to cytoplasmic motor proteins that transport vesicles along microtubules. Here we have identified Crmp2 as a novel interaction partner of MICAL-L1. Although Crmp2 has been attributed a role in proliferation events in non-neuronal cells (33Tahimic C.G. Tomimatsu N. Nishigaki R. Fukuhara A. Toda T. Kaibuchi K. Shiota G. Oshimura M. Kurimasa A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 340: 1244-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), it has been characterized almost exclusively in neurons, where it regulates axonal growth and neuronal polarity (23Arimura N. Menager C. Fukata Y. Kaibuchi K. J. Neurobiol. 2004; 58: 34-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 34Inagaki N. Chihara K. Arimura N. Ménager C. Kawano Y. Matsuo N. Nishimura T. Amano M. Kaibuchi K. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 781-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Although Crmp2 has been described as a regulator of microtubule polymerization (29Fukata Y. Itoh T.J. Kimura T. Ménager C. Nishimura T. Shiromizu T. Watanabe H. Inagaki N. Iwamatsu A. Hotani H. Kaibuchi K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 583-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar) and a regulator of both kinesin and cytoplasmic dynein (24Arimura N. Hattori A. Kimura T. Nakamuta S. Funahashi Y. Hirotsune S. Furuta K. Urano T. Toyoshima Y.Y. Kaibuchi K. J. Neurochem. 2009; 111: 380-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 30Kawano Y. Yoshimura T. Tsuboi D. Kawabata S. Kaneko-Kawano T. Shirataki H.

Neurochem. 2005; 93: 1371-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), our study utilizing siRNA-based depletion of Crmp2 promotes a novel role for Crmp2 in coupling the MICAL-L1·EHD1 endocytic regulatory machinery with motor proteins, such as cytoplasmic dynein (Fig. 4). Remarkably, depletion of Crmp2 or either MICAL-L1 or EHD1 induces the same phenotype; internalized Tf is rapidly transported to the ERC, where it accumulates. Because Crmp2 is a negative regulator of dynein motors (24Arimura N. Hattori A. Kimura T. Nakamuta S. Funahashi Y. Hirotsune S. Furuta K. Urano T. Toyoshima Y.Y. Kaibuchi K. J. Neurochem. 2009; 111: 380-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), a likely explanation is that the interaction between MICAL-L1 and Crmp2 links MICAL-L1·EHD1-containing peripheral vesicles with dynein and microtubules, allowing slow, regulated transport to the ERC. Thus, in the absence of any of these three proteins, an uncoupling occurs that would allow dysregulation of dynein and rapid transport of peripheral vesicles along microtubules to the ERC. Moreover, under these conditions, when dynein is inhibited by dynamitin overexpression, rapid transport of Tf to the ERC is blocked, providing further support for the model in which Crmp2 links MICAL-L1·EHD1 endocytic transport to dynein motors. Although we have not observed altered Tf trafficking upon Crmp2 overexpression, 4J. Rahajeng, S. S. P. Giridharan, N. Naslavsky, and S. Caplan, unpublished observations. Arimura et al. (24Arimura N.

However, the mechanism of Ral GTPase activation in PDAC has not been determined. There are four highly related mammalian RalGEFs (RalGDS, Rgl1, Rgl2, and Rgl3) that can serve as Ras effectors. Whether or not they share distinct or overlapping functions in K-Ras-mediated growth transformation has not been explored. We found that plasma membrane targeting to mimic persistent Ras activation enhanced the growth-transforming activities of RalGEFs. Unexpectedly, transforming activity did not correlate directly with total cell steady-state levels of Ral activation. Next, we observed elevated Rgl2 expression in PDAC tumor tissue and cell lines. Expression of dominant negative Ral, which blocks RalGEF function, as well as interfering RNA suppression of Rgl2, reduced PDAC cell line steady-state Ral activity, growth in soft agar, and Matrigel invasion. Surprisingly, the effect of Rgl2 on anchorage-independent growth could not be rescued by constitutively activated RalA, suggesting a novel Ral-independent function for Rgl2 in transformation. Finally, we determined that Rgl2 and RalB both localized to the leading edge, and this localization of RalB was dependent on endogenous Rgl2 expression. In summary, our observations support nonredundant roles for RalGEFs in Ras-mediated oncogenesis and a key role for Rgl2 in Ral activation and Ral-independent PDAC growth."

Exposure to intratracheal allergens or IL-13 leads to excess mucus production as a result of Spdef-dependent goblet cell differentiation, whereas Spdef expression in transgenic bronchial epithelium causes goblet cell hyperplasia and mucus hypersecretion (17Park K.S.

Spdef−/− mice show defective differentiation of pulmonary goblet cells and intestinal Paneth and goblet cells, together with deregulation of secretory cell-specific genes (18Chen G. Korfhagen T.R.

Combinations of cell type-specific and broadly expressed transcription factors regulate each step, as highlighted in recent reports of the roles of transcription factors Foxq1 and Mist1 in specific aspects of gastric foveolar (pit) and corpus mucous neck cells, respectively (20Ramsey V.G.

In the intestine, Spdef−/− mice show reduced mucus production and low granule numbers in goblet and Paneth cells, respectively, implicating Spdef in terminal differentiation of these secretory cells (19Gregorieff A. Stange D.E. Kujala P. Begthel H. van den Born M. Korving J. Peters P.J. Clevers H.

Cell Res. 2010; 316: 452-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). We generated an independent null allele for Spdef, and here we report on the requirement for this epithelial Ets factor in the mammalian stomach. Antral mucosal hyperplasia develops in a significant fraction of Spdef−/− mice within 18 months in response to antecedent inflammation. We attribute this disorder to defects in maturation of mucous gland cells, which normally express high Spdef levels and in its absence show reduced numbers of secretory granules and reduced expression of Muc6 and Tff2. Thus, in addition to controlling maturation of intestinal goblet and Paneth cells, Spdef also regulates terminal differentiation of antral mucous gland cells. This activity is necessary for proper epithelial barrier function.DISCUSSIONDistinct regions in the mammalian stomach are distinguished by the presence of highly specialized glandular epithelial cells such as acid-secreting parietal and zymogenic chief cells in the corpus and gastrin-producing endocrine and mucous gland cells in the antrum. In addition to secretory functions, the gastric mucosa also forms a barrier against damage from ingested food and microbes. All epithelial cell lineages derive from a common progenitor, but few transcriptional regulators of cell fate determination and terminal differentiation have been identified. Significant expression of the epithelial Ets protein Spdefin the distal stomach suggested the possibility of such a role.Spdef is expressed in mucous neck and gland cells of the corpus and antrum, respectively. We show that Spdef gene deletion leads to reduced expression of known protective factors such as Muc6 and Tff2 and to significantly reduced numbers and defects in secretory granules in antral mucous gland cells. These observations parallel recent findings in the intestine, where Spdef specifically regulates maturation of goblet and Paneth cells (19Gregorieff A. Stange D.E. Kujala P. Begthel H. van den Born M. Korving J. Peters P.J. Clevers H. Gastroenterology. 2009; 137 (e1–3): 1333-1345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Taken together with the observation that Spdef controls terminal differentiation of goblet cells in the lung (18Chen G. Korfhagen T.R. Xu Y. Kitzmiller J. Wert S.E. Maeda Y. Gregorieff A. Clevers H. Whitsett J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2009; 119: 2914-2924Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and of luminal epithelial cells in the prostate, 5X. Gu, J. Li, M. Bhasin, Q. Yang, W. Chen, D. Lin, D. Horst, J. Howell, M. Sanda, Y.-P. Li, and T. Liberman, manuscript in preparation. this transcription factor appears to enable maturation of specialized secretory cells in several organs. Of particular interest in this light are the phenotypic similarities between intestinal goblet and gastric antral mucous gland cells, each of which matures incompletely in the absence of Spdef. These two cell types represent a subset of the highly specialized mucin-producing cells that populate the digestive mucosa and produce acidic mucins necessary to protect the epithelium (38Lamont J.T. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 1992; 664: 190-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 39Yamazaki Y. Ueda T. Kohli Y. Fujiki N. Imamura Y. Fukuda M. Eur. J. Histochem. 1992; 36: 161-176PubMed Google Scholar). Needs for particular mucins vary along the gastrointestinal tract, and mucin-producing cells have evolved to meet those needs. Goblet cell numbers increase steadily from the duodenum, where they are sparse, to the colon, where they constitute the majority, and differ materially from the dominant mucinous cells in the stomach, pit cells, which produce neutral mucins. Spdef-dependent mucous cells in the gastric antrum are distinctive but poorly characterized. Their morphology, location, and staining properties place them closest to the network of submucosal secretory cells in duodenal Brunner glands (31Hughes N.R. Bhathal P.S. Francis D.M. J. Clin. Pathol. 1994; 47: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), another poorly characterized population that also shows Spdef expression. The shared dependence on Spdef suggests that although antral mucous and intestinal goblet cells serve different, region-specific functions, they may have evolved from a common cellular ancestor that first used Spdef for coordinate regulation of secretory granule products.The secretory cell defects did not affect epithelial proliferation or other neighboring cell types in young animals. Over time, however, compromised mucous cell maturation led to antral gastritis in most Spdef−/− mice, with polypoid antral hyperplasia, likely reactive, ensuing in about half the cases. These findings imply that Spdef-mediated mucous gland cell maturation is required for protective barrier function. Spdef−/− mucous gland cells showed reduced expression of Tff2, a protease-resistant peptide that is co-secreted with mucus and thought to help in oligomerization of mucin polysaccharides to form a protective viscous coat (35Jeffrey G.P. Oates P.S. Wang T.C. Babyatsky M.W. Brand S.J. Gastroenterology. 1994; 106: 336-345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 40Kindon H. Pothoulakis C. Thim L. Lynch-Devaney K. Podolsky D.K. Gastroenterology. 1995; 109: 516-523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Tff2-null mice are prone to epithelial hyperplasia and dysplasia upon H. pylori infection, whereas supplementary administration of Tff2 accelerates healing of gastric mucosal ulcers (41Poulsen S.S. Thulesen J. Christensen L. Nexo E. Thim L. Gut. 1999; 45: 516-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Thus, Spdef may exert protection in part through control of Tff2 expression. We also observed reduced expression of Muc6 and reduced staining with GS-II lectin in antral mucous gland cells, suggesting a broad role for Spdef in completing the maturation necessary to produce an effective epithelial barrier.Gene expression analysis provided additional clues. Both Spdef−/− antrum and Spdef−/− intestine have reduced levels of Creb3l4, an endoplasmic reticulum-associated transcription factor of unknown function (42Labrie C. Lessard J. Ben Aicha S. Savard M.P. Pelletier M. Fournier A. Lavergne E. Calvo E. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2008; 108: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Creb3l4 is the transcript most closely correlated to Spdef across numerous expression datasets, 6D. Horst, X. Gu, M. Bhasin, Q. Yang, M. Verzi, D. Lin, M. Joseph, X. Zhang, W. Chen, Y.-P. Li, R. A. Shivdasani, and T. A. Libermann, unpublished results. followed by Mlph. Mlph is expressed highest in Spdef+ epithelia and belongs to a family that regulates secretory granules (43Matesic L.E. Yip R.

Fukuda M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5245-5255Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), suggesting a potential role in the Spdef−/− antral secretory defects. Dmbt1, one of the genes most increased in Spdef−/− antrum, is highly expressed in lung, intestinal, salivary, and mammary gland epithelia and in the neck region of gastric glands; its levels increase in response to inflammation and decrease in terminally differentiated epithelia (45Kang W. Reid K.B. FEBS Lett. 2003; 540: 21-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Thus, increased Dmbt1 may contribute to incomplete mucous cell differentiation in the Spdef−/− antrum. Additional genes with diminished expression in the intestine of an independent Spdef−/− strain, including Hgfac, Ccl6, Ccl9, Rap1gap, and Es1 (19Gregorieff A. Stange D.E. Kujala P.

Thus, in addition to controlling maturation of intestinal goblet and Paneth cells, Spdef also regulates terminal differentiation of antral mucous gland cells.

https://openalex.org/W2011645599,"Cytoskeletal regulation of cell adhesion is vital to the organization of multicellular structures. The focal adhesion protein zyxin emerged as a key regulator of actin assembly because zyxin recruits Enabled/vasodilator-stimulated phospho-proteins (Ena/VASP) to promote actin assembly. Zyxin also localizes to the sites of cell-cell adhesion and is thought to promote actin assembly with Ena/VASP. Using shRNA targeted to zyxin, we analyzed the roles of zyxin at adhesive contacts. In zyxin-deficient cells, the actin assembly at both focal adhesion and cell-cell adhesion was limited, but their migration rate was unchanged. Cell spreading on E-cadherin-coated surfaces and the formation of cell clusters were slower for zyxin-deficient cells than wild type cells. By ablating a single cell within a cell monolayer, we quantified the rate of wound closure driven by a contractile circumferential actin ring. Zyxin-deficient cells failed to recruit VASP to cell-cell junctions at the wound edge and had a slower wound closure rate than wild type cells. Our results suggest that, by recruiting VASP, zyxin regulates actin assembly at the sites of force-bearing cell-cell adhesion.

Adhesion proteins are abundant, but they alone do not sufficiently provide the necessary function and strength of cell adhesion. At cell-extracellular matrix and cell-cell junctions, the actin cytoskeleton promotes the formation and stabilization of adhesive contacts. The regulation of actin assembly is therefore crucial to the regulation of cell adhesion.Despite the presence of distinct adhesive receptors, some actin-binding proteins are shared by both cell-extracellular and cell-cell junctions.

Bioessays. 1997; 19: 949-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the localization of zyxin is mechano-sensitive. Zyxin is recruited to actin stress fibers upon uniaxial stretching of cells on a compliant substrate (3Yoshigi M. Hoffman L.M. Jensen C.C. Yost H.J. Beckerle M.C. J.

In addition, stretch-induced actin polymerization at focal adhesion sites has been shown to depend on zyxin (5Hirata H. Tatsumi H. Sokabe M. J.

Because of its unique ability to sense external mechanical cues and regulate actin polymerization, zyxin is an attractive candidate for regulating cell adhesion.Although zyxin does not interact directly with actin, zyxin contains binding sites for other actin-binding proteins.

However, the expression of the LIM domains alone is sufficient for targeting zyxin to focal adhesions (9Nix D.A. Fradelizi J. Bockholt S. Menichi B. Louvard D. Friederich E. Beckerle M.C. J. Biol.

VASP is thought to compete with actin-capping protein for binding to the barbed ends of actin filaments, thus promoting actin filament elongation (12Bear J.E. Gertler F.B. J. Cell Sci. 2009; 122: 1947-1953Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). By recruiting Ena/VASP to focal adhesions, zyxin regulates focal adhesion assembly and actin organization.Previous studies focused on zyxin at focal adhesion sites, but little is known about the roles of zyxin at cell-cell adhesion. Both α-actinin binding domain and LIM domains of zyxin have the ability to localize to cell-cell contacts (13Hansen M.D. Beckerle M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16178-16188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The overexpression of zyxin without LIM domains (zyxinΔLIM) enhances cell aggregation, but proline-to-alanine mutations in the proline-rich domain or the LIM domains of zyxin alone do not have such effects (13Hansen M.D. Beckerle M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16178-16188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Yet, the overexpression of zyxinΔLIM with the proline-to-alanine mutations reduces the enhanced cell cluster formation observed in zyxinΔLIM-overexpressing cells, suggesting that the LIM domains negatively regulate the function of Ena/VASP binding sites (13Hansen M.D. Beckerle M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16178-16188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).Ena/VASP has been shown to be important for the integrity of cell-cell adhesion and the underlying actin organization. For example, Ena/VASP-null mice suffer vascular defects, likely due to the disruption of endothelial barrier function (14Furman C. Sieminski A.L. Kwiatkowski A.V. Rubinson D.A. Vasile E. Bronson R.T. Fässler R. Gertler F.B. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 179: 761-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In primary keratinocytes, the expression of dominant negative VASP results in the disruption of adhesion zipper formation at cell-cell contacts (15Vasioukhin V. Bauer C. Yin M. Fuchs E. Cell. 2000; 100: 209-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar). Furthermore, sequestration of Ena/VASP proteins to the mitochondria results in reduced actin level at cell-cell contacts and cadherin-based adhesion plaques (16Scott J.A. Shewan A.M. den Elzen N.R. Loureiro J.J. Gertler F.B. Yap A.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 1085-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Together, all previous results point to the intimate functional relationship between zyxin and Ena/VASP in facilitating actin assembly at the sites of focal adhesion and cell-cell adhesion.We sought to analyze the role of zyxin as a regulator of VASP localization and actin assembly at sites of cell-cell adhesion using epithelial cells stably expressing zyxin shRNA. In zyxin-deficient cells, actin assembly was reduced at both sites of focal adhesion and cell-cell adhesion. Zyxin-deficient cells had no migration defects, but exhibited slower cell spreading on an E-cadherin-coated surface and cell cluster formation. Furthermore, the monolayer of zyxin-deficient cells was unable to recruit VASP to cell-cell junctions at the wound edge and effectively close a small circular wound. Together, our results suggest that zyxin regulates E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion by facilitating actin assembly.DISCUSSIONIn addition to the roles of zyxin at focal adhesions (supplemental Fig. S1) (5Hirata H. Tatsumi H. Sokabe M. J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 2795-2804Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 6Drees B. Friederich E. Fradelizi J. Louvard D. Beckerle M.C. Golsteyn R.M. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 699-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), our results show that zyxin also regulates actin assembly at sites of cell-cell adhesion. Actin incorporation at cell-cell contacts was significantly reduced in zyxin-knockdown cells, especially at multicellular junctions where zyxin is often enriched (Fig. 4B). Unlike at focal adhesions, VASP accumulated along cell-cell contacts in zyxin-deficient cells. Therefore, zyxin-mediated actin assembly along the sites of cell-cell adhesion is independent of VASP localization.On E-cadherin-coated substrates, actin assembly is attenuated at adhesion plaques and the lamellipodia in zyxin-knockdown cells (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, VASP is still localized to the tips of cadherin-based lamellipodia (Fig. 3C). Despite the absence of zyxin, VASP can interact with vinculin (20Brindle N.P. Holt M.R. Davies J.E. Price C.J. Critchley D.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 753-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 21Reinhard M. Rüdiger M. Jockusch B.M. Walter U. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), lipoma-preferred partner (22Petit M.M. Fradelizi J. Golsteyn R.M. Ayoubi T.A. Menichi B. Louvard D. Van de Ven W.J. Friederich E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 117-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (23Castellano F. Le Clainche C. Patin D. Carlier M.F. Chavrier P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5603-5614Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In zyxin-deficient cells, these proteins may recruit VASP to sites of cell-cell contacts. However, the defect in actin assembly at leading edges is not dependent on VASP localization, consistent with our observations at cell-cell adhesion (Fig. 4). Because actin polymerization at the lamellipodia is necessary for the formation of nascent cell adhesion on extracellular matrix (24Galbraith C.G. Yamada K.M. Galbraith J.A. Science. 2007; 315: 992-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 25Choi C.K. Vicente-Manzanares M. Zareno J. Whitmore L.A. Mogilner A. Horwitz A.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 1039-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar), the reduced actin polymerization at the leading edge, rather than the reduction in E-cadherin level, is likely responsible for the slow cell spreading on E-cadherin substrate. This also suggests that actin assembly may be important for the early stage of cell-cell adhesion as observed in hanging drop assays. Our data show that zyxin plays a role in the formation of cadherin-mediated adhesion in a VASP-independent manner.Although VASP-positive junctions are often sites of actin assembly, it is not clear why the presence of VASP does not enhance actin assembly at cell-cell contacts of zyxin-knockdown cells. It is possible that the localization of VASP is not sufficient and VASP needs to be activated to promote actin assembly. Based on the analysis of overexpressed zyxin mutants and detergent insolubility as a measure of VASP activation, the LIM domains of zyxin have been suggested to negatively regulate the ability of the ActA domain to activate VASP at cell-cell adhesion sites (13Hansen M.D. Beckerle M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16178-16188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This may explain how the VASP-zyxin interaction regulates zyxin-bound VASP, but it does not explain how the rest of VASP may be regulated at cell-cell contacts.Previous studies have shown that VASP has an intrinsic ability to regulate actin assembly. For example, the recruitment of VASP via the conserved proline-rich domain of ActA is sufficient to promote Listeria motility in a system with purified proteins (26Loisel T.P. Boujemaa R. Pantaloni D. Carlier M.F. Nature. 1999; 401: 613-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). Furthermore, anticapping activity of VASP does not require any association with ActA (27Pasic L. Kotova T. Schafer D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 9814-9819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), suggesting that VASP is constitutively active. However, VASP is not an actin nucleator. Instead, VASP activity is essential for the organization of branched versus linear actin network (28Bear J.E. Svitkina T.M. Krause M. Schafer D.A. Loureiro J.J. Strasser G.A. Maly I.V. Chaga O.Y. Cooper J.A. Borisy G.G. Gertler F.B. Cell. 2002; 109: 509-521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar) and may not be essential for actin assembly at cell-cell adhesion sites. Actin assembly at sites of cell-cell adhesion may be regulated by other actin nucleators. For example, the Arp2/3 complex (29Yamada S. Nelson W.J. J.

Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), and Dia1 (33Carramusa L. Ballestrem C. Zilberman Y. Bershadsky A.D. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 3870-3882Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) have been shown to localize to cell-cell contacts. Interestingly, VASP localization at cell-cell adhesion depends on Dia1 (33Carramusa L. Ballestrem C. Zilberman Y. Bershadsky A.D. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 3870-3882Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The relationship between zyxin and other actin nucleators remains unclear.Although VASP localization is independent of zyxin at cell-cell contacts (Fig. 4C) and at the tips of E-cadherin mediated lamellipodia (Fig. 3C), our study also demonstrates that VASP accumulation strongly depends on zyxin at the E-cadherin plaques (Fig. 3C) and at cell-cell junctions of wound-bordering cells (Fig. 5A). Interestingly, both junctions are located at the ends of prominent contractile actin bundles, suggesting that these junctions are under high mechanical load and that zyxin, a mechano-sensing protein, may be involved in force-induced VASP recruitment.During wound closure, the cadherin junctions of wound-healing cells are under constant tension from an actin-myosin contractile “purse-string” that shortens to seal the wound (34Jacinto A. Martinez-Arias A. Martin P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: E117-E123Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The circumferential actin bundles are enriched with myosin II, and together, they generate contractile forces (34Jacinto A. Martinez-Arias A. Martin P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: E117-E123Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 35Bement W.M. Forscher P. Mooseker M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 565-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The wound healing of a small incision depends on cadherin junctions since the addition of anti-cadherin antibody inhibits wound closure (36Danjo Y. Gipson I.K. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3323-3332PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the force-induced α-catenin-vinculin interaction is shown to occur at cell-cell junctions of wound-bordering cells (37Yonemura S. Wada Y. Watanabe T. Nagafuchi A. Shibata M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2010; 12: 533-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). In addition, we found that, unlike VASP localization at quiescent cell-cell junctions (Fig. 4C), VASP accumulation at the edges of cell-cell junctions of wound-bordering cells strongly depends on zyxin, and the absence of zyxin and VASP at these cadherin junction sites decreases the rate of wound closure (Fig. 5). Therefore, our data suggest that the purse-string contraction of wound-healing cells requires actin assembly mediated by the zyxin·VASP complex.Collectively, these data suggest that the mechano-sensing ability of zyxin is critical for VASP recruitment and the regulation of actin dynamics at force-bearing cell-extracellular matrix and cell-cell junctions. Previous studies have shown that the actin network at sites of cell-cell adhesion is highly dynamic in diverse systems (38Cavey M. Rauzi M. Lenne P.F. Lecuit T. Nature. 2008; 453: 751-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 39Yamada S. Pokutta S. Drees F. Weis W.I. Nelson W.J. Cell. 2005; 123: 889-901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar), yet it remains unclear how the mechanical forces affect the actin dynamics. Our study identifies zyxin as a key regulator of actin assembly at the sites of force-bearing cell adhesion in simple epithelial cells.

VASP is thought to compete with actin-capping protein for binding to the barbed ends of actin filaments, thus promoting actin filament elongation (12Bear J.E. Gertler F.B. J. Cell Sci. 2009; 122: 1947-1953Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). By recruiting Ena/VASP to focal adhesions, zyxin regulates focal adhesion assembly and actin organization.Previous studies focused on zyxin at focal adhesion sites, but little is known about the roles of zyxin at cell-cell adhesion. Both α-actinin binding domain and LIM domains of zyxin have the ability to localize to cell-cell contacts (13Hansen M.D. Beckerle M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16178-16188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The overexpression of zyxin without LIM domains (zyxinΔLIM) enhances cell aggregation, but proline-to-alanine mutations in the proline-rich domain or the LIM domains of zyxin alone do not have such effects (13Hansen M.D. Beckerle M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16178-16188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Yet, the overexpression of zyxinΔLIM with the proline-to-alanine mutations reduces the enhanced cell cluster formation observed in zyxinΔLIM-overexpressing cells, suggesting that the LIM domains negatively regulate the function of Ena/VASP binding sites (13Hansen M.D. Beckerle M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16178-16188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).Ena/VASP has been shown to be important for the integrity of cell-cell adhesion and the underlying actin organization. For example, Ena/VASP-null mice suffer vascular defects, likely due to the disruption of endothelial barrier function (14Furman C. Sieminski A.L. Kwiatkowski A.V. Rubinson D.A. Vasile E. Bronson R.T. Fässler R. Gertler F.B. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 179: 761-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In primary keratinocytes, the expression of dominant negative VASP results in the disruption of adhesion zipper formation at cell-cell contacts (15Vasioukhin V. Bauer C. Yin M. Fuchs E. Cell. 2000; 100: 209-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar). Furthermore, sequestration of Ena/VASP proteins to the mitochondria results in reduced actin level at cell-cell contacts and cadherin-based adhesion plaques (16Scott J.A. Shewan A.M. den Elzen N.R. Loureiro J.J. Gertler F.B. Yap A.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 1085-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Together, all previous results point to the intimate functional relationship between zyxin and Ena/VASP in facilitating actin assembly at the sites of focal adhesion and cell-cell adhesion.We sought to analyze the role of zyxin as a regulator of VASP localization and actin assembly at sites of cell-cell adhesion using epithelial cells stably expressing zyxin shRNA. In zyxin-deficient cells, actin assembly was reduced at both sites of focal adhesion and cell-cell adhesion. Zyxin-deficient cells had no migration defects, but exhibited slower cell spreading on an E-cadherin-coated surface and cell cluster formation. Furthermore, the monolayer of zyxin-deficient cells was unable to recruit VASP to cell-cell junctions at the wound edge and effectively close a small circular wound. Together, our results suggest that zyxin regulates E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion by facilitating actin assembly."
https://openalex.org/W2050091769,"Chemokine receptors are members of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. CCR5 is also the principal co-receptor for macrophage-tropic strains of human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1), and efforts have been made to develop ligands to inhibit HIV-1 infection by promoting CCR5 receptor endocytosis. Given the nature of GPCRs and their propensity to form oligomers, one can consider ligand-based therapies as unselective in terms of the oligomeric composition of complexes. For example, a ligand targeting a CCR5 homomer could likely induce signal transduction on a heteromeric CCR5-CXCR4. Other avenues could therefore be explored. We identified a receptor adaptor interacting specifically with one receptor complex but not others. NHERF1, an adaptor known for its role in desensitization, internalization, and regulation of the ERK signaling cascade for several GPCRs, interacts via its PDZ2 domain with the CCR5 homodimer but not with the CXCR4-CCR5 heterodimer or CXCR4 homodimer. To further characterize this interaction, we also show that NHERF1 increases the CCR5 recruitment of arrestin2 following stimulation. NHERF1 is also involved in CCR5 internalization, as we demonstrate that co-expression of constructs bearing the PDZ2 domain can block CCR5 internalization. We also show that NHERF1 potentiates RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted)-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation via CCR5 activation and that this activation requires NHERF1 but not arrestin2. Taken together, our results suggest that oligomeric receptor complexes can associate specifically with partners and that in this case NHERF1 could represent an interesting new target for the regulation of CCR5 internalization and potentially HIV infection."

https://openalex.org/W2041923834,"Lysyl oxidase-like protein-2 (LOXL2) induces epithelial to mesenchymal transition and promotes invasiveness. To understand the mechanisms involved, we examined the effect of LOXL2 overexpression in MCF-7 cells on gene expression. We found that LOXL2 up-regulated the expression of receptor activity modifying protein-3 (RAMP3). Expression of RAMP3 in MDA-MB-231 cells in which LOXL2 expression was inhibited restored vimentin expression, invasiveness, and tumor development. Inhibition of RAMP3 expression in MDA-MB-231 cells mimicked the effects produced by inhibition of LOXL2 expression and was accompanied by inhibition of p38 phosphorylation. LOXL2 overexpression in these cells did not restore invasiveness, suggesting that RAMP3 functions downstream to LOXL2. LOXL2 and RAMP3 are strongly coexpressed in human colon, breast, and gastric carcinomas but not in normal colon or gastric epithelial cells. RAMP3 associates with several G-protein-coupled receptors forming receptors for peptides, such as adrenomedullin and amylin. We hypothesized that RAMP3 could function as a transducer of autocrine signals induced by such peptides. However, the proinvasive effects of RAMP3 could not be abrogated following inhibition of the expression or activity of these peptides. Our experiments suggest that the protumorigenic effects of LOXL2 are partially mediated by RAMP3 and that RAMP3 inhibitors may function as antitumorigenic agents. -"
https://openalex.org/W2169014250,"PKCδ has emerged as a novel regulatory molecule of oxidative phosphorylation by targeting the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC). We showed that activation of PKCδ leads to the dephosphorylation of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 2 (PDK2), thereby decreasing PDK2 activity and increasing PDH activity, accelerating oxygen consumption, and augmenting ATP synthesis. However, the molecular components that mediate PKCδ signaling in mitochondria have remained elusive so far. Here, we identify for the first time a functional complex, which includes cytochrome c as the upstream driver of PKCδ, and uses the adapter protein p66Shc as a platform with vitamin A (retinol) as a fourth partner. All four components are necessary for the activation of the PKCδ signal chain. Genetic ablation of any one of the three proteins, or retinol depletion, silences signaling. Furthermore, mutations that disrupt the interaction of cytochrome c with p66Shc, of p66Shc with PKCδ, or the deletion of the retinol-binding pocket on PKCδ, attenuate signaling. In cytochrome c-deficient cells, reintroduction of cytochrome c Fe(3+) protein restores PKCδ signaling. Taken together, these results indicate that oxidation of PKCδ is key to the activation of the pathway. The PKCδ/p66Shc/cytochrome c signalosome might have evolved to effect site-directed oxidation of zinc-finger structures of PKCδ, which harbor the activation centers and the vitamin A binding sites. Our findings define the molecular mechanisms underlying the signaling function of PKCδ in mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W1981984219,"C-terminal Src kinase (Csk) phosphorylates and down-regulates the Src family tyrosine kinases (SFKs). Crystallographic studies of Csk found an unusual arrangement of the SH2 and SH3 regulatory domains about the kinase core, forming a compact structure. However, recent structural studies of mutant Csk in the presence of an inhibitor indicate that the enzyme accesses an expanded structure. To investigate whether wt-Csk may also access open conformations we applied small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS). We find wt-Csk frequently occupies an extended conformation where the regulatory domains are removed from the kinase core. In addition, all-atom structure-based simulations indicate Csk occupies two free energy basins. These basins correspond to ensembles of distinct global conformations of Csk: a compact structure and an extended structure. The transitions between these structures are entropically driven and accessible via thermal fluctuations that break local interactions. We further characterized the ensemble by generating theoretical scattering curves for mixed populations of conformations from both basins and compared the predicted scattering curves to the experimental profile. This population-combination analysis is more consistent with the experimental data than any rigid model. It suggests that Csk adopts a broad ensemble of conformations in solution, populating extended conformations not observed in the crystal structure that may play an important role in the regulation of Csk. The methodology developed here is broadly applicable to biological macromolecules and will provide useful information about what ensembles of conformations are consistent with the experimental data as well as the ubiquitous dynamic reversible assembly processes inherent in biology."

https://openalex.org/W2025655599,"Androgens contribute to the involution process of the aging thymus gland. However, molecular mechanisms behind this effect remain largely unknown. We have investigated the influence of testosterone on the ectopic synthesis of glucocorticoids (GCs) in thymocytes, an activity recently shown by us to be important for the homeostatic regulation of these cells. Castration, which leads to a strong increase in thymus tissue and function, was associated with a reduced GC release from thymocytes caused by down-regulated expression of several enzymes involved in GC synthesis, without affecting GC synthesis in the adrenals. Testosterone treatment of castrated male mice reversed these effects, also without affecting adrenal GC synthesis. The effects of testosterone in castrated mice on thymocyte homeostasis and GC release were strongly reduced in mice pretreated with the CYP11B1 enzyme inhibitor metyrapone, acting on the last step in the corticosterone synthesis. The androgen-induced thymic involution was dependent on GC action, because this was completely absent in mice lacking GC receptor (GR) expression specifically in thymocytes. We provide here an unrecognized mechanism how androgens contribute to thymic involution by stimulating local synthesis and release of GCs in the thymus."

The question of how these signals are deciphered by the myogenic effectors remains largely unaddressed. In this study, we show that the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase Pin1, which catalyzes the isomerization of phosphorylated Ser/Thr-Pro peptide bonds to induce conformational changes of its target proteins, acts as an inhibitor of muscle differentiation because its knockdown in myoblasts promotes myotube formation. With the aim of clarifying the mechanism of Pin1 function in skeletal myogenesis, we investigated whether MEF2C, a critical regulator of the myogenic program that is the end point of several signaling pathways, might serve as a/the target for the inhibitory effects of Pin1 on muscle differentiation. We show that Pin1 interacts selectively with phosphorylated MEF2C in skeletal muscle cells, both in vitro and in vivo. The interaction with Pin1 requires two novel critical phospho-Ser/Thr-Pro motifs in MEF2C, Ser98 and Ser110, which are phosphorylated in vivo. Overexpression of Pin1 decreases MEF2C stability and activity and its ability to cooperate with MyoD to activate myogenic conversion.

https://openalex.org/W2028541974,"Cdc25B is a key regulator of entry into mitosis, and its activity and localization are regulated by binding of the 14-3-3 dimer. There are three 14-3-3 binding sites on Cdc25B, with Ser(323) being the highest affinity binding and is highly homologous to the Ser(216) 14-3-3 binding site on Cdc25C. Loss of 14-3-3 binding to Ser(323) increases cyclin/Cdk substrate access to the catalytic site, thereby increasing its activity. It also affects the localization of Cdc25B. Thus, phosphorylation and 14-3-3 binding to this site is essential for down-regulating Cdc25B activity, blocking its mitosis promoting function. The question of how this inhibitory signal is relieved to allow Cdc25B activation and entry into mitosis is yet to be resolved. Here, we show that Ser(323) phosphorylation is maintained into mitosis, but phosphorylation of Ser(321) disrupts 14-3-3 binding to Ser(323), mimicking the effect of inhibiting Ser(323) phosphorylation on both Cdc25B activity and localization. The unphosphorylated Ser(321) appears to have a role in stabilizing 14-3-3 binding to Ser(323), and loss of the Ser hydroxyl group appears to be sufficient to significantly reduce 14-3-3 binding. A consequence of loss of 14-3-3 binding is dephosphorylation of Ser(323). Ser(321) is phosphorylated in mitosis by Cdk1. The mitotic phosphorylation of Ser(321) acts to maintain full activation of Cdc25B by disrupting 14-3-3 binding to Ser(323) and enhancing the dephosphorylation of Ser(323) to block 14-3-3 binding to this site."

MLCP consists of a catalytic subunit, a large subunit (MYPT1 or MYPT2), and a small subunit. MLCP activity is regulated by phosphorylation of MYPTs, whereas the role of small subunit in the regulation remains unknown. We previously characterized a human heart-specific small subunit (hHS-M(21)) that increased the sensitivity to Ca(2+) in muscle contraction. In this study, we investigated the role of hHS-M(21) in the regulation of MLCP phosphorylation. Two isoforms of hHS-M(21), hHS-M(21)A and hHS-M(21)B, preferentially bound the C-terminal one-third region of MYPT1 and MYPT2, respectively. Amino acid substitutions at a phosphorylation site of MYPT1, Ser-852, impaired the binding of MYPT1 and hHS-M(21). The hHS-M(21) increased the phosphorylation level of MYPT1 at Thr-696, which was attenuated by Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) inhibitors and small interfering RNAs for ROCK. In addition, hHS-M(21) bound ROCK and enhanced the ROCK activity. These findings suggest that hHS-M(21) is a heart-specific effector of ROCK and plays a regulatory role in the MYPT1 phosphorylation at Thr-696 by ROCK."

The purpose of the current study was to identify mechanisms responsible for heparanase induction. We provide evidence that heparanase expression is regulated at the post-transcriptional level by sequences at the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR) of the gene. Constructing the 3' UTR immediately following the heparanase cDNA reduces heparanase enzymatic activity and protein levels, resulting in decreased cellular invasion capacity. We further identified a 185-bp sequence within the 3' UTR that mediates heparanase down-regulation, and characterized an adenine (A)/uracil (U)-rich consensus element (ARE) within this region. Deletion of the entire 185-bp region or the ARE eliminated the inhibitory effect of the 3' UTR, resulting in elevated heparanase levels and formation of larger tumor xenografts indistinguishable from those produced by heparanase-overexpressing cells in terms of size, vascularization, and Akt activation. These results suggest that loss of the ARE is an important regulatory mechanism contributing to heparanase induction in human cancer."

However, Kdo hydrolase enzymatic activity has been detected in membranes of Helicobacter pylori and Francisella tularensis and may be responsible for the removal of side-chain Kdo from the LPS core saccharides. We now report the identification of genes encoding a Kdo hydrolase in F. tularensis Schu S4 and live vaccine strain strains, in H. pylori 26695 strain and in Legionella pneumophila Philadelphia 1 strain. We have renamed the genes kdhA for keto-deoxyoctulosonate hydrolase A. Deletion of kdhA abolished Kdo hydrolase activity in membranes of F. tularensis live vaccine strain. The F. tularensis kdhA mutant synthesized a core oligosaccharide containing a Kdo disaccharide with one of the Kdo residues being a terminal side chain. This side-chain Kdo monosaccharide was absent in the wild-type core oligosaccharide. Expression in Escherichia coli of recombinant KdhA from F. tularensis, H. pylori, and L. pneumophila resulted in a reduction of membrane-associated side-chain Kdo.

Sporozoites eventually enter hepatocytes, where they differentiate into liver-stage parasites. During the first hours after hepatocyte invasion, the crescent-shaped sporozoites transform into spherical intracellular exoerythrocytic parasites. This process, which precedes genome replication, can be mimicked in vitro in the absence of host cells. Here, we developed an automated method to follow transformation and cell death of sporozoites in vitro. This assay provides a rapid tool to test sporozoite survival and to screen for antiparasitic drugs. We found that extracellular bicarbonate and high temperature trigger transformation, whereas physiological serum albumin concentrations and media lacking bicarbonate delayed sporozoite death. Because bicarbonate also triggers ookinete transformation and exflagellation of gametocytes, we suggest that a common molecular mechanism regulates similar aspects of stage conversion in Plasmodium."
https://openalex.org/W2112789434,"Sexual reproduction in fungi requires induction of signaling pheromones within environments that are conducive to mating. The fungus Cryptococcus neoformans is currently the fourth greatest cause of infectious death in regions of Africa and undergoes mating in phytonutrient-rich environments to create spores with infectious potential. Here we show that under conditions where sexual development is inhibited, a ∼17-fold excess of MFα pheromone transcript is synthesized and then degraded by a DEAD box protein, Vad1, resulting in low steady state transcript levels. Transfer to mating medium or deletion of the VAD1 gene resulted in high level accumulation of MFα transcripts and enhanced mating, acting in concert with the mating-related HOG1 pathway. We then investigated whether the high metabolic cost of this apparently futile transcriptional cycle could be justified by a more rapid induction of mating. Maintenance of Vad1 activity on inductive mating medium by constitutive expression resulted in repressed levels of MFα that did not prevent but rather prolonged the time to successful mating from 5-6 h to 15 h (p < 0.0001). In sum, these data suggest that VAD1 negatively regulates the sexual cell cycle via degradation of constitutive high levels of MFα transcripts in a synthetic/degradative cycle, providing a mechanism of mRNA induction for time-critical cellular events, such as mating induction."

Pulse-chase experiments demonstrate that in cells expressing both the Na,K-ATPase α- and β-subunits, newly synthesized α-subunit associates with β-COP immediately after its synthesis but that this interaction does not constitute an obligate intermediate in the assembly of the α- and β-subunits to form the pump holoenzyme. The interaction with β-COP was reduced by mutating a dibasic motif at Lys54 in the Na,K-ATPase α-subunit. This mutant α-subunit is not retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and reaches the plasma membrane, even in the absence of Na,K-ATPase β-subunit expression. Although the Lys54 α-subunit reaches the cell surface without need for β-subunit assembly, it is only functional as an ion-transporting ATPase in the presence of the β-subunit. Plasma membrane expression of the Na,K-ATPase requires assembly of its α- and β-subunits. Using a novel labeling technique to identify Na,K-ATPase partner proteins, we detected an interaction between the Na,K-ATPase α-subunit and the coat protein, β-COP, a component of the COP-I complex. When expressed in the absence of the Na,K-ATPase β-subunit, the Na,K-ATPase α-subunit interacts with β-COP, is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum, and is targeted for degradation. In the presence of the Na,K-ATPase β-subunit, the α-subunit does not interact with β-COP and traffics to the plasma membrane.

https://openalex.org/W1991129947,"Mammalian-regulated secretion is absolutely dependent on four evolutionarily conserved proteins: three SNARE proteins and munc18. Dissecting the functional outcomes of the spatially organized protein interactions between these factors has been difficult because of the close interrelationship between different binding modes. Here, we investigated the spatial distribution of single munc18 molecules at the plasma membrane of cells and the underlying interactions between syntaxin and munc18. Disruption of munc18 binding to the N-terminal peptide motif of syntaxin did not alter munc18 localization on the plasma membrane but had a pronounced influence on the behavior of secretory vesicles and their likelihood to undergo fusion. We therefore conclude that interaction with the syntaxin N-peptide can confer differential release probabilities to secretory vesicles and may contribute to the delineation of secretory vesicle pools.

We therefore conclude that interaction with the syntaxin N-peptide can confer differential release probabilities to secretory vesicles and may contribute to the delineation of secretory vesicle pools. In all specialized secretory cells, regulated exocytosis is mediated by three central players; the vesicular membrane protein synaptobrevin (v-SNARE) and plasma membrane proteins SNAP-25 (synaptosome-associated protein 25 kDa) and syntaxin (t-SNAREs) (1Söllner T.

Helices from each of these proteins interact to form a stable, ternary four-helical SNARE complex which catalyzes the fusion of vesicular and plasma membranes (3Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R.

This hypothesis was at odds with genetic experiments, which suggested a more positive role for munc18 (for review, see Ref. 18Toonen R.F. Verhage M. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 177-186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). It has now been established that munc18 is absolutely required for membrane fusion, most probably through its direct partnership with syntaxin (19Verhage M. Maia A.S. Plomp J.J. Brussaard A.B. Heeroma J.H. Vermeer H. Toonen R.F. Hammer R.E. van den Berg T.K. Missler M. Geuze H.J. Südhof T.C. Science. 2000; 287: 864-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar, 20de Wit H.

First, Munc18 can bind and stabilize syntaxin in a “closed” conformation in which the Habc domain of syntaxin folds back and occludes the SNARE motif (mode 1) (16Dulubova I. Sugita S. Hill S. Hosaka M. Fernandez I. Südhof T.C. Rizo J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4372-4382Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar, 17Pevsner J. Hsu S.C. Scheller R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 1445-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Second, interaction via the syntaxin highly conserved N terminus (mode 2) was recently confirmed, in common with other SM proteins (4Yang B. Steegmaier M. Gonzalez Jr., L.C. Scheller R.H. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 22Misura K.M. Scheller R.H. Weis W.I. Nature. 2000; 404: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar, 23Pevsner J.

EMBO J. 2008; 27: 923-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Third, munc18 can also interact with the ternary SNARE complex via “open” syntaxin (mode 3) (24Dulubova I. Khvotchev M. Liu S. Huryeva I. Südhof T.C. Rizo J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 2697-2702Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 25Shen J. Tareste D.C. Paumet F. Rothman J.E. Melia T.J.

Chem. 2007; 282: 12097-12103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Modes 2 and 3 utilize the same N-terminal binding motif in syntaxin and differ in the conformation and additional interactions adopted by the syntaxin molecule. More recently, it was suggested that munc18 interacts with the v-SNARE synaptobrevin in vitro, albeit at a far lower affinity than that observed for syntaxin (28Xu Y. Su L. Rizo J. Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 1568-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The multiple munc18-syntaxin binding mechanisms are utilized in distinct cellular locations and perform different regulatory roles (26Rickman C. Medine C.N. Bergmann A. Duncan R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12097-12103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Mode 1 binding is important in facilitating the trafficking of syntaxin to the plasma membrane (9Medine C.N. Rickman C. Chamberlain L.H. Duncan R.R. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 4407-4415Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) whereas modes 2 and 3 are involved in vesicle mobilization (21Rickman C. Duncan R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 3965-3972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), SNARE complex binding (24Dulubova I. Khvotchev M. Liu S. Huryeva I. Südhof T.C. Rizo J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 2697-2702Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), regulating the rate of membrane fusion in vitro (25Shen J. Tareste D.C. Paumet F. Rothman J.E. Melia T.J. Cell. 2007; 128: 183-195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar), and in synaptic vesicle “priming” (29Deák F. Xu Y. Chang W.P. Dulubova I. Khvotchev M. Liu X. Südhof T.C. Rizo J. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 184: 751-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Importantly, despite a large effort focused on the roles of munc18 in the exocytotic pathway it still remains unknown how munc18 is organized on the plasma membrane at the molecular level and how it may act upon single vesicles prior to the final fusion event. We describe new rationally designed mutants of munc18 that quantifiably disrupt specifically mode2/3 interaction in vitro and in living cells and use this as a tool to define the spatially restricted functional effects of this interaction. Using superresolution microscopy we have defined the highest possible resolution mapping of munc18 molecular distribution at the neuroendocrine plasma membrane. Together, these experiments demonstrate that munc18 molecules, interacting with the N terminus of syntaxin1, greatly increase the fusion competence of a specific pool of mode2 interaction-proximal vesicles. Plasmids encoding glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins with syntaxin1a (amino acids 1–261, cytoplasmic domain), syntaxin (amino acids 7–261, N-terminal truncation) were described previously (26Rickman C. Medine C.N. Bergmann A. Duncan R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12097-12103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and syntaxin (amino acids 1–225, ionic layer truncation) was constructed using similar techniques. A plasmid encoding a polyhistidine-tagged munc18 (amino acids 1–594) and munc18([E132A], [E132K], [I127A], [I127F], [D112A], or [D112K]) was as described previously (30Graham M.E. Sudlow A.W. Burgoyne R.D. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 2369-2377Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Generation of syntaxin1a N-terminal truncations was performed by PCR and subsequent ligation into HindIII/KpnI and HindIII/XbaI sites of pmCerulean-C1 and PGEXKG, respectively. The [E132A], [E132K], [I127A], [I127F], [D112A], and [D112K] mutations were generated individually by site-directed mutagenesis of munc18 in pGEX-KG and pEYFP-N1 vectors using a QuikChange II XL kit (Stratagene). Munc18 siRNA PC-12 cells (KD43) were a kind gift of Shuzo Sugita (10Arunachalam L. Han L. Tassew N.G. He Y. Wang L. Xie L. Fujita Y. Kwan E. Davletov B. Monnier P.P. Gaisano H.Y. Sugita S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 722-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% horse serum, 5% fetal bovine serum, 10 mm Glutamax (Invitrogen), 50 μg/ml gentamicin, puromycin (2. 5 μg/ml) and maintained at 37 °C in 7.5% (v/v) CO2, 92.5% (v/v) air. Transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Recombinant GST fusion proteins were expressed and purified as described previously (31Rickman C. Davletov B. Chem. Biol. 2005; 12: 545-553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). For in vitro binding reactions, 2 μg of GST-syntaxin1 and truncated syntaxin (1–225), (1–188), and (7–261) were immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) and incubated in a total volume of 100 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100 (buffer A). Beads were washed by low speed centrifugation, and bound protein eluted in SDS-containing sample buffer followed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. For binding reactions involving munc18, purified GST-syntaxin1a and truncations were incubated with either freshly prepared detergent rat brain extract, as described previously (26Rickman C. Medine C.N. Bergmann A. Duncan R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12097-12103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), or with freshly prepared detergent bacterial extract containing expressed recombinant His6-munc18 or a mutant form. The homogenate was then applied to GST-syntaxin beads and washed three times in buffer A, and bound protein was analyzed by Western immunoblotting using a monoclonal anti-munc18 antibody (BD Biosciences) and West Dura enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Pierce). The protein sequence alignment was generated using the ConSurf Data base (32Landau M. Mayrose I. Rosenberg Y. Glaser F. Martz E. Pupko T. Ben-Tal N. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: W299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar), and the structure was rendered using PyMOL (33DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. DeLano Scientific LLC, Palo Alto, CA2002Google Scholar). Cells with the lowest detectable expression levels were selected for analysis, and levels were similar between experiments. All time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) experiments were performed using a Zeiss LSM 510 Axiovert confocal laser scanning microscope, equipped with a pulsed excitation source (MIRA 900 Ti:Sapphire femtosecond pulsed laser with a coupled VERDI 10-watt pump laser (Coherent). Data were acquired using a 1024 × 1024-pixel image size, using a Zeiss Plan NeoFLUAR 1.4 NA ×63 oil immersion lens or a Zeiss C-Apochromat 1.2 NA ×63 water-corrected immersion objective lens For all microscopy, live cells imaged were maintained at 37 °C in 5% (v/v) CO2, 95% (v/v) air in a POC chamber (LaCon). TCSPC measurements were made under 800–820-nm two-photon excitation, which efficiently excited cerulean, without any detectable direct excitation or emission from EYFP, using a fast photomultiplier tube (H7422; Hamamatsu Photonics UK) coupled directly to the rear port of the Axiovert microscope. Full-frame TCSPC recordings were acquired for between 30 s and 60s, with mean photon counts between 105 and 106 counts/second. Images were recorded at 256 × 256 pixels from a 1024 × 1024-pixel image scan with 256 time bins over a 12-ns period. Off-line FLIM data analysis used pixel-based fitting software (SPCImage, Becker and Hickl). The optimization of the fit parameters was performed by using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, minimizing the weighted χ2 quantity. As controls for nonspecific FRET, or FRET between GFPs that may form dimers spontaneously when overexpressed in cells, we determined the fluorescence lifetime of cerulean-Syx1–288 alone. No FRET was detected in any of these control experiments. For vesicle tracking and fusion experiments cells were imaged under total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) illumination using an Olympus CellR widefield TIRFM microscope equipped with a 488-nm and 561-nm diode laser. Data were acquired using a Hamamatsu ImageEM EMCCD using an Olympus PLAN APO 1.45 NA ×150 oil immersion objective. TIRFM data of munc18-silenced PC-12 cells (KD43) expressing NPYmGFP (21Rickman C. Duncan R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 3965-3972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), or neuropeptide Y (NPY) mCherry (21Rickman C. Duncan R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 3965-3972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), as required, maintained at 37 °C in 5% (v/v) CO2, 95% (v/v) air, were acquired with a pixel size of 106 nm at 20 Hz. Single vesicles were identified and tracked using Imaris 5 (Bitplane). All track lengths shorter than 10 frames were discarded from the quantification. Where required, cells were stimulated by the addition of ATP to a final concentration of 300 μm. To quantify the amount of exocytosis, the number of fusing vesicles was calculated as a percentage of the total number of labeled vesicles at the plasma membrane. All munc18-silenced PC-12 cells (KD43) were transfected with munc18 (or variant) fused to PACherry and fixed with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde. Cycles of brief activation at 405 nm, followed by rapid imaging in TIRF mode at 561 nm were performed using an Olympus IX-81 microscope equipped with Olympus CellR acquisition software and an ImageEM EM-CCD 512 × 512 camera (Hamamatsu UK). All PALM imaging used an Olympus UAPO 1.45 NA ×150 oil lens with a resulting pixel size of 106 nm. Activation and bleaching steps in each cycle were optimized to ensure a sparse distribution of single molecules were activated and bleached during each cycle. PALM data analysis was performed using Matlab routines written by Dr. Samuel Hess (Maine). To determine the mode of munc18-syntaxin binding employed in our experiments we needed to design targeted mutations to disrupt each type of interaction specifically. The approach we used was to examine the amino acid sequence of members of the SM protein family. Evolutionary conservation of amino acids, with relation to the three-dimensional protein structure is indicative of an essential function (34Madabushi S. Yao H. Marsh M. Kristensen D.M. Philippi A. Sowa M.E. Lichtarge O. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 316: 139-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). We aligned the amino acid sequence of 191 predicted SM proteins, mapping the degree of conservation on to the crystal structure of munc18 bound to syntaxin1 (27Burkhardt P. Hattendorf D.A. Weis W.I. Fasshauer D. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 923-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). This approach highlighted the amino acids lining the mode 2/3 binding pocket on munc18 and indicated Glu132 and Asp112 (expected to form hydrogen bonds to the N-terminal motif of syntaxin1) and Ile127 (forming one side of the hydrophobic pocket (27Burkhardt P. Hattendorf D.A. Weis W.I. Fasshauer D. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 923-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar)) as being potentially important for this interaction. We constructed two-point mutations for each amino acid (I127A/I127F, E132A/E132K, and D112A/D112K) to investigate their individual contributions in binding syntaxin and the downstream functional role this binding mode could play. To investigate the impact of these changes on syntaxin1-munc18 interactions in vitro it was necessary to be able to isolate mode 1 and mode 2/3 interactions biochemically. We have reported previously that truncation of the N terminus of syntaxin (GST-Syx7 261) can disrupt mode 2/3 interactions (26Rickman C. Medine C.N. Bergmann A. Duncan R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12097-12103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). To perturb mode 1 interactions we designed truncations of the SNARE helix of syntaxin based on the close interaction of this region with munc18 in mode 1 interactions (27Burkhardt P. Hattendorf D.A. Weis W.I. Fasshauer D. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 923-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Two truncations were used: removal of the syntaxin C terminus up to the ionic layer of the SNARE helix (GST-Syx1–225) and a complete removal of the SNARE helix (GST-Syx1–213). To examine the influence of these mutations and their combinations, we incubated purified proteins with fresh brain lysate. Upon incubation, native munc18 readily bound to wild type syntaxin (GST-Syx1 261; Fig. 1B). Truncation of the N terminus of syntaxin (GST-Syx7–261) caused a small decrease in the amount of bound munc18 detected as a result of loss of mode 2/3 binding. Munc18 binding following truncation of syntaxin to the ionic layer (GST-Syx1–225) was also detected but at decreased levels as a result of loss of mode 1 binding. No interactions were detected following removal of the whole SNARE helix of syntaxin (GST-Syx1–213). Importantly, the combination of the N-terminal truncation and the ionic layer truncation (GST-Syx7–225) resulted in the complete removal of detectable munc18 binding through ablation of both binding modes. Mode 2/3 binding to GST-Syx1–225 was also eliminated in a high salt buffer, highlighting the considerable ionic nature of this interaction in contrast to the mode1 interaction (GST-Syx7–261). To determine whether our munc18 point mutations disrupted specifically mode 2/3 interaction with syntaxin1, we incubated bacterial lysates containing His-tagged munc18, and mutant forms, with GST-syntaxin immobilized on beads (Fig. 1C and supplemental Fig. 1). GST-Syx7–261 was used to examine the impact of munc18 mutations on mode 1 binding and GST-Syx1–225 to assess perturbations of mode 2/3 binding. Mutations I127A, I127F, and E132A caused a reduction in the level of mode 2/3 binding compared with wild type syntaxin in vitro. To determine whether these mutants acted in a similar manner in a cellular context, we transfected munc18-silenced cells (KD43) (10Arunachalam L. Han L. Tassew N.G. He Y. Wang L. Xie L. Fujita Y.

Cell. 2008; 19: 722-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) with siRNA-resistant fluorescent fusion proteins of munc18 and the above mutations in combination syntaxin1a. Fluorescence intensity co-variance analysis in these cells confirmed that the three mutants that disrupted mode 2/3 interaction in vitro also had a significant effect on syntaxin intracellular localization, with munc18[I127A] having the largest influence (Fig. 1D and supplemental Fig. 2). For clarity in this paper, we therefore focus on this specific mutant to address downstream functional contributions; data describing all the other mutants we tested in all assays are in supplemental figures. To determine where mode 2/3 interaction is predominately utilized within a cellular environment, we employed FLIM. FLIM quantifies the fluorescence lifetime of a fluorophore and can be a quantitative measure of Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between proximal (within 5 nm) acceptor and donor molecules (35Medine C.N. McDonald A. Bergmann A. Duncan R.R. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2007; 70: 420-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). As a control, mCer syntaxin was expressed with unfused munc18 and EYFP, in KD43 PC-12 cells (supplemental Fig. 1; munc18-1-silenced cells were used for every cell-based experiment). This analysis revealed a principally plasma membrane localization of syntaxin with some labeling of intracellular compartments, as reported previously (9Medine C.N. Rickman C. Chamberlain L.H. Duncan R.R. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 4407-4415Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 26Rickman C. Medine C.N. Bergmann A. Duncan R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12097-12103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). FLIM analysis showed a statistically significant quenching of the mean fluorescence lifetime of donor mCer-Syx1–266 from 2310 ± 151 ps (mean ± S.E., n = 10), in the absence of a proximal FRET acceptor, to 1563 ± 65 ps (mean ± S.E., n = 6) in the presence of EYFP-munc18 (Fig. 1e), indicative of FRET. This confirmed that munc18 and syntaxin interact on the plasma membrane. Munc18[I127A] resulted in significantly less quenching of the donor fluorescence lifetime to 2062 ± 70 ps (mean ± S.E., t test, p < 0.05, n = 5; Fig. 1e and supplemental Fig. 1), indicating either reduced interaction or altered conformation of interaction. Plotting every pixel in the image but assigning donor fluorescence lifetime value a color revealed that areas on the plasma membrane contained significantly less energy transfer, confirming that mode 2/3 interaction predominates at the cell surface (Fig. 1E). Having disrupted mode 2/3 interactions at the plasma membrane, we set out to determine whether this specific effect resulted in, or was caused by, a spatial reorganization of munc18 molecules. Munc18 has been localized on a gross microscopic scale to the plasma membrane of secretory cells several times (9Medine C.N. Rickman C. Chamberlain L.H. Duncan R.R. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 4407-4415Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 26Rickman C. Medine C.N. Bergmann A. Duncan R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12097-12103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 36Zilly F.E. S⊘rensen J.B. Jahn R. Lang T. PLoS Biol. 2006; 4: e330Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), with this membrane association mediated principally by interaction with syntaxin (26Rickman C. Medine C.N. Bergmann A. Duncan R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12097-12103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). However, diffraction-limited imaging has a maximum lateral resolution of 178 nm (measured in our system) (9Medine C.N. Rickman C. Chamberlain L.H. Duncan R.R. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 4407-4415Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), too low to determine anything other than massive reorganization if this interaction is disrupted. To localize single munc18 molecules across the plasma membrane we employed superresolution total internal reflection fluorescence PALM. This involved the serial activation, localization, and photodestruction of photoactivatable molecules at the plasma membrane (Fig. 2). Both wild type munc18 and munc18[I127A] exhibited a similar spatial distribution. Thus, targeted munc18 mutation to disrupt mode 2/3 interactions resulted only in a reorganization of interaction with syntaxin with no change in the spatial molecular pattern at the plasma membrane. We previously observed that phosphorylation of serine 14 in syntaxin disrupted mode 2/3 interaction with munc18, resulting in the increased average immobilization of secretory vesicles, rendering them unable to support membrane fusion (21Rickman C. Duncan R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 3965-3972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This agrees well with the notion that vesicular mobility is enhanced directly preceding fusion (37Degtyar V.E. Allersma M.W. Axelrod D. Holz R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 15929-15934Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether mutation of the munc18 hydrophobic pocket resulted in similar downstream effects, specifically on single vesicle kinetics and their fusion capabilities. To achieve this we again employed TIRFM to attain both high spatial and temporal resolution at the single-vesicle level (38Axelrod D. Traffic. 2001; 2: 764-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). Employing our mutant proteins, alongside fluorescently labeled vesicles (NPY mCherry), we were able to measure multiple parameters at physiological temperatures. These analyses revealed that disrupting mode 2/3 interaction (munc18[127A]) significantly restricted average vesicle displacement, speed, and track length compared with wild type munc18 in rescued silenced cells (Fig. 3, A–C and supplemental Fig. 3). To examine whether this change in vesicle behavior affected downstream membrane fusion, we next analyzed single-vesicle fusion events, using our pH-sensitive EGFP-NPY probe (Fig. 4A) (21Rickman C. Duncan R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 3965-3972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In the single-vesicle fusion assay, secretion is observed as a rapid transient increase in fluorescence intensity due to a change in the pH of the microenvironment upon fusion. In the absence of munc18, stimulated exocytosis was not significantly different from basal secretion in both population growth hormone release assays (data not shown) and in single-vesicle fusion TIRFM experiments, indicating a requirement for munc18 in exocytosis as observed previously (19Verhage M. Maia A.S. Plomp J.J. Brussaard A.B. Heeroma J.H. Vermeer H. Toonen R.F. Hammer R.E. van den Berg T.K. Missler M. Geuze H.J. Südhof T.C.
