https://openalex.org/W2026804779,"A smectic liquid-crystal phase made from achiral molecules with bent cores was found to have fluid layers that exhibit two spontaneous symmetry-breaking instabilities: polar molecular orientational ordering about the layer normal and molecular tilt. These instabilities combine to form a chiral layer structure with a handedness that depends on the sign of the tilt. The bulk states are either antiferroelectric-racemic, with the layer polar direction and handedness alternating in sign from layer to layer, or antiferroelectric-chiral, which is of uniform layer handedness. Both states exhibit an electric field-induced transition from antiferroelectric to ferroelectric."
https://openalex.org/W2092759765,"Caspases are a family of cysteine proteases implicated in the biochemical and morphological changes that occur during apoptosis (programmed cell death). The loop domain of Bcl-2 is cleaved at Asp 34 by caspase-3 (CPP32) in vitro, in cells overexpressing caspase-3, and after induction of apoptosis by Fas ligation and interleukin-3 withdrawal. The carboxyl-terminal Bcl-2 cleavage product triggered cell death and accelerated Sindbis virus–induced apoptosis, which was dependent on the BH3 homology and transmembrane domains of Bcl-2. Inhibitor studies indicated that cleavage of Bcl-2 may further activate downstream caspases and contribute to amplification of the caspase cascade. Cleavage-resistant mutants of Bcl-2 had increased protection from interleukin-3 withdrawal and Sindbis virus–induced apoptosis. Thus, cleavage of Bcl-2 by caspases may ensure the inevitability of cell death."
https://openalex.org/W2126043496,"Pin1 is an essential and conserved mitotic peptidyl-prolyl isomerase (PPIase) that is distinct from members of two other families of conventional PPIases, cyclophilins and FKBPs (FK-506 binding proteins). In response to their phosphorylation during mitosis, Pin1 binds and regulates members of a highly conserved set of proteins that overlaps with antigens recognized by the mitosis-specific monoclonal antibody MPM-2. Pin1 is here shown to be a phosphorylation-dependent PPIase that specifically recognizes the phosphoserine-proline or phosphothreonine-proline bonds present in mitotic phosphoproteins. Both Pin1 and MPM-2 selected similar phosphorylated serine-proline–containing peptides, providing the basis for the specific interaction between Pin1 and MPM-2 antigens. Pin1 preferentially isomerized proline residues preceded by phosphorylated serine or threonine with up to 1300-fold selectivity compared with unphosphorylated peptides. Pin1 may thus regulate mitotic progression by catalyzing sequence-specific and phosphorylation-dependent proline isomerization."

https://openalex.org/W1977428203,"Twenty-four molecular dynamics trajectories of chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 provide a direct demonstration of the diversity of unfolding pathways. Comparison with experiments suggests that the transition state region for folding and unfolding occurs early with only 25 percent of the native contacts and that the root-mean-square deviations between contributing structures can be as large as 15 angstroms. Nevertheless, a statistically preferred unfolding pathway emerges from the simulations; disruption of tertiary interactions between the helix and a two-stranded portion of the beta sheet is the primary unfolding event. The results suggest a synthesis of the ""new"" and the classical view of protein folding with a preferred pathway on a funnel-like average energy surface."

When incubated with solubilized PAEC plasma membrane proteins, eNOS-specific antibody immunoprecipitates CAT1-mediated arginine transport. These results document the existence of a caveolar complex between CAT1 and eNOS in PAEC that provides a mechanism for the directed delivery of substrate arginine to eNOS. Direct transfer of extracellular arginine to membrane-bound eNOS accounts for the “arginine paradox” and explains why caveolar localization of eNOS is required for optimal nitric oxide production by endothelial cells.

Pulmonary endothelial cells generate NO from arginine via the catalytic action of an NADPH-requiring, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent NO synthase (referred to as eNOS, ecNOS, or type III NOS) that is membrane-associated (1Moncada S.

Consequently, eNOS should be saturated in these cells, and therefore increasing the extracellular arginine should not increase NO production any further. However, a number of in vitro and in vivo studies indicate that NO production by vascular endothelial cells under physiological conditions can be increased by extracellular arginine, despite a saturating intracellular arginine concentration (4Aisaka K. Gross S.S. Griffith O.W. Levi R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 163: 710-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 5Cooke J.P. Andon N.A. Girerd X.J. Hirsch A.T.

Physiol. 1992; 263: L194-L200Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, a recent report by Arnal et al. (18Arnal J.-F. Munzel T. Venema R.C. James N.L. Bai C.L. Mitch W.E. Harrison D.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2565-2572Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) demonstrates that the intracellular concentration of arginine in endothelial cells can be varied over 100-fold without changing NO production. This observation,i.e. that extracellular arginine administration seems to drive NO production even when intracellular levels of arginine are available in excess, has been termed the “arginine paradox” and cannot be explained based on the available data (19Kurz S. Harrison D.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 369-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). One paradigm that would explain this observation is that in endothelial cells the intracellular arginine is sequestered in one or more pools that are poorly, if at all, accessible to eNOS, whereas extracellular arginine transported into the cell is preferentially delivered to eNOS. Under this paradigm, a plasma membrane arginine transporter must be in close spatial alignment with or directly linked to the eNOS protein. Arginine transport is mediated by several independent transport activities in mammalian cells (20White M.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 822: 355-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 21Malandro M.S. Kilberg M.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 305-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 22Closs E.I. Amino Acids (Vienna). 1996; 11: 193-208PubMed Google Scholar). The distribution and relative contribution of each of these transport activities to the total arginine uptake by a particular cell type varies widely due to cell-specific expression of the corresponding genes. Arginine transport into endothelial cells has been investigated by several laboratories (23Kilberg M.S. Stevens B.R. Novak D.A. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1993; 13: 137-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 24Bogle R.G. Baydoun A.R. Pearson J.D. Mann G.E. J. Physiol.

Transport into porcine pulmonary artery endothelial cells (PAEC) is mediated by only two agencies (26Greene B. Pacitti A.J. Souba W.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: L351-L356PubMed Google Scholar, 27McDonald K.K. Rouhani R. Handlogten M.E. Block E.R. Griffith O.W. Allison R.D. Kilberg M.S. Biochim. Biophys.

System y+has been extensively characterized in PAEC (28Zharikov S.I. Block E.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; (in press)Google Scholar) and is responsible for 60–80% of total carrier-mediated arginine uptake (26Greene B. Pacitti A.J. Souba W.W. Am. J.

In 1991, two laboratories independently documented that the native biologic function of the previously cloned murine ecotropic retroviral receptor was System y+ transport activity (29Kim J.W. Class E.I. Albritton L.M. Cunningham J.M. Nature. 1991; 352: 725-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 30Wang H. Kavanaugh M.P. North R.A. Kabat D. Nature. 1991; 352: 729-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). The mRNA and corresponding protein, termed CAT1, are expressed in a wide variety of cells, with the notable exception of liver (29Kim J.W. Class E.I. Albritton L.M. Cunningham J.M.

Woodard et al. (33Woodard M.H. Dunn W.A. Laine R.O. Malandro M. McMahon R. Simell O. Block E.R. Kilberg M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: E817-E824PubMed Google Scholar) documented the expression of CAT1 within the plasma membrane of PAEC by immunohistochemistry. Interestingly, that study illustrated that the CAT1 transporter protein was not uniformly distributed over the cell surface but instead was concentrated in randomly distributed clusters within the plasma membrane. The CAT1 transporter-containing clusters could be dispersed by nocodazole-induced disruption of the microtubule network, but they reformed within a few hours after removal of the drug. Recently, Kizhatil and Albritton 2K. Kizhatil and L. M. Albritton (1997)J. Virol. 71, 7145–7156. have confirmed the cytoskeletal association of CAT1 and demonstrated that the clusters are required for retrovirus infectivity. With regard to micro-domains within the plasma membrane, considerable information has been published regarding the presence of plasma membrane regions referred to as caveolae (34Parton R.G. Curr.

This specialized membrane region contains one of a family of structural proteins called caveolins, as well as numerous signaling proteins and a high cholesterol content. Within endothelial cells a significant portion of eNOS is localized to caveolae (9Liu J. Garcia-Cardena G. Sessa W.C.

Chem. 1996; 271: 27237-27240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar) showed that caveolin and membrane-bound eNOS co-localize in lung microvascular endothelial cells and that antibodies against one could be used to immunoprecipitate the other, strongly suggesting that eNOS is complexed with caveolin (41Garcia-Cardena G. Fan R. Stern D.F. Liu J. Sessa W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27237-27240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Interestingly, for reasons that were previously not known, caveolar localization optimizes the ability of eNOS to produce NO (9Liu J. Garcia-Cardena G. Sessa W.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13277-13281Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 42Feron O. Belhassen L. Kobzik L. Smith T.W. Kelly R.A. Michel T. J. Biol.

We hypothesize that in PAEC the CAT1 transporter-containing clusters represent plasma membrane caveolae. We also propose that co-localization of CAT1-mediated arginine transport and eNOS would provide an efficient mechanism for delivery of substrate for NO synthesis, perhaps even in a direct manner. The following experiments document co-localization of CAT1 and eNOS within PAEC caveolae. PAEC were obtained from the main pulmonary artery of 6–7-month-old pigs and were cultured for 3–7 passages as described by Block et al. (12Block E.R. Herrera H. Couch M. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: L574-L580PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were cultured on glass coverslips to a density of approximately 70% and then subjected to immunohistochemistry using the incubation conditions and methodology described by Woodard et al. (33Woodard M.H. Dunn W.A. Laine R.O. Malandro M. McMahon R. Simell O. Block E.R. Kilberg M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: E817-E824PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse monoclonal antibodies against caveolin and eNOS were obtained from Transduction Laboratory (Lexington, KY). Production and characterization of a rabbit polyclonal antiserum against a predicted extracellular loop of the murine CAT1 arginine transporter has been described previously (33Woodard M.H. Dunn W.A. Laine R.O. Malandro M. McMahon R. Simell O. Block E.R. Kilberg M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: E817-E824PubMed Google Scholar). FITC-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) was used to detect anti-CAT1, whereas Texas Red-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Aurora, OH) was used to detect anti-caveolin and anti-eNOS. Fluorescently stained cells were analyzed by deconvolution microscopy as described originally by Agard et al. (43Agard D.A. Hiraoka Y. Shaw P. Sedat J.W. Methods Cell Biol. 1989; 30: 353-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). Three-dimensional light microscopy (LM) data collection and computational removal of out-of-focus information used an integrated, cooled CCD-based, fluorescence LM data collection, processing, and visualization workstation described in detail elsewhere (Ref. 44Hiraoka Y. Swedlow J.R. Paddy M.R. Agard D.A. Sedat J.W. Semin. Cell Biol. 1991; 2: 153-165PubMed Google Scholar; Applied Precision, Inc., Mercer Island, WA). Three-dimensional data sets were processed as has been described previously (43Agard D.A. Hiraoka Y. Shaw P. Sedat J.W. Methods Cell Biol. 1989; 30: 353-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar, 45Paddy M.R. Belmont A.S. Saumweber H. Agard D.A. Sedat J.W. Cell. 1990; 62: 89-106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). LM images were viewed using an integrated modeling program (PRISM) specially designed for analyzing complex three-dimensional biological structures (46Chen H. Hughes D.D. Chan T. Sedat J.W. Agard D.A. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 56-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Plasma membrane vesides were prepared by sucrose gradient centrifugation as described by Teitel (47Teitel J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 128: 329-336Google Scholar) and modified by Bhat and Block (48Bhat G.B. Block E.R. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1990; 3: 363-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 49Bhat G.B. Block E.R. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1992; 6: 633-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Plasma membrane proteins were solubilized by the method described by Fafournouxet al. (50Fafournoux P. Dudenhausen E.E. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4805-4811Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The solubilized proteins in the supernatant were precipitated by incubation with 20% polyethylene glycol (PEG-8000) at 4 °C for 20 min. Immunodepletion of CAT1 transporter was performed using the protocol of Tamarappoo et al. (51Tamarappoo B.K. Handlogten M.E. Laine R.O. Serrano M.A. Dugan J. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2370-2374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, a 1-ml aliquot of goat anti-mouse IgG covalently liked to agarose beads (Sigma) was incubated for 1 h with 20 μg of monoclonal eNOS antibody (Transduction Laboratories) on ice and centrifuged, after which the supernatant was discarded. The agarose beads were then washed once with STAB buffer (20% glycerol, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2% sodium cholate, 0.25% asolectin, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) and mixed with solubilized proteins resuspended in STAB buffer. After incubation for 1 h on ice, the beads were centrifuged, the supernatant was removed, and the proteins were reconstituted into proteoliposomes. Reconstitution of proteins into proteoliposomes was performed following the protocol of Fafournoux et al. (50Fafournoux P. Dudenhausen E.E. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4805-4811Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and transport assays were performed as described previously (28Zharikov S.I. Block E.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; (in press)Google Scholar). Briefly, plasma membrane vesicles or proteoliposomes (20 μg/30 μl) were added to 270 μl of external solution containing 140 mm NaSCN, l mm MgSO4, 10 mm HEPES-Tris, pH 7.4, and 50 μm[3H]l-arginine or 50 μm[3H]glutamine. After incubation for 3 min at 37 °C, reactions were terminated by the addition of 5 ml of ice-cold 140 mm NaC1 (stop solution) followed by filtration through glass fiber Whatman GF/C filters presoaked in 0.3% polyethylenimine to decrease the nonspecific absorption of [3H]l-arginine or glutamine. The filters were washed four times with 5 ml of stop solution, dried, and counted using liquid scintillation spectrometry. Zero time blank values (membrane vesicles or proteoliposomes added after stop solution) were subtracted from all experimental values. Localization of CAT1 in several cell types revealed localized transporter-containing clusters within the plasma membrane when analyzed by epifluorescence microscopy (33Woodard M.H. Dunn W.A. Laine R.O. Malandro M. McMahon R. Simell O. Block E.R. Kilberg M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: E817-E824PubMed Google Scholar). Fig.1 illustrates this staining pattern analyzed at much greater resolution before (Fig. 1 A) and after (Fig. 1 B) the use of deconvolution microscopy technology (43Agard D.A. Hiraoka Y. Shaw P. Sedat J.W. Methods Cell Biol. 1989; 30: 353-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar, 44Hiraoka Y. Swedlow J.R. Paddy M.R. Agard D.A. Sedat J.W. Semin.

Biol. 1996; 116: 56-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). As reported previously, the CAT1 transporter is not uniformly distributed over the entire cell surface. Instead, the cell surface has discrete regions that contain a high transporter content. Staining with the anti-CAT1 transporter antibody is completely inhibited by preadsorption of the antibody with the corresponding peptide antigen (Fig. 1 C), whereas incubation of the antibody with nonantigen peptide sequences from within the CAT1 transporter does not block cell staining (33Woodard M.H. Dunn W.A. Laine R.O. Malandro M. McMahon R. Simell O. Block E.R. Kilberg M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: E817-E824PubMed Google Scholar). Immunohistochemistry of the PAEC with antibodies specific for caveolin also documented intensely staining plasma membrane-associated clusters, consistent with proposed caveolae structure and localization (Fig.2 A). Co-staining of the PAEC with anti-CAT1 (Fig. 2 B) and anti-caveolin antibodies resulted in significant overlap with regard to localization of the two proteins (Fig. 2 C). It is clear from these results that the majority of the clusters containing the arginine transporter coincide with caveolae in the PAEC plasma membrane. Furthermore, in PAEC we have confirmed, as reported previously by others (41Garcia-Cardena G. Fan R. Stern D.F. Liu J. Sessa W.C. J. Biol.

The presence of the CAT1 arginine transporter in plasma membrane caveolae raised the possibility that CAT1 and eNOS may be co-localized in a caveolar complex to facilitate NO synthesis. Therefore, PAEC were subjected to immunohistochemistry to test for co-localization of CAT1 and eNOS. A significant portion of the detectable plasma membrane-associated eNOS was clustered within random regions over the cell surface (Fig. 3 A). As mentioned above, these eNOS-containing micro-domains have been identified as caveolae, and the eNOS present can be co-immunoprecipitated with anti-caveolin antibodies (41Garcia-Cardena G. Fan R. Stern D.F. Liu J. Sessa W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27237-27240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 42Feron O. Belhassen L. Kobzik L. Smith T.W. Kelly R.A.

The CAT1 arginine transporter-containing clusters were similar in distribution (Fig. 3 B), and when the stained regions were analyzed for co-localization of CAT1 and eNOS, a significant degree of overlap was clearly revealed (Fig. 3 C). Co-localization of the CAT1 arginine transporter and eNOS within caveolae is consistent with the proposal that these membrane micro-domains are a site for concentrating proteins involved in signaling (34Parton R.G. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1996; 8: 542-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 35Simionescu M. Simionescu N. Ryan U.S. Pulmonary Endothelium in Health and Disease.

Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 231-235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). However, the present observations also raise the intriguing possibility that the CAT1 arginine transporter and eNOS are physically associated. Such a complex might provide a mechanism for directed delivery or even channeling of newly acquired extracellular arginine to eNOS for NO synthesis. Selective delivery of transported arginine to membrane-bound eNOS could explain the arginine paradox discussed above (19Kurz S. Harrison D.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 369-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). As a more direct test for a complex between CAT1 and eNOS, PAEC plasma membrane arginine transport activity was detergent solubilized and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-eNOS antibody (50Fafournoux P. Dudenhausen E.E. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4805-4811Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using the proteins in the immunoprecipitate supernatant to reconstitute proteoliposomes (51Tamarappoo B.K. Handlogten M.E. Laine R.O. Serrano M.A. Dugan J. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2370-2374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) provided an assay to check for anti-eNOS-dependent immunodepletion of arginine transport. Immunodepletion with control mouse IgG caused no loss of reconstitutable arginine transport, whereas the anti-eNOS monoclonal antibody caused immunoprecipitation of 73% of the Na+-independent arginine transport (TableI). To establish that the anti-eNOS did not result in immunodepletion of arginine transport in a nonspecific manner, glutamine transport was monitored in the reconstituted proteoliposomes after immunoprecipitation with control and anti-eNOS IgG (Table I). No immunodepletion of glutamine transport was observed. These data document that a protein-protein association exists between the CAT1 arginine transporter and membrane-bound eNOS in PAEC.Table IImmunodepletion of CAT1-mediated arginine transport activity by anti-eNOS antibodyImmunoprecipitation prior to reconstitutionTransport velocityControlpmol · mg −1 protein · 3 min −1%Arginine transport No antibody3511 ± 50 Mouse IgG4084 ± 44100 Anti-eNOS IgG1113 ± 171-ap < 0.001 versus no antibody or non-immune mouse IgG, n = 3 independent experiments.27Glutamine transport Mouse IgG4026 ± 176100 Anti-eNOS IgG4368 ± 706109The saturable, Na+-independent arginine transport activity in PAEC vesicles has been characterized previously and is mediated primarily by the CAT1 transporter given that neither b0,+ nor y+L are detectable in these assays (28Zharikov S.I.

It is likely that this eNOS-caveolin interaction is responsible for positioning eNOS adjacent to other caveolar proteins such as CAT1 to form a highly efficient signal transduction cascade and to optimize production of the vital signaling molecule NO. Our results demonstrate that the CAT1 arginine transporter is localized to plasma membrane caveolae of PAEC and that treatment of PAEC plasma membrane vesicles with an antibody directed against eNOS depletes CAT1-mediated arginine transport. Taken together, these results document the existence of a caveolar complex between the CAT1 arginine transporter and eNOS in PAEC. Association of the CAT1 arginine transporter and eNOS in PAEC provides a mechanism for the directed delivery of substrate to eNOS and, for mammalian cells, represents the first example of a functional complex between a plasma membrane transport protein and an enzyme. Such directed delivery of extracellular arginine to eNOS would account for the arginine paradox described earlier (19Kurz S. Harrison D.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 369-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and would also explain the observation by Liu et al. (9Liu J. Garcia-Cardena G. Sessa W.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13277-13281Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) that caveolar localization of eNOS is required for optimal NO production by eNOS."

https://openalex.org/W1990238443,"Two laccase isoenzymes (POXA1 and POXA2) produced by Pleurotus ostreatus were purified and fully characterized. POXA1 and POXA2 are monomeric glycoproteins with 3 and 9% carbohydrate content, molecular masses of about 61 and 67 kDa by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, of about 54 and 59 kDa by gel filtration in native conditions, and of 61 kDa by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry (only for POXA1) and pI values of 6.7 and 4.0, respectively.

The lack of typical absorbance at 600 nm allows its classification as a “white” laccase. White rot Basidiomycetes are microorganisms able to efficiently degrade lignin. However the different degradation degree of lignin with respect to other wood components depends very much on the environmental conditions and the fungal species involved. It is now clear that there is not a unique mechanism to achieve the process of lignin degradation and that the enzymatic machinery of the various microorganisms are different (1Hatakka A. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 13: 125-135Crossref Scopus (880) Google Scholar). Pleurotus ostreatus belongs to a subclass of lignin-degrading microorganisms that produce laccases, manganese peroxidases, and veratryl alcohol oxidases but no lignin peroxidases. The oxidative enzymes (laccase, manganese peroxidase) do catalyze the formation of radical intermediates from high molecular weight lignins, but the intermediates produced can recondense, shifting back the reaction course (2Hammel K.E. Jensen Jr., K.A. Mozuch M.D. Landucci L.L. Tien M. Pease E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12274-12281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been shown that prevention of the repolymerization is achieved by the reduction of the formed radicals; this reducing process is carried out by some flavin adenine dinucleotide-dependent oxidases such as veratryl alcohol oxidase (3Marzullo L. Cannio R. Giardina P. Santini M.T. Sannia G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3823-3827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Laccases and manganese peroxidases are able to oxidize only phenolic residues of lignin, whereas lignin peroxidases have been shown to be effective in the oxidation of the nonphenolic residues of the polymer (4Kirk T.K. Farrell R.L. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1987; 41: 465-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (2049) Google Scholar). However, in the presence of mediators, the substrate range of laccases can be extended (5Bourbonnais R. Paice M.G. FEBS Lett. 1990; 267: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar). Laccases have been isolated from various fungi (6Yaropolov A.I. Skorobogatko O.V. Vartanov S.S. Varfolomeyev S.D. Appl. Biochem. Biotechnol. 1994; 49: 257-280Crossref Scopus (609) Google Scholar). They belong to the class of the blue oxidases containing 4 copper atoms/molecule distributed in three different copper binding sites (7Reinhammar B. Malstrom B.G. Spiro T.G. Copper Proteins (Metal Ions in Biology). John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1981: 109-149Google Scholar, 8Solomon E.I. Sundaram U.M. Machonkin T.E. Chem. Rev. 1997; 96: 2563-2605Crossref Scopus (3161) Google Scholar). The type 1 (or blue copper) site is responsible for the intense blue color of the enzymes, presumably due to a ligand-to-metal charge transfer absorption involving cysteine sulfur and Cu(II). The type 2 copper exhibits lower visible absorbance, and the type 3 site incorporates two copper centers and is responsible for a shoulder near 330 nm in the absorbance spectrum of native laccase. All these copper ions are apparently involved in the catalytic mechanism. The laccase reduces oxygen to water and simultaneously performs a one electron oxidation of many aromatic substrates (polyphenols, methoxy-substituted monophenols, aromatic amines, etc.). The enzyme is present in multiple isoforms in almost all fungal species, including P. ostreatus (9Giardina P. Cannio R. Martirani L. Marzullo L. Palmieri G. Sannia G. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1995; 61: 2408-2413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Studies of the genes coding for these enzymes in P. ostreatus have led to the identification of two different genes and two corresponding cDNAs. One of these genes codes for the isoenzyme produced most abundantly under all the growth conditions examined (10Giardina P. Aurilia V. Cannio R. Marzullo L. Amoresano A. Siciliano R. Pucci P. Sannia G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 508-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In the present paper, we report the purification and the physico-chemical and catalytic properties of two different laccase isoenzymes isolated from P. ostreatus. One of these proteins shows peculiar differences with regard to copper content. This is the first laccase having 2 zinc, 1 iron, and only 1 copper atom/molecule. White rot fungus P. ostreatus (strain Florida) was maintained through periodic transfer at 4 °C on potato dextrose agar plates (Difco) in the presence of 0.5% yeast extract (Difco). Incubations were carried out at 25 °C in the dark by preinoculating 300 ml of potato dextrose broth (24 g/l) containing 0.5% yeast extract in 500 ml shaken flasks with the P. ostreatus mycelia. 50 ml of a 5-day-old culture were transferred in 1 liter flasks containing 450 ml of broth. The cultures were incubated in the dark at 25 °C on a rotary shaker (100 rev/min). At different incubation times, the medium was collected and filtered through gauze. Proteins were precipitated from the filtered medium by the addition of (NH4)2SO4 up to 80% saturation at 4 °C and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min. The precipitate was resuspended in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, and extensively dialyzed against the same buffer. The sample was again centrifuged, and the supernatant, concentrated on an Amicon PM-10 membrane, was loaded on DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) column (1,5 × 40 cm) equilibrated with the phosphate buffer. The column was washed at a flow rate of 30 ml/h with 400 ml of buffer, and a 0–0.5 m NaCl linear gradient (500 ml) was applied. Fractions containing phenol oxidase activity were pooled and concentrated on an Amicon PM-10 membrane. The phenol oxidase POXA1 was then equilibrated in 0.1 mcitrate buffer, pH 5 (buffer A), with a Centricon 30 microconcentrator and loaded onto an ion exchange Mono S HR 5/5 column in fast protein liquid chromatography (Pharmacia) equilibrated with the same buffer. The enzyme was eluted with a linear gradient (buffer B: 0.1m citrate, pH 5, 0.3 m NaCl; gradient:t = 0, %B = 0; t = 10 min, %B = 0; t = 30 min, %B = 80;t = 35 min, %B = 80). The active fractions were pooled and desalted. The phenol oxidase POXA2 was equilibrated in 0.02 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7 (buffer A), and loaded onto a cationic exchange Mono Q HR 5/5 column in a fast protein liquid chromatography system equilibrated with the same buffer. The enzyme was eluted with a linear gradient (buffer B, 0.02 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7, 0.5 m NaCl; gradient: t = 0, %B = 0;t = 10 min, %B = 0; t = 60 min, %B = 60; t = 65 min, %B = 80). The active fractions were pooled and desalted. Phenol oxidase activity was assayed at 25 °C using 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) 1The abbreviations used are: ABTS, 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid); DMP, 2,6-dimethoxyphenol; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis., guaiacol, 2,6-dimethoxyphenol (DMP), and syringaldazine as substrates as follows. (a) The assay mixture contained 2 mm ABTS and 0.1 m sodium citrate buffer, pH 3.0. Oxidation of ABTS was followed by absorbance increase at 420 nm (ε = 36,000m−1 cm−1). Enzyme activity was expressed in international units (IU). (b) The assay mixture contained 10 mm guaiacol, and the McIlvaine's citrate-phosphate buffer adjusted to pH 6.0. Oxidation was followed by the absorbance increase at 460 nm. One unit of activity is the amount of enzyme producing a 1.0 A increase/min. (c) The assay mixture contained 1 mm DMP and the McIlvaine's buffer adjusted to pH 5 for POXA1 and POXC isoenzyme and pH 6.5 for POXA2 isoenzyme. Oxidation of DMP was followed by an absorbance increase at 477 nm (ε = 14,800 m−1cm−1). Enzyme activity was expressed in IU. (d) The assay mixture contained 0.5 mm syringaldazine (dissolved in ethanol) and 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6. Oxidation of syringaldazine was followed by an absorbance increase at 525 nm (ε = 65,000 m−1 cm−1). Enzyme activity was expressed in IU. Deoxygenase activity was assayed at 30 °C using the protocatechuic acid as substrate as follow. The reaction mixture contained 0.6 mm protocatechuic acid and 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 8.0. After 10 min of incubation at 30 °C, the reaction was stopped by adding 0.5 ml of 30% perchloric acid. In the control, perchloric acid was added at zero time. The deoxygenation of protocatechuic acid to β-carboxy-cis,cis-muconic acid was followed by an absorbance decrease at 290 nm (11Wojtas-Wasilewska M. Trojanowski J. Luterek J. Acta Biochim. Pol. 1983; 30: 291-302PubMed Google Scholar). Tyrosinase activity was assayed at 25 °C using 3,4-dihydroxy-dl-phenylalanine as substrate. The assay mixture contained 0.2 mm4-dihydroxy-dl-phenylalanine and 0.1 sodium phosphate, pH 6. The oxidation of substrate was followed by an absorbance increase at 475 nm (ε = 3,600 m−1 cm−1) (12Fling M. Horowitz N.H. Heinemann F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 2045-2053Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A peroxidase-coupled assay was performed using diaminobenzidine as the peroxidase substrate. The reaction mixture contained 0.1 msodium citrate buffer, pH 5.0, 0.3 milliunits of horse-radish peroxidase, 0.36 mm diaminobenzidine, 2 mm ABTS in a total volume of 1 ml. The oxidation of diaminobenzidine was followed by an absorbance increase at 460 nm (13Cohen H.J. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 53: 208-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Phenol oxidase activity as a function of pH was measured using a McIlvaine's citrate-phosphate buffer adjusted to different pH levels in the range 2.5–8.0. The same buffer was used to determine the pH stability of the three isoenzymes. The effect of various inhibitors were tested by using ABTS as a substrate and preincubating the isoenzymes for 5 min at room temperature before the addition of substrate. The activity of phenol oxidases toward different substrates was assayed in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, following the absorbance decrease at the indicated wavelengths and at 0.1 mm substrate concentrations: ferulic acid (318 nm), sinapic acid (317 nm), caffeic acid (318 nm), vanillic acid (261 nm), syringic acid (272 nm), 1,4-dihydroxybenzene (289 nm), 1,2-dihydroxybenzene (276 nm), o-diaminobenzene (250 nm), andp-diaminobenzene (250 nm) (14Salas C. Lobos S. Larraı̀n J. Salas L. Cullen D. Vicuña R. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 1995; 21: 323-333PubMed Google Scholar). The absorption spectra of native isoenzymes were determined between 200 and 800 nm at room temperature in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, using a Beckman DU 7500 spectrophotometer (Beckman Instruments). Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay with bovine serum albumin as a standard. The molecular masses of native phenol oxidases were determined with a SMART system (Pharmacia) by using a Superdex 75 PC 3.2/30 gel filtration column (Pharmacia). The column was eluted with 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 150 mm NaCl, and the eluate was monitored at 280 and 220 nm (flow rate 0.05 ml/min). The calibration of the column was performed with bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (45 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), and cytochrome c (12.4 kDa) as standards. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) mass spectra were recorded with a Kratos Kompact MALDI III linear instrument (Kratos Analiticals, Manchster, U.K.). Protein samples (20 pmol) and 1 μl of sinapinic acid, as the matrix, were loaded onto the sample plate, and the spectra were acquired using bovine serum albumin and matrix peaks for external calibration. Digestion of POXA1 And POXA2 laccases was conducted as described by Salas et al. (14Salas C. Lobos S. Larraı̀n J. Salas L. Cullen D. Vicuña R. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 1995; 21: 323-333PubMed Google Scholar): 10 μg of each protein suspended in 30 μl of water were combined with 2 μl of 10% SDS and with 25 μl of a solution containing 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 4% β-mercaptoethanol, and 200 mm EDTA. The resulting mixture was boiled for 5 min, then 1 unit (5 μl) of endoglycosidase F (Boehringer Manneheim) was added, and the reaction mixture was incubated for 24 h at 30 °C. POXA1, POXA2, and control standard glycoproteins (supplied with the Boehringer glycan differentiation kit) (1 μg) were directly spotted onto an Immobilon membrane and detected immunologically after binding to lectins conjugated with digoxigenin following the manufacturer's instructions (Boehringer Manneheim). Lectins used were the following: Galanthus nivaliaagglutinin, specific for terminal mannose; Sambucus nigraagglutinin specific for sialic acid α-2,6-galactose, Maackia amurenais agglutinin, specific for sialic acid α-2,3-galactose; peanut agglutinin, specific for galactose β-1,3-N-acetylglucosamine; and Datura stramonium agglutinin, specific for galactose β-1,4-N-acetylglucosamine. The protein linked to the lectin was detected by a colorimetric reaction. The immunological detection was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Polyacrylamide (9%) gel slab electrophoresis in 0.1% SDS was carried out as described by Laemmli (15Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207018) Google Scholar). For molecular mass determinations, the gel was calibrated with phosphorylase b (94 kDa), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (30 kDa), soybean trypsin inhibitor (20.1 kDa), and α-lactoalbumin (14.4 kDa). Proteins were visualized by silver staining. Analytical isoelectric focusing in the pH range 2.5–7 was performed on 5.0% acrylamide gel slab with a LKB Multiphor electrophoresis system (Pharmacia) following the manufacturer's instructions. Proteins were stained using the silver staining method. Phenol oxidase activity was revealed when incubating the gel at 25 °C in 0.1 mcitrate buffer, pH 3, containing 2 mm ABTS or alternatively, using 10 mm guaiacol as substrates. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of purified phenol oxidases was determined by step-wise Edman degradation with an Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystem 477A pulsed liquid protein sequencer equipped with a 120A high performance liquid chromatography apparatus for the on-line phenylthiohydantoin-amino acid identification. Proteins separated by SDS-PAGE were electroblotted on a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and the excised bands were directly analyzed. Proteolytic digestion was performed by incubating 0.10 mg of the denatured proteins in 0.4% NH4HCO3, 1m urea, pH 8.5, with trypsin (Sigma) at 37 °C overnight. Peptide separation was carried out on a Vydac C18 column (2.1 × 250 mm) eluted with linear gradient (2–70%) of acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. Zinc, copper, and iron contents were determined in triplicate and on different enzyme preparations by atomic absorption spectrometry using a Perkin-Elmer apparatus model 5100 equipped with Zeeman graphite furnace and autosampler. 100 μl of the protein sample (100 μg) were calcined after the addition of 2 ml of an ultrapure mixture of HNO3/H2SO4 1:1 (v/v). The calx was resuspended with 1 ml of 37% HCl and then diluted to 25 ml with ultrapure H2O (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). 20 ml were utilized for polarographic analysis using a Metrohm apparatus model 645 equipped with an mercury electrode. Measures have been performed by the anodic stripping method with a sweep time of 60 s at −1.2 volt potential. A time course of phenol oxidase activity production in P. ostreatus culture broth is shown in Fig. 1 inset. The activity reached a maximum at about 70 h after inoculation and decreased slowly thereafter. Analysis of samples withdrawn from the media at different growth times indicated that the activity was associated mainly with the production of two isoenzymes (named POXA1 and POXC, see below). Moreover, the highest levels of POXA1 production were found to correspond to the maximum of the total phenol oxidase activity in the culture broth. In contrast no significant differences in the relative amount of the POXC isoenzyme were detected at different growth times (Fig. 1). P. ostreatusculture broth, after 70 h of growth, was fractionated by ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by anionic exchange chromatography. As shown in Fig. 2, five different phenol oxidase fractions named POXA1, POXA2, POXB1, POXB2, and POXC were separated. A major peak (POXA1) of phenol oxidase activity and a fraction (POXA2) containing a minor phenol oxidase isoenzyme were recovered with the equilibrating buffer, whereas the other three isoenzymes, POXB1, POXB2, and POXC, were eluted with a saline gradient at approximately 0.17, 0.18, and 0.32 m NaCl, respectively. Fractions corresponding to the POXA1 isoenzyme were collected and further purified by cationic exchange chromatography (Mono S) in a 0.1m citrate buffer at pH 5.0. The enzyme was eluted as a single sharp peak with a saline gradient at about 0.1 mNaCl. The POXA2 isoenzyme was chromatographed on a Mono Q column equilibrated in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and eluted in the fractions corresponding to 0.075 m NaCl. The two purified proteins, POXA1 and POXA2, appeared to be homogeneous when analyzed by SDS-PAGE, isoelectric focusing, and gel filtration chromatography. The two more acidic phenol oxidases, POXB1 and POXB2, were not further purified, whereas the POXC isoenzyme was found to correspond to the previously fully characterized enzyme (10Giardina P.

A summary of the purification procedure is shown in TableI; 85-fold purification was achieved for POXA1 isoenzyme with a final yield of 23%, whereas a lower yield for POXA2 isoenzyme was obtained, probably due to the loss of activity during the purification procedure. The specific activities of POXA1 and POXA2 are 1.3 × 10−4 katal/mg and 1.2 10−5 katal/mg, respectively.Table IPurification of laccases from Pleurotus ostreatus culturesPurification stepTotal activityTotal proteinSpecific activityRecoverykatalmgkatal/mg%Broth1.6 × 10−4105.80.15 × 10−5100NH4(SO4)2precipitate1.1 × 10−4220.51 × 10−570DEAE: POXA14.3 × 10−53.051.4 × 10−526.7 POXA21.3 × 10−60.111.2 × 10−50.8 POXB1 + B20.2 × 10−50.211.0 × 10−51.3 POXC3.4 × 10−50.379.1 × 10−521Mono S: POXA13.7 × 10−50.291.3 × 10−423.2Mono Q: POXA20.9 × 10−60.071.2 × 10−50.5 Open table in a new tab The molecular masses determined by SDS-PAGE analysis were 61 kDa and 67 kDa for POXA1 and POXA2, respectively. A more accurate determination of the POXA1 molecular mass was performed by MALDI mass spectrometry; a broad peak centered at 61,373 Da was obtained. Gel filtration chromatography of the native enzymes allowed the determination of molecular mass of 54 and 59 kDa for POXA1 and POXA2, respectively. These results confirmed the monomeric structure of these proteins. The isoelectric points of POXA1 and POXA2 are 6.7 and 4.0, respectively. POXA1 and POXA2 samples were treated with endoglycosidase F and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Proteins migrated in the gel to positions corresponding to molecular masses of 59 and 61 kDa thus indicating a 3 and 9% carbohydrate content, respectively. POXA1 and POXA2 samples were analyzed for the presence of specific oligosaccharides by lectin binding assays. Both proteins were specifically recognized by G. nivalia agglutinin lectin, which binds to terminal mannose residues, thus suggesting the presence of high mannose-type glycans. Experiments with D. stramonium, S. nigra, M. amurenais, and peanut agglutinin lectins gave negative results, thus indicating the absence of both sialylated complex-type glycans and O-linked oligosaccharide chains containing the structure galactose β-1,3-N-acetylgalactosamine at their nonreducing end. In Fig. 3, the N terminus and three tryptic peptide sequences of POXA1 isoenzyme are shown and aligned with the sequences of other known laccases (9Giardina P. Cannio R. Martirani L. Marzullo L.

Directly sequencing the N terminus of POXA2 from samples either in solution or after blotting on polyvinylidene difluoride membrane were unsuccessful, thus suggesting a blocked N terminus for this isoenzyme. When the UV-visible spectra of the purified enzymes were analyzed and compared with that of the already characterized POXC isoenzyme, a different behavior was observed. In fact, the UV-visible spectrum of POXC showed a peak at 605 nm and a shoulder at approximately 330 nm (Fig. 4); these signals are typical of the “blue” oxidase enzymes corresponding to type 1 or blue copper atom and to type 3 binuclear copper atoms. The ratio ofA 280 to A 605 is 20, which is similar to those of laccases from other sources (14Salas C. Lobos S. Larraı̀n J. Salas L. Cullen D. Vicuña R. Biotechnol. Appl.

Microbiol. 1996; 62: 1151-1158Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, in the POXA1 absorption spectrum, the 605-nm signal was absent, as confirmed also by the colorless concentrated solutions of the protein, whereas a broad peak at about 400 nm was detected (Fig.4). The spectrum of the POXA2 isoenzyme showed a shoulder at 400 nm and a less intense absorption at 605 nm (Fig. 4) with aA 280/A 605 of 50. The copper content was determined by atomic absorption. The POXA2 and POXC isoenzymes showed values of 3.3 ± 0.1 and 3.7 ± 0.5 mol/mol copper/protein ratio respectively, whereas only 0.7 ± 0.2 mol of copper/mol of protein was determined for POXA1. Moreover, when different preparations of POXA1 isoenzyme were examined for metal content (cadmium, mercury, nickel, iron, zinc) by atomic absorption, the presence of two other metals, iron and zinc, was revealed; a quantitative analysis resulted in a 0.7 ± 0.2 mol/mol iron/protein ratio and 2.0 ± 0.2 mol/mol zinc/protein ratio. These values suggest a copper/iron/zinc stoichiometry of 1:1:2 for POXA1 isoenzyme. Polarographic analysis of POXA1 and POXC confirmed the presence of copper and zinc (iron cannot be detected by this technique) for the POXA1 isoenzyme and only the presence of copper for the POXC isoenzyme. Western blot analysis using anti POXC antibodies revealed that the three isoenzymes are not immunologically related. The activities of POXA1 and POXA2 at different pH values was examined over different incubation times and compared with that of POXC. POXA1 was the most stable enzyme at all pH values (3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0) investigated; the stability of this enzyme is almost unaffected by acidic pH (t 1/2 = 24 h at pH 3.0) in comparison with the other two isoenzymes, which proved to be very sensitive to pH decrease (t 1/2= 2 h for POXA2 and 30 min for POXC at pH 3.0) (Fig.5, upper and lower panels). Thermal stabilities of all isoenzymes were investigated at pH 7.0 where all of them showed their maximum stability. Plots of the residual activity after incubation at 60 °C versus time indicated a t 1/2 of 200 min for POXA1, 30 min for POXC, and 10 min for POXA2 (Fig. 6). When the activity of these enzymes was studied as a function of the temperature, POXA1 showed maximal activity in the range 45–65 °C, whereas POXC showed maximal activity in a narrower range (50–60 °C) and POXA2, at a lower temperature (25–35 °C). The catalytic parameters of POXA1 and POXA2 with respect to four substrates (ABTS, guaiacol, DMP, and syringaldazine) were determined and compared with those of POXC (TableII). The K catvalues of POXA2 have not been included because of the high instability of this enzyme, which did not allow a correct determination of the concentration of the active form of the enzyme.Table IIKinetic constants of Pleurotus ostreatus laccase isoenzymesSubstratePOXA1POXA2POXCK mk catk cat/K mPOXA1POXA2POXCPOXA1POXA2POXCPOXA1POXA2POXCOptimum pHmmmin −1mm −1 min −1ABTS3.03.03.0(9.0 ± 0.8)10−2(1.2 ± 0.2)10−1(2.8 ± 0.4)10−1(3.5 ± 0.3)105ND(1.6 ± 0.2)1043.9 × 106ND5.7 × 104GuaiacolNA6.06.0NA3.1 ± 0.61.2 ± 0.2NAND(1.5 ± 0.1)102NAND1.3 × 102DMP3–56.53–52.1 ± 0.3(7.4 ± 0.9)10−1(2.3 ± 0.2)10−1(2.5 ± 0.4)102ND(1.0 ± 0.1)1021.2 × 102ND4.3 × 102Syringaldazine6.06.06.0(1.3 ± 0.2)10−1(1.4 ± 0.5)10−1(2.0 ± 0.4)10−2(2.8 ± 0.6)104ND(2.3 ± 0.1)1042.1 × 105ND1.1 × 106NA, Not active; ND, Not determined. Open table in a new tab NA, Not active; ND, Not determined. No activity of POXA1 against guaiacol was observed at any of the pH levels tested. As shown in Table II, POXA2 oxidized 2,6-dimethoxyphenol optimally at pH 6.5, in this respect behaving quite differently from the other two isoenzymes. To investigate the oxidative reaction catalyzed by the POXA1 isoenzyme, a number of different substrates were tested (see “Enzyme Assays” under “Experimental Procedures”). The enzyme oxidized o- and p-dihydroxybenzene and o- andp-diaminobenzene, which are also substrates of all laccases. In particular, POXA1 more efficiently oxidizeso-dimethoxy-substituted phenols (DMP, syringic, and sinapic acids) compared with o-monomethoxy-substituted phenols (guaiacol, ferulic, and vanillic acids). Moreover, POXA1 did not exhibit any tyrosinase and protocatechuate deoxygenase activities. It has also been proved that both POXA1 and POXA2 reduce O2 during the reaction that they catalyze and that no H2O2 formation could be observed. The effects of several known laccase inhibitors on the activity of all the studied isoenzymes were examined using ABTS as substrate at pH 3.0. All enzymes were totally inhibited by 0.02 mm sodium azide and by thioglycolic acid at 0.05 mm. In the presence of EDTA, no inhibition was observed up to 50 mm concentration for all the three isoenzymes. Furthermore, 5 mmhydroxylamine caused 50% inhibition of POXA1 and POXC, whereas it was necessary to use a concentration of 50 mm to obtain the same inhibition for POXA2. Differences among the enzymes were also revealed when kojic acid was used; in fact, 50% inhibition was obtained at 200, 60, and 40 mm for POXA1, POXA2, and POXC respectively. This work complements and extends recent reports (9Giardina P. Cannio R. Martirani L. Marzullo L. Palmieri G. Sannia G. Appl. Environ.

In earlier studies we identified in P. ostreatus two genes and the corresponding cDNA coding for two laccase isoenzymes; the product of one of these genes, (pox2) POXC, is the isoenzyme most abundantly produced in all growth conditions examined (10Giardina P. Aurilia V. Cannio R. Marzullo L. Amoresano A. Siciliano R. Pucci P. Sannia G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 508-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 16Palmieri G. Giardina P. Marzullo L. Desiderio B. Nitti G. Cannio R. Sannia G. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1993; 39: 632-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), whereas the protein coded by the other gene (pox1) has not been identified so far (9Giardina P. Cannio R. Martirani L. Marzullo L. Palmieri G. Sannia G. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1995; 61: 2408-2413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To further investigate the organization of the laccase isoenzymes produced by P. ostreatus, we isolated and characterized two other phenol oxidases (POXA1 and POXA2) from this fungus. The time course of POXA1 production showed significant differences with respect to that of POXC laccase. The maximum POXA1 activity was reached later during the fungal growth with respect to that of POXC; thereafter, a fast decrease of the POXA1 activity was observed, probably due to the presence in the old culture medium of a low molecular weight inhibitor (data not shown). This behavior could suggest a different physiological role for the two isoenzymes. The other isoenzyme, POXA2, was produced in lower amounts at all growth times analyzed. POXA2 exhibits characteristics similar to those of known laccases from other fungi; in fact, molecular mass, pI, metal content, and kinetic constants lie well within the range determined for other laccases (24Thurston C.F. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 19-26Crossref Scopus (1631) Google Scholar). However, the stability of POXA2 as a function of temperature was particularly low. This characteristic leads to a considerable loss of the activity during the purification procedure, providing a very low yield of the homogeneous protein. Otherwise, POXA1 isoenzyme shows a remarkable high stability with respect to both pH and temperature and if compared with that of POXC and of other known laccases. Another peculiar characteristic of POXA1 is its neutral pI (6.7); to the best of our knowledge, all the laccases so far purified and characterized showed a pI in a pH range from 3 to 5. However, the unusual pI value is not the most striking characteristic of this protein; in fact, concentrated solutions of POXA1 lack the typical blue color that characterizes all the blue oxidases. This fact was confirmed by the analysis of the UV/visible spectrum of the protein, thus indicating the absence of the type I copper moiety. When the metal content of the protein was analyzed both by atomic absorption and by polarography, a more noticeable feature was observed. The protein was revealed to contain only 1 copper atom/molecule instead of the usual 4, and furthermore, 2 zinc atoms and 1 iron atom were present/each protein molecule. Moreover, the fact that the enzyme belongs to the laccase family is confirmed by (i) the high degree of identity of the determined primary structure with the corresponding sequences of known laccases, and (ii) the use of O2 as oxidative substrate and the lack of formation of H2O2 as a product in the catalyzed reaction, (iii) the almost standard pattern of substrate specificity displayed by this enzyme if compared with that of other known laccases. The reported data give clear evidence that the POXA1 laccase fromP. ostreatus belongs to the laccase family but displays structural characteristics that render it unique and allow its classification as a white laccase. Further investigation is needed to clarify the mechanism of the oxidative reaction catalyzed by this enzyme and the role of the metal ions present in this protein. The authors wish to thank Dr. Mauro Iuliano for performing polarographic analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2093626313,"The crystal structure of Gsalpha, the heterotrimeric G protein alpha subunit that stimulates adenylyl cyclase, was determined at 2.5 A in a complex with guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTPgammaS). Gsalpha is the prototypic member of a family of GTP-binding proteins that regulate the activities of effectors in a hormone-dependent manner. Comparison of the structure of Gsalpha.GTPgammaS with that of Gialpha.GTPgammaS suggests that their effector specificity is primarily dictated by the shape of the binding surface formed by the switch II helix and the alpha3-beta5 loop, despite the high sequence homology of these elements. In contrast, sequence divergence explains the inability of regulators of G protein signaling to stimulate the GTPase activity of Gsalpha. The betagamma binding surface of Gsalpha is largely conserved in sequence and structure to that of Gialpha, whereas differences in the surface formed by the carboxyl-terminal helix and the alpha4-beta6 loop may mediate receptor specificity."

https://openalex.org/W2042958872,Light-regulated translation of chloroplast messenger RNAs (mRNAs) requires trans- acting factors that interact with the 5′ untranslated region (UTR) of these mRNAs. Chloroplast polyadenylate-binding protein (cPABP) specifically binds to the 5′-UTR of the psbA mRNA and is essential for translation of this mRNA. A protein disulfide isomerase that is localized to the chloroplast and copurifies with cPABP was shown to modulate the binding of cPABP to the 5′-UTR of the psbA mRNA by reversibly changing the redox status of cPABP through redox potential or adenosine 5′-diphosphate–dependent phosphorylation. This mechanism allows for a simple reversible switch regulating gene expression in the chloroplast.
https://openalex.org/W2315552227,"The neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) tumor suppressor gene encodes an intracellular membrane-associated protein, called merlin (or schwannomin), that belongs to the band 4.1 family of cytoskeleton-associated proteins. Inactivating NF2 mutations occur in several sporadic tumor types and have been linked to the NF2 disease, whose hallmark is the development of bilateral Schwann cell tumors (schwannomas) of the eighth cranial nerve. Two major alternatively spliced NF2 variants are expressed in normal tissues: 'NF2-17' lacking exon 16 and 'NF2-16' that contains exon 16 and encodes a merlin protein truncated at the C-terminus. We report that overexpression of NF2-17 in rat schwannoma cells inhibits their growth in vitro and in vivo, while NF2-16 fails to influence schwannoma growth. Tumor growth inhibition by merlin depends on an interdomain association occurring either in cis or in trans between the N- and C-termini. This association does not occur in the truncated NF2-16 protein nor in a mutant NF2-17 protein lacking C-terminal sequences. These data indicate that merlin has a unique mechanism of tumor suppression, inhibiting cell proliferation via self-association."

Collectively, these proteins provide a physical connection between the extracellular matrix and the intracellular cytoskeleton of muscle cells. Disruption of this linkage eventually progresses to muscle cell necrosis, as evidenced by the dystrophic muscle phenotypes that result from defects in several of the DGC components (for review, see Refs. 6Campbell K.P.

Although the DGC is known to be essential for normal muscle function, the precise role of this multi-protein complex remains to be determined. Purification of the DGC has led to the identification of many of its constituent polypeptides, which range in size from 25 kDa to over 400 kDa and include glycosylated as well as non-glycosylated proteins (1Campbell K.P.

Nature. 1989; 338: 259-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar, 3Yoshida M. Ozawa E. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1990; 108: 748-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 4Ervasti J.M.

Chem. 1991; 266: 9161-9165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), has remained an enigma. In the present work, we have determined the amino acid sequence of two peptides derived from 25DAP and have isolated the corresponding human cDNA. Previous analysis of the 25DAP indicated that it is an integral membrane protein, since it reacts strongly with a probe for protein hydrophobicity (4Ervasti J.M. Campbell K.P. Cell. 1991; 66: 1121-1131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1114) Google Scholar). We now report that 25DAP is a novel component of the DGC and is predicted to span the sarcolemma four times. This is unusual for integral membrane proteins of the DGC, which possess only a single transmembrane span. We have renamed 25DAP “sarcospan” in reference to its multiple sarcolemma-spanning domains. The predicted topology of sarcospan is similar to that of the tetraspan superfamily of proteins (8Wright M.D. Tomlinson M.G. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 588-594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 9Maecker H.T. Todd S.C. Levy S. FASEB. 1997; 11: 428-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar), in which all members have four transmembrane domains and a large extracellular loop. The DGC was extracted from rabbit skeletal muscle membranes (10Ohlendieck K. Ervasti J.M. Snook J.B. Campbell K.P. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 135-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) and then purified by sWGA affinity chromatography followed by ion exchange on a DEAE-column, as described previously (1Campbell K.P. Kahl S.D. Nature. 1989; 338: 259-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar, 2Ervasti J.M. Ohlendieck K. Kahl S.D. Gaver M.G. Campbell K.P.

Purified DGC was electrophoresed on 3–15% gradient gels (0.7 mm thick) and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue as described by Ervasti et al.(5Ervasti J.M. Kahl S.D. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9161-9165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 25-kDa band was cut from the gel and sent to the Biopolymers Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for in-gel Lys-C digestion (11Williams K.R. Stone K.L. Crabb J. Techniques in Protein Chemistry VI. Academic Press, New York1997Google Scholar) and peptide microsequence analysis (12Stone K.L. Williams K.R. Matsudaira P.T. A Practical Guide to Protein and Peptide Purification for Microsequencing. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, New York1993: 43-69Crossref Google Scholar). Sarcospan cDNA clones were isolated by hybridization screening of aCLONTECH human adult skeletal muscle cDNA library (HL5002a) with a PCR-derived sarcospan cDNA probe encoding exons 1 to 3. The exon structure of the cDNA clones was confirmed by PCR, and the 5′ sequence was determined by direct analysis of biotinylated PCR products, as described previously (13Heighway J. Betticher D.C. Hoban P.R. Altermatt H.J. Cowen R. Genomics. 1996; 35: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Sequencing analysis of the clones was performed using dye terminator cycling and analyzed on a 373A Stretch Fluorescent Automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems). The 5′ end of rabbit sarcospan was sequenced from aCLONTECH rabbit skeletal muscle cDNA library, as described for the human clone. Multiple sequence alignment of sarcospan and the tetraspanins was accomplished as before (9Maecker H.T. Todd S.C. Levy S. FASEB. 1997; 11: 428-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar) with the GCG Wisconsin Sequence Analysis software programs. Predictions of transmembrane regions and orientations were made with the TMpred program. 2This program is available on the Internet (http://ulrec3.unil.ch/software/TMPRED_form.html). This algorithm is based on the statistical analysis of Tmbase, a data base of naturally occurring transmembrane proteins (14Hofmann K. Stoffel W. Biol. Chem. 1993; 347: 166Google Scholar). Adult human multiple tissue Northern blots (CLONTECH) containing 2 μg of poly(A+) RNA per lane were probed with PCR-amplified probes representing the full-length cDNA (exons 1 to 3) of sarcospan (13Heighway J. Betticher D.C. Hoban P.R. Altermatt H.J. Cowen R. Genomics. 1996; 35: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The strategy for generating polyclonal antibodies has been described previously (15Jung D. Duclos F. Apostol B. Straub V. Lee J.C. Allamand V. Venzke D.P. Sunada Y. Moomaw C.R. Leveille C.J.

For generating sarcospan antibodies, we injected two New Zealand White rabbits (rabbits 216 and 217; Knapp Creek Farms) at intramuscular and subcutaneous sites with 500 μg of an N-terminal sarcospan-2 synthetic peptide, CAADRQPRGQQRQGDAAGPD (Research Genetics), coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin in an emulsion of Freund's complete adjuvant (Sigma). The amino acids Cys-Ala-Ala were added to the peptide for coupling purposes. Affinity purification of sarcospan antibodies was accomplished using Immobilon-P (Millipore) strips containing the N-terminal peptide coupled to bovine serum albumin (15Jung D. Duclos F. Apostol B. Straub V. Lee J.C. Allamand V. Venzke D.P. Sunada Y. Moomaw C.R. Leveille C.J. Slaughter C.A. Crawford T.O. McPherson J.D. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 251: 32321-32329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This antibody did not react with mouse tissue. Immunofluorescence on muscle biopsies from control and several DMD patients was accomplished as described (15Jung D. Duclos F. Apostol B. Straub V. Lee J.C. Allamand V. Venzke D.P. Sunada Y. Moomaw C.R. Leveille C.J. Slaughter C.A. Crawford T.O. McPherson J.D. Campbell K.P. J. Biol.

The sections were observed under a Bio-Rad MRC-600 laser scanning confocal microscope, and the digitized images were captured under identical conditions. DGC fractions from the DEAE-column were pooled and concentrated to 800 μl. The samples were separated by centrifugation through a 5–30% sucrose gradient (2Ervasti J.M. Ohlendieck K. Kahl S.D. Gaver M.G. Campbell K.P. Nature. 1990; 345: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar, 5Ervasti J.M. Kahl S.D. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9161-9165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The gradients were fractionated into 1-ml fractions, and 80 μl of each fraction was resolved by 3–15% SDS-PAGE and either stained with silver or transferred to nitrocellulose. Immunoblot staining with antibodies to DGC (goat 20, 1:500) and sarcospan (rabbit 216 and 217, 1:20) was performed as described previously (15Jung D. Duclos F. Apostol B. Straub V. Lee J.C. Allamand V. Venzke D.P. Sunada Y. Moomaw C.R. Leveille C.J. Slaughter C.A. Crawford T.O. McPherson J.D. Campbell K.P. J. Biol.

Nature. 1989; 338: 259-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar, 2Ervasti J.M. Ohlendieck K. Kahl S.D. Gaver M.G. Campbell K.P. Nature. 1990; 345: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar, 3Yoshida M. Ozawa E. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1990; 108: 748-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar) (also called A5 (3Yoshida M. Ozawa E. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1990; 108: 748-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar)), proteins of the DGC were purified from rabbit skeletal muscle and separated using preparative SDS-PAGE. Peptide fragments of the 25DAP were obtained by Lys-C digestion. Microsequencing of the resultant peptides gave the following sequences: peptide I, KHRYQVFYVGV; peptide II, KDRQPRGQQRQGDAAGPDDPG. The amino acid sequences of these two peptides were used to search the GenBankTM data base with the tBLASTn program (16Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70715) Google Scholar). This analysis revealed a homology between peptide I and Kirsten ras-associated gene (KRAG) from human and mouse (accession numbersX89105 and U02487, respectively). Murine KRAG was first identified based on coamplification of its transcript with Kirsten ras in Y1 adrenal carcinoma cells (17Scott A.F. Elizaga A. Morrell J. Bergen A. Penno M.B. Genomics. 1994; 20: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Similarly, the human KRAG gene was also identified through analysis of transcripts co-amplified with KRAS2 in lung and ovarian carcinoma cells (13Heighway J. Betticher D.C. Hoban P.R. Altermatt H.J. Cowen R. Genomics. 1996; 35: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Although peptide II was not found in GenBankTM, TIGR, or dbEST data bases, sequencing of additional KRAG clones from a human skeletal muscle cDNA library identified at least four cDNAs that do encode peptide II. Translation of these cDNAs predicts a protein identical to the KRAG sequence deposited in GenBankTM including an additional 26 residues at the N terminus (Fig. 1,A and B). This 26-amino acid extension includes a perfect match with 17 out of 21 amino acids found in peptide II isolated from rabbit (see above). We suspect that the amino acid differences between the rabbit peptide and the human cDNA are due to species variation. As verification of this, partial sequencing of the 5′ sarcospan cDNA from rabbit skeletal muscle was performed. Translation of this region demonstrates an exact match between the amino acids deduced by the rabbit cDNA (KDRQPRGQQRQGDAAGPDDPG) and the amino acid sequence of peptide II (shown above). Furthermore, we confirmed sarcospan expression in rabbit skeletal and cardiac muscle by Northern analysis with a full-length cDNA probe (data not shown). The primary amino acid sequence deduced from the human cDNA predicts a protein with four transmembrane spanning domains and a topology similar to that of the tetraspan proteins (Fig.1 B). Based on the predicted membrane topology of the human protein and its residence in the sarcolemma, we have named this protein sarcospan. The tetraspans, also referred to as the transmembrane 4 superfamily (TM4SF) and the tetraspanins, have four transmembrane spanning helices that are conserved among family members (8Wright M.D. Tomlinson M.G. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 588-594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 9Maecker H.T. Todd S.C. Levy S. FASEB. 1997; 11: 428-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). Although there is no clear function for the TM4SF members, many of them are associated with integrins and have been implicated in the regulation of cell proliferation (9Maecker H.T. Todd S.C. Levy S. FASEB. 1997; 11: 428-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). Using phylogenetic analysis, we find that sarcospan is more closely related to the divergent family members Rom-1, peripherin, and uroplakin (data not shown). We refer to the two cloned cDNAs as sarcospan-1 (spn1; GenBankTM accession number X89105) and sarcospan-2 (spn2; GenBankTM accession number AF016028), where Spn2 includes 26 amino acids at its N terminus. In light of the identification of sarcospan, we have redesignated KRAG (13Heighway J. Betticher D.C. Hoban P.R. Altermatt H.J. Cowen R. Genomics. 1996; 35: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) as thespn1 gene. To examine the tissue distribution of sarcospan, we performed RNA hybridization analysis. We probed human multiple tissue Northern blots with a full-length spn1 cDNA probe. As shown in Fig.2, a 6.5-kb transcript is present exclusively in skeletal and cardiac muscles. However, a 4.5-kb transcript is also found in skeletal and cardiac muscle, as well as in thymus, prostate, testis, ovary, small intestine, colon, and spleen. Our data suggest the presence of tissue-specific sarcospan transcripts. The expression of sarcospan in a broad array of tissues is most similar to that of dystroglycan (18Ibraghimov-Beskrovnaya O. Ervasti J.M. Leveille C.J. Slaughter C.A. Sernett S.W. Campbell K.P. Nature. 1992; 355: 696-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar, 19Ibraghimov-Beskrovnaya O. Milatovich A. Ozcelik T. Yang B. Koepnick K. Francke U. Campbell K.P. Hum. Mol. Gene. 1993; 2: 1651-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), suggesting that these proteins play important roles in muscle as well as non-muscle tissues. We confirmed that the 25-kDa Coomassie-stained band in the DGC was sarcospan by staining immunoblots containing purified DGC with sarcospan antibodies. Although a 25-kDa band is present in purified DGC from rabbit skeletal muscle, it does not elicit an antibody response when DGC preparations were used to immunize either sheep or goat (Fig.3 A). Thus, we generated a polyclonal antibody to sarcospan by immunizing rabbits with peptide II. This affinity-purified antibody specifically stains a 25-kDa band on immunoblots of purified DGC from rabbit skeletal muscle membranes (Fig.3 A). As a first demonstration that sarcospan is an integral component of the DGC, we show that sarcospan enriches in purification of the complex. Immunoblots of purified DGC stained with DGC antibodies show a clear enrichment of these purified proteins relative to the levels in rabbit skeletal muscle membranes (Fig. 3 A). Identical immunoblots illustrate that sarcospan also enriches in DGC prepared from rabbit membranes (Fig. 3 A). As another test for association between sarcospan and the DGC, we examined sarcospan expression in muscle from DMD patients. We examined several DMD patients with primary mutations in dystrophin, resulting in loss of the entire dystrophin protein. Indirect immunofluorescence assays with antibodies against dystrophin's N and C termini and the central rod domain verify that dystrophin is completely absent from the DMD sarcolemma (data not shown). Without dystrophin, the other members of the complex are reduced, perhaps the result of premature protein degradation, improper assembly of the complex, or aberrant transportation to the sarcolemma. We show that sarcospan is present at the sarcolemma in normal muscle and is dramatically reduced in DMD muscle (Fig. 3 B). The reduced staining of sarcospan in DMD muscle provides further evidence that this protein is complexed with the DGC. The tight association of sarcospan with the DGC is illustrated by centrifugation of the DGC through sucrose gradients. Sucrose gradient sedimentation separates the DGC from any proteins which might bind with low affinity to the complex. Proteins from the sucrose gradient fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE. The resultant polyacrylamide gels were stained with silver to better visualize sarcospan (Fig.4), which stains weakly with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Fig. 3 A). Immunoblotting with sarcospan antibodies confirms that the intensely silver-stained band at 25 kDa is sarcospan. The peak of DGC proteins migrates in fractions 9 and 10 as seen by the silver-stained gels and Western blotting of these same fractions with anti-DGC antibodies (Fig. 4). Sarcospan migrates in the same fractions as the DGC during sedimentation through sucrose gradients, confirming that sarcospan is an integral member of this complex (Fig. 4). The structural connection between the extracellular matrix and the intracellular actin network is dependent on the integrity of the DGC. Disruption of this linkage eventually progresses to muscle cell necrosis, as evidenced by the dystrophic phenotype that results from defects in several of the DGC components, including the dystrophin and the sarcoglycans (for review, see Refs. 6Campbell K.P. Cell. 1995; 80: 675-679Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar and 7Straub V. Campbell K.P. Curr. Opin. Neurol. 1997; 10: 168-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Mutations in sarcospan would feasibly also give rise to a dystrophic phenotype. The gene encoding sarcospan maps to human chromosome 12p11.2 (13Heighway J. Betticher D.C. Hoban P.R. Altermatt H.J. Cowen R. Genomics. 1996; 35: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Congenital fibrosis of the extraocular muscle (CFEOM) is an autosomal dominant disorder which primarily affects the ocular muscles, rendering patients with little or no eye movement. Linkage analysis of two large unrelated families with CFEOM indicate that this disease locus lies within 12p11.2-q12 (20Engle E.C. Kunkel L.M. Specht L.A. Beggs A.H. Nat. Genet. 1994; 7: 69-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 21Engle E.C. Marondel I. Houtman W.A. de Vries B. Loewenstein A. Lazar M. Ward D.C. Kucherlapati R. Beggs A.H. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1995; 57: 1086-1094PubMed Google Scholar). We propose that sarcospan is a prime candidate gene for this disease. Sarcospan is the first identified member of the DGC that spans the membrane more than once. In fact, over 60% of sarcospan's amino acids are predicted to be within the membrane and this unique characteristic may be providing clues to sarcospan's function. For instance, sarcospan's transmembrane domains are expected to hold this protein firmly within the lipid bilayer, in which case it could provide a solid anchorage for the rest of the DGC. Additionally, the multiple transmembrane regions of sarcospan might form a pore in the sarcolemma and thereby serve as a membrane channel. The latter scenario is particularly attractive in light of the emerging concept that the DGC performs functional as well as structural roles in muscle. The charged residues in sarcospan's transmembrane domains may be important for protein-protein interactions, perhaps with integrins or other DGC components. Finally, the observation that sarcospan expression is amplified in some human tumors, in combination with the proposal that tetraspan proteins play a role in cell growth, supports the idea that sarcospan itself has essential functions that extend beyond its role in muscle.

https://openalex.org/W2088778716,"Nucleosomes, the nucleohistone subunits of chromatin, are present on transcribed eukaryotic genes but do not prevent transcription. It is shown here that the large yeast RNA polymerase III transcribes through a single nucleosome. This takes place through a direct internal nucleosome transfer in which histones never leave the DNA template. During this process, the polymerase pauses with a pronounced periodicity of 10 to 11 base pairs, which is consistent with restricted rotation in the DNA loop formed during transfer. Transcription through nucleosomes by the eukaryotic enzyme and by much smaller prokaryotic RNA polymerases thus shares many features, reflecting an important property of nucleosomes."

The Drosophila gene tolloid encodes a metalloprotease similar to BMP-1 that interacts genetically with decapentaplegic, the Drosophila homolog of vertebrate BMP-2/4. Zebrafish embryos overexpressing a zebrafish homolog of tolloid were shown to resemble loss-of-function mutations in chordino, the zebrafish homolog of the Xenopus BMP-4 antagonist Chordin. Furthermore, Chordin was degraded by COS cells expressing Tolloid. These data suggest that Tolloid antagonizes Chordin activity by proteolytically cleaving Chordin. A conserved function for zebrafish and Drosophila Tolloid during embryogenesis is proposed."

Freeman M.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1450-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, we speculated that a scavenger receptor(s) other than those that have been cloned to date is expressed by endothelial cells.In the present study, we have isolated, by expression cloning, the cDNA encoding a new type of scavenger receptor expressed by endothelial cells (SREC) which mediates the binding and degradation of Ac-LDL.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe cloned SREC cDNA is approximately 3.4 kb long, and nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that this cDNA contains an open reading frame of 2,490 base pairs. Fig.1 A shows the deduced amino acid sequence of the cDNA. The cDNA encodes a protein of 830 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 85,735 Da (mature peptide). Hydropathy analysis using the Kyte and Doolittle algorithm (14Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (16999) Google Scholar) shows that the molecule has two hydrophobic regions, in the N terminus and the middle of the molecule, which could serve as a signal sequence and a transmembrane domain, respectively. Since the N-terminal half of the molecule contains three potential N-linked glycosylation sites, we speculate at present that the molecule is a type I transmembrane protein, having an unusually long C-terminal cytoplasmic domain relative to the N-terminal extracellular domain.The predicted SREC has no significant homology to other types of scavenger receptors but has several characteristic domain structures (Fig. 1 B). There are 72 cysteine residues distributed throughout the putative extracellular domain, which is made up of 406 amino acids. As shown in Fig. 1 C, the spacing of these residues forms 10 repeats. There are five repeats that exactly fit the consensus sequence for an EGF-like domain cysteine pattern signature (CXCXXXXXGXXC) (Fig. 1 C) (15Bromquist M.C. Hunt L.T. Barker W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 7363-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 16Appella E. Weber I.T. Blasi F. FEBS Lett. 1988; 231: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Two repeats (shown as segments 7 and 8 in the figure) have one amino acid inserted into the motif. Since certain EGF-like repeats have been shown to mediate homophilic or heterophilic protein-protein interactions, the motifs detected in the SREC may contribute to the oligomerization of the molecule. Alternatively, as is the case with an LDL receptor, which contains EGF precursor homology domains in its N terminus, some of these motifs may also serve as the ligand binding domain (17Yamamoto T. Davis C.G. Brown M.S. Schneider W.J. Casey M.L. Goldstein J.L. Russel D.W. Cell. 1984; 39: 27-38Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar, 18Mehta K.D. Chen W.-J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10406-10414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The putative transmembrane domain is followed by a serine- and proline-rich region (Ser/Pro-rich region) located in the N-terminal half of the cytoplasmic domain. It is difficult to speculate on the biological significance of this region at present; however, this domain contains several serine and threonine residues that could potentially be phosphorylated by various protein kinases, suggesting that some biological signals may be delivered via the domain. Downstream of the Ser/Pro-rich region is a glycine-rich region (Gly-rich region). There are 26 glycine residues distributed throughout a domain of 177 amino acids. In the C-terminal end of the domain, there is a tyrosine residue (Tyr822) fitting the consensus sequence (RXXEXXY) for a site phosphorylated by tyrosine kinases (19Cooper J.A. Esch F.S. Taylor S.S. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7835-7841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that it may play a role in some signal transduction processes.We compared the expression level of the message in HUVECs, CAEs, and CASMs. The 3.5-kb transcript was clearly detected in HUVECs and CAEs, whereas we did not detect any bands in CASMs (Fig.2).Figure 2Northern blot analysis of SREC mRNA expressed in human endothelial cells. HUVECs, CAEs, and CASMs were obtained from Clonetics and cultured according to the supplier's instructions. The amount of poly(A)+ RNA from these cells was 0.5 μg.

The binding of 125I-Ac-LDL was assessed following incubation of the transformed cells with125I-Ac-LDL. Saturation binding of 125I-Ac-LDL was observed at 4 °C (Fig.3 A). Scatchard analysis (Fig.3 A, inset) showed the presence of a single class of receptors and the calculated K d was 3.0 μg/ml125I-Ac-LDL (approximately 1.7 nm125I-Ac-LDL), which is comparable with the value of 2.7 nm for scavenger receptors on HUVECs (20Van Hinsbergh V.W.M. Havekes L. Emeis J.J. Corven E. Sheffer M. Arteriosclerosis. 1983; 3: 547-559Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have also performed binding experiments employing DiI Ac-LDL and obtained the same result (K d is 3.2 nm). Incubation of the transfectants at 37 °C with DiI Ac-LDL led to the uptake of fluorescent lipid (DiI) into the cytoplasm, producing a punctate pattern (Fig. 4, A andB). Diffuse labeling, most likely of the cell surface, was also observed. When CHO-SREC cells were incubated with125I-Ac-LDL at 37 °C for various lengths of time, chloroquine-sensitive cellular association of radioactivity and acid-soluble radioactivity in the medium continued to appear at a linear rate, reflecting the continuous uptake and degradation of125I-Ac-LDL (Fig. 3 B).Figure 3Binding and degradation of125I-Ac-LDL by control and SREC-expressing CHO cells. A, specific binding of 125I-Ac-LDL to SREC-expressing CHO cells. CHO-SREC cells grown to confluence in 12-well plates were incubated with 0.52–16.5 μg/ml125I-Ac-LDL at 4 °C for 2 h. Total binding (open circles) represents the binding at increasing concentrations of 125I-Ac-LDL and the nonspecific binding (triangle) represents the binding in the presence of a 20-fold excess of unlabeled Ac-LDL. Specific binding (closed circle) is obtained by the subtraction of the nonspecific curve from the total curve. Specific binding of 125I-Ac-LDL to control CHO cells was less than 5% that obtained with transfectant cells. Inset shows the Scatchard analysis of the data (r = −0.911).

After incubation at 37 °C for the indicated time, degradation (closed circles) and association (open circles) were determined for triplicate wells. Degradation (closed circles) and association (open circles) in the presence of 100 μm chloroquine were also shown.

As is the case with type I macrophage scavenger receptors, unlabeled Ac-LDL as well as poly I and dextran sulfate, but not native lipoproteins such as LDL and HDL, reduced the binding of DiI Ac-LDL on the cells to the basal level. Ox-LDL, maleyl-bovine serum albumin, and MDA-LDL partially reduced the binding of DiI Ac-LDL on the cells. These results show that the SREC has a binding specificity similar to those of the type I and type II macrophage scavenger receptors.Figure 5Inhibition of DiI Ac-LDL binding to CHO-SREC cells by various compounds. The CHO-SREC cells were incubated with 2 μg/ml DiI Ac-LDL at 4 °C for 2 h in the presence of 200 μg/ml various inhibitors. Inhibitors used are Ac-LDL, LDL, HDL, Ox-LDL, MDA-LDL, maleyl-bovine serum albumin (Maleyl-BSA), dextran sulfate, poly I, and heparin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In this study, we cloned the cDNA encoding a new type of scavenger receptor that is expressed by endothelial cells. Interestingly, the SREC has an unusually long C-terminal cytoplasmic domain that contains a Ser/Pro-rich domain and a Gly-rich domain. Together with the fact that the molecule also contains a tyrosine phosphorylation site in the C-terminal end, these characteristics tempt us to speculate that the cytoplasmic domain may mediate some biological signals. It has been demonstrated by several investigators that stimulation of scavenger receptors of endothelial cells induces the expression of proteins related to vascular functions. For example, Ac-LDL and Ox-LDL stimulate the release of endothelin, a potent vasoconstrictor peptide (21Boulanger C.M. Tanner F.C. Béca M.-L. Hahn A.W.A. Werner A. Luscher T.F. Circ. Res. 1992; 70: 1191-1197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, the circulating levels of endothelin are increased in patients with hyperlipidemia or atherosclerosis (22Arendt R.M. Wilbert-Lampen U. Heuke L. Circulation. 1990; 82: III-248Google Scholar, 23Lerman A. Hallet J.W. Heublein D.M. Burnett Jr., J.C. N. Engl. J. Med. 1991; 325: 997-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar). Alternatively, poly I, a scavenger receptor agonist significantly induces the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, and E-selectin by a human endothelial cell line, EA hy.926 (24Palkama T. Majuri M.-L. Mattila P. Hurme M. Renkonen R. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1993; 92: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Adherence of circulating monocytes to the arterial endothelium is first seen in high cholesterol diet-induced experimental atherosclerosis in rabbits (25Ludmer P.L. Selwyn A.P. Shook T.L. Wayne R.R.

The molecular mechanism underlying such physiological changes of vascular endothelial cells in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis is not well understood. The present report of the isolation of cDNA for endothelial cell scavenger receptor should help our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in a development of atherosclerosis.

The receptor involved in this pathway is called a scavenger receptor. The first scavenger receptors to be purified and cloned were the macrophage type I and type II receptors (1Kodoma T. Freeman M. Rohrer L. Zabrecky J. Matsudaira P. Krieger M. Nature. 1990; 343: 531-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar, 2Roher L. Freeman M. Kodama T. Penman M. Krieger M. Nature. 1990; 343: 570-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Receptors that recognize chemically modified LDL, but which are distinct from the type I and II macrophage scavenger receptors, have been identified in macrophages and some other cell types (3Stanton L.W.

It is well recognized that endothelial cells possess scavenger receptor activity, and the uptake by endothelial cells of 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI)-labeled Ac-LDL (DiI Ac-LDL) is widely used to isolate endothelial cells from vascular tissues. However, several lines of evidence suggest that the receptor present on their surface is distinct from the scavenger receptors described to date (3Stanton L.W. White R.T. Bryant C.M. Protter A.A.

Recently, an endothelial receptor for Ox-LDL was cloned, using an expression cloning strategy, from cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells (8Sawamura T. Kume N. Aoyama T. Morikawa H. Hoshikawa H. Aiba Y. Tanaka T. Miwa S. Katsura Y. Kita T. Masaki T. Nature. 1997; 386: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar). The cDNA for the receptor encodes a protein of 270 amino acid residues, with a calculated molecular mass of 30,872 Da. It has a type II membrane protein structure with a short N-terminal cytosolic domain and a long C-terminal extracellular domain and belongs to the C-type lectin family. Although the ligand specificity or the competitor sensitivity of the receptor is not yet known, the cloned receptor recognizes Ox-LDL with a high affinity, but not Ac-LDL. Similarly, it was demonstrated that rabbit venous endothelial cells in primary culture and a bovine aortic endothelial cell line had no detectable mRNA of type I and type II scavenger receptors (9Bickel P.E.

Alternatively, as is the case with an LDL receptor, which contains EGF precursor homology domains in its N terminus, some of these motifs may also serve as the ligand binding domain (17Yamamoto T. Davis C.G. Brown M.S. Schneider W.J. Casey M.L. Goldstein J.L. Russel D.W. Cell. 1984; 39: 27-38Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar, 18Mehta K.D. Chen W.-J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10406-10414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The putative transmembrane domain is followed by a serine- and proline-rich region (Ser/Pro-rich region) located in the N-terminal half of the cytoplasmic domain. It is difficult to speculate on the biological significance of this region at present; however, this domain contains several serine and threonine residues that could potentially be phosphorylated by various protein kinases, suggesting that some biological signals may be delivered via the domain. Downstream of the Ser/Pro-rich region is a glycine-rich region (Gly-rich region). There are 26 glycine residues distributed throughout a domain of 177 amino acids. In the C-terminal end of the domain, there is a tyrosine residue (Tyr822) fitting the consensus sequence (RXXEXXY) for a site phosphorylated by tyrosine kinases (19Cooper J.A. Esch F.S. Taylor S.S. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7835-7841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that it may play a role in some signal transduction processes. We compared the expression level of the message in HUVECs, CAEs, and CASMs. The 3.5-kb transcript was clearly detected in HUVECs and CAEs, whereas we did not detect any bands in CASMs (Fig.2). The expression plasmid containing SREC DNA was expressed in CHO cells (CHO-SREC). The binding of 125I-Ac-LDL was assessed following incubation of the transformed cells with125I-Ac-LDL. Saturation binding of 125I-Ac-LDL was observed at 4 °C (Fig.3 A). Scatchard analysis (Fig.3 A, inset) showed the presence of a single class of receptors and the calculated K d was 3.0 μg/ml125I-Ac-LDL (approximately 1.7 nm125I-Ac-LDL), which is comparable with the value of 2.7 nm for scavenger receptors on HUVECs (20Van Hinsbergh V.W.M. Havekes L. Emeis J.J. Corven E. Sheffer M. Arteriosclerosis. 1983; 3: 547-559Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have also performed binding experiments employing DiI Ac-LDL and obtained the same result (K d is 3.2 nm). Incubation of the transfectants at 37 °C with DiI Ac-LDL led to the uptake of fluorescent lipid (DiI) into the cytoplasm, producing a punctate pattern (Fig. 4, A andB). Diffuse labeling, most likely of the cell surface, was also observed. When CHO-SREC cells were incubated with125I-Ac-LDL at 37 °C for various lengths of time, chloroquine-sensitive cellular association of radioactivity and acid-soluble radioactivity in the medium continued to appear at a linear rate, reflecting the continuous uptake and degradation of125I-Ac-LDL (Fig. 3 B). To further characterize the binding properties of the SREC, the receptors activity was measured in the presence of various materials known as type I and type II macrophage scavenger receptor inhibitors (Fig. 5). As is the case with type I macrophage scavenger receptors, unlabeled Ac-LDL as well as poly I and dextran sulfate, but not native lipoproteins such as LDL and HDL, reduced the binding of DiI Ac-LDL on the cells to the basal level. Ox-LDL, maleyl-bovine serum albumin, and MDA-LDL partially reduced the binding of DiI Ac-LDL on the cells. These results show that the SREC has a binding specificity similar to those of the type I and type II macrophage scavenger receptors. In this study, we cloned the cDNA encoding a new type of scavenger receptor that is expressed by endothelial cells. Interestingly, the SREC has an unusually long C-terminal cytoplasmic domain that contains a Ser/Pro-rich domain and a Gly-rich domain. Together with the fact that the molecule also contains a tyrosine phosphorylation site in the C-terminal end, these characteristics tempt us to speculate that the cytoplasmic domain may mediate some biological signals. It has been demonstrated by several investigators that stimulation of scavenger receptors of endothelial cells induces the expression of proteins related to vascular functions. For example, Ac-LDL and Ox-LDL stimulate the release of endothelin, a potent vasoconstrictor peptide (21Boulanger C.M. Tanner F.C. Béca M.-L. Hahn A.W.A. Werner A. Luscher T.F. Circ. Res. 1992; 70: 1191-1197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, the circulating levels of endothelin are increased in patients with hyperlipidemia or atherosclerosis (22Arendt R.M. Wilbert-Lampen U. Heuke L. Circulation. 1990; 82: III-248Google Scholar, 23Lerman A. Hallet J.W. Heublein D.M. Burnett Jr., J.C. N. Engl. J. Med. 1991; 325: 997-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar). Alternatively, poly I, a scavenger receptor agonist significantly induces the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, and E-selectin by a human endothelial cell line, EA hy.926 (24Palkama T. Majuri M.-L. Mattila P. Hurme M. Renkonen R. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1993; 92: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Adherence of circulating monocytes to the arterial endothelium is first seen in high cholesterol diet-induced experimental atherosclerosis in rabbits (25Ludmer P.L. Selwyn A.P. Shook T.L. Wayne R.R. Mudge G.H. Alexander R.W. Ganz P. N. Engl. J. Med. 1986; 315: 1046-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (2007) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism underlying such physiological changes of vascular endothelial cells in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis is not well understood. The present report of the isolation of cDNA for endothelial cell scavenger receptor should help our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in a development of atherosclerosis."

https://openalex.org/W1990455454,"High density lipoprotein (HDL) particles and HDL cholesteryl esters are taken up by both receptor-mediated and non-receptor-mediated pathways. Here we show that cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) participate in hepatic lipase (HL)- and apolipoprotein (apo) E-mediated binding and uptake of mouse and human HDL by cultured hepatocytes. The HL secreted by HL-transfected McA-RH7777 cells enhanced both HDL binding at 4 °C (∼2–4-fold) and HDL uptake at 37 °C (∼2–5-fold). The enhanced binding and uptake of HDL were partially inhibited by the 39-kDa protein, an inhibitor of low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP), but were almost totally blocked by heparinase, which removes the sulfated glycosaminoglycan chains from HSPG. Therefore, HL may mediate the uptake of HDL by two pathways: an HSPG-dependent LRP pathway and an HSPG-dependent but LRP-independent pathway. The HL-mediated binding and uptake of HDL were only minimally reduced when catalytically inactive HL or LRP binding-defective HL was substituted for wild-type HL, indicating that much of the HDL uptake required neither HL binding to the LRP nor lipolytic processing. To study the role of HL in facilitating the selective uptake of cholesteryl esters, we used HDL into which radiolabeled cholesteryl ether had been incorporated. HL increased the selective uptake of HDL cholesteryl ether; this enhanced uptake was reduced by more than 80% by heparinase but was unaffected by the 39-kDa protein. Like HL, apoE enhanced the binding and uptake of HDL (∼2-fold) but had little effect on the selective uptake of HDL cholesteryl ether. In the presence of HL, apoE did not further increase the uptake of HDL, and at a high concentration apoE impaired or decreased the HL-mediated uptake of HDL. Therefore, HL and apoE may utilize similar (but not identical) binding sites to mediate HDL uptake. Although the relative importance of cell surface HSPG in the overall metabolism of HDL in vivo remains to be determined, cultured hepatocytes clearly displayed an HSPG-dependent pathway that mediates the binding and uptake of HDL. This study also demonstrates the importance of HL in enhancing the binding and uptake of remnant and low density lipoproteins via an HSPG-dependent pathway. High density lipoprotein (HDL) particles and HDL cholesteryl esters are taken up by both receptor-mediated and non-receptor-mediated pathways.

Although apolipoprotein (apo) A-I is clearly important in HDL metabolism, a specific cell surface receptor for apoA-I has not been conclusively identified. Recently, a scavenger receptor (SR-BI) and the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-related protein (LRP) have been proposed to be involved in the uptake of HDL (18Acton S. Rigotti A.

Third, cholesteryl esters of HDL may be taken up by the liver or extrahepatic tissues (or cultured cells) without a parallel uptake of HDL particles. Although the mechanism of this selective uptake is poorly defined (22Jansen H. Hülsmann W.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1980; 5: 265-268Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 23Stein Y.

In addition, the up-regulation of SR-BI mRNA reported in the hepatic lipase (HL)-deficient mice (25Homanics G.E. de Silva H.V. Osada J. Zhang S.H. Wong H. Borensztajn J. Maeda N. J. Biol.

Hepatic lipase, a 476-amino acid protein (M r∼60,000), plays an important role in HDL metabolism (26Komaromy M.C. Schotz M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 373-384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, pretreating HDL with HL increases the uptake of apolipoproteins and cholesteryl esters by cultured cells (36Bamberger M. Glick J.M. Rothblat G.H. J.

Anti-HL antibody or inactivation of the HL gene increased HDL levels (25Homanics G.E. de Silva H.V. Osada J. Zhang S.H. Wong H. Borensztajn J. Maeda N. J. Biol.

Apolipoprotein E is also involved in the metabolism of HDL. In humans, apoE is associated with a subclass of HDL referred to as HDL1; however, in lower species, such as mice, rats, and dogs, apoE is a major component of HDL, and HDL1 often represents a major subclass (41Mahley R.W.

Apolipoprotein E is a ligand for the LDL receptor (43Innerarity T.L. Mahley R.W. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 1440-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), the LRP (44Beisiegel U. Weber W.

However, its role in the selective uptake of HDL cholesteryl esters is uncertain because conflicting results have been reported (13Leblond L. Marcel Y.L. J. Biol.

In contrast, HL-mediated selective uptake of cholesteryl esters has been demonstrated in cultured hepatocytes (36Bamberger M. Glick J.M. Rothblat G.H. J.

These pathways may be important not only in the liver, where a large fraction of HDL is catabolized, but also in the adrenal and ovary, where HDL (possibly in association with HL and/or apoE) may play a major role in cholesterol homeostasis (for reviews see Refs. 61Reaven E.

The purified DNAs were stably transfected into McA-RH7777 cells, and positive clones were identified by lipase activity and Western blot assays of cell culture medium with a monoclonal HL antibody (a gift of Dr. André Bensadoun, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY). Clones that produced similar amounts of immunoreactive HL by Western blot assay were used in these studies. Wild-type HL and the HL variants were characterized by their heparin binding properties (75Bengtsson-Olivecrona G. Olivecrona T. Jörnvall H. Eur. J.

Conditioned medium from transfected cells was applied to a heparin-Sepharose column and eluted with an NaCl gradient (0.4–1.2 m). Fractions (1.1 ml) were collected and assayed for catalytically active and immunoreactive HL as described below. The salt concentration of every other fraction was determined by conductance measurements. To compare the LRP binding activities of HL-LRP− and wild-type HL, rat liver LRP was prepared (78Kowal R.C.

Rat liver membrane proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with 3–8% gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The position of the LRP was determined by incubating the membranes with biotinylated β-VLDL enriched with human apoE (69Kowal R.C. Herz J. Goldstein J.L. Esser V. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

McA-RH7777 cells transfected with wild-type HL or HL-LRP−were incubated with heparin (2 units/ml) at 37 °C for 48 h. Conditioned media (∼180 ml) were collected, adjusted to pH 7.4 with 1m Tris, and concentrated at 4 °C. To verify that equal amounts of immunoreactive HL were present, the media (30 μl) were analyzed by Western blot assay with a monospecific human HL antibody. 2Z.-S. Ji, H. L. Dichek, R. D. Miranda, and R. W. Mahley, unpublished data. The HL immunoreactivity was quantitated with an Ambis bioimaging system (San Diego, CA). The HL activity in 100-μl aliquots of each medium was measured in triplicate with 14C-labeled triolein as a substrate in the presence of 1 m NaCl (79Iverius P.-H. Brunzell J.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 249: E107-E114PubMed Google Scholar). The LRP membrane strips were incubated with conditioned medium containing either wild-type HL or HL-LRP− for 16 h at 4 °C and then at room temperature for 2 h, followed by incubation at room temperature first with a monospecific rabbit anti-human HL antibody and then with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit second antibody (Zymed, South San Francisco, CA). Binding of the second antibody was identified by electrochemiluminescence (Amersham ECL detection kit), and the blots were scanned with an Ambis scanner; the intensity in arbitrary units was set at 100% for wild-type HL. Nontransfected and HL-transfected cells were grown in 22-mm dishes for 4–5 days (∼90% confluence), washed twice with serum-free medium, and incubated with fresh serum-free medium at 37 °C for 2 h. The cells were placed on ice and equilibrated for 20 min in a chamber with 7% CO2. Labeled lipoproteins or lipoproteins plus apoE were added to the culture medium, and the cells were incubated in the chamber on ice in the cold room (4 °C) for 2 h, washed five times with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and once with PBS alone, and dissolved in 0.1n NaOH. Bound radiolabeled lipoproteins were measured by γ counting, and the protein concentration of the cells was determined by Lowry's method (80Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2163103493,"A Sonic hedgehog (Shh) response element was identified in the chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter–transcription factor II (COUP-TFII) promoter that binds to a factor distinct from Gli , a gene known to mediate Shh signaling. Although this binding activity is specifically stimulated by Shh-N (amino-terminal signaling domain), it can also be unmasked with protein phosphatase treatment in the mouse cell line P19, and induction by Shh-N can be blocked by phosphatase inhibitors. Thus, Shh-N signaling may result in dephosphorylation of a target factor that is required for activation of COUP-TFII–, Islet1-, and Gli response element–dependent gene expression. This finding identifies another step in the Shh-N signaling pathway."

The isolated lamA gene encodes an extracellular enzyme that shares homology with both endo-β-1,3- and endo-β-1,3-1,4-glucanases of the glycosyl hydrolase family 16. After deletion of the N-terminal leader sequence, alamA fragment encoding an active endo-β-1,3-glucanase was overexpressed in Escherichia coli using the T7-expression system. The purified P. furiosus endoglucanase has highest hydrolytic activity on the β-1,3-glucose polymer laminarin and has some hydrolytic activity on the β-1,3-1,4 glucose polymers lichenan and barley β-glucan. The enzyme is the most thermostable endo-β-1,3-glucanase described up to now; it has optimal activity at 100–105 °C. In the predicted active site of glycosyl hydrolases of family 16 that show predominantly endo-β-1,3-glucanase activity, an additional methionine residue is present. Deletion of this methionine did not change the substrate specificity of the endoglucanase, but it did cause a severe reduction in its catalytic activity, suggesting a structural role of this residue in constituting the active site. High performance liquid chromatography analysis showed in vitrohydrolysis of laminarin by the endo-β-1,3-glucanase proceeds more efficiently in combination with an exo-β-glycosidase from P. furiosus (CelB). This most probably reflects the physiological role of these enzymes: cooperation during growth of P. furiosus on β-glucans.

This most probably reflects the physiological role of these enzymes: cooperation during growth of P. furiosus on β-glucans. β-1,3-glucanases are widely distributed among bacteria, fungi, and higher plants. They are classified as exo-β-1,3-glucanases (β-1,3-glucan glucohydrolase (EC 3.2.1.58)) and endo-β-1,3-glucanases (β-1,3-glucan glucanohydrolase (EC 3.2.1.6and EC 3.2.1.39)). Distinct physiological roles of β-1,3-glucanases have been proposed. In plants, involvement in cell differentiation and defense against fungal pathogens has been suggested (1Grenier J. Potvin C. Asselin A. Plant Physiol. 1993; 103: 1277-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In fungi, β-1,3-glucanases seem to have different functions in morphogenetic processes, β-glucan mobilization, and fungal pathogen-plant interactions (2de la Cruz J. Pintor-Toro J.A. Benitez T. Llobell A. Romero L.C. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6937-6945Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, the first metazoan β-1,3-glucanase, which may be involved in the early embryogenesis, has been described (3Batchman E.S. McClay D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6808-6813Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In bacteria, a metabolic function has been reported for endo-β-1,3-glucanases and endo-β-1,3-1,4-glucanases (4Watanabe T. Kasahara N. Aida K. Tanaka H. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 186-190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both types of bacterial enzymes are polysaccharide endohydrolases with closely related specificities (5Chen L. Fincher G.B. Hoj P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13318-13326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Varghese J.N. Garrett T.P. Colman P.M. Chen L. Hoj P.B. Fincher G.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In contrast, β-1,3-1,4-glucanases catalyze the hydrolysis of 1,4-β-glucosyl linkages only when the glucosyl residue itself is linked at the O-3 position (7Parrish F.W. Perlin A.S. Reese E.T. Can. J.

All bacterial endo-β-1,3-glucanases (laminarases) known to date share sequence similarity with endo-β-1,3-1,4-glucanases (lichenases) and have been classified in the same family 16 of glycosyl hydrolases (29Henrissat B.

On the other hand, eukaryal endo-β-1,3-1,4-glucanases and endo-β-1,3-glucanases have been classified in family 17 of glycosyl hydrolases. However, the first metazoan β-1,3-glucanase, obtained from a sea urchin, shares homology with both β-1,3- and β-1,3-1,4-glucanases of glycosyl hydrolase family 16 (3Batchman E.S. McClay D.R. Proc.

The P. furiosus lamA gene was characterized and found to encode a secreted endo-β-1,3-glucanase belonging to glycosyl hydrolase family 16. Further characterization of the overproduced catalytic domain of this enzyme revealed that it was the most thermostable endo-β-1,3-glucanase detected so far. A mutant form of the catalytic domain was obtained after site-directed mutagenesis of the lamA gene and revealed that a conserved methionine residue is required for full activity. Based on the specificity of the endo-β-1,3-glucanase and the capacity of P. furiosus to grow on laminarin (described herein), a role for this extracellular enzyme during the fermentation of β-1,3-linked glucose polymer is proposed. P. furiosus (DSM 3638) was used in this study (32Kengen S.W. Luesink E.J. Stams A.J. Zehnder A.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) harboring pLysE (39Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6005) Google Scholar) was used as the host strain for the recombinant plasmid of pGEF+ (a pET3d derivative; Ref. 38Rink R. Fennema M. Smids M. Dehmel U. Janssen D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14650-14657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). E. coli TG1 was used as the host strain for the cloning vectors pLUW530 and pLUW531 (40.Gibson, T. J. (1984) Studies on the Epstein-Barr-Virus genome. Ph.D. thesis, Cambridge University, Cambridge, United Kingdom.Google Scholar). E. coli was grown in LB medium in a rotary shaker at 37 °C. Ampicillin was added to LB medium in a final concentration of 100 μg/ml. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added at a final concentration of 0.4 mm for the induction of gene expression. A 4.8-kilobase pair fragment containing the lamA gene coding for P. furiosus endo-β-1,3-glucanase was cloned into pTZ19R (41Voorhorst W.G.B. Eggen R.I.L. Luesink E.J. de Vos W.M. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 7105-7111Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on its sequence, primers were designed to amplify the lamAgene by the polymerase chain reaction on a DNA Thermal Cycler (Perkin-Elmer Corp., Norwalk, CT) (Fig.1). The two primers (with NcoI and BamHI restriction sites in boldface), were as follows: BG 194, 5′-GCGCGCCATGGTCCCTGAAGTGATAGAAATAGAT, sense; and BG 195, 5′-CGCGCGGATCCTCAACCACTAACGAATGAGTA, antisense. In addition to the template and the primers, the 100-μl reaction mixture contained 0.2 mm dNTPs, Taq DNA polymerase buffer, 5 mm MgCl2, and 5 units ofTaq DNA polymerase (Life Technologies Inc.) and was subjected to 30 cycles of amplification (30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 50 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C). The putative signal peptide of the endoglucanase was excluded to produce the mature enzyme in the cytoplasm of E. coli. A polymerase chain reaction product with the expected size was digested with NcoI andBamHI, cloned in a pGEF+ vector (38Rink R. Fennema M. Smids M. Dehmel U. Janssen D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14650-14657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), resulting in pLUW530, and transformed into E. coli TG1 and BL21 (DE3), pLysE using standard procedures (42Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). An overnight culture of E. coliBL21 (DE3), pLysE harboring pLUW530 was diluted 1:20 and grown until the A 600 reached 0.6. The culture was induced with 0.4 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 4 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 100 mmsodium citrate buffer (pH 5.5), and sonicated using a Branson sonifier. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation (10,000 × gfor 10 min). The resulting supernatant was heated for 30 min at 70 °C, and precipitated proteins were removed by another centrifugation. The supernatant was subsequently dialyzed against Tris-HCl buffer (20 mm, pH 8.0) and loaded on a Q-Sepharose Fast Flow column (Pharmacia) (5 × 25 cm) that was equilibrated with the same buffer. Bound proteins were eluted by a linear gradient of NaCl (0–1 m in Tris-HCl buffer). Active fractions eluted around 0.5 m NaCl. Protein samples were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) 1The abbreviation used is: PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. using the method of Laemmli (43Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar). Proteins samples for SDS-PAGE were prepared by heating for 10 min at 110 °C in an equal volume of sample buffer (0.1m citrate-phosphate buffer, 5% SDS, 0.9% 2-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol, pH 6.8). The standard assay for β-glucanase activity was carried out at 80 °C, for 10 min, using 0.5% (w/v) laminarin (Sigma) as substrate in 0.1 m phosphate (NaH2PO4, K2HPO4) buffer (pH 6.5). The reducing sugars released were detected by the dinitrosalicylic acid method, with glucose as a standard (44Summer J.B. Somers G.F. Dinitrosalisylic Method for Glucose: Laboratory Experiments in Biological Chemistry. Academic Press, NY1949Google Scholar). Enzyme and substrate blanks were also included. 1 unit of enzyme activity was defined as the amount of enzyme required to release 1 μmol of reducing sugars/min. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford, with bovine serum albumin as the standard (45Bradford M.M. Anal Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). Antibodies were raised against LamA by injecting enzyme purified fromE. coli into rabbits. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE before Western blotting onto nitrocellulose filters. The blots were incubated with serum containing antibodies raised against LamA (dilution, 1:1000). The reaction of proteins with the antibodies was detected using the alkaline phosphatase system (Promega). The optimal temperature was determined by running the standard assay at temperatures from 40 to 115 °C. The optimal pH of the enzyme was determined by running the standard assay at 80 °C using citrate-phosphate (citric acid, NaH2PO4) buffer (0.1 m) and phosphate (NaH2PO4, K2HPO4) buffer (0.1 m) for pH ranges 4–7 and 6–8, respectively. Thermostability was determined using diluted enzyme (0.14 mg/ml pure enzyme was diluted 10 times in 200 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 6.5), incubated at 80, 90, and 100 °C. Samples were taken at time intervals, and residual activity was determined by the standard assay at 80 °C. Michaelis-Menten constants were determined from Lineweaver-Burk representations of data obtained by determining the initial rate of laminarin and lichenan hydrolysis under the assay conditions described above and using a range of 0.25–10 mg of substrate/ml. The plasmid pLUW500, carrying the lamA gene, was used as a template for mutagenesis following the splicing by overlap extension polymerase chain reaction (46Ho N.S. Pullen J.K. Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Pease L.R. DNA Protein Eng. Tech. 1990; 2: 50-55Google Scholar). The first step comprised the use of primers introducing the mutation and the two flanking primers (BG 194 and BG 195), described above. The two mutagenesis primers were as follows: BG 227, 5′-GCCAAGGAATTCTATGTCTATTTCTCCACAATTTGGC, antisense; and BG 226, 5′-GAAATAGACATAGAATTCCTTGGCCATGAGCAA, sense. The second step used the overlapping products of the first two polymerase chain reactions as a template and the flanking primers (BG 194 and BG 195) to yield the lamA gene with the mutation. To simplify detection of mutants, an EcoRI site (in boldface in the primers, above) was created. The amplified DNA was cloned as aHindIII/BamHI fragment into the lamAgene in pLUW530. The mutation was checked by EcoRI digestion and DNA sequence analysis. The resulting plasmid (pLUW531) was transformed to E. coli BL21 (DE3), pLysE for overproduction of the protein. Nucleotide sequencing was performed by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method (47Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52674) Google Scholar) with a Li-Cor automatic sequencing system (model 4000L). Computer analysis of sequencing data was performed by using the PC/GENE program, version 5.01 (IntelliGenetics Inc., Moutain View, CA) and the GCG package, version 7.0, at the CAOS/CAMM Center of the University of Nijmegen (Nijmegen, The Netherlands). The nucleotide sequence of a part of the 4.8-kilobase pair DNA insert from pLUW500 (41Voorhorst W.G.B. Eggen R.I.L. Luesink E.J. de Vos W.M. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 7105-7111Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) 2W. G. B. Voorhorst, manuscript in preparation. revealed the presence of an 894-bp open reading frame (Fig. 1). The encoded 297-amino acid protein was found to be homologous to a family bacterial β-1,3- and β-1,3-1,4-endoglucanases (see below) and contains a putative signal peptide of 20 residues (49Gierasch L.M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 923-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). The molecular mass of the predicted mature protein was found to be 31,550 Da, and the estimated isoelectric point was 5.15. To overproduce this β-glucanase, the lamA gene was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction method and cloned into pGEF+ (38Rink R. Fennema M. Smids M. Dehmel U. Janssen D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14650-14657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) under control of the T7 promoter (39Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6005) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid, containing the catalytic domain of the endo-β-1,3-glucanase (starting at residue 35 and called LamA), was named pLUW530. The plamid pLUW530, harboring lamA, was checked by DNA sequence analysis. Comparison of the deduced primary structure of lamA with enzymes present in the GenBank Data Base indicated that the highest similarity was with representatives of family 16 of glycosyl hydrolases, which includes bacterial endo-β-1,3- and endo-β-1,3-1,4-glucanases,Streptomyces coelicolor agarase, and Alteromonas carrageenovora κ-carrageenase. Scores of 52.4 and 46.9% identity were found with the β-glucanases of T. neapolitana and O. xanthineolytica, respectively. Multiple alignments of the deduced amino acid sequence of P. furiosus lamA and other β-glucanases showed many conserved amino acids (Fig. 2), including glutamate 170 and glutamate 175 (P. furiosus amino acid numbering is used throughout the paper).

Glutamate 175 corresponds to the general acid, and glutamate 170 corresponds to the catalytic nucleophile or plays a role in electrostatic stabilization of an oxocarbonium intermediate ion (55Sinnot M.L. Chem. Rev. 1990; 90: 1171-1202Crossref Scopus (1492) Google Scholar). Moreover, the crystal structure of the hybrid Bacillus β-1,3-1,4-β-glucanase (52Keitel T. Simon O. Borriss R. Heinemann U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5287-5291Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) showed the presence of a calcium binding site on the surface of the enzyme. Experiments demonstrated that calcium, bound to the hybridBacillus enzyme, stabilizes the three-dimensional structure of the protein, leading to increased thermal stability (56Keitel T. Meldegaard M. Heinemann U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 203-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 57Welfle K. Misselwitz R. Welfle H. Politz O. Borriss R. Eur. J.

Villa T.G. del Rey F. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 2160-2167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), glycine 78(45Bradford M.M. Anal Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar) and aspartate 287 (207) and to the carboxylate oxygen of aspartate 287 (207) (italic numbers correspond to Bacillus hybrid β-glucanase numbering (52Keitel T. Simon O. Borriss R. Heinemann U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5287-5291Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar)). This aspartate 287 residue is conserved among most of the β-glucanases of the family 16 (Fig. 2). The P. furiosusβ-1,3-glucanase also contains this aspartate residue, and this enzyme was indeed found to be protected by calcium against thermal inactivation as well (data not shown). To characterize P furiosusendo-β-1,3-glucanase, we overexpressed its catalytic domain, hereafter called LamA, in E. coli BL21 (DE3), pLysE. TheE. coli strain harboring the plasmid pLUW530 was grown untill mid-log phase and induced by isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. SDS-PAGE analysis of cell free extract of induced cells revealed an additional band of 30-kDa, corresponding with the calculated molecular mass of thelamA product (Fig. 3). The 30-kDa band was absent in extracts of E. coli BL21 (DE3), pLysE carrying the pGEF+ plasmid without insert (Fig. 3). The level of LamA production in E. coli harboring pLUW530 was found to be 150 units/mg of total protein. Using this expression system, LamA was produced in a soluble form, with levels of up to 15% of the total cell protein. LamA could easily be purified to homogeneity by a two-step purification procedure consisting of a heat incubation (30 min at 70 °C) that resulted in the denaturation of the majority of theE. coli proteins, followed by an anion exchange chromatography step (data not shown). About 7-fold purification was obtained, and the isolated enzyme was estimated by SDS-PAGE to be at least 95% pure (Fig. 3). The specific enzyme activities of the purified LamA β-glucanase with various substrates are summarized in Table I. Control extracts from E. coli carrying pGEF+ did not degrade the tested substrates. These results indicate that LamA has the highest specificity for the soluble β-1,3-glucan laminarin. A 10-fold lower activity was observed on β-1,3-1,4-linked glucans, such as lichenan and barley β-glucan. The β-1,4-linked substrates (carboxymethyl cellulose, cellulose, and xylan) were not hydrolyzed. Based on the substrate specificity, the LamA enzyme produced in E. coliwas characterized as β-1,3-glucanase (laminarase; EC 3.2.1.39). The mode of action of LamA was examined by analyzing the corresponding hydrolysis products by high performance liquid chromatography (Fig.4). The enzyme cleaved laminarin randomly, yielding glucose, laminaribiose, and higher laminari-oligosaccharides. These results confirm that LamA is an endo-β-1,3-glucanase. The combined action of LamA and CelB (an exo-β-glycosidase from P. furiosus (32Kengen S.W. Luesink E.J. Stams A.J. Zehnder A.J. Eur. J.

The incubation of laminarin under the same conditions with CelB only resulted in the degradation of 5% of the laminarin, with only glucose as end product.Table ISubstrate specificity of the purified endo-β-1,3-glucanase of P. furiosusSubstrateMain linkage type (monomer)1-aND, non detectable.Specific activityunits/mgLaminarinβ-1,3(Glc)922Lichenanβ-1,3–1,4(Glc)95Barley β-glucanβ-1,3–1,4(Glc)99PNPCβ-1,4(Glc)ND1-aND, non detectable.Celluloseβ-1,4(Glc)NDCM celluloseβ-1,4(Glc)NDXylanβ-1,4(Xyl)NDChitinβ-1,4(GlcNAc)NDEnzyme activity was measured in 100 mm phosphate buffer at pH 6.5 for 5 min.

The laminarase enzyme activity was investigated at different pH values and temperatures (Fig. 5). The optimal pH was found to be 6–6.5. The enzyme exhibited at least 80% of its optimal activity over a rather broad pH range, from 5 to 7 (Fig.5 A). The temperature for maximum activity was 100–105 °C. The enzyme was almost inactive at 40 °C and began to show significant activity above 60 °C (Fig. 5 B). Thermal stability was investigated by incubating the pure enzyme for up to 110 h at different temperatures (Fig.6). The enzyme retained 100% of its laminarase activity after 110 h of incubation at 80 °C. At higher temperatures, thermostability decreased: at 90 °C and 100 °C, the enzyme showed a half-life of 64 and 19 h, respectively. At 110 °C, the enzyme was rapidly inactivated, with a half-life of only 15 min (data not shown).Figure 6Thermal stability of the P. furiosus endo-β-1,3-glucanase.

In the GTP-bound state, Ral proteins bind to RalBP1, a GTPase-activating protein for CDC42 and Rac GTPases. We have used the two-hybrid system in yeast to clone a cDNA for a novel ∼85-kDa protein that can bind to an additional site on RalBP1. This newly identified protein contains an Eps homology (EH) domain, which was first detected in the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor substrate Eps15. Recently, the EH domain of Eps15 has been shown to bind to proteins containing an asparagine-proline-phenylalanine motif. Moreover, EH domains have been found in proteins involved in endocytosis and/or actin cytoskeleton regulation. The RalBP1 associated Eps-homology domain protein, Reps1, is tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to EGF stimulation of cells. In addition, Reps1 has the capacity to form a complex with the SH3 domains of the adapter proteins Crk and Grb2, which may link Reps1 to an EGF-responsive tyrosine kinase. Thus, Reps1 may coordinate the cellular actions of activated EGF receptors and Ral-GTPases. Ral proteins constitute a family of small GTPases that can be activated by Ras in cells.

EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2203-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Like all GTPases, Ral proteins cycle between the active GTP bound and inactive GDP bound states. Activation of Ral proteins occurs upon interaction with a Ral-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor (for review, see Ref. 2Feig L.A. Urano T. Cantor S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 438-441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). This promotes the release of GDP from Ral, allowing activating GTP to take its place. Deactivation takes place when bound GTP is hydrolyzed back to GDP upon interaction of Ral with a specific GTPase-activating protein, Ral-GAP (3Emkey R. Freedman S. Feig L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9703-9706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is likely that Ral proteins act as molecular switches that become active in response to specific upstream signals and then alter the activities of specific downstream target proteins. A series of recent findings support the idea that Ras proteins are important upstream activators of Ral proteins. In particular, it has been shown that active GTP-bound Ras binds to (4Hofer F.

EMBO J. 1996; 16: 810-816Crossref Scopus (300) Google Scholar) Ral-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factors, which then activate Ral proteins in cells. Thus, activation of Ral-GTPases appears to constitute a distinct downstream signaling pathway from Ras (for review, see Ref. 2Feig L.A. Urano T. Cantor S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 438-441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Studies are beginning to reveal how Ral proteins contribute to Ras signaling. Overexpression of Ral-GDS (8White M.A. Vale T. Camonis J.H. Schaefer E. Wigler M.H. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1996; 16: 810-816Crossref Scopus (300) Google Scholar) can enhance cellular transformation induced by Ras, and expression of a dominant negative form of Ral can suppress Ras-induced transformation (7Urano T. Emkey R. Feig L.A. EMBO J. 1996; 16: 810-816Crossref Scopus (300) Google Scholar). This phenomenon may occur, in part, by a contribution of Ral to fos gene activation (9Okazaki M. Kishida S. Hinoi T. Hasegawa T. Tamada M. Kataoka T. Kikuchi A. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 515-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Two signaling molecules have been identified that may be affected by Ral protein activity. The first is phospholipase D (PLD), 1The abbreviations used are: PLD, phospholipase D; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; RalBP1, Ral-binding protein 1; Reps1, RalBP1-associated Eps homology domain protein; EH, Eps homology; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; Ral-GDS, Ral-GDP dissociation stimulator; aa, amino acids. which converts phosphatidylcholine to phosphatidic acid. Phosphatidic acid is itself biologically active, but can also be rapidly converted to diacylglycerol, which can then activate protein kinase C isoforms. It is thought that PLD1 is constitutively associated with the N terminus of Ral proteins (10Jiang H. Luo J.-Q. Urano T. Lu Z. Foster D.A. Feig L.A.

Upon Ral activation by Ras, PLD appears to be targeted to a specific signaling complex where its catalytic activity may be elevated by Arf or Rho family GTPases (for review, see Ref.12Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15579-15582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). A second target of Ral may be RalBP1 (also called RLIP or RLP) (13Cantor S. Urano T. Feig L.A. Mol Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4578-4584Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 14Jullien-Flores V. Dorseuil O. Romero F. Letourneur F. Saragosti S. Berger R. Tavitian A. Gacon G. Camonis J.H. J.

This protein was identified by its ability to bind specifically to active GTP-bound Ral. RalBP1 has been shown to be a GAP for CDC42 and Rac, Ras-related GTPases that influence the actin cytoskeleton and the Jun kinase signal transduction pathway (16Ridley A.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 24-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In this paper, we identify another potential binding partner for RalBP1. This protein has an Eps homology (EH) domain and becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to EGF signaling. Thus,RalBP1 associated Eps domain-containing protein (Reps1) may mediate an additional function of RalBP1, and therefore Ral, in cells. For two-hybrid screening, RalBP1 cDNA was subcloned as a fusion protein with the DNA binding domain of Gal4, into pAS-CY2 (17Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.-L. Yeh S.-H. Yang Y. Kilourn A.E. Lee W.-H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar). A mouse cDNA library, derived from a differentiated C2C12 muscle cell line and expressed as fusion proteins with the activation domain of GAl4 in pACT, was kindly provided by Dr. Amy Yee (Tufts Medical School) (18Tevosian S.G. Shih H.H. Mendelson K.G. Sheppard K.A. Paulson K.E. Yee A.S. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 383-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The Saccharomyces cerevisiae Y190 (MATa gal4 gal80 his3 trp1–901 ade2–101 ura3–52 leu2–3, 112 URA3:: GAL-lacZ LYS2::GAL-HIS3, cyhr) strain, expressing a GAL4 DNA-binding domain/Ral-BP1 fusion protein, was transformed with the pACT library, and 2.3 × 106 primary transformants were selected for growth on medium lacking leucine, tryptophan, and histidine and containing 30 mm 3-aminotriazole. The plates were incubated at 30 °C for 3 days. Surviving yeast colonies were transferred to nitrocellulose and laid onto minimal media plates containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactoside and screened for expression of β-galactosidase, by incubation at 30 °C for 1 to 2 days. Blue coloration of a colony was indicative of a positive interaction. His+ LacZ+ colonies were rescued from the plate and grown in selective media. Plasmid DNA was recovered and introduced by electroporation into the leucine deficient Escherichia colistrain, KC8. Transformants were plated on minimal media lacking leucine so that only transformants carrying the library plasmid grew. Positives were tested for target specificity by re-transformation into the reporter strain Y190 alone, in conjunction with the RalBP1-Gal4 DNA-binding domain fusion, or with different Gal4 DNA-binding domain fusions. Only library plasmids that did not activate marker expression on their own or in the presence of a negative control construct, SNF1, were analyzed further. Additional mouse Reps cDNAs were isolated from an oligo(dT) and randomly primed mouse testis library (CLONTECH) by DNA hybridization, using the ∼500-base pair Reps1 clone isolated from the two-hybrid system as a probe. The 5′-end of the cDNA (last 5 codons plus 5′-untranslated region) was then cloned by 5′-RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends), using a mouse brain cDNA library as template and terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase to create poly(C) 5′-ends for primer annealing with a poly(G) primer (containing anEcoRI site at the 5′-end). The entire coding sequence for Reps1 was cloned into pBSK. The sequence of Reps1 cDNA was determined on both strands by the dideoxy chain termination technique, using multiple cDNA clones and subclones. GST-Reps1 (599–743) was generated by subcloning the partial cDNA isolated from the two-hybrid system into pGEX3. Full-length RalBP1 and fragments of it were expressed with N-terminal Myc epitope tags by cloning RalBP1 cDNAs into pJ3M. Full-length RalBP1 was cloned as a BamHI-KpnI fragment. RalBP1 (aa 1–500) was cloned as aBamHI-EcoRI fragment, while RalBP1 (aa 200–647) was cloned as a BglII fragment. Glu-tagged RalBP1 construction was described previously (13Cantor S. Urano T. Feig L.A. Mol Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4578-4584Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Myc-tagged Reps was generated by cloning full-length Reps from pBSK into pJ3M as anEcoRI fragment. COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% iron-enriched calf serum (HyClone) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Cells were plated at a density of ∼5 × 105cells/60-mm plate one day before transfection. pMT3 (19Swick A.G. Janicot M. Cheneval-Kastelic T. McLenithan J.C. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1812-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) or pJ3M, containing a Myc epitope tag, were used for the transient expression of the cDNAs in COS-7 cells using the DEAE-dextran method. For in vitro binding assays between Reps1 and RalBP1, 1–3 μg of GST-Reps protein bound to 25 μl of glutathione beads were incubated with 500 μl of a COS7 cell lysate derived from one 10-cm dish of semiconfluent cells. The cells had been transiently transfected with Myc-RalBP1 or segments of RalBP1 containing a Myc epitope tag and then lysed in 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), containing 10 mm MgCl2, 20 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. After washing beads in binding buffer, the precipitates were run on SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-Myc monoclonal antibodies, 9E10, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Blots were visualized by using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagents (Amersham Corp.). In vitro binding assays between SH3 domains and Reps1 were performed as above, except that 5 μg of GST- SH3 domains (kindly provided by Dr. Bruce Meyer (Harvard Medical School) were substituted for GST-Reps1. For in vivo binding assays between Reps1 and RalBP1, transiently transfected COS7 cells (one 10-cm dish of semiconfluent cells) were lysed in 500 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), containing 10 mm MgCl2, 20 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. Anti-Glu antibodies (kindly provided by S. Powers, Onyx Pharmaceuticals) were added for 60 min, followed by protein A-Sepharose. After washing the beads with binding buffer, the samples were fractionated by SDS-PAGE. The gels were then blotted with anti-Myc antibodies and then incubated with horseradish-conjugated secondary antibodies. Cell lysates were also run directly on gels and immunoblotted with either anti-Myc or anti-Glu antibodies to verify Reps1 and RalBP1 expression. Blots were visualized as describe above. To identify new functions for RalBP1, the protein was used as bait in the yeast two-hybrid system. A yeast reporter strain, expressing a RalBP1/GAL4 DNA-binding domain fusion, was transformed with a mouse muscle cell cDNA library expressed as fusions with the GAL4 activation domain (17Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.-L. Yeh S.-H. Yang Y. Kilourn A.E. Lee W.-H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar). From 106 primary transformants, 15 survived the initial histidine selection and only one was also positive for the secondary screen (expression of β-galactosidase) and the tertiary screen (binding to RalBP1 in vitro (see below)). This ∼500-base pair clone was used as a probe to clone additional cDNA sequences by hybridization with a λGT10 cDNA library. Finally, the N-terminal end of the cDNA was cloned by 5′-RACE. One continuous open reading frame was detected that encodes a 743 amino acid protein (Fig. 1 A). The cDNA clone was used as a probe in a Northern blot of RNA isolated from a variety of rat tissues. One major band, with a size of ∼3.5 kilobases, was observed in all tissues examined (data not shown). The highest level of expression was found in kidney and testis. The amino acid sequence encoded by the cDNA was then compared with known proteins. Although this protein was novel, significant sequence similarity (between 38 and 50% identity) was found between amino acids 237 and 298 and the EH domains present in a variety of proteins (20Wong W.T. Schumacher C. Salcini A.E. Romano A. Castagnino P. Pelicci P.G. Di Fiore P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9530-9534Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). These include the human Eps15 and Eps15-related (Eps15r) proteins, which each contain three EH domains, and S. cerevisiae Pan1 and End3 proteins, which contain two and one EH domains, respectively (Fig. 1, A and B). A putative EF hand resides within many EH domains (see Fig. 1 B), suggesting that they are calcium-binding motifs. Recently it has been shown that the EH domains of Eps15 and Eps15R constitute protein-protein interaction modules that bind to segments of proteins containing the amino acid sequence asparagine-proline-phenylalanine (NPF) (21Salcini A.E. Confalonieri S. Doria M. Santolini E. Tassi E. Minenkova O. Cesareni G. Pelicci P.G. Di Fiore P.P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2239-2249Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Thus, one function of Reps may be to interact with a specific protein containing this motif. Based on the possible importance of the EH domain, we have called this RalBP1-binding protein, RalBP1-associatedEps homology protein 1 or Reps1. A linear map containing putative functional domains of Reps1 is shown in Fig.1 C. A fusion protein containing glutathione S-transferase (GST) and the coding sequence of the partial Reps1 cDNA clone first isolated from the yeast two-hybrid system (C-terminal amino acids 599–743) was produced in E. coli. After affinity purification on glutathione beads, the immobilized Reps1 protein was incubated with COS cell lysates transfected with various portions of RalBP1, each containing a Myc epitope at its N terminus. After washing the beads, the bound proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-Myc antibodies (Fig. 2 A). Bindingin vitro was observed between the C terminus of Reps-1 and full-length RalBP1, but not the N-terminal 500 amino acids of RalBP-1, which contains a basic α-helix, a CDC42/Rac GAP domain, and a Ral binding site (see Fig. 1 C). Binding was also observed between Reps1 and a C-terminal portion (aa 201–647) of RalBP1 containing the Ral binding site and an extended region of predicted α-helix. Thus, Reps1 binds to a region in the C-terminal region of RalBP-1 that is distinct from the binding sites for Ral and CDC42/Rac (see Fig. 1 C) The C-terminal 43 amino acids of Reps1 (aa 700–743) are predicted to exist as a coiled-coil (Fig. 1, Aand C). A GST fusion construct containing these sequences failed to bind to RalBP1 in vitro (data not shown). Thus, although the coiled-coil may participate in binding to RalBP1, it is not sufficient for binding activity. Myc epitope-tagged Reps and Glu epitope-tagged RalBP1 were transfected either alone or together into COS7 cells. Cell lysates were prepared 24 h later, and RalBP1 was immunoprecipitated with anti-Glu antibodies. The immunoprecipitates were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-Myc antibodies (Fig.2 B). Reps1 protein was clearly detected in RalBP1 immunoprecipitates only when the two proteins were co-expressed. The panels on the left are immunoblots of cell lysates showing that Reps1 and RalBP1 were expressed when the their encoded DNAs were transfected. These results document that Reps1 and RalBP1 can form stable complexes in cells. Eps15 was originally detected because it became tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to EGF. Therefore we tested whether Reps also becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to EGF. COS7 cells were transiently transfected with Myc-Reps1 and then serum starved for 24 h. Duplicate dishes of starved cells were treated with buffer or buffer containing 10 ng/ml EGF for 8 min. Lysates of cells were either run directly on SDS gels and blotted with anti-Myc antibodies to detect Reps1 expression (Fig. 3 A, left) or immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibodies. The immunoprecipitates were then fractionated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-Tyr(P) antibodies. Fig. 3 A (right panel) shows an increase in tyrosine-phosphorylated Reps1 in response to EGF stimulation. This tyrosine phosphorylation may occur just proximal to the EH domain, since a single tyrosine phosphorylation consensus site was detected in Reps1 in sequences surrounding tyrosine 236 (see Fig. 1). Like Eps15, Reps1 also contains polyproline segments, which is suggestive of SH3 binding activity (See Fig. 1 A). One motif between amino acids 531 and 540 contains the sequence P-A-V-P-P-R, which matches the consensus sequence P-X-L-P-X-K found in all proteins known to interact with the SH3 domain of the Crk adapter protein (22Schumacher C. Knudsen B.S. Ohuchi T. Di Fiore P.P. Glassman R.H. Hanafusa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15341-15347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). A similar motif is capable of binding Grb2. Thus, SH3 binding activity of Reps1 was tested by incubating lysates of cells containing Myc-Reps1 with Sepharose beads containing fusion proteins of GST and the SH3 domains of Crk, Grb2 (N- and C-terminal domains tested individually), Src, and Abl. The beads were washed, run on SDS gels, and blotted with anti-Myc antibodies to detect bound Reps1. Fig.3 B shows complexes between Reps1 and GST-Crk(SH3) and GST-Grb2(N-SH3), but not GST-Grb2(C-SH3), GST-Src(SH3), GST-Abl(SH3), or GST alone. These results suggest that Reps1 may form a complex directly with the EGF receptor through the adapter proteins Crk or Grb2. However, we have been unable to detect such a complex in this cell system (data not shown). A growing body of evidence supports the idea that Ras proteins activate a distinct downstream signaling pathway by binding to and activating Ral-specific nucleotide exchange factors. These findings have stimulated interest in defining the function of Ral GTPases. One potential effector of Ral proteins is RalBP1, a 73-kDa protein that binds specifically to the GTP-bound state of Ral proteins (13Cantor S. Urano T. Feig L.A. Mol Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4578-4584Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 14Jullien-Flores V. Dorseuil O. Romero F. Letourneur F. Saragosti S. Berger R. Tavitian A. Gacon G. Camonis J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22473-22477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 15Park S.H. Weinberg R.A. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2349-2355PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to a Ral binding site, RalBP1 contains a GAP domain that inactivates CDC42 and Rac GTPases. Based on its ability to bind to RalBP1, Reps1 is another potential mediator of Ral function. In vitro data presented here argue that Reps binds to a region of RalBP1 that is distinct from the binding sites for Ral and CDC42/Rac. Moreover, transfection studies show that Reps1 and RalBP1 can interact in vivo, although this remains to be documented for their endogenous cellular counterparts. A clue to the function of Reps1 comes from the presence of an EH domain. EH domains were first detected in Eps15 (23Fazioli F. Minichiello L. Matoskova B. Wong W.T. Di Fiore P.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5814-5828Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), which contains three tandem EH motifs of ∼70 amino acids at its N terminus (see Fig.1 B). Recent experiments using peptide libraries and expression cloning have revealed that the EH domains of Eps15 and Eps15r function as binding motifs for proteins that contain the amino acid sequence asparagine-proline-phenylalanine (NPF) (21Salcini A.E. Confalonieri S. Doria M. Santolini E. Tassi E. Minenkova O. Cesareni G. Pelicci P.G. Di Fiore P.P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2239-2249Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Like other protein-interacting domains, the amino acids neighboring these core sequences were also found to be important and may contribute to binding specificity. Biochemical analysis strongly suggests that Eps15 is involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis in mammalian cells. Eps15 has been detected in the clathrin-coated vesicles, where it is constitutively associated with α-adaptin (24van Delft S. Schumacher C. Hage W. Verkleij A.J. van Bergen en Henegouwen P.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 811-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 25Tebar F. Sorkina T. Sorkin A. Ericsson M. Kirchhausen T. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 12111-12116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Eps15 is also complexed with the light chain of clathrin (24van Delft S. Schumacher C. Hage W. Verkleij A.J. van Bergen en Henegouwen P.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 811-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Finally, Eps15 can bind to the SH3 domain of the Crk adapter molecule, which may promote its association with activated EGF receptors (22Schumacher C. Knudsen B.S. Ohuchi T. Di Fiore P.P. Glassman R.H. Hanafusa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15341-15347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 27Matsuda M. Ota S. Tanimura R. Nakamura H. Matuoka K. Takenawa T. Nagashima K. Kurata T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14468-14472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). These findings have led to the hypothesis that Eps 15 promotes the association of EGF receptor with newly forming coated vesicles, an early step in the internalization and down-regulation of the receptor. Support for the idea that EH domains, in particular, participate in endocytosis comes from studies on the EH domain yeast proteins End3 and Pan1. S. cerevisiae expressing mutant End3 or Pan1 proteins display defects in both receptor-mediated and fluid phase endocytosis (28Tang H.Y. Munn A. Cai M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4294-4304Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 29Benedetti H. Raths S. Crausaz F. Riezman H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 1023-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). In addition, evidence points to a role of these EH domain proteins in cortical actin cytoskeleton-related processes (28Tang H.Y. Munn A. Cai M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4294-4304Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 29Benedetti H. Raths S. Crausaz F. Riezman H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 1023-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). For example, altering the activity of Pan1 results in an abnormal distribution of the actin cytoskeleton. The presence of an EH domain in Reps1 suggests this protein may also influence endocytosis and/or the actin cytoskeleton. Interestingly, Eps15 and Reps1 have additional features in common. Like Eps15, Reps1 becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to EGF stimulation. Although the site of tyrosine phosphorylation has not been mapped for either protein, both have a single consensus tyrosine phosphorylation immediately N-terminal to an EH domain. Both proteins also have the capacity to bind to the SH3 domain of the adapter protein Crk. This may allow Reps1 to form a complex with the EGF receptor. However, we have not been able to detect such a complex in the cell system we have used. For Eps15, a complex with the EGF receptor has been detected only in cells overexpressing the EGF receptor (24van Delft S. Schumacher C. Hage W. Verkleij A.J. van Bergen en Henegouwen P.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 811-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Finally, both Reps and Eps15 have a coiled-coil region. In Eps15 this region is in the middle of the protein, and appears to promote homo-oligomerization (30Tebar F. Confalonieri S. Carter R.E. Di Fiore P.P. Sorkin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15413-15418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In Reps1, the coiled-coil is at the extreme C terminus. It cannot bind RalBP1 on its own, raising the possibility that Reps1 may also homodimerize. A major distinction between Reps1 and Eps15 is that the C terminus of the latter contains repeats of aspartate, proline, and phenylalanine, which are responsible for the constitutive association of Eps15 with clathrin-coated vesicles (31Iannolo G. Salcini A.E. Gaidarov I. Goodman O.B. Baulida J. Carpenter G. Pelicci P.G. Di Fiore P.P. Keen J.H. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 240-245PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, Reps1 contains a RalBP1 binding site at a comparable region of the protein. Presumably, this leads to the regulated localization of Reps1 to a site in the cell where Ral exists. Ral proteins have been detected in plasma membrane fractions, where they are thought to become activated by Ras-induced activation of Ral-specific nucleotide exchange factors. 2R. Emkey and L. A. Feig, unpublished observations. However, a majority of Ral proteins are found in intracellular vesicles, including clathrin coated vesicles as well as exocytic vesicles (32Feig L.A. Emkey L.A. McCormick F. Lacal J.C. The ras Superfamily of GTPases. CRC Press, London1993: 247-258Google Scholar, 33Bielinski D.F. Pyun N.Y. Linko-Stentz K. Macara I. Fine R.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1151: 246-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Thus, Reps1 may function at the cell surface or in vesicles. What does this imply about the function of Reps? Based on the information gained from experiments reported here, and previous work on Ral GTPases, a model of potential protein-protein interactions involving Reps1 is shown in Fig. 4. EGF receptor may influence Reps1 in two ways. First, EGF receptor activation leads to the tyrosine phosphorylation of Reps1. Like Eps15, this tyrosine phosphorylation may be promoted by an adapter protein that connects the kinase to its substrate. Moreover, the site of tyrosine phosphorylation on both proteins may be directly proximal to the EH domain. Thus, for both proteins tyrosine phosphorylation may influence EH domain function directly by altering its activity or indirectly by producing a docking site for an SH2 domain protein that can interact with the EH domain. EGF receptor stimulation also leads to the activation of Ras, which can activate Ral and lead to the association of Ral with RalBP1. In this way, a signaling complex connecting EGF receptor, Ral, RalBP1 and tyrosine-phosphorylated Reps1 may be promoted (see Fig. 4). Since Ral has been shown to be constitutively associated with PLD1 (10Jiang H. Luo J.-Q. Urano T. Lu Z. Foster D.A. Feig L.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 409-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 11Luo J.-Q. Liu X. Hammond S.M. Colley W.C. Feig L.A. Frohman M.A. Morris A.J. Foster D.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 854-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), this enzyme may also be part of this signaling complex. Interestingly, the known biochemical activities of these signaling molecules are consistent with their participation, along with the EH domain of Reps1, in the regulation of endocytosis and/or the cytoskeleton. For example, RalBP1 is known to be a GAP for CDC42 and Rac. Thus, it has the capacity to inhibit these two actin-regulating GTPases. Since Rac has also been shown to negatively influence receptor-mediated endocytosis (34Lamaze C. Chuang T.H. Terlecky L.J. Bokoch G.M. Schmid S.L. Nature. 1996; 382: 177-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), RalBP1 could have a positive influence on this process. Furthermore, a growing body of evidence supports a role for phospholipase D in the promotion of vesicle budding, possibly through its ability to enhance the production of phosphatidic acid (35Ktistakis N.T. Brown H.A. Waters M.G. Sternweis P.C. Roth M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 295-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 36Bi K. Roth M.G. Ktistakis N.T. Curr.

Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 495-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Future studies will attempt to identify proteins that interact with the Reps1 EH domain. Based on studies on the EH domain of Eps15, these proteins will contain NPF motifs. Their biochemical activities may yield insight into the function of both EGF receptor and Ral GTPase signaling mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2012163593,"Mechano-sensitive regulation of endothelial cells (EC) function by shear stress is critical for flow-induced vasodilation and gene expression. Previous studies by our laboratory demonstrated that shear stress activates the 44- and 42-kDa extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2) in EC in a time- and force-dependent manner. ERK1/2 activation was inhibited by protein kinase C (PKC) down-regulation with phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (1 μm for 24 h) but not by calcium chelation with BAPTA-AM (acetoxymethyl ester of BAPTA) (75 μm for 30 min), suggesting that a novel PKC isoform (δ, ε, η, θ) mediates shear stress-induced ERK1/2 activation. Western blotting with PKC isoform-specific antibodies demonstrated expression of PKC-α, -ε, and -ζ isoforms in EC. PKC-ε was specifically inhibited by transfection with antisense PKC-ε phosphorothioate oligonucleotides (1,000 nm for 6 h). Antisense treatment decreased PKC-ε protein levels by 80 ± 13% after 72 h and completely inhibited shear stress-stimulated ERK1/2 activation. Scrambled PKC-ε oligonucleotides and antisense PKC-α and PKC-ζ oligonucleotides had no effect on ERK1/2 activity. PKC-ε appeared specific for mechano-sensitive ERK1/2 activation, as antisense PKC-ε oligonucleotides did not inhibit ERK1/2 activation by EGF or bradykinin but did inhibit ERK1/2 activation upon EC adhesion to fibronectin. These results define a pathway for shear stress-mediated ERK1/2 activation and establish a new function for PKC-ε as part of a mechano-sensitive signal transduction pathway in EC.

Scrambled PKC-ε oligonucleotides and antisense PKC-α and PKC-ζ oligonucleotides had no effect on ERK1/2 activity. PKC-ε appeared specific for mechano-sensitive ERK1/2 activation, as antisense PKC-ε oligonucleotides did not inhibit ERK1/2 activation by EGF or bradykinin but did inhibit ERK1/2 activation upon EC adhesion to fibronectin. These results define a pathway for shear stress-mediated ERK1/2 activation and establish a new function for PKC-ε as part of a mechano-sensitive signal transduction pathway in EC. Mechanical stimuli are important modulators of cellular function in tissues, particularly in the cardiovascular system (1Watson P.A. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2013-2019Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar).

Changes in fluid shear stress have been shown to release vasoactive mediators such as nitric oxide (2Furchgott R.F. Vanhoutte P.M. FASEB J. 1989; 3: 2007-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (1669) Google Scholar) as well as modulate gene expression such as c-fos (3Hsieh H.J. Li N.Q. Frangos J.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 154: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), platelet-derived growth factor (4Mitsumata M. Fishel R.S. Nerem R.N. Alexander R.W. Berk B.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: H3-H8Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (5Uematsu M. Navas J.P. Nishida K. Ohara Y. Murphy T.J. Alexander R.W. Nerem R.M. Harrison D.G. Circulation. 1993; 88: I-184Google Scholar). These hemodynamically regulated events may contribute to the pathogenesis of vascular disease, as atherosclerotic plaques are preferentially localized to areas of the vascular system that experience low shear and turbulence (6Ku D.N. Giddens D.P. Zarins C.K. Glagov S. Arteriosclerosis. 1985; 5: 293-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Two members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family, ERK1 and ERK2, which are known to modulate cell physiology and gene expression in many different ways (7Pelech S.L. Sanghera J.S. Science. 1992; 257: 1355-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), have been reported to be activated by shear stress in endothelial cells (8Tseng H. Peterson T. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 869-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). However, whereas growth factor-mediated stimulation of ERK1/2 has been well defined (9Lange-Carter C.A. Pleiman C.M. Gardner A.M. Blumer K.J. Johnson G.L. Science. 1993; 260: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar), the upstream signaling pathway that leads to activation of ERK1/2 by shear stress remains unexplored.Shear stress has also been shown to activate phospholipase C (10Nollert M.U. Eskin S.G. McIntire L.V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 170: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), resulting in the cleavage of phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate into inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, a calcium-mobilizing second messenger, and diacylglycerol, an activator of protein kinase C (PKC). Indeed, recent studies have implicated PKC in cellular responses to shear stress, such as endothelin-1 production (11Kuchan M.J. Frangos J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: H150-H156PubMed Google Scholar), platelet-derived growth factor expression (12Biswas P. Abboud H.E. Kiyomoto H. Wenzel U.O. Grandaliano G. Choudhury G.G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 373: 146-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and cytoskeletal reorganization (13Girard P.R. Nerem R.M. Front. Med. Biol. Eng. 1993; 5: 31-36PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies by our laboratory suggested that PKC is also required for the fluid shear stress-mediated activation of ERK1/2 (8Tseng H. Peterson T. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 869-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). In the current paper, we investigated the role of PKC in the shear stress-mediated signaling and show that PKC-ε but not PKC-α or PKC-ζ is required for ERK1/2 activation by shear stress.DISCUSSIONThe major finding of this study is that PKC-ε is a component of a mechano-sensitive signal transduction pathway that leads to the activation of ERK1/2 in endothelial cells. Further, this pathway is specific for PKC-ε, as PKC-α and PKC-ζ are not required for the activation of ERK1/2. These results, combined with observations from other investigators that shear stress stimulates changes in cellular physiology and gene expression (26Davies P.F. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 519-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (2305) Google Scholar), provide evidence that mechanical stimuli can activate signal transduction pathways in a manner similar to conventional agonist-receptor-initiated signaling events. These results define a pathway for shear stress-mediated ERK1/2 activation and establish a new function for PKC-ε in EC.Two upstream mechanisms for the activation of PKC-ε in response to shear stress may be proposed based on previous studies. First, phospholipase C is activated by shear stress (10Nollert M.U. Eskin S.G. McIntire L.V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 170: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), resulting in the cleavage of phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate and generation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol. PKC-ε is similar to the classical PKC isoforms in that it is activated by diacylglycerol (20Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28495-28498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1466) Google Scholar); thus, one mechanism for activation of PKC-ε is through shear stress-mediated generation of diacylglycerol. Second, other activators of PKC-ε such as phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, may be increased in EC in response to fluid shear stress. Reports show that both of these phosphoinositides generated by PI 3-kinase activity are potent and selective activators of the novel class of PKC isoforms and have little effect on the classical or atypical PKC isoforms (27Liscovitch M. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1994; 77: 329-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). To date, no studies have been published regarding changes in PI 3-kinase activity in response to fluid shear stress. Moriya et al. (28Moriya S. Kazlauskas A. Akimoto K. Hirai S. Mizuno K. Takenawa T. Fukui Y. Watanabe Y. Ozaki S. Ohno S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) reported that both the PI 3-kinase and the phospholipase C pathway can activate PKC-ε in a cell-specific and stimulus-specific manner. The specificity of the PI 3-kinase pathway for the novel PKC isoforms suggests that analysis of PI 3-kinase activity in response to flow will be an interesting area for future studies.The plasma membrane sensor or receptor responsible for transducing mechanical stimuli into biochemical signaling events remains undefined. Several molecules have been proposed as candidate mechanotransducers, including integrins and mechano-sensitive ion channels such as the inward rectifying K+ channel and the stretch-activated Ca2+ channel (26Davies P.F. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 519-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (2305) Google Scholar). Whereas it is unlikely that mechano-sensitive ion channels could result in the selective activation of PKC-ε, integrins have been shown to activate many cellular kinases, including PKC (29Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21459-21462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because antisense PKC-ε oligonucleotides completely inhibited adhesion (i.e. integrin)-induced ERK1/2 activation, the present findings suggest an important role for PKC-ε in integrin-mediated signaling in EC. In two previous studies, we found that integrins played an essential role in activation of ERK1/2 by shear stress in EC (16Takahashi M. Berk B.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2623-2631Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 17Ishida T. Peterson T.E. Kovach N. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 310-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Thus, the present data support the concept that integrins participate as mechanoreceptors, although additional experiments should be performed to determine which integrins activate PKC-ε.Although signal transduction events by which PKC-ε activates ERK1/2 remain to be determined, it seems likely that PKC-ε interacts directly with Raf-1 to activate ERK1/2. Activation of ERK1/2 by growth factors has been shown to occur via activation of Ras and subsequent recruitment of Raf-1 to the plasma membrane. Raf-1, in turn, activates MEK-1, the direct upstream activator of ERK1/2 (7Pelech S.L. Sanghera J.S. Science. 1992; 257: 1355-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). This pathway also appears to be activated in EC by shear stress, since two groups have demonstrated Ras activation by shear (30Li Y.S. Shyy J.Y. Li S. Lee J. Su B. Karin M. Chien S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5947-5954Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 31Jo H. Sipos K. Go Y.-M. Law R. Rong J. McDonald J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1395-1401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). We have shown that inhibiting PKC-ε with antisense oligonucleotides completely blocked shear stress-mediated ERK1/2 activation, indicating that PKC-ε directly participates in the signaling cascade leading to ERK1/2 activation (e.g. by its kinase activity) or that the constitutive presence of PKC-ε is required for normal function of some component of the signaling cascade (e.g. by regulating gene expression). Whereas the current data cannot distinguish between these two possibilities, several recent studies suggest that PKC-ε acts directly on Raf-1. Cai et al. (32Cai H. Smola U. Wixler V. Eisenmann T.-I. Diaz M.-M.T. Moscat J. Rapp U. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 732-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) showed that overexpression of active PKC-ε resulted in increased Raf-1 activity even in the context of dominant negative Ras. These investigators also demonstrated that PKC-ε stimulated Raf-1 in baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells and was able to directly activate Raf in vitro. Schaapet al. (33Schaap D. van der Wal J. Howe L.R. Marshall C.J. van Blillerswijk W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20232-20236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) also found that overexpression of PKC-ε isoform activated ERK1/2, but that ERK1/2 activation was not present if PKC-ε was overexpressed in a dominant-negative Raf-1-expressing cell line. A study by Cacace et al. (34Cacace A.M. Guadagno S.N. Krauss R.S. Fabbro D. Weinstein I.B. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2095-2104PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that PKC-ε acts downstream of Ras but upstream of Raf-1 to induce oncogenic transformation in PC12 cells. Finally, several studies demonstrate that activation of Raf-1 and ERK1/2 in vascular smooth muscle cells by platelet-derived growth factor (35Liao D.F. Duff J.L. Daum G. Pelech S.L. Berk B.C. Circ.

Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1000-1009PubMed Google Scholar) was inhibited by phorbol ester pretreatment or antisense PKC oligonucleotide treatment (23Liao D.-F. Monia B. Dean N. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6146-6150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Whereas these studies suggest that PKC activates ERK1/2 through Raf-1 in vascular smooth muscle as well, studies to determine whether PKC directly phosphorylates and activates Raf-1 in vascular smooth muscle cells are still required to confirm these observations.PKC-ε-mediated activation of ERK1/2 is likely to be an important pathway for the EC response to shear stress. ERK1/2 has been shown to phosphorylate and activate pp90 rsk , leading to phosphorylation of S6 protein and increased protein synthesis. ERK1/2 is an upstream regulator of Elk-1 and may stimulate ternary complex formation, which increases fos expression, which has been shown to be induced by shear stress. ERK1/2 may also be involved in regulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase based on observations that NO production is regulated by shear stress (43Corson M.A. Berk B.C. Navas J.P. Harrison D.G. Circulation. 1993; 88: I-183Google Scholar) and that endothelial nitric oxide synthase has multiple consensus sites for phosphorylation by ERK1/2 (44Berk B.C. Corson M.A. Peterson T.E. Tseng H. J. Biomech. 1995; 28: 1439-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Kuchan and Frangos (45Kuchan M.J. Frangos J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C628-C636Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that whereas initial release of NO was Ca2+-dependent, sustained NO production in response to shear was Ca2+-independent. Since the shear stress signaling pathway involving PKC-ε described in this paper is Ca2+-independent, it may be involved in sustained NO production stimulated by shear stress. Finally, other PKC-ε substrates such as the cytoskeletal proteins, caldesmon (37Horowitz A. Clement-Chomienne O. Walsh M.P. Morgan K.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C589-C594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), calponin (37Horowitz A. Clement-Chomienne O. Walsh M.P. Morgan K.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C589-C594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and filamentous actin (42Prekeris R. Mayhew M.W. Cooper J.B. Terrian D.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 77-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) may contribute to the rearrangement in EC cytoskeleton in chronically induced by flow.The present study demonstrates the utility of antisense PKC oligonucleotides to explore the cellular role of specific PKC isoforms. Whereas the traditional pharmacological PKC inhibitors employed to investigate the role of PKC are likely to possess differential affinities for the separate PKC isoforms, they are unlikely to be specific for individual PKC isoforms. Indeed, in the present study, staurosporine was an effective inhibitor of PKC-α and PKC-ε but did not affect PKC-ζ activity. The use of antisense oligonucleotides has been shown to be effective in several studies (21Dean N.M. McKay R. Condon T.P. Bennett C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16416-16424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Dean N.M. McKay R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11762-11766Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) and, as demonstrated here, can be used to study isoform specific events. In summary, these data are the first to identify a specific PKC isoform required for transduction of mechanical stimuli. Specifically, we showed that PKC-ε, but not PKC-α or PKC-ζ, serves as a mechano-sensitive mediator for activation of ERK1/2 by shear stress in endothelial cells. Further characterization of this signal transduction pathway will yield greater insight into the mechanisms by which mechanical stimuli regulate biological processes of the vascular wall. Mechanical stimuli are important modulators of cellular function in tissues, particularly in the cardiovascular system (1Watson P.A. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2013-2019Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar).

Changes in fluid shear stress have been shown to release vasoactive mediators such as nitric oxide (2Furchgott R.F. Vanhoutte P.M. FASEB J. 1989; 3: 2007-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (1669) Google Scholar) as well as modulate gene expression such as c-fos (3Hsieh H.J. Li N.Q. Frangos J.A. J. Cell.

Circulation. 1993; 88: I-184Google Scholar). These hemodynamically regulated events may contribute to the pathogenesis of vascular disease, as atherosclerotic plaques are preferentially localized to areas of the vascular system that experience low shear and turbulence (6Ku D.N. Giddens D.P. Zarins C.K. Glagov S. Arteriosclerosis. 1985; 5: 293-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family, ERK1 and ERK2, which are known to modulate cell physiology and gene expression in many different ways (7Pelech S.L. Sanghera J.S. Science. 1992; 257: 1355-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), have been reported to be activated by shear stress in endothelial cells (8Tseng H. Peterson T. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 869-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). However, whereas growth factor-mediated stimulation of ERK1/2 has been well defined (9Lange-Carter C.A. Pleiman C.M. Gardner A.M. Blumer K.J. Johnson G.L. Science. 1993; 260: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar), the upstream signaling pathway that leads to activation of ERK1/2 by shear stress remains unexplored. Shear stress has also been shown to activate phospholipase C (10Nollert M.U. Eskin S.G. McIntire L.V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 170: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), resulting in the cleavage of phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate into inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, a calcium-mobilizing second messenger, and diacylglycerol, an activator of protein kinase C (PKC). Indeed, recent studies have implicated PKC in cellular responses to shear stress, such as endothelin-1 production (11Kuchan M.J. Frangos J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: H150-H156PubMed Google Scholar), platelet-derived growth factor expression (12Biswas P. Abboud H.E. Kiyomoto H. Wenzel U.O. Grandaliano G. Choudhury G.G.

Previous studies by our laboratory suggested that PKC is also required for the fluid shear stress-mediated activation of ERK1/2 (8Tseng H. Peterson T. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 869-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). In the current paper, we investigated the role of PKC in the shear stress-mediated signaling and show that PKC-ε but not PKC-α or PKC-ζ is required for ERK1/2 activation by shear stress. DISCUSSIONThe major finding of this study is that PKC-ε is a component of a mechano-sensitive signal transduction pathway that leads to the activation of ERK1/2 in endothelial cells. Further, this pathway is specific for PKC-ε, as PKC-α and PKC-ζ are not required for the activation of ERK1/2. These results, combined with observations from other investigators that shear stress stimulates changes in cellular physiology and gene expression (26Davies P.F. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 519-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (2305) Google Scholar), provide evidence that mechanical stimuli can activate signal transduction pathways in a manner similar to conventional agonist-receptor-initiated signaling events. These results define a pathway for shear stress-mediated ERK1/2 activation and establish a new function for PKC-ε in EC.Two upstream mechanisms for the activation of PKC-ε in response to shear stress may be proposed based on previous studies. First, phospholipase C is activated by shear stress (10Nollert M.U. Eskin S.G. McIntire L.V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 170: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), resulting in the cleavage of phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate and generation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol. PKC-ε is similar to the classical PKC isoforms in that it is activated by diacylglycerol (20Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28495-28498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1466) Google Scholar); thus, one mechanism for activation of PKC-ε is through shear stress-mediated generation of diacylglycerol. Second, other activators of PKC-ε such as phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, may be increased in EC in response to fluid shear stress. Reports show that both of these phosphoinositides generated by PI 3-kinase activity are potent and selective activators of the novel class of PKC isoforms and have little effect on the classical or atypical PKC isoforms (27Liscovitch M. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1994; 77: 329-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). To date, no studies have been published regarding changes in PI 3-kinase activity in response to fluid shear stress. Moriya et al. (28Moriya S. Kazlauskas A. Akimoto K. Hirai S. Mizuno K. Takenawa T. Fukui Y. Watanabe Y. Ozaki S. Ohno S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) reported that both the PI 3-kinase and the phospholipase C pathway can activate PKC-ε in a cell-specific and stimulus-specific manner. The specificity of the PI 3-kinase pathway for the novel PKC isoforms suggests that analysis of PI 3-kinase activity in response to flow will be an interesting area for future studies.The plasma membrane sensor or receptor responsible for transducing mechanical stimuli into biochemical signaling events remains undefined. Several molecules have been proposed as candidate mechanotransducers, including integrins and mechano-sensitive ion channels such as the inward rectifying K+ channel and the stretch-activated Ca2+ channel (26Davies P.F. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 519-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (2305) Google Scholar). Whereas it is unlikely that mechano-sensitive ion channels could result in the selective activation of PKC-ε, integrins have been shown to activate many cellular kinases, including PKC (29Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21459-21462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because antisense PKC-ε oligonucleotides completely inhibited adhesion (i.e. integrin)-induced ERK1/2 activation, the present findings suggest an important role for PKC-ε in integrin-mediated signaling in EC. In two previous studies, we found that integrins played an essential role in activation of ERK1/2 by shear stress in EC (16Takahashi M. Berk B.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2623-2631Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 17Ishida T. Peterson T.E. Kovach N. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 310-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Thus, the present data support the concept that integrins participate as mechanoreceptors, although additional experiments should be performed to determine which integrins activate PKC-ε.Although signal transduction events by which PKC-ε activates ERK1/2 remain to be determined, it seems likely that PKC-ε interacts directly with Raf-1 to activate ERK1/2. Activation of ERK1/2 by growth factors has been shown to occur via activation of Ras and subsequent recruitment of Raf-1 to the plasma membrane. Raf-1, in turn, activates MEK-1, the direct upstream activator of ERK1/2 (7Pelech S.L. Sanghera J.S. Science. 1992; 257: 1355-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). This pathway also appears to be activated in EC by shear stress, since two groups have demonstrated Ras activation by shear (30Li Y.S. Shyy J.Y. Li S. Lee J. Su B. Karin M. Chien S. Mol. Cell.

We have shown that inhibiting PKC-ε with antisense oligonucleotides completely blocked shear stress-mediated ERK1/2 activation, indicating that PKC-ε directly participates in the signaling cascade leading to ERK1/2 activation (e.g. by its kinase activity) or that the constitutive presence of PKC-ε is required for normal function of some component of the signaling cascade (e.g. by regulating gene expression).

Chem. 1997; 272: 6146-6150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Whereas these studies suggest that PKC activates ERK1/2 through Raf-1 in vascular smooth muscle as well, studies to determine whether PKC directly phosphorylates and activates Raf-1 in vascular smooth muscle cells are still required to confirm these observations.PKC-ε-mediated activation of ERK1/2 is likely to be an important pathway for the EC response to shear stress. ERK1/2 has been shown to phosphorylate and activate pp90 rsk , leading to phosphorylation of S6 protein and increased protein synthesis. ERK1/2 is an upstream regulator of Elk-1 and may stimulate ternary complex formation, which increases fos expression, which has been shown to be induced by shear stress. ERK1/2 may also be involved in regulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase based on observations that NO production is regulated by shear stress (43Corson M.A. Berk B.C. Navas J.P. Harrison D.G. Circulation. 1993; 88: I-183Google Scholar) and that endothelial nitric oxide synthase has multiple consensus sites for phosphorylation by ERK1/2 (44Berk B.C. Corson M.A. Peterson T.E. Tseng H. J. Biomech. 1995; 28: 1439-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Kuchan and Frangos (45Kuchan M.J. Frangos J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C628-C636Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that whereas initial release of NO was Ca2+-dependent, sustained NO production in response to shear was Ca2+-independent. Since the shear stress signaling pathway involving PKC-ε described in this paper is Ca2+-independent, it may be involved in sustained NO production stimulated by shear stress. Finally, other PKC-ε substrates such as the cytoskeletal proteins, caldesmon (37Horowitz A. Clement-Chomienne O. Walsh M.P. Morgan K.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C589-C594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), calponin (37Horowitz A. Clement-Chomienne O. Walsh M.P. Morgan K.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C589-C594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and filamentous actin (42Prekeris R. Mayhew M.W. Cooper J.B. Terrian D.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 77-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) may contribute to the rearrangement in EC cytoskeleton in chronically induced by flow.The present study demonstrates the utility of antisense PKC oligonucleotides to explore the cellular role of specific PKC isoforms. Whereas the traditional pharmacological PKC inhibitors employed to investigate the role of PKC are likely to possess differential affinities for the separate PKC isoforms, they are unlikely to be specific for individual PKC isoforms. Indeed, in the present study, staurosporine was an effective inhibitor of PKC-α and PKC-ε but did not affect PKC-ζ activity. The use of antisense oligonucleotides has been shown to be effective in several studies (21Dean N.M. McKay R. Condon T.P. Bennett C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16416-16424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Dean N.M. McKay R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11762-11766Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) and, as demonstrated here, can be used to study isoform specific events. In summary, these data are the first to identify a specific PKC isoform required for transduction of mechanical stimuli. Specifically, we showed that PKC-ε, but not PKC-α or PKC-ζ, serves as a mechano-sensitive mediator for activation of ERK1/2 by shear stress in endothelial cells. Further characterization of this signal transduction pathway will yield greater insight into the mechanisms by which mechanical stimuli regulate biological processes of the vascular wall. The major finding of this study is that PKC-ε is a component of a mechano-sensitive signal transduction pathway that leads to the activation of ERK1/2 in endothelial cells. Further, this pathway is specific for PKC-ε, as PKC-α and PKC-ζ are not required for the activation of ERK1/2. These results, combined with observations from other investigators that shear stress stimulates changes in cellular physiology and gene expression (26Davies P.F. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 519-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (2305) Google Scholar), provide evidence that mechanical stimuli can activate signal transduction pathways in a manner similar to conventional agonist-receptor-initiated signaling events. These results define a pathway for shear stress-mediated ERK1/2 activation and establish a new function for PKC-ε in EC. Two upstream mechanisms for the activation of PKC-ε in response to shear stress may be proposed based on previous studies. First, phospholipase C is activated by shear stress (10Nollert M.U. Eskin S.G. McIntire L.V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 170: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), resulting in the cleavage of phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate and generation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol. PKC-ε is similar to the classical PKC isoforms in that it is activated by diacylglycerol (20Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28495-28498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1466) Google Scholar); thus, one mechanism for activation of PKC-ε is through shear stress-mediated generation of diacylglycerol. Second, other activators of PKC-ε such as phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, may be increased in EC in response to fluid shear stress. Reports show that both of these phosphoinositides generated by PI 3-kinase activity are potent and selective activators of the novel class of PKC isoforms and have little effect on the classical or atypical PKC isoforms (27Liscovitch M. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1994; 77: 329-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). To date, no studies have been published regarding changes in PI 3-kinase activity in response to fluid shear stress. Moriya et al. (28Moriya S. Kazlauskas A. Akimoto K. Hirai S. Mizuno K. Takenawa T. Fukui Y. Watanabe Y. Ozaki S. Ohno S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) reported that both the PI 3-kinase and the phospholipase C pathway can activate PKC-ε in a cell-specific and stimulus-specific manner. The specificity of the PI 3-kinase pathway for the novel PKC isoforms suggests that analysis of PI 3-kinase activity in response to flow will be an interesting area for future studies. The plasma membrane sensor or receptor responsible for transducing mechanical stimuli into biochemical signaling events remains undefined. Several molecules have been proposed as candidate mechanotransducers, including integrins and mechano-sensitive ion channels such as the inward rectifying K+ channel and the stretch-activated Ca2+ channel (26Davies P.F. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 519-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (2305) Google Scholar). Whereas it is unlikely that mechano-sensitive ion channels could result in the selective activation of PKC-ε, integrins have been shown to activate many cellular kinases, including PKC (29Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21459-21462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because antisense PKC-ε oligonucleotides completely inhibited adhesion (i.e. integrin)-induced ERK1/2 activation, the present findings suggest an important role for PKC-ε in integrin-mediated signaling in EC. In two previous studies, we found that integrins played an essential role in activation of ERK1/2 by shear stress in EC (16Takahashi M. Berk B.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2623-2631Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 17Ishida T. Peterson T.E. Kovach N. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 310-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Thus, the present data support the concept that integrins participate as mechanoreceptors, although additional experiments should be performed to determine which integrins activate PKC-ε. Although signal transduction events by which PKC-ε activates ERK1/2 remain to be determined, it seems likely that PKC-ε interacts directly with Raf-1 to activate ERK1/2. Activation of ERK1/2 by growth factors has been shown to occur via activation of Ras and subsequent recruitment of Raf-1 to the plasma membrane. Raf-1, in turn, activates MEK-1, the direct upstream activator of ERK1/2 (7Pelech S.L. Sanghera J.S. Science. 1992; 257: 1355-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). This pathway also appears to be activated in EC by shear stress, since two groups have demonstrated Ras activation by shear (30Li Y.S. Shyy J.Y. Li S. Lee J. Su B. Karin M. Chien S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5947-5954Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 31Jo H. Sipos K. Go Y.-M. Law R. Rong J. McDonald J.M. J. Biol.

Both of these effects were mimicked by GTP. Pretreatment of cells with cholera toxin blocked the activation, whereas pertussis toxin blocked the inhibition. Application of carbamylcholine caused significant decreases in NAD+ concentrations in untreated m1-transformed NG108-15 cells, but an increase in cholera toxin-treated cells.

An alternative hypothesis is that the cADP-ribose formation is regulated by ADP-ribosyl cyclase through the direct action of G proteins activated by receptors within the surface membrane, as already shown for the formation of cyclic AMP, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, and diacylglycerol (26Gilman A.G.

Krueger K. Busis N. Ray R. Kenimer J.G. Adler M.

In particular, in NGPM1-27 cells (31Fukuda K. Higashida H. Kubo T. Maeda A. Akiba I. Bujo H. Mishina M. Numa S. Nature. 1988; 335: 355-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), which overexpress muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs), it has been shown that intracellular NAD+ or NAD+metabolites are involved in signal transduction from m1 mAChRs to K+ channels (32Higashida H.

In this context, such neuronal cell lines have advantages for analyzing receptor-ADP-ribosyl cyclase coupling in detail.For measurement of ADP-ribosyl cyclase, high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) is commonly used to separate cADP-ribose-related compounds (1Rusinko N.

However, since it takes 30–60 min to process one sample, it is essential to develop a much more rapid method that can allow processing of multiple samples at once. There are two papers that describe ADP-ribosyl cyclase assay by TLC (21Galione A. White A. Willmott N. Turner M. Potter B.V.L. Watson S.T. Nature. 1993; 365: 456-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 36Mészáros V. Socci R. Mészáros L.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 210: 452-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), in which NAD+ migrates faster than cADP-ribose. The methods used in those reports seem to be affected by large amounts of radiolabeled substrates. We here developed a TLC method that overcomes this problem and allows separation of cADP-ribose in up to 19 samples within 40–50 min. Our TLC method was first tested on COS-7 cells overexpressing human CD38 and was shown to be applicable for measuring ADP-ribosyl cyclase activity. We demonstrate that crude cell membranes of NG108-15 cells possess ADP-ribosyl cyclase activity and that such activity is activated or inhibited in a mAChR subtype-specific manner in NG108-15 cells overexpressing distinct mAChR subtypes. Furthermore, to ascertain the intracellular role of the catalytic activity of ADP-ribosyl cyclase in neuronal cell membranes, the time course of [NAD+] i after extracellular application of acetylcholine to these cells was investigated.DISCUSSIONThe chromatographic procedure used here resulted in a resolution sufficient to measure 3H accumulation in the cADP-ribose fraction originating from adenine-labeled [3H]NAD+, and it was free from interference by the labeled substrate. One possible limitation could be that the cADP-ribose fraction was contaminated by ∼15% of the newly synthesized [3H]ADP-ribose (Fig. 2 A). However, the risk that we measured the ADP-ribose count in the cADP-ribose fraction seems to be negligible since different patterns of3H accumulation in ADP-ribose and cADP-ribose fractions were obtained (Fig. 4), reflecting that distinct materials are accumulated with different rates of formation and degradation. The autoradiograms for COS-CD38 and NGPM1-27 cells (Fig. 3) clearly demonstrated the overall fate of NAD+ in that the majority of NAD+ was converted to either ADP-ribose or cADP-ribose or both in two or more enzyme reaction steps, probably ADP-ribosyl cyclase and cADP-ribose hydrolase.The NAD+ concentration used in our reaction mixture (2 μm) was much lower than values (∼100 μm) used in other studies (1Rusinko N.

However, our concentration is very similar to the estimated K m value (3–5 μm) for ADP-ribosyl cyclase in NG108-15 cell membranes. 2H. Higashida, S. Yokoyama, M. Higashida, and M. Noda, unpublished data. Under such conditions, [3H]cADP-ribose accumulated linearly for 2–4 min and [3H]ADP-ribose for 16 min, suggesting that it is not an insufficient dose. Thus, our TLC method was used for measurement of ADP-ribosyl cyclase, at least during the first few minutes. We do not know whether or not this TLC method is applicable for measurement of other recently found enzyme reactions in ADP-ribosyl cyclase, such as production of cyclic 2′-phosphoadenosine diphosphoribose (41Vu C.Q.

The finding that the inhibition of ADP-ribosyl cyclase via m2/m4 mAChRs is mediated through a PTx-sensitive G protein resembles the inhibitory signal transduction known for adenylate cyclase in NG108-15 cells (29Nirenberg M.

Nature. 1988; 335: 355-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Coupling of m1/m3 mAChRs to ADP-ribosyl cyclase is relatively resistant to PTx, but highly sensitive to CTx, which seems to be different from the signal pathway to phospholipase Cβ (30Noda M. Ishizaka N. Yokoyama S. Hoshi N. Kimura Y. Hashii M. Taketo M. Egorova A. Knijnik R. Fukuda K. Morikawa H. Brown D.A. Higashida H. J.

Thus, the coupling from mAChRs to ADP-ribosyl cyclase via G proteins would be a new mode of signal transduction, in parallel with the known pathways to adenylate cyclase and phospholipase C in NG108-15 cells.The simplest explanation for our [NAD+] i data in NGPM1-27 cells (Fig. 7) could be that NAD+ consumption is accelerated by the activation with the agonist of a membrane-bound form of ADP-ribosyl cyclase whose catalytic site resides in the cell interior. This speculation, however, would require a different topology from that proposed for the CD38 cell-surface antigen, whose catalytic sites of ADP-ribosyl cyclase (15Tohgo A. Takasawa S. Noguchi N.

Thus, ADP-ribosyl cyclase activity detected in the intracellular side in NG108-15 cells could not be the same as CD38, but a neuronal isoform of ADP-ribosyl cyclase. The degree of identity between ADP-ribosyl cyclase in NG108-15 neuronal cells and that in ovotestis of Aplysia (12Lee H.C. Aarhus R. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) or CD38 should be further examined.cADP-ribose formation was not affected by cGMP in NG108-15 cell membranes. This conclusion, however, does not exclude the regulatory mechanism in the cytoplasm, where cytosolic ADP-ribosyl cyclase could be activated through the nitric oxide/cGMP-dependent cascade (11Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 365: 388-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). In summary, our results suggest that stimulation of conventional neurotransmitter receptors can regulate cellular function through cADP-ribose as a second messenger, independently from or in concert with other second messengers.

If cADP-ribose acts as an intracellular second messenger, ADP-ribosyl cyclase, as an effector enzyme, should be activated or inhibited in response to stimulation by hormones or neurotransmitters, which should simultaneously be associated with a transient decrease in the intracellular NAD+ concentration ([NAD+] i ) and an increase in cADP-ribose concentration (11Berridge M.J.

For measurement of ADP-ribosyl cyclase, high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) is commonly used to separate cADP-ribose-related compounds (1Rusinko N. Lee H.C. J. Biol.

However, since it takes 30–60 min to process one sample, it is essential to develop a much more rapid method that can allow processing of multiple samples at once. There are two papers that describe ADP-ribosyl cyclase assay by TLC (21Galione A. White A. Willmott N. Turner M. Potter B.V.L. Watson S.T. Nature. 1993; 365: 456-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 36Mészáros V. Socci R. Mészáros L.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 210: 452-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), in which NAD+ migrates faster than cADP-ribose. The methods used in those reports seem to be affected by large amounts of radiolabeled substrates. We here developed a TLC method that overcomes this problem and allows separation of cADP-ribose in up to 19 samples within 40–50 min. Our TLC method was first tested on COS-7 cells overexpressing human CD38 and was shown to be applicable for measuring ADP-ribosyl cyclase activity. We demonstrate that crude cell membranes of NG108-15 cells possess ADP-ribosyl cyclase activity and that such activity is activated or inhibited in a mAChR subtype-specific manner in NG108-15 cells overexpressing distinct mAChR subtypes. Furthermore, to ascertain the intracellular role of the catalytic activity of ADP-ribosyl cyclase in neuronal cell membranes, the time course of [NAD+] i after extracellular application of acetylcholine to these cells was investigated. DISCUSSIONThe chromatographic procedure used here resulted in a resolution sufficient to measure 3H accumulation in the cADP-ribose fraction originating from adenine-labeled [3H]NAD+, and it was free from interference by the labeled substrate. One possible limitation could be that the cADP-ribose fraction was contaminated by ∼15% of the newly synthesized [3H]ADP-ribose (Fig. 2 A). However, the risk that we measured the ADP-ribose count in the cADP-ribose fraction seems to be negligible since different patterns of3H accumulation in ADP-ribose and cADP-ribose fractions were obtained (Fig. 4), reflecting that distinct materials are accumulated with different rates of formation and degradation. The autoradiograms for COS-CD38 and NGPM1-27 cells (Fig. 3) clearly demonstrated the overall fate of NAD+ in that the majority of NAD+ was converted to either ADP-ribose or cADP-ribose or both in two or more enzyme reaction steps, probably ADP-ribosyl cyclase and cADP-ribose hydrolase.The NAD+ concentration used in our reaction mixture (2 μm) was much lower than values (∼100 μm) used in other studies (1Rusinko N.

However, our concentration is very similar to the estimated K m value (3–5 μm) for ADP-ribosyl cyclase in NG108-15 cell membranes. 2H. Higashida, S. Yokoyama, M. Higashida, and M. Noda, unpublished data. Under such conditions, [3H]cADP-ribose accumulated linearly for 2–4 min and [3H]ADP-ribose for 16 min, suggesting that it is not an insufficient dose. Thus, our TLC method was used for measurement of ADP-ribosyl cyclase, at least during the first few minutes. We do not know whether or not this TLC method is applicable for measurement of other recently found enzyme reactions in ADP-ribosyl cyclase, such as production of cyclic 2′-phosphoadenosine diphosphoribose (41Vu C.Q.

In summary, our results suggest that stimulation of conventional neurotransmitter receptors can regulate cellular function through cADP-ribose as a second messenger, independently from or in concert with other second messengers.

For analysis of the role of IP 3 -induced Ca 2+ release (IICR) on patterning of the embryonic body, monoclonal antibodies that inhibit IICR were produced. Injection of these blocking antibodies into the ventral part of early Xenopus embryos induced modest dorsal differentiation. A close correlation between IICR blocking potencies and ectopic dorsal axis induction frequency suggests that an active IP 3 -Ca 2+ signal may participate in the modulation of ventral differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2124210515,"Enteropeptidase, also known as enterokinase, initiates the activation of pancreatic hydrolases by cleaving and activating trypsinogen. Enteropeptidase is synthesized as a single-chain protein, whereas purified enteropeptidase contains a ≈47-kDa serine protease domain (light chain) and a disulfide-linked ≈120-kDa heavy chain. The heavy chain contains an amino-terminal membrane-spanning segment and several repeated structural motifs of unknown function. To study the role of heavy chain motifs in substrate recognition, secreted variants of recombinant bovine proenteropeptidase were constructed by replacing the transmembrane domain with a signal peptide. Secreted variants containing both the heavy chain (minus the transmembrane domain) and the catalytic light chain (pro-HL-BEK (where BEK is bovine enteropeptidase)) or only the catalytic domain (pro-L-BEK) were expressed in baby hamster kidney cells and purified. Single-chain pro-HL-BEK and pro-L-BEK were zymogens with extremely low catalytic activity, and both were activated readily by trypsin cleavage. Trypsinogen was activated efficiently by purified enteropeptidase from bovine intestine (K m = 5.6 μm and k cat = 4.0 s−1) and by HL-BEK (K m = 5.6 μm and k cat = 2.2 s−1), but not by L-BEK (K m = 133 μm and k cat = 0.1 s−1); HL-BEK cleaved trypsinogen at pH 5.6 with 520-fold greater catalytic efficiency than did L-BEK. Qualitatively similar results were obtained at pH 8.4. In contrast to this striking difference in trypsinogen recognition, the small synthetic substrate Gly-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys-β-naphthylamide was cleaved with similar kinetic parameters by both HL-BEK (K m = 0.27 mm and k cat = 0.07 s−1) and L-BEK (K m = 0.60 mm and k cat = 0.06 s−1). The presence of the heavy chain also influenced the rate of reaction with protease inhibitors. Bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor preferred HL-BEK (initial K i = 99 nm and final K i * = 1.8 nm) over L-BEK (K i = 698 nm andK i * = 6.2 nm). Soybean trypsin inhibitor exhibited a reciprocal pattern, inhibiting L-BEK (K i * = 1.6 nm), but not HL-BEK. These kinetic data indicate that the enteropeptidase heavy chain has little influence on the recognition of small peptides, but strongly influences macromolecular substrate recognition and inhibitor specificity.

Enteropeptidase, originally named enterokinase when it was discovered by Pavlov (1Pavlov I.P. The Work of the Digestive Glands. Charles Griffin & Co., London1902: 148-163Google Scholar), is a membrane-bound serine protease of the duodenal mucosa that cleaves trypsinogen to generate active trypsin. In almost all vertebrate species, a short trypsinogen activation peptide is released that terminates with the sequence Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys (2Bricteux-Gregoire S. Schyns R. Florkin M. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B Comp. Biochem. 1972; 42: 23-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Following activation, trypsin cleaves and activates other zymogens in pancreatic secretions, including chymotrypsinogen, proelastase, procarboxypeptidases, and some prolipases. Thus, enteropeptidase initiates a simple two-step enzymatic cascade that activates digestive hydrolases within the lumen of the gut. The biological importance of this pathway is demonstrated by the severe intestinal malabsorption and diarrhea that is caused by congenital enteropeptidase deficiency (3Hadorn B. Tarlow M.J. Lloyd J.K. Wolff O.H. Lancet. 1969; i: 812-813Abstract Google Scholar, 4Haworth J.C. Gourley B. Hadorn B. Sumida C. J. Pediatr. 1971; 78: 481-490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).Bovine enteropeptidase is synthesized as a single-chain precursor of 1035 amino acid residues (5Kitamoto Y. Yuan X. Wu Q. McCourt D.W. Sadler J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7588-7592Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) that appears to require proteolytic activation, suggesting that enteropeptidase may not be the “first” protease of the digestive hydrolase cascade. Active enteropeptidase has been cleaved after Arg-800 to produce a disulfide-linked heterodimer with an amino-terminal ≈120-kDa heavy chain and a ≈47-kDa light chain; ∼40% of the apparent mass of these polypeptides is due to glycosylation (6Anderson L.E. Walsh K.A. Neurath H. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 3354-3360Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 7Liepnieks J.J. Light A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 1677-1683Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enteropeptidase heavy chain consists of an amino-terminal membrane-spanning domain, a mucin-like domain, two repeats found in complement serine proteases C1r and C1s, a MAM domain (so named for similar motifs first identified in the metalloprotease meprin, the Xenopus laevis neuronal protein A5, and protein-tyrosine phosphatase Mu), and a macrophage scavenger receptor cysteine-rich repeat (reviewed in Ref. 8Lu D. Sadler J.E. Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D. Woessner Jr., J.F. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. Academic Press Ltd., London1997Google Scholar). The light chain is a typical chymotrypsin-like serine protease. The activation cleavage site between the heavy and light chains has the sequence Val-Ser-Pro-Lys↓Ile, which might be recognized by trypsin or other trypsin-like proteases. The identity of the endogenous proenteropeptidase activator is unknown. If trypsin were responsible in vivo, this would raise the logical question of how such a closed trypsin-enteropeptidase cycle could be initiated (reviewed in Ref. 8Lu D. Sadler J.E. Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D. Woessner Jr., J.F. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. Academic Press Ltd., London1997Google Scholar).The determinants of enteropeptidase substrate specificity are not understood fully and may not be confined to the catalytic serine protease domain. The enteropeptidase light chain has been isolated in active form by partial reduction and alkylation of purified bovine intestinal enteropeptidase (9Light A. Fonseca P. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13195-13198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with an average of ≈3 alkylated cysteine residues/molecule. A similar protein has been made by expression of recombinant enteropeptidase light chain (10LaVallie E.R. Rehemtulla A. Racie L.A. DiBlasio E.A. Ferenz C. Grant K.L. Light A. McCoy J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23311-23317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is predicted to have at least 1 unpaired cysteine. These light chain preparations had markedly reduced ability to activate trypsinogen, but normal activity toward Gly-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys-β-naphthylamide. Similar selective defects in activity toward trypsinogen have been achieved by heating (6Anderson L.E. Walsh K.A. Neurath H. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 3354-3360Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 11Barns R.J. Elmslie R.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 350: 495-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) or acetylation (12Baratti J. Maroux S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 452: 488-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) of two-chain enteropeptidase. Although the structural cause of the impaired trypsinogen activation is uncertain, these observations suggest that the catalytic center and at least one secondary binding site on enteropeptidase cooperate to recognize trypsinogen.To determine the influence of the enteropeptidase heavy chain on substrate recognition, secreted variants of recombinant proenteropeptidase were prepared, with or without the heavy chain. Proenteropeptidase was shown to be a zymogen with extremely low intrinsic protease activity, and it was activated efficiently by trypsin. The presence of the heavy chain slightly inhibited proenteropeptidase activation and had almost no effect on the recognition of the small peptide substrate Gly-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys-β-naphthylamide. However, the heavy chain had profound effects on the recognition of macromolecular substrates (trypsinogen) and inhibitors (pancreatic trypsin inhibitor and soybean trypsin inhibitor).DISCUSSIONThe activation of trypsinogen is a key step in the activation of other digestive hydrolases within the lumen of the gut, and efficient catalysis of this reaction depends on enteropeptidase. Almost all vertebrate trypsinogens are activated by proteolytic cleavage of a Lys–Ile bond in an amino-terminal peptide that contains the sequence Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys-Ile (2Bricteux-Gregoire S. Schyns R. Florkin M. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B Comp. Biochem. 1972; 42: 23-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Molecular modeling of enteropeptidase suggests that specific basic residues on the surface of the catalytic subunit (light chain) interact directly with the acidic residues of trypsinogen activation peptides (25Matsushima M. Ichinose M. Yahagi N. Kakei N. Tsukada S. Miki K. Kurokawa K. Tashiro K. Shiokawa K. Shinomiya K. Umeyama H. Inoue H. Takahashi T. Takahashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19976-19982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Such interactions may account for the recognition of small peptide substrates, but probably are not sufficient to explain the recognition of trypsinogen. The isolated light chain has been prepared by partial reduction of purified bovine enteropeptidase (9Light A. Fonseca P. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13195-13198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or by expression of recombinant light chain (10LaVallie E.R. Rehemtulla A. Racie L.A. DiBlasio E.A. Ferenz C. Grant K.L. Light A. McCoy J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23311-23317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both preparations had normal activity toward small synthetic peptides, but had dramatically reduced activity toward trypsinogen. Therefore, the recognition of small substrates requires only the light chain, whereas efficient cleavage of trypsinogen may also depend on the heavy chain. Similar selective defects in trypsinogen recognition were produced in two-chain enteropeptidase by heating (6Anderson L.E. Walsh K.A. Neurath H. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 3354-3360Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 11Barns R.J. Elmslie R.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 350: 495-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) or by acetylation (12Baratti J. Maroux S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 452: 488-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This behavior suggests that the catalytic center and at least one secondary substrate-binding site (exosite) cooperate to recognize trypsinogen, and exosites sensitive to these treatments could be located on the heavy chain or the light chain.To investigate the determinants of enteropeptidase substrate specificity, variants were constructed that contain or lack most of the heavy chain. Proteolytic removal of the transmembrane segment appears to have little effect on trypsinogen activation by bovine (9Light A. Fonseca P. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13195-13198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or porcine (25Matsushima M. Ichinose M. Yahagi N. Kakei N. Tsukada S. Miki K. Kurokawa K. Tashiro K. Shiokawa K. Shinomiya K. Umeyama H. Inoue H. Takahashi T. Takahashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19976-19982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) enteropeptidase; therefore, the putative membrane-spanning domain was replaced with a signal peptide to enable purification of secreted recombinant proteins from conditioned medium (Fig. 1).Special attention was paid to the structure of the construct that encodes pro-L-BEK. Several chymotrypsin-like serine proteases have an “extra” disulfide bond that covalently links the activation peptide to the protease domain, and alignment of enteropeptidase with a subfamily of serine proteases suggests that the last cysteine of the heavy chain (Cys-788) is linked to the light chain (Cys-912, or Cys-122 in chymotrypsin numbering) (5Kitamoto Y. Yuan X. Wu Q. McCourt D.W. Sadler J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7588-7592Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). To preserve this predicted disulfide bond and to avoid the generation of an unpaired or abnormally paired cysteine, the construct retained the carboxyl-terminal 17 amino acids of the heavy chain that correspond to the chymotrypsin activation peptide. Covalent association of the short activation peptide and the catalytic domain was confirmed by demonstrating that under nonreducing conditions, pro-L-BEK and trypsin-activated L-BEK have similar electrophoretic mobility, whereas after reduction, the apparent mass of L-BEK (45 kDa) is substantially smaller than that of pro-L-BEK (60 kDa) (Fig. 2).Both pro-HL-BEK and pro-L-BEK were purified as single-chain proteins and were found to have little (if any) catalytic activity. In particular, pro-HL-BEK had no more than 0.002-fold the activity of two-chain HL-BEK toward GD4K-NA (Fig. 3). The predicted activation cleavage site of proenteropeptidase occurs in the sequence VSPK800IVGG, which has the appearance of a good site for cleavage by trypsin (5Kitamoto Y. Yuan X. Wu Q. McCourt D.W. Sadler J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7588-7592Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In fact, trypsin readily activated both pro-HL-BEK and pro-L-BEK (Fig. 4) by cleaving them after Lys-800. Pro-HL-BEK was activated ≈3-fold more slowly than L-BEK, indicating that the heavy chain has a modest inhibitory effect on the recognition of proenteropeptidase by trypsin.The concentrations of proenteropeptidase tested (0 to ≈1 μm) were not sufficient to allow accurate determination of the K m for cleavage by trypsin, which must be >1 μm (data not shown). However, trypsin cleaved pro-HL-BEK at a rate of 1.0 s−1 and pro-L-BEK at a rate of 2.0 s−1 (each at 50 nm), and these turnover numbers are similar to those of other good trypsin substrates. Thus, proenteropeptidase is made as a single-chain zymogen, and it is activated efficiently by trypsin; enteropeptidase, in turn, activates trypsinogen, begging the question of how such a closed cycle could be initiated in vivo. Additional study is required to determine whether trypsinogen or proenteropeptidase is sufficiently “leaky” for this purpose, or whether another responsible protease may be present in duodenal mucosa or pancreatic secretions.Although deletion of the heavy chain had only a modest effect on proenteropeptidase activation, it had a dramatic and selective effect on enteropeptidase substrate specificity. BEK, HL-BEK, and L-BEK had similar kinetic parameters for cleavage of GD4K-NA, indicating that the heavy chain does not strongly influence the recognition of small substrates (Table I). With the physiological substrate trypsinogen, BEK and HL-BEK also had similar values forK m (5.6 μm), and the values fork cat differed <2-fold (Table I), indicating that the transmembrane and alternative exon domains have little effect on trypsinogen activation. This is consistent with the observation that proteolytic release of enteropeptidase from membranes did not impair trypsinogen cleavage (26Fonseca P. Light A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3069-3074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to these small effects, deletion of the entire heavy chain markedly inhibited the cleavage of trypsinogen (Table I). Compared with HL-BEK, the catalytic efficiency (k cat/K m ) of L-BEK was decreased ≈520-fold at pH 5.6 and ≈47-fold at pH 8.4. Therefore, heavy chain motifs between the first low density lipoprotein receptor-like domain and the macrophage scavenger receptor-like domain (Fig. 1) strongly influence the recognition of trypsinogen. The defect in trypsinogen activation is not explained by changes in the S2–S5 subsites of L-BEK since GD4K-NA cleavage is preserved. These results suggest the enteropeptidase heavy chain contains an exosite that interacts directly with trypsinogen.In addition to promoting trypsinogen activation, the heavy chain also affects the reactions of enteropeptidase with macromolecular protease inhibitors. BEK purified from intestine was reported to be inhibited by BPTI with a dissociation constant of ≈5 nm (7Liepnieks J.J. Light A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 1677-1683Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and recombinant HL-BEK also was found to be inhibited by BPTI with a finalK i * of 1.8 nm (Table II). In addition, the kinetics were typical of slow binding inhibition (Fig. 5). Detailed analysis (Fig. 6) was consistent with a mechanism in which a low affinity complex was formed rapidly with a K i of 99 nm, and this complex slowly isomerized to the final high affinity complex with a forward rate constant (k 3) of 0.88 min−1. Deletion of the heavy chain had little effect on k 3, modestly increased the final K i * to 6.2 nm, and increased the initial K i ≈7-fold to ≈700 nm (Table II). An opposite pattern was observed for STI. BEK is completely resistant to STI (7Liepnieks J.J. Light A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 1677-1683Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and HL-BEK also was not inhibited by STI. However, deletion of the heavy chain rendered L-BEK susceptible to slow inhibition by STI with a K i * of 1.6 nm (Table II). In addition, the kinetics of the L-BEK reaction with STI did not indicate the existence of an initial low affinity complex.Isolated enteropeptidase light chain prepared by partial reduction and alkylation (9Light A. Fonseca P. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13195-13198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and a recombinant form with an unpaired cysteine residue (10LaVallie E.R. Rehemtulla A. Racie L.A. DiBlasio E.A. Ferenz C. Grant K.L. Light A. McCoy J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23311-23317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) also are inhibited by STI. Thus, deletion of the heavy chain impairs the inhibition of enteropeptidase by BPTI, but enables inhibition by STI. Unlike typical enteropeptidase substrates, BPTI and STI do not have acidic amino acids adjacent to the site that interacts with the catalytic center, and for this reason, the enteropeptidase heavy chain may be a particularly important determinant of reaction rates with these and other inhibitors.The kinetic effects of deleting the enteropeptidase heavy chain clearly implicate it in the recognition of macromolecular substrates and inhibitors. The activation of trypsinogen is enhanced by the heavy chain, and its influence is especially significant under acid conditions (pH 4–6) that commonly occur in the duodenum. The resistance of enteropeptidase to most protease inhibitors also appears to depend, in part, on the heavy chain. The unusual properties of the enteropeptidase-trypsinogen interaction appear analogous to those of certain blood coagulation factors for which the noncatalytic domains of serine proteases contribute to macromolecular recognition. These systems provide detailed insight into how serine proteases and their substrates are modified during evolution to perform specific, regulated functions by exploiting structural features of both catalytic and noncatalytic domains. Enteropeptidase, originally named enterokinase when it was discovered by Pavlov (1Pavlov I.P. The Work of the Digestive Glands. Charles Griffin & Co., London1902: 148-163Google Scholar), is a membrane-bound serine protease of the duodenal mucosa that cleaves trypsinogen to generate active trypsin. In almost all vertebrate species, a short trypsinogen activation peptide is released that terminates with the sequence Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys (2Bricteux-Gregoire S. Schyns R. Florkin M. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B Comp. Biochem. 1972; 42: 23-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Following activation, trypsin cleaves and activates other zymogens in pancreatic secretions, including chymotrypsinogen, proelastase, procarboxypeptidases, and some prolipases. Thus, enteropeptidase initiates a simple two-step enzymatic cascade that activates digestive hydrolases within the lumen of the gut.

Chem. 1979; 254: 1677-1683Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and recombinant HL-BEK also was found to be inhibited by BPTI with a finalK i * of 1.8 nm (Table II). In addition, the kinetics were typical of slow binding inhibition (Fig. 5). Detailed analysis (Fig. 6) was consistent with a mechanism in which a low affinity complex was formed rapidly with a K i of 99 nm, and this complex slowly isomerized to the final high affinity complex with a forward rate constant (k 3) of 0.88 min−1. Deletion of the heavy chain had little effect on k 3, modestly increased the final K i * to 6.2 nm, and increased the initial K i ≈7-fold to ≈700 nm (Table II). An opposite pattern was observed for STI. BEK is completely resistant to STI (7Liepnieks J.J. Light A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 1677-1683Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and HL-BEK also was not inhibited by STI. However, deletion of the heavy chain rendered L-BEK susceptible to slow inhibition by STI with a K i * of 1.6 nm (Table II). In addition, the kinetics of the L-BEK reaction with STI did not indicate the existence of an initial low affinity complex.Isolated enteropeptidase light chain prepared by partial reduction and alkylation (9Light A. Fonseca P. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13195-13198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and a recombinant form with an unpaired cysteine residue (10LaVallie E.R. Rehemtulla A. Racie L.A. DiBlasio E.A. Ferenz C. Grant K.L. Light A. McCoy J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23311-23317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) also are inhibited by STI. Thus, deletion of the heavy chain impairs the inhibition of enteropeptidase by BPTI, but enables inhibition by STI. Unlike typical enteropeptidase substrates, BPTI and STI do not have acidic amino acids adjacent to the site that interacts with the catalytic center, and for this reason, the enteropeptidase heavy chain may be a particularly important determinant of reaction rates with these and other inhibitors.The kinetic effects of deleting the enteropeptidase heavy chain clearly implicate it in the recognition of macromolecular substrates and inhibitors. The activation of trypsinogen is enhanced by the heavy chain, and its influence is especially significant under acid conditions (pH 4–6) that commonly occur in the duodenum. The resistance of enteropeptidase to most protease inhibitors also appears to depend, in part, on the heavy chain. The unusual properties of the enteropeptidase-trypsinogen interaction appear analogous to those of certain blood coagulation factors for which the noncatalytic domains of serine proteases contribute to macromolecular recognition. These systems provide detailed insight into how serine proteases and their substrates are modified during evolution to perform specific, regulated functions by exploiting structural features of both catalytic and noncatalytic domains. The activation of trypsinogen is a key step in the activation of other digestive hydrolases within the lumen of the gut, and efficient catalysis of this reaction depends on enteropeptidase. Almost all vertebrate trypsinogens are activated by proteolytic cleavage of a Lys–Ile bond in an amino-terminal peptide that contains the sequence Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys-Ile (2Bricteux-Gregoire S. Schyns R. Florkin M. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B Comp. Biochem. 1972; 42: 23-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Molecular modeling of enteropeptidase suggests that specific basic residues on the surface of the catalytic subunit (light chain) interact directly with the acidic residues of trypsinogen activation peptides (25Matsushima M. Ichinose M. Yahagi N. Kakei N. Tsukada S. Miki K. Kurokawa K. Tashiro K. Shiokawa K. Shinomiya K. Umeyama H. Inoue H. Takahashi T. Takahashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19976-19982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Such interactions may account for the recognition of small peptide substrates, but probably are not sufficient to explain the recognition of trypsinogen. The isolated light chain has been prepared by partial reduction of purified bovine enteropeptidase (9Light A. Fonseca P. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13195-13198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or by expression of recombinant light chain (10LaVallie E.R. Rehemtulla A. Racie L.A. DiBlasio E.A. Ferenz C. Grant K.L. Light A. McCoy J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23311-23317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both preparations had normal activity toward small synthetic peptides, but had dramatically reduced activity toward trypsinogen. Therefore, the recognition of small substrates requires only the light chain, whereas efficient cleavage of trypsinogen may also depend on the heavy chain. Similar selective defects in trypsinogen recognition were produced in two-chain enteropeptidase by heating (6Anderson L.E. Walsh K.A. Neurath H. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 3354-3360Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 11Barns R.J. Elmslie R.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 350: 495-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) or by acetylation (12Baratti J. Maroux S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 452: 488-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This behavior suggests that the catalytic center and at least one secondary substrate-binding site (exosite) cooperate to recognize trypsinogen, and exosites sensitive to these treatments could be located on the heavy chain or the light chain. To investigate the determinants of enteropeptidase substrate specificity, variants were constructed that contain or lack most of the heavy chain. Proteolytic removal of the transmembrane segment appears to have little effect on trypsinogen activation by bovine (9Light A. Fonseca P. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13195-13198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or porcine (25Matsushima M. Ichinose M. Yahagi N. Kakei N. Tsukada S. Miki K. Kurokawa K. Tashiro K. Shiokawa K. Shinomiya K. Umeyama H. Inoue H. Takahashi T. Takahashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19976-19982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) enteropeptidase; therefore, the putative membrane-spanning domain was replaced with a signal peptide to enable purification of secreted recombinant proteins from conditioned medium (Fig. 1). Special attention was paid to the structure of the construct that encodes pro-L-BEK. Several chymotrypsin-like serine proteases have an “extra” disulfide bond that covalently links the activation peptide to the protease domain, and alignment of enteropeptidase with a subfamily of serine proteases suggests that the last cysteine of the heavy chain (Cys-788) is linked to the light chain (Cys-912, or Cys-122 in chymotrypsin numbering) (5Kitamoto Y. Yuan X. Wu Q. McCourt D.W. Sadler J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7588-7592Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). To preserve this predicted disulfide bond and to avoid the generation of an unpaired or abnormally paired cysteine, the construct retained the carboxyl-terminal 17 amino acids of the heavy chain that correspond to the chymotrypsin activation peptide. Covalent association of the short activation peptide and the catalytic domain was confirmed by demonstrating that under nonreducing conditions, pro-L-BEK and trypsin-activated L-BEK have similar electrophoretic mobility, whereas after reduction, the apparent mass of L-BEK (45 kDa) is substantially smaller than that of pro-L-BEK (60 kDa) (Fig. 2). Both pro-HL-BEK and pro-L-BEK were purified as single-chain proteins and were found to have little (if any) catalytic activity. In particular, pro-HL-BEK had no more than 0.002-fold the activity of two-chain HL-BEK toward GD4K-NA (Fig. 3). The predicted activation cleavage site of proenteropeptidase occurs in the sequence VSPK800IVGG, which has the appearance of a good site for cleavage by trypsin (5Kitamoto Y. Yuan X. Wu Q. McCourt D.W. Sadler J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7588-7592Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In fact, trypsin readily activated both pro-HL-BEK and pro-L-BEK (Fig. 4) by cleaving them after Lys-800. Pro-HL-BEK was activated ≈3-fold more slowly than L-BEK, indicating that the heavy chain has a modest inhibitory effect on the recognition of proenteropeptidase by trypsin. The concentrations of proenteropeptidase tested (0 to ≈1 μm) were not sufficient to allow accurate determination of the K m for cleavage by trypsin, which must be >1 μm (data not shown). However, trypsin cleaved pro-HL-BEK at a rate of 1.0 s−1 and pro-L-BEK at a rate of 2.0 s−1 (each at 50 nm), and these turnover numbers are similar to those of other good trypsin substrates. Thus, proenteropeptidase is made as a single-chain zymogen, and it is activated efficiently by trypsin; enteropeptidase, in turn, activates trypsinogen, begging the question of how such a closed cycle could be initiated in vivo. Additional study is required to determine whether trypsinogen or proenteropeptidase is sufficiently “leaky” for this purpose, or whether another responsible protease may be present in duodenal mucosa or pancreatic secretions. Although deletion of the heavy chain had only a modest effect on proenteropeptidase activation, it had a dramatic and selective effect on enteropeptidase substrate specificity. BEK, HL-BEK, and L-BEK had similar kinetic parameters for cleavage of GD4K-NA, indicating that the heavy chain does not strongly influence the recognition of small substrates (Table I). With the physiological substrate trypsinogen, BEK and HL-BEK also had similar values forK m (5.6 μm), and the values fork cat differed <2-fold (Table I), indicating that the transmembrane and alternative exon domains have little effect on trypsinogen activation. This is consistent with the observation that proteolytic release of enteropeptidase from membranes did not impair trypsinogen cleavage (26Fonseca P. Light A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3069-3074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to these small effects, deletion of the entire heavy chain markedly inhibited the cleavage of trypsinogen (Table I). Compared with HL-BEK, the catalytic efficiency (k cat/K m ) of L-BEK was decreased ≈520-fold at pH 5.6 and ≈47-fold at pH 8.4. Therefore, heavy chain motifs between the first low density lipoprotein receptor-like domain and the macrophage scavenger receptor-like domain (Fig. 1) strongly influence the recognition of trypsinogen. The defect in trypsinogen activation is not explained by changes in the S2–S5 subsites of L-BEK since GD4K-NA cleavage is preserved. These results suggest the enteropeptidase heavy chain contains an exosite that interacts directly with trypsinogen. In addition to promoting trypsinogen activation, the heavy chain also affects the reactions of enteropeptidase with macromolecular protease inhibitors. BEK purified from intestine was reported to be inhibited by BPTI with a dissociation constant of ≈5 nm (7Liepnieks J.J. Light A. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2052163339,"The immediate-early gene NGFI-B (also callednur77) encodes an orphan nuclear receptor that activates transcription through a unique response element (NBRE). NGFI-B is rapidly induced and modified via phosphorylation by a variety of stimuli that induce cells to differentiate or to proliferate. We have shown that the in vitro phosphorylation of Ser350 located within the “A-box,” a motif necessary for DNA binding by NGFI-B, results in a decrease in the binding of NGFI-B to its response element (Hirata, Y., Kiuchi, K., Chen, H.-C., Milbrandt, J., and Guroff, G. (1993) J. Biol. Chem.268, 24808–24812). We show here that nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced changes in the in vivo phosphorylation of Ser350 accompany transcriptional deactivation of NGFI-B in PC12 cells, that membrane depolarization and NGF treatment cause differential phosphorylation of NGFI-B, and that the transcriptional activation caused by exogenous expression of NGFI-B or membrane depolarization can be inhibited by NGF treatment. In addition, the mutation of Ser350 to Ala abolished the inhibitory effect of NGF on the transcriptional activation of NGFI-B in PC12 cells. These data could provide new insights into the regulation of transcriptional activity required for some neurons to switch from activity-dependent survival to neurotrophin-dependent survival during development.

These data could provide new insights into the regulation of transcriptional activity required for some neurons to switch from activity-dependent survival to neurotrophin-dependent survival during development. Neurons are constantly exposed to extracellular stimuli that can cause death, support survival, induce or maintain differentiation, and alter cell morphology and synaptic connectivity. Clearly, these stimuli change as the neuron develops and change profoundly when the neuron connects with a target cell through synapse formation and is exposed to target cell-derived growth factors. In response to growth factors and other stimulatory signals, specific neuronal genes are expressed or repressed, and this, in turn, stimulates or inhibits the production of proteins that determine the structure and function of the cell. Activation of a set of genes termed the immediate-early genes is pivotal to this response. NGFI-B, also called nur77, is one of the immediate-early genes originally identified by virtue of its rapid activation by nerve growth factor (NGF) 1The abbreviations used are: NGF, nerve growth factor; NBRE, NGFI-B response element; rDBD, recombinant DNA-binding domain; EGF, epidermal growth factor; DTT, dithiothreitol; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; CREB, cAMP response element-binding protein. in PC12 pheochromocytoma cells (1Milbrandt J. Neuron. 1988; 1: 183-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar) and by serum in fibroblasts (2Hazel T.G. Nathans D. Lau L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8444-8448Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). The PC12 cell line is a good model for the study of NGF action and responds to NGF by differentiating into a postmitotic cell type with neuronal characteristics (3Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Adv. Cell. Neurobiol. 1982; 3: 373-414Crossref Google Scholar). PC12 cells also provide a good system for studying the effects of electrical signals on neuronal gene expression because they have excitable membranes that can be depolarized by specific neurotransmitters or by elevated levels of KCl (3Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Adv. Cell. Neurobiol. 1982; 3: 373-414Crossref Google Scholar). The NGFI-B gene encodes a member of the steroid-thyroid hormone receptor superfamily, a class of ligand-dependent transcriptional modulator proteins (4Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schutz G. Umesono K. Blumberg B. Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 835-839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6085) Google Scholar). NGFI-B is rapidly synthesized in PC12 cells in response to a variety of growth factors, to phorbol ester, and to treatments resulting in calcium influx (5Fahrner T.J. Carroll S.L. Milbrandt J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6454-6459Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The protein is rapidly modified via phosphorylation, and the extent of phosphorylation is dependent on the stimulus (5Fahrner T.J. Carroll S.L. Milbrandt J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6454-6459Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 6Hazel T.G. Misra R. Davis I.J. Greenberg M.E. Lau L.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3239-3246Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Using a genetic selection procedure, NGFI-B was found to recognize a specific nucleotide sequence (NBRE) (7Wilson T.E. Fahrner T.J. Johnston M. Milbrandt J. Science. 1991; 252: 1296-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar), and a region outside the zinc finger domain (A-box) was shown to play a role in DNA binding specificity (8Wilson T.E. Paulsen R.E. Padgett K.A. Milbrandt J. Science. 1992; 256: 107-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Although no specific ligand for NGFI-B has been identified, cotransfection experiments using a reporter gene coupled to the NBRE demonstrate that NGFI-B is a strong transcriptional activator in the cells examined (9Davis I.J. Hazel T.G. Chen R.H. Blenis J. Lau L.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 953-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 10Davis I.J. Hazel T.G. Lau L.F. Mol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 16491-16496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the exact function(s) of NGFI-B in neuronal cells remains to be elucidated. We have demonstrated previously that a recombinant DNA-binding domain of NGFI-B (amino acids 244–352) expressed in bacteria binds specifically to the NBRE and that the in vitrophosphorylation of Ser350 in the A-box of NGFI-B reduces its ability to bind to the DNA (12Hirata Y. Kiuchi K. Chen H.-C. Milbrandt J. Guroff G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24808-24812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have identified a kinase (NGFI-B kinase I) that is induced by NGF and that phosphorylates Ser350 (13Hirata Y. Whalin M. Ginty D.D. Xing J. Greenberg M.E. Milbrandt J. Guroff G. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 1780-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). To test the hypothesis that phosphorylation of NGFI-B at Ser350 in PC12 cells by NGF treatment results in the failure of DNA binding, we used recombinant DNA-binding domain (rDBD) expressed in PC12 cells as a probe and examined whether its phosphorylation state regulates the activity of NGFI-B. We show here that NGF-induced changes in the phosphorylation of Ser350accompany transcriptional deactivation of NGFI-B, that membrane depolarization and NGF treatment cause differential phosphorylation of NGFI-B, that the transcriptional activation caused by either exogenous expression of NGFI-B or membrane depolarization can be inhibited by NGF treatment, and that this effect of NGF is abolished if Ser350 is not available for phosphorylation. NGF was prepared by the method of Bocchini and Angeletti (14Bocchini V. Angeletti P.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1969; 64: 787-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). EGF was obtained from Collaborative Biomedical Research. A monoclonal antibody against NGFI-B (2E1) (5Fahrner T.J. Carroll S.L. Milbrandt J. Mol. Cell.

Science. 1991; 252: 1296-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar), which contains eight copies of the NBRE upstream of a minimal prolactin promoter driving the firefly luciferase gene, were prepared as described. Anti-c-Myc epitope-tagged antibody (9E10) was purchased from Cambridge Research Biochemicals (Cheshire, United Kingdom). Anti-Nur77 antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. A polyclonal antibody specific for phosphorylated Ser350 of NGFI-B was raised in rabbits against the peptide GRRGRLPS(P)KPKC (amino acids 343–353) coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Sigma) through a C-terminal cysteine. The antibody against the unphosphorylated peptide (anti-350 antibody) was adsorbed with the unphosphorylated peptide coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B. The antibody specific for the phosphorylated peptide (anti-350P antibody) was further purified with the phosphopeptide resin. Protein phosphatase types 1 and 2A were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., and okadaic acid was obtained from Alexis Corp. pMKITneo, a mammalian expression vector containing the SRα promoter, was a gift from Dr. K. Maruyama (Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan). The cDNA of NGFI-B was cloned into the EcoRI and MluI sites of pMKITneo (pMKIT-NGFI-B). A mutation of Ser350 to Ala was introduced into pMKIT-NGFI-B with a Quickchange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The DNA-binding domain of NGFI-B (amino acids 247–362) attached to the SV40 large T-antigen nuclear localization signal (PKKKRKV) at the N terminus and to the c-Myc epitope tag (EQKLISEEDLN) at the C terminus was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the upstream primer 5′-TTGAATTCAT GCCCAAGAAG AAGCGCAAGG TGGGCGGCGG CGCACCCGTA ACCTCCACCA AG-3′ and the downstream primer 5′-ATAAGCTTAC AGGTCCTCCT CAGAGATCAG CTTCTGCTCA TTGGTAGGGG AGGCATCTGG GGG-3′. Three glycine residues were introduced downstream of the nuclear localization signal as a spacer to ensure exposure of the nuclear localization signal in the folded molecule. The polymerase chain reaction product was digested with EcoRI andHindIII and then subcloned into pBluescript KS II(+) (pBSKS-ZINC). The sequence of the insert was verified by DNA sequencing. pBSKS-ZINC was digested with EcoRI andXhoI and then subcloned into pMKITneo (pMKIT-ZINC) for transient expression and into pLXSN (15Miller A.D. Rosman G.J. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 980-990PubMed Google Scholar) (pLXSN-ZINC), a retroviral expression vector, for stable expression. The DNA-binding domains of NGFI-B, corresponding to amino acids 244–352, with a mutation (Ser to Ala) at position 340 (NGFI-B327(S340A)) or at position 350 (NGFI-B327(S350A)) were expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and phosphorylated in vitro with protein kinase A (Promega) as described previously (12Hirata Y.

PC12 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 7% fetal bovine serum, 7% horse serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin. A human embryonal kidney cell line 293 and retroviral packaging cell lines (ΨCRE and PA317) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin. Cell lines expressing the zinc finger domain of NGFI-B were generated by amphotropic retroviral infection of PC12 cells in the presence of 8 μg/ml Polybrene (Aldrich). Amphotropic retrovirus was produced by transient transfection of pLXSN-ZINC into the ΨCRE ecotropic packaging cell line, followed by infection into the PA317 amphotropic packaging cell line. Infected PC12 cells were selected in 600 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). PC12 cells were treated with NGF (50 ng/ml), EGF (100 ng/ml), or different concentrations of KCl for various periods of time. The cells were then harvested and washed twice with saline. The washed cells (1 × 107) were treated with 10% trichloroacetic acid for 30 min at 4 °C. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation, and the pellet was solubilized in 80 μl of 9 m urea, 2% Nonidet P-40, and 1% DTT and sonicated. Twenty μl of 10% lauryl sulfate was added, and the pH was adjusted to neutral with 1 m Tris. Samples were resolved on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and then transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Millipore Corp.). The blots were incubated with 5% nonfat dry milk in phosphate-buffer saline, pH 7.4, containing 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h and then incubated with 2E1 (1:200 dilution of culture supernatant), 9E10 (10 μg/ml), anti-350 antibody (2 μg/ml), or anti-350P antibody (2 μg/ml) for 1 h. Bound antibodies were detected by sheep anti-mouse Ig or donkey anti-rabbit Ig antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Corp.) and analyzed with the ECL detection system (Amersham Corp.). For analyses of NGFI-B expressed exogenously, PC12 cells were transfected with pMKIT-NGFI-B. Forty-eight h after transfection, the cells were lysed with lysis buffer (10 mm phosphate buffer, 0.15 m NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.2% SDS, 2 mmEDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.3 mg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm Na3VO4, pH 7.4). Immunoprecipitation was performed with polyclonal anti-Nur77 antibody as described previously (16Katagiri Y. Hiroyama T. Akamatsu N. Suzuki H. Yamazaki H. Tanoue K. J. Biol.

The plasmid used to express NGFI-Bin vitro was created by deletion of the 5′-noncoding region (XbaI-NcoI fragment) from pBSKS-NGFI-B, followed by treatment with Klenow enzyme and T4 DNA ligase (pBSKS-NGFI-BΔ). pBSKS-NGFI-BΔ and pBSKS-ZINC were linearized by MluI andHindIII digestion, respectively, for transcription in vitro. Transcription reactions contained 5 μg of linearized DNA, 40 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 6 mm MgCl2, 10 mm DTT, 2 mm spermidine, 0.5 mm7mGpppG, 1000 units/ml RNasin, 800 units/ml T7 RNA polymerase, and 0.5 mm each ATP, CTP, GTP, and UTP. Incubation was carried out at 37 °C for 1 h, followed by DNase digestion, phenol/CHCl3 extraction, and ethanol precipitation. Generation of proteins was accomplished with a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. In a typical reaction, 100 ng of mRNA was used in a final volume of 50 μl. Five μl of the translation mixture was used in each gel retardation assay. Nuclear protein extracts of PC12 cells and transfectants were prepared according to Staal et al. (17Staal F.J. Roederer M. Herzenberg L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9943-9947Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 × 106 cells, appropriately stimulated, were resuspended in 0.4 ml of buffer A (10 mmHepes, 10 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.3 mg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm Na3VO4, pH 7.8) and incubated on ice for 15 min. Then 25 μl of a 10% Nonidet P-40 solution was added, and the cells were vigorously mixed for 15 s and centrifuged. Pelleted nuclei were resuspended in 50 μl of buffer B (50 mm Hepes, 50 mm KCl, 300 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.3 mg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm Na3VO4, pH 7.8). Following gentle mixing at 4 °C for 20 min, the tubes were centrifuged, and the supernatants containing the nuclear proteins were collected. Gel retardation assays were performed using the NBRE-containing B1a oligonucleotide as described (12Hirata Y. Kiuchi K. Chen H.-C. Milbrandt J. Guroff G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24808-24812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Hirata Y. Whalin M. Ginty D.D. Xing J. Greenberg M.E. Milbrandt J. Guroff G. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 1780-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), with 4 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) as nonspecific competitor and 3–10 μg of crude nuclear extract. The effects of antibodies on the gel mobility shift interactions were examined by addition of 2E1 (2 μl of culture supernatant) or 9E10 (0.2 μg) to the reaction mixture. For phosphatase treatment, Na3VO4 was eliminated from buffers A and B in the preparation of nuclear proteins. Nuclear proteins were treated with both protein phosphatase types 1 and 2A (0.2 units/reaction) in buffer (50 mm Hepes, 50 mmKCl, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mmMgCl2, and 10% glycerol, pH 7.8) at 30 °C for 30 min. Okadaic acid (500 nm) was used to inactivate the phosphatases. The DNA binding activity was examined as described above. PC12 cells cultured in six-well plates (Nunc) were transfected using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 1 μg of NBRE-luc and 0.05 μg of the internal control pRL-TK (Promega), which contains Renilla luciferase downstream of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter. Eighteen h after transfection, the cells were treated with NGF (50 ng/ml) or with KCl for various periods. Cell lysates were prepared with the Dual-Luciferase Reporter assay system (Promega), and firefly andRenilla luciferase activities were measured in Lumat LB9507 (Berthold, Wildbad, Germany). Transfection efficiency was normalized with the Renilla luciferase activity. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. In some experiments, pMKIT-NGFI-B was cotransfected into PC12 cells. In inhibition experiments, 293 cells cultured in six-well plates were transfected with 1 μg of NBRE-luc, 0.1 μg of pMKIT-NGFI-B, various amounts (0–0.9 μg) of pMKIT-ZINC or pMKITneo, and 0.05 μg of pRL-TK. Cells were harvested 24 h after transfection, and the luciferase activity was measured as described above. In some experiments, PC12 cells were transfected with 1 μg of NBRE-luc, 0.05 μg of pRL-TK, and 1 μg of pMKIT-NGFI-B. One h after transfection, NGF (50 ng/ml) was added to the culture. The cells were harvested 9 h after transfection, and the luciferase activity was measured as described above. In other studies, PC12 cells were transfected with 1 μg of NBRE-luc and 0.05 μg of pRL-TK. Eighteen h after transfection, the cells were stimulated with various concentrations of KCl. Sixty min after KCl stimulation, the KCl was removed, and the cells were cultured for 1.5 h in the presence or absence of NGF (50 ng/ml). The cells were harvested, and the luciferase activity was measured as described above. The NGFI-B gene is rapidly activated by a variety of stimuli that induce cells to differentiate or proliferate (5Fahrner T.J. Carroll S.L. Milbrandt J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6454-6459Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 6Hazel T.G. Misra R. Davis I.J. Greenberg M.E. Lau L.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3239-3246Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). We selected NGF, EGF, and membrane depolarization as stimuli since the signal transduction pathways mediating their actions have been well characterized (18Greene L.A. Kaplan D.R. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1995; 5: 579-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 19Gallin W.J. Greenberg M.E. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1995; 5: 367-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 20Ghosh A. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 268: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar). NGFI-B protein was induced in PC12 cells by both NGF and KCl. The expression levels rose more rapidly after NGF treatment, with peak levels occurring 60–90 min after NGF addition, than after KCl treatment, with peak levels occurring after 180 min (Fig. 1, A andB). The time course of NGFI-B induction by EGF was similar to that by NGF (data not shown) (6Hazel T.G. Misra R. Davis I.J. Greenberg M.E. Lau L.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3239-3246Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). NGFI-B induced by NGF, EGF, or KCl migrated as a diffuse band. The fact that alkaline phosphatase treatment of NGFI-B immunoprecipitated from stimulated PC12 cells resulted in a single predominant band on SDS-PAGE suggests that phosphorylation is the major form of post-translational modification of the molecule (data not shown) (5Fahrner T.J. Carroll S.L. Milbrandt J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6454-6459Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 6Hazel T.G. Misra R. Davis I.J. Greenberg M.E. Lau L.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3239-3246Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Slowly migrating NGFI-B species were detected in cells stimulated with either NGF or EGF and, to a lesser degree, with KCl (Fig. 1 C), an observation consistent with previous reports (5Fahrner T.J. Carroll S.L. Milbrandt J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6454-6459Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 6Hazel T.G. Misra R. Davis I.J. Greenberg M.E. Lau L.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3239-3246Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). This indicates that there is stimulation-specific phosphorylation of NGFI-B upon membrane depolarization and NGF or EGF treatment. NGFI-B is a transcriptionally active member of the nuclear receptor family. To examine the possible effects of differential phosphorylation on the transcriptional activity of NGFI-B, reporter gene assays were performed by transfecting the NBRE-luc reporter plasmid into PC12 cells and monitoring the luciferase activity (Fig. 2). When transfected PC12 cells were treated with KCl, the luciferase activity was detected after 2 h, and the peak of the activity was between 6 and 8 h (Fig.2 A). This delayed appearance of the luciferase activity seems reasonable when compared with the time course of NGFI-B induction with KCl (Fig. 1 B). In contrast, very little or no activity of luciferase was observed when the cells were treated with NGF or EGF even though NGFI-B induction itself was detected on immunoblots (Fig.1). When NGFI-B was expressed exogenously in PC12 cells by cotransfection of pMKIT-NGFI-B, the luciferase activity was extremely high (Fig. 2 B) even though the protein expression level was much lower than that endogenously induced by NGF (data not shown). These results demonstrate that NGFI-B endogenously induced by either NGF or EGF is unable to function as a transcription factor, whereas NGFI-B induced by membrane depolarization does have transcriptional activity. It should be noted that both NGF and EGF induce NGFI-B kinase I (13Hirata Y. Whalin M. Ginty D.D. Xing J. Greenberg M.E. Milbrandt J. Guroff G. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 1780-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), which phosphorylates Ser350 of the DNA-binding domain of NGFI-B. As shown below, KCl treatment does not lead to the phosphorylation of this residue. We have shown that in vitro phosphorylation of the DNA-binding domain of NGFI-B expressed in E. coli abolishes its ability to bind to the NBRE (12Hirata Y. Kiuchi K. Chen H.-C. Milbrandt J. Guroff G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24808-24812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To further investigate the effect of phosphorylation, we generated rDBD of NGFI-B, shown schematically in Fig.3 A. A gel retardation assay using in vitro translation products (NGFI-B and rDBD) demonstrated that rDBD retains the same DNA binding ability as that of wild-type NGFI-B (Fig. 3 B). rDBD present in the protein-DNA complex was also identified by supershift analysis with 9E10, a monoclonal anti-c-Myc epitope-tagged antibody. When 293 cells were transiently cotransfected with pMKIT-ZINC (rDBD), pMKIT-NGFI-B, and an NBRE-luc reporter plasmid, the luciferase activity induced by NGFI-B was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.3 C). Taken together, these data show that rDBD is able to recognize the same DNA sequence as NGFI-B (12Hirata Y. Kiuchi K. Chen H.-C. Milbrandt J. Guroff G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24808-24812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and, accordingly, has the ability to inhibit the transcriptional activity of NGFI-B by competitive binding to the NBRE. To study the DNA binding activity of rDBD in PC12 cells, transfectants expressing rDBD (PC12zinc) were established by the retrovirus gene transfer method (15Miller A.D. Rosman G.J. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 980-990PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were prepared from parental PC12 and PC12zinc cells stimulated with NGF or KCl and subjected to gel retardation assays (Fig. 4 A). rDBD derived from the transfected cells was able to bind to the NBRE, which is consistent with the result using the in vitro translation product. When transfectants were treated with KCl (30 min), the ability of rDBD to bind was not affected. However, rDBD from NGF-treated cells (30 min) failed to bind to the NBRE. The fact that phosphatase treatment of rDBD restored its ability to bind to the NBRE sequence (Fig. 4 B) indicates the importance of the phosphorylation of the DNA-binding domain of NGFI-B. Wild-type NGFI-B induced in PC12 cells appeared to behave in a similar way. While NGFI-B induced by KCl (3 h) did bind to the NBRE, the molecule induced and phosphorylated by NGF (1 h) did not bind. These results, taken together with the reporter gene assay (Fig. 2), strongly suggest the presence of mechanisms regulating the binding of NGFI-B to the NBRE in PC12 and PC12zinc cells. We have shown the possible involvement of Ser350 phosphorylation in vitroin the binding of NGFI-B to its response element (12Hirata Y. Kiuchi K. Chen H.-C. Milbrandt J. Guroff G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24808-24812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To detect the phosphorylation of NGFI-B at Ser350 in intact PC12 cells upon NGF treatment, we prepared a polyclonal antibody specific for phosphorylated Ser350 (anti-350P). Fig.5 demonstrates the specificity of this antibody. E. coli fragments, NGFI-B327(S350A) and NGFI-B327(S340A), were prepared and treated with protein kinase A in the presence or absence of ATP. When fully phosphorylated in the presence of ATP, the proteins detected with anti-350 antibody migrated more slowly on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 5 A, lanes 2 and4). Anti-350P antibody reacted with NGFI-B327(S340A) only when it was phosphorylated (Fig. 5 B, lane 2), suggesting the specific recognition of phosphorylated Ser350 by the antibody. Phosphorylation of rDBD in cells upon stimulation was examined using this antibody. rDBD was constitutively expressed in PC12zinc cells, and the residue corresponding to Ser350 of wild-type NGFI-B was phosphorylated when the cells were treated with NGF, but not with KCl (Fig. 6, C and D). Shorter periods of treatment were utilized to prevent endogenous NGFI-B induction in these transfectants. In PC12 cells (Fig. 6, Aand B), NGFI-B induction was observed with both NGF and KCl; however, phosphorylation of Ser350 was detected only in response to NGF treatment, an observation consistent with what is seen in these PC12zinc transfectants. Furthermore, phosphorylation for Ser350 was not observed when NGFI-B was exogenously expressed in PC12 cells by DNA transfection (Fig. 6 E). These data, along with the gel retardation assay (Fig. 4), confirm that NGF-induced changes in the phosphorylation state of Ser350accompany transcriptional deactivation of NGFI-B. Since the induction of NGFI-B by NGF results in minimal transcriptional activation, we asked whether NGF treatment would inhibit the transcriptional activity of NGFI-B introduced into the cells by other methods. Accordingly, we examined whether the transcriptional activity of NGFI-B induced either exogenously or endogenously in PC12 cells is reduced by NGF treatment. PC12 cells transiently transfected with pMKIT-NGFI-B and the NBRE-luc reporter plasmid were treated with NGF. Since the activation of NGFI-B kinase I was maximal within 5 min and remained at a lower level for several hours (13Hirata Y. Whalin M. Ginty D.D. Xing J. Greenberg M.E. Milbrandt J. Guroff G. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 1780-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), we used shorter periods of NGF stimulation in these experiments. Fig. 7 A shows that NGF treatment reduced the transcriptional activity of NGFI-B introduced exogenously by DNA transfection. Furthermore, NGF had no inhibitory effect on NGFI-B(S350A)-induced transcriptional activity, indicating that Ser350 is critical for the regulation of NGFI-B by NGF. Similar results were obtained when NGFI-B induced endogenously by KCl was examined. PC12 cells transfected with the NBRE-luc reporter plasmid were sequentially treated with KCl for 60 min, washed to remove KCl, and then treated with NGF or medium. NGF treatment reduced the luciferase activity induced by KCl (Fig.7 B). Immunoblot data obtained under these conditions revealed specific phosphorylation of NGFI-B at Ser350 in these PC12 cells (Fig. 7 C). These data indicate that NGF treatment inhibits the transcriptional activation of NGFI-B. Many immediate-early genes, including c-fos and c-jun, and zinc finger proteins, such as NGFI-B, encode transcriptional regulatory proteins. These gene products are thought to be important in regulating the cell's response to environmental changes and are probably the nuclear messengers of this response. Transcription factors, including members of the steroid-thyroid receptor family, are commonly modified by phosphorylation. Alterations in the phosphorylation of these receptors effect changes in their activity, stability, or subcellular location. In this report, we present several lines of evidence that indicate that NGF regulates the transcriptional activity of NGFI-B in PC12 cells and that this regulation is due, at least in part, to a specific phosphorylation of NGFI-B. First, NGFI-B induced by NGF does not show significant transcriptional activity, whereas NGFI-B induced by KCl does. This is associated with a diminished DNA binding of the protein induced by NGF. Second, NGFI-B synthesized upon induction by NGF or KCl is differentially phosphorylated. Phosphorylation of Ser350located in the A-box is induced when the cells are exposed to NGF, but not to KCl. Third, phosphorylation of Ser350 both in vitro and in vivo abolishes the DNA binding activity of rDBD, indicating that NGF-induced changes in the phosphorylation state of Ser350 could contribute to transcriptional deactivation of NGFI-B. Finally, the transcriptional activity induced by wild-type NGFI-B DNA transfection is reduced by NGF treatment, whereas the activity induced by NGFI-B(S350A) is not, suggesting that Ser350 phosphorylation is necessary for the regulation by NGF. It is unlikely, however, that phosphorylation of Ser350 is solely responsible for these regulatory changes since we have observed Ser350 phosphorylation under conditions where transcription is not decreased (data not shown). We postulate that Ser350 phosphorylation is necessary, but not sufficient, for the regulation of transcriptional activation of NGFI-B. Indeed, it is known that NGFI-B can be phosphorylated at multiple sites, and cellular localization studies have demonstrated that NGFI-B is found in approximately equal amounts in the cytoplasm and the nucleus of NGF-stimulated PC12 cells and that the highly phosphorylated species are predominantly cytoplasmic (5Fahrner T.J. Carroll S.L. Milbrandt J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6454-6459Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 6Hazel T.G. Misra R. Davis I.J. Greenberg M.E. Lau L.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3239-3246Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), indicating that phosphorylation events might be involved in the cellular localization of NGFI-B in PC12 cells. Alternatively, it is possible that phosphorylation of Ser350, while decreasing the ability of NGFI-B to bind to the NBRE, enhances its ability to bind to other, as yet unidentified sites. The role of phosphorylation in modulating the activity of transcription factors is well documented (21Schindler C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 621-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar, 22Ginty D.D. Bonni A. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1994; 77: 713-725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). One of the best examples is the transcription factor cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB). CREB, which was originally identified as a mediator of gene expression that occurs in response to increased concentrations of cAMP, regulates the cellular response to growth factors. Growth factors enhance the transcriptional potential of CREB by stimulating CREB phosphorylation at a specific amino acid, Ser133 (22Ginty D.D. Bonni A. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1994; 77: 713-725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of CREB at Ser133 is critical for NGF induction of c-fos transcription in PC12 cells (22Ginty D.D. Bonni A. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1994; 77: 713-725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). Recently, CREB kinase was identified as a member of the pp90 rsk family, RSK2 (23Xing J. Ginty D.D. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1996; 273: 959-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar). It is of interest that the NGF-inducible kinase, NGFI-B kinase I, appears to be very similar to CREB kinase (13Hirata Y. Whalin M. Ginty D.D. Xing J. Greenberg M.E. Milbrandt J. Guroff G. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 1780-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We found that the transcriptional activity of NGFI-B introduced by DNA transfection is reduced by NGF treatment. We also found that sequential treatment of PC12 cells with KCl and NGF reduces the transcriptional activity of NGFI-B compared with that seen with KCl treatment alone. Finally, although NGF itself induces NGFI-B, the protein so induced has little or no transcriptional activity. Thus, we suggest that the induction of NGFI-B kinase(s) by NGF regulates the transcriptional activity of NGFI-B, whether induced by NGF or membrane depolarization. It is of interest to consider the biological meaning of the NGF-induced decrease in the transcriptional activity of NGFI-B. It is known that spontaneous electrical activity in prenatal neurons, which develops before the establishment of synapses, is important and that electrical impulses can regulate the gene expression necessary for neuronal differentiation. For example, Itoh et al. (24Itoh K. Stevens B. Schachner M. Fields R.D. Science. 1995; 270: 1369-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) have reported the down-regulation of the neural cell adhesion molecule L1 on murine dorsal root ganglion neurons by specific patterns of neural impulses. Furthermore, the establishment of synapses and the switch of survival requirements for some neurons from activity-dependent stimuli to neurotrophin-dependent survival appear to alter the requirements for the expression of certain genes. Thus, Itohet al. (24Itoh K. Stevens B. Schachner M. Fields R.D. Science. 1995; 270: 1369-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) further demonstrated that NGF abolished the down-regulation imposed by electrical impulses. It is also known that the expression of specific gene products, such as the subunits of the acetylcholine receptor, changes upon synapse formation and the associated availability of trophic factors (25Kues W.A. Brenner H.R. Sakmann B. Witzemann V. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 949-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Although specific genes containing the NBRE motif whose expression is altered by NGF are not known so far, our findings could provide an insight into the changes in gene expression that occur upon synapse formation, and they could eventually reveal a new set of transcriptional events that are required for neuronal development before synapses are formed, but that are suppressed when neurotrophins become available through synapse formation. We thank Drs. Michael Whalin, Michael Czar, Makoto Shibutani, Ted Mills, and Doug Fields for helpful discussions during the preparation of this manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2045267378,"The effects of extracellular Zn2+ and pH and intravesicular pH on insulin and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) secretion from pancreatic beta cells were investigated. Insulin and 5-HT secretion from single cells was detected by amperometry as a series of current spikes corresponding to detection of multimolecular packets secreted by exocytosis. Spike width was used as a measure of the kinetics of clearance from the cell and the area of spikes as a measure of amount released. Changes in extracellular pH from 6.9 to 7.9 caused insulin spikes to become narrower with no change in area, whereas the same treatments had no effect on 5-HT secretion. Treatment of cells with Bafilomycin A1 orN-ethylmaleimide, both of which are expected to increase intravesicular pH by inhibiting V-type H+-ATPase, had no effect on 5-HT secretion but caused insulin spikes to become more narrow. These results indicate that exposure to high pH, whether intravesicular or extracellular, accelerates release of insulin during exocytosis without affecting the amount of insulin released. Increasing extracellular Zn2+ concentration from 0 to 25 μm increased the width and decreased the area of insulin spikes without affecting 5-HT secretion. Zn2+ effects were likely exerted through a common-ion effect on Zn2+-insulin dissociation. It was concluded that intravesicular storage conditions and extracellular ions can affect free insulin concentration in the vicinity of beta cells during secretion."
https://openalex.org/W2051358693,"The role of Ca2+ in stimulus-response coupling in nonexcitable cells is still not well understood. The Ca2+ responses of individual cells are extremely diverse, often displaying marked oscillations, and almost nothing is known about the specific features of these Ca2+signals that are important for the functional response of a cell. Using the RBL-2H3 mucosal mast cell as a model, we have studied the temporal relationship between changes in intracellular Ca2+ and serotonin secretion at the single-cell level using simultaneous indo-1 photometry and constant potential amperometry. Secretion in response to antigen never occurs until intracellular Ca2+ is elevated, nor is it seen during the first few oscillations in Ca2+. Exocytotic events tend to be clustered around the peaks of oscillations, but excellent secretion is also seen in cells with sustained elevations in Ca2+. Ca2+ release from stores in the absence of influx fails to elicit secretion. If refilling and continued release of Ca2+ from stores is prevented with thapsigargin, Ca2+ influx can still trigger secretion, suggesting that store-associated microdomains of Ca2+ are not required for exocytosis. Our findings demonstrate the importance of an amplitude-encoded Ca2+ signal and Ca2+influx for stimulus-secretion coupling in these nonexcitable cells.

Our findings demonstrate the importance of an amplitude-encoded Ca2+ signal and Ca2+influx for stimulus-secretion coupling in these nonexcitable cells. Although it is generally agreed that an increase in Ca2+ is both necessary and sufficient for the initiation of secretion in most excitable cells, the role of Ca2+ in nonexcitable cells is less clear (1Penner R. Neher E. J. Exp. Biol. 1988; 139: 329-345PubMed Google Scholar). The individual Ca2+responses of nonexcitable cells are often extremely heterogeneous, and many models have been proposed for the generation of these complex and often oscillatory patterns (2Meyer T. Stryer L. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1991; 20: 153-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Both amplitude-encoded and frequency-encoded Ca2+ signals have been proposed (3Berridge M.J. Cobbold P.H. Cuthbertson K.S.R. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1988; 320: 325-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 4Berridge M.J. Nature. 1997; 759: 760Google Scholar), and the availability of both mechanisms would allow multiple signaling pathways to be activated by Ca2+ in a single cell (5Fewtrell C. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1993; 55: 427-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Hepatocytes, with their repetitive oscillations of constant amplitude but variable frequency are prime candidates for frequency-modulated Ca2+ signaling (6Woods N.M. Cuthbertson K.S.R. Cobbold P.H. Nature. 1986; 319: 600-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar), and it has now been shown that mitochondrial NAD(P)H production in these cells is indeed regulated by the frequency of Ca2+ oscillations (7Pralong W.-F.

Cell. 1996; 82: 415-424Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (947) Google Scholar). In contrast, it seems clear that the secretory response of single rat salivary acinar cells is tightly coupled to the amplitude of the Ca2+response (9Foskett J.K. Melvin J.E. Science. 1989; 244: 1582-1585Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), as is ciliary beating in tracheal epithelial cells (10Salathe M. Bookman R.J. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 431-440PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has recently been shown that differential activation of transcription factors in B lymphocytes is achieved via non-oscillatory Ca2+ signals of different amplitudes and durations (11Dolmetsch R.E. Lewis R.S. Goodnow C.C. Healy J.I. Nature. 1997; 386: 855-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (1552) Google Scholar). In most cases, however, it has not been easy to determine the specific features of the Ca2+ signal that are important for a physiological response. This is because sensitive methods for detecting function at the single-cell level and with high temporal resolution are not readily available. Furthermore, it now seems clear that additional signals, such as the activation of protein kinase C (12Ozawa K. Szallasi Z. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Mischak H. Mushinski J.F. Beaven M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1749-1756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or one or more G-proteins (13Gomperts B.D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1990; 52: 591-606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), are often required for the initiation of secretion in nonexcitable cells. We have therefore examined the Ca2+dependence of secretion at the single-cell level using the RBL-2H3 mucosal mast cell. The relatively slow time course of secretion (14Weintraub W.H. Cleveland-Wolfe P. Fewtrell C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 160: 389-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and the complex Ca2+ signals seen in response to antigen (5Fewtrell C. Annu. Rev.

RBL-2H3 mucosal mast cells (17Barsumian E.L. Isersky C. Petrino M.G. Siraganian R.P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1981; 11: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar) seeded at low density on glass coverslips were sensitized with dinitrophenyl-specific immunoglobulin E and allowed to incorporate exogenous serotonin as described previously (14Weintraub W.H. Cleveland-Wolfe P. Fewtrell C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 160: 389-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated with 0.5 μmindo-1/acetoxymethyl ester for 20 min at 37 °C in modified Tyrode's solution (135 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5.6 mm glucose, 10 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.4) containing 250 μm sulfinpyrazone and 0.1% bovine serum albumin (16Millard P.J. Ryan T.A. Webb W.W. Fewtrell C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19730-19739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Experiments were conducted in modified Tyrode's solution containing 250 μm sulfinpyrazone and 0.05% gelatin. Cells were maintained at 35–37 °C throughout the experiment and were stimulated by perfusing the sample chamber with 3 ml of warm solution containing 1 μg/ml antigen (bovine γ-globulin to which 10–20 dinitrophenyl groups/molecule had been coupled (18Eisen H.N. Kern M. Newton W.T. Helmreich E. J. Exp. Med. 1959; 110: 187-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar)). Fluorescence of the intracellular Ca2+ indicator, indo-1, was excited using light from a Hg lamp filtered at 365 nm. Emitted light from a single cell was split using a 455 nm dichroic mirror and measured with a pair of photomultiplier detectors after filtering at 405 and 485 nm. Data were acquired, stored, and analyzed using Oscar or FeliX software (PTI Inc., South Brunswick, NJ) on a microcomputer equipped with an A/D interface board. The indo-1 ratio ((F 405/F 485) −R min) was calculated after correction for background fluorescence, and the intracellular Ca2+concentration was determined assuming a K d of 250 nm for indo-1 (19Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Microelectrodes for amperometry were prepared by inserting an 8-μm diameter carbon fiber into a glass capillary tube, which was then drawn in a patch pipette puller and sealed with cyanoacrylate glue. Once the glue had cured, the carbon fiber was trimmed back as close as possible (∼5 μm) to the glass, and the pipette was back-filled with 3 m KCl. Unless otherwise stated, the electrode potential was set to +550 mV, and the fiber tip was placed <4 μm from the cell surface (20Jankowski J.A. Schroeder T.J. Ciolkowski E.L. Wightman R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14694-14700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Amperometric responses were filtered at 500 Hz, digitized, and stored on video tape. Amperometric signals were never detected in unstimulated cells or in cells that had not been loaded with exogenous serotonin (14Weintraub W.H. Cleveland-Wolfe P. Fewtrell C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 160: 389-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), thus confirming that they are due to exocytotic release of serotonin. The total amount of serotonin detected was calculated from the integral of the current associated with all amperometric events (21Chow R.H. von Rüden L. Neher E. Nature. 1992; 356: 60-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar) observed prior to and immediately after detergent lysis for a number of individual cells. From this we estimated that we can detect about 25% of the total cell serotonin (14Weintraub W.H. Cleveland-Wolfe P. Fewtrell C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 160: 389-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), which is similar to other estimates for the efficiency of amperometric detection of exocytosis (21Chow R.H. von Rüden L. Neher E. Nature. 1992; 356: 60-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar, 22Zhou Z. Misler S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3498-3505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The response of a typical mast cell when immunoglobulin E receptors on the cell surface are aggregated by antigen is shown in Fig. 1 A (16Millard P.J. Ryan T.A. Webb W.W. Fewtrell C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19730-19739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Ca2+ response was measured using the fluorescent indicator, indo-1 (19Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and the release of serotonin from secretory vesicles in the same cell was monitored electrochemically (23Tatham P.E.R. Duchen M.R. Millar J. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1991; 419: 409-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) using constant potential amperometry (24Wightman R.M. Jankowski J.A. Kennedy R.T. Kawagoe K.T. Schroeder T.J. Leszczyszyn D.J. Near J.A. Diliberto Jr., E.J. Viveros O.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10754-10758Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). All amperometric events have the same asymmetric shape (Fig. 1 B), which is characteristic of exocytotic release of single secretory vesicles (24Wightman R.M. Jankowski J.A. Kennedy R.T. Kawagoe K.T. Schroeder T.J. Leszczyszyn D.J. Near J.A. Diliberto Jr., E.J. Viveros O.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10754-10758Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). As has been shown in other cell types (21Chow R.H. von Rüden L. Neher E. Nature. 1992; 356: 60-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar, 25Alvarez de Toledo G. Fernández-Chacón R. Fernández J.M. Nature. 1993; 363: 554-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar), some of the amperometric spikes are preceded by a small rising phase or “foot” (data not shown), which is thought to be due to the slow release of vesicle contents through a narrow fusion pore that forms before full vesicle fusion. Secretory events do not occur until intracellular Ca2+ is elevated, and in cells where Ca2+ is oscillating, amperometric events tend to be clustered around the peaks of the oscillations, and are infrequent or absent in the troughs between oscillations (Fig. 1, A and B). In contrast to pituitary gonadotrophs, where exocytosis is largely confined to the rising phase of a Ca2+ oscillation (26Tse A. Tse F.W. Almers W. Hille B. Science. 1993; 260: 82-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), secretory events in the mast cell do not appear to be specifically linked to either the rising or falling phase of the oscillation or to the peak itself (Fig.1 B). There is no obvious threshold concentration of Ca2+ for the initiation of secretion, and secretion is not detected during every increase in Ca2+ (Figs. 1 and 4). Histogram analysis of the Ca2+ concentrations at which secretion is observed in oscillating cells (Fig.2, narrow hatch marks) shows that the majority of amperometric events occur at intracellular Ca2+ concentrations above 300 nm, even though the time spent at such high Ca2+ concentrations is relatively small (Fig. 2, wide hatch marks). These findings suggest that the Ca2+ signal in mast cells is amplitude-encoded and that an increase in intracellular Ca2+ is essential for the initiation of secretion in response to antigen.Figure 2Ca2+ dependence of secretion. Histogram analysis of the Ca2+concentrations at which amperometric events were detected (narrow hatch marks) together with the fractional calcium dwell time, which is the fraction of time spent by the cells at the indicated Ca2+ concentrations (wide hatch marks) after the addition of antigen (1 μg/ml). Data are pooled from eight cells with oscillatory Ca2+ responses similar to those shown in Fig.1 A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Additional evidence comes from the experiment shown in Fig.3. After antigen stimulation, intracellular Ca2+ increases and secretory events are detected (Fig. 3 A). When Ca2+ influx is inhibited by depolarizing the cell in high (140 mm) K+ (27Mohr F.C. Fewtrell C. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 783-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), intracellular Ca2+ drops to resting levels, and secretion is immediately halted. Upon repolarization, intracellular Ca2+ increases, and there is a burst of secretion. As intracellular Ca2+ falls again, secretion is inhibited but can be restored (Fig. 3 B) by stimulating the cell with the Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin (28Thastrup O. Cullen P.J. Drobak B.K. Hanley M.R. Dawson A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2466-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (2992) Google Scholar), which depletes stores of Ca2+ (29Jackson T.R. Patterson S.I. Thastrup O. Hanley M.R. Biochem. J. 1988; 253: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) and stimulates further Ca2+ influx (30Putney Jr., J.W. Cell Calcium. 1990; 11: 611-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1260) Google Scholar). Another cycle of K+depolarization and repolarization leads to the same interruption of secretion during the decrease in intracellular Ca2+, and when intracellular Ca2+ is increased further using the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin, there is another burst of secretion. Secretion is rarely seen in cells with oscillations from near resting levels of Ca2+, despite peak Ca2+concentrations that match or exceed the levels seen in secreting cells (Fig. 4 A). However, when a cell with oscillations from basal Ca2+ levels and no secretion progresses to an oscillatory response superimposed on an elevated Ca2+ level, secretion begins, even though there is only a small increase in the mean intracellular Ca2+concentration (Fig. 4 B). Secretion then increases further during the subsequent high but non-oscillatory Ca2+response (Fig. 4 B). Indeed, cells showing sustained, non-oscillatory Ca2+ signals in response to antigen usually have excellent secretory responses (Fig. 4 C). Secretion is also observed in response to thapsigargin, which elicits a sustained, non-oscillatory increase in intracellular Ca2+ (Fig.4 D). Thus, Fig. 4 clearly demonstrates that Ca2+oscillations are neither necessary nor sufficient for exocytosis to occur. Again, this is consistent with an amplitude-encoded Ca2+ signaling mechanism, in which a relatively prolonged increase in Ca2+ is required for efficient secretion, and argues against a frequency-encoded mechanism (3Berridge M.J. Cobbold P.H. Cuthbertson K.S.R. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1988; 320: 325-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 31Sjödin L. Dahlén H.G. Gylfe E. J. Physiol. (Lond .). 1991; 444: 763-776Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). One notable feature of the responses of all cells to antigen is the absence of secretory events during the initial part of the Ca2+ response (Figs. 1 and 4). In contrast, when Ca2+ influx is briefly interrupted, a burst of secretory events occurs without a delay once influx is restored and intracellular Ca2+ increases again (Fig. 3). The relationship between the delay in the onset of the Ca2+ response after the addition of antigen (Ca2+ lag time) and the delay in the initiation of secretion (secretion lag time) is shown in Fig.5. As expected, cells with long Ca2+ lag times tend to have long secretion lag times, because secretion never occurs unless intracellular Ca2+ is increased. There does not appear to be a fixed latent period between the onset of the Ca2+ response and the initiation of secretion, but in general secretion occurs 30–60 s after the increase in Ca2+ (Fig. 5). The initial Ca2+ oscillations have been attributed to release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores because they do not depend on Ca2+ influx (16Millard P.J. Ryan T.A. Webb W.W. Fewtrell C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19730-19739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); influx is, however, necessary to replenish the stores, sustain the Ca2+response (16Millard P.J. Ryan T.A. Webb W.W. Fewtrell C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19730-19739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and support secretion (27Mohr F.C. Fewtrell C. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 783-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Thus, a possible explanation for the lack of secretion during the first few oscillations is that secretion does not occur until stores have been depleted sufficiently to activate Ca2+ influx. However, using the manganese influx technique to monitor the antigen-induced activation of the Ca2+ influx pathway (32Merritt J.E. Jacob R. Hallam T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1522-1527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Shuttleworth T.J. Cell Calcium. 1994; 15: 457-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), we were unable to dissociate the initial increase in Ca2+ from the activation of influx (Fig. 6; n = 5 cells). Thus the delay in secretion cannot be attributed to slow activation of Ca2+ influx. It is possible that the first few Ca2+ oscillations are required for the transport or docking of secretory vesicles (34von Rüden L. Neher E. Science. 1993; 262: 1061-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). In excitable cells, both the recruitment of secretory vesicles and exocytosis itself are Ca2+-dependent (34von Rüden L. Neher E. Science. 1993; 262: 1061-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). However, our finding that secretion is immediately halted when intracellular Ca2+ is reduced to resting levels but resumes as soon as intracellular Ca2+ increases again (Fig. 3) suggests that Ca2+-dependent vesicle docking may not be the rate-limiting step in the initiation of secretion from mucosal mast cells. Another possibility is that the initial Ca2+ response is necessary for the production of other intracellular messengers (12Ozawa K. Szallasi Z. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Mischak H. Mushinski J.F. Beaven M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1749-1756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Beaven M.A. Guthrie D.F. Moore J.P. Smith G.A. Hesketh T.R. Metcalfe J.C. J.

A detailed biophysical study of the Ca2+ dependence of exocytosis in peritoneal mast cells dialyzed with a nonhydrolyzable analogue of guanosine triphosphate, GTPγS, 1The abbreviation used is: GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate. also found little or no secretion during the initial increase in Ca2+ (36Neher E. J. Physiol. (Lond .). 1988; 395: 193-214Crossref Scopus (192) Google Scholar). It was suggested that this might be due to the slow activation of protein kinase C (36Neher E. J. Physiol. (Lond .). 1988; 395: 193-214Crossref Scopus (192) Google Scholar), which is also required for secretion in mast cells (12Ozawa K. Szallasi Z. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Mischak H. Mushinski J.F. Beaven M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1749-1756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and this may also be an explanation for our results. Consistent with this, we found that addition of the protein kinase C activator, phorbol myristate acetate (50 nm), 5–8 min before antigen reduced the delay between the initial increase in Ca2+ and the initiation of secretion from 34 ± 17 s (mean ± S.D., n = 9 cells) to 16 ± 8 s (n = 10 cells; p < 0.025, Student's unpaired t test). It is well established that Ca2+ influx is required for antigen-induced secretion in RBL-2H3 mucosal mast cells (27Mohr F.C. Fewtrell C. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 783-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 37Fewtrell C. Mohr F.C. Ryan T.A. Millard P.J. CIBA Found. Symp. 1989; 147: 114-132PubMed Google Scholar), and Fig. 7 A confirms that secretion does not occur until extracellular Ca2+ is restored to an antigen-stimulated cell. However, the role played by Ca2+ influx is not clear. Because the Ca2+response due to release from stores in the absence of influx is relatively transient and often consists of oscillations to base-line levels of Ca2+ (Fig. 7 A and Ref. 16Millard P.J. Ryan T.A. Webb W.W. Fewtrell C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19730-19739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it may be that influx is simply required to sustain the Ca2+ response for long enough for secretion to occur. Alternatively, it is possible that microdomains of high Ca2+ close to the site of exocytosis, which are known to be important in excitable cells (38Augustine G.J. Neher E. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1992; 2: 302-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), might also occur in mast cells (39Lawson D. Fewtrell C. Raff M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1978; 79: 394-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Because the conductance of the calcium release-activated Ca2+ channel found in mast cells and lymphocytes is much smaller (40Zweifach A. Lewis R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6295-6299Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar) than that of the voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels found in excitable cells, it may not be possible to generate such steep gradients of Ca2+ close to the plasma membrane in mast cells. In contrast, the Ca2+conductance of inositol trisphosphate receptor channels is high (41Bezprozvanny I. Ehrlich B.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 104: 821-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), so Ca2+ microdomains in the vicinity of the stores may be more important for exocytosis in nonexcitable cells. If this is the case, then depleting stores of Ca2+ and preventing them from refilling using the Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin should prevent secretion even when Ca2+ influx is restored. However, as Fig. 7 B shows, exocytotic events still occur under these conditions, provided that extracellular Ca2+ is present. These results clearly demonstrate that Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane can directly trigger exocytosis and that refilling and continued release of Ca2+ from stores and any store-associated microdomains of Ca2+ are not essential for exocytosis in mucosal mast cells. To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine in detail the temporal relationship between individual secretory events and Ca2+ oscillations in nonexcitable cells, and it clearly demonstrates that the Ca2+ signal in individual mucosal mast cells is amplitude-encoded. We have also confirmed at the single-cell level that there is an absolute requirement for elevated intracellular Ca2+ in antigen-induced secretion from mucosal mast cells and that this secretion depends on Ca2+ influx. We are grateful to Dr. Paul A. Smith of Oxford University for showing us how to measure serotonin secretion electrochemically and providing us with carbon fibers. We also thank Dr. Janet Scarlett for statistical advice."
https://openalex.org/W2089465684,"MEK kinases (MEKKs) are serine-threonine kinases that regulate sequential protein phosphorylation pathways involving mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), including members of the Jun kinase (JNK) family. MEKK1 is a 196 kDa protein that when cleaved by caspase-3-like proteases generates an active COOH-terminal kinase domain. Expression of the MEKK1 kinase domain is sufficient to induce apoptosis. Mutation of MEKK1 to prevent its proteolytic cleavage protects cells from MEKK1-mediated cell death even though the JNK pathway is still activated, indicating that JNK activation is not sufficient to induce cell death. The inducible acute expression at modest levels of the activated MEKK1 kinase domain can be used to potentiate the apoptotic response to low dose ultraviolet irradiation and cisplatin. Similarly, in L929 fibrosarcoma cells inducible acute expression of the kinase domain of MEKK1 markedly increased the cell death response to tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha). The findings demonstrate that acute expression of an active form of MEKK1 can potentiate the cell death response to external stress stimuli. Manipulation of MEKK1 proteolysis and its regulation of signal pathways involved in apoptosis has significant potential for anticancer therapies when used in combination with therapeutic agents at doses that alone have little or modest effects on cell viability."
https://openalex.org/W2047589448,"ApoC-III overexpression in mice results in severe hypertriglyceridemia due primarily to a delay in the clearance of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. We have, in primary cultures of rat hepatocytes, characterized a lipolysis-stimulated receptor (LSR). The apparent number of LSR that are available on rat liver plasma membranes is negatively correlated with plasma triglyceride concentrations measured in the fed state. We therefore proposed that the primary physiological role of the LSR is to contribute to the cellular uptake of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. We have now tested the effect of apoC-III on the binding of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins to LSR. Supplementation of125I-very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) with apoC-III inhibited the LSR-mediated binding, internalization, and degradation of 125I-VLDL in primary cultures of rat hepatocytes. Studies using isolated rat liver plasma membranes showed that enrichment of human VLDL and chylomicrons with synthetic or purified human apoC-III decreased their binding to the LSR by about 40%. Supplementation of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins under the same conditions with human apoC-II had no such inhibitory effect, despite the fact that this apoprotein bound as efficiently as apoC-III to these particles.Preincubation of LDL with apoC-III did not modify its binding to LSR. Partitioning studies using 125I-apoC-III showed that this lack of effect was due to apoC-III's inability to efficiently associate with LDL. Purified human apoC-III1 was as efficient as the synthetic nonsialylated form of apoC-III in inhibiting binding of VLDL to LSR. However, despite a 2-fold greater binding of apoC-III2 to VLDL, this isoform was a less efficient inhibitor of the binding of VLDL to LSR than apoC-III1 or nonsialylated apoC-III. Desialylation of apoC-III2 by treatment with neuraminidase increased the inhibition of VLDL binding to LSR to a level similar to that observed with apoC-III1and nonsialylated apoC-III. We propose that apoC-III regulates in part the rate of removal of triglyceride-rich particles by inhibiting their binding to the LSR, and that the level of inhibition is determined by the degree of apoC-III sialylation.

Acta. 1986; 875: 211-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and it was established in the early 1980's that supplementation of small chylomicrons or apoE-containing triglyceride emulsions with apoC-III inhibited their uptake in perfused rat livers (5Quarfordt S.H. Michalopoulus G. Schirmer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14642-14647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Shelburne F. Hanks J. Meyers W. Quarfordt S. J. Clin.

An inhibitory effect was also observed with apoC-I and C-II, but was less pronounced and not consistently observed (5Quarfordt S.H. Michalopoulus G. Schirmer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14642-14647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Shelburne F. Hanks J. Meyers W. Quarfordt S. J. Clin. Invest. 1980; 65: 652-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Genetic linkage map studies suggest that polymorphism of apoC-III is associated with hypertriglyceridemia (8Li W.W. Dammerman M.M. Smith J.D. Metzger S. Breslow J.L. Leff T. J. Clin.

Human subjects with defects of apoC-III and apoA-I genes had low plasma TG levels, attributed primarily to an accelerated clearance of TGRL (12Forte T.M. Nichols A.V. Krauss R.M. Norum R.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1984; 74: 1601-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 13Ginsberg H.N. Le N.-A. Goldberg I.J. Gibson J.C. Rubinstein A. Wang-Iverson P. Norum R. Brown W.V. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 78: 1287-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). In transgenic mice, suppression of apoC-III expression by homologous recombination increased the removal rate of chylomicron remnants and thus reduced the postprandial triglyceridemia (14Maeda N. Li H. Lee D. Oliver P. Quarfordt S.H. Osada J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23610-23616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, overexpression of apoC-III increased the plasma concentrations of TG in a dose-dependent manner, and thereby caused a reduction of the catabolic rate of TGRL (15Ito Y. Azrolan N. O'Connell A. Walsh A. Breslow J.L. Science. 1990; 249: 790-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 16Aalto-Setälä K. Fisher E.A. Chen X. Chajek-Shaul T. Hayek T. Zechner R. Walsh A. Ramakrishnan R. Ginsberg H.N. Breslow J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1889-1900Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). The mechanisms through which apoC-III regulates the catabolism of TGRL are complex and involve both lipolysis and cellular uptake of these particles. Tissue lipase activities of apoC-III overexpressor mice were not different when compared with those of normal mice, nor were their VLDL defective as substrates for lipolysis (16Aalto-Setälä K. Fisher E.A. Chen X. Chajek-Shaul T. Hayek T. Zechner R. Walsh A. Ramakrishnan R. Ginsberg H.N. Breslow J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1889-1900Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). The hypertriglyceridemia of transgenic apoC-III overexpressors was corrected when these animals were cross-bred with mice overexpressing apoE, consistent with the hypothesis that apoC-III interferes with an apoE-mediated process (17de Silva H.V. Lauer S.J. Wang J. Simonett W.S. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Taylor J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2324-2335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ApoE has been shown to mediate the binding of TGRL to heparan sulfate proteoglycans (for review, see Ref. 18Goldberg I.J. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 693-707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and it was recently reported that the VLDL isolated from apoC-III overexpressors were defective in binding to heparin-Sepharose, suggesting that the excess apoC-III inhibits their binding to heparan sulfate proteoglycans on endothelial cells (19Aalto-Setälä K. Weinstock P.H. Bisgaier C.L. Wu L. Smith J.D. Breslow J.L. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1802-1811Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because most of the plasma lipolytic enzymes, i.e. lipoprotein and hepatic lipases, are bound to heparan sulfate proteoglycans, this docking defect of apoC-III-enriched TGRL could subsequently reduce the rate of lipolysis. It is also widely accepted that apoE serves as the primary ligand for the cellular uptake of TGRL. It is therefore possible that apoC-III's hypertriglyceridemic effect is due in part to a decreased rate of cellular uptake of TGRL by liver cells. ApoC-III has been shown to decrease the binding of VLDL to the low density lipoprotein (LDL)-receptor expressed in human fibroblasts (20Sehayek E. Eisenberg S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18259-18267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Clavey V. Lestavel-Delattre S. Copin C. Bard J.M. Fruchart J.C. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 963-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). This inhibitory effect was observed not only with apoC-III, but also with apoC-I and C-II, apoC-I being the most effective. In addition, apoC-I, but not apoC-III, inhibits the binding of apoE-enriched β-VLDL to the LDL-receptor related protein (LRP) (22Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Kowal R.C. Herz J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22453-22459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have characterized a third candidate receptor, the lipolysis-stimulated receptor (LSR), which is activated by free fatty acids (FFA), and is distinct from the LDL-receptor and the LRP (23Bihain B.E. Yen F.T. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4628-4636Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar,24Yen F.T. Mann C.J. Guermani L.M. Hannouche N.F. Hubert N. Hornick C.A. Bordeau V.N. Agnani G. Bihain B.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1172-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Similar to the LDL receptor, the LSR binds both apoB and apoE (23Bihain B.E. Yen F.T. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4628-4636Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar,24Yen F.T. Mann C.J. Guermani L.M. Hannouche N.F. Hubert N. Hornick C.A. Bordeau V.N. Agnani G. Bihain B.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1172-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). However, unlike the LDL receptor, its affinity is maximal for TGRL (23Bihain B.E. Yen F.T. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4628-4636Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 24Yen F.T. Mann C.J. Guermani L.M. Hannouche N.F. Hubert N. Hornick C.A. Bordeau V.N. Agnani G. Bihain B.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1172-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the affinity for the LSR of VLDL isolated from subjects with type III hyperlipidemia (apoE-2/2 phenotype) is decreased when compared with that isolated from normal individuals (24Yen F.T. Mann C.J. Guermani L.M. Hannouche N.F. Hubert N. Hornick C.A. Bordeau V.N. Agnani G. Bihain B.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1172-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The physiological significance of the LSR as candidate chylomicron remnant receptor has remained controversial. Indeed, during in vitroassays, maximal activation of the LSR requires the addition of FFA at concentrations that exceed albumin binding capacity and are therefore at levels not normally observed under physiological conditions. It has been shown that FFA bound to albumin at the physiological molar ratio of 1 to 1 are sufficient to consistently activate the LSR. However, under these conditions, the receptor activation is only 10% of the maximal activity. We therefore speculate that under physiological conditions, the LSR is not activated primarily by FFA circulating in plasma bound to albumin, but rather by the FFA generated at the site of lipolysis. When intestinally-derived lipoproteins arrive in the liver sinusoid and are hydrolyzed by hepatic lipase (25Sanan D.A. Fan J. Bensadoun A. Taylor J.M. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1002-1013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and possibly also lipoprotein lipase (26Wallinder L. Peterson J. Olivecrona T. Bengtsson-Olivecrona G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 575: 166-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 27Camps L. Reina M. Llobera M. Bengtsson-Olivecrona G. Olivecrona T. Vilaro S. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 1877-1888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is likely that relatively high local concentrations of FFA are produced. Consistent with the hypothesis that LSR participates in the clearance of chylomicrons is the finding that the apparent number of LSR expressed in rat liver plasma membranes strongly (p < 0.001) and negatively correlates with plasma TG concentrations measured in the physiological postprandial stage of these animals (28Mann C.J. Khallou J. Chevreuil O. Troussard A.A. Guermani L.M. Launay K. Delplanque B. Yen F.T. Bihain B.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 35: 10421-10431Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To further examine the potential physiological significance of the LSR, we have now characterized the effect of apoC-III on the binding of the different LSR ligands. Data presented here show that apoC-III is a potent and specific inhibitor of TGRL, but not LDL binding to LSR. Na[125I] was purchased from Amersham (Les Ulis, France). Oleic acid (0–1008), bovine serum albumin (BSA) (A2153), neuraminidase from Clostridium perfringens (N2876), leupeptin, and benzamidine were obtained from Sigma (St. Quentin, Fallavier, France). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, penicillin-streptomycin, glutamine, and fetal bovine serum were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. (Eragny, France). Sodium suramin was purchased from FBA Pharmaceutical (Westhaven, CT). Male Sprague-Dawley rats (Janvier Breeding Center, Le Genest-St.-Isle, France) were housed in an animal care facility equipped with a 12-h light/dark cycle. Animals were given water and regular chow ad libitum, except for 15 h prior to liver isolation when they received only water. For isolation of livers, animals were anesthetized with ether, and the livers were perfused through the portal vein with ice-cold Hepes-buffered saline solution (5 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.4). The livers were then immediately excised, and used for the preparation of liver plasma membranes. All plasma samples used for lipoprotein isolation were supplemented with 0.01 volumes of the following inhibitor mixture: leupeptin (1 mg/ml), benzamidine (10 mg/ml), and sodium azide (300 mm) prior to lipoprotein isolation. VLDL (density (d) < 1.006 g/ml) and LDL (1.025 < d < 1.055 g/ml) were prepared from plasma of overnight fasted human subjects (29Havel R.J. Eder H.A. Bragdon J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1955; 34: 1345-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (6476) Google Scholar). Chylomicrons were prepared by ultracentrifugation (30,000 × g, 1 h, 10 °C, Beckman Ti50.2 rotor) of plasma drawn from human subjects 2 h after a breakfast consisting of 3 croissants with butter and jam, and 250 ml of whole milk. Contaminating albumin was removed from the chylomicron fraction by incubation for 30 min at room temperature with an equivalent volume of swollen Blue Sepharose CL-6B gel (Pharmacia Biotech, Orsay, France). This was verified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis separation of chylomicron protein on 4–18% gradient gels. Image analysis (ImageMaster, Pharmacia Biotech) of Coomassie Blue-stained gels indicated that after this treatment, albumin represented less than 1% of total protein. All lipoproteins were stored in the dark at 4 °C under N2for use within 4 days of their isolation. Human apoC-III was synthetically prepared using solid phase methodology (30Merrifield R.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1963; 85: 2149-2154Crossref Scopus (6655) Google Scholar) as described previously (31McConathy W.J. Gesquiere J.C. Bass H. Tartar A. Fruchart J.-C. Wang C.S. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 995-1003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and provided the source of non-sialylated apoC-III. The apoC-III was stored at −20 °C as a lyophilized powder and was dissolved into 0.1 m phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, on the day of use. Human apoC-III preparations containing 1 and 2 sialyl residues were purified from plasma obtained from the local blood bank, as described (32Jackson R.L. Holdsworth G. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 288-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), except that chromatographic steps were conducted by fast protein liquid chromatography using a Superdex 75 HR10/30 column (Pharmacia Biotech) for gel filtration, and a Bio-Scale Q20 column (Bio-Rad, Ivry-Sur-Seine, France) for anion-exchange. Purity of apoC-III1 and C-III2 preparations was verified by isoelectric focusing on PhastGel IEF polyacrylamide gels (Pharmacia Biotech) using a broad separation range of pI 3–10 expanded at the 3–6 end. Image analysis of these gels stained with Coomassie Blue showed the purity of the apoC-III1 and C-III2 preparations to be >96%. ApoC-II was purified from human plasma as described (32Jackson R.L. Holdsworth G. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 288-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and stored at concentrations >1 mg/ml at −80 °C until the day of use. Purified apoC-III2 was desialylated using a method modified from Morell et al. (33Morell A.G. van den Hamer C.J.A. Scheinberg I.H. Ashwell G. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 3745-3749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, apoC-III2 was incubated at 37 °C for 16 h in a shaking water bath with 2 units/mg neuraminidase in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 0.1% (w/v) CaCl2 and 0.01 volume of protease inhibitor mixture. The buffer of this mixture was then exchanged for 10 mm Tris containing 2 mm EDTA, pH 8, using a Fast Desalting HR 10/10 column (Pharmacia Biotech), prior to reisolation of the apoC-III by anion exchange employing a Mono Q PC 1.6/5 SMART column (Pharmacia Biotech) using a gradient of 0–250 mm NaCl. Purity of the recovered desialylated apoC-III was verified by isoelectric focusing on PhastGel IEF polyacrylamide gels. Chylomicrons, VLDL, and LDL were radioiodinated by Bilheimer's modification of McFarlane's method (34Bilheimer D.W. Eisenberg S. Levy R.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 260: 212-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (1185) Google Scholar), as described previously (35Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar). 125I-Labeled lipoproteins were used within 2 days of preparation, and125I-LDL was filtered (0.2 μm filter, Gelman, Ann Arbor, MI) immediately prior to use. Specific activities of125I-labeled lipoproteins preparations ranged between 102 and 192 cpm/ng protein. In experiments designed to determine the precise amount of the different apoC-III isoforms associated with TGRL, apoC-III preparations were iodinated using IODO-BEADS (Pierce, Asnieres, France) according to manufacturer's instructions, and used within 1 week of preparation. Primary cultures of rat hepatocytes were prepared as described previously (28Mann C.J. Khallou J. Chevreuil O. Troussard A.A. Guermani L.M. Launay K. Delplanque B. Yen F.T. Bihain B.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 35: 10421-10431Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and used 48 h after plating in 36-mm dishes. The cells were preincubated at 37 °C for 30 min in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.2% (w/v) BSA, 5 mm Hepes, 2 mm CaCl2, and 10 ng/ml recombinant mouse leptin, 2Results to be reported elsewhere show that recombinant mouse leptin at physiological concentrations (10–20 ng/ml) increase activity of LSR in primary cultures of rat hepatocytes, and is currently used as a supplement in the incubation media (A. A. Troussard, F. T. Yen, and B. E. Bihain). pH 7.5, followed by incubation at 37 °C for 4 h with 20 μg/ml125I-VLDL supplemented or not with apoC-III (see below) in the same media. After which, the cells were washed and the amounts of125I-lipoprotein bound, internalized, and degraded were determined as previously reported (23Bihain B.E. Yen F.T. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4628-4636Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Plasma membranes were prepared from livers of fasted rats as described (28Mann C.J. Khallou J. Chevreuil O. Troussard A.A. Guermani L.M. Launay K. Delplanque B. Yen F.T. Bihain B.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 35: 10421-10431Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 36Bartles J.R. Hubbard A.L. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 191: 825-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), stored in the dark at 4 °C under N2 in the presence of the inhibitor mixture, and used within 7 days of their preparation. Chylomicrons, VLDL, or LDL (0.15 mg protein) and apoC-II or C-III (0.15 mg) were mixed and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 2 mm EDTA and 3 mm sodium azide (buffer A) in a volume not exceeding 500 μl. After cooling for 2 min on ice, the sample was applied to a 50 mm × 10-mm gel filtration column containing Sepharose CL-4B (Pharmacia Biotech) pre-equilibrated in buffer A. The sample was eluted at a flow rate of 500 μl/min, and collected in 250-μl fractions. Measurements of the 125I radioactivity and absorbance at 280 μm were used to separate the lipoprotein-bound from the free apoC fractions. All lipoprotein fractions were collected onto ice within 3–7 min, and used immediately. No difference between the125I to TG ratio of VLDL were found before and after such treatment, indicating that incubation with the apoC peptides did not cause major losses of radiolabeled endogenous apoproteins. Samples were also applied on 4–25% SDS gradient polyacrylamide gels, which were then stained with Coomassie Blue. Analysis of these gels showed that the gel filtration step did not modify the TGRL apolipoprotein profile. It must be emphasized, however, that the gel filtration step is critical to observe the specificities regarding both: 1) the type of ligand affected, i.e. the lack of effect of apoC-III on LDL binding to LSR, and 2) the type of C apoprotein, i.e. the lack of effect of apoC-II on the binding of TGRL to LSR. Indeed, when the gel filtration chromatography step was omitted prior to testing, all apoC fractions inhibited LDL binding to the LSR. We speculate that this inhibitory effect proceeds through mechanisms distinct from those responsible for the apoC-III specific inhibition of TGRL binding to LSR, and most probably involves the apoC's that are free in solution. LSR activity was measured under conditions that maximally activated the receptor (28Mann C.J. Khallou J. Chevreuil O. Troussard A.A. Guermani L.M. Launay K. Delplanque B. Yen F.T. Bihain B.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 35: 10421-10431Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). All buffers were prepared without Ca2+, and were supplemented with 2 mmEDTA, to suppress the activities of the LDL receptor (37Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Anderson R.G.W. Brindley B.R. Porter K.R. International Cell Biology 1976–1977. Rockefeller University Press, New York1977: 639-642Google Scholar) and the LRP (38Herz J. Hamann U. Rogne S. Myklebost O. Gausepohl H. Stanley K.K. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 4119-4127Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). Briefly, aliquots of membranes (100 μg of protein/tube) were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in the absence or presence of 1000 μm oleate adjusted to a final volume of 250 μl with 0.1m phosphate buffer containing 350 mm NaCl and 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0 (buffer B). The membranes were then washed by 3 series of centrifugation (35,000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C) and resuspension into 250 μl of buffer B by brief sonication (power 1.0, 90% pulse, 5 s); at the final wash, the membrane pellets were resuspended in 150 μl of buffer B. After this, the membranes were incubated at 4 °C for 60 min with the different preparations of apoC-supplemented lipoproteins in a final volume of 250 μl. Membrane-bound 125I-lipoproteins were separated from unbound 125I-lipoproteins by layering a 200-μl aliquot over a 600-μl cushion of 5% (w/v) BSA in buffer B, and centrifuging (35,000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C). After careful aspiration of the supernatants, the bottoms of the tubes containing the membrane pellets were cut and counted in a γ-counter (Pharmacia 1470 Wizard). The need to thoroughly wash the FFA not bound to the membrane prior to adding the 125I-lipoprotein to the media must be emphasized. Indeed, relatively high concentrations of FFA cause the precipitation of protein when subjected to centrifugation. This leads to a significant increase in the nonspecific binding. Protein contents of lipoproteins and membranes were measured by Markwell's modification of Lowry's procedure (39Markwell M.A.K. Haas S.M. Tolbert N.E. Bieber L.L. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 72: 296-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar), using BSA as standard. TG concentrations were determined using an enzymatic kit (Boehringer Mannheim, Meylan, France). We first tested the effect of apoC-III on the binding to LSR of the different lipoprotein fractions that had previously been identified as potential ligands for this candidate receptor (23Bihain B.E. Yen F.T. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4628-4636Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 24Yen F.T. Mann C.J. Guermani L.M. Hannouche N.F. Hubert N. Hornick C.A. Bordeau V.N. Agnani G. Bihain B.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1172-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled chylomicrons, VLDL, or LDL were supplemented with synthetic apoC-III, and then separated by gel filtration chromatography to remove unbound apoprotein. Fig. 1 shows that both chylomicrons and VLDL, but not LDL, supplemented with apoC-III (open squares) displayed, in the presence of oleate, a decreased binding to rat liver plasma membranes when compared with those not supplemented with apoC-III (Fig. 1, closed squares). In membranes incubated without oleate, the binding of chylomicrons, VLDL, and LDL was less than 10% of that measured in the presence of oleate. ApoC-III had no detectable inhibitory effect on this nonspecific binding (closed versus open circles). Due to the dilution effect caused by passing the apoC-III supplemented lipoprotein through gel filtration columns, the concentrations of lipoproteins used in these experiments did not exceed 20 μg/ml, a level well below that required to achieve saturation of the receptor (28Mann C.J. Khallou J. Chevreuil O. Troussard A.A. Guermani L.M. Launay K. Delplanque B. Yen F.T. Bihain B.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 35: 10421-10431Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Therefore, data of Fig. 1 differ from the typical saturation curves previously reported for the binding of these lipoproteins to LSR (28Mann C.J. Khallou J. Chevreuil O. Troussard A.A. Guermani L.M. Launay K. Delplanque B. Yen F.T. Bihain B.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 35: 10421-10431Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We chose not to test at concentrations greater than 20 μg/ml since this would require the addition of a concentration step which would have altered the apoprotein profile of the apoC-III-supplemented TGRL. We next sought to determine the amount of apoC-III that bound to TGRL or LDL under these experimental conditions. Unlabeled VLDL or LDL were supplemented with 125I-apoC-III exactly as described for the experiments shown in Fig. 1. After this, 125I-apoC-III bound to lipoprotein was separated from free 125I-apoC-III by gel filtration chromatography. Under these conditions, a maximum of 10% of added 125I-apoC-III associated with VLDL, while 90% remained in solution. In contrast, only 0.3% of125I-apoC-III was associated with LDL, while >99% remained unbound (data not"

In this study, we have identified hepsin, a type II transmembrane serine protease, in early mouse blastocysts. Mouse hepsin was highly homologous to the previously identified human and rat cDNAs. Two isoforms, differing in their cytoplasmic domains, were detected. The tissue distribution of mouse hepsin was similar to that seen in humans, with prominent expression in liver and kidney. In mouse embryos, hepsin expression was observed in the two-cell stage, reached a maximal level at the early blastocyst stage, and decreased subsequent to blastocyst hatching. Expression of a soluble form of hepsin revealed its ability to autoactivate in a concentration-dependent manner. Catalytically inactive soluble hepsin was unable to autoactivate. These results suggest that hepsin may be the first serine protease expressed during mammalian development, making its ability to autoactivate critical to its function.

These results suggest that hepsin may be the first serine protease expressed during mammalian development, making its ability to autoactivate critical to its function. Embryonic development is marked by a series of cellular divisions and morphogenetic changes (1McLaren A. Reproduction in Mammals. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, MA1982Google Scholar). These processes are mediated by the complex expression and interplay of different sets of genes, some of which are derived from maternally expressed genes stored as mRNAs in the oocytes. It is generally accepted that zygotic gene expression begins at the embryonic two-cell stage (2Nothias J.Y. Majumder S. Keneko K.J. DePamphilis M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22077-22080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). These newly expressed zygotic genes complement the maternally expressed genes to mediate early preimplantation development. Numerous studies have suggested the involvement of a variety of proteases during development. Members of the astacin family of metalloproteases are involved in hatching in both invertebrates and vertebrates (3Hishida R. Ishihara T. Kondo K. Katsura I.

Wang E.A. Science. 1988; 242: 1528-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (3324) Google Scholar), and this association is essential for normal development, perhaps to activate latent transforming growth factor-β complexes. In addition, BMP-1 has been shown to be the procollagen C-endopeptidase (EC 3.4.24.19) required for the processing of type I, II, and III procollagen to fibrillar collagens to yield the major fibrous components of vertebrate extracellular matrix (11Kessler E.

Recently, new members of the adamalysin/reprolysin metalloprotease have been described and were shown to have a direct role in a number of developmental processes. Fertilin-α and -β, the first members of this family, have been shown to have essential roles in sperm-egg fusion during fertilization (13Wolfsberg T.G. Bazan J.F. Blobel C.P. Myles D.G. Primakoff P.

The recent discovery of meltrin-α, a fertilin-related member of the adamalysin/reprolysin metalloproteases important for myoblast fusion during skeletal muscle development, suggests that there may be a common mechanism in gamete and myoblast fusion (16Huovila A.P.J. Almeida E.A. White J.M. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1996; 8: 692-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Astacin-like proteases of the Tolloid/BMP-1 family play important roles in cell differentiation and morphogenesis in animal embryos ranging from the hydra and sea urchins to mammals (17Bond J.S. Beynon R.J. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1247-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar).Serine proteases have also been implicated in development, which is exemplified by genetic studies of the products of theDrosophila gene stubble-stubbloid, which is essential for epithelial morphogenesis of imaginal discs ofDrosophila (18Appel L.F. Prout M. Abu-Shumays R. Hammonds A. Garbe J.C. Fristrom D. Fristrom J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4937-4941Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Mutations in this gene affects imaginal disc formation and affect the organization of microfilament bundles, leading up to defects in bristle, leg, and wing morphogenesis. Also inDrosophila, the maternally transcribed product of theeaster gene, a trypsin-like serine protease, is essential for the establishment of a normal dorsal-ventral pattern in the embryos (19Chasan R. Anderson K.V. Cell. 1989; 56: 391-400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Of note, perturbing quantitatively the level of Easter protease activity in Drosophila as a result of dominant mutations can disrupt the dorsal-ventral axis, leading to ventralizing and lateralizing phenotypes (20Jin Y. Anderson K.V. Cell. 1990; 60: 873-881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The Drosophila trypsin-like enzymes easter and snake are part of a cascade of zymogen activation leading up to the conversion of the ligand-precursor, spatzle to its active form (21Stein D. Nusslein-Volhard C. Cell. 1992; 68: 429-440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 22Schneider D.S. Jin Y. Morisato D. Anderson K.V. Development. 1994; 120: 1243-1250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Smith C.L. DeLotto R. Nature. 1994; 368: 548-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Active spatzle then activates its receptor Toll to affect specification of dorsal and lateral cell fates (24Morisato D. Anderson K.V. Cell. 1994; 76: 677-688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 25Morisato D. Anderson K.V. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1995; 29: 371-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar).While evidence exists that one or more serine proteases exist in mammalian preimplantation embryos, the identity of these enzymes has remained elusive. One of the earliest events in embryogenesis thought to require a protease is blastocyst hatching. This involves the proteolysis of the zona pellucida, an event critical for subsequent uterine implantation of the embryo. Studies have suggested that a single, membrane-associated serine protease is expressed by hatching blastocysts (26Perona R.M. Wassarman P.M. Dev. Biol. 1986; 114: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In this study, we identify hepsin, a serine protease containing a transmembrane domain, as a serine protease expressed by mouse embryos at the two-cell stage through the early blastocyst stage. In addition, we demonstrate that a soluble form of hepsin lacking the transmembrane domain undergoes autoactivation, suggesting a mechanism by which hepsin becomes proteolytically activated in the absence of other proteases.DISCUSSIONWe have identified hepsin, a membrane-bound serine protease previously shown to activate fVII (35Kazama Y. Hamamoto T. Foster D.C. Kisiel W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 66-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), in preimplantation mouse embryos as early as the two-cell stage. Based on evidence that a single serine protease is present in preimplantation embryos (26Perona R.M. Wassarman P.M. Dev. Biol. 1986; 114: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), it is possible that hepsin represents the first such protease expressed during development. Prior in vitro experimentation implicated hepsin in the maintenance of cellular morphology and hepatoma cell growth (36Torres-Rosado A. O'Shea K.S. Tsuji A. Chou S.-H. Kurachi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7181-7185Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and in blood coagulation by human factor VII activation (35Kazama Y. Hamamoto T. Foster D.C. Kisiel W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 66-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Increased hepsin expression has also been associated with ovarian cancer (37Tanimoto H. Yan Y. Clarke J. Korourian S. Shigemasa K. Parmley T.H. Parham G.P. O'Brien T.J. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2884-2887PubMed Google Scholar). No developmental functions of hepsin have been described. Whether hepsin plays a critical role in early development is not clear, but it is possible that it plays a role in blastocyst hatching.The hepsin amino acid sequence suggests it is a type II transmembrane serine protease zymogen with an extracellular carboxyl-terminal catalytic domain. The internal signal sequence, serving as a transmembrane domain, is surprisingly conserved. The presence of this transmembrane domain is consistent with Perona and Wassarman's (26Perona R.M. Wassarman P.M. Dev. Biol. 1986; 114: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) data suggesting that the putative mouse hatching enzyme, which would be expressed in early preimplantation embryos, is membrane-bound. The trypsin-specificity conferring Asp346 that lines the S1 subsite and composes part of the specificity pocket is present and conserved, indicating that hepsin is likely to have trypsin-like specificity. Indeed, our activity assay of the recombinant soluble hepsin using a number of chromogenic substrates have confirmed this observation. The reason for the presence of two forms of hepsin, differing in the cytoplasmic domain, is not clear. The inserted sequence in the 1.9-kb form of hepsin has no homology to any domains found in signal transducing proteins. It is unlikely that changes to the cytoplasmic domain alter hepsin's proteolytic properties, particularly since the soluble form of the enzyme is apparently fully functional. Whether the 1.8- and 1.9-kb hepsin mRNAs are the result of two different genes or, more likely, the result of alternative splicing of a single gene transcript remains to be defined.Since hepsin is likely to be expressed as a zymogen based on the predicted amino acid sequence, and appears to be the only serine protease present during blastocyst hatching, the question arises, what is the mechanism of its activation? Our hypothesis is that density-dependent autoactivation occurs, as suggested by data from our soluble hepsin expression study. We noted that during purification, upon elution with EDTA, soluble hepsin was spontaneously converted to the active, disulfide-linked two-chain form probably via cleavage of the Arg161-Ile162bond. The conversion was clearly concentration dependent (activation was only seen in the eluate and not in the diluted conditioned medium) and required hepsin's inherent enzymatic activity since it was not observed with a catalytically inactive S352A mutant soluble hepsin. These data indicate that hepsin was capable of concentration-dependent autoactivation. Since hepsin is membrane-bound via a transmembrane domain, its density and lateral diffusion on the trophoblast surface may play an important role in achieving the concentration needed for autoactivation (Fig.8). This mode of autoactivation resembles fVII cell surface autoactivation, which utilizes distinct tissue factor molecules to localize both the fVII and fVIIa to the cell surface, forming two separate membrane-bound binary complexes. The complex with the active fVIIa then activates the adjacent tissue factor-anchoring fVII, obeying obligatory two-dimensional enzyme kinetics (38Neuenschwander P.F. Fiore M.M. Morrissey J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21489-21492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hepsin autoactivation is likely to follow similar kinetics, but further studies are necessary to elucidate its mechanism of cell surface autoactivation. Interestingly the recent purification of intact hepsin from rat liver microsomes also resulted in its activation (39Zhukov A. Hellman U. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1337: 85-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), but it was not clear if this was the result of autoactivation or of the action of another protease. Our data with the inactive hepsin mutant suggest that membrane-bound hepsin is capable of autoactivation.The autoactivation of soluble hepsin additionally generated a second form of the enzyme. A band of 29 kDa, which was absent in the S352A mutant, along with the intact 43 kDa, were both present when the eluate was analyzed on nonreducing SDS-PAGE and Western blot experiments. This 29-kDa form was likely to be the result of proteolytic modification of the light chain of the active two-chain form since only the intact catalytic heavy chain was seen under reducing conditions. The presence of this 29-kDa form suggests that membrane-bound hepsin can be cleaved off the trophoblast surfaces of embryos (Fig. 8). Interestingly, Sawadaet al. (40Sawada H. Yamazaki K. Hoshi M. J. Exp. Zool. 1990; 253: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) have demonstrated the presence of a soluble trypsin-like activity in blastocyst culture medium and that this activity represented that of a hatching enzyme. Whether this secreted trypsin-like activity and the 29-kDa form of hepsin are one and the same, and what roles it may play during embryogenesis, remain to be determined. Embryonic development is marked by a series of cellular divisions and morphogenetic changes (1McLaren A. Reproduction in Mammals. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, MA1982Google Scholar). These processes are mediated by the complex expression and interplay of different sets of genes, some of which are derived from maternally expressed genes stored as mRNAs in the oocytes.

Our data with the inactive hepsin mutant suggest that membrane-bound hepsin is capable of autoactivation.The autoactivation of soluble hepsin additionally generated a second form of the enzyme. A band of 29 kDa, which was absent in the S352A mutant, along with the intact 43 kDa, were both present when the eluate was analyzed on nonreducing SDS-PAGE and Western blot experiments. This 29-kDa form was likely to be the result of proteolytic modification of the light chain of the active two-chain form since only the intact catalytic heavy chain was seen under reducing conditions. The presence of this 29-kDa form suggests that membrane-bound hepsin can be cleaved off the trophoblast surfaces of embryos (Fig. 8). Interestingly, Sawadaet al. (40Sawada H. Yamazaki K. Hoshi M. J. Exp. Zool. 1990; 253: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) have demonstrated the presence of a soluble trypsin-like activity in blastocyst culture medium and that this activity represented that of a hatching enzyme. Whether this secreted trypsin-like activity and the 29-kDa form of hepsin are one and the same, and what roles it may play during embryogenesis, remain to be determined. We have identified hepsin, a membrane-bound serine protease previously shown to activate fVII (35Kazama Y. Hamamoto T. Foster D.C. Kisiel W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 66-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), in preimplantation mouse embryos as early as the two-cell stage. Based on evidence that a single serine protease is present in preimplantation embryos (26Perona R.M. Wassarman P.M. Dev. Biol. 1986; 114: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), it is possible that hepsin represents the first such protease expressed during development. Prior in vitro experimentation implicated hepsin in the maintenance of cellular morphology and hepatoma cell growth (36Torres-Rosado A. O'Shea K.S. Tsuji A. Chou S.-H. Kurachi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7181-7185Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and in blood coagulation by human factor VII activation (35Kazama Y. Hamamoto T. Foster D.C. Kisiel W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 66-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Increased hepsin expression has also been associated with ovarian cancer (37Tanimoto H. Yan Y. Clarke J. Korourian S. Shigemasa K. Parmley T.H. Parham G.P. O'Brien T.J. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2884-2887PubMed Google Scholar). No developmental functions of hepsin have been described. Whether hepsin plays a critical role in early development is not clear, but it is possible that it plays a role in blastocyst hatching. The hepsin amino acid sequence suggests it is a type II transmembrane serine protease zymogen with an extracellular carboxyl-terminal catalytic domain. The internal signal sequence, serving as a transmembrane domain, is surprisingly conserved. The presence of this transmembrane domain is consistent with Perona and Wassarman's (26Perona R.M. Wassarman P.M. Dev. Biol. 1986; 114: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) data suggesting that the putative mouse hatching enzyme, which would be expressed in early preimplantation embryos, is membrane-bound. The trypsin-specificity conferring Asp346 that lines the S1 subsite and composes part of the specificity pocket is present and conserved, indicating that hepsin is likely to have trypsin-like specificity. Indeed, our activity assay of the recombinant soluble hepsin using a number of chromogenic substrates have confirmed this observation. The reason for the presence of two forms of hepsin, differing in the cytoplasmic domain, is not clear. The inserted sequence in the 1.9-kb form of hepsin has no homology to any domains found in signal transducing proteins. It is unlikely that changes to the cytoplasmic domain alter hepsin's proteolytic properties, particularly since the soluble form of the enzyme is apparently fully functional. Whether the 1.8- and 1.9-kb hepsin mRNAs are the result of two different genes or, more likely, the result of alternative splicing of a single gene transcript remains to be defined. Since hepsin is likely to be expressed as a zymogen based on the predicted amino acid sequence, and appears to be the only serine protease present during blastocyst hatching, the question arises, what is the mechanism of its activation? Our hypothesis is that density-dependent autoactivation occurs, as suggested by data from our soluble hepsin expression study. We noted that during purification, upon elution with EDTA, soluble hepsin was spontaneously converted to the active, disulfide-linked two-chain form probably via cleavage of the Arg161-Ile162bond. The conversion was clearly concentration dependent (activation was only seen in the eluate and not in the diluted conditioned medium) and required hepsin's inherent enzymatic activity since it was not observed with a catalytically inactive S352A mutant soluble hepsin. These data indicate that hepsin was capable of concentration-dependent autoactivation. Since hepsin is membrane-bound via a transmembrane domain, its density and lateral diffusion on the trophoblast surface may play an important role in achieving the concentration needed for autoactivation (Fig.8). This mode of autoactivation resembles fVII cell surface autoactivation, which utilizes distinct tissue factor molecules to localize both the fVII and fVIIa to the cell surface, forming two separate membrane-bound binary complexes. The complex with the active fVIIa then activates the adjacent tissue factor-anchoring fVII, obeying obligatory two-dimensional enzyme kinetics (38Neuenschwander P.F. Fiore M.M. Morrissey J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21489-21492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hepsin autoactivation is likely to follow similar kinetics, but further studies are necessary to elucidate its mechanism of cell surface autoactivation. Interestingly the recent purification of intact hepsin from rat liver microsomes also resulted in its activation (39Zhukov A. Hellman U. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1337: 85-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), but it was not clear if this was the result of autoactivation or of the action of another protease. Our data with the inactive hepsin mutant suggest that membrane-bound hepsin is capable of autoactivation. The autoactivation of soluble hepsin additionally generated a second form of the enzyme. A band of 29 kDa, which was absent in the S352A mutant, along with the intact 43 kDa, were both present when the eluate was analyzed on nonreducing SDS-PAGE and Western blot experiments. This 29-kDa form was likely to be the result of proteolytic modification of the light chain of the active two-chain form since only the intact catalytic heavy chain was seen under reducing conditions. The presence of this 29-kDa form suggests that membrane-bound hepsin can be cleaved off the trophoblast surfaces of embryos (Fig. 8). Interestingly, Sawadaet al. (40Sawada H. Yamazaki K. Hoshi M. J.

Whether this secreted trypsin-like activity and the 29-kDa form of hepsin are one and the same, and what roles it may play during embryogenesis, remain to be determined.

https://openalex.org/W2086246370,"We previously demonstrated that the anticancer agent and protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor 7-hydroxystaurosporine (UCN-01) induces apoptosis independently of p53 and protein synthesis in HL60 cells. We now report the associated changes of PKC isoforms. PKCα, βI, βII, δ, and ζ activities were measured after immunoprecipitation of cytosols from UCN-01-treated HL60 cells. UCN-01 had no effect on PKCζ and inhibited kinase activity of PKCβI, βII, and δ. PKCα activity was initially inhibited at 1 h, and subsequently increased as cells underwent apoptosis 3 h after the beginning of UCN-01 treatment. Camptothecin (CPT) and etoposide (VP-16) also markedly enhanced PKCα activity during apoptosis in HL60 cells. However, CPT did not affect PKCβI, βII and ζ, and activated PKCδ. PKCα activation was not due to increased protein levels or proteolytic cleavage but was associated with PKCα autophosphorylation in vitro and increased phosphorylationin vivo. We also found that not only PKC δ but also PKC βI was proteolytically activated in HL60 cells during apoptosis. The PKCα activation and hyperphosphorylation were abrogated byN-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp(O-methyl)-fluoromethylketone (z-VAD-fmk) under conditions that abrogated apoptosis. z-VAD-fmk also prevented PKCδ and βI proteolytic activation. Together these findings suggest that caspases regulate PKC activity during apoptosis in HL60 cells. At least two modes of activation were observed: hyperphosphorylation for PKCα and proteolytic activation for PKC δ and βI.

Sarre T.F. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 329-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar). The biochemical mechanisms underlying PKC action have become increasingly clear (1Hug H. Sarre T.F. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 329-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar, 2Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2357) Google Scholar, 3Newton A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). PKC isoforms have been categorized in three subclasses: conventional PKCs (cPKCs) (α, βI, βII, and γ) which require phosphotidylserine (PS), diacylglycerol (DAG); and Ca2+; novel PKCs (nPKCs) (δ, ε, η, and θ) which require PS and DAG but not Ca2+, and the atypical PKCs (aPKCs) (ζ, ι, and λ) (3Newton A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). Several observations suggest the implication of PKC in apoptosis. For example, it has been observed that the activation of PKC by exposure to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) either alone or in conjunction with Ca2+ ionophore induces apoptosis in lymphoid (4Mercep M. Noguchi P.D. Ashwell J.D. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 4085-4092PubMed Google Scholar, 5Ojeda F. Guarda M.I. Maldonado C. Folch H. Cell.

PMA suppresses steroid-induced apoptosis in thymic lymphocytes (8McConkey D.J. Hartzell P. Jondal M. Orrenius S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13399-13402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and opposes topoisomerase-induced apoptosis in HL60 cells as these cells differentiate (7Solary E. Bertrand R. Kohn K.W. Pommier Y. Blood. 1993; 81: 1359-1368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several PKC inhibitors have been reported to induce apoptosis. Staurosporine is one of the most potent and universal inducers of apoptosis in a variety of cell lines (9Bertrand R. Solary E. Kohn K.W. O'Connor P. Pommier Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 211: 314-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Its 7-hydroxy derivative, UCN-01, which is a more specific PKC inhibitor (10Seynaeve C.M. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Sausville E.A. Worland P.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 1207-1214PubMed Google Scholar) and an effective antitumor agent (11Akinaga S. Nomura K. Gomi K. Okabe M. Cancer Chemother.

Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 4888-4892PubMed Google Scholar), also induces apoptosis in T lymphoblasts (13Wang Q. Worland P.J. Clark J.L. Carlson B.A. Sausville E.A. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 927-936PubMed Google Scholar), K562, HT29 cells, and HL60 cells independently of p53 (14Shao R.-G. Shimizu T. Pommier Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 234: 388-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). UCN-01-induced apoptosis in HL60 and K562 cells is independent of protein synthesis (14Shao R.-G. Shimizu T. Pommier Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 234: 388-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Calphostin C induces apoptosis in four human glioma cell lines (GB-1, T98G, U-373MG, and A-172) (15Ikemoto H. Tani E. Matsumoto T. Nakano A. Furuyama J. J. Neurosurg. 1995; 83: 1008-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and HL60 cells (16Jarvis W.D. Turner A.J. Povirk L.F. Traylor R.S. Grant S. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 1707-1714PubMed Google Scholar). Additional evidence for PKC activation during apoptosis is that ceramide activates PKCζ and down-regulates PKCα during apoptosis (17Lee J.Y.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6148-6156Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar) reported proteolytic activation of PKCδ during apoptosis induced by DNA damaging agents (ionizing radiation, camptothecin (CPT) and 1-[β-d-arabinofuranosyl]cytosine (ara-C)) in human myeloid leukemia U937 cells (21Emoto Y. Kisaki H. Manome Y. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. Blood. 1996; 87: 1990-1996Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we investigated PKC isoform activities during UCN-01-induced apoptosis in human myeloid leukemia HL60 cells. HL60 cells were chosen for these studies because they undergo rapid apoptosis to various agents including UCN-01. This apoptosis is p53-independent as HL60 cells are p53 null (22Wolf D. Rotter V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 790-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar) and does not require protein synthesis (14Shao R.-G. Shimizu T. Pommier Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 234: 388-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 23Shao R.G. Shimizu T. Pommier Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 227: 190-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). It is preceded by transient activation of cyclin B1/Cdc2 kinase (14Shao R.-G. Shimizu T. Pommier Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 234: 388-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 24Shimizu T. O'Connor P.M. Kohn K.W. Pommier Y. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 228-231PubMed Google Scholar). The changes of PKC activity were also examined in HL60 cells undergoing apoptosis after treatment with the topoisomerase inhibitors, CPT and etoposide (VP-16). We found that UCN-01 inhibited PKCβI, βII, and δ activity in drug-treated cells as well as in vitro. For PKCα, UCN-01 first inhibited the kinase activity and then activated PKCα. CPT-induced apoptosis was associated with marked increase in PKCα and δ activities. The mechanisms of PKC activation and their relationship to caspases (ICE-like proteases) are investigated. UCN-01 was provided by Dr. H. Nakano (Kyowa Hakko Co., Japan) or the Drug Synthesis and Chemistry Branch, NCI, National Institutes of Health. CPT was provided by Dr. M. R. Wall (Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC) or the Drug Synthesis and Chemistry Branch, NCI, National Institutes of Health.N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp(O-methyl)-fluoromethylketone (z-VAD-fmk) was purchased from Enzyme System Products (Dublin, CA). Other drugs and reagents, unless otherwise mentioned, were purchased from Sigma. Anti-PKC antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-rabbit Ig horseradish peroxidase antibody was purchased from Amersham Life Science, Inc. (Arlington Heights, IL). [14-C]thymidine (53.6 mCi/mmol), [γ-32P]ATP (4500 Ci/mmol), and [32P]orthophosphate were purchased from NEN Life Science Products (Boston, MA). Protein A-Sepharose 4B was from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. (Sweden). P-81 ion exchange filter paper was obtained from Whatman. Human promyelocytic leukemia HL60 cells were grown at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD), 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cytosols from untreated control and treated HL60 cells were extracted using nucleus buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm KH2PO4, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm p-aminoethylbenzenesulfonylfluoride, 0.15 units/ml aprotinin, 1.0 mm Na3VO4, 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 10% glycerol, and 0.3% Triton X-100) as described previously (25Bertrand R. Kohn K.W. Solary E. Pommier Y. Drug Dev. Res. 1995; 34: 138-144Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was measured using a protein assay kit according to the manufacturer instructions (Bio-Rad). Cytosols (50 μl) from control or treated (1 × 106) HL60 cells were mixed with 50 μl of 2 × reaction buffer containing 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 5 mm MgCl2, 10 μm ATP, 40 μg/ml phosphatidylserine, 3.3 μm dioleoylglycerol, 1.2 mmCaCl2, 25 μm MBP4–14, 2 μCi [γ-32P]ATP. After incubation for 7 min at 30 °C, the transfer of [32P]phosphate was quantified by the phosphocellulose paper-binding method (26Yasuda I. Kishimoto A. Tanaka S. Tominaga M. Sakurai A. Nishizuka Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 166: 1220-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). 350-μl cytosols from control or treated (2 × 107) HL60 cells were precleared with 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose for 1 h and incubated with anti-PKC antibodies and 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose at 4 °C for 4 h. The beads were washed three times with nucleus buffer. This was followed by 2 washes with kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mm NaF, 1 mmNa3VO4, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm EDTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Immunocomplex beads were obtained by incubating different anti-PKC antibodies with cytosolic extracts in 20 μl of reaction buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 μm cold ATP, 0.4 mg/ml histone H1, 40 μg/ml PS, 3.3 μm dioleoylglycerol, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in the absence or presence of 1.2 mm CaCl2 depending on the PKC isoform activity measured. Incubations were carried out at 30 °C for 10 min. Samples were loaded onto 12% SDS-PAGE gels (NOVEX, San Diego, CA) and electrophoresed at 120 V for 2 h. For quantification of kinase activity in immunoprecipitates, gels were dried, and the extent of histone H1 phosphorylation was measured using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Cytosolic samples were electrophoresed at 120 V on 12% SDS-PAGE gels and electrophoretically transferred to Immobilon membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA) for 2 h at 30 V. The membranes were blocked overnight in phosphate-buffered saline-Tween 20 (PBS-T) containing 5% non-fat dried milk. Probing with selected anti-PKC antibodies (1 μg/ml in PBS-T) for 1 h was followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (1:1000 dilution). After washing in PBS-T, membranes were developed using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (NEN Life Science Products). HL60 cells were spun and resuspended at 106 cells/ml in phosphate-free RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum once. After 1 h, 50 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate was added to cell cultures for 1 h. Then cells were chased in isotope-free medium for 1 h prior to UCN-01 treatment. Cytosol extracts were boiled in electrophoresis sample buffer and analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE gels. Gels were dried and autoradiographed at −70 °C. DNA fragmentation related to apoptosis was measured by filter elution assay as described previously (8McConkey D.J. Hartzell P. Jondal M. Orrenius S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13399-13402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Bertrand R. Kohn K.W. Solary E. Pommier Y. Drug Dev. Res. 1995; 34: 138-144Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Our previous studies indicated that UCN-01 and CPT are potent inducers of apoptosis in HL60 cells (14Shao R.-G. Shimizu T. Pommier Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 234: 388-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 27Shimizu T. Pommier Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 226: 292-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). After 3 h of drug treatment, 60–90% of the cells exhibit apoptosis with typical morphological changes and internucleosomal fragmentation. To investigate whether PKC was involved in apoptosis induced by these anticancer drugs, we treated HL60 cells with UCN-01 or CPT and extracted cytosol and membrane fractions at various times. The synthetic peptide, MBP4–14, was used as a specific and sensitive substrate to assay PKC activity (26Yasuda I. Kishimoto A. Tanaka S. Tominaga M. Sakurai A. Nishizuka Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 166: 1220-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). We found that phosphorylation of MBP4–14 first decreased during the first hour of UCN-01 treatment compared with control and then increased progressively above control values 3 h after the beginning of treatment. CPT increased the phosphorylation of MBP4–14 already after 1 h of treatment (Fig.1). These measurements were performed in cytosolic fractions. In membrane fractions, there was no significant difference between basal and stimulated levels of MBP4–14 phosphorylation and no change of MBP4–14 phosphorylation after exposure to UCN-01 or CPT for 3 h (not shown). These data indicate that PKC activity is induced by UCN-01 and CPT treatment in HL60 cells undergoing apoptosis. The above data raised the question as to what kinds of PKC isoforms were activated by UCN-01 or CPT. MBP4–14 is selective for PKCα, βI, βII, and δ isoforms but has been reported to be a poor substrate for other isoforms (26Yasuda I. Kishimoto A. Tanaka S. Tominaga M. Sakurai A. Nishizuka Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 166: 1220-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). From the work by Seynaeve et al. (10Seynaeve C.M. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Sausville E.A. Worland P.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 1207-1214PubMed Google Scholar), we also know that UCN-01 inhibits PKCα, β, γ, δ, and ε and does not inhibit PKCζ in vitro. Since PKCγ was undetectable in HL60 cells and PKCε was expressed only very weakly using Western blotting (data not shown) (1Hug H. Sarre T.F. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 329-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar), we used anti-PKCα, βI, βII, ζ, and δ antibodies and immunoprecipitation to determine the effects of UCN-01 and CPT on PKC isoform activities. Fig. 2 shows that UCN-01 inhibited all the PKC isoforms tested at 1 h of treatment, which is consistent with the known anti-PKC activity of UCN-01 in vitro (10Seynaeve C.M. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Sausville E.A. Worland P.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 1207-1214PubMed Google Scholar). However, at 3 h, PKCα activity was markedly stimulated (5-fold) by UCN-01. CPT increased PKCα and δ activities but had no effects on PKCβI and βII activities. Neither UCN-01 nor CPT affected PKCζ activity (data not shown). These data indicate that apoptosis induced by UCN-01 and CPT treatment is associated with marked PKCα activation. Caspases (ICE-like proteases) are key mediators of apoptosis (28Enari M. Talaninan R.V. Wong W.W. Nagata S. Nature. 1996; 380: 723-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar, 29Los M. Vand de Craen M. Penning L.C. Schenk H. Westendorp M. Baeuerie P.A. Dröge W.

Cell. 1993; 75: 653-660Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1327) Google Scholar), and we previously showed that the caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk prevents UCN-01-induced apoptosis in HL60 cells (14Shao R.-G. Shimizu T. Pommier Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 234: 388-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Fig.3 A, shows that z-VAD-fmk also prevents apoptotic DNA fragmentation induced by CPT in HL60 cells. However, z-VAD-fmk does not inhibit the DNA fragmentation induced by UCN-01- and CPT-activated cytosol in cell-free system (8McConkey D.J. Hartzell P. Jondal M. Orrenius S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13399-13402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Shao R.-G. Shimizu T. Pommier Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 234: 388-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 25Bertrand R. Kohn K.W. Solary E. Pommier Y. Drug Dev. Res. 1995; 34: 138-144Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar) (Fig.3 B). Under these conditions, we examined whether z-VAD-fmk affected the PKC changes induced by UCN-01 or CPT in HL60 cells undergoing apoptosis. We found that z-VAD-fmk blocked the activation of PKCα induced either by UCN-01 or CPT. However, z-VAD-fmk did not suppress the CPT-induced activation of PKCδ (Fig.4 A) and had no effects on the inhibitions of PKCβI, βII, and δ activities induced by UCN-01 (Fig. 4). We next tested whether PKCα was activated in response to the topoisomerase II inhibitor, VP-16. We found that VP-16 also activated PKCα in HL60 cells undergoing apoptosis (8McConkey D.J. Hartzell P. Jondal M. Orrenius S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13399-13402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig.4 C). These data suggested that apoptosis induced by different pathways (topoisomerase inhibition for CPT or VP-16 or protein kinase inhibition for UCN-01) is associated with PKCα activation in HL60 cells. The observation that z-VAD-fmk blocked PKCα activation suggests that PKCα is downstream from caspases during apoptosis in HL60 cells.Figure 4Effects of UCN-01, CPT, VP-16, and z-VAD-fmk on PKCα activity in HL60 cells. HL60 cells were exposed to either 10 μm UCN-01 or 1 μm CPT in the absence or presence of 50 μm z-VAD-fmk for 3 h (panels A and B). HL60 cells were treated with 50 μm VP-16 for the indicated times (panel C). Cytosol fractions from untreated or treated cells were immunoprecipitated with the indicated anti-PKCβ antibodies (panel A) or anti-PKCα and δ antibodies (panels B and C). PKC activity was measured using histone H1 as substrate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further investigate the mechanisms by which UCN-01 or CPT regulate PKCα activity, we first tested whether UCN-01 or CPT directly affected PKCα activity usingin vitro kinase assays. PKCα immunoprecipitates obtained from control cytosol were tested for kinase activity with UCN-01 or CPT. Fig. 5 A shows that UCN-01 did not activate but rather inhibited PKCα activity directly. CPT had no direct effect on PKCα activity (Fig. 5 A). z-VAD-fmk was also tested in this system and did not exhibit a direct effect on PKCα activation induced by UCN-01 or CPT (Fig. 5 B). These results indicated that the PKC changes observed in cytosols from cells treated with UCN-01 or CPT in the absence or presence of z-VAD-fmk were indirect. We next examined whether the activation of PKCα by UCN-01 or CPT and the effects of z-VAD-fmk might be due to alterations of the PKCα protein. Western blot analyses were carried out on cytosols from untreated, UCN-01- or CPT-treated HL60 cells using anti-PKCα antibody. PKCα protein levels remained unchanged after drug-treatments (Fig. 6 A). Thus, PKCα activation by UCN-01 and CPT was not due to changes in PKCα protein levels. We also measured the other PKC isoforms. Protein levels of PKCβI, βII, and δ did not change significantly (Fig. 6,B-D). Interestingly, UCN-01 and CPT induced PKCβI and δ cleavages when HL60 cells underwent apoptosis, and z-VAD-fmk blocked these proteolytic effects. Proteolytic activation of PKCδ by caspases is consistent with results obtained in U-937 cells (21Emoto Y. Kisaki H. Manome Y. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. Blood. 1996; 87: 1990-1996Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, our data suggest that PKCβI is also cleaved by caspases during apoptosis in HL60 cells. Since neither proteolytic activation nor change in protein levels appear to account for PKCα activation, we next tested the effects of UCN-01 and CPT on the PKCα autophosphorylation. It is indeed known that autophosphorylation is one of the important modes of regulation of PKC activity (31Dutil E.M. Keranen L.M. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29359-29362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Autophosphorylation assays for PKCα were carried out essentially as described for histone H1 phosphorylation except that histone H1 was omitted from the reactions. Fig.7 A shows that treatment of HL60 cells for 3 h with either UCN-01 or CPT increased PKCα autophosphorylation (Fig. 7 A) and that z-VAD-fmk blocked this increased autophosphorylation (Fig. 7 B). Finally, we performed experiments to test in vivo phosphorylation of PKCα in HL60 cells treated with UCN-01. Fig.8 shows that UCN-01 increased PKCα phosphorylation after 1 h of treatment and that z-VAD-fmk inhibited the UCN-01-induced PKCα phosphorylation. These results suggest that caspase activation during apoptosis in HL60 cells is upstream from PKCα autophosphorylation and activation.Figure 8UCN-01-induced apoptosis is associated with PKCα phosphorylation in vivo. HL60 cells were incubated in phosphate-free RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum for 1 h. Fifty μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate was then added for 1 h. Cells were washed once with phosphate-free medium for 1 h and then 10 μm UCN-01 was added. Cytosols were prepared at the indicated times and were immunoprecipitated with anti-PKCα antibody. The beads were boiled in sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis. The gel was dried and exposed to Kodak Rx film at −70 °C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The results of Fig. 1 show that although UCN-01 is a PKC inhibitor and CPT is a topoisomerase I inhibitor, both of them induced activation of PKC. Using immunoprecipitation assay for PKC activities, we found that UCN-01 inhibited PKCβI, βII, and δ activities in whole cells as well as in vitro but that PKCα was activated in HL60 cells undergoing apoptosis. Apoptosis induced by CPT, a DNA topoisomerase I inhibitor was also associated with activation of PKCα as well as PKCδ activation. Caspases play a central role in the apoptosis pathways (28Enari M. Talaninan R.V. Wong W.W. Nagata S. Nature. 1996; 380: 723-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar, 29Los M. Vand de Craen M. Penning L.C. Schenk H. Westendorp M. Baeuerie P.A. Dröge W.

Cell. 1993; 75: 653-660Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1327) Google Scholar). z-VAD-fmk, a cell-permeable caspase inhibitor with broad specificity, blocks apoptosis induced by various stimuli including treatment by UCN-01 or CPT. Our results demonstrate that z-VAD-fmk selectively inhibited the activation of PKCα induced by UCN-01 and CPT. On the other hand, z-VAD-fmk did not affect the inhibition of PKCβI, βII, and δ activities by UCN-01 and the activation of PKCδ by CPT. At the same time, we found that z-VAD-fmk blocked the proteolytic cleavages of PKCβI and PKCδ, suggesting that PKCδ cleavage is not the only mechanism for PKCδ activation. For PKCα, we found no evidence that PKCα activation is associated with proteolytic cleavage. Our data (Fig. 5) rule out that UCN-01, CPT, or z-VAD-fmk directly affected PKCα. PKCα activation is not due to changes in PKCα protein levels since control and cells treated with UCN-01 or CPT in the absence and presence of z-VAD-fmk had approximately equal amounts of PKCα protein as detected by Western blot. Phosphorylation has emerged as an important mode of regulation for PKC (3Newton A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar, 32Keranen L.M. Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1394-1403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). For example, mutation of Thr to Ala in PKCα (Thr-497) results in an inactive kinase (33Cazaubon S. Bornancin F. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), and PKC autophosphorylation has been shown to regulate PKC activity by trans-phosphorylation at the activation loop followed by autophosphorylation (31Dutil E.M. Keranen L.M. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29359-29362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Keranen L.M. Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1394-1403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Our results show that UCN-01 and CPT activated autophosphorylation of PKCα and that z-VAD-fmk reversed such effects. Using [32P]orthophosphate metabolic labeling, we also found increased phosphorylation of PKCα in HL60 cells undergoing apoptosis and blockade of these effects by z-VAD-fmk. These findings suggest that alterations of PKCα phosphorylation might be important for modulating PKCα activity and might be regulated by caspases. The mechanisms (pathways) by which UCN-01 and CPT induce phosphorylation and activation of PKCα are yet unknown. We previously showed that both CPT and UCN-01 induce transient and unscheduled cyclin B1/Cdc2 kinase activation before the onset of apoptosis in HL60 cells treated with CPT or UCN-01 (14Shao R.-G. Shimizu T. Pommier Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 234: 388-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 24Shimizu T. O'Connor P.M. Kohn K.W. Pommier Y. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 228-231PubMed Google Scholar). CPT and DNA damaging agents have also been shown to activate other protein kinases including DNA-dependent protein kinase (34Kharbanda S. Pandey P. Jin S. Inoue S. Bharti A. Yuan Z.M. Weichselbaum R.

Further investigation will be required to establish the connections between activation of various protein kinases and caspases during apoptosis and to establish the functional significance of PKCα activation in the apoptotic response of HL60 cells.

First, we measured the binding of apoA-II to apoA-I-rHDL, containing dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine or palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine, and the degree of apoA-I displacement at various ratios of apolipoproteins. Using fluorescence methods, we determined that apoA-II binding is rapid, irreversible, and associated with apoA-I displacement only when the molar ratio of apoA-II/apoA-I is greater than 1:2. Next, we used the stable apoA-II/apoA-I-rHDL complex at the apoA-II/apoA-I ratio of 1:2 to examine its physical properties, apoA-I structure, and reactivity with lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT). Using chemical cross-linking in conjunction with fluorescence and electrophoretic methods, we demonstrated that the conformation of apoA-I must be flexible to allow apoA-II binding to the apoA-I-rHDL particles and showed that the hybrid particles have an unchanged Stokes diameter. Fluorescence and circular dichroism measurements revealed little or no change in the secondary structure or in the N-terminal domain of apoA-I, but showed a marked destabilization of apoA-I to denaturation by guanidine hydrochloride. Limited tryptic digestion indicated that the central region of apoA-I becomes accessible to proteolysis in the hybrid particles. Together, these results suggest that amphipathic α-helices of apoA-II replace four central helices of one apoA-I molecule (residues ∼99–187) in the complex and in the process destabilize apoA-I. Thus, apoA-II binding at physiologic ratios may not completely displace apoA-I from HDL, but may provide a reservoir of easily exchangeable apoA-I. Finally, we showed that the reaction of the hybrid HDL with LCAT was inhibited 2–5-fold, relative to apoA-I-rHDL, due to a corresponding increase in the apparent K m value. This suggests that LCAT binding to the hybrid particles is sterically hindered by the excess protein (portions of apoA-I and apoA-II not bound to lipid). Therefore, apoA-II can modulate the reaction of HDL with LCAT by decreasing LCAT binding to hybrid particles and making the enzyme available for reaction with other substrates.

The main protein components of high density lipoproteins (HDL) 1The abbreviations used are: HDL, high density lipoproteins; apoA-I, apolipoprotein A-I; apoA-II, apolipoprotein A-II; LCAT, lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase; rHDL, reconstituted HDL; apoA-I-HDL, HDL containing only apoA-I; GuHCl, guanidine hydrochloride; DPPC, l-α-dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine; POPC,l-α-palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine; DNS-Cl, 1-dimethylaminonaphthalene-5-sulfonyl chloride; PRODAN, 6-propionyl-2-dimethylaminonaphthalene; BS3, bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate; apoA-I-DPPC-rHDL, rHDL containing apoA-I and DPPC; apoA-I-POPC-rHDL, rHDL containing apoA-I and POPC; apoA-II-DNS, 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl-labeled apoA-II; apoA-II/apoA-I-DPPC-rHDL, hybrid rHDL containing apoA-II, apoA-I, and DPPC; TPCK, tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.1The abbreviations used are: HDL, high density lipoproteins; apoA-I, apolipoprotein A-I; apoA-II, apolipoprotein A-II; LCAT, lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase; rHDL, reconstituted HDL; apoA-I-HDL, HDL containing only apoA-I; GuHCl, guanidine hydrochloride; DPPC, l-α-dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine; POPC,l-α-palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine; DNS-Cl, 1-dimethylaminonaphthalene-5-sulfonyl chloride; PRODAN, 6-propionyl-2-dimethylaminonaphthalene; BS3, bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate; apoA-I-DPPC-rHDL, rHDL containing apoA-I and DPPC; apoA-I-POPC-rHDL, rHDL containing apoA-I and POPC; apoA-II-DNS, 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl-labeled apoA-II; apoA-II/apoA-I-DPPC-rHDL, hybrid rHDL containing apoA-II, apoA-I, and DPPC; TPCK, tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. are apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) and apolipoprotein A-II (apoA-II), which together comprise 70 and 20%, respectively, of the protein mass of HDL. These two apolipoproteins define two main classes of mature HDL, one which contains both apoA-I and apoA-II, and the other which contains apoA-I but does not contain apoA-II. The structure and function of apoA-I have been studied extensively. There is general agreement that apoA-I determines the size and shape of HDL and removes lipids (cholesterol and phospholipids) from cell membranes to give rise to preβ-1 HDL particles, which then transfer cholesterol to larger preβ-2 HDL discs. ApoA-I is also the main activator of the lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) reaction, and is very likely the ligand in receptor recognition during HDL uptake by liver and steroidogenic cells (1Fielding C.J. Fielding P.E. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 211-228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The study of apoA-I structure has been facilitated by the availability of defined reconstituted HDL (rHDL) particles. In discoidal rHDL, two or more molecules of apoA-I each containing from 6–8 anti-parallel amphipathic α-helices form a shell of protein around a phospholipid bilayer disc. The apoA-I structure is highly plastic and adaptable to the content and composition of the lipids it solubilizes (2Jonas A. Kezdy K.E. Wald J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4818-4824Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Jonas A. Rosseneu M. Structure and Function of Apolipoproteins. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 217-250Google Scholar). Most known properties of apoA-I, including those observed in studies of transgenic mice for human apoA-I or knock-out mice (4Paszty C. Maeda N. Verstuyft J. Rubin E.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 899-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 5Williamson R. Lee D. Hagaman J. Maeda N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7134-7138Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), strongly suggest an anti-atherogenic role for apoA-I in vivo. In contrast to apoA-I, much less is known about the structure and function of apoA-II. High density lipoproteins containing only apoA-II are not detected in the circulation, even though rHDL with only apoA-II can be readily prepared (3Jonas A. Rosseneu M. Structure and Function of Apolipoproteins. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 217-250Google Scholar, 6Jonas A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 553-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). In vitro studies have demonstrated that apoA-II has a higher affinity for lipids than does apoA-I (7Massey J.B. Rohde M.F. VanWinkle W.B. Gotto Jr., A.M. Pownall H.J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 1569-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and easily displaces apoA-I from native HDL and from rHDL particles (8VanTornout P. Caster H. Lievens M. Rosseneu M. Assmann G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 663: 630-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 9Edelstein C. Halari M. Scanu A.M. J. Biol.

As in apoA-I, amphipathic α-helices (four helices) mediate the binding of apoA-II dimers to phospholipids. However, the physiologic function of A-II, aside from lipid solubilization, has not been firmly established. Several recent reports have addressed the role of apoA-II in HDL metabolism. Mowri et al. (11Mowri H. Patsch J. Gotto A. Patsch W. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 755-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) have suggested a role for apoA-II in native HDL in the stimulation of the hepatic lipase reaction. Forte et al. (12Forte T. Bielicki J. Goth-Goldstein R. Selmek J. McCall M. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 148-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that lipid-free apoA-II could recruit phospholipid and cholesterol from cell membranes to the same extent as lipid-free apoA-I, suggesting that nascent apoA-II particles could form at the site of apoA-II biosynthesis and secretion. However, these authors also reported that the complexes of apoA-II with cellular lipids did not undergo the usual morphological changes seen with nascent apoA-I-HDL in the presence of LCAT. The latter observation is not surprising because it is well known that apoA-II is a very poor activator of LCAT (about 100-fold) in comparison with apoA-I (13Jonas A. Sweeny S.A. Herbert P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6369-6375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Most recently, Pussinen et al. (14Pussinen P.J. Jauhiainen M. Ehnholm C. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 12-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that apoA-II in plasma HDL inhibited the particle transformations catalyzed by the phospholipid transfer protein. In addition to these observations, the complex physiologic effects detected in apoA-II transgenic and knock-out mice suggest both anti-atherogenic and proatherogenic properties for apoA-II (15Warden C.H. Hedrick C.C. Qiao J.-H. Castellani L.W. Lusis A.J. Science. 1993; 261: 469-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar,16Weng W. Breslow J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 93: 14788-14794Crossref Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Aside from its intrinsic function(s), apoA-II may exert its effects on HDL metabolism by modifying apoA-I structure and function when associated with HDL containing apoA-I. Past studies of the effects of apoA-II on apoA-I in HDL have been conducted under conditions that produce mixtures of particles with various apolipoprotein stoichiometries (10Rye K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1042: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Therefore, in this study our objective was to prepare homogeneous rHDL containing both apolipoproteins and to examine the properties of such particles and the effects of apoA-II on the structure and function of apoA-I. Human apoA-I, apoA-II, and LCAT were prepared from blood plasma purchased from the Champaign County Blood Bank, Regional Health Resource Center. The purifications of apoA-I and LCAT were performed as described previously (17Leroy A. Jonas A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 18Blanche P.

Chem. 1982; 257: 4541-4546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purification procedure for apoA-II was a modification of the protocol of Blancheet al. (18Blanche P. Nichols A. Forte T. Gong E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 958: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). After delipidating and purifying apoA-I from the HDL fraction (d = 1.063–1.212 g/ml), apoA-II was subsequently delipidated from the remaining HDL components by incubation with 6 m guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl) at 37 °C for 3 h, followed by ultracentrifugation at a density of 1.225 g/ml in a 55.2 Ti Beckman rotor at 50,000 rpm, 10 °C, for 48 h in the presence of GuHCl to prevent apoA-II from rebinding to the lipid. The bottom fraction containing lipid-free apoA-II was dialyzed versus 5 mm ammonium bicarbonate and lyophilized. The final purification of apoA-I and apoA-II was carried out by gel filtration in 3 m GuHCl using two Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Sephacryl HR-200 columns in tandem (2 × 90 cm, each). l-α-Dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC),l-α-palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC), crystalline cholesterol, and sodium cholate were purchased from Sigma; 1-dimethylaminonaphthalene-5-sulfonyl chloride (DNS-Cl) and 6-propionyl-2-dimethylaminonaphthalene (PRODAN) were obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR. Radiolabeled [14C]cholesterol was obtained from NEN Life Science Products. Bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (BS3) and polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (0.2 μm) were purchased from Pierce. Rabbit anti-human-apoA-I antibodies were purchased from Calbiochem; goat anti-human-apoA-II antibodies were purchased from Rockland, Gilbertsville, PA. TPCK-treated bovine pancreatic trypsin was purchased from Sigma. Instant thin layer chromatography (ITLC) plates were obtained from Gelman Sciences, Ann Arbor, MI. All experiments (unless noted otherwise) were performed in a 10 mm Tris buffer (pH 8.0) containing 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmNaN3, 0.01% EDTA; this buffer will be referred to as the standard buffer. The sodium cholate dialysis method (6Jonas A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 553-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar,20Matz C. Jonas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4535-4540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used in the preparation of rHDL complexes. A molar ratio of 100:5:1, PC/cholesterol/apoA-I, was used when preparing rHDL, with either DPPC or POPC. The apoA-II particles contained the same mass of phospholipid and cholesterol per mg of apoA-II protein as rHDL prepared with apoA-I. The size and homogeneity of the rHDL particles were assessed by nondenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (GGE) on 8–25% gradient gels using the Pharmacia Phast System. After staining the gels with Coomassie Blue R-350 and appropriate destaining, the gels were scanned with a Pharmacia LKB UltroScan XL laser densitometer, and the size of the rHDL particles was determined by their mobility relative to that of protein standards of known Stokes diameters (high molecular weight standards, Pharmacia). The size of the apoA-I-DPPC-rHDL particle was 98 Å (±2 Å, n = 20) in Stokes diameter, and contained two molecules of apoA-I as determined by chemical cross-linking. The apoA-I-POPC-rHDL preparation typically contained 99- and 120-Å species; isolation of the 99-Å rHDL was carried out by gel filtration chromatography on a Superdex 200 column (1 × 30 cm) using the Pharmacia FPLC System. The apoA-II-DPPC-rHDL was 101 Å (± 2 Å, n = 4) and contained four molecules of apoA-II. Protein composition was determined as the average of concentrations obtained from the assay by Markwell et al. (21Markwell M. Haas S. Bieber L. Tolbert N. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 206-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (5319) Google Scholar) and from absorbance at 280 nm, using an extinction coefficient of 1.15 ml/mg·cm for apoA-I, or at 276 nm, using an extinction coefficient of 0.69 mL/mg·cm for apoA-II (22Pownall H. Massey J. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 516Google Scholar). To conjugate the fluorescent probe DNS-Cl to apoA-II, DNS-Cl was solubilized in cold acetone (4.0 mg/ml) and added in a 2:1 molar ratio, DNS-Cl/apoA-II, in 10-μl aliquots to a solution of apoA-II in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 8.0), protected from light and on ice, stirring for 10 min between additions. The reaction mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 1 h and then applied to a PD-10 desalting column (Pharmacia) equilibrated with the standard buffer to isolate the fluorescently labeled protein from the unreacted DNS-Cl. The molar concentration of apoA-II-DNS was calculated from the extinction coefficients of 12,000m−1·cm−1 for apoA-II at 276 nm; and 4300 m−1·cm−1 and 1850m−1·cm−1 for DNS, at 276 and 340 nm, respectively (22Pownall H. Massey J. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 516Google Scholar, 23Weber G. Discuss. Faraday Soc. 1953; 14: 33-39Crossref Google Scholar). The DNS/apoA-II molar ratio (labeling efficiency) was on average 1.1:1 (n = 6 experiments). This extent of labeling did not appear to affect the ability of apoA-II to bind lipid, based on the similarity in size and composition of rHDL prepared with labeled or unlabeled apoA-II, or change the stability of labeled or unlabeled apoA-II associated with rHDL in the presence of GuHCl. All fluorescence measurements were carried out on an ISS PCl photon counting spectrofluorometer at the Laboratory for Fluorescence Dynamics, University of Illinois, Urbana, IL. Fluorescence polarization data reporting on the binding of apoA-II-DNS to A-I-rHDL were acquired for samples in standard buffer at 20 °C in a thermostated cell compartment. The fraction of apoA-I that remained bound to lipid after addition of apoA-II-DNS to apoA-I-rHDL was determined from the change in wavelength of maximum fluorescence (λmax) of uncorrected emission spectra of the apoA-I tryptophan (Trp) residues, acquired within 2 min after the addition of GuHCl. The final concentration of GuHCl was 1.5m, sufficient to denature lipid-free, but not lipid-bound, apoA-I. The emission spectra were obtained at room temperature using an excitation wavelength of 295 nm and an emission scan from 310 to 370 nm, with 1 mm excitation and emission slits. Under these conditions, Tyr fluorescence is not detected, and only apoA-I Trp fluorescence is observed. The fraction of lipid-bound apoA-I (FLB) was calculated from the relationship,λ100%LB(FLB)+λ100%LF(1−FLB)=λEquation 1 where λ100%LB is the wavelength for 100% lipid-bound apoA-I in A-I-rHDL, λ100%LF is the wavelength for lipid-free apoA-I, and λ is the wavelength of the apoA-II-DNS/A-I-rHDL solution, in the presence of 1.5 mGuHCl. To detect changes in the hydration of the apoA-I-rHDL phospholipid surface upon binding of apoA-II, PRODAN in ethanol was added to apoA-I-DPPC-rHDL to give a molar ratio of DPPC/PRODAN of 600:1. After equilibration of the probe with the rHDL, apoA-II was added and the emission spectra of PRODAN, excited at 360 nm, were recorded from 390–600 nm, at 5-min intervals. Circular dichroic (CD) spectra were recorded with a Jasco J720 spectropolarimeter at the Laboratory for Fluorescence Dynamics (University of Illinois). The samples were adjusted to a concentration of 0.100 mg/ml in 0.1m phosphate buffer (pH 8.0). Measurements were made at room temperature using a 0.1-cm path length quartz cuvette. Spectra were acquired from 250 to 200 nm at a speed of 50 nm/min, with a 0.5-nm step resolution and a response time of 4.0 s, using a 1.0-nm bandwidth. Four scans were acquired and averaged for each sample; a base-line scan was subtracted to produce the final average scan. The molar ellipticity at 222 nm and the fraction of α-helical secondary structure were calculated as published previously (24Leroy A. Harms-Toohill K. Fruchart J. Jonas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4798-4805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The procedure for cross-linking of apolipoproteins in rHDL with BS3 was published previously (24Leroy A. Harms-Toohill K. Fruchart J. Jonas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4798-4805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Native GGE of apoA-I-DPPC-rHDL, ±BS3, and ±apoA-II, was performed using nondenaturing 8–25% gradient gels on the Pharmacia Phast System. The gels were blotted for 10 min with polyvinylidene difluoride membranes saturated with MeOH to allow transfer of protein by diffusion. The membranes were subsequently reacted with antibodies to apoA-I (1:5000 dilution) or apoA-II (1:1000 dilution) following the protocol for the ImmunoPure ABC peroxidase staining kit from Pierce. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies of goat anti-rabbit and rabbit anti-goat immunoglobulins were used to visualize the apoA-I and apoA-II primary antibodies, respectively. Diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride in 0.08% H2O2 was added as the horseradish peroxidase substrate. The Phast gels were stained with 0.1% Coomassie Blue R-350 after membrane blotting. Limited proteolytic digestion of apoA-I-DPPC-rHDL was carried out in the absence and in the presence of apoA-II, to examine the susceptibility of apoA-I to proteolysis by trypsin. AI-DPPC-rHDL was incubated with apoA-II in a 2:1 molar ratio, apoA-I:apoA-II, for 20 min at 25 °C, then TPCK-trypsin was added to the sample in a ratio of 200:1, apoA-I:trypsin (w/w). Aliquots were withdrawn from the reaction mixture and from a control reaction mixture containing no apoA-II at time points of 5, 10, 30, and 120 min after the addition of trypsin. The digestion products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using 20% homogeneous gels and the Pharmacia Phast System, followed by staining with 0.1% Coomassie Blue R-350 and/or Western blotting with antibodies to apoA-I or apoA-II. The gels were scanned with a Pharmacia LKB UltroScan XL laser densitometer, and the sizes of the proteolytic fragments were determined by electrophoretic migration relative to low molecular weight standards (Pharmacia). The peaks for apoA-I identified at each time point on the scans represented intact apoA-I and apoA-I fragments of 22 kDa and of approximately 14 kDa. The 14-kDa fragment was subjected to N-terminal sequencing as follows: the 120-min digestion products were separated by SDS-PAGE using a discontinuous Tris-glycine system with a 12.5% T, 2.5% C resolving gel, and a 4% T, 2.5% C stacking gel. The bands were electrophoretically transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and stained; the 14-kDa band was excised and subjected to automated Edman degradation analysis on an Applied Biosystems 477A protein sequencer using eleven reaction cycles (Genetic Engineering Facility, University of Illinois Biotechnology Center). Radiolabeled apoA-I-POPC-rHDL or apoA-I-DPPC-rHDL, containing 5 mol of cholesterol/mol of apoA-I and [14C]cholesterol, were incubated with apoA-II for 20 min at 37 °C and subsequently reacted with LCAT as described previously (19Matz C. Jonas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4541-4546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The lipids extracted in the organic phase were spotted on ITLC plates developed in petroleum ether/ethyl ether/acetic acid, 85:15:1, v/v. The lipid spots were cut out and the percent conversion of cholesterol ester from free cholesterol was determined by scintillation counting. Data analysis was performed using the KaleidaGraph 3.0.5, Abelbeck Software, Reading, PA. We examined first the time course for the binding of apoA-II-DNS to apoA-I-DPPC-rHDL particles at several ratios of apoA-II/apoA-I. The results for a molar ratio of 1:2, apoA-II/apoA-I, are shown in Fig.1. The fluorescence polarization of free apoA-II-DNS (0.180) increases rapidly to 0.240 and then more gradually over 30 min to an equilibrium value of 0.275, which is close to the fluorescence polarization of a control rHDL particle prepared with apoA-II-DNS (Fig. 1 A). The increase in fluorescence polarization of apoA-II-DNS, upon binding to the rHDL, reflects the reduced rotational motions of the fluorophore in the large rHDL. Qualitatively similar kinetics were also observed for the binding of apoA-II-DNS to apoA-I-DPPC-rHDL or to apoA-I-POPC-rHDL, at molar ratios from 0.25:1 to 2:1, apoA-II/apoA-I (data not shown). The binding of apoA-II-DNS to apoA-I-rHDL appears irreversible as dilutions of 20-fold over 4 h do not result in significant decreases in polarization from a value of 0.275. B in Fig. 1 shows that when apoA-I is chemically cross-linked in the rHDL particles, the binding of apoA-II-DNS is markedly reduced. This indicates that the binding requires a structural rearrangement of apoA-I and, likely, does not occur on the exposed lipid surface of the particles. C in Fig. 1 illustrates the effect of apoA-II binding on the lipid surface properties of the apoA-I-DPPC-rHDL. There is a rapid small (3–5 nm) blue shift in the fluorescence emission of the PRODAN probe upon apoA-II binding. This indicates a decrease in the hydration of the lipid and/or a change to a more condensed lipid state. However, the wavelength change is relatively small, suggesting that the lipid is not strongly perturbed by apoA-II binding. The two stages in the spectral changes coincide with the rapid and slower steps in apoA-II-DNS binding kinetics observed in A. These two kinetic steps may correspond to 1) a rapid initial binding to the edge of the rHDL, where apoA-I structural fluctuations permit apoA-II insertion and 2) a slower step requiring further structural rearrangements in apoA-I and/or apoA-II. Fig.2 shows the percent of apoA-I displaced from apoA-I-DPPC-rHDL when incubated with increasing amounts of apoA-II. Up to a molar ratio of 0.5:1 (or 1:2 in terms of rHDL stoichiometry) apoA-II/apoA-I, little or no apoA-I is displaced. At a molar ratio of 1:1, 50% of apoA-I is displaced; and at molar ratios greater than 2:1 essentially 100% of apoA-I is displaced. This corresponds to a stoichiometric displacement of one apoA-I molecule by two apoA-II molecules, as reported previously by other groups (8VanTornout P. Caster H. Lievens M. Rosseneu M. Assmann G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 663: 630-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 9Edelstein C. Halari M. Scanu A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7189-7195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Rye K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1042: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The fact that there is minimal displacement of apoA-I at the 1:2 ratio of apoA-II/apoA-I indicates that apoA-II is distributed randomly among the apoA-I-rHDL particles. If there had been a significant population of rHDL particles that bound two apoA-II molecules in this sample, it would have produced a corresponding amount of free apoA-I. To assess the diameter of the complex formed between apoA-II and apoA-I-DPPC-rHDL at the molar ratio of 0.5:1 (apoA-II/apoA-I), we performed nondenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and detected the protein by Coomassie stain and by Western blotting (Fig. 3). The hybrid particle was compared with the control apoA-I-DPPC-rHDL and with samples of both particles that were chemically cross-linked. The hybrid particle (lane 5) has the same Stokes diameter as the control rHDL (lane 2); the hybrid contains all of the added apoA-II, but loses significant amounts of apoA-I upon electrophoresis. Apparently, the amount of free apoA-I in the hybrid sample is significantly larger than that detected in Fig. 2 and indicates that destabilized apoA-I is stripped off during electrophoresis. All the cross-linked rHDL particles appear to have Stokes diameters several angstroms smaller than the rHDL that have not been cross-linked, probably because chemical cross-linking produces more compact particles that migrate farther in the gel. The cross-linked hybrid particle does not lose apoA-I during electrophoresis (lane 3), whereas a cross-linked apoA-I-rHDL particle to which apoA-II was added later (lane 4) incorporates much less apoA-II. This observation confirms the result presented in Fig. 1 B, that previous immobilization of apoA-I in the rHDL prevents binding of apoA-II. Table I summarizes several physical properties of the hybrid apoA-II/apoA-I-DPPC-rHDL in comparison with the apoA-I-DPPC-rHDL control. The hybrid particle has the same major dimension (i.e. disc diameter) as apoA-I-DPPC-rHDL and is homogeneous, since the free apoA-I seen in lane 5 of Fig. 3is an artifact of electrophoresis. The stoichiometry of two molecules of apoA-I and one molecule of apoA-II was confirmed by performing SDS-PAGE on the cross-linked hybrid, showing that the major product band had a molecular weight of 73 kDa (data not shown).Table IBiophysical properties of the apoA-II/apoA-I-DPPC-rHDL hybrid particle compared with the apoA-I-DPPC-rHDL control particlesPropertyApoA-II/ApoA-IDPPC-rHDLApoA-IDPPC-rHDLStokes diameter (Å)1-aFrom migration on nondenaturing GGE (see Fig. 3).

https://openalex.org/W2161298869,"Radar observations of comet Hyakutake (C/1996 B2) made at the Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex in California have detected echoes from the nucleus and from large grains in the inner coma. The nucleus of this bright comet was estimated to be only 2 to 3 kilometers in diameter. Models of the coma echo indicate backscatter from porous, centimeter-size grains ejected anisotropically at velocities of tens of meters per second. The radar observations suggest that a comet's activity may be a poor indicator of its size and provide evidence that large grains constitute an important component of the mass loss from a typical active comet."

On SDS gels, two proteins of 56 and 59 kDa were detected and both were labeled to the same extent by the photoaffinity label, 5-N3-UDP-[32P]xylose. Labeling of both proteins was inhibited by cold UDP-xylose, but not by UDP-glucose.

Immediate hypersensitivity reactions to foods occurs in 6–8% of children and about 1% of adults (1Jansen J.J. Kardinaal A.F.M. Huijber G. Vleig-Boerstra B.J. Martens B.P. Ockhuizen T. J.

The majority of allergies are to foods of plant origin, and a number of allergenic proteins have been identified from peanut, wheat, barley, rye, and soy (3Armentia A. Sanchez-Monge R. Gomez L.

Science. 1985; 219: 932-940Crossref Scopus (347) Google Scholar), there is increasing evidence (9Hansen E. Wold J.K. Smestad P.B. Cohen E.H. Karlsson-Borga A.

Immunol. 1994; 6: 453-463Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar) that specific carbohydrate structures may also be important as allergens. While there is some similarity in peptide sequence between the different allergenic proteins, a common characteristic is that most contain N-linked oligosaccharides having a β1,2-linked xylose attached to the β-linked mannose of the core structure (12Calkhoven P.G. Aalbers M. Koshte V.L. Pos O. Oei H.D. Aalberse R.C. Allergy. 1987; 42: 382-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in wheat and barley glycoproteins, xylose appears to be important for allergenicity, since those proteins containing a β1,2-xylose were more reactive in vivo and in vitrothan deglycosylated proteins (13Tezuka K. Hayashi M. Ishihara H. Akazawa T. Takahashi N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 203: 401-413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, IgE from allergic patients recognized an endo-Lys C peptide containing the glycan, and this recognition was lost upon deglycosylation (14Garcia-Casado G. Sanchez R. Chrispeels M.J. Armentia A. Salcedo G. Gomez L. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 471-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The enzyme that adds xylose to these N-linked glycoproteins is the plant β1,2-xylosyltransferase. The identification of this enzyme in microsomes from Phaseolus vulgaris cotyledons (15Rodgers W. Bolwell G.P. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 817-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and from sycamore cells of Acer pseudoplatanus (16Tezuka K. Hayashi M. Ishihara H. Akazawa T. Takahashi N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 203: 401-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) has been reported, but there are no reports on the purification or properties of the enzyme. The substrate specificity for acceptor oligosaccharide was examined with particulate enzyme preparations from these two plant sources and in both cases, the enzymes acted on acceptors having a β1,2-GlcNAc residue on the Manα1,3-arm, but GlcNAc-Man5(GlcNAc)2 was not a good acceptor. Thus, it was postulated that in the processing pathway, xylose is added after the mannosidase II step (15Rodgers W. Bolwell G.P. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 817-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, with the xylosyltransferase from the snail, Lymnaea stagnalis, the biantennary oligosaccharide containing a galactose in β1,4 linkage to the GlcNAc on the Manα1,3-arm was also an acceptor, although it was much less efficient (17Mulder H. Dideberg F. Schachter H. Spronk B.A. DeJong-Brink M. Kammerling J.P. Vliegenthart F.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 272-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). These studies suggested that xylose is added after the removal of the two mannoses on the Manα1,6-arm, but before galactoses are added to the GlcNAc residues. The xylose units on these N-linked oligosaccharides may play a critical role in allergenicity, and may also be important in regulating the structure of the oligosaccharide chains and the targeting of these proteins to various organelles such as storage bodies. Thus, it is important to purify this enzyme to study its properties and specificities in the absence of interfering activities and possible inhibitors. As reported here, we have purified the soybean xylosyltransferase about 51,000-fold to apparent homogeneity, and determined the substrate specificity and other properties of this enzyme. UDP-[3H]xylose (7.5 Ci/mmol) and GDP-l-[3H]fucose (7.1 Ci/mmol) were purchased from American Radiolabeled Co. [2-3H]Mannose (15 Ci/mmol) and [6-3H]galactose (20 Ci/mmol) were from NEN-Life Science Products, and 32P-inorganic phosphate was from ICN. Radioactive compounds were checked by chromatography before use. Various adsorbents were obtained from the following sources: DEAE-cellulose (DE-52) from Whatman Co. and UDP-hexanolamine-Sepharose, iminodiacetic acid-Sepharose 6B, and Reactive Yellow 3-agarose from Sigma. The following materials were obtained from Bio-Rad: SDS, acrylamide, bisacrylamide, Coomassie Blue, protein assay reagent, and Bio-Gel P-4. All other chemicals were from reliable chemical sources and were of the best grade available. Reaction mixtures for the assay of β1,2-xylosyltransferase contained the following components in a final volume of 25 μl: 100 mmMES 1The abbreviations used are: MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; RP-HPLC, reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. buffer, pH 7.0, 10 mm MnCl2, 0.2% Triton X-100, 5 mmATP, 0.2 mm UDP-[3H]xylose (15,000 cpm), and 4 nmol of oligosaccharide acceptor (usually GlcNAc2-Man3-GlcNAc2-tyrosinamide or the asialo-agalacto-oligosaccharide from transferrin). The reaction was started by the addition of 5 μl of the enzyme solution, and incubations were usually at 37 °C for 1 h. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 μl of 1% acetic acid and the reaction mixtures were chromatographed on a column of Bio-Gel P-4, prepared by placing 10 ml of gel into a 10-ml plastic pipette having a total column volume of 13 ml. The columns were equilibrated with 1% acetic acid, and the product was separated from substrates by elution with 1% acetic acid containing 0.2 m NaCl. The xylosylated oligosaccharide product emerged within 2.5–7 ml of elution, whereas the UDP-xylose substrate eluted after 9 ml of elution fluid. When more purified enzyme preparations were used in the assays, the radiolabeled product could be separated from the radioactive substrate by ion-exchange chromatography on an Amberlite column (or a column of Dowex-1-Cl−) contained in a Pasteur pipette. In this case, the substrate, UDP-xylose, binds to the column whereas the product ([3H]xylose-oligosaccharide) emerges in the wash. Thus, the wash can be counted as a measure of radioactive xylose transferred to oligosaccharide. In these assays, it is important to be certain that the enzyme preparation is free of degradative enzymes that cleave UDP-xylose to free xylose. Asialo-agalacto-oligosaccharide was prepared from human transferrin by the following procedure. Apo-transferrin was obtained from Sigma and was exhaustively digested with Pronase. Thus, 500 mg of transferrin were dissolved in 5 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 2 mm CaCl2, and 2 mg/ml Pronase were added. The incubations were allowed to proceed for 24 h under a toluene atmosphere and another 2 mg/ml Pronase were added for an additional 24 h. At the end of this time, the reaction mixture was heated at 100 °C for 5 min, and the glycopeptides were purified on a 2 × 200-cm column of Bio-Gel P-4. The glycopeptide was then heated at 80 °C for 4 h in 2n acetic acid to remove the sialic acid, and the asialo-glycopeptide was again purified on the Bio-Gel P-4 column. The asialo-glycopeptide was then incubated with 0.2 units of jack bean β-galactosidase to remove the terminal galactose residues. This final product was purified on the Bio-Gel P-4 column, and its concentration was determined by the anthrone method, using mannose as a standard. Tyrosinamide biantennary oligosaccharides, with or without a core fucose, were prepared from bovine fetuin and porcine fibrinogen as described previously (18Tamura T. Wadhwa M.S. Rice K.G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 216: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 19Silva M. Tamura T. McBroom T. Rice K.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 312: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). A biantennary oligosaccharide (Fig. 4,structure 1) was converted into various xylosyltransferase acceptor substrates as follows: Oligosaccharide 1 (1 μmol) was treated with 16.5 milliunits of bovine testis β-galactosidase (EC3.2.1.23) from Boehringer Mannheim in 100 μl of 100 mmphosphate-citrate buffer, pH 4.3, at 37 °C for 4 h. The reaction was stopped by boiling for 5 min. The partially degalactosylated biantennary structure was reacted with 500 milliunits (2 μl) of hexosaminidase (EC 3.2.1.52) from V-labs, for 12 h at 37 °C. The four product peaks were purified on a semi-preparative RP-HPLC C-18 column run at 50 °C, and the column was eluted at 3 ml/min with 14% acetonitrile in 0.1% acetic acid. Peaks were detected by monitoring at 280 nm. The second and third peaks were treated individually with 3 milliunits of β-galactosidase in 10 μl of 100 mm phosphate-citrate buffer, pH 4.3, for 24 h at 37 °C. The final products were purified on a polymeric PRP-1 RP-HPLC column, which was eluted with 13% acetonitrile in 0.1% acetic acid at 2 ml/min. Peaks were detected at 280 nm. Fractions were collected and freeze-dried. The overall yield was about 30%. The identity of each oligosaccharide product was established by NMR and electrospray mass spectrometry as described previously (18Tamura T. Wadhwa M.S. Rice K.G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 216: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 19Silva M. Tamura T. McBroom T. Rice K.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 312: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Large scale synthesis of xylosyltransferase product was performed by incubating oligosaccharide 4 (200 nmol) with 1.9 μmol of UDP-xylose and 1 milliunits of xylosyltransferase in 665 μl of buffer (100 mm MES buffer, pH 7.0, 10 mm MnCl2, 0.25% Triton X-100, and 5 mm ATP) for 24 h at 37 °C. The reaction progress was monitored by RP-HPLC, which demonstrated a single product that eluted 1 min earlier than the substrate. At completion, the product peak was isolated from analytical RP-HPLC and characterized by proton NMR. 5-N3-UDP-[32P]xylose was prepared from N3-UDP-[32P]glucuronic acid using the purified UDP-glucuronic acid carboxylyase as described previously (20Kyossev J.N. Drake R.R. Kyosseva S. Elbein A.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 109-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). This procedure involved the synthesis of 5-N3-UDP-[32P]glucose from glucose-1-32P and N3-UTP by previously published methods (21Drake Jr., R.R. Evans R.K. Wolf M.J. Haley B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 246: 11928-11933Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), conversion of this 5-N3-UDP-[32P]glucose to 5-N3-UDP-[32P]glucuronic acid by the UDP-glucose dehydrogenase, and then decarboxylation of the N3-UDP-[32P]glucuronic acid to 5-N3-UDP-[32P]xylose using the partially purified UDP-glucuronic acid carboxylyase from wheat germ (20Kyossev J.N.

Soybean cells were routinely grown for 7 days at 28 °C in suspension culture in 500-ml Erlenmeyer flasks containing 100 ml of B-5 medium (22$$Google Scholar). This medium has the following composition (mg/liter): KNO3, 3000; (NH4)2SO4, 134; MgSO4·7H2O, 500; CaCl2·7H2O, 150; NaH2PO4·H2O, 150; MnSO4·H2O, 100; KI, 0.75; H3BO3, 3; ZnSO4·7H2O, 2; CuSO4, 0.025; Na2MoO4·2H2O, 0.25; CoCl2·6H2O, 0.025; EDTA-ferric sodium salt, 28; myoinositol, 100; thiamine·HCl, 10; nicotinic acid, 1; pyridoxine·HCl, 1; sucrose, 20,000; 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, 0.5. The final solution was adjusted to pH 5.5. Cells were harvested by filtration at the mid-log phase of growth and washed well with water and then with Buffer A (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, containing 0.25 m sucrose, 0.5 m dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). About 100 g of washed cells were suspended in 300 ml of Buffer A and disrupted by sonic oscillation (three 5-min periods of sonication at 80% output, with 10 min of cooling on ice between each sonication). The suspension was centrifuged at 3000 ×g for 15 min to remove unbroken cells, nuclei, and mitochondria, and the supernatant liquid was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g to isolate the microsomal fraction. The microsomal pellet was resuspended in Buffer B (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, containing 10% glycerol, 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The microsomal fraction from soybean cells transferred xylose from UDP-xylose to GlcNAc2Man3(GlcNAc)2-tyrosinamide (or peptide). To purify this enzymatic activity, it was necessary to solubilize the xylosyltransferase from the microsomes. A variety of detergents were tested at different concentrations for their ability to solubilize the enzyme and maintain its stability. The results of these experiments are shown in Table I. In each case, the enzyme was mixed with detergent, and the mixture was stirred on ice for 15 min and then centrifuged at high speed for 30 min to pellet the membranes. The enzymatic activity in the supernatant liquid was then measured in the usual transferase assay. As seen in Table I, the activity was best solubilized from the membranes by treatment with either 1% or 2% Triton X-100 in Buffer B. Thus, at either concentration of Triton X-100, at least 80% of the enzymatic activity was recovered in the supernatant liquid, and the enzyme appeared to be fairly stable under these conditions.Table ISolubilization of xylosyltransferase by detergentsDetergent testedXylose transferred to acceptor1-aIn each case, the amount of protein was adjusted to a common value (10 mg/ml), so that each enzyme solution could be directly compared. byParticulate suspension1-aIn each case, the amount of protein was adjusted to a common value (10 mg/ml), so that each enzyme solution could be directly compared.High speed supernatantcpmNone1971325Triton X-100, 0.5%24811189Triton X-100, 1%26892188Triton X-100, 2%26952297Taurocholate, 1%15701574Deoxycholate, 1%316197CPC,1-bCPC, cetylpyridinium chloride. 1%134164Octylglucoside, 1%2395210CHAPS, 1%2168541SDS, 1%144271-a In each case, the amount of protein was adjusted to a common value (10 mg/ml), so that each enzyme solution could be directly compared.1-b CPC, cetylpyridinium chloride. Open table in a new tab As a result of these experiments, a large scale preparation of microsomes was done from 3 kg of soybean cells as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The microsomes (2900 mg of protein in 250 ml of buffer) were treated with 1% Triton X-100 for 30 min, and the mixture was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The pellet was resuspended in Buffer B containing 1% Triton X-100, and centrifuged again at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The two supernatant fractions were pooled for further purification steps. Eighty to ninety percent of the xylosyltransferase activity was recovered in the pooled supernatant fractions after this treatment, whereas in control membranes that were stirred on ice for 30 min in buffer but without detergent, more than 85% of the activity was pelleted when centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. In many cases, the supernatant liquids were used immediately in further purification steps, but they could be stored at −80 °C for 1 month with little loss of xylosyltransferase activity. The solubilized enzyme was then divided into two equal portions, and each was placed on a 2.5 × 30-cm column of cellulose phosphate that had been equilibrated with Buffer C (25 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.2, containing 10% glycerol, 0.15% Triton X-100, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol). After applying the enzyme solution, the column was washed with Buffer C, followed by Buffer C containing 100 mm NaCl until no more protein was eluted. As shown in Fig.1 A, the column was then washed with Buffer C, containing 350 mm NaCl and the xylosyltransferase activity was eluted at this salt concentration. Fractions were assayed for transferase activity and active fractions were pooled. This step gave a 20-fold increase in specific activity with an 65% recovery of total activity (TableII).Table IISummary of the soybean cell xylosyltransferase purificationsStepTotal proteinTotal units2-aA unit is defined as the amount of enzyme which transfers 1 nmol of xylose to acceptor per hour.Specific activityPurification factorRecoverymgunits/mg-fold%Microsomal fraction289425,1278.71100Phosphocellulose84.216,3061932264.9Iminodiacetic acid-Sepharose6.513,272204123452.8Yellow 3-agarose2.18105385944332.2UDP-hexanolamine0.0062-bThis amount of protein was estimated by comparing the staining of the xylosyltransferase on SDS gels to staining of known amounts of bovine serum albumin.2672445,33351,18710.62-a A unit is defined as the amount of enzyme which transfers 1 nmol of xylose to acceptor per hour.2-b This amount of protein was estimated by comparing the staining of the xylosyltransferase on SDS gels to staining of known amounts of bovine serum albumin. Open table in a new tab The active fractions from the phosphocellulose column (about 250 ml) were pooled and concentrated to about 30 ml. Sodium chloride was added to this solution to a final concentration of 0.5 m, and the mixture was loaded onto a 1.5 × 15-cm column of iminodiacetic acid-Sepharose 6B that had been equilibrated with Buffer D (25 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.2, containing 10% glycerol, 0.15% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mNaCl). The column was washed with Buffer D until no more protein emerged, and the xylosyltransferase was eluted with a linear gradient of imidazole (0–0.15 m) in a total volume of 600 ml of Buffer D (Fig. 1 B). This column gave about a 10-fold purification with a recovery of about 85%. Active fractions were pooled, concentrated to about 25 ml on an Amicon filtration apparatus, and dialyzed against Buffer C, containing 15% glycerol. The dialyzed enzyme from the iminodiacetic acid-Sepharose was placed on a 2.5 × 15-cm column of Reactive Yellow 3-Sepharose, that had been equilibrated with Buffer C but contained 15% glycerol. The column was washed with Buffer C until no more protein emerged, and bound protein was then eluted with a linear gradient of 0–0.25 mNaCl in Buffer C, containing 15% glycerol. Fractions of 10 ml were collected, and active fractions were pooled and concentrated to 5 ml on an Amicon filtration apparatus. To decrease the concentration of NaCl, 15 ml of Buffer C containing 15% glycerol were added to the concentrated enzyme solution and it was again concentrated to 5 ml on the Amicon apparatus. The concentrated enzyme fraction from the Reactive Yellow 3 column was applied to a 1 × 15-cm column of UDP-hexanolamine-Sepharose that had been equilibrated with Buffer C containing 20% glycerol. The column was first washed with 100 ml of this buffer and then was eluted with 300 ml of a linear gradient of 0–1.5 m NaCl in the same buffer (Fig. 1 C). This affinity step increased the specific activity by a factor of about 115-fold with a recovery of about 30%. Using these purification steps, the xylosyltransferase was purified about 51,000-fold from the solubilized enzyme fraction with a final recovery of about 10%. The summary of the purification procedure is presented in Table II. Fig. 2 shows the protein profiles at various steps in the purification procedure as determined by SDS-PAGE. At the final step of purification, two major protein bands of 56 and 59 kDa were detected on SDS gels. To determine which band was really the xylosyltransferase, the enzyme fraction from UDP-hexanolamine was incubated with 5-N3-UDP-[32P]xylose in 50 mmTris buffer, pH 7.2, at room temperature for 60 s, and then the mixture was irradiated for 60 s with a hand-held UV lamp (254 nm UVP-11) to activate the azido group. The incubation mixture was then adjusted to 5% with trichloroacetic acid to precipitate the protein, and the protein pellets were suspended in a denaturing gel-loading buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The radiolabeled proteins were then located by autoradiography as shown in Fig. 3. Lanes 1–3 of Fig.3 A show that both the 56- and 59-kDa proteins became labeled in a concentration-dependent manner when they were exposed to increasing amounts of the UDP-xylose photoaffinity probe and then exposed to UV light. On the other hand, the incubation mixture that was not exposed to UV light did not show any labeled protein bands (data not shown). Lanes 4 and 5 of Fig. 3 Ashow that when labeling was done in the presence of 10 or 100 μm unlabeled UDP-xylose, the amount of radioactivity associated with both the 56- and 59-kDa bands was greatly diminished, indicating that labeling is specific for UDP-xylose. Furthermore, incubation of enzyme and UDP-xylose probe in the presence of other nucleoside diphosphate sugars, such as UDP-galactose (lanes 6 and 7), UDP-glucose (lanes 8 and9), or UDP-glucuronic acid (lanes 10 and11) did not result in significant inhibition of labeling. Interestingly enough, addition of oligosaccharide 4 (lane 12) or oligosaccharide 9 (lane 13) to incubations with 5-N3-UDP-[32P]xylose resulted in a dramatic increase in the labeling of both protein bands, but oligosaccharide 8, having a single GlcNAc on the mannose-linked α1,6 to the β-linked mannose, did not stimulate labeling. Since the native enzyme has a molecular mass of about 50 kDa by gel filtration (see below), and two protein bands of 56 and 59 kDa are detected by photolabeling on SDS gels, it seems likely that the 56-kDa band arises by limited proteolysis of the 59-kDa band. Sequencing and cloning studies should indicate the relationship of these two xylosyltransferase activities. Since the oligosaccharides caused such a great increase in labeling of xylosyltransferase by 5-N3-UDP-[32P]xylose, it was of interest to compare their stimulation as a function of oligosaccharide concentration. Thus, as shown in Fig. 3 B, various amounts of each oligosaccharide were added to incubations of enzyme plus 5 μl of the 5-N3-UDP-[32P]xylose. It can be seen fromlanes 2–5 that addition of oligosaccharide 4, at 4, 10, 30, and 80 μm, gave a concentration-dependent increase in labeling, as compared with lane 1, which is without acceptor oligosaccharide. Lanes 6–9 show that oligosaccharide 9, with a single GlcNAc on the mannose-linked α1,3 to the β-linked mannose, also gave a concentration-dependent increase in labeling, but this oligosaccharide was significantly less effective in stimulating labeling than was oligosaccharide 4. On the other hand, oligosaccharide 7 (core structure, i.e.Man9(GlcNAc)2) or oligosaccharide 1 with two terminal galactoses did not cause any stimulation in labeling (even at 80 μm). These data are in agreement with studies shown in Table III on the ability of the various oligosaccharides to act as xylose acceptors. The results presented here suggest that the acceptor oligosaccharide binds to the enzyme first, and this binding then enhances the binding of the UDP-xylose photoprobe.Table IIISpecificity of plant β1,2-xylosyltransferase for oligosaccharide acceptorOligosaccharide acceptorActivity3-aIncorporation of radioactivity from UDP-[3H]xylose into acceptor oligosaccharide was measured by gel filtration on Bio-Gel P-4. withPurified enzymeParticulate enzymecpm xylose transferredNo acceptor3598No. 1 (see Fig. 4)2659No. 10 (see Fig. 4)32122387No. 4 (see Fig. 4)35783648GlcNAc-Man3-5′-isomer (no. 8)69GlcNAc-Man3-5-isomer (no. 9)1194No. 11 (see Fig. 4)6856No. 7 (see Fig. 4)57371Man9(GlcNAc)248262Transferrin106Asialo-agalacto-transferrin peptide321524493-a Incorporation of radioactivity from UDP-[3H]xylose into acceptor oligosaccharide was measured by gel filtration on Bio-Gel P-4. Open table in a new tab The most purified preparation of xylosyltransferase was examined for its stability under various conditions. The enzyme was stable for up to 90 days, when dissolved in 25 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.0, containing 10% glycerol, 0.2% Triton X-100, and 1 mm dithiothreitol, and kept either in an ice bucket at 4 °C or at −20 °C (data not shown). After a month of storage under these conditions and at either temperature, at least 80% of the original enzyme activity still remained. Thus, storage of the purified enzyme in the above buffer solution does not appear to be a problem. The stability of the enzyme is, however, sensitive to changes in pH of the storage solution. Thus, above pH 7.5 and below pH 6.5, the stability of the enzyme rapidly declines. Exoglycosidase trimming was used to convert biantennary substrates (see Fig. 4 for structures of oligosaccharides) into substructures that could serve as xylosyl acceptors. Treatment of substrate 1 with β-galactosidase resulted in its complete conversion into substrate 4, and subsequent treatment with β-hexosaminidase resulted in the formation of oligosaccharide 7. Likewise, β-galactosidase and β-hexosaminidase digestions were used to prepare oligosaccharides 10 and 11, starting with a core fucosylated biantennary oligosaccharide obtained from porcine fibrinogen. Partial removal of galactose was accomplished by monitoring the β-galactosidase reaction by RP-HPLC, using an RP-HPLC C-18 column and eluting with 12% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at 1 ml/min. Fluorescence was detected at an excitation of 275 nm and an emission of 305 nm. Oligosaccharide 1 resolved as a single peak (Fig.5 A) that was converted into four peaks at an intermediate time point in the β-galactosidase reaction (Fig. 5 B). The numbers assigned to these peaks tentatively corresponded to the structures shown in Fig. 4. Hexosaminidase digestion was then used to convert oligosaccharide 2 into 5, 3 into 6, and 4 into 7A (Fig. 5 C). As expected, oligosaccharide 1 resisted digestion by β-hexosaminidase, confirming that it was the biantennary structure presented in Fig. 4(structure 1). Oligosaccharides 5 and 6 were isolated from the mixture and then treated again with β-galactosidase to prepare structures 8 and 9 (Fig. 5, D and E). Electrospray mass spectrometry revealed that oligosaccharides 8 and 9 possessed identical masses of m/z 1"

https://openalex.org/W2043186852,"The inter-relationship between the interior subunit interfaces and the exterior diphosphoglycerate (DPG) binding region of the hemoglobin tetramer and the effects of a specific N-terminal acetylation on tetramer assembly have been evaluated. Tetrameric fetal hemoglobin F in the liganded state was found to dissociate to dimers much less than previously appreciated,i.e. about 70 times less than adult hemoglobin A (K d = 0.01 μm and 0.68 μm, for HbF and HbA, at pH 7.5, respectively) over the pH range 6.2–7.5, whereas HbF1, in which the N termini of the γ-chains are acetylated, dissociates like HbA. To determine whether this feature of HbF could be transferred to hemoglobin A, the single amino acid difference in their α1β2/α1γ2interfaces and the 4 amino acid differences in their α1β1/α1γ1interfaces have been substituted in HbA to those in HbF. This pentasubstituted recombinant HbA/F had the correct molecular weight as determined by mass spectrometry, the expected mobility on isoelectric focusing, the calculated amino acid composition, and normal circular dichroism properties, oxygen binding, and cooperativity. Although HbA/F has the same amino acid side chains that bind DPG as HbA, its diminished response to 2,3-DPG resembled that of HbF. However, its tetramer-dimer dissociation constant (K d = 0.14 μm) was between that of HbA and HbF despite the fact that it was composed entirely of HbF subunit interfaces.

Some functional properties of HbF (α2γ2), such as its oxygen affinity and its interaction with allosteric regulators such as 2,3-DPG 1The abbreviations used are: DPG, diphosphoglycerate; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. differ considerably from the corresponding values of HbA (α2β2) (1Poyart C. Burseaux E. Guesnon P. Teisseire B. Pflugers Arch. 1978; 376: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The reasons for these differences, which play a very important physiological role in the transfer of O2 from maternal to fetal blood, are not yet fully understood in structural terms (2Frier J.A. Perutz M.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 112: 97-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 3Perutz M. Mechanism of Cooperativity and Allosteric Regulations in Proteins. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom1990: 7-28Google Scholar). Whether they are due in part to the relative extents of tetramer-dimer dissociations of HbA and HbF is not known because the dissociation constant of HbF has not been reported, although it has been generally assumed to be similar to that of HbA. In this report, we show that these values differ considerably, as reported in preliminary form (4Manning J.M. Manning L.R. Jenkins W.T. Winslow R.M. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 103Google Scholar). Another important function of HbF involves its role in the amelioration of the crises associated with sickle cell anemia by administration of therapeutic agents that result in its increased synthesis; the basis for this therapy is that sickle cell anemia patients with hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin have a clinically mild disease. There are two mechanisms by which HbF could inhibit HbS polymerization in the deoxy state where sickling occurs, i.e. through the formation of mixed hybrids of HbF and HbS (α2βγ) or by a direct “sparing” effect on the solubility of HbS by the HbF tetramers themselves (5Nagel R.L. Bookchin R.M. Balazs T. Nature. 1975; 256: 667-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 6Goldberg M.A. Husson M.A. Bunn H.F. J. Biol.

A prerequisite in the first mechanism is that there be a similar proportion of dimers of oxy-HbF and oxy-HbS (which dissociates like HbA; Ref. 9Manning L.R. Jenkins W.T. Hess J.R. Vandegriff K. Winslow R.M. Manning J.M. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 775-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), which then re-associate randomly in the deoxy state to give HbS and HbF tetramers as well as the mixed hybrid. Indeed, mixed hybrid tetramer formation is demonstrable only with deoxyhemoglobin (10Park C.M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1973; 209: 237Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 11Bunn H.F. McDonough M.

Thus, the relative extents of dimer formation from HbS and HbF in the oxy state dictate the amount of mixed hybrid in the deoxy sickling conformation, but this value for HbF is not known. A question of general interest that we have addressed is whether there exists any functional inter-relationship between the two types of subunit interfaces in hemoglobin, i.e. the dimer α1β1 or α1γ1interface and the tetramer α1β2 or α1γ2 interface either with each other or with the binding region for the allosteric regulator, 2,3-DPG. The converse of the latter linkage, i.e. the shift induced by DPG on the oxy to deoxy equilibrium and hence on subunit interfaces, has been known for some time (3Perutz M. Mechanism of Cooperativity and Allosteric Regulations in Proteins. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom1990: 7-28Google Scholar). Another question that we also address here concerns the role of N-terminal acetylation of proteins, which is poorly understood (see Ref. 13Scaloni A. Barra D. Jones W.M. Manning J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15076-15084Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, and references therein). Since there is a form of fetal hemoglobin (HbF1) also present in human blood in which the N termini of its γ-chains are acetylated, we studied its tetramer-dimer dissociation properties, and we report here that this modification endows fetal hemoglobin with a significant increase in its tetramer-dimer dissociation properties. A possible general function for N-terminal acetylation is discussed. To answer these questions, we employed a rapid and sensitive method for estimation of tetramer-dimer dissociation constants by high resolution gel filtration on Superose-12 (9Manning L.R. Jenkins W.T. Hess J.R. Vandegriff K. Winslow R.M. Manning J.M. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 775-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Since the eluted peaks were narrow and symmetrical with little skewing, the data derived solely from the peak positions could be subjected to a comprehensive mathematical analysis that yielded measurements of tetramer-dimer dissociation constants (K d ) that were in the range of published values obtained by a variety of techniques (14Ackers G.K. Thompson T.E. Biochemistry. 1965; 53: 342-349Google Scholar, 15Chiancone E. Gilbert L.M. Gilbert G.A. Kellett G.L. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 2207-2211Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In the present study, we further evaluate this procedure itself, and we used it to study the relative extents of dissociation of tetramers made up of αβ dimers (HbA) compared with αγ dimers (HbF and HbF1). This study of a functional inter-relationship between different regions of the tetramer was possible because of the significant difference we found between the tetramer dissociations of HbF and HbA. To accomplish this objective, we constructed a recombinant pentasubstituted hemoglobin (referred to as HbA/F) composed of HbF subunit interfaces side chains but otherwise containing the HbA sequence. HbA (sometimes referred to as HbAo) was purified as described previously (9Manning L.R. Jenkins W.T. Hess J.R. Vandegriff K. Winslow R.M. Manning J.M. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 775-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). HbF (sometimes called HbFo), which was kindly donated by Dr. Robert Bookchin (Albert Einstein College of Medicine), was isolated from postpartum umbilical cord blood. After purification it was >95% pure as ascertained by isoelectric focusing and by FPLC on a Mono S column; no acetylated HbF1 was detected. Amino acid analysis gave the correct composition for α2γ2 including 8 Ile, an amino acid absent in HbA. Analysis by mass spectrometry showed the correct molecular weight (α-chain, 15,126; γ-chain, 15,995; kindly performed by Dr. Urooj Mirza and Dr. Brian Chait, Rockefeller University). HbF1, purified from the same source, eluted before HbF on a Pharmacia Mono S column and showed a single band upon isoelectric focusing. It had the correct mass (α-chain (calculated, 15,126; found, 15,126 ± 3) and γ-Ac chain (calculated, 16,037; found, 16,042 ± 7), thus confirming the presence of a single acetyl group per γ-chain). The construction of the five mutations was done by combining the amplified sequences bearing the relevant mutations using the strategy shown in Fig.1. Since the interface residues that were mutated were clustered in two regions (residues 43 and 51 and residues 112, 116, and 125), we designed two pairs of oligonucleotides overlapping each of these regions. Their respective sequences were TTGACTCCTTTGGGGATCTGTCCACTGCTGA and GGTCACTGTGCTGGCCATTCACTTTGGCAAAGAATTCACCCCAGAAGTGC. A second pair with their corresponding complementary sequence was also synthesized. Two other oligonucleotides were used, each overlapping one extremity of the β-coding sequence and containing a restriction site. A two-step amplification procedure adapted from the overlap extension method (19Horton R.M. Pease L.R. McPherson M.J. Directed Mutagenesis. IRL Press, Oxford, UK1991: 217-247Google Scholar) was employed. The first amplification step was done in three different tubes to obtain the three parts of the β coding sequence having the complementary mutated zones. The correct size of each amplified DNA was verified on agarose gel and purified using Geneclean (BIO 101, Inc., Vista, CA). During the second amplification step, the three parts resulting from the first amplification step were combined and amplified. The size of the total resulting coding sequence was checked on an agarose gel, purified, and digested with the appropriate restriction enzyme to be inserted into the pGS190 plasmid containing the α wild-type cDNA expression cassette. Because of the frequency of mismatches during the two-step amplification by polymerase chain reaction, it was essential to check the entire β mutated coding sequence. The full β cDNA was sequenced and the presence of only the five desired mutations was confirmed as GAG → GAT, CCT → GCT, TGT → ACT, CAT → ATT, and CCA → GAA, respectively. In pGS190, the relative orientation of the α and β expression cassettes was not relevant; thus, cloning of the β cassette into pGS190α with only one restriction enzyme was a more efficient method. Both α and β cassettes were extracted together from the pGS190αβ plasmid with a NotI digestion and inserted into the shuttle Escherichia coli/yeast plasmid pGS389, previously dephosphorylated. Once these expression cassettes were inserted, the resulting pGS389αβ plasmid was prepared in large quantity (Midi Prep, Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) and transformed into the GSY112 Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain as described (20Wagenbach M.

Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1213-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The growth of yeast containing the plasmid was performed in a New Brunswick Bio-Flo IV 20 liter fermentor but otherwise under the same conditions used previously (21Martin de Llano J.J. Manning J.M. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1206-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 22Yanase H. Cahill S. Martin de Llano J.J. Manning L.R. Schneider K. Chait B.T. Vandegriff K.M. Winslow R.M. Manning J.M. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1213-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The loss of the plasmid is strongly restricted by the presence of two auxotrophic markers on the pGS389 plasmid. Therefore, the selective growth medium is depleted of uracil and leucine. Upon completion of growth, the yeast cells were harvested and broken as described previously (20Wagenbach M. O'Rourke K. Vitay L. Weiczorek A. Hoffman S. Durfee S. Tedesco J. Stetler G. Biotechnology. 1991; 9: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 21Martin de Llano J.J. Manning J.M.

Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1213-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Purification of Hb to homogeneity was achieved on CM-52 as the CO form, as also described previously (21Martin de Llano J.J. Manning J.M. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1206-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar,22Yanase H. Cahill S. Martin de Llano J.J. Manning L.R. Schneider K. Chait B.T. Vandegriff K.M. Winslow R.M. Manning J.M. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1213-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and subsequently on a Mono S column (Pharmacia) attached to a FPLC system. We refer to this pentasubstituted recombinant hemoglobin as HbA/F. The dissociation constants (K d ) were determined by the hemoglobin concentration dependence of peak positions on a Superose-12 HR10/30 as it eluted between the positions of cross-linked tetrameric Hb and the natural dimeric Hb Rothschild as described previously in detail (9Manning L.R. Jenkins W.T. Hess J.R. Vandegriff K. Winslow R.M. Manning J.M. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 775-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The peak position used to determine the K d values was accurately measured by the Pharmacia FPLC Director software for each liganded (CO or O2) Hb concentration; the mathematical analysis of the curves has been reported (9Manning L.R. Jenkins W.T. Hess J.R. Vandegriff K. Winslow R.M. Manning J.M. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 775-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The elution positions had a high degree of precision (± 0.04 ml) and have been reproducible using the same column over at least a 2-year period. Each analysis on the Superose column took approximately 1 h for completion. Since small zone gel filtration studies on Sephadex supports have been criticized because of the possibility of sample dilution on the column and peak broadening leading to erroneous K d values (23Ackers G.K. Neurath H. Hill R.L. 3rd Ed. The Proteins. I. Academic Press, New York1975: 2-94Google Scholar), we have tested the extent to which this occurs on the Superose support used in our studies. Two types of analysis were performed as described below: one using Hb concentrations within theK d range (Fig. 6) and another using Hb concentrations higher than the K d (Table I). The values for peak widths and positions were determined by the FPLC software packages; reproducibility was 1% or better (see TableI).Table IEffect of sample volume and hemoglobin concentration on elution profiles[Hb] loadedVolume loadedPeak positionPeak width at half-heightμmμlmlμlA.20.010013.19510 20.05013.26510 20.02513.24520B.10.010013.26510 20.05013.19520 40.02513.23510Average:13.23 ± 0.04513 ± 7Either a constant HbA concentration was loaded in varying volumes (A) or varying HbA concentrations were loaded in varying volumes (B) to evaluate the effect on peak position and peak width. In B, the concentration and volume were varied as necessary so that the same total amount of Hb was loaded each time. Open table in a new tab Either a constant HbA concentration was loaded in varying volumes (A) or varying HbA concentrations were loaded in varying volumes (B) to evaluate the effect on peak position and peak width. In B, the concentration and volume were varied as necessary so that the same total amount of Hb was loaded each time. The buffer routinely used for the study of the tetramer-dimer dissociations of HbA, HbF, HbF1, and HbA/F was made by adjusting the pH of 150 mm Tris base to pH 7.5 with glacial acetic acid. For lower pH values, the appropriate amount of glacial acetic acid was added. The concentrations of hemoglobins, which were determined by amino acid analysis of hydrolyzed samples, agreed within 3% with the concentrations determined by their visible spectra. For the K d analyses, accurate dilutions were made with the Tris acetate buffers. The globin chains of HbA, HbF, and HbA/F were separated by reverse phase HPLC on a Vydac C4 column attached to a Shimadzu HPLC unit using a gradient of 20–60% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The effluent was monitored at 220 nm, and the peak retention times were determined with a Shimadzu CR 501 integrator. Amino acid analysis of the globin chains thus isolated was performed on a Beckman 6300 instrument with a System Gold data handling system. Electrospray mass spectrometric analysis of HbA/F was kindly performed on a Finnigan-MAT TSQ-700 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer by Dr. Urooj Mirza and Dr. Brian Chait. Fifty pmol of the hemoglobin sample was loaded onto a desalting protein cartridge (Michrom BioResources, Inc., Auburn, CA) and washed with 1 ml of deionized water. The sample was eluted from the cartridge using a solution of water/acetonitrile/acetic acid, 30/67.5/2.5 (v/v/v) and electrosprayed directly into the mass spectrometer. The flow rate was maintained at 6 μl/min through a 100-μm inner diameter fused silica capillary. Oxygen binding curves were determined at 37° on a modified Hem O Scan instrument (Aminco) after converting the Hb from the CO form in which it was purified to the O2form. This measurement on the Hem O Scan has been shown to give reliable results for a number of chemically modified and recombinant hemoglobins in our laboratory (21Martin de Llano J.J. Manning J.M. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1206-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 22Yanase H. Cahill S. Martin de Llano J.J. Manning L.R. Schneider K. Chait B.T. Vandegriff K.M. Winslow R.M. Manning J.M.

We chose a relatively high concentration of HbA and HbF to ensure that they would remain tetrameric. The Hill coefficient was calculated as described previously (21Martin de Llano J.J. Manning J.M. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1206-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 22Yanase H. Cahill S. Martin de Llano J.J. Manning L.R. Schneider K. Chait B.T. Vandegriff K.M. Winslow R.M. Manning J.M. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1213-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). When 2,3-DPG was present, its final concentration varied between 2 and 6 mm. The recombinant HbA/F was found to be pure by chromatography on a Pharmacia FPLC Mono S column. It showed one sharp band upon isoelectric focusing in the Isolab Resolve pH 6–8 system (20Wagenbach M. O'Rourke K. Vitay L. Weiczorek A. Hoffman S. Durfee S. Tedesco J. Stetler G. Biotechnology. 1991; 9: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 21Martin de Llano J.J. Manning J.M.

Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1213-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and its migration was consistent with a net gain of four negative charges per tetramer. By SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, there was a single band at 16 kDa in the same position as the denatured subunits of HbA and HbF. Mass spectrometric analysis of the recombinant HbA/F gave the expected mass for both subunits. Thus, the substitution in the α1β2 interface of Glu-43(β) by Asp and in the α1β1interface Pro-51(β) by Ala, Cys-112(β) by Thr, His-116(β) by Ile, and Pro-125(β) by Glu gives a calculated mass of 15,832, which was the value found by mass spectrometry. The α-chain of HbA/F did not involve any amino acid replacements, and its mass, 15,125, agreed with the calculated value. In the far ultraviolet (220–225 nm), the circular dichroism profiles of the pentasubstituted recombinant HbA/F were practically superimposable with those of recombinant HbS and of native HbA that we reported previously (21Martin de Llano J.J. Manning J.M. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1206-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), indicating that there were no adverse effects of the mutations or of the expression system on the secondary structure of the recombinant Hb. In the Soret region, the maximum ellipticity was at 424 nm, which was identical to that of natural HbA. Except for the slightly lower ellipticity at 412 nm, which was also found for some other hemoglobins (21Martin de Llano J.J. Manning J.M. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1206-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), the overall profiles in the Soret were identical, indicating no adverse effects on the heme pocket by the amino acid replacements. Separation of the globin subunits of HbA/F by HPLC (Fig. 2) indicated that the recombinant β/γ subunit containing the 5 amino acid substitutions eluted in a much more retarded position than the natural β-chain of HbA. Its elution position was close to that of the γ-chain of HbF. Amino acid analysis of each subunit isolated by HPLC (Table II) gave the expected composition, consistent with the substitution of the 5 amino acids in the recombinant subunit. For the βγ recombinant subunit, the presence of one Ile introduced by site-directed mutagenesis was diagnostic since the β-chain of HbA lacks Ile.Table IIAmino acid composition of HbA/F chainsAmino acidα-Chainβ-Chain calculatedβγ-ChainCalculatedFoundCalculatedFoundLys1110.9111111.4His109.5987.6Arg32.9332.8Asp1213.7131414.5Thr2-aThese amino acids are partially or completely destroyed during acid hydrolysis.98787.4Ser2-aThese amino acids are partially or completely destroyed during acid hydrolysis.1111.3556.7Glu57111111Pro77.3755.5Gly78.6131312.7Ala2118.6151614.61/2Cys2-aThese amino acids are partially or completely destroyed during acid hydrolysis.20.5210.5Val2-bDuring the 20 h of acid hydrolysis, Val-Val sequences are incompletely hydrolyzed.1311.5181813.92-bDuring the 20 h of acid hydrolysis, Val-Val sequences are incompletely hydrolyzed.Met2-aThese amino acids are partially or completely destroyed during acid hydrolysis.20110Ile0002-dThe values for Ile are diagnostic for a difference between the β-chain and the β/γ-chain.12-dThe values for Ile are diagnostic for a difference between the β-chain and the β/γ-chain.1.12-dThe values for Ile are diagnostic for a difference between the β-chain and the β/γ-chain.Leu18[18]2-cThe amino acids were calculated relative to the value found for Leu, which was set at 18.1818[18]2-cThe amino acids were calculated relative to the value found for Leu, which was set at 18.Tyr2-aThese amino acids are partially or completely destroyed during acid hydrolysis.32.3330.7Phe76.7887.42-a These amino acids are partially or completely destroyed during acid hydrolysis.2-b During the 20 h of acid hydrolysis, Val-Val sequences are incompletely hydrolyzed.2-c The amino acids were calculated relative to the value found for Leu, which was set at 18.2-d The values for Ile are diagnostic for a difference between the β-chain and the β/γ-chain. Open table in a new tab The results shown in Fig.3 demonstrate the high resolving capability of the gel filtration system on Superose-12 and indicate that for the same concentrations of liganded HbF and HbA, HbF eluted close to the position of undissociable cross-linked tetrameric Hb, whereas HbA eluted close to the dimeric Hb Rothschild (9Manning L.R. Jenkins W.T. Hess J.R. Vandegriff K. Winslow R.M. Manning J.M. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 775-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). These results show that tetrameric fetal hemoglobin (HbF) does not dissociate to dimers as readily as adult hemoglobin A. The dissociation constants of HbA, HbF, HbF1, and HbA/F were determined by a plot of hemoglobin concentration versus percent tetramer using amounts of hemoglobin that spanned either side of the dissociation constant. An estimate of the tetramer-dimer dissociation constant (K d ) for each hemoglobin can be read directly from the log-log plots in the insets as the corresponding values on the x axis when y = 1 (9Manning L.R. Jenkins W.T. Hess J.R. Vandegriff K. Winslow R.M. Manning J.M. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 775-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The tetramer-dimer dissociation constant of liganded HbA is shown in Fig.4 A. Its K d value, 0.68 μm, obtained by mathematical analysis of the data (inset) is in good agreement with values obtained by several different procedures (e.g. Turner et al. (24Turner G.J. Galacteros F. Doyle M.L. Hedlund B. Pettigrew O.W. Turner B.W. Smith F.R. Moopenn W. Rucknagel D.L. Ackers G.K. Protein Struct. Funct. Genet. 1992; 14: 333-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) reported a value of 1.1 μm using the large-zone exclusion method on a Sephadex support, and Benesch and Kwong (17Benesch R.E. Kwong S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13785-13786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) found 0.7 μm using a method dependent on heme dissociation from dimers. From the data of Williams and Kim (18Williams Jr., R.C. Kim H. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 2207-2211Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), who used the highly precise ultracentrifugal method, a K d value of 0.3 μm for HbA at pH 7.0 can be calculated. The correlation between our value for the K d of HbA at pH 7.5 is consistent with their results. The range of published values for theK d of HbA is consistent with the validity of the high resolution method described here and the mathematical analysis of the data. To measure the dissociation constant of liganded HbF, much lower concentrations than those used for HbA were required as suggested by the results in Fig. 3. At pH 7.5, a K d value of 0.01 μm was calculated (Fig. 4 B), indicating that the HbF tetramer is about 70 times less dissociated to dimers than HbA. The different dissociations for these hemoglobins explain an earlier report that there was no detectable equilibration between HbF (α2γ2) and HbH (β4) to form α2β2 under conditions where β4 readily equilibrated with other hemoglobins containing αβ subunits (25Huehns E.R. Beaven G.H. Stevens B.L. Biochem. J. 1964; 92: 444-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Similarly, Hb Bart's (γ4) was found to be tightly associated and not subject to equilibration with other hemoglobins. Frier and Perutz (2Frier J.A. Perutz M.F. J. Mol.

In the middle of the 18th century, tuberculosis was probably the leading cause of death world-wide. Improvements in health, hygiene, and general living conditions resulted in a steady decline in mortality. By 1952, when the anti-tuberculosis drug isonicotinic acid hydrazide (isoniazid, INH) 1The abbreviations used are: INH, isonicotinic acid hydrazide (isoniazid); ABTS, 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid); CP, catalase-peroxidase; mtCP and KatG, recombinant M. tuberculosis catalase-peroxidase expressed in E. coli;t-BuOOH, t-butyl hydroperoxide; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; IEF, isoelectric focusing; ICP-AES, induced coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy. was discovered, a further decline in mortality had taken place, and it was generally believed that the disease would eventually disappear in the Western world. Despite this optimism, the migration of populations and the spread of immunodeficiency resulting from human immunodeficiency virus infection has resulted in an accelerating rise in the incidence of tuberculosis since 1985 (2Bloom B.R. Murray C.J. Science. 1992; 257: 1055-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (1243) Google Scholar). This trend of increasing incidence of infection has also been accompanied by an increase in frequency of multi-drug-resistant strains; in the case of the immunodeficient patient, these may prove fatal within months (3Barnes P. Bloch A.B. Davidson P.T. Snider Jr., D.E. N. Engl. J. Med. 1991; 320: 1644-1650Crossref Scopus (960) Google Scholar, 4Frieden T.R. Sterling T. Pablos Mendez A. Kilburn J.O. Cauthen G.M. Dooley S.W.

Roper W.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1992; 326: 703-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). In 1993, the World Health Organization declared tuberculosis a global emergency. WHO figures from 1995 indicate that one third of the world's population is already infected with tuberculosis-causing bacillus and that more than 50 million people may already be infected with drug-resistant strains. The primary cause of multi-drug-resistant strains is poorly managed tuberculosis control programs. These facts emphasize the need for alternative treatment strategies to combat the resurgence of tuberculosis, which in turn, given the complexity of the disease, will demand a better understanding of the origins of drug resistance as well as the mechanisms of action of existing drugs such as INH. It has long been observed that INH resistance in mycobacteria has been often correlated with reduced levels of catalase activity (7Middlebrook G. Am. Rev. Tuberc. 1954; 69: 471-472PubMed Google Scholar, 8Youatt J. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1969; 99: 729-749PubMed Google Scholar). It has been confirmed that the presence of active catalase-peroxidase (CP), encoded by a single gene katG, is sufficient for INH sensitivity in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (1Zhang Y. Heym B. Allen B.

This protein belongs to a family of bifunctional heme-dependent enzymes, showing both catalase and peroxidase activities, known as hydroperoxidase I. Point mutations or deletions in M. tuberculosis katG have been found in clinical isolates with increased levels of INH resistance (9Stoeckle M.Y. Guan L. Riegler N. Weitzman I. Kreiswirth B.

Microbiol. 1995; 15: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). The requirement for akatG gene product has been further supported by the observation that transformation of a plasmid harboring this gene into INH-resistant M. tuberculosis strains can restore INH sensitivity (11Zhang Y. Garbe T. Young D. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 521-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). It appears that both the presence of a functional CP and point mutations affecting oxyR, a central regulator of peroxide stress response tightly linked to the ahpC gene, encoding alkyl hydroperoxidase, are required for INH sensitivity in M. tuberculosis (12Deretic V. Pagan-Ramos E. Zhang Y. Dhandayuthapani S. Via L.V. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 1557-1561Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 13Sherman D.R. Mdluli K. Hickey M.J. Arain T.M. Morris S.L.

Microbiol. 1996; 19: 1025-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar); however, the mechanism of action of INH in the bacterium has not yet been completely defined. It has been shown that INH is capable of being oxidized by the katG gene product (15Johnsson K. Shultz P.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 7425-7426Crossref Scopus (271) Google Scholar), although the reactive intermediates responsible for the cellular effects of INH have yet to be identified. Some evidence indicates that INH may act as an anti-metabolite of NAD and pyridoxal phosphate, both of which are important co-enzymes (16Sriprakash K.S. Ramakrishnan T. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1970; 60: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 17Bekierkunst A. Bricker A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1967; 122: 385-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 18Davis W.B. Weber M.M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1977; 12: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). It has also been suggested that INH interferes with the synthesis of the long chain α-branched, β-hydroxy fatty acids (mycolic acids), which are present in mycobacterial cell walls (19Takayama K. Wang L. David H.L. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1972; 2: 29-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 20Takayama K. Davidson L.A. Hahn F.E. Antibiotics.

Collins P.B. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1970; 63: 41-48Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, mutations in another M. tuberculosis gene, inhA, have been shown to also confer resistance to INH and ethionamide, a related anti-tuberculosis drug, in strains with normal CP activity (23Banerjee A. Duvnau E. Quemard A. Balasubramanian V. Sun Um K. Wilson T. Collins D. Lisle G. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Science. 1994; 263: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1228) Google Scholar). TheinhA gene encodes an NADH-dependent enzyme that may participate in the mycolic acid synthesis. Furthermore, enzymological studies have suggested that a katG-activated form of isoniazid may be exerting its effects through an interaction with the inhA gene product, possibly involving NADH (24Basso L.A.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8235-8241Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). A recent study has indeed isolated a radiolabeled INH-inhA gene product adduct, although the exact nature of the interaction has yet to be resolved (27Quemard A. Dessen A. Sugantino M. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Sacchettini J.C. Blanchard J.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 1561-1562Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Elucidation of the nature of the intermediates associated with INH activation and the interactions of these intermediates with other cellular targets should be facilitated by the availability of substantial quantities of pure, native M. tuberculosis CP. Other CP enzymes have been successfully purified from a variety of sources. They are generally multimers composed of identical subunits approximately 80 kDa in size.

J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1985; 98: 1055-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Although purification of native M. tuberculosis CP has in fact been achieved from the bacterium itself (36Diaz G.A. Wayne L.G. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1974; 110: 312-319Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Devi B.G. Shaila M.S. Ramakrishnan T. Gopinathan K.P. Biochem. J. 1975; 149: 187-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), the slow growth of this organism, lack of a good expression system, and concerns associated with handling large quantities of M. tuberculosis have motivated us to develop a means for the production of this protein by an alternative route. In this article, we report on the design and construction of a system for the high level expression of a recombinant, native form of M. tuberculosis CP in E. coli and compare our results to another recently developed E. coli expression system for the enzyme (38Johnsson K. Froland W.A. Schultz P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2834-2840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). We also describe the purification and the initial characterization of catalatic and peroxidatic activities for this recombinant form of M. tuberculosis CP. Oligonucleotides were synthesized on a Perkin-Elmer ABI 392 DNA synthesizer (Warrington, United Kingdom (UK)). Media reagents, KCN, K2HPO4, and KH2PO4 were obtained from Merck Ltd. (Lutterworth, UK). Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG) was from Genesys (London, UK). Precast isoelectric focusing (IEF), native and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) polyacrylamide gels, protein molecular weight standards, and Coomassie Brilliant Blue were from Pharmacia Biotech (St. Albans, UK). Restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (UK) Ltd. (Hitchin, UK). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) reagents, including Pfu polymerase, were obtained from Stratagene Ltd. (Cambridge, UK). All other chemicals mentioned in the paper were from Sigma-Aldrich Co. Ltd. (Poole, UK). Plasmid pYZ56 (1Zhang Y. Heym B. Allen B. Young D. Cole S. Nature. 1992; 358: 591-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (1094) Google Scholar) is a pUC19 derivative encoding the M. tuberculosis CP (katG gene product) with an N-terminal 40-amino acid fusion containing a portion of the E. coli lacZ gene and some additional M. tuberculosis genomic DNA sequence upstream of the GTG start codon of the katG. Purified plasmid was prepared from overnight cultures of E. coli UM255 (pro leu rpsL hsdM hsdR endI lacY katG, katE::Tn10 recA; Ref. 39Mulvey M.R. Sorby P.A. Triggs Raine B.L. Loewen P.C. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 73: 337-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) transformed with pYZ56 using Wizard Minipreps DNA purification system (Promega Ltd., Southampton, UK). This plasmid was then used as a template in the amplification of the M. tuberculosis katG gene in a PCR using two synthetic oligonucleotide primers. Primer 1 (5′-AGTGAGGAATTCGTGCCCGAGCAACAC-3′) incorporates a uniqueEcoRI site, which introduces three additional amino acids upstream of the mycobacterial GTG start codon (translated as Val). The expressed protein is thus expected to have the N-terminal sequence Met-Glu-Phe-Val. Primer 2 (5′-CAGGAAGCTTCAACCCGAATCAGCGCACGTC-3′) introduces a uniqueHindIII site downstream of the TGA stop codon. Fifty cycles (95 °C, 1 min; 52 °C, 3 min; 72 °C, 3 min), linked to a final cycle of 72 °C for 10 min, of PCR using the Stratgene PfuDNA polymerase kit were used to generate a 2218-base pair fragment encoding the M. tuberculosis CP. The fragment was gel-purified, digested with EcoRI and HindIII, and ligated into the EcoRI and HindIII sites of the IPTG-inducible expression vector pTrc99A (Pharmacia Biotech) to produce the plasmid pTBCP (Fig. 1). Initial clones were obtained by transformation of the katG-positive E. coli strain XL1-Blue MRF′ (Stratagene Ltd., Cambridge, UK) using a Gene Pulser II Apparatus (Bio-Rad Laboratories Ltd., York, UK). The screening was done in two stages. In the first stage, 10-ml cultures of E. coli strain XL1-Blue (pTBCP) arising from single colony inoculations were grown in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin overnight. The following day, 1 ml of each culture was inoculated into 100 ml of the same medium and grown at 37 °C with shaking. When an A 550 of 0.2 was reached, IPTG was added at a concentration of 0.2 mg/ml and the culture was grown overnight at 37 °C with shaking. A 10-ml aliquot from each culture was removed, and cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 3400 × g, 4 °C for 20 min. Each pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of 100 mmK2HPO4/KH2PO4 phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) and sonicated using three 10-s bursts at full power with an XL 2020 sonicator (Labcaire Systems Ltd., Avon, UK). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g, 4 °C for 20 min. Insoluble material and supernatants were assessed for the presence of overproduced, active CP as an intensely staining band on SDS-polyacrylamide gels stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and on native gradient polyacrylamide gels stained for catalase and peroxidase activities (described in the following section). In the second stage, E. coli strain UM255 was transformed with pTBCP that had been purified from an E. coli XL1-Blue (pTBCP) culture, which had demonstrated the presence of soluble, active, recombinant M. tuberculosis CP (now designatedmtCP) in stage 1. Single colonies of UM255(pTBCP) were inoculated into 10-ml aliquots of 2 × YT medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 10 μg/ml tetracycline and grown overnight at 37 °C with shaking. The following day, 5 ml of each culture was inoculated into 500 ml of the same medium and grown at 37 °C with shaking. When an A 550 of 0.2 was reached, IPTG was added at a concentration of 0.2 mg/ml and a time-course analysis of overexpression (shown under “Results”) was assessed using the same polyacrylamide gels described in the following section. Glycerol stocks were prepared of positive clones. The PCR-generated fragment encoding mtCP, used for the construction of pTBCP was sequenced on a ALF II DNA workstation (Pharmacia Biotech). Protein samples obtained from expression and purification studies were analyzed using precast 10–15% polyacrylamide gradient or IEF Phast Gels in conjunction with a Phast electrophoresis system (Pharmacia Biotech). SDS and native polyacrylamide gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue using the protocol supplied for the developer unit of the Pharmacia Phast System. Native and IEF-polyacrylamide gels were stained for either catalase or peroxidase activity. Catalase activity was visualized after a brief incubation in 0.3% hydrogen peroxide with a mixture of potassium ferrocyanide and ferric chloride using a published protocol (40Woodbury W. Spencer A.K. Stahman M.A. Anal. Biochem. 1971; 44: 301-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar, 41Wayne L.G. Diaz G.A. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 157: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Peroxidase activity was visualized with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrachloride using methods described elsewhere (41Wayne L.G. Diaz G.A. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 157: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 42Nakane P.K. Pierce G.B. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1967; 14: 929-931Crossref Scopus (749) Google Scholar). Four liters of 2 × YT medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 10 μg/ml tetracycline were inoculated with 100 ml of an overnight culture of E. coli strain UM255(pTBCP) that had been grown in the same medium. Cells were grown at 37 °C with shaking until a cell density corresponding to an A 550 of 0.2 was reached. IPTG was then added to a concentration of 0.2 mg/ml, and growth was allowed to continue for another 12 h under the same conditions. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6000 × g, 4 °C for 1 h. Cell pellets were routinely stored frozen at −20 °C at this point. Frozen cells were then thawed and resuspended in 10–15 ml of 100 mmK2HPO4/KH2PO4 buffer (pH 6.0) containing 0.5 mm EDTA (buffer A). Cells were lysed by sonication with three 30-s bursts at full power. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 9000 × g, 4 °C for 1 h. The resulting supernatant was treated with 100 μg/ml of DNase and RNase for 1 h at 4 °C and then recentrifuged as just described. A Pharmacia XK-16/40 column containing 25 ml of DEAE-Sepharose (Fast Flow) attached to a Pharmacia FPLC system was equilibrated with buffer A. The final supernatant from step i was passed through a Millipore 0.45-μm filter and loaded onto the column with a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The column was washed with 90 ml of buffer A, andmtCP was eluted with a 100-ml linear gradient of 0–1.0m NaCl in buffer A (0.5 ml/min). Two-ml fractions were collected and assayed for peroxidase and catalase activities using the methods described under “Kinetic Characterization.” Active fractions were assessed for purity using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, pooled, and then dialyzed against 10 mmK2HPO4/KH2PO4 buffer (pH 6.0) containing 0.5 mm EDTA (buffer B) at 4 °C overnight. A Pharmacia Mono Q HR 5/5 column (1 ml) attached to a Pharmacia FPLC system was equilibrated with buffer B. The dialyzed pool from step ii was briefly centrifuged, passed through a Millipore 0.45-μm filter, and loaded onto the column at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The column was washed with 10 ml of buffer B and eluted with a 30-ml linear gradient of 0–1.0m NaCl in buffer B (1 ml/min). Fractions (1 ml) were collected, and assayed and pooled as in step ii. A Pharmacia Superdex 200 HR 10/30 (24 ml) gel filtration column was equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline overnight. The pooled fractions from step iii were passed through a Millipore 0.45-μm filter and loaded onto the column with a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. Fractions (1 ml) were collected, and assayed and pooled formtCP as described in step ii. Four liters of 2 × YT medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 10 μg/ml tetracycline were inoculated with 200 ml of an overnight culture of E. coli strain UM255(pYZ56) that had been grown in the same media. Cells were grown at 37 °C, with shaking, overnight. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6000 × g, 4 °C for 1 h. Cell pellets were routinely stored frozen at −20 °C at this point. Frozen cells were then thawed and resuspended in 15 ml of 100 mmK2HPO4/KH2PO4 buffer (pH 6.0) containing 0.5 mm EDTA (buffer A). Cells were lysed by sonication with three 30-s bursts at full power. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 9000 × g, 4 °C for 1 h. The resulting supernatant was treated with 100 μg/ml DNase and RNase for 1 h at 4 °C and then recentrifuged as described previously. All subsequent chromatographic steps for purification of the fusion form of the CP were carried out as described earlier in steps ii–iv of the mtCP purification. Protein concentrations were determined as described by Bradford (43Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar) using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent. N-terminal amino acid sequencing was performed on the Mono Q-purified mtCP after gel electrophoresis and transfer to ProBlott PVDF membrane (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Samples were sequenced according to the manufacturer's instructions with a ABI 477A Protein Sequencer (Perkin-Elmer, Warrington, UK). The final purified mtCP was also analyzed by capillary electrophoresis on an ISCO model 3850 capillary electropherograph to confirm the purity of the final material. Induced coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES; Fisons ARL 3580B) was used to determine S, Fe, and Mn content of purified mtCP. A 0.1 mm solution of KCN in 10 mmK2HPO4/KH2PO4 buffer (pH 7.5) was prepared in a fume hood by dilution of a 5% (w/v) stock solution of KCN. Precautions were taken to avoid contact with the poison, and a cyanide antidote was also kept available. At the conclusion of these experiments, all cyanide-containing solutions were destroyed by the addition of sodium hypochlorite. The binding of cyanide to mtCP was followed spectrophotometrically by increasing the KCN concentration in a 1 μm enzyme solution by 10 μm increments. The potassium cyanide and enzyme mixture was incubated at 25 °C for at least 10 min prior to measuring the absorbance spectra. The absorbance change was recorded between 390 nm and 450 nm. Spectrophotometric measurements were made on a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 3 UV-visible spectrophotometer interfaced to a personal computer. Enzyme assay solutions (1.0 ml) were made up in MilliQ water containing 10 mmK2HPO4/KH2PO4 (pH 7.5) and H2O2 (25 mm). After equilibration at 25 °C for 5 min, mtCP was added and the degradation of H2O2 was monitored spectrophotometrically at 240 nm (ε240 = 43.6m−1 cm−1) as described previously (44Beers R.F. Sizer I.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1952; 195: 133-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One unit of catalase activity catalyzes the decomposition of 1 μmol of H2O2/min at 25 °C. For determination of steady-state parameters, rate measurements were made as described above except that the amount of mtCP was increased to 20 units as defined above. A 5-s delay was allowed after initiation of the reaction. The initial rate was then determined by least-squares fitting of the first 60% of the progress curve (between 0 and 100 s, depending upon the initial concentration of H2O2) to a straight line. The apparentK m for H2O2 was determined by varying the H2O2 concentration between 5 mm and 100 mm and fitting the experimental rates to the Michaelis-Menten equation by nonlinear regression using the data analysis package Igor (Wave Metrics). Enzyme assay solutions (1.0 ml) were made up in MilliQ water containing 10 mmK2HPO4/KH2PO4 (pH 7.5) containing m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid (0.5 mm) and 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS; 4 mm). After equilibration at 25 °C for 5 min,mtCP was added and the oxidation of ABTS was monitored spectrophotometrically at 405 nm (ε405 = 18.6 mm−1 cm−1) as described previously (45Pütter J. Becker R. Bergmeyer H.V. Bergmeyer J. Grasl M. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. III. Verlag Chemie, Weinheim, Germany1983: 286-293Google Scholar). One unit of peroxidase activity catalyzes the oxidation of 1 μmol of ABTS/min at 25 °C. Steady-state parameters were determined using 20 units ofmtCP as described in the procedure above with the exception that m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid was replaced witht-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BuOOH). TheK m for ABTS was determined by varying the ABTS concentration between 0.2 mm and 80 mm while maintaining a constant concentration of t-BuOOH of 23 mm. The K m for t-BuOOH was determined by holding the ABTS concentration constant at 80 mm while varying the t-BuOOH concentration between 2.9 mm and 115 mm. Initial rates were determined analogously to that described for the catalase assay above. The K m values for ABTS and t-BuOOH were estimated by fitting the appropriate experimental rates to the Michaelis-Menten equation by nonlinear regression using the data analysis package Igor (Wave Metrics). DNA sequence analysis of pTBCP revealed no sequence deviations in the M. tuberculosis katG gene when compared with the published entry in GenBank (GBM21516). The levels and time course of IPTG-induced expression of mtCP were analyzed by SDS-reducing PAGE of cell lysates of E. coli UM255 transformed with pTBCP. A prominent new protein band having an apparent molecular mass of 80 kDa appeared 1 h after induction and increased to a maximum level within 10–12 h (Fig.2). Analysis of these lysates using native polyacrylamide gels showed the presence of a diffuse band demonstrating significant levels of both catalatic and peroxidatic activities when appropriately stained (Fig.3). To further characterize themtCP and compare its properties with the fusion form of this protein produced by the pYZ56 construct, both the native and fusion proteins were purified from E. coli UM255 transformed cells.Figure 3Demonstration of enzymic activities ofmtCP by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10–15%).Gels were developed and stained as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Lanes 1 and 2, peroxidase activity stains of crude extract of UM255(pTBCP) and purified mtCP, respectively.

Most contaminating proteins were removed in the first chromatographic step using a DEAE-Sepharose (fast flow) column (Fig. 4, lane 3). ThemtCP bound to the subsequent Mono Q column eluted at 0.35m NaCl and showed an 50% increase in specific activity (Fig. 4, lane 4). Fractionation using a Superdex 200 gel filtration column yielded the final preparation at greater than 98% purity (Fig. 4, lane 5) with an estimated molecular mass of 160 kDa, suggesting that mtCP is a homodimer in the native form. Native and IEF-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicated the presence of two closely migrating bands, although the purifiedmtCP migrated as a single band of approximately 80 kDa using SDS-reducing PAGE (Fig. 4, lane 4). These multiple bands stained positively for both catalatic and peroxidatic activities (Fig.3, lanes 2 and 4) with estimated molecular mass values of 160 kDa and pI values of 3.7 and 3.75.Table IPurification of mtCP from 4 liters of cultureStepVolumeConcentrationTotal amountSpecific activityTotal unitsYieldPurification factorCat1-aCat, catalase activity; 1 unit of catalase activity catalyzes the decomposition of 1 μmol of H2O2/min at 25 °C.Per1-bPer, peroxidase activity; 1 unit of peroxidase activity catalyzes the oxidation of 1 μmol of ABTS/min at 25 °C.CatPerCatPerCatPermlmg/mlmgunits/mgunits%-foldCrude extract101911910431102823,000195,00010010011DEAE-Sepharose1292.01104637148703,000163,000858421Mono Q4.061.02441100312268,00076,100333933Superdex 2003.017.0512112504108,00025,7001313551-a Cat, catalase activity; 1 unit of catalase activity catalyzes the decomposition of 1 μmol of H2O2/min at 25 °C.1-b Per, peroxidase activity; 1 unit of peroxidase activity catalyzes the oxidation of 1 μmol of ABTS/min at 25 °C.

https://openalex.org/W2062058320,"Doppler data generated with the Pioneer 10 spacecraft's radio carrier wave between 1987 and 1995 show a 25.3-day periodicity which is related to the solar rotation. The timing data of the pulsar PSR B1257+12 also show a periodicity of 25.34 days, which has been explained as a signature of the pulsar's barycentric motion in response to the existence of a small moon-like object. However, because PSR B1257+12 is located close to the ecliptic and because the timing variations are in the range of microseconds, it is likely that the pulsar signal is affected by the same mechanism acting on the Pioneer 10 Doppler data. Hence, the hypothesized inner planet around PSR B1257+12 is probably an artifact of the heliosphere."
https://openalex.org/W2161527794,"The CREM gene encodes both activators and repressors of cAMP-induced transcription. By virtue of an alternative, intronic promoter within the gene, the ICER (Inducible cAMP Early Repressor) isoform is generated. ICER acts as a dominant negative regulator and is cAMP-inducible in various neuroendocrine cells and tissues. ICER negatively autoregulates its own expression, and appears to participate in the molecular events governing oscillatory hormonal regulations. Here we report that ICER is inducible with nerve growth factor (NGF). This is the first example of cAMP-independent induction of ICER expression. Importantly, induction by NGF occurs via a subset of the CREs present in the ICER promoter which were previously shown to direct cAMP-inducibility. ICER induction correlates with a NGF-mediated phosphorylation of CREB. Both CREB phosphorylation and ICER inducibility require an intact Ras-dependent signalling pathway. We show that increased ICER levels result in the attenuation of c-fos expression. The activation of a powerful repressor of cAMP-responsive transcription by NGF, whose transduction signalling is cAMP-independent, constitutes a notable example of nuclear cross-talk and thus is likely to have relevant physiological implications."
https://openalex.org/W2009304738,"Calcium/calmodulin (CaM) directly activates CaM-dependent protein kinase I (CaMKI) by binding to the enzyme and indirectly promotes the phosphorylation and synergistic activation of CaMKI by an exogenous kinase. We have evaluated the initial CaM-dependent activation of the unphosphorylated form of CaMKI. The kinetics of bacterially expressed human CaMKI show that the peptide syntide-2 is a relatively poor substrate, whereas the synapsin site-1 peptide is 17-fold more specific. The peptide ADR1G is 400-fold more specific than syntide-2, and its catalytic rate is among the highest reported for a kinase peptide substrate. To understand how CaM activates CaMKI, we have characterized the activation of the enzyme by CaM mutants with substitutions at hydrophobic residues. The point mutant M124Q located in the C-terminal domain of CaM produced a 57-fold increase in the CaM activation constant for CaMKI and suggests the involvement of methionine 124 in an important hydrophobic interaction with tryptophan 303 of CaMKI. Substituting two, three, and five hydrophobic residues in the N-terminal domain of CaM increased the CaM activation constant for CaMKI by 10–190-fold and lowered the maximal enzyme activity by more than 80%. Two of these N-terminal mutants of CaM do not affect the <i>K</i> <sub>m</sub> for peptide substrate but instead produce a 5–10-fold higher <i>K</i> <sub>m</sub> for ATP. This result demonstrates the critical role of the N-terminal domain of CaM in regulating the access of ATP to CaMKI."

The elements required for endogenous levels of COL1A1expression, however, have not been elucidated. The humanCOL1A1 minigene is expressed at high levels and likely harbors sequence elements required for endogenous levels of activity. Using stably transfected osteoblastic Py1a cells, we studied a series of constructs (pOBColCAT) designed to characterize further the elements required for high level of expression. pOBColCAT, which contains theCOL1A1 first intron, was expressed at 50–100-fold higher levels than ColCAT 3.6, which lacks the first intron. This difference is best explained by improved mRNA processing rather than a transcriptional effect. Furthermore, variation in activity observed with the intron deletion constructs is best explained by altered mRNA splicing. Two major regions of the human COL1A1minigene, the 3′-flanking sequences and the minigene body, were introduced into pOBColCAT to assess both transcriptional enhancing activity and the effect on mRNA stability. Analysis of the minigene body, which includes the first five exons and introns fused with the terminal six introns and exons, revealed an orientation-independent 5-fold increase in CAT activity. In contrast the 3′-flanking sequences gave rise to a modest 61% increase in CAT activity. Neither region increased the mRNA half-life of the parent construct, suggesting that CAT-specific mRNA instability elements may serve as dominant negative regulators of stability. This study suggests that other sites within the body of the COL1A1 minigene are important for high expression, e.g. during periods of rapid extracellular matrix production.

This study suggests that other sites within the body of the COL1A1 minigene are important for high expression, e.g. during periods of rapid extracellular matrix production. Type I collagen is the most abundant protein in vertebrates with levels reaching 5–65% of total protein synthesis in bone cells (1Diegelmann R.F. Peterkofsky B. Dev. Biol. 1972; 28: 443-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar,2Moen R.C. Rowe D.W. Palmiter R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3526-3530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two coordinately regulated genes, COL1A1 andCOL1A2, give rise to the mRNA transcripts, each containing 50–51 exons, which are processed, translated, and post-transcriptionally modified. The resulting procollagen chains are assembled into a heterotrimeric structure and modified further before entering into the collagen fibril, which in turn is modified by its interaction with other extracellular molecules. The primary site of regulation for this complex series of events is thought to be at the level of transcription initiation. Most studies aimed at understanding the transcriptional regulation of COL1A1 have focused on cell-specific regulatory domains within the proximal promoter, the first intron, and more distal 5′-upstream domains without attention to sequences accounting for the extremely high level of gene transcription (3Karsenty G. de Crombrugghe B.

We have been studying the regulation of the rat COL1A1 gene utilizing a family of transgenes, designated ColCAT, which are derived from the expression vector pSV2CAT. These transgenes are expressed in a tissue-specific manner in bone, tendon, and skin of transgenic mice and have been used to elucidate a bone-specific regulatory element within the distal promoter (8Bogdanovic Z. Bedalov A. Krebsbach P.H. Pavlin D. Woody C.O. Clark S.H. Thomas H.F. Rowe D.W. Kream B.E. Lichtler A.C. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1994; 9: 285-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Another element, lacking in our constructs, accounts for high collagen expression in vascular smooth muscle (9Bedalov A. Breault D.T. Sokolov B.P. Lichtler A.C. Bedalov I. Clark S.H. Mack K. Khillan J.S. Woody C.O. Kream B.E. Rowe D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4903-4909Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although these constructs are expressed in a tissue-specific manner, they are expressed at only a fraction of the level of the endogenous gene. In contrast, a human COL1A1minigene developed by Olsen et al. (10Olsen A.S. Geddis A.E. Prockop D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1117-1121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) achieves endogenous levels of expression in stably transfected NIH3T3 cells and in transgenic mice. To identify domains that might achieve endogenous levels of expression, we chose to re-derive ColCAT in a new generation of expression vectors. The parental system that was chosen, pOBCAT (11Baker C.C. Alitalo K.K. Huhtala M.-L. Knowles J. Vaheri A. Recombinant Systems in Protein Expression. Elsevier Science Publishers, Amsterdam1990: 75-86Google Scholar), eliminates the problem of cryptic splice site selection which is inherent to SV40 1The abbreviations used are: SV40, simian virus 40; tAg, small-t antigen; kb, kilobase(s); CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; UTR, untranslated region; bp, base pair(s); pA, polyadenylation. tAg-containing constructs (e.g. pSV2CAT). Instead, the pOBColCAT series of expression vectors relies on a splicing event upstream of the reporter gene between a collagen splice donor and an SV40 splice acceptor and includes most of the COL1A1 first intron. pOBColCAT contains 3.5 kb of upstream promoter, the first exon, and most of the first intron. The human COL1A1 minigene, in contrast, includes 2.3 kb of upstream promoter, the first five exons and introns fused with the terminal six introns and exons, 1.5 kb of 3′-untranslated region (UTR), and 2.0 kb of 3′-flanking sequence. Although pOBColCAT derived vectors are expressed to a much greater degree than their pSV2CAT counterparts, they continue to be expressed below the level of the endogenous COL1A1 gene. Three potential explanations for the lower level of pOBColCAT expression include 1) the absence of essential regulatory elements that are present in the minigene; 2) decreased efficiency of mRNA processing; and 3) altered stability of the mRNA transcript. To identify the elements associated with high levels of expression, we chose to study the major regions of the human COL1A1minigene by introducing them into pOBColCAT and to assess their activity in stably transfected osteoblastic Py1a cells, a model known to express high levels of type I collagen (12Raisz L.G. Fall P.M. Petersen D.N. Lichtler A. Kream B.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 17-22Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Constructs were designed 1) to determine whether or not the first intron has a role as a transcriptional enhancer; 2) to test for transcriptional enhancing activity of the COL1A1 3′-flanking sequences and to determine their effect on mRNA stability; 3) to examine the potential transcriptional enhancing activity within the first five exons and introns fused with the terminal six introns and five exons that compose the body of the COL1A1 minigene and to measure their effect on mRNA stability; and 4) to assess whether the presence of multiple splicing units and/or their identity contributes to higher levels of expression. All cell culture work involved the immortalized rat osteoblast cell line Py1a (12Raisz L.G. Fall P.M. Petersen D.N. Lichtler A. Kream B.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 17-22Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the use of standard cell culture techniques in F-12 medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Stable transfection of DNA constructs (20 μg) along with the neomycinRes gene (1 μg) was performed using calcium-phosphate precipitation (13Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl D. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley-Interscience, New York1991Google Scholar). Selection of stable transfectants began after 48 h by adding the neomycin analog G418 (100–200 μg/ml, Life Technologies, Inc.) to the medium. Selection routinely occurred within 7 days of culture with G418 and resulted in at least 100 colonies/10-cm plate; cells were expanded for 1–2 additional weeks before pooling colonies for analysis of transgene expression. Pooled populations of stably transfected cells were split and grown to confluence in 35-mm wells. Total protein in cell lysates was assayed in a fluor diffusion CAT assay as described previously (14Krebsbach P.H. Harrison J.H. Lichtler A.C. Woody C.O. Rowe D.W. Kream B.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5168-5174Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 μl of cell extract was mixed with 200 μl of reaction mix (0.1 m Tris, pH 7.8, 0.313 m chloramphenicol, and 100,000 cpm of [3H]acetyl-CoA) in a 15 × 45-mm glass scintillation tube (Kimble Glass, Inc.) and overlaid with 4 ml of nonaqueous Econofluor-2 scintillation fluid (NEN Life Science Products). Samples were assayed in a Beckman scintillation counter, and the total protein content of the extract was determined by the BCA Protein Assay (Pierce). CAT activity was analyzed by linear regression and expressed as cpm/h/μg of protein. Each 35-mm well was assayed for CAT activity, and then the values from replicate wells were averaged. Therefore one value (n = 1) was obtained for each population of cells. The percent CAT activity is given as the mean ± S.E. of the independent populations (n) of pooled stable transfections. All transfection experiments included a standard parental pOBColCAT construct (B15) in addition to one to five test constructs. CAT activity from each transfection was expressed relative to the parental construct, which was set to 100%, to allow for interassay comparison. Statistical analysis involved a one way analysis of variance followed by post hoc analysis using the Student-Newman-Keuls test. The level of significance for the analysis of variance was set at p < 0.001 and for the post-hoc test at p < 0.05. Total RNA was isolated from cells that were grown to confluence in 35-mm plates according to a modification of the Peppel/Baglioni method (15Salvatori R. Bockman R.S. Guidon P.T. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 510-512PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of RNA levels and structure was performed by Northern blot analysis, RNase protection, and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, as appropriate. Northern blot analysis was performed using 32P-labeled DNA hybridization probes generated by random oligonucleotide labeling (16Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16651) Google Scholar). The following DNA fragments were used for hybridization: CAT (XbaI toXhoI fragment, mucleotides 543–1342, from pOB25CAT), COL1A1 (HindIII toEcoRI fragment, nucleotides 1455–4758, from the humanCOL1A1 minigene), and 18 S ribosomal RNA (1.5-kbEcoRI fragment of HHCSA65, obtained from ATCC). Membranes were exposed to x-ray film and later digitized using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) for signal quantitation. Transgene structure and its level of expression relative to endogenousCOL1A1 mRNA were assessed using RNase protection analysis (17Pavlin D. Lichtler A.C. Bedalov A. Kream B.E. Harrison J.R. Thomas H.F. Gronowicz G.A. Clark S.H. Woody C.O. Rowe D.W. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). A riboprobe template was designed for use with the pOBColCAT family of vectors which reflects the correctly spliced fusion between the COL1A1 first exon and CAT. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was performed on total RNA derived from the tail tendon of transgenic mice harboring B15 (line T-254). In brief, 4–10 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed using 2.5 μg of CAT-specific oligonucleotide (5′-GCCACTCATCGCAGTACTGT-3′). Subsequent polymerase chain reaction amplification employed the same CAT-specific oligonucleotide and a rat COL1A1 exon 1-specific oligonucleotide (5′-TGAGGCCACGCATGAGCC-3′). The resulting 959-bp polymerase chain reaction product was restriction digested withNotI and PvuII to generate the 300-bp fragment that includes the splice junction between exon 1 and CAT. This fragment was then ligated into the ColCAT-Riboprobe (17Pavlin D. Lichtler A.C. Bedalov A. Kream B.E. Harrison J.R. Thomas H.F. Gronowicz G.A. Clark S.H. Woody C.O. Rowe D.W. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), which was first restriction digested with SstI, blunted with T4 DNA polymerase, and then restriction digested with NotI, generating the pOB-CAT Riboprobe B21. This construct was linearized with BglII (−226 of the COL1A1 promoter) before T3 RNA polymerase-mediated transcription. Upon RNase protection this probe gives rise to a 417-bp band corresponding to the pOBColCAT transcript as well as two bands corresponding to the endogenousCOL1A1 transcript 116 bp and 70 bp (for diagram, see Fig.5). The presence of two protected bands for the endogenous gene results from prior mutagenesis of the rat COL1A1 first exon performed to destroy the translation start site. This mutagenesis results in an 8-bp mismatch upon RNA hybridization. The half-lives of CAT mRNA and the endogenous COL1A1mRNA were determined using Northern blot analysis. Cells were grown to confluence in 35-mm wells and treated with the transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D (Sigma, 6 μg/ml) at various time points before mRNA harvest. COL1A1 half-life determinations utilized 0-, 1-, 2.5-, 9-, 18-, and 24-h time points. CAT half-life determinations utilized 0-, 1-, 3-, and 6-h time points. Time point 0 represents cells not treated with actinomycin D. Ethidium bromide staining was used to assure equal loading between samples. Northern blot signals were digitized to allow for quantitation on a PhosphorImager. The half-life for each transcript was calculated using the equation t 1/2 = 0.693/u, whereu = log(A 0/A) 2.303/t, A 0 = image value at time 0, and A = image value at time t (18Segel I.H. Biochemical Calculations. 2nd Ed. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1976: 297-299Google Scholar). The generation of most constructs required multiple cloning steps, the details of which will be provided upon request. Construct identity was confirmed by a combination of multiple restriction enzyme digests and DNA sequence analysis when appropriate. The standard nomenclature for this new family of constructs (e.g.pOB25ColCAT 3.6/1.6/0) includes three basic elements: the parent construct (e.g. pOB25) (11Baker C.C. Alitalo K.K. Huhtala M.-L. Knowles J. Vaheri A. Recombinant Systems in Protein Expression. Elsevier Science Publishers, Amsterdam1990: 75-86Google Scholar), the promoter and reporter gene (e.g. ColCAT), and a series of three numbers (e.g. 3.6/1.6/0). The first number refers to the size (in kb) of the promoter, the second number indicates the size (in kb) of the first intron and may indicate specific nucleotide deletions (e.g. 1.6Δ786–1594), and the third number indicates the size (in kb) of the fragment introduced into the enhancer polylinker present downstream of the SV40 pA signal (0 signifies no fragment). Most constructs have a plasmid name, e.g.pOB25ColCAT 3.6/1.6/0 and for simplicity a cloning number,e.g. B15. ColCAT 3.6 has been described previously (19Lichtler A. Stover M.L. Angilly J. Kream B. Rowe D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3072-3077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It contains sequences between −3518 and +115 bp of the rat COL1A1 gene, which includes upstream promoter and part of the first exon, fused to the CAT gene. This sequence was introduced into pSV2CAT, which contains the tAg splicing unit and pA signal from the SV40 virus. B15 (pOB25ColCAT 3.6/1.6/0) contains sequences between −3518 and +1594 bp of the rat COL1A1 gene, which includes the upstream promoter, first exon, and most of the first intron. This sequence was introduced into the pOB25CAT expression vector, which includes the 16 S splice acceptor site and pA signal from the SV40 virus (11Baker C.C. Alitalo K.K. Huhtala M.-L. Knowles J. Vaheri A. Recombinant Systems in Protein Expression. Elsevier Science Publishers, Amsterdam1990: 75-86Google Scholar). The pOBCAT family of vectors differs from pSV2CAT in that the SV40 tAg splicing unit has been removed. (This construct has been described previously; see Refs. 9Bedalov A. Breault D.T. Sokolov B.P. Lichtler A.C. Bedalov I. Clark S.H. Mack K. Khillan J.S. Woody C.O. Kream B.E. Rowe D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4903-4909Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and20Fall P. Breault D.T. Raisz L. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1994; 9: 1935-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar.) Human COL1A1 minigene was provided by Dr. D. Prockop and has been described previously (10Olsen A.S. Geddis A.E. Prockop D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1117-1121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, this construct contains approximately 2.3 kb of upstream promoter, exons and introns 1–5, exons and introns 47–52, as well as the 3′-UTR and about 2 kb of 3′-flanking region. The sequence between exons 5 and 47 includes the proximal 80 nucleotides of intron 5, an SalI linker and the distal 301 nucleotides of intron 46. B30 (pOB25ColCAT 3.6/1.6Δ786–1594/0) is analogous to the parent construct (B15) but has the intron sequences fromAflII to BamHI (nucleotides 786–1594) deleted. B31 (pOB25ColCAT 3.6/1.6Δ516–1594/0) excludes sequences from AsuII to BamHI (nucleotides 516–1594). B33 (pOB25ColCAT 3.6/1.6Δ342–1594/0) excludes sequences from BstEII to BamHI (nucleotides 342–1594). B46 (pOB25ColCAT 3.6/1.6Δ291–1594/0) was generated, in part, using nuclease Bal-31 and excludes sequences from nucleotide 291 to 1594. B60 (pOB25ColCAT 3.6/1.6Δ281–1594/0) excludes sequences between HinPI and BamHI (nucleotides 281–1594). B36 (pOB25ColCAT 3.6/1.6Δ516–786/0) excludes sequences between AsuII and AflII (nucleotides 516–786). B34 (pOB25ColCAT 3.6/1.6Δ342–516/0) excludes sequences between BstEII and AsuII (nucleotides 342–516). B47 (pOB25ColCAT 3.6/1.6Δ119–1594/0) has the first intron and the distal third of the first exon replaced with the 16 S splice donor signal from the SV40 virus. The 16 S signal donor was obtained as an XhoI to BamHI fragment from pOB4CAT (22Barksdale S. Baker C.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2962-2971Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and introduced into B15 in place of theNotI to BamHI fragment (nucleotides 119–1594). B18 (pOB25ColCAT 3.6/1.6/3.5) was generated by introducing and orienting a 3.5-kb ClaI-ClaI fragment from the 3′-end of the human COL1A1 minigene into the enhancer polylinker of B15. This fragment includes sequences from 74 bp upstream of the translation termination codon, the 3′-UTR, and approximately 2 kb of 3′-flanking sequence. Because this construct contains the SV40 pA signal upstream of the polylinker (and therefore upstream of the COL1A1 3′-end fragment) it was designed to assess the transcriptional enhancing activity of this region. B9 (pOB28ColCAT 3.6/1.6/3.5) is analogous to the B18 construct but differs in that the SV40 pA sequences have been omitted from the pOB28CAT (11Baker C.C. Alitalo K.K. Huhtala M.-L. Knowles J. Vaheri A. Recombinant Systems in Protein Expression. Elsevier Science Publishers, Amsterdam1990: 75-86Google Scholar) version which allows for pA to occur at the endogenous COL1A1 sites included in the 3′-end minigene fragment. The presence of the endogenous 3′-UTR in the transcripts derived from this construct adds the potential forCOL1A1-specific post-translational regulation. B40–2 (pOB25ColCAT 3.6/1.6/(1–5Δ46–51)) was generated by introducing a 3.1-kb fragment from HindIII toPmlI (nucleotides 1455–4610) from the body of the humanCOL1A1 minigene (10Olsen A.S. Geddis A.E. Prockop D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1117-1121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) into the downstream polylinker of B15, analogous to the 3′-end construct (B18). The fragment includes the distal 232 bp of the first intron through the proximal 89 bp of intron 51. In addition, the SalI site (nucleotide 2466) present in the original minigene construct has been replaced by an XhoI site. This fragment was introduced in both orientations, which resulted in the second construct B40–14 (pOB25ColCAT 3.6/1.6/(51–46Δ5–1). Because these constructs contain the SV40 pA signal upstream of the polylinker (and therefore upstream of the minigene body) they were designed to assess the transcriptional enhancing activity of this region. B41 (pOB25ColCAT 3.6/1.6 +(1–5Δ46–51)/0) was generated by introducing the 3.1-kb genomic fragment described for B40–2 into the distal portion (*) of the first intron of B15 (e.g.pOB25ColCAT 3.6/1.6 */0). This construct was designed in a configuration that would allow for proper mRNA splicing given that both ends of the fragment were derived from intronic sequences (as described above). Again, this construct was expected to provide insight into the role of this region as a transcriptional enhancer as well as its role in mRNA processing and stability. B45 (pOB25ColCAT 3.6/1.6+50-51-51/0) was generated by introducing a genomic fragment from the COL1A1 minigene containing the distal 249 bp of intron 50, exon 51, and the proximal 89 bp of intron 51 into the distal portion (*) of the first intron of B15 (e.g. pOB25ColCAT 3.6/1.6 */0). This construct was designed to assess the role of the penultimate splicing event in mRNA processing of the COL1A1 gene. B57.14 (pOB25ColCAT 3.6/1.6(11–12-12)/0) was generated by introducing a genomic fragment from the COL1A2 gene containing the distal 110 bp of intron 11, exon 12, and the proximal 280 bp of intron 12 into the distal portion (*) of the first intron of B15 (e.g. pOB25ColCAT 3.6/1.6 */0). A second construct was also generated, B57.10 (pOB25ColCAT 3.6/1.6(12–12-11)/0) with the fragment in the opposite orientation. The first construct (B57.14) was designed to assess the role of a heterologous splicing event on the mRNA processing efficiency of B15. The second construct (B57.10) was intended to serve as a control for potential transcriptional enhancing activity of this region. B15 had 50–100-fold greater expression than ColCAT 3.6 in stably transfected Py1a cells (see Fig. 1 and TableI). Northern blot analysis of total RNA derived from the same stable transfectants revealed a prominent CAT transcript, of the predicted size, from B15 compared with at least three less intense bands from ColCAT 3.6 (Fig. 1). The larger size of the full-length ColCAT 3.6 transcript compared with B15 was consistent with the fact that B15 has 450 fewer bp than ColCAT 3.6 as a result of replacing the tAg splicing unit.Table ISummary of CAT activity and mRNA half-life dataNameDetailed namenRelative CAT activity PmRNA half-life%hParent constructsColCAT 3.6 ColCAT 3.642 ± 1*NDB15 pOB25ColCAT 3.6/1.6/015100 ± 61.9 ± 0.6Intron deletion constructsB30 pOB25ColCAT 3.6/1.6 Δ 786–1594/06113 ± 62.4 ± 0.6B31 pOB25ColCAT 3.6/1.6 Δ 516–1594/0614 ± 3*NDB33 pOB25ColCAT 3.6/1.6 Δ 342–1594/0385 ± 71.2 ± 0.2B46 pOB25ColCAT 3.6/1.6 Δ 291–1594/0658 ± 8*NDB60 pOB25ColCAT 3.6/1.6 Δ 281–1594/0639 ± 9*NDB36 pOB25ColCAT 3.6/1.6 Δ 516–786/06162 ± 10*NDB34 pOB25ColCAT 3.6/1.6 Δ 342–516/06210 ± 31*NDB47 pOB25ColCAT 3.6/1.6 Δ 119–1594/0694 ± 81.0 ± 0.73′-end constructsB18 pOB25ColCAT 3.6/1.6/3.510161 ± 17*2.7 ± 1.1B9 pOB28ColCAT 3.6/1.6/3.5680 ± 62.9 ± 0.9Body/processing constructsB40–2; B40–14 pOB25ColCAT 3.6/1.6/(1–5Δ46–51)10492 ± 37*1.1 ± 0.4B41 pOB25ColCAT 3.6/1.6 + (1–5Δ46–51)/060.6 ± 0.1*3.0 ± 0.9B45 pOB25ColCAT 3.6/1.6 + (50–51–51)/0627 ± 3*NDB57.14 pOB25ColCAT 3.6/1.6 + (11–12–12)/0640 ± 6*NDB57.10 pOB25ColCAT 3.6/1.6 + (12–12–11)/0662 ± 6*NDThis data is a summary of the CAT activity and mRNA half for the B15 construct and the intron, 3′ end and body/processing constructs.

A series of internal deletions of the COL1A1 first intron was generated and tested in stably transfected cells. The specific deletions were guided, in part, by previously identified “regulatory” domains. For example, the construct B31 excludes the highly conserved AP1 binding site located between nucleotides 557 and 563 of the rat COL1A1 first intron (5Liska D.J. Slack J.L. Bornstein P.

Biochem. 1992; 118: 119-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In total, seven internal deletion constructs were generated using a combination of restriction enzyme sites and in one construct nuclease, Bal 31 digestion. Figs. 1 and 2 and Table Irepresent a summary of the CAT activity data for ColCAT 3.6, B15, and the intron deletion constructs in stably transfected Py1a cells. Deletion of the distal half of the first intron (nucleotides 786–1594) in construct B30 did not change CAT activity. Deletion to nucleotide 516 in construct B31 decreased CAT activity by 10-fold. Further deletion, however, to nucleotide 342 in construct B33 restored CAT activity to near full levels. Deletion to nucleotide 291 in construct B46 and to nucleotide 281 in construct B60 also resulted in significant drops in CAT activity. Two additional internal deletion constructs (B36 and B34) designed to characterize further the changes in activity observed between nucleotides 342 and 786 both revealed increases in CAT activity. Analysis of mRNA half-life of selected constructs revealed no change in mRNA stability (Table I). Northern blot analysis of selected constructs revealed CAT transcripts of the predicted size with the notable exception of B31 (Fig. 2, lane 3). This construct expressed less CAT mRNA that was larger in size than predicted, raising the possibility of alternative mRNA processing (e.g. cryptic splice site selection) and decreased cytoplasmic mRNA accumulation. This larger band may also be present in Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 2, but at a much smaller proportion of the total. Note the absence of this larger transcript when the COL1A1 first intron is replaced, B47 (Fig. 2, lane 5). An alternative approach to assess the role of the COL1A1first intron involved removing it entirely and replacing it with an SV40 splicing unit. Analysis of Py1a cells stably transfected with B47 revealed no change in CAT activity compared with B15 (Fig. 2 and TableI). Furthermore, Northern blot analysis revealed a single CAT transcript confirming the integrity of this splicing event (Fig. 2,lane 5) as well as no change in mRNA half-life (TableI). The slight inc"
