https://openalex.org/W2159942968,"Members of transcription factor families typically have similar DNA binding specificities yet execute unique functions in vivo. Transcription factors often bind DNA as multiprotein complexes, raising the possibility that complex formation might modify their DNA binding specificities. To test this hypothesis, we developed an experimental and computational platform, SELEX-seq, that can be used to determine the relative affinities to any DNA sequence for any transcription factor complex. Applying this method to all eight Drosophila Hox proteins, we show that they obtain novel recognition properties when they bind DNA with the dimeric cofactor Extradenticle-Homothorax (Exd). Exd-Hox specificities group into three main classes that obey Hox gene collinearity rules and DNA structure predictions suggest that anterior and posterior Hox proteins prefer DNA sequences with distinct minor groove topographies. Together, these data suggest that emergent DNA recognition properties revealed by interactions with cofactors contribute to transcription factor specificities in vivo."

Here, we show that transient inhibition of HNF4α initiates hepatocellular transformation through a microRNA-inflammatory feedback loop circuit consisting of miR-124, IL6R, STAT3, miR-24, and miR-629. Moreover, we show that, once this circuit is activated, it maintains suppression of HNF4α and sustains oncogenesis. Systemic administration of miR-124, which modulates inflammatory signaling, prevents and suppresses hepatocellular carcinogenesis by inducing tumor-specific apoptosis without toxic side effects. As we also show that this HNF4α circuit is perturbed in human hepatocellular carcinomas, our data raise the possibility that manipulation of this microRNA feedback-inflammatory loop has therapeutic potential for treating liver cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2108926259,"As nascent polypeptides exit ribosomes, they are engaged by a series of processing, targeting, and folding factors. Here, we present a selective ribosome profiling strategy that enables global monitoring of when these factors engage polypeptides in the complex cellular environment. Studies of the Escherichia coli chaperone trigger factor (TF) reveal that, though TF can interact with many polypeptides, β-barrel outer-membrane proteins are the most prominent substrates. Loss of TF leads to broad outer-membrane defects and premature, cotranslational protein translocation. Whereas in vitro studies suggested that TF is prebound to ribosomes waiting for polypeptides to emerge from the exit channel, we find that in vivo TF engages ribosomes only after ~100 amino acids are translated. Moreover, excess TF interferes with cotranslational removal of the N-terminal formyl methionine. Our studies support a triaging model in which proper protein biogenesis relies on the fine-tuned, sequential engagement of processing, targeting, and folding factors."
https://openalex.org/W2148317624,"Antigen (Ag) crosspresentation by dendritic cells (DCs) involves the presentation of internalized Ags on MHC class I molecules to initiate CD8+ T cell-mediated immunity in response to certain pathogens and tumor cells. Here, we identify the SNARE Sec22b as a specific regulator of Ag crosspresentation. Sec22b localizes to the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) and pairs to the plasma membrane SNARE syntaxin 4, which is present in phagosomes (Phgs). Depletion of Sec22b inhibits the recruitment of ER-resident proteins to Phgs and to the vacuole containing the Toxoplasma gondii parasite. In Sec22b-deficient DCs, crosspresentation is compromised after Ag phagocytosis or endocytosis and after invasion by T. gondii. Sec22b silencing inhibited Ag export to the cytosol and increased phagosomal degradation by accelerating lysosomal recruitment. Our findings provide insight into an intracellular traffic pathway required for crosspresentation and show that Sec22b-dependent recruitment of ER proteins to Phgs critically influences phagosomal functions in DCs."
https://openalex.org/W2142194813,"The poly(ADP-ribose)polymerases Tankyrase 1/2 (TNKS/TNKS2) catalyze the covalent linkage of ADP-ribose polymer chains onto target proteins, regulating their ubiquitylation, stability, and function. Dysregulation of substrate recognition by Tankyrases underlies the human disease cherubism. Tankyrases recruit specific motifs (often called RxxPDG ""hexapeptides"") in their substrates via an N-terminal region of ankyrin repeats. These ankyrin repeats form five domains termed ankyrin repeat clusters (ARCs), each predicted to bind substrate. Here we report crystal structures of a representative ARC of TNKS2 bound to targeting peptides from six substrates. Using a solution-based peptide library screen, we derive a rule-based consensus for Tankyrase substrates common to four functionally conserved ARCs. This 8-residue consensus allows us to rationalize all known Tankyrase substrates and explains the basis for cherubism-causing mutations in the Tankyrase substrate 3BP2. Structural and sequence information allows us to also predict and validate other Tankyrase targets, including Disc1, Striatin, Fat4, RAD54, BCR, and MERIT40."
https://openalex.org/W2029783610,"The cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding protein 3 (CPEB3), a regulator of local protein synthesis, is the mouse homolog of ApCPEB, a functional prion protein in Aplysia. Here, we provide evidence that CPEB3 is activated by Neuralized1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase. In hippocampal cultures, CPEB3 activated by Neuralized1-mediated ubiquitination leads both to the growth of new dendritic spines and to an increase of the GluA1 and GluA2 subunits of AMPA receptors, two CPEB3 targets essential for synaptic plasticity. Conditional overexpression of Neuralized1 similarly increases GluA1 and GluA2 and the number of spines and functional synapses in the hippocampus and is reflected in enhanced hippocampal-dependent memory and synaptic plasticity. By contrast, inhibition of Neuralized1 reduces GluA1 and GluA2 levels and impairs hippocampal-dependent memory and synaptic plasticity. These results suggest a model whereby Neuralized1-dependent ubiquitination facilitates hippocampal plasticity and hippocampal-dependent memory storage by modulating the activity of CPEB3 and CPEB3-dependent protein synthesis and synapse formation."
https://openalex.org/W2151729645,"Bipolar spindles must separate chromosomes by the appropriate distance during cell division, but mechanisms determining spindle length are poorly understood. Based on a 2D model of meiotic spindle assembly, we predicted that higher localized microtubule (MT) depolymerization rates could generate the shorter spindles observed in egg extracts of X. tropicalis compared to X. laevis. We found that katanin-dependent MT severing was increased in X. tropicalis, which, unlike X. laevis, lacks an inhibitory phosphorylation site in the katanin p60 catalytic subunit. Katanin inhibition lengthened spindles in both species. In X. tropicalis, k-fiber MT bundles that connect to chromosomes at their kinetochores extended through spindle poles, disrupting them. In both X. tropicalis extracts and the spindle simulation, a balance between k-fiber number and MT depolymerization is required to maintain spindle morphology. Thus, mechanisms have evolved in different species to scale spindle size and coordinate regulation of multiple MT populations in order to generate a robust steady-state structure.

Spindle length varies several fold among organisms and cell types to enable chromosome segregation over different length scales. Although many manipulations can alter the size and shape of the spindle in a variety of systems (Bird and Hyman, 2008Bird A.W. Hyman A.A.

In some mitotic divisions, the dimensions of the dividing mother cell may determine spindle size (Hara and Kimura, 2009Hara Y. Kimura A.

However, in the egg and large cells of the embryo, cytoplasmic mechanisms are expected to regulate the size of the spindle, which occupies a small volume relative to the cell (Hara and Kimura, 2009Hara Y.

How cytoplasmic factors coordinate spindle length with cell size is unknown. Cytoplasmic Xenopus egg extracts reconstitute many cell cycle events in vitro including meiotic spindle assembly (Maresca and Heald, 2006Maresca T.J. Heald R. Methods for studying spindle assembly and chromosome condensation in Xenopus egg extracts.Methods Mol. Biol. 2006; 322: 459-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and provide a powerful approach to investigate intrinsic mechanisms of organelle sizing in the absence of the cell. We previously compared egg extracts prepared from Xenopus laevis to those of the closely related, smaller frog Xenopus tropicalis and found that spindle size was reduced in X. tropicalis by dose-dependent cytoplasmic activities and only weakly influenced by the amount of DNA (Brown et al., 2007Brown K.S. Blower M.D. Maresca T.J. Grammer T.C. Harland R.M. Heald R. Xenopus tropicalis egg extracts provide insight into scaling of the mitotic spindle.J. Cell Biol. 2007; 176: 765-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This established a system to investigate mechanisms of spindle scaling by identifying differences in spindle MT behavior in the two extracts and then determining whether the proteins responsible function as regulatory factors. Here, we have combined computational modeling with egg extract experiments to elucidate a mechanism of scaling of spindle length in Xenopus by MT severing.

A computational model predicts Xenopus meiotic spindle organization.J. Cell Biol. 2010; 191: 1239-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) have shown that MT depolymerization activities regulate spindle length, leading us to examine this parameter in the two egg extracts. We demonstrate that the MT severing protein katanin has lower activity in X. laevis than in X. tropicalis due to inhibitory phosphorylation. A hexameric AAA ATPase, katanin stimulates the production of MT seeds and limits spindle length during meiosis in C. elegans, although its physiological role in acentrosomal vertebrate spindles is unknown (McNally et al., 2006McNally K.

In Drosophila S2 cells, katanin functions at the kinetochore, destabilizing kinetochore-MT plus-ends and contributing to chromatid separation during anaphase A, while the related severing proteins spastin and fidgetin destabilize MTs at the spindle pole during metaphase (Zhang et al., 2007aZhang D. Rogers G.C. Buster D.W. Sharp D.J. Three microtubule severing enzymes contribute to the “Pacman-flux” machinery that moves chromosomes.J. Cell Biol. 2007; 177: 231-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In addition to altering spindle length, we found that inhibition of katanin in X. tropicalis egg extract uncoupled the dynamics of interpolar spindle MTs from the MT bundles connected to chromosomes at their kinetochores (k-fibers), revealing their greater stability. We utilized our computational model of the meiotic Xenopus spindle to simulate this effect by adding k-fibers as bundled MTs with specific plus-end properties. Our model predicted that decreasing the number of k-fibers would allow a steady-state spindle structure to form. We confirmed this prediction experimentally, demonstrating that katanin regulates spindle length in part by coordinating the stability of different MT populations. Our computational simulation of a 2D spindle showed that spindle length varies dramatically with plus-end catastrophe and minus-end depolymerization rates, mechanisms that could potentially generate the spindle length scaling observed in egg extracts of X. laevis and X. tropicalis (Loughlin et al., 2010Loughlin R. Heald R. Nedelec F. A computational model predicts Xenopus meiotic spindle organization.J. Cell Biol. 2010; 191: 1239-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Since measured MT plus-end catastrophe frequencies were not significantly different between the two species (Brown et al., 2007Brown K.S. Blower M.D. Maresca T.J. Grammer T.C. Harland R.M. Heald R. Xenopus tropicalis egg extracts provide insight into scaling of the mitotic spindle.J. Cell Biol. 2007; 176: 765-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), we investigated the MT destabilization rates utilizing a flow cell assay in which taxol-stabilized, rhodamine-labeled MTs were immobilized on a coverslip and monitored by time-lapse fluorescence microscopy upon introduction of crude egg extracts. Whereas MTs persisted with a half-life of 18.8 ± 4.2 min in X. laevis extract, they disappeared with a half-life of 0.92 ± 0.52 min in X. tropicalis extract, a ∼20-fold decrease in MT stability (mean ± SD, n = 3, Figure 1A , Movie S1 available online). Like spindle length (Brown et al., 2007Brown K.S. Blower M.D. Maresca T.J. Grammer T.C. Harland R.M. Heald R. Xenopus tropicalis egg extracts provide insight into scaling of the mitotic spindle.J. Cell Biol. 2007; 176: 765-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), the MT destabilizing activity was dose dependent, since mixed extracts gave intermediate rates of MT disappearance (Figure 1B). To identify the responsible factor, antibodies were added to X. tropicalis extracts to inhibit candidate molecules including the two major kinesin-13 proteins found in egg extracts, MCAK and Kif2a, and the catalytic subunit p60 of the MT severing protein katanin (Figure 1C, Movie S2). Only katanin antibodies inhibited MT disassembly, consistent with its original purification and characterization by this assay (McNally and Thomas, 1998McNally F.J. Thomas S. Katanin is responsible for the M-phase microtubule-severing activity in Xenopus eggs.Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1847-1861Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, McNally and Vale, 1993McNally F.J.

Severing of stable microtubules by a mitotically activated protein in Xenopus egg extracts.Cell. 1991; 64: 827-839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Careful examination of MTs as they disappeared revealed the formation of gaps indicative of severing activity all along the length of MTs, and this effect was blocked by katanin p60 immunodepletion from the extract (Figure 1D). Thus, katanin-driven severing underlies the higher MT depolymerization activity observed in X. tropicalis egg extracts. To elucidate the molecular basis of differential katanin activity, we first compared its properties in egg extracts of the two species using an antibody raised against the human katanin p60, which is 84% identical to both X. laevis and X. tropicalis katanin (Figure S1A ). By western blot, katanin p60 levels were comparable in the two extracts (Figure 2A ). To test whether the observed activity difference derives from the katanin proteins themselves or from other factors in the extract, we used the flow cell assay to monitor severing activity in mixed extracts, in which one of the extracts had been immunodepleted of its endogenous katanin p60 catalytic subunit (Figure 2B). Whereas a p60-depleted X. tropicalis extract failed to accelerate MT depolymerization in X. laevis extract, severing was rapid in any reaction containing X. tropicalis p60. Addition of X. laevis extract with or without katanin did not slow MT depolymerization in X. tropicalis extract. This experiment indicates that the activity difference derives from the katanin proteins, and not from their extract environments, ruling out one possible scenario in which X. laevis extracts contain factors that protect MTs against katanin.Figure 2Comparison of X. laevis and X.

Probing for intrinsic differences in the proteins, we observed that katanin p60 localized more strongly to X. tropicalis than X. laevis spindle poles by immunofluorescence (Figures 2C and 2D). Since MT binding promotes p60 oligomerization, which is required for severing activity (Hartman and Vale, 1999Hartman J.J. Vale R.D. Microtubule disassembly by ATP-dependent oligomerization of the AAA enzyme katanin.Science. 1999; 286: 782-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), we reasoned that an increase in MT affinity could underlie the elevated activity of X. tropicalis katanin. Although katanin p60 protein sequences were 95% identical in the two species, most differences occurred in the putative MT-binding domain (Figures 2E and S1A). Consistent with this hypothesis, significantly greater amounts of X. tropicalis p60 copelleted with taxol-stabilized MTs in the presence of ATPγS, which inhibits katanin-dependent severing (Figures 2F and S1B). We purified recombinant Maltose Binding Protein (MBP)-tagged X. laevis and X. tropicalis katanin p60 to investigate how minor changes in protein sequence confer differential severing activity. Interestingly, MT affinities were similar for both, in the range of 0.8–1.0 μM (Figures S2A and S2B ). Correspondingly, MT severing activities of the pure proteins were indistinguishable, though dependent on ATP (Figures 3A and 3B , Movie S3, and Figure S2C). These results suggest that the two recombinant katanin proteins have very similar intrinsic activities and that posttranslational modification may underlie activity differences. To test phosphorylation as a potential mechanism, the recombinant p60 proteins were added to the two metaphase-arrested egg extracts in the presence of ATPγS, then modified with p-nitrobenzyl-mesylate (PNBM), retrieved, and probed for incorporation of the thio-phosphate with a nitrobenzyl-thioester specific antibody (Figure 3C). X. laevis p60 was more highly phosphorylated than X. tropicalis p60 in both extracts (Figure 3D). Close inspection of the amino acid sequences revealed a serine residue of a potential Aurora kinase consensus site at position 131 in the X. laevis p60 MT binding domain (Figure S2D). Mutation of that site to alanine (S131A) reduced mitotic phosphorylation nearly 50% in X. laevis extract, similar to the effect of the Aurora kinase inhibitor VX680 on wild-type X. laevis p60 (Figures 3C and 3D). Purified Aurora B kinase efficiently phosphorylated X. laevis p60, but not X. tropicalis p60 in vitro, and the phosphorylation of X. laevis p60 S131A was significantly reduced (Figure 3E). In contrast, large amounts of active Aurora A only weakly phosphorylated p60 in vitro (data not shown).Figure 3Phosphorylation of X. laevis Katanin Inhibits its ActivityShow full caption(A) Time course showing individual fields from a flow cell MT destabilization assay in which taxol-stabilized, Alexa 488-labeled MTs were incubated with either X. laevis (left panels) or X. tropicalis (right panels) recombinant purified p60.

Whereas X. laevis p60 and the S131E mutant or the MBP control had no significant effect on severing, both X. tropicalis p60 and X. laevis p60S131A decreased MT half-life approximately 3- to 4-fold (Figures 3F and S2E, Movie S4). Altogether, these results suggest that X. laevis katanin is inhibited by phosphorylation at Ser 131 by Aurora B kinase, while X. tropicalis katanin lacks this regulatory site. Katanin can directly depolymerize MTs, and also promote kinesin-13 driven depolymerization by exposing new MT ends (Buster et al., 2002Buster D. McNally K. McNally F.J.

Cell Biol. 2011; 13: 361-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To investigate whether its elevated activity in X. tropicalis compared to X. laevis could make shorter spindles, we introduced MT severing into our 2D meiotic spindle simulation (Loughlin et al., 2010Loughlin R. Heald R. Nedelec F. A computational model predicts Xenopus meiotic spindle organization.J. Cell Biol. 2010; 191: 1239-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The model invokes a small number of factors that organize dynamic MTs into a steady-state bipolar structure, including kin-5-dependent MT antiparallel sliding, and dynein-dependent delivery of NuMA oligomers to minus-ends which recruit kin-13 MT depolymerizing activity (Figure 4A ). The balance of MT lifetime and poleward sliding rate sets the length of the spindle (Loughlin et al., 2010Loughlin R. Heald R. Nedelec F. A computational model predicts Xenopus meiotic spindle organization.J. Cell Biol. 2010; 191: 1239-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Based on the spindle pole localization of katanin in egg extracts (Figure 2C), MT severing was coupled to NuMA, similar to how kin-13 activity was implemented in the model (Loughlin et al., 2010Loughlin R. Heald R. Nedelec F. A computational model predicts Xenopus meiotic spindle organization.J. Cell Biol. 2010; 191: 1239-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Severing events generated new dynamic plus-ends and new minus-ends subject to depolymerization by kin-13 activity. The probability of a severing event increased with NuMA density and could occur along the length of a MT, but the polar localization of NuMA biased the severing toward the minus-ends of MTs reaching the poles. Spindle length scaled linearly with the severing rate (Figures 4B and 4C). Thus, the net effect of increased katanin activity in the model is increased polar MT depolymerization and decreased spindle length. Because the model lacked centrosome- and kinetochore-associated MTs, we first examined the effect of katanin inhibition on spindles assembled around chromatin-coated beads, the simplest Xenopus spindle type most closely related to the simulation. Addition of inhibitory katanin antibodies caused on average a 4.6 μm (20%) and 5.5 μm (24%) increase in chromatin bead spindle length in X. laevis and X. tropicalis, respectively (Figure 5A ). This confirms that katanin contributes to spindle length scaling in Xenopus by accelerating MT depolymerization, and indicates that the contribution of katanin to the total MT destabilization activity is greater in X. tropicalis than in X. laevis. We next examined the effects of katanin inhibition in more complex spindles formed around X. laevis sperm that had progressed through interphase in the extract, with each sperm nucleus contributing a duplicated centrosome and paired sister kinetochores on 18 replicated chromosomes. Whereas sperm spindles formed in X. laevis extracts showed a similar length increase as chromatin bead spindles upon katanin inhibition, sperm spindles in X. tropicalis extracts became much longer, as thin and curly"

Cherubism is caused by mutations in Sh3bp2, the gene that encodes the adaptor protein 3BP2. Most identified mutations in 3BP2 lie within the peptide sequence RSPPDG. A mouse model of cherubism develops hyperactive bone-remodeling osteoclasts and systemic inflammation characterized by expansion of the myelomonocytic lineage. The mechanism by which cherubism mutations alter 3BP2 function has remained obscure. Here we show that Tankyrase, a member of the poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP) family, regulates 3BP2 stability through ADP-ribosylation and subsequent ubiquitylation by the E3-ubiquitin ligase RNF146 in osteoclasts. Cherubism mutations uncouple 3BP2 from Tankyrase-mediated protein destruction, which results in its stabilization and subsequent hyperactivation of the SRC, SYK, and VAV signaling pathways.

Gerrie J. Pritchard J. Cherubism—familial fibrous dysplasia of the jaws.J. Bone Joint Surg. Br. 1950; 32-B: 334-347PubMed Google Scholar). Interosseous fibrocystic lesions arise in cherubism patients as a result of highly activated osteoclasts and infiltrating inflammatory and mesenchymal cells. The cherubism locus was mapped to chromosome 4p16 (Tiziani et al., 1999Tiziani V. Reichenberger E. Buzzo C.L. Niazi S. Fukai N. Stiller M. Peters H. Salzano F.M. Raposo do Amaral C.M. Olsen B.R.

Genet. 1999; 65: 158-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) with subsequent identification of single missense mutations in the gene encoding the adaptor protein 3BP2 within this locus (Ueki et al., 2001Ueki Y.

Genet. 2001; 28: 125-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). 3BP2 contains an N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, a proline-rich stretch that binds to Src homology (SH) 3 domain-containing proteins, and a C-terminal SH2 domain that binds to phosphotyrosine residues (Deckert, 2006Deckert M. [The adaptor protein 3BP2 in leukocyte signaling].Med. Sci. (Paris). 2006; 22: 1081-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) (Figure 1D ). Most 3BP2 mutations associated with cherubism cluster within peptide sequence RSPPDG lying between the PH and SH2 domains. A mouse model of cherubism in which the most common disease-associated allele, P416R, was knocked into the Sh3bp2 locus develops severe osteoporosis associated with highly activated osteoclasts and demonstrated that mutation within this peptide sequence results in a gain-of-function phenotype (Ueki et al., 2007Ueki Y.

Analysis of mice harboring two copies of the cherubism allele uncovered 3BP2 as a major governor of myelomonocytic homeostatic cell numbers. Homozygous mice die of a systemic inflammation disorder at 25 weeks of age as a result of myelomonocytic infiltration of the skin, synovial lining, and visceral organs associated with elevated serum TNF-α levels, trabecular bone loss, and cortical bone erosions (Ueki et al., 2007Ueki Y.

Identification of a protein that binds to the SH3 region of Abl and is similar to Bcr and GAP-rho.Science. 1992; 257: 803-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). 3BP2 is part of a multiprotein signaling complex composed of the SRC family kinases (SFKs), SYK, and the RHO family guanine nucleotide exchange factor VAV (Deckert and Rottapel, 2006Deckert M.

Invest. 2011; 121: 3244-3257Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The biochemical basis by which cherubism mutations alter the activity of the 3BP2 adaptor protein has remained elusive. The tight cluster of mutations in the peptide sequence of 3BP2 observed in cherubism patients suggested to us that this sequence might define a protein interaction motif. Here we identify the poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP) family member Tankyrase as the protein that binds to the RSPPDG sequence and serves to repress 3BP2 protein levels through ADP-ribosylation and subsequent ubiquitylation by the E3-ubiquitin ligase RNF146. We demonstrate that cherubism mutations disrupt 3BP2 binding to Tankyrase and stabilize the 3BP2 protein. Our accompanying manuscript (Guettler et al., 2011Guettler S. LaRose J. Petsalaki E. Gish G. Scotter A. Pawson T. Rottapel R. Sicheri F. Structural basis and sequence rules for substrate recognition by Tankyrase explain the basis for cherubism disease.Cell. 2011; 147 (this issue, 1340–1354)Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar [this issue of Cell]) provides the structural basis of 3BP2 peptide recognition by the ankyrin repeats of Tankyrase, a mechanism shared by all known Tankyrase substrates. The structural insights enable us to rationalize how cherubism mutations allow 3BP2 to escape recruitment by Tankyrase. Elevated steady-state protein levels of 3BP2 observed in primary osteoclasts derived from cherubism mutant mice are associated with high levels of SRC, SYK, and VAV activity, whereas osteoclasts lacking 3BP2 are unable to normally activate SRC, SYK, and VAV. Lastly, we show that inhibition of Tankyrase in osteoclasts in vitro or depletion of Tankyrase in vivo recapitulates many of the phenotypic features of cherubism. These genetic and pharmacologic experiments provide direct evidence that Tankyrase is a negative regulator of the SRC signaling pathway through its action on 3BP2. Our study elucidates the biochemical basis underlying the pathogenesis of cherubism and uncovers Tankyrase as a previously unknown component of a regulatory pathway controlling bone homeostasis and inflammatory cytokine production. We examined the levels of 3BP2 protein expressed in osteoclast progenitors, primary bone marrow-derived macrophages from wild-type (WT) mice (Figure 1A, lanes 1 and 2) or mice harboring one (Sh3bp2KI/+) (Figure 1A, lanes 3 and 4) or two alleles (Sh3bp2KI/KI) (Figure 1A, lanes 5 and 6) of the cherubism mutation P416R. Strikingly, the steady-state level of 3BP2 was increased in macrophages derived from both the hetero- and homozygote cherubism mutant mice. Quantitative PCR indicated that the levels of sh3bp2 mRNA in macrophages were similar between the three different mice strains (Figure 1B). This observation raised the possibility that cherubism arises as a result of a gain-of-function mutation leading to the accumulation of 3BP2 protein. To determine whether the cherubism mutation altered the stability of 3BP2, we performed a cycloheximide chase experiment on WT- or Sh3bp2KI/KI-derived bone marrow macrophages. As shown in Figure 1C, the half-life of the WT 3BP2 protein was 6.5 hr compared to 31.4 hr for the cherubism mutant form of the protein. These data demonstrate that the P416R cherubism mutation increases the protein stability of 3BP2. We conjectured that the 3BP2-RSPPDG sequence might define a docking site for a negative regulatory protein responsible for controlling 3BP2 protein levels and that docking is impaired by the cherubism mutations. We used the yeast two-hybrid system with full-length 3BP2 as bait to identify 3BP2-binding proteins from a hematopoietic cell library. From this screen we identified Tankyrase 2 (TNKS2) as a potential 3BP2-interacting protein. TNKS2 is a member of the PARP family of proteins, which catalyze the addition of ADP-ribose from NAD+ to acceptor proteins. TNKS2 is most closely related to Tankyrase 1 (TNKS), a protein originally identified as a repressor of the telomerase inhibitor TRF1/TERF1 (Smith et al., 1998Smith S. Giriat I. Schmitt A. de Lange T. Tankyrase, a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase at human telomeres.Science. 1998; 282: 1484-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar). TNKS and TNKS2 contain five ankyrin repeat clusters (ARCs, see accompanying manuscript [Guettler et al., 2011Guettler S. LaRose J. Petsalaki E. Gish G. Scotter A. Pawson T. Rottapel R. Sicheri F. Structural basis and sequence rules for substrate recognition by Tankyrase explain the basis for cherubism disease.Cell. 2011; 147 (this issue, 1340–1354)Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar]), a sterile-alpha motif (SAM) domain mediating multimerization, and the PARP catalytic domain (Figure 1D). We showed that epitope-tagged versions of both TNKS and TNKS2 bind to 3BP2 in transfected HEK293T cells (Figure 1E). We next tested the capacity of 3BP2 proteins harboring any one of three independent cherubism mutations within the RSPPDG motif, R413Q, P416H, or G418R, to bind to TNKS2 and showed that none of the cherubism mutants were able to bind to TNKS2 (Figure 1F, lane 5–7). In contrast, a mutant form of 3BP2 that contains a mutation in its SH2 domain (R486K), rendering it unable to bind to phosphotyrosine-containing proteins (Sada et al., 2002Sada K. Miah S.M. Maeno K. Kyo S. Qu X. Yamamura H. Regulation of FcepsilonRI-mediated degranulation by an adaptor protein 3BP2 in rat basophilic leukemia RBL-2H3 cells.Blood. 2002; 100: 2138-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), bound to TNKS2 comparably to the WT protein (Figure 1F, lane 4). These data demonstrate that the cherubism mutations disrupt binding between 3BP2 and TNKS2. A recombinant GST-fusion protein containing the 3BP2 RSPPDG six amino acid sequence (GST-Hex) immobilized on glutathione Sepharose was sufficient to recruit TNKS2 from HEK293T cell lysates (Figure 1G, lane 5) but not resin alone or resin coupled to GST (Figure 1G, lanes 3 and 4). However, GST-Hex peptides containing any of the three cherubism mutations failed to interact with TNKS2 (Figure 1G, lanes 6–8). These data and those presented in Figure 1F show that the RSPPDG sequence in 3BP2 mutated in cherubism patients is both necessary and sufficient to mediate binding with TNKS2. We mapped the interaction between 3BP2 and TNKS2 by deletion mutagenesis. TNKS2 constructs lacking either the first or the second half of the ankyrin region bound to 3BP2, whereas binding was lost when the entire ankyrin region was deleted (Figure S1 available online). This suggests that 3BP2 likely binds to more than one of the ARCs in TNKS2 as confirmed in our accompanying manuscript (Guettler et al., 2011Guettler S. LaRose J. Petsalaki E. Gish G. Scotter A. Pawson T. Rottapel R. Sicheri F. Structural basis and sequence rules for substrate recognition by Tankyrase explain the basis for cherubism disease.Cell. 2011; 147 (this issue, 1340–1354)Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The interaction between 3BP2 and TNKS2 was not dependent on the SAM domain (Figure S1). Using fluorescence polarization, we quantified binding between the recombinant N-terminal region of TNKS2 containing all five ARCs and the 3BP2 Tankyrase-targeting peptide and determined a dissociation constant of 0.5 ± 0.1 μM (see Guettler et al., 2011Guettler S. LaRose J. Petsalaki E. Gish G. Scotter A. Pawson T. Rottapel R. Sicheri F. Structural basis and sequence rules for substrate recognition by Tankyrase explain the basis for cherubism disease.Cell. 2011; 147 (this issue, 1340–1354)Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). To determine whether 3BP2 is a TNKS2 substrate, we performed an in vitro ribosylation assay. Radioactive [32P]NAD+ was added as a source of ADP-ribose to 3BP2 immune complexes precipitated from HEK293T cells overexpressing TNKS2 and 3BP2. The reaction was resolved by SDS-PAGE and revealed by autoradiography. We observed two bands corresponding to the size of 3BP2 (∼80 kDa) and TNKS2 (∼120 kDa), respectively, or a yet to be identified copurifying protein (Figure 2A , lane 2). Ribosylation was much stronger for the higher-molecular-weight species compared to the lower-molecular-weight protein and was dependent on an intact TNKS2 SAM and PARP domain (Figure 2A, lanes 3 and 4). Addition of the PARP inhibitor PJ-34 (10 μM) at a concentration above the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) for Tankyrase was sufficient to inhibit ribosylation of both the lower- and higher-molecular-weight ribosylated species (Figure 2B, lane 3). To determine the effect of the cherubism mutation on 3BP2 ribosylation, we subjected three mutant forms of 3BP2, R413Q, P416H, or G418R, derived from cherubism patients to an in vitro ribosylation assay. Whereas WT 3BP2 and TNKS2 formed a complex and were ribosylated (Figure 2C, lane 3), none of the three cherubism mutants bound to TNKS2 nor became ribosylated (Figure 2C, lanes 4–6), suggesting that the biochemical defect observed in cherubism may result from the failure of 3BP2 to bind to TNKS2 and be modified by ADP-ribose conjugation. To confirm the identity of the ribosylated 120 kDa species present in 3BP2 immune complexes, we dissociated proteins in 1% heated SDS, reprecipitated TNKS2, and probed the immunoprecipitates with either an antibody that recognizes ADP-ribose (PAR) or an anti-TNKS2 antibody. We confirmed that TNKS2 is autoribosylated in 3BP2 immune complexes (Figure 2D, lane 3) but not in cherubism mutant 3BP2 protein complexes (Figure 2D, lanes 4–6). We next sought to determine whether endogenous 3BP2 is ribosylated in primary osteoclasts. 3BP2 immune complexes derived from WT or Sh3bp2KI/KI osteoclasts were probed with the anti-PAR antibody. We observed that endogenous 3BP2 was ribosylated and was associated with an abundantly ribosylated protein with a molecular weight similar to TNKS2 and high-molecular-weight ribosylated species of unknown identity. Ribosylation was dramatically reduced in 3BP2 protein complexes derived from osteoclasts obtained from cherubism mice (Figure 2E). Again we noticed that the level of 3BP2 protein present in the Sh3bp2KI/KI-derived osteoclasts was significantly elevated compared to the WT controls (Figure 2E, row 2). We showed that an N-terminal fragment of 3BP2 containing the RSPPDG sequence and a C-terminal fragment beginning with the RSPPDG sequence were both ribosylated by Tankyrase, showing that 3BP2 is either modified at multiple sites throughout the protein, or a single ribosylation site lies in the 13 amino acid stretch common to both constructs (Figure S2A ). Although we found that the Tankyrase-binding sequence in 3BP2 is sufficient for the recruitment of Tankyrase (see above), it remained possible that its position in 3BP2 contributes to Tankyrase recruitment and/or ribosylation. To determine the positional effects of the Tankyrase-binding sequence on 3BP2 stability and ribosylation, we created a chimeric protein in which the nonmutated RSPPDG sequence was added to the C terminus of the cherubism mutant 3BP2R413Q. Tankyrase was able to bind to the chimeric protein but was unable to alter the steady-state levels of the chimeric protein or induce ribosylation (Figures S2B–S2D). These data suggest that 3BP2 ribosylation and destabilization are sensitive to the position of the Tankyrase-binding sequence in 3BP2. We investigated whether TNKS2 could directly regulate 3BP2 protein levels. Wild-type 3BP2 or the cherubism mutant 3BP2R413Q was coexpressed with increasing amounts of the TNKS2 expression vector. We observed that whereas the steady-state level of 3BP2 was inversely related to TNKS2 protein level, the 3BP2R413Q mutant was resistant to the effects of TNKS2 overexpression (Figure S3A ). To determine whether the PARP domain was required for TNKS2-induced 3BP2 destabilization, we repeated the experiment with a PARP domain-deleted mutant form of TNKS2. Although TNKS2ΔPARP and 3BP2 formed a complex (see Figure S3B, row 3), 3BP2 protein levels were unaffected by increasing levels of TNKS2ΔPARP (Figure S3B). These data show that the ability of TNKS2 to perturb 3BP2 protein levels is not a result of binding alone but requires the intact TNKS2 catalytic domain. We sought to elucidate the mechanism underlying the regulation of 3BP2 protein stability by TNKS2. Conceivably, TNKS2-mediated ribosylation could mark 3BP2 for ubiquitylation and subsequent proteasome-mediated degradation. To test this possibility, we coexpressed 3BP2 and TNKS2 in the absence or presence of proteasome inhibitors. We observed that the diminished steady-state levels of 3BP2 resulting from coexpression of TNKS2 were reversed in the presence of proteasome inhibitors (Figure 3A ). We noticed that TNKS2 levels were diminished when coexpressed with WT 3BP2 but not cherubism mutants (Figures 1E, 1F, 2C, and 2D), suggesting that both components of the complex are rendered unstable by the interaction and stabilized by proteasome inhibition. We sought to determine whether endogenous 3BP2 was ubiquitylated in response to TNKS2 expression. A tagged version of ubiquitin was expressed in cells in the presence or absence of ectopically expressed TNKS2. Endogenous 3BP2 was then immunoprecipitated and probed by western blotting for ubiquitin modification. Whereas little ubiquitin was detected in 3BP2 immunoprecipitates in the absence of TNKS2, intense ubiquitylation of proteins present in the 3BP2 complex, seen as a diffuse smear, was induced when TNKS2 was coexpressed (Figure 3B, lane 2 versus lane 4). To determine whether TNKS2 PARP activity was required to stimulate 3BP2 ubiquitylation, we repeated the experiment in the presence of the nonselective PARP inhibitor PJ-34 and observed that the TNKS2 induction of 3BP2 ubiquitylation was blocked (Figure 3B, lanes 5 and 6). We confirmed that 3BP2 is itself ubiquitylated, by a precipitation-reprecipitation experiment under denaturing conditions (Figure S3C). These data show that endogenous 3BP2 ubiquitylation is stimulated by TNKS2 and requires PARP activity. To ascertain the form of TNKS2-dependent ubiquitin modification of 3BP2, we used a monoclonal antibody, which recognizes lysine 48 (Ub-K48), and observed that TNKS2 induced intense stepwise K48 ubiquitin modification, likely of 3BP2 (Figure 3C, lane 2). To determine the effect of the cherubism mutation on 3BP2 ubiquitylation, we expressed WT 3BP2 or the cherubism mutant 3BP2R413Q in the absence or presence of TNKS2. Whereas WT 3BP2 became polyubiquitylated in the presence of TNKS2, the 3BP2 cherubism mutant poorly incorporated ubiquitin (Figure 3C, lanes 3 and 4). The E3-ubiquitin ligase RNF146 has recently been shown to regulate the Tankyrase-dependent ubiquitylation of Axin2 (Zhang et al., 2011Zhang Y. Liu S. Mickanin C. Feng Y. Charlat O. Michaud G.A. Schirle M. Shi X. Hild M. Bauer A. et al.RNF146 is a poly(ADP-ribose)-directed E3 ligase that regulates axin degradation and Wnt signalling.Nat. Cell Biol. 2011; 13: 623-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). RNF146 may be widely employed as an ubiquitin ligase for additional Tankyrase substrates, and we tested whether RNF146 also targets ribosylated 3BP2. We showed that RNF146 binds to 3BP2 but not to a cherubism mutant or to WT 3BP2 in cells in which Tankyrase PARP activity has been inhibited by the Tankyrase-selective inhibitor XAV939 (Figures 3D and 3E). Importantly, coexpression of RNF146 abolished the detection of the 3BP2:Tankyrase complex, suggesting that RNF146 might be part of a destruction complex involving 3BP2 and Tankyrase (Figures 3D and 2E, 2nd row). Moreover, WT RNF146, but not a mutant form of the ligase lacking its ring finger or the WWE ADP-ribose-binding domain, potently stimulated K48 ubiquitylation of 3BP2 (Figure 3F). Depletion of RNF146 in HEK293T cells by three independent interfering RNA hairpin lentiviruses, which efficiently knocked down RNF146 transcript, resulted in increased steady-state levels of 3BP2 (Figures 3G and S3D), demonstrating that RNF146 is the functional E3-ligase controlling 3BP2 protein levels. Our data demonstrate that cherubism mutations result in the stabilization of 3BP2 protein as a result of loss of repression by Tankyrase. We next asked whether the cherubism-associated characteristics of an in vitro culture of osteoclasts result from elevated 3BP2 levels or from some other neomorphic changes associated with these mutations. We overexpressed WT 3BP2 or the cherubism mutant allele P416R at similar levels using retroviral transduction in the RAW264.7 monocytic cell line, which have osteoclastogenic potential (Figure 4A ). We observed that overexpression of either WT 3BP2 or the 3BP2P416R cherubism mutant induced the formation of multinucleated Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) positive cells in the absence of RANKL while no multinucleated cells were observed in empty vector-transduced control cells (Figure 4B). Moreover, RAW264.7 cells ectopically expressing either WT or a cherubism mutant variant of 3BP2 secreted high levels of TNF-α compared to vector-infected controls (Figure 4C). These results demonstrate that elevated levels of WT 3BP2 protein are sufficient to induce enhanced osteoclast formation in the absence of RANKL and increased TNF-α secretion by macrophages consistent with the idea that the basis of cherubsim results from elevated levels of 3BP2 and not due to a neomorphic protein property of the protein. 3BP2 nucleates a signaling complex that contains SRC kinases, SYK, and the guanine nucleotide exchange factor VAV (Deckert and Rottapel, 2006Deckert M. Rottapel R. The adapter 3BP2: how it plugs into leukocyte signaling.Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2006; 584: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To understand the effect of 3BP2 stabilization on the signaling pathways that 3BP2 connects to, we examined the phosphorylation levels of SRC, SYK, and VAV as a surrogate of their activation state. SRC, SYK, and VAV were highly tyrosine phosphorylated in osteoclasts derived from Sh3bp2KI/KI mice compared to osteoclasts from control mice, whereas total SYK, SRC, and VAV protein levels were similar in osteoclasts derived from both mouse strains (Figure 4D). To verify that the activities of SRC and SYK were elevated, we performed in vitro kinase assays on both proteins. Both SRC (Figure 4E) and SYK (Figure 4F) autophosphorylation levels were elevated in cherubism osteoclasts compared to normal controls. Similarly, the increased levels of VAV phosphorylation correlated with elevated levels of RAC-GTP in the osteoclasts from cherubism mice as measured by a PAK-CRIB RAC binding pull-down assay (Figure 4G, lanes 3 and 6). To test whether the failure of TNKS2-mediated negative regulation of 3BP2 observed in cherubism osteoclasts accounted for their activated phenotype, we examined whether TNKS2-deficient osteoclasts phenocopied cherubism osteoclasts. Wild-type macrophages normally complete osteoclastogenesis in vitro within 5 to 6 days when cultured in RANKL and CSF-1. We cultured bone marrow monocytes (BMMs) from WT or Tnks2−/− mice in the presence of increasing doses of RANKL for the suboptimal period of 3 days and observed an enhanced rate of in vitro osteoclastogenesis intermediate between WT and Sh3bp2KI/KI macrophages (Figure 5A , rows 1–3). Because TNKS and TNKS2 have overlapping essential function during embryonic development (Chiang et al., 2008Chiang Y.J. Hsiao S.J. Yver D. Cushman S.W. Tessarollo L. Smith S. Hodes R.J. Tankyrase 1 and tankyrase 2 are essential but redundant for mouse embryonic development.PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e2639Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), we conjectured that TNKS may also participate in 3BP2 negative regulation in osteoclasts. We observed that both tnks and tnks2 mRNAs are expressed during osteoclast differentiation (Figure 5B) and demonstrated that TNKS can bind to and PARsylate 3BP2 when coexpressed in HEK293T cells (Figures 1E and S4A). We therefore depleted tnks mRNA in the Tnks2−/− BMMs using a lentivirus shRNA specific for tnks (Figure 5C) and observed that BMMs lacking both TNKS and TNKS2 underwent accelerated osteoclastogenesis closely resembling the activated osteoclast phenotype observed in cherubism osteoclasts (Figure 5A, row 4). Moreover, we noted that in TNKS/TNKS2-depleted cells, SRC, SYK, and VAV were highly phosphorylated and 3BP2 levels were elevated (Figures 5D, lane 4 and 5E, lane 4, row 4). These results were observed with a second tnks-depleting hairpin lentivirus (data not shown). These data demonstrate that both Tankyrase family proteins participate in the repression of 3BP2 protein levels and the control of SRC, SYK, and VAV activation in macrophages and osteoclasts. Lastly, we observed that WT macrophages depleted of RNF146 similarly underwent accelerated osteoclastogenesis with elevated 3BP2 levels reminiscent of the Sh3bp2KI/KI or Tankyrase-depleted macrophages (Figures 5F, 5G, and S4B). This effect was dependent on 3BP2 as RNF146 depletion in 3BP2 knockout cells had little effect on in vitro osteoclastogenesis. RNF146 therefore controls osteoclast activity by regulating 3BP2 levels in an ADP-ribose-dependent manner.Figure S43BP2 ADP-Ribosylation Is Stimulated by TNKS, Related to Figure 5Show full caption(A) Flag-3BP2 but not the cherubism mutant Flag-3BP2R413Q is ADP-ribosylated by TNKS.

Here, we report that the lack of PKR enhances learning and memory in several behavioral tasks while increasing network excitability. In addition, loss of PKR increases the late phase of long-lasting synaptic potentiation (L-LTP) in hippocampal slices. These effects are caused by an interferon-γ (IFN-γ)-mediated selective reduction in GABAergic synaptic action. Together, our results reveal that PKR finely tunes the network activity that must be maintained while storing a given episode during learning. Because PKR activity is altered in several neurological disorders, this kinase presents a promising new target for the treatment of cognitive dysfunction. As a first step in this direction, we show that a selective PKR inhibitor replicates the Pkr−/− phenotype in WT mice, enhancing long-term memory storage and L-LTP."

Distal regulatory regions such as enhancers also play important roles in regulating gene expression, though it has been difficult to identify enhancer/promoter pairs since they can be located at varied distances from transcriptional start sites (TSS) or act in trans (Atchison and Perry, 1988Atchison M.L.

Whether enhancers exist in a similar poised state when paired with promoters carrying only repressive marks (that is, H3K27me3 but not H3K4me3) has not been investigated. The relevance of enhancers paired with inactive genes and their effect on promoter epigenetic signatures is unclear. In normal somatic cells, genes are typically expressed in a tissue-specific manner or repressed by Polycomb-repressive complex (PRC) and the associated H3K27me3 mark (Gal-Yam et al., 2008Gal-Yam E.N. Egger G. Iniguez L. Holster H. Einarsson S. Zhang X. Lin J.C. Liang G. Jones P.A. Tanay A.

USA. 2008; 105: 12979-12984Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Interestingly, PRC targets are usually repressed, yet poised for activation in ESCs, carrying the counteracting active (H3K4me3) and repressive (H3K27me3) modifications (Azuara et al., 2006Azuara V.

Therefore, repression of gene activity by PRC is reversible. Furthermore, various somatic cell types can be reprogrammed by overexpression of some key factors with essential roles in determining cellular identity (Boukamp et al., 1992Boukamp P. Chen J.

Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1989; 86: 5434-5438Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). Reprogramming is an active area of interest (Daley et al., 2011Daley G. Surani A. Tanaka E. Plath K. Reprogramming: What's Unknown?.Cell. 2011; 145: 811-812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Google Scholar), and it is not yet known how key transcriptional regulators initiate reprogramming, or if enhancers contribute to such events. To investigate the role of enhancers in detail, we use the tissue-specific autoregulatory MYOD1 gene as a model for understanding epigenetic interactions between enhancer/promoter pairs. MYOD1 has a well-characterized enhancer located ∼20 kb upstream of the TSS and contains a minimal core region of 258 base pairs (bp) that is necessary for promoter activity (Goldhamer et al., 1995Goldhamer D.J. Brunk B.P. Faerman A. King A. Shani M. Emerson Jr., C.P. Embryonic activation of the myoD gene is regulated by a highly conserved distal control element.Development. 1995; 121: 637-649Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MYOD1 is expressed in myoblasts but repressed in normal nonmuscle cells by PRC and H3K27me3 (Gal-Yam et al., 2008Gal-Yam E.N. Egger G. Iniguez L. Holster H. Einarsson S. Zhang X. Lin J.C. Liang G. Jones P.A. Tanay A. Frequent switching of Polycomb repressive marks and DNA hypermethylation in the PC3 prostate cancer cell line.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 12979-12984Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The presence of a well-defined enhancer and a requirement for this transcription factor in muscle lineage determination make MYOD1 an optimal choice for investigation of chromatin structures of an enhancer/promoter pair in a variety of transcriptional contexts. In this study, we used a high-resolution nucleosome occupancy and methylome assay (NOMe-seq) to show that the MYOD1 minimal enhancer exhibits a striking nucleosome-depleted region (NDR) that is bordered by H2A.Z containing nucleosomes marked with H3K4me1. This enhancer architecture can be associated with both active and repressed promoter states and is therefore more representative of a permissive state rather than just active enhancers. We found that the PRC-occupied promoter exhibits a multivalent epigenotype in somatic cells and retains some regulatory flexibility, consistent with MYOD1 being in a transcriptionally competent state. In keeping with this observation, the forced expression of exogenous Myod1 results in binding first at the enhancer, followed by chromatin remodeling, causing the formation of a promoter NDR and endogenous expression. Importantly, we also show that reprogramming can be multidirectional. The binding of OCT4 to the MYOD1 enhancer also precedes occupancy at the promoter, which allows for establishment of a bivalent state that is characteristic of stem cells. Thus, in two distinct contexts, the permissive enhancer state orchestrates changes at the promoter through binding of master regulatory factors. We extended our analyses genome-wide and found that permissive enhancers marked by H3K4me1 not only regulate transcriptionally active promoters, but are also paired with PRC-repressed promoters. We observed strikingly similar patterns in several somatic cell types, indicating that this is not a cell-type specific event. Our data suggest that the presence of counteracting epigenetic states at enhancer/promoter pairs ensures the correct tissue specific gene expression patterns of PRC targets, yet transcriptional flexibility is retained. These findings provide insight into the molecular events underlying reprogramming. We performed detailed epigenetic analyses on the well-characterized regulatory regions of MYOD1 using two cell lines that contained this gene in distinct transcriptional contexts. Quantitative PCR confirmed that MYOD1 is expressed in a human rhabdomyosarcoma cell line (RD) but not normal human fibroblasts (LD419; Figure 1A ). Bisulfite sequencing revealed that the MYOD1 enhancer and promoter were not permanently silenced by DNA methylation in fibroblasts (Figure 1A). ChIP assays confirmed enrichment of H3K4me3 (Figure 1B) and phosphorylated RNA polymerase II (Pol-IIP; Figure 1C) in RD cells, as well as Enhancer of Zeste 2 (EZH2; Figure 1D) and H3K27me3 (Figure 1E) in LD419 cells. Thus, the selected cell lines were suitable for studying the active (RD) and PRC-repressed (LD419) contexts of MYOD1. H2A.Z is associated with key regulatory regions of transcriptionally active and poised regulatory regions genome-wide (Barski et al., 2007Barski A. Cuddapah S. Cui K. Roh T.Y. Schones D.E. Wang Z. Wei G. Chepelev I. Zhao K.

Markoulaki S. Levine S.S. Hanna J. Lodato M.A. Sha K. Young R.A. Jaenisch R. Boyer L.A. H2AZ is enriched at polycomb complex target genes in ES cells and is necessary for lineage commitment.Cell. 2008; 135: 649-661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, H2A.Z was localized to the MYOD1 enhancer/promoter pair in expressing cells (RD; Figure 1F). We found that H2A.Z remained associated with the MYOD1 promoter even in the presence of EZH2 and H3K27me3 in fibroblasts (LD419; Figure 1F) and with the enhancer in these cells, though this distal region was devoid of H3K27me3 and EZH2 (Figures 1D and 1E). H2A.Z deposition at both proximal and distal gene regulatory regions may therefore serve as one mechanism by which PRC-regulated genes remain permissive. Previous studies have shown that H3K4me1 is localized to enhancers that act on transcriptionally active genes (Heintzman et al., 2007Heintzman N.D. Stuart R.K. Hon G. Fu Y. Ching C.W. Hawkins R.D. Barrera L.O. Van Calcar S. Qu C. Ching K.A. et al.Distinct and predictive chromatin signatures of transcriptional promoters and enhancers in the human genome.Nat.

Rubin E.M. Pennacchio L.A. Genomic views of distant-acting enhancers.Nature. 2009; 461: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). We examined H3K4me1 profiles and, as anticipated, detected this modification at the minimal enhancer in MYOD1 expressing cells (RD; Figure 1G). Unexpectedly, H3K4me1 was also detected at the enhancer in fibroblasts (LD419; Figure 1G). H3K4me1, but not the H3K4me3 mark characteristic of a bivalent promoter, extended into the TSS of MYOD1 in LD419 cells. Together, these data suggest that the repressed promoter exhibits a multivalent epigenetic signature marked by H2A.Z, H3K4me1 and H3K27me3 in somatic cells. The presence of counteracting histone modifications did not extend to the corresponding enhancer, which was only enriched for marks associated with transcriptional activity. Nucleosomes are integral to epigenetic regulation, and mapping their location is necessary to accurately view the epigenetic landscape. Taking advantage of the fact that mammalian cells are devoid of GpC methylation, we generate high-resolution nucleosome positioning maps by incubating intact nuclei with M.CviPI, a methyltransferase that recognizes GpC dinucleotides not associated with nucleosomes or tightly bound transcription factors (Kelly et al., 2010Kelly T.K. Miranda T.B. Liang G. Berman B.P. Lin J.C. Tanay A. Jones P.A. H2A.Z maintenance during mitosis reveals nucleosome shifting on mitotically silenced genes.Mol.

USA. 2011; 108: 14497-14502Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). This technique provides a digital readout of nucleosome occupancy within individual DNA modules at CpG-rich and CpG-poor regions, while retaining information regarding the endogenous methylation states. We examined nucleosome occupancy across the MYOD1 promoter and minimal enhancer in active and repressed states (Figure 2). A prominent NDR was detected in 80% of enhancer modules in cells expressing MYOD1 (RD; Figure 2A, left panel), overlapping exactly with the minimal enhancer and missing at least one nucleosome. Similar to the enhancer, we detected an NDR in approximately 70% of promoter modules in these cells (Figure 2A, right panel). Further, we found a highly positioned +1 nucleosome in 80% of promoter modules when an additional 75 bp region downstream of the TSS was included in our analyses (data not shown). Together, these data show using a high-resolution, single-molecule approach that enhancers have open configurations, similar to promoters of active genes. To determine whether NDRs were characteristic of enhancers regulating PRC- and H3K27me3-repressed promoters (Figures 1D and 1E), we examined nucleosome occupancy at the MYOD1 enhancer in fibroblasts (LD419 cells). We found a striking depletion of at least one nucleosome in approximately 40% of enhancer modules in LD419 cells, remarkably similar to actively expressing RD cells (compare Figures 2A and 2B, left panels). The presence of an NDR (Figure 2), and H2A.Z and H3K4me1 enrichment (Figures 1F and 1G), highlights the epigenetic similarities between the MYOD1 enhancer in two distinct transcriptional contexts. Unlike the enhancer, however, every promoter module was occupied by nucleosomes in LD419 cells (Figure 2B, right panel). Nucleosomes located immediately upstream of the TSS likely contribute to MYOD1 repression in somatic cells. These data show that although promoters repressed by PRC are occupied by nucleosomes, the corresponding enhancer maintains an unexpected open configuration similar to enhancers of transcriptionally active genes. Thus, specific histone modifications and transcription factors, at least that have been mapped to the enhancer in this study, do not predict the activity of the promoter, suggesting that the MYOD1 enhancer may exist in a permissive state in fibroblasts and retain the potential for gene activation in response to the appropriate signals. To determine whether the enhancer NDR underlies the permissive nature of PRC-repressed genes and facilitates reprogramming of endogenous MYOD1, we transfected LD419 cells with a plasmid expressing TAP-tagged mouse Myod1 and examined the Myod1 binding kinetics using an anti-TAP antibody. At 6 hr, Myod1 binding was not detected at either the MYOD1 enhancer or promoter (Figure 3A ). Maximal association of Myod1 at the enhancer occurred by 24 hr, at which time binding was not observed at the MYOD1 promoter (Figure 3B). These data are consistent with the presence of an NDR only at the enhancer (Figure 2), which would physically allow for Myod1 binding. By 48 hr, Myod1 not only associates with the enhancer but is also detected at the TSS of MYOD1 in fibroblasts (Figure 3C), suggesting that the promoter had been remodeled and an NDR generated, allowing Myod1 to bind. In support of this, we detected a newly formed NDR in ∼34% of individual MYOD1 promoter modules in fibroblasts at 48 hr posttransfection (LD419; Figure 3D, right panel). Interestingly, the proportion of enhancer modules exhibiting an NDR increased only marginally (<10%; Figure 3D, left panel) relative to untransfected cells (compare to Figure 2B, left panel). Despite Myod1 binding to its own regulatory regions (Figures 3B and 3C) and equal transfection (Figure S1A available online), endogenous MYOD1 mRNA expression was only detected when transfected cells were cultured in medium conditioned by RD cells (Figure S1B), suggesting a requirement for an additional factor that positively induces MYOD1 expression. Identifying specific factors is beyond the scope of this study, though possible candidates include thyroid hormones or insulin-like growth factors (Carnac et al., 1992Carnac G. Albagli-Curiel O. Vandromme M. Pinset C. Montarras D. Laudet V. Bonnieu A. 3,5,3′-Triiodothyronine positively regulates both MyoD1 gene transcription and terminal differentiation in C2 myoblasts.Mol.

Control of myogenesis in the mouse myogenic C2 cell line by medium composition and by insulin: characterization of permissive and inducible C2 myoblasts.Differentiation. 1988; 38: 28-34Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Conditioned medium results in additional promoter chromatin remodeling in transfected cells, an increase in DNA modules with an NDR (60%; Figure S1C) and acquisition of active epigenetic marks (Figures S1D–S1F). To investigate the requirement of the enhancer NDR in reprogramming events, we took advantage of the RKO colorectal cell line, which also does not express MYOD1. In contrast to fibroblasts, the enhancer and promoter of MYOD1 are occupied by nucleosomes in RKO cells (NOME-seq, data not shown), allowing us to determine the mechanistic significance of the permissive chromatin state. Thus, we transfected RKO cells with Myod1-TAP and compared Myod1 binding, as previously. We chose to examine Myod1 occupancy in these cells at 48 hr posttransfection, which was at the time point when we saw maximal Myod1 binding at the MYOD1 enhancer/promoter pair in fibroblasts (Figure 3C). Similar to our kinetic study, we see Myod1 associating with the enhancer and promoter of MYOD1 in fibroblasts (Figure 3E, black bars). In striking contrast, the MYOD1 enhancer and promoter regions in RKO cells are devoid of Myod1 binding at 48 hr posttransfection (Figure 3E, gray bars). Thus, Myod1 does not physically bind to the enhancer nor do we see subsequent binding or chromatin remodeling events at the MYOD1 promoter in these cells (Figure 3F). Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) can be generated from somatic cells by forced expression of key transcription factors, such as OCT4 (Maherali et al., 2007Maherali N. Sridharan R. Xie W.

OCT4 association with PRC targets in ESCs correlates with gene inactivity and the presence of a bivalent epigenetic promoter signature (Bernstein et al., 2006Bernstein B.E. Mikkelsen T.S. Xie X. Kamal M. Huebert D.J. Cuff J. Fry B. Meissner A. Wernig M. Plath K. et al.A bivalent chromatin structure marks key developmental genes in embryonic stem cells.Cell. 2006; 125: 315-326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4050) Google Scholar). A bivalent signature (containing both H3K4me3 and H3K27me3) in ESCs allows developmentally important genes to be poised for activation while remaining transcriptionally inactive. Interestingly, the MYOD1 enhancer contains an OCT4 consensus sequence. Critically, no such sequence exists at the promoter, providing a unique system to investigate changes in the enhancer/promoter epigenetic signature. By forcing expression of OCT4 in fibroblasts to initiate processes involved in iPSC generation, we sought to investigate the kinetic events associated with establishing a bivalent state. We transfected LD419 cells with a plasmid expressing OCT4 and examined the binding kinetics using an anti-OCT4 antibody. In mock-transfected cells (0 hr), only a minimal level of OCT4 binding was detected at both the MYOD1 enhancer and promoter (Figure 4A ). OCT4 occupancy at the enhancer occurred by 24 hr, at which time binding was not enriched at the MYOD1 promoter (Figure 4A). These data are highly similar to those observed for Myod1 (Figure 3B) and consistent with the presence of an NDR only at the enhancer (Figure 2). By 72 hr, we then detected OC"

Recent studies revealed that AQPs are likely to play a role in tumor progression and invasion. We aimed to examine the potential role of AQP5 in the progression of human breast cancer cells. Expression of AQP5 mRNA and protein was seen in human breast cancer cell line (both MCF7 and MDA-MB-231) by RT-PCR and immunoblotting analysis. Immunoperoxidase labeling of AQP5 was observed at ductal epithelial cells of human breast tissues. In benign tumor, AQP5 labeling was mainly seen at the apical domains of ductal epithelial cells. In contrast, in invasive ductal carcinoma, prominent AQP5 labeling was associated with cancer cells, whereas some ducts were unlabeled and apical polarity of AQP5 in ducts was lost. Cell proliferation (BrdU incorporation assay) and migration of MCF7 cells were significantly attenuated by lentivirus-mediated AQP5-shRNA transduction. Hyperosmotic stress induced by sorbitol treatment (100 mM, 24 h) reduced AQP5 expression in MCF7 cells, which was also associated with a significant reduction in cell proliferation and migration. Taken together, prominent AQP5 expression in breast cancer cells with the loss of polarity of ductal epithelial cells was seen during the progression of breast carcinoma. shRNA- or hyperosmotic stress-induced reduction in AQP5 expression of MCF7 cells was associated with significantly reduced cell proliferation and migration. In conclusion, AQP5 overexpression is likely to play a role in cell growth and metastasis of human breast cancer and could be a novel target for anti-breast cancer treatment."
https://openalex.org/W1981615995,"The glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) is a therapeutically important family B G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that is pleiotropically coupled to multiple signaling effectors and, with actions including regulation of insulin biosynthesis and secretion, is one of the key targets in the management of type II diabetes mellitus. However, there is limited understanding of the role of the receptor core in orthosteric ligand binding and biological activity. To assess involvement of the extracellular loop (ECL) 2 in ligand-receptor interactions and receptor activation, we performed alanine scanning mutagenesis of loop residues and assessed the impact on receptor expression and GLP-1(1-36)-NH(2) or GLP-1(7-36)-NH(2) binding and activation of three physiologically relevant signaling pathways as follows: cAMP formation, intracellular Ca(2+) (Ca(2+)(i)) mobilization, and phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (pERK1/2). Although antagonist peptide binding was unaltered, almost all mutations affected GLP-1 peptide agonist binding and/or coupling efficacy, indicating an important role in receptor activation. However, mutation of several residues displayed distinct pathway responses with respect to wild type receptor, including Arg-299 and Tyr-305, where mutation significantly enhanced both GLP-1(1-36)-NH(2)- and GLP-1(7-36)-NH(2)-mediated signaling bias for pERK1/2. In addition, mutation of Cys-296, Trp-297, Asn-300, Asn-302, and Leu-307 significantly increased GLP-1(7-36)-NH(2)-mediated signaling bias toward pERK1/2. Of all mutants studied, only mutation of Trp-306 to alanine abolished all biological activity. These data suggest a critical role of ECL2 of the GLP-1R in the activation transition(s) of the receptor and the importance of this region in the determination of both GLP-1 peptide- and pathway-specific effects."

Their accumulation results mostly from the expression of specific transporters triggered by the transcriptional factor NFAT5/TonEBP. This allows the recovery of the cell volume without increasing intracellular ionic strength. In this study we consider the assembly and dissociation of mRNA stress granules (SGs) in hypertonic-stressed cells and the role of compatible osmolytes. In agreement with in vitro results obtained on isolated mRNAs, both macromolecular crowding and a high ionic strength favor the assembly of SGs in normal rat kidney epithelial cells. However, after hours of constant hypertonicity, the slow accumulation in the cytoplasm of compatible osmolytes via specific transporters both reduces macromolecular crowding and ionic strength, thus leading to the progressive dissociation of SGs. In line with this, when cells are exposed to hypertonicity to accumulate a large amount of compatible osmolytes, the formation of SGs is severely impaired, and cells increase their chances of survival to another hypertonic episode. Altogether, these results indicate that the impact of compatible osmolytes on the mRNA-associated machineries and especially that associated with SGs may play an important role in cell resistance and adaption to hyperosmolarity in many tissues like kidney and liver.

We then analyzed whether the uptake of compatible osmolytes like betaine, taurine, and myo-inositol, which reduces excluded volume interactions, could lead to SG disassembly. In addition, in cells preconditioned to hypertonicity, we investigated the putative impact of compatible osmolyte accumulation on SG assembly and, as a consequence, their resistance to osmotic challenge. In light of the results, we propose that the maintenance of cell homeostasis, thanks to compatible osmolytes, may be of particular importance in preventing the formation of SGs and maintaining the mRNA-associated machineries under chronic hypertonicity, with possible applications in many tissues.

NRK (proximal tubule)-52E cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mm l-glutamine, and 1% antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin) in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. The osmolality of the DMEM with 5% (v/v) FBS is considered to be 320 mosmol/kg (referred here as isotonic). The hypertonicity of the medium was adjusted by adding NaCl to the osmolalities as indicated on the figures. Cells were counted using a Malassez hemocytometer. The number of living cells was estimated by trypan blue exclusion. mRNAs and MTs were imaged by AFM under macromolecular crowding conditions as previously described (32Pastré D. Hamon L. Mechulam A. Sorel I. Baconnais S. Curmi P.A. Le Cam E. Piétrement O. Atomic force microscopy imaging of DNA under macromolecular crowding conditions.Biomacromolecules. 2007; 8: 3712-3717Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 μl of solutions containing mRNA molecules (2 nm) or taxol-stabilized MTs (20 μm tubulin, 5 μm taxol) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and different polyethylene glycol (PEG) and KCl concentrations were deposited onto NiCl2 pretreated mica for 1 min. Samples were then thoroughly rinsed with 0.02% uranyl acetate. Finally, the mica was dried with a filter paper. AFM imaging was carried out using a Nanoscope IIIa AFM (Veeco Instrument) in tapping mode with silicon cantilevers AC160TS (Olympus). The scan frequency was typically 1 Hz per line, and the modulation amplitude was of about a few nanometers. Tubulin was purified from sheep brain crude extracts. Before use, a cycle of tubulin polymerization was performed in 50 mm MES-KOH, pH 6.8, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm EDTA, 6 mm MgCl2, 0.6 mm GTP, 30% glycerol. MTs were sedimented by centrifugation (52,000 × g, 30 min at 37 °C), at the end of which the MT pellet was resuspended in 25 mm MES-KOH, pH 6.8, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, and disassembled at 4 °C for 20 min. Tubulin aggregates were finally eliminated by a further centrifugation at 4 °C (52,000 × g, 20 min). Tubulin concentration was determined by spectrophotometry using an extinction coefficient of 1.2 mg−1 × cm2 at 278 nm. Plasmid pSP72–2Luc was used as a template for synthesis by T7 polymerase of 2Luc mRNAs (3000 nucleotides). After transcription, unincorporated NTPs were removed by gel filtration through a NAP-5 column (GE Healthcare), and mRNAs were further isolated with RNAble (Eurobio) following the manufacturer's recommendation. NRK cells were grown to confluency and exposed to hypertonicity (uptake) or to isotonicity (efflux) under conditions specified in the figure captions. Cells were rapidly washed with adjusted PBS to maintain a constant osmolarity and avoid the release of organic osmolytes. Cells were then scraped off in 200 μl of PBS and analyzed by one-dimensional 1H NMR spectroscopy without further treatment. A 10-μl aliquot was used to quantify by hemacytometry the number of cells analyzed by NMR. NMR spectra were acquired at 20 °C on a Bruker Avance 600 spectrometer. All experiments were performed on 60-μl samples with a MATCH system (Cortecnet, Paris, France). The water signal was suppressed using the Watergate method. Each spectrum was obtained after 64 scans. Spectra were processed with Topspin 2.0 (Bruker). To have statistically relevant results, three different samples were used for each condition. 2,2-Dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonic acid was added as an external reference in pure D20. The area of betaine at 3.25 ppm peak was calculated relative to this normalized area and then divided by the number of cells (arbitrary units (a.u.); 1 a.u. corresponds to 72 fmol of betaine per NRK cell for all figures). NRK cells grown on plastic dishes were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, 200 mm sucrose for 20 min at 37 °C. After fixation, cells were then washed and incubated for 1 h with mouse monoclonal anti-tubulin antibody E7 (1:2000 dilution), a mouse anti-HuR antibody (Molecular Probes, 10 μg/ml), and a rabbit anti-YB-1 (produced as described in Davydova et al. (38Davydova E.K. Evdokimova V.M. Ovchinnikov L.P. Hershey J.W. Overexpression in COS cells of p50, the major core protein associated with mRNA, results in translation inhibition.Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2911-2916Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar)). Cells were washed extensively in PBS and incubated for 1 h with fluorochrome (Alexa Fluor®488 and -555)-coupled secondary antibodies (Invitrogen) in blocking solution. For statistics, the mean granule area was measured using ImageJ over at least 500 granules coming from at least 10 different representative cells. Cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and supernatants were collected. Proteins were separated on 12% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred onto a PVDF membrane (Invitrogen). The membranes were blocked in 5% (w/v) nonfat dried milk, PBS for 30 min at room temperature (20 °C) and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with primary antibodies (anti-phospho-eIF2α antibodies (Cell Signaling, 1:2000 dilution) and anti-GAPDH (Abcam, 1:5000). Bound antibodies were detected and quantified using anti-rabbit-IRDye 800 or anti-mouse-IRDye 680 secondary antibodies (Odyssey, 1:5000 dilution) with an Odyssey imaging system (LI-COR Biosciences). The cDNA encoding the full-length YB-1 was amplified by PCR and cloned into the XhoI and BamH1 sites of the pEGFP-C3 vector (Clontech). PCR-amplified products were then sequenced. NRK cells were transfected with plasmid DNA by using the NucleofectorTM technology. All macromolecular complexes in the cell cytoplasm are a priori sensitive to exacerbated excluded volume interactions (39Minton A.P. Influence of excluded volume upon macromolecular structure and associations in “crowded” media.Curr. Opin Biotechnol. 1997; 8: 65-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), which is an important aspect of macromolecular crowding. However, in the case of hypertonicity, charged macromolecules are likely to be more sensitive due to the uptake of inorganic ions (K+, Na+, Cl−), which neutralize charged surfaces and screen electrostatic repulsion. Consequently, in contrast with oppositely charged biomacromolecules, excluded volume interactions between two like-charged biomacromolecules are promoted by high ionic strength (31Tang J.X. Ito T. Tao T. Traub P. Janmey P.A. Opposite effects of electrostatics and steric exclusion on bundle formation by F-actin and other filamentous polyelectrolytes.Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12600-12607Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Among these, mRNA and MTs may be particularly sensitive because of their highly negatively charged surface. The expected results of a self-attraction mediated by excluded volume interactions are the formation of mRNA granules and MT bundles, respectively. To illustrate these theoretical predictions, we analyzed by AFM in vitro formation of MT bundles and mRNA granules under macromolecular crowding condition using PEG, a neutral polymer, to mimic macromolecular crowding (Fig. 1A). We found that high molecular weight PEG Mr 35,000 (PEG 35K) induced mRNA aggregation and MT bundling, whereas PEG Mr 1000, which is not large enough to trigger macromolecular crowding-induced attraction, was inefficient. Macromolecular crowding can then induce MT bundling and mRNA granule formation via excluded volume interactions. In addition, as stated above, ionic strength is also an important parameter that promotes self-attraction of like-charged macromolecules. Accordingly, we observed that at PEG 35K concentrations below the threshold values for mRNA granule assembly and MT bundling, respectively, increasing KCl concentration leads to the appearance of mRNA granules and MT bundles (Fig. 1B). In contrast, the addition of betaine to obtain a similar osmolality without increasing the ionic strength fails to induce mRNA aggregation and MT bundling. In addition to these results, we can remark that MT bundling occurs at very low PEG 35K concentrations (∼1% w/v) compared with that required for mRNA granule formation (∼20%). This could be due to the large interacting surface between MTs in bundles (30Marenduzzo D. Finan K. Cook P.R. The depletion attraction. An underappreciated force driving cellular organization.J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 681-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) compared with that of mRNAs and the heterogeneous charge distribution of MTs with some positive charge on the MT body (40Baker N.A. Sept D. Joseph S. Holst M.J. McCammon J.A. Electrostatics of nanosystems. Application to microtubules and the ribosome.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 10037-10041Crossref PubMed Scopus (5905) Google Scholar) and a highly negatively charged C-terminal tail that facilitates short-ranged electrostatic attraction. We may then wonder why MTs do not naturally form bundles in the cell cytoplasm, which is naturally crowded with macromolecules (27Ellis R.J. Macromolecular crowding. Obvious but underappreciated.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 597-604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1752) Google Scholar, 28Zimmerman S.B. Minton A.P. Macromolecular crowding. Biochemical, biophysical, and physiological consequences.Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1993; 22: 27-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1279) Google Scholar, 29Minton A.P. Implications of macromolecular crowding for protein assembly.Curr. Opin Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 34-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). In fact, MT diffusion in the cell cytoplasm is hindered by obstacles like actin filaments (41Luby-Phelps K. Cytoarchitecture and physical properties of cytoplasm. Volume, viscosity, diffusion, intracellular surface area.Int. Rev. Cytol. 2000; 192: 189-221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which can slow down the bundling rate (42Hamon L. Savarin P. Curmi P.A. Pastré D. Rapid assembly and collective behavior of microtubule bundles in the presence of polyamines.Biophys. J. 2011; 101: 205-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and MTs are highly dynamical polymers, which reduces their chance to form bundles because of their limited lifetime. In line with this, taxol, an agent that stabilizes MTs, promotes the formation of MT bundles in cells (43De Brabander M. Geuens G. Nuydens R. Willebrords R. De Mey J. Taxol induces the assembly of free microtubules in living cells and blocks the organizing capacity of the centrosomes and kinetochores.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1981; 78: 5608-5612Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Interestingly, hypertonicity also favors the formation of MT bundles in taxol-treated cells, whereas hypotonicity inhibits their formation (supplemental Fig. S1). Regarding the high PEG 35K concentration required to form mRNA granules in vitro, we should note that multiple mRNA protein partners are associated with mRNAs in SGs, like the prion-like protein TIA-1, which may act in combination with macromolecular crowding to favor the formation of SGs in cells. For example, when YB-1, a major mRNA-binding protein (44Evdokimova V. Ruzanov P. Imataka H. Raught B. Svitkin Y. Ovchinnikov L.P. Sonenberg N. The major mRNA-associated protein YB-1 is a potent 5′ cap-dependent mRNA stabilizer.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5491-5502Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), is mixed with mRNA to form ribonucleoprotein particles, the PEG concentration required to trigger in vitro the compaction is lower than that needed for naked mRNAs (supplemental Fig. S2). Given the AFM results, we explored how hypertonicity leads to the formation of SGs in NRK cells and whether MT bundling occurs simultaneously. To detect the formation of SGs, we used YB-1, which is an interesting marker to track the formation of SGs because of its cytoplasmic location and its binding to mRNA before and after stress (45Chernov K.G. Barbet A. Hamon L. Ovchinnikov L.P. Curmi P.A. Pastré D. Role of microtubules in stress granule assembly. Microtubule dynamical instability favors the formation of micrometric stress granules in cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 36569-36580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In control experiments (supplemental Fig. S3) we confirmed that YB1 is indeed present in SGs and co-localizes with other SGs markers like HuR (46Tourrière H. Chebli K. Zekri L. Courselaud B. Blanchard J.M. Bertrand E. Tazi J. The RasGAP-associated endoribonuclease G3BP assembles stress granules.J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 823-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). SGs were detected for NaCl- and sucrose-mediated hypertonic shocks but not with molecules that cross the cell membrane like urea (Fig. 2), thus indicating that these granules were truly of osmotic origin. The formation of YB-1-containing SGs was observed above 520 mosmol/kg (Fig. 3A). These granules shared the typical properties of other SGs related to oxidative stress or hyperthermia (47Kedersha N.

https://openalex.org/W2094601641,"RUNX1 encodes a DNA binding subunit of the core-binding transcription factors and is frequently mutated in acute leukemia, therapy-related leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. Mutations in RUNX1 are thought to confer upon hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) a pre-leukemic state, but the fundamental properties of Runx1 deficient pre-leukemic HSCs are not well defined. Here we show that Runx1 deficiency decreases both apoptosis and proliferation, but only minimally impacts the frequency of long term repopulating HSCs (LT-HSCs). It has been variously reported that Runx1 loss increases LT-HSC numbers, decreases LT-HSC numbers, or causes age-related HSC exhaustion. We attempt to resolve these discrepancies by showing that Runx1 deficiency alters the expression of several key HSC markers, and that the number of functional LT-HSCs varies depending on the criteria used to score them. Finally, we identify genes and pathways, including the cell cycle and p53 pathways that are dysregulated in Runx1 deficient HSCs."
https://openalex.org/W2046125604,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play critical roles in diverse cellular events through their effects on translation. Emerging data suggest that modulation of miRNA biogenesis at post-transcriptional steps by RNA-binding proteins is a key point of regulatory control over the expression of some miRNAs and the cellular processes they influence. However, the extent and conditions under which the miRNA pathway is amenable to regulation at posttranscriptional steps are poorly understood. Here we show that RBM3, a cold-inducible, developmentally regulated RNA-binding protein and putative protooncogene, is an essential regulator of miRNA biogenesis. Utilizing miRNA array, Northern blot, and PCR methods, we observed that over 60% of miRNAs detectable in a neuronal cell line were significantly downregulated by knockdown of RBM3. Conversely, for select miRNAs assayed by Northern blot, induction of RBM3 by overexpression or mild hypothermia increased their levels. Changes in miRNA expression were accompanied by changes in the levels of their ∼70 nt precursors, whereas primary transcript levels were unaffected. Mechanistic studies revealed that knockdown of RBM3 does not reduce Dicer activity or impede transport of pre-miRNAs into the cytoplasm. Rather, we find that RBM3 binds directly to ∼70 nt pre-miRNA intermediates and promotes / de-represses their ability as larger ribonucleoproteins (pre-miRNPs) to associate with active Dicer complexes. Our findings suggest that the processing of a majority of pre-miRNPs by Dicer is subject to an intrinsic inhibitory influence that is overcome by RBM3 expression. RBM3 may thus orchestrate changes in miRNA expression during hypothermia and other cellular stresses, and in the euthermic contexts of early development, differentiation, and oncogenesis where RBM3 expression is highly elevated. Additionally, our data suggest that temperature-dependent changes in miRNA expression mediated by RBM3 may contribute to the therapeutic effects of hypothermia, and are an important variable to consider in in vitro studies of translation-dependent cellular events."

Model organisms provide a platform for discovering compounds that protect against the toxic, misfolded proteins that initiate these diseases.

In yeast, TDP-43 expression is toxic, and genetic modifiers first discovered in yeast have proven to modulate TDP-43 toxicity in both neurons and humans. Here, we describe a phenotypic screen for small molecules that reverse TDP-43 toxicity in yeast. One group of hit compounds was 8-hydroxyquinolines (8-OHQ), a class of clinically relevant bioactive metal chelators related to clioquinol. Surprisingly, in otherwise wild-type yeast cells, different 8-OHQs had selectivity for rescuing the distinct toxicities caused by the expression of TDP-43, α-synuclein, or polyglutamine proteins. In fact, each 8-OHQ synergized with the other, clearly establishing that they function in different ways. Comparative growth and molecular analyses also revealed that 8-OHQs have distinct metal chelation and ionophore activities.

The mitochondrial large-conductance ""big"" K(+) channel (mBK) mediates the evolutionarily-conserved process of anesthetic preconditioning (APC), wherein exposure to volatile anesthetics initiates protection against ischemic injury. Despite the role of the mBK in cardioprotection, the molecular identity of the channel remains unknown. We investigated the attributes of the mBK using C. elegans and mouse genetic models coupled with measurements of mitochondrial K(+) transport and APC. The canonical Ca(2+)-activated BK (or ""maxi-K"") channel SLO1 was dispensable for both mitochondrial K(+) transport and APC in both organisms. Instead, we found that the related but physiologically-distinct K(+) channel SLO2 was required, and that SLO2-dependent mitochondrial K(+) transport was triggered directly by volatile anesthetics. In addition, a SLO2 channel activator mimicked the protective effects of volatile anesthetics. These findings suggest that SLO2 contributes to protection from hypoxic injury by increasing the permeability of the mitochondrial inner membrane to K(+)."
https://openalex.org/W1987985022,"Flavonoids are synthesized by phenylpropanoid pathway. They are known to participate in large number of physiological and biochemical processes in plants. Parthenocarpy and male sterility has earlier been reported by silencing chalcone synthase (CHS) encoding gene. Silencing of CHS has blocked the synthesis of most of useful flavonoids including flavan-3-ols and flavonols. Also, these studies could not identify whether parthenocarpy/male sterility were due to lack of flavan-3-ols or flavonols or both. Flavonol synthase (FLS) is an important enzyme of flavonoid pathway that catalyzes the formation of flavonols. In this article, we propose a novel strategy towards the generation of seedless or less-seeded fruits by downregulation of flavonol biosynthesis in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum cv Xanthi) through post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) of FLS encoding mRNA. The FLS silenced lines were observed for 20-80% reduction in FLS encoding gene expression and 25-93% reduction in flavonol (quercetin) content. Interestingly, these FLS silenced tobacco lines also showed reduction in their anthocyanidins content. While the content of flavan-3-ols (catechin, epi-catechin and epi-gallocatechin) was found to be increased in FLS silenced lines. The delayed flowering in FLS silenced lines could be due to decrease in level of indole acetic acid (IAA) at apical region of their shoots. Furthermore, the pollen germination was hampered and pollens were unable to produce functional pollen tube in FLS silenced tobacco lines. Pods of FLS silenced lines contained significantly less number of seeds. The in vitro and in vivo studies where 1 µM quercetin was supplied to germination media, documented the restoration of normal pollen germination and pollen tube growth. This finding identified the role of flavonols particularly quercetin in pollen germination as well as in the regulation of plant fertility. Results also suggest a novel approach towards generation of seedless/less-seeded fruits via PTGS of FLS encoding gene in plants."

Cancer cells can show perturbed mitotic spindles and an approach in cancer treatment has been to trigger cell killing by targeting microtubule dynamics or spindle assembly. To identify and characterize proteins necessary for spindle assembly, and potential antimitotic targets, we performed a proteomic and genetic analysis of 592 mitotic microtubule copurifying proteins (MMCPs). Screening for regulators that affect both mitosis and apoptosis, we report the identification and characterization of STARD9, a kinesin-3 family member, which localizes to centrosomes and stabilizes the pericentriolar material (PCM). STARD9-depleted cells have fragmented PCM, form multipolar spindles, activate the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), arrest in mitosis, and undergo apoptosis. Interestingly, STARD9-depletion synergizes with the chemotherapeutic agent taxol to increase mitotic death, demonstrating that STARD9 is a mitotic kinesin and a potential antimitotic target."
https://openalex.org/W2110067024,"Carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs) are ubiquitous components of glycoside hydrolases, which degrade polysaccharides in nature. CBMs target specific polysaccharides, and CBM binding affinity to cellulose is known to be proportional to cellulase activity, such that increasing binding affinity is an important component of performance improvement. To ascertain the impact of protein and glycan engineering on CBM binding, we use molecular simulation to quantify cellulose binding of a natively glycosylated Family 1 CBM. To validate our approach, we first examine aromatic-carbohydrate interactions on binding, and our predictions are consistent with previous experiments, showing that a tyrosine to tryptophan mutation yields a 2-fold improvement in binding affinity. We then demonstrate that enhanced binding of 3-6-fold over a nonglycosylated CBM is achieved by the addition of a single, native mannose or a mannose dimer, respectively, which has not been considered previously. Furthermore, we show that the addition of a single, artificial glycan on the anterior of the CBM, with the native, posterior glycans also present, can have a dramatic impact on binding affinity in our model, increasing it up to 140-fold relative to the nonglycosylated CBM. These results suggest new directions in protein engineering, in that modifying glycosylation patterns via heterologous expression, manipulation of culture conditions, or introduction of artificial glycosylation sites, can alter CBM binding affinity to carbohydrates and may thus be a general strategy to enhance cellulase performance. Our results also suggest that CBM binding studies should consider the effects of glycosylation on binding and function."

Unlike ubiquitin-mediated protein-protein interactions, which involve many different ubiquitin-binding motifs (15Hicke L. Schubert H.L. Hill C.P. Ubiquitin-binding domains.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 610-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar), only one type of SIM is prevalent in SUMO-mediated protein-protein interactions of all SUMO paralogues (14Song J. Durrin L.K. Wilkinson T.A. Krontiris T.G. Chen Y. Identification of a SUMO-binding motif that recognizes SUMO-modified proteins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

A reversal of the bound orientation.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 40122-40129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). All SUMO proteins form a ubiquitin-like fold, which contains an α-helix and a β-sheet. The SIM binds to a surface between the α-helix and β-sheet and extends the β-sheet as either a parallel or antiparallel β-strand (17Song J. Park J.K. Lee J.J. Choi Y.S. Ryu K.S. Kim J.H. Kim E.

The known characteristics of SIMs are that they are short (less than 10 amino acid residues) and rich in hydrophobic residues. The molecular mechanism underlining the choice of SIM bound orientation and paralogue specificity is unclear. Previous studies have shown that a segment spanning the IR1 (internal repeat 1)-M (spacer region) IR2 (internal repeat 2) domains of the nuclear pore protein RanBP2 (Ran-binding protein 2) contains two SIMs. One SIM is located in IR1, and the other is located at the junction of the M and IR2 regions. Further analysis demonstrated that the E3 ligase activity of RanBP2 is dependent on the SIMs (10Tatham M.H. Kim S. Jaffray E. Song J. Chen Y. Hay R.T.

Su Y. Song J. Chen Y. Entropy-driven mechanism of an E3 ligase.Biochemistry. 2011; 50: 5757-5766Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The IR1 domain could not pull down SUMO1 or SUMO2 or -3, but it could stimulate modifications involving both SUMO1 and SUMO2, suggesting that this SIM binds the SUMO proteins weakly and does not have paralogue specificity. In contrast, the M-IR2 domain only pulled down SUMO1, and not SUMO2 or -3, and only stimulated SUMO1 modifications (10Tatham M.H. Kim S. Jaffray E. Song J. Chen Y. Hay R.T. Unique binding interactions among Ubc9, SUMO, and RanBP2 reveal a mechanism for SUMO paralog selection.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), indicating its specificity and high affinity for SUMO1. The high affinity and specificity of the M-IR2 SIM to SUMO1 is independent of post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, as reported for the Daxx SIM (19Chang C.C. Naik M.T.

Whereas the MCAF1 SIM is specific for SUMO2/3, the IR1 and PIASX SIMs do not show preferences for a specific SUMO paralogue. The Daxx SIMs were studied by two groups that reported inconsistent findings (19Chang C.C. Naik M.T. Huang Y.S. Jeng J.C. Liao P.H. Kuo H.Y. Ho C.C. Hsieh Y.L. Lin C.H. Huang N.J. Naik N.M. Kung C.C.

Thus, structural studies of the SIMs thus far have not included a high affinity SUMO1-specific SIM, for which the affinity and specificity do not depend on post-translational modifications at a site outside of the SIM. To improve our understanding of the sequence requirements of SIMs for high affinity and high specificity interactions, we carried out NMR analysis of the structure of SUMO1 in complex with the high affinity SUMO1-specific M-IR2 SIM. We found that this SIM binds SUMO1 as an antiparallel β-strand. In addition, pull-down studies with peptide arrays were carried out for the M-IR2 SIM in order to better understand the SIM sequence requirements. Furthermore, the sequence requirements were also investigated for the parallel orientation based on the PIASX SIM, which binds SUMO1 with affinity similar to the M-IR2 SIM. Binding orientation-dependent and -independent features have been identified for high affinity interaction with SUMO1. These studies were supplemented with isothermal titration calorimetry and biochemical pull-down analyses. The molecular insights obtained here provide further understanding of the sequence requirements and mechanism underlying SUMO-SIM recognition. The 1H resonances of SUMO1-bound M-IR2 (DNEIEVIIVWEKK) SIM peptide (1:1 molar ratio) were assigned using standard homonuclear TOCSY and NOESY spectra using perdeuterated/15N-labeled SUMO1. Such a sample in 100% D2O allowed for unambiguous assignment of the 13C-1H resonances of SUMO1-complexed M-IR2 on natural abundance 13C. The 13Cα shifts were used to deduce the dihedral constraints of the bound SIM for structural calculation. The structure determination used 13C/15N/2D-enriched SUMO1 in complex with unlabeled synthetic peptide. For the SUMO1·M-IR2 complex, a full suite of sequential assignment experiments, HNCA, HNCOCA, HNCACB, HNCOCACB, and 15N-edited NOESYHSQC, was acquired to obtain the backbone resonance assignments of SUMO1 in the complex. The assigned backbone (15N, 13C, 1H) shifts allowed for calculation of the dihedral constraints of bound SUMO1 using TALOS+ (23Shen Y. Delaglio F. Cornilescu G. Bax A. TALOS+. A hybrid method for predicting protein backbone torsion angles from NMR chemical shifts.J. Biomol. NMR. 2009; 44: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (2036) Google Scholar). NOE distance constraints used in the structure calculation were obtained from the following data sets at 250 ms mixing time: three-dimensional 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC for intermolecular NOEs and two-dimensional 1H-1H NOESY acquired for complex samples in 90% H2O/10% D2O or 100% D2O for intra-M-IR2 NOEs (Table 1).TABLE 1Structural statistics of the 10 final structures (pH 6.8, 298 K)Root mean square deviation from the average structure (residues 20–97 of SUMO1 + residues 2708–2716 of RanBP2) (Å)Main chain0.84All heavy atoms1.10Total NOE distance constraints84Intra M-IR251Intermolecular33Total dihedral constraints64φ SUMO1 (M-IR2)21 (11)ψ SUMO1 (M-IR2)21 (11)Violations of structural constraintsDistance constraints >0.5 Å0Distance constraints >0.1 Å2Dihedral angle constraints > 5°0Root mean square deviation from idealized covalent geometryBonds (Å)0.0037 ± 0.00017Angles (degrees)0.65 ± 0.0083Impropers (degrees)0.47 ± 0.0096Ramachandran analysisResidues in allowed regions89%Residues in marginal regions9.8%Residues in disallowed regions1.3% Open table in a new tab The program HADDOCK (high ambiguity-driven docking) (24Dominguez C.

Soc. 2003; 125: 1731-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2217) Google Scholar) was used for docking calculations for the structure of the complex between SUMO1 and the M-IR2 SIM. No ambiguous constraints were used. For the dihedral constraints, all Φ and Ψ angles predicted by TALOS for M-IR2 (residues 2706–2716) and angles of SUMO1 residues that experienced significant amide chemical shift changes upon binding the M-IR2 SIM (regions 20–27 and 33–56) were used. Similarly, the side chains of these regions were allowed to be flexible in the docking calculation. The HADDOCK calculation started with rigid body dockings of 1000 structures, of which 200 were further refined, and the 10 with the lowest energy were chosen for analysis. Two-dimensional 15N-1H HSQC NMR spectra of SUMO1 or -2 (100–200 μm) were recorded at 298 K at each incremental titration of the SIM peptide (0.6–2 mm) until no additional chemical shift changes were observed. We extracted the binding dissociation constant (Kd) by integrating line shapes of the one-dimensional 15N slices of the two-dimensional 15N-1H HSQC spectra of SUMO at each titration point and fitted them to the Bloch-McConnell equations for two-state chemical exchange (free versus bound) using the LineShapeKin package (25Kovrigin E.L. Loria J.P. Enzyme dynamics along the reaction coordinate. Critical role of a conserved residue.Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 2636-2647Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Peptide arrays were synthesized using SPOT technology as described previously (26Li S.S. Wu C. Using peptide array to identify binding motifs and interaction networks for modular domains.Methods Mol. Biol. 2009; 570: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The peptide array membrane was blocked with 5% skim milk in TBST (0.1 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h. For the PIASX-SIM peptide array, GST-SUMO1 or GST-SUMO3 protein was added directly to the blocking buffer to a final concentration of 1 μg/ml and incubated with the membrane at room temperature for 1 h. The membrane was then washed three times for 5 min each with TBST before a rabbit anti-GST antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) was added. The membrane was allowed to incubate at room temperature for 30 min prior to three 5-min washes with TBST. A goat anti-rabbit GST-horseradish peroxidase conjugate was then added and incubated with the membrane for another 30 min. After three final 5-min washes in TBST, the peptide array membrane was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. For peptide array based on the M-IR2 SIM, competitive SUMO1 and SUMO3 binding was used as described below. Peptide arrays were first treated with blocking buffer (LI-COR) for 2 h and then incubated with SUMO1 and SUMO3 (10 μg/ml) in PBS overnight. The array was then washed three times with 500 mm NaCl in phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) to remove unbound SUMO. Subsequently, mouse anti-SUMO1 (1:1000; Abgent) and rabbit anti-SUMO2/3 (1:2000; Abcam) were incubated with the array for 2 h at room temperature. Unbound antibodies were removed by three washes in PBST. Secondary antibodies (donkey anti-mouse CW800 and donkey anti-rabbit CW680 (1:2000; LI-COR) were incubated with the array for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes with PBST, the array was imaged using the Odyssey imaging system (LI-COR). MCF-7 cells were maintained in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Irvine Scientific), 1 mm sodium pyruvate, nonessential amino acids, and 100 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Irvine Scientific) and Normocin (InvivoGen). Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (according to the manufacturer's instructions) with pcDNA-FLAG-SIM1-GFP and pcDNA-FLAG-SIM2-GFP in an 8-well chamber slide. After 48 h of transfection, cells were fixed and permeabilized. SIM1 and SIM2 fusion proteins were recognized by anti-FLAG M2 (monoclonal, 1:1000; Stratagene) and FITC-conjugated anti-mouse antibodies. Rabbit anti-SUMO1 (1:200; Boston Biochem), rabbit anti-SUMO2/3 (1:1000; Abcam), and Texas Red-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit (1:200; Jackson ImmunoResearch) antibodies were used to determine the localization of SUMO1 and SUMO2/3 in cells. Cells were imaged using the LSM510 confocal microscope. As discussed in the Introduction, the M-IR2 domain of RanBP2 harbors a high affinity SIM that is specific to SUMO1 in the absence of a post-translational modification. We conducted solution structural studies of this SIM in complex with SUMO1. The boundary of the SIM spans the segment DNEKECIIVWEKK (residues 2705–2717), identified from chemical shift perturbation analysis of 13C/15N-labeled M-IR2 domain in complex with SUMO-1 and confirmed by a synthetic peptide (supplemental Table S1). In addition, substituting Cys in this segment with a Val to avoid potential complications due to oxidation of the Cys side chain -SH group did not change the SUMO1 binding affinity and specificity (supplemental Fig. S1). We also substituted the first N-terminal Lys of this peptide to an Ile (K2708I) in order to resolve resonance overlap. Consistent with the biochemical pull-down data (supplemental Fig. S1), the K2708I peptide did not alter binding specificity to SUMO1, as indicated by the nearly identical SUMO NMR spectra between SUMO bound to K2708I and to the wild-type SIM (supplemental Figs. S2 and S3). Measurement of the binding affinity by isothermal titration calorimetry was not successful due to a small enthalpy change, suggesting an entropy-driven mechanism for the recognition. Thus, using NMR chemical shift perturbation and line shape analysis, the Kd was estimated to be ∼1.8 μm for SUMO1 and 22 μm for SUMO2, consistent with the high affinity and specificity of M-IR2 for SUMO1 (Fig. 4C and supplemental Table S1). Structure determination was carried out using the K2708I peptide (DNEIEVIIVWEKK). The bound SIM showed a well defined conformation in the middle of the peptide, with flexible termini, as shown by superimposition of the 10 best structures (Fig. 1A and Table 1). This is consistent with changes of line widths and chemical shifts of the 1Hα and 13Cα resonances between the free and bound peptide (Fig. 1B). Residues Asp-2705, Asn-2706, and Lys-2717 had sharp resonances, suggesting that they undergo fast dynamics and do not form tight interactions with SUMO1 (Fig. 1B). However, the negatively charged residues Asp-2705 to Glu-2707 at the N terminus are adjacent to a positively charged patch on the SUMO1 surface, and thus, these residues probably contribute to the electrostatic interactions. In order to identify features that contribute to the high affinity SUMO1 binding, the structure was compared with that of another high affinity SUMO1-binding SIM that bound in the opposing orientation, the SIM from PIASX, as we previously characterized (16Song J. Zhang Z. Hu W. Chen Y. Small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) recognition of a SUMO binding motif. A reversal of the bound orientation.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 40122-40129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Both the M-IR2 and PIASX SIMs have Kd values in the low micromolar range for binding SUMO1, and their affinities for SUMO1 are among the strongest of the characterized SIMs. Both SIM peptides bind between the α-helix and a β-strand of SUMO1, but they extend the β-sheet in opposing orientations (Fig. 2). The antiparallel binding M-IR2 SIM backbone displayed an extended conformation, whereas the parallel binding PIASX SIM showed a curved backbone that appeared to accommodate optimal side chain contacts. This comparison indicates that there are key differences in the binding mechanisms for these two high affinity SIMs. The 2710VIIV2713 segment of the M-IR2 SIM and 4VIDL7 segment of the PIASX SIM form interactions with the same residues on SUMO1, which include residues 35–39 on the β-strand and residues 46, 47, 50, and 54 on the α-helix (Fig. 2). The hydrophobic SUMO residues Phe-36 and Leu-47 form the bottom of the binding groove with residues Lys-37, Lys-46, and Ser-50 forming the sides. For both SIMs, three notable backbone hydrogen bonds are formed between the core residues of the SIMs and residues His-35 and Lys-37 of the SUMO1 β-strand. Ile-5 and Leu-7 of the parallel-binding SIM (PIASX SIM) form contacts with the hydrophobic groove of SUMO1 that consists of the side chains of Phe-36 and Leu-47, whereas Val-2710 and Ile-2712 of the antiparallel binding SIM (M-IR2 SIM) form equivalent contacts with SUMO1. Asp-6 of the PIASX SIM and Ile-2711 of M-IR2 point toward the surface, but Asp-6 forms a salt bridge with Lys-37, whereas the hydrophobic Ile-2711 does not. Both Val-4 (PIASX) and Val-2713 (M-IR2) interact with His-35. As shown at the top of Fig. 2, C and D, Trp-2714 (M-IR2) and Val-2 (PIASX) both interact with His-35 of SUMO1. His-35 also interacts with a hydrophobic residue in the SIM-N of Daxx (21Escobar-Cabrera E. Okon M. Lau D.K. Dart C.F. Bonvin A.M. McIntosh L.P.

The β-strand adjacent to the β-strand that forms the SIM-binding groove contributes to binding of both SIMs. Glu-2709 (M-IR2) forms a hydrogen bond with the aromatic -OH group of SUMO1 Tyr-21, but the equivalent H17 side chain of SUMO2/3, which lacks the -OH group, may not form this hydrogen bond with the Glu-2709 side chain (Fig. 2C). In the PIASX SIM, which binds all SUMO paralogues with similar affinities, the T8 methyl group forms hydrophobic interactions with the SUMO1 Tyr-21 aromatic ring (Fig. 2D) (16Song J. Zhang Z. Hu W.

Similar contacts involving Tyr-21 were not observed in the Daxx SIM-C complex with SUMO1, which is the only other SUMO1-SIM structure available to date (19Chang C.C. Naik M.T. Huang Y.S. Jeng J.C.

The interface of the parallel M-IR2 SIM in complex with SUMO1 is more flexible than that of the antiparallel PIASX SIM in complex with SUMO1. Upon forming a complex with SUMO1, a key interacting residue, Trp-2714 of the M-IR2 SIM peptide, displayed two resonances for the aromatic side chain epsilon HN, indicating that this side chain is in at least two distinct conformational states that are in exchange on a time scale slower than the NMR chemical shift (Fig. 3A). This is not due to exchange between the parallel and antiparallel orientations, as observed for the Daxx SIM (21Escobar-Cabrera E. Okon M. Lau D.K. Dart C.F. Bonvin A.M. McIntosh L.P.

https://openalex.org/W2051250848,"Leukocyte migration and activation is orchestrated by chemokines, the cleavage of which modulates their activity and glycosaminoglycan binding and thus their roles in inflammation and immunity. Early research identified proteolysis as a means of both activating or inactivating CXC chemokines and inactivating CC chemokines. Recent evidence has shown activating cleavages of the monocyte chemoattractants CCL15 and CCL23 by incubation with synovial fluid, although the responsible proteases could not be identified. Herein we show that CCL15 is processed in human synovial fluid by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and serine proteases. Furthermore, a family-wide investigation of MMP processing of all 14 monocyte-directed CC chemokines revealed that each is precisely cleaved by one or more MMPs. By MALDI-TOF-MS, 149 cleavage sites were sequenced including the first reported instance of CCL1, CCL16, and CCL17 proteolysis. Full-length CCL15-(1-92) and CCL23-(1-99) were cleaved within their unique 31 and 32-amino acid residue extended amino termini, respectively. Unlike other CCL chemokines that lose activity and become receptor antagonists upon MMP cleavage, the prominent MMP-processed products CCL15-(25-92, 28-92) and CCL23-(26-99) are stronger agonists in calcium flux and Transwell CC receptor transfectant and monocytic THP-1 migration assays. MMP processing of CCL16-(1-97) in its extended carboxyl terminus yields two products, CCL16-(8-77) and CCL16-(8-85), with both showing unexpected enhanced glycosaminoglycan binding.

Using created oyster (Crassostrea virginica) reef mesocosms, we conducted a series of laboratory experiments that created structure and manipulated complexity as well as prey density and “predator-free space” to examine the relationship between structural complexity and prey survivorship. Specifically, volume and spatial arrangement of oysters as well as prey density were manipulated, and the survivorship of prey (grass shrimp, Palaemonetes pugio) in the presence of a predator (wild red drum, Sciaenops ocellatus) was quantified. We found that the presence of structure increased prey survivorship, and that increasing complexity of this structure further increased survivorship, but only to a point. This agrees with the theory that structural complexity may influence predator-prey dynamics, but that a threshold exists with diminishing returns. These results held true even when prey density was scaled to structural complexity, or the amount of “predator-free space” was manipulated within our created reef mesocosms. The presence of structure and its complexity (oyster shell volume) were more important in facilitating prey survivorship than perceived refugia or density-dependent prey effects. A more accurate indicator of refugia might require “predator-free space” measures that also account for the available area within the structure itself (i.e., volume) and not just on the surface of a structure. Creating experiments that better mimic natural conditions and test a wider range of “predator-free space” are suggested to better understand the role of structural complexity in oyster reefs and other complex habitats."
https://openalex.org/W2084225843,"Cdc45 is an essential protein conserved in all eukaryotes and is involved both in the initiation of DNA replication and the progression of the replication fork. With GINS, Cdc45 is an essential cofactor of the Mcm2-7 replicative helicase complex. Despite its importance, no detailed information is available on either the structure or the biochemistry of the protein. Intriguingly, whereas homologues of both GINS and Mcm proteins have been described in Archaea, no counterpart for Cdc45 is known. Herein we report a bioinformatic analysis that shows a weak but significant relationship among eukaryotic Cdc45 proteins and a large family of phosphoesterases that has been described as the DHH family, including inorganic pyrophosphatases and RecJ ssDNA exonucleases. These enzymes catalyze the hydrolysis of phosphodiester bonds via a mechanism involving two Mn(2+) ions. Only a subset of the amino acids that coordinates Mn(2+) is conserved in Cdc45. We report biochemical and structural data on the recombinant human Cdc45 protein, consistent with the proposed DHH family affiliation. Like the RecJ exonucleases, the human Cdc45 protein is able to bind single-stranded, but not double-stranded DNA. Small angle x-ray scattering data are consistent with a model compatible with the crystallographic structure of the RecJ/DHH family members."
https://openalex.org/W2117046914,"Nitrosative stress is an ongoing challenge that most organisms have to contend with. When nitric oxide (NO) that may be generated either exogenously or endogenously encounters reactive oxygen species (ROS), it produces a set of toxic moieties referred to as reactive nitrogen species (RNS). As these RNS can severely damage essential biomolecules, numerous organisms have evolved elaborate detoxification strategies to nullify RNS. However, the contribution of cellular metabolism in fending off nitrosative stress is poorly understood. Using a variety of functional proteomic and metabolomic analyses, we have identified how the soil microbe Pseudomonas fluorescens reprogrammed its metabolic networks to survive in an environment enriched by sodium nitroprusside (SNP), a generator of nitrosative stress. To combat the RNS-induced ineffective aconitase (ACN) and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, the microbe invoked the participation of citrate lyase (CL), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) and pyruvate phosphate dikinase (PPDK) to convert citrate, the sole source of carbon into pyruvate and ATP. These enzymes were not evident in the control conditions. This metabolic shift was coupled to the concomitant increase in the activities of such classical RNS detoxifiers as nitrate reductase (NR), nitrite reductase (NIR) and S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR). Hence, metabolism may hold the clues to the survival of organisms subjected to nitrosative stress and may provide therapeutic cues against RNS-resistant microbes."

https://openalex.org/W1992751958,"Hendra virus is a recently emerged bat-borne zoonotic agent with high lethality in horses and humans in Australia. This is a rare disease and the determinants of bat to horse transmission, including the factors that bring these hosts together at critical times, are poorly understood. In this cross-disciplinary study climatic and vegetation primary productivity variables are compared for the dispersed and heterogenic 1994–2010 outbreak sites. The significant occurrence of spillover events within the dry season (p = 0.013, 95% CI (0.57–0.98)) suggests seasonal forcing of transmission across species, or seasonal forcing of virus excretion by the reservoir host. We explore the evidence for both. Preliminary investigations of the spatial determinants of Hendra disease locations are also presented. We find that postal areas in the Australian state of Queensland in which pteropid fruit bat (flying fox) roosts occur are approximately forty times more likely (OR = 40.5, (95% CI (5.16, 317.52)) to be the location of Hendra spillover events. This appears to be independent of density of horses at these locations. We consider issues of scale of host resource use, land use change and limitations of existing data that challenge analysis and limit further conclusive outcomes. This investigation of a broad range of potential climatic and environmental influences provides a good base for future investigations. Further understanding of cross-species Hendra virus transmission requires better understanding of flying fox resource use in the urban-rural landscape."
https://openalex.org/W2023461035,"The mammalian target of the rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, which drives cell proliferation, is frequently hyperactivated in a variety of malignancies. Therefore, the inhibition of the mTOR pathway has been considered as an appropriate approach for cancer therapy. In this study, we examined the roles of mTOR in the maintenance and differentiation of cancer stem-like cells (CSCs), the conversion of conventional cancer cells to CSCs and continuous tumor growth in vivo. In H-Ras-transformed mouse liver tumor cells, we found that pharmacological inhibition of mTOR with rapamycin greatly increased not only the CD133+ populations both in vitro and in vivo but also the expression of stem cell-like genes. Enhancing mTOR activity by over-expressing Rheb significantly decreased CD133 expression, whereas knockdown of the mTOR yielded an opposite effect. In addition, mTOR inhibition severely blocked the differentiation of CD133+ to CD133- liver tumor cells. Strikingly, single-cell culture experiments revealed that CD133- liver tumor cells were capable of converting to CD133+ cells and the inhibition of mTOR signaling substantially promoted this conversion. In serial implantation of tumor xenografts in nude BALB/c mice, the residual tumor cells that were exposed to rapamycin in vivo displayed higher CD133 expression and had increased secondary tumorigenicity compared with the control group. Moreover, rapamycin treatment also enhanced the level of stem cell-associated genes and CD133 expression in certain human liver tumor cell lines, such as Huh7, PLC/PRC/7 and Hep3B. The mTOR pathway is significantly involved in the generation and the differentiation of tumorigenic liver CSCs. These results may be valuable for the design of more rational strategies to control clinical malignant HCC using mTOR inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2108350582,"CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPβ) and C/EBPδ are known to participate in the regulation of many genes associated with inflammation. However, little is known about the activation and function of C/EBPβ and -δ in inflammatory responses elicited by Fcγ receptor (FcγR) activation. Here we show that C/EBPβ and -δ activation are induced in IgG immune complex (IC)-treated macrophages. The increased expression of C/EBPβ and -δ occurred at both mRNA and protein levels. Furthermore, induction of C/EBPβ and -δ was mediated, to a large extent, by activating FcγRs. Using siRNA-mediated knockdown as well as macrophages deficient for C/EBPβ and/or -δ, we demonstrate that C/EBPβ and -δ play a critical role in the production of TNF-α, MIP-2, and MIP-1α in IgG IC-stimulated macrophages. Moreover, both ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK are involved in C/EBP induction and TNF-α, MIP-2, and MIP-1α production induced by IgG IC. We provide the evidence that C5a regulates IgG IC-induced inflammatory responses by enhancing ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK activities as well as C/EBPβ and -δ activities. Collectively, these data suggest that C/EBPβ and -δ are key regulators for FcγR-mediated induction of cytokines and chemokines in macrophages. Furthermore, C/EBPs may play an important regulatory role in IC-associated inflammatory responses."

Because many studies of band 3 diffusion also distinguish three populations of the polypeptide, it has been speculated that the three populations envisioned in membrane models correspond to the three fractions observed in diffusion analyses. To test this hypothesis, we characterized band 3 diffusion by single-particle tracking in wild-type and ankyrin- and adducin-deficient erythrocytes. We report that ∼40% of total band 3 in wild-type murine erythrocytes is attached to ankyrin, whereas ∼33% is immobilized by adducin, and ∼27% is not attached to any cytoskeletal anchor.

Labeling of approximately one band 3 molecule/erythrocyte with a quantum dot using a DIDS-biotin conjugate was performed as described previously (35Kodippili G.C. Spector J. Sullivan C. Kuypers F.A. Labotka R. Gallagher P.G. Ritchie K. Low P.S. Imaging of the diffusion of single band 3 molecules on normal and mutant erythrocytes.Blood. 2009; 113: 6237-6245Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and as outlined in greater detail in the supplemental text. However, because band 3 diffuses differently in erythroblasts and reticulocytes than it does in mature red cells (44Kodippili G.C. Spector J. Kang G.E. Liu H. Wickrema A. Ritchie K. Low P.S. Analysis of the kinetics of band 3 diffusion in human erythroblasts during assembly of the erythrocyte membrane skeleton.Br. J. Haematol. 2010; 150: 592-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), it was important to exclude any cells containing RNA from our measurements of band 3 diffusion, especially in blood samples from ankyrin- or adducin-deficient erythrocytes where reticulocyte counts are high. For this purpose, analysis of band 3 diffusion in mutant erythrocytes (supplemental Fig. 1) was only performed on cells that were labeled with a quantum dot but not with SYTO RNASelect. The 488-nm emission line of an argon ion laser (Newport) was used to excite the SYTO RNASelect stain, whereas the 543 nm emission line of a helium-neon laser (Newport) was used to excite the quantum dots. Both excitation lines were expanded, filtered (488/10-nm and 543/10-nm line width bandpass filters, respectively; Chroma) and directed toward the microscope objective (100× PlanApo, NA 1.45 TIRFM oil immersion; Olympus) parallel, but off the optical axis through a dual dichroic mirror (double notch filter centered at the excitation lines, z488/543rpc; Chroma). Oblique angle illumination was obtained by slightly relaxing the condition of total internal reflection such that only a part of the sample chamber was illuminated while still minimizing the background. After passing through the dual dichroic mirror, the two-color fluorescent image was split by wavelength using a high pass cutoff filter (545 nm; Chroma). The separated emission lines were filtered by broad band transmission filters (515/30 nm, Chroma; and 630/69 nm, Semrock) before being collected by two dual MCP-intensified, cooled CCD cameras (XR/Turbo-120z, Stanford Photonics). A sample of 20-nm fluorescent polystyrene beads fixed to a coverslip was used to align the two camera images. Micrometer screws along five axes (x, y, z, tilt and twist) on one camera were used to match its field of view with that of the other camera. The entire microscope was maintained at 37 °C by enclosure in a temperature-controlled environment. The apparent position of the quantum dot in the video image was determined as described by Gelles et al. (45Gelles J. Schnapp B.J. Sheetz M.P. Tracking kinesin-driven movements with nanometer-scale precision.Nature. 1988; 331: 450-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). Briefly, a two-dimensional kernel was developed from a Gaussian distribution which was then cross-correlated with each video frame in the neighborhood of the label of interest. Details of analyses have been explained previously (35Kodippili G.C. Spector J. Sullivan C. Kuypers F.A. Labotka R. Gallagher P.G. Ritchie K. Low P.S. Imaging of the diffusion of single band 3 molecules on normal and mutant erythrocytes.Blood. 2009; 113: 6237-6245Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). A plug-in was written for the freely available ImageJ software which allowed analysis of the single-particle diffusion trajectories. Data obtained at 120 frames per second (fps) were processed to yield 30 fps data (by averaging the raw 120 fps data every 4 frames) and found to yield diffusion parameters identical to data collected directly at 30 fps. Statistical analyses are described in supplemental text. Characterization of the movement of single band 3 molecules in whole erythrocytes required the ability to specifically label band 3, the erythrocyte anion transporter (AE1), in intact cells in a nonperturbing manner. For this purpose, DIDS, a selective inhibitor of anion transport that reacts covalently with Lys539 of band 3 (46Salhany J.M. Mechanistic basis for site-site interactions in inhibitor and substrate binding to band 3 (AE1): evidence distinguishing allosteric from electrostatic effects.Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 2001; 27: 901-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), was conjugated to biotin and employed to label a single band 3 molecule in intact cells. The specificity of the DIDS-biotin conjugate for mouse band 3 was established by reacting the conjugate with intact mouse erythrocytes, separating the component proteins by SDS-PAGE, blotting the proteins onto nitrocellulose paper, and visualizing the location of biotinylated polypeptides by staining with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase. As seen in supplemental Fig. 2, only one polypeptide with apparent molecular mass of ∼100 kDa was labeled. Because band 3 is the only known erythrocyte receptor for DIDS and because band 3 has the molecular mass of the protein stained in supplemental Fig. 2 (i.e. ∼100 kDa), we conclude that band 3 is selectively labeled by the DIDS-biotin conjugate in intact murine erythrocytes. The fact that streptavidin-linked quantum dots do not bind erythrocytes that have not been reacted with DIDS-biotin (35Kodippili G.C. Spector J. Sullivan C. Kuypers F.A. Labotka R. Gallagher P.G. Ritchie K. Low P.S. Imaging of the diffusion of single band 3 molecules on normal and mutant erythrocytes.Blood. 2009; 113: 6237-6245Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) demonstrates that DIDS-biotin labeling enables selective imaging of band 3 diffusion in intact murine erythrocytes. Because only enough DIDS-biotin is added to label one band 3 molecule per erythrocyte and because diffusion measurements are obtained <1 h after labeling, we do not believe that the labeling reaction measurably affects erythrocyte properties. Before describing the rates of band 3 diffusion in healthy murine erythrocytes, a brief explanation of the effect of videomicroscopy frame rate on the calculation of band 3 diffusion coefficients might be helpful. Imagine three populations of band 3: one oscillating in a confined area at high frequency; a second oscillating in a slightly larger area at somewhat slower frequency; and a third diffusing in an unconstrained and random manner across large regions of the membrane. A few photographs of the position of band 3 at long time intervals would likely reveal that the first two populations were confined to a limited area, whereas the third diffused randomly across the cell. In contrast, the same number of photographs taken at extremely short time intervals would reveal that the first two populations were moving rapidly, perhaps even at sufficiently different rates to distinguish them from each other, with the third population, although highly mobile, moving only a short distance. Thus, to obtain a complete understanding of the different motile populations of band 3, data must be analyzed at different frame rates for different durations, and their different areas of confined diffusion must be considered. We have used this more detailed multiframe rate approach to study band 3 diffusion in wild-type and mutant mouse erythrocytes. The microscopic diffusion coefficient (Dμ) reports on particle diffusion over short time periods and thereby emphasizes its instantaneous motility rather than sustained motility. A typical distribution of Dμ values of band 3 in normal murine RBCs collected at 120 fps is shown in Fig. 2, row A, column 1 (see Table 1). With the aid of computer analysis (see “Experimental Procedures”), three populations of band 3 can be identified and fit to Gaussian distributions, one diffusing at 6.3 × 10−12 cm2/s (∼22% of total), a second diffusing at 6.3 × 10−11 cm2/s (∼66% of total), and a third population diffusing at 8.3 × 10−10 cm2/s (∼12% of total). Although it was tempting to assume that the three different populations correspond to adducin-linked band 3 at the junctional complex, ankyrin-attached band 3 midway along the spectrin tetramer, and free band 3 not attached to the spectrin cytoskeleton, respectively, we sought to test these assumptions by analyzing band 3 diffusion in erythrocytes from mice with deficiencies in adducin and ankyrin. As seen in Fig. 2, row B, column 1, E924X mice that are nearly completely deficient in ankyrin display two broad (probably heterogeneous) distributions of band 3 species, one with microscopic diffusion coefficients (Dμ) centered at 1.1 × 10−10 cm2/s (∼60% of total) and the second with Dμ centered at 2.1 × 10−9 cm2/s (∼40% of total). Although it was not possible to establish which"

The yeast H3K4 methyltransferase complex, Set1 complex or complex of proteins associated with Set1 (COMPASS), consists of Set1 and conserved Set1-associated proteins: Swd1, Swd2, Swd3, Spp1, Bre2, Sdc1, and Shg1. The removal of the WD40 domain-containing subunits Swd1 and Swd3 leads to a loss of Set1 protein and consequently a complete loss of H3K4 methylation. However, until now, how these WD40 domain-containing proteins interact with Set1 and contribute to the stability of Set1 and H3K4 methylation has not been determined. In this study, we identified small basic and acidic patches that mediate protein interactions between the C terminus of Swd1 and the nSET domain of Set1. Absence of either the basic or acidic patches of Set1 and Swd1, respectively, disrupts the interaction between Set1 and Swd1, diminishes Set1 protein levels, and abolishes H3K4 methylation. Moreover, these basic and acidic patches are also important for cell growth, telomere silencing, and gene expression. We also show that the basic and acidic patches of Set1 and Swd1 are conserved in their human counterparts SET1A/B and RBBP5, respectively, and are needed for the protein interaction between SET1A and RBBP5. Therefore, this charge-based interaction is likely important for maintaining the protein stability of the human SET1A/B methyltransferase complexes so that proper H3K4 methylation, cell growth, and gene expression can also occur in mammals."
https://openalex.org/W2135593606,"The bioenergetic status of cells is tightly regulated by the activity of cytosolic enzymes and mitochondrial ATP production. To adapt their metabolism to cellular energy needs, mitochondria have been shown to exhibit changes in their ionic composition as the result of changes in cytosolic ion concentrations. Individual mitochondria also exhibit spontaneous changes in their electrical potential without altering those of neighboring mitochondria. We recently reported that individual mitochondria of intact astrocytes exhibit spontaneous transient increases in their Na+ concentration. Here, we investigated whether the concentration of other ionic species were involved during mitochondrial transients. By combining fluorescence imaging methods, we performed a multiparameter study of spontaneous mitochondrial transients in intact resting astrocytes. We show that mitochondria exhibit coincident changes in their Na+ concentration, electrical potential, matrix pH and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production during a mitochondrial transient without involving detectable changes in their Ca2+ concentration. Using widefield and total internal reflection fluorescence imaging, we found evidence for localized transient decreases in the free Mg2+ concentration accompanying mitochondrial Na+ spikes that could indicate an associated local and transient enrichment in the ATP concentration. Therefore, we propose a sequential model for mitochondrial transients involving a localized ATP microdomain that triggers a Na+-mediated mitochondrial depolarization, transiently enhancing the activity of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Our work provides a model describing ionic changes that could support a bidirectional cytosol-to-mitochondria ionic communication."

A total of 18 chromophores are noncovalently bound to the apoprotein and warrant absorption of solar radiation over much of the visible spectrum. These chromophores are eight chlorophyll (Chl) a, six Chl b, and four carotenoid molecules. The crystal structure of the functional, trimeric form of LHCII is known in atomic detail (2Liu Z. Yan H.

Each monomer possesses three transmembrane helices H1, H3, and H4 spanning the thylakoid membrane and creating a central scaffold where the chromophores are bound in their specific positions at a high density (Fig. 1A).

Besides its main light-harvesting function, LHCII is involved in several regulatory processes to optimize photosynthesis and to prevent photo-damage of the photosystems (PS) in changing light conditions. It is assumed by some but not by others that the switch from one functional state to another may require a conformational change of some domains of the apoprotein. Under high light conditions, LHCII is involved in the short term protection of the photosynthetic system, which is referred to as the energy-dependent component (qE) of nonphotochemical quenching or feedback de-excitation (4Andersson J. Wentworth M. Walters R.G. Howard C.A. Ruban A.V. Horton P. Jansson S. Absence of the Lhcb1 and Lhcb2 proteins of the light-harvesting complex of photosystem II. Effects on photosynthesis, grana stacking, and fitness.Plant J. 2003; 35: 350-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Triggered by the acidification of the thylakoid lumen, the carotenoid violaxanthin is converted to zeaxanthin by a lumenal de-epoxidase, and the excess energy is dissipated as heat. The protonation of lumen-exposed acidic residues under low pH conditions has been suggested to trigger a conformational change of helix H3 and the lumenal loop domain, resulting in an active energy-trapping site composed of xanthophyll cycle carotenoids and a Chl a dimer (2Liu Z. Yan H. Wang K. Kuang T. Zhang J. Gui L. An X. Chang W. Crystal structure of spinach major light-harvesting complex at 2.72 Å resolution.Nature. 2004; 428: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1391) Google Scholar). According to another model of nonphotochemical quenching, LHCII interacts with the protein PsbS in the photosynthetic membrane at low lumen pH, which results in a conformational change of LHCII, an altered configuration of its pigments, and consequently, a switch to the dissipative state (5Pascal A.A. Liu Z. Broess K. van Oort B. van Amerongen H. Wang C. Horton P. Robert B. Chang W. Ruban A. Molecular basis of photoprotection and control of photosynthetic light harvesting.Nature. 2005; 436: 134-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Ruban et al. (6Ruban A.V. Berera R. Ilioaia C. van Stokkum I.H. Kennis J.T. Pascal A.A. van Amerongen H. Robert B. Horton P. van Grondelle R. Identification of a mechanism of photoprotective energy dissipation in higher plants.Nature. 2007; 450: 575-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar) postulated an alternative model for energy dissipation in LHCII. Based on the twist in the configuration of the LHCII-bound carotenoid neoxanthin, the structure of LHCII is changed into the dissipative state, and excess energy is transferred from Chl a to a lower energy carotenoid lutein. To date, the structural basis of nonphotochemical quenching in LHCII is unclear and controversially discussed. Kühlbrandt and co-workers (3Standfuss J. Terwisscha van Scheltinga A.C. Lamborghini M. Kühlbrandt W. Mechanisms of photoprotection and nonphotochemical quenching in pea light-harvesting complex at 2.5 Å resolution.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 919-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar) proposed alternative models for quenching mechanisms without conformational changes of LHCII. First, the simple replacement of violaxanthin by zeaxanthin in the binding pocket of LHCII itself can cause an effective quenching of excess energy without any structural changes. Second, the interaction between LHCII and PsbS monomers creates a quenching unit of transiently bound pigments that then function as a channel for the safe dissipation of energy (7Barros T. Kühlbrandt W. Crystallization, structure, and function of plant light-harvesting Complex II.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1787: 753-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Miloslavina et al. (8Miloslavina Y. Wehner A. Lambrev P.H. Wientjes E. Reus M. Garab G. Croce R. Holzwarth A.R. Far-red fluorescence. A direct spectroscopic marker for LHCII oligomer formation in nonphotochemical quenching.FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 3625-3631Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) proposed another model involving a Chl-Chl charge transfer state as a quenching unit. The prerequisite for their model is the formation of inter-trimer Chl-Chl pairs at the interface of LHCII oligomers. Recently, Avenson et al. (9Avenson T.J. Ahn T.K. Zigmantas D. Niyogi K.K. Li Z. Ballottari M. Bassi R. Fleming G.R. Zeaxanthin radical cation formation in minor light-harvesting complexes of higher plant antenna.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 3550-3558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) suggested a carotenoid radical cation model for energy dissipation. Minor LHCs, positioned between LHCII and PSII, provide the quenching sites by binding zeaxanthin. Electrons can be transferred from Chl to zeaxanthin, which then undergoes charge separation. Besides this energy-dissipating function, LHCII is involved in the balanced distribution of excitation energy between the photosystems by dissociating from PSII and binding to PSI in high light conditions. This short term process is referred to as state transition and is regulated by phosphorylation of the N-terminal protein domain in LHCII by the thylakoid kinase STN7 (10Lemeille S. Rochaix J.D.

Novel insights into plant light-harvesting complex II phosphorylation and “state transitions.”.Trends Plant Sci. 2011; 16: 126-131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Different binding specificities of phosphorylated LHCII for both photosystems have been proposed, but the molecular basis of the redistribution of LHCII complexes between PSII and PSI remains unknown as yet (13Kargul J. Barber J. Photosynthetic acclimation. Structural reorganization of light harvesting antenna. Role of redox-dependent phosphorylation of major and minor chlorophyll a/b-binding proteins.FEBS J. 2008; 275: 1056-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Among several hypotheses that have been put forward, a conformational switch of the N-terminal conformation has been discussed (14Nilsson A. Stys D. Drakenberg T. Spangfort M.D. Forsén S. Allen J.F. Phosphorylation controls the three-dimensional structure of plant light harvesting complex II.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18350-18357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). A light-induced conformational change of the N-terminal region was shown by an increase of its accessibility to tryptic cleavage and was also suggested in connection with the phosphorylation process (15Zer H. Vink M. Keren N. Dilly-Hartwig H.G. Paulsen H. Herrmann R.G. Andersson B. Ohad I. Regulation of thylakoid protein phosphorylation at the substrate level.

U.S.A. 1999; 96: 8277-8282Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Yet another function of LHCII is the organization of chloroplast membranes in chloroplast grana stacks, which is thought to be mediated by interactions between N-terminal LHCII domains. The recently published cryoelectron tomography of thylakoid membranes supports a Velcro-like interaction of LHCII trimers in grana thylakoids (16Daum B. Nicastro D. Austin 2nd, J. McIntosh J.R. Kühlbrandt W. Arrangement of photosystem II and ATP synthase in chloroplast membranes of spinach and pea.Plant Cell. 2010; 22: 1299-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) as it was suggested earlier (3Standfuss J. Terwisscha van Scheltinga A.C. Lamborghini M. Kühlbrandt W. Mechanisms of photoprotection and nonphotochemical quenching in pea light-harvesting complex at 2.5 Å resolution.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 919-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). According to the model, grana stacks are held together by the electrostatic interaction between the positively charged N-terminal domains of one trimer with the negatively charged stromal surface of the opposite trimer. For such an interaction, some flexibility in the N-terminal domain, including the positive charge cluster, would be advantageous but was never confirmed experimentally. A flexible N terminus in LHCII has also been proposed to explain the low resolution in this segment of the LHCII crystal structure (16Daum B. Nicastro D. Austin 2nd, J. McIntosh J.R. Kühlbrandt W. Arrangement of photosystem II and ATP synthase in chloroplast membranes of spinach and pea.Plant Cell. 2010; 22: 1299-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Structural information on proteins in solution, their flexibility, and their conformational changes can be gathered by various techniques of EPR in combination with site-directed spin labeling. The apoprotein of LHCII is recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli (17Paulsen H. Rümler U. Rüdiger W. Reconstitution of pigment-containing complexes from light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b-binding protein overexpressed in E. coli.Planta. 1990; 181: 204-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) and therefore can easily be spin-labeled in specific positions (18Volkov A.

https://openalex.org/W2086702072,"Mutant (Mt) p53 abrogates tumor suppression functions of wild-type (WT) p53 through mutant-specific, gain-of-function effects, and patients bearing Mt p53 are chemoresistant. The dominant negative effect of p53 mutants results from their aggregation propensity which causes co-aggregation of WT p53. We explored the mechanism of p53 inactivation in hypoxia and hypothesized whether WT p53 could rescue Mt p53 in hypoxic tumors. WT p53 exists in mutant conformation in hypoxic core of MCF-7 solid tumors, and its conformation is oxygen-dependent. Under simulated hypoxia in cells, WT p53 undergoes conformational change in acquiring mutant conformation. An in vivo chaperone assay shows that WT p53 functions as a molecular chaperone in rescuing conformational and structural p53 mutants in cancer cells both at the transcription and proteome levels. WT p53 chaperone therapy is further shown to cause significant regression of tumor xenografts through reconversion of the mutant phenotype to wild-type p53. The chaperone function of WT p53 is directly linked to the induction of apoptosis in both cancer cells and tumor xenografts. As oncogenic p53 mutants are linked to chemoresistance in hypoxic tumors, p53 chaperone therapy will introduce new dimensions to existing cancer therapeutics. We propose that in cancer cells, WT p53 chaperoning may either exist as a cellular event to potentially reverse the dominant negative effect of its oncogenic mutants or to stabilize yet unidentified factors."

Using solid-state NMR correlation spectroscopy we find detailed evidence for an extended cross-β structure. This amyloid assembly helps to account for the strength and amphiphilic properties of the vesicle wall. Buoyancy organelles thus dramatically extend the scope of known functional amyloids."
https://openalex.org/W1978112502,"Background ADPH oxidase-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) play important roles in redox homeostasis and signal transduction in endothelial cells (ECs). We previously demonstrated that c-Src plays a key role in VEGF-induced, ROS-dependent selective activation of PI3K-Akt but not PLCγ-1-ERK1/2 signaling pathways. The aim of the present study was to understand how VEGFR-2-c-Src signaling axis ‘senses’ NADPH oxidase-derived ROS levels and couples VEGF activation of c-Src to the redox state of ECs. Methodology/Principal Findings Using biotinylated probe that detects oxidation of cysteine thiol (cys-OH) in intracellular proteins, we demonstrate that VEGF induced oxidative modification in c-Src and VEGFR-2, and that reduction in ROS levels using siRNA against p47phox subunit of Rac1-dependent NADPH oxidase inhibited this phenomenon. Co-immunoprecipitation studies using human coronary artery ECs (HCAEC) showed that VEGF-induced ROS-dependent interaction between VEGFR-2 and c-Src correlated with their thiol oxidation status. Immunofluorescence studies using antibodies against internalized VEGFR-2 and c-Src demonstrated that VEGF-induced subcellular co-localization of these tyrosine kinases were also dependent on NADPH oxidsase-derived ROS. Conclusion/Significance These results demonstrate that VEGF induces cysteine oxidation in VEGFR-2 and c-Src in an NADPH oxidase-derived ROS-dependent manner, suggesting that VEGFR-2 and c-Src can ‘sense’ redox levels in ECs. The data also suggest that thiol oxidation status of VEGFR-2 and c-Src correlates with their ability to physically interact with each other and c-Src activation. Taken together, these findings suggest that prior to activating downstream c-Src-PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, VEGFR-2-c-Src axis requires an NADPH oxidase-derived ROS threshold in ECs."
https://openalex.org/W2119131032,"LKB1 acts as a master upstream protein kinase regulating a number of kinases involved in diverse cellular functions. Recent studies have suggested a role for LKB1 in male fertility. Male mice with reduced total LKB1 expression, including the complete absence of the major splice variant in testis (LKB1(S)), are completely infertile. We sought to further characterise these mice and determine the mechanism underlying this infertility. This involved expression studies of LKB1 in developing germ cells, morphological analysis of mature spermatozoa and histological studies of both the testis and epididymis using light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. We conclude that a defect in the release of mature spermatids from the seminiferous epithelium (spermiation) during spermatozoan development is a major cause of the infertility phenotype. We also present evidence that this is due, at least in part, to defects in the breakdown of the junctions, known as ectoplasmic specialisations, between the sertoli cells of the testis epithelium and the heads of the maturing spermatids. Overall this study uncovers a critical role for LKB1 in spermiation, a highly regulated, but poorly understood process vital for male fertility."

Met-303 was more important for exendin-4 and oxyntomodulin action than those of GLP-1 peptides. Globally, ECL2 mutation was more detrimental to exendin-4-mediated Ca2+i release than GLP-1(7–36)-NH2, providing additional evidence for subtle differences in receptor activation by these two peptides. Unlike peptide activation of the GLP-1R, ECL2 mutations had only limited impact on compound 2 mediated cAMP and pERK responses, consistent with this ligand having a distinct mechanism for receptor activation.

https://openalex.org/W2066702890,"RNA interference is an efficient method to silence gene and protein expressions. Here, the class B scavenger receptor CD36 (SRB) mediated the uptake of exogenous dsRNAs in the induction of the RNAi responses in ticks. Unfed female Haemaphysalis longicornis ticks were injected with a single or a combination of H. longicornis SRB (HlSRB) dsRNA, vitellogenin-1 (HlVg-1) dsRNA, and vitellogenin receptor (HlVgR) dsRNA. We found that specific and systemic silencing of the HlSRB, HlVg-1, and HlVgR genes was achieved in ticks injected with a single dsRNA of HlSRB, HlVg-1, and HlVgR. In ticks injected first with HlVg-1 or HlVgR dsRNA followed 96 hours later with HlSRB dsRNA (HlVg-1/HlSRB or HlVgR/HlSRB), gene silencing of HlSRB was achieved in addition to first knockdown in HlVg-1 or HlVgR, and prominent phenotypic changes were observed in engorgement, mortality, and hatchability, indicating that a systemic and specific double knockdown of target genes had been simultaneously attained in these ticks. However, in ticks injected with HlSRB dsRNA followed 96 hours later with HlVg-1 or HlVgR dsRNAs, silencing of HlSRB was achieved, but no subsequent knockdown in HlVgR or HlVg-1 was observed. The Westernblot and immunohistochemical examinations revealed that the endogenous HlSRB protein was fully abolished in midguts of ticks injected with HlSRB/HlVg-1 dsRNAs but HlVg-1 was normally expressed in midguts, suggesting that HlVg-1 dsRNA-mediated RNAi was fully inhibited by the first knockdown of HlSRB. Similarly, the abolished localization of HlSRB protein was recognized in ovaries of ticks injected with HlSRB/HlVgR, while normal localization of HlVgR was observed in ovaries, suggesting that the failure to knock-down HlVgR could be attributed to the first knockdown of HlSRB. In summary, we demonstrated for the first time that SRB may not only mediate the effective knock-down of gene expression by RNAi but also play essential roles for systemic RNAi of ticks."

Protection lasts at least 40 weeks and correlates with increased survival and reduced colonization. Protection extends into drug-resistant (MRSA or VISA) and genetically diverse clinical strains. The vaccine is effective when administered - in a single dose and without adjuvant - by the intramuscular, intravenous or the aerosol routes and induces active as well as passive immunization.

Sustained antibacterial activity and induction of a strong and rapid anti-inflammatory response are the mechanisms conferring therapeutic efficacy to A170PG."
https://openalex.org/W1971789109,"When stimulus intensity in simple reaction-time tasks randomly varies across trials, detection speed usually improves after a low-intensity trial. With auditory stimuli, this improvement was often found to be asymmetric, being greater on current low-intensity trials. Our study investigated (1) whether asymmetric sequential intensity adaptation also occurs with visual stimuli; (2) whether these adjustments reflect decision-criterion shifts or, rather, a modulation of perceptual sensitivity; and (3) how sequential intensity adaptation and its underlying mechanisms are affected by mental fatigue induced through prolonged performance. In a continuous speeded detection task with randomly alternating high- and low-intensity visual stimuli, the reaction-time benefit after low-intensity trials was greater on subsequent low- than high-intensity trials. This asymmetry, however, only developed with time on task (TOT). Signal-detection analyses showed that the decision criterion transiently became more liberal after a low-intensity trial, whereas observer sensitivity increased when the preceding and current stimulus were of equal intensity. TOT-induced mental fatigue only affected sensitivity, which dropped more on low- than on high-intensity trials. This differential fatigue-related sensitivity decrease selectively enhanced the impact of criterion down-shifts on low-intensity trials, revealing how the interplay of two perceptual mechanisms and their modulation by fatigue combine to produce the observed overall pattern of asymmetric performance adjustments to varying visual intensity in continuous speeded detection. Our results have implications for similar patterns of sequential demand adaptation in other cognitive domains as well as for real-world prolonged detection performance."

https://openalex.org/W2036665411,"Chloroquine (CQ) is a widely prescribed anti-malarial agent and is also prescribed to treat autoimmune diseases. Clinical treatment with CQ is often accompanied by serious side effects such as hepatitis and retinopathy. As a weak base, CQ accumulates in intracellular acidic organelles, raises the pH, and induces osmotic swelling and permeabilization of acidic organelles, which account for CQ-induced cytotoxicity. We reported previously that CQ treatment caused α-tocopherol transfer protein (α-TTP), a gene product of familial vitamin E deficiency, to change its location from the cytosol to the surface of acidic organelles. Here we show that α-TTP plays a novel role in protecting against CQ toxicity both in vitro and in vivo. In the presence of CQ, rat hepatoma McARH7777 cells, which do not express α-TTP endogenously, showed more severe cytotoxicity, such as larger vacuolation of acidic organelles and caspase activation, than α-TTP transfectant cells. Similarly, α-TTP knockout mice showed more severe CQ toxicity, such as hepatotoxicity and retinopathy, than wild-type mice. These effects were not ameliorated by vitamin E supplementation. In contrast to bafilomycin A1 treatment, which prevents CQ accumulation in cells by raising the pH of acidic organelles, α-TTP expression prevented CQ accumulation without affecting the pH of acidic organelles. Taken together, our data suggest that α-TTP protects against CQ toxicity by preventing CQ accumulation in acidic organelles through a mechanism distinct from vitamin E transport."
https://openalex.org/W2156863092,"LipL32 is the most abundant outer membrane protein from pathogenic Leptospira and has been shown to bind extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins as well as Ca(2+). Recent crystal structures have been obtained for the protein in the apo- and Ca(2+)-bound forms. In this work, we produced three LipL32 mutants (D163-168A, Q67A, and S247A) and evaluated their ability to interact with Ca(2+) and with ECM glycoproteins and human plasminogen. The D163-168A mutant modifies aspartate residues involved in Ca(2+) binding, whereas the other two modify residues in a cavity on the other side of the protein structure. Loss of calcium binding in the D163-D168A mutant was confirmed using intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence, circular dichroism, and thermal denaturation whereas the Q67A and S247A mutants presented the same Ca(2+) affinity as the wild-type protein. We then evaluated if Ca(2+) binding to LipL32 would be crucial for its interaction with collagen type IV and plasma proteins fibronectin and plasminogen. Surprisingly, the wild-type protein and all three mutants, including the D163-168A variant, bound to these ECM proteins with very similar affinities, both in the presence and absence of Ca(2+) ions. In conclusion, calcium binding to LipL32 may be important to stabilize the protein, but is not necessary to mediate interaction with host extracellular matrix proteins."

Here we report that the C57BL6 background sensitizes mutants to a wasting phenotype that causes approximately one third to die precipitously between weaning and adulthood, while remaining homozygotes live with no signs of illness. The wasting phenotype is associated with severe hypoglycemia. Circulating ACTH and corticosterone levels are elevated in juvenile and aged Prop1 mutants, indicating activation of the pituitary-adrenal axis. Despite this, young adult Prop1 deficient mice are capable of responding to restraint stress with further elevation of ACTH and corticosterone. Low blood glucose, an expected side effect of GH deficiency, is likely responsible for the elevated corticosterone level. These studies suggest that the mouse model differs from the human patients who display progressive hormone loss and hypocortisolism."
https://openalex.org/W2075990735,"Fungal peritonitis is a serious complication of peritoneal dialysis (PD) therapy with the majority of patients ceasing PD permanently. The aims of this study were to identify risk factors and clinical associations that may discriminate between fungal from bacterial peritonitis.We retrospectively identified episodes of fungal peritonitis from 2001-2010 in PD patients at Liverpool and Westmead Hospitals (Australia). Fungal peritonitis cases were matched in a 1:2 ratio with patients with bacterial peritonitis from each institution's dialysis registry, occurring closest in time to the fungal episode. Patient demographic, clinical and outcome data were obtained from the medical records.Thirty-nine episodes of fungal peritonitis (rate of 0.02 episodes per patient-year of dialysis) were matched with 78 episodes of bacterial peritonitis. Candida species were the commonest pathogens (35/39; 90% episodes) with Candida albicans (37%), Candida parapsilosis (32%) and Candida glabrata (13%) the most frequently isolated species. Compared to bacterial peritonitis, fungal peritonitis patients had received PD for significantly longer (1133 vs. 775 catheter-days; p = 0.016), were more likely to have had previous episodes of bacterial peritonitis (51% vs. 10%; p = 0.01), and to have received prior antibacterial therapy (51% vs. 10%; p = 0.01). Patients with fungal peritonitis were less likely to have fever and abdominal pain on presentation, but had higher rates of PD catheter removal (79% vs. 22%; p<0.005), and permanent transfer to haemodialysis (87% vs. 24%; p<0.005). Hospital length of stay was significantly longer in patients with fungal peritonitis (26.1 days vs. 12.6 days; p = 0.017), but the all-cause 30-day mortality rate was similar in both groups. Fluconazole was a suitable empiric antifungal agent; with no Candida resistance detected.Prompt recognition of clinical risk factors, initiation of antifungal therapy and removal of PD catheters are key considerations in optimising outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W1974214659,"Here we present a systematic analysis of accessible surface areas and hydrogen bonds of 2554 globular proteins from four structural classes (all-α, all-β, α/β and α+β proteins) that is aimed to learn in which structural class the accessible surface area increases with increasing protein molecular mass more rapidly than in other classes, and what structural peculiarities are responsible for this effect. The beta structural class of proteins was found to be the leader, with the following possible explanations of this fact. First, in beta structural proteins, the fraction of residues not included in the regular secondary structure is the largest, and second, the accessible surface area of packaged elements of the beta-structure increases more rapidly with increasing molecular mass in comparison with the alpha-structure. Moreover, in the beta structure, the probability of formation of backbone hydrogen bonds is higher than that in the alpha helix for all residues of α+β proteins (the average probability is 0.73±0.01 for the beta-structure and 0.60±0.01 for the alpha-structure without proline) and α/β proteins, except for asparagine, aspartic acid, glycine, threonine, and serine (0.70±0.01 for the beta-structure and 0.60±0.01 for the alpha-structure without the proline residue). There is a linear relationship between the number of hydrogen bonds and the number of amino acid residues in the protein ()."
