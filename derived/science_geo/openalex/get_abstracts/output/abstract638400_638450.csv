https://openalex.org/W2969246650,"Artificial intelligence and other data-intensive applications have escalated the demand for data storage and processing. New computing devices, such as phase-change random access memory (PCRAM)-based neuro-inspired devices, are promising options for breaking the von Neumann barrier by unifying storage with computing in memory cells. However, current PCRAM devices have considerable noise and drift in electrical resistance that erodes the precision and consistency of these devices. We designed a phase-change heterostructure (PCH) that consists of alternately stacked phase-change and confinement nanolayers to suppress the noise and drift, allowing reliable iterative RESET and cumulative SET operations for high-performance neuro-inspired computing. Our PCH architecture is amenable to industrial production as an intrinsic materials solution, without complex manufacturing procedure or much increased fabrication cost."

Liu et al. found that host cells impair RNA m 6 A demethylase activity after viral infection, leading to increased m 6 A and reduced stability of α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (OGDH) mRNA. As a result, reduced OGDH decreases the generation of itaconate, thereby inhibiting viral replication. The authors explore the function of OGDH and itaconate in viral infection, provide insights into m 6 A RNA modification and metabolic reprogramming in modulating virus-host interaction, and suggest potential therapeutic targets for the control of viral infection.

Like their F-type cousins in mitochondria, chloroplasts, and most bacteria, vacuolar/archaeal (V/A-type) ATPases couple synthesis or hydrolysis of ATP to movement of protons across the membrane. To uncover mechanistic differences in energy coupling between F- and V/A-type enzymes, Zhou and Sazanov determined structures of a V/A-type ATP synthase from the bacterium Thermus thermophilus. With structures of multiple substates visible, the domain interfaces are made clear and a role for the elastic peripheral stalks is apparent in coupling rotational energy from V o into the ATP-synthesizing V 1 domain.

https://openalex.org/W2969380363,"The aggregation of the tau protein into neurofibrillary tangles is believed to correlate with cognitive decline in several neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease. Recent studies suggest that tau's interactions with the cell membrane could serve as a toxicity pathway and also enhance fibrillation into paired helical filaments (PHFs). Conformational changes associated with tau-membrane interactions are poorly understood, and their characterization could improve our understanding of tau pathogenicity. In this study, we investigated the molecular level structural changes associated with the interaction of the tau hexapeptide PHF6 with model lipid membranes and characterized the effects of these interactions on membrane stability and peptide fibrillation. We used two PHF6 forms, the aggregation-prone PHF6 with N-terminal acetylation (Ac-PHF6) and the non-aggregation prone PHF6 with a standard N terminus (NH3+-PHF6). We found that both PHF6 peptides are neurotoxic and exhibit similar membrane-mediated changes, consisting of: 1) favorable interactions with anionic membranes, 2) membrane destabilization through lipid extraction, and 3) membrane-mediated fibrillation. The rate at which these changes occurred was the main difference between the two peptides. NH3+-PHF6 displayed slow membrane-mediated fibrillation after 6 days of incubation, whereas Ac-PHF6 adopted a β-sheet conformation at the surface of the membrane within hours. Ac-PHF6 interactions with the membrane were also accompanied by membrane invagination and rapid membrane destabilization. Overall, our results reveal that membrane interactions could play a critical role in tau toxicity and fibrillation, and highlight that unraveling these interactions is important for significantly advancing the development of therapeutic strategies to manage tau-associated neurodegenerative diseases.

There are several hypothesized mechanisms by which amyloid proteins interact with and destabilize lipid membranes. Amyloid-β (Aβ), α-synuclein and amylin proteins have been described to form “ion-channel-like structures” on the cell membrane (19Quist A. Doudevski I. Lin H. Azimova R. Ng D. Frangione B. Kagan B.

Aβ and α-synuclein have also been shown to remodel lipid membranes through a “carpeting-effect mechanism” (21Williams T.L. Serpell L.C.

Membrane disruption can also be caused by a “detergent-like mechanism” as observed with Aβ (21Williams T.L. Serpell L.C.

Tau protein was also shown to extract lipids through a similar mechanism leading to the formation of stable protein-lipid complexes (17Ait-Bouziad N. Lv G. Mahul-Mellier A.-L. Xiao S. Zorludemir G.

In tau protein, three segments located in the MTB domain (253–261, 315–323, and 346–355) have been found to bind to lipid membranes and adopt a helical structure that promotes protein aggregation by enhancing protein-protein interactions (18Georgieva E.R.

Truncated tau constructs, for example, K18, K19, and K32, have been routinely used as model tau proteins to investigate tau aggregation and pathological properties. Thus, insights gained about the membrane interaction, fibrillation, and toxicity of the PHF6 peptide will enhance our understanding of tau's role in neurodegenerative diseases and could lead to significant advancement in the development of therapeutic strategies to manage tau-associated neurodegenerative diseases. We investigated the molecular level structural changes associated with the insertion of two PHF6 isoforms into lipid membranes and explored the effects on membrane stability and peptide fibrillation. After characterizing fibrillation of both peptides, their neuronal cell toxicity was evaluated. Angstrom level structural changes associated with PHF6 insertion into a lipid monolayer membrane at the air/water interface were investigated by in situ synchrotron X-ray reflectivity (XR) and grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD). The membrane-mediated conformational changes and fibrillation of PHF6 were also characterized in the presence of large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs). We found that both peptides preferentially inserted into the negatively charged lipid membrane, which led to different conformational changes; NH3+-PHF6 inserted into the lipid membrane, whereas Ac-PHF6 formed a layer at the surface. Despite different macroscale events, both PHF6s disrupted membrane stability and underwent membrane-mediated fibrillation. PHF6 is an amphiphilic hexapeptide (32Sogawa K. Minoura K. In Y. Ishida T.

Although not physiological, the advantages of using PHF6 as a model tau peptide is that we can study the specific amino acids that drive tau fibrillation and learn about their interactions with lipid membranes. Full-length tau contains 351–441 amino acids, and it likely has additional membrane interactions. It would be difficult to isolate the impacts from the fibril-prone PHF6 sequence in the context of full-length tau. In this study, we characterized the structural changes associated with PHF6 upon interaction with lipid membranes and investigated its role in cell toxicity and peptide fibrillation. Two PHF6 isoforms were evaluated, nonacetylated PHF6 (NH3+-PHF6) and N-terminal acetylated PHF6 (Ac-PHF6) (Fig. 1, B and C), to investigate the influence of peptide charge on fibrillation and membrane interaction. PHF6 has been previously described to form fibrillar aggregates rich in parallel β-sheets (13Goux W.J. Kopplin L. Nguyen A.D. Leak K. Rutkofsky M. Shanmuganandam V.D. Sharma D. Inouye H.

In this study we evaluated the capability of NH3+-PHF6 (net charge at pH 6: +1) and Ac-PHF6 (net charge at pH 6: 0) to form fibrils by incubating the peptides in MilliQ water at 3 mg/ml at 70 °C for 3 days. As shown by TEM images in Fig. 2, A and C, unincubated NH3+-PHF6 and Ac-PHF6 showed very few features indicating that both peptides are soluble and likely monomeric. After 3 days of incubation at 70 °C, only Ac-PHF6 formed characteristic amyloid fibrils (Fig. 2D), whereas NH3+-PHF6 remained unaggregated (Fig. 2B). These results are consistent with previous findings (13Goux W.J. Kopplin L. Nguyen A.D. Leak K. Rutkofsky M. Shanmuganandam V.D. Sharma D. Inouye H. Kirschner D.A. The formation of straight and twisted filaments from short tau peptides.J. Biol.

Shorter Ac-PHF6 fibrils were also produced from the long fibrils after 30 min of sonication (Fig. 2E). This short fibril solution was composed of smaller protofibrils with lengths in the 50–250 nm range and small globular structures with diameters around 16 nm. We next evaluated neuronal toxicity of unincubated NH3+-PHF6, unincubated Ac-PHF6, and long and short Ac-PHF6 fibrils on cultured neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells by MTS assay. This assay is routinely used to evaluate cytotoxicity and has been previously used to evaluate toxicity of full-length tau (33Flach K. Hilbrich I. Schiffmann A. Gärtner U. Krüger M. Leonhardt M.

Compared with untreated cells (control), cells treated with unincubated and fibrillar PHF6 displayed lower levels of cell viability (p ≤ 0.01), with final viabilities lower than the 70% threshold generally considered for cytotoxicity (34Standardization, ISOISO 10993–5: biological evaluation of medical devices: part 5: tests for in vitro cytotoxicity. ISO Geneva, Switzerland2009Google Scholar). No significant difference in cell viability was observed between cells treated with unincubated NH3+-PHF6 and Ac-PHF6. Additionally, both short and long Ac-PHF6 fibrils exhibited high toxicity with the short fibrils being the most cytotoxic with less than 25% viability. The higher toxicity observed for the short fibrils is supported by previous studies showing that pre-fibrillar amyloid aggregates (oligomers and protofibrils) made of full-length tau, β-amyloid, or α-synuclein display higher toxicity compared with their full-length fibril counterparts (35Bhaskar K.

Two stains were used, calcein-AM and ethidium homodimer-1 (EthD1). Live cells were stained green by the conversion of the cell-permeant calcein-AM to green fluorescent calcein dye (excitation at 494 nm, emission at 517 nm). Membrane-compromised cells were stained red from binding of the noncell-permeant EthD1 to DNA that induces fluorescence turn-on (excitation at 528 nm, emission at 617 nm). After incubating the neuroblastoma cells with 10 μm unincubated NH3+-PHF6, unincubated Ac-PHF6, or fibrillar Ac-PHF6 (long and short) for 24 h, fluorescence images were taken (Fig. 4A) and the number of dead cells was quantified (Fig. 4B). Compared with the untreated control, all PHF6 samples caused significant increases in dead counts (cells/mm2) (p ≤ 0.01), indicating that PHF6 caused membrane permeation that could contribute to the peptide's toxicity. Comparable results were obtained for both unincubated NH3+-PHF6 and Ac-PHF6, indicating no significant difference in their membrane permeation activity. Additionally, the β-sheet–rich fibrils caused higher dead cell counts (Fig. 4B) than the unincubated peptides. Taken together, our results show that both NH3+-PHF6 and Ac-PHF6 are cytotoxic and the fibrillar state is more toxic and membrane disruptive compared with the unaggregated state. One hypothesized mechanism of amyloid protein toxicity is the disruption of cell membrane structure and function via direct protein-membrane interactions. Indeed, the live/dead staining assay results show a correlation between PHF6 peptide toxicity and membrane permeabilization. To characterize PHF6 interactions with the cell membrane, we used lipid monolayers formed at the air/water interface in a Langmuir trough as a model membrane system. Two lipids were used, zwitterionic DMPC and anionic DMPG. The insertion of NH3+-PHF6 or Ac-PHF6 into monolayers was measured, whereas the monolayer surface area was held constant (Fig. 5). As such, favorable interactions that cause tau to insert into the lipid monolayer led to increases in surface pressure. Both PHF6 peptides readily inserted into anionic DMPG monolayers, causing initial fast increases in surface pressure after injecting the peptides into the subphase (Fig. 5). Consistent with previously published findings with hTau40 (25Jones E.M. Dubey M. Camp P.J. Vernon B.C. Biernat J. Mandelkow E. Majewski J. Chi E.Y.

To support this statement, the aims of this study were: (i) describe the collective behavioural patterns that relies upon the use of player positioning in interaction with teammates, opponents and ball positioning; (ii) and define the underlying structure among the variables through application of a factorial analysis. The sample comprised a total of 1,413 ball possession sequences, obtained from twelve elite football matches from one team (the team ended the season in the top-5 position). The dynamic position of the players (from both competing teams), as well as the ball, were captured and transformed to two-dimensional coordinates. Data included the ball possession sequences from six matches played against top opponents (TOP, the three teams classified in the first 3 places at the end of the season) and six matches against bottom opponents (BOTTOM, the three teams classified in the last 3 at the end of the season). The variables calculated for each ball possession were the following: ball position; team space in possession; game space (comprising the outfield players of both teams); position and space at the end of ball possession. Statistical comparisons were carried with magnitude-based decisions and null-hypothesis analysis and factor analysis to define the underlying structure among variables according to the considered contexts. Results showed that playing against TOP opponents, there was ~38 meters game length per ~43 meters game width with 12% of coefficient of variation (%). Ball possessions lasted for ~28 seconds and tended to end at ~83m of pitch length. Against BOTTOM opponents, a decrease in the game length with an increase in game width and in the deepest location was observed in comparison with playing against TOP opponents. The duration of ball possession increased considerable (~37 seconds), and the ball speed entropy was higher, suggesting lower levels of regularity in comparison with TOP opponents. The BOTTOM teams revealed a small EPS. The Principal Component Analysis showed a strong association of the ball speed, entropy of the ball speed and the coefficient of variation (%) of the ball speed. The EPS of the team in possession was well correlated with the game space, especially the game width facing TOP opponents. Against BOTTOM opponents, there was a strong association of ball possession duration, game width, distance covered by the ball, and length/width ratio of the ball movement. The overall approach carried out in this study may serve as the starting point to elaborate normative models of positioning behaviours measures to support the coaches’ operating decisions."

Renal Cyp27b1 and Cyp24a1 expression levels are transcriptionally regulated in a highly reciprocal manner by parathyroid hormone (PTH), fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), and 1,25(OH)2D3. In contrast, Cyp24a1 regulation in nonrenal target cells (NRTCs) is limited to induction by 1,25(OH)2D3. Herein, we used ChIP-Seq analyses of mouse tissues to identify regulatory regions within the Cyp24a1 gene locus. We found an extended region downstream of Cyp24a1 containing a cluster of sites, termed C24-DS1, binding PTH-sensitive cAMP-responsive element–binding protein (CREB) and a cluster termed C24-DS2 binding the vitamin D receptor (VDR). VDR-occupied sites were present in both the kidney and NRTCs, but pCREB sites were occupied only in the kidney. We deleted each segment in the mouse and observed that although the overt phenotypes of both cluster deletions were unremarkable, RNA analysis in the C24-DS1–deleted strain revealed a loss of basal renal Cyp24a1 expression, total resistance to FGF23 and PTH regulation, and secondary suppression of renal Cyp27b1; 1,25(OH)2D3 induction remained unaffected in all tissues. In contrast, loss of the VDR cluster in the C24-DS2–deleted strain did not affect 1,25(OH)2D3 induction of renal Cyp24a1 expression yet reduced but did not eliminate Cyp24a1 responses in NRTCs. We conclude that a chromatin-based mechanism differentially regulates Cyp24a1 in the kidney and NRTCs and is essential for the specific functions of Cyp24a1 in these two tissue types."
https://openalex.org/W2969747423,"Recent studies reveal the occasional impact of single neurons on surround firing statistics and even simple behaviors. Exploiting the advantages of a simple cortex, we examined the influence of single pyramidal neurons on surrounding cortical circuits. Brief activation of single neurons triggered reliable sequences of firing in tens of other excitatory and inhibitory cortical neurons, reflecting cascading activity through local networks, as indicated by delayed yet precisely timed polysynaptic subthreshold potentials. The evoked patterns were specific to the pyramidal cell of origin, extended over hundreds of micrometers from their source, and unfolded over up to 200 ms. Simultaneous activation of pyramidal cell pairs indicated balanced control of population activity, preventing paroxysmal amplification. Single cortical pyramidal neurons can thus trigger reliable postsynaptic activity that can propagate in a reliable fashion through cortex, generating rapidly evolving and non-random firing sequences reminiscent of those observed in mammalian hippocampus during “replay” and in avian song circuits."

Here, using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), immunological detection, MS-based analyses, and cGMP and H2S assays, we show that 17β-estradiol (E2) rapidly enhances endothelial H2S release in a nongenomic manner. We found that E2 induces phosphorylation of cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE), the key enzyme in vascular endothelial H2S generation. Mechanistically, E2 enhanced the interaction of membrane ERα with the Gα subunit Gαi-2/3, which then transactivated particulate guanylate cyclase-A (pGC-A) to produce cGMP, thereby activating protein kinase G type I (PKG-I). We also found that PKG-Iβ, but not PKG-Iα, interacts with CSE, leading to its phosphorylation, and rapidly induces endothelial H2S release. Furthermore, we report that silencing of either CSE or pGC-A in mice attenuates E2-induced aorta vasodilation.

https://openalex.org/W2969831952,"Single-point incremental forming (SPIF) is a technology that allows incremental manufacturing of complex parts from a flat sheet using simple tools; further, this technology is flexible and economical. Measuring the forming force using this technology helps in preventing failures, determining the optimal processes, and implementing on-line control. In this paper, an experimental study using SPIF is described. This study focuses on the influence of four different process parameters, namely, step size, tool diameter, sheet thickness, and feed rate, on the maximum forming force. For an efficient force predictive model based on an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), an artificial neural network (ANN) and a regressions model were applied. The predicted forces exhibited relatively good agreement with the experimental results. The results indicate that the performance of the ANFIS model realizes the full potential of the ANN model."
https://openalex.org/W2969286249,"Parenting behavior is a key factor in children’s socio-emotional development. However, little is known about similarities and differences in maternal and paternal parenting behavior, as most studies have focused on mothers. The present study investigated similarities and differences in mothers’ and fathers’ parenting behavior during observed free play with their preschool children, in a Danish well-resourced sample. We examined differences in mean scores and associations between mothers’ and fathers’ sensitivity, intrusiveness and limit-setting assessed with the Coding Interactive Behavior instrument. Additionally, we conducted confirmatory factor analysis to test the model-fit between the measurement model and parental data. Exploratory factor analysis was conducted to investigate if maternal and paternal factor structures replicated the three parenting constructs, and to explore if certain parenting behaviors seemed specifically related to either mothering or fathering. Participants included 52 mothers, 41 fathers and their 5-year old children. Similar mean scores were found for mothers and fathers on all parenting constructs. Maternal and paternal parenting behavior were not correlated. Confirmatory factor analysis revealed a poor model-fit. For both mothers and fathers, latent factors related to sensitivity, intrusiveness and limit-setting emerged, which indicated that the Coding Interactive Behavior instrument was suitable for assessment of both maternal and paternal sensitivity, intrusiveness and limit-setting. However, item loadings suggested that the instrument assessed maternal sensitivity more accurately than paternal sensitivity in our sample. Two additional factors were retrieved for fathers, i.e. paternal performance and challenging behavior, and paternal teaching behavior. This finding may suggest that additional parenting constructs need to be developed for researchers to be able to thoroughly investigate similarities and differences in mothers’ and fathers’ parenting behavior. Despite difference in factor structure, we did not identify behaviors solely related to mothering or to fathering."
https://openalex.org/W2969497645,"Background Although breast Self-Examination is no longer tenable as a standard method to detect early breast cancer, world health organization recommends breast self -examination for raising awareness of women about breast cancer. Secondary prevention through monthly breast self-examination is the best option to tackle the rising incidence of breast cancer. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess breast self -examination practice and associated factors. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted from April 23 to May 23, 2018. A total of 421 female workers in Debre Tabor Town public health facilities were included. The study participants were selected using simple random sampling technique from the study population. The collected data were checked for completeness. The data were entered and cleaned using EpiData version 3.1 then exported to SPSS version 20 for analysis. Crude odd ratio and probability value were identified for each independent variable and all independent variables with probability value of less than 0.2 were entered into multivariables logistic regression. Statistically significant associated factors were identified based on probability value (p-value) less than 0.05 and adjusted odd ratio with 95% confidence interval. Result The mean age of participants was 25.2 (S.D = 4.12) and 137 (32.5%) of the participants had practiced breast self -examination and 64 (15.2%) of them performed it monthly. Family history of breast cancer (adjusted OR = 6.5, CI = 1.54–21.4), Knowledge about breast -self examination (adjusted OR = 5.74, CI = 2.3–14.4) and self- efficacy in practicing breast self -examination (adjusted OR = 4.7, CI = 1.84–12.11) were significantly associated with breast self -examination practice. Conclusions The study showed that the prevalence of breast self-examination was low. Family history of breast cancer, knowledge about breast self -examination and self- efficacy in practicing breast self- examination did have statistically significant association with breast self—examination practice."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the levels of VEGF in tears and serum amongst type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) patients. Methods A comparative cross-sectional study was conducted between August 2016 and May 2018 involving type 2 DM patients with no DR, non-proliferative DR (NPDR), and proliferative DR (PDR). Tear samples were collected using no.41 Whatman filter paper (Schirmer strips) and 5 mL blood samples were drawn by venous puncture. VEGF levels in tears and serum were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results A total of 88 type 2 DM patients (no DR: 30 patients, NPDR: 28 patients, PDR: 30 patients) were included in the study. Mean tear VEGF levels were significantly higher in the NPDR and PDR groups (114.4 SD 52.5 pg/mL and 150.8 SD 49.7 pg/mL, respectively) compared to the no DR group (40.4 SD 26.5 pg/mL, p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in the mean serum VEGF levels between the three groups. There was a fair correlation between serum and tear VEGF levels (p = 0.015, r = 0.263). Conclusion VEGF levels in tears were significantly higher amongst diabetic patients with DR compared to those without DR and were significantly associated with the severity of DR. There was a fair correlation between serum and tear VEGF levels. Detection of VEGF in tears is a good non-invasive predictor test for the severity of DR. A large cohort study is needed for further evaluation."

Currently, the United States Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends anyone ages 50-75 and/or with a family history to be screened for CRC. To improve screening specificity and sensitivity, we have built an artificial neural network (ANN) trained on 12 to 14 categories of personal health data from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). Years 1997-2016 of the NHIS contain 583,770 respondents who had never received a diagnosis of any cancer and 1409 who had received a diagnosis of CRC within 4 years of taking the survey. The trained ANN has sensitivity of 0.57 ± 0.03, specificity of 0.89 ± 0.02, positive predictive value of 0.0075 ± 0.0003, negative predictive value of 0.999 ± 0.001, and concordance of 0.80 ± 0.05 per the guidelines of Transparent Reporting of Multivariable Prediction Model for Individual Prognosis or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) level 2a, comparable to current risk-scoring methods. To demonstrate clinical applicability, both USPSTF guidelines and the trained ANN are used to stratify respondents to the 2017 NHIS into low-, medium- and high-risk categories (TRIPOD levels 4 and 2b, respectively). The number of CRC respondents misclassified as low risk is decreased from 35% by screening guidelines to 5% by ANN (in 60 cases). The number of non-CRC respondents misclassified as high risk is decreased from 53% by screening guidelines to 6% by ANN (in 25,457 cases). Our results demonstrate a robustly-tested method of stratifying CRC risk that is non-invasive, cost-effective, and easy to implement publicly."
https://openalex.org/W2969435772,"Background Irrational use of antibiotics is a major driver of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) worldwide. Sub-Saharan Africa, where the risk of spread of AMR is highest, lacks data on the knowledge, attitudes and practices regarding antibiotic prescription and use. This is the first study in Mozambique to address this gap. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in 2016 in 1091 adults (age ≥18 years) living in five districts in peri-urban areas of Maputo City. Three stage cluster sampling was used to select the households. A semi-structured questionnaire was used to collect information on the knowledge, attitudes and practices regarding antibiotics and their use and socio-demographic data. Results Of the 1091 participants, 20.9% (228/1091) had used non-prescribed antibiotics. Most of the non-prescribed antibiotics were purchased in pharmacies (199/228; 87.3%). The proportion of use of non-prescribed antibiotics was higher in those who purchased from informal markets (82.6%; 14/17) and home stores (66.7%; 12/18), compared to pharmacies (24.6%; 199/810) (p = 0.000). Variables significantly associated with use of non-prescribed antibiotics were male gender (p = 0.004), living in the Central A (p<0.001), Aeroporto B (p<0.001) or 25 de Junho (p<0.001) neighborhoods, purchase of antibiotics in informal markets (p<0.002) or obtaining from home stores (p = 0.026), not completing the course (p<0.001) and having poor knowledge on the use of antibiotics (p<0.001). Main reasons for use of non-prescribed antibiotics were a perception that there was no need to attend a health facility (26.8%), followed by someone else’s advice (7.7%), symptoms similar to a previous episode (6.2%) and poor quality of care in health facilities (6.7%). Conclusions Our study shows for the first time that knowledge regarding antibiotics is poor in Maputo City. Purchase of non-prescribed antibiotics is a common practice and most are sold in pharmacies, indicating deficient inspection. Interventions to reinforce adherence by pharmacies to current legislation for dispensing antibiotics, combined with community education are urgently needed."
https://openalex.org/W2969290152,"Plant defense responses to biotic stresses are complex biological processes, all governed by sophisticated molecular regulations. Induced systemic resistance (ISR) is one of these defense mechanisms where beneficial bacteria or fungi prime plants to resist pathogens or pest attacks. In ISR, the defense arsenal in plants remains dormant and it is only triggered by an infection, allowing a better allocation of plant resources. Our group recently described that the well-known beneficial bacterium Paraburkholderia phytofirmans PsJN is able to induce Arabidopsis thaliana resistance to Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst) DC3000 through ISR, and that ethylene, jasmonate and salicylic acid are involved in this protection. Nevertheless, the molecular networks governing this beneficial interaction remain unknown. To tackle this issue, we analyzed the temporal changes in the transcriptome of PsJN-inoculated plants before and after being infected with Pst DC3000. These data were used to perform a gene network analysis to identify highly connected transcription factors. Before the pathogen challenge, the strain PsJN regulated 405 genes (corresponding to 1.8% of the analyzed genome). PsJN-inoculated plants presented a faster and stronger transcriptional response at 1-hour post infection (hpi) compared with the non-inoculated plants, which presented the highest transcriptional changes at 24 hpi. A principal component analysis showed that PsJN-induced plant responses to the pathogen could be differentiated from those induced by the pathogen itself. Forty-eight transcription factors were regulated by PsJN at 1 hpi, and a system biology analysis revealed a network with four clusters. Within these clusters LHY, WRKY28, MYB31 and RRTF1 are highly connected transcription factors, which could act as hub regulators in this interaction. Concordantly with our previous results, these clusters are related to jasmonate, ethylene, salicylic, acid and ROS pathways. These results indicate that a rapid and specific response of PsJN-inoculated plants to the virulent DC3000 strain could be the pivotal element in the protection mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2969362972,"Introduction Long-term treatment is used in patients with osteoporosis, and bisphosphonates (BPs) are the most commonly prescribed medications. However, in some patients this therapy is not effective, cause different side effects and complications. Unfortunately, at least one year is needed to identify and confirm an ineffectiveness of BPs therapy on bone mineral density (BMD). Among other factors, a response to BPs therapy may also be explained by genetic factors. The aim of this study was to analyze the influence of SOST, PTH, FGF2, FDPS, GGPS1, and LRP5 gene variants on the response to treatment with aminobisphosphonates. Materials and methods Women with postmenopausal osteoporosis were included to this study if they used aminobisphosphonates for at least 12 months. Exclusion criteria were: persistence on BPs therapy less than 80%, bone metabolic diseases, diseases deemed to affect bone metabolism, malignant tumours, using of any medications influencing BMD. The study protocol was approved by the local ethics committee. The BMD at the lumbar spine and femoral neck were measured using dual x-ray absorptiometry (GE Lunar) before and at least 12 months after treatment with BPs. According to BMD change, patients were divided in two groups–responders and non-responders to BPs terapy. Polymorphic variants in SOST, PTH, FGF2, FDPS, GGPS1, and LRP5 genes were determined using PCR analysis with TaqMan probes (Thermo Scientific). Results In total, 201 women with BPs therapy were included in the study. No statistically significant differences were observed in age, age at menopause, weight, height, BMI and baseline BMD levels between responders (122 subjects) and non-responders (79 subjects). As single markers, the SOST rs1234612 T/T (OR = 2.3; P = 0.02), PTH rs7125774 T/T (OR = 2.8, P = 0.0009), FDPS rs2297480 G/G (OR = 29.3, P = 2.2×10−7), and GGPS1 rs10925503 C/C+C/T (OR = 2.9; P = 0.003) gene variants were over-represented in non-responders group. No significant association between FGF2 rs6854081 and LRP5 rs3736228 gene variants and response to BPs treatment was observed. The carriers of T-T-G-C allelic combination (constructed from rs1234612, rs7125774, rs2297480, and rs10925503) were predisposed to negative response to BPs treatment (OR = 4.9, 95% CI 1.7–14.6, P = 0.005). The C-C-T-C combination was significantly over-represented in responders (OR = 0.1, 95% CI 0.1–0.5, P = 0.006). Conclusions Our findings highlight the importance of identified single gene variants and their allelic combinations for pharmacogenetics of BPs therapy of osteoporosis. Complex screening of these genetic markers could be used as a new strategy for personalized antiresorptive therapy."

Methods We evaluated the association between AP mortality and clinical parameters at the time of admission in patients with AP from April 2013 to December 2017 at one university hospital and one tertiary care referral center. Results A total of 203 consecutive patients were enrolled. Nine patients (4.4%) died despite multidisciplinary treatment. In a multivariable analysis, hematocrit ≥ 40% (odds ratio [OR], 1.07; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01–1.13; P = 0.021), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) ≥ 40 mg/dL (OR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.11–1.42; P < 0.001), base excess < -3.0 mmol/L (OR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.04–1.26; P = 0.004), and inflammation extending to the rectovesical excavation (OR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.10–1.30; P < 0.001) on admission were significantly associated with mortality. Conclusion Among the imaging findings, inflammation extending to the rectovesical excavation was the only independent predictive factor for mortality in AP. This simple finding, obtained on computed tomography without contrast agent on admission, might be a promising prognostic factor for AP."
https://openalex.org/W2969861543,"The family of ribosomal proteins S1 contains about 20% of all bacterial proteins including the S1 domain. An important feature of this family is multiple copies of structural domains in bacteria, the number of which changes in a strictly limited range from one to six. In this study, the automated exhaustive analysis of 1453 sequences of S1 allowed us to demonstrate that the number of domains in S1 is a distinctive characteristic for phylogenetic bacterial grouping in main phyla. 1453 sequences of S1 were identified in 25 out of 30 different phyla according to the List of Prokaryotic Names with Standing in Nomenclature. About 62% of all records are identified as six-domain S1 proteins, which belong to phylum Proteobacteria. Four-domain S1 are identified mainly in proteins from phylum Firmicutes and Actinobacteria. Records belonging to these phyla are 33% of all records. The least represented two-domain S1 are about 0.6% of all records. The third and fourth domains for the most representative four- and six-domain S1 have the highest percentage of identity with the S1 domain from polynucleotide phosphorylase and S1 domains from one-domain S1. In addition, for these groups, the central part of S1 (the third domain) is more conserved than the terminal domains."

However, previous studies of vtRNAs, for example in mammalian cells, have failed to reach a definitive conclusion about their function. vtRNAs are related to Y RNAs, which are complexed with Ro protein and influence Ro's function in noncoding RNA (ncRNA) quality control and processing. In Trypanosoma brucei, the small noncoding TBsRNA-10 was first described in a survey of the ncRNA repertoire in this organism. Here, we report that TBsRNA-10 in T. brucei is a vtRNA, based on its association with TEP1 and sequence similarity to those of other known and predicted vtRNAs. We observed that like vtRNAs in other species, TBsRNA-10 is transcribed by RNA polymerase III, which in trypanosomes also generates the spliceosomal U-rich small nuclear RNAs. In T. brucei, spliced leader (SL)-mediated trans-splicing of pre-mRNAs is an obligatory step in gene expression, and we found here that T. brucei's vtRNA is highly enriched in a non-nucleolar locus in the cell nucleus implicated in SL RNP biogenesis. Using a newly developed permeabilized cell system for the bloodstream form of T. brucei, we show that down-regulated vtRNA levels impair trans-spliced mRNA production, consistent with a role of vtRNA in trypanosome mRNA metabolism. Our results suggest a common theme for the functions of vtRNAs and Y RNAs. We conclude that by complexing with their protein-binding partners TEP1 and Ro, respectively, these two RNA species modulate the metabolism of various RNA classes.

https://openalex.org/W2969399966,"Background Positive Behaviour Support (PBS) for challenging behaviour is a complex intervention. Process evaluation is pivotal in fully understanding the mechanisms and contextual factors that impact on participant outcomes. Aims To conduct a process evaluation of a national clinical trial investigating the impact of PBS-based staff training on the level of challenging behaviour in adults with intellectual disability. Method The Medical Research Council guidance for process evaluation of complex interventions was followed. Semi-structured interviews with 62 stakeholders from the intervention arm (service users, family and paid carers, service managers, staff who delivered the intervention and PBS trainers), quantitative data from the study database and an external evaluation of the quality of the PBS plans were used. Results Twenty-one health staff volunteered to be trained in delivering PBS. Available log data from 17 therapists revealed that they worked with 63 participants a median of 11.50 hours (IQR 8–32). Only 33 out of 108 reports had included all elements of the intervention. Another 47 reports had some elements of the intervention. All PBS plans were rated weak, indicating insufficient quality to impact challenging behaviour. Stakeholders reported an appreciation of PBS and its potential to impact quality of care and engagement with the participant. However, they also identified important challenges including managing PBS-related caseloads, paid carer turnover and service commitment to the delivery of PBS. Conclusions PBS-based staff training was well received, but therapists found it difficult to undertake all the elements of the intervention in routine care. Implementing a workforce training strategy is important to better define the active components of PBS, and resource implications if the intervention is no better than usual care."
https://openalex.org/W2969783788,"The highly conserved C1q/TNF-related protein (CTRP) family of secreted hormones has emerged as important regulators of insulin action and of sugar and fat metabolisms. Among these, the specific biological function of CTRP2 remains elusive. Here, we show that the expression of human CTRP2 is positively correlated with body mass index (BMI) and is up-regulated in obesity. We used a knockout (KO) mouse model to determine CTRP2 function and found that Ctrp2-KO mice have significantly elevated metabolic rates and energy expenditure leading to lower body weights and lower adiposity. CTRP2 deficiency up-regulated the expression of lipolytic enzymes and protein kinase A signaling, resulting in enhanced adipose tissue lipolysis. In cultured adipocytes, CTRP2 treatment suppressed triglyceride (TG) hydrolysis, and its deficiency enhanced agonist-induced lipolysis in vivo. CTRP2-deficient mice also had altered hepatic and plasma lipid profiles. Liver size and hepatic TG content were significantly reduced, but plasma TG was elevated in KO mice. Both plasma and hepatic cholesterol levels, however, were reduced in KO mice. Loss of CTRP2 also enhanced hepatic TG secretion and contributed to impaired plasma lipid clearance following an oral lipid gavage. Liver metabolomic analysis revealed significant changes in diacylglycerols and phospholipids, suggesting that increased membrane remodeling may underlie the altered hepatic TG secretion we observed.

Expression of CTRP2 in both omental and subcutaneous fat depots was positively correlated with body mass index (BMI) in humans (Fig. 1, B and C). Compared with lean controls, CTRP2 expression was markedly up-regulated in both the omental and subcutaneous fat depots of obese individuals with and without type 2 diabetes (Fig. 1, D and E). high-fat diet body mass index body weight energy expenditure epididymal white adipose tissue glucose tolerance tests high-density lipoprotein insulin tolerance tests inguinal white adipose tissue low-density lipoprotein low-fat diet lipoprotein lipase oral fat tolerance tests phosphatidylcholines phosphatidylethanolamines respiratory exchange ratio type 2 diabetes triglyceride tumor necrosis factor very low-density lipoprotein. A genetic loss-of-function mouse model was used to determine the metabolic role of CTRP2 in vivo (Fig. 2A). Two sets of primers were designed to amplify a sequence spanning intron 2 and exon 3 of the WT allele and a sequence spanning the downstream deletion site in the lacZ gene to confirm the genotype of WT and KO mice, respectively (Fig. 2B). As expected from targeted disruption of the gene, Ctrp2 mRNA was absent from the epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT) of KO mice (Fig. 2C). Ctrp2 KO mice were born at the expected Mendelian ratio and appeared normal with no gross developmental abnormalities. Although Ctrp2 mRNA is expressed at low levels during embryonic development (12Wong G.W. Krawczyk S.A. Kitidis-Mitrokostas C. Revett T. Gimeno R. Lodish H.F.

To determine the contribution of CTRP2 to systemic energy metabolism in the normal and obese states, WT and Ctrp2 KO male and female mice were fed an HFD or a control LFD for 16 weeks, beginning at 5 weeks of age. In both LFD- and HFD-fed groups, we observed reduced body weight in male KO mice compared with WT littermates. However, there were no differences between female WT and KO mice on either diet (Fig. 3, A and B). For this reason, we chose to focus our metabolic analyses on male mice. In the LFD-fed group, Ctrp2 KO mice showed reduced whole-body fat mass accounting for the reduced body weight relative to WT littermates. However, in the HFD-fed group, reduced body weight of KO mice was because of a significant reduction in both fat and lean mass (Fig. 3C). No differences in food intake or total physical activity were seen between genotypes (Fig. 3, D and E). However, elevated metabolic rate, indicated by reduced respiratory exchange ratio (RER) and reflected by increased oxygen consumption rate (V˙O2) and increased fat oxidation, were observed in LFD-fed KO mice (Fig. 3, F and H). In contrast, increased CO2 production rate (V˙CO2) was only seen in HFD-fed KO mice (Fig. 3G). Accordingly, both LFD- and HFD-fed KO mice had significantly increased energy expenditure, and the effect was much more pronounced in the LFD-fed KO mice (Fig. 3, I and J). For this reason, we focused our functional studies on LFD-fed mice. Consistent with the Echo-MRI results, the weight and size of visceral (eWAT) and subcutaneous (iWAT) fat depots were markedly reduced in Ctrp2 KO male mice relative to WT littermates (Fig. 4, A–D). Histological evaluation of adipocyte morphology in eWAT showed no significant differences between genotypes (Fig. 4E). To determine whether altered lipolysis contributes to reduced adipose tissue weight, we examined the three key enzymes (ATGL, HSL, MGL) involved in triglyceride hydrolysis (32Duncan R.E. Ahmadian M. Jaworski K. Sarkadi-Nagy E. Sul H.S. Regulation of lipolysis in adipocytes.Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2007; 27 (17313320): 79-10110.1146/annurev.nutr.27.061406.093734Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar) in the fasted states, in which tissues were collected after food was removed for 4 h. Both mRNA and protein expression of these enzymes were significantly up-regulated in the KO mice (Fig. 4, F–H). In addition, phosphorylation of PKA substrates were also strikingly elevated in the KO mice, implicating enhanced PKA signaling in promoting adipose tissue lipolysis (Fig. 4I). Next, we tested whether stimulated in vivo lipolysis in response to β3-adregenic receptor agonist (CL316243) was also elevated in the KO mice. Plasma free fatty acid (FFA) and glycerol levels were induced by CL316243 to a significantly greater extent in KO mice than in WT controls (Fig. 4, J and K). In differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes, forskolin can robustly increase cAMP accumulation and promote lipolysis (33Litosch I. Hudson T.H. Mills I. Li S.Y. Fain J.N. Forskolin as an activator of cyclic AMP accumulation and lipolysis in rat adipocytes.Mol. Pharmacol. 1982; 22 (6289066): 109-115PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether CTRP2 has a direct effect on forskolin-stimulated lipolysis, different concentrations of purified recombinant mouse CTRP2 protein were used to treat differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Both 5 μg/ml and 10 μg/ml of CTRP2 markedly suppressed adipocyte lipolysis in response to forskolin (Fig. 4L). Together, these results support a role for CTRP2 in regulating adipose tissue lipolysis in vitro and in vivo. In contrast to lipid metabolism, whole-body glucose metabolism was not appreciably affected by CTRP2 deficiency when mice were fed a control LFD; neither glucose nor insulin tolerance test results were different between genotypes (Fig. 4, M and N). In the fasted state, plasma triglyceride (TG) levels were significantly higher in KO mice compared with WT littermates, and the TG content of very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles was ∼1.8-fold greater in the KO mice (Fig. 5, A and B). No differences in fecal TG content were noted between genotypes (Fig. 5C), indicating that elevated plasma TG levels could not be because of reduced fecal TG excretion. Although plasma TG concentration was much higher, total plasma cholesterol was significantly reduced in KO mice (Fig. 5D). Cholesterol content was strikingly reduced in the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particle fractions (Fig. 5E). Fecal cholesterol content was also reduced, excluding fecal excretion as a cause of reduced plasma cholesterol levels (Fig. 5F). In striking contrast to the plasma lipid profile, the size of the mouse livers and hepatic TG content were both markedly reduced in Ctrp2 KO mice (Fig. 5, G–J). Parallel to the reduction in plasma cholesterol, we also observed reduced hepatic cholesterol content in KO mice (Fig. 5K). In striking contrast to eWAT, the expression of lipolytic genes (Atgl, Hsl, Mgl) in liver was not different between WT and KO mice (Fig. 5L). To better understand the altered TG metabolism observed in the KO mice, we performed oral fat tolerance tests (OFTT) on overnight-fasted mice to determine whether loss of CTRP2 impairs the ability of the mice to handle an acute lipid load. Following an oral lipid gavage, the Ctrp2 KO mice had a dramatic rise in serum TG compared with WT controls (Fig. 6A). When we administered lipid emulsion via intraperitoneal injection to bypass gut absorption, we still observed a significant increase in serum TG levels at 2 h post injection in the KO mice relative to WT controls (Fig. 6B), indicating that increased plasma TG following an acute lipid load is because of elevated hepatic VLDL-TG secretion or reduced lipid clearance from circulation by peripheral tissues. To test the former, we inhibited TG clearance from circulation in fasted mice by administering the nonionic surfactant poloxamer 407, an inhibitor of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) that blocks fatty acid uptake by peripheral tissues (34Millar J.S. Cromley D.A. McCoy M.G. Rader D.J. Billheimer J.T. Determining hepatic triglyceride production in mice: comparison of poloxamer 407 with Triton WR-1339.J.

In this case, circulating TG is mainly derived from VLDL-TG secreted by the liver. When lipid uptake was blocked in the fasted state, hepatic VLDL-TG secretion was significantly elevated in KO mice (Fig. 6C). LPL localized to the luminal surface of vascular endothelial cells is responsible for the bulk of TG clearance from circulation by hydrolyzing circulating TG to release FFAs for use in peripheral tissues. Heparin can be used to displace LPL from the vascular endothelium in mice and LPL activity can then be measured in post-heparin plasma. The postheparin plasma LPL activity was not significantly different between WT and KO mice (Fig. 6D). These experiments indicate that enhanced hepatic VLDL-TG secretion contributes to the marked increase in plasma TG levels in KO mice following an acute lipid load. To further examine alterations of metabolic pathways in the KO mouse liver, we performed unbiased metabolite profiling. In general, phospholipids, including phosphatidylcholines (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamines (PE), were significantly elevated, indicating increased phospholipid synthesis in the liver of KO mice (Fig. 7, A and B). Multiple intermediates of phospholipid metabolism, including CMP, cytidine 5′-diphosphocholine, glycerophosphorylcholine, cytidine 5′-diphosphoethanolamine, and glycerophosphoethanolamine, were increased in the livers of Ctrp2 KO mice (Fig. 7C). Numerous diacylglycerols (also a precursor of phospholipids), such as palmitoyl-palmitoyl-glycerol, were significantly reduced in the livers of KO mice, suggesting an increased utilization of these precursors in phospholipid synthesis (Fig. 7D). Collectively, these data suggest substantial cell membrane remodeling in the livers of CTRP2-deficient mice (Fig. 7E) which may be needed for enhanced VLDL assembly and TG secretion. Our findings provide insight into the biological function of CTRP2, an enigmatic secretory protein highly conserved from fish to human. The expression of CTRP2 was significantly up-regulated in different fat depots of obese individuals relative to healthy lean controls and was positively correlated with BMI. This correlation prompted us to use a genetic mouse model to assess the metabolic role of CTRP2 in a physiological context. It should be noted that our human data are based on limited samples from mostly Caucasian subjects. Further confirmation is needed in a larger cohort of human samples from multiple racial and ethnic groups. When fed either a control low-fat diet or a high-fat diet, Ctrp2 KO male mice gained significantly less (∼5 g less) body weight relative to WT littermate controls. This body weight phenotype appeared to be sex-dependent, as female mice lacking CTRP2 were indistinguishable from WT littermates regardless of diet, reinforcing the importance of sex as a biological variable contributing to phenotypic outcomes. Reduced body weight and fat mass in male Ctrp2 KO mice was not because of decreased food intake or increased physical activity; instead, it was attributed to increased metabolic rate and energy expenditure. Male mice lacking CTRP2 also had a lower respiratory exchange ratio, suggesting a preferential use of lipid substrates for oxidative metabolism. Loss of CTRP2 preferentially affected lipid, but not glucose, metabolism. Assessment of whole-body carbohydrate metabolism by glucose and insulin tolerance tests revealed no differences in glucose clearance and insulin sensitivity in Ctrp2 KO male mice fed a low-fat diet relative to WT littermates. Several notable lipid phenotypes were observed in the Ctrp2 KO mice. In the absence of CTRP2, we observed enhanced expression of the major lipolytic enzymes (ATGL, HSL, and MGL) at both the mRNA and protein levels in adipose tissue.

In this pathway, choline is firstly phosphorylated by choline kinase in an ATP-dependent manner to produce phosphocholine. CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CCT) then transfers a cytidyl moiety from CTP to phosphocholine to yield CDP-choline. CDP-choline is then used by choline phosphotransferase as a phosphocholine donor to convert DAG to PC.

Considering the importance of PC biosynthesis in cellular function, this process must be finely adjusted to the needs of the cells during various stages of plant growth and development as well as to the availability of substrates and the energy state of organisms. Plant sucrose nonfermenting 1–related protein kinase 1 (SnRK1) is a serine/threonine kinase that acts as an energy sensor regulating cellular metabolism in response to stress, starvation, and various growth conditions (9Wurzinger B. Nukarinen E. Nägele T. Weckwerth W. Teige M.

SnRK1 regulates the activity of key enzymes involved in various biosynthetic pathways of important cellular compounds, such as carbohydrates, amino acids, isoprenoids, and signaling sugars (10Halford N.G.

At the posttranslational level, our recent study found that SnRK1 regulates TAG accumulation through phosphorylation of diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1), an enzyme catalyzing the final committed step in acyl-CoA–dependent TAG biosynthesis (17Caldo K.M.P. Shen W. Xu Y. Hanley-Bowdoin L. Chen G. Weselake R.J. Lemieux M.J.

It was further noted that plant DGAT1 and CCT1 appear to share a common theme of regulation (19Caldo K.M.P. Acedo J.Z. Panigrahi R. Vederas J.C. Weselake R.J. Lemieux M.J. Diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 is regulated by its N-terminal domain in response to allosteric effectors.Plant Physiol. 2017; 175 (28827454): 667-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), with both having disordered regulatory domains and being activated by PA. Considering that SnRK1 regulates storage lipid biosynthesis as well as a few other important pathways related to homeostasis in plant cells, it is interesting to explore whether SnRK1 also regulates membrane lipid biosynthesis. Furthermore, because DGAT1 is regulated by SnRK1 and shares a common theme of regulation with CCT, it would also be interesting to identify whether SnRK1 regulates CCT activity as well. In this study, sequence analysis identified that AtCCT1 has a putative SnRK1 phosphorylation site that is conserved among various plant species. Homology modeling with rat (Rattus norvegicus) CCT1 predicted that the putative phosphorylation site is localized in an accessible loop region. Incubation of recombinant AtCCT1 with SnRK1.1 (hereafter referred to as SnRK1) and subsequent LC-MS/MS analysis confirmed that SnRK1 phosphorylates AtCCT1 mainly at Ser-187, which is within the catalytic domain. The phosphorylated AtCCT1 displayed a substantial decrease in enzyme activity. Mutation of Ser-187 to alanine decreased the activity, and the S187A variant was less susceptible to inhibition by SnRK1. Further truncation mutagenesis showed that phosphorylation at this site affects the catalytic domain directly, leading to enzyme inhibition rather than interfering with PA-mediated activation. Transient expression of cDNA encoding the catalytic domain of AtCCT1 in Nicotiana benthamiana drove the accumulation of PC to higher levels than the control, whereas co-expression of the AtCCT1 catalytic domain with SnRK1 reduced the observed increase in PC content. These results indicated that SnRK1 regulates plant CCT1 via phosphorylation at Ser-187, which provides a mechanistic link between de novo PC biosynthesis and energy homeostasis. Rat CCT1 has four functional domains that include the N-terminal signal for nuclear transport, catalytic core, membrane-binding regulatory domain, and C-terminal phosphorylation module (20Cornell R.B.

To examine whether plant CCT1 has a similar structure as its animal homolog, the sequence of AtCCT1 was aligned with rat CCT1. As shown in Fig. 1A and Fig. S1, both CCT1s have homologous internal domains, whereas the terminal domains are highly divergent. The internal domains include the catalytic (Fig. 1A, green) and membrane-binding domains (Fig. 1A, yellow), which exhibit 59.3% and 24.2% sequence identities, respectively, between Arabidopsis and rat CCT1. The catalytic domain of rat CCT1 is active in the absence of the membrane-binding and C-terminal domains (20Cornell R.B. Kalmar G.B. Kay R.J. Johnson M.A. Sanghera J.S. Pelech S.L.

To probe whether Arabidopsis CCT1 has the same property, the cDNAs encoding AtCCT1, AtCCT1 catalytic domain (AtCCT11–197, hereafter referred to as AtCCT1-CD), and AtCCT11–221 were recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli and partially purified through Ni-NTA (Fig. S2). AtCCT11–221 is included to check whether the catalytic domain in AtCCT1 extends beyond the last residue that aligned with the rat CCT catalytic domain. The activity of CCT1 was determined using a previously reported HPLC-based assay involving nonradiolabeled CTP and phosphocholine as substrates (22Brault J.P. Friesen J.A. Characterization of cytidylyltransferase enzyme activity through high performance liquid chromatography.Anal. Biochem. 2016; 510 (27443959): 26-3210.1016/j.ab.2016.07.018Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). CDP-choline was separated on a C18 column, and its amount was quantified based on the absorbance of the cytosine ring at 254 nm (Fig. S3). Similar to rat CCT1, purified AtCCT1-CD shows detectable CCT activity (Fig. 1B), indicating that the membrane-binding and C-terminal domains are not essential for catalysis. Although the membrane-binding domain is not important for activity, it mediates lipid-dependent activation and autoinhibition in rat CCT1 (20Cornell R.B. Kalmar G.B. Kay R.J. Johnson M.A. Sanghera J.S. Pelech S.L. Functions of the C-terminal domain of CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase: effects of C-terminal deletions on enzyme activity, intracellular localization and phosphorylation potential.Biochem. J. 1995; 310 (7654214): 699-70810.1042/bj3100699Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Because PA was identified previously as an activator of AtCCT1 in both in vivo and in vitro experiments (6Craddock C.P. Adams N. Bryant F.M. Kurup S. Eastmond P.J. Phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase regulates phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis in Arabidopsis by phosphatidic acid-mediated activation of CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase activity.Plant Cell. 2015; 27 (25862304): 1251-126410.1105/tpc.15.00037Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), purified AtCCT1 and AtCCT1-CD were assayed under increasing concentrations of PA (Fig. 1B). The activity of AtCCT1 increased by 67-fold upon addition of 50 μm PA:50 μm PC vesicles. AtCCT1-CD, on the other hand, was constitutively active and was no longer activated by PA. Furthermore, AtCCT1 exhibited activities of 183 nmol CDP-choline min−1 mg protein−1 when no lipid was added (Fig. 1B). Under the same condition, AtCCT1-CD and AtCCT11–221 were about 9-fold more active than AtCCT1, suggesting that the truncated region inhibits the enzyme. Altogether, these results show that the membrane-binding domain plays an important role in mediating both lipid-dependent activation and autoinhibition, which agrees with previous results on mammalian CCTs (23Arnold R.S. Cornell R.B. Lipid regulation of CTP: phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase: electrostatic, hydrophobic, and synergistic interactions of anionic phospholipids and diacylglycerol.Biochemistry. 1996; 35 (8703966): 9917-992410.1021/bi960397cCrossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 24Ding Z.

The rat CCT membrane-binding domain has different segments, such as the polybasic region, nonconserved portion, and autoinhibitory motif (25Lee J. Taneva S.G. Holland B.W. Tieleman D.P. Cornell R.B.

In AtCCT1, the helical diagram of corresponding regions suggested a similar amphipathic property (Fig. 1C). The first two segments covering residues 197–230 can form α-helices, with a hydrophobic face composed of leucine, isoleucine, and valine residues. The corresponding autoinhibitory motif in AtCCT1 corresponds to residues 232–252 and can also form an amphiphatic helix, with the hydrophobic face composed of leucine, valine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, and isoleucine residues. To further probe the ability of AtCCT1 to interact with membranes, liposome binding studies were carried out, and the results showed that AtCCT1 can interact weakly with PC liposomes, and the interaction was enhanced in the presence of PA (Fig. 1D). The structure of AtCCT1 was determined using SWISS-MODEL homology modeling. A rat CCT1 dimer structure (RCSB code 4MVC) (25Lee J. Taneva S.G. Holland B.W. Tieleman D.P. Cornell R.B.

Chemical cross-linking reveals a dimeric structure for CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase.J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264 (2542297): 9077-9082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The predicted AtCCT1 homology structure shows a dimer, with each monomer consisting of the entire catalytic domain and a portion of the membrane-binding domain (Fig. 2A). This agrees with DISOPRED analysis predicting that the internal domain is likely to be well-folded. The covered sequence, which includes residue 30–216, has a sequence identity of 59.12% with the template, giving a good quality structural model with a QMEAN score of −2.01. The AtCCT1 catalytic domain has an α/β fold that follows a Rossmann fold, which is commonly observed in nucleotide-binding proteins (27Rao S.T. Rossmann M.G. Comparison of super-secondary structures in proteins.J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 76 (4737475): 241-25610.1016/0022-2836(73)90388-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). Specifically, as shown in Fig. 2B, this fold has five parallel β-strands (green, numbered 1–5 starting from the N terminus) that are connected by α-helices (teal, labeled a–d). The active-site residues identified in rat CCT1 were found to be highly conserved in AtCCT1; they include Lys-80, His-47, His-50, Arg-157, and Thr-163 (25Lee J. Taneva S.G. Holland B.W. Tieleman D.P.

These residues are localized near the region below the C-terminal portion of the parallel β-sheet (Fig. 2C) and line the wall of the catalytic pocket, as shown in the surface view (Fig. 2D). Below the catalytic pocket is the αE helix, which is located in the C-terminal part of the catalytic domain (Fig. 2, A–C, dark blue). Molecular dynamics simulation studies indicated that bending of the αE helices may be important for catalysis (29Ramezanpour M. Lee J. Taneva S.G. Tieleman D.P. Cornell R.B. An auto-inhibitory helix in CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase hijacks the catalytic residue and constrains a pliable, domain-bridging helix pair.J. Biol.

The αE helix is followed by loops connecting to the membrane-binding domain. A portion of the membrane-binding domain (Fig. 2A, yellow) starts with a loop, followed by an α-helix interacting with the αE helix of the catalytic domain, indicating that the model exists as soluble inactive form. The hydrophilic N-terminal region (Fig. 1A, blue) and the C-terminal domain of rat and Arabidopsis CCT1 (Fig. S1, red), unlike the core domains, are highly divergent, exhibiting only 9.7% and 7.5% sequence identity, respectively. Furthermore, DISOPRED analysis (30Ward J.J. Sodhi J.S. McGuffin L.J. Buxton B.F. Jones D.T. Prediction and functional analysis of native disorder in proteins from the three kingdoms of life.J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 337 (15019783): 635-64510.1016/j.jmb.2004.02.002Crossref PubMed Scopus (1608) Google Scholar) indicated that the N- and C-terminal regions may have high propensity (close to a confidence score of 1.0) to be disordered in both animal and AtCCT1 (Fig. S4). To further compare rat CCT1 and AtCCT1 structures, their N- and C-terminal regions were analyzed. Unlike the N terminus of rat CCT1, with a nuclear localization signal (31Wang Y. MacDonald J.I. Kent C. Identification of the nuclear localization signal of rat liver CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270 (7814396): 354-36010.1074/jbc.270.1.354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), the N-terminal region of AtCCT1 is shorter and contains no signal sequence (Fig. 1A and Fig. S1). To explore the divergence and evolutionary relationship of plant and animal CCTs, a phylogenetic analysis was performed for CCTs from different organisms. CCTs from eudicots, monocots, and nonvascular plants diverged from their homologs from animal and yeast (Fig. 3A). Because most of the differences in the polypeptides are within the C-terminal domain, a detailed analysis of this portion was carried out. Animal and yeast CCTs are enriched with Ser and threonine residues in this region, whereas plant CCTs have a low abundance of these hydroxyl-containing amino acids (Fig. 3A). In addition, monocots have a much smaller C-terminal region relative to animal CCTs (Fig. 3A). These findings suggest that the evolution of this region is different between plants and mammals and might reflect different regulatory mechanisms. The C-terminal region of rat CCT1 corresponds to a phosphorylation domain containing 16 Ser and three Thr residues; 15 of these have been confirmed to be phosphorylated based on the PhosphoSite Plus database (Fig. 3B) (32Hornbeck P.V. Zhang B. Murray B. Kornhauser J.M. Latham V. Skrzypek E.

In contrast, the AtCCT1 C-terminal module only has three Ser and four Thr residues, with only one Ser residue being detected as a phosphorylation site (Ser-301) based on the PhosPhAt 4.0 database (Fig. 3B) (33Durek P.

A noninvasive marker for hypoxia will help physicians in treatment planning and encourage the efficient use of hypoxia targeted therapies. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether pharmacokinetic dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) perfusion parameters are associated with a specific marker of hypoxia, hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1α) in ovarian cancer (OC). Materials and methods Thirty-eight patients with primary OC were enrolled in this prospective study approved by the local ethical committee. Patients underwent dynamic gadolinium-enhanced 3.0 T MRI as part of their staging investigations. Pharmacokinetic perfusion parameters, including a rate constant for transfer of contrast agent from plasma to extravascular extracellular space (EES) (Ktrans) and a rate constant from EES to plasma (Kep), were measured by drawing two types of regions of interest (ROIs): a large solid lesion (L-ROI) and a solid, most enhancing small area (S-ROI) (NordicICE platform). Tissue samples for immunohistochemical analysis were collected during surgery. Kruskal–Wallis, Mann–Whitney U and Chi-square tests were used in statistical analyses. Receiver Operating Characteristic curve analyzes were done for DCE parameters to discriminate high HIF-1α expression. Results Pharmacokinetic perfusion parameters Ktrans and Kep were inversely associated with HIF-1α expression (Ktrans L-ROI P = 0.021; Ktrans S-ROI P = 0.018 and Kep L-ROI P = 0.032; Kep S-ROI P = 0.033). Ktrans and Kep showed good accuracy in identifying high HIF-1α expression (AUC = 0.832 Ktrans L-ROI; 0.840 Ktrans S-ROI; 0.808 Kep L-ROI and 0.808 Kep L-ROI). Conclusion This preliminary study demonstrated that pharmacokinetic DCE-MRI perfusion parameters are associated with the hypoxia specific marker, HIF-1α in OC. DCE-MRI may be a useful supplementary tool in the characterization of OC tumors in a staging investigation."

In addition, we also evaluated the relation between the repeatability and age. Methods Three consecutive measurements of the inner limiting membrane–retinal pigment epithelium (ILM-RPE), inner limiting membrane–inner plexiform layer (ILM-IPL) from macular horizontal and vertical scans, and inner limiting membrane–retinal nerve fiber layer (ILM-RNFL) from optic disc horizontal scan. 159 subjects were included in the analysis. The within subject standard deviation (Sw) and the repeatability limits (Rlimit) are used to represent the repeatability of the parameters for the different sectors. Results The Sw for the ILM-RPE thickness was less than 3.5 μm for each sector and scan direction. The Sw values varied within the sectors and scan modes, with horizontal scan modes resulting in better values for the horizontal sectors, and vice versa. The Sw for the GCL-IPL thickness was less than 2 μm, and was similar between the vertical and horizontal scan modes for each sector map. For the optic disc scan, the Sw was not symmetric along the clock-hour map sectors, the largest Sw values were seen in the vertical sectors (8.6 μm). The mean difference between the vertical and horizontal scans was less than 2 μm for each retinal thickness sector map. Significant but weak correlation between the Sw and the subject’s age was seen in both macular and optic disc scans. Conclusions The repeatability of the HOCT-1F to measure the ILM-RPE-, ILM-IPL- and ILM-RNFL-thickness is good. The repeatability of the ILM-RPE thickness is dependent on the scan direction, which should be taken into account when calculating retinal thickness. There is a weak correlation between the repeatability and the subject’s age."

To date, little is known about the interacting partners of OsMADS16 except for several MADS-box proteins. In this study, we constructed a high-quality cDNA library of young panicles (< 5 cm in length) and performed yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screening using OsMADS16 as bait. Eleven candidate proteins interacting with OsMADS16 were identified by Y2H and validated by BiFC and Co-IP assays. Subcellular localization results further confirmed the possibility of the interactions of OsMADS16 with 10 of the candidate proteins in natural rice cells. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that these partners exerted various molecular, cellular and physiological functions. Some of them were known or likely to be related to reproductive events, such as stamen primordium initiation, differentiation and development (OsMADS2, OsMADS4 and OsCOP9) and pollen development (OsbHLH40 and Os6PGDH). Our results provide an important reference for further research on OsMADS16-mediated regulation mechanism on floral organ development and pollen formation."
https://openalex.org/W2923393121,"Different guidelines are adopted in clinics and countries to assess pure tone hearing sensitivity in children with otitis media with effusion (OME). Some guidelines specify a broad range of audiometric frequencies that must be tested and from which average thresholds determined, while others leave test frequencies unspecified. For guidelines that suggest specific frequencies there are various pure tone frequencies and frequency ranges given. The present study investigated whether (1) a full range of audiometric frequencies is required to evaluate hearing loss caused by OME in children, or if neighboring frequencies provide essentially the same threshold information, and (2) if different combinations of test frequency pure tone averaging calculations may affect decision criteria for surgical treatment. In a retrospective cohort study, right and left ear air conduction pure tone threshold data were obtained, from 125 Hz to 8 kHz, for 96 children with OME aged 4 to 12 years. Paired t-tests, correlation tests (Pearson’s r, Cronbach’s alpha, intraclass correlation) and absolute differences were used to examine the relationships among pure tone audiometric (PTA) frequencies for all ears with hearing loss. 168 ears were found to have OME-related hearing loss. Only the 125 Hz—250 Hz comparison showed no statistically significant difference between neighboring thresholds. However, only the 4 kHz and 8 kHz comparison showed a clinically significant mean difference of ≥ 10 dB. When viewing individual differences, comparison between 250 Hz and 500 Hz, 125 Hz and 500 Hz, and 4 kHz and 8 kHz, showed a large number of ears with clinically significant differences between test frequencies. Comparisons among low frequency 3 PTA average (500 Hz, 1 kHz, 2 kHz), high frequency 3 PTA average (1 kHz, 2 kHz, 4 kHz), and 4 frequency PTA average (500 Hz, 1 kHz, 2 kHz, 4 kHz) showed no statistically significant differences, with very strong correlations for all comparisons. In addition, for all the combinations of PTA averages, no clinically significant differences were found for the various comparisons or among individual results. Clinically, testing hearing sensitivity in the 125 Hz to 8 kHz range is worthwhile in evaluating hearing sensitivity in children with OME due to large individual variability across audiometric frequencies. However, frequencies tested for criterion averages for surgical treatments of children with OME may be restricted to 3 frequency PTA averages, either an average of 500 Hz, 1 kHz, 2 kHz or an average of 1 kHz, 2 kHz, 4 kHz, as no clinically significant differences were found using these or a 4 frequency averaging technique. For research purposes, 250 Hz can proxy for hearing thresholds at 125 Hz; and the low frequency 3 PTA average, high frequency 3 PTA average and 4 frequency PTA average may be used interchangeably, as no statistically significant differences were found among these measures."

To further elucidate the previously observed overlapping roles of Bap1 and RbmC in biofilm architecture and surface attachment, here we investigated the structural and functional properties of Bap1. Soluble expression of Bap1 was possible only after the removal of an internal 57-amino-acid-long hydrophobic insertion sequence.

The structure also revealed metal-binding sites within canonical calcium blade motifs, which appear to have structural rather than functional roles. Contrary to results previously observed with RbmC, the Bap1 β-prism domain did not exhibit affinity for complex N-glycans, suggesting an altered role of this domain in biofilm-surface adhesion. Native polyacrylamide gel shift analysis did suggest that Bap1 exhibits lectin activity with a preference for anionic or linear polysaccharides.

https://openalex.org/W2969212291,"Leukemia is the most common cancer in children and has the highest rates of incidence in industrialized countries, followed by developing countries. This epidemiologic profile can mainly be attributed to the availability of diagnostic resources. In Brazil, leukemia diagnosis is a challenge due to financial viability, lack of hemovigilance services in isolated regions and the vast size of the territory. Its incidence in the state of Amazonas has been increasing since 2010. Therefore, this study aims to describe the epidemiological pattern and spatial distribution of patients with acute lymphoid leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia in Amazonas and identify the predictors of comorbidity and death.A retrospective cross-sectional study was carried out based on patients' data which was obtained from the database of a referral center for the period of 2005 to 2015. Variables included age, gender, ethnicity, civil status, schooling, income, location of residence, subtype of leukemia, comorbidities, and date of death. The spatial distribution was performed using QGIS v.2.18. Stata software was used for univariable and multivariable logistic regression to evaluate the association between both comorbidities and death for all characteristic groups of ALL and AML.The group that was studied was composed of 577 ALL and 266 AML patients. For both, most patients were male, with a schooling period of 1-4 years, received<1 minimum wage, and lived mostly in Manaus, followed by the municipality of Tefé. There was no association between the development of comorbidities and analyzed variables in patients with ALL. AML patients that were >60 years old and with family history of the disease had the highest risk of developing comorbidities (OR = 5.06, p = 0.038; OR = 2.44, p = 0.041, respectively). Furthermore, patients with ALL and in the 41-50-year age group had a higher risk of death (OR = 31.12; p = 0.001). No association between death and explanatory variables were found in patients with AML. In addition, significant difference was observed in time to death (chi2 = 4,098.32, p = 0.000), with 50% of patients with AML dying within two years after diagnosis, whereas in ALL, this percentual of death only is reached in approximately 5 years.Our study describes the data of patients with acute leukemia in Amazonas, a remote region in the north of Brazil. In addition, it highlights the importance of hemovigilance in an Amazon region state, while focusing on peripheral areas which don't have prevention, diagnosis and treatment tools for this disease."
https://openalex.org/W2969491173,"Background Given the slow uptake of PrEP among cisgender men who have sex with men (MSM) in high-income countries, efforts to roll-out PrEP in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) should address barriers to PrEP use to facilitate its more rapid uptake. To inform PrEP programs in LMIC, we examined patterns of perceived barriers to PrEP use among HIV-negative MSM in Tijuana, Mexico. Methods From 03/2016-09/2017, 364 MSM completed interviewer-administered surveys assessing perceived barriers to PrEP use across 4 domains: PrEP attribute, individual, interpersonal, and structural. Latent class analysis was performed to identify distinct classes with respect to perceived barriers to PrEP use. Multinomial logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with class membership. Results We identified three classes characterized by (1) high levels of perceived barriers across domains (12%), (2) low levels of perceived barriers across domains (43%), and (3) perceived PrEP attribute barriers (i.e., side-effects and cost) (45%). Membership in the high level of perceived barriers class (vs. the low level of perceived barriers class) was positively associated with having a history of incarceration (AOR: 2.44; 95% CI: 1.04, 5.73) and negatively associated with more social support (AOR: 0.99; 95% CI: 0.98, 1.00). Membership in the perceived PrEP attribute barriers class was positively associated with having seen a healthcare provider in the past year (AOR: 2.78; 95% CI: 1.41, 5.45) and negatively associated with having any HIV-positive or status unknown partners (AOR: 0.56; 95% CI: 0.31, 1.01). Conclusions Since most participants were in either the low level of perceived barriers class or the perceived PrEP attribute barriers class, future PrEP uptake may be high among MSM in Tijuana. However, these findings suggest that achieving sufficient PrEP uptake and adherence among MSM in Tijuana may require a range of comprehensive HIV prevention interventions."

Frequently, new or secondary pathogens arise as emergent diseases due to the intensified use of agricultural lands, causing extensive yield losses. Helicotylenchus dihystera (Hd) and Scutellonema brachyurus (Sb) appear as potential pathogens for soybean in Brazil, since their spread and population densities have been increased on soybean growing areas. Aiming to evaluate the quantitative distribution of Hd and Sb in soybean fields in South Brazil, a survey was conducted during the growing seasons of 2014–2015 and 2015–2016 in which 1,088 soil samples and 1,043 root samples were analyzed. Besides, two greenhouse experiments were conducted to evaluate the pathogenicity of both nematodes to soybean plants, in comparison with P. brachyurus (Pb), a known pathogen of the crop. The survey demonstrated that Pb, Hd and Sb are widely distributed in the States of Paraná, Santa Catarina and Mato Grosso do Sul. Besides, we proved that Hd and Sb multiply and cause root lesions in soybean cv. Potência, since they were found inside roots, and can be considered as potential pathogens for soybean plants."

However, the frequent introduction of A. dahurica to new areas has made it difficult to distinguish between varieties. Simple sequence repeats (SSRs) detected based on transcriptome analyses are very useful for constructing genetic maps and analyzing genetic diversity. They are also relevant for the molecular marker-assisted breeding of A. dahurica. We identified 33,724 genic SSR loci based on transcriptome sequencing data. A total of 114 primer pairs were designed for the SSR loci and were tested for their specificity and diversity. Ten SSR loci in untranslated regions were ultimately selected. Subsequently, 56 A. dahurica ecotypes collected from different regions were analyzed. The SSR loci comprised 2-8 alleles, with a mean of 5.2 alleles per locus. The polymorphic information content value and Shannon's information index were 0.6274-0.2702 (average of 0.4091) and 1.3040-0.5618 (average of 0.8475), respectively. Thus, the 10 novel SSRs identified in this study were almost in accordance with Harvey-Weinberg equilibrium and will be useful for analyzing A. dahurica genetic relationships. The results of this study confirm the potential value of transcriptome databases for the development of new SSR markers."
https://openalex.org/W2969955542,"Background The combination of electroporation with electrolysis (E2) has previously been introduced as a novel tissue ablation technique. E2 allows the utilization of a wide parameter range and may therefore be a suitable technology for development of tissue-specific application protocols. Previous studies have implied that it is possible to achieve big lesions in liver in a very short time. The goal of this study was to test a variety of electrode configurations for the E2 application to ablate large tissue volumes. Materials and methods 27 lesions were performed in healthy porcine liver of five female pigs. Four, two and bipolar electrode-arrays were used to deliver various E2 treatment protocols. Liver was harvested approx. 20h after treatment and examined with H&E and Masson’s trichrome staining, and via TUNEL staining for selective specimen. Results All animals survived the treatments without complications. With four electrodes, a lesion of up to 35x35x35mm volume can be achieved in less than 30s. The prototype bipolar electrode created lesions of 50x18x18mm volume in less than 10s. Parameters for two-electrode ablations with large exposures encompassing large veins were found to be good in terms of vessel preservation, but not optimal to reliably close the gap between the electrodes. Conclusion This study demonstrates the ability to produce large lesions in liver within seconds at lower limits of the E2 parameter space at different electrode configurations. The applicability of E2 for single electrode ablations was demonstrated with bipolar electrodes. Parameters for large 4-electrode ablation volumes were found suitable, while parameters for two electrodes still need optimization. However, since the parameter space of E2 is large, it is possible that for all electrode geometries optimal waveforms and application protocols for specific tissues will emerge with continuing research."
https://openalex.org/W2969990096,"Vascular smooth muscle cells from the pulmonary arteries (HPASMC) of subjects with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) exhibit hyperplastic growth. The PAH HPASMC display an increased sensitivity to fetal bovine serum (FBS) and undergo growth at a very low, 0.2%, FBS concentration. On the other hand, normal HPASMC (obtained from non-PAH donors) do not proliferate at low FBS (0.2%). A previous genomic study suggested that the nuclear factor, FOXM1 and the polo like kinase 1 (PLK1) are involved in promoting this hyperplastic growth of the PAH HPASMC. Here we find that limiting the action of FOXM1 or PLK1 not only restricts the hyperplastic proliferation of the PAH HPASMC but also modulates the FBS stimulated growth of normal HPASMC. The PAH HPASMC exhibit significantly elevated PLK1 and FOXM1 expression and decreased p27 (quiescence protein) levels compared to normal HPASMC. Regulation of the expression of FOXM1 and PLK1 is accompanied by the regulation of downstream expression of cell cycle components, Aurora B, cyclin B1 and cyclin D1. Expression of these cell cycle components is reversed by the knockdown of FOXM1 or PLK1 expression/activity. Furthermore, the knockdown of PLK1 expression lowers the protein level of FOXM1. On the other hand, inhibiting the action of FOXO1, a growth inhibitor, further increases the expression of FOXM1 in PAH HPASMC. Although PLK1 and FOXM1 clearly participate in PAH HPASMC hyperplasia, at this time it is not clear whether their increased activity is the primary driver of the hyperplastic behavior of the PAH HPASMC or merely a component of the pathway(s) leading to this response."
https://openalex.org/W2969716617,"Spatial accessibility to health services is a key factor in terms of public health. Even though some tools are available, establishing accessibility criteria applicable from one geographic scale to another remains difficult. Therefore, we propose a method for creating a health accessibility index applicable on a large geographic scale, based on a methodology that overcomes the limitations of political-administrative divisions and which allows a multi-scalar approach to be implemented. The index highlights, on a national scale, areas of cumulative health disadvantages. This index of accessibility to health care combines accessibility and availability and can be adapted to many geographical scales. As accessibility can be understood in various dimensions, a score could be calculated for various fields such as education and culture. The index can help policymakers to identify under-endowed areas and find optimal locations. In terms of public health, it may be used to understand the mechanisms underlying geographic health disparities."
https://openalex.org/W2969969044,"This study explores whether continuity of care is associated with health care outcomes and medical care use among patients with newly diagnosed diabetes. A retrospective cohort analysis was performed using the Taiwanese National Health Insurance database, and cases were followed up from January 2010 to December 2012. Four thousand and seven patients with newly diagnosed diabetes were followed for 3 years. The continuity of care was measured using the continuity of care index (COCI) and the usual provider continuity score (UPCS) with high and low dichotomous categories. The probabilities of dementia, hospitalization, emergency room visits, and death were used as health care outcomes. Medical care use was defined as the number of hospital admissions, length of hospital stays, and number of emergency room visits. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were obtained using multivariate logistic regression; adjusted ORs for the probabilities of dementia, hospital admissions, and emergency room visits in the higher COCI patient group were 0.582 (p < 0.05), 0.623 (p < 0.001), and 0.650 (p < 0.001), respectively. Negative binomial regression models for medical resource use indicated that the group with higher COCI scores used fewer medical resources compared with the group with lower COCI scores. The findings of UPCS analysis showed that those in the high COCI group also fell into the high UPCS group. In this study, continuity of care was associated with favorable health care outcomes and less medical care uses among newly diagnosed diabetic patients. Long-term relationships between patients and health care providers should be enhanced to provide improved continuity of care."
https://openalex.org/W2969764716,"Intelligent Transport System (ITS) uses the IEEE 802.11P standard for the wireless communication among vehicles. A wireless ad hoc network of vehicles is established to improve road safety, comfort, security, and traffic efficiency. Wireless communication in ITS leads to many security and privacy challenges. Security and privacy of ITS are important issues that demand incorporation of confidentiality, privacy, authentication, integrity, non-repudiation, and restrictive obscurity. In order to ensure the privacy of vehicles during communication, it is required that the real identity of vehicles should not be revealed. There must be robust and efficient security and privacy mechanisms for the establishment of a reliable and trustworthy network. Therefore, we propose Advanced Strong Pseudonym based Authentication (ASPA), which is a distributed framework to handle the security and privacy issues of vehicle communications in ITS. ASPA only allows vehicles with valid pseudonyms to communicate in ITS. Pseudonyms are assigned to vehicles in a secure manner. The pseudonym mappings of vehicles are stored at different locations to avoid any chance of vehicle pseudonyms certificates linkability. In addition, the most recent communication pseudonyms of a malicious vehicle are revoked and are stored in the Certificate Revocation List (CRL) that results in small size of the CRL. Therefore, the CRL size does not increase exponentially. The distributed framework of ASPA guarantees, the vehicles privacy preservation in the real identities mapping and revocation phase. The empirical results prove that ASPA is robust and efficient with low computational cost, overhead ratio, average latency, and an increased delivery ratio."
https://openalex.org/W2969923799,"Expressed strongly by myeloid cells, damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) proteins S100A8 and S100A9 are found in the serum of patients with infectious and autoimmune diseases. Compared to S100A9, the role of S100A8 is controversial. We investigated its biological activity in collagen-induced arthritis using the first known viable and fertile S100a8-deficient (S100a8-/-) mouse. Although comparable to the wild type (WT) in terms of lymphocyte distribution in blood and in the primary and secondary lymphoid organs, S100a8-/- mice had increased numbers of neutrophils, monocytes and dendritic cells in the blood and bone marrow, and these all expressed myeloid markers such as CD11b, Ly6G and CD86 more strongly. Granulocyte-macrophage common precursors were increased in S100a8-/- bone marrow and yielded greater numbers of macrophages and dendritic cells in culture. The animals also developed more severe arthritic disease leading to aggravated osteoclast activity and bone destruction. These findings were correlated with increased inflammatory cell infiltration and cytokine secretion in the paws. This study suggests that S100A8 is an anti-inflammatory DAMP that regulates myeloid cell differentiation, thereby mitigating the development of experimental arthritis."

Our data indicate that negatively charged polyphosphates bind to protein molecules with a net positive charge. The polyphosphate-bound, structurally destabilized protein molecules then start assembling into insoluble amorphous aggregates once they pass the solubility limit. We further show that the polyphosphates decrease the solubility limit of the protein and near this limit, the protein molecules are in a labile state and highly prone to converting into amyloid fibrils.

Interestingly, recent studies have revealed that polyphosphates promote amyloid fibril formation of several amyloidogenic proteins (30Cremers C.M. Knoefler D. Gates S. Martin N. Dahl J.U. Lempart J.

However, little is known about the mechanisms by which polyphosphates promote or inhibit amyloid fibril formation. We examined the binding of polyphosphates to HEWL molecules, the resultant structural changes of the protein, and subsequent protein aggregation using turbidimetry, fluorescence, and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (EM), and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). Our results offer a model in which protein aggregation is modulated by binding of polyphosphate molecules. To assess the ability of negatively charged phosphate groups in a linear chain linked by phosphoanhydride bonds to promote aggregation of positively charged HEWL, we first tested three different sodium phosphates in acidic solution containing 10 mm HCl (pH 2): pyrophosphate (Pyro-P), tripolyphosphate (Tri-P), and tetrapolyphosphate (Tetra-P). Turbidity assays were used to detect protein aggregation in each solution. The concentration of HEWL was 1.0 mg/ml (70 μm), and concentrations of the phosphates varied from 0 to 1.0 mm, where molarity of the polyphosphate species was used as the phosphate concentration. After mixing the respective solutions (that is, HEWL, HCl, and phosphates) and incubating for 1 h at room temperature, turbidity of the solutions was recorded as the apparent absorbance at 600 nm. No significant increases in the turbidity were observed when Pyro-P and Tri-P were used at any of the concentrations tested (Fig. S1). However, as seen in Fig. 1A, the turbidity of the solutions increased greatly in the presence of Tetra-P. The same measurements were conducted for protein concentration of 0.2 mg/ml, and the turbidity similarly increased until reaching a plateau (Fig. 1B). In Fig. 1, A and B, the turbidity data are plotted against the logarithmic concentration of Tetra-P, showing the solution turbidity increasing at a certain Tetra-P concentration (∼0.1 mm). These data suggest that under the conditions used, two or three phosphate groups are insufficient to cause protein aggregation, and the aggregation-inducing capacity of Tetra-P arises from its longer polymeric nature. Similar experiments were conducted to examine the effects of NaCl on protein aggregation induced by Tetra-P. Here, the electrostatic shielding effect of NaCl was expected to suppress Tetra-P–induced protein aggregation. 2.0 m NaCl was added at various ratios into several turbid HEWL–Tetra-P solutions. In these preparations, concentrations of the protein and Tetra-P were maintained at a constant level after the addition of NaCl; the final concentrations were 1.0 and 0.2 mg/ml of HEWL, and 1.0, 0.5, and 0.2 mm Tetra-P. The turbidity measurements were similarly conducted after 1 h of incubation at room temperature (see Fig. 1, C and D, for the protein solutions at 1.0 (C) and 0.2 mg/ml (D), which contained 1.0 mm Tetra-P). For all the protein–Tetra-P solutions studied, the turbidity decreased with increases in NaCl concentration, resulting in transparent solutions (i.e. zero turbidity) at concentrations of more than 0.3–0.4 m NaCl (Fig. 1, C and D, and Fig. S2, A, C, and E). These results suggest that in Tetra-P–induced aggregation of HEWL, electrostatic interactions are predominantly involved. We examined the amyloidogenic propensity of these solutions at various NaCl concentrations by adding an amyloid-sensitive dye, thioflavin T (ThT), at 5 μm into several HEWL–Tetra-P–NaCl solutions in which the concentrations of the protein and Tetra-P were maintained at constant levels. The concentrations of NaCl in these solutions are indicated by arrows (Fig. 1, C and D, and Fig. S2, A, C, and E). These 10-set sample solutions at different NaCl concentrations were subjected to repeated ultrasonic irradiation and changes in ThT fluorescence were measured during the intermittent sonication (Fig. S3). Interestingly, upon ultrasonic irradiation, the solutions containing 0.3–0.4 m NaCl exhibited a marked increase in ThT fluorescence after a lag time of ∼4–8 h (Fig. 1, E and F, Fig. S2, B, D, and F, and Fig. S4, A–E for the time-dependent data of all the samples). For the solutions at concentrations lower and higher than 0.3–0.4 m NaCl, the increase in ThT fluorescence was largely suppressed. These results indicate that ultrasonication triggered amyloid aggregation of the protein molecules in the vicinity of their solubility limit. CD spectra of these solutions were recorded after the ThT fluorescence measurements were taken (Fig. 1G). The CD data clearly indicated the formation of β-sheet structures, characterized by a peak around 220 nm, for the solutions that showed high ThT fluorescence (Fig. 1F). EM images obtained for these samples confirmed the formation of fibrillar aggregates (Fig. 1, H and I). We then investigated the effects of longer polyphosphates, with 10–15 phosphate groups (S-PolyP) and with 60–70 phosphate groups (L-PolyP), on protein aggregation. The same turbidity measurements as shown in Fig. 1, B and D, were conducted. The turbidity of the solutions containing S-PolyP or L-PolyP increased at lower concentrations of the polyphosphates as the chain lengths became longer (Fig. 2, A and B). Addition of NaCl to the turbid solutions containing S-PolyP and L-PolyP resulted in decreased turbidity as NaCl concentration increased (Fig. 2, C and D). The turbidity reached 0 at NaCl concentrations around 0.6–0.8 m, which were larger values than those (i.e. 0.3–0.4 m) detected for Tetra-P. These results suggest that electrostatic attraction between polyphos"

Youth are at disproportionate risk of drug use and STIs/HIV, yet interventions aimed at improving STI and HIV testing and reducing STI/HIV risk behaviors through technology-based engagement in clinic settings are limited. The purpose of this study was to examine the feasibility and acceptability of Storytelling 4 Empowerment (S4E), a multilevel mobile-health drug abuse and STI/HIV preventive application (app) for clinic settings. We also explored uptake of STI/HIV testing among youth immediately post-intervention.Employing community-based participatory research principles and a multi-method research design, we developed a clinician-facing app, and examined the feasibility and acceptability of S4E among clinicians (n = 6) and youth (n = 20) in an urban youth-centered community health clinic. S4E aimed to improve clinician-youth risk communication and youths' drug use and STI/HIV knowledge, self-efficacy, and refusal skills. We also explored youths' uptake of STI and HIV testing. Quantitative data were analyzed by computing mean scores and proportions, and qualitative analyses followed the tenets of content analysis.Among eligible participants, 86.9% of youth and 85.7% of clinicians enrolled in the study, suggesting the feasibility of recruiting participants from the targeted clinic. Most clinicians identified as non-Hispanic white (83%) and female (66.7%). Among the youth, 70% identified as non-Hispanic white, followed by 30% African American, and 50% identified as female with a mean age of 19.6 (SD = 1.5, Range = 16-21). The quantitative findings suggest that the acceptability of S4E is high, as indicated by the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (mean score = 25.2, SD: 4.8). Immediately post-intervention, all youth who reported past 90-day condomless sex or having never been tested for STIs or HIV in their lifetime, were tested for both STIs and HIV. Qualitative themes revealed four overarching themes, including S4E: (1) faciliated timely, targeted, and tailored prevention and risk reduction strategies; (2) shaped clinician and youth communication and interaction during the clinic visit; (3) may have improved uptake of STI/HIV testing and increased STI/HIV knowledge and self-efficacy; and (4) had high feasibiliy and acceptability among youth and clninicans.Findings suggest the feasibility and acceptability of S4E in an urban community-based health clinic setting. A next important step is to examine the efficacy of S4E in a randomized controlled trial design."

Likert based surveys were used to obtain data face to face and via online social media.

https://openalex.org/W2969691046,"The transport of macromolecules into the cell nucleus occurs through nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) and is mediated by cellular receptors. Recently, a novel mechanism of nuclear entry, in which actin polymerization provides a propulsive force driving the transport through the NPC, has been proposed. This mechanism is used by the nucleocapsid from baculovirus, one of the largest viruses to replicate in the nucleus of their host cells, which crosses the NPC and enters the nucleus independently of cellular receptors. The baculovirus nucleocapsid contains a protein that hijacks the cellular actin polymerization machinery to assemble actin filaments that propel the nucleocapsid through the host cell cytoplasm. In this study, we functionalized carbon nanotubes by covalently attaching a protein domain responsible for inducing actin polymerization and investigated their nuclear entry. We found that the functionalized carbon nanotubes were able to enter the cell nucleus under permissive conditions for actin polymerization, but not when this process was inhibited. We conclude that the mechanical force generated by actin polymerization can drive cargo entry into the cell nucleus. Our results support a novel force-driven mechanism for molecular entry into the cell nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W2969928892,"The lentiviral Rev protein, which is a regulatory protein essential for virus replication, has been first studied in the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). The main function of Rev is to mediate the nuclear exportation of viral RNAs. To fulfill its function, Rev shuttles between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. The Jembrana disease virus (JDV), a lentivirus, is the etiologic agent of the Jembrana disease which was first described in Bali cattle in Indonesia in 1964. Despite the high mortality rate associated with JDV, this virus remains poorly studied. Herein the subcellular distribution of JDV Rev, the nuclear and nucleolar localization signals (NLS and NoLS, respectively) and the nuclear export signal (NES) of the protein were examined. JDV Rev fused to the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) predominantly localized to the cytoplasm and nucleolus of transfected cells, as determined by fluorescence microscopy analyses. Through transfection of a series of deletion mutants of JDV Rev, it was possible to localize the NLS/NoLS region between amino acids (aa) 74 to 105. By substituting basic residues with alanine within this sequence, we demonstrated that the JDV Rev NLS encompasses aa 76 to 86, and is exclusively composed of arginine residues, whereas a bipartite NoLS was observed for the first time in any retroviral Rev/Rev-like proteins. Finally, a NES was identified downstream of the NLS/NoLS and encompasses aa 116 to 128 of the JDV Rev protein. The JDV Rev NES was found to be of the protein kinase A inhibitor (PKI) class instead of the HIV-1 Rev class. It also corresponds to the most optimal consensus sequence of PKI NES and, as such, is novel among lentiviral Rev NES."

We used a case-control method to identify the clinical characteristics and laboratory findings associated with CNS involvement in patients who underwent a diagnostic lumbar puncture. In the sensitivity analysis, we included additional control patients who did not undergo lumbar puncture, but were followed beyond 12 months without the development of CNS involvement in the absence of exposure to any fungicidal agents.We entered 270 NHNT adult patients into the study during the 15-year period. CNS involvement was confirmed in 66 (71.0%) of 93 patients who underwent lumbar puncture. A multivariable analysis revealed that presence of neurological manifestations and elevated serum CRAG titers were independently associated with a 23.97-fold (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.37-182.23) and 1.53-fold (per 2-fold increment, 95% CI 1.26-1.92) increased odds ratio for CNS involvement, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W2969734765,"It is generally accepted that ORF1629 is essential for baculovirus replication, which has enabled isolation of recombinant viruses in a baculovirus expression system using linearized viral DNA. ORF1629-defective viruses cannot replicate in insect cells; only recombinant virus with complete ORF1629 restoration by recombination can propagate, allowing for pure isolation and the development of bacmids for easy selection of recombinant viruses. We inadvertently found proliferation in insect cells of a bacmid lacking a complete ORF1629. PCR indicated no other viruses but a lack of complete ORF1629 in the proliferated bacmid, suggesting that the baculovirus propagated without a complete ORF1629. Lack of ORF1629 decreased the virus growth rate and yield; it also increased the occlusion body (OB) size but decreased its yield. These results were confirmed for Autographa californica multicapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) and Bombyx mori NPV (BmNPV). Thus, entire ORF1629 is not essential for viral replication, though it does affect the virus growth rate, yield, and size and OB production."

Genome sequences of this kind are a challenge to existing methods for construction of phylogenetic trees. We address the issues by developing a hierarchical approach to phylogeny construction. In this method, the construction is performed at multiple levels, where at each level, groups of isolates with similar levels of similarity are identified and their phylogenetic trees are constructed. Time savings are achieved by using a sufficiently large number of columns from the input alignment, instead of all its columns. Our results show that the new approach is 20-60 times more efficient than existing programs and more accurate in situations where highly similar isolates have a wide range of SNP rates."

https://openalex.org/W2969678656,"Gene set analysis (GSA) has become the common methodology for analyzing transcriptomics data. However, self-contained GSA techniques are rarely, if ever, used for proteomics data analysis. Here we present a self-contained proteome level GSA of four consensus molecular subtypes (CMSs) previously established by transcriptome dissection of colon carcinoma specimens. Despite notable difference in structure of proteomics and transcriptomics data, many pathway-wide characteristic features of CMSs found at the mRNA level were reproduced at the protein level. In particular, CMS1 features show heavy involvement of immune system as well as the pathways related to mismatch repair, DNA replication and functioning of proteasome, while CMS4 tumors upregulate complement pathway and proteins participating in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). In addition, protein level GSA yielded a set of novel observations visible at the proteome, but not at the transcriptome level, including possible involvement of major histocompatibility complex II (MHC-II) antigens in the known immunogenicity of CMS1 and a connection between cholesterol trafficking and the regulation of Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) in CMS3. Overall, this study proves utility of self-contained GSA approaches as a critical tool for analyzing proteomics data in general and dissecting protein-level molecular portraits of human tumors in particular."
