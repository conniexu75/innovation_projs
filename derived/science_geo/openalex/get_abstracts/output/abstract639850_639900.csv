https://openalex.org/W2974598703,"Australian fire weather shows spatiotemporal variability on interannual and multi-decadal time scales. We investigate the climate factors that drive this variability using 39 station-based historical time series of the seasonal 90th-percentile of the McArthur Forest Fire Danger Index (FFDI) extending from 1973 through 2017. Using correlation analyses, we examine the relationship of these time series to the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), considering both concurrent and time-lagged relationships. Additionally, longer term behaviour of the time series using linear trend analysis is discussed in the context of the climate drivers, Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) and anthropogenic climate change. The results show that ENSO is the main driver for interannual variability of fire weather, as defined by FFDI in this study, for most of Australia. In general, El Niño-like conditions lead to more extreme fire weather, with this effect stronger in eastern Australia. However, there are significant regional variations to this general rule. In NSW, particularly along the central coast, negative SAM is a primary influence for elevated fire weather in late-winter and spring. In the southeast (VIC and TAS), the El Niño-like impact is exacerbated when positive IOD conditions are simultaneously observed. The spring conditions are key, and strongly influence what is observed during the following summer. On longer time scales (45 years), linear trends are upward at most stations; this trend is strongest in the southeast and during the spring. The positive trends are not driven by the trends in the climate drivers and they are not consistent with hypothesized impacts of the IPO, either before or after its late-1990s shift to the cold phase. We propose that anthropogenic climate change is the primary driver of the trend, through both higher mean temperatures and potentially through associated shifts in large-scale rainfall patterns. Variations from interannual factors are generally larger in magnitude than the trend effects observed to date."
https://openalex.org/W2974710849,"Radiomics studies require many patients in order to power them, thus patients are often combined from different institutions and using different imaging protocols. Various studies have shown that imaging protocols affect radiomics feature values. We examined whether using data from cohorts with controlled imaging protocols improved patient outcome models. We retrospectively reviewed 726 CT and 686 PET images from head and neck cancer patients, who were divided into training or independent testing cohorts. For each patient, radiomics features with different preprocessing were calculated and two clinical variables—HPV status and tumor volume—were also included. A Cox proportional hazards model was built on the training data by using bootstrapped Lasso regression to predict overall survival. The effect of controlled imaging protocols on model performance was evaluated by subsetting the original training and independent testing cohorts to include only patients whose images were obtained using the same imaging protocol and vendor. Tumor volume, HPV status, and two radiomics covariates were selected for the CT model, resulting in an AUC of 0.72. However, volume alone produced a higher AUC, whereas adding radiomics features reduced the AUC. HPV status and one radiomics feature were selected as covariates for the PET model, resulting in an AUC of 0.59, but neither covariate was significantly associated with survival. Limiting the training and independent testing to patients with the same imaging protocol reduced the AUC for CT patients to 0.55, and no covariates were selected for PET patients. Radiomics features were not consistently associated with survival in CT or PET images of head and neck patients, even within patients with the same imaging protocol."
https://openalex.org/W2973676644,"Objective To determine recent trends in maternal prepregnancy body mass index (BMI) and to quantify its association with birth and maternal outcomes. Methods A population-based retrospective cohort study included resident women with singleton births in the California Birth Statistical Master Files (BSMF) database from 2007 to 2016. There were 4,621,082 women included out of 5,054,968 women registered in the database. 433,886 (8.6%) women were excluded due to invalid or missing information for BMI. Exposures were underweight (BMI < 18.5 kg/m2), normal weight (18.5–24.9 kg/m2), overweight (25.0–29.9 kg/m2), and obese (≥ 30 kg/m2) at the onset of pregnancy. Obesity was subcategorized into class I (30.0–34.9 kg/m2), class II (35.0–39.9 kg/m2), and class III (≥ 40 kg/m2), while adverse outcomes examined were low birth weight (LBW), very low birth weight (VLBW), macrosomic births, preterm birth (PTB), very preterm birth (VPTB), small-for-gestational-age birth (SGA), large-for-gestational-age birth (LGA), and cesarean delivery (CD). Descriptive analysis, simple linear regression, and multivariate logistic regression were performed, and adjusted odds ratios (AORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for associations were estimated. Results Over the ten-year study period, the prevalence of underweight and normal weight women at time of birth declined by 10.6% and 9.7%, respectively, while the prevalence of overweight and obese increased by 4.3% and 22.9%, respectively. VLBW increased significantly with increasing BMI, by 24% in overweight women and by 76% in women with class III obesity from 2007 to 2016. Women with class III obesity also had a significant increase in macrosomic birth (170%) and were more likely to deliver PTB (33%), VPTB (66%), LGA (231%), and CD (208%) than women with a normal BMI. However, obese women were less likely to have SGA infants; underweight women were 51% more likely to have SGA infants than women with a normal BMI. Conclusions In California from 2007 to 2016, there was a declining trend in women with prepregnancy normal weight, and a rising trend in overweight and obese women, particularly obesity class III. Both extremes of prepregnancy BMI were associated with an increased incidence of adverse neonatal outcomes; however, the worse outcomes were prominent in those women classified as obese."
https://openalex.org/W2973612164,"Tenocytes serve to synthesize and maintain collagen fibrils and other extracellular matrix proteins in tendon. Despite the high prevalence of tendon injury, the underlying biologic mechanisms of postnatal tendon growth and repair are not well understood. IGF1 plays an important role in the growth and remodeling of numerous tissues but less is known about IGF1 in tendon. We hypothesized that IGF1 signaling is required for proper tendon growth in response to mechanical loading through regulation of collagen synthesis and cell proliferation. To test this hypothesis, we conditionally deleted the IGF1 receptor (IGF1R) in scleraxis (Scx)-expressing tenocytes using a tamoxifen-inducible Cre-recombinase system and caused tendon growth in adult mice via mechanical overload of the plantaris tendon. Compared with control Scx-expressing IGF1R-positive (Scx:IGF1R+) mice, in which IGF1R is present in tenocytes, mice that lacked IGF1R in their tenocytes [Scx-expressing IGF1R-negative (Scx:IGF1RΔ) mice] demonstrated reduced cell proliferation and smaller tendons in response to mechanical loading. Additionally, we identified that both the PI3K/protein kinase B and ERK pathways are activated downstream of IGF1 and interact in a coordinated manner to regulate cell proliferation and protein synthesis. These studies indicate that IGF1 signaling is required for proper postnatal tendon growth and support the potential use of IGF1 in the treatment of tendon disorders.-Disser, N. P., Sugg, K. B., Talarek, J. R., Sarver, D. C., Rourke, B. J., Mendias, C. L. Insulin-like growth factor 1 signaling in tenocytes is required for adult tendon growth."
https://openalex.org/W2974011413,"Hippocampal interactions with the motor system are often assumed to reflect the role of memory in motor learning. Here, we examine hippocampal connectivity with sensorimotor cortex during two tasks requiring paced movements, one with a mnemonic component (sequence learning) and one without (repetitive tapping). Functional magnetic resonance imaging activity was recorded from thirteen right-handed subjects; connectivity was identified from sensorimotor cortex correlations with psychophysiological interactions in hippocampal activity between motor and passive visual tasks. Finger movements in both motor tasks anticipated the timing of the metronome, reflecting cognitive control, yet evidence of motor learning was limited to the sequence learning task; nonetheless, hippocampal connectivity was observed during both tasks. Connectivity from corresponding regions in the left and right hippocampus overlapped extensively, with improved sensitivity resulting from their conjunctive (global) analysis. Positive and negative connectivity were both evident, with positive connectivity in sensorimotor cortex ipsilateral to the moving hand during unilateral movements, whereas negative connectivity was prominent in whichever hemisphere was most active during movements. Results implicate the hippocampus in volitional finger movements even in the absence of motor learning or recall."
https://openalex.org/W2974738927,"Background Quantification of abdominal muscle mass by cross-sectional imaging has been increasingly used to diagnose sarcopenia; however, the technical method for quantification has not been standardized yet. We aimed to determine an optimal method to measure the abdominal muscle area. Methods Among 50 consecutive subjects who underwent abdominal CT and MRI for possible liver donation, total abdominal muscle area (TAMA) and total psoas muscle area (TPA) at the L3 inferior endplate level were measured by two blinded readers. Inter-scan agreement between CT and MRI and inter-reader agreement between the two readers were evaluated using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and within-subject coefficient of variation (WSCV). To evaluate the effect of measurement level, one reader measured TAMA and TPA at six levels from the L2 to L4 vertebral bodies. Results TAMA was a more reliable biomarker than TPA in terms of inter-scan agreement (ICC: 0.928 vs. 0.788 for reader 1 and 0.853 vs. 0.821 for reader 2, respectively; WSCV: 8.3% vs. 23.4% for reader 1 and 10.4% vs. 22.3% for reader 2, respectively) and inter-reader agreement (ICC: 0.986 vs. 0.886 for CT and 0.865 vs. 0.669 for MRI, respectively; WSCV: 8.2% vs. 16.0% for CT and 11.6% vs. 29.7% for MRI, respectively). In terms of the measurement level, TAMA did not differ from the L2inf to L4inf levels, whereas TPA increased with a decrease in measurement level. Conclusions TAMA is a better biomarker than TPA in terms of inter-scan and inter-reader agreement and robustness to the measurement level. CT was a more reliable imaging modality than MRI. Our results support the use of TAMA measured by CT as a standard biomarker for abdominal muscle area measurement."
https://openalex.org/W2972229919,"Research in the field of work and organizational psychology more and more highlights the importance of employees' experience of meaningful work. Adding to this area of research, the present study among teachers examined the relationship between meaningful work and resilience and tested whether this proposed relationship is mediated by teachers' work engagement and job crafting behaviour. Data for this study was collected among a group of Dutch teachers working in a school for primary education (N = 174). To test the hypothesized relationships, we conducted a bootstrapping analysis. The outcomes revealed that work engagement and job crafting fully mediated the relationship between meaningful work and teacher's resilience. The insights provided in this study may be useful for the deliberate cultivation of teachers' resilience and may help them to stay enthusiastic in their meaningful but demanding profession. Theoretical contributions, limitations, suggestions for future research and practical implications are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2974408823,"The bovine dry period is a non-lactating period between consecutive lactations characterized by mammary gland involution and redevelopment phases to replace senescent mammary epithelial cells with active cells primed for the next lactation. Dairy cows exposed to heat stress during the dry period experience milk yield reductions between 3–7.5 kg/d in the next lactation, partially attributed to processes associated with mammary cell growth and turnover during the dry period. However, the carry-over impact of dry period heat stress on mammary morphology during lactation has yet to be determined. In the current study, we hypothesized that exposure to heat stress during the dry period would alter alveolar microstructure and cellular turnover (i.e. proliferation and apoptosis) during lactation. Cows were either subjected to heat stress (HT, access to shade; n = 12) or cooling (CL, access to shade, fans, and soakers; n = 12) for a 46 d dry period. Upon calving, all cows were treated similarly with access to cooling for their entire lactation. Six cows per treatment were randomly selected for mammary gland biopsies at 14, 42, and 84 days in milk. Tissues were sectioned and stained for histological analysis. During lactation, HT cows produced 4 kg less colostrum and 3.7 kg less milk compared with CL cows. Lactating mammary gland microstructure was impacted after exposure to dry period heat stress; HT cows had fewer alveoli and a higher proportion of connective tissue in the mammary gland relative to CL cows, however alveolar area was similar between treatments. Rates of mammary epithelial cell proliferation and apoptosis were similar between treatment groups. This suggests that heat stress exposure during the dry period leads to reductions in milk yield that could be caused, in part, by a reduction in alveoli number in the lactating mammary gland but not to dynamic alterations in cellular turnover once lactation is established."
https://openalex.org/W2973246394,"Members of the plant Heme Activator Protein (HAP) or NUCLEAR FACTOR Y (NF-Y) are trimeric transcription factor complexes composed of the NF-YA, NF-YB and NF-YC subfamilies. They bind to the CCAAT box in the promoter regions of the target genes and regulate gene expressions. Plant NF-Ys were reported to be involved in adaptation to several abiotic stresses as well as in development. In silico analysis of Sorghum bicolor genome resulted in the identification of a total of 42 NF-Y genes, among which 8 code for the SbNF-YA, 19 for SbNF-YB and 15 for the SbNF-YC subunits. Analysis was also performed to characterize gene structures, chromosomal distribution, duplication status, protein subcellular localizations, conserved motifs, ancestral protein sequences, miRNAs and phylogenetic tree construction. Phylogenetic relationships and ortholog predictions displayed that sorghum has additional NF-YB genes with unknown functions in comparison with Arabidopsis. Analysis of promoters revealed that they harbour many stress-related cis-elements like ABRE and HSE, but surprisingly, DRE and MYB elements were not detected in any of the subfamilies. SbNF-YA1, 2, and 6 were found upregulated under 200 mM salt and 200 mM mannitol stresses. While NF-YA7 appeared associated with high temperature (40°C) stress, NF-YA8 was triggered by both cold (4°C) and high temperature stresses. Among NF-YB genes, 7, 12, 15, and 16 were induced under multiple stress conditions such as salt, mannitol, ABA, cold and high temperatures. Likewise, NF-YC 6, 11, 12, 14, and 15 were enhanced significantly in a tissue specific manner under multiple abiotic stress conditions. Majority of the mannitol (drought)-inducible genes were also induced by salt, high temperature stresses and ABA. Few of the high temperature stress-induced genes are also induced by cold stress (NF-YA2, 4, 6, 8, NF-YB2, 7, 10, 11, 12, 14, 16, 17, NF-YC4, 6, 12, and 13) thus suggesting a cross talk among them. This work paves the way for investigating the roles of diverse sorghum NF-Y proteins during abiotic stress responses and provides an insight into the evolution of diverse NF-Y members."

https://openalex.org/W2885506102,"The path signature is a means of feature generation that can encode nonlinear interactions in data in addition to the usual linear terms. It provides interpretable features and its output is a fixed length vector irrespective of the number of input points or their sample times. In this paper we use the path signature to provide features for identifying people whose diagnosis subsequently converts to Alzheimer’s disease. In two separate classification tasks we distinguish converters from 1) healthy individuals, and 2) individuals with mild cognitive impairment. The data used are time-ordered measurements of the whole brain, ventricles and hippocampus from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We find two nonlinear interactions which are predictive in both cases. The first interaction is change of hippocampal volume with time, and the second is a change of hippocampal volume relative to the volume of the whole brain. While hippocampal and brain volume changes are well known in Alzheimer’s disease, we demonstrate the power of the path signature in their identification and analysis without manual feature selection. Sequential data is becoming increasingly available as monitoring technology is applied, and the path signature method is shown to be a useful tool in the processing of this data."
https://openalex.org/W2974753668,"In breast cancer, tumor hypoxia has been linked to poor prognosis and increased metastasis. Hypoxia activates transcriptional programs in cancer cells that lead to increased motility and invasion, as well as various metabolic changes. One of these metabolic changes, an increase in glycogen metabolism, has been further associated with protection from reactive oxygen species damage that may lead to premature senescence. Here we report that breast cancer cells significantly increase glycogen stores in response to hypoxia. We found that knockdown of the brain isoform of an enzyme that catalyzes glycogen breakdown, glycogen phosphorylase B (PYGB), but not the liver isoform, PYGL, inhibited glycogen utilization in estrogen receptor negative and positive breast cancer cells; whereas both independently inhibited glycogen utilization in the normal-like breast epithelial cell line MCF-10A. Functionally, PYGB knockdown and the resulting inhibition of glycogen utilization resulted in significantly decreased wound-healing capability in MCF-7 cells and a decrease in invasive potential of MDA-MB-231 cells. Thus, we identify PYGB as a novel metabolic target with potential applications in the management and/or prevention of metastasis in breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2973894636,"The deep-sea chemosynthetic environment is one of the most extreme environments on the Earth, with low oxygen, high hydrostatic pressure and high levels of toxic substances. Species of the family Vesicomyidae are among the dominant chemosymbiotic bivalves found in this harsh habitat. Mitochondria play a vital role in oxygen usage and energy metabolism; thus, they may be under selection during the adaptive evolution of deep-sea vesicomyids. In this study, the mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) of the vesicomyid bivalve Calyptogena marissinica was sequenced with Illumina sequencing. The mitogenome of C. marissinica is 17,374 bp in length and contains 13 protein-coding genes, 2 ribosomal RNA genes (rrnS and rrnL) and 22 transfer RNA genes. All of these genes are encoded on the heavy strand. Some special elements, such as tandem repeat sequences, ""G(A)nT"" motifs and AT-rich sequences, were observed in the control region of the C. marissinica mitogenome, which is involved in the regulation of replication and transcription of the mitogenome and may be helpful in adjusting the mitochondrial energy metabolism of organisms to adapt to the deep-sea chemosynthetic environment. The gene arrangement of protein-coding genes was identical to that of other sequenced vesicomyids. Phylogenetic analyses clustered C. marissinica with previously reported vesicomyid bivalves with high support values. Positive selection analysis revealed evidence of adaptive change in the mitogenome of Vesicomyidae. Ten potentially important adaptive residues were identified, which were located in cox1, cox3, cob, nad2, nad4 and nad5. Overall, this study sheds light on the mitogenomic adaptation of vesicomyid bivalves that inhabit the deep-sea chemosynthetic environment."
https://openalex.org/W2974361142,"The identification and separation of cells from heterogeneous populations is critical to the diagnosis of diseases. Label-free methodologies in particular have been developed to manipulate individual cells using properties such as density and morphology. The electrical properties of malignant cells, including the membrane capacitance and cytoplasmic conductivity, have been demonstrated to be altered compared to non-malignant cells of similar origin. Here, we exploit these changes to characterize individual cells in a sequentially-staged in vitro cancer model using electrorotation (EROT)—the rotation of a cell induced by a rotating electric field. Using a microfabricated device, a dielectrophoretic force to suspend cells while measuring their angular velocity resulting from an EROT force applied at frequencies between 3 kHz to 10 MHz. We experimentally determine the EROT response for cells at three stages of malignancy and analyze the resultant spectra by considering models that include the effect of the cell membrane alone (single-shell model) and the combined effect of the cell membrane and nucleus (double-shell model). We find that the cell membrane is largely responsible for a given cell’s EROT response between 3 kHz and 10 MHz. Our results also indicate that membrane capacitance, membrane conductance, and cytoplasmic conductivity increase with an increasingly malignant phenotype. Our results demonstrate the potential of using electrorotation as a means making of non-invasive measurements to characterize the dielectric properties of cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2973284479,"The bioaccumulation of Potentially Toxic Elements (PTEs) by benthic invertebrates in estuarine sediments is poorly understood. We sampled and analysed PTEs in sediments and benthic invertebrates from five sites in the Skeena Estuary (British Columbia, Canada), including sites adjacent to an abandoned cannery and a decommissioned papermill. Our aim was to elucidate baseline levels of PTE concentrations at sites that may be recovering from disturbance associated with prior industrial development and identify organisms that could be used to biomonitor the impact of future industrial developments. There was no indication that sediments of the salmon cannery were polluted, but acidic sediments adjacent to the papermill contained elevated concentrations of Cd, Cr, Hg and Pb. Benthic invertebrate community assemblages confirm that sediments have mostly recovered from prior industrial development associated with discharge of papermill sludge. Overall, we did not observe any relationship between PTE concentrations in the sediment and PTE concentrations in invertebrate tissues. However, we did observe a negative relationship between sediment pH and the Biota-Sediment Accumulation Factor (BSAF) of most PTEs for Oregon pill bugs (Gnorimosphaeroma oregonensis). G. oregonensis, observed at all sites, feeds on the fibers associated with the papermill discharge. Thus, G. oregonensis is a useful biomonitors for quantifying the impact of the decommissioned papermill, and are candidate biomonitors for assessing the impact of similar industrial development projects on intertidal ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W2974230717,"In treating patients with castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), enzalutamide, the second-generation androgen receptor (AR) antagonist, is an accepted standard of care. However, clinical benefits are limited to a median time of 4.8 months because resistance inevitably emerges. To determine the mechanism of treatment resistance, we carried out a RNA sequence analysis and found increased expression levels of neuroendocrine markers in the enzalutamide-resistant LNCaP human prostate cancer (CaP) cell line when compared to the parental cell line. Subsequent studies demonstrated that Transcription Factor-4 (TCF4), a transcription factor implicated in WNT signaling, mediated neuroendocrine differentiation (NED) in response to enzalutamide treatment and was elevated in the enzalutamide-resistant LNCaP. In addition, we observed that PTHrP mediated enzalutamide resistance in tissue culture and inducible TCF4 overexpression resulted in enzalutamide-resistance in a mouse xenograft model. Finally, small molecule inhibitors of TCF4 or PTHrP partially reversed enzalutamide resistance in CaP cells. When tissues obtained from men who died of metastatic CaP were examined, a positive correlation was found between the expression levels of TCF4 and PTHrP. Taken together, the current results indicate that TCF4 induces enzalutamide resistance via NED in CaP."
https://openalex.org/W2973919478,"The diagnosis of Marfan spectrum includes a large number of clinical criteria. Although the identification of pathogenic variants contributes to the diagnostic process, its value to the prediction of clinical outcomes is still limited. An important novelty of the present study is represented by the statistical approach adopted to investigate genotype-phenotype correlation. The analysis has been improved considering the extended genetic information obtained by Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) and combining the effects of both rare and common genetic variants in an inclusive model. To this aim a cohort of 181 patients were analyzed with a NGS panel including 11 genes associated with Marfan spectrum. The genotype-phenotype correlation was also investigated considering the possibility to predict presence of a pathological mutation in Marfan syndrome (MFS) main genes based only on the analysis of phenotypic traits. Results obtained indicate that information about clinical traits can be summarized in a new variable that resulted significantly associated with the probability to find a pathological mutation in MFS main genes. This is important since the choice of the genetic test is often influenced by the phenotypic characterization of patients. Moreover, both rare and common variants were found to significantly contribute to clinical spectrum and their combination allowed to increase the percentage of phenotype variability that could be explained based on genetic factors. Results highlight the opportunity to take advantage of the overall genetic information obtained by NGS data to have a better clinical classification of patients."
https://openalex.org/W2973876070,"Capture–recapture (CR) models are an essential tool for estimating demographic parameters in most animal and some plant populations. To avoid drawing incorrect conclusions in any statistical inference, a crucial prerequisite is to assess the goodness of fit of a general model to the data. In CR models, a frequent cause of lack of fit, is the so-called transience effect, which is due to a lower expectation of re-observation of individuals marked for the first time as compared to other individuals. The transience effect may result either from different biological causes or from the sampling procedure. A transience effect is usually treated by distinguishing at least two age-classes in the survival probability, but other approaches may be more suitable. Here we develop a conceptual and analytical framework for including a transience effect in capture-recapture models. We show the implementation of two additional parametrizations that incorporate a transience effect. With these parametrizations, we can directly estimate the “transience probability” defined as the probability that a newly caught individual disappear from the population beyond what is expected based on the behavior of the previously caught individuals in the same sample. Additionally, these parametrizations allow testing biological hypotheses concerning drivers affecting this probability. Results from our case study show differences between parametrizations, with the parametrization most currently used giving different estimates, especially when including covariates. We advocate for a unifying framework for treating a transience effect, that helps clarifying the ideas and terminology, and where the biological reasons should be the rule for choosing the appropriate analytical procedure. This framework will also open new and powerful ways for the detection and exploration of ecological processes such as the costs of the first reproduction or the deleterious effects of some types of marking."
https://openalex.org/W2973956612,"Using fMRI, Hugdahl et al. (2015) reported the existence of a general-domain cortical network during active task-processing which was non-specific to the cognitive task being processed. They labelled this network the extrinsic mode network (EMN). The EMN would be predicted to be negatively, or anti-correlated with the classic default mode network (DMN), typically observed during periods of rest, such that while the EMN should be down-regulated and the DMN up-regulated in the absence of demands for task-processing, the reverse should occur when demands change from resting to task-processing. This would require alternating periods of task-processing and resting and analyzing data continuously when demands change from active to passive periods and vice versa. We were particularly interested in how the networks interact in the critical transition points between conditions. For this purpose, we used an auditory task with multiple cognitive demands in a standard fMRI block-design. Task-present (ON) blocks were alternated with an equal number of task-absent, or rest (OFF) blocks to capture network dynamics across time and changing environmental demands. To achieve this, we specified the onset of each block, and used a finite-impulse response function (FIR) as basis function for estimation of the fMRI-BOLD response. During active (ON) blocks, the results showed an initial rapid onset of activity in the EMN network, which remained throughout the period, and faded away during the first scan of the OFF-block. During OFF blocks, activity in the DMN network showed an initial time-lag where neither the EMN nor the DMN was active, after which the DMN was up-regulated. Studying network dynamics in alternating passive and active periods may provide new insights into brain network interaction and regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2974581076,"Objective Airways of children with cystic fibrosis (CF) harbor complex polymicrobial communities which correlates with pulmonary disease progression and use of antibiotics. Throat swabs are widely used in young CF children as a surrogate to detect potentially pathogenic microorganisms in lower airways. However, the relationship between upper and lower airway microbial communities remains poorly understood. This study aims to determine (1) to what extent oropharyngeal microbiome resembles the lung microbiome in CF children and (2) if lung microbiome composition correlates with airway inflammation. Method Throat swabs and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were obtained concurrently from 21 CF children and 26 disease controls. Oropharyngeal and lung microbiota were analyzed using 16S rRNA deep sequencing and correlated with neutrophil counts in BAL and antibiotic exposure. Results Oropharyngeal microbial communities clustered separately from lung communities and had higher microbial diversity (p < 0.001). CF microbiome differed significantly from non-CF controls, with a higher abundance of Proteobacteria in both upper and lower CF airways. Neutrophil count in the BAL correlated negatively with the diversity but not richness of the lung microbiome. In CF children, microbial genes involved in bacterial motility proteins, two-component system, flagella assembly, and secretion system were enriched in both oropharyngeal and lung microbiome, whereas genes associated with synthesis and metabolism of nucleic acids and protein dominated the non-CF controls. Conclusions This study identified a unique microbial profile with altered microbial diversity and metabolic functions in CF airways which is significantly affected by airway inflammation. These results highlight the limitations of using throat swabs as a surrogate to study lower airway microbiome and metagenome in CF children."

In Addis Ababa with around 3.5 million inhabitants, more than 2000 cases are diagnosed annually. In this retrospective population-based cohort study we assessed completeness of and waiting time for cancer-therapy among patients registered in the Addis Ababa City Cancer Registry (AACCR), Ethiopia. Patient hospital files were retrieved to complete the data from AACCR. A total of 588 files were found (51% of those diagnosed from January to March 2012 and 2014). We analyzed completeness and waiting time of chemotherapy and radiotherapy; with completeness defined as ≥85% therapy received according to local guidelines. Analysis was done for the five most common cancer-types commonly treated with chemotherapy (breast, colorectal, non-Hodgkin`s lymphoma, lung and ovarian) and the four most common cancer-types commonly treated with radiotherapy (breast, cervical, head and neck and rectal). In our study, half of the patients (54.1%) received adequately dosed chemotherapy and 24.5% of patients received adequately dosed radiotherapy. The median waiting time was 2.1 months (Range: 0 to 20.72) for chemotherapy and 7 months (Range: 0.17 to 21.8) for radiotherapy. This study underscores the need for health system measures to improve cancer-directed therapy in Ethiopia, especially concerning radiotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2973883302,"Amphibians, the most threatened group of vertebrates, are seen as indicators of the sixth mass extinction on earth. Thousands of species are threatened with extinction and many have been affected by an emerging infectious disease, chytridiomycosis, caused by the fungal pathogen, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). However, amphibians exhibit different responses to the pathogen, such as survival and population persistence with infection, or mortality of individuals and complete population collapse after pathogen invasion. Multiple factors can affect host pathogen dynamics, yet few studies have provided a temporal view that encompasses both the epizootic phase (i.e. pathogen invasion and host collapse), and the transition to a more stable co-existence (i.e. recovery of infected host populations). In the Sierra Nevada mountains of California, USA, conspecific populations of frogs currently exhibit dramatically different host/ Bd-pathogen dynamics. To provide a temporal context by which present day dynamics may be better understood, we use a Bd qPCR assay to test 1165 amphibian specimens collected between 1900 and 2005. Our historical analyses reveal a pattern of pathogen invasion and eventual spread across the Sierra Nevada over the last century. Although we found a small number of Bd-infections prior to 1970, these showed no sign of spread or increase in infection prevalence over multiple decades. After the late 1970s, when mass die offs were first noted, our data show Bd as much more prevalent and more spatially spread out, suggesting epizootic spread. However, across the ~400km2 area, we found no evidence of a wave-like pattern, but instead discovered multiple, nearly-simultaneous invasions within regions. We found that Bd invaded and spread in the central Sierra Nevada (Yosemite National Park area) about four decades before it invaded and spread in the southern Sierra Nevada (Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks area), and suggest that the temporal pattern of pathogen invasion may help explain divergent contemporary host pathogen dynamics."

Because amphibian hosts invest more in immunity at warmer than cooler temperatures and parasites might acclimate to temperature shifts faster than hosts (creating lags in optimal host immunity), researchers have hypothesized that a temperature shift from cold-to-warm might result in increased amphibian sensitivity to pathogens, whereas a shift from warm-to-cold might result in decreased sensitivity. Support for components of this climate-variability based hypothesis have been provided by prior studies of the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) that causes the disease chytridiomycosis in amphibians. We experimentally tested whether temperature shifts before exposure to Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) alters susceptibility to the disease chytridiomycosis in the larval stage of two amphibian species–western toads (Anaxyrus boreas) and northern red legged frogs (Rana aurora). Both host species harbored elevated Bd infection intensities under constant cold (15° C) temperature in comparison to constant warm (20° C) temperature. Additionally, both species experienced an increase in Bd infection abundance after shifted from 15° C to 20° C, compared to a constant 20° C but they experienced a decrease in Bd after shifted from 20° C to 15° C, compared to a constant 15° C. These results are in contrast to prior studies of adult amphibians highlighting the potential for species and stage differences in the temperature-dependence of chytridiomycosis."
https://openalex.org/W2973531973,"Since their appearance, humanized mice carrying human immune system seemed promising tools to study the crosstalk between cancer and immunity. The NOD-scidIL2Rgammanull (NSG) mice engrafted with human cord blood (hCB)-CD34+ cells have been proposed to be a valuable tool to reproduce human immune system in mouse. However, the lack of solid evidences on the functionality of their human immune components limits their usage in immune-oncology. We report that (hCB)-CD34+ cells lose their ability to propagate and originate bone marrow-derived human immune cells after two serial transplantations in NSG mice. We demonstrate that transplants of bone marrow patient-derived acute myeloid leukemias (hAMLs) grow very similarly in the humanized (hCB)-CD34+ NSG and parental NSG mice. The similar extent of engraftment and development of leukemias in (hCB)-CD34+ NSG and controls suggests a poor human immune response against not compatible hAMLs. Our findings suggest that (hCB)-CD34+ NSG mice are transient and/or incomplete carriers of the human immune system and, therefore, represent a suboptimal tool to study the interaction between tumor and immune cells."
https://openalex.org/W2973677989,"The maturation of photon-counting detector (PCD) technology promises to enhance routine CT imaging applications with high-fidelity spectral information. In this paper, we demonstrate the power of this synergy and our complementary reconstruction techniques, performing 4D, cardiac PCD-CT data acquisition and reconstruction in a mouse model of atherosclerosis, including calcified plaque. Specifically, in vivo cardiac micro-CT scans were performed in four ApoE knockout mice, following their development of calcified plaques. The scans were performed with a prototype PCD (DECTRIS, Ltd.) with 4 energy thresholds. Projections were sampled every 10 ms with a 10 ms exposure, allowing the reconstruction of 10 cardiac phases at each of 4 energies (40 total 3D volumes per mouse scan). Reconstruction was performed iteratively using the split Bregman method with constraints on spectral rank and spatio-temporal gradient sparsity. The reconstructed images represent the first in vivo, 4D PCD-CT data in a mouse model of atherosclerosis. Robust regularization during iterative reconstruction yields high-fidelity results: an 8-fold reduction in noise standard deviation for the highest energy threshold (relative to unregularized algebraic reconstruction), while absolute spectral bias measurements remain below 13 Hounsfield units across all energy thresholds and scans. Qualitatively, image domain material decomposition results show clear separation of iodinated contrast and soft tissue from calcified plaque in the in vivo data. Quantitatively, spatial, spectral, and temporal fidelity are verified through a water phantom scan and a realistic MOBY phantom simulation experiment: spatial resolution is robustly preserved by iterative reconstruction (10% MTF: 2.8-3.0 lp/mm), left-ventricle, cardiac functional metrics can be measured from iodine map segmentations with ~1% error, and small calcifications (615 μm) can be detected during slow moving phases of the cardiac cycle. Given these preliminary results, we believe that PCD technology will enhance dynamic CT imaging applications with high-fidelity spectral and material information."
https://openalex.org/W2973300227,"Introduction The importance of helping pregnant women maintain a healthy lifestyle and prevent excessive gestational weight gain is well recognized, but pregnant women do not always perceive communication about body weight as respectful or helpful. Furthermore, fear of inducing shame or guilt can prohibit some midwives from talking about body weight, especially if the woman has obesity. We aimed to explore what women of reproductive age with obesity regard to be the most important and relevant aspects when discussing gestational weight management. Methods Qualitative interview study using focus groups and individual semi-structured interviews with 17 women of reproductive age (19–39 y) with obesity. Thematic analysis was used to analyze the data. Results We identified three themes: 1) Importance of obtaining vital medical information; 2) A wish to feel understood and treated with respect; 3) Midwives’ approach is crucial in sensitive key situations, which include bringing up the subject of body weight, weighing, providing weight-related information, coaching lifestyle modification, dealing with emotional reactions and ending a conversation. Conclusions A majority of the interviewed women wished to receive information about risks about obesity and gestational weight gain, and recommendations on weight management. However, the risk of midwives offending someone by raising the topic may be increased if the pregnant woman believe that gestational weight gain is uncontrollable by the individual. Also, several situations during maternity care meetings can be stigmatizing and make women less receptive to advice or support. Women suggest that a good working alliance is likely to be achieved if midwives have knowledge about the causes of obesity, take interest in the patients’ background, have a non-judgmental approach and refrain from giving unsolicited advice."
https://openalex.org/W2973614261,"In this paper, we reexamined the typical analysis methods of a visuomotor sequence learning task, namely the ASRT task (J. H. Howard & Howard, 1997). We pointed out that the current analysis of data could be improved by paying more attention to pre-existing biases (i.e. by eliminating artifacts by using new filters) and by introducing a new data grouping that is more in line with the task’s inherent statistical structure. These suggestions result in more types of learning scores that can be quantified and also in purer measures. Importantly, the filtering method proposed in this paper also results in higher individual variability, possibly indicating that it had been masked previously with the usual methods. The implications of our findings relate to other sequence learning tasks as well, and opens up opportunities to study different types of implicit learning phenomena."
https://openalex.org/W2973632277,"Inflammatory immune responses induced by lipopolysaccharides (LPS) of gram-negative bacteria play an important role in the pathogenesis of preterm labor and delivery, and in neonatal disorders. To better characterize LPS-induced inflammatory response, we determined the cytokine profile of umbilical cord blood mononuclear cells (UBMC) stimulated with LPS of seven vaginal gram-negative bacteria commonly found in pregnant women with preterm labor and preterm rupture of membrane. UBMC from ten newborns of healthy volunteer mothers were stimulated with purified LPS of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Citrobacter freundii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. UBMC supernatants were tested for the presence of secreted pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-1β, TNF), anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10), TH1-type cytokines (IL-12, IFN-γ), and chemokines (IL-8, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, MCP-1) by Luminex technology. The ten cytokines were differentially induced by the LPS variants. LPS of E. coli and E. aerogenes showed the strongest stimulatory activity and P. aeruginosa the lowest. Interestingly, the ability of UBMC to respond to LPS varied greatly among donors, suggesting a strong individual heterogeneity in LPS-triggered inflammatory response."
https://openalex.org/W2974595448,"The mitochondrial signature glycerophospholipid, cardiolipin (CL), binds to transporters of the inner mitochondrial membrane and plays a central role in formation and stability of respiratory supercomplexes. Functional and structural requirement of CL for mitochondrial membrane proteins has been studied in vitro using purified reconstituted proteins or in CL synthesis knockout cells that are viable under specific growth conditions. However, no information is available on mitochondrial function, protein stability, or expression levels in cells during CL depletion. In contrast to yeast and mammalian cells, CL synthesis is essential in Trypanosoma brucei. By stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture and mass spectrometry, we analyzed protein levels in T. brucei procyclic forms at different time points during depletion of CL using tightly controllable conditional CL synthase knockout mutants and identified a set of novel CL-dependent proteins (CLDPs) with unknown functions. Depletion of individual CLDPs using knockout or knockdown technologies showed that although CL synthesis is essential, expression of a given CLDP is not. In addition, ablation of CL synthesis leads to respiratory supercomplex instability and altered mitochondrial ultrastructure and function. Our findings suggest that CL may bind to and affect many more proteins in eukaryotes than previously thought.-Schädeli, D., Serricchio, M., Ben Hamidane, H., Loffreda, A., Hemphill, A., Beneke, T., Gluenz, E., Graumann, J., Bütikofer, P.

https://openalex.org/W2974555928,"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is a devastating viral disease affecting the swine industry worldwide. Genetic variation in host immunity has been considered as one of the potential determinants to improve the immunocompetence, thereby resistance to PRRS. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the breed difference in innate immune response to PRRSV vaccination between German Landrace (DL) and Pietrain (Pi) pigs. We analyzed microarray-based transcriptome profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) collected before (0 h) and 24 h after PRRSV vaccination from purebred DL and Pi pigs with three biological replicates. In total 4,269 transcripts were identified to be differentially expressed in PBMCs in at least any of four tested contrast pairs (i.e. DL-24h vs. DL-0h, Pi-24h vs. Pi-0h, DL-0h vs. Pi-0h and DL-24h vs. Pi-24h). The number of vaccine-induced differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was much higher (2,459) in DL pigs than that of Pi pigs (291). After 24 h of PRRSV vaccination, 1,046 genes were differentially expressed in PMBCs of DL pigs compared to that of Pi (DL-24h vs. Pi-24h), indicating the breed differences in vaccine responsiveness. The top biological pathways significantly affected by DEGs of both breeds were linked to immune response functions. The network enrichment analysis identified ADAM17, STAT1, MMS19, RPA2, BAD, UCHL5 and APC as potential regulatory genes for the functional network of PRRSV vaccine response specific for DL; while FOXO3, IRF2, ADRBK1, FHL3, PPP2CB and NCOA6 were found to be the most potential hubs of Pi specific transcriptome network. In conclusion, our data provided insights of breed-specific host transcriptome responses to PRRSV vaccination which might contribute in better understanding of PPRS resistance in pigs."
https://openalex.org/W2973444254,"Purpose To describe corneal astigmatism in the UK Biobank population and to look for associations with other biometric variables and socio-demographic factors. Methods This analysis included a subsample of 107,452 participants of the UK Biobank study who underwent an enhanced ophthalmic examination including autorefractor keratometry (Tomey RC 5000, Tomey Corp., Nagoya, Japan). Participants were recruited from across the United Kingdom between 2006 and 2010, and all were between 40 to 69 years. After quality control and applying relevant exclusions, data on corneal astigmatism on 83,751 participants were included for analysis. Potential associations were tested through univariable regression and significant parameters carried forward for multivariable analysis. Results In univariable analysis, the characteristics significantly associated with higher corneal astigmatism (P<0.001), by order of magnitude were, female gender, white ethnicity, lighter skin colour, use of UV protection, lower alcohol intake, lower corneal-compensated intraocular pressure (ccIOP), older age at completion of education, younger age, higher Townsend deprivation index, lower height and lower systolic blood pressure. After inclusion in the multivariable analysis, gender, skin colour, alcohol intake, age at completion of full-time education, ccIOP, age and Townsend deprivation score remained significant (all P<0.001). Increased corneal astigmatism was also found to be significantly associated with amblyopia or strabismus. Conclusions This analysis confirms previous associations with astigmatism such as younger age and female gender, and identified novel risk factors including lighter skin colour, lower alcohol intake, later age having completed full time education later, lower ccIOP and higher Townsend deprivation index. Further research is needed to investigate these novel associations."
https://openalex.org/W2974622889,"Within the dairy industry, most antimicrobials are used for dry-cow therapy or mastitis treatment. To reduce antimicrobial usage in dairy cows, increasing awareness and behaviour change is necessary. As veterinarians are known to be influenced by their peers, peer study groups as a continuous education might contribute to this. Therefore, the objective of this study was to analyse written records of veterinary peer study group meetings to identify factors associated with antimicrobial prescribing decisions, and to analyse veterinarians' attitude towards the benefits of this continuous education method. Twenty-three participating Swiss cattle practitioners were divided into three groups. Each group met every two to five months, together with a facilitator and an expert on the topic to be discussed. Written records from every meeting were taken and analysed qualitatively to identify factors influencing veterinarians' decisions on antimicrobial prescribing and mastitis therapy. In addition, focus group discussions were conducted after the last meeting, to assess the veterinarians' learning achievements gained during the peer study group meetings. Extrinsic factors such as external pressure, competition, farmer, individual animal, farm and diagnostics as well as intrinsic factors such as own experience/attitude, knowledge and change of mindset during career could be shown to influence veterinarians' decisions on antimicrobial prescribing. In the focus group discussions, the veterinarians stated that they gained new knowledge, received new stimuli, exchanged with their peers and felt supported in their relationship to their farmers. Since the identified factors are partly interrelated, it is not sufficient to change a single factor to achieve a change in the antimicrobial prescription behaviour of veterinarians. Veterinary peer study groups could contribute to the intention to change, because veterinarians experienced multiple benefits from this method of continuous education. In order to quantify this, the prescription data of the veterinarians are analysed in a next step."
https://openalex.org/W2974711519,"The present study aimed to investigate the prevalence and clinical consequences of occult intra-operative periprosthetic femoral fractures in total hip arthroplasty (THA). Between 2012 and 2017, a total of 113 primary THAs were enrolled. The mean age of the patients was 66.4 ± 7.6 years. We assessed occult intra-operative periprosthetic femoral fractures with the use of computed tomography (CT) and risk factors, including age, sex, body mass index, diagnosis, stem size, and radiographic parameters of proximal femoral geometry were analyzed. We also assessed the differences in thigh pain and stem subsidence and alignment between the patients with and without occult periprosthetic femoral fracture. Occult intra-operative periprosthetic femoral fractures were found in 13 of 113 hips (11.5%). In 9/13 (69.2%) of occult fractures, fracture lines were started from the region below the tip of the lesser trochanter. Six periprosthetic femoral fractures (5.3%) were found during the operation. Out of the five hips that had detected femoral fractures around the lesser trochanter intra-operatively, four hips (80%) showed concurrent occult fractures on different levels. The female sex (P = .01) and canal filling ratio at 7 cm below the tip of the lesser trochanter (P = .01) were significantly different between the patients with and without occult periprosthetic femoral fracture. The sex was significantly associated with an increased risk in predicting an occult intra-operative periprosthetic femoral fracture (odds ratio of male, 0.25 compared with the female; 95% CI, 0.08–0.85; p = .02). There was a significant difference in the incidence of thigh pain between occult fracture group and non-occult fracture group (P < .05). There were no significant differences in stem subsidence and alignment between the patients with and without occult periprosthetic femoral fracture. All 13 cases of occult intra-operative periprosthetic femoral fractures were healed at the final follow-up. Occult periprosthetic femoral fractures are common during a long, trapezoidal, double-tapered cementless femoral stem fixation in primary THA, that CT scans are helpful to identify them, and that these fractures do not adversely affect the implant’s survival if a rigid fixation of the implants has been achieved."
https://openalex.org/W2974020347,"A high work of breathing can compromise limb oxygen delivery during sustained high-intensity exercise. However, it is unclear if the same is true for intermittent sprint exercise. This project examined the effect of adding an inspiratory load on locomotor muscle tissue reoxygenation during repeated-sprint exercise. Ten healthy males completed three experiment sessions of ten 10-s sprints, separated by 30-s of passive rest on a cycle ergometer. The first two sessions were “all-out’ efforts performed without (CTRL) or with inspiratory loading (INSP) in a randomised and counterbalanced order. The third experiment session (MATCH) consisted of ten 10-s work-matched intervals. Tissue saturation index (TSI) and deoxy-haemoglobin (HHb) of the vastus lateralis and sixth intercostal space was monitored with near-infrared spectroscopy. Vastus lateralis reoxygenation (ΔReoxy) was calculated as the difference from peak HHb (sprint) to nadir HHb (recovery). Total mechanical work completed was similar between INSP and CTRL (effect size: -0.18, 90% confidence limit ±0.43), and differences in vastus lateralis TSI during the sprint (-0.01 ±0.33) and recovery (-0.08 ±0.50) phases were unclear. There was also no meaningful difference in ΔReoxy (0.21 ±0.37). Intercostal HHb was higher in the INSP session compared to CTRL (0.42 ±0.34), whilst the difference was unclear for TSI (-0.01 ±0.33). During MATCH exercise, differences in vastus lateralis TSI were unclear compared to INSP for both sprint (0.10 ±0.30) and recovery (-0.09 ±0.48) phases, and there was no meaningful difference in ΔReoxy (-0.25 ±0.55). Intercostal TSI was higher during MATCH compared to INSP (0.95 ±0.53), whereas HHb was lower (-1.09 ±0.33). The lack of difference in ΔReoxy between INSP and CTRL suggests that for intermittent sprint exercise, the metabolic O2 demands of both the respiratory and locomotor muscles can be met. Additionally, the similarity of the MATCH suggests that ΔReoxy was maximal in all exercise conditions."

All cases hospitalised in 2013 with no hospitalisation the previous two years were retained. All hospital stays during the year following the index hospitalisation were extracted, and classified as incident stays, monitoring stays or stays due to disease worsening. Costs were attributed from French national tariffs.384 patients in France were hospitalised with incident pulmonary arterial hypertension in 2013. Over the following twelve months, patients made 1,271 stays related to pulmonary arterial hypertension (415 incident stays, 604 monitoring stays and 252 worsening stays). Mean age was 59.6 years and 241 (62.8%) patients were women. Liver disease and connective tissue diseases were documented in 62 patients (16.1%) each. Thirty-one patients (8.1%) died during hospitalisation and four (1.0%) received a lung/heart-lung transplantation.

This study aims to test the impact of a pharmacist-led academic detailing program on improving the overall statin therapy prescribing in Malaysian hospital and primary care settings.As a quasi-experimental design with a control group and pre-tests., we examined 1,598 medical records of T2DM subjects in six healthcare facilities in the state of Pahang, Malaysia. In all study sites, there was a pre and post-intervention assessment of the percentage of appropriate statin therapy prescribing that complied with the clinical guidelines with no potential safety issues. The intervention was an academic detailing program offered to the health care providers in three study sites, while the other three sites served as the control group. A comparison of the overall percentage of appropriate statin therapy prescribing before and after the academic detailing was performed in all intervention and control sites.Overall, 797 medical records were examined in the pre-intervention phase, and 801 records were evaluated in the post-intervention phase. The academic detailing program was associated with a statistically significant difference in the proportion of appropriate statin therapy prescribing between the post-intervention phase compared to the pre-intervention phase (n = 246, 61.7% versus n = 188, 47.1%), p = 0.001. Whereas, the appropriate statin therapy prescribing in the control study sites experienced a modest change from 53.8% (214/398) to 56.7% (228/402), p = 0.220. The academic detailing showed significant increases in the proportions of appropriate statin therapy prescribing in both hospital and primary care settings.The academic detailing program was found to be significantly associated with a positive impact on the overall statin therapy prescribing among patients with T2DM in Malaysian hospital and primary care settings."
https://openalex.org/W2973927400,"Purpose To provide a self-adaptive deep learning (DL) method to automatically detect the eye laterality based on fundus images. Methods A total of 18394 fundus images with real-world eye laterality labels were used for model development and internal validation. A separate dataset of 2000 fundus images with eye laterality labeled manually was used for external validation. A DL model was developed based on a fine-tuned Inception-V3 network with self-adaptive strategy. The area under receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) with sensitivity and specificity and confusion matrix were applied to assess the model performance. The class activation map (CAM) was used for model visualization. Results In the external validation (N = 2000, 50% labeled as left eye), the AUC of the DL model for overall eye laterality detection was 0.995 (95% CI, 0.993–0.997) with an accuracy of 99.13%. Specifically for left eye detection, the sensitivity was 99.00% (95% CI, 98.11%-99.49%) and the specificity was 99.10% (95% CI, 98.23%-99.56%). Nineteen images were wrongly classified as compared to the human labels: 12 were due to human wrong labelling, while 7 were due to poor image quality. The CAM showed that the region of interest for eye laterality detection was mainly the optic disc and surrounding areas. Conclusion We proposed a self-adaptive DL method with a high performance in detecting eye laterality based on fundus images. Results of our findings were based on real world labels and thus had practical significance in clinical settings."

Based on these observations, we are currently testing this Neo-Islet technology in an FDA guided pilot study (INAD 012–776) in insulin-dependent, spontaneously diabetic pet dogs by ultrasound-guided, intraperitoneal administration of 2x10e5 Neo-Islets/kilogram body weight to metabolically controlled (blood glucose, triglycerides, thyroid and adrenal functions) and sedated animals. We report here interim observations on the first 4 canine Neo-Islet-treated, insulin-dependent pet dogs that are now in the early to intermediate-term follow-up phase of the planned 3 year study (> 6 months post treatment). Current results from this translational study indicate that in dogs, Neo-Islets appear to engraft, redifferentiate and physiologically produce insulin, and are rejected by neither auto- nor allo-immune responses, as evidenced by (a) an absent IgG response to the allogeneic cells contained in the administered Neo-Islets, and (b) progressively improved glycemic control that achieves up to a 50% reduction in daily insulin needs paralleled by a statistically significant decrease in serum glucose concentrations. This is accomplished without the use of anti-rejection drugs or encapsulation devices. No adverse or serious adverse events related to the Neo-Islet administration have been observed to date. We conclude that this minimally invasive therapy has significant translational relevance to veterinary and clinical Type 1 diabetes mellitus by achieving complete and at this point partial glycemic control in two species, i.e., diabetic mice and dogs, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2974766035,"Infectious virus purification techniques are important for vaccine development and gene therapy applications. However, the standardized one-step purification technique using ceramic hydroxyapatite (CHAp) has proven unsuitable for poliovirus. Therefore, we designed a sequential two-step chromatographic technique for purification of the infectious Sabin type 2 vaccine strain of poliovirus from the cell culture supernatant. In the first step, we removed protein contaminants from the Sabin type 2 virus fraction by pH gradient elution on a ceramic fluoroapatite column. In the second step, we removed double-stranded DNA derived from host cells by diluting the virus fraction, directly loading it on a CHAp column, and purifying it using a phosphate gradient with 1 M sodium chloride. This process achieved removal rates of more than 99.95% and 99.99% for proteins and double-stranded DNA, respectively, and was highly reproducible and scalable. Furthermore, it is likely that it will be applicable to other virus species."

This study aims to determine whether a standardized question set can predict unexpected management changes (UMCs) at the postoperative week one (POW1) timepoint. Setting Massachusetts Eye and Ear, Harvard Medical School. Design Prospective cohort study. Methods Two-hundred-and-fifty-four consecutive phacoemulsification cases having attended an examination between postoperative days 5–14. A set of 7 ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ questions were administered to all participants by a technician at the POW1 visit. Patient answers along with perioperative patient information were recorded and analyzed. Outcomes were the incidence of UMCs at POW1. Results The incidence of UMCs was zero in uneventful cataract cases with unremarkable history and normal postoperative day one exam if no positive answers were given with the question set demonstrating 100% sensitivity (p<0.0001). A test version with 5 questions was equally sensitive in detecting UMCs at POW1 after cataract surgery. Conclusion In routine cataract cases with no positive answers to the current set of clinical questions, a POW1 visit is unlikely to result in a management change. This result offers the opportunity for eye care providers to risk-stratify patients who have had cataract surgery and individualize follow-up."

No clinical factors were significantly correlated with the detection of bacteremia. On the other hand, plasma LBP level was significantly correlated with HbA1c (r = 0.312), fasting blood glucose (r = 0.279), fasting C-peptide (r = 0.265), body mass index (r = 0.371), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (r = -0.241), and inflammatory markers (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, r = 0.543; and interleukin-6, r = 0.456). Multiple regression analysis identified body mass index, HbA1c, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and interleukin-6 as independent determinants of plasma LBP level.The plasma LBP level was similar in patients with and without bacteremia. While both bacteremia and LBP are theoretically associated with bacterial translocation, the detection of bacteremia was not associated with LBP level in T2DM."
https://openalex.org/W2974460619,"Associations between brain region volume and weight status have been observed in children cross-sectionally. However, it is unclear if differences in brain region volume precede weight gain.Two high-quality structural brain images were obtained approximately one year apart in 53 children aged 9-12 years old. Children's height and weight were also measured at each scan. Structural images were processed using the FreeSurfer software-package providing volume measures for regions of interest including the entorhinal cortex, nucleus accumbens, and hippocampus. Age- and sex-adjusted BMI z-scores (BMIz) were calculated at both timepoints. The association between brain region volume and BMIz was examined cross-sectionally using linear regression and longitudinally using structural equation modeling. All models were adjusted by estimated cranial volume to account for individual variation in head size and were corrected for multiple comparisons (pFDR<0.05).The sample of children was primarily healthy weight at baseline (79.78%). Cross-sectionally at the one-year follow-up, a positive relationship was observed between right hippocampal volume and BMIz (β = 0.43, 95% CI = (0.10, 0.77)). Longitudinally a negative relationship was observed between right entorhinal volume at baseline and BMIz at the one-year follow-up (β = -0.25, 95% CI = (-0.44, -0.07)).These results suggest that measured volumes from certain regions of the brain that have been associated with BMI in adults are associated with both concurrent BMIz and BMIz change over one-year in a primarily healthy weight sample of children. As the entorhinal cortex integrates signals from both reward and control regions, this region may be particularly important to weight management during child development."

Norming data were collected in three waves that characterized the physical properties of the stimuli and also participants' subjective ratings of the stimuli. Between each round of ratings, stimuli that did not equate with the original RME task or were not distinctly recognized as Black were removed and new stimuli were incorporated in the next round until we obtained 36 distinctive Black RME targets that matched the 36 mental states used in the original RME stimulus set. Both stimulus sets were similarly difficult and subsequent testing showed that neither Black nor White participants' mentalizing accuracy varied as a function of target race. We provide instructions for obtaining the database and stimulus ratings."

Birds are common pests on dairies, consuming and contaminating feed intended for cattle. As a result, dairy operators experience increased feed costs and increased pathogen and disease risk. We surveyed dairy operators attending the 2017 Washington Dairy Conference to examine the impact of birds on dairies in Washington State. Dairy operators reported feed losses valued at $55 per cow resulting in annual losses totaling $5.5 million in the Western region of the state and $9.2 million in the Eastern region of the state. Shooting was the most commonly used bird management method and European starlings (Sternus vulgaris) were the most frequently implicated species statewide. Bird abundance greater than 10,000 birds per day was associated with larger herd size and with self-reported presence of Johne’s disease and Salmonella."
https://openalex.org/W2973627714,"Objective Mycobacterium marinum causes a rare cutaneous disease known as fish tank granuloma (FTG). The disease manifestations resemble those associated with Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (CL). The aim of this study was to determine whether FTG was the cause of cutaneous lesions in patients who were referred to the Parasitology laboratory of Imam Reza Hospital in Mashhad to be investigated for CL. Materials/Methods One hundered patients, clinically diagnosed with CL between April 2014 and March 2015, were included in this study. Ziehl-Neelsen staining was performed to identify acid-fast Mycobacterium in addition to bacterial cultures using Löwenstein-Jensen medium. Skin lesion samples were also collected and kept on DNA banking cards for PCR testing. Results Twenty-nine of the 100 individuals with skin lesions, and therefore suspected of suffering from CL, tested positive for Mycobacterium marinum by PCR. Of these, 21 (72.4%) were male and 8(27.6%) were female. In 97% of these cases the lesions were located on hands and fingers. These patients had a history of manipulating fish and had been in contact with aquarium water. A sporotrichoid appearance was observed in 58.6% of the patients with mycobacterial lesions; 67% of patients had multiple head appearance. Conclusion Patients suspected to have CL and who test negative for CL could be affected by FTG. Therefore, after obtaining an accurate case history, molecular diagnosis is recommended for cases that give a negative result by conventional methods."
https://openalex.org/W2974159247,"Blood transfusion is the most frequently used and life-saving therapeutic procedure today. Transmission of virus, bacteria and parasitic microorganisms may occur due to transfusion (Transfusion transmitted infections-TTIs). Hepatitis B and C, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and syphilis (Treponema pallidum) bear the risk of transmission by transfusion. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), anti-HCV, anti-HIV½ and syphilis antibody (VDRL: Venereal Disease Research Laboratory) are routinely controlled in all donated blood samples. The aim of the present study was to analyze the seroprevalence rates of blood donors through screening test results according to duration, age range and gender.Data of all blood donors obtained from blood Centre of Marmara University Pendik Training and Research Hospital between January 2013 and October 2018 were analyzed retrospectively. Serum samples of the donors were analyzed for HBsAg, anti-HCV, anti-HIV½ and VDRL. Test results of 114.240 donors were scanned. Gender, age range and distribution by years of these donors were analyzed. According to age distribution of donors were divided into 4 groups.There were 114.240 participants including 106.153 (92.9%) males and 8.087 (7.1%) females. The positivity rate of HBsAg was detected 0.4% (36/8087) in females and 0.5% (500/106.153) in males. The positivity rate of anti-HCV was detected 0.4% (32/8.087) in females and 0.3% (344/106.153) in males. The positivity rate of anti HIV½ was 0.1% (9/8.087) in females and 0.1% (92/106.153) in males whereas the positivity rate of VDRL was 0.5% (41/8.087) in females and 0.3% (362/ 106.153) in males. Positivity rate for HBsAg and HCV were lower in the cases between 18 and 30 years of age. The positivity rates for anti-HIV½ was not significantly different according to the age range. Positivity rate for VDRL was higher in the cases at 51 years of age and older.No difference was found between men and women in terms of HBsAg, anti-HCV and anti-HIV½positivity. However, VDRL test positivity was significantly higher in female participants. Furthermore, HBsAg, anti-HCV and VDRL positivity rates increased by age."
https://openalex.org/W2974492182,"Introduction Developing guidelines to inform the use of antiretroviral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV prevention in resource-limited settings must necessarily be informed by considering the resources and infrastructure needed for PrEP delivery. We describe an approach that identifies subpopulations of cisgender men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women (TGW) to prioritize for the rollout of PrEP in resource-limited settings. Methods We use data from the iPrEx study, a multi-national phase III study of PrEP for HIV prevention in MSM/TGW, to build statistical models that identify subpopulations at high risk of HIV acquisition without PrEP, and with high expected PrEP benefit. We then evaluate empirically the population impact of policies recommending PrEP to these subpopulations, and contrast these with existing policies. Results A policy recommending PrEP to a high risk subpopulation of MSM/TGW reporting condomless receptive anal intercourse over the last 3 months (estimated 3.3% 1-year HIV incidence) yields an estimated 1.95% absolute reduction in 1-year HIV incidence at the population level, and 3.83% reduction over 2 years. Importantly, such a policy requires rolling PrEP out to just 59.7% of MSM/TGW in the iPrEx population. We find that this policy is identical to that which prioritizes MSM/TGW with high expected PrEP benefit. It is estimated to achieve nearly the same reduction in HIV incidence as the PrEP guideline put forth by the US Centers for Disease Control, which relies on the measurement of more behavioral risk factors and which would recommend PrEP to a larger subset of the MSM/TGW population (86% vs. 60%). Conclusions These findings may be used to focus future mathematical modelling studies of PrEP in resource-limited settings on prioritizing PrEP for high-risk subpopulations of MSM/TGW. The statistical approach we took could be employed to develop PrEP policies for other at-risk populations and resource-limited settings."
https://openalex.org/W2974209083,"Differential Evolution (DE) is powerful for global optimization problems. Among DE algorithms, JADE and its variants, whose mutation strategy is DE/current-to-pbest/1 with optional archive, have good performance. A significant feature of the above mutation strategy is that one individual for difference operation comes from the union of the optional external archive and the population. In existing DE algorithms based on the mutation strategy-JADE and its variants, individuals eliminated from the population are send to the archive. In this paper, we propose a scheme for managing the optional external archive. According to our scheme, two subpopulations are maintained in the population. Each of them regards the other as the archive. In experiments, our scheme is applied in JADE and two of its variants-SHADE and L-SHADE. Experimental results show that our scheme can enhance JADE and its variants. Moreover, it can be seen that L-SHADE with our scheme performs significantly better than four DE algorithms, CoBiDE, MPEDE, EDEV, and MLCCDE."
