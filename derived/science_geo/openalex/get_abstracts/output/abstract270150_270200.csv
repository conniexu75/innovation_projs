https://openalex.org/W1969293141,"Male field crickets, Gryllus integer, call and attract mates, or they silently intercept females attracted to calling males. Selection experiments demonstrate that the duration of nightly calling has an important genetic component. Mean calling times in high and low lines were significantly different and had realized heritabilities of 0.50 and 0.53, respectively. Selection can operate in such a way that each of the alternative forms of male reproductive behavior is associated with a specific genetic substrate. This has not yet been shown for other species in which males adopt contrasting modes of mating behavior."

The temperature gradient from core to mantle permits considerable energy economy, and it is abolished only shortly before swarm takeoff."

Features such as size, shape, wall organization, and the structure of the subtending hyphal stalk suggest affinities with the modern endomycorrhizal fungus Glomus."
https://openalex.org/W2048522518,The importance of turbulence in the flow of equatorial currents has been noted by modelers but not observed. Recent measurements of turbulence show an increase in strength at the equator and confirm its role as a sink of the kinetic energy of currents at the equator.

https://openalex.org/W2047083083,"IT was shown originally by X-ray and electron diffraction, and has been confirmed by other physical and by chemical means, that the most stable and permanent form of the cyclohexane ring is that particular strainless form which is sometimes likened to a chair or a staircase. Geometrically, its chief feature is a six-fold alternating axis of symmetry. Its twelve extracyclic bonds fall into two classes1: six lie parallel to the axis, while six extend radially outward at angles of ± 109.5° to the axis. The stereochemical properties of substituents bound by these two classes of bond are so different that a need has been felt for verbal and symbolic means of distinguishing the classes."
