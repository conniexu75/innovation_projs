https://openalex.org/W1679641904,"A study of the rates of incorporation in vivo of labeled amino acids into tissue proteins was undertaken to find the best time at which intermediates in the process might be found. The rates observed were so fast that we decided to investigate the process in some detail. The amino acids were L-α-aminoadipic-6-C14 acid, glycine-1-C14, L-histidine-2-C14-imidazole, L-leucine-1-C14, and L-lysine-1-C14."

https://openalex.org/W2052321838,"LASER1 has demonstrated high succinic dehydro-genase activity in extracts of muscle pulp of Ascaris lumbricoides. In the presence of succinate these preparations reduce methylene blue, but do not react with atmospheric oxygen. On the other hand, succinate stimulates the respiration of dialysed muscle mince of Ascaris2. Furthermore, we have observed that homogenates of thoroughly washed Ascaris muscle oxidize succinate even in the absence of methylene blue. The activity of this preparation was markedly higher in 100 per cent oxygen than in air, and was increased when catalase and ethyl alcohol were added, indicating the production of hydrogen peroxide1. No oxygen uptake was observed under similar conditions in the absence of succinate. Therefore, succinic dehydrogenase of Ascaris muscle can transfer hydrogen either to methylene blue or to an enzyme system, which, in turn, reacts with atmospheric oxygen. However, the latter is not identical with the cytochrome – cytochrome oxidase system considered to be the universal catalyst of all respiring cells3."

https://openalex.org/W2983343648,"WE have been very interested to see the letter by Weil and Williams1 and their remarks on the value of Day's work on chromatography in columns of powdered limestone and fuller's earth, and on Engler's and Albrecht's elaboration of his results, which are certainly cogent. For a complete picture of the history of chromatography, however, it is important to point out that even this is not the full story, and there is a still earlier work in which column chromatography was employed."

https://openalex.org/W2984730995,"IT is widely believed that, in mammals generally, cardiac nerve cells are limited to the atria, extending at the most as far distally as the base of the ventricles near the atrioventricular sulcus. We have examined histologically the hearts of representatives of a number of orders of mammals, namely, Monotremes, Marsupials, Insectivora, Rodentia, Carnivora, Cetacea, Artiodactyla, Perissodactyla, Chiroptera, Menotyphla and Primates. In most of these, no nerve cells were found in the epicardium, endocardium or myocardium of the ventricles. Only in Cetacea and Artiodactyla (see later) are ventricular nerve cells abundant; literally, many thousands extend widely over both ventricles in the epicardium, and numerous nerve cells accompany the atrioventricular bundle and its right and left limbs in the ventricular endocardium, but are not found elsewhere in the endocardium or in the myocardium. In Perissodactyla, no nerve cells were found in the ventricles; the difference between Artiodactyla and Perissodactyla in this respect lends support to the modern tendency (based on other morphological differences) to discontinue the use of the term ‘Ungulates’ to include both these groups, and to raise both to equivalent ordinal rank. Among Artiodactyla, the Ruminants show a much more extensive distribution of ventricular nerve cells than do the Non-ruminants; in this respect the Cetacea resemble the Ruminants, a feature that supports other morphological evidence of affinity between these two groups."

https://openalex.org/W2133920792,SNELL1 first reported that the half-life of radioactive bromine-82 was 33.9 ± 0.1 hr. Berne2 has recently determined the half-life of this isotope and reported a value of 36.0 ± 0.1 hr. Chiang and Willard3 suggested that the half-life is nearer 35 hr. than the generally quoted value of 34 hr.4.

https://openalex.org/W2089652988,MAY I support Prof. Alan Boyden's plea1 that parthenogenesis should not be classified as asexual reproduction? The habit of doing so presumably arose because the text-book definition of sexual reproduction excludes anything which does not involve fusion of gametes; but such a reliance on a definition instead of on the facts implies a degree of philosophical realism which has no proper place in science.

These studies were extended by Chandler2 and Sarles3,4"

https://openalex.org/W1975780692,"IN a study of penetration of insecticides through insect cuticle, Webb and Green1 found that benzyl alcohol would greatly reduce the time required to kill sheep keds with diphenylamine, although the toxicity of the alcohol was slight. We have found in the course of two seasons work that benzyl alcohol will greatly increase the toxicity of certain ovicides towards the winter eggs of the fruit tree red spider mite, Metatetranychus ulmi (Koch). A large number of ovicides are ineffective against this egg at economic concentrations, and a means of increasing their efficiency would be of value."
https://openalex.org/W1993054434,"PRELIMINARY consideration was given to the orthography of the scientific names of animals in 1948 in Paris both by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature and by the International Congress of Zoology. It was recognized that the provisions relating to this (Article 19) in the “Règles Internationales de la Nomenclature Zoologique” are quite inadequate, for the three conditions in which, under that Article, the original spelling of a scientific name must be emended all involve subjective judgments on the part of the reader; thus it provides that a name is to be emended where it is “evident” that the original spelling of a name is defective by reason of (1) a “faute d'orthographe”, (2) a “faute de transcription”, or (3) a “faute d'impression”. Clearly what is “evident” to one zoologist may be the reverse to others, and in consequence provisions of this kind can never secure the principal object sought by zoologists, namely, stability in zoological nomenclature."
