https://openalex.org/W2015332408,"Nine of the ten most common sponge species on the fore-reef slope of Davies Reef(Great Barrier Reef) contain symbiotic cyanobacteria. Six of the ten are net primary producers, with three times more oxygen produced by photosynthesis than is consumed during respiration. Light interception is enhanced by morphological flattening, thereby increasing the potential for phototrophic nutrition, a factor crucial in the ecology of most sessile coral reef invertebrates."
https://openalex.org/W2092818632,"Concurrent measurements of particle concentrations in the near-surface water and of particle fluxes in the deep water of the Sargasso Sea show a close coupling between the two for biogenic components. The concentrations of suspended matter appear to follow an annual cycle similar to that of primary production and deepwater particle flux. Although the concentration of particulate aluminum in the surface water appears to vary randomly with respect to that cycle, the removal of aluminum to deep water is intimately linked to the rapid downward transport of organic matter."
https://openalex.org/W2046545960,"Daily otolith increments were used to determine the daily pattern of settlement of the bluehead wrasse (Thalassoma bifasciatum), a Caribbean coral reef fish. Recruitment occurs in brief and sporadic episodes even though bluehead wrasses spawn every day. Patterns of recruitment do not correspond to patterns of mortality on the reef. The composition of the adult population directly reflects the relative rates of recruitment of juveniles the year before. The population dynamics of this species may therefore be determined by the supply of recruits and not by the supply of space or some other resource on the reef."
https://openalex.org/W2021402742,"Hardened, high-relief stromatolites have been discovered along the margins of some Bahamian platforms. They occur in high-energy (tidal) oolitic sand environments in waters ranging in depth from about 1 to 5 meters. Physical stress produced by actively migrating bed forms of oolitic sand appears to exclude grazing gastropods and subsequent community successions, permitting stromatolite growth."

https://openalex.org/W2016506092,"Handling of autotomized, thrashing and autotomized, exhausted tails of the lizard Scincella lateralis by mammals and snakes was tested to examine the function of postautotomy tail movement. Tail movement attracted a mammal's attack to the tail, permitting the lizard to escape and increased the time required for a snake to subdue a tail before swallowing it, increasing the lizard's escape time by 40 percent. Lactate concentrations of autotomized tails after movement were compared to those of intact tails after rest in S. lateralis, a species with a high rate of autotomized tail thrashing, and Anolis carolinensis, a species with a low rate of thrashing. Postautotomy movement increased tail lactate concentration in both species, but mean tail lactate concentration in S. lateralis was 60 percent higher than that in A. carolinensis, and a third higher than that reportedfor whole-body lactate content of the very mobile lizard Dipsosaurus dorsalis."
https://openalex.org/W2038363867,"New experimental procedures have made it possible to establish specific hydration rates for the numerous compositional types of obsidian to be found at archeological sites in Kenya. Two rates are applied to artifacts from the Prospect Farm site, revealing a history of occupation extending back 120,000 years."
https://openalex.org/W1976978300,"Our current knowledge of the composition of the cormetary nucleus is largely inferred from observations of the gas and dust comae that are produced by sublimation of cometary ice when a comet is near the sun. During the past decade, far-ultraviolet spectroscopy from above the terrestrial atmosphere has shed new light on the physics and chemistry of the gaseous component of the coma. The advent of interplanetary missions to Halley's comet in 1986 and the development of a new generation of earth-orbiting observatories promise further insights into the nature of these frozen remnants of the primordial solar system."
https://openalex.org/W1973637015,"The discovery of isotopic anomalies in the calcium- and aluminum-rich inclusions of the Allende meteorite has improved our knowledge of the origin of the solar system. Inability to find more inclusions without destroying the meteorite has hampered further study. By using a fourth-generation computed tomographic scanner with modifications to the software only, the interior of heterogeneous materials such as Allende can be nondestructively probed. The regions of material with high and low atomic numbers are displayed quickly. The object can then be cut to obtain for analysis just the areas of interest."
https://openalex.org/W2085449374,"Fossil fungi belonging to the Meliolaceae and Microthyriaceae were found in Eocene deposits in Tennessee. Germinated spores for each form of fungus were identified. One of the two forms of the genus Meliola, (Meliolaceae) appears to have parasitized the leaf upon which it grew. The vegetative, sexual, and asexual reproductive structures are preserved in a member of the genus Asterina (Microthyriaceae). The discovery of these fungi indicates that Western Tennessee was warm and humid during the Eocene."
https://openalex.org/W1987309251,"In 1963, the source of the Equatorial Undercurrent appeared to be near 38 degrees W. This undercurrent was an equatorial extension of a narrow saline current setting east-southeast at the surface near 2 degrees N 42 degrees W. Near 380 degrees W, a retroverse branch of the Guiana Current also joined the Equatorial Undercurrent. Surface flow was easterly along all of the east-southeast current and the undercurrent observed. The subsurface-velocity maximum of the undercurrent was higher at 35 degrees W than at 38 degrees W."
https://openalex.org/W1985234896,"The cosmic-ray exposure age of the Farmington meteorite was found to be greater than 7000 years from the ratio of the carbon-14 and argon-39 present and less than 25,000 years from the ratio of the aluminum-26 and argon-39 present. This exposure age is about an order of magnitude smaller than was estimated previously."
https://openalex.org/W1981754377,"Technology now being introduced in industry, buildings, and transportation is much more energy-efficient than today's average technology. Changes in production and consumption are tending to decrease the intensity of energy use. By applying available economic technology, it may be possible to reduce energy use in Sweden from the present 1400 petajoules per year to about 900 petajoules per year soon after the turn of the century, even with a 50 percent increase in the consumption of goods and services. Technology now being developed could reduce energy demand even further."
https://openalex.org/W1983285059,"Beryllium, subjected to a pressure of 93 kb at 25 degrees C undergoes a change in structure, as indicated by a 45-percent decrease in resistance. At 55 kb a small change in the resistance-pressure relationship suggests another modification of the usual hexagonal-close-packed structure."
https://openalex.org/W2081180448,"Most rocks, minerals, and sands show strong infrared reflection bands. In the atmospheric window (8 to 12 Î¼), quartz and feldspar show an emissivity near 0.8, calcite near 1.0. These laboratory data are confirmed from observations during a Tiros flight over the Libyan desert. The Mediterranean Sea was used for calibration. Desert emissivity is between 0.7 and 0.9."
https://openalex.org/W2045179137,"The reversible decrease in the apparent intensity of the main red absorption band of chlorophyll a at 680 mnu upon strong illumination of Chlorella cells, described by Coleman and Rabinowitch in 1957, is shown, by a polarization method, to be due to an increase in the fluorescence yield. True absorption changes are observed at 657 mnu (positive) and 648 mnu (negative)."
