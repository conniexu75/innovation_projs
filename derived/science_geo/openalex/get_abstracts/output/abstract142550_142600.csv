https://openalex.org/W2056051089,"A laser cavity formed from a single defect in a two-dimensional photonic crystal is demonstrated. The optical microcavity consists of a half wavelength–thick waveguide for vertical confinement and a two-dimensional photonic crystal mirror for lateral localization. A defect in the photonic crystal is introduced to trap photons inside a volume of 2.5 cubic half-wavelengths, approximately 0.03 cubic micrometers. The laser is fabricated in the indium gallium arsenic phosphide material system, and optical gain is provided by strained quantum wells designed for a peak emission wavelength of 1.55 micrometers at room temperature. Pulsed lasing action has been observed at a wavelength of 1.5 micrometers from optically pumped devices with a substrate temperature of 143 kelvin."

Purified IPCs are here shown to be the CD4 + CD11c − type 2 dendritic cell precursors (pDC2s), which produce 200 to 1000 times more IFN than other blood cells after microbial challenge. pDC2s are thus an effector cell type of the immune system, critical for antiviral and antitumor immune responses."

https://openalex.org/W3103629061,"Recent evidence suggests that physiological signals under healthy conditions may have a fractal temporal structure. We investigate the possibility that time series generated by certain physiological control systems may be members of a special class of complex processes, termed multifractal, which require a large number of exponents to characterize their scaling properties. We report on evidence for multifractality in a biological dynamical system --- the healthy human heartbeat. Further, we show that the multifractal character and nonlinear properties of the healthy heart rate are encoded in the Fourier phases. We uncover a loss of multifractality for a life-threatening condition, congestive heart failure."
https://openalex.org/W2132971431,"To monitor changes in α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate (AMPA) receptor distribution in living neurons, the AMPA receptor subunit GluR1 was tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP). This protein (GluR1-GFP) was functional and was transiently expressed in hippocampal CA1 neurons. In dendrites visualized with two-photon laser scanning microscopy or electron microscopy, most of the GluR1-GFP was intracellular, mimicking endogenous GluR1 distribution. Tetanic synaptic stimulation induced a rapid delivery of tagged receptors into dendritic spines as well as clusters in dendrites. These postsynaptic trafficking events required synaptic N -methyl- d -aspartate (NMDA) receptor activation and may contribute to the enhanced AMPA receptor–mediated transmission observed during long-term potentiation and activity-dependent synaptic maturation."
https://openalex.org/W2013935392,"The mammalian inner ear contains the cochlea and vestibular organs, which are responsible for hearing and balance, respectively. The epithelia of these sensory organs contain hair cells that function as mechanoreceptors to transduce sound and head motion. The molecular mechanisms underlying hair cell development and differentiation are poorly understood. Math1 , a mouse homolog of the Drosophila proneural gene atonal , is expressed in inner ear sensory epithelia. Embryonic Math1 -null mice failed to generate cochlear and vestibular hair cells. This gene is thus required for the genesis of hair cells."

The forest fire dynamics in two regions of the eastern Amazon were studied. Accidental fires have affected nearly 50 percent of the remaining forests and have caused more deforestation than has intentional clearing in recent years. Forest fires create positive feedbacks in future fire susceptibility, fuel loading, and fire intensity. Unless current land use and fire use practices are changed, fire has the potential to transform large areas of tropical forest into scrub or savanna."
https://openalex.org/W1993385893,"The efficiency with which N -methyl- d -aspartate receptors (NMDARs) trigger intracellular signaling pathways governs neuronal plasticity, development, senescence, and disease. In cultured cortical neurons, suppressing the expression of the NMDAR scaffolding protein PSD-95 (postsynaptic density–95) selectively attenuated excitotoxicity triggered via NMDARs, but not by other glutamate or calcium ion (Ca 2+ ) channels. NMDAR function was unaffected, because receptor expression, NMDA currents, and 45 Ca 2+ loading were unchanged. Suppressing PSD-95 blocked Ca 2+ -activated nitric oxide production by NMDARs selectively, without affecting neuronal nitric oxide synthase expression or function. Thus, PSD-95 is required for efficient coupling of NMDAR activity to nitric oxide toxicity, and imparts specificity to excitotoxic Ca 2+ signaling."

https://openalex.org/W2130784302,"Gene-targeted mice lacking the l -α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionate (AMPA) receptor subunit GluR-A exhibited normal development, life expectancy, and fine structure of neuronal dendrites and synapses. In hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons, GluR-A −/− mice showed a reduction in functional AMPA receptors, with the remaining receptors preferentially targeted to synapses. Thus, the CA1 soma-patch currents were strongly reduced, but glutamatergic synaptic currents were unaltered; and evoked dendritic and spinous Ca 2+ transients, Ca 2+ -dependent gene activation, and hippocampal field potentials were as in the wild type. In adult GluR-A −/− mice, associative long-term potentiation (LTP) was absent in CA3 to CA1 synapses, but spatial learning in the water maze was not impaired. The results suggest that CA1 hippocampal LTP is controlled by the number or subunit composition of AMPA receptors and show a dichotomy between LTP in CA1 and acquisition of spatial memory."
https://openalex.org/W2019177912,"Vegetation in many semiarid regions is strikingly patterned, forming regular stripes on hillsides and irregular mosaics on flat ground. A simple model of plant and water dynamics based on ecologically realistic assumptions and with reasonable parameter values captures both of these types of patterns. The regular patterns result from a Turing-like instability; the irregular patterns arise when the ecological dynamics amplify slight small-scale topographic variability. Because of the close agreement between observations and these theoretical results, this system provides a clear example of how nonlinear mechanisms can be important in determining the spatial structure of plant communities."
https://openalex.org/W1984998883,"The breast cancer susceptibility gene BRCA1 encodes a protein implicated in the cellular response to DNA damage, with postulated roles in homologous recombination as well as transcriptional regulation. To identify downstream target genes, we established cell lines with tightly regulated inducible expression of BRCA1. High-density oligonucleotide arrays were used to analyze gene expression profiles at various times following BRCA1 induction. A major BRCA1 target is the DNA damage–responsive gene GADD45. Induction of BRCA1 triggers apoptosis through activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase (JNK/SAPK), a signaling pathway potentially linked to GADD45 gene family members. The p53-independent induction of GADD45 by BRCA1 and its activation of JNK/SAPK suggest a pathway for BRCA1-induced apoptosis."

https://openalex.org/W2049310294,"Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is an important pro-inflammatory mediator with the unique ability to counter-regulate the inhibitory effects of glucocorticoids on immune cell activation. MIF is released from cells in response to glucocorticoids, certain pro-inflammatory stimuli, and mitogens and acts to regulate glucocorticoid action on the ensuing inflammatory response. To gain insight into the molecular mechanism of MIF action, we have examined the role of MIF in the proliferation and intracellular signaling events of the well characterized, NIH/3T3 fibroblast cell line. Both endogenously secreted and exogenously added MIFs stimulate the proliferation of NIH/3T3 cells, and this response is associated with the activation of the p44/p42 extracellular signal-regulated (ERK) mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAP). The MIF-induced activation of these kinases was sustained for a period of at least 24 h and was dependent upon protein kinase A activity. We further show that MIF regulates cytosolic phospholipase A2 activity via a protein kinase A and ERK dependent pathway and that the glucocorticoid suppression of cytokine-induced cytoplasmic phospholipase A2 activity and arachidonic acid release can be reversed by the addition of recombinant MIF. These studies indicate that the sustained activation of p44/p42 MAP kinase and subsequent arachidonate release by cytoplasmic phospholipase A2 are important features of the immunoregulatory and intracellular signaling events initiated by MIF and provide the first insight into the mechanisms that underlie the pro-proliferative and inflammatory properties of this mediator.

Monocytes and macrophages, which had originally been considered to be the target of MIF action, were identified to release MIF in response to various pro-inflammatory stimuli and to be a significant source of MIF release in vivo (7Calandra T. Bernhagen J. Mitchell R.A. Bucala R. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1895-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). MIF also is a required stimulus for T-cell activation and antibody production by B cells (8Bacher M. Metz C.N. Calandra T. Mayer K. Chesney J. Lohoff M. Gemsa D. Donnelly T. Bucala R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7849-7854Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). In more recent studies, immune cells have been identified to secrete MIF in response to physiological increases in glucocorticoid levels, and once released, MIF can “override” the immunosuppressive effects of steroids on cytokine production and cellular activation (8Bacher M. Metz C.N. Calandra T. Mayer K. Chesney J. Lohoff M. Gemsa D. Donnelly T. Bucala R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7849-7854Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar, 9Calandra T.

MIF normally circulates at levels that have glucocorticoid regulatory properties in vitro, leading to the concept that the base-line state of immune cell responsiveness is mutually regulated by an active MIF/glucocorticoid dyad (9Calandra T.

Nathans D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3919-3929Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) prompted us to examine more closely the role of MIF in the signaling pathways associated with cell proliferation. The cell surface receptor for MIF has not yet been identified and we reasoned that information concerning MIF-mediated signaling could provide insight into the intracellular pathways underlying the action of MIF. We describe herein the role of MIF in the proliferation and cell signaling events of the well characterized fibroblast cell line, NIH/3T3. We show that the sustained activation of p44/p42 MAP kinase and the release of arachidonic acid by cytoplasmic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) are important features of MIF stimulation, and we present data on potential mechanisms for the pro-proliferative and glucocorticoid regulatory properties of this mediator. NIH/3T3 fibroblasts (1 × 105 cells/ml) were cultured until semi-confluent in 96-well plates containing DMEM and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. The cells then were synchronized by overnight culture in 0.5% serum-containing media (DMEM). The medium was replaced with 0.5% serum-containing DMEM supplemented with purified, mouse recombinant MIF (rMIF) (14Bendrat K. Al-Abed Y. Callaway D.J. Peng T. Calandra T. Metz C.N. Bucala R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15356-15362Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) (<200 pg endotoxin/mg of protein) or 10% serum-containing DMEM together with a neutralizing anti-murine MIF mAb (14.15.5, IgG1 subclass) (9Calandra T.

The 14.15.5 mAb has been shown previously to neutralize both endogenously released (native) MIF and rMIF in a variety of in vitro and in vivo studies (3Mikulowska A. Metz C.N. Bucala R. Holmdahl R.

Nature. 1995; 377: 68-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). In separate experiments, this anti-MIF mAb also was determined not to recognize bovine MIF that is present in trace quantities in fetal bovine serum. [3H]Thymidine (5 μCi/ml, NEN Life Science Products) was added to each well, and the cells were allowed to proliferate for 16 h. The cells then were harvested, and the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into DNA was quantified by liquid scintillation counting (Packard Instrument Co.). The antisense MIF studies followed methods developed previously (15Waeber G. Calandra T. Roduit R. Haefliger J.-A. Bonny C. Thompson N. Thorens B. Temler E. Meinhardt A. Bacher M. Metz C.N. Nicod P.

In brief, the pREP9 episomal plasmid (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was used to clone an MIF polymerase chain reaction product spanning the open reading frame of murine MIF. Transfection was performed following a standard procedure (Life Technologies, Inc.), 2lifetech.com/cgi-online/techonline. and transfectants were selected for and maintained with 600 μg/ml Geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cell supernatants were assayed directly for MIF content by a sandwich ELISA employing a rabbit polyclonal antiserum and a mouse monoclonal IgG1 raised to purified, mouse rMIF (9Calandra T. Bernhagen J. Metz C.N. Spiegel L.A. Bacher M. Donnelly T. Cerami A. Bucala R. Nature. 1995; 377: 68-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). Briefly, 96-well microtiter plates (Dynatech, Type II) were coated with the anti-mouse MIF mAb (5 μg/ml in PBS), washed, and blocked with Superblock (Pierce) containing 2% goat serum (Sigma). Sixty-μl aliquots of each sample were added to wells for 30 min at 25 °C, and the incubation was then continued overnight at 4 °C. The wells were washed and incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-MIF serum (1:250) (9Calandra T. Bernhagen J. Metz C.N. Spiegel L.A. Bacher M. Donnelly T. Cerami A. Bucala R. Nature. 1995; 377: 68-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar) for 2 h at 25 °C. This was followed by the addition of a goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and the antibody complexes were quantified after the addition of the alkaline phosphatase substrate,p-nitrophenyl phosphate. The MIF concentrations were calculated by extrapolation from a sigmoidal quadratic standard curve using mouse rMIF (range, 0–500 ng/ml; sensitivity, 150 pg/ml). Thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages were obtained from C3H/HeN and C3H/HeJ mice that were injected 3–4 days previously with 2 ml of sterile 3% thioglycollate broth. Cells were harvested under strict aseptic conditions by lavage of peritoneal cavities with 5 ml of an ice-chilled 11.6% sucrose solution. After centrifugation and washing with sterile PBS, cells were resuspended in RPMI, 10% fetal bovine serum, enumerated, and plated at a density of 2 × 106 cells/well. 2 h post-plating, cells were thoroughly washed and treated accordingly. Macrophage and NIH/3T3 whole cell extracts were prepared from 1 × 106 adherent cells. Cells first were washed in cold PBS and then 250 μl of ice-cold radioimmune precipitation buffer (containing 1 mm NaVO4, 2 mm NaF, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)) were added. The cells were disrupted by repeated aspiration through a 21-gauge needle. After incubation on ice for 10 min and microcentrifugation at 3000 rpm for 15 min (4 °C), the supernatants were removed, the protein concentration was determined, and the lysates were stored at −80 °C. Equal amounts of cellular proteins were fractionated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels (Bio-Rad) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Immunoblotting with antibodies directed against either 85-kDa cPLA2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), phospho-p44/p42, total p44/42, or Elk-1 was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). The secondary antibodies were an anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (or anti-mouse-HRP for cPLA2 mAb), and detection was by chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Densitometric analyses of Western blots was performed using the NIH Image software package. The films were scanned, and relative intensities were quantified by comparison to known quantities of electrophoresed standards. In selected experiments, 5 and 25 μm forskolin (16Galli C. Meucci O. Scorziello A. Werge T.M. Calissano P. Schettini G. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 1172-1179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Calbiochem) was added to the cells at the same time as the neutralizing MIF monoclonal antibody. Whole cell extracts were prepared from 2 × 106 cells as described above. The p44/p42 MAP kinase assay was performed according to the manufacturer's directions (New England Biolabs). Briefly, equal amounts of lysate (200 μg in ∼200 μl) were incubated with 15 μl of an immobilized anti-phospho-p44/p42 MAP kinase mAb, and the samples were allowed to rotate overnight at 4 °C. The pellet was collected by centrifugation and washed with 500 μl of radioimmune precipitation buffer followed by 3 washes with 1× kinase buffer. The pellet then was resuspended in 50 μl of 1× kinase buffer supplemented with 200 μm ATP and 2 μg of Elk-1 fusion protein (New England Biolabs). After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, the reaction was terminated by adding 25 μl of 3× Laemmli sample buffer. Thirty μl of each sample was electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The blot was then probed for phospho-Elk-1 protein by utilizing an anti-phospho-Elk-1 antibody. 2 × 106 cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and collected into homogenization buffer consisting of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmEGTA, 5 mm CaCl2, and protease inhibitors. The cells then were disrupted by sonication and microcentrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min (4 °C). For each sample, 25 μg of total protein was added to the assay buffer (0.1 m Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm CaCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors) followed by 2 nmol of [arachidonoyl-14C]phosphatidylcholine. The reaction was performed at 37 °C for 60 min in a total volume of 200 μl. The reactions were terminated by adding 400 μl of chloroform/methanol (2:1) and 2 μl of glacial acetic acid. The lower phase was chromatographed on TLC plates (Whatman) with chloroform/methanol/water (65:25:4, by vol) as the solvent system. The spot corresponding to free fatty acid was quantified by densitometric analysis with a phosphoimager (Packard Instruments) and comparison to [14C]arachidonic acid standards. The NIH/3T3 or the TNF-sensitive L929 mouse fibroblast cell lines (17Jayadev S. Hayter H.L. Andrieu N. Gamard C.J. Liu B. Balu R. Hayakawa M. Ito F. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol.

Medium then was changed to 0.5% serum-supplemented DMEM containing 1 μm[14C]arachidonic acid (NEN Life Science Products). After overnight culture, the cells were washed extensively with PBS, and then the appropriate samples were added in duplicate. At the indicated times, the supernatants were removed and cleared by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min, and the radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting.

Calcium mobilization was measured by fluorescence spectroscopy of the Ca2+-sensitive dye, Fura 2-AM (Calbiochem).

The appropriate wells were preincubated for 1 h with 10−6m dexamethasone (Sigma) before the addition of the indicated amounts of mouse recombinant TNFα (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) and mouse rMIF. We examined the role of MIF in cell proliferation by first investigating the effect of rMIF in the well characterized NIH/3T3 cell system. As shown in Fig.1 A, purified, mouse rMIF was found to stimulate the proliferation of quiescent NIH/3T3 fibroblasts in a dose-dependent manner. At a concentration of 50 ng/ml, exogenously added MIF stimulated thymidine incorporation by >50% when compared with unstimulated cells. MIF protein exists pre-formed in several cell types, and prior studies have indicated that endogenously released MIF can act to stimulate cellular responses in an autocrine fashion (8Bacher M. Metz C.N. Calandra T. Mayer K. Chesney J. Lohoff M. Gemsa D. Donnelly T. Bucala R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7849-7854Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar, 9Calandra T.

Serum supplementation is known to induce the proliferation of quiescent cell populations (11Lang R.A. Burgess A.W. Immunol. Today. 1990; 11: 244-249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), and we observed that the addition of 10% serum to NIH/3T3 cultures caused the release of immunoreactive MIF protein into culture supernatants in as little as 30 min (Fig. 1 B). The addition of a neutralizing monoclonal anti-MIF antibody inhibited by 40% the proliferative effect of serum addition to quiescent fibroblasts, indicating that the release of endogenous MIF contributes significantly to the mitogenic effect of serum stimulation (Fig. 1 C). Of note, cells treated with the neutralizing anti-MIF antibody appeared normal morphologically, and viability testing by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide showed no increase in cell death when compared with cells treated with an isotype control antibody (data not shown). Recent data indicates that MIF is expressed in higher concentrations in transformed cell lines when compared with primary cells (7Calandra T. Bernhagen J. Mitchell R.A. Bucala R. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1895-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar, 23Takahashi N. Nishihira J. Sato Y. Kondo M. Ogawa H. Ohshima T. Une Y. Todo S. Mol. Med. 1998; 4: 707-714Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We determined by ELISA that the amount of intracellular MIF present in resting NIH/3T3 cells was approximately 44 fg MIF/cell. Finally, in accordance with a recent report (23Takahashi N. Nishihira J. Sato Y. Kondo M. Ogawa H. Ohshima T. Une Y. Todo S. Mol. Med. 1998; 4: 707-714Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the transfection of NIH/3T3 cells with an antisense MIF expression plasmid (15Waeber G. Calandra T. Roduit R. Haefliger J.-A. Bonny C. Thompson N. Thorens B. Temler E. Meinhardt A. Bacher M. Metz C.N. Nicod P. Bucala R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4782-4787Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) was found to significantly decrease cell proliferation when compared with cells transfected with control vector (data not shown). One of the most widely studied protein phosphorylation cascades associated with cell proliferation is that of the Ras → Raf → MAP kinase/ERK kinase (MEK) → ERK pathway (24Denhardt D.T. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 729-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). To investigate ERK activation by MIF, quiescent NIH/3T3 cells were treated with rMIF, and the cell lysates were examined for ERK1/2 phosphorylation by Western blot analysis using phospho-specific anti-ERK antibodies. MIF was found to induce the phosphorylation of the p44/p42 ERK MAP kinases in both a time- and a dose-dependent fashion (Fig.2, A and B). ERK phosphorylation was detected as early as 30 min after MIF addition and, notably, was sustained for a period of at least 24 h (Fig. 2,A and D). Immunoneutralization of serum-stimulated cells with anti-MIF mAb resulted in a significant decrease in p44/p42 ERK MAP kinase phosphorylation, consistent with the decrease in proliferation with anti-MIF treatment (Fig. 2 C). We also examined if this sustained stimulation of p44/p42 ERK phosphorylation by rMIF produced an enhancement of p44/p42 ERK enzymatic activity. As shown in Fig. 2 D, cells treated for 24 h with increasing amounts of rMIF showed a dose-dependent increase in ERK enzymatic activity, as detected by the phosphorylation of the MAP kinase substrate, Elk-1, in an in vitro p44/p42 MAP kinase assay. This increase in enzymatic activity was associated with a corresponding increase in the phosphorylation of p44/p42 ERK present in the same cell lysates (Fig.2 D). To investigate if this MIF-mediated regulation of MAP kinase activity was similar in immune cells classically associated with MIF responsiveness, thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages from both endotoxin-sensitive (C3H/HeN) and endotoxin-resistant (C3H/HeJ) cells were stimulated with rMIF for 2 h. Fig. 2 E shows that rMIF induces ERK phosphorylation in macrophages from both mouse strains. The observation that an equivalent response occurs both in the endotoxin-sensitive and endotoxin-resistant macrophages indicates that there was no detectable contribution of trace lipopolysaccharide that may be present in bacterially expressed rMIF. A sustained, ligand-induced activation of MAP kinases has been described in one prior instance, the differentiation of neuronal PC12 cells by nerve growth factor (25Wu Y.Y. Bradshaw R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13023-13032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 26Traverse S. Gomez N. Paterson H. Marshall C. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). It has been shown in this case that a prolonged response is dependent upon the activity of protein kinase A (PKA) (27Yao H. York R.D. Misra-Press A. Carr D.W. Stork P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8240-8247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 28Vossler M.R. Yao H. York R.D. Pan M.G. Rim C.S. Stork P.J. Cell. 1997; 89: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar). To investigate a role for PKA in MIF-stimulated ERK activation, we tested the ability of MIF to induce p44/p42 MAP kinase activation in the presence of the specific PKA inhibitor, H-89 (19Chijiwa T. Mishima A. Hagiwara M. Sano M. Hayashi K. Inoue T. Naito K. Toshioka T. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5267-5272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.3 A, H-89-treated cells were resistant to MIF-stimulated ERK activation, and the base-line level of ERK2 phosphorylation decreased at 2 h. A similar level of MIF unresponsiveness was observed upon the addition to cultures of the cell-permeable PKA inhibitor,14–22 (29Eichholtz T. de Bont D.B. de Widt J. Liskamp R.M. Ploegh H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1982-1986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (not shown). Conversely, we saw no effect on the MIF-induced phosphorylation of ERK in NIH/3T3 cells treated with either the protein kinase C or the phospholipase C inhibitors (R0–31-8220 and U-73122, respectively) (30Davis P.D.

The addition of forskolin, an adenylate cyclase activator (16Galli C. Meucci O. Scorziello A. Werge T.M. Calissano P. Schettini G. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 1172-1179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), also was found to reverse the inhibitory effects of anti-MIF on serum-induced ERK phosphorylation, further suggesting that MIF is acting by a PKA-dependent pathway (Fig. 3 B). The ERK pathway of activation results in the phosphorylation and activation of a number of cytosolic proteins. Among the best characterized substrates for the ERKs are P90 rsk, c-myc, and cPLA2(24Denhardt D.T. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 729-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). cPLA2 is a critical component of the pro-inflammatory cascade (18Hayakawa M. Ishida N. Takeuchi K. Shibamoto S. Hori T. Oku N.

Chem. 1993; 268: 11290-11295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and its product, arachidonic acid, is a precursor for the synthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Arachidonic acid also is known to activate the c-jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase pathway, which is also required for the translation of TNF mRNA (32Cui X.L. Douglas J.G. Proc.

We demonstrate that BiP (Kar2p), a member of the Hsp70 family resident in the ER lumen, acts as a molecular ratchet during translocation of the secretory protein prepro-α factor through the channel formed by the Sec complex. Multiple BiP molecules associate with each translocation substrate following interaction with the J domain of the Sec63p component of the Sec complex. Bound BiP minimizes passive backward movements of the substrate through the channel, and BiP’s subsequent dissociation results in a free polypeptide in the ER lumen. Antibodies against the substrate can replace BiP, indicating that a Brownian ratchet is sufficient to achieve translocation."
https://openalex.org/W1984868512,"California shrubland wildfires are increasingly destructive, and it is widely held that the problem has been intensified by fire suppression, leading to larger, more intense wildfires. However, analysis of the California Statewide Fire History Database shows that, since 1910, fire frequency and area burned have not declined, and fire size has not increased. Fire rotation intervals have declined, and fire season has not changed, implying that fire intensity has not increased. Fire frequency and population density were correlated, and it is suggested that fire suppression plays a critical role in offsetting potential impacts of increased ignitions. Large fires were not dependent on old age classes of fuels, and it is thus unlikely that age class manipulation of fuels can prevent large fires. Expansion of the urban-wildland interface is a key factor in wildland fire destruction."

Unexpectedly, this program includes a DNA binding–independent function of Pit1, suppressing the ventral GATA2-dependent gonadotrope program by inhibiting GATA2 binding to gonadotrope- but not thyrotrope-specific genes, indicating that both DNA binding–dependent and –independent actions of abundant determining factors contribute to generate distinct cell phenotypes."

Intragenic suppressors of a mutant mtHsp70 separate two functions: a nonlethal folding defect caused by enhanced trapping of preproteins, and a conditionally lethal unfolding defect caused by an impaired interaction of mtHsp70 with the membrane anchor Tim44. Even enhanced trapping in wild-type mitochondria does not generate a pulling force. The motor function of mtHsp70 cannot be explained by passive trapping alone but includes an essential ATP-dependent interaction with Tim44 to generate a pulling force and unfold preproteins."
https://openalex.org/W2081253307,"beta-Catenin, a member of the family of Armadillo repeat proteins, plays a dual role in cadherin-mediated cell adhesion and in signaling by Wnt growth factors. Upon Wnt stimulation beta-catenin undergoes nuclear translocation and serves as transcriptional coactivator of T cell factor DNA-binding proteins. Previously the transactivation potential of different portions of beta-catenin has been demonstrated, but the precise location of transactivating elements has not been established. Also, the mechanism of transactivation by beta-catenin and the molecular basis for functional differences between beta-catenin and the closely related proteins Armadillo and Plakoglobin are poorly understood. Here we have used a yeast system for the detailed characterization of the transactivation properties of beta-catenin. We show that its transactivation domains possess a modular structure, consist of multiple subelements that cover broad regions at its N and C termini, and extend considerably into the Armadillo repeat region. Compared with beta-catenin the N termini of Plakoglobin and Armadillo have different transactivation capacities that may explain their distinct signaling properties. Furthermore, transactivating elements of beta-catenin interact specifically and directly with the TATA-binding protein in vitro providing further evidence that a major function of beta-catenin during Wnt signaling is to recruit the basal transcription machinery to promoter regions of Wnt target genes."

To determine whether IRS-3, a recently cloned member of the IRS family, is also involved in the regulation of these, we have generated mice with a targeted disruption of the IRS-3 gene and characterized them. Compared with wild-type mice, the IRS-3-null mice showed normal body weight throughout development, normal blood glucose levels in the fed and fasted state and following an oral glucose bolus, and normal fed and fasted plasma insulin levels. IRS-3 is most abundant in adipocytes and is tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to insulin in these cells. Therefore, isolated adipocytes were analyzed for changes in insulin effects. Insulin-stimulated glucose transport in the adipocytes from the IRS-3-null mice was the same as in wild-type cells. The extent of tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1/2 following insulin stimulation was similar in adipocytes fromIRS-3-null and wild-type mice, and the insulin-induced association of tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1/2 with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and SHP-2 was not detectably increased by IRS-3 deficiency. Thus, IRS-3 was not essential for normal growth, glucose homeostasis, and glucose transport in adipocytes, and in its absence no significant compensatory augmentation of insulin signaling through IRS-1/2 was evident. The insulin receptor substrates (IRS) 1 and 2 are required for normal growth and glucose homeostasis in mice.

Rec. Prog. Hormone Res. 1998; 53: 119-138PubMed Google Scholar). They are the major intracellular targets for phosphorylation by the activated insulin receptor tyrosine kinase. In addition, they are also substrates for the insulin-like growth factor I receptor and for tyrosine kinases associated with the receptors for growth hormone and some interleukins and interferons. Four members of the IRS family (IRS-1, -2, -3, and -4) are now known. Each IRS contains at its N terminus a pleckstrin homology domain and a phosphotyrosine binding domain, both of which are required for efficient phosphorylation by the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase. The large C-terminal portion of each IRS contains many tyrosine phosphorylation sites in motifs that can associate with SH2 domain-containing proteins, notably PI 3-kinase, the adaptor protein Grb-2 (complexed with Sos, the guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Ras), and the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2. The interaction of the tyrosine-phosphorylated IRSs with PI 3-kinase and Grb-2/Sos stimulates their activities, leading to the elevation of PI 3,4,5-trisphosphate and the GTP form of Ras. These in turn activate protein kinase cascades, resulting in the well established cellular effects of insulin, including the stimulation of glucose transport, glycogen synthesis, and protein synthesis and alterations in gene transcription (reviewed in Refs. 1White M.F. Rec. Prog. Hormone Res. 1998; 53: 119-138PubMed Google Scholar and 2Shepherd P.R. Withers D.J. Siddle K. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 471-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar). The occurrence of four members of the IRS family raises the question of the physiological roles of each. Targeted disruption of theIRS genes provides an approach to address this question. To date mice lacking IRS-1 and IRS-2 have been described. Mice deficient in IRS-1 are growth-retarded and moderately insulin-resistant (3Tamemoto H. Kadowaki T. Tobe K. Yagi T. Sakura H. Hayakawa T. Terauchi Y. Ueki K. Kaburagi Y. Satoh S. Sekihara H. Yoshioka S. Horikoshi H. Furuta Y. Ikawa Y. Kasuga M. Yazaki Y. Aizawa S.

Nature. 1994; 372: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (1095) Google Scholar). Mice lacking IRS-2 develop diabetes early in life due to severe insulin resistance combined with a failure of the pancreatic β cells to proliferate (5Withers D.J. Sanchez Gutierrez J. Towery H.

From these phenotypes it can be concluded that IRS-1 and 2 play important roles in the regulation of growth and glucose homeostasis. We recently purified and cloned IRS-3 (6Lavan B.E. Lane W.S. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11439-11443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). To determine the physiological role of IRS-3, we have now generated mice with targeted disruption of the IRS-3 gene. We report here thatIRS-3-null mice do not exhibit abnormalities in growth or glucose homeostasis. In adipocytes IRS-3 is a prominent insulin-elicited Tyr(P) protein that associates with PI 3-kinase and SHP-2, and weakly with Grb-2 (7Ross S.A. Lienhard G.E. Lavan B.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 487-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Consequently, we examined insulin effects in adipocytes from the IRS-3-null mice. Insulin stimulation of glucose transport was not impaired. Moreover, the absence of IRS-3 did not lead to detectable increases in the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1/2 or their association with PI 3-kinase or SHP-2. Mouse P1 genomic clones containing the IRS-3 gene were isolated for us by Genome Systems Inc, by PCR screening of a P1 library of mouse ES cell genomic DNA (mouse strain 129) with two primers derived from the rat IRS-3 cDNA. The presence of the IRS-3 gene was confirmed by Southern blotting of restriction digests with a probe from the rat cDNA. Subsequently, we subcloned several restriction fragments of the mouse gene encoding IRS-3 into pBluescript and sequenced the coding region. In addition, we sequenced the insert of a plasmid that contains the complete coding cDNA for mouse IRS-3 (expressed sequence tag number 557145 from Genome Systems, Inc). Comparison of the two sequences revealed that the coding region of the mouse IRS-3gene contains only a single small intron of 344 bp near the amino terminus. The identity of the two sequences in the coding region definitely established that the P1 clones contained IRS-3. As we were preparing this information for publication, another group published the same information (8Sciacchitano S. Taylor S.I. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4931-4940Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and so the details are not presented here. In order to construct the targeting vector for disruption of theIRS-3 gene, two overlapping fragments (a 6.0-kbSpeI-SpeI and a 9.3-kbEcoRI-EcoRI fragment; see Fig. 1 A), as well as a larger fragment encompassing these two (16.5-kbEagI-EagI fragment), were subcloned into pBluescriptSK+, and mapped for restriction sites. For the targeting vector, which was assembled in pBluescriptSK+, a 2.9-kbSpeI-EcoRI fragment containing the entire coding region of IRS-3 was replaced in opposite orientation by a 1.8-kb fragment containing the neo gene driven by the phosphoglycerate kinase promoter (PGKneo) and linked to phosphoglycerate kinase polyadenylation sequences (Fig. 1 A). The neo gene was flanked by a 3.5-kbSpeI-SpeI fragment and a 2.5-kbEcoRI-EcoRI fragment derived from theIRS-3 regions 5′ and 3′ to the coding region, respectively. A 2.6-kb thymidine kinase gene under the regulation of the phosphoglycerate kinase promoter was placed at the 3′ end of the targeting vector. The targeting vector was linearized with NotI and electroporated into J1 ES cells. Colonies that were resistant to G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) and gancyclovir (Syntex) were picked and expanded as described (9Li E. Bestor T.H. Jaenisch R. Cell. 1992; 69: 915-926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3235) Google Scholar) and screened for homologous recombination by Southern blotting of EcoRI-digested genomic DNA. Seventeen ES clones out of 177 showed the 8.2-kb fragment characteristic for disruption of IRS-3 as well as the 9.3-kb fragment from the wild-type allele (see Fig. 1 B). Four of these ES clones were injected into blastocysts derived from C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice in the facility directed by Dr. Arlene Sharpe (Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA). One clone yielded highly chimeric male mice, and these were bred with female wild-type C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice to obtain IRS-3 +/− mice. The mice heterozygous for IRS-3 were mated to obtainIRS-3-null mice. These and their wild-type littermates were used in the experiments described in Table I and Figs. 2 and 3. For the other experiments, wild-type and IRS-3-null mice were obtained by breeding the IRS-3 +/+ andIRS-3 −/− offspring of the heterozygous breeding pairs, respectively. Unless otherwise stated, experiments were carried out on mice of the 129 × C57BL/6 background.

For PCR analysis, the sense and antisense primers for the IRS-3 gene corresponded to nucleotides 1559–1581 and 2017–2039, respectively, in the coding region of IRS-3 (Fig. 1 of Ref. 8Sciacchitano S. Taylor S.I. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4931-4940Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and were expected to yield a product of 481 bp. The sense and antisense primers for theneo gene were 5′-AGG ATC TCG TCG TGA CCC ATG-3′ and 5′-AAG GCG ATA GAA GGC GAT GC-3′, respectively, and were expected to yield a 233-bp product. As shown in Fig. 1C, PCR analysis yielded the fragments of the predicted sizes. Results from both methods of genotyping agreed. Blood samples were collected from the tails cut at the tip of either randomly fed or fasted mice. For the former, samples were taken between 7 and 8 a.m.; for the latter, mice were fasted from 5 p.m. to 9 a.m., and then samples taken. Blood glucose was measured with the Precision·G blood glucose testing system (Medisense). For measurement of plasma insulin, heparinized (10 units/ml) blood samples were spun at 8000 rpm in a microcentrifuge for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant plasma was used in an insulin radioimmune assay (Linco Research Inc., catalog numbers RI and SRI 13K). For the glucose tolerance test, mice were fasted from 5 p.m. to 9 a.m., and then an oral glucose bolus of 1 g ofd-glucose/kg of body weight as a solution of 0.25 g/ml was introduced with a feeding needle. Glucose levels were determined in blood drops obtained from the tail vein immediately before and at 10, 20, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min after the administration of glucose. Epididymal or parametrial fat pads were removed from male or female 12–16-week-old mice sacrificed with CO2. Adipocytes were isolated by collagenase digestion of fat pads (10Weber T.M. Joost H.G. Simpson I.A. Cushman S.W. Kahn R.C. Harrison L.C. Receptor Biochemistry and Methodology: The Insulin Receptor. Alan R. Liss, Inc., New York1988: 171-187Google Scholar), as follows. Fat pads were added to collagenase (type I from Worthington Biochemical Corp.) (1 mg/ml, 2 mg/g of tissue) that was dissolved in KRH-BSA (120 mm NaCl, 4.8 mm KCl, 1.3 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mmKH2PO4, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 20 mm HEPES, 2.5% BSA, 200 nm adenosine, pH 7.4). The fat pads in the collagenase solution were minced with scissors and incubated in a 37 °C shaking water bath (100 rpm) for 1 h. The adipocytes were filtered from debris through 0.4-mm Nitex nylon mesh (Tetko) and then washed by flotation with KRH-BSA. Glucose transport was assayed by the uptake of [U-14C]d-glucose after the method described in (11Houseknecht K.L. Zhu A.X. Gnudi L. Hamann A. Zierath J.R. Tozzo E. Flier J.S. Kahn B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11347-11355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), as follows. The loosely packed cells in KRH-BSA were diluted 10-fold to give an approximate 5% cell suspension. Aliquots of the cell suspension (100 μl) were added to 350 μl of KRH-BSA containing insulin (Humulin R, Lilly Corp.) at the stated concentrations and incubated in a 37 °C shaking water bath (80 rpm) for 30 min. To each tube 50 μl of 40 μm[U-14C]d-glucose (ICN) in KRH-BSA (0.6 μCi/aliquot) was added, and the incubation continued for another 30 min. Glucose uptake was terminated by separating the medium from the cells in a 200-μl aliquot from each assay tube by centrifugation through 200 μl of dinonyl phthalate. The cell-associated radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. Nonspecific association of radioactive glucose with cells was assessed by performing the assay in the presence of 15 μmcytochalasin B. For each condition the measurements were done in quadruplicate. Measurements of adipocyte number, lipid content, and relative GLUT4 content were also made with aliquots of the adipocyte preparations used for the transport assays. For determination of the cell number, adipocytes were fixed with osmium tetroxide and counted in a Coulter counter, as described in (12Cushman S.W. Salans L.B. J. Lipid Res. 1978; 19: 269-273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the determination of the lipid content, total lipids were extracted and weighed, according to Ref. 13Dole V.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1956; 19: 269-273Google Scholar, as follows. A 200-μl aliquot of the 5% cell suspension was mixed with 2.7 ml of 40:10:1 isopropanol/heptane/1 nH2SO4, followed by the addition of 1.8 ml of heptane and 1.0 ml of water. The mixture was vortexed and centrifuged briefly. A 1.0-ml aliquot of the organic layer was evaporated, and the lipid weighed. For the determination of the GLUT4 content, 200 μl of the 5% cell suspension was spun through dinonyl phthalate to remove the medium. The isolated adipocytes were solubilized in 100 μl of SDS sample buffer and immunoblotted with antibodies against the C-terminal peptide of GLUT4 (14Calderhead D.M. Kitagawa K. Tanner L.I. Holman G.D. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13801-13808Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) at 5 μg/ml, as described below. These three analyses were performed in quadruplicate. Adipocytes were isolated as described above, except that the buffer was KRBH-BSA (120 mm NaCl, 4 mm KH2PO4, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm NaHCO3, 30 mm HEPES, 1% BSA, 3 mmd-glucose, and 200 nmadenosine, pH 7.4). The cells were washed with KRBH to remove the albumin, diluted in KRBH to give an approximately 10% cell suspension, and then treated with or without 500 nm insulin (Humulin R) for 5 min at 37 °C. Adipocytes were centrifuged at 80 ×g for 1 min to obtain a packed cell suspension. The infranatant was removed, and the cells were lysed in the following buffers (approximately 2 ml/ml of packed cells) to yield a final protein concentration of 1–2 mg/ml. When samples were used directly for SDS-gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting, the lysis buffer contained 1% SDS, 20 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mmEDTA, 40 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, with phosphatase inhibitors (10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm Na3VO4) and protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μmleupeptin, 10 μm EP475, 1 μm pepstatin A). Samples were held at 100 °C for 5 min, and the DNA was sheared with a 23-gauge needle. When samples were used for immunoprecipitation, the SDS in the above lysis buffer was replaced with 1% nonaethylene glycol dodecyl ether (Thesit, Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and dithiothreitol was omitted. The lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until use for immunoprecipitation as described below. Protein concentration was measured by a precipitating Lowry assay (15Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7134) Google Scholar). Antibodies against the 85-kDa subunit of PI 3-kinase (catalog number 06-195), IRS-1 (06-248), IRS-2 (06-506), and Tyr(P) (monoclonal 4G10) were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Antibodies against SHP-2 (catalog number sc-280) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and one against Tyr(P) coupled to horseradish peroxidase (RC20:HRPO) was from Transduction Laboratories. Adipocyte lysates (250 μg) at 1 mg/ml were incubated on ice for 2 h with antibodies against PI 3-kinase (2 μl antisera) or SHP-2 (5 μg) or as a control with irrelevant rabbit immunoglobulin (5 μg). Immune complexes were collected onto 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose for 2 h. Beads were washed twice with the Thesit-containing lysis buffer. The immunoprecipitated proteins were solubilized by holding the beads at 100 °C for 5 min in 100 μl SDS sample buffer (4% SDS, 20 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 90 mm TrisCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.004% bromphenol blue, 10 mm Na3VO4, pH 6.8, with the same protease inhibitors as in the lysis buffer). Proteins in the SDS samples of the adipocyte lysates or immunoprecitates were separated by gel electrophoresis and transferred to Immobilon P membranes (Millipore) by electroblotting in 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, 20% methanol, 0.01% SDS. The membranes were blocked with 1% BSA in TBS (20 mmTrisCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) for 30 min and then incubated in 0.2% BSA, 0.3% Tween 20, plus TBS for 90 min with antibodies against Tyr(P) (0.5 μg/ml 4G10), IRS-1 (1 μg/ml), IRS-2 (1 μg/ml), SHP-2 (1 μg/ml), or PI 3-kinase (1:1000 dilution of serum). Membranes were washed with 0.3% Tween 20/TBS and incubated with the horseradish peroxidase conjugates of goat anti-mouse (Pierce) or goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (Bio-Rad) for 30 min, and reactive proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (SuperSignal, Pierce). Immunoblotting for Tyr(P) with RC20:HRPO was performed according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Transduction Laboratories). For each experiment, unpaired two-tailed t tests were used to compare the mean values for the wild-type and the IRS-3-null mice. Differences between means were taken to be not significant for p values greater than 0.05. Data displayed in the text are expressed as mean ± S.E. Mice heterozygous for targeted disruption of the IRS-3 gene were obtained by crossing four chimeric male mice with wild-type female mice. From 10IRS-3 +/− breeding pairs, a total of 435 pups with an average litter size of 8 was obtained. The respective ratios ofIRS-3 +/+, IRS-3 +/−, andIRS-3 −/− mice were 19.8:54.2:25.9 for the males and 25.1:47.1:27.8 for the females. Subsequently six breeding pairs of wild-type and of IRS-3-null mice were set up. Within the same period, the former produced 252 mice in 35 litters, while the latter yielded 197 mice in 32 litters; the average litter sizes were 7 and 6, respectively. These breeding data indicate that the lack of IRS-3 does not affect fertility or embryonic viability. To assess the effects of the absence of IRS-3 on growth, groups of wild-type and IRS-3-null mice were weighed at intervals between the ages of 3 and 30 weeks (Fig.2). Within this time period, the growth curves for the wild-type and IRS-3-null female mice overlapped. For the males, the wild-type mice were slightly heavier than their IRS-3-null counterparts at 10–30 weeks, but the difference is not statistically significant. The weights of the major organs of the mice (brain, lung, liver, heart, kidney, spleen, pancreas, quadriceps muscle, thymus, interscapular brown fat, epididymal fat), measured for male mice at 10 months of age, were the same for the wild-type and IRS-3-null mice (data not shown). Moreover, histological examination of these tissues did not reveal any differences in morphology between the wild-type and null mice. Thus, we conclude that IRS-3-null mice show normal growth and development. To determine whether glucose homeostasis was affected by IRS-3 deficiency, the concentrations of blood glucose and plasma insulin in the fed and fasted state were compared between wild-type and IRS-3-null mice. For both male and female mice of 9–13 weeks of age, the genotypes showed no significant difference in the fed and fasted blood glucose levels or in the fed plasma insulin levels (TableI). In the case of the fasted plasma insulin level, the female wild-type and null mice showed no significant difference, but the male IRS-3-null mice showed a level 60% that of the wild-type (p = 0.009). These measurements were repeated on the same groups of male and female mice at 6 months of age, in order to determine whether any effects of IRS-3 deficiency develop with age. For both sexes, there were no significant differences between the wild-type and IRS-3-null mice in any of the four parameters, including the fasted plasma insulin concentration in the males. In order to test whether IRS-3 deficiency had an effect in a different genetic background, the same measurements were carried out on mice with a 129 × BALB/c background. The mice were 6 months of age; for each sex, 6 wild-type and 6 IRS-3-null mice were examined. For both males and females, no significant differences were observed between genotypes for each of the four parameters (data not shown). In conclusion, with the possible exception of insulin in fasted young male mice, levels of blood glucose and plasma insulin in mice were not altered by IRS-3 deficiency. To characterize glucose homeostasis in the absence of IRS-3 further, the blood glucose concentrations at various times after an oral glucose bolus were determined for male and female mice of 10–13 weeks of age (Fig.3). For the males, there was no difference in blood glucose levels between wild-type andIRS-3-null mice. In the case of the females, theIRS-3-null mice showed slightly greater blood glucose levels than the wild-type mice at 10 and 20 min; however, the differences were not statistically significant. In order to determine if IRS-3 deficiency affects glucose tolerance at an older age, glucose tolerance tests were also performed on male and female mice at 6 months of age. For each sex, 5 wild-type and 5 IRS-3-null mice were examined. With both sexes, there was no difference in the response to the oral glucose load (data not shown). Among the 5 older males of each genotype, there was one that had developed obesity (weight greater than 34 g; see Fig. 2); these two mice exhibited higher and more prolonged elevation of the blood glucose level compared with the non-obese mice. The glucose tolerance test was also carried out with 129 × BALB/c mice of 6 months of age. Six wild-type and 6IRS-3-null mice of each sex were examined. For both sexes, no difference between the genotypes was observed (data not shown). Among the 6 older 129 × BALB/c males of each genotype, there was a single obese one. Unlike the obese males on the 129 × C57BL/6 background, these mice did not exhibit an impaired glucose tolerance test. To determine whether the lack of IRS-3 affected glucose transport, adipocytes from wild-type and IRS-3-null mice were compared for their capacity to transport d-glucose. For adipocytes derived from male (epididymal) and female (parametrial) fat depots, the values for basal and maximal insulin-stimulated glucose transport were not significantly different between genotypes, although the average values for insulin-stimulated transport in the IRS-3-null mice were slightly lower (Fig. 4). The values for the transport rate in Fig. 4 are expressed per milligram of lipid. The lipid content per adipocyte was the same for the wild-type andIRS-3-null mice of each sex (Fig. 4, legend). In addition, the amount of the insulin-responsive glucose transporter GLUT4 per mg of lipid, as detected by immunoblotting, was the same for the wild-type and IRS-3-null mice of each sex (data not shown). Finally, the amount of epididymal or parametrial adipose tissue (grams dissected per mouse) was also the same (data not shown). Thus, the transport rates in the wild-type and IRS-3-null adipocytes are also similar when expressed per cell, per GLUT4, or per total adipose tissue. The insulin dose that elicited a half-maximal response (ED50) was determined from three or four independent experiments in which glucose uptake was measured at 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, and 10 nm insulin for epididymal adipocytes and 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, and 10 nm insulin for parametrial adipocytes. The ED50 values were 0.064 ± 0.017, 0.032 ± 0.009, 0.034 ± 0.011, and 0.029 ± 0.011 nm for adipocytes from wild-type and IRS-3-null male, and wild-type and IRS-3-null female mice, respectively. The small differences between EC50 values are not significant. Thus, the lack of IRS-3 in adipocytes had no significant effect on glucose transport, either in terms of the values for basal and maximal insulin-stimulated transport or the dose of insulin eliciting half-maximal stimulation. SDS lysates of basal and insulin-stimulated adipocytes from wild-type andIRS-3-null mice were immunoblotted with antibodies against Tyr(P) (Fig. 5). In adipocytes from wild-type mice insulin stimulated the tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins at 160–190, 90, and 60 kDa. These correspond to IRS-1/2, the β subunit of the insulin receptor, and IRS-3, respectively. Adipocytes from the IRS-3-null mice showed similar insulin-elicited tyrosine phosphorylation, with the exception that the 60-kDa band was absent. The intensities of the Tyr(P) signals from IRS-1/2 and the insulin receptor β subunit were the same for adipocytes from the wild-type and null mice. These results thus confirm the absence of IRS-3 protein in the IRS-3-null mice, and in addition show that the absence of IRS-3 did not result in any detectable compensatory increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1/2 or the insulin receptor. In other experiments we have immunoblotted SDS lysates of basal and insulin-treated adipocytes from wild-type and IRS-3-null mice for Tyr(P) with a different antibody, the monoclonal 4G10, rather than the monoclonal conjugate RC20:HRPO presented in Fig. 5. The results were similar to those shown in Fig. 5, with the exception that the signal from the phosphorylated β subunit of the insulin receptor was relatively more intense and the background in the region of IRS-1/2 was stronger (data not shown). We have also measured the relative amounts of the IRS-1 and IRS-2 proteins by immunoblotting the SDS lysates for these; there was no difference in amounts between wild-type and IRS-3-null adi"

It has remained, however, largely unknown about intracellular signaling pathways for Rac activation because of the lack of a simple and reliable assay to estimate the activation. Here we describe a novel method to detect the GTP-bound, active Rac in cells by pulling it down with the Rac-binding domain of the protein kinase PAK. Experiments using this method reveal that stimulation of human neutrophils with the Gi-coupled receptor agonistsN-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) and leukotriene B4 (LTB4) leads to a rapid and transient increase in the GTP-bound state of Rac2, whereas phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) causes a slow but more sustained activation of Rac2. Pretreatment of cells with pertussis toxin results in defective activation of Rac2 in response to fMLP and LTB4, indicating that coupling of the receptors to Gi plays a crucial role in the activation. Furthermore, the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002 block Rac2 activation elicited by the receptor agonists, but not that by PMA. Thus the Gi-coupled receptors likely mediate Rac2 activation via PI3K, whereas PMA activates Rac2 in a PI3K-independent manner.

The small GTPases Rac1 and Rac2 are members of the Rho subfamily of the Ras-related GTP-binding proteins and serve as a molecular switch cycling between an active GTP-bound and an inactive GDP-bound state (1Hall A.

A major problem in this field has been the lack of the assay to evaluate activation of endogenous Rac. In human neutrophils, Rac is considered to be involved in activation of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase. The oxidase, dormant in resting cells, is activated during phagocytosis of invading microorganisms to produce superoxide, a precursor of microbicidal oxidants, thereby playing an important role in host defense (5Chanock S.J. el Benna J.

In Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B lymphocytes or HL60 leukemic cells, introduction of Rac antisense oligonucleotides or expression of a dominant negative form of Rac2 is shown to partially inhibit superoxide production (22Dorseuil O.

Activation-specific probes for small GTPases have recently been constructed, which allows determination of the activity of endogenous Ras and Rap1 (24Taylor S.J. Shalloway D. Curr.

Using a similar procedure, we have developed here a novel assay to estimate activation of endogenous Rac in cells, by pulling down the GTP-bound, active Rac with the Rac-binding domain (RBD) of the protein kinase PAK2 expressed as a GST fusion. This assay is based on the finding that PAK2-RBD binds to the GTP-bound Rac with a high affinity, whereas the affinity for the GDP-bound protein is undetectably low (28Zhang B. Chernoff J. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8776-8782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Using this method, we show here that Rac2, the predominant isoform in human neutrophils (29Heyworth P.G. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. Curnutte J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30749-30752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is rapidly and transiently converted to the GTP-bound, active state, in response to the Gi-coupled receptor agonists fMLP and LTB4. The activation appears to require PI3K that is known to be stimulated by the Gi signaling in neutrophils (8Bokoch G.M. Blood. 1995; 86: 1649-1660Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,30Stephens L.

On the other hand, PMA induces a slow but more sustained activation of Rac2, which is dependent on PKC but independent of PI3K. fMLP and wortmannin were purchased from Wako Chemical (Osaka, Japan), LTB4 from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI), PMA and pertussis toxin (PTX) from Research Biochemicals International (Natick, MA), and LY294002 and GF109203X from Biomol Research Laboratories (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Other chemicals used were of the highest purity commercially available. We isolated a DNA fragment encoding the Rac-binding domain of human PAK2 (PAK2-RBD; amino acids 66–147) from total RNA of the neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, according to the protocol of the manufacturer (Perkin Elmer). The polymerase chain reaction product was subcloned into pGEX-4T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and subjected to DNA sequencing for the confirmation of precise construction. The GST fusion protein was expressed in E. coli BL21 cells and purified by glutathione-Sepharose-4B (18Sumimoto H. Kage Y. Nunoi H. Sasaki H. Nose T. Fukumaki Y. Ohno M. Minakami S. Takeshige K.

The DNA fragments encoding human Cdc42 and RhoA were obtained by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and cloned into pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The cDNAs for human Rac1 and Rac2 subcloned into pGEX-2T were prepared as described previously (17Mizuki K. Kadomatsu K. Hata K. Ito T. Fan Q.-W. Kage Y. Fukumaki Y. Sakaki Y. Takeshige K. Sumimoto H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 573-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The identities of all the constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. The GST fusion proteins were prepared as described above, followed by cleavage with thrombin, according to the protocol of the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Recombinant Rac1 or Rac2 was incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in 90 μl of a nucleotide-exchange buffer (137 mmNaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 2 mm EDTA, 4.3 mmNa2HPO4, and 1.4 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.0) in the presence of 11 mm GTPγS, GTP, GDP, ATP, CTP, or UTP. The exchange reaction was terminated by the addition of 10 μl of 100 mm MgCl2. The nucleotide-loaded proteins were incubated at 4 °C with GST-PAK2-RBD and glutathione-Sepharose-4B beads in buffer A (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 142.5 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 4 mmEGTA, 4 mm EDTA). After washing the beads three times with buffer A, the samples were subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE, and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Human neutrophils were isolated from fresh venous blood of healthy volunteers by dextran sedimentation, hypotonic lysis, and the Conray/Ficoll method (10Sumimoto H. Takeshige K. Minakami S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 803: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 18Sumimoto H. Kage Y. Nunoi H. Sasaki H. Nose T. Fukumaki Y. Ohno M. Minakami S. Takeshige K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5345-5349Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). More than 98% of the cells were neutrophils in the preparation. The neutrophils (2.8 × 107 cells) in 700 μl of Hepes-buffered saline (HBS; 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 135 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm glucose, 1 mm MgSO4, and 0.6 mmCaCl2) were preincubated in the presence (for stimulation with fMLP or LTB4) or absence (for stimulation with PMA) of cytochalasin B (5 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 5 min and subsequently stimulated with indicated concentrations of fMLP, LTB4, or PMA. Where indicated, human neutrophils were preincubated for 2 h at 37 °C in the presence or absence of PTX (8 μg/ml), followed by stimulation with fMLP, LTB4, or PMA. The reaction was stopped by the addition of the same volume of the lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2% Nonidet P-40, 20% glycerol, 8 mm EGTA, 8 mm EDTA, 80 μm p-amidinophenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (hydrochloride), 100 μg/ml of aprotinin, and 200 μg/ml each of leupeptin, chymostatin, and pepstatin A). The lysate was centrifuged for 20 s at 12,000 ×g, and the supernatant was incubated on ice for 3 min with GST-PAK2-RBD, which had been freshly coupled with glutathione-Sepharose-4B beads. Proteins complexed with the beads were recovered by centrifugation, washed two times with buffer A, and resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer. The proteins were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). The membrane was probed with anti-Rac1 antibody (C-11) or anti-Rac2 antibody (C-11) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and detection was performed using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibody and the ECL plus detection kit (both from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Human neutrophils suspended in 1 ml of HBS were preincubated for 5 min at 37 °C and subsequently stimulated with PMA or fMLP. The superoxide-producing activity was determined, as described previously (10Sumimoto H. Takeshige K. Minakami S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 803: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 18Sumimoto H. Kage Y. Nunoi H. Sasaki H. Nose T. Fukumaki Y. Ohno M. Minakami S. Takeshige K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5345-5349Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). To test the validity of the RBD of human PAK2 (amino acids 66 to 147) as a tool to identify the active GTP-bound state of Rac, we expressed and purified the domain as a GST fusion protein (GST-PAK2-RBD). Recombinant Rac1 and Rac2 preloaded with GTPγS were precipitated using glutathione-Sepharose-4B beads coupled to the fusion protein, washed three times, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1). Under the conditions, the binding of the active Rac1/2 to GST-PAK2-RBD appeared stable because further washing did not affect the recovery of the GTPases (data not shown). The same results were obtained when GTP was loaded instead of GTPγS (data not shown). On the other hand, the beads coupled to GST-PAK2-RBD did not retain the wild-type Rac1 and Rac2 in GDP-bound states (Fig. 1). When Rac2 was loaded with ATP, CTP, or UTP, no interaction with the GST fusion protein was observed (data not shown). In addition, neither GTP- nor GTPγS-bound Rac interacted with the beads coupled to GST alone (data not shown). Thus PAK2-RBD specifically recognizes the GTP-bound, active state of Rac to form a stable complex and thereby can be used as an activation-specific probe for Rac. After human neutrophils were stimulated with the Gi-coupled receptor agonist fMLP and then lysed, Rac was precipitated with GST-PAK2-RBD bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads and identified by Western blot with a polyclonal antibody against Rac2. This antibody is specific to Rac2 and does not recognize other members of the Rho family GTPases such as Rac1, Cdc42, or RhoA (data not shown). As shown in Fig.2 A, stimulation with fMLP led to a rapid and transient increase in the amount of Rac2 that bound to PAK2-RBD: the increase occurred within 30 s and reached its maximum level at 1 min. The amounts of Rac2 detected were dependent on the concentration of fMLP (Fig. 2 B). Increases do not seem to be because of changes in Rac protein levels because the same amount of Rac2 was detected during the stimulation in the whole cell lysates by Western blot analysis (data not shown). At the maximal level, about 10–12% of total Rac2 could be precipitated with GST-PAK2-RBD, when estimated by Western blot using various amounts of the whole cell lysates (Fig. 2 C). In contrast with the GST fusion protein, GST alone bound to the beads failed to precipitate Rac2 in the fMLP-stimulated cells (data not shown). When an antibody specific to Rac1 was used instead of the anti-Rac2 antibody, no specific bands on Western blot were observed (data not shown). This is consistent with Rac2 being largely predominant (>96%) in human neutrophils (29Heyworth P.G. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. Curnutte J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30749-30752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since PAK2-RBD associates exclusively with the GTP-bound state of Rac2, with no detectable affinity for the GDP-bound protein (Fig. 1), we conclude that fMLP induces a rapid and transient conversion of Rac2 to the GTP-bound active state. LTB4, another Gi-coupled receptor agonist, also caused a rapid and transient activation of Rac2 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2, A and B). The maximal amount of the GTP-bound Rac2 formed by LTB4 (about 10% of total Rac2) was slightly less than that in response to fMLP (Fig.2 C). Human neutrophils, in response to fMLP, produce superoxide, the production which is catalyzed by the phagocyte NADPH oxidase that is activated upon cell stimulation (31Okada T. Sakuma L. Fukui Y. Hazeki O. Ui M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3563-3567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Ding J. Vlahos C.J. Liu R. Brown R.F. Badwey J.A. J. Biol.

LTB4 also triggers superoxide production but to a lesser extent (10Sumimoto H. Takeshige K. Minakami S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 803: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The kinetics of the production by these agonists, i.e. rapid onset and short duration of 1–2 min (10Sumimoto H. Takeshige K. Minakami S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 803: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 32Ding J. Vlahos C.J. Liu R. Brown R.F. Badwey J.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1991; 266: 7432-7439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), bear a resemblance to those of Rac2 activation (Fig. 2 A), which suggests that the agonist-induced conversion of Rac2 to the active state is linked to the NADPH oxidase activation. We next tested whether PMA, a potent inducer of superoxide production (34Watson F. Robinson J. Edwards S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7432-7439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), affects states of Rac2 in neutrophils or not. As shown in Fig. 2 B, PMA induced Rac2 activation in a dose-dependent manner. The activation occurred slowly but in a more sustained manner: it was observed as early as 1–2 min and reached a maximum after 5–10 min, followed by a decrease at 20 min (Fig. 2 A). The time course also resembles that of PMA-triggered activation of the NADPH oxidase (Ref. 34Watson F. Robinson J. Edwards S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7432-7439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; and data not shown). Approximately 7–8% of total Rac2 was converted to the GTP-bound state by PMA at the maximum (Fig. 2 C). It is well documented that both fMLP and LTB4 receptors on human neutrophils are coupled to the Gi class of heterotrimeric G-proteins (8Bokoch G.M. Blood. 1995; 86: 1649-1660Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Yokomizo T. Izumi T. Chang K. Takuwa Y. Shimizu T. Nature. 1997; 387: 620-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). The finding that both agonists cause activation of Rac2 in neutrophils (Fig. 2) suggests a role for Gi. To clarify the involvement of Gi in Rac2 activation, we tested the effect of PTX, which catalyzes ADP-ribosylation of Giα to uncouple Gi from the receptors (8Bokoch G.M. Blood. 1995; 86: 1649-1660Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The toxin treatment of human neutrophils resulted in a complete loss of the fMLP-induced superoxide production, while it did not affect the PMA-induced one (data not shown). In the PTX-treated cells, neither fMLP nor LTB4 was capable of activating Rac2 (Fig. 3), indicating that coupling of the receptors to Gi is required for the Rac2 activation. On the other hand, the treatment did not affect PMA-triggered activation of Rac2 (Fig. 3). In human neutrophils, fMLP activates PI3K to generate PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (30Stephens L. Eguinoa A. Corey S. Jackson T. Hawkins P.T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2265-2273Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 31Okada T. Sakuma L. Fukui Y. Hazeki O. Ui M. J. Biol.

PI3K inhibitors block not only the generation of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, but also superoxide production induced by fMLP (31Okada T. Sakuma L. Fukui Y. Hazeki O. Ui M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3563-3567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Ding J. Vlahos C.J. Liu R. Brown R.F. Badwey J.A. J. Biol.

To investigate the role of PI3K in Rac2 activation, we used wortmannin and LY294002, that specifically inhibit PI3K by distinct mechanisms (35Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Wymann M.P. Bulgarelli-Leva G. Zvelebil M.J. Pirola L. Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Panayotou G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1722-1733Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.4, A and B, fMLP-induced Rac2 activation was dose-dependently inhibited by wortmannin and by LY294002, respectively. Both inhibitors blocked fMLP-triggered superoxide production (Refs. 31Okada T. Sakuma L. Fukui Y. Hazeki O. Ui M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3563-3567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Ding J. Vlahos C.J. Liu R. Brown R.F. Badwey J.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in the same dose-dependent manner. LTB4-elicited activation of Rac2 was also sensitive to wortmannin or LY294002 (Fig.4 C). Thus the PI3K activity appears to be essential for the Gi-mediated activation of Rac2. PMA is incapable of activating PI3K in human neutrophils (30Stephens L. Eguinoa A. Corey S. Jackson T. Hawkins P.T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2265-2273Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, the PI3K inhibitors failed to affect PMA-induced Rac2 activation (Fig. 4 D) as well as superoxide production (data not shown). We therefore conclude that PMA activates Rac2 independently of PI3K. To study the role of PKC in PMA-induced Rac 2 activation, we tested the effect of the bisindolylmaleimide derivative GF109203X, a potent and selective inhibitor of PKC (37Toullec D. Pianetti P. Coste H. Bellevergue P. Grand-Perret T. Ajakane M. Baudet V. Boissin P. Boursier E. Loriolle F. Duhamel L. Charon D. Kirilovsky J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15771-15781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of 0.1 μm GF109203X, the PMA-elicited superoxide production by neutrophils was reduced by about 50%, whereas fMLP was capable of fully triggering the production (Ref. 38Wenzel-Seifert K. Schächtele C. Seifert R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 1536-1543Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar; and data not shown). At a higher concentration (1.0 μm), where the PMA-elicited superoxide production was completely prevented, the fMLP-induced one was only partially (by about 30%) blocked (Ref. 38Wenzel-Seifert K. Schächtele C. Seifert R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 1536-1543Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar; and data not shown). As shown in Fig. 5, GF109203X effectively inhibited the increase in the amount of GTP-bound Rac2 in neutrophils stimulated by PMA but not by fMLP. Thus PMA appears to form the GTP-bound Rac2 by activating PKC, which is not likely involved in fMLP-triggered activation of the GTPase. In the present study, we have developed a novel method to directly detect the GTP-bound active Rac that is converted from the GDP-bound state in intact cells. Using this method, we show that the Gi-coupled receptor agonists fMLP and LTB4elicit a rapid and transient activation of Rac2 in human neutrophils and that the activation is mediated via not only Gi but also PI3K. On the other hand, PMA causes a slow but more sustained activation of Rac2 in a PI3K-independent manner. Recent studies have suggested that PI3K is located upstream of Rac in growth factor or integrin-induced cytoskeletal reorganization (1Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5165) Google Scholar, 2Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2079) Google Scholar, 3Narumiya S. J. Biochem. 1996; 120: 215-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 4Toker A. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar). This suggestion is, however, largely based on experiments using a constitutively active or a dominant negative form of Rac, but not on those evaluating extent of activation of Rac. The only exception has been a study by Hawkins et al. (39Hawkins P.T. Eguinoa A. Qiu R.-G. Stokoe D. Cooke F.T. Walters R. Wennström S. Claesson-Welsh L. Evans T. Symons M. Stephens L. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 393-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar), showing that, in [32P]Pi-preloaded endothelial cells that stably overexpress an epitope-tagged Rac1, platelet-derived growth factor stimulates an increase in the [32P]GTP content of this Rac protein to a significant but small extent (about 1.7-fold), which is inhibited by wortmannin. The present study, using the novel method, demonstrates that fMLP and LTB4 cause a drastic increase in the GTP-bound, active state of “endogenous” Rac2, and that this increase is effectively blocked by PI3K inhibitors. The blockade does not seem to be due to nonspecific effects, because the inhibitors do not affect PMA-induced activation of Rac2. Thus PI3K likely functions upstream of Rac2 in the Gi-coupled receptor signaling pathway in human neutrophils. The mechanism by which PI3K activates Rac2 in neutrophils is presently unknown. The Rac GTPases are directly activated by a family of GEFs related to the oncogene product Dbl that enhance the exchange of bound GDP for GTP on Rac (40Whitehead I.P. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F1-F23Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). All known Dbl-related molecules have a PH domain (40Whitehead I.P. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J.

Kanematsu T. Takeuchi H. Yagisawa H. Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 76: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that Rac activation by GEFs, such as Vav and Sos, appears to be regulated by binding of the lipids to the PH domain (42Han J. Luby-Phelps K. Das B. Shu X. Xia Y. Mosteller R.D. Krishna U.M. Falck J.R. White M.A. Broek D. Science. 1998; 279: 558-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar, 43Nimnual A.S. Yatsula B.A. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1998; 279: 560-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). A similar regulation may occur in the PI3K-mediated activation of Rac2 in human neutrophils. In addition to the PI3K-dependent mechanism, GEFs for Rac can be regulated by posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylation by a protein kinase. It has been reported that tyrosine-phosphorylated Vav, but not the unphosphorylated protein, enhances GDP/GTP exchange on Rac (44Crespo P. Schuebel K.E. Ostrom A.A. Gutkind J.S. Bustelo X.R. Nature. 1997; 385: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). In this context, it should be noted that PMA, a direct activator of PKC, increases the GTP-bound, active state of Rac2, independently of PI3K. Phosphorylation by PKC might regulate GEF(s) to activate Rac2 in neutrophils. Activation of Rac in stimulated neutrophils has been postulated to occur because the GTP-bound Rac, but not the GDP-bound protein, can activate the phagocyte NADPH oxidase in vitro (12Abo A. Pick E. Hall A. Totty N. Teahan C.G. Segal A.W. Nature. 1991; 353: 668-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar, 13Knaus U.G. Heyworth P.G. Evans T. Curnutte J.T. Bokoch G.M.

Chem. 1992; 267: 10215-10218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, stimulus-dependent activation of Rac has not been demonstrated. This study, using the novel method, shows that three stimulants for the NADPH oxidase activation in vivo, fMLP, LTB4, and PMA, are all capable of activating Rac2 in human neutrophils. The kinetics of Rac2 activation by the stimulants correspond well with those of superoxide production. Although it is well documented that PI3K inhibitors block superoxide production triggered by fMLP but not that by PMA (31Okada T. Sakuma L. Fukui Y. Hazeki O. Ui M. J. Biol.

J. 1993; 296: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar), it has remained elusive how PI3K functions in the oxidase activation. As described above, PI3K is required for activation of Rac2 in the fMLP signaling, whereas PMA activates Rac2 in a PI3K-independent manner. Thus the present findings support the idea that Rac2 serves as a switch for the NADPH oxidase activation. We are grateful to Drs. K. Takeshige and D. Kang (Kyushu University) for encouragement and discussion."

https://openalex.org/W2099246814,"Recent development in the field of gene regulation by nuclear receptors (NRs) have identified a role for cofactors in transcriptional control. While some of the NR-associated proteins serve as coactivators, the effect of the receptor interacting protein 140 (RIP140) on NR transcriptional responses is complex. In this report we have studied the effect of RIP140 on gene regulation by the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). We demonstrate that RIP140 antagonized all GR-mediated responses tested, which included activation through classical GRE, the synergistic effects of glucocorticoids on AP-1 and Pbx1/HOXB1 responsive elements, as well as gene repression through a negative GRE and cross-talk with NF-κB (RelA). This involved the ligand-binding domain of the GR and did not occur when the GR was bound to the antagonist RU486. The strong repressive effect of RIP140 was restricted to glucocorticoid-mediated responses in as much as it slightly increased signaling through the RelA and the Pit-1/Pbx proteins and only slightly repressed signaling through the Pbx1/HOXB1 and AP-1 proteins, excluding general squelching as a mechanism. Instead, this suggests that RIP140 acts as a direct inhibitor of GR function. In line with a direct effect of RIP140 on the GR, we demonstrate a GR-RIP140 interaction in vitro by a glutathione S-transferase-pull down assay. Furthermore, the repressive effect of RIP140 could partially be overcome by overexpression of the coactivator TIF2, which involved a competition between TIF2 and RIP140 for binding to the GR.

This includes both stimulation and repression of target genes. Activation of target genes relies in most cases on the ability of the GR to bind to specific DNA sequences, termed glucocorticoid responsive elements (GREs) (1Carlstedt-Duke J. Wright T.

These GREs act as hormone-regulated enhancer elements. Following the interaction of the GR with the GREs and in vivo most likely with other transcription factors and cofactors, it is thought that the GR directly or indirectly contacts the proteins present in the basal transcription machinery (4Beato M. Sanchez-Pacheco A. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 587-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). In some cases glucocorticoids stimulate gene expression independent of GR binding to the GREs. Instead, this effect is mediated through a protein-protein interaction between the GR and a second transcription factor (5McEwan I.J. Wright A.P. Gustafsson J.A. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). However, the outcome of the response, i.e.stimulation or repression of gene expression, is dependent on the composition of the transcription factor complex targeted by the GR. The best characterized example of this is the effect GR confers on AP-1 controlled target genes. In the case of a c-Jun homodimer binding to the AP-1 site, the interaction with the GR leads to stimulation of AP-1 mediated transcription (6Teurich S. Angel P. Chem. Senses. 1995; 20: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In contrast, a c-Jun/c-Fos heterodimeric AP-1 complex is repressed by the interaction with the GR (6Teurich S. Angel P. Chem.

Cell. 1990; 62: 1189-1204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1375) Google Scholar). In addition, glucocorticoids enhance prolactin-stimulated transcription of the β-casein gene through the interaction of the GR with STAT5 (9Stocklin E. Wissler M. Gouilleux F. Groner B. Nature. 1996; 383: 726-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). The GR can also stimulate STAT3 and C/EBPβ controlled transcription without contacting the DNA (10Zhang Z. Jones S. Hagood J.S.

Furthermore, we have recently described potentiation of retinoic acid (RA) induced transcription through the Hoxb-1 promoter autoregulatory element b1-ARE, where this potentiation seems to involve a protein-protein interaction between the GR and the RA-induced Pbx1 and HOXB1 proteins binding to the b1-ARE. 2N. Subramaniam and S. Okret, manuscript in preparation. However, the role for GR interacting cofactors in this type of synergy between GR and other transcription factors is not known. Glucocorticoids also repress transcription. In principle, this involves either binding of the GR to negative GREs (nGREs) leading to displacement of transcription factors or interference with their transcriptional activation, or alternatively binding of the GR to a second transcription factor independent of GR binding to the DNA (12Drouin J. Parker M.G. Nuclear Hormone Receptors. Academic Press Ltd., London1993: 118-140Google Scholar,13Akerblom I.W. Mellon P.L. Parker M.G. Nuclear Hormone Receptors. Academic Press Ltd., London1991: 175-196Google Scholar). Examples of nGREs are the PRL3 element in the bovine prolactin promoter and the human osteocalcin nGRE overlapping the TATA box (14Subramaniam N. Cairns W. Okret S. J. Biol.

Examples of repression of target genes independent of GR binding to the DNA are the suppression of NF-κB signaling (17Caldenhoven E. Liden J. Wissink S. Van de Stolpe A. Raaijmakers J. Koenderman L.

The GR contains a major transcriptional activation domain called activator function-1 (AF-1 or τ1) localized in the less conserved N-terminal region of the receptor (Ref. 19Almlof T. Wallberg A.E. Gustafsson J.-Å. Wright A.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9586-9594Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar and references therein). A second activation domain, the highly conserved ligand-dependent AF-2, is localized in the multifunctional ligand-binding domain (LBD) of the GR (20Glass C.K. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 222-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar, 21Horwitz K.B. Jackson T.A. Bain D.L. Richer J.K. Takimoto G.S. Tung L. Mol.

During the past few years, so called coactivators and corepressors have been identified that modulate the transcriptional activity of NRs. With regard to the GR, several coactivators have been shown to interact with the GR and stimulate its transcriptional activity, including GRIP1/TIF2 (23Eggert M. Mows C.C. Tripier D. Arnold R.

Science. 1995; 270: 1354-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (2063) Google Scholar), CBP/p300 (26Chakravarti D. LaMorte V.J. Nelson M.C. Nakajima T. Schulman I.G. Juguilon H. Montminy M. Evans R.M.

These coactivators are thought to act as bridging factors between the receptors and the basal transcription machinery. In addition, some of the coactivators have been shown to contain intrinsic histone acetyltransferase activity, thus linking gene activation by NRs to histone modification and chromatin alterations (28Grant P.A. Schieltz D. Praygrant M.G. Steger D.J. Reese J.C. Yates J.R. Workman J.L. Cell. 1998; 94: 45-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 29Struhl K. Moqtaderi Z. Cell. 1998; 94: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Several of the recently identified coactivators have been shown to interact with the AF-2 of the NRs (Ref.3Resche-Rigon M. Gronemeyer H. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1998; 2: 501-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar and references therein). In most cases this interaction requires the binding of an agonist to the receptor (30Onate S.A. Boonyaratanakornkit V. Spencer T.E. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.-J. Edwards D.P. O'Malley B.W. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3741-3751Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). This correlates to a conformational change in the LBD and the ability of the NRs to transactivate (Ref. 3Resche-Rigon M. Gronemeyer H. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1998; 2: 501-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar and references therein). One cofactor identified is the receptor interacting protein 140 (RIP140). This cofactor was first identified by in vitroprotein-protein interaction assays using the hormone-binding domain of the estrogen receptor (ER) as a bait (32Cavailles V. Dauvois S. L'Horset F. Lopez G. Hoare S. Kushner P.J. Parker M.G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3741-3751Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). The interactions of RIP140 with ER, retinoic acid receptor, and thyroid hormone receptor (TR) are all induced by their respective ligands and RIP140 weakly enhancesin vivo transcription of these NRs (33L'Horset F. Dauvois S. Heery D.M. Cavailles V. Parker M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6029-6036Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). RIP140 has also been shown to act as a coactivator for the rat androgen receptor (34Ikonen T. Palvimo J.J. Janne O.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29821-29828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). However, more recent studies question a general coactivator role for RIP140 as RIP140 inhibited Pit-1/ER and Pit-1/TR synergistic transactivation from the rat prolactin and growth hormone promoter, respectively (35Chuang F.M. West B.L. Baxter J.D. Schaufele F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1332-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). RIP140 also represses transcriptional activation of the orphan nuclear receptor TR2 (36Lee C.H. Chinpaisal C. Wei L.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6745-6755Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Furthermore, RIP140 may act as a coregulator of NRs rather than a coactivator as it antagonized the function of the coactivator SRC-1 on peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) (37Treuter E. Albrektsen T. Johansson L. Leers J. Gustafsson J.-Å. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 864-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). In this report we have investigated the effect of RIP140 on glucocorticoid responsive genes. This includes activation mediated through a classical GRE, activation through cross-talk with AP-1 and homeodomain proteins as well as glucocorticoid-regulated repression via an nGRE and NF-κB (RelA). We show that all glucocorticoid responses investigated are deregulated by RIP140 and that this most likely is mediated through an interaction between the GR and RIP140, abrogating GR function. The repressive activity of RIP140 could be explained by the ability of RIP140 to prevent binding of a “true” coactivator to the GR. The (GRE)2-tk-Luc reporter gene and the GR expression plasmid pSVGR1 have been described previously (38Delaunay F. Liden J. Gustafsson J.-Å. Okret S. Eur. J.

HeLa tk−cells, COS-7 cells, GH3 cells, and P19 embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (all from Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C in 10% CO2. Cells were plated at approximately 30% confluence in 6-well plates and the following day cells were transfected by LipofectinTM with 1 μg/well of reporter plasmid and 250 ng of the GR expression plasmid following the protocol of the manufacturer (Life Technologies, Inc.). When indicated, 100 ng of RIP140 expression plasmid was co-transfected. After a 6-h incubation at 37 °C in 10% CO2, the medium containing the DNA-Lipofectin mixture was removed and fresh complete medium was added containing either the vehicle ethanol (final concentration 0.01%), 1 μm dexamethasone (Dex), or 100 nm RU486. In some experiments 1 μm trans-RA or 100 ng/ml TPA (all from Sigma) dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide was added. In experiments when the synergy between Dex and TPA was analyzed, medium containing 0.5% serum was used. Following incubation for 16–24 h, cells were lysed and luciferase or CAT (chloramphenicol acetyltransferase) activity was determined as described (15Subramaniam N. Cairns W. Okret S.

Each experimental condition was measured in triplicate and the values given represent the mean ± S.D from two to three experimental occasions. The GR and RIP140 proteins were transcribed and translated in vitro using the plasmids pGEM3-rGR and pSG5-RIP140, respectively, in rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the presence or absence of [35S]methionine as instructed by the manufacturer (Promega). The expression and purification of the GST, GST-GR, and GST-TIF2 fusion proteins was carried out as described previously (24Leers J. Treuter E. Gustafsson J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6001-6013Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 37Treuter E. Albrektsen T. Johansson L. Leers J. Gustafsson J.-Å. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 864-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The translated35S-labeled RIP140 or GR was incubated with GST, GST-GR, or GST-TIF2 fusion protein loaded on glutathione-Sepharose beads in a binding buffer containing 0.2 m NaCl (37Treuter E. Albrektsen T. Johansson L. Leers J. Gustafsson J.-Å. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 864-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). In the case of GST-TIF2-35S-GR interaction, an increasing amount ofin vitro translated unlabeled RIP140 was added. Non-primed reticulocyte lysate was supplemented so that all incubations contained the same amount of lysate. After washing the beads, pelleted proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (10%) and the amount of35S-labeled RIP140 or GR was detected by autoradiography. In order to investigate the effect of RIP140 on the ability of the GR to transactivate through GREs, a luciferase reporter gene ((GRE)2-tk-Luc) controlled by a heterologous promoter (the thymidine kinase promoter (tk) −105 to +52) and two GREs was co-transfected with a GR expression vector (SVGR1) with or without an expression vector for RIP140 (pSG-RIP140) into P19 EC cells. In the absence of RIP140, the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone (Dex) induced reporter gene activity 12-fold (Fig.1, lane 2). In contrast, when RIP140 was expressed in the cells, Dex-induced luciferase activity was abolished (Fig. 1 A, lane 4). This suggests that RIP140 somehow interferes with the transcriptional activity of GR. As it has been previously demonstrated that RIP140 interacts with the AF-2 domain located in the C-terminal LBD of NRs, we tested the ability of RIP140 to interfere with a GR that lacked its LBD. A GR devoid of its LBD harbors a constitutive ligand independent transactivation capacity due to the presence of a constitutive transactivation domain (τ1 or AF-1) in the N-terminal domain (39Godowski P.J. Rusconi S. Miesfeld R. Yamamoto K.R. Nature. 1987; 325: 365-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Fig.1 B, lane 2, shows that the GR devoid of its LBD enhanced the reporter gene activity by about 5-fold in the absence of co-transfected RIP140, and no effect on the constitutive transcriptional activity was obtained in the presence of co-transfected RIP140 (compare lanes 2 and 3). This demonstrates that RIP140 is only able to antagonize the GR activity when it contains its LBD that includes the cofactor interacting AF-2 domain. Furthermore, this experiment showed that the ability of RIP140 to repress the activity of the wild type GR is not due to a general squelching of transcriptional activity, because the constitutively transactivating GR devoid of its LBD was unaffected. Since RIP140 antagonized GR-mediated gene activation through GREs, we were interested to know whether this effect of RIP140 also occurred on alternative glucocorticoid responsive genes whose expression are stimulated by glucocorticoids independent of binding of the GR to GREs. For this, we investigated the consequence of RIP140 expression on glucocorticoid stimulation of phorbol ester (TPA)-induced expression from a AP-1 responsive reporter gene. HeLa cells expressing endogenous GR were transfected with a TPA inducible collagenase A promoter, containing a TPA response element (TRE), coupled to a luciferase reporter gene (−73ColA-Luc) with or without the RIP140 expression vector. In the absence of transfected RIP140, TPA treatment of the cells stimulated luciferase activity 15–17-fold (Fig.2 A). Under our conditions, co-treatment with TPA and Dex caused a further enhancement of the luciferase activity to 33–35-fold stimulation. Dex alone caused a 5-fold induction of reporter gene activity. This is probably due to a small constitutive AP-1 activity in the cells. Interestingly, RIP140 specifically inhibited the glucocorticoid-induced synergistic enhancement of TPA stimulated activity, while it only modestly reduced the TPA response (Fig. 2 A). Also the small Dex induced activation of the collagenase A-luciferase reporter gene in the absence of TPA treatment was abolished by co-transfection with RIP140. Similar results were obtained when the luciferase reporter gene was controlled by a heterologous promoter (tk promoter −105 to +52) and three TREs (data not shown). This demonstrates that RIP140 also inhibits the cross-talk between GR and AP-1 transcription factors. Glucocorticoids enhance transcription not only through AP-1 transcription factors but also via a second class of proteins, namely homeodomain containing proteins. We have observed that glucocorticoids enhance the RA-induced expression of a luciferase reporter gene controlled by the Hoxb-1 gene promoter autoregulatory element b1-ARE.2 The b1-ARE is recognized by two homeodomain containing proteins, Pbx1 and HOXB1, both induced by RA in P19 embryonal carcinoma (P19 EC) cells. Results suggest that the GR enhances the RA-induced transcription from the b1-ARE by directly contacting the Pbx1 and HOXB1 proteins without binding to the DNA itself. In order to investigate whether RIP140 will also interfere with glucocorticoid enhancement of RA-induced expression from the b1-ARE, the reporter gene pAdMLARE and the GR expression vector were co-transfected into P19 EC cells with or without the expression vector for RIP140. Treatment of the cells with RA induced b1-ARE luciferase gene activity 20-fold (Fig. 2 B, lane 2). Dex in itself had no effect on the b1-ARE luciferase gene activity, but co-treatment with RA and Dex caused a synergistic activation (35-fold stimulation). Transfection with RIP140 abolished this Dex/RA mediated synergy on the b1-ARE element (Fig. 2 B, compare lanes 6 and8). This demonstrates that a separate GR controlled cross-talk pathway, in addition to AP-1, is affected by RIP140. To be noted is that the RIP140 does not significantly affect the RA-induced expression of the b1-ARE luciferase gene, demonstrating a specificity in the inactivation function of RIP140. The synergistic activity between Pbx1/Hoxb1 and GR on the b1-ARE is also observed when the GR is bound to the glucocorticoid antagonist RU486 (Fig. 2 B, lane 10). In contrast to the ability of RIP140 to abolish the Pbx1/Hoxb1 and GR synergy when the GR was bound to an agonist (Dex), RIP140 was unable to abolish the synergy when the GR was bound to the antagonist RU486 (lane 12). This suggests that RIP140, like several other cofactors, only interacts with NRs bound to agonists (30Onate S.A. Boonyaratanakornkit V. Spencer T.E. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.-J. Edwards D.P. O'Malley B.W. J.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3741-3751Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). This also supports the previous conclusion that RIP140 does not act as a general inhibitor of transcription. In order to explore whether the inhibitory activity of RIP140 also applied to other pathways repressed by the GR, two negatively regulated response elements were investigated. In the first case we examined the effect of RIP140 on gene repression by the GR via the interaction of the GR with a negative GRE (nGRE) from the bovine prolactin gene (PRL3 nGRE (43Sakai D.D. Helms S. Carlstedt-Duke J. Gustafsson J.-A. Rottman F.M. Yamamoto K.R. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1144-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar)). We have previously shown that repression via this nGRE requires the interaction of the GR with the PRL3 nGRE (15Subramaniam N. Cairns W. Okret S. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 153-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Binding of the GR to the PRL3 nGRE involves displacement in pituitary cells of the pituitary-specific transcription factor Pit-1 and a ubiquitously expressed Pbx protein (14Subramaniam N. Cairns W. Okret S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23567-23574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 15Subramaniam N. Cairns W. Okret S. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 153-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). When the PRL3nGRE-CAT reporter gene was transfected into pituitary GH3 cells, Dex repressed transcription by about 40% (Fig.3 A). However, when RIP140 was co-transfected, GR was no longer able to repress the transcriptional activity from the PRL3 element. Interestingly, RIP140 slightly but significantly (p < 0.05) increased the basal activity from the PRL3 element in the absence of glucocorticoid treatment. Identical results were observed in COS-7 cells, in which cells GR also represses transcription from the PRL3 nGRE (data not shown). In non-pituitary cells Oct-1 replaces the function of Pit-1 (14Subramaniam N. Cairns W. Okret S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23567-23574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Glucocorticoids also repress NF-κB controlled target genes by the ability of GR to interfere with the transcriptional activity of NF-κB proteins (17Caldenhoven E. Liden J. Wissink S. Van de Stolpe A. Raaijmakers J. Koenderman L. Okret S. Gustafsson J.A. Van der Saag P.T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 401-412Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This mainly occurs via a protein-protein interaction between the GR and NF-κB proteins independent of the ability of GR to interact with the DNA. To assess whether repression of NF-κB signaling by glucocorticoid is relieved by RIP140, we transfected a luciferase reporter gene containing three NF-κB sites from the human intercellular adhesion molecule-1 promoter and a minimal (−105 to +52) tk promoter together with expression vectors for the GR and the NF-κB family member RelA with or without the expression vector for RIP140 into COS-7 cells. Transfection with RelA stimulated the transcription from the 3xNF-κB(IC)tk-luciferase gene 10-fold (data not shown) and treatment with Dex repressed this activity by 50% (Fig.3 B). Interestingly, co-transfection with RIP140 not only derepressed the GR-dependent inhibition but also slightly but significantly (p < 0.05) enhanced the RelA-mediated transactivation of the luciferase reporter gene. These results show that in addition to inhibiting GR-mediated enhancement of transcription, RIP140 also blocks GR-mediated repression, both from target genes which involves binding of the GR to nGREs and throug"

The open reading frame of ALF predicts a protein of 478 amino acids that contains characteristic N- and C-terminal conserved domains separated by an internal nonconserved domain. In addition, a rare ALF-containing cDNA, which possesses an extended N terminus (Stoned B/TFIIAα/β-like factor; SALF) has also been identified. The results of Northern and dot blot analyses show that ALF is expressed almost exclusively in testis; in contrast, TFIIAα/β and TFIIAγ are enriched in testis but are also widely expressed in other human tissues. Recombinant ALF (69 kDa) and TFIIAγ (12 kDa) polypeptides produced in Escherichia coli form an ALF/γ complex that can stabilize TBP-TATA interactions in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. The ALF/γ complex is also able to restore transcription from the adenovirus major late promoter using HeLa cell nuclear extracts that have been depleted of TFIIA.

Together, the subunits of TFIIA form a six strand β-barrel that interacts with the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and a separate four-helix bundle positioned just upstream of the TBP-TATA complex (12Tan S.

Science. 1996; 272: 830-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). TFIIA has multiple roles in transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II. First, the association of TFIIA and TBP stabilizes the TBP-TATA element interaction (14Buratowski S. Hahn S. Guarente L. Sharp P.A.

Third, TFIIA is required for the isomerization and extension of TFIID-promoter contacts (34Oelgeschlager T. Chiang C.-M. Roeder R.G.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3007-3019Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Indeed, efficient transcription from the TATA-less human TdT promoter (37Martinez E. Ge H. Tao Y. Yuan C. Palhan V. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6571-6583Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and preferential utilization of the distal Drosophila Adh core promoter (38Hansen S.K. Tjian R. Cell. 1995; 82: 565-575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) require TFIIA. Previous studies have revealed the presence of two genes for TBP-like proteins in Arabidopsis (At-1 and At-2) (39Gasch A. Hoffmann A. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Chua N.-H. Nature. 1990; 346: 390-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar),Drosophila (TBP and TRF) (40Crowley T.E. Hoey T. Liu J.-K. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Tjian R.

Nature. 1998; 393: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) and raise the idea that TBP homologs may contribute to tissue- and gene-specific regulation. For example, the Drosophila TRF protein is expressed in the central nervous system and gonads and is localized to a limited number of sites on polytene chromosomes (40Crowley T.E. Hoey T. Liu J.-K.

In this work we extend the idea of multiplicity within the general transcription factors to include human TFIIA. In particular, we identify a cDNA clone that encodes a novel human factor, ALF (TFIIAα/β-like factor), that is expressed almost exclusively in testis. In addition, ALF sequences are present as part of another cDNA, termed SALF (Stoned B/TFIIAα/β-like factor), that contains an N-terminal domain homologous to DrosophilaStoned B (43Andrews J. Smith M. Merakovsky J. Coulson M. Hannan F. Kelly L.E. Genetics. 1996; 143: 1699-1711Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and clathrin adapter proteins μ1 (AP47) and μ2 (AP50) (44Thurieau C. Brosius J. Burne C.

Results are also presented that show ALF is a functional counterpart of TFIIAα/β that, together with TFIIAγ (p12), can stabilize TBP-TATA element interactions and support RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription in vitro. Finally, we discuss the significance of ALF as a testis-specific general transcription factor. NCBI data base searches (tBLASTn) with human TFIIAα/β identified an incomplete human placental cDNA sequence (I.M.A.G.E. Consortium Clone ID 259637) (46Lennon C.G. Auffray C. Polymeropoulos M. Soares M.B. Genomics. 1996; 33: 151-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar) homologous to amino acids 315–376. This clone was obtained from Genome Systems and sequenced. Human cDNAs that correspond to this EST clone were initially identified by PCR amplification (35 cycles) of 1.1- and 0.9-kb products from human placenta, liver, and testis “Marathon” cDNA libraries (CLONTECH) using 25 pmol of the upstream primer 2a2–1 (5′-AGAAATTCCCTCTGATTG-3′) and the downstream primers 2a2–6 (5′-AGTAACCCGAATGCTTAA-3′) and 2a2–8 (5′-ATGCTAGCTGAACCACTG-3′). The 1.1- and 0.9-kb products derived from the liver cDNA library were subcloned into pGEM-T Easy (Promega) and sequenced. The 5′-end of the SALF cDNA was isolated by PCR (40 cycles) using 4 μl of the human placental cDNA library with primer 2a2–6 and a library-specific adapter primer AP1 (5′-CCATCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGC-3′) (CLONTECH), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The resulting products were reamplified (35 cycles) with primer 2a2–8 and the nested library-specific adaptor primer AP2 (5′-ACTCACTATAGGGCTCGAGCGGC-3′), and the resulting 2930-bp product was subcloned into the pCRII cloning vector (Invitrogen) to form pRACE4. The overlapping sequences of pRACE4 and EST ID259637 were combined to form the composite SALF sequence. The 5′-end of the ALF cDNA was isolated by PCR (35 cycles) using 4 μl of the human testis cDNA library (CLONTECH) with the gene-specific primer 2a2–20 (5′-CCAGAAGGTAGAATTGCGGGTTGCTGTAGC-3′) and primer AP1 and reamplified with 2a2–22 (5′-GGAGTTTGAAGTGCCCAGGTCTGCTGTGG-3′) and primer AP2. The 369-bp amplification product was subcloned into pGEM-T Easy to form pRACE22. A full-length PCR product was amplified (35 cycles) from 4 μl of the testis library using primer 2a2–17 (5′-GGTGCTGTCATGGCCTGCCTCAACCCGG-3′), located within the unique 5′-end of ALF, and primer AP1. The resulting ∼1.7-bp fragment was subcloned into pGEM-T Easy to form pRACE17. The overlapping sequences of pRACE22 and pRACE17 were combined to form the composite ALF sequence. Multiple tissue Northern blots containing 2 μg of poly(A) mRNA from 16 human tissues and a dot blot containing 89–514 ng of poly(A) mRNA from 50 adult and fetal tissues were obtained from CLONTECH. Gene-specific probes for hybridization experiments were as follows: ALF, a 621-bp NcoI-KpnI fragment or an 899-bpHincII-BglII fragment from region II (see Fig.1 B); 5′-SALF, a 1002-bp EcoRI-EcoRI fragment from pRACE4 containing the 5′-UTR and nucleotides encoding the first 282 residues (see Fig. 1 B); hTFIIAα/β, a full-length 1.1-kb EcoRI-EcoRI fragment from λ11 (3DeJong J.

Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2220-2234Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) or a 282-bp HaeIII-HaeIII fragment from region II; hTFIIAγ, a full-length 355-bpNdeI-BamHI fragment or a 262-bpNdeI-EcoRI fragment from pRSEThp12 (7DeJong J. Bernstein R. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3313-3317Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar); and actin and ubiquitin controls provided by CLONTECH. DNA fragments were typically labeled with [α32P]dCTP using Ready-To-Go DNA Labeling Beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Northern blots were hybridized for 1 h in ExpressHyb solution (CLONTECH) and washed at 68 °C for 1 h. Membranes were typically exposed for 1–2 days to either XAR-5 film (Kodak) or a PhosphorImager screen (Molecular Dynamics). The results in the left hand column in Fig. 5, C and D, were obtained with different blots; other results within each column were obtained by reusing a single blot. The actin control in the left hand column is a representative result. For experiments using the dot blot, labeled DNA was combined with 30 μg of Cot-1 DNA (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 100 μg of salmon sperm DNA, denatured, and allowed to renature in 200 μl of 5× SSC at 68 °C for 30 min prior to the addition. After hybridization in 5 ml of ExpressHyb solution at 65 °C overnight, the blot was washed in 0.1× SSC at 55 °C. Membranes were exposed as follows: Fig.6 A, 19 h; 6B, 2 h 45 min; 6C, 14 h; 6D, 25 h, and 6E, 30 min. For reprobing, Northern and dot blots were stripped twice with 0.5% SDS at 100 °C, cooled to room temperature, and exposed overnight to confirm the loss of the previous signals. Quantitation of hybridization signals was performed using ImageQuaNT (Molecular Dynamics), and relative transcript levels in testis were determined by comparison to an average level from non-testis tissues. Genomic DNA (10 μg) from HeLa cells was digested with the indicated restriction enzymes (BglII and EcoRI), electrophoresed on 0.7% agarose gels, and transferred overnight to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). Hybridization was performed under stringent conditions at 42 °C in 50% formamide, or at 68 °C, in hybridization buffer (6× SSC, 0.5% SDS, 5× Denhardt's solution, and 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA). The probes included a full-length 1.1-kbEcoRI-EcoRI TFIIAα/β fragment from λ11 (3DeJong J. Roeder R.G. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2220-2234Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), a full-length NdeI-BamHI ALF fragment described in the following section (pRSET-ALF), or anNdeI-BamHI TFIIAγ fragment from pRSEThp12 (7DeJong J. Bernstein R. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3313-3317Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Blots were typically washed at 65 °C in 0.1× SSC and 0.5% SDS and exposed at −80 °C to XAR-5 film. To express recombinant ALF polypeptides, primers A1 (5′-ACTACTCATATGGCACACCATCACCATCACCATGTACCTAAACTCTACAGATCT-3′) and A2 (5′-AGTAGTGGATCCTTACCACTCTGCATCACC-3′) were used to create a 1445-bpNdeI-BamHI PCR fragment whose reading frame begins with the N-terminal extension MHHHHHHV and terminates with the natural TAA stop codon. This construct does not encode the first six amino acids (MACLNP) found in the intact testis-derived ALF cDNA. After subcloning into pRSETC (Invitrogen), the resulting construct (pRSET-ALF) was transformed into Escherichia coliBL21(DE3)pLysS (Novagen) and was expressed and purified essentially as described in protocols supplied by Qiagen. Specifically, cells were grown in LB medium at 37 °C to an A 600 of ∼0.5, and production of the 69-kDa recombinant protein was induced with 2 mm isopropyl-b-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Cells were harvested 3 h post-induction, solubilized in Buffer A (0.1 m NaH2PO4, 0.01 mTris, pH 8.0, and either 6 m guanidine or 8 murea), and sonicated five times for 30 s. The denatured cell lysate (∼20 ml) was then incubated with 2 ml of nickel-NTA-agarose resin (Qiagen) at room temperature for 1 h. The resin was washed successively with Buffer A containing 8 m urea at pH 8.0, 6.3, and 5.9, and bound polypeptides were eluted at pH 3.5. Preparation of expression constructs for rat TFIIAα/β and rat TFIIAγ subunits (GenBank Accession numbers AF000943 and AF000944, respectively) and purification of the corresponding 55- and 12-kDa recombinant proteins were performed similarly. For transcription experiments the recombinant p69 and p12 proteins were codialyzed to prevent precipitation of the p12 subunit. Human TBP was expressed from pET11d (Novagen), induced with 2 mm isopropyl-b-d-thiogalactopyranoside atA 600 0.3, and purified at 4 °C from the soluble fraction of the bacterial lysate over nickel-NTA-agarose. Purification was performed by washing the resin with D700 buffer (20 mm HEPES, 20% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 700 mm KCl) that contained 5, 10, and 15 mm imidazole and eluting bound polypeptides with D700 buffer that contained 100 mmimidazole. Recombinant proteins were dialyzed against Buffer C (10 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 100 mm KCl prior to use. To express SALF, primers NN1 (5′-TACTGCTCGAGCAACTTTAGAGT-3′) and 2a2–8 were used to generate a 2988-bp product from pRACE4. An internal 2207-bp XhoI-BglII fragment (amino acids 1–716) derived from this PCR product was then inserted into theXhoI-BglII-digested pT7T3D vector that contained EST ID259637. Because an internal BglII-BglII fragment that spans amino acids 717–1084 was excised during the preparation of this vector, this fragment was later reinserted in the appropriate orientation to create a full-length SALF open reading frame (ORF) (pT7T3-SALF). This construct (0.8 μg) was used to program rabbit reticulocyte lysates in the presence of [35S]methionine as described by the manufacturer (Promega). Labeled polypeptides were separated on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Mobility shift assays were performed using 10 fmol of a [γ-32P]ATP kinase-labeled TATA-containing oligonucleotide (5′-AAGGGGGGCTATAAAAGGGGTGGG-3′) that spanned −40 to −16 of the adenovirus major late (AdML) promoter. Binding reactions (25-μl final volume) were performed in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 2% polyethylene glycol-8000 (w/v), 60 mm KCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mmEDTA, 5 mm ammonium sulfate, 4 mmMgCl2, and 8% glycerol essentially as described (3DeJong J. Roeder R.G. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2220-2234Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 47Maldonado E. Ha I. Cortes P. Weis P. Reinberg D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6335-6347Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Recombinant rat p55 (30 ng, 29 nm), rat p12 (1.1 μg, 3.5 μm), human ALF (180 ng, 137 nm), and human TBP (125 ng, 133 nm) were added to reactions as indicated. Reactions were incubated for 30 min at room temperature, and complexes were separated on native 5% polyacrylamide gels containing 0.5× TBE and 5% glycerol. Competition experiments contained either cold AdML TATA or SP1 (5′-TTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAG-3′) oligonucleotides, and antibody supershift reactions contained 2–4 μl of rabbit polyclonal antiserum raised against the 55-kDa hTFIIAα/β polypeptide (3DeJong J. Roeder R.G. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2220-2234Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). HeLa cell nuclear extracts were depleted of TFIIA essentially as described (3DeJong J. Roeder R.G. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2220-2234Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 4Ma D. Watanabe H. Mermelstein F. Admon A. Oguri K. Sun X. Wada T. Imai T. Shiroya T. Reinberg D. Handa H.

A. 1995; 92: 3313-3317Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In brief, 200 μl of extract was incubated with 100 μl of nickel-NTA-agarose resin for 30 min at 4 °C in the presence of 400 mm KCl. Control extracts were processed similarly, except that no nickel-NTA-agarose was present. After microcentrifugation for 5 min, supernatants were removed and dialyzed for 3 h against Buffer C that contained 100 mm KCl. Transcription reactions were performed using a template (pMLC2AT) that contains the AdML promoter upstream of a G-free cassette (48Sawadogo M. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4394-4398Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). The template was linearized at a SmaI site just beyond the G-free cassette prior to use. Reactions (20 μl) contained 8 μl of nuclear extract (∼60 μg protein), 2 μl (550 ng) of recombinant p69 (0.22 μm) and p12 (0.9 μm) proteins, 1 μg of pMLC2AT, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 25 mm KCl, 6 mm MgCl2, 625 μm UTP, 625 μm ATP, 35 μmCTP, 200 μm O-methyl-GTP, 3% glycerol, 0.7 μl of [α-32P]CTP, and 37.3 units of RNAguard (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After incubation at 30 °C for 45 min, reactions were terminated by adding 270 μl of stop solution (0.25m NaCl, 1% SDS, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, and 66.7 μg/ml tRNA) and extracted with an equal volume of phenol/chloroform (1:1). Ethanol-precipitated transcripts were resuspended in formamide-containing loading dye and electrophoresed on 5% acrylamide gels containing 1× TBE and 8m urea. Sequencing reactions were performed at The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. Sequence comparisons and alignments were done with Lasergene (DNASTAR). Custom oligonucleotides were obtained from Operon. Computer searches of expressed sequence tags (dbEST) with a human TFIIAα/β query identified a homologous placental cDNA sequence (I.M.A.G.E. Consortium Clone ID 259637). Sequence analysis showed that this 1885-bp clone (Fig.1 A) encodes 471 amino acids similar in sequence and organization to TFIIAα/β. Surprisingly, the homology with TFIIAα/β ends several residues short of where the initiating methionine was expected to be. Instead, the ORF continues for an additional 93 amino acids at the N terminus and bears similarity to a Drosophila protein called Stoned B (43Andrews J. Smith M. Merakovsky J. Coulson M. Hannan F. Kelly L.E. Genetics. 1996; 143: 1699-1711Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and to the mammalian clathrin adaptor proteins (AP) μ1 (AP47) and μ2 (AP50) (44Thurieau C. Brosius J. Burne C. Jolles P.

Biochem. 1990; 59: 415-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar and 50Hirst J. Robinson M.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1404: 173-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). To determine whether this EST reflects the actual structure of a corresponding human mRNA, we performed PCR analysis. Primers within the TFIIAα/β-like sequence (2a2–6 and 2a2–8) and the upstream Stoned B-like sequence (2a2–1) amplified products of expected size (1.1- and 0.9-kb) from both human placenta and liver cDNA libraries (Fig. 1, A and D, lanes 1–4). Similar results were obtained using a human testis cDNA library (data not shown). Analysis of the liver-derived products showed that they contain sequences identical to those present in EST ID259637, confirming that the EST is a real, albeit incomplete, human cDNA clone. To isolate the full-length 5′-end of this species, we performed PCR reactions on a human placental cDNA library using gene-specific primers within the TFIIAα/β-like sequence (2a2–6 and 2a2–8) and adapter primers AP1 and AP2. The resulting PCR product (pRACE4) (Fig.1 B) contains 3′-sequences that are identical to EST ID259637, except for a 141-bp deletion that removes 47 amino acids (787–833) within region II of the TFIIAα/β-like domain. pRACE4 also contains a 1968-nucleotide 5′-end that extends the region of Stoned B homology by 344 amino acids and continues for 274 amino acids further upstream. The results of these experiments reveal a novel human mRNA, SALF, that is composed of both Stoned B/clathrin AP-like and TFIIAα/β-like sequences. The 3853-bp composite sequence contains a 114-nucleotide 5′-UTR and a 161-nucleotide 3′-UTR with a poly(A) addition signal and a 29-nucleotide poly(A) tract (Fig. 1 B). The deduced ORF commences with a putative start codon (AAGATGT) that is preceded by an in-frame stop codon 27 nucleotides upstream and predicts a 1182-residue polypeptide (Fig.2) with a molecular mass of 132 kDa and a pI of 5.1. Northern blot analysis of human mRNA using a probe from the TFIIAα/β-like region of SALF revealed a 1.8-kb mRNA in testis (see Fig. 5), indicating that this sequence is also present in an mRNA that is substantially shorter than that predicted by SALF. To isolate the 5′-end of the corresponding cDNA, we performed PCR on a human testis cDNA library using gene-specific primers 2a2–20 and 2a2–22 and adapter primers AP1 and AP2. The resulting clone (pRACE22) (Fig. 1 C) contains 298 bp that are identical to SALF and a 35-bp 5′-end that is unique. This new 5′-end consists of a 15-bp UTR, a putative initiation codon (GTCATGG) that conforms to the Kozak concensus ((A/G)NNATGG) (51Kozak M. Nucleic. Acids Res. 1984; 12: 857-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (2376) Google Scholar), and 17 bp downstream of the ATG that predict six amino acids (ACLNPV) not present in SALF. These residues include the conserved valine found at the N terminus of all other TFIIA large subunits (Fig. 3 B). To isolate a complete cDNA, we then performed PCR with the gene-specific primer 2a2–17 and primer AP1. The sequence of the resulting clone (pRACE17) (Fig. 1 C) is identical to the composite SALF sequence except for its unique 5′-end and a longer poly(A) tail (∼90 nucleotides), which begins four nucleotides downstream of the poly(A) tail in SALF. Together, pRACE22 and pRACE17 form a 1617-bp composite cDNA, ALF, that predicts a 478-amino acid polypeptide (Fig. 2) with a molecular mass of 52 kDa and a pI of 4.4.

IRS-1 overexpression dramatically increased basal cytosolic Ca2+ levels from 81 to 278 nm, but it did not affect Ca2+ response to glucose. Overexpression of the insulin receptor also caused an increase in cytosolic Ca2+. Increased cytosolic Ca2+ was due to inhibition of Ca2+ uptake by the endoplasmic reticulum, because endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ uptake and content were reduced in βIRS1-A cells. Fractional insulin secretion was significantly increased 2-fold, and there was a decrease in βIRS1-A insulin content and insulin biosynthesis. Steady-state insulin mRNA levels and glucose-stimulated ATP were unchanged. High IRS-1 levels also reduced β-cell proliferation. These data demonstrate a direct link between the insulin receptor signaling pathway and the Ca2+-dependent pathways regulating insulin secretion of β-cells. We postulate that during regulated insulin secretion, released insulin binds the β-cell insulin receptor and activates IRS-1, thus further increasing cytosolic Ca2+ by reducing Ca2+ uptake. We suggest the existence of a novel pathway of autocrine regulation of intracellular Ca2+homeostasis and insulin secretion in the β-cell of the endocrine pancreas.

We suggest the existence of a novel pathway of autocrine regulation of intracellular Ca2+homeostasis and insulin secretion in the β-cell of the endocrine pancreas. The insulin-secreting β-cell of the endocrine pancreas has a central role in regulating glucose homeostasis (1Newgard C.B. McGarry J.D. Annu. Rev.

It is now recognized that β-cell failure is a major contributing factor to type 2 diabetes mellitus, thus emphasizing the importance of elucidating the normal mechanisms of insulin secretion (3Avruch J.

Glucose oxidation by the β-cell is essential for insulin secretion. In particular, glucokinase, the first step in glycolysis, has been convincingly shown to be the β-cell glucose sensor (5Matschinsky F. Liang Y. Kesavan P. Wang L. Froguel P. Velho G. Cohen D.

The subsequent increase in intracellular Ca2+ then activates insulin exocytosis. The possibility of other signaling pathways involved in glucose-induced insulin secretion has also been suggested (6Henquin J.C.

Abnormal [Ca2+]i is a common defect in both insulin-dependent type 1 diabetes and insulin-independent type 2 diabetes (24Levy J. Gavin III, J.R. Sowers J.R. Am. J. Med. 1994; 96: 260-273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Altered Ca2+ metabolism has also been reported to affect β-cell function including insulin biosynthesis (25Guest P.C. Bailyes E.M. Hutton J.C. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 445-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 26Meldolesi J. Pozzan T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 10-14Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) plays an important role in the regulation of intracellular Ca2+ concentrations (27Prentki M. Janjic D. Biden T.J. Blondel B. Wollheim C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10118-10123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Prentki M. Janjic D. Wollheim C.B. J. Biol.

Endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) is the major calcium pump that sequestrates cytosol Ca2+ into ER lumen (28Prentki M. Janjic D. Wollheim C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14054-14058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Colca J.R. McDonald J.M. Kotagal N. Patke C. Fink C.J. Greider M.H. Lacy P.E. McDaniel M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7223-7228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thapsigargin, a nonphorboid tumor promoter, specifically inhibits ER Ca2+-ATPase activity (31Thastrup O. Cullen P.J. Drobak B.K. Hanley M.R. Dawson A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2466-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (2992) Google Scholar). Addition of thapsigargin to pancreatic β-cells leads to elevated cytosol Ca2+ concentration and enhanced short term glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (32Worley III, J.F. McIntyre M.S. Spencer B. Mertz R.J. Roe M.W. Dukes I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14359-14362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent data showed that IRSs may directly interact with ER Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA1 and SERCA2) in a tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent manner in muscle and heart (33Algenstaedt P. Antonetti D.A. Yaffe M.B. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23696-23702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that insulin may via insulin receptor signaling pathway regulate ER Ca2+-ATPase activity, therefore influencing cellular Ca2+ homeostasis. It is currently unknown whether insulin exerts any regulatory role in β-cell Ca2+ homeostasis. To dissect the role of IRS-1 in β-cell function, we have overexpressed IRS-1 in an insulin-secreting β-cell line. We show that IRS-1 regulates β-cell Ca2+ homeostasis, insulin biosynthesis, and β-cell proliferation and that elevated expression of IRS-1 induces abnormal Ca2+ homeostasis and β-cell dysfunction. The clonal mouse β-cell line βTC6-F7 and culture conditions were previously described (15Xu G.G. Rothenberg P.L. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1243-1252PubMed Google Scholar, 34Knaack D. Fiore D.M. Surana M.

In brief, cells were maintained in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (25 mm glucose; Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), 100 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin and incubated at 37 °C in a 10% CO2/90% air humidified incubator. The Chinese hamster ovary-T cell line was a kind gift from Dr. R. Roth (Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA) and was maintained in F-12 medium with 5% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a 5% CO2/95% air atmosphere. The IRS-1 expression vector was constructed as follows. A 3.9-kilobase DNA fragment containing the mouse IRS-1 cDNA and the c-Myc epitope tag was excised from pQE31-mIRS1 (kindly provided by Dr. Ronald Kahn, Joslin Diabetes Center, Boston, MA) with EcoICRI andHindIII. The fragment was blunt-ended with Klenow fragment (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) and ligated into a SmaI digested vector pCI-Neo (Promega, Madson, WI). The resulting plasmid pCMV-IRS1 was purified with QIAGEN Maxi-purification Kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). Enzymes for recombinant DNA procedures were from Promega or New England Biolabs. Cells were transfected with cationic liposome reagent DMRIE-C (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described before (15Xu G.G. Rothenberg P.L. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1243-1252PubMed Google Scholar). The transfected cells were selected with 500 μg/ml neomycin (Geneticin, Life Technologies, Inc.) for 4 weeks, and the surviving colonies (defined as passage 4) were individually picked and transferred to 24-well plates. Then the IRS-1 and c-Myc protein levels were determined with anti-IRS1 polyclonal antibody (catalog no. 06-248, Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) and anti-c-Myc monoclonal antibody 9E10 (catalog no. sc-40, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), respectively. Preparation of cell lysates, immunoprecipitation, and Western blotting were performed essentially as described previously (12Rothenberg P.L. Willison L.D. Simon J. Wolf B.A. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 802-809Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Konrad R.J. Dean R.M. Young R.A. Billings P.C. Wolf B.A. J. Biol.

Tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were detected with rabbit polyclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody K-18 (kindly provided by Dr. P. Rothenberg, University of Pennsylvania). A secondary antibody, rabbit anti mouse IgG (Sigma, catalog no. M7023), was used for c-Myc antibody immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. Insulin content and secretion assays were performed essentially as described before (12Rothenberg P.L. Willison L.D. Simon J. Wolf B.A. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 802-809Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Konrad R.J. Dean R.M. Young R.A. Billings P.C. Wolf B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24179-24186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The metabolic rate of the β-cells was indirectly measured by the production of formazan, which is produced from 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl-)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) (Sigma) as the cells metabolize glucose. The MTT assay was performed essentially as described (36Mosmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (45867) Google Scholar, 37Gao Z.Y. Konrad R.J. Collins H. Matschinsky F.M. Rothenberg P.L. Wolf B.A. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 854-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In brief, the cells were preincubated in Krebs-Ringer buffer (KRB) (115 mm NaCl, 24 mm NaHCO3, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 25 mm glucose, and 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) for 30 min. Then, MTT was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. Incubation was continued for another 60 min at 37 °C (5% CO2/95% air). The supernatant was removed, and 500 μl of 2-propanol were added to dissolve the formazan. The optical density of the solution was measured at 562 nm in a Microkinetics Plate Reader (Fisher). Cellular contents of nucleotides including ATP were measured by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) as described before (38Wolf B.A. Florholmen J. Turk J. McDaniel M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3565-3575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and extracted with 1 ml of 5% trichloracetic acid. Cells were scraped, transferred to 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes, incubated 5 min at +4 °C, and centrifuged at 14,000 × g (10 min at +4 °C). The supernatant was collected into borosilicate 12 × 75-mm tubes, extracted three times with 1 ml of diethyl ether, and centrifuged, and the ether phase was discarded. Samples (300 μl) and known amounts of standard NAD, ADP, GDP, ATP, GTP, UTP, CTP, and TTP were analyzed on a Varian HPLC apparatus (Varian, Sugarland, Texas), using a 250 × 4.6 mm Partisil SAX (10 μm) column equipped with a guard column. The gradient of solvent A (1.25mNaH2PO4, pH 3.8) over 80 min was as follows: 0 min, 100% water; 1–15 min, 1% A; 25 min, 28% A; 45 min, 32% A; 70 min, 50% A; 70–80 min, 100% A; 80–95 min, 100% water. The flow rate was 1.5 ml/min. Nucleotides were detected by UV spectrophotometry (340 nm) and quantitated by comparison to the corresponding standard curve run in parallel. The typical retention times were as follows : 8 min for NAD, 10 min for AMP, 35 min for ADP, 27 min for GDP, 32 min for UTP, 34.5 min for CTP, 34.8 min for TTP, 40 min for ATP, and 46 min for GTP. For cytosolic free Ca2+ measurement, the cells were seeded on microscope glass coverslips (Fisher) coated with poly-d-lysine (Sigma), and grown for 2 days. Cells were then loaded with the calcium indicator fura-2 for 30 min at 37 °C in 2 ml of KRB plus 0.1% BSA and supplemented with 2.0 μm fura-2 acetoxymethylester (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and 0.2 mg/ml pluronic F-127 (Molecular Probes). The coverslip with the loaded cells was then mounted in a perifusion chamber placed on the homeothermic platform of an inverted Zeiss microscope. The cells were superfused with Krebs-Ringer buffer (0.1% BSA) at 37 °C at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. For experiments using KRB without Ca2+, CaCl2 was omitted and 1 mm EGTA (Sigma) was added to chelate all Ca2+. Ca2+ measurement is as follows and was also described in detail elsewhere (37Gao Z.Y. Konrad R.J. Collins H. Matschinsky F.M. Rothenberg P.L. Wolf B.A. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 854-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 39Gao Z.-Y. Chen M. Collins H.W. Matschinsky F.M. Lee V.M.Y. Wolf B.A. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1998; 10: 2416-2425Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The microscope was used with a × 40 oil objective. Fura-2 was successively excited at 334 and 380 nm by means of two narrow band-pass filters. The emitted fluorescence was filtered through a 520 nm filter, captured with an Attofluor CCD video camera at a resolution of 512 × 480 pixels, digitized into 256 gray levels and analyzed with version 6.00 of the Attofluor RatioVision software (Atto Instruments, Rockville, MD). The concentration of Ca2+ at each pixel was calculated by comparing the ratio of fluorescence to an in vitro two-point calibration curve. The Ca2+ concentration is presented by averaging the values of all pixels of a cell body. Data were collected from at least 10 individual cells in each measurement at an interval of 4.5 s. The endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin was purchased from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA) and dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide. Endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ uptake was measured as described (40Wolf B.A. Comens P.G. Ackermann K.E. Sherman W.R. McDaniel M.L. Biochem. J. 1985; 227: 965-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 41Wolf B.A. Turk J. Sherman W.R. McDaniel M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3501-3511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were trypsinized and washed twice with KRB without Ca2+ or glucose (0.1% BSA). Then, they were permeabilized with 20 μg/ml digitonin (Sigma) in KRB without Ca2+ or glucose (0.1% BSA) at 37 °C for 10 min. The cells were then incubated for 30 min in TES buffer (100 mm TES, pH 7.2, 100 mm KCl, 2.5 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm EGTA, 5 μCi/ml of45Ca (ICN, Lisle, IL), 5 μCi/ml of3H2O (ICN) for diffusible space correction, 5 μg/ml of ruthenium red, 0.1% BSA) at the indicated Ca2+concentration. The incubation medium was removed by aspiration, and the cells were solubilized with 100 μl of 1 m NaOH and neutralized with 100 μl of 1 m HCl. Radioactivity content of the endoplasmic reticulum was measured by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Calcium concentrations were titrated with a calcium electrode (Orion, Beverly, MA). Calculation of endoplasmic reticulum calcium uptake was as described before (41Wolf B.A. Turk J. Sherman W.R. McDaniel M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3501-3511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The rate of insulin biosynthesis was determined with [3H]leucine pulse-chase labeling assay. The cells were seeded in 6-well culture dishes at 3 × 105 cells/well and grown for 2 days in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cells were then washed twice with KRB buffer and labeled with 40 μCi/ml ofl-[3,4,5-3H(N)]leucine (6660 GBq/mmol, NEN Life Science Products) in KRB buffer supplemented with 0.25% BSA and 0 or 16 mm glucose. After being labeled for 30 min, the cells were chased with 1 mm cold leucine for 30 min at the same glucose concentration as used in the labeling process. The cells were then extracted with 1 m acetic acid and sonicated. One hundred μl of the clarified acetic acid extract were used for trichloroacetic acid precipitation as described (15Xu G.G. Rothenberg P.L. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1243-1252PubMed Google Scholar) to determine the total cellular content of 3H-labeled proteins. The 3H-labeled insulin immunoreactive material was immunoprecipitated with 3 μl of undiluted guinea pig anti-bovine insulin serum (ICN) and protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Normal guinea pig serum (Linco, St. Charles, MO) was used as background control. Recovery of insulin immunoreactive material was more than 90% under the assay condition as determined with 125I-labeled insulin. RNA protection assays were performed according to Ambion's protocol (Ambion, Austin, TX). Briefly, the cells were grown in culture medium for 2 days and then trypsinized and washed twice with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline. To 4 × 106 cells, 0.4 ml of Ambion's lysis/denaturation solution (direct protect kit, Ambion) were added to lyse the cells. An insulin probe was generated by in vitro transcription using pGEM-rPPI (gift of Dr. Christopher Rhodes, Joslin Diabetes Center, Boston, MA) as a template. For internal control, a probe for 18 S RNA was obtained by in vitro transcription using pT7RNA18S (Ambion) as a template. Labeling of the 18 S RNA probe was done with [32P]UTP in the presence of 500 μm cold UTP to lower the specific activity. The labeled transcripts were gel purified as described in Ambion's manual. The insulin probe was 430 bases in length and completely complementary to the insulin mRNA. The 18 S rRNA probe was 116 nucleotides in length, 80 of which are complementary to 18 S rRNA (Ambion). Hybridization, RNase and protease digestion, and separation detection were carried out as per Ambion's instructions. The results were quantified with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Data were analyzed by paired ttest or one-way or two-way ANOVA; p ≤ 0.05 was considered significant. Nonlinear regression and curve fitting were performed with PRISM 2.01 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). We overexpressed IRS-1 in a clonal β-cell line βTC6-F7. The exogenous IRS-1 had a c-Myc tag at its C terminus and migrated slightly slower than the endogenous IRS-1 in SDS-gels (Fig. 1 A, lanes 1, 3, and 4). β-IRS1-A, one of the 11 stable transfectants tested, expressed IRS-1 protein two times (199 ± 36%) more than the controls (p = 0.02) (Fig.1 B). Fifty percent of the increase was contributed by the exogenous IRS1-Myc; the other 50% was from the endogenous IRS-1. Addition of 100 nm insulin led to rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins in the 160–180 kDa range that co-migrated with the IRS-1 protein (Fig. 1 C, upper gel, lanes 2, 4, and6) (also see Ref. 12Rothenberg P.L. Willison L.D. Simon J. Wolf B.A. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 802-809Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A 120-kDa protein (p120) was also heavily tyrosine-phosphorylated in the β-cells. The abundance of p120 and its extent of tyrosine phosphorylation are relatively stable in the three β-cell lines (Fig. 1 C and data not shown), and it was therefore used to normalize the level of IRS-1 phosphorylation. Normalized level of IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation in the βIRS1-A cells was 2-fold higher than that in the control cells (Fig. 1,C, upper gel, lane 4, and D). This is proportional to the elevated IRS-1 protein level in the βIRS1-A cells. These data demonstrated that the excess IRS-1 was tyrosine-phosphorylated to the same extent as the endogenous substrate upon insulin stimulation. Nine of the transfected clones that showed detectable c-Myc signal and increased IRS-1 levels, including βIRS1-A, were tested for their insulin content. They all exhibited lowered insulin content. Data from the βIRS1-A clone are shown in Fig.2. The βIRS1-A cells had significantly lowered insulin content: 29.0 ± 2.9 ng/105 cellsversus 114 ± 2.2 ng/105 cells (Neo control), p = 0.0001 (Fig. 2 A). Net insulin secretion was also reduced 61% at 0 mm glucose (G0) and 58% at 15 mm glucose (G15) (Fig. 2 B). Insulin secretion of both βIRS1-A and control cell lines was glucose- and extracellular calcium-dependent. Removal of extracellular Ca2+ and addition of 1 mm EGTA completely abolished glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Addition of either the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin (100 nm) or the p70 ribosomal S6 protein kinase inhibitor rapamycin (100 nm) did not change insulin content and secretion of βIRS1-A cells (data not shown). Although the net amount of insulin secreted by the IRS-1-overproducing cells was reduced as mentioned above, glucose-stimulated fractional insulin secretion (the ratio of secreted insulin/total insulin content, expressed as a percentage) was significantly increased in βIRS1-A cells (Fig. 2 C). This increased fractional insulin secretion was glucose-dependent. At 0 mm glucose, fractional insulin secretion of the βIRS1-A cells (4.3 ± 0.9%) was not significantly different from that of the Neo control (3.0 ± 0.6%) (p > 0.5). At glucose concentrations above 1 mm (stimulatory glucose concentrations for this β-cell line), fractional insulin secretions were increased more than 2-fold compared with the Neo control (Fig. 2C) (p < 0.04). These data indicate that overexpression of IRS-1 may enhance the capacity of the β-cell to secrete insulin under stimulatory glucose concentrations. Neither wortmannin (100 nm) nor rapamycin (100 nm) affected glucose-stimulated fractional insulin secretion (data not shown). To determine whether the reduced insulin content and secretion were due to reduced glucose sensitivity, we examined glucose responsiveness of the IRS-1-overproducing β-cells. Glucose strongly stimulates β-cell metabolism, and its effect is reflected by the MTT assay (36Mosmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (45867) Google Scholar, 37Gao Z.Y. Konrad R.J. Collins H. Matschinsky F.M. Rothenberg P.L. Wolf B.A. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 854-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 A, addition of 15 mm glucose doubled MTT values in both the βIRS1-A and the Neo control cells. No significant difference was detected between the two cell lines. Glucose metabolism also results in the production of ATP. An increased cellular ATP/ADP ratio is a critical event triggering glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. To determine whether IRS-1 overexpression affects the ability of the β-cell to produce ATP upon glucose stimulation, we measured cellular nucleotide contents using HPLC. As indicated in Fig. 3 B, glucose increased cellular ATP content in both Neo control and βIRS1-A cells: 1.7 ± 0.3- and 2.0 ± 0.4-fold increase respectively. No statistical difference was detected (p > 0.05). Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion was also measured at different glucose concentrations ranging from 0 to 30 mm. Insulin secretion at 30 mm glucose was set as th"

We recently reported that human alveolar macrophages do not express AP-1 DNA binding activity (Monick, M. M., Carter, A. B., Gudmundsson, G., Geist, L. J., and Hunninghake, G. W. (1998) Am. J. Physiol. 275, L389—L397). To determine why alveolar macrophages do not express AP-1 DNA binding activity, we first showed that there was not a decrease in expression of the FOS and JUN proteins that make up the AP-1 complex. There was, however, a significant difference in the amounts of the nuclear protein, REF-1 (which regulates AP-1 DNA binding by altering the redox status of FOS and JUN proteins), in alveolar macrophages compared with monocytes. In addition, in vitrodifferentiation of monocytes to a macrophage-like cell resulted in decreased amounts of REF-1. Finally, addition of REF-1 from activated monocytes to alveolar macrophage nuclear proteins resulted in a marked increase in AP-1 DNA binding. These studies strongly suggest that the process of differentiation of monocytes into alveolar macrophages is associated with a loss of REF-1 and AP-1 activity.

Immunol. 1990; 144: 4320-4326PubMed Google Scholar) and a study by Monick et al. (11Monick M.M. Carter A.B. Gudmundsson G. Geist L.J. Hunninghake G.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L389-L397Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both of these studies noted that normal alveolar macrophages had a decreased capacity to express protein kinase C activity, compared with monocytes or other macrophages. In the study by Monick et al. (11Monick M.M. Carter A.B. Gudmundsson G. Geist L.J. Hunninghake G.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L389-L397Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we also found that normal human alveolar macrophages had a decreased capacity to express protein kinase C-induced AP-1 DNA binding. There are a number of FOS- and JUN-like proteins that can form the heterodimers or homodimers that make up the AP-1 complexes (17Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2258) Google Scholar, 18Karin M. Liu Z. Zandi E. Curr. Opin.

The classic complex is comprised of c-FOS and c-JUN, and these proteins are found in the nucleus of cells. AP-1 activity can be regulated at many levels, including transcription of genes that code for AP-1 proteins, message stability, and translation of the mRNAs. AP-1 activity is also regulated by the composition of the AP-1 complexes, phosphorylation of the proteins, and redox regulation of cysteine residues in the AP-1 proteins (17Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2258) Google Scholar, 18Karin M. Liu Z. Zandi E. Curr. Opin.

Colburn N.H. Sobel M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9401-9404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The redox status of the AP-1 protein complex determines the binding of AP-1 to DNA. A dual function nuclear protein called REF-1 (or apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease DNA repair enzyme) regulates the binding activity of AP-1 (22Xanthoudakis S. Miao G. Wang F. Pan Y.C. Curran T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3323-3335Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar, 23Xanthoudakis S. Curran T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 653-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar, 24Xanthoudakis S. Miao G.G.

A. 1997; 94: 3633-3638Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). This protein has two distinct and separate functions that involve different parts of the protein. REF-1 repairs apurinic/apyrimidinic sites in DNA, and it is activated by thioredoxin to reduce cysteine residues on both FOS and JUN enabling DNA binding by AP-1 (22Xanthoudakis S. Miao G. Wang F. Pan Y.C. Curran T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3323-3335Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar, 23Xanthoudakis S. Curran T.

A. 1997; 94: 3633-3638Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). This study analyzed possible mechanisms for the lack of AP-1 DNA binding in alveolar macrophages. We found no differences in expression of c-FOS or c-JUN proteins in alveolar macrophages compared with monocytes at base line or after protein kinase C stimulation. We did find that alveolar macrophages are deficient in REF-1. Reconstituting alveolar macrophage nuclear proteins with monocyte-derived REF-1 reconstituted AP-1 binding activity. In addition, when monocytes were allowed to differentiate into macrophages, in vitro, they lost REF-1 and the ability to respond to PMA 1The abbreviations used are: PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; RPMI, Roswell Park Memorial Institute; LPS, lipopolysaccharide. with increased AP-1 binding. We conclude that the process of differentiation of monocytes into alveolar macrophages is accompanied by a loss of REF-1, affecting AP-1 binding and subsequent expression of AP-1-driven genes. Alveolar macrophages were obtained from bronchoalveolar lavage as described previously (5Hempel S.L. Monick M.M. He B. Yano T. Hunninghake G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32979-32984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, normal volunteers with a lifetime non-smoking history, no acute or chronic illness, and no current medications, underwent bronchoalveolar lavage. The lavage procedure used five 25-ml aliquots of sterile, warmed saline in each of three segments of the lung. The lavage fluid was filtered through two layers of gauze and centrifuged at 1500 × g for 5 min. The cell pellet was washed twice in Hanks' balanced salt solution without Ca2+and Mg2+ and suspended in complete medium, Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) tissue culture medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), with 5% fetal calf serum (HyClone, Logan, UT) and added gentamycin (80 μg/ml). Differential cell counts were determined using a Wright-Giemsa-stained cytocentrifuge preparation. All cell preparations had between 90 and 100% alveolar macrophages. This study was approved by the Committee for Investigations Involving Human Subjects at the University of Iowa. 180 ml of heparinized blood was obtained by venipuncture of the same volunteers who underwent bronchoscopy. Monocytes were isolated using a Ficoll-Paque gradient (Sigma). After harvesting the mononuclear cell layer, cells were washed four times in phosphate-buffered saline and then resuspended in RPMI medium. Additional purification was obtained by a 1-h adherence at 37 oC. Non-adherent cells were then washed off, and RPMI medium was added back to the adherent cells. In some instances the monocytes were allowed to differentiate into more macrophage-like cells. In order to do this, adherent monocytes were cultured in RPMI with 10% added human AB serum for a period of 7–10 days. At the end of that period, floating cells were washed off, and the remaining adherent cells had spread out and obtained the pancake-like appearance of macrophages. Alveolar macrophages and monocytes were cultured for 3 h with or without 100 ng/ml PMA. The nuclear pellets were prepared by resuspending cells in 0.4 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 10 mm KCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA), placing them on ice for 15 min, and then vigorously mixing after the addition of 25 μl of 10% Nonidet P-40. After a 30-s centrifugation (16,000 × g, 4 °C), the pelleted nuclei were resuspended in 50 μl of extraction buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 50 mm KCl, 300 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol) and incubated on ice for 20 min. Nuclear extracts were stored at 70 °C. The DNA binding reaction (electrophoretic mobility shift assay) was done at room temperature in a mixture containing 5 μg of nuclear proteins, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 15,000 cpm of32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probe for 30 min. The samples were fractionated through a 5% polyacrylamide gel in 1× TBE (Tris base 6.05 g/liter, boric acid 3.06 g/liter, EDTA-Na2·H2O 0.37 g/liter). Sequence of the nucleotide was 5′-CGCTTGATGAGTCAGCCGGAA-3′ (AP-1). Experiments were repeated 3 times. Supershift assays were performed by incubating the nuclear protein with antibodies specific for c-FOS and c-JUN (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for 30 min at room temperature before the addition of the labeled DNA probe. Specific c-FOS and c-JUN proteins are indicated by a higher band on the gel and by an overall decrease in binding. Whole-cell RNA was isolated using RNA Stat-60 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Tel-Test “B”, Friendswood, TX). The isolated RNA was fractionated in a 1.5% denaturing agarose gel containing 2.2m formaldehyde. An RNA ladder (0.24–9.5 kilobase pairs; Life Technologies, Inc.) was included as a molecular size standard. RNA loading was confirmed by equivalent ethidium bromide staining in each lane. The RNAs were transferred to GeneScreen Plus (NEN Life Science Products) as suggested by the manufacturer. c-FOS and c-JUN cDNA probes (generated by polymerase chain reaction with primers obtained from CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) were labeled with [γ-32P]CTP (NEN Life Science Products) by the random primer method. Blots were prehybridized for 3 h at 42 °C (formamide 10 ml, NaCl 5 mm, 50% dextran 4 ml, 10% SDS, Tris, pH 7.0, 1 m, and 0.4 ml 50× Denhardt's solution) and then hybridized with the labeled probe overnight at 42 °C. The filters were washed twice with 1× SSC at 25 °C, twice with 1× SSC plus 1% SDS at 65 °C, and then once with 0.1× SSC at 25 °C. The filters were exposed to autoradiographic film at −70 °C. For these studies, alveolar macrophages and monocytes were cultured for 3 h with or without PMA (10 or 100 ng/ml). At the end of the culture period, either whole-cell protein extracts or nuclear protein extracts (see gel shift protocol) were obtained as described previously (11Monick M.M. Carter A.B. Gudmundsson G. Geist L.J. Hunninghake G.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L389-L397Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cell material was sonicated 15 s on ice, allowed to sit for 20 min, and then centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min. An aliquot of the supernatant was used to determine protein concentration by the Coomassie Blue method. Equal amounts of protein (100 μg for whole cell extracts and 20 μg for nuclear extracts) were mixed 1:1 with 2× sample buffer and loaded onto a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and run at 80 V for 2 h. Cell proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) overnight at 30 V and visualized using c-FOS, c-JUN, or REF-1-specific antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Immunoreactive bands were developed using a chemiluminescent substrate (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In order to evaluate the effect of PMA (a model of protein kinase C-driven activation) on AP-1 DNA binding in monocytes and alveolar macrophages from the same individual, cells were cultured for 3 h with and without PMA (10 ng/ml) and LPS (1 μg/ml) for 3 h. Nuclear proteins were isolated, and DNA binding was evaluated in a standard gel shift assay. In Fig.1 A, we show that PMA caused an increase in protein binding to the AP-1 consensus sequence with nuclear protein from monocytes and but not with nuclear protein from alveolar macrophages. LPS did not increase AP-1 binding in monocytes or alveolar macrophages. In Fig. 1 B, we use cold competition to show that it is the upper band (seen only with monocyte samples) that can be competed off with cold AP-1 oligonucleotide. In order to confirm that the alveolar macrophages were functional, we also evaluated binding to the NF-κB sequence. We showed that LPS increases both monocyte and alveolar macrophage nuclear protein binding to the NF-κB consensus sequence (data not shown). In Fig. 2, we show that PMA causes an increase in AP-1 binding in monocytes over a prolonged time course (0.5–6 h). At none of these time points was there the appearance of AP-1 binding activity in alveolar macrophages. These data show that the difference in AP-1 binding activity between monocytes and macrophages is not simply a function of different response times. One possible explanation for the lack of AP-1 DNA binding in alveolar macrophages is that alveolar macrophages do not make the same amounts of AP-1 proteins as monocytes. We initially evaluated the composition of the PMA-induced AP-1-binding proteins in monocytes with a supershift assay. Both the upward shift of the band and the decrease in binding shown in Fig.3 demonstrate that the monocyte AP-1 complex includes both c-FOS and c-JUN proteins. We next analyzed both cell types for the production of specific c-FOS and c-JUN mRNAs. Cells were cultured for 3 h, as in the gel shift experiments, and then harvested- and whole-cell RNA was extracted (Fig.4 A). Both monocytes and alveolar macrophages responded to PMA with increased amounts of c-FOS and c-JUN message. Compared with monocytes, the alveolar macrophages show increased amounts of both c-FOS and c-JUN mRNA. We next evaluated c-FOS and c-JUN proteins in PMA-treated cells. Both alveolar macrophages and monocytes responded to PMA with increases in amounts of c-FOS and c-JUN proteins (Fig. 4 B). These experiments suggest that the decreased AP-1 binding to DNA observed in alveolar macrophages is not due to a lack of the appropriate AP-1 proteins.Figure 4PMA induces increased c-FOS and c-JUN mRNA and protein in both monocytes and alveolar macrophages.Monocytes and alveolar macrophages were cultured with LPS (1 μg/ml) or PMA (100 ng/ml) for 3 h. A, whole cell RNA was obtained and run out on a 1.5% formaldehyde gel. A Northern blot was obtained and probed with 32P-labeled c-DNA, specific for c-FOS and c-JUN. This is an autoradiogram of the labeled blot.B, whole-cell protein from cells treated identically to the mRNA cells was isolated and run out on a 10% polyacrylamide-SDS gel. Western analysis was performed, and c-FOS and c-JUN were visualized using c-FOS- and c-JUN-specific antibodies and chemiluminescence. These are autoradiograms of the immunoreactive bands.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Binding of AP-1 proteins to the DNA is determined not only by presence of the transcription factor but also by its redox state that is regulated by REF-1. In order to determine if the observed differences in AP-1 binding between monocytes and alveolar macrophages could be explained by differences in amounts of the protein REF-1, we obtained nuclear protein from both alveolar macrophages and monocytes from three different individuals. Western analysis for REF-1 was performed, and the results are shown in Fig.5, A and B. In all three individuals there was significantly more REF-1 in the nuclei of monocytes than in the nuclei of alveolar macrophages. This experiment provided a possible explanation for the lack of AP-1 binding observed in PMA-treated alveolar macrophages. In order to make sure that treatment of the cells is not changing the amounts of REF-1, we evaluated REF-1 protein levels in both alveolar macrophages and monocytes that were treated with either LPS or PMA for 3 h. As shown in Fig. 6, neither LPS nor PMA altered the amounts of REF-1 in the cells.Figure 6LPS and PMA do not change the amounts of REF-1 in either alveolar macrophages or monocytes. Nuclear protein was isolated from monocytes and alveolar macrophages after 3 h of treatment with either LPS (1 μg/ml) or PMA (100 ng/ml). Western analysis was performed on 20 μg/sample of nuclear protein. REF-1 was visualized using an REF-1-specific antibody and chemiluminescence. This is an autoradiogram of the immunoreactive bands.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We next performed an experiment that links differentiation of monocytes to the defect in AP-1 DNA binding seen in alveolar macrophages. As an in vitrocorrelate of the in vivo differentiation of monocytes into alveolar macrophages, we evaluated the amount of REF-1 in the nucleus of differentiated monocytes and the ability of PMA to induce AP-1 binding in differentiated monocytes. In order to do this, we obtained blood monocytes and harvested nuclear protein from half the cells immediately after isolation. The remaining cells were put into culture with 10% human AB serum for 7 days. At the end of this time period, the cells morphologically resembled macrophages and nuclear protein was isolated. Fig. 7 shows that the process of differentiation into macrophage-like cells is associated with decreased amounts of REF-1. Fig. 8 is an AP-1 gel shift with PMA-treated nuclear proteins from monocytes compared with differentiated monocytes. The differentiated monocytes have lost their ability to increase AP-1 binding with PMA. There is more AP-1 binding in the control differentiated monocytes than in the control undifferentiated monocytes. This could just be a function of the difference between in vitro differentiation and in vivo differentiation. As a composite these two experiments show that with differentiation monocytes have reduced amounts of REF-1 and do not respond to PMA with increased AP-1 DNA binding.Figure 8In vitro differentiation of monocytes results in a decreased amount of PMA-induced AP-1 binding. Monocytes were harvested and either treated immediately with PMA (100 ng/ml) and nuclear protein isolated or cultured for 7 days on plastic, followed by 3 h incubation with PMA (100 ng/ml), followed by isolation of nuclear protein. A gel shift assay, as described for Fig. 1, was then performed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The second experiment to link a defect in AP-1 binding to REF-1 was performed in alveolar macrophages. Both monocytes and alveolar macrophages were cultured with and without PMA, and nuclear protein was isolated. We next immunoprecipitated REF-1 from 20 μg of monocyte nuclear extract and added it to the macrophage nuclear proteins 15 min before addition of the labeled probe and allowed to sit at room temperature. Fig.9 shows that PMA-treated macrophages alone do not exhibit significant amounts of AP-1 DNA binding (2nd lane) and that the addition of monocyte REF-1 results in AP-1 binding (3rd lane). The amount of AP-1 binding in the control alveolar macrophage is a function of the variation found between individuals. Some people showed no AP-1 binding, and others showed a small amount of base-line binding. None of the individuals studied showed any increase in binding with the addition of PMA. We also performed a number of controls as follows: the4th lane contains macrophage nuclear extract with monocyte protein precipitated with an isotype control antibody (rabbit IgG), the 5th lane contains macrophage nuclear protein with monocyte protein precipitated with an irrelevant antibody (αp65, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and the 6th lane contains immunoprecipitated monocyte REF-1 with no macrophage nuclear protein. Also shown on this blot is an AP-1 gel shift of the monocyte nuclear protein used for the immunoprecipitations. This figure shows that AP-1 proteins from PMA-treated alveolar macrophages can bind to DNA after monocyte REF-1 has been added. This study shows that the defect in protein kinase C-induced AP-1 DNA binding activity seen in normal alveolar macrophages, compared with monocytes, is due to a relative lack of the redox protein, REF-1, and is not due to a lack of AP-1 proteins. We were able to reconstitute normal AP-1 DNA binding in alveolar macrophage nuclear extracts by adding REF-1 from monocytes. This was specific for AP-1, since the DNA binding activity of NF-κB was similar in alveolar macrophages and monocytes. This loss of REF-1 in alveolar macrophages may be due to the process of macrophage differentiation since monocytes lost REF-1 as they differentiated in vitro, into macrophage-like cells. To our knowledge, this study is the first description of normal cells with a defect in AP-1 binding caused by a lack of REF-1. AP-1 is an important regulator of expression of many genes. The relative lack of REF-1 and AP-1 DNA binding activity may explain, in part, the functional differences between alveolar macrophages and their precursors, monocytes. REF-1 is a ubiquitous nuclear protein found in mammalian nuclear extracts. It was initially studied for its DNA repair function, which is found at the C-terminal portion of the molecule. The redox regulator, located close to the N terminus, is structurally and functionally distinct from the DNA portion of the molecule (35Rothwell D.G. Barzilay G. Gorman M. Morera S. Freemont P. Hickson I.D. Oncol. Res. 1997; 9: 275-280PubMed Google Scholar, 36Abate L. Patel L. Rauscher F.J. Currau T. Science. 1990; 249: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar). REF-1, itself, is controlled by redox modification of cysteines by the protein, thioredoxin (25Hirota K. Matsui M. Iwata S. Nishiyama A. Mori K. Yodoi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3633-3638Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). REF-1 controls the DNA binding capacity of FOS and JUN proteins through conserved cysteine residues flanked by basic amino acids found in the DNA binding domain of all FOS- and JUN-related proteins (37Kerppola T.K. Curran T. Science. 1991; 254: 1210-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 38Kerppola T.K. Curran T. Cell. 1991; 66: 317-326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). There are only a few previously described instances of modulation of the expression of REF-1. Fung et al. (26Fung H. Kow Y.W. Van Houten B. Taatjes D.J. Hatahet Z. Janssen Y.M. Vacek P. Faux S.P. Mossman B.T. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 189-194PubMed Google Scholar) showed that asbestos caused an increase in REF-1 gene expression in mesothelial cells. Asai et al. (27Asai T. Kambe F. Kikumori T. Seo H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 71-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) showed that thyrotropin increased REF-1 mRNA and protein in rat thyroid FRTL-5 cells, and Suzuki et al. (28Suzuki S. Nagaya T. Suganuma N. Tomoda Y. Seo H. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1998; 44: 217-224PubMed Google Scholar) showed that human chorionic gonadotropin increased REF-1 in murine Leydig cells. In an animal model, Gillardonet al. (29Gillardon F. Bottiger B. Hossmann K.A. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1997; 52: 194-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) showed that global ischemia induced by cardiac arrest increased expression of REF-1 in the rat hippocampus. All of these studies are cases in which an intervention results in an increase in REF-1 expression. In contrast to these studies, Robertson et al. (30Robertson K.A. Hill D.P. Xu Y. Liu L. Van Epps S. Hockenbery D.M. Park J.R. Wilson T.M. Kelley M.R. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 443-449PubMed Google Scholar) showed that induction of apoptosis in HL-60 cells results in down-regulation of REF-1. Walton et al. (31Walton M. Lawlor P. Sirimanne E. Williams C. Gluckman P. Dragunow M. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1997; 44: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) evaluated rat brains following ischemia and found that apoptotic cells had a significant decrease in amounts of REF-1. One possible explanation for our data is that the alveolar macrophages are undergoing apoptosis. This is not likely since all studies of normal human alveolar macrophages reported to date showed that the cells must be exposed to a toxic stimulus to trigger apoptosis. We showed in a number of studies that alveolar macrophages are not activated, unless they are exposed to endotoxin or another stimulus in vitro (5Hempel S.L. Monick M.M. He B. Yano T.

Dis. 1996; 174: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Our studies evaluated REF-1 immediately after the cells were obtained from normal volunteers. These observations are supported by observations of Bingisser et al. (34Bingisser R. Stey C. Weller M. Groscurth P. Russi E. Frei K. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1996; 15: 64-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) who showed that unstimulated normal human alveolar macrophages do not undergo apoptosis but that apoptosis could be induced in human alveolar macrophages by high levels of endotoxin. These studies are the first to show that a normal cell can be deficient in REF-1 and that this can result in a defect in AP-1 DNA binding. These studies also suggest that it is the process of differentiation that results in the decreased levels of REF-1 in alveolar macrophages. The findings that we describe in this study may explain some of the functional differences between alveolar macrophages and their precursors blood monocytes."

The expression of both proteins can be induced in response to all-trans-retinoic acid (atRA). By using an RARα-selective antagonist (Ro 41-5253), we demonstrated that RARβ expression was induced by atRA through an RARα-dependent signaling pathway and that RARβ induction was correlated with IGFBP-3 induction. However, MCF-7 cells transfected with sense RARβ cDNA expressed IGFBP-3 even in the presence of the RARα-selective antagonist Ro 41-5253. On the other hand, antisense RARβ cDNA transfection of MCF-7 cells blocked atRA-induced IGFBP-3 expression, indicating that RARβ is directly involved in the mediation of IGFBP-3 induction by atRA. Induction of IGFBP-3 expression by atRA occurs at the transcriptional level, as measured by nuclear run-on assays. Finally, we showed that atRA-induced IGFBP-3 is functionally active in modulating the growth-promoting effect of IGF-I. These experiments indicate that RARα and RARβ, both individually and together, are important in mammary gland homeostasis and breast cancer development. By linking IGFBP-3 to RARβ, our experiments define the signal intersection between the retinoid and IGF systems in cell growth regulation and explain why loss of RARβ might be critical in breast cancer carcinogenesis/progression.

Retinoids induce growth inhibition and apoptosis in a variety of tumor cells, including breast cancer cells (1Hong W.K. Itri L.M. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids.

Recently, we proposed a mechanism by which all-trans-retinoic acid (atRA) 1The abbreviations used are: atRA, all-trans-retinoic acid; RAR, retinoic acid receptor; RXR, retinoid X receptor; IGF, insulin-like growth factor; IGFBP, insulin-like growth factor-binding protein; rhIGFBP-3, recombinant human IGFBP-3; CMV, cytomegalovirus. synergizes with interferon to inhibit the growth of both estrogen receptor-positive and estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer cell lines (2Shang Y.

Here we studied mechanisms by which atRA counteracts the growth-promoting effects of insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) in breast cancer cells, focusing on the involvement by retinoic acid receptors (RARs). It is known that the molecular actions of retinoids are primarily mediated by their nuclear receptors (RARα, β and γ, and the retinoid X receptors (RXRs) α, β, and γ), which function as liganded transcription factors (3Glass C.K. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 222-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). These receptors show both spatiotemporal patterns of expression during development and tissue-specific distribution in adults, suggesting that the various receptors play different roles in transducing retinoid signals. Among the RARs, RARα is expressed ubiquitously in adult tissues, RARγ is expressed mainly in skin, and RARβ is expressed primarily in epithelial cells, including those in mammary tissue (4Swisshelm K. Ryan K. Lee X. Tsou H.C. Peacocke M. Sager R. Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 5: 133-141PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of RARβ is lost in the majority of breast cancer cell lines; it can be induced by retinoic acid (RA) in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cell lines but not in estrogen receptor-negative cancer cell lines (4Swisshelm K. Ryan K. Lee X. Tsou H.C. Peacocke M. Sager R. Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 5: 133-141PubMed Google Scholar, 5van der Berg B. van der Leede B.-J.M. Kwakkenbos-Isbrucker L.

The latter are believed to represent more advanced forms of breast carcinoma. Induction of RARβ expression correlates well with the growth-inhibitory and apoptotic effects of retinoic acid (8Seewaldt V.L. Johnson B.S. Parker M.B. Collins S.J. Swisshelm K. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1077-1088PubMed Google Scholar,9Liu Y. Lee M.-O. Wang H.-G. Li Y. Hashimoto Y. Klaus M. Reed J.C. Zhang X.-K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 16: 1138-1149Crossref Scopus (330) Google Scholar), suggesting that loss of RARβ expression may be one of the critical events involved in breast carcinogenesis/progression and in responsiveness of breast cancer cells to retinoid chemotherapy. At the same time, there is strong evidence that RARα is the mediator of the growth inhibition of breast cancer cells by retinoids (10Fitzgerald P. Teng M. Chandraratna R.A.S. Heyman R.A. Allegretto E.A. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2642-2650PubMed Google Scholar, 11Sheikh M.S. Shao Z.-M. Li X.-S. Dawson M. Jetten A.M. Wu S. Conley B.A. Garcia M. Rochefort H. Fontana J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21440-21447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In general, RARα expression is lower in estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer cell lines than in estrogen receptor-positive lines; this corresponds to the responsiveness of these cell lines to RA. Taken together, these observations raise the possibility that both RARα and RARβ are involved in the physiological action of retinoic acid in breast cancer cells. The insulin-like growth factor system includes IGF-I and IGF-II, their corresponding receptors, six IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs), and four IGFBP-related proteins (12Murphy L.J. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 21: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). IGF-I and IGF-II are thought to be important growth factors for breast cancer. IGF-I and -II receptors and IGFBP-2 and -4 proteins have been found in breast cancer cell lines and in tissue specimens (13Gebauer G. Jager W. Lang N. Anticancer Res. 1998; 18: 1191-1195PubMed Google Scholar). Although IGF-I and -II proteins are not expressed in breast cancer cell lines, they are expressed in breast cancer specimens, possibly by stromal cells (13Gebauer G. Jager W. Lang N. Anticancer Res. 1998; 18: 1191-1195PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that IGFs, through a paracrine mechanism, promote breast cancer cell growth and underscoring the importance of IGFBPs for their ability to modulate IGF-I actions in the extracellular matrix. In addition to the well established roles of IGFBPs in regulating IGF bioavailability and IGF-I receptor responsiveness to IGF-I, IGFBP-3 has also been recently proposed to function as a negative regulator of growth, independently of the IGF-I receptor (14Cohen P. Lamson G. Okajima T. Rosenfeld R.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 380-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 15Sell C. Rubini M. Rubin R. Liu J.-P. Estratiadis A. Baserga R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11217-11221Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). Supporting its role as a growth inhibitory regulator, IGFBP-3 expression is up-regulated by growth-inhibitory (and apoptosis-inducing) agents, such as retinoic acid (16Gucev Z.S. Oh Y. Kelley K.M.

Dermatol. 1995; 105: 602-607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). All of this information clearly indicates that IGFBP-3 is a common downstream effector of many growth regulatory agents. We report here that both RARα and RARβ, by relaying the atRA signal in MCF-7 cells, are involved in the induction of IGFBP-3, and our experiments suggest that lack of RARβ expression in the majority of breast cancer cell lines may result in the failure of IGFBP-3 induction and growth inhibition by retinoids. Cells of the breast carcinoma cell line MCF-7 (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were grown in phenol red-free Eagle's minimal essential medium (Sigma) supplemented with 5% charcoal-stripped calf serum (Sigma). Cells from <15 passages were used for experiments. atRA was purchased from Sigma. The RAR-specific agonist Ro 13-7410, the RXR-specific agonist Ro 25-7386, and the RARα-selective antagonist Ro 41-5253 were generously provided by Hoffmann-La Roche. Retinoids were dissolved in absolute ethanol under lights that were covered with a UV-blocking film (CLHC, Sydlin, Inc., Lancaster, PA). The integrity of atRA was routinely monitored by spectrophotometry. MCF-7 cells were grown as described above for 24 h, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and then transferred to phenol red-free Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 2 μg/ml fibronectin and 2 μg/ml transferrin (both from Sigma) for another 24 h before atRA treatment. The conditioned medium was then harvested with the addition of 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 10 μg/ml aprotinin (both from Sigma), dried under speed vacuum, and resuspended for analysis. MCF-7 cells (4 × 103 cells/well) were cultured in the conditioned medium described above in 96-well cell culture plates. Recombinant human IGF-I, recombinant human IGFBP-3 (both generous gifts of Celtrix, Palo Alto, CA), or medium from atRA-treated cell cultures was added alone or in different combinations to the cell cultures for 2 days. Cells were washed, fixed with 10% trichloroacetic acid for 1 h, and then stained with 1% sulforhodamine B for 1 h. Cells were washed again, and then 100 μl of 10 μm Tris-HCl, pH 10, was added to release the dye (28Skehan P. Storeng R. Scudiero D. Monks A. McMahon J. Vistica D. Warren J.T. Bokesch H. Kenney S. Boyd M.B. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1990; 82: 1107-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (8938) Google Scholar). The absorbance was measured at 562 nm. Conditioned medium from atRA-treated or untreated cells was incubated with 2 μg/ml of anti-IGFBP-3 antibodies (goat polyclonal antibodies against human IGFBP-3; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) or normal goat serum (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 2 h. Protein A/Protein G PLUS-Agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) then was added, and the media were rocked at 4 °C overnight followed by filter sterilization of the supernatants. Immunoprecipitates were boiled for 3 min in SDS gel loading buffer and were used in a Western ligand blotting. Fifty μg of protein from cell lysates or conditioned medium was loaded onto 8–12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels under nonreducing conditions. After transfer, nitrocellulose blots were incubated with rabbit polyclonal antibodies against human RARβ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The blots were then incubated with secondary antibodies and developed using an ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For Western ligand blotting, nitrocellulose blots were initially washed in 3% Nonidet P-40 (Fluka Chemical Corp., Ronkonkoma, NY) for 30 min, followed by blocking in 1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) for 2 h and 0.1% Tween 20 (Sigma) for 15 min. Blots were then probed with 125I-labeled recombinant human IGF-II (Bachem California Inc., Torrance, CA) overnight followed by extensive washing with 1% Tween 20 before autoradiography. A luciferase reporter gene construct under the control of a retinoic acid response element (DR5-tk-Luc, provided by Dr. R. M. Evans, Gene Expression Laboratory, Salk Institute for Biological Studies, La Jolla, CA) was used to measure retinoid receptor-mediated gene activation. Ten μg of DR5-tk-Luc was co-transfected into MCF-7 cells with 2 μg of β-galactosidase expression vector (pCMVβ; CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) using Lipofectin reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Transfection efficiency was normalized to β-galactosidase activity. Plasmid constructs for stable transfection experiments were pRC/CMV-RARβ and pRC/CMV-antisense RARβ (generous gifts from Dr. X.-K. Zhang, La Jolla Cancer Research Center, La Jolla, CA). MCF-7 cells grown to 50% confluence were washed with serum-free growth medium. Two μg of either empty vector or construct was mixed with Lipofectin reagent and added to cells for 5 h. Selection was initiated with 400 μg/ml of G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) on the third day and continued for 17–21 days until drug-resistant colonies emerged. Single colonies were cloned and assayed for the expression of the inserted genes by Northern blotting, and the expression of RARβ receptor protein was measured by Western blotting. Total RNA was isolated using TRI Reagent (Sigma). RNA was separated on 1% agarose/1.1 mformaldehyde gels and then transferred and cross-linked to GeneScreen nylon membranes (NEN Life Science Products). Hybridization was carried out using the following probes: T4 polynucleotide kinase-labeled 40-mer antisense RARα, RARβ, or β-actin DNA (Oncogene Research Products, Cambridge, MA) or random primer-labeled IGFBP-3 cDNA (Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, CA). The results were analyzed with a phosphorimager (Bio-Rad). MCF-7 cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2 and 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40. Lysates were centrifuged for 5 min at 500 × g and 4 °C. Nuclei were resuspended in 150 μl of glycerol storage buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 40% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm EDTA and were frozen in liquid nitrogen. Nuclear run-on assays were performed using 5 × 107 frozen nuclei and 10 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Irvine, CA). Newly transcribed RNA was hybridized to the IGFBP-3 cDNA that was immobilized on nylon membranes. The results were analyzed using a PC molecular imager. To determine the effects of atRA on the expression of IGFBP-3 in our experimental system, MCF-7 cells were grown in the presence of 0, 10−9, 10−8, 10−7, or 10−6m atRA for 72 h followed by Northern blotting analysis of IGFBP-3 mRNA. As shown in Fig.1 A, MCF-7 cells did not express IGFBP-3 message in the absence of atRA, but as little as 10−8m atRA was effective in inducing the expression of IGFBP-3 mRNA. Higher levels of IGFBP-3 mRNA were detected with increasing concentrations of atRA (Fig. 1 A). Fig. 1 B shows the temporal effect of 10−6m atRA on the expression of IGFBP-3 message. IGFBP-3 mRNA was detected as early as 24 h after atRA treatment and was maximal at 48 h. We next wished to determine whether the retinoic acid-induced expression of IGFBP-3 in MCF-7 cells was mediated by RAR or RXR and whether atRA directly activates the transcription of the IGFBP-3 gene. The second point was of interest because it is known that retinoids can regulate gene expression posttranscriptionally (29Langenfeld J. Kiyokawa D.S. Boyle J. Dmitrovsky E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12071-12074Crossref Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 30Higuchi T. Hannigan G.E. Malkan D. Yeger H. Williams B.R. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 3958-3964PubMed Google Scholar). For these experiments, MCF-7 cells were incubated for 48 h with 10−6m of either atRA, the RAR-specific agonist Ro 13-7410, or the RXR-specific agonist Ro 25-7386. Nuclei were isolated, and nuclear run-on assays were performed. As indicated in Fig.2 A, both atRA and the RAR-specific agonist Ro 13-7410 activated IGFBP-3 gene transcription, but the gene was not transcribed in cells treated with vehicle only or with the RXR-specific agonist Ro 25-7386. The β-actin gene was transcribed normally under all of these experimental conditions. These results indicate that 1) RAR but not RXR is involved in transducing the atRA signal to induce IGFBP-3 expression, and 2) atRA and Ro 13-7410 directly activate IGFBP-3 gene transcription. IGFBP-3 mRNA was measured in parallel experiments following treatment of MCF-7 cells with the various retinoids for 72 h (Fig. 2 B). IGFBP-3 mRNA was only present in cells treated with atRA and Ro 13-7410, the RAR-specific agonist. To verify the ability of the synthetic retinoids, Ro 13-7410 and Ro 25-7386, to activate retinoid receptors in our experimental system, a luciferase reporter gene under the control of a DR5 element, the canonical retinoic acid response element activated by RARs, was introduced into MCF-7 cells. Luciferase activity was measured 72 h later in the presence of 10−6m of atRA, Ro 13-7410, or Ro 25-7386. As documented in Fig. 2 C, Ro 13-7410, the RAR-specific agonist, activated the expression of luciferase gene at a level similar to that of atRA, but Ro 25-7386, the RXR-specific agonist, was not effective in activating the expression of luciferase gene. These results validate the use of the synthetic retinoids in our experimental system. It has been shown that the transcription of the RARβ gene is induced rapidly after retinoid treatment, peaking by 6 h, and that it is independent of new protein synthesis (31de The H. Marchio A. Tiollais P. Dejean A. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 429-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 32Martin C.A. Ziegler L.M. Napoli J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4804-4808Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the level of RARα expression in breast cancer cell lines appears to be correlated with the induced levels of RARβ expression (5van der Berg B. van der Leede B.-J.M. Kwakkenbos-Isbrucker L. Salverda S. de Laat S.W. van der Saag P.T. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1993; 91: 149-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 8Seewaldt V.L. Johnson B.S. Parker M.B.

Biol. 1997; 16: 1138-1149Crossref Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Thus, it is reasonable to postulate that RARβ is induced in MCF-7 cells by atRA through a signaling pathway mediated by RARα. To test this hypothesis, MCF-7 cells were grown in the presence or absence of 10−6m atRA for 72 h. Total RNA was extracted, and 30 μg was used to measure mRNAs for RARα and RARβ by Northern blotting. As documented in Fig.3, the levels of RARα expression in MCF-7 cells were similar in the presence or absence of atRA, whereas RARβ expression was detectable only after atRA treatment. These results indicate that RARα mediates the atRA-induced expression of RARβ. These experiments led us to ask whether the signal leading to the induction of IGFBP-3 expression was mediated by RARα, or if the induced RARβ mediates IGFBP-3 induction. In order to answer this question, MCF-7 cells were cultured for 72 h in the presence of 10−7m atRA plus 0, 10−8, 10−7, or 10−6m of Ro 41-5253, an RARα-selective antagonist. A lower concentration of atRA was used because we wanted to minimize the cytotoxicity of retinoids that is observed at high concentrations. After incubation, 30 μg of total RNA was used to assay RARβ mRNA. As documented in Fig.4 A, 1 molar excess of Ro 41-5253 blocked the induction of RARβ expression. With decreasing concentrations of Ro 41-5253, RARβ expression increased, indicating that the process is mediated by RARα. IGFBP-3 expression was measured in MCF-7 cells grown for 72 h in the presence of the same combinations of retinoids by Northern blotting (Fig. 4 B). Paralleling the diminished expression of RARβ in the presence of 10−6m of Ro 41-5253, IGFBP-3 expression was also abolished, indicating that retinoid-induced IGFBP-3 expression is correlated with RARβ expression. In order to further document the direct involvement of RARβ in the atRA-induced expression of IGFBP-3, RARβ sense and antisense cDNA constructs were introduced into MCF-7 cells via expression vectors. Positive colonies were identified, cloned, and tested for RARβ expression by Western immunoblotting (Fig.5). Three clones with average levels of expression of each sense (Fig. 5 A, β3, β5,and β6) and antisense (Fig. 5 B, As-β4, As-β6, and As-β9) RARβ were used for experiments similar to those described above. As exemplified by the results shown for β5 (Fig. 6 A), the RARα-selective antagonist Ro 41-5253 was unable to block atRA-induced IGFBP-3 expression in the three clones of RARβ sense transfectants, indicating that RARα is not directly involved in this process. In contrast, in RARβ antisense transfectants, the induction of IGFBP-3 expression by atRA was totally blocked (Fig. 6 B), indicating that RARβ is directly involved in IGFBP-3 gene activation.Figure 6RAR β mediates the atRA-induced expression of IGFBP-3 (transfection experiments).Northern blotting of IGFBP-3 mRNA from total RNA extracted from RARβ sense cDNA-transfected MCF-7 cells (β5) treated with different combinations of atRA and the RARα-selective antagonist Ro 41-5253 for 72 h (A) or from three clones (As-β4, As-β6, and As-β9) of MCF-7 cells transfected with the RARβ antisense cDNA and treated with 10−6m atRA for 72 h (B). β-Actin mRNA was measured as an indicator of equal loading. The results represent at least three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The IGF growth factor system is believed to be actively involved in the growth of breast cancer (14Cohen P. Lamson G. Okajima T. Rosenfeld R.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 380-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). IGFBP-3 is a secreted protein that has been thought to primarily regulate the biological activities of IGFs extracellularly. In order to investigate the functional integrity of atRA-induced IGFBP-3 in modifying the actions of IGF-I, we first assayed IGFBP-3 secretion by MCF-7 cells after induction by atRA. For this purpose, MCF-7 cells were grown in conditioned medium for 6 days in the presence or absence of 10−6m atRA. Conditioned medium was harvested at 2, 4, and 6 days, concentrated, and analyzed for IGFBP-3 secretion by Western ligand blotting. As shown in Fig.7 A, IGFBP-3 protein was secreted into the conditioned medium at a measurable level on day 2 of atRA treatment; higher amounts of IGFBP-3 were secreted on days 4 and 6. In addition to IGFBP-3, IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-4 were also secreted into the conditioned medium, in both the presence and absence of atRA (Fig.7 A). We next tested the responsiveness of MCF-7 cells to the IGF system. Exogenous IGF-I or IGFBP-3 was added alone or in different combinations to MCF-7 cells for 4 days, and cell growth was measured by sulforhodamine staining. As documented in Fig. 7 B, MCF-7 cells were sensitive to the mitogenic effects of IGF-I, and recombinant human IGFBP-3 (rhIGFBP-3) inhibited such activity in a dose-dependent manner (0–10 nm). To investigate the biological activity of atRA-induced endogenous IGFBP-3, MCF-7 cells were maintained in conditioned medium for 4 days in the presence or absence of 10−6m atRA, and the conditioned medium was collected. IGFBP-3 protein was immunodepleted in half of the conditioned medium from atRA-treated cells. The medium was then filter-sterilized and added to MCF-7 cells for 2 days in the presence of 1 nm IGF-I. Cell growth was measured by sulforhodamine staining and expressed as percentage of absorbance relative to control MCF-7 cell cultures treated with control medium supplemented with 1 nm IGF-I (100%) or 1 nm IGF-I plus 10 nm rhIGFBP-3 (0%) (Fig.7 C). Similar to the results described in Fig. 7 B,the conditioned medium from atRA-treated MCF-7 cells was able to block the growth promotion of MCF-7 cells by IGF-I (Fig. 7 C, CM/RA/BP3). When IGFBP-3 was depleted (Fig. 7 C, CM/RA), the medium was no longer effective in blocking the growth promotion by IGF-I, whereas the normal goat serum-treated control (Fig. 7 C, CM/RA/BP3/S) did not remove the growth inhibition effect, suggesting that atRA-induced inhibition of IGF-I-stimulated cell growth is mediated rather specifically by IGFBP-3, not IGFBP-2 or IGFBP-4, because IGFBP-3-depleted medium (CM/RA) was unable to counteract IGF-I even when IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-4 were still present (Fig.7 D, lane 2). As shown in the Western blots in Fig. 7 D, conditioned medium from the 4-day atRA-treated MCF-7 cells contained the IGFBPs 3, 2, and 4 (Fig. 7 D, lane 1). After immunodepletion, only IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-4 were present (Fig. 7 D, lane 2); when the immunoprecipitate was examined, only IGFBP-3 was found (Fig. 7 D, lane 3). These experiments clearly demonstrate that atRA-induced IGFBP-3 is able to function as a downstream effector of RARβ to block the growth promotion by IGF-I in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. A semiquantitative Western blot analysis utilizing rhIGFBP-3 as a standard indicated that the concentration of IGFBP-3 in atRA-treated conditioned medium was ∼3 nm (data not shown). This result is consistent with a partial block of IGF-I action by recombinant IGFBP-3, which resulted in ∼50% inhibition at 2 nm concentration (Fig. 7 B). The tissue-specific distribution of retinoic acid receptors in adults and the spatiotemporal patterns of expression during development indicate that these receptors may play different roles. Yet the coexistence of two or three retinoic acid receptor subtypes in a specific tissue also suggests that some type of compensation/coordination may exist among retinoic acid receptors in transducing retinoid signals. Such a compensation/coordination of RARs in breast cancer cells was demonstrated in our experiments that showed that RARβ expression can be induced in MCF-7 cells by atRA via RARα mediation. The levels of RARα expression were similar in the presence or absence of atRA in MCF-7 cells, but RARβ expression, which was undetectable in the absence of atRA, was strongly induced by atRA. When the RARα-selective antagonist Ro 41-5253 was used, the induction of RARβ expression by atRA was blocked, indicating that RARβ induction is dependent on RARα. Both RARα and RARβ have been implicated in tumor development. For example, it is well documented that acute promyelocytic leukemia is caused by a reciprocal chromosome 15:17 translocation in which the t(15:17) breakpoint occurs in the RARα gene (33Agadir A. Cornic M. Gourmel B. Lefebvre P. Degos L. Chomienne C. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1994; 40: 263-274PubMed Google Scholar). An involvement of RARβ in cancer development was originally suggested by the finding that RARβ is integrated by the hepatitis B virus in human hepatoma (34Dejean A. Bougueleret L. Grzeschik K.H. Tiollais P. Nature. 1986; 322: 70-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Moreover, defective RARβ expression is believed to be an early event in epithelial carcinogenesis (35Lotan R. Xu X.-C. Lippman S.M. Ro J.Y. Lee J.S. Lee J.J. Hong W.K. New Engl. J. Med. 1995; 332: 1405-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been observed that RARβ expression is lost in many epithelial tumors and tumor cell lines, including breast cancer and breast cancer cells (5van der Berg B. van der Leede B.-J.M.

Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 3972-3981PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, transgenic mice carrying antisense RARβ2 develop carcinoma 14–18 months after birth (40Berard J. Laboune F. Mukuna M. Masse S. Kothary R. Bradley W.E. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1091-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), strongly supporting a role of RARβ in tumorigenesis. By demonstrating an RARα-dependent RARβ induction, our experiments further stress the importance of RARβ, which eventually becomes noninducible with progression of the tumor, as in estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer cells. The results of these experiments also allow us to clarify why both RARα and RARβ have been implicated in retinoid-induced growth inhibition of breast cancer cells. RARβ has been suspected as a tumor suppressor for a long time, and loss of RARβ expression has been thought to be a critical event in the development of breast cancer. We suggest that RARβ functions as a tumor suppressor by regulating the expression of other critical cell growth regulatory factors. Our experiments show that the regulation (induction) of IGFBP-3 in MCF-7 cells is mediated by RARβ, because blocking RARβ expression by an RARα antagonist, Ro 41-5253, also blocked the expression of IGFBP-3. When MCF-7 cells were transfected with the sense cDNA of RARβ, IGFBP-3 was expressed, even in the presence of Ro 41-5253. At the same time, when the antisense cDNA of RARβ was transfected into MCF-7 cells, those cells were no longer able to respond to atRA by expressing IGFBP-3. Using nuclear run-on assays, we showed that atRA directly activates IGFBP-3 gene transcription, supporting the recent finding that a major consensus sequence for retinoic acid is present in the promoter region of the IGFBP-3 gene (41Albiston AL. Saffery R. Herington A.C. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 696-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Whereas MCF-7 cells synthesize and secrete IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-4 into conditioned medium, the application of atRA not only induces the messenger for IGFBP-3, but also results in the appearance of secreted protein in the conditioned medium. IGFBP-3 secretion seems to occur while secretion of IGFBP-2 decreases and secretion of IGFBP-4 increases. Among their diverse biological activities, IGFBPs are able to negatively modulate the actions of IGF by binding IGFs and preventing them from binding to the type 1 receptor (12Murphy L.J. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 21: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 42Chan K. Spencer E.M. Endocrine. 1997; 7: 95-97Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrated that the application of IGF-I stimulates cell growth in MCF-7 cells and that the application of exogenous rhIGFBP-3 can totally reverse this action. When we tested the biological activity of IGFBP-containing conditioned media in their ability to inhibit the IGF-I-stimulated growth of MCF-7 cells, we expected that changes in all of the IGFBPs (that is, IGFBP-3 induced by atRA along with an increase in IGFBP-4 and a decrease in IGFBP-2) would contribute to the growth inhibition effect. However, immunodepletion of IGFBP-3 from the conditioned medium removed all growth inhibitory activity, suggesting an IGFBP-3-specific growth inhibitory mechanism. The significance of atRA-induced changes in IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-4 and the reason why these changes do not help counteract the IGF-I stimulation effect are not clear. Although IGFBP-3 induction by retinoids has been consistently observed, inconsistencies exist about retinoid-induced changes in IGFBPs 2 and 4 (17Fontana J.A. Burrows-Mezu A. Clemmons D.R. LeRoith D. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 1115-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 18Adamo M.L. Shao Z.-M. Lanau F. Chen J.C. Clemmons D.R. Roberts Jr., C.T. LeRoith D. Fontana J.A.

In addition, as mentioned earlier, the biological activities of IGFBPs are not limited to negative effects on IGFs. Thus, changes in IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-4 may be germane to other, as yet unidentified mechanisms. In fact, the co-presence of IGFBPs 2, 3, and 4 in the cell culture medium may well indicate that these proteins possess different functions rather than simply representing functional redundancy. Another explanation is that IGFBP-3 may act through an IGF-independent pathway. IGF-independent actions of IGFBP-3 have been reported (14Cohen P. Lamson G. Okajima T. Rosenfeld R.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 380-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 15Sell C. Rubini M. Rubin R. Liu J.-P. Estratiadis A. Baserga R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Treat. 1998; 47: 283-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), and underlying mechanisms are being pursued vigorously. Of particular interest is the recent observation that IGFBP-3 can be translocated into the cell nucleus (44Jaques G. Noll K. Wegmann B. Witten S. Kogan E. Radulescu R.T. Havemann K.

Green, unpublished data. have been shown to be translocated into the nucleus of breast cancer cells. Given the extremely selective nature of nuclear protein localization, it is reasonable to speculate that IGFBP-3 exerts profound biological activity in the nucleus. In summary, our experiments show that both RARα and RARβ are involved in the growth inhibitory activity of retinoids by mediating the induction of IGFBP-3 expression. By linking IGFBP-3 to RARβ, our experiments have pinpointed an intersection between retinoid and IGF signals. This information also expands knowledge of the downstream effectors of RARβ and explains how RARβ might act as a tumor suppressor. We are indebted to Drs. R. M. Evans (Gene Expression Laboratory, Salk Institute for Biological Studies, La Jolla, CA) and X.-K.

https://openalex.org/W2007528488,"Abstract In a previous study, we demonstrated the occurrence of novel proteins modified with a diphytanylglyceryl group in thioether linkage in Halobacterium halobium (Sagami, H., Kikuchi, A., and Ogura, K. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 14851–14854). In this study, we further investigated protein isoprenoid modification in this halobacterium using several radioactive tracers such as [3H]geranylgeranyl diphosphate. One of the radioactive bands observed on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis corresponded to a periodic acid-Schiff stain-positive protein (200 kDa). Radioactive and periodic acid-Schiff stain-positive peptides (28 kDa) were obtained by trypsin digestion of the labeled proteins. The radioactive materials released by acid treatment of the peptides showed a similar mobility to dolichyl (C55) phosphate on a normal-phase thin-layer plate. However, radioactive hydrolysates obtained by acid phosphatase treatment co-migrated not with dolichol (C55–65), but with diphytanylglycerol on both reverse- and normal-phase thin-layer plates. The mass spectrum of the hydrolysate was also coincident with that of diphytanylglycerol. The partial amino acid sequences of the 28-kDa peptides were found in a fragment (amino acids 731–816) obtainable by trypsin cleavage of the known cell-surface glycoprotein of this halobacterium. These results indicate that the cell-surface glycoprotein (200 kDa) is modified with diphytanylglyceryl phosphate."

Both TNF forms are bioactive and bind to two membrane receptors of 55–60 kDa (TNF-R1) and 75–80 kDa (TNF-R2). TNF-R1 is constitutively expressed in nearly all tissues and represents the main mediator of cellular TNF responses (for review, see Ref. 4Grell M. Scheurich P. LeRoith D. Bondy C. Growth Factors and Cytokines in Health and Disease. Jai Press Inc., Greenwich, CT1997: 669-726Google Scholar). TNF-R2 is more restricted in expression,e.g. to lymphoid tissue, is tightly regulated in its expression, and modulates cellular responses to sTNF or transmembrane TNF in a cooperative manner with TNF-R1. We have recently shown that TNF-R2, in contrast to TNF-R1, needs stimulation by the membrane form of the cytokine for full activation (5Grell M. Douni E. Wajant H. Lohden M. Clauss M. Maxeiner B. Georgopoulos S. Lesslauer W. Kollias G. Pfizenmaier K. Scheurich P. Cell. 1995; 83: 793-802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar). The low efficiency of sTNF for stimulation of TNF-R2 in comparison to TNF-R1 has been explained by the transient sTNF-TNF-R2 interaction at physiological temperatures (6Grell M. Wajant H. Zimmermann G. Scheurich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 570-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar).The cellular response pattern to TNF stimulation is extremely broad and cell type-dependent. For example, TNF can induce apoptosis and initialize a variety of other signals, including induction of cytokine production, enhancement of adhesion molecule expression, and growth stimulation (for review, see Ref. 4Grell M. Scheurich P. LeRoith D. Bondy C. Growth Factors and Cytokines in Health and Disease. Jai Press Inc., Greenwich, CT1997: 669-726Google Scholar). These cellular responses are caused by different intracellular signaling pathways induced by TNF-R1. One major signaling pathway of TNF-R1 leads to the activation of aspartate-directed proteinases (caspases) via the death domain proteins TNF receptor-associated death domain protein and Fas-associated death domain protein (7Hsu H. Shu H.B. Pan M.G. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1996; 84: 299-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar). Another major signaling pathway leads to the activation of the transcription factor NF-κB, N-terminal c-Jun kinase, and p38 kinase. NF-κB is believed to be activated via TNF receptor-associated protein 2 (TRAF2), a member of the TRAF family, and/or the death domain-containing protein kinase RIP (receptor interacting protein) (8Liu Z.G. Hsu H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar, 9Kelliher M.A. Grimm S. Ishida Y. Kuo F. Stanger B.Z. Leder P. Immunity. 1998; 8: 297-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). Activation of NF-κB results in the production of cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6 (10Libermann T.A. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2327-2334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but also induces protective mechanisms by stimulation of the expression of regulatory proteins with potential antiapoptotic activity, such as TRAF1, TRAF2, and the inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) proteins c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 (11Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Korneluk R.G. Goeddel D.V. Baldwin A.S. Science. 1998; 281: 1680-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (2562) Google Scholar). In addition to this antiapoptotic activity, TRAF2 is also critically involved in a positive, proapoptotic TNF receptor cooperation, not dependent on de novo gene induction (12Weiss T. Grell M. Hessabi B. Bourteele S. Müller G. Scheurich P. Wajant H. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2398-2404PubMed Google Scholar, 13Weiss T. Grell M. Siemienski K. Mühlenbeck F. Dürkop H. Pfizenmaier K. Scheurich P. Wajant H. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 3136-3142PubMed Google Scholar).TNF is produced by many different cell types including macrophages, T lymphocytes, and endothelial cells (for review, see Ref. 4Grell M. Scheurich P. LeRoith D. Bondy C. Growth Factors and Cytokines in Health and Disease. Jai Press Inc., Greenwich, CT1997: 669-726Google Scholar). These cells often also express TNF receptors and thus display TNF responsiveness. Auto-/juxtacrine-acting TNF has been implicated in monocyte-mediated cytotoxicity (14Smith D.M. Lackides G.A. Epstein L.B. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 3146-3153PubMed Google Scholar), primary T cell activation (15Pimentel-Muinos F.X. Mazana J. Fresno M. J. Biol.

Scheurich, unpublished observations. and induction of endothelial tissue factor production by cross-linking of adhesion molecules (16Schmid E.F. Binder K. Grell M. Scheurich P. Pfizenmaier K. Blood. 1995; 86: 1836-1841Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A critical involvement of transmembrane TNF signaling has been revealed in immunological reactions such as antileishmanial defense in macrophages, T cell/B cell interaction, and tumor cell killing by infiltrating lymphocytes (17Birkland T.P. Sypek J.P. Wyler D.J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1992; 51: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 18Aversa G. Punnonen J. de Vries J.E. J. Exp.

Immunol. 1994; 152: 3333-3341PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the transgenic expression of a noncleavable and, thus, permanently membrane-anchored TNF mutein in mice is sufficient to induce a pathological phenotype similar to rheumatoid arthritis (20Alexopoulou L. Pasparakis M. Kollias G. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 2588-2592Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), underlining the high biological potential of local TNF signaling. Whether and to what extent a juxta-/autotropic signaling loop of transmembrane TNF plays a role in these models, i.e. whether cell surface-expressed TNF acts predominantly on neighboring cells (juxtatropic) or in a true autotropic signaling mode, is unresolved.To investigate the selective effects of transmembrane TNF expression on a TNF-sensitive cell, we have generated HeLa transfectants expressing a noncleavable, constitutively membrane-bound, biologically active derivative of human TNF (HeLatmTNF). We show that these cells display a phenotype similar to TNF-stimulated untransfected HeLa cells. Accordingly, TNF-mediated signaling pathways involving the transcription factor NF-κB and the p38 MAP kinase are constitutively stimulated, and high amounts of IL-6 are produced in a TNF-dependent manner. In addition, HeLatmTNFcells undergo apoptosis in the presence of cycloheximide (CHX) or interferon-γ (IFN-γ), similar to Hela cells treated with a combination of TNF and one of these reagents.DISCUSSIONThe aim of the present study was to investigate whether expression of the membrane-integrated form of TNF in a TNF-R1-positive cell would induce a constitutive signaling rather than cellular unresponsiveness. As a model, we have chosen the human cell line HeLa, which expresses about 3,000 molecules of TNF-R1/cell but only neglectable amounts of TNF-R2 (28Heller R.A. Song K. Fan N. Chang D.J. Cell. 1992; 70: 47-56Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 12Weiss T. Grell M. Hessabi B. Bourteele S. Müller G. Scheurich P. Wajant H. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2398-2404PubMed Google Scholar). HeLa cells are largely unresponsive to the cytotoxic activity of TNF per se but can be rendered sensitive by treatment with e.g. CHX or IFN-γ. This cellular response pattern resembles that of normal tissue cells, which are typically resistant to the cytotoxic action of TNF unless metabolically stressed by e.g. virus infection (29Wong G.H. Tartaglia L.A. Lee M.S. Goeddel D.V. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 3350-3353PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, HeLa cells are well known to respond to sTNF with activation of the transcription factor NF-κB and production of IL-6 (12Weiss T. Grell M. Hessabi B. Bourteele S. Müller G. Scheurich P. Wajant H. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2398-2404PubMed Google Scholar). To study membrane TNF action under conditions where effects by soluble TNF can be avoided, TNF was constitutively expressed as a permanently membrane-anchored mutein, human Δ(1–12) TNF (tmTNF) (22Perez C. Albert I. DeFay K. Zachariades N. Gooding L. Kriegler M. Cell. 1990; 63: 251-258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). In the mouse system, the homologue Δ(1–12) deletion mutant of mouse TNF has a reduced bioactivity (30Decoster E. Vanhaesebroeck B. Vandenabeele P. Grooten J. Fiers W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18473-18478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and only partly down-regulates TNF receptor expression in L929 cells (31Decoster E. Vanhaesebroeck B. Boone E. Plaisance S. DeVos K. Haegeman G. Grooten J. Fiers W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3271-3277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). It is therefore important to mention that the Δ(1–12) deletion mutant of human TNF shows full bioactivity on human cells. We have recently demonstrated that the naturally occurring transmembrane form of TNF as well as the Δ(1–12) deletion mutant derived thereof have superior bioactivity on TNF-R2 when compared with sTNF (5Grell M. Douni E. Wajant H. Lohden M. Clauss M. Maxeiner B. Georgopoulos S. Lesslauer W. Kollias G. Pfizenmaier K. Scheurich P. Cell. 1995; 83: 793-802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar). When acting on TNF-R1, both molecules possess a bioactivity indistinguishable from sTNF. 4M. Grell, manuscript in preparation. HeLa cells transfected with human Δ(1–12) TNF (HeLatmTNF) expressed cell surface TNF in high amounts and did not release bioactive soluble TNF into the culture supernatants (data not shown). They further expressed considerable amounts of tmTNF·TNF-R1 complexes at the cell surface. This is indicated by the facts that free TNF-R1 was detectable only after a pH 3.0 treatment of the cells (Fig. 1, B and E) and that constitutive IL-6 production could be inhibited by TNF-specific antibodies (Fig.2 B). More important, the latter data also indicate that cell surface-expressed tmTNF·TNF-R1 complexes are functional with respect to signal transduction, although it cannot be excluded that in addition, signaling from intracellular complexes might occur. Accordingly, HeLatmTNF cells show a phenotype similar to sTNF-stimulated HeLa cells. The transcription factor NF-κB (Fig. 3,A and B) and the p38 MAP kinase (Fig.3 D) are constitutively activated, and consequently, the cells produce high amounts of IL-6 (Fig. 2 A). In addition, HeLatmTNF cells undergo apoptosis in the presence of CHX (Fig. 4 A) or IFN-γ (Fig. 4 B). Together, these data strongly support the hypothesis that in HeLatmTNFcells, TNF signaling pathways are permanently activated by the action of endogenous tmTNF. Analysis at the single cell level (Fig. 5) indicates that tmTNF action can occur in a truly autotropic manner. Closer analysis of the constitutive activation pattern of HeLatmTNF cells revealed a differential regulation of the signaling pathways; NF-κB seems to be only partly activated in HeLatmTNF cells, whereas IL-6 production and the kinetics of induction of apoptosis in the presence of CHX were quantitative similar to sTNF-treated HeLa cells (Fig. 2 A and data not shown). These differences might reflect differential regulation of responses to the permanent tmTNF stimulation in HeLatmTNFcells versus short term sTNF treatment of HeLa cells. Long term sTNF-stimulated HeLa cells show in fact a significant NF-κB down-regulation (data not shown).Using the TNF-sensitive mouse cell line L929, Decoster et al. (31Decoster E. Vanhaesebroeck B. Boone E. Plaisance S. DeVos K. Haegeman G. Grooten J. Fiers W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3271-3277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) have recently demonstrated that expression of tmTNF resulted in a total TNF receptor downmodulation paralleled by full TNF unresponsiveness. Obviously, induction of unresponsiveness induced by the autotropic action of TNF was dependent on the transmembrane localization of the cytokine, as a secretable TNF mutein was ineffective in this regard (31Decoster E. Vanhaesebroeck B. Boone E. Plaisance S. DeVos K. Haegeman G. Grooten J. Fiers W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3271-3277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). These data are clearly at variance to our results. However, we believe that the TNF-induced cellular stimulation described here is not cell-specific but rather reflects a physiological relevant response pattern. First, identical results have been obtained using two distinct cell lines, HeLa and 293 (Fig. 3,A and C). Second, recent data confirm an autocrine, TNF-mediated permanent stimulation of NF-κB in HuT-78 cells (32Giri D.K. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14008-14014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Third, it is unlikely that full TNF unresponsiveness is the typical cellular response pattern for normal, TNF-R1-positive tissue cells that are also capable of producing TNF. For example, human umbilical cord vein endothelial cells coexpress both TNF receptors and produce tissue factor upon adhesion molecule cross-linking via autocrine/juxtacrine TNF action (16Schmid E.F. Binder K. Grell M. Scheurich P. Pfizenmaier K. Blood. 1995; 86: 1836-1841Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).With regard to a potential cellular TNF response in vivo, we suggest that the response pattern observed here could be of physiological relevance. We show that cells capable of producing TNF are principally able to autostimulate themselves via a tmTNF-mediated autotropic signaling pathways and do not enter the apoptotic pathway. In the case of a prolonged tmTNF-mediated stimulus, as mimicked here by constitutive expression, these cells enter a status of an enhanced sensitivity for the induction of apoptosis. Such a stressed cellular status would give normal tissue cells the opportunity to recover when TNF stimulation is abrogated but would alternatively allow the organism to destroy them more easily when additional stress factors, such ase.g. virus infections, make a recovery unlikely.

Both TNF forms are bioactive and bind to two membrane receptors of 55–60 kDa (TNF-R1) and 75–80 kDa (TNF-R2). TNF-R1 is constitutively expressed in nearly all tissues and represents the main mediator of cellular TNF responses (for review, see Ref. 4Grell M. Scheurich P. LeRoith D. Bondy C. Growth Factors and Cytokines in Health and Disease. Jai Press Inc., Greenwich, CT1997: 669-726Google Scholar). TNF-R2 is more restricted in expression,e.g. to lymphoid tissue, is tightly regulated in its expression, and modulates cellular responses to sTNF or transmembrane TNF in a cooperative manner with TNF-R1. We have recently shown that TNF-R2, in contrast to TNF-R1, needs stimulation by the membrane form of the cytokine for full activation (5Grell M. Douni E. Wajant H. Lohden M. Clauss M. Maxeiner B. Georgopoulos S. Lesslauer W. Kollias G. Pfizenmaier K. Scheurich P. Cell. 1995; 83: 793-802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar). The low efficiency of sTNF for stimulation of TNF-R2 in comparison to TNF-R1 has been explained by the transient sTNF-TNF-R2 interaction at physiological temperatures (6Grell M. Wajant H. Zimmermann G. Scheurich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 570-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). The cellular response pattern to TNF stimulation is extremely broad and cell type-dependent. For example, TNF can induce apoptosis and initialize a variety of other signals, including induction of cytokine production, enhancement of adhesion molecule expression, and growth stimulation (for review, see Ref. 4Grell M. Scheurich P. LeRoith D. Bondy C. Growth Factors and Cytokines in Health and Disease. Jai Press Inc., Greenwich, CT1997: 669-726Google Scholar). These cellular responses are caused by different intracellular signaling pathways induced by TNF-R1. One major signaling pathway of TNF-R1 leads to the activation of aspartate-directed proteinases (caspases) via the death domain proteins TNF receptor-associated death domain protein and Fas-associated death domain protein (7Hsu H. Shu H.B. Pan M.G. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1996; 84: 299-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar). Another major signaling pathway leads to the activation of the transcription factor NF-κB, N-terminal c-Jun kinase, and p38 kinase. NF-κB is believed to be activated via TNF receptor-associated protein 2 (TRAF2), a member of the TRAF family, and/or the death domain-containing protein kinase RIP (receptor interacting protein) (8Liu Z.G. Hsu H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar, 9Kelliher M.A. Grimm S. Ishida Y. Kuo F. Stanger B.Z. Leder P. Immunity. 1998; 8: 297-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). Activation of NF-κB results in the production of cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6 (10Libermann T.A. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2327-2334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but also induces protective mechanisms by stimulation of the expression of regulatory proteins with potential antiapoptotic activity, such as TRAF1, TRAF2, and the inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) proteins c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 (11Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Korneluk R.G. Goeddel D.V. Baldwin A.S. Science. 1998; 281: 1680-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (2562) Google Scholar). In addition to this antiapoptotic activity, TRAF2 is also critically involved in a positive, proapoptotic TNF receptor cooperation, not dependent on de novo gene induction (12Weiss T. Grell M. Hessabi B. Bourteele S. Müller G. Scheurich P. Wajant H. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2398-2404PubMed Google Scholar, 13Weiss T. Grell M. Siemienski K. Mühlenbeck F. Dürkop H. Pfizenmaier K. Scheurich P. Wajant H. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 3136-3142PubMed Google Scholar). TNF is produced by many different cell types including macrophages, T lymphocytes, and endothelial cells (for review, see Ref. 4Grell M. Scheurich P. LeRoith D. Bondy C. Growth Factors and Cytokines in Health and Disease. Jai Press Inc., Greenwich, CT1997: 669-726Google Scholar). These cells often also express TNF receptors and thus display TNF responsiveness. Auto-/juxtacrine-acting TNF has been implicated in monocyte-mediated cytotoxicity (14Smith D.M. Lackides G.A. Epstein L.B. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 3146-3153PubMed Google Scholar), primary T cell activation (15Pimentel-Muinos F.X. Mazana J. Fresno M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24424-24429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 2M. Grell and P. Scheurich, unpublished observations. 2M. Grell and P. Scheurich, unpublished observations. and induction of endothelial tissue factor production by cross-linking of adhesion molecules (16Schmid E.F. Binder K. Grell M. Scheurich P. Pfizenmaier K. Blood. 1995; 86: 1836-1841Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A critical involvement of transmembrane TNF signaling has been revealed in immunological reactions such as antileishmanial defense in macrophages, T cell/B cell interaction, and tumor cell killing by infiltrating lymphocytes (17Birkland T.P. Sypek J.P. Wyler D.J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1992; 51: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 18Aversa G. Punnonen J. de Vries J.E. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1575-1585Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 19Lopez-Cepero M. Garcia-Sanz J.A. Herbert L. Riley R. Handel M.E. Podack E.R. Lopez D.M. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 3333-3341PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the transgenic expression of a noncleavable and, thus, permanently membrane-anchored TNF mutein in mice is sufficient to induce a pathological phenotype similar to rheumatoid arthritis (20Alexopoulou L. Pasparakis M. Kollias G. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 2588-2592Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), underlining the high biological potential of local TNF signaling. Whether and to what extent a juxta-/autotropic signaling loop of transmembrane TNF plays a role in these models, i.e. whether cell surface-expressed TNF acts predominantly on neighboring cells (juxtatropic) or in a true autotropic signaling mode, is unresolved. To investigate the selective effects of transmembrane TNF expression on a TNF-sensitive cell, we have generated HeLa transfectants expressing a noncleavable, constitutively membrane-bound, biologically active derivative of human TNF (HeLatmTNF). We show that these cells display a phenotype similar to TNF-stimulated untransfected HeLa cells. Accordingly, TNF-mediated signaling pathways involving the transcription factor NF-κB and the p38 MAP kinase are constitutively stimulated, and high amounts of IL-6 are produced in a TNF-dependent manner. In addition, HeLatmTNFcells undergo apoptosis in the presence of cycloheximide (CHX) or interferon-γ (IFN-γ), similar to Hela cells treated with a combination of TNF and one of these reagents. DISCUSSIONThe aim of the present study was to investigate whether expression of the membrane-integrated form of TNF in a TNF-R1-positive cell would induce a constitutive signaling rather than cellular unresponsiveness. As a model, we have chosen the human cell line HeLa, which expresses about 3,000 molecules of TNF-R1/cell but only neglectable amounts of TNF-R2 (28Heller R.A. Song K. Fan N. Chang D.J. Cell. 1992; 70: 47-56Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 12Weiss T. Grell M. Hessabi B. Bourteele S. Müller G. Scheurich P. Wajant H. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2398-2404PubMed Google Scholar). HeLa cells are largely unresponsive to the cytotoxic activity of TNF per se but can be rendered sensitive by treatment with e.g. CHX or IFN-γ. This cellular response pattern resembles that of normal tissue cells, which are typically resistant to the cytotoxic action of TNF unless metabolically stressed by e.g. virus infection (29Wong G.H. Tartaglia L.A. Lee M.S. Goeddel D.V. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 3350-3353PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, HeLa cells are well known to respond to sTNF with activation of the transcription factor NF-κB and production of IL-6 (12Weiss T. Grell M. Hessabi B. Bourteele S. Müller G. Scheurich P. Wajant H. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2398-2404PubMed Google Scholar). To study membrane TNF action under conditions where effects by soluble TNF can be avoided, TNF was constitutively expressed as a permanently membrane-anchored mutein, human Δ(1–12) TNF (tmTNF) (22Perez C. Albert I. DeFay K. Zachariades N. Gooding L. Kriegler M. Cell. 1990; 63: 251-258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). In the mouse system, the homologue Δ(1–12) deletion mutant of mouse TNF has a reduced bioactivity (30Decoster E. Vanhaesebroeck B. Vandenabeele P. Grooten J. Fiers W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18473-18478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and only partly down-regulates TNF receptor expression in L929 cells (31Decoster E. Vanhaesebroeck B. Boone E. Plaisance S. DeVos K. Haegeman G. Grooten J. Fiers W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3271-3277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). It is therefore important to mention that the Δ(1–12) deletion mutant of human TNF shows full bioactivity on human cells. We have recently demonstrated that the naturally occurring transmembrane form of TNF as well as the Δ(1–12) deletion mutant derived thereof have superior bioactivity on TNF-R2 when compared with sTNF (5Grell M. Douni E. Wajant H. Lohden M. Clauss M. Maxeiner B. Georgopoulos S. Lesslauer W. Kollias G. Pfizenmaier K. Scheurich P. Cell. 1995; 83: 793-802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar). When acting on TNF-R1, both molecules possess a bioactivity indistinguishable from sTNF. 4M. Grell, manuscript in preparation. HeLa cells transfected with human Δ(1–12) TNF (HeLatmTNF) expressed cell surface TNF in high amounts and did not release bioactive soluble TNF into the culture supernatants (data not shown). They further expressed considerable amounts of tmTNF·TNF-R1 complexes at the cell surface. This is indicated by the facts that free TNF-R1 was detectable only after a pH 3.0 treatment of the cells (Fig. 1, B and E) and that constitutive IL-6 production could be inhibited by TNF-specific antibodies (Fig.2 B). More important, the latter data also indicate that cell surface-expressed tmTNF·TNF-R1 complexes are functional with respect to signal transduction, although it cannot be excluded that in addition, signaling from intracellular complexes might occur. Accordingly, HeLatmTNF cells show a phenotype similar to sTNF-stimulated HeLa cells. The transcription factor NF-κB (Fig. 3,A and B) and the p38 MAP kinase (Fig.3 D) are constitutively activated, and consequently, the cells produce high amounts of IL-6 (Fig. 2 A). In addition, HeLatmTNF cells undergo apoptosis in the presence of CHX (Fig. 4 A) or IFN-γ (Fig. 4 B). Together, these data strongly support the hypothesis that in HeLatmTNFcells, TNF signaling pathways are permanently activated by the action of endogenous tmTNF. Analysis at the single cell level (Fig. 5) indicates that tmTNF action can occur in a truly autotropic manner. Closer analysis of the constitutive activation pattern of HeLatmTNF cells revealed a differential regulation of the signaling pathways; NF-κB seems to be only partly activated in HeLatmTNF cells, whereas IL-6 production and the kinetics of induction of apoptosis in the presence of CHX were quantitative similar to sTNF-treated HeLa cells (Fig. 2 A and data not shown). These differences might reflect differential regulation of responses to the permanent tmTNF stimulation in HeLatmTNFcells versus short term sTNF treatment of HeLa cells. Long term sTNF-stimulated HeLa cells show in fact a significant NF-κB down-regulation (data not shown).Using the TNF-sensitive mouse cell line L929, Decoster et al. (31Decoster E. Vanhaesebroeck B. Boone E. Plaisance S. DeVos K. Haegeman G. Grooten J. Fiers W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3271-3277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) have recently demonstrated that expression of tmTNF resulted in a total TNF receptor downmodulation paralleled by full TNF unresponsiveness. Obviously, induction of unresponsiveness induced by the autotropic action of TNF was dependent on the transmembrane localization of the cytokine, as a secretable TNF mutein was ineffective in this regard (31Decoster E. Vanhaesebroeck B. Boone E. Plaisance S. DeVos K. Haegeman G. Grooten J. Fiers W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3271-3277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). These data are clearly at variance to our results. However, we believe that the TNF-induced cellular stimulation described here is not cell-specific but rather reflects a physiological relevant response pattern. First, identical results have been obtained using two distinct cell lines, HeLa and 293 (Fig. 3,A and C). Second, recent data confirm an autocrine, TNF-mediated permanent stimulation of NF-κB in HuT-78 cells (32Giri D.K. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14008-14014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Third, it is unlikely that full TNF unresponsiveness is the typical cellular response pattern for normal, TNF-R1-positive tissue cells that are also capable of producing TNF. For example, human umbilical cord vein endothelial cells coexpress both TNF receptors and produce tissue factor upon adhesion molecule cross-linking via autocrine/juxtacrine TNF action (16Schmid E.F. Binder K. Grell M. Scheurich P. Pfizenmaier K. Blood. 1995; 86: 1836-1841Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).With regard to a potential cellular TNF response in vivo, we suggest that the response pattern observed here could be of physiological relevance. We show that cells capable of producing TNF are principally able to autostimulate themselves via a tmTNF-mediated autotropic signaling pathways and do not enter the apoptotic pathway. In the case of a prolonged tmTNF-mediated stimulus, as mimicked here by constitutive expression, these cells enter a status of an enhanced sensitivity for the induction of apoptosis.

Many of the Ub-dependent regulatory circuits involve processive degradation of ubiquitylated proteins by the 26 S proteasome, an ATP-dependent multisubunit protease (7Baumeister W. Walz J. Zühl F. Seemüller E. Cell. 1998; 92: 367-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar, 8Rechsteiner M. Peters J.M. Harris J.R. Finley D. Ubiquitin and the Biology of the Cell. Plenum Press, New York1998: 147-189Crossref Google Scholar). The N-end rule is organized hierarchically. In the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae, Asn and Gln are tertiary destabilizing N-terminal residues in that they function through their conversion, by the NTA1-encoded N-terminal amidase, into the secondary destabilizing N-terminal residues Asp and Glu. The destabilizing activity of N-terminal Asp and Glu requires their conjugation by the ATE1-encoded Arg-tRNA-protein transferase (R-transferase) to Arg, one of the primary destabilizing residues (reviewed in Refs. 1Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12142-12149Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar and 9Kwon Y.T. Kashina A.S. Varshavsky A. Mol. Cell.

In mammals, two distinct N-terminal amidases specific, respectively, for N-terminal Asn or Gln mediate the conversion of these tertiary destabilizing residues into the secondary destabilizing residues Asp or Glu (10Grigoryev S. Stewart A.E. Kwon Y.T. Arfin S.M. Bradshaw R.A. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Varshavsky A. J. Biol.

The set of secondary destabilizing residues in vertebrates contains not only Asp and Glu but also Cys, which is a stabilizing residue in yeast (9Kwon Y.T. Kashina A.S. Varshavsky A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 182-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 12Gonda D.K. Bachmair A. Wünning I. Tobias J.W. Lane W.S. Varshavsky A. J. Biol.

The primary destabilizing N-terminal residues are bound directly by N-recognin, the E3 (recognition) component of the N-end rule pathway. In S. cerevisiae, N-recognin is the UBR1-encoded 225-kDa protein that binds to potential N-end rule substrates through their primary destabilizing N-terminal residues: Phe, Leu, Trp, Tyr, Ile, Arg, Lys, and His (1Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12142-12149Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar, 14Bartel B. Wünning I. Varshavsky A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3179-3189Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The Ubr1 genes encoding mouse and human N-recognin (also called E3α) have been cloned as well (15Kwon Y.T. Reiss Y. Fried V.A. Hershko A. Yoon J.K. Gonda D.K. Sangan P. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7898-7903Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). N-recognin has at least two substrate-binding sites. The type 1 site is specific for the basic N-terminal residues Arg, Lys, and His. The type 2 site is specific for the bulky hydrophobic N-terminal residues Phe, Leu, Trp, Tyr, and Ile (1Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12142-12149Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar, 12Gonda D.K. Bachmair A. Wünning I. Tobias J.W. Lane W.S. Varshavsky A. J. Biol.

J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). N-recognin can also target short-lived proteins such as Cup9p (18Byrd C. Turner G.C. Varshavsky A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and Gpa1p (19Madura K. Varshavsky A. Science. 1994; 265: 1454-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 20Schauber C. Chen L. Tongaonkar P. Vega I. Madura K. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 307-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), which lack destabilizing N-terminal residues. The Ubr1p-recognized degradation signals of these proteins remain to be characterized in detail. The known functions of the N-end rule pathway include the control of di- and tripeptide import in S. cerevisiae through the degradation of Cup9p, a transcriptional repressor of the peptide transporter gene PTR2 (18Byrd C. Turner G.C. Varshavsky A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 21Alagramam K. Naider F. Becker J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 225-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar); a mechanistically undefined role in the Sln1p-dependent phosphorylation cascade that mediates osmoregulation in S. cerevisiae (22Ota I.M. Varshavsky A. Science. 1993; 262: 566-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar); the degradation of Gpa1p, a Gα protein of S. cerevisiae (19Madura K. Varshavsky A.

Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 307-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar); and the conditional degradation of alphaviral RNA polymerase in virus-infected metazoan cells (23deGroot R.J. Rümenapf T. Kuhn R.J. Strauss J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8967-8971Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Physiological N-end rule substrates were also identified among the proteins secreted into the cytosol of the host cell by intracellular parasites such as the bacteriumListeria monocytogenes (24Sijts A.J. Pilip I. Pamer E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19261-19268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Short half-lives of these proteins are required for the efficient presentation of their peptides to the immune system (24Sijts A.J. Pilip I. Pamer E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19261-19268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). A partial inhibition of the N-end rule pathway was reported to interfere with mammalian cell differentiation (25Hondermarck H. Sy J. Bradshaw R.A. Arfin S.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 30: 280-288Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and to delay limb regeneration in amphibians (26Taban C.H. Hondermarck H. Bradshaw R.A. Boilly B. Experientia. 1996; 52: 865-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that the N-end rule pathway mediates a large fraction of the muscle protein turnover (27Solomon V. Lecker S.H. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25216-25222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and plays a role in catabolic states that result in muscle atrophy (28Solomon V. Baracos V. Sarraf P. Goldberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12602-12607Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Targeted mutagenesis has been used to inactivate the N-end rule pathway in Escherichia coli and S. cerevisiae (14Bartel B. Wünning I. Varshavsky A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3179-3189Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 29Tobias J.W. Shrader T.E. Rocap G. Varshavsky A. Science. 1991; 254: 1374-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Analogous mutants have recently been constructed in the mouse as well. 2Y. T. Kwon and A. Varshavsky, unpublished data. These approaches notwithstanding, an efficacious inhibitor of the N-end rule pathway would be useful as well, especially with organisms less tractable genetically. The emerging understanding of the N-end rule pathway in mammals suggests that selective inhibition or activation of this proteolytic system may also have medical applications. Previous work has shown that millimolar concentrations of amino acid derivatives such as dipeptides bearing destabilizing N-terminal residues can selectively inhibit the N-end rule pathway in extracts from rabbit reticulocytes (12Gonda D.K.

Chem. 1988; 263: 2693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Xenopus eggs (13Davydov I.V. Patra D. Varshavsky A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 357: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), and in intact S. cerevisiae cells as well (16Baker R.T. Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 87: 2374-2378Google Scholar). However, the same dipeptides were observed to have at most marginal effects on the N-end rule pathway in intact mammalian cells. 3F. Lévy and A. Varshavsky, unpublished data. One limitation of dipeptide inhibitors is their apparently low affinity for the type 1 and the type 2 site of N-recognin (30Varshavsky A. Byrd C. Davydov I.V. Dohmen R.J. Du F. Ghislain M. Gonzalez M. Grigoryev S. Johnson E.S. Johnsson N. Johnston J.A. Kwon Y.T. Lévy F. Lomovskaya O. Madura K. Ota I. Rümenapf T. Shrader T.E. Suzuki T. Turner G. Waller P.R.H. Webster A. Peters J.-M. Harris J.R. Finley D. Ubiquitin and the Biology of the Cell. Plenum Press, New York1998: 223-278Crossref Google Scholar). In the present work, we explored the possibility that a bivalent ligand can bind simultaneously to the type 1 and type 2 sites of N-recognin (see Fig. 1 A). Similarly to the previously characterized bivalent interactions that involve either macromolecules or small molecules (31Kramer R.H. Karpen J.W. Nature. 1998; 395: 710-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 32Ptashne M. A Genetic Switch. Cell Press, Cambridge, MA1992Google Scholar), the cooperativity of binding at two independent, mutually nonexclusive sites would be expected to increase the affinity between N-recognin and a bivalent inhibitor by orders of magnitude, in comparison with the affinity of a monovalent binding by the same compound. We show that a bivalent inhibitor of the N-end rule pathway is feasible and consider the implications of this advance. The S. cerevisiaestrains used were JD52 (MATa ura3-52 his3-Δ200 leu2-3,112 trp1-Δ63 lys2-801) and JD55 (MATaura3-52 his3-Δ200 leu2-3,112 trp1-Δ63 lys2-801 ubr1 Δ::HIS3) (19Madura K. Varshavsky A. Science. 1994; 265: 1454-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 33Madura K. Dohmen R.J. Varshavsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12046-12054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown on rich (YPD) or synthetic medium containing either 2% dextrose (SD medium), 2% galactose (SG medium), or 2% raffinose (SR medium) (34Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2545) Google Scholar). To induce the PCUP1 promoter, CuSO4 was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mm. Transformation of S. cerevisiae was carried out using the lithium acetate method (35). The high copy (2μ-based) plasmids pRΔ-βgal-TRP1 and pRΔ-βgal-HIS3, which expressed Arg-eΔK-βgal (Ub-Arg-eΔK-βgal) (see Fig. 2 A) from the galactose-inducible PCYC1/GAL1hybrid promoter (2Bachmair A. Finley D. Varshavsky A. Science. 1986; 234: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar), were produced by replacing the URA3marker gene of pFL7 with either TRP1 or HIS3. pLΔ-βgal-TRP1 and pLΔ-βgal-HIS3, both of which expressed Leu-eΔK-βgal (Ub-Leu-eΔK-βgal), were produced by replacing the Ub-Arg domain of pRΔ-βgal-TRP1 and pRΔ-βgal-HIS3 with Ub-Leu domain of the pLL2 plasmid. 4M. Ghislain and A. Varshavsky, unpublished data. The plasmid pFL7 was produced from pUB23-R (2Bachmair A. Finley D. Varshavsky A. Science. 1986; 234: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar) by converting the lysine codons 15 and 17 of the extension eK into arginine codons (36Bachmair A. Varshavsky A. Cell. 1989; 56: 1019-1032Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 37Johnson E.S. Gonda D.K. Varshavsky A. Nature. 1990; 346: 287-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), yielding a construct encoding the extension eΔK in front of a βgal moiety lacking the first 23 residues of wild type βgal (see Fig. 2 A). The low copy, pRS315 vector-derived (38Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) plasmid pR-eΔKhaUra3-R3R7 expressed Arg-eΔK-ha-Ura3pK3R,K7R(Ub-Arg-eΔK-ha-Ura3pK3R,K7R) from the PCUP1 promoter. Arg-eΔK-ha-Ura3pK3R,K7R (see Fig.2 B) is called Arg-Ura3p in the main text. In this N-end rule substrate, the residues Lys-3 and Lys-7 of the S. cerevisiaeUra3p were converted to arginines (see “Results and Discussion”). In addition, the ha epitope tag (39Johnson E.S. Ma P.C. Ota I.M. Varshavsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17442-17456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar) was placed between eΔK and Ura3pK3R,K7R (see Fig.2 B). The plasmid pR-eΔKhaUra3-R3R7 was produced from pFL1 (encoding Ub-Arg-eΔK-ha-Ura3p) through site-directed mutagenesis of the URA3 codons for Lys-3 and Lys-7. pFL1 was produced from pKM1235 (which encoded Ub-Arg-eK-ha-Ura3p) 5K. Madura and A. Varshavsky, unpublished data. by converting the eK-coding sequence into the one encoding eΔK. Pulse-chase assays with S. cerevisiae in mid-exponential growth (A 600 of ∼1) utilized 35S-EXPRESS (NEN Life Science Products) and were carried out as described previously (10Grigoryev S. Stewart A.E. Kwon Y.T. Arfin S.M. Bradshaw R.A. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Varshavsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28521-28532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 19Madura K. Varshavsky A. Science. 1994; 265: 1454-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), including the immunoprecipitation with anti-βgal and anti-ha antibodies and quantitation with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). To determine plating efficiency,S. cerevisiae strains JD52 (UBR1) and JD55 (ubr1Δ) expressing Arg-Ura3p (Ub-Arg-eΔK-ha-Ura3pK3R,K7R; see Fig.2 B) were co-transformed with plasmids indicated in the legend to Fig. 3. The transformants were cultured in the raffinose-based medium (SR) lacking Leu, His, and Trp for 20 h. The cultures were then diluted into the otherwise identical galactose-containing (SG) medium to a final A 600of 0.1. At an A 600 of 0.4, cultures were either supplemented with 0.1 mm CuSO4 or left unsupplemented. At the A 600 of 1.0, the cultures were diluted with SG (which lacks Leu, His, and Trp) either containing or lacking 0.1 mm CuSO4 and were plated on the plates of the same medium composition that also either contained or lacked uracil. The plating efficiency (%) was defined as the ratio of the number of colonies on SG (−Leu, −His, −Trp, −Ura) plates tο the number of colonies on SG (−Leu, −His, −Trp) plates, at the same concentration of CuSO4. For each measurement, colonies on 15 plates were counted to yield the average number of colonies per plate. We constructed a bivalent N-end rule inhibitor (Fig.1 A) from the previously studied N-end rule substrates derived from E. coli βgal (2Bachmair A. Finley D. Varshavsky A. Science. 1986; 234: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, linear Ub-protein fusions are rapidly cleaved by deubiquitylating enzymes at the Ub-protein junction, making possible the production of otherwise identical proteins bearing different N-terminal residues, a technical advance that led to the finding of the N-end rule (2Bachmair A. Finley D. Varshavsky A. Science. 1986; 234: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar). A βgal-based N-end rule substrate contains a destabilizing N-terminal residue (produced in vivo using the Ub fusion technique (1Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12142-12149Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar)); a ∼45-residue, E. coli Lac repressor-derived N-terminal extension called eK (extensione bearing lysines K); and the βgal moiety lacking its first 21 residues. The resulting X-eK-βgal is a short-lived protein in both yeast and mammalian cells, whereas an otherwise identical protein bearing a stabilizing N-terminal residue such as Met or Val is metabolically stable (1Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12142-12149Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar, 2Bachmair A. Finley D. Varshavsky A. Science. 1986; 234: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar). An N-degron comprises a destabilizing N-terminal residue and a Lys residue (or residues), the latter being the site of formation of a multi-Ub chain (1Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12142-12149Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar, 36Bachmair A. Varshavsky A. Cell. 1989; 56: 1019-1032Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). (Ubr1p can also recognize a set of other, internal degrons, which remain to be characterized (18Byrd C. Turner G.C. Varshavsky A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar).) If Lys-15 and Lys-17 of the eK extension are replaced by the Arg residues (which cannot be ubiquitylated), the resulting X-eΔK-βgal (Fig.2 A) is long-lived in vivo even if its N-terminal residue is destabilizing in the N-end rule (1Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12142-12149Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar, 37Johnson E.S. Gonda D.K. Varshavsky A. Nature. 1990; 346: 287-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In the present work, we used the metabolically stable Arg-eΔK-βgal (produced from Ub-Arg-eΔK-βgal) and Leu-eΔK-βgal (produced from Ub-Leu-eΔK-βgal). These proteins retain the ability to bind, respectively, to the type 1 and type 2 sites of N-recognin but cannot be ubiquitylated (37Johnson E.S. Gonda D.K. Varshavsky A. Nature. 1990; 346: 287-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), apparently because the most N-terminal Lys residue in X-eΔK-βgal, at position 239, is too far from the N terminus of the protein. In the βgal tetramer, the two N termini of each dimer are spatially close, exposed, and oriented in the same direction (40Jacobson R.H. Zhang X.J. DuBose R.F. Matthews B.W. Nature. 1994; 369: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). At equal levels of expression of the two βgal-based polypeptide chains such as Arg-eΔK-βgal and Leu-eΔK-βgal, 50% of βgal tetramers would be expected to be heterotetramers in which at least one of the two dimers bears different (Arg and Leu) N-terminal residues (Fig. 1 B). If the type 1 and type 2 substrate-binding sites of the 225-kDa Ubr1p are appropriately located and oriented, they might be able to bind the Arg- and Leu-bearing subunits of the mixed βgal tetramer, especially in view of the presumed flexibility of the eΔK extension (1Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12142-12149Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar) (Fig.1 A). The reporter N-end rule substrate in this study was Arg-eΔK-ha-Ura3pK3R,K7R, denoted below as Arg-Ura3p (Fig. 2 B). This ha-tagged, type 1 N-end rule substrate was produced from Ub-Arg-eΔK-ha-Ura3pK3R,K7R through the cotranslational in vivo cleavage by deubiquitinating enzymes (1Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12142-12149Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar, 6Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 405-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1461) Google Scholar, 41Ghislain M. Dohmen R.J. Levy F. Varshavsky A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4884-4899Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The lysine-lacking eΔK extension of Arg-eΔK-ha-Ura3pK3R,K7R, and the replacement of the first two lysines of the Ura3p moiety with arginines were used to decrease the rate of degradation of Arg-Ura3p by the N-end rule pathway and also to reduce the slow but detectable degradation of Arg-Ura3p by yet another pathway, through a degron distinct from the N-degron.3 Several Lys residues of Ura3p other than Lys-3 and Lys-7 are also close to its N terminus, thus accounting for the absence, in this case, of the all-or-none effect on the reporter degradation that is observed when eK is replaced with eΔK in an X-eK-βgal substrate (37Johnson E.S. Gonda D.K. Varshavsky A. Nature. 1990; 346: 287-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The Lys-3 → Arg and Lys-7 → Arg modifications decreased the enzymatic activity of the Ura3p moiety.2 The reduced enzymatic activity of Ura3pK3R,K7R facilitated selection assays (Figs. 3 and4). The first bivalent inhibitor assay employed ura3 S. cerevisiae expressing Arg-Ura3p (Fig. 2 B) from the uninduced PCUP1 promoter. The Ubr1p-mediated degradation of Arg-Ura3p (t ½ of ∼8 min) and its correspondingly low steady-state concentration rendered wild type (UBR1) cells phenotypically Ura−, whereas ubr1Δstrains expressing Arg-Ura3p were phenotypically Ura+(Figs. 3 and 4 and data not shown). Cells expressing Arg-Ura3p were cotransformed with two control plasmids (vectors; 423+424 in Fig. 3). Alternatively, these cells were cotransformed with two plasmids (bearing different selectable markers) that expressed either Arg-eΔK-βgal alone (R+R in Fig. 3), Leu-eΔK-βgal alone (L+L in Fig. 3), or both of them together (R+L in Fig. 3; the bivalent inhibitor mode) from a galactose-inducible promoter. Pairs of alternatively marked plasmids were used to make certain that the conditions of expression and the total amounts of βgal-based proteins produced remained the same in all of these settings. The transformants were streaked on SG medium lacking uracil. Remarkably, only those Arg-Ura3p-expressing cells that expressedboth Arg-eΔK-βgal and Leu-eΔK-βgal became Ura+ under these conditions (Fig. 3). The cells that expressed either Arg-eΔK-βgal alone or Leu-eΔK-βgal alone remained Ura−, as did the cells that received control plasmids (Fig. 3). (The same cells grew equally well in the control SG medium containing uracil (Fig. 3, bottom left panel).) Note that the monovalent inhibitors were ineffective despite the fact that the concentration of either the Arg-based N terminus alone or the Leu-based N terminus alone was twice the concentration of the same N termini in the case of the bivalent inhibitor. To quantify the effect of coexpressing Arg-eΔK-βgal and Leu-eΔK-βgal on the rescue of the Ura+phenotype, a plating efficiency assay was carried out with the same transformants. Equal amounts of cells were plated on SG(+Ura) and SG(−Ura) plates, and the numbers of colonies were determined. When the Arg-Ura3p reporter was expressed at a sufficiently low rate (uninduced PCUP1 promoter), cells became Ura+ (through metabolic stabilization of Arg-Ura3p) only in the presence ofboth Arg-eΔK-βgal and Leu-eΔK-βgal (Fig. 4 B). A weak stabilizing effect of Arg-eΔK-βgal alone could be detected only at a ∼20-fold higher level of Arg-Ura3p expression (induced PCUP1 promoter) (Fig. 4 A). No stabilization of Arg-Ura3p was observed in the presence of Leu-eΔK-βgal under any conditions (Fig. 4), confirming the specificity of inhibition in regard to the type (basic or bulky hydrophobic) of the primary destabilizing N-terminal residue of the reporter. Higher sensitivity of this assay at the higher level of Arg-Ura3p expression results from a higher steady-state level of the short-lived Arg-Ura3p, so that even its marginal stabilization suffices to render a small fraction of cells Ura+ (Fig. 4 A; compare with Fig.4 B). To analyze directly the in vivo degradation of Arg-Ura3p in the presence of different combinations of X-eΔK-βgal proteins, the transformants of Figs. 3 and 4 were subjected to pulse-chase analysis, with immunoprecipitation of both Arg-Ura3p and the (long-lived) X-eΔK-βgals (Fig.5). Quantitation of the resulting electrophoretic patterns (Fig. 5 C) confirmed and extended the conclusions reached through phenotypic analyses (Figs. 3 and 4). Specifically, the normally short-lived Arg-Ura3p (Fig. 5 A,lanes 1–3) was strongly (but still incompletely) stabilized in the presence of both Arg-eΔK-βgal and Leu-eΔK-βgal (Fig. 5 A, lanes 4–6; compare with lanes 1–3 and 7–9). This stabilization was manifested especially clearly as an increase in the relative amount of Arg-Ura3p at the beginning of chase (time 0), indicating reduced degradation of Arg-Ura3p during the pulse (Fig.5 C). This latter degradation pattern, termed “zero point effect,” is caused by the previously demonstrated preferential targeting of newly formed (as distinguished from conformationally mature) protein substrates by the N-end rule pathway (16Baker R.T. Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 87: 2374-2378Google Scholar, 42Lévy F. Johnsson N. Rümenapf T. Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4907-4912Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The increased steady-state level of Arg-Ura3p in the presence of both Arg-eΔK-βgal and Leu-eΔK-βgal accounted for the results of phenotypic analyses (Figs. 3 and 4). The much smaller but detectable stabilization of Arg-Ura3p by Arg-eΔK-βgal alone (Fig. 5 C) was consistent not only with the inability of Arg-eΔK-βgal to confer the Ura+ phenotype on cells expressing Arg-Ura3p from uninduced PCUP1 promoter but also with the partial rescue of the Ura+ phenotype by Arg-eΔK-βgal in cells expressing Arg-Ura3p from the induced PCUP1 (Figs. 3and 4 and data not shown). The Arg/Leu-eΔK-βgal-based bivalent inhibitor of the present work, although surprisingly potent (Fig. 4 B), is obviously far from optimal even for a protein-based inhibitor; because βgal is a homotetramer, only ∼50% of the coexpressed Arg-eΔK-βgal and Leu-eΔK-βgal chains would exist as heterodimers within tetramers (Fig. 1 B). (This estimate assumes a random assortment of Arg- and Leu-bearing βgal chains in the formation of βgal tetramers. The actual in vivo assortment is expected to be biased, to an unknown extent, in favor of homodimeric associations, because individual polysomes would produce βgal chains bearing either Arg or Leu but not both.) In addition, although the eΔK extension (Fig. 2 A) is capable of supporting the desired effects, it is also unlikely to be optimal. In summary, the efficacy of this first and necessarily suboptimal bivalent inhibitor bodes well for the future of this design. A bivalent inhibitor is strikingly more efficacious than an otherwise identical monovalent inhibitor (Figs. Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5). In addition, our findings are the first evidence that the type 1 and type 2 sites of N-recognin are spatially proximal in the 225-kDa S. cerevisiae Ubr1p. While this work was under way, genetic dissection of S. cerevisiae Ubr1p identified amino acid residues that are required for the integrity of the type 1 site but not the type 2 site, andvice versa. 6A. Webster, M. Ghislain, and A. Varshavsky, unpublished data. These results provided independent evidence for both the separateness and spatial proximity of the two substrate-binding sites of the 225-kDa N-recognin, in agreement with the present data. Our results (Figs.Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5) strongly suggest that small bivalent inhibitors of the N-end rule pathway are feasible, and moreover, are expected to be much more potent than their monovalent counterparts. Work to produce such inhibitors is under way. We thank members of the Varshavsky laboratory, especially A. Kashina and G. Turner, for helpful discussions and advice in the course of this work. We also thank I. Davydov, F. Du, F. Navarro-Garcia, H. Rao, and especially G. Turner for comments on the manuscript."

This region contains a putative insulin response element (IRE-II). When nuclear extracts from untreated or insulin-treated H-35 cells were incubated with IRE-II, transcription factors Sp1 and Sp3 were observed to bind constitutively to this element, whereas insulin induces the quick and transient binding of an insulin response factor. This induction requires de novoprotein synthesis. Competition and supershift assays demonstrated that the insulin response factor is the immediate-early geneEgr-1. In vitro assays revealed that Egr-1 displaces Sp1 from its binding site in IRE-II. Insulin inducesEgr-1 mRNA, with a time course pattern that corresponds perfectly to the Egr-1 binding to IRE-II. This induction depends on the activation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase, and it is phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-independent, as demonstrated with specific inhibitors for both pathways. By cotransfecting the wild-type or a dominant negative Ras, an upstream regulator of MAP kinase, we show that Ras inhibits ME promoter activity. Furthermore, overexpression of Egr-1 in H-35 cells represses the ME gene promoter in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that insulin induces a quick, transient, and Ras/MAP kinase-dependent activation of Egr-1 which leads to a transient repression of ME gene transcription. On a late phase, insulin would activate a different,Egr-1-independent pathway, which would result in activation of the ME gene.

Apart from a well reported role in metabolism, insulin behaves as a mitogen (1Roche S. Downward J. Raynal P. Courtneidge S.A. Mol. Cell.

Ras/MAP kinase and PI 3-kinase have been involved in mitogenic and metabolic effects induced by insulin (for review, see Ref. 6Myers M.G. White M.F. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 615-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Stimulation of any of these pathways can eventually lead to the activation/inhibition of target genes, either by transcriptional or post-transcriptional mechanisms. Regulation of transcription by insulin affects more than 100 genes (7O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1109-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Insulin response elements (IREs) have been identified in the promoter of different genes, and although it is now accepted that there is not a consensus IRE, the sequence T (G/A)TTT (T/G) (G/T) has been found in several promoters repressed by insulin (8Forest C.D.

Powell D.R. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4291-4300Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) families of transcription factors have been involved in gene regulation by insulin, although its action is restricted to a few genes. The malic enzyme (ME) gene is regulated by insulin. This lipogenic enzyme catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of malate to pyruvate and provides NADPH for de novo synthesis of fatty acids, mainly in liver and adipose tissue (for review, see Ref. 14Hillgartner F.B. Salati L.M. Goodridge A.G. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 47-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). ME gene expression is subjected to a complex multihormonal and nutritional regulation (for review, see Ref. 15Goodridge A.G. Klautky S.A. Fantozzi D.A. Baillie R.A. Odnett D.W. Chen W. Thurmond D.C. Xu G. Roncero C. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1996; 52: 89-122Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to insulin, thyroid hormones and fatty acids are also positive regulators of ME, whereas glucagon, cAMP inducers, and retinoic acid inhibit its expression. The rat ME gene promoter lacks both a TATA box and CAAT sequence and displays an extremely GC- rich content in its proximal region (16Morioka H. Tennyson G.E. Nikodem V.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3542-3545Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Functional response elements for thyroid hormone receptors (17Petty K.J. Desvergne B. Mitshuhashi T. Nikodem V.M. J. Biol.

Mitshuhashi T. Nikodem V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11483-11490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Sp1 (16Morioka H. Tennyson G.E. Nikodem V.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3542-3545Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) have been described in light of sequence homology. Sp1 is a ubiquitous transcription factor that binds to consensus GC boxes (20Dynan W.S. Tjian R. Cell. 1983; 35: 79-87Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar) and mediates transcription through glutamine-rich transactivation domains (21Courey A.J. Holtzman D.A. Jackson S.P. Tjian R. Cell. 1989; 59: 827-836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). In many promoters, Sp1 sites overlap with binding sites for the immediate-early gene Egr-1 (22Huang R.P. Fan Y. Ni Z. Mercola D. Adamson E.D. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 66: 489-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). This transcription factor (also called nerve growth factor I-A, zif 268, or Krox 24) binds to the consensus GCG (C/G) GGG CG sequence (23Lemaire P. Vesque C. Schmitt J. Stunnenberg H. Frank R. Charnay P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3456-3467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Cao X. Koski R.A. Gashler A. McKiernan M. Morris C.F. Gaffney R. Hay R.V. Sukhatme V.P. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1993; 13: 4556-4571Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). In overlapping Sp1/Egr-1 binding sites, constitutively bound Sp1 is usually displaced by Egr-1, which is induced by many different external stimuli including mitogens and differentiation signals (26Gashler A. Sukhatme V.P. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1995; 50: 191-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). In this report we have studied insulin regulation of ME gene transcription in rat H-35 hepatoma cells. In a previous work (27Garcı́a-Jiménez C. Benito B. Jolin T. Santisteban P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1361-1369PubMed Google Scholar) we described the existence of two putative IREs within the ME promoter: IRE-I, which resembles the negative IRE described in the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase promoter (10O'Brien R.M. Lucas P.C. Forest C.D. Magnuson M.A. Granner D.K. Science. 1990; 249: 533-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), and IRE-II, which is similar to the positive IRE-A element of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene promoter (28Nasrin N. Ercolani L. Denaro M. Kong X.F. Kang I. Alexander M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5273-5277Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). We demonstrate that the region between −177 and −102, containing the IRE-II element, displays the maximal insulin response. A more detailed analysis of the IRE-II sequence revealed a putative binding site for Sp1. We show that Sp1, Sp3, and an insulin response factor (IRF) bind to IRE-II in a specific manner. By competition and supershift assays, we demonstrate that IRF is Egr-1. Insulin induces a quick and transient activation ofEgr-1 transcript, which is MAP kinase-dependent. Overexpression of Egr-1 inhibits ME gene promoter activity. The same results are obtained by overexpressing Ras, an upstream regulator of Egr-1. We propose that insulin initially represses ME gene expression in H-35 cells by up-regulatingEgr-1. On a delayed phase, insulin would activate a positive effector that will be responsible for the late up-regulation of ME gene. 5′-Deletions of the rat ME promoter fused in front of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene (pME882CAT, pME315CAT, and pME177CAT) have been described before (16Morioka H. Tennyson G.E. Nikodem V.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3542-3545Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). pME102CAT contains the first 102 base pairs of ME promoter subcloned in front of the CAT gene and was constructed by removing the XbaI (−775)-NotI (−102) fragment from pME775CAT (29IJpenberg A. Jeannin E. Wahli W. Desvergne B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20108-20117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). These plasmids were generously provided by Dr. V. Nikodem (NIH, Bethesda, MD) and Dr. B. Desvergne (IBA, Lausanne, Switzerland). Plasmid pJDM8 contains the full-length rat Egr-1 cDNA (30Milbrandt J. Science. 1987; 238: 797-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar) and was kindly supplied by Dr. J. Milbrandt (Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO). pSG-Egr-1 was constructed by subcloning the rEgr-1 cDNA from pJDM8 into the EcoRI site of pSG5 (31Green S. Issemann I. Sheer E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 369Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). pMMTV-rasH(Asn-17) and pMMTV-ras plasmids have been described previously (32Cai H. Szeberényi J. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5314-5323Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) and contain the dominant inhibitory H-ras Asn-17 mutation or the wild-type rasoncogene, respectively, under the control of the mouse mammary tumor virus long terminal repeat. H-35 rat hepatoma cells (or H4IIE-ATCC CRL 1548, American Type Culture Collection) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 5% newborn bovine serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 IU/ml penicillin. Cell culture reagents were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. The effect of insulin was studied in serum-starved (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.2% fetal bovine serum) confluent cells. After 3 days, 100 nm insulin (Actrapid, Novo-Nordisk, Bagsvaerd, Denmark) was added for the times indicated in each experiment. When needed, cycloheximide (Sigma) was used at a dose of 5 μg/ml 3 h prior to insulin treatment. In some experiments, MAP kinase or PI 3-kinase activities were inhibited with PD98059 (50 μm) or wortmannin (25 nm) (Calbiochem), respectively. Both inhibitors were added 30 min prior to insulin. Transfections were performed in 60-mm plates, with 4 × 105 cells/plate, using the calcium phosphate method (33Chen C. Okayama H. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 632-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Each plate was transfected with 10 μg of pME reporter plasmid in the presence of 2 μg of CMV-LUC plasmid to correct for transfection efficiency. In some experiments, wild-type or mutant MMTV-ras plasmids (5 μg/plate) or pSG-Egr-1(2–10 μg/plate) was used. The total amount of DNA was normalized using empty vector. Transfections were done in duplicate and repeated at least three times. When needed, transfected cells were serum starved for 24 h and then treated with 100 nm insulin for 24 h. Cellular extracts were prepared by four freeze-thaw cycles, and CAT and luciferase activities were determined as described previously (34Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5292) Google Scholar, 35De Wet J.R Wood K.V. Deluca M. Helinski D.R. Subramani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2482) Google Scholar). H-35 cells transfected with expression vectors for Egr-1, wild-type, or dominant negativeras constructs were assayed in parallel in Western blot experiments to assess expression of the transfected plasmids. In the case of Ras, total proteins were obtained by four freeze-thaw cycles in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 400 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 40 μg/ml aprotinin. For Egr-1, nuclear proteins were prepared as described previously (36Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2214) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined with the method of Bradford (37Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217487) Google Scholar) using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. 40 μg of total or nuclear proteins was electrophoresed in a 12% or 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gel for Ras or Egr-1, respectively, and blotted on nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). After blocking the membranes with 10% low fat dried milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20, immunodetection was performed with 5 μg/ml of a commercial antibody for Egr-1 or H-Ras (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). After probing with the antibodies, membranes were incubated with a streptavidin-conjugated anti-rabbit-specific antibody. Immunoreactive bands were visualized with the Western blotting Luminol reagent (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Total RNA from H-35 cells was extracted by the guanidinium isothiocyanate method (38Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63231) Google Scholar). Samples (30 μg) were electrophoresed in 1% agarose gels containing 2.2 mformaldehyde, blotted on Nytran membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) and hybridized with a rat Egr-1 cDNA. Hybridization and washing steps were performed as described (39Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 324-328Google Scholar). Egr-1cDNA (3.1 kilobases) was obtained from pSG-Egr-1 by digestion with EcoRI. The probe was gel purified and labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (ICN, Irvine, CA) to a specific activity of 1 × 109 cpm/μg DNA using the “Ready To Go” kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Methylene blue staining of transferred RNA was used as loading control. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described (36Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2214) Google Scholar), and protein concentrations were determined with the method of Bradford (37Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217487) Google Scholar) using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Purified human Sp1 protein was obtained from Promega (Madison, WI), and rat Egr-1 protein was translatedin vitro from pSG-Egr-1 using the coupled transcription/translation system (TNT) (Promega). The following oligonucleotides were used: IRE-II, 5′-CCC GCC CCC GCC TCC TCG CA-3′; Sp1, 5′-ATT CGA TCG GGG CGG GGC GAG-3′; and Egr-1, 5′-GGA TCC AGC GGG GGC GAG CGG GGG CGA-3′. Single-stranded oligonucleotides were end labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega) and [γ-32P]ATP (ICN), annealed, and purified using Sephadex G-25 columns (Boehringer Mannheim). EMSAs were performed essentially as described (40Santisteban P. Acebrón A. Polycarpou-Schwarz M. Di Lauro R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1310-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). 10 μg of nuclear extracts and 20,000 cpm of probe were incubated in a final volume of 20 μl with a binding mixture containing 26 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μm ZnSO4, 8 μg of poly(dI·dC), and 5% Ficoll or 20% glycerol as carrier. The samples were incubated on ice for 30 min. The same conditions were used in the reactions containing purified Sp1 (0.5 footprinting unit/reaction in the presence of 10 μg of bovine serum albumin) orin vitro translated Egr-1 (2.5 μl/reaction). For competition experiments, a 100-fold excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide was preincubated on ice with nuclear extracts 15 min prior to the addition of the probe. For supershift assays, 1 μg of anti-Sp1, anti-Sp3, or anti-Egr-1 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or preimmune antisera were preincubated overnight with nuclear extracts at 4 °C before the addition of the probe. The resulting DNA complexes were electrophoresed on a 5% polyacrylamide gel (29:1, acrylamide:bisacrylamide). Gels were run at 20 mA in a cold room in 0.5 × TBE (1 × TBE is 90 mm Tris, 90 mm boric acid, and 1 mm EDTA), vacuum dried, and visualized by autoradiography. Previous studies from our laboratory (27Garcı́a-Jiménez C. Benito B. Jolin T. Santisteban P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1361-1369PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated a direct role of insulin in the regulation of ME gene, both by transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. Those studies were performed in rat liver. In this report we have chosen H-35 rat hepatoma cells to study insulin-mediated regulation of ME because these cells respond to physiological doses of insulin (41Reuber M.D. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1961; 26: 891-899PubMed Google Scholar, 42Koontz J. Iwahashi M. Science. 1981; 211: 947-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and have been used extensively in gene expression studies (8Forest C.D. O'Brien R.M. Lucas P.D. Magnuson M.A. Granner D.K. Mol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 20144-20149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). We have found in this cell line the same regulation of ME mRNAs as in rat liver (data not shown). To define the region within the ME gene promoter responsible for the insulin response, we transiently transfected H-35 cells with several 5′-deletions of the rat ME promoter fused to the CAT gene and then treated the cells with insulin. As shown in Fig.1, the pME882 construct, which contains 882 base pairs of ME promoter, responds weakly to insulin. Serial deletions of the ME promoter increment the insulin response, with a maximum effect (3-fold) achieve by pME177. The insulin response is completely lost with a subsequent deletion of 75 base pairs (pME102), indicating that a positive IRE of the rat ME gene promoter is located between positions −177 and −102. These results are in agreement with our previous data (27Garcı́a-Jiménez C. Benito B. Jolin T. Santisteban P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1361-1369PubMed Google Scholar) that pointed out the presence of a negative IRE (referred to as IRE-I) between positions −692 and −683 of the ME promoter, and a positive IRE (referred to as IRE-II) between positions −175 and −156. As shown in Fig. 1, deletion of the putative IRE-I increments the insulin response of ME gene promoter, indicating that IRE-I could effectively behave as a negative element. The maximum positive insulin response is restricted to the region −177/−102, which contains the putative positive IRE-II, so further studies were focused on this element. To identify nuclear proteins that could bind to the −175/−156 ME promoter region (IRE-II), we first examined IRE-II sequence and compared it with the previously described IRE-A element of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene promoter. As shown in Fig. 2 A, both regions contain GC boxes, which are consensus binding sites for the transcription factor Sp1 (20Dynan W.S. Tjian R. Cell. 1983; 35: 79-87Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). We next performed a band shift assay with labeled IRE-II and nuclear extracts from H-35 cells depleted of serum for 3 days and then treated with 100 nm insulin for different times. Three different complexes (C1, C2, and C3) are detected in nuclear extracts from untreated cells, and one complex more (designated IRF) is detected only in insulin-treated cells (Fig. 2 B). All four of these complexes are specific as demonstrated by competition with unlabeled IRE-II but not with an unrelated oligonucleotide (see below). The kinetics of IRF binding to IRE-II was also examined and revealed a quick and transient induction, as IRF binding activity is already detected 30 min after the addition of insulin, is maximal with 1-h treatment (Fig. 2 B), and is undetectable after 4 h (data not shown). Because IRE-II contains putative binding sites for Sp1 (Fig.2 A), we next examined if any of the complexes detected in H-35 cells corresponded to this transcription factor or a related protein. As shown in Fig. 3 A, purified human Sp1 protein binds to IRE-II in a specific manner as its binding is competed by an excess of unlabeled IRE-II and is unaffected by an unrelated oligonucleotide. Furthermore, when nuclear extracts from H-35 cells treated with insulin for 1 h were incubated with a specific antibody anti-Sp1 (Fig. 3 B, lane 4), a supershift of C1 complex was observed, whereas an unrelated antibody had no effect (lane 5). The mobility of IRF was not affected by incubation with anti-Sp1 antibody, indicating that IRF does not contain Sp1 protein. Taken together, these results indicate that Sp1 is present in both untreated (lane 2) and insulin-treated H-35 cells, and its binding to IRE-II is not modified by the hormone. Sp3 is a closely related member of the Sp1 family of proteins which has been shown to bind to Sp1 elements in a variety of gene promoters (45Hagen G. Müller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar,46Birnbaum M.J. van Wijnen A.J. Odgren P.R. Last T.J. Suske G. Stein G. Stein J.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16503-16508Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). To investigate if any of the detected complexes bound to IRE-II corresponds to Sp3, we performed supershift assays using specific anti-Sp3 antibody. Incubation of untreated or insulin-treated H-35 cells with anti-Sp3 antibody supershifted the C2 complex (Fig.3 C, lanes 4 and 7), whereas an unrelated antibody (lanes 3 and 6) had no effect. Anti-Sp3 antibody was unable to displace IRF, indicating that this complex does not contain Sp3 protein. These results indicate that Sp3, as observed for Sp1, is constitutively bound to IRE-II in H-35 cells, and its binding is not affected by insulin. In an attempt to identify IRF, its requirement of ongoing protein synthesis was studied. We performed a band shift assay with labeled IRE-II and nuclear extracts from H-35 cells treated or not with insulin for 15 min or 1 h in the presence or absence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (Fig.4). As shown before, IRF binding activity was undetectable 15 min after treatment of H-35 cells with insulin (lane 4), and was maximal 1 h after insulin stimulation (lane 6). Cycloheximide alone did not induce IRF, although it was able to block completely the insulin ability to induce IRF binding to IRE-II (lane 6 versus lane 7). These results demonstrate that de novo protein synthesis is essential for IRF binding. The quick and transient induction of IRF binding and its dependence on protein synthesis are typical features of a subclass of genes known as immediate-early genes. Because the GC content of IRE-II is extremely high (16 base pairs out of 20) we search for immediate-early genes that bind to GC boxes. Among the candidates,Egr-1 has been described to be induced in response to insulin in a variety of cell systems including H-35 cells (47Mohn K.L. Laz T.M. Hsu J. Melby A.E. Bravo R. Taub R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 381-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) and with the same kinetics as observed for IRF. Egr-1 has been reported to bind specifically to the sequence GCG(C/G)GGGCG (23Lemaire P. Vesque C. Schmitt J. Stunnenberg H. Frank R. Charnay P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3456-3467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Cao X. Koski R.A. Gashler A. McKiernan M. Morris C.F. Gaffney R. Hay R.V. Sukhatme V.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1931-1939Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) in a zinc-dependent manner. When the IRE-II sequence was examined in more detail, we found a perfectly conserved Egr-1 binding site that overlaps the GC boxes already identified as core binding sites for Sp1. To study if IRF corresponded to Egr-1, we initially performed competition experiments. Using a radiolabeled IRE-II probe, two complexes corresponding to Sp1 and Sp3 were detected in nuclear extracts from untreated H-35 cells (Fig.5 A, lane 1). When IRE-II was incubated with nuclear extracts from cells treated with insulin for 1 h, an additional complex, IRF, was observed (lane 2). The three complexes were competed by a 100-fold excess of unlabeled IRE-II (lane 3) and were unaffected by an excess of an unrelated oligonucleotide (lane 6), indicating that all of them are specific. An oligonucleotide containing a consensus binding site for Sp1 abolished the formation of Sp1 and Sp3 complexes but did not affect IRF (lane 4). However, a 100-fold excess of an oligonucleotide containing a consensus binding site for Egr-1 completely abolished IRF binding without affecting Sp1 and Sp3 (lane 5). These data suggest that IRF could contain Egr-1 or a related protein. To study whether IRF was Egr-1 or a related protein, a similar approach using IRE-II or a consensus binding site for Egr-1 as probes was performed. Sp1 binding is detected with IRE-II probe, both in untreated (Fig. 5 B, lane 1) and insulin-treated cells (lane 2). A similar complex appears with Egr-1 probe (lane 4), but its binding is almost lost when cells were treated with insulin for 1 h (lane 5). When nuclear extracts from insulin-treated cells were used, a complex (IRF) was detected for both probes (lanes 2 and 5). The specificity of this complex was demonstrated by its competition with an excess of unlabeled Egr-1 oligonucleotide. Interestingly, an excess of IRE-II competed this insulin-induced complex as efficiently as Egr-1 (compare lanes 6 and 7). Neither an excess of an oligonucleotide with a consensus binding site for Sp1 (lane 8) nor an unrelated oligonucleotide (lane 9)"

Specific peptide/MHC class II complexes are recognized by CD4+ T cells, for example, to trigger protective immune responses. Extensive studies on the biosynthesis of MHC class II molecules have established that unlike MHC class I molecules, they intersect the endocytic pathway before their appearance on the surface (Refs. 1Cresswell P.

This diversion is essential (a) to enable proteolytic removal of the invariant chain (Ii, a specialized chaperone), and (b) to ensure admixing of MHC class II molecules with processed peptide material from endocytosed exogenous antigens. It is well established that targeting motifs within Ii are responsible for the delivery of MHC class II/Ii complexes to the endocytic pathway (6Bakke O. Dobberstein B.

Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 831-846Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but it has been more difficult to resolve the precise route taken from the Golgi apparatus to the endosome system. Much of the data on this pathway has been obtained by studying human B lymphoblastoid cells that are potent antigen-presenting cells and express high levels of MHC class II molecules. Earlier studies in these cells have shown that most MHC class II molecules that have assembled with peptide are found in late endosomes or lysosomes before their expression on the cell surface (11Peters P.J. Neefjes J.J. Oorschot V. Ploegh H.L. Geuze H.J. Nature. 1991; 349: 669-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar, 12West M.A. Lucocq J.M. Watts C.

Med. 1995; 182: 325-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). This observation suggested that transport might occur directly from the Golgi network to the late endosomes/MHC class II compartments, and several studies appear to support this possibility (14Benaroch P. Yilla M. Raposo G. Ito K. Miwa K. Geuze H.J. Ploegh H.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 15Morton P.A. Zacheis M.L. Giacoletto K.S. Manning J.A. Schwartz B.D. J.

However, reports that some Ii could be detected on the surface of antigen-presenting cells (17Wraight C.J. van Endert P. Moller P. Lipp J. Ling N.R. MacLennan I.C. Koch N. Moldenhauer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5787-5792Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were followed by a direct biochemical demonstration of the transient appearance of newly synthesized class II/Ii complexes on the cell surface (18Koch N. Moldenhauer G. Hofmann W.J. Moller P. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 2643-2651PubMed Google Scholar, 19Roche P.A. Teletski C.L. Stang E. Bakke O. Long E.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In addition, a recent reappraisal of the steady-state distribution of Ii, MHC class II molecules, and other markers in human B lymphoblastoid cells indicates the presence of class II/Ii complexes in early endosomes (21Kleijmeer M.J. Morkowski S. Griffith J.M. Rudensky A.Y. Geuze H.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 639-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In murine B cells, there is also evidence that newly synthesized MHC class II molecules are found in early endosomes (22Castellino F. Germain R.N. Immunity. 1995; 2: 73-88Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 23Brachet V. Raposo G. Amigorena S. Mellman I. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 51-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) as well as in later compartments (24Rudensky A.Y. Maric M. Eastman S. Shoemaker L. De Roos P.C. Blum J.S. Immunity. 1994; 1: 585-594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 25Qiu Y. Xu X. Wandinger Ness A. Dalke D.P. Pierce S.K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Thus, morphological and biochemical evidence indicates that in human B lymphoblastoid cells, at least a proportion of newly synthesized MHC class II/Ii complexes are found on the cell surface or in early endosomes before Ii processing and peptide loading. However, using these techniques, it is difficult to determine what fraction of molecules travel by this route. Morphology can only reveal steady-state MHC class II/Ii levels that may be low for rapidly traversed sectors of the pathway. Similarly, asychronous kinetics of MHC class II molecule transport through the secretory and endocytic pathway make it difficult to establish exactly what proportion of molecules must pass through a particular sector. One way of resolving this issue would be to selectively block the early part of the endocytic pathway and to assess the ability of MHC class II molecules to mature in these cells. If traffic through the cell surface or early endosomes is obligatory, maturation should be blocked under these conditions. On the other hand, if MHC class II molecules can target from the Golgi to both early and late endocytic compartments, the ablation of the early part of the pathway should not disrupt trafficking to later elements, and successful MHC class II molecule maturation should occur. To date, this type of approach has given rise to somewhat contradictory results. Using concanamycin B to block transport from early to late endosomes, Benaroch et al. (14Benaroch P. Yilla M. Raposo G. Ito K. Miwa K. Geuze H.J. Ploegh H.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) showed that newly synthesized MHC class II molecules appeared only slowly on the cell surface and were not accessible to endocytosed neuraminidase. They concluded that the major route was direct transport from the Golgi to late endosomes and/or MHC class II compartments (14Benaroch P. Yilla M. Raposo G. Ito K. Miwa K. Geuze H.J. Ploegh H.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In contrast, Wang et al. (26Wang K. Peterson P.A. Karlsson L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17055-17060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) recently analyzed MHC class II molecule maturation in transfected HeLa cells expressing a dominant negative mutant of the GTPase dynamin, which is required for endocytosis through clathrin-coated pits. In these cells, MHC class II molecules failed to mature, indicating that transport via the cell surface was the major route followed by newly synthesized MHC class II molecules (26Wang K. Peterson P.A. Karlsson L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17055-17060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Because of these contradictory results, and because of the possibility that trafficking of ectopically expressed MHC class II molecules in cells such as HeLa might be different from trafficking in bona fide antigen-presenting cells, we have reassessed the importance of the early endosome system in MHC class II maturation in human B lymphoblastoid cells. To do this, we have used a peroxidase-ablation technique that allows selected domains of the endocytic pathway to be inactivated in intact cells. Here we show that ablation of early endosome function in human EBV-B cells prevents detectable maturation of MHC class II molecules as measured by Ii processing and peptide binding. These results are consistent with a model that involves obligatory passage of MHC class II molecules through the early endosome system before transport to the sites of Ii processing and peptide loading. Human EBV-transformed cell lines FC4 and EDR have been described previously (12West M.A. Lucocq J.M. Watts C. Nature. 1994; 369: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Pala cells were a kind gift from P. Cresswell. All cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium or in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented as described previously (27Pond L. Watts C. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 543-553PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were pre-incubated in methionine and cysteine-free medium (MEM; Sigma) for 15–30 min at 37 °C before labeling. 35S-Translabel (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added to a final concentration of 0.5–1.0 mCi/ml for 15–30 min as indicated, and then the cells were washed in DHB. The cells were resuspended in DHB containing 2 mm methionine and, where indicated, 10 μg/ml transferrin-horseradish peroxidase (Tf-HRP) conjugate at 37 °C. In some experiments, leupeptin (Sigma) was included at a final concentration of 1 mm. After Tf-HRP loading, the cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in DHB for peroxidase-mediated ablation. Human transferrin was conjugated to HRP exactly as described previously (27Pond L. Watts C. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 543-553PubMed Google Scholar). The Tf-HRP conjugate was used at 10 μg/ml and loaded at 37 °C in DHB medium for 20 min or for the times indicated. Peroxide and DAB-mediated ablation was performed essentially as described previously (27Pond L. Watts C. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 543-553PubMed Google Scholar), except that the removal of surface-bound Tf-HRP by acid treatment was made unnecessary by the use of ascorbic acid to quench any extracellular peroxidase activity (28Stoorvogel W. Oorschot V. Geuze H.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 21-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Cells (107 cells/ml) were resuspended in 85 mm NaCl, 50 mm ascorbic acid, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and 0.01% H2O2, with or without 1.5 mg/ml DAB. The two aliquots were incubated in the dark for 30 min at 0 °C. After peroxidase-mediated ablation, the cells were washed extensively and either prepared for immunoprecipitation (see below) or, in some experiments, subjected to an additional chase at 37 °C in complete Iscove's medium supplemented with 2 mm methionine. The viability of the cells after the peroxidase-mediated ablation and subsequent chase steps was ∼90%. For precipitation of MHC class II complexes, cells were lysed at 2 × 107 cells/ml in lysis buffer as described previously (12West M.A. Lucocq J.M. Watts C. Nature. 1994; 369: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). After centrifugation (14,000 rpm, 2 min, 4 °C) to remove nuclei and cell debris, the supernatants were subjected to pre-clearing with Pansorbin (Calbiochem). In some experiments, a second pre-clearing step was performed with protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The pre-cleared lysates were incubated with mAb DA6.231 (29Guy K. van Heyningen V. Cohen B.B. Deane D.L. Steel C.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1982; 12: 942-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) for 1 h at 0 °C followed by protein G-Sepharose for 1 h. The washed immunoprecipitates were eluted in SDS sample buffer at 25 °C or at 95 °C, as indicated, and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described previously (27Pond L. Watts C. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 543-553PubMed Google Scholar). For reprecipitation of MHC class II-associated Ii molecules, washed DA6.231 immunoprecipitates were resuspended in 50 μl of phosphate-buffered saline/1% SDS and eluted at 95 °C for 5 min. The eluted proteins were transferred to 950 μl of lysis buffer, and Ii molecules were immunoprecipitated using mAb VIC-Y1 (30Quaranta V. Majdic O. Stingl G. Liszda K. Honigsmann H. Knapp W. J. Immunol. 1984; 132: 1900-1905PubMed Google Scholar). To capture Ig secreted during chase incubations, cells were removed by centrifugation, and the supernatants (∼1.0 ml) were incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with protein A-Sepharose or fixedStaphylococcus aureus cells (Pansorbin; Calbiochem). The beads or bacteria were washed several times in Tris-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100 and once in Tris-buffered saline before the elution of immunoglobulin into SDS sample buffer. Fluorescence microscopy of peroxidase-ablated cells was performed essentially as described previously (27Pond L. Watts C. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 543-553PubMed Google Scholar). After peroxidase-mediated ablation as described above, the cells (5 × 104 cells in 0.5 ml) were resuspended at 106cells/ml, and aliquots (0.05 ml) were spun onto a microscope slide in a Cytospin centrifuge (800 rpm, 4 min; Shandon Scientific, Runcorn, United Kingdom). The cells were fixed in 3.7% HCHO, quenched, and permeabilized and pre-blocked with 0.2% saponin and 0.2% fish skin gelatin as described previously (27Pond L. Watts C. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 543-553PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were incubated with primary antibodies diluted in saponin/fish skin gelatin/phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min and then washed extensively before incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies. Antibodies were as follows: (a) transferrin receptor, mAb OKT9; (b) MHC class II, mAb DA6.231; and (c) TGN-46, sheep antiserum to human TGN-46 (final concentration, 10 μg/ml; a kind gift of S.Ponnambalam). Secondary antibodies were fluorescein isothiocyanate-coupled donkey anti-mouse or anti-sheep Ig (Jackson Laboratories). The cells were mounted in Citifluor and viewed on a Zeiss Axioplan microscope. Images were recorded using a Kodak DCS 420 digital camera and processed using Adobe Photoshop software. To assess whether or not functional early endosomes are required for newly synthesized MHC class II molecules to reach the sites of Ii processing and peptide loading, we used a peroxidase-mediated compartment ablation technique. As described previously, this technique allows selective ablation within intact cells of those compartments to which HRP has been targeted (12West M.A. Lucocq J.M. Watts C. Nature. 1994; 369: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar,27Pond L. Watts C. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 543-553PubMed Google Scholar, 31Stoorvogel W. Schwartz A.L. Strous G.J. Fallon R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5438-5444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Ajioka R.S. Kaplan J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6445-6449Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). For example, Tf-HRP conjugates selectively ablate early endosomes and recycling endosomes. The DAB polymerization reaction is controlled in all experiments by the omission or inclusion of DAB monomer. We asked first whether newly synthesized MHC class II molecules could mature to yield SDS-stable αβ dimers in cells lacking functional early endosomes. The human EBV-transformed B cell line FC4 was pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine and then loaded with Tf-HRP for 30 min. Cell aliquots were exposed to DAB alone or to DAB plus H2O2 at 0 °C and then chased at 37 °C for different times. As shown in Fig.1, cells chased in the presence of H2O2 alone showed a band of approximately 60 kDa that increased in intensity during the chase and disappeared upon heating the sample to 95 °C. However, in cells exposed to H2O2 and DAB to allow polymer formation, SDS-stable dimers failed to appear during the chase. This result suggested that functional early endosomes are required for successful MHC class II molecule maturation. To confirm that compartment ablation had been selective in these cells, we assessed the integrity of different compartments by fluorescence microscopy. Cells loaded with Tf-HRP and exposed to H2O2 alone showed staining for intracellular transferrin receptor, the trans-Golgi marker TGN-46, and MHC class II molecules (Fig. Figure 2, Figure 3, a,c, and e). Cell surface staining for transferrin receptors and MHC class II molecules was also observed. In contrast, in cells incubated with H2O2 and DAB, intracellular staining of transferrin receptors could no longer be detected (Fig. 2 b). Importantly, both intracellular MHC class II and TGN-46 labeling were unaffected by Tf-HRP-catalyzed DAB polymerization, demonstrating selective ablation of a defined sector of the endocytic pathway (Fig. 2, d and f) and making it unlikely that the failure of MHC class II molecules to mature was simply due to the ablation of the Golgi apparatus by low levels of transferrin receptor trafficking through this compartment (33Stoorvogel W. Geuze H.J. Griffith J.M. Strous G.J. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1821-1829Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Quantitative immunoblotting for TGN-46 confirmed that there was no loss of this marker in ablated cells (data not shown).Figure 3The leupeptin-induced Ii peptide (LIP) does not appear in cells lacking functional early endosomes. EBV-B cells (clone EDR) were labeled with35S-Translabel in the presence of 1 mmleupeptin. After 15 min, the cells were washed and resuspended in Tf-HRP plus leupeptin. After a 30-min loading at 37 °C, the cells were divided and incubated at 4 °C in H2O2with or without DAB. After further incubation at 37 °C for the times shown, MHC class II molecules and associated Ii fragments were immunoprecipitated with the DA6.231 mAb.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) A requirement for early endosomes in MHC class II molecule maturation could be explained either by a specific requirement for MHC class II molecule traffic through these compartments or by a requirement for the delivery of some other factor, for example, processed peptide material, to downstream sites of MHC class II molecule maturation. In the latter case, early endosomes would still be required even if the targeting of newly synthesized MHC class II molecules themselves was direct. To analyze the transport and maturation of MHC class II molecules in a way that did not depend on peptide availability and SDS-stable dimer formation, we asked whether Ii processing was taking place in cells lacking functional early endosomes. We took advantage of the fact that defined intermediates in Ii processing can be amplified in cells treated with leupeptin. In particular, an Ii-processing intermediate (leupeptin-induced peptide) of around 22 kDa accumulates in leupeptin-treated cells (34Blum J.S. Cresswell P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3975-3979Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). As before, pulse-labeled EBV-B cells were loaded with Tf-HRP and then incubated with H2O2 in the presence or absence of DAB. To amplify Ii-processing intermediates, the cells were additionally incubated in the presence of leupeptin. As expected, under these conditions, we could not detect the accumulation of SDS-stable dimers (data not shown). Instead, after 60 min of chase, we observed the accumulation of the Ii-derived leupeptin-induced peptide fragment in Tf-HRP-loaded cells that had been treated with H2O2 alone after Tf-HRP loading but not in cells treated with DAB and H2O2. Thus, in cells lacking functional early endosomes, class II/Ii complexes cannot access the sites of Ii processing. To substantiate the above finding (and to rule out the possibility that leupeptin failed to reach the relevant compartments in the ablated cells), we analyzed the processing of Ii/MHC class II complexes in Pala cells in which Ii-processing intermediates can be readily detected even in the absence of protease inhibitors (for example, see Ref. 35Riberdy J.M. Avva R.R. Geuze H.J. Cresswell P. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1225-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.4 a, a particularly prominent fragment migrating with an apparent size of ∼14 kDa was readily observed, was most prominent after 150 min of chase, and declined thereafter. To confirm that this fragment arose from the N terminus of Ii, we treated immunoprecipitates of MHC class II molecules at 95 °C and reprecipitated them with VIC-Y1 antibody, which is specific for the N-terminal cytosolic domain of Ii (30Quaranta V. Majdic O. Stingl G. Liszda K. Honigsmann H. Knapp W. J. Immunol. 1984; 132: 1900-1905PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4 b, the p14 fragment (as well as larger forms of Ii) was precipitated under these conditions, confirming that it is an N-terminal fragment of the Ii. We next established the location of the MHC class II molecules associated with this p14 Ii fragment with respect to the early endosome system. Cells were pulse-labeled, chased for different times in the presence of Tf-HRP, and then incubated at 0 °C in the presence of H2O2 with or without DAB. As shown in Fig.4 a, ablation of early endosomes using this protocol did not result in any significant loss of the p14 Ii fragment, indicating that it was accumulating downstream of early endosomes, as defined by the itinerary of the recycling Tf-HRP conjugate (Fig. 4 a). This is fully consistent with our earlier data that showed that the majority of both biochemically detectable SDS-stable MHC class II dimers and peptide/class II complexes detectable by T cells are found in late endosomes/lysosomes before expression on the cell surface (12West M.A. Lucocq J.M. Watts C. Nature. 1994; 369: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 27Pond L. Watts C. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 543-553PubMed Google Scholar). However, when early endosomes were ablated after pulse labeling but before the chase (pulse-ablate-chase protocol), the appearance of both the Ii p14 fragment and an Ii fragment around 22 kDa was completely abolished (Fig. 5 a). Quantitation of a second experiment clearly showed that neither of these Ii fragments is produced in cells lacking functional early endosomes (Fig. 5 b). However, transport of class II/Ii complexes through the Golgi complex still occurred, as indicated by the conversion of oligosaccharides on the MHC class II β chain from their immature to mature state (Fig. 5, b and c). To demonstrate unequivocally that selective ablation of early endosomes accounted for the failure of MHC class II molecules to mature, we asked whether secretory protein traffic could still occur in the HRP-ablated cells. After first establishing that Pala secretes immunoglobulin into the medium like other EBV-transformed cell lines, we pulse-labeled cells with [35S]methionine/cysteine, loaded them with Tf-HRP, and ablated the Tf-HRP-positive compartments as described above. After reincubation at 37 °C for different times, both the cells and the reincubation medium were retained for separate analysis. Any Ig secreted into the medium during the chase was captured on protein A and analyzed on a 10% SDS gel. As shown in Fig.6 a, radiolabeled Ig heavy and light chains appeared in the medium during the chase from cells incubated in H2O2 alone but also, importantly, from cells incubated in H2O2 and DAB. This demonstrates that compartment ablation under our conditions of Tf-HRP loading is confined to early endosomes and does not extend into the secretory pathway. Ablation of early endosomes in this experiment was successful because in the same cells, we observed, as before, a virtually complete blockade in Ii processing (Fig. 6 b). Quantitation of Ig secretion in several experiments indicated that there was a lag in the ablated cells relative to the non-ablated cells (Fig. 6 b). We do not know the reason for this, but one possibility is that the ablation of the early endosome system interferes with the recycling of soluble or membrane-bound proteins that may be needed for optimal secretory pathway traffic. In any case, it is clear that the secretory pathway is still functional in the ablated cells, as judged by both β chain maturation and by Ig secretion. Taken together, these data demonstrate that a functional early endosome system is required for the successful maturation of newly synthesized MHC class II molecules. This is true despite the fact that the products of maturation (Ii-processing intermediates and peptide/αβ dimers) accumulate downstream of these compartments. Several previous studies have investigated how newly synthesized MHC class II/Ii complexes are delivered to the endocytic pathway. As outlined under “Introduction,” class II/Ii complexes have been detected not only in later endosomal and lysosomal compartments, but also at much lower levels in early endosomes and, indeed, on the cell surface (17Wraight C.J. van Endert P.

Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This has led to a model whereby at least some MHC class II/Ii complexes leaving the Golgi apparatus are transported initially to the earliest parts of the endocytic pathway and/or the cell surface. However, other evidence indicates that MHC class II/Ii complexes are directly targeted to later endosomal and lysosomal compartments (13Peters P.J. Raposo G. Neefjes J.J. Oorschot V.

Here, we have used a new approach to address this important question. Selective inactivation or ablation of intracellular compartments can be achieved by targeting HRP to those compartments. This has been achieved on the secretory pathway by expression of a secreted form of HRP (38Connolly C.N. Futter C.E. Gibson A. Hopkins C.R. Cutler D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 641-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and in the endocytic pathway by endocytosis of HRP conjugated to transferrin or other endocytosed ligands including antigens (12West M.A. Lucocq J.M. Watts C. Nature. 1994; 369: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 27Pond L. Watts C. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 543-553PubMed Google Scholar, 31Stoorvogel W. Schwartz A.L. Strous G.J.

A. 1986; 83: 6445-6449Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). By functionally inactivating the earliest compartments of the endocytic pathway in this way, we have been able to ask whether or not it is required for successful MHC class II/Ii maturation. We find that the invariant chain is not processed and that SDS-stable class II/peptide dimers do not assemble in cells whose early endosomes have been inactivated. The possibility that our internalized Tf-HRP conjugate functionally inactivated later endosomes or lysosomes is rendered very unlikely by our earlier demonstration that this conjugate recycles efficiently (27Pond L. Watts C. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 543-553PubMed Google Scholar), does not ablate the major cellular MHC class II compartments (Ref. 12West M.A. Lucocq J.M. Watts C. Nature. 1994; 369: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar and Fig. 2), and does not affect compartments in which processed fragments of Ii accumulate (Fig. 4 a). Moreover, whereas Tf-HRP can access the Golgi complex in some cell types (33Stoorvogel W. Geuze H.J. Griffith J.M. Strous G.J. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1821-1829Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), this did not occur under the conditions of loading we used because in Tf-HRP-loaded and ablated cells, immunodetection of the trans-Golgi marker TGN-46 was still observed, oligosaccharide maturation on MHC class II β chains still occurred, and immunoglobulin was still secreted into the culture medium. Taken together with our own earlier data (12West M.A. Lucocq J.M. Watts C. Nature. 1994; 369: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 27Pond L. Watts C. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 543-553PubMed Google Scholar), this result suggests a model for MHC class II maturation in human B cells (Fig.7). Three principal points can be made. First, as shown previously (12West M.A. Lucocq J.M. Watts C. Nature. 1994; 369: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) and in this study (Fig. 4 a), the products of MHC class II maturation, namely, invariant chain processing intermediates and SDS-stable αβ dimers, accumulate, for the most part, downstream of transferrin-positive early endosomes, as judged by their resistance to Tf-HRP-mediated cross-linking. Second, these early endosomes were not necessary for the transport of assembled peptide/αβ complexes to the cell surface, as measured by the biologically relevant assay of T-cell stimulation (27Pond L. Watts C. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 543-553PubMed Google Scholar). Third, despite this lack of involvement of early endosomes in the later stages of MHC class II/peptide assembly and surface transport, they are nonetheless an essential gateway through which the majority of newly synthesized MHC class II molecules must pass to reach the sites of Ii processing and peptide loading. We therefore propose that the points of entry and exit of newly synthesized MHC class II molecules along the endocytic pathway are different. Newly synthesized MHC class II/Ii complexes are delivered primarily into early transferrin receptor-positive domains but leave, once peptide-loaded, primarily from later transferrin receptor-negative domains (Fig. 7). As also documented by others, transport of MHC class II molecules between these domains is accompanied by Ii processing and peptide loading (18Koch N. Moldenhauer G. Hofmann W.J. Moller P. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 2643-2651PubMed Google Scholar, 19Roche P.A. Teletski C.L. Stang E. Bakke O. Long E.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 639-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) have reassessed the steady-state distribution of MHC class II molecules, Ii, and other markers of the endocytic pathway in both human and murine B-cell lines. In a human EBV-transformed B-cell line similar to those used in our study, they defined up to six different types of structures involved in MHC class II maturation. Their analysis revealed Ii, presumably associated with MHC class II, in the so called “early” MHC class II compartments and, to some extent, in conventional early endosomes (21Kleijmeer M.J. Morkowski S. Griffith J.M. Rudensky A.Y. Geuze H.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 639-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). They proposed that MHC class II/Ii complexes leaving the Golgi apparatus target to a variety of endosomal structures. Our results are consistent with this study and with other studies that reported the presence of newly synthesized MHC class II molecules in low-density, early endosomes and/or on the cell surface (19Roche P.A. Teletski C.L. Stang E. Bakke O. Long E.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8581-8585Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 20Warmerdam P.A. Long E.O. Roche P.A. J.

Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The requirement that we observe for functional transferrin receptor-positive endosomes now suggests that the input of MHC class II/Ii does not occur later than type 3 structures as defined by Kleijmeer et al. (21Kleijmeer M.J. Morkowski S. Griffith J.M. Rudensky A.Y. Geuze H.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 639-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). MHC/Ii complexes found in later compartments must therefore traffic there from earlier transferrin-positive endosomes. Our results are more difficult to reconcile with studies that indicate that direct transport of MHC class II/Ii complexes to later endocytic compartments occurs. In part, this might be explained by the difficulties noted above of detecting rapid passage through compartments in which MHC class II molecules do not accumulate. When traffic from early to late endosomes was disrupted by the vacuolar H+-ATPase inhibitor concanamycin B, MHC class II molecules did not appear to accumulate in early endosomes, as might have been expected if early endosomes are the principal target of post-Golgi vesicles carrying class II molecules (14Benaroch P. Yilla M. Raposo G. Ito K. Miwa K. Geuze H.J. Ploegh H.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Conceivably, concanamycin B interferes not only with normal early to late endosome traffic, but also with normal fusion of Golgi-derived vesicles with early endosomes. This could explain why Ii degradation was strongly inhibited in concanamycin B-treated cells and why the accumulated MHC class II/Ii complexes were not accessible to endocytosed tracers (14Benaroch P. Yilla M. Raposo G. Ito K. Miwa K. Geuze H.J. Ploegh H.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The compartment ablation technique we have used cannot easily determine what proportion of newly synthesized complexes reach early endosomes via the cell surface or, instead, directly from the Golgi apparatus. Using a mutant of dynamin that blocks clathrin-coated pit function, Wang et al. (26Wang K. Peterson P.A. Karlsson L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17055-17060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) recently provided convincing evidence that a majority of complexes in transfected HeLa cells reach early endosomes via the cell surface. It remains to be established whether this is also the case in bona fide antigen-presenting cells such as B lymphocytes or whether both routes are used to direct newly synthesized MHC class II molecules to early endosomes, as indicated by other studies (37Warmerdam P.A.M. Long E.O. Roche P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 41Saudrais C. Spehner D. de la Salle H. Bohbot A. Cazenave J.P. Goud B. Hanau D. Salamero J. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2597-2607PubMed Google Scholar). Passage through the early endosome system via the cell surface or by direct transport from the Golgi apparatus to early endosomes should ensure exposure of the maturing population of MHC class II molecules to the full range of processed antigenic material. The fact that lysosomal hydrolases also appear to be targeted initially to the earliest parts of the endocytic pathway (39Ludwig T. Griffiths G. Hoflack B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1561-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 40Rijnboutt S. Stoorvogel W. Geuze H.J. Strous G.J. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W1967975669,"Many cell lines derived from neuroblastoma (NB) carry the wild-type p53 gene with a p53-dependent apoptotic pathway that is responsive to DNA damaging agents. A recent study has demonstrated that retinoic acid (RA) pretreatment of NB cells promotes chemoresistance to apoptosis induced by chemotherapeutic agents. We examine here the possible contribution of the p53 pathway to the chemoresistance response associated with the RA treatment in NB cells. Upon treatment with RA (1–10 μm) for 4 days, the human NB cells, SH-SY5Y, developed resistance selectively to p53-dependent apoptotic stimuli including γ-irradiation, etoposide, and 1-(5-isoquinolinyl sulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine (H-7). Interestingly, RA affected the ability of H-7 to induce nuclear accumulation of the p53 protein without altering its effect on elevating the steady-state level of p53, suggesting that drug-induced up-regulation and nuclear accumulation of the wild-type p53 protein are separable processes. The modulation of nuclear import of p53 protein by RA may thus represent a potential mechanism by which certain tumor cells with the wild-type p53 gene develop resistance to chemotherapeutic agents.

It is well established that tumor cells are able to acquire resistance to chemotherapeutic agents through a variety of mechanisms including enhanced drug metabolism, altered drug accumulation, drug-target amplification, and repair of damaged drug target (1Biedler J.L. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 666-678PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, induction of apoptosis has been discovered as a novel mechanism by which many anti-neoplastic therapies achieve their therapeutic effects (2Dive C. Hickman J.A. Br. J.

Wild-type p53 protein is expressed in many of the cell lines derived from NB (10Davidoff A.M. Pence J.C. Shorter N.A. Iglehart J.D. Marks J.R. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 127-133PubMed Google Scholar). However, the p53 protein is found to be restricted primarily to the cytoplasmic compartment of the NB cells (11Moll U.M. LaQuaglia M. Benard J. Riou G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4407-4411Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). This finding has led to the proposal that the p53-mediated response in NB cells is impaired because of an unknown cytoplasmic sequestration mechanism that prevents its translocation into the nucleus (11Moll U.M.

All-trans-retinoic acid (RA) and many of its natural and synthetic derivatives, collectively known as retinoids, have been investigated extensively as potential therapeutics for human cancer because of their effects in inhibiting cell proliferation, inducing cell differentiation, and promoting apoptosis in many types of cancer, including NBs (14Aboseif S.R.

The activities of retinoids are mediated by a network of RA receptors (RARs) and retinoid X receptors (RXRs) (18Yu V.C. Delsert C. Andersen B. Holloway J.M. Devary O.V. Naar A.M. Kim S.Y. Boutin J.M.

RA can also be metabolized to several active metabolitesin vivo, including 9-cis-RA, the high-affinity ligand for RXR (22Heyman R.A. Mangelsdorf D.J. Dyck J.A. Stein R.B. Eichele G. Evans R.M. Thaller C. Cell. 1992; 68: 397-406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1570) Google Scholar). In addition, RXRs are also known to heterodimerize with RARs and a subset of other nuclear receptors and co-regulator molecules to participate in a complex array of signaling events (18Yu V.C.

Besides having a role in differentiation, RA has also been implicated in mediating apoptosis in NB cells (23Piacentini M. Annicchiarico-Petruzzelli M. Oliviero S. Piredda L. Biedler J.L. Melino G. Int. J. Cancer. 1992; 52: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Paradoxically, a recent study has shown that treatment of NB cells with RA resulted in the development of resistance to apoptosis induced by chemotherapeutic agents (24Lasorella A. Iavarone A. Israel M.A. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4711-4716PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we examine the possible contribution of the p53 pathway in the chemoresistance response rendered by RA treatment in the NB cell line, SH-SY5Y. RA treatment was found to confer resistance selectively to p53-dependent apoptotic stimuli in these cells. The effect was associated with the suppression of H-7-induced nuclear accumulation rather than the enhancement of protein stability of wild-type p53 protein in SH-SY5Y cells, suggesting that drug-induced up-regulation and nuclear accumulation of the p53 protein are separable processes. Isoquinoline (1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine; H-7) and staurosporine were purchased from RBI.N-Acetyl-d-erythro-sphingosine was from Calbiochem. All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise indicated. The human neuroblastoma cell lines SH-SY5Y, LA-N-5, and IMR-32 have been described previously (13Ronca F. Chan S.L. Yu V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4252-4260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). RPMI 1640 medium was supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and antibiotics (100 mg/ml streptomycin and 100 IU/ml penicillin, Life Technologies, Inc.). H-7 was dissolved in water; all the other compounds were dissolved in Me2SO-ethanol (1:1). The cells were grown to subconfluence and then treated with RA for different durations and with different concentrations of RA. The medium was replaced every 48 h. When reagents dissolved in Me2SO-ethanol were used, equal volume of the solvent was added to the control cells. The following antibodies were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY): anti-p53 monoclonal antibody P21020 that recognizes the C terminus of the human p53 protein, anti-RB monoclonal antibody, and anti-ICH-1L monoclonal antibody. Anti-p53 (DO-1) monoclonal antibody, anti-Bcl-2 (100) monoclonal antibody, rabbit anti-Bcl-xL/S (S-19), anti-Bax (N-20), anti-c-Jun/AP-1 (N), and anti-c-Myc (A-14) polyclonal antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-p53 (Ab-2) monoclonal antibody was purchased from Oncogene Science (Uniondale, NY). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and anti-rabbit IgG were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Buckinghamshire, UK). Drug-induced cytotoxicity was assessed by (3-[4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay carried out in 96-well microtiter plates. The cells were treated with RA for different durations and concentrations, as described in the figure legends, and then exposed to the apoptotic drugs for additional 24 h. 3 h before the end of drug treatment, MTT was added to each well to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml and incubated at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by removing the supernatant and the dye was dissolved by adding 100 μl Me2SO and 10 μl of Sorensen glycine buffer (0.1 m glycine, 0.1m NaCl, pH 10.5), followed by thorough mixing. In a parallel set of experiments, the cells were exposed to the indicated amounts of ionizing radiation at a dose rate of 1 Gy/min in a137Cs γ-irradiator and then incubated at 37 °C for 6 h before the MTT assay was performed. The plates were read at 562 nm on a Ceres 900 microtiter plate reader (Bio-tek Instruments Inc.). The means and standard deviations were derived from six replicates. Cells were grown on 60-mm tissue culture dishes (Nunc). After drug treatment, the cells were harvested, washed once with ice-cold PBS, resuspended in 250 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 20 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.5% v/v Triton X-100) in a microcentrifuge tube, and the samples were incubated at room temperature for 15 min. After centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 5 min, the supernatant was transferred to another microcentrifuge tube and sequential extractions were carried out. The samples were extracted once with equal volume of phenol, once with phenol-chloroform (1:1), and once with chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (24:1). DNA was precipitated with 0.1 volume of 3 m sodium acetate, pH 4.8, and 2.5 volumes of ethanol at −20 °C overnight. The DNA was then pelleted at 16,000 × g for 30 min the next day. After washing once with 70% ethanol, the samples were digested with 0.1 μg of RNase A at 37 °C for 30 min before loading onto 1.5% agarose gels and the DNA was visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Cells were grown in 90-mm dishes, cultured, and treated as described. To prepare the whole cell lysates, the medium was removed and cells were washed twice with ice-cold Tris buffered saline (TBS) (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.6) and lysed with 500 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm PMSF, 2 mm benzamidine, 10 mg/ml aprotinin, 10 mg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate) for 15 min. The lysed cells were transferred into 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes, centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were collected. To prepare the nuclear extracts, the cells were washed with cold PBS twice, and detached from plates by adding 1 ml of detachment buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 40 mm Tris, pH 7.6) for 5 min at room temperature. The cells were then transferred to microcentrifuge tubes and centrifuged at 300 × g for 4 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in 400 μl of cold buffer A (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF, 2 mm benzamidine, 10 mg/ml aprotinin, 10 mg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate) and incubated on ice for 15 min. 10 μl of 10% Nonidet P-40 was added, and the mixture was vortexed briefly. Nuclei were pelleted by centrifuging at 2800 × g for 4 min at 4 °C and then resuspended in 50 μl of ice-cold buffer B (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmDTT, 1 mm PMSF, 2 mm benzamidine, 10 mg/ml aprotinin, 10 mg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate). The mixture was shaken vigorously for 15 min at 4 °C, centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was collected. The protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay (25Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217507) Google Scholar). Total cell lysates or nuclear extracts, volume adjusted according to the protein concentration, were resolved by 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), and the proteins were transferred to 0.2-μm pore size nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Filters were blocked with TBS containing 3% nonfat dry milk and 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) for 3 h at room temperature and probed with primary antibodies diluted according to the supplier's instructions for 1 h in the above buffer. The filters were then washed three times with TBST containing 0.1% Tween 20, probed with a 1:10,000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), washed again in TBST, and developed using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To ensure identical amounts of protein extracts from different conditions were loaded, a duplicate set of 10% SDS-PAGE gels was routinely prepared and the gel was subjected to Coomassie staining to allow a visual inspection of the overall protein staining patterns. Cells were seeded onto glass coverslips and treated with various reagents after which monolayers were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, pH 7.4. The immunofluorescence staining procedure has been described previously (26Yee K.S. Yu V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5366-5374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were fixed for 3 min at 4 °C with absolute methanol (−20 °C). The washing step with PBS was then repeated once. The cells were blocked at 37 °C for 30 min with 2% bovine serum albumin, 5% fetal bovine serum, 5% normal goat serum in PBS. The cells were incubated at room temperature for 45 min with the monoclonal anti-p53 (Ab-2) antibody in blocking buffer and washed with PBS. The cells were then incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR). After washing, the coverslips were mounted in 80% glycerol in PBS containing 1 mg/mlp-phenylenediamine, and examined with a Zeiss Axioplan microscope. Cells were grown in 90-mm plates, treated with solvent or RA for 4 days and then subjected to 50 μm H-7. The cells were labeled by incubation for 3 h in methionine-free medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with dialyzed fetal bovine serum and 25 μCi/ml [35S]methionine (NEN Life Science Products). After the labeling, the cells were washed three times with PBS before refeeding with fresh medium and then harvested 2, 4, 6, and 8 h later. The cells were lysed in lysis buffer (10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate and 0.1% SDS, 1 mm PMSF, and 2 mg/ml aprotinin) and subjected to centrifugation at 140,000 ×g at 4 °C for 20 min. Radioactivities of the supernatants collected were determined by scintillation counting, and protein concentrations were determined. Immunoprecipitation of p53 protein was performed from samples containing equivalent amount of total cellular protein. The lysates were incubated with 1 μg of p53 monoclonal antibody, DO-1, at 4 °C for 1 h. The immune complexes were bound with protein A (4 °C, 1 h), followed by three washes with lysis buffer. Finally, samples were denatured by boiling in SDS-loading buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 10% glycerol, 25 μm β-mercaptoethanol) and loaded onto a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Autoradiography was then performed on the dried gel. The intensities of the bands were quantitated with a phosphorimager using ImageQuantTM(Molecular Dynamics). To facilitate our investigation into the mechanism underlying the chemoresistance response in the neuroblastoma cells, SH-SY5Y, associated with RA treatment (24Lasorella A. Iavarone A. Israel M.A. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4711-4716PubMed Google Scholar), we evaluated the effect of RA on cellular levels of a panel of proteins known to have a role in various apoptosis pathways, with and without H-7 treatment. Many of these proteins are known activators or suppressors (e.g.Bcl-xL/S, Bcl-2, Bax, c-Myc, RB) of apoptosis, and their expressions in SH-SY5Y cells have been documented (13Ronca F. Chan S.L. Yu V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4252-4260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 27Hanada M. Krajewski S. Tanaka S. Cazals-Hatem D. Spengler B.A. Ross R.A. Biedler J.L. Reed J.C. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4978-4986PubMed Google Scholar, 28Hammerling U. Bjelfman C. Pahlman S. Oncogene. 1987; 2: 73-77PubMed Google Scholar). Protein levels were evaluated by Western analyses. With the exception of Bcl-2 and p53, no changes were noted in levels of all the proteins tested in mock- or RA-treated cells, with or without H7 (Fig.1 A). Similar to the results obtained in the earlier study, the level of Bcl-2 protein was found to be up-regulated in RA-treated SH-SY5Y cells (24Lasorella A. Iavarone A. Israel M.A. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4711-4716PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 A). However, H-7 treatment did not affect the Bcl-2 level in either mock- or RA-treated cells (Fig. 1 A). Interestingly, while RA treatment did not seem to affect the level of nuclear p53 in these cells, it suppressed the H-7-mediated nuclear accumulation of p53 that was observed in solvent-treated (Mock) SH-SY5Y cells (Fig. 1 A). The effect of RA in preventing nuclear accumulation of p53 mediated by H-7 in SH-SY5Y cells was further documented by immunofluorescence staining of endogenous p53 protein in these cells subjected to various treatments. Diffuse staining of p53 in the cytosol of SH-SY5Y cells was apparent in untreated cells (Fig. 1 B). Upon stimulation by H-7, nuclear p53 signal was dramatically enhanced in the cells treated with solvent (Mock). However, in RA-treated cells, the strong nuclear staining was no longer observed upon H-7 treatment (Fig.1 B), supporting the conclusion drawn from Western analysis that RA treatment blocked H-7-mediated accumulation of nuclear p53 protein. The ability of RA to block nuclear p53 induction in SH-SY5Y cells was not restricted to the H-7 paradigm, as essentially identical results were obtained with etoposide treatment (Fig. 1 C), which is also an established paradigm for the induction of nuclear p53 (29Fritsche M. Haessler C. Brandner G. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 307-318PubMed Google Scholar). The proteins that we have examined in Western analysis represent only a fraction of all the possible proteins that might have a role in the apoptotic pathway affected by RA. In order to assess whether the up-regulation of Bcl-2 and the suppression of H-7-induced p53 nuclear accumulation by RA had any functional impact on the apoptotic response of SH-SY5Y cells, we compared the apoptotic responses of these cells upon induction by paradigms that are either p53-dependent or p53-independent. H-7, etoposide, and γ-irradiation have been regarded as p53-dependent apoptotic paradigms in many experimental systems (5Lowe S.W. Ruley H.E. Jacks T. Housman D.E. Cell. 1993; 74: 957-967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2963) Google Scholar, 11Moll U.M. LaQuaglia M. Benard J. Riou G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nature. 1993; 362: 847-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (2767) Google Scholar), while staurosporine,N-acetyl-d-erythro-sphingosine, and menadione are believed to act through p53-independent pathways (31Bertrand R. Solary E. O'Connor P. Kohn K.W. Pommier Y. Exp. Cell. Res. 1994; 211: 314-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 32Santana P. Pena L.A. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Martin S. Green D. McLoughlin M.

Zheng Z.B. Kerns J. Naganathan S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28304-28310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Indeed, treatment of SH-SY5Y cells with staurosporine,N-acetyl-d-erythro-sphingosine, or menadione effectively resulted in apoptosis as demonstrated by DNA ladder assay (Fig. 2 A), and yet none of these paradigms induced nuclear accumulation of p53 under identical conditions (Fig. 2 B), confirming that their apoptotic effects are likely to involve p53-independent mechanisms. On the other hand, treatment of SH-SY5Y cells with H-7, etoposide, or γ-irradiation induced apoptosis as well as nuclear accumulation of p53 (Fig. 2, A and B). We next assessed the effect of RA pretreatment on the sensitivity of SH-SY5Y cells to these apoptotic stimuli. The cells were treated with either solvent or 10 μm RA for 4 days before exposure to the different apoptosis-inducing paradigms, and the cell viability was measured by MTT assay (Fig. 3). RA treatment did not alter the apoptotic response of the cells to staurosporine,N-acetyl-d-erythro-sphingosine, and menadione (Fig. 3, D–F). Interestingly, RA-treated cells were considerably more resistant to apoptosis induced by H-7, etoposide, or γ-irradiation (Fig. 3, A–C), as demonstrated by a shift of the dose-response curves to the right. These results support the idea that pretreatment of these cells with RA led to the development of resistance selectively to the p53-dependent apoptotic stimuli. In agreement with a previous study, the protein level of Bcl-2 was found to be up-regulated by 3–4-fold in SH-SY5Y cells upon RA treatment (24Lasorella A. Iavarone A. Israel M.A. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4711-4716PubMed Google Scholar). Since Bcl-2 has been reported to be an effective suppressor of apoptosis triggered by a variety of apoptotic stimuli (34Huang D.C. Cory S. Strasser A. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 405-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 35Cai J. Jones D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11401-11404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar, 36Yoshimura S. Banno Y. Nakashima S. Takenaka K. Sakai H. Nishimura Y. Sakai N. Shimizu S. Eguchi Y. Tsujimoto Y. Nozawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6921-6927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 37Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is therefore possible that the chemoresistance response observed in SH-SY5Y cells was a consequence of the elevated Bcl-2 level. The observation that RA-treated cells develops resistance selectively to only p53-dependent apoptosis argues against the elevated Bcl-2 levels to have a dominant role in conferring the RA-mediated resistance response in these cells. To clarify the issue further, we subjected SH-SY5Y cells to 12-O-tetradecanoyl-13-acetate (TPA) treatment, which is known to up-regulate Bcl-2 in SH-SY5Y cells (27Hanada M. Krajewski S. Tanaka S. Cazals-Hatem D. Spengler B.A. Ross R.A. Biedler J.L. Reed J.C. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4978-4986PubMed Google Scholar). Similar to RA, TPA treatment (16 nm × 5 days) resulted in 3–5-fold induction of the Bcl-2 protein (Fig.4 A). In contrast to RA-treated cells, TPA-treated cells remained sensitive to H-7 and exhibited nuclear accumulation of p53 (Fig. 4 B). Moreover, TPA was unable to confer resistance to the p53-dependent apoptotic response mediated by H-7. Despite a rise in Bcl-2 level, SH-SY5Y cells pre-exposed to TPA remained as sensitive as the solvent-treated cells (Mock) to H-7-mediated apoptosis, as evidenced by the DNA ladder assay (Fig. 4 C). The effect of RA in conferring resistance to p53-dependent apoptosis appeared to be time- and concentration-dependent. The effect was not detectable within the first 24 h of exposure (Fig.5 A). After 48 h of exposure to RA, resistance to p53-dependent apoptosis became apparent and the degree of resistance was enhanced in a time-dependent manner. The chemoresistance effect of RA was found to be dose-dependent as higher concentrations produced more pronounced effects (Fig. 5 A). RA at concentration above 10 μm was toxic to the cells and therefore was not used. In contrast to an earlier study, which showed that SH-SY5Y cells treated with RA at 10–100 nm for 4 days developed chemoresistance to adriamycin and cisplatin (24Lasorella A. Iavarone A. Israel M.A. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4711-4716PubMed Google Scholar), the resistance effect studied here appeared to require a relatively higher concentration of RA (1 μm). This raises the possibility that a metabolite of RA, rather than RA itself, was responsible for this effect. DNA fragmentation, a hallmark of late stage apoptosis, induced by H-7, was dramatically reduced only when the SH-SY5Y cells were pretreated with RA for more than 24 h (Fig. 5 B). These data provide evidence to support the hypothesis that the effect of RA on NB cells was to prevent death resulting from apoptosis. The loss of sensitivity of SH-SY5Y cells to p53-dependent apoptosis upon RA treatment may represent a gradual metabolic process, which may involve re-programming of complex signaling processes in the cells. We further investigated the effect of RA in preventing the induction of functional p53 and subsequent apoptosis mediated by H-7 in two additional NB cell lines. These two cell lines, LA-N-5 and IMR-32, have been previously demonstrated to be sensitive to the effect of H-7 in mediating nuclear accumulation of p53 and apoptosis (13Ronca F. Chan S.L. Yu V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4252-4260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In our experiments, only LA-N-5 cells responded to RA in a similar manner as SH-SY5Y cells. LA-N-5 cells showed a reduction in sensitivity to H-7 in the induction of nuclear p53 as well as apoptosis upon treatment with 10 μm RA for 4 days (Fig.6 A). In contrast, RA pretreatment had no effect on H-7-induced nuclear p53 accumulation and also failed to confer resistance to apoptosis in IMR-32 cells (Fig.6 B). H-7 has been shown to elevate the steady-state level of p53 in NB cells by increasing the half-life of the protein (13Ronca F. Chan S.L. Yu V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4252-4260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The effect may, in part, account for the nuclear accumulation of p53 in the cells upon exposure to this drug. It is conceivable that RA treatment in SH-SY5Y cells may affect the protein stabilizing effect of H-7 on p53 in these cells. We examined the amount of p53 protein in whole cell lysates and nuclear extracts of SH-SY5Y cells by immunoblotting before and after exposure to RA treatment. RA treatment did not significantly affect the low basal level of p53 detected in the whole cell lysate of SH-SY5Y cells (Fig. 7, A, lanes 1and 3, and B). Upon H-7 treatment, however, a marked increase in p53 level was detected in the whole cell extract of both mock and RA-treated cells (Fig. 7,A, lanes 2and 4, and B). Apparently, H-7 was still able to enhance the steady-state level of p53 in RA-treated cells to a similar extent as in the control cells (Fig. 7 B). The effect of H-7 on nuclear accumulation of p53, however, was essentially absent in RA-treated SH-SY5Y cells (Fig. 7, A,lane 8, and B). Indeed, pulse-chase experiments revealed that pre-exposure to 10 μm RA for 4 days had minimal effect on the H-7-induced stabilization of p53 protein in SH-SY5Y cells (Fig. 7 C), suggesting that the effect of RA on blocking the H-7-induced nuclear accumulation of p53 is independent from its effect on the stability of p53 in these cells. Therefore, RA may modulate the p53-dependent response in SH-SY5Y cells by inhibiting the nuclear localization process from taking place despite the high level of p53 in the cytoplasm induced by drug treatments. In this study, we investigated the role of the p53 pathway in the development of chemoresistance response to p53-dependent apoptosis in NB cells as a result of exposure to RA. The SH-SY5Y, LA-N-5, and IMR-32 NB cell lines are known to be sensitive to p53-dependent apoptosis pathway regulated by H-7 (13Ronca F. Chan S.L. Yu V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4252-4260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). RA treatment effectively conferred resistance in SH-SY5Y and LA-N-5 but not IMR-32 cells to H-7-mediated apoptosis. The differential responses among NB cell lines to RA may be due to a variation of genetic backgrounds in NBs. RA-treated SH-SY5Y and LA-N-5 cells failed to accumulate nuclear p53 upon H-7 treatment, consistent with the suggestion that the p53 pathway might be involved in this effect. Interestingly, RA did not significantly affect the H-7-mediated up-regulation of the cytoplasmic pool of the wild-type p53 protein in SH-SY5Y cells, raising the possibility that the drug-induced nuclear accumulation of p53 is a separable process from enhanced protein stability. It is widely believed that restoring and/or enhancing wild-type p53 functions in tumor cells represent a promising treatment strategy for human cancers (38Lowe S.W. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 1995; 7: 547-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Unlike other tumors, NBs have an extremely low rate of mutation in their p53 gene (6Vogan K. Bernstein M. Leclerc J.M. Brisson L. Brossard J. Brodeur G.M. Pelletier J. Gros P. Cancer Res. 1993; 53 (1993): 5269-5273PubMed Google Scholar, 8Imamura J. Bartram C.R. Berthold F. Harms D. Nakamura H. Koeffler H.P. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4053-4058PubMed Google Scholar). Irradiation and DNA damaging agents are known to induce p53 expression in NB cells harboring the wild-type gene (12Moll U.M. Ostermeyer A.G. Haladay R. Winkfield B. Frazier M. Zambetti G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1126-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Recently, we reported that the protein kinase inhibitor, H-7, has the ability to elevate the p53 level in the nucleus of NB cells, thus leading to apoptosis (13Ronca F. Chan S.L. Yu V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4252-4260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). H-7 treatment is known to enhance the level of p53 in SH-SY5Y cells by increasing its stability (13Ronca F. Chan S.L. Yu V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4252-4260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). As a result, a large increase in p53 protein level in both cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments was noted upon stimulation (12Moll U.M. Ostermeyer A.G. Haladay R. Winkfield B. Frazier M. Zambetti G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1126-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar,13Ronca F. Chan S.L. Yu V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4252-4260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear whether the increase in p53 in the nucleus mediated by drug treatments is an active or passive process and whether it is separable from the effect of the increased stability of the protein. Indeed, Moll et al. (12Moll U.M. Ostermeyer A.G. Haladay R. Winkfield B. Frazier M. Zambetti G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1126-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) proposed that the cytoplasmic retention of p53 in NB cells is a saturable process and a sudden increase in p53 level can saturate the storage capacity of the cytoplasmic pool of p53 leading to nuclear accumulation of the protein. In this study, RA treatment did not substantially affect the H-7-induced enhancement of the p53 steady-state level but dramatically inhibited the nuclear accumulation of p53. This observation leads us to propose that the nuclear import of p53 is an independent and active process that can be selectively regulated by RA in a subset of NB cells that expresses wild-type p53 protein. While the loss of p53-dependent response has been associated with chemoresistance in certain tumor cells, the molecular basis of the resistance has primarily been associated with gene mutation and protein stability (5Lowe S.W. Ruley H.E. Jacks T. Housman D.E. Cell. 1993; 74: 957-967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2963) Google Scholar, 39Shaulian E. Resnitzky D. Shifman O. Blandino G. Amsterdam A. Yayon A. Oren M. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2717-2725Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Our current findings represent the first documentation that the process of nuclear import of wild-type p53 protein can be a target for modulating the chemoresistance response in some tumor cells. An earlier study has reported that RA treatment, at 10–100 nm, renders chemoresistance to adriamycin and cisplatin in SH-SY5Y cells (24Lasorella A. Iavarone A. Israel M.A. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4711-4716PubMed Google Scholar). Bcl-2 up-regulation upon RA treatment was proposed as a likely mechanism for the development of the chemoresistance (24Lasorella A. Iavarone A. Israel M.A. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4711-4716PubMed Google Scholar). In agreement with this report, we observed a 3–4-fold up-regulation of total Bcl-2 protein in SH-SY5Y cells upon RA (10 μm) treatment (Fig. 4). However, Bcl-2 has been shown to prevent apoptosis resulting from treatments with various apoptotic stimuli including sphingosine, staurosporine, and chemotherapeutic agents (34Huang D.C. Cory S. Strasser A. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 405-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 35Cai J. Jones D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11401-11404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar, 36Yoshimura S. Banno Y. Nakashima S. Takenaka K. Sakai H. Nishimura Y. Sakai N. Shimizu S. Eguchi Y. Tsujimoto Y. Nozawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6921-6927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 37Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since RA treatment did not confer resistance to apoptotic stimuli rendered by sphingosine or staurosporine in our system, it is therefore questionable whether the mild up-regulation of Bcl-2 protein could have a major role in conferring selective resistance to the p53-dependent apoptosis. TPA is as effective as RA in up-regulating Bcl-2 in SH-SY5Y cells. However, only RA is able to confer resistance to p53-dependent apoptosis in SH-SY5Y cells. These data offer further evidence arguing against the up-regulation of Bcl-2 alone being responsible for the RA-mediated chemoresistance response studied here. However, it remains formally possible that Bcl-2 might have a role in collaborating with p53 or some other molecule in the apoptotic pathway to confer the resistance response seen in these cells. The network of signaling pathways influenced by RA is extremely complex and diverse (40Gudas L.J. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids: Biology, Chemistry, and Medicine. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, New York1994: 443-520Google Scholar). Indeed, some synthetic retinoids, which have selective affinity to a particular RAR or RXR subtype, have been shown to promote different effects in NB cells in vitro (41Ponzoni M. Bocca P. Chiesa V. Decensi A. Pistoia V. Raffaghello L. Rozzo C. Montaldo P.G. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 853-861PubMed Google Scholar, 42Hsu C.A. Rishi A.K. Su-Li X. Gerald T.M. Dawson M.I. Schiffer C. Reichert U. Shroot B. Poirer G.C. Fontana J.A. Blood. 1997; 89: 4470-4479Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that the pleiotropic effect of RA on NB cells is mediated by a complex interplay of multiple retinoid signaling pathways. Additional studies involving receptor subtype-specific retinoid ligands are, therefore, necessary to further our understanding of the contribution of individual retinoid signaling pathways to the processes of differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, and chemoresistance in NB cells.

The data suggest that a precursor of FeV-co that contains vanadium and iron accumulates on VnfX, and thus, VnfX is involved in the synthesis of FeV-co. Interest in vanadium as a biologically relevant element has increased in the last two decades. Although it had been known for some time that vanadium occurs in a highly enriched form in marine organisms and mushrooms (for a review, see Ref. 1Slebodnik C. Hamstra B.J. Pecoraro V.L. Struct. Bonding. 1997; 89: 51-108Crossref Google Scholar), the discovery of its presence and functional role in haloperoxidases (reviewed by Butler (2Butler A. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1998; 2: 279-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar)) and nitrogenases (reviewed by Eady (3Eady R.R. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 3013-3030Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar)) is recent. Nitrogenase, the bacterial enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of N2 into NH4+, contains a unique iron-sulfur-heterometal cofactor, which is the site of substrate reduction. The most widely studied nitrogenases contain molybdenum as the heterometal in their active site cofactor (the iron-molybdenum cofactor (FeMo-co) 1The abbreviations used are: co, cofactor; Mops, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; EPR, electron paramagnetic resonance. ). The discovery of molybdenum-independent nitrogenases by Bishop et al. (4Bishop P.E. Jarlenski D.M.L. Hetherington D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 7342-7346Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 5Bishop P.E. Jarlenski D.M.L. Hetherington D.R. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 150: 1244-1251Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) has led to the isolation and characterization of nitrogenases containing an iron-vanadium cofactor (FeV-co) (see Ref. 3Eady R.R. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 3013-3030Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholarfor a review), as well as nitrogenases in which no metal other than iron has been detected in the active site cofactor (6Schneider K. Gollan U. Dröttboom M. Selsemeier-Voigt S. Müller A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 789-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). These three nitrogenase systems are genetically distinct, the genes encoding them being contained in different regulons (designated nif,vnf, and anf genes for the molybdenum, vanadium, and iron-only nitrogenases, respectively). Azotobacter vinelandii harbors all three nitrogenase systems, and their expression is regulated by the metal content of the culture medium (7Luque F. Pau R.N. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 227: 481-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Each nitrogenase consists of two easily separable protein components: dinitrogenase and dinitrogenase reductase. The reduction of substrate is catalyzed by dinitrogenase, whereas dinitrogenase reductase serves as the obligate electron donor to dintrogenase. The nif, vnf, and anf regulons encode not only the nitrogenases but also products involved in cofactor biosynthesis and insertion in the cofactorless dinitrogenases. Among the genes known to be required for FeMo-co synthesis arenifB, nifE, nifN, nifV, andnifH. The protein encoded by nifB synthesizes NifB-co, a precursor that is the iron and sulfur donor to FeMo-co (8Allen R.M. Chatterjee R. Ludden P.W. Shah V.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26890-26896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar,9Shah V.K. Allen J.R. Spangler N.J. Ludden P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1154-1158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and most probably to FeV-co, because nifB is required for vanadium-dependent diazotrophic growth (10Joerger R.D. Bishop P.E. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1475-1487Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The gene products of nifE and nifN form a tetrameric protein (NifEN), that is able to bind NifB-co (11Roll J.T. Shah V.K. Dean D.R. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4432-4437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Analogs of thenifE and nifN genes exist in the vnfregulon (vnfEN (12Wolfinger E.D. Bishop P.E. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7565-7572Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)), probably serving a similar role during FeV-co synthesis. The gene product of nifV is homocitrate synthase (13Zheng L. White R.H. Dean D.R. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5963-5966Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Homocitrate is a structural component of FeMo-co (14Hoover T.R. Imperial J. Ludden P.W. Shah V.K. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 2768-2771Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and most probably FeV-co, because nifV is also required for full functionality of the vnf-dinitrogenase (15Kennedy C. Dean D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1992; 231: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The product of nifH, dinitrogenase reductase, plays multiple roles in the nitrogenase system. In addition to reducing dinitrogenase during nitrogenase turnover, NifH (VnfH) is required for FeMo-co (and presumably FeV-co) biosynthesis (16Robinson A.C. Dean D.R. Burgess B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14327-14332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Filler W.A. Kemp R.M. Ng J.C. Hawkes T.R. Dixon R.A. Smith B.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 160: 371-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), but its exact role in this process remains to be established. It is important to note that the structural gene products for dinitrogenase (nifDK) are not required for accumulation of FeMo-co and not involved in its synthesis (18Ugalde R.A. Imperial J. Shah V.K. Brill W.J. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 159: 888-893Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Any other gene products involved in FeMo-co/FeV-co biosynthesis remain unknown, and the complete biosynthetic pathway is yet to be understood. An important unanswered question regards the gene product(s) providing the specificity for the incorporation of the heterometal (vanadium, molybdenum, or iron) into the cofactor. We report here that a V-Fe-containing cluster accumulates on the gene product ofvnfX during synthesis of FeV-co. Our data suggest that this cluster is a precursor of FeV-co.

All glassware used to prepare the culture medium and for cell growth was washed with 4 n HCl and rinsed thoroughly with deionized water. The strains were grown in Burk's modified medium lacking molybdenum and containing Na51VO3 (0.1 μm) spiked with radioactive 49VCl6 (0.05 μCi/ml) and 400 μg/ml nitrogen in the form of ammonium acetate at 30 °C with shaking. In order to ensure maximum incorporation of49V into the cells, starter cultures that had been depleted of vanadium (by subculturing three times in molybdenum-free, vanadium-free medium) were used to inoculate the49V-containing medium. Cells were grown overnight, collected by centrifugation, and resuspended in nitrogen-free medium containing Na51VO3 and49VCl6 (same concentrations as above). The cultures were incubated then for 5 h at 30 °C for derepression of the vanadium nitrogenase system. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and frozen at −80 °C. For large scale purification of VnfX, A. vinelandii strain CA11.1 was grown in 20-liter carboys containing 15 liters of medium containing 0.1 μmNaVO3 and 40 μg/ml nitrogen in the form of ammonium acetate. The cultures were incubated at 30 °C and aerated vigorously. Cultures were monitored for the depletion of ammonium, following which, derepression of nitrogenase was allowed for 5 h. Cells were collected using a Pellicon cassette system equipped with a filtration membrane (0.45 μm, Millipore Corporation) and frozen at −80 °C. Cell-free extracts were prepared by osmotic shock, as described earlier (23Shah V.K. Davis L.C. Brill W.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 256: 498-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). All buffers were sparged with purified N2 for 20–30 min, and sodium dithionite was added to a final concentration of 1–1.7 mm. Buffers used during protein purification contained 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The procedure for anoxic native gel electrophoresis and phosphorimaging has been described (8Allen R.M. Chatterjee R. Ludden P.W. Shah V.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26890-26896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Proteins were resolved on 7–20% acrylamide (37.5:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide) and 0–20% sucrose gradient gels. After electrophoresis for 15 h at 100 V, the gels were dried and exposed to a phosphor screen for 1–3 days. Screens were scanned using a Molecular Dynamics model 425e PhosphorImager. EPR was performed at a microwave frequency of 9.23 GHz and a modulation amplitude of 12.5 Gauss using a Varian E-15 EPR spectrometer equipped with a Hewlett-Packard 5255A frequency converter, a Varian E102 microwave bridge, and an Oxford 3120 temperature controller. VnfX was purified from A. vinelandii CA11.1 grown and derepressed in the absence of molybdenum and presence of vanadium. All procedures were performed anaerobically. Cell-free extract from 150 g of cells grown in the presence of NaVO3 and 6 g of cells grown in the presence of 49VCl6 plus NaVO3 were mixed and loaded on a DE-52 column (4 × 24 cm) equilibrated with 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.1 m NaCl. The column was washed with 300 ml of the same buffer, and protein was eluted stepwise with 0.15, 0.25, and 0.35 m NaCl in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 20% glycerol. The presence of VnfX in the fractions was assessed by phosphorimaging of anoxic native gels. The fractions containing VnfX (0.15 m NaCl) were pooled and concentrated to 15 ml by ultrafiltration using a PM10 membrane (Amicon). The concentrated fraction was loaded on a Sephadex G-75 column (2.5 × 95 cm) equilibrated with 25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl. The fractions from Sephadex G-75 containing VnfX were pooled, brought to 1m (NH4)2SO4, and loaded on a phenyl-Sepharose column (1 × 15 cm) equilibrated with Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 1 m ammonium sulfate. The column was washed with 1 column volume of the same buffer, and protein was eluted stepwise with two column volumes each of 0.5, 0.25, and 0.0m ammonium sulfate in 0.025 m Tris, pH 7.4. Fractions containing VnfX (0.5 mNH4SO4) were pooled, concentrated by ultrafiltration using the same membrane as above and used for metal and EPR analyses. One ml of partially purified VnfX was subjected to preparative anoxic native gel electrophoresis, the region of the gel containing the radioactivity was sliced, and the protein was eluted from the acrylamide. SDS gel electrophoresis of this sample showed a 20-kDa protein. The protein was transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Problott, Applied Biosystems), and N-terminal sequencing was done at the Department of Biochemistry, Medical College of Wisconsin (Milwaukee, WI). Pure VnfX was cut out of preparative SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels. The protein was eluted from the acrylamide and injected into a rabbit to produce polyclonal antibodies at the Animal Care Unit of the University of Wisconsin-Madison Medical School. Immunoblot analysis was performed as described by Brandner et al. (24Brandner J.P. McEwan A.G. Kaplan S. T. D. J. Bateriol. 1989; 171: 360-368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). VnfX was partially purified from A. vinelandii CA117.3 (ΔnifDKB) grown and derepressed in the absence of molybdenum and presence of vanadium. Extract of 40 g of cells was chromatographed on a DE-52 column (2.5 × 17 cm) equilibrated with 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 20% glycerol. The column was washed with 80 ml of the same buffer, and protein was eluted stepwise with 0.075, 0.15, and 0.30 m NaCl in 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, containing 20% glycerol. The presence of VnfX in the fractions was assessed using immunoblot analysis of anoxic native gels. The fractions containing VnfX were pooled and concentrated to 15 ml by ultrafiltration using a PM10 membrane (Amicon). The concentrated fraction was loaded on a Sephadex G-75 column (2.5 × 95 cm) equilibrated with 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl. The fractions from Sephadex G-75 containing VnfX were pooled and frozen in liquid N2. NifB-co was obtained fromKlebsiella pneumoniae UN1217 (nifN4536 (25MacNeil T. MacNeil D. Roberts G.P. Supiano M.A. Brill W.J. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 136: 253-266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) as has been described (9Shah V.K. Allen J.R. Spangler N.J. Ludden P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1154-1158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NifB-co and 55Fe-NifB-co were in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 2% SB12 (3-(dodecyldimethylammonio)propane-1-sulfonate, Fluka). Incubations of VnfX with NifB-co were done for 30 min at 30 °C. Approximately 80 ml of49V-VnfX partially purified from A. vinelandiiCA11.1 (48 nmol of vanadium, as estimated by specific activity of49V; 15 mg of total protein) was added dropwise to 900 ml of acetone containing 6.75 ml of 4 n HCl at 4 °C with continuous stirring over a 10-min period. The mixture was stirred for an additional 15 min, and precipitated protein was removed by filtration. The filtrate was evaporated to approximately 8 ml using a rotary evaporator, and the pH was adjusted to 8.0–9.0 before chromatography on an AG-1X8 (formate form, Bio-Rad) column (1 × 41 cm) equilibrated with water. The column was eluted with a gradient of 0–6 n formic acid (400 ml total). In order to determine in which fractions of the AG-1X8 column the homocitrate elutes, a standard of [3H]homocitrate (0.1 mmol, 36,000 dpm) was loaded previously on a comparable column and eluted under the exact same conditions. The fractions containing the 3H label were pooled, evaporated to dryness, redissolved in 5.0 ml of H2O, and brought to pH 8. The presence of homocitrate in this fraction was confirmed by in vitro FeMo-co synthesis assays (26Shah V.K. Imperial J. Ugalde R.A. Ludden P.W. Brill W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1636-1640Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), using extracts of A. vinelandii UW45 (ΔnifKDB) that had been desalted using Sephadex G-25 to remove endogenous homocitrate. The corresponding fractions from the AG-1X8 column on which the acidified acetone extract of VnfX had been loaded were pooled, evaporated to dryness, redissolved in 0.2 ml of double distilled H2O, and brought to pH 8.0. The presence or absence of homocitrate in this fraction was assessed using in vitro FeMo-co synthesis assays. The concentration of homocitrate expected in this fraction if the V-Fe cluster associated to VnfX contained homocitrate was calculated based on the concentration of vanadium in the sample of VnfX used for homocitrate extraction (considering 1 mol of homocitrate/mol of vanadium). The recovery of standard homocitrate that underwent these same manipulations was considered in this calculations (70%). In order to study which proteins play a role in FeV-co biosynthesis, mutant strains of A. vinelandii were grown in a medium depleted of molybdenum and containing 51V spiked with 49V (radioactive). The labeled proteins present in cell extracts were analyzed through phosphorimaging of anoxic native gels (Fig. 1). In an extract of a strain that is a wild-type for the vnf-nitrogenase system (CA12 (ΔnifHDK), the major protein band containing49V was the vnf-dinitrogenase, as expected (Fig.1, lane 1). In extracts of a mutant strain unable to synthesize the structural proteins of either the molybdenum nitrogenase or the vanadium nitrogenase (CA11.1 ΔnifHDKΔvnfDGK1::spc), one prominent radiolabeled protein band was observed (Fig. 1, lane 2, VnfX). 49V did not accumulate on this protein in a strain that lacks NifB-co, the iron and sulfur donor to FeMo-co (and presumably FeV-co) (CA117.3 ΔnifDKΔnifB, Fig.1, lane 3). Furthermore a strain lacking both NifH and VnfH (CA11.8 ΔnifHDKΔvnfH) also failed to accumulate 49V (Fig. 1, lane 4) on this protein. NifH is known to be required for FeMo-co synthesis, and itsvnf-encoded homolog is proposed to play a similar role in FeV-co synthesis. These observations suggest that a49V-labeled precursor of FeV-co is associated with the protein labeled VnfX. The same radiolabeled protein was also present, although at a much lower intensity in the extract of the wild-type strain (Fig. 1, lane 1). A 49V-labeled band was seen in an extract of cells grown in the presence of NH4+ (Fig. 1, lane 5, E). The same band was also seen in all other extracts used. This band did not stain for protein by Coomassie Blue or silver stain. Work is in progress to determine the identity of this band. This band does not correspond to H49VO42− (the vanadium species expected to be in solution at this pH), because this species migrated as a diffuse band at a different position in the gel (Fig. 1, lane 6). The radiolabeled band present in extracts of A. vinelandii CA11.1 (Fig. 1, VnfX) was purified by following the radioactivity associated with it. Purification steps included DEAE-cellulose, Sephadex G-75, and phenyl-Sepharose chromatography, as shown in TableI. Purified VnfX showed a specific activity of 133,948 cpm/mg. A purification fold of 165.5 and a final yield of 26% were obtained. After this purification procedure, the protein was not homogenously pure. In order to obtain pure protein, 1 ml of the fraction obtained after phenyl-Sepharose chromatography was electrophoresed in an anoxic native gel, the region of the gel containing the radioactivity was sliced, and the protein was eluted from the acrylamide. This step is not shown in the purification table, because VnfX lost the 49V label upon exposure to air, when eluting from the gel. The purified protein was identified as VnfX, based on its N-terminal sequence identity to the amino acid sequence predicted from the vnfX gene (12Wolfinger E.D. Bishop P.E. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7565-7572Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (MIKVAFASN). InA. vinelandii, the vnfX gene is located downstream of the vnfEN genes, which are also proposed to be involved in FeV-co synthesis (12Wolfinger E.D. Bishop P.E. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7565-7572Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Table IPurification of VnfX from A. vinelandii CA11.1FractionVolumeTotal activitySpecific activityPurificationYieldmlcpmaThe total cpm in fractions was determined by scintillation counting, and the fraction of cpm associated with VnfX was estimated from phosphorimages of anoxic native gels using ImageQuant (Molecular Dynamics).cpm/mg of protein−fold%CA11.1 extract630.07,657,888809.5DE-52125,862,7067,992.79.976Sephadex G-75504,251,00071,44588.356Phenyl-Sepharose4.51,982,430133,948165.526a The total cpm in fractions was determined by scintillation counting, and the fraction of cpm associated with VnfX was estimated from phosphorimages of anoxic native gels using ImageQuant (Molecular Dynamics). Open table in a new tab The temperature dependence at 10.0 mW of the X-band EPR spectrum of dithionite-treated (as isolated) VnfX is shown in Fig. 2 A. The spectral properties can be readily interpreted as arising from a majority S = 3/2 species that is of maximum observed intensity at 4.8 K (Fig. 2 B) and a minorityS = 1/2 species that increases in intensity with increasing temperature to 50 K. The g values of the majority S = 3/2 species can be analyzed using a spin Hamiltonian,H e, with D and E as the axial and rhombic splitting parameters, and an isotropic g-tensor, g0, as given by Equation 1. He=g0βH·S+D(Sz2−S(S+1)/3+(E/D)(Sx2−Sy2))(Eq. 1) On the basis of their temperature dependence behavior, the features at g = 4.82, g = 3.36, and g ∼1.90 are attributed to resonances from the lower doublet of the S = 3/2 system with a rhombicity parameter (E/D) of 0.15 and D > 0, using g 0 = 2.00. An accurate assessment of the high field g value is hindered by the diffuse nature of the resonance and the presence of the minority species. As Fig. 2 B demonstrates, power-saturation of the majority species (determined by following the intensity of the g = 4.82 resonance) only becomes evident at temperatures below 10.0 K when using a 10.0 mW microwave power. A plot of the normalized intensity of the g = 4.82 resonance divided by the square root of the microwave power versus the log of microwave power at a temperature of 4.8 K, according to Equation 2, is shown in Fig.3 A (27Rupp H. Moore A.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 548: 16-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). SαP0.5/(1+P/P1/2)b/2(Eq. 2) P ½ is the power for half-saturation, andb is the inhomogeneity parameter. Analysis of the data reveals a P ½ of 4.3 mW using b = 1, which provided the best fit. Fig. 3 A shows that at 4.8 K and 1.0 mW, the S = 3/2 species is largely not power-saturated. Because the minority S = 1/2 species was not observed at 4.8 K and 1.0 mW (Fig. 3 B), it can be assumed that the g = 2 region of the spectrum is arising from only the majority species. Magnetic hyperfine structure due to51V (I = 7/2; the majority isotopic species of vanadium present) is apparent in the g = 2 region under these conditions (Fig. 3 B, inset). Because the observation of this hyperfine structure is maximized at the same conditions as is the intensity of the S = 3/2 species, it is probable that the hyperfine structure is due to 51V incorporated into the species that produces the S = 3/2 resonances, rather than due to a protein-bound 51V4+(S = 1/2) species. The ground state spin and spectral line shapes of the majority species resemble those of isolated FeV-co (28Smith B.E. Eady R.R. Lowe D.J. Gormal C. Biochem. J. 1988; 250: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), the reduced vnf-dinitrogenase of A. chroococcum (29Eady R.R. Robson R.L. Richardson T.H. Miller R.W. Hawkins M. Biochem. J. 1987; 244: 197-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), and a synthetic [VFe3S4] cubane cluster (30Carney M.J. Kovacs J.A. Zhang Y.-P. Papaefthymiou G.C. Spartalian K. Frankel R.B. Holm R.H. Inorg. Chem. 1987; 26: 719-724Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The minorityS = 1/2 component (g = 2.05, 1.96, 1.89) was most clearly observable at higher temperatures (Fig. 2 A), and its relative abundance varied from sample to sample. The minority species may represent a damaged version of the majority species. Analogous signals have been seen in the vnf-dinitrogenases of A. chroococcum (31Eady R.R. Adv. Inorg. Chem. 1991; 36: 77-102Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and A. vinelandii (32Tittsworth R.C. Hales B.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 479-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and have been suggested to represent damaged FeV-co in those proteins. Therefore, the spectroscopic properties of the S = 3/2 species are consistent with an [Fe-V-S] cluster with similar properties to both FeV-co (proposed to be [VFe7S9]) and a [VFe3S4] cluster. Metal analysis revealed that there are 8 ± 1 mol of Fe and 0.5 mol of vanadium bound per mol of VnfX. The levels of vanadium and Fe are more consistent with a model in which a [VFe7Sx] cluster is bound to VnfX, as opposed to a [VFe3S4] cluster. However, it does not appear that FeV-co itself accumulates on VnfX, as vanadium- and iron-containing VnfX (as purified) is not able to donate49V label to FeV-co-deficient dinitrogenase (VnfDGK) (see below). The low level of vanadium (0.5 mol/mol of VnfX) may indicate that some vanadium was lost during purification or that a fraction of the cluster on the isolated VnfX had not yet acquired an atom of vanadium. It is possible that the minority species arises from a damaged [Fe-S] cluster in which vanadium has been lost. As discussed below, NifB-co is able to bind to VnfX in the absence of vanadium. Isolated NifB-co contains only Fe and S, and is diamagnetic in the presence of dithionite. Whereas it is possible that VnfX-bound NifB-co is paramagnetic, it would not exhibit the magnetic hyperfine that the S = 3/2 species described above does. Experiments are in progress to determine the spectral properties of VnfX-bound NifB-co.Figure 3Microwave power dependence of the X-band EPR spectrum of VnfX. A, power study of theS = 3/2 signal. The intensity of the g = 4.82 resonance was divided by the square root of the microwave power in mW (P mW), normalized, and plotted versusthe log of P mW. The data was fit using Equation2, affording a P 1/2 = 4.3 mW. Best fits were obtained with b = 1. Microwave power levels used were 0.10, 0.20, 0.50, 1.0, 2.0, 3.5, 5.0, 10, 15, and 20 mW.

VnfX purified from A. vinelandii CA11.1 (ΔnifHDKvnfDGK::spc) was at a final concentration of 23 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) As indicated above, vanadium- and iron-containing VnfX is not able to donate the V-Fe cluster to FeV-co-deficient dinitrogenase (VnfDGK) under the conditions tested to date. Assay mixtures used for this purpose contained 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, extract ofA. vinelandii CA117.3 (ΔnifKDB) grown in the presence of vanadium (as a source of FeV-co-deficientvnf-dinitrogenase, VnfH, and other vnf proteins), an ATP generating system, MgCl2 (1.8 mm), and partially purified VnfX with the 49V-Fe cluster bound (122,000 cpm/assay). Assays were performed in the absence or presence of homocitrate (104 μm). Purified NifH and partially purified NifEN were added to some assays, in case the vnfcounterparts of these proteins were limiting in the extract of A. vinelandii CA117.3. Under none of the conditions used was the49V-Fe cluster donated to apo-dinitrogenase, as estimated by phosphorimaging of anoxic native gels of the assay mixtures, nor could nitrogenase activity be detected. Experiments were conducted to determine whether the V-Fe cluster associated to VnfX contains homocitrate. Partially purified VnfX was extracted with acidified acetone, and the extract was purified by AG-1X8 chromatography. As shown in TableII, no homocitrate could be detected in the extract of VnfX, as assessed by in vitro FeMo-co synthesis assays. Table II also shows the activities obtained in vitro FeMo-co synthesis assays when adding amounts of homocitrate equivalent to the amounts expected to be in the VnfX extract if this organic acid was a part of the cluster associated to VnfX. Homocitrate is probably added to FeV-co at a later step than the one occurring on VnfX.Table IIDetection of homocitrate by in vitro FeMo-co synthesis assayR-HC standardExpected HC from VnfXActivitynmol/assaynmol of ethylene/min/assay00.90.56.31.09.32.013.54.011.712.515.05018.90.51.91.01.82.01.94.02.112.53.2 Open table in a new tab Surprisingly, A. vinelandii CA48 (vnfE705::kan), a strain that does not express VnfX (as shown by immunoblot analysis, apparently due to polarity of the mutation in vnfE on vnfX) is able to grow diazotrophically in the presence of vanadium, although after a prolonged lag period (12Wolfinger E.D. Bishop P.E. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7565-7572Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This strain does producevnf-encoded dinitrogenase, as shown in Fig. 1, lane 8. As expected, no label was seen in this extract at the position of VnfX. It is possible that NifX or some other protein replaces VnfX in the synthesis of FeV-co. Wolfinger and Bishop (12Wolfinger E.D. Bishop P.E. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7565-7572Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have suggested that NifEN replaces VnfEN in this strain during vanadium-dependent diazotrophic growth. Immunoblot analysis shows that both NifX and NifEN are expressed in vanadium-grown CA48 (data not shown). Nevertheless, no 49V was associated to NifX in extract of this strain (Fig. 1, lane 8). Association of 49V to NifX may be weaker than to VnfX and not withstand the electrophoresis conditions. No 49V-labeled proteins were seen in extracts of strain DJ42.48 (ΔnifENvnfE705::kan) (Fig. 1, lane 7). The mutations in this strain are polar on nifX andvnfX. Polyclonal antibodies to VnfX were generated using pure VnfX, which was extracted from an SDS gel. Immunoblot analysis of anoxic native gels of the partially purified VnfX (from A. vinelandii CA11.1) showed a major band cross-reacting with the antibody, which comigrated with the49V-labeled VnfX (Fig. 4,lanes 2 and 5). A minor band of slower electrophoretic mobility also cross-reacted with the VnfX antibody (labeled V-deficient VnfX in Fig. 4, lane 5). After treatment of VnfX with air, the band corresponding to49V-VnfX could no longer be seen, but the band migrating in the higher position remained (Fig. 4, lane 6). Treatment of VnfX with air resulted in loss of vanadium and iron (data not shown). The slower migrating band in lane 5 probably arose from dissociation of the V-Fe cluster from VnfX during purification (see below). In extracts of a mutant strain incapable of NifB-co production (A. vinelandii CA117.3 (ΔnifDKΔnifB)), there was no vanadium or iron associated with VnfX (as estimated by phosphorimaging (Fig. 1,lane 3) and iron staining of anoxic native gels, not shown). The vanadium-deficient species cross-reacting with the anti-VnfX antibody in extracts of this strain had a slower mobility in anoxic native gel electrophoresis (Fig. 4, lane 7) than the species that has the V-Fe cluster bound. Vanadium-deficient VnfX was partially purified from an extract of A. vinelandii CA117.3. When subjected to gel filtration electrophoresis using Sephadex G-75, this form of VnfX eluted at a volume that corresponds to an apparent molecular mass of 33 kDa, compared with an elution volume corresponding to an apparent molecular mass of 20 kDa for the species that has the V-Fe cluster bound (the molecular mass predicted from the DNA sequence of vnfX is 19 kDa (12Wolfinger E.D. Bishop P.E. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7565-7572Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). The subunit molecular mass of both vanadium-deficient VnfX and V-Fe-containing VnfX was determined to be 20 kDa by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. We hypothesize that a dimeric form of VnfX monomerizes upon binding a V-Fe precursor of FeV-co. This would be analogous to the monomerization of the FeMo-co-binding protein, γ, which is involved in insertion of FeMo-co into the cofactorless nif-apodinitrogenase (33Homer M.J. Dean D.R. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24745-24752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Other interpretations are also consistent with our observations, such as a dramatic conformational change in a monomeric VnfX upon metal cluster binding. Treatment of vanadium-deficient VnfX with purified NifB-co caused a shift in the migration of VnfX in anoxic native gels (Fig. 4, lane 8). The VnfX-NifB-co complex migrated at the same position as does VnfX that has the V-Fe cluster bound to it (e.g. the VnfX purified from A. vinelandii strain CA11.1) (Fig. 4, lane 2). Oxygen-inactivated NifB-co did not produce the shift of VnfX (Fig. 4,lane 9), nor did a solution of SB12 (Fig. 4, lane 10), a detergent that was present at that concentration in the NifB-co solution. The binding of NifB-co to VnfX was confirmed by incubating the partially purified protein with55Fe-NifB-co. When this incubation mixture was subjected to anoxic native gel electrophoresis and the gel was analyzed by phosphorimaging, the 55Fe label was found associated with VnfX (Fig. 4, lane 3). Immunoblot analysis was also used to confirm that VnfX was not expressed in A. vinelandii grown in the presence of molybdenum (Fig. 4, lane 11) or in the presence of ammonium acetate (Fig. 4, lane 12), which represses synthesis of all three nitrogenase systems. Furthermore, anti-VnfX antibody did not cross-react with NifX (data not shown). No association that is stable to anoxic native gel electrophoresis was observed between VnfX and dinitrogenase (VnfDGK) or VnfH (data not shown). A homolog of vnfX exists in the nif regulon (nifX). The product of nifX is required forin vitro FeMo-co synthesis with purified components (34Shah V.K. Rangaraj P. Chatterjee R. Allen J.R. Roll J.T. Roberts G.P. Ludden P.W. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2797-2801Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, nifX is not absolutely required in vivo for FeMo-co synthesis, because strains of A. vinelandii and K. pneumoniae with mutations innifX are Nif+ (35Gosink M.M. Franklin N.M. Roberts G.P. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1441-1447Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Jacobson M.R. Brigle K.E. Bennett L.T. Setterquist R.A. Wilson M.S. Cash V.L. Beynon J. Newton W.E. Dean D.R. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 1017-1027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The same seems to be true for VnfX. A. vinelandii CA48 (vnfE705::kan) is able to grow diazotrophically in the presence of vanadium, although after a prolonged lag period. It is possible that some other gene product replaces VnfX (or NifX) in vivo, although with lower efficiency. As stated before, in extracts of strains with mutations innifB or a double mutation in vnfH andnifH, no V-Fe cluster accumulates on VnfX. Thus, the involvement of NifB and VnfH in FeV-co biosynthesis must occur earlier in the biosynthetic pathway than the step occurring on VnfX. We speculate that the gene products believed to play a role in FeV-co synthesis would do so in the following order (Scheme I). NifB→NifB­co→VnfNE(NifB­co)→→VnfH+V→→VnfX­V­Fe→→HC↘FeV­coSCHEME 1 We have identified and characterized what appears to be a precursor of FeV-co that contains the heterometal (vanadium). This intermediate is associated with VnfX, which suggests that this protein is involved in FeV-co synthesis. The step occurring on VnfX could be the addition of vanadium to the partially formed cluster, because both a vanadium-containing cluster and NifB-co, its Fe-S precursor, can accumulate on VnfX. Alternatively, a cluster already containing vanadium could be transferred to VnfX, and a further processing step could occur on this protein."

We recently cloned a novel, intracellular protein, FIBP, which binds the wild-type aFGF, but not aFGF(K132E) (23Kolpakova E. Wiedlocha A. Stenmark H. Klingenberg O. Falnes P.Ø. Olsnes S. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The K132E mutation destroys a consensus phosphorylation site for protein kinase C (PKC) in aFGF, Ser130-Cys-Lys. aFGF was previously shown to be phosphorylated by PKC on serine in vitro, but not by protein kinase A or casein kinase I and only negligibly by casein kinase II (24Feige J.J. Baird A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3174-3178Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We found that wild-type aFGF was phosphorylated in vitro in a cell lysate while aFGF(K132E) was not. In vitro phosphorylation in cell lysate was augmented in the presence of diacylglycerol and phosphatidylserine and inhibited by staurosporine (15Klingenberg O. Wiedlocha A. Rapak A. Munoz R. Falnes P.Ø. Olsnes S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11164-11172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Furthermore, externally added wild-type aFGF, but not aFGF(K132E), was phosphorylated in intact cells (15Klingenberg O. Wiedlocha A. Rapak A. Munoz R. Falnes P.Ø. Olsnes S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11164-11172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation in vivo depended on translocation of aFGF to the cytosol or nucleus, because phosphorylation was not observed when aFGF was incubated with cells transfected with FGFR4 constructs incapable of mediating translocation to these locations. 3O. Klingenberg, A. Wi Ĳ dłocha, A. Rapak, D. Khnykin, L. Citores, and S. Olsnes, submitted for publication. 3O. Klingenberg, A. Wi Ĳ dłocha, A. Rapak, D. Khnykin, L. Citores, and S. Olsnes, submitted for publication. Taken together, these data indicate that after translocation to the cytosol or nucleus aFGF becomes phosphorylated on serine 130 by PKC. In attempts to elucidate the role of the phosphorylation site in the exposed loop, we made several mutations in this region and measured the ability of the mutated growth factors to bind to heparin and FGFR and to stimulate MAP kinase, DNA synthesis, and cell proliferation. Constructs for in vitro transcription and translation encoding aFGF with different mutations (Fig. 1 A) were generated by polymerase chain reaction-directed mutagenesis with the plasmid paFGF(K132E) (15Klingenberg O.

Polymerase chain reaction products were cut with StuI and EcoRI and ligated into paFGF(K132E) between the same sites. Each construct contained a new restriction site for colony screening, and the sequence of each construct was verified by DNA sequencing. Constructs encoding maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion proteins were generated by inserting the SphI-EcoRI fragment from each of these plasmids between the same sites in pMal-cN-aFGFCAAX, which had been previously constructed by inserting theNcoI-EcoRI fragment of pHBGF-cax (13Wiedlocha A.

In some of the constructs a stop-codon had not been generated by polymerase chain reaction and was instead made by cutting the plasmids with EcoRI, filling in with T4 DNA polymerase and religating the plasmids. This procedure introduced an in-frame stop-codon and an AseI restriction site. MBP fusion proteins were affinity-purified on an amylose resin column as described by the manufacturer (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Cells were propagated in Dulbecco′s modified essential medium with 7.5% (v/v) fetal calf serum in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. SDS-PAGE was carried out with 7.5 or 10% gels as described by Laemmli (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205487) Google Scholar) and processed as described (8Wiedlocha A.

MBP fusion proteins, cleaved with factor Xa to separate MBP from mutant or wild-type aFGF, at 0.3 mg/ml (final concentration) or pure aFGF or aFGF(K132E) at 0.1 mg/ml (final concentration) were incubated with purified PKC (0.6 unit/ml) (Sigma) in kinase buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 10 mmMgCl2, 2 mm MnCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.1 mmATP, 40 μCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP) at 37 °C for 1 h. The reaction mixtures were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography (15Klingenberg O. Wiedlocha A. Rapak A. Munoz R. Falnes P.Ø. Olsnes S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11164-11172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Plasmids were linearized with EcoRI and transcribed in vitrowith T3 RNA polymerase. Ethanol-precipitated transcripts were translated for 1 h 30 min at 30 °C in a nuclease-treated rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega, Madison, WI) in the presence of 1 μm [35S]methionine or unlabeled methionine. To be able to compare concentrations of translated growth factor in different unlabeled translation mixtures, labeled translations were always run in parallel. After translation the lysates were dialyzed against dialysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 140 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2) (27Stenmark H. Afanasiev B.N. Ariansen S. Olsnes S. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 619-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). DNA synthesis was measured by incorporation of [3H]thymidine in serum-starved NIH 3T3 cells stimulated with in vitrotranslated, unlabeled growth factors for 24 h. Cell proliferation was measured in serum-starved NIH 3T3 cells after stimulation for 48 h with in vitro translated growth factors by counting the cells in a cell counter. In vitro translated, [35S]methionine-labeled growth factors diluted in PBS:water = 1:1 were incubated under rotation with 100 μl of heparin-Sepharose at 4 °C for 2 h. The beads were washed, and bound proteins were eluted with stepwise increasing concentrations of NaCl (1 ml of each concentration), and radioactivity in each fraction (1 ml) was measured. Calf pulmonary artery endothelial cells were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C in HEPES medium supplemented with 10 units/ml heparin and 5 ng/ml [35S]methionine-labeled wild-type or mutant aFGF in the absence or presence of excess unlabeled wild-type aFGF. The cells were washed three times, lysed, and the postnuclear supernatant was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. In other experiments,125I-labeled wild-type aFGF (5 ng/ml) was incubated with NIH 3T3 cells for 3 h at 4 °C in HEPES medium containing 10 units/ml heparin in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of MBP fusion proteins with aFGF mutants or wild-type. In some cases, the fusion proteins had been cleaved with factor Xa. The cells were washed three times, lysed in 0.1 m KOH, and the radioactivity was measured. After lysis in lysis buffer (0.1 m NaCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 4 μg/ml aprotinin) cells were centrifuged for 15 min at 720 × g. The supernatant was centrifuged again for 5 min at 15,800 × g and designated the cytosol/membrane fraction. The pellet was washed once by resuspension in lysis buffer and once by resuspension in lysis buffer containing 0.3 msucrose that was layered on lysis buffer containing 0.8 msucrose and centrifuged at 720 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, then sonicated in lysis buffer containing additional 0.5m NaCl and centrifuged for 5 min at 15,800 ×g. The supernatant of this centrifugation was designated the nuclear fraction. Serum-starved NIH 3T3 cells were incubated in Dulbecco′s modified essential medium containing 1 mm unlabeled methionine, 10 units/ml heparin, and 2 μl/ml [35S]methionine-labeled mutant or wild-type growth factors for different periods of time. In some experiments 50 μm LY294002 was also present. Cells were washed and treated with 5 mg/ml Pronase at 37 °C for 5 min, transferred to an Eppendorf tube, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 4 μg/ml aprotinin were added. Cells were washed once by resuspension in HEPES medium with the same protease inhibitors, lysed, and fractionated. Trichloroacetic acid precipitable material was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. Serum-starved NIH 3T3 cells were incubated at 37 °C for different periods of time in HEPES medium with different concentrations of in vitro translated wild-type or mutant aFGF or with a translation mixture without added mRNA in the presence of heparin (5 units/ml). The cells were washed twice with HEPES medium on ice and lysed in P-lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 μm sodium orthovanadate, 1% Triton X-100) with protease inhibitors. The postnuclear supernatant was subjected to immunoprecipitation with an anti-MAP kinase (ERK1 and ERK2) antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), and the immunoprecipitates were subsequently incubated for 15 min at 37 °C in 25 μl of kinase buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol) with 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 20 μg of myelin basic protein. SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added, and the samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography (28Migliaccio A. Di Domenico M. Castoria G. de Falco A. Bontempo P. Nola E. Auricchio F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1292-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). Since aFGF(K132E) exhibits strongly reduced ability to stimulate DNA synthesis in cells (15Klingenberg O. Wiedlocha A.

Dev. 1994; 39: 56-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and is incapable of being phosphorylated in vitro and in vivo (15Klingenberg O. Wiedlocha A. Rapak A. Munoz R. Falnes P.Ø. Olsnes S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11164-11172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), we carried out a number of additional mutations in this region of the molecule (Fig. 1 A). Serine 130 in the consensus sequence for phosphorylation by PKC was mutated to glutamic acid (S130E) or to alanine (S130A) to mimic phosphorylated and unphosphorylated growth factor, respectively. Similar mutations have been made previously in other proteins to study the role of phosphorylation (29Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2476) Google Scholar, 30Tagawa T. Kuroki T. Vogt P.K. Chida K. J.

Surana U. Robitsch H. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1991; 66: 743-758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). To study if lysine 132 as such is required, we mutated it to alanine (K132A). Since this mutation destroys the PKC phosphorylation site, we also made the double mutant S130E/K132A as a “phosphorylated” control. We further made the conservative mutation of lysine 132 into arginine (K132R). Burgess et al. (22Burgess W.H. Friesel R. Winkles J.A. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1994; 39: 56-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) made the double mutant cysteine 131 into serine and lysine 132 into glutamic acid (C131S/K132E) and reported that it was mitogenic to the same extent as the bovine wild-type aFGF. In this double mutant a new, potential PKC phosphorylation site is created (Ser131-Glu-Arg), and therefore we also made this double mutant to investigate if it would become phosphorylated. Some of the mutants were expressed as fusion proteins with maltose-binding protein in bacteria and affinity-purified. These fusion proteins were then cleaved with the protease, factor Xa, to separate the MBP part from the growth factor part, and analyzed by anin vitro kinase assay with purified PKC. As shown in Fig.1 B, lower panel, lane 4, the wild-type growth factor was strongly phosphorylated. The mutants where serine 130 had been mutated to alanine (lane 1) or glutamic acid (lane 2) were not or negligibly phosphorylated, consistent with the notion that serine 130 is the major phosphorylation site in aFGF. The mutant C131S/K132E, where we had introduced a possible PKC site one amino acid away from the normal site, was also not phosphorylated (lane 3). In lanes 5 and6 we used growth factor expressed as such in bacteria and purified as described previously (14Wiedlocha A. Falnes P.Ø. Rapak A. Munoz R. Klingenberg O. Olsnes S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 270-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 15Klingenberg O. Wiedlocha A. Rapak A. Munoz R. Falnes P.Ø. Olsnes S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11164-11172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) as controls. The pure, wild-type growth factor was phosphorylated to a similar extent as wild-type growth factor expressed as MBP fusion protein (comparelanes 4 and 6). With pure aFGF(K132E) a weak phosphorylated band was detectable (lane 5) similarly as with the other mutants. Since aFGF(K132E) is not phosphorylatedin vitro in a cell lysate or in vivo in intact cells (15Klingenberg O. Wiedlocha A. Rapak A. Munoz R. Falnes P.Ø. Olsnes S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11164-11172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), the weak phosphorylation observed in lanes 1–3and 5 probably represents background phosphorylation in thein vitro assay with pure PKC. In aFGF(K132R) the PKC consensus site is intact, since both lysine and arginine are tolerated at this position, and we found that aFGF(K132R) was indeed substrate for PKC (not demonstrated). aFGF(K132E) exhibits strongly reduced heparin affinity (20Burgess W.H. Shaheen A.M. Ravera M. Jaye M. Donohue P.J. Winkles J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2129-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) as compared with wild-type aFGF. To measure heparin affinity of the different aFGF mutants, we bound in vitro translated, [35S]methionine-labeled growth factors to heparin-Sepharose columns, washed, and eluted with stepwise increasing concentrations of NaCl. The results, shown in Fig. 1 C, demonstrate that the different mutants varied considerably in their affinity for heparin. The S130E mutant exhibited virtually identical heparin affinity as the wild-type, while the S130A mutant was eluted in a broad peak. This result was reproducible in four different experiments, but the reason for the unusual broadness of the peak is unclear. The mutants where lysine 132 had been changed all exhibited reduced heparin affinity. The most conservative mutation, K132R, reduced the affinity least, while the K132A mutation reduced heparin affinity considerably. We found that aFGF(K132E) eluted at 0.3m NaCl (not demonstrated). It appears that the heparin affinity of aFGF is very sensitive to mutations of lysine 132 and that more drastic mutations have a more pronounced effect than conservative ones. To test the ability of the different mutants to bind to cells, in vitrotranslated, [35S]methionine-labeled growth factors were incubated with calf pulmonary artery endothelial cells at 4 °C in the presence of heparin and in the absence or presence of excess unlabeled wild-type aFGF. All mutants were bound to a similar extent and the binding could be completely competed out with excess aFGF in all cases (Fig. 2 A). To measure relative binding affinities to cells of the wild-type and mutant growth factors, we incubated NIH 3T3 cells at 4 °C with125I-labeled, pure wild-type aFGF in the presence of heparin and different concentrations of unlabeled wild-type or mutant aFGF as MBP fusion proteins. After washing, the cell-associated radioactivity was measured. Most of the tested mutants were able to compete with 125I-labeled wild-type aFGF for binding to cells with a similar potency as the wild-type itself (Fig.2 B). However, it appears that the S130E mutant was somewhat more potent than the wild-type in this respect. Similar data were obtained when the MBP fusion proteins had been cleaved off with factor Xa prior to the experiment (not demonstrated). To study the mitogenic activity of the different mutants, we added increasing amounts of unlabeled, in vitro translated growth factors to serum-starved NIH 3T3 cells and measured the ability of the cells to incorporate [3H]thymidine during 24 h of stimulation (Fig.3 A). The concentration of unlabeled growth factor was for each mutant estimated from parallel translation reactions containing [35S]methionine, which were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and densitometric scanning. The data in Fig.3 A are corrected for differences in translation efficiency. The different mutants varied strongly in their ability to stimulate DNA synthesis. Wild-type aFGF and the S130E and S130A mutants were equally potent in this matter. The K132A and the S130E/K132A mutants were both approximately 10-fold less potent, while the K132R mutant was 3-fold less potent than wild-type to stimulate DNA-synthesis. For comparison, we also tested the K132E mutant, which was at least 100-fold less active than wild-type aFGF. aFGF(K132E) could not elicit a full mitogenic response within the limits of this assay using in vitro translated growth factors. As control, addition of translation mixture to which no mRNA had been added did not stimulate [3H]thymidine incorporation at all (not demonstrated). To study the ability of the different mutants to support proliferation, we incubated serum-starved NIH 3T3 cells for 48 h with different concentrations of wild-type and mutant growth factors that were madein vitro and then counted the cells in a cell counter (Fig.3 B). In this assay, one μl/ml of translation mixture gave optimal stimulation of proliferation for all constructs tested, and increasing the concentration to 3 μl/ml did not increase the effect reproducibly. Therefore, only results with the concentration of 1 μl/ml is shown in Fig. 3 C. Wild-type aFGF and the S130E mutant stimulated proliferation most effectively, while the S130A and the K132R mutants were somewhat less effective. The K132A and the S130E/K132A mutants gave the weakest stimulation of proliferation. Together, these data indicate that phosphorylation of aFGF is not required for stimulation of DNA synthesis. It appears that lysine 132 is important for the mitogenic effect of aFGF, independent of phosphorylation of serine 130. Upon binding of aFGF to the FGFR, the tyrosine kinase of the receptor is activated and several signal transduction cascades are initiated (33Mohammadi M. Honegger A.M. Rotin D. Fischer R. Bellot F.

Biol. 1996; 16: 5964-5973Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Therefore, we measured the ability of the different mutants to stimulate MAP kinase. Serum-starved NIH 3T3 cells were stimulated with different concentrations of in vitrotranslated wild-type or mutant growth factor for 5, 30, or 60 min, lysed, and MAP kinase (ERK1 and ERK2) was immunoprecipitated. MAP kinase activity in the immunoprecipitates was measured in an in vitro kinase assay with myelin basic protein as substrate. There was virtually no MAP kinase activity immunoprecipitated from cells treated with a translation mixture to which no mRNA had been added (Fig. 4, lane 1). Ten percent fetal calf serum (lane 2) and the higher concentration used of wild-type aFGF (lane 4) stimulated MAP kinase activity to a similar extent. The aFGF induced MAP kinase activation was completely prevented when the cells were treated with genistein, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (lanes 15 and16, upper panel). Importantly, no detectable differences in MAP kinase activity could be measured when the cells were stimulated with the different mutant or wild-type growth factors (lanes 3–14). The apparent differences after 5-min stimulation in the experiment shown were not reproducible between experiments. Also the kinetics of MAP kinase activation was similar for the different aFGF constructs (compare lanes 3–14 inupper, middle, and lower panels). Together, all the aFGF constructs tested stimulated MAP kinase activation to a similar extent. We and others have previously provided evidence suggesting a role of aFGF in the nucleus for stimulation of DNA synthesis (8Wiedlocha A. Falnes P.Ø. Madshus I.H. Sandvig K. Olsnes S.

[35S]Methionine-labeled, in vitro translated wild-type and mutant growth factors were added to cells together with heparin and incubated at 37 °C for different periods of time. The cells were washed, treated with Pronase to digest growth factor at the cell surface or bound to the plastic, then the cells were lysed and fractionated into cytosol/membrane and nuclear fractions as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In Fig.5 only the nuclear fractions are shown. After 9-h incubation of the cells with growth factor, all mutants as well as the wild-type aFGF were found in the nuclear fraction (Fig.5 A). Transport to the nuclear fraction could be completely inhibited by the phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 (Fig.5 B), which we have found recently, is able to inhibit transport of externally added aFGF to the cytosol and nucleus of cells. 4O. Klingenberg, A. Wi Ĳ dłocha, and S. Olsnes, submitted for publication. It was reported recently that in retinal cells, phosphorylated aFGF was more stable intracellularly than unphosphorylated aFGF (39Guillonneau X. Regnier-Ricard F. Dupuis C. Courtois Y. Mascarelli F. Growth Factors. 1998; 15: 95-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We also tested the different mutants for presence in the nucleus after longer incubation times, but no reproducible differences could be detected. However, in the cytosol/membrane fraction a rather stable degradation product of approximately 14 kDa was reproducibly obtained from cells incubated with wild-type aFGF and with the S130E mutant, but not from cells incubated with the other mutants (not demonstrated). The degradation product was probably enclosed within a vesicular compartment, since it was also obtained in the presence of LY294002. The degradation product was never obtained from the nuclear fraction. Based on the ability to bind to wild-type aFGF, but not to the K132E mutant, we recently cloned a novel intracellular protein, which we designated FIBP (aFGF Intracellularbinding protein) (23Kolpakova E. Wiedlocha A. Stenmark H. Klingenberg O. Falnes P.Ø. Olsnes S. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We tested the ability of several of the aFGF mutants as MBP fusion proteins to bind to FIBPin vitro (23Kolpakova E. Wiedlocha A. Stenmark H. Klingenberg O. Falnes P.Ø. Olsnes S. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In contrast to the K132E mutant, all of the other mutants that we tested in this way (S130E, K132A, S130E/K132A) bound to FIBP, although somewhat less effectively than did the wild-type (not demonstrated). In this paper we report the generation and characterization of several mutations in an exposed loop of aFGF, known to be of importance for heparin affinity and mitogenic activity of the growth factor. The mutants varied 10-fold in mitogenic activity, but were equally potent in stimulating MAP kinase. A correlation, however, could be observed between mitogenic activity and affinity to heparin. High affinity receptor binding varied little among the constructs, with the exception of the S130E mutant, which apparently bound with higher affinity. Interestingly, bFGF phosphorylated by protein kinase A on threonine 112 (corresponding to Thr120 according to the numbering used in Ref. 1Burgess W.H. Maciag T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 575-606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was found to be three to eight times more potent at displacing 125I-labeled FGF from the high affinity receptors (24Feige J.J. Baird A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3174-3178Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This threonine is located in a part of bFGF reported to be involved in both heparin binding and high affinity receptor binding (40Baird A. Schubert D. Ling N. Guillemin R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2324-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Possibly, phosphorylation of aFGF may modulate its binding to FGFR. The Ras/Raf/Mek/MAP kinase cascade is considered to be important for mitogenic activity of several growth factors, FGF included (41Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4208) Google Scholar). Microinjection of an antibody against FRS2, a tyrosine-phosphorylated protein that links FGFR activation to activation of the Ras/Raf/Mek/MAP kinase cascade, inhibited stimulation of DNA synthesis by aFGF (34Kouhara H. Hadari Y.R. Spivak-Kroizman T. Schilling J. Bar-Sagi D. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1997; 89: 693-702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). A cell-permeable peptide derived from the Grb2-binding sequence of epidermal growth factor receptor was shown to inhibit MAP kinase activation in cells stimulated with epidermal growth factor or with platelet-derived growth factor, but not in cells stimulated with bFGF. The peptide also inhibited the mitogenic response of the cells to epidermal growth factor and to platelet derived growth factor, but not to bFGF (42Williams E.J. Dunican D.J. Green P.J. Howell F.V. Derossi D. Walsh F.S. Doherty P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22349-22354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, even though the different aFGF mutants described in the present paper differed 10-fold in mitogenic activity, they were equally potent in stimulation of MAP kinase. We have also found that the K132E mutant, which exhibits at least a 100-fold lower mitogenic activity than wild-type aFGF, shows a similar potency as the wild-type to induce MAP kinase activity.2 It therefore appears that activation of the Ras/Raf/Mek/MAP kinase cascade is not sufficient for stimulation of DNA synthesis by aFGF. We previously provided data suggesting that the strongly reduced mitogenic activity of the K132E mutant is due to a defect in its intracellular action (15Klingenberg O. Wiedlocha A. Rapak A. Munoz R. Falnes P.Ø. Olsnes S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11164-11172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We also found that the K132E mutation rendered the growth factor incapable of being phosphorylated in vivo (15Klingenberg O. Wiedlocha A. Rapak A. Munoz R. Falnes P.Ø. Olsnes S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11164-11172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). One of the aims of the present study was to investigate whether there could be a cause-effect relationship between these observations. To use phosphorylated wild-type growth factor in experiments that last for 24 h or more, may not be optimal (24Feige J.J. Baird A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3174-3178Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Therefore, we took the strategy of mutating the serine in the phosphorylation site to the negatively charged glutamic acid or to the uncharged alanine to mimic phosphorylated and unphosphorylated growth factor, respectively. Similar strategies have previously been used successfully with other proteins (29Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2476) Google Scholar, 30Tagawa T. Kuroki T. Vogt P.K. Chida K. J.

Surana U. Robitsch H. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1991; 66: 743-758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). However, we have no positive control to tell us whether the S130E mutant really mimics phosphorylated aFGF. Anyhow, we can conclude that inability of being phosphorylated can not be the only reason for the mitogenic defect of the K132E mutant. Rather, it appears that lysine 132 as such is important, independent of phosphorylation. Interaction of aFGF (5Spivak-Kroizman T. Lemmon M.A. Dikic I. Ladbury J.E. Pinchasi D. Huang J. Jaye M. Crumley G. Schlessinger J. Lax I. Cell. 1994; 79: 1015-1024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar) and bFGF (43Yayon A. Klagsbrun M. Esko J.D. Leder P. Ornitz D.M. Cell. 1991; 64: 841-848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2070) Google Scholar) with heparin or heparan sulfate proteoglycans has been proposed to play a pivotal role in stimulation of FGFR. In this study, we have found a correlation between mitogenic potency and heparin affinity of the different mutants. The leading hypothesis on how heparin or heparan sulfate proteoglycans exert their effect is that these molecules bind several FGF molecules at the same time as each FGF molecule binds to an FGFR molecule, thereby dimerizing or oligomerizing FGFR molecules (5Spivak-Kroizman T.

If the reason for the reduced mitogenic activity of the mutants found in this and previous studies (15Klingenberg O. Wiedlocha A. Rapak A. Munoz R. Falnes P.Ø. Olsnes S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11164-11172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 20Burgess W.H. Shaheen A.M. Ravera M. Jaye M. Donohue P.J. Winkles J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2129-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) were reduced heparin affinity, a proportional reduction in activation of FGFR and its downstream effectors should be expected from this hypothesis. This is not the case. One possible explanation could be that interaction with intracellular targets of aFGF also depends on the ability of aFGF to interact with negatively charged (parts of) molecules. In this context, it is interesting that glypican, a heparan sulfate proteoglycan, and biglycan, a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan, have been found to contain functional nuclear localization sequences and to exist in the nucleus (46Liang Y. Haring M. Roughley P.J. Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 851-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In conclusion, phosphorylation of aFGF is not required for its mitogenic activity. Lysine 132 of aFGF is important both for mitogenic effect and for heparin affinity. We cannot detect a correlation between mitogenic activity and ability to activate MAP kinase.

Raw cells treated with LPS before or after virus infection showed down-regulation in the expression of interferon A and, to a lesser extent, interferon B genes. In contrast, induction of the interleukin (IL)-6 gene was enhanced. The effects of LPS were not a result of the suppression of virus replication, because the transcription of viral nucleocapsid gene was not affected. Consistent with these findings, LPS also suppressed the NDV-mediated induction of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene driven by murine interferon A4 promoter in a transient transfection assay. Furthermore, LPS inhibited virus-mediated phosphorylation of interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-3 and the consequent translocation of IRF-3 from cytoplasm to nucleus. The LPS-mediated inhibition of IFNA gene expression was much weaker in infected Raw cells that constitutively overexpressed IRF-3. The nuclear translocation of IRF-7 in infected cells was also inhibited by LPS. These data suggest that LPS down-regulates the virus-mediated induction of IFNA genes by post-translationally targeting the IRF-3 and IRF-7 proteins.

Cells can produce IFNs in response to virus infection, and the newly synthesized IFNs are secreted extracelluarly, bind to IFN receptors, and activate the Jak-Stat signaling pathway that leads to the stimulation of expression of cellular genes generally called ISGs (1Müller M.

Some of these genes encode proteins that can inhibit viral replication, thus conferring the antiviral state to the cells (3Veals S.A. Kessler D.S. Josiah S. Leonard D.G. Levy D.E. Br. J. Haematol. 1991; 79: 9-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). While the molecular mechanism involved in the induction of IFN and ISG genes has been studied in great detail in vitro, it is largely unknown how much this system is affected by other stress factors. Of special concern is the potential impact of the bacterial infection on this system because concomitant infection with both bacteria and virus is a common clinical situation. LPS is the major component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria (4Rietschel E.T. Kirikae T. Schade F.U. Mamat U. Schmidt G. Loppnow H. Ulmer A.J. Zähringer U. Seydel U. Padova F.D. Schreier M. Brade H. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (1326) Google Scholar). Through activation of the target cells such as macrophages and B cells, LPS induces innate immune response and expression of cytokine genes which include IL-1, IFNB, and TNFα (5Cavaillon J.M.

Immunobiology. 1989; 179: 293-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). These cytokines are responsible for most of the biological effects of LPS and deregulated production of these cytokines results in the generalized inflammation or endotoxic shock. The signal transduction pathway for LPS is initiated by its binding to LBP (LPS binding protein) (7Gallay P. Heumann D. Le Roy D. Barras C. Glauser M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9935-9938Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), an acute phase reactant produced by the liver, followed by the binding to CD14, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored membrane protein (8Kielian T.L.

After binding to the receptor, LPS activates a number of tyrosine and serine kinases, including Raf-1, p42 and p44 isoforms of the MAP kinase, the p38 kinase, c-Jun kinase, ceramide activated kinase (CAK) and CD14 receptor-coupled kinase p56 lyn (11Liu M.K.

Furthermore, functional cooperation between LPS and IFNs, especially IFNγ, was shown to result in expression of a set of pro-inflammatory genes (21Gao J. Morrison D.C. Parmely T.J. Russell S.W.

Considering that IFNA and IFNB promoters contain cis-elements which are highly homologous to the interferon stimulation responsible element, these findings indicate that LPS may potentially modulate the expression of IFN genes. The signal transduction pathway leading to the induction of IFN genes expression in virus-infected cells is largely unknown.

It was shown that IRF-3 is expressed constitutively in a variety of tissues and cell lines and synergistically cooperates with virus in the induction of both IFNA and IFNB genes. Virus infection induces phosphorylation of IRF-3 at one threonine and several serine residues at the carboxyl-terminal end. The phosphorylated IRF-3 is then translocated from cytoplasm to nucleus where it forms a complex with the transcription coactivator, p300/CBP (29Lin R. Heylbroeck C. Pitha M.P. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). IRF-7 is also phosphorylated in infected cells and transported from cytoplasm to nucleus. In contrast to IRF-3, IRF-7 is preferentially expressed in cells of lymphoid origin, and its transcription is stimulated by IFNA and virus infection (34Au W.C. Moore P.A. LaFleur D.W. Tombal B. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29210-29217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). While the role of IRF-3 and IRF-7 in the induction of IFN genes has been gradually unveiled, kinases that are responsible for the phosphorylation of IRF-3 and IRF-7 have not been identified yet. We have been interested in the influence of other pathogens such as bacteria, fungus, or parasites on the virus-mediated induction of IFNs. Mixed infection is a clinical condition that occurs with high frequency in the immune-compromised people as a consequence of HIV-1 infection, organ transplantation or cancer. As the initial step to address this question, we used LPS as the model to mimic the bacterial infection and examined whether it can influence the virus-mediated signaling pathway and induction of IFN gene expression. We have found that LPS is a potent suppressor of virus-mediated induction of IFN genes. Characterization of the underlying molecular mechanism has correlated the LPS-mediated suppression with the inhibition of the virus-mediated phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of IRF-3 and IRF-7. Furthermore, overexpression of IRF-3 partially reverted the LPS effect. Our study illustrates the scenario in which bacterial infection interferes with the virus-mediated induction of IFN genes expression. Raw cells were purchased from ATCC (American Type Culture Collection) and grown in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. NDV was propagated in the allantoic cavity of 10-day-old eggs. Sendai virus was purchased from Specific Pathogen-Free Avian Supply (Preston, CT). The antibody to mouse IRF-3 was a gift from Dr. T. Fujita (The Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science). Antibodies to human IRF-3 were prepared by immunization of rabbit with GST-IRF-3 fusion protein (32Juang Y.-T. Lowther W. Kellum M. Au W.-C. Lin R. Hiscott J. Pitha P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9837-9842Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). CD14 antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). LPS (Escherichia coli, serotype 055B5) was purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO), and mouse IFN (mixture of IFNA and IFNB) was purchased from Lee Biomolecular Research (San Diego, CA). The Raw-CMV-IRF-3 cell line was established by transfecting the pcDNA-IRF-3 into Raw cells and selecting for cells resistant to G418. A pool of stably transfected colonies was used in the experiments. The huIRF-3 expression plasmid, pcDNA-IRF-3, was constructed by cloning the full-length huIRF-3 cDNA into the pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) at theHindIII/NotI sites immediately 3′ to the CMV promoter. The plasmids used for synthesis of IFNA, IFNB, and IL-6 riboprobes have been described previously (40Bisat F. Raj N.B. Pitha P.M.

The plasmid containing the NDV-encoded nucleocapsid (NP) gene of NDV was obtained from Dr. T. Morrison (University of Massachusetts, Worchester, MA). The plasmids containing the murine IFNA4 promoter and its deletion mutants (IFNA4-(-464), IFNA4-(-118)) inserted in front of the CAT gene have been described before (42Au W.C. Raj N.B. Pine R. Pitha P.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2877-2884Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The GFP vector was obtained from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA), and the GFP-IRF-3 and GFP-IRF-7 expression plasmids were described previously (29Lin R. Heylbroeck C. Pitha M.P. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell.

Total RNA was isolated with TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD) and purified according to the protocol of the manufacturer. Ten micrograms of purified RNA was analyzed on 0.8% formaldehyde-agarose gel and followed by transfer to nitrocellulose paper. The filters were prehybridized in the hybridization buffer (50% formamide, 5× SSC, 150 μg/ml herring sperm DNA, 5× phosphatidylethanolamine) for 1 h and then hybridized with the 32P-labeled riboprobes in the same buffer in 65 °C (for cDNA probe, 50 °C) overnight. Blots were washed sequentially with the following buffers: 2× SSC,0.1% SDS; 0.5× SSC, 0.1%SDS; 0.1× SSC, 0.1%SDS until clear background was achieved. The ethidium bromide-stained gel was used as the loading control. Raw cells (3×10 6) were seeded on 60-mm dishes 1 day before transfection. Five micrograms of reporter IFNA4/CAT plasmids and 100 ng of β-galactosidase were transfected into Raw cells with Superfect reagent (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). When indicated, cells were infected with NDV or treated with LPS for the indicated time periods as described in the respective figure legend. The results from the CAT assay were normalized to an equal amount of β-galactosidase. Raw cells were treated with LPS or infected with Sendai virus as described in the figure legends. Whole cellular extracts were prepared by incubation of cell pellets in cell lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 5 mm sodium orthovanadate) on ice for 30 min. The extracts were cleared by ultracentrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 30 min, and proteins (30 μg) were separated by electrophoresis in 7.5% acrylamide, SDS gel and transferred to nitrocellulose paper. The Western blotting was performed by following the protocols of the manufacturer (ECL method, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) Raw cells (5×105 cells) were seeded in the chambered cover glass (Nunc, Naperville, IL) 24 h before transfection with 0.5 μg of GFP/IRF-3 (29Lin R. Heylbroeck C. Pitha M.P. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2986-2996Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar) or GFP/IRF-7 (34Au W.C. Moore P.A. LaFleur D.W. Tombal B. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29210-29217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) expression plasmids. Transfection was done with Superfect reagent (Qiagen), and 16 h after transfection, cells were treated with LPS at the time points described in the figure legends and infected with Sendai virus for 6 h. Cells were examined under fluorescence microscope at the wavelength of 507 nm. The pictures presented were recorded under the same magnification power and the same exposure time. To examine the effect of LPS treatment on the virus-mediated induction of IFNA and IFNB genes, the mouse macrophage cell line Raw 264.7 was treated with LPS (1 μg/ml) for 1 h and then infected with NDV (m.o.i. 5) for 6 h. Analysis of the relative levels of IFNA and IFNB mRNA has shown that IFNA mRNA could only be detected in NDV-infected cells but not in cells that were pretreated with LPS (Fig.1 A). The relative levels of IFNB mRNA were also suppressed in LPS-treated cells, but the level of suppression was lower than that of IFNA. In contrast, induction of IL-6 gene expression by NDV was enhanced by LPS pretreatment. The dose response experiments (Fig. 1 B) demonstrated that as low as 10 ng/ml of LPS was sufficient to suppress the levels of IFNA mRNA by about 80%, whereas the same amount of LPS suppressed the levels of IFNB mRNA only by about 30%. The kinetics study shown in Fig.1 B demonstrated that the suppression of IFN genes expression by LPS was very fast; treatment with LPS for 10 min was already able to suppress virus-mediated induction of IFNA and IFNB genes. In an independent experiment, the effective dose of LPS to mediate the suppression of IFNA gene induction has been determined to be as low as 3 ng/ml (data not shown). It was shown that the effect of LPS can be divided into low (∼ 1 ng/ml) and high dose effects and that the low dose effect was CD14-dependent (7Gallay P. Heumann D. Le Roy D. Barras C. Glauser M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9935-9938Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Because the inhibition of IFNA and IFNB genes expression could be observed with low levels of LPS, it seemed to indicate that LPS may employ a CD14-dependent pathway to suppress the virus-mediated induction of IFN. However, co-incubation of anti-CD14 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) with LPS neither blocked the LPS inhibition nor modulated the virus-mediated induction of IFNA and IFNB genes (data not shown). To determine whether the observed inhibition of IFN genes expression by LPS is a result of the inhibition of viral replication, we examined NDV replication in LPS-treated cells and untreated controls by analyzing the NP gene transcripts. An earlier study has observed that the levels of NDV NP transcripts could be correlated with the induction level of IFN mRNA (43Nickolaus P. Rammensee H.G. Zawatzky R. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1998; 18: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, at 6 h post-NDV infection, the high levels of NP transcripts could be detected (Fig. 2 A, lane 2), which were not modulated by LPS treatment applied at 1, 2.5, or 3.5 h after NDV infection (Fig. 2 A, lane 3–5). The relative levels of NP transcripts were, however, lower in cells infected with NDV in the presence of CHX (5 μg/ml) (Fig. 2 A, lane 7). Only when cells were treated with high levels of LPS (1 μg/ml) 1 h before virus infection (Fig. 2 A,lane 6) was viral replication inhibited, and the relative levels of NP transcripts were lower than in the infected, untreated controls. Pretreatment with LPS at 10 ng/ml and lower has not affected NP synthesis. Therefore, in the following experiments, we have used LPS at the concentration of 10 ng/ml for pretreatment and 1 μg/ml for LPS treatments initiated after virus infection. LPS was shown to induce a low level of IFNB in the monocytes and macrophages (44Belardelli F. Gessani S. Proietti E. Locardi C. Borghi P. Watanabe Y. Kawade Y. Gresser I. J. Gen. Virol. 1987; 68: 2203-2212Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 45Gessani S. Belardelli F. Borghi P. Boraschi D. Gresser I. J. Immunol. 1987; 139: 1991-1998PubMed Google Scholar). A previous study has disclosed that some of the effects of LPS on the macrophages, such as induction of nitric oxide, is due to the production of IFNB (46Fujihara M. Ito N. Pace J.L. Watanabe Y. Russell S.W. Suzuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12773-12778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although LPS treatment (1 μg/ml, 4 h) was unable to induce IFNA gene expression in Raw cells, IFNB mRNA could be detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction under the same treatment (data not shown). While LPS pretreatment (1 h) totally suppressed the virus-mediated induction of the IFNA gene, the exogenously added IFN (250 units/ml, 1 h) slightly enhanced the virus-mediated induction of the IFNA gene (data not shown). Furthermore, LPS-mediated suppression of IFNA genes expression was not affected by the presence of CHX (5 μg/ml) (data not shown). This concentration of CHX blocked the transcription of viral nucleocapsid gene by 80% (Fig.2 A, lane 7). These data demonstrated that the effect of LPS pretreatment was not caused by IFN or any other LPS-induced protein. The study of the interaction between LPS and virus in the context of IFN induction was further extended by treating Raw cells with LPS at different time points after the virus infection to determine at which stages of viral infection the LPS-mediated inhibition is still effective. As shown in Fig. 2 B, the inhibition of IFNA and IFNB genes expression was less effective if LPS treatment was started later than 3 h after NDV infection. In contrast, the induction of IL-6 was enhanced by LPS treatment even when started as late as 3.5 h post-infection. The LPS-mediated inhibition was also not specific for NDV infection and also could be demonstrated in Raw cells infected with Sendai virus (data not shown). To determine whether the LPS-mediated inhibition of the IFN genes induction is regulated at the transcriptional level, we analyzed the effect of LPS on the inducible expression of a reporter gene in transiently transfected Raw cells. The cells were transfected with a plasmid containing the CAT gene under the control of the IFNA4 promoter, infected with NDV, and treated with LPS as indicated in Fig.3. It can be seen that LPS treatment, either before or after virus infection, suppressed virus-mediated induction of IFNA/CAT plasmid by 2–5-fold, indicating that LPS suppression occurs at the transcriptional level. The suppression was more effective in the cells treated with LPS before or 1 h after the infection than at a later time post-infection. This is consistent with the results obtained when the expression of the endogenous IFNA gene was analyzed. To determine whether the LPS inhibits the virus-mediated transcriptional activation of IFNA promoter by induction of phosphatases, we treated cells with okadaic acid, a known inhibitor of phosphatases (PP1 and PP2A) before and simultaneously with LPS treatment. However, the inhibition of virus-mediated induction of IFN/CAT plasmid was not affected by okadaic acid. To further define the cis-elements of the IFNA4 promoter that are critical for LPS-mediated suppression, plasmids containing deletion mutants of IFNA4 promoters linked to the CAT reporter gene were used for transfection. We have found that as short as −118 bp of the IFNA promoter, which contains a 35-bp long virus-inducible element (IE), is able to confer the LPS-mediated inhibition (data not shown). We and others have recently described that IRF-3 serves as a transducer of virus-mediated signaling from cytoplasm to nucleus and plays a critical role in the induction of IFNA and IFNB genes (29Lin R. Heylbroeck C. Pitha M.P. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2986-2996Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar, 30Yoneyama M. Suhara W. Fukuhara Y. Fukuda M. Nishida E. Fujita T.

Chem. 1998; 273: 29210-29217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). It was shown that IRF-3 is phosphorylated in infected cells and consequently translocated to the nucleus, where it interacts with the transcription coactivator CBP/p300. To determine whether the LPS-mediated inhibition of IFNA and IFNB genes expression is the result of interference with IRF-3 function, we analyzed the effect of LPS on the virus-mediated phosphorylation of IRF-3. IRF-3 is constitutively present in uninfected Raw cells and infection of Raw cells with Sendai virus for 6 h resulted in a decrease of relative levels of IRF-3 and the phosphorylation of IRF-3, which was reflected by the appearance of a slow migrating band (Fig. 4) on Western blot analysis. These results are in agreement with our previous findings in which we demonstrated that phosphorylated IRF-3 is targeted for degradation presumably by the ubiquitin pathway (29Lin R. Heylbroeck C. Pitha M.P. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2986-2996Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). In infected, LPS-treated cells, phosphorylation of IRF-3 was prevented as indicated by the absence of the slow migrating IRF-3 band. The absence of this slow migrating band was most clear in cells treated with LPS 1 h before or 1 h after the infection (Fig. 4). Thus, for both the suppression of IRF-3 phosphorylation as well as for the inhibition of expression of the IFN genes, LPS treatment has to be initiated before or soon after virus infection. LPS treatment alone has not induced phosphorylation of IRF-3 protein (data not shown). To determine whether the suppression of phosphorylation of IRF-3 by LPS results in the inhibition of translocation of cytoplasmic IRF-3 into nucleus, we analyzed the effect of LPS treatment on nuclear translocation of the GFP-tagged IRF-3. In a transfection experiment with IFN/CAT plasmid, the GFP-tagged IRF-3 was able to stimulate expres"

Ubiquitin, a highly conserved 76-amino acid protein present in all eukaryotic cells, is involved in the degradation of short lived or structurally abnormal proteins. The process is accomplished through a unique posttranslational modification in which the carboxyl Gly-Gly terminus of ubiquitin is ligated covalently to lysine residues in acceptor proteins. Ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis is conducted via a multienzyme, ATP-dependent degradative pathway (1Jentsch S. Seufert W. Hauser H.-P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1089: 127-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Other cellular processes in which the ubiquitin system is also involved include antigen processing (2Hochstrasser M.

The monoclonal nonspecific suppressor factor (MNSF) is a product of a concanavalin A (ConA)-activated murine hybridoma that inhibits the generation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced immunoglobulin-secreting cells, proliferation of mitogen-activated T and B cells, and interleukin (IL)-4 secretion by bone marrow-derived mast cells (10Nakamura M. Ogawa H. Tsunematsu T. J. Immunol. 1986; 136: 2904-2909PubMed Google Scholar,11Nakamura M. Ogawa H. Tsunematsu T. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 1799-1803PubMed Google Scholar). We have cloned a cDNA encoding a subunit of MNSF (12Nakamura M. Xavier R.M. Tsunematsu T. Tanigawa Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3463-3467Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The subunit, termed MNSF-β, encodes a protein of 133 amino acids consisting of a ubiquitin-like protein (36% identity with ubiquitin) fused to the ribosomal protein S30. We have reported evidence showing that the ubiquitin-like segment of MNSF-β (Ubi-L) is responsible for its activity (13Nakamura M. Xavier R.M. Tanigawa Y. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 532-538PubMed Google Scholar). Ubi-L inhibits IgE and IgG1 production by LPS-activated B cells and division in various tumor cell lines of murine origin (14Nakamura M. Nagata T. Xavier R.M. Tanigawa Y. Int. Immunol. 1996; 8: 1659-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Most recently, we have demonstrated that Ubi-L covalently conjugates to intracellular acceptor proteins in vitro (15Nagata T. Nakamura M. Kawauchi H. Tanigawa Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1401: 319-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) and in vivo (16Nakamura M. Tanigawa Y. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 683-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). MNSF-α, a subunit of MNSF, was identified as an acceptor protein for Ubi-L. It is probable that Ubi-L might be released in a posttranslationally modified form (i.e. conjugation of Ubi-L to MNSF-α) because it lacks a signal peptide (12Nakamura M. Xavier R.M. Tsunematsu T. Tanigawa Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3463-3467Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Partially purified isopeptidase dissociates Ubi-L from MNSF-α, suggesting that the COOH-terminal Gly-Gly doublet of Ubi-L may covalently ligate to the lysine residue in MNSF-α (17Nakamura M. Tsunematsu T. Tanigawa Y. Immunology. 1998; 94: 142-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Several other ubiquitin-like proteins have been isolated and characterized. Sentrin (also called SUMO-1), for instance, preferentially modifies nuclear proteins (18Kamitani T. Nguyen H.P. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14001-14004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Like ubiquitin, the ubiquitin cross-reactive protein (UCRP) conjugates to a number of intracellular proteins (19Haas A.L. Ahrens P. Bright P.M. Ankel H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11315-11323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, UCRP and Ubi-L are subjected to induction by interferon (IFN) (11Nakamura M. Ogawa H. Tsunematsu T. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 1799-1803PubMed Google Scholar, 20Blomstrom D.C. Fahey D. Kutny R. Korant B.D. Knight Jr., E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8811-8816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, they show type specificity for IFN and have immunoregulatory properties (14Nakamura M. Nagata T. Xavier R.M. Tanigawa Y. Int. Immunol. 1996; 8: 1659-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar,21Knight Jr., E. Cordova B. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 2280-2284PubMed Google Scholar), although they have opposite functions (22D'Cunha J. Knight Jr., E. Haas A.L. Truitt R.L. Borden E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Accordingly, ubiquitin-like proteins may be involved in many biological reactions such as immune responses. We have presented evidence that mitogen-activated T and B cells, and murine lymphoid cell lines, may have an MNSF receptor (23Nakamura M. Ogawa H. Tsunematsu T. Cell. Immunol. 1990; 130: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Although further biochemical and functional analysis of this receptor protein had been prevented because of the lack of a recombinant ligand, Ubi-L enabled us to isolate and characterize the receptor for MNSF. In the present study, we describe how Ubi-L specifically binds to cell surface receptors on mitogen-activated lymphocytes and the T helper type 2 clone, the D.10 cell. Studies were also performed to characterize the biochemical nature of Ubi-L receptor protein. Ubiquitin and rabbit anti-ubiquitin antibody (Ab) were obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Mouse recombinant IFN-γ (1 × 107 units/mg) was purchased from Genzyme (Cambridge, MA). Mouse IFN-α (1 × 107 units/ml) was obtained from SeroTech (Tokyo, Japan). Specific Ab against synthetic peptides corresponding to the ubiquitin-like region (PU1) was raised in rabbits as described previously (12Nakamura M. Xavier R.M. Tsunematsu T. Tanigawa Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3463-3467Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG Ab was from Capel (Durham, NC). D.10 (type 2 helper T cell clone), BW5147 (T lymphoma), EL4 (T lymphoma), MOPC-31C (plasmacytoma), NFS-5C-1 (pre-B lymphoma), L929 (fibroblast), and B16 (melanoma) were maintained in our laboratory. D.10 cells were maintained by biweekly stimulation with 100 μg/ml conalbumin in the presence of 0.5 unit/ml recombinant human IL-2. D.10 cells were used 10–12 days after stimulation with antigen. T cells were enriched from splenocytes by Lymphoprep centrifugation, passage over nylon wool, and treatment with a mixture of monoclonal Abs against B220 and MAC-1, and complement. All Ab depletions resulted in >99% of T cells as assayed by flow cytometry. For B cell preparation, splenocytes were incubated with a mixture of monoclonal Abs to Thy-1.2, L3T4, Lyt-2, MAC-1, and a granulocyte-specific antigen, and complement. Live cells were separated from dead cells and erythrocytes on Histopaque. With this procedure, the T-depleted population was consistently more than 95% B cells (B220+). Recombinant MNSF-β and Ubi-L were obtained as described previously (12Nakamura M. Xavier R.M. Tsunematsu T. Tanigawa Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3463-3467Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Briefly, either MNSF-β or Ubi-L was expressed as a fusion protein with glutathioneS-transferase (GST) using the pGEX-2T vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Ubiquitin-like segment was cleaved from the fusion partner by thrombin and purified by using anti-PU1 Ab coupled to Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). 500 μg of Ubi-L was mixed with a 20-fold molar excess of sulfo-N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide-biotin in 1 ml of 0.01m sodium phosphate, 0.15 m NaCl, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.2. Incorporation of biotin into Ubi-L was determined by the 2-(4′-hydroxyazobenzene)benzilic acid assay (24Green N.M. Biochem. J. 1965; 94: 23-24Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce, Rockford, IL). In some experiments, MNSF-β was also biotinylated as described for Ubi-L. Each molecule of Ubi-L was labeled with three molecules of biotin, albeit self-aggregation occurred during the procedure. Binding experiments were performed at 24 °C. Biotinylated Ubi-L (bio-Ubi-L; 20 nm) and the cells (2 × 106) to be tested were incubated in 200 μl of the binding medium (RPMI 1640 containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) for 2 h. Nonspecific binding, unless stated otherwise, was determined by measuring binding in the presence of 100-fold molar excess unlabeled Ubi-L. Specific binding was determined by subtracting nonspecific binding from total binding. The cells were washed with binding medium five times and incubated with 200 μl of streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate in the same medium for an additional hour. The cells were then washed five times with 0.01 m sodium phosphate, 0.15 m NaCl, pH, 7.4; the substrate, turbo-3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (100 μl; Pierce), was added for 5 min. The color reaction was halted by the addition of 1 m phosphoric acid (100 μl), and bound biotinylated proteins were quantified by measuring the absorbance of the reaction mixture at A 450 nm using a spectrometer. Bio-Ubi-L to cells was qualified by converting absorbance units into mol of bio-Ubi-L using a standard curve made relating the absorbances of known amounts of bio-Ubi-L. Unstimulated and ConA-stimulated D.10 cells (5 × 107) were washed three times with PBS and incubated in 2 ml of PBS containing 1 mg/ml sulfo-N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide-biotin at 4 °C for 1 h. Thereafter, cells were washed three times with cold PBS containing 15 mm glycine to quench the reaction. The packed cells were suspended in homogenization buffer containing 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cells were homogenized in a glass homogenizer. Detergent-insoluble materials was removed by centrifugation at 12, 000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant fraction was either subjected immediately to affinity chromatography or stored at −80 °C. All procedures were performed at 4 °C. D.10 cells (2 × 108 cells) were washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution and suspended in a hypotonic buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin). The suspension was mixed vigorously on a Vortex mixer and allowed to stand for 5 min before being spun at three different stages: 700 × gfor 5 min, 3,500 × g for 10 min, and 40,000 ×g for 1 h. The 40,000 × g precipitate was collected. Membranes were suspended in a solubilization buffer (1% Triton X-100, 10 mm 4-Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, pH 7.5) and left at 4 °C for 1 h with occasional shaking. The mixture was then spun (10,000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C), and the supernatant was collected and spun in an ultracentrifuge (100,000 × g, 60 min, 4 °C). The supernatant was subjected to ligand blot assay as described below. Ubi-L was coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to a procedure provided by the manufacturer. Detergent extract of membrane fraction (13 mg of protein) was applied to the Ubi-L column and incubated overnight under gentle agitation at 4 °C. The beads were then packed into a column and washed with sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm NaCl and 0.1% Triton X-100, and then the receptor was eluted with 1 m NaCl. The elutes were concentrated in Centricon-10 (Amicon, Beverly, MA) and subjected to reverse phase HPLC (Cosmosil, Nacalai tesq, Kyoto, Japan). To obtain small peptides suitable for amino acid sequence analysis, purified Ubi-L receptor was digested with trypsin at an enzyme:substrate molar ratio of 1:100 at 37 °C for 4 h. Tryptic peptides were separated by reverse phase HPLC using a C18 column equilibrated with 5% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The column was developed with a 5–60% linear gradient of acetonitrile for 120 min at 25 °C with a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. Peptides were sequenced directly from polyvinylidene difluoride membranes using an ABI477 protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems Inc.). The biotinylated cell surface proteins (250 μg of protein) were applied to the Ubi-L column and incubated as described above. The receptor was eluted with a 2 × SDS sample buffer, subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE, and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h and then washed three times with PBS containing 0.5% Tween 20 (PBS/Tween 20). Subsequently, the membranes were incubated with streptavidin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:1,000) in PBS/Tween 20 for 45 min. Membranes were washed five times in PBS/Tween 20 and developed using the ECL reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In some experiments, MNSF-β or ubiquitin was coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B and used for affinity chromatography as described above. Detergent-extracted membrane proteins were prepared from antigen-stimulated D.10 cells that were not labeled with biotin. The proteins (730 μg) were blotted onto nitrocellulose sheets as described above. The nitrocellulose sheets were incubated in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% Tween 20, and 50 μg/ml biotin-labeled Ubi-L or 200 μg/ml biotin-labeled ubiquitin for 16 h at 4 °C. The sheets were washed twice with binding buffer without the Ubi-L for 5 min and then incubated with streptavidin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase in PBS/Tween 20 for 30 min and subsequently washed three times for 5 min with the same buffer. Detection of labeled proteins was performed with ECL reagents. A protein band (82 kDa) was excised from polyacrylamide slab gels, minced, and injected subcutaneously together with complete Freund's adjuvant. Additional immunizations were given 3 and 4 weeks later. Ubi-L was labeled with125I as described previously for GST-Ubi-L (15Nagata T. Nakamura M. Kawauchi H. Tanigawa Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1401: 319-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Aliquots of the purified receptor (500 ng) were mixed with125I-Ubi-L and left for 1 h at 24 °C. Disuccinimidyl suberate was added to a final concentration of 0.3 mm. The cross-linking was stopped after 30 min at 4 °C by the addition of Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, to a final concentration of 20 mm. Mouse anti-receptor serum or control serum was added and incubated for 2 h at 24 °C. The antigen-antibody complex was adsorbed on protein A-Sepharose and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. In some experiments, ConA-activated D.10 cells were biotinylated and solubilized as described under “Labeling of Cell Surface Receptors by Biotinylation.” To determine whether proteins other than the 82-kDa polypeptide are associated with Ubi-L receptor, lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Ubi-L receptor Ab. Ubi-L receptor purified by a Ubi-L column was incubated at 4 °C for 6 h with 5 ml of WGA-Sepharose equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 0.1% Triton X-100. After incubation, the mixture was transferred to a column, the beads allowed to settle, and the column was washed with 50 ml of 0.5 m KCl, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100. The absorbed Ubi-L receptor was then eluted with 10 ml of 0.5 m N-acetyl-d-glucosamine, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 m NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 0.1% Triton X-100. The membrane fraction of ConA-activated D.10 cells was acidified by the addition of sodium citrate buffer, pH 6.2, to a final concentration of 50 mm. Neuraminidase (0.7 unit) was added, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. SDS sample buffer was added to deglycosylated samples and boiled for 5 min. SDS-PAGE and immunostaining with anti-Ubi-L receptor Ab were carried out as described above. Determination of IgE production by LPS-stimulated B cells was done as described previously (14Nakamura M. Nagata T. Xavier R.M. Tanigawa Y. Int. Immunol. 1996; 8: 1659-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Briefly, the purified B cells (5 × 105/ml) were cultured with 20 μg/ml LPS. Ubi-L, recombinant IFN-γ, and anti-Ubi-L receptor serum (IgG) were added at the initiation of the cultures. Supernatants were harvested 7 days after initiation of the cultures, and IgE production was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Previous experiments have shown that Ubi-L acts on murine helper T cell clone, D.10 cells (25Nakamura M. Xavier R.M. Tanigawa Y. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 2417-2419Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To investigate whether or not Ubi-L would bind specifically to D.10 cells, a binding assay was performed. Purified recombinant Ubi-L enabled acquisition of bio-Ubi-L with a high specific activity comparable to that of unlabeled Ubi-L. As shown in Fig. 1, bio-Ubi-L bound to ConA-activated (48 h), but not to unstimulated D.10 cells. Bio-Ubi-L bound to the activated D.10 cells most rapidly at 24 °C (data not shown). We also tested the possibility that 14.5-kDa MNSF-β (Ubi-L-ribosomal protein S30), which shows Ubi-L-like activity (26Suzuki K. Nakamura M. Dekio S. Nariai Y. Tanigawa Y. Immunobiology. 1996; 195: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), might bind to the D.10 cells. It should be noted that the COOH-terminal Gly-Gly doublet of Ubi-L is followed by ribosomal protein S30. Despite of the blocked COOH terminus, biotinylated MNSF-β bound to ConA-activated D.10 cells (Fig. 1), as did Ubi-L. The pattern of MNSF-β binding was much the same. In contrast, ribosomal protein S30 did not bind to the cells (data not shown). These findings indicate that Ubi-L may not bind to its receptors via the COOH-terminal glycyl doublet responsible for ubiquitination process. Because Ubi-L shows a 36% homology with ubiquitin (12Nakamura M. Xavier R.M. Tsunematsu T. Tanigawa Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3463-3467Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), we tested the possibility of the binding of ubiquitin to D.10 cells. Fig. 1 shows that 10 mmbiotinylated ubiquitin, 500-fold the amount of Ubi-L used in the binding experiments, bound slightly to antigen-stimulated D.10 cells probably because of the homology. We also examined whether Ubi-L would recognize mitogen-activated lymphocytes. T cells and B cells were separated from splenocytes as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig. 2, exposure of the T cells to 3 μg/ml ConA for 2 days led to maximal binding of bio-Ubi-L on the cell surface. Bio-Ubi-L bound to 20 μg/ml LPS-activated B cells almost in the same manner as ConA-activated T cells. In contrast, neither unstimulated (day 0) T cells nor B cells showed any significant bio-Ubi-L binding. These results are consistent with those of binding experiments of native MNSF (23Nakamura M. Ogawa H. Tsunematsu T. Cell. Immunol. 1990; 130: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar).Figure 2Binding of bio-Ubi-L to B cells and T cells. The specific binding of bio-Ubi-L (20 nm) at 24 °C to 3 μg/ml ConA-stimulated (48 h) T cells (5 × 106) (●) and 20 μg/ml LPS-stimulated B cells (5 × 106) (○) was determined. Specific binding is presented in the figure as described in the legend to Fig. 1. The data shown are the means ± S.D. of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We next investigated the cellular distribution of the Ubi-L receptor. Binding experiments were carried out using various cells of murine and human origin. Among a series of mouse cell lines tested, EL4 and MOPC-31C cells apparently carried the Ubi-L receptors (TableI). Of note, both cell lines are sensitive to Ubi-L in terms of inhibition of proliferation (13Nakamura M. Xavier R.M. Tanigawa Y. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 532-538PubMed Google Scholar). D.10 cells were stimulated with antigen (conalbumin) and ConA, as described previously (25Nakamura M. Xavier R.M. Tanigawa Y. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 2417-2419Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Ubi-L bound to both stimulated D.10 cells. Together, the expression of Ubi-L receptor should be limited to lymphoid cells. In contrast, Ubi-L did not bind to any human cell lines such as Jurkat, K562, MOLT-3, Namalwa, HL60, U937, Detroit 562 (data not shown), suggestive of the species specificity of Ubi-L action.Table ICellular distribution of murine Ubi-L receptorDesignationCharacteristicsUbi-L boundaSpecifically bound Ubi-L was determined as described in the legend to Fig. 1.pmol/10E6 cellsEL4T lymphoma0.6 ± 0.3MOPC-31CPlasmacytoma0.5 ± 0.1D.10Type 2 helper T cells cloneUnstimulated—bLess than 0.05 pmol/10E6 cells.AntigencD.10 cells were stimulated with conalbumin (100 μg/ml) for 48 h.0.7 ± 0.2ConAdD.10 cells were costimulated with 2 μg/ml ConA and 0.5 unit/ml IL-1β for 48 h.1.1 ± 0.1BW5147T lymphoma—NFS-5C-1Pre-B lymphoma—L929Fibroblast—B16Melanoma—a Specifically bound Ubi-L was determined as described in the legend to Fig. 1.b Less than 0.05 pmol/10E6 cells.c D.10 cells were stimulated with conalbumin (100 μg/ml) for 48 h.d D.10 cells were costimulated with 2 μg/ml ConA and 0.5 unit/ml IL-1β for 48 h. Open table in a new tab To clarify the specificity of the Ubi-L binding, competitive assay experiments were performed by adding to the experimental system the nonlabeled Ubi-L, MNSF-β, ubiquitin, and other suppressive cytokines such as IFN-γ and IL-10. As can be seen in Fig. 3, Ubi-L and MNSF-β exclusively inhibited the binding of bio-Ubi-L to ConA-activated D.10 cells. However, the irrelevant ligands (IFN-γ and IL-10) did not show any competition, indicative of the specificity for Ubi-L binding. Ubiquitin showed a slight but significant inhibition of the Ubi-L binding in agreement with previous finding that ubiquitin inhibits Ubi-L-induced suppression (13Nakamura M. Xavier R.M. Tanigawa Y. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 532-538PubMed Google Scholar). We next investigated biochemical nature of the receptor protein for Ubi-L. Cross-linking experiments with the use of recombinant Ubi-L were insufficient for identification of Ubi-L receptor protein(s). We observed heterogeneous bands on SDS-PAGE (data not shown), which seemed to be self-aggregation of Ubi-L probably because of its strong hydrophobicity. We also employed 125I-GST-Ubi-L, which is a stable fusion protein. It should be noted that the activity of GST-Ubi-L is lower than that of Ubi-L. 2M. Nakamura and Y. Tanigawa, unpublished data. A trace amount of protein (approximately 120 kDa) was reproducibly cross-linked by125I-GST-Ubi-L (data not shown). Therefore, we decided to use affinity chromatography on an immobilized Ubi-L column as the main step of Ubi-L receptor purification. D.10 cells were stimulated with ConA, biotinylated, and lysed. Biotinylated membrane proteins (250 μg/0.1 ml) were incubated with Ubi-L-Sepharose, and bound proteins were eluted as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The eluates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes, and visualized by ECL system. As depicted in Fig.4 A, only a single band of 82 kDa under nonreducing conditions was observed (lane 2). The migrated position of this band was unchanged under reducing conditions (lane 3). These results are consistent with the cross-linking experiments with the use of 125I-GST-Ubi-L (34 kDa) in terms of the molecular mass. On the contrary, no band was recovered from the biotinylated membrane proteins from unstimulated D.10 cells (lane 1), in good accordance with the results of binding assay (Fig. 1) and the previous observations that antigen-activated, but not unstimulated, D.10 cells are sensitive to Ubi-L (25Nakamura M. Xavier R.M. Tanigawa Y. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 2417-2419Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Additionally, we made MNSF-β and ubiquitin affinity columns to isolate Ubi-L receptor protein(s). The same band of 82 kDa was obtained from MNSF-β column, whereas no significant amount of protein band could be recovered from the ubiquitin column (data not shown). To confirm that the 82-kDa protein is a Ubi-L receptor, a ligand blot assay was carried out. Detergent-extracted membrane proteins were prepared from ConA-stimulated D.10 cells and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. Bio-Ubi-L specifically recognized the 82-kDa band (Fig. 4 B, lane 1), suggesting that it should be a ligand for this receptor protein. In contrast, Ubi-L did not bind to any membrane proteins from unstimulated D.10"
https://openalex.org/W2017837456,"In a previous study, it was shown that the protein encoded by the gene B318L of African swine fever virus (ASFV) is a trans-prenyltransferase that catalyzesin vitro the condensation of farnesyl diphosphate and isopentenyl diphosphate to synthesize geranylgeranyl diphosphate and longer chain prenyl diphosphates (Alejo, A., Yáñez, R. J., Rodrı́guez, J. M., Viñuela, E., and Salas, M. L. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 9417–9423). To investigate the in vivo function of the viral enzyme, we have determined, in this work, its subcellular localization and activity in cell extracts. Two systems were used in these studies: cells infected with ASFV and cells infected with a recombinant pseudo-Sindbis virus carrying the complete B318L gene. In this latter system, the trans-prenyltransferase was found to colocalize with the endoplasmic reticulum marker protein-disulfide isomerase, whereas in cells infected with ASFV, the viral enzyme was present in cytoplasmic viral assembly sites, associated with precursor viral membranes derived from the endoplasmic reticulum. In addition, after subcellular fractionation, the viral enzyme partitioned into the membrane fraction. Extraction of membrane proteins with alkaline carbonate and Triton X-114 indicated that the ASFV enzyme behaved as an integral membrane protein. The membrane enzyme synthesized predominantly all-trans-geranylgeranyl diphosphate from farnesyl diphosphate and isopentenyl diphosphate. These results indicate that the viral B318L protein is atrans-geranylgeranyl-diphosphate synthase, being the only enzyme of this type that is known to have a membrane localization.

In the biosynthetic pathway of isoprenoid compounds, different enzymes belonging to the family of prenyltransferases catalyze the condensation of isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) 1The abbreviations used are: IPP, isopentenyl diphosphate; FPP, farnesyl diphosphate; GGPP, geranylgeranyl diphosphate; ASFV, African swine fever virus; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; BHK, baby hamster kidney; Ara-C, cytosine arabinoside; Q, ubiquinone. 1The abbreviations used are: IPP, isopentenyl diphosphate; FPP, farnesyl diphosphate; GGPP, geranylgeranyl diphosphate; ASFV, African swine fever virus; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; BHK, baby hamster kidney; Ara-C, cytosine arabinoside; Q, ubiquinone. with allylic diphosphates to give rise to prenyl diphosphates of different chain lengths and double-bond stereochemistry (1Poulter C.D.

Thus, farnesyl-diphosphate synthase and geranylgeranyl-diphosphate synthase produce the 15-carbon all-trans-FPP and the 20-carbon all-trans-GGPP isoprenoids, respectively, which can serve as substrates for protein farnesylation or geranylgeranylation (4Glomset J.A.

Biochem. 1996; 65: 241-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1719) Google Scholar). FPP is also the direct precursor for the synthesis of cholesterol and serves as allylic substrate for cis- andtrans-polyprenyl-diphosphate synthases involved in the synthesis of the long chain isoprenoids with cis- ortrans-stereochemistry, which are the precursors of dolichols and the lateral chain of ubiquinones, respectively (6Chojnacki T.

Prenyltransferases have been described in a wide variety of organisms, both prokaryotic and eukaryotic, where their isoprenoid products play essential roles in cellular processes. More recently, it has been shown that prenylation of cellular or viral proteins is required for the multiplication of certain viruses (8Glenn J.S. Watson J.A. Havel C.M. White J.M. Science. 1992; 256: 1331-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 9Hwang S.B. Lai M.M.C. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 7659-7662Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Overmeyer J.H. Maltese W.A. J. Biol.

In this connection, we have previously reported (12Alejo A. Yáñez R.J. Rodrı́guez J.M. Viñuela E. Salas M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9417-9423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) the characterization of the first viraltrans-prenyltransferase encoded by African swine fever virus (ASFV), a large enveloped DNA virus with an icosahedral morphology that assembles in the cytoplasm of the infected cell and causes a severe disease in domestic pigs (13Viñuela E.

The ASFV gene, designatedB318L, contains an amino-terminal hydrophobic sequence and conserves all the regions characteristic of prenyltransferases. After cloning of the gene without the hydrophobic sequence, expression inEscherichia coli as a fusion to the E. coliprotein thioredoxin, and purification, it was shown that the recombinant enzyme catalyzed the trans-addition of IPP to allylic diphosphates, with FPP being the best substrate of the reaction (12Alejo A.

However, under a variety of reaction conditions, the enzyme did not synthesize a unique product with a specific chain length. Although the major product of the reaction was GGPP, using IPP and FPP as substrates, additional longer chain prenyl diphosphates, containing up to 13 isoprene units, were synthesized in significant amounts. In addition, the viral enzyme could use GGPP efficiently as substrate. These properties are clearly distinct from those described for the cytosolic trans-GGPP synthase, the enzyme involved in the synthesis of the prenyl donor for protein geranylgeranylation, since this enzyme synthesizes GGPP as the ultimate product and is unable to use GGPP as substrate (15Hugueney P. Camara B. FEBS Lett. 1990; 273: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 16Sagami H. Morita Y. Ogura K. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 832-838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, specific all-trans-polyprenyl-diphosphate synthases, such as octaprenyl-diphosphate synthase (21Fujisaki S. Nishino T. Katsuki H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1986; 99: 1327-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and solanesyl-diphosphate synthase (22Ohnuma S. Koyama T. Ogura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23706-23713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), have also been shown to catalyze the synthesis of a defined length product. Since the ASFV trans-prenyltransferase contains a putative transmembrane domain at the amino-terminal end, it was possible that its interaction with membranes in the cell environment could determine the chain length of the product synthesized, as in the case of some long chain polyprenyl-diphosphate synthases (23Matsuoka S. Sagami H. Kurisaki A. Ogura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3464-3468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, as a step toward a better understanding of the in vivo activity and function of the ASFV trans-prenyltransferase, we have examined the subcellular localization and activity of the viral enzyme in cells infected with ASFV or with a recombinant pseudo-Sindbis virus carrying the ASFV gene. We show that the viral protein is associated with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes in cells infected with the recombinant Sindbis virus, whereas in ASFV-infected cells, the enzyme is localized in the cytoplasmic viral assembly sites, where it is found associated with membrane structures that have been shown recently by Rouiller et al. (24Rouiller I. Brookes S.M. Hyatt A.D. Windsor M. Wileman T. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2373-2387Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Andrés et al. (25Andrés G. Garcı́a-Escudero R. Simón-Mateo C. Viñuela E. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8988-9001Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to derive from the ER. We also show that the ASFV enzyme is an integral membrane protein and that the membrane-bound enzyme synthesizes preferentially all-trans-GGPP. Vero (African green monkey kidney) cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% newborn calf serum. Baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells were from Invitrogen and grown in α-modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mml-glutamine and 5% fetal bovine serum. The Vero adapted ASFV strain BA71V was propagated and titrated as described previously (26Enjuanes L. Carrascosa A.L. Moreno M.A. Viñuela E. J. Gen. Virol. 1976; 32: 471-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). [1-14C]IPP (specific activity of 56 Ci/mol) was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech;trans,trans,cis-[1-3H]geranylgeraniol was from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc.; and unlabeled isoprenoid compounds and cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) were from Sigma. Silica Gel 60 and RP-18F254S thin-layer plates were from Merck, and acid phosphatase was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The ASFV B318L gene was cloned into a pRSET vector (Invitrogen), and the recombinant protein was expressed inE. coli and purified under denaturing conditions using single-step Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography. Antibodies against the purified recombinanttrans-prenyltransferase (B318L protein) were raised in rabbits. The immune serum obtained recognized the recombinant protein on Western blots. The anti-protein-disulfide isomerase mouse monoclonal antibody (1D3) was from Stressgen Biotech Corp. Preconfluent monolayers of Vero cells were infected with ASFV at a multiplicity of infection of 10 plaque-forming units/cell, and at different times post-infection, the cells were pulse-labeled for 2 h with a mixture of [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine (150 μCi/1 × 106 cells; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Lysates were prepared by resuspending the cells in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1% SDS), diluted 10-fold in the same buffer, preimmunoprecipitated with preimmune serum and protein A-Sepharose, and then immunoprecipitated with a 1:100 dilution of preimmune or anti-B318L protein serum and protein A-Sepharose. Bound proteins were eluted by boiling in electrophoresis sample buffer and resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel (7–20%) electrophoresis. For Western blots, Vero cells were infected with ASFV as described above, and at different times post-infection, the cells were lysed in electrophoresis sample buffer. Equivalent amounts of the cell lysates were electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (7–20%) and subsequently transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline/Tween buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) with 5% dry milk powder for 1 h and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with a 1:500 dilution of the anti-pB318L serum in Tris-buffered saline/Tween with 1% dry milk powder. The membranes were washed with Tris-buffered saline/Tween and incubated with a peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit serum (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the proteins were detected with an electrochemiluminescence system (ECL system, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The ASFV gene B318L, cloned in the pBluescript plasmid, was subcloned in the BbrPI restriction site of the pSinRep5 plasmid (Invitrogen Sindbis Expression System, Version C) to obtain the recombinant plasmid pSinRep/B318L, which was linearized withNotI. The linearized plasmid pSinRep/B318L and the DH-BB helper template were transcribed in vitro using the InvitroScript CAP SP6 in vitro transcription kit (Invitrogen). To obtain recombinant pseudovirus, the in vitro transcripts were transfected by electroporation into BHK cells following the instructions provided by Invitrogen. At 24 h after transfection, the supernatants were collected, and pseudovirions were concentrated by ultracentrifugation onto sucrose cushions. Vero cells, grown on chamber slides, were mock-infected or infected with ASFV at a multiplicity of infection of 1 plaque-forming unit/cell and fixed at 14 h post-infection with methanol at −20 °C for 5 min. The cells were then incubated with anti-B318L and anti-protein-disulfide isomerase antibodies, as indicated in the legend to Fig. 2, in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin at 37 °C for 1 h; rinsed three times for 10 min with the same buffer; and incubated with fluoresceinated goat anti-rabbit (Tago, Inc.) and Texas Red-linked sheep anti-mouse (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) antibodies. Nuclear and viral DNAs were visualized by staining with 5 μg of bisbenzimide (Hoechst 33258, Sigma) per ml of phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min. Cells were examined under a Zeiss Axiovert microscope. BHK cells were grown as described above and infected at a multiplicity of infection of 0.2 infective units/cell (27Ausubel F.M. Brub R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidnan J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular BiologyUnit 16.20. Greene Publishing Associates/Wiley-Interscience, New York1994Google Scholar) with recombinant pseudo-Sindbis virus carrying the ASFV B318L gene (Sind/B318L), and at 24 h post-infection, the cells were fixed and processed for immunofluorescence as detailed above. Vero cells were mock-infected or infected with ASFV at a multiplicity of infection of 10 plaque-forming units/cell and fixed, at 20 h post-infection, with 4% formaldehyde and 0.1% glutaraldehyde in 200 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, for 1 h at room temperature. After fixation, the cells were processed for cryosectioning as detailed by Andrés et al. (25Andrés G. Garcı́a-Escudero R. Simón-Mateo C. Viñuela E. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8988-9001Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ultrathin thawed cryosections were incubated with a 1:40 dilution of the anti-B318L antibody followed by protein A-gold (10 nm). Subcellular fractionation of Vero cells was performed as described (28Rome L. Garvin A.J. Allietta M.M. Neufeld E.F. Cell. 1979; 17: 143-153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Vero cells were mock-infected or infected with ASFV at a multiplicity of infection of 5 plaque-forming units/cell, and at 19 h post-infection, the cells were resuspended in homogenization buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.28 m sucrose, 2 mm EDTA, and 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride and then disrupted by N2 cavitation at 400 p.s.i for 10 min at 4 °C or by passaging through a 25-gauge syringe. In the case of mock- or Sindbis virus-infected BHK cells, the cells were resuspended in the same homogenization buffer as described above and disrupted manually using a Kontes homogenizer. In all cases, the homogenate was centrifuged at 700 × g for 5 min to sediment nuclei, and the supernatant fraction was centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to obtain the membrane and cytosolic fractions. For prenyltransferase assays, the membrane fraction was resuspended in homogenization buffer at a protein concentration of 3–7 mg/ml and stored, as the cytosolic fraction, at −20 °C until use. For the analysis of membrane association of the B318L protein, membrane fractions from mock- or ASFV-infected Vero cells were treated with sodium carbonate or Triton X-114 according to the methods of Fujikiet al. (29Fujiki Y. Hubbard A.L. Fowler S. Lazarov P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1374) Google Scholar) and Pryde and Phillips (30Pryde J.G. Phillips J.H. Biochem. J. 1986; 233: 525-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). For carbonate treatment, membrane fractions from 4 × 106 cells were resuspended in 100 μl of 0.1 mNa2CO3, pH 11.5; incubated for 30 min at 4 °C; and subsequently centrifuged for 10 min at 100,000 ×g. The supernatant and the sediment were dissociated with electrophoresis sample buffer. For treatment with Triton X-114, an equivalent amount of the membrane fraction was resuspended in 100 μl of 2% Triton X-114, 150 mm NaCl, and 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5; incubated for 10 min at 4 °C; and then transferred to 30 °C for 20 min. The samples were briefly spun in a microcentrifuge to separate the lower detergent-rich phase from the upper phase, and both phases were dissociated as described above. Equivalent amounts of each sample were subjected to Western blot analysis. The regular assay mixture contained, in a final volume of 0.1 ml, 50 μm [1-14C]IPP (specific activity of 24 cpm/pmol), 100 μmall-trans-FPP, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 20 mm KF, and enzyme protein as indicated. After 4 h at 37 °C, the products were extracted with butanol as described before (12Alejo A. Yáñez R.J. Rodrı́guez J.M. Viñuela E. Salas M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9417-9423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), and the butanol extracts were treated with acid phosphatase by the method of Fujii et al. (31Fujii H. Koyama T. Ogura K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 712: 716-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The hydrolysates were extracted with hexane, and the hexane-soluble products were analyzed by reversed-phase RP-18 thin-layer chromatography in acetone/H2O (95:5). The positions of authentic standards were visualized with iodine vapor. The thin-layer plates were exposed for autoradiography on a Fuji BAS-MP 20405 imaging plate, and the exposed imaging plate was analyzed with a Fuji BAS 1500 analyzer. Densitometric analysis of the bands was performed using TINA Version 2.0 software. We have previously shown that the ASFVtrans-prenyltransferase gene B318L is transcribed at late times of infection (12Alejo A. Yáñez R.J. Rodrı́guez J.M. Viñuela E. Salas M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9417-9423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In agreement with this, the results of immunoprecipitation experiments presented in Fig.1 A indicate that the synthesis of the enzyme in ASFV-infected Vero cells was initiated at 8–10 h post-infection, a time at which viral DNA replication is already underway (32Salas M.L. Rey-Campos J. Almendral J.M. Talavera A. Viñuela E. Virology. 1986; 152: 228-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar); reached a maximum at 13–15 h post-infection; and decreased at later times. Furthermore, the protein was not synthesized in the presence of Ara-C, an inhibitor of viral DNA replication and late transcription (32Salas M.L. Rey-Campos J. Almendral J.M. Talavera A. Viñuela E. Virology. 1986; 152: 228-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), indicating that the ASFVtrans-prenyltransferase is a late protein. Western blot analysis revealed the presence of a specific band of ∼37 kDa in ASFV-infected cells. This band was first detected at 12 h post-infection and accumulated up to 24 h post-infection (Fig.1 B). In keeping with the immunoprecipitation results, the protein band was not seen in the presence of Ara-C (Fig.1 B). As mentioned in the Introduction, thetrans-prenyltransferase of ASFV contains a putative transmembrane domain at its amino-terminal end, suggesting an association of the protein with cellular or viral membranes. To test this possibility, we first examined the intracellular localization of the trans-prenyltransferase in BHK cells infected with a recombinant pseudo-Sindbis virus carrying the ASFV gene to determine whether the enzyme was targeted to cellular membranes independently of other ASFV proteins or processes related to the infection with ASFV. The results of double immunofluorescence experiments using antibodies against the ASFV trans-prenyltransferase (B318L protein) and the ER marker protein protein-disulfide isomerase indicated that the viral enzyme localized to the ER (Fig. 2,B and C). A very low background immunofluorescence was observed with the anti-B318L antibody in the case of mock-infected BHK cells, which served as a control (Fig.2 A). A similar low background signal was detected with this antibody in mock-infected Vero cells (Fig. 2 D). On the other hand, in Vero cells infected for 14 h with ASFV, thetrans-prenyltransferase was located in discrete cytoplasmic areas close to the nucleus, which were identified as viral assembly sites by staining of the viral DNA with bisbenzimide (Fig. 2,E and G). It should also be noted that at an earlier time of infection (10 h), when the synthesis of the protein has just been initiated (see Fig. 1), the same immunofluorescent pattern was obtained (data not shown). In contrast, the protein-disulfide isomerase signal was excluded from these areas and was found surrounding the viral factories, whereas in cells lacking factories, the signal showed a pattern characteristic of the ER (Fig.2 F). To examine in detail the localization of thetrans-prenyltransferase within the viral factories, immunocytochemical studies with electron microscopy were performed. For this, ultrathin thawed cryosections of Vero cells mock-infected or infected with ASFV for 20 h were incubated with the anti-B318L protein antibody followed by protein A-gold. A low immunogold labeling was observed in the case of mock-infected cells (Fig.3 A). In cells infected with ASFV, the antibody strongly labeled the region of the viral factories, in keeping with the immunofluorescence results (Fig. 3 B). Within the factories, the gold grains were seen decorating mainly membrane-like structures (Fig. 3 C), which are precursors of the inner envelope of ASFV (33Andrés G. Simón-Mateo C. Viñuela E. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2331-2341Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and are derived from the ER (24Rouiller I. Brookes S.M. Hyatt A.D. Windsor M. Wileman T. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2373-2387Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Andrés G. Garcı́a-Escudero R. Simón-Mateo C. Viñuela E. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8988-9001Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Gold grains were essentially excluded from mature virus particles (Fig.3 B). In agreement with this, Western blot analysis of highly purified ASFV using the antibody against the B318L protein has indicated that the trans-prenyltransferase is not a structural component of the virus (data not shown). The above studies indicated that the ASFVtrans-prenyltransferase was associated in the viral factories with membranes that are derived from the ER. To further investigate the association of the viral enzyme with membranes, cell fractionation experiments were performed, and the distribution of the viral enzyme into membrane and cytosolic fractions from ASFV-infected cells was examined using the anti-B318L protein antibody. As a control, a similar fractionation of mock-infected cells was carried out. In the membrane fraction from ASFV-infected cells, a specific band corresponding to the ASFV prenyltransferase was detected (Fig.4, lane 4). This band was not found in the cytosolic or membrane fractions from mock-infected cells (Fig. 4, lanes 1 and 2). On the other hand, a cellular protein that partitioned exclusively into the cytosolic fraction from mock-infected and infected cells was detected (Fig. 4,lanes 1 and 3). To analyze the nature of the association of the viral enzyme with membranes, washes with alkaline carbonate and extractions with Triton X-114 were performed as indicated under “Experimental Procedures.” After washing the membranes from infected cells with alkaline carbonate and centrifugation, the ASFV B318L protein remained associated with the sediment (Fig. 4, lanes 5 and 6), indicating that it is not peripherally bound to the membranes. On the other hand, phase extraction of membrane proteins with Triton-X114 showed that the viral protein behaved as an integral membrane protein since it partitioned into the detergent phase (Fig. 4, lanes 7 and8). To determine the activity and products of the ASFV prenyltransferase in extracts from infected cells, the cytosolic and membrane fractions were incubated with [1-14C]IPP and FPP in a standard reaction mixture (see “Experimental Procedures”), and the reaction products were analyzed by reversed-phase thin-layer chromatography after butanol extraction and hydrolysis with acid phosphatase to the corresponding alcohols as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A low GGPP synthase activity was detected in the cytosolic fraction of mock-infected cells, but this activity did not increase in the virus-infected cells (data not shown). The results obtained with the membrane fractions are shown in Fig.5. In the case of mock-infected cells, the major products formed were prenyl diphosphates of 30 and 50 carbons, whereas the levels of GGPP synthesized were very low (Fig.5 A, lane 2). In contrast, the membrane fraction of ASFV-infected cells produced predominantly GGPP, together with geranylfarnesyl diphosphate, although in considerably lower amounts (Fig. 5 A, lane 4). On the other hand, the synthesis of the C30 and C50 products was comparable to that found in mock-infected cells. In the presence of 1% Triton X-100, the products synthesized remained essentially unchanged (Fig. 5 A, lanes 3 and 5). In all cases, similar levels of 14C-labeled FPP were produced, probably due to the presence of IPP isomerase in the membrane preparations. The product distribution obtained with the enzyme from the membrane fraction of infected cells was very similar using different amounts of protein (between 50 and 150 μg) in the assay and various reaction times (1–16 h) (data not shown). A densitometric quantification of the products synthesized by the membrane fractions of mock- and ASFV-infected cells showed an increase of ∼25-fold in the amount of GGPP generated by the prenyltransferase of infected cells with respect to that of mock-infected cells (TableI). On the contrary, no significant differences were found in the levels of the C30 and C50 polyprenyl diphosphates. The C50 isoprenoid detected in the mock-infected and infected cells could be a precursor of the ubiquinone (Q) side chain. In keeping with this, an analysis of the Q species present in Vero cells mock-infected or infected with ASFV revealed that Q-10, which contains a lateral chain of 50 carbons, was the predominant form in both cases. 2A.

Open table in a new tab The products were quantified by densitometric scanning, and the data were then normalized with respect to the farnesol band in each experiment. The data are means ± S.E. of at least eight independent experiments. As described previously (12Alejo A. Yáñez R.J. Rodrı́guez J.M. Viñuela E. Salas M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9417-9423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and as shown in Fig. 5 A(lane 1), the purified recombinant ASFVtrans-prenyltransferase produced prenyl diphosphates containing 4–12 isoprene units. In contrast, chain elongation by the enzyme present in the membrane fraction from infected cells was more limited (Fig. 5 A, lanes 4 and 5). Thus, the ratio of GGPP to geranylfarnesyl diphosphate (C25) was 3.6 ± 0.7 (n = 6) in the case of the recombinant enzyme and 8.5 ± 1.5 (n = 9) for the membrane prenyltransferase. Additional longer chain isoprenoids were synthesized in very low amounts by the enzyme from infected cells (Fig. 5 A). To determine the trans/cis-configuration of GGPP synthesized by the viral enzyme, the radioactivity of the geranylgeraniol band was eluted from the reversed-phase chromatogram and analyzed by silica gel thin-layer chromatography. The resulting autoradiogram revealed a main spot comigrating with all-trans-geranylgeraniol (Fig. 5 B, lane 1), as in the case of the recombinant ASFVtrans-prenyltransferase (lane 2), whereas no product comigrating withtrans,trans,cis-geranylgeraniol was detected. Taken together, the above results suggested that the activity detected in the membrane fraction of infected cells corresponded to the ASFVtrans-prenyltransferase. To confirm this, we first tested the effect of the anti-B318L antibody on the reaction catalyzed by this subcellular fraction. Fig. 6 Ashows that the specific antibody strongly inhibited the formation of GGPP and geranylfarnesyl diphosphate by the enzyme from infected cells (lanes 4 and 5), whereas a preimmune serum had no effect (lane 6). In contrast, the reaction catalyzed by the membrane fraction of mock-infected cells was not affected by the anti-B318L antibody (Fig. 6 A, lanes 2 and3), and this antibody did not decrease the formation of the C30 and C50 products obtained with the membrane preparation of infected cells (lanes 4 and 5), suggesting that these compounds are synthesized by the cellular polyprenyl-diphosphate synthase. In a different approach, we assayed prenyltransferase activity in a membrane fraction prepared from BHK cells infected with the recombinant Sind/B318L virus expressing the ASFV B318L gene. When compared with mock-infected BHK cells (Fig. 6 B, lane 1), a considerable increase (16-fold as determined by densitometric scanning) was observed in the amount of GGPP synthesized by the membrane fraction from cells infected with the recombinant Sind/B318L virus (lane 2). With this fraction, lower amounts of geranylfarnesyl diphosphate and C30–40 isoprenoid compounds were also produced. On the other hand, the synthesis of C45 and C50 polyprenyl diphosphates increased only 2.5-fold in the infected cells relative to mock-infected cells. Thus, the products generated by the enzyme present in the membrane fraction from cells infected with the recombinant Sindbis virus were very similar to those synthesized by the corresponding fraction from ASFV-infected cells. A previous characterization of thetrans-prenyltransferase encoded by ASFV showed that the purified recombinant enzyme, lacking an amino-terminal hydrophobic region and expressed as a fusion with the E. coli protein thioredoxin, catalyzed the synthesis of GGPP as the major product, as well as longer prenyl diphosphates containing up to 13 isoprene units, using FPP and IPP as substrates (12Alejo A. Yáñez R.J. Rodrı́guez J.M. Viñuela E. Salas M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9417-9423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). On the basis of these results, two possible roles for the viral enzyme during infection were proposed; one of them was the formation of GGPP, a product that could then be used for prenylation of proteins during the virus life cycle. If this were the case, the synthesis of longer isoprenoid compounds could be due to an inability of the recombinant enzyme to terminate chain elongation at the GGPP step. As an alternative, the possibility was also considered that the long chain polyprenyl diphosphates synthesized could serve as precursors of the Q side chains. The synthesis of Q, in turn, could be related to an increase in mitochondrial function or to a role of Q as antioxidant during the infection of macrophages, the target cells in natural ASFV infection, to prevent oxidative damage to viral components since these cells generate large amounts of reactive oxygen species for their microbicidal functions. To obtain further information on the natural products of the ASFVtrans-prenyltransferase and on its function during the infectious cycle, we have examined, in this study, the subcellular localization of the viral enzyme and its activity in extracts from infected cells. Expression of the trans-prenyltransferase in a recombinant Sindbis virus has allowed us to demonstrate its targeting to the ER, a result that is consistent with the presence of a transmembrane domain in the protein. On the other hand, in cells infected with ASFV, the enzyme is found in the cytoplasmic viral assembly sites, associated with membrane structures that are precursors of the viral inner envelope and are derived from the ER (24Rouiller I. Brookes S.M. Hyatt A.D. Windsor M. Wileman T. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2373-2387Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Andrés G. Garcı́a-Escudero R. Simón-Mateo C. Viñuela E. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8988-9001Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Andrés G. Simón-Mateo C. Viñuela E. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2331-2341Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that in ASFV-infected cells, the enzyme is synthesized within the viral factories, being thus directed to the precursor viral membranes of the assembly areas or to nearby ER membranes, which would then be rapidly incorporated into the factories to form the viral membranes. During the maturation process of the virus particles from these membranes, the trans-prenyltransferase must be excluded from them since it is not found in the mature virions. The enzyme present in membrane preparations from cells infected with ASFV or with the recombinant Sindbis virus expressing the ASFV gene catalyzes predominantly the synthesis of all-trans-GGPP, with little further elongation to longer chain polyprenyl diphosphates, in contrast to the results obtained in the case of the recombinant enzyme expressed in E. coli. Although this difference could reflect a better control of polymerization by the membrane-associated enzyme, the fact that the pattern of isoprenoid distribution is not altered by the presence of detergent suggests that an integral membrane structure is not required to determine the specificity of products. It is possible that other factors might influence chain polymerization. On the other hand, the finding that the formation of GGPP by the membrane fraction of ASFV-infected cells is greatly increased with respect to that of mock-infected cells, whereas the synthesis of the C50 precursor of Q remains essentially unchanged, strongly supports that the natural product of the ASFV enzyme is all-trans-GGPP, allowing its classification as atrans-GGPP synthase. However, two features of the viral enzyme distinguish it from the cellular trans-GGPP synthases. Thus, the cellular enzymes are cytosolic proteins (17Reed B.C. Rilling H.C.

Chem. 1993; 268: 832-838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and strictly control chain termination at the GGPP step (15Hugueney P. Camara B. FEBS Lett. 1990; 273: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 16Sagami H. Morita Y. Ogura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20561-20566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the ASFV trans-GGPP synthase is an integral membrane protein and elongates to some extent the GGPP product, even when assayed in a membrane-associated form. As mentioned above, GGPP synthesized by the ASFVtrans-prenyltransferase could serve as substrate for prenylation of cellular or viral proteins. The synthesis of the enzyme at the late stage of infection and its localization in precursor viral membranes within the viral factories are consistent with the view that this modification might be required in the morphogenetic processes of the virus, as has been described for hepatitis δ virus and murine leukemia virus (8Glenn J.S. Watson J.A. Havel C.M. White J.M. Science. 1992; 256: 1331-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 9Hwang S.B. Lai M.M.C. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 7659-7662Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Overmeyer J.H. Maltese W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22686-22692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Lee C.-Z. Chen P.-J. Lai M.M.C. Chen D.-S. Virology. 1994; 199: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In the first case, it has been shown that the large antigen of the virus is farnesylated (34Otto J.C. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4569-4572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and that this modification facilitates virion assembly (8Glenn J.S. Watson J.A. Havel C.M. White J.M. Science. 1992; 256: 1331-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 9Hwang S.B. Lai M.M.C. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 7659-7662Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Lee C.-Z. Chen P.-J. Lai M.M.C. Chen D.-S. Virology. 1994; 199: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the studies with murine leukemia virus indicate that prenylation of cellular Rab proteins is required for the processing and incorporation of viral envelope precursors into the virions (10Overmeyer J.H. Maltese W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22686-22692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We are presently examining whether viral or cellular proteins are prenylated during the ASFV infectious cycle. A possible candidate to be modified by prenylation is the viral protein encoded by the open reading frameL83L, which contains a carboxyl-terminal CTIL type I geranylgeranylation motif (35Yáñez R.J. Rodrı́guez J.M. Nogal M.L. Yuste L. Enrı́quez C. Rodriguez J.F. Viñuela E. Virology. 1995; 208: 249-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) and is transcribed at a late time of infection.2 The use of drugs known to interfere with the prenylation of proteins may also help to understand the role, if any, of protein prenylation during the infectious cycle. Attempts to construct ASFV recombinants depleted of thetrans-prenyltransferase gene have failed,2suggesting that the gene is essential for virus multiplication. A system for inducible gene expression from ASFV recombinants, recently developed in our laboratory (36Garcı́a-Escudero R. Andrés G. Almazán F. Viñuela E. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 3185-3195Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), might be useful to investigate the role of the trans-prenyltransferase during virus replication. The association with membranes of the ASFV enzyme is intriguing in view of the fact that the cellular trans-GGPP synthases have been described as cytosolic proteins. Recent studies on the mammalian protein farnesyltransferase provide clues to the possible physiological significance of that association. Thus, it has been shown that product release is the rate-limiting step in catalysis (37Furfine E.S. Leban J.J. Landavazo A. Moomaw J.F. Casey P.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6857-6862Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) and that dissociation of the product from the enzyme requires the provision of additional FPP substrate (38Tschantz W.R. Furfine E.S. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9989-9993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the farnesyltransferase-product complex is directed to a membrane compartment where FPP would be located, thus triggering the release of the farnesylated protein (38Tschantz W.R. Furfine E.S. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9989-9993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In a similar fashion, GGPP generated by the membrane-bound trans-prenyltransferase of ASFV might efficiently promote the dissociation of geranylgeranyltransferase-product complexes targeted to the viral membranes in the factories. This could facilitate the prenylation of proteins playing a role in the virus replication cycle. We thank J. Salas for critical reading of the manuscript."
