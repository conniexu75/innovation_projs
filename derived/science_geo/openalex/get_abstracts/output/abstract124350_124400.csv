https://openalex.org/W2002454928,"Meiotic recombination in S. cerevisiae is initiated by double-strand breaks (DSBs). In certain mutants, breaks accumulate with a covalently attached protein, suggesting that cleavage is catalyzed by the DSB-associated protein via a topoisomerase-like transesterase mechanism. We have purified these protein–DNA complexes and identified the protein as Spo11, one of several proteins required for DSB formation. These findings strongly implicate Spo11 as the catalytic subunit of the meiotic DNA cleavage activity. This is the first identification of a biochemical function for any of the gene products involved in DSB formation. Spo11 defines a protein family with other members in fission yeast, nematodes, and archaebacteria. The S. pombe homolog, rec12p, is also known to be required for meiotic recombination. Thus, these findings provide direct evidence that the mechanism of meiotic recombination initiation is evolutionarily conserved."
https://openalex.org/W1995470989,"MeCP2 is an abundant mammalian protein that binds to methylated CpG. We have found that native and recombinant MeCP2 repress transcription in vitro from methylated promoters but do not repress nonmethylated promoters. Repression is nonlinearly dependent on the local density of methylation, becoming significant at the density found in bulk vertebrate genomic DNA. Transient transfection using fusions with the GAL4 DNA binding domain identified a region of MeCP2 that is capable of long-range repression in vivo. Moreover, MeCP2 is able to displace histone H1 from preassembled chromatin that contains methyl-CpG. These properties, together with the abundance of MeCP2 and the high frequency of its 2 bp binding site, suggest a role as a global transcriptional repressor in vertebrate genomes."
https://openalex.org/W2097098774,"A human bronchial xenograft model was used to characterize the molecular basis for the previously described defect in bacterial killing that is present in the cystic fibrosis (CF) lung. Airway surface fluid from CF grafts contained abnormally high NaCl and failed to kill bacteria, defects that were corrected with adenoviral vectors. A full-length clone for the only known human β-defensin (i.e., hBD-1) was isolated. This gene is expressed throughout the respiratory epithelia of non-CF and CF lungs, and its protein product shows salt-dependent antimicrobial activity to P. aeruginosa. Antisense oligonucleotides to hBD-1 ablated the antimicrobial activity in airway surface fluid from non-CF grafts. These data suggest that hBD-1 plays an important role in innate immunity that is compromised in CF by its salt-dependent inactivation."

https://openalex.org/W2068671266,"MLP is a LIM-only protein of terminally differentiated striated muscle cells, where it accumulates at actin-based structures involved in cytoarchitecture organization. To assess its role in muscle differentiation, we disrupted the MLP gene in mice. MLP (-/-) mice developed dilated cardiomyopathy with hypertrophy and heart failure after birth. Ultrastructural analysis revealed dramatic disruption of cardiomyocyte cytoarchitecture. At birth, these hearts were not hypertrophic, but already abnormally soft, with cell-autonomous and MLP-sensitive alterations in cytoarchitecture. Thus, MLP promotes proper cardiomyocyte cytoarchitecture, whose perturbation can lead to dilated cardiomyopathy. In vivo analysis revealed that MLP-deficient mice reproduce the morphological and clinical picture of dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure in humans, providing the first model for this condition in a genetically manipulatable organism."

https://openalex.org/W2121664015,"Both cyclin D1 and estrogens have an essential role in regulating proliferation of breast epithelial cells. We show here a novel role for cyclin D1 in growth regulation of estrogen-responsive tissues by potentiating transcription of estrogen receptor-regulated genes. Cyclin D1 mediates this activation independent of complex formation to a CDK partner. Cyclin D1 activates estrogen receptor-mediated transcription in the absence of estrogen and enhances transcription in its presence. The activation of estrogen receptor by cyclin D1 is not inhibited by anti-estrogens. A direct physical binding of cyclin D1 to the hormone binding domain of the estrogen receptor results in an increased binding of the receptor to estrogen response element sequences, and upregulates estrogen receptor-mediated transcription. These results highlight a novel role for cyclin D1 as a CDK-independent activator of the estrogen receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2083547817,"NIDDM is a polygenic disease characterized by insulin resistance in muscle, fat, and liver, followed by a failure of pancreatic β cells to adequately compensate for this resistance despite increased insulin secretion. Mice double heterozygous for null alleles in the insulin receptor and insulin receptor substrate-1 genes exhibit the expected ∼50% reduction in expression of these two proteins, but a synergism at a level of insulin resistance with 5- to 50-fold elevated plasma insulin levels and comparable levels of β cell hyperplasia. At 4–6 months of age, 40% of these double heterozygotes become overtly diabetic. This NIDDM mouse model in which diabetes arises in an age-dependent manner from the interaction between two genetically determined, subclinical defects in the insulin signaling cascade demonstrates the role of epistatic interactions in the pathogenesis of common diseases with non-Mendelian genetics."

https://openalex.org/W2079892535,"Rapid modulation of ligand binding affinity (“activation”) is a central property of the integrin cell adhesion receptors. Using a screen for suppressors of integrin activation, we identified the small GTP-binding protein, H-Ras, and its effector kinase, Raf-1, as negative regulators of integrin activation. H-Ras inhibited the activation of integrins with three distinct α and β subunit cytoplasmic domains. Suppression was not associated with integrin phosphorylation and was independent of both mRNA transcription and protein synthesis. Furthermore, suppression correlated with activation of the ERK MAP kinase pathway. Thus, regulation of integrin affinity state is a novel, transcription-independent function of a Ras-linked MAP kinase pathway that may mediate a negative feedback loop in integrin function."

https://openalex.org/W2101436406,"Ca2+ channel beta subunits regulate voltage-dependent calcium currents through direct interaction with alpha 1 subunits. The beta- and alpha 1-binding motifs are conserved, and all beta subunits can stimulate current amplitude, voltage dependence, and kinetics when coexpressed with various alpha 1 subunits. We used a positional candidate approach to determine that the ataxia and seizures in the lethargic (lh) mouse arise from mutation of the beta-subunit gene Cchb4 on mouse chromosome 2. A four-nucleotide insertion into a splice donor site results in exon skipping, translational frameshift, and protein truncation with loss of the alpha 1-binding site. The lethargic phenotype is the first example of a mammalian neurological disease caused by an inherited defect in a non-pore-forming subunit of a voltage-gated ion channel."
https://openalex.org/W2067538132,"To explore regulation of potentially lethal responses to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), we used differential display under LPS-free conditions to compare macrophage cell lines from two strains of mice congenic for a locus affecting LPS sensitivity. LPS- hyporesponsive cells, primary macrophages, and polymorphonuclear leukocytes transcribed secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI), a known epithelial cell-derived inhibitor of leukocyte serine proteases. Transfection of macrophages with SLPI suppressed LPS-induced activation of NF-κB and production of nitric oxide and TNFα. The ability of interferon-γ (IFNγ) to restore LPS responsiveness is a hallmark of the LPS-hyporesponsive phenotype. IFNγ suppressed expression of SLPI and restored LPS responsiveness to SLPI-producing cells. Thus, SLPI is an LPS-induced IFNγ-suppressible phagocyte product that serves to inhibit LPS responses."
https://openalex.org/W1978909186,"We present data indicating that a host protein is important for function of HIV-1 preintegration complexes (PICs) in vitro. PICs partially purified from infected cells were subjected to gel filtration in 600 mM KCl, which removed a factor required for integration without fully disrupting PICs. Addition of an extract from uninfected cells restored activity. Fractionation of the complementing activity yielded HMG I(Y), a nonhistone chromosomal protein important for transcriptional control and chromosomal architecture. Complementing activity could be isolated from PICs, and activity could be depleted from such fractions with an antibody against HMG I(Y). Recombinant HMG I(Y) also complemented salt-stripped complexes. The finding that a host protein is required for integration by HIV PICs parallels findings in several well-studied transposition and site-specific recombination systems."

https://openalex.org/W2068153867,"A 36-kDa β-galactoside mammalian lectin protein, designated as galectin-9, was isolated from mouse embryonic kidney by using a degenerate primer polymerase chain reaction and cloning strategy. Its deduced amino acid sequence had the characteristic conserved sequence motif of galectins. Endogenous galectin-9, extracted from liver and thymus, as well as recombinant galectin-9 exhibited specific binding activity for the lactosyl group. It had two distinct N- and C-terminal carbohydrate-binding domains connected by a link peptide, with no homology to any other protein. Galectin-9 had an alternate splicing isoform, exclusively expressed in the small intestine with a 31-amino acid insertion between the N-terminal domain and link peptide. Sequence homology analysis revealed that the C-terminal carbohydrate-binding domain of mouse galectin-9 had extensive similarity to that of monomeric rat galectin-5. The presence of galectin-5 in the mouse could not be demonstrated by polymerase chain reaction or by Northern or Southern blot genomic DNA analyses. Sequence comparison of rat galectin-5 and rat galectin-9 cDNA did not reveal identical nucleotide sequences in the overlapping C-terminal carbohydrate-binding domain, indicating that galectin-9 is not an alternative splicing isoform of galectin-5. However, galectin-9 had a sequence identical with that of its intestinal isoform in the overlapping regions in both species. Southern blot genomic DNA analyses, using the galectin-9 specific probe derived from the N-terminal carbohydrate-binding domain, indicated the presence of a novel gene encoding galectin-9 in both mice and rats. In contrast to galectin-5, which is mainly expressed in erythrocytes, galectin-9 was found to be widely distributed, i.e. in liver, small intestine, thymus > kidney, spleen, lung, cardiac and skeletal muscle > reticulocyte, brain. Collectively, these data indicate that galectin-9 is a new member of the galectin gene family and has a unique intestinal isoform.

https://openalex.org/W2071468845,"The Saccharomyces cerevisiae phosphatidylinositol kinase homolog TOR2 is required for organization of the actin cytoskeleton. Overexpression of RHO1 or RHO2, encoding Rho-like GTPases, or ROM2, encoding a GDP/GTP exchange factor for RHO1 and RHO2, suppresses a tor2 mutation. Deletion of SAC7, a gene originally identified as a suppressor of an actin mutation, also suppresses a tor2 mutation. SAC7 is a novel GTPase-activating protein for RHO1. ROM2 exchange activity is reduced in a tor2 mutant, and overexpression of ROM2 lacking its PH domain can no longer suppress a tor2 mutation. Thus, TOR2 signals to the actin cytoskeleton through a GTPase switch composed of RHO1, RHO2, ROM2, and SAC7. TOR2 activates this switch via ROM2, possibly via the ROM2 PH domain."
https://openalex.org/W2082753765,"The Drosophila roX1 gene is X-linked and produces RNAs that are male-specific, somatic, and preferentially expressed in the central nervous system. These RNAs are retained in the nucleus and lack any significant open reading frame. Although all sexually dimorphic characteristics in Drosophila were thought to be controlled by the sex determination pathway through the gene transformer (tra), the expression of roX1 is independent of tra activity. Instead, the dosage compensation system is necessary and sufficient for the expression of roX1. Consistent with a potential function in dosage compensation, roX1 RNAs localize specifically to the male X chromosome. This localization occurs even when roX1 RNAs are expressed from autosomal locations in X-to-autosome translocations. The novel regulation and subnuclear localization of roX1 RNAs makes them candidates for an RNA component of the dosage compensation machinery."
https://openalex.org/W1985848626,"Mitotic gene conversion acting as reverse mutation has not been previously demonstrated in human. We report here that the revertant mosaicism of a compound heterozygous proband with an autosomal recessive genodermatosis, generalized atrophic benign epidermolysis bullosa, is caused by mitotic gene conversion of one of the two mutated COL17A1 alleles. Specifically, the maternal allele surrounding the mutation site on COL17A1 (1706delA) showed reversion of the mutation and loss of heterozygosity along a tract of at least 381 bp in revertant keratinocytes derived from clinically unaffected skin patches; the paternal mutation (R1226X) remained present in all cell samples. Revertant mosaicism represents a way of natural gene therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2080183231,"The Origin Recognition Complex (ORC) is a six-protein assembly that specifies the sites of DNA replication initiation in S. cerevisiae. Origin recognition by ORC requires ATP. Here, we demonstrate that two subunits, Orc1p and Orc5p, bind ATP and that Orc1p also hydrolyzes ATP. ATP binding and hydrolysis by Orc1p are both regulated by origin DNA in a sequence-specific manner. ATP binding to Orc1p, but not ATP hydrolysis, is responsible for the ATP dependence of the ORC–origin interaction, indicating that ATP is a cofactor that locks ORC on origin DNA. These data demonstrate that occupancy of the Orc1p ATP–binding site has a profound effect on ORC function and that ATP hydrolysis by Orc1p has the potential to drive transitions between different functional states of ORC."
https://openalex.org/W1985223807,"We have identified two genes, roX1 and roX2, whose expression in the adult fly is restricted to neurons of males. The two genes reside on the X chromosome, and each encodes an RNA with no apparent open reading frame. Both genes are physically linked to female-specific genes that encode proteins expressed in the ovary: opt1, a novel peptide transporter, and nod, a member of the kinesin family. The male-specific transcripts are positively regulated by the dosage compensation pathway in an all-or-none fashion. Our data suggest that the multimeric complex of dosage compensation proteins may operate in different ways on different sets of X-linked genes."
https://openalex.org/W2086607314,"Fragile sites are nonstaining gaps in chromosomes induced by specific tissue culture conditions. They vary both in population frequency and in the culture conditions required for induction. Folate-sensitive fragile sites are due to expansion of p(CCG)n trinucleotide repeats; however, the relationship between sequence composition and the chemistry of induction of fragile sites is unclear. To clarify this relationship, the distamycin A–sensitive fragile site FRA16B was isolated by positional cloning and found to be an expanded 33 bp AT-rich minisatellite repeat, p(ATATA TTATATATTATATCTAATAATATATC/ATA)n (consistent with DNA sequence binding preferences of chemicals that induce its cytogenetic expression). Therefore the mutation mechanism associated with trinucleotide repeats is also a property of minisatellite repeats (variable number tandem repeats)."
https://openalex.org/W1995954197,"Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are zinc-containing proteinases that participate in tissue remodeling under physiological and pathological conditions. To test the involvement of bacterial proteinases in tissue injury during bacterial infections, we investigated the activation potential of various bacterial proteinases against precursors of MMPs (proMMPs) purified from human neutrophils (proMMP-8 and −9) and from human fibrosarcoma cells (proMMP-1). Each proMMP was subjected to treatment with a series of bacterial proteinases at molar ratios of 0.01-0.1 (bacterial proteinase to proMMP), and activities of MMPs generated were determined. Among six different bacterial proteinases, thermolysin family enzymes (family M4) such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa elastase, Vibrio cholerae proteinase, and thermolysin strongly activated all three proMMPs via limited proteolysis to generate active forms of the MMPs. N-terminal sequence analysis of the active MMPs revealed that cleavage occurred at the Val82-Leu83 and Thr90-Phe91 bonds of proMMP-1 and proMMP-9, respectively, which are located near the N terminus of the catalytic domain of MMPs. In contrast, Serratia 56-kDa proteinase and Pseudomonas alkaline proteinase, both of which are classified as members of the serralysin subfamily of zinc metalloproteinases (family M10), and Serratia 73-kDa thiol proteinase did not evidence proteolytic processing or activation of proMMP-1, −8, and −9 under these experimental conditions. These results indicate that bacterial proteinases may play an important role in tissue destruction and disintegration of extracellular matrix at the site of infections.

INTRODUCTIONCollagen, one of the major structural components of the extracellular matrix, has a triple-helical structure and exhibits resistance to proteolytic cleavage by endogenous and exogenous proteinases (1Harris Jr., A.J.

Bacterial proteinases have been suggested to mediate direct tissue destruction, resulting in impairment of host defense mechanisms in septic foci (2Maeda H. Molla A. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1989; 185: 357-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 3Hase C.C. Finkelstein R.A. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 823-837Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Travis J. Potempa J. Maeda H. Trends Microbiol. 1995; 3: 405-407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Most bacterial proteinases, however, have weak degradative activity against collagen (1Harris Jr., A.J.

Infect. Immun. 1986; 53: 522-529Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the mechanism of extracellular matrix destruction at the site of bacterial infection is poorly understood.MMPs, a family of zinc neutral endopeptidases, are secreted by a variety of cells as inactive precursors (proMMPs) and degrade a series of collagens (6Grant G.A. Goldberg G.I. Wilhelm S.M. He C. Eisen A.Z. Matrix. 1992; : 217-223PubMed Google Scholar). Two distinct proMMPs (proMMP-8 and neutrophil progelatinase, proMMP-9) are synthesized and secreted extracellularly from specific granules of human neutrophils after membrane stimulation (7Weiss S.J. Peppin G. Ortiz X. Ragsdale C. Test S.T. Science. 1985; 227: 747-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 8Desrochers P.E. Mookhtiar K. Van Wart H.E. Hasty K.A. Weiss S.J. J. Biol.

Greer P.K. Niedel J.E. Arthritis Rheum. 1989; 32: 1539-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar–12Saarialho-Kere U.K. Welgus H.G. Parks W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17354-17361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MMP-8 and −1 specifically cleave native triple-helical type I collagen into two major fragments, one-fourth and three-fourths the size of native collagen, respectively (13Knauper V. Kramer S. Reinke H. Tschesche H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 189: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). MMP-9 and other endogenous proteinases subsequently hydrolyze and degrade these fragments or denatured collagens, e.g. gelatin, into smaller peptidyl fragments.The proteolysis of extracellular matrix seems to be a key initiating event for progression of the inflammatory process, and thus conversion of proMMPs to their active forms is a crucial step in the destruction and remodeling of the extracellular matrix. Activation can be achieved in vitro by endogenous proteinases such as trypsin, chymotrypsin, cathepsin G, and plasmin, or by other chemicals including organomercurial compounds, SH-modifying agents, and various reactive oxygen species (14Van Wart H.E. Birkedal-Hansen H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5578-5582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1192) Google Scholar). However, the detailed mechanism of activation of proMMPs in vivo, particularly in bacterial infections, remains to be defined.To explore the possibility that bacterial proteinases may participate in extracellular matrix destruction by activating the proMMPs, we examined the activating potential of various bacterial proteinases against three different types of purified human proMMPs, i.e. MMP-1 from HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cells and MMP-8 and MMP-9 from human neutrophils.DISCUSSIONA series of MMPs secreted from connective tissue cells and inflammatory cells play an important role in degradation and remolding of extracellular matrixes under physiological and pathological conditions (6Grant G.A.

These MMPs are discharged as inactive precursors (proMMPs), and a specific activation process outside the cells is prerequisite for expression of their proteolytic activity against extracellular matrixes, e.g. collagen and gelatin (6Grant G.A. Goldberg G.I. Wilhelm S.M. He C. Eisen A.Z. Matrix. 1992; : 217-223PubMed Google Scholar). ProMMPs consist of three discernible structures, referred to as the propeptide domain, the zinc-binding catalytic domain, and the homopexin-like C-terminal domain (Fig. 8) (6Grant G.A. Goldberg G.I. Wilhelm S.M. He C. Eisen A.Z. Matrix. 1992; : 217-223PubMed Google Scholar). The propeptide domain contains a polypeptide segment PRCGVPD, which is highly conserved in all members of the MMP family and is most directly affected during their activation (14Van Wart H.E. Birkedal-Hansen H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5578-5582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1192) Google Scholar).The key event in activation of proMMPs is removal of this propeptide domain, consisting of approximately 80 amino acid residues (37Nagase H. Enghild J.J. Suzuki K. Salvesen G. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5783-5789Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). A zinc atom in the active site of the enzyme is complexed via a cysteine residue in the conserved PRCGVPD region, which confers preservation of the enzyme activity, and dissociation of a coordinate binding of the cysteine thiolate moiety and a zinc atom is assumed to be the crucial step in the activation of proMMPs (the cysteine switch activation mechanism) (9Springman E.B.

However, the mechanism of modulation of the extracellular matrix by exogenous proteinases, particularly bacterial proteinases, remains obscure.The study of bacterial proteinases has led us to better understanding of the pathogenesis of bacterial infection. The importance of bacterial proteinases in determining the virulence of pathogenic bacteria has been indicated by a number of biochemical characteristics of bacterial proteinases, such as bradykinin-generating potential (2Maeda H.

Suga M. Ijiri S. Ando M. Maeda H. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 40: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This suggested to us that extracellular proteinases produced by pathogenic microbes may induce disintegration of the tissue via direct degradation of the extracellular matrix (47Heck L.W. Morihara K. McRae W.B. Miller E.J. Infect. Immun. 1986; 51: 115-118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 48Jackson R.J. Dao M.L. Lim D.V. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 5647-5651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Collagen, the major component of extracellular matrix, however, is resistant to proteolytic attack by nonspecific proteinases (1Harris Jr., A.J. Cartwright E.C. Barrett A.J. Proteinases in Mammalian Cells and Tissues. North-Holland Publishing Co., Amsterdam1977: 249-283Google Scholar). Although specific cleavage of type III and IV collagens was reported for Pseudomonas elastase (47Heck L.W. Morihara K. McRae W.B. Miller E.J. Infect. Immun. 1986; 51: 115-118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), other types of collagen such as types I, II, and V are generally resistant to bacterial proteinases (5Molla A. Matsumoto K. Oyamada I. Katsuki T. Maeda H. Infect. Immun. 1986; 53: 522-529Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 47Heck L.W. Morihara K. McRae W.B. Miller E.J. Infect. Immun. 1986; 51: 115-118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Preliminary studies indicated that human corneal proMMP-2 and fibroblast interstitial procollagenase could be activated by Pseudomonas elastase or Porphyromonas proteinases (49Matsumoto K. Shams N.B.K. Hanninen L.A. Kenyon K.R. Curr. Eye Res. 1992; 11: 1105-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 50Sorsa T. Ingman T. Suomalainen K. Haapasalo M. Konttinen Y.T. Lindy O. Saari H. Uitto V.J. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 4491-4495Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Conclusive evidence on the activation of proMMPs is, however, not yet available. In this context, of considerable importance was our observation that three different types of human proMMPs (proMMP-1, −8, and −9) were activated by bacterial proteinases via limited proteolysis of the zymogens. Among the six bacterial proteinases tested in the present study, P. aeruginosa elastase, V. cholerae proteinase, and thermolysin showed strong activation of the proMMPs. Pseudomonas elastase, Vibrio proteinase, and thermolysin are metalloproteinases and possess more than 70% amino acid homology (51Hase C.C. Finkelstein R.A. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 4011-4015Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 52Morihara K. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 242-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 53Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 183-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). These bacterial proteinases belong to the thermolysin family M4 as defined by their zinc-binding motif (clan MA) (53Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 183-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). It is important to note that our present finding is the first documentation showing that proMMPs can be activated by metalloproteinases of the thermolysin family.Accumulated evidence indicates that proMMP-1 is converted to an active MMP-1 proteolytically by trypsin-like proteinases. It is proposed that the initial proteolytic cleavage of the “bait region” of proMMP-1 (Gln33-Lys-Arg-Arg-Asn37) is required for activation; the intermediate forms generated are further processed by autolysis to form the fully active enzyme, i.e. there is a stepwise activation mechanism for proMMPs (31Suzuki K. Lees M. Newlands G.F. Nagase H. Woolley D.E. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 37Nagase H. Enghild J.J. Suzuki K. Salvesen G. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5783-5789Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar).Because of the different substrate specificities of the trypsin-like proteinases and the thermolysin family enzymes (53Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 183-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar, 54Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 205-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar), it is not likely that thermolysin-like metalloproteinases preferentially hydrolyze the bait region of the proMMP. In fact, these thermolysin-type enzymes activate proMMPs via proteolytic processing at the Val82-Leu83 bond for proMMP-1 and at the Thr90-Phe91 bond for proMMP-9, which are distinct cleavage sites for other proteinases (trypsin, plasmin, stromelysin, and matrilysin) and for PCMB, as reported earlier and in this paper (6Grant G.A. Goldberg G.I. Wilhelm S.M. He C. Eisen A.Z. Matrix. 1992; : 217-223PubMed Google Scholar, 33Shapiro S.D. Fliszar C.J. Broekelmann T.J. Mecham R.P. Senior R.M. Welgus H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6351-6356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that thermolysin-type enzymes such as Pseudomonas elastase and Vibrio proteinase directly affect the N-terminal region of the catalytic domain of the proMMPs.In contrast, Serratia 56-kDa metalloproteinase and Pseudomonas alkaline proteinase, both of which are classified as members of the serralysin subfamily of family M10 by their zinc-binding motif (clan MB) (53Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 183-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar), and Serratia 73-kDa proteinase show no appreciable activation of the proMMPs tested. Treatment of the proMMPs with these bacterial proteinases did not produce any apparent proteolytic processing of proMMPs, at least under our experimental conditions (molar ratios of bacterial proteinase to proMMP: 0.01 to 1.0).These results indicate that bacterial proteinases of the thermolysin family exhibit potent activation of proMMPs through a unique and specific mode of proteolytic action. Also, it seems that proMMPs are not necessarily vulnerable to all exogenous bacterial proteinases, in view of the proteolytic activation of zymogens.The thermolysin family of metalloproteinases comprises a wide range of proteinases originating from various species of bacteria such as Staphylococcus, Legionella, Listeria, Erwinia, Pseudomonas, Vibrio, and Serratia (53Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 183-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar), many of which are well recognized as important pathogenic bacteria. We suggest that some bacterial proteinases possessing MMP-activating potential may play a crucial role in tissue injury and remodeling of the extracellular matrix in bacterial infections. Moreover, it is well established that bacterial proteinases display diverse pathological functions in the pathogenesis of bacterial infection, e.g. triggering of the bradykinin-generating cascade (2Maeda H.

Therefore, in addition to these pathogenic features of bacteria proteinases, activation of proMMPs by bacterial proteinases will provide new insight into the molecular pathogenesis of bacterial infections involving bacterial proteinases. INTRODUCTIONCollagen, one of the major structural components of the extracellular matrix, has a triple-helical structure and exhibits resistance to proteolytic cleavage by endogenous and exogenous proteinases (1Harris Jr., A.J.

Bacterial proteinases have been suggested to mediate direct tissue destruction, resulting in impairment of host defense mechanisms in septic foci (2Maeda H. Molla A. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1989; 185: 357-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 3Hase C.C. Finkelstein R.A. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 823-837Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Travis J. Potempa J. Maeda H. Trends Microbiol. 1995; 3: 405-407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Most bacterial proteinases, however, have weak degradative activity against collagen (1Harris Jr., A.J. Cartwright E.C. Barrett A.J. Proteinases in Mammalian Cells and Tissues. North-Holland Publishing Co., Amsterdam1977: 249-283Google Scholar, 5Molla A. Matsumoto K. Oyamada I. Katsuki T. Maeda H. Infect. Immun. 1986; 53: 522-529Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the mechanism of extracellular matrix destruction at the site of bacterial infection is poorly understood.MMPs, a family of zinc neutral endopeptidases, are secreted by a variety of cells as inactive precursors (proMMPs) and degrade a series of collagens (6Grant G.A. Goldberg G.I. Wilhelm S.M. He C. Eisen A.Z. Matrix. 1992; : 217-223PubMed Google Scholar). Two distinct proMMPs (proMMP-8 and neutrophil progelatinase, proMMP-9) are synthesized and secreted extracellularly from specific granules of human neutrophils after membrane stimulation (7Weiss S.J. Peppin G. Ortiz X. Ragsdale C. Test S.T. Science. 1985; 227: 747-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 8Desrochers P.E. Mookhtiar K. Van Wart H.E. Hasty K.A. Weiss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5005-5012Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Macrophages and fibroblasts produce interstitial procollagenase (proMMP-1) (6Grant G.A. Goldberg G.I. Wilhelm S.M. He C. Eisen A.Z. Matrix. 1992; : 217-223PubMed Google Scholar, 9Springman E.B. Angleton E.L. Birkedal-Hansen H. Wart H.E.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar) and 92-kDa progelatinase (proMMP-9), whose expressions vary constitutively or inducibly after stimulation with proinflammatory cytokines and lipopolysaccharide (10McCachren S.S. Greer P.K. Niedel J.E. Arthritis Rheum. 1989; 32: 1539-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar–12Saarialho-Kere U.K. Welgus H.G. Parks W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17354-17361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MMP-8 and −1 specifically cleave native triple-helical type I collagen into two major fragments, one-fourth and three-fourths the size of native collagen, respectively (13Knauper V. Kramer S. Reinke H. Tschesche H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 189: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). MMP-9 and other endogenous proteinases subsequently hydrolyze and degrade these fragments or denatured collagens, e.g. gelatin, into smaller peptidyl fragments.The proteolysis of extracellular matrix seems to be a key initiating event for progression of the inflammatory process, and thus conversion of proMMPs to their active forms is a crucial step in the destruction and remodeling of the extracellular matrix. Activation can be achieved in vitro by endogenous proteinases such as trypsin, chymotrypsin, cathepsin G, and plasmin, or by other chemicals including organomercurial compounds, SH-modifying agents, and various reactive oxygen species (14Van Wart H.E. Birkedal-Hansen H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5578-5582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1192) Google Scholar). However, the detailed mechanism of activation of proMMPs in vivo, particularly in bacterial infections, remains to be defined.To explore the possibility that bacterial proteinases may participate in extracellular matrix destruction by activating the proMMPs, we examined the activating potential of various bacterial proteinases against three different types of purified human proMMPs, i.e. MMP-1 from HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cells and MMP-8 and MMP-9 from human neutrophils. Collagen, one of the major structural components of the extracellular matrix, has a triple-helical structure and exhibits resistance to proteolytic cleavage by endogenous and exogenous proteinases (1Harris Jr., A.J.

The recombination events are revealed by the molecular colony technique that allows single RNA molecules to be cloned in vitro. The observed nonhomologous recombinations are entirely dependent on the 3′ hydroxyl group of the 5′ fragment, and are due to a splicing-like reaction in which RNA secondary structure guides the attack of this 3′ hydroxyl on phosphoester bonds within the 3′ fragment."

Effects of wild type p53 (wt-p53) re-expression were investigated in a human anaplastic thyroid carcinoma cell line (ARO) expressing a mutated p53. ARO cells were stably transfected with the temperature-sensitive p53 Val135 gene (ts-p53) which exhibits wild type-like activity at 32°C. Exogenous wt-p53 function in ARO-tsp53 clones was assessed by evaluating its transcriptional activity on a CAT reporter vector containing p53 binding sites. At 32°C, a significant reduction in the proliferation rate (≈percnt;50%) was observed, with accumulation of cells in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. This effect was accompanied by induction of the expression of the growth inhibitor p21/Waf1 gene. At 32°C, ARO-tsp53 clones also showed a marked impairment of their tumorigenic potential. Furthermore, transfected clones re-acquired the ability to respond to thyrotropin (TSH) stimulation showing an increased expression of thyroid-specific genes (thyroglobulin, thyroperoxidase and TSH receptor). In conclusion, re-expression of wt-p53 activity in ARO cells, inhibits cell proliferation and restores responsiveness to physiological stimuli."

The transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions of IL-12Rβ1 or IL-12Rβ2 were fused to the extracellular domain of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor, yielding chimeric receptors E12R1 and E12R2, respectively. These chimeras were stably transfected into BaF3 cells, a factor-dependent murine pro-B cell line. Only E12R2 or E12R1+E12R2 transfectants were capable of EGF-dependent proliferation. EGF-dependent phosphorylation of E12R2, JAK2, Tyk2, and STAT3 was observed. JAK2 was phosphorylated in E12R1-, E12R2-, and E12R1+E12R2-expressing cells. However, direct associations were detectable only between E12R2 and JAK2. Tyk2 phosphorylation was observed only in cells expressing E12R1 or E12R1+E12R2. In parallel with this activation pattern, direct interactions only between Tyk2 and E12R1 were demonstrable. Phosphorylation of STAT3 was observed in cells expressing E12R1, E12R2, and E12R1+E12R2. The expression levels of STAT4 protein in BaF3 cells are undetectable by the methods employed here; therefore, STAT4 phosphorylation was not observed. Taken together, the data indicate that differential interactions take place between the cytoplasmic regions of the two IL-12R subunits and JAK2/Tyk2 and that the cytoplasmic region of IL-12Rβ2 alone is capable of delivering a proliferative signal."

https://openalex.org/W2083323577,"Membrane depolarization of PC12 cells using 50 mM KCl leads to induction of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) mRNA. This induction of TH mRNA is apparently due to increased TH gene promoter activity mediated by the influx of Ca2+. In PC12 cells transiently transfected with a chimeric gene expressing chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) driven by the proximal TH gene 5′-flanking region, 50 mM KCl increases TH gene promoter activity 3-4-fold. Promoter analysis utilizing TH-CAT constructs containing mutagenized sequences indicates that this response to the depolarization-mediated influx of Ca2+ is primarily dependent on both the TH cAMP-responsive element (CRE) and TH activating protein-1 (AP1) site. Minimal promoter constructs that contain a single copy of either the TH CRE or TH AP1 site fused upstream of the TH gene basal promoter are only modestly responsive or nonresponsive, respectively, to depolarization. However, both these constructs are strongly responsive to the calcium ionophore, A23187. Gel shift assays indicate that TH AP1 complex formation is dramatically increased after treatment with either 50 mM KCl or A23187. Using antibodies to transcription factors of the Fos and Jun families, we show that the nuclear proteins comprising the inducible TH AP1 complex include c-Fos, c-Jun, JunB, and JunD. In cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB)-deficient cell lines that express antisense RNA complementary to CREB mRNA, the response of the TH gene promoter to cyclic AMP is dramatically inhibited, but the response to A23187 remains robust. This result indicates that transcription factors other than CREB can participate in the Ca2+-mediated regulation of the TH gene. In summary, our results support the hypothesis that regulation of the TH gene by Ca2+ is mediated by mechanisms involving both the TH CRE and TH AP1 sites and that transcription factors other than or in addition to CREB participate in this response.

These results are consistent with the hypothesis that protein kinase A, protein kinase C, and glucocorticoid receptors participate in signaling pathways that regulate the TH gene.Treatments that lead to increased intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) also increase expression of the TH gene. Studies by Sabban and co-workers (14Kilbourne E.J. Sabban E.L. Mol. Brain. Res. 1990; 8: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 15Hiremagalur B. Nankova B. Nitahara J. Zeman R. Sabban E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23704-23711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that membrane depolarization or agonist occupation of nicotinic cholinergic receptors leads to the induction of TH mRNA in PC12 cells. Both of these treatments lead to Ca2+ influx through voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels. Furthermore, chelation of extracellular Ca2+ with EGTA inhibits the depolarization-mediated increase in TH mRNA (14Kilbourne E.J. Sabban E.L. Mol. Brain. Res. 1990; 8: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the influx of Ca2+ plays an important role in regulating TH gene expression.A number of studies have been conducted in order to understand the mechanisms that mediate Ca2+- dependent regulation of different genes. Ca2+ influx elicited by either membrane depolarization or Ca2+ ionophore treatment activates and/or induces transcription factors, such as cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB) and c-Fos, in PC12 cells (16Greenberg M.E.

CREB and c-Fos interact with the promoter elements CRE and AP1, respectively, to transactivate expression of numerous genes (21Montminy M.R. Sevarino K.A. Wagner J.A. Mandel G. Goodman R.H. Proc.

Since the 5′-flanking region of the TH gene contains CRE and AP1 sites, it is reasonable to hypothesize that Ca2+ exerts its effects on TH gene transcription rate by influencing transcription factors that bind to these promoter elements. Kilbourne et al. (24Kilbourne E.J. Nankova B.B. Lewis E.J. McMahon A. Osaka H. Sabban D.B. Sabban E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7563-7569Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that a minimal promoter containing the TH CRE is responsive to Ca2+ influx in PC12 cells. Using deletion analysis, they have also reported that promoter elements upstream of the CRE do not apparently participate in the response of the TH gene promoter to Ca2+. Recently, these results have been extended using TH gene constructs with site-directed mutations (25Nankova B. Hiremagalur B. Menezes A. Zeman R. Sabban E. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 35: 164-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Results from these studies suggest that the TH AP1 site is not involved in Ca2+-mediated TH gene regulation. In contrast, deletion analysis by Stachowiak et al. (26Stachowiak M.K. Goc A. Hong J.S. Poisner A. Jiang H.K. Stachowiak E.K. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1994; 22: 309-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) has shown that the TH CRE is not required for activation of the TH gene promoter by Ca2+ influx in bovine adrenal chromaffin cells and that, by inference, promoter elements upstream of the CRE participate in this response. However, it is not clear from their study which promoter elements participate in this regulation.In the present study, we demonstrate that both the CRE and AP1 sites in the proximal 5′-flanking region of the rat TH gene participate in regulating TH gene expression by Ca2+ influx in PC12 cells. The newly identified TH CRE2 site does not apparently play a major role in this response. To further analyze the involvement of the TH AP1 site in Ca2+-mediated TH gene regulation, we have examined nuclear protein interactions at this site. Finally, we have tested the involvement of CREB in Ca2+-mediated TH gene regulation using PC12 cell-derived CREB-deficient cell lines. Our results indicate that CREB is not required for Ca2+- dependent regulation of the TH gene, supporting the hypothesis that multiple promoter elements are involved in regulation of the TH gene promoter in response to Ca2+ influx.DISCUSSIONMembrane depolarization of excitable cells and the consequent influx of Ca2+ leads to modulation of a number of intracellular events, including changes in transcription rates of numerous genes. Mechanisms responsible for this gene regulation have been extensively studied, particularly with respect to the c-fos gene (19Sheng M. McFadden G. Greenberg M.E. Neuron. 1990; 4: 571-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar, 20Greenberg M.E. Thompson M.A. Sheng M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1992; 86: 99-108Google Scholar, 32Ginty D.D.

Chem. 1995; 270: 4224-4235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). These studies have identified a Ca2+-responsive element (CaRE) within the c-fos gene, which is strikingly similar to the consensus CRE. In addition, the increase in intracellular Ca2+ leads to activation of CREB by phosphorylation of its Ser-133 site (20Greenberg M.E. Thompson M.A. Sheng M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1992; 86: 99-108Google Scholar, 36Sheng M. Thompson M.A. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1991; 252: 1427-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (1274) Google Scholar). Therefore, it has been postulated that Ca2+ influx evoked by membrane depolarization increases c-fos gene expression via the CRE/CaRE following the phosphorylation of CREB. However, the critical importance of the CRE/CaRE and CREB activation in c-fos gene regulation is unclear, because 1) CREB phosphorylation by itself is not sufficient to increase c-fos gene expression in response to Ca2+ influx in protein kinase A-deficient cell lines (35Thompson M.A. Ginty D.D. Bonni A. Greenberg M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4224-4235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), and 2) c-fos gene sequences upstream of the CRE/CaRE also participate in the response to Ca2+ (34Misra R.P.

Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7563-7569Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have used deletion mutation analysis to show that the region from −60 to +27, which contains the consensus CRE core sequence, is as responsive to veratridine as the region from −773 to +27 in PC12 cells. The construct containing TH gene sequences from −41 to +27 was unresponsive. These authors have interpreted these data to support the participation of the TH CRE (at position −45 to −38) in this veratridine-mediated response. In addition, a construct, in which sequences from −209 to −193 (a region referred to as the FSE) are deleted from TH(−272/+27)-CAT, does not lose responsiveness to veratridine in PC12 cells. Since the TH AP1 site is found within this FSE region, it was concluded that this site does not participate in the response. However, other elements, such as AP2 (−220 to −213), E2A/MyoD (−194 to −189), and POU/Oct (−175 to −168), that may participate positively or negatively in regulating the TH gene are located adjacent to this region. The deletion of this FSE domain alters the normal spacing between these elements. In contrast, Stachowiak et al. (26Stachowiak M.K. Goc A. Hong J.S. Poisner A. Jiang H.K. Stachowiak E.K. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1994; 22: 309-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) have used deletion analysis of the bovine TH gene promoter to show that regions of the promoter upstream of the CRE are required for the response to veratridine in bovine adrenal chromaffin cells. These regions contain numerous candidate elements, including POU/Oct, SP1, and AP1 sites. From these previous deletion analyses, it is difficult to identify specific promoter elements involved in the response to depolarization, due to the deletion of large segments of the TH gene promoter in the TH-CAT constructs. Furthermore, these deletions alter the normal spacing of elements within the TH gene promoter and eliminate potential interactions between proximal and distal elements.In the present study, we have used a rat TH gene promoter construct similar to that used by Kilbourne et al. (24Kilbourne E.J. Nankova B.B. Lewis E.J. McMahon A. Osaka H. Sabban D.B. Sabban E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7563-7569Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); however, we have employed site-directed mutagenesis to knock out the function of specific sites within the promoter without altering the length of the promoter region. Using this approach, our results suggest that at least two promoter elements participate in the response to Ca2+ influx; these two elements are the CRE and AP1. This conclusion is strongly supported by the 70-80% decrease in response to depolarization, when either the CRE or AP1 site is mutagenized within the context of the intact TH gene promoter.The participation of the TH CRE is also supported by the results of the minimal promoter studies. Treatment of PC12 cells with 50 mM KCl leads to a significant increase in the expression of the minimal promoter construct, THCRE-CAT. This response is modest (about 3-fold) compared with that observed when the cells are treated with a cyclic AMP analog (approximately 15-fold). However, this modest response is perhaps due to the limiting amount of Ca2+ influx that occurs during depolarization with 50 mM KCl, because treatment with 10 μM A23187 (which raises [Ca2+]i to levels more than 3 μM) is associated with more than a 10-fold increase in THCRE-CAT expression.Recently, Nankova et al. (25Nankova B. Hiremagalur B. Menezes A. Zeman R. Sabban E. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 35: 164-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) have reported a similar study investigating Ca2+-responsive elements within the TH gene promoter using TH-CAT constructs with a mutagenized CRE or AP1 site. Their results with the mutagenized CRE construct agree with our data, indicating that the CRE site plays a significant role in Ca2+-mediated regulation of the TH gene. In contrast to our findings, these investigators do not observe a significant decrease in Ca2+-induced TH-CAT expression when the TH AP1 site is mutagenized. One explanation for this discrepancy may be differences in the number of mutagenized nucleotides within the element. In the mutagenized AP1 construct used in our study, only the first two base pairs of the core AP1 element (TGATTCA) are modified (to GAATTCA). This modification was chosen to minimize its influence on factors binding to the dyad symmetry element that overlaps the 3′ region of the core TH AP1 site (38Yoon S.O. Chikaraishi D.M. Neuron. 1992; 9: 55-67Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) or other elements found within this region, such as the FSE (39Gizang-Ginsberg E. Ziff E. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 477-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) or HIE (40Norris M.L. Millhorn D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23774-23779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The competitive displacement gel shift assays indicate that this 2-bp mutation is sufficient to inhibit the binding of Ca2+-inducible AP1 factors to the mutagenized site (Fig. 1). Furthermore, this 2-bp mutation produces a dramatic decrease in basal promoter activity, which is in agreement with previous studies indicating that the AP1 site or adjacent, overlapping sites participate in controlling basal expression of the gene in rat pheochromocytoma cells. In contrast, the entire core TH AP1 sequence is mutagenized in the construct used by Nankova et al. (25Nankova B. Hiremagalur B. Menezes A. Zeman R. Sabban E. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 35: 164-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) (mutant 2 in Ref. 38Yoon S.O. Chikaraishi D.M. Neuron. 1992; 9: 55-67Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Since a number of regulatory sequences have been mapped to this region of the gene, it is possible that these different mutations alter the response to Ca2+ due to changes in the binding of activating or repressing proteins that interact with these adjacent sites.An alternative explanation is that the discrepancy is due to differences in the route of Ca2+ influx in the two experiments. Membrane depolarization using high K+ permits Ca2+ influx into PC12 cells via L-type voltage-sensitive calcium channels. 2K. Nagamoto-Combs, K. M. Piech, J. A. Best, B. Sun, and A. W. Tank, unpublished observations. Nankova et al. (25Nankova B. Hiremagalur B. Menezes A. Zeman R. Sabban E. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 35: 164-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) used ionomycin to promote Ca2+ influx. Hence, the route of Ca2+ entry differs between these two studies. It is possible that CRE and AP1 transcription factors are modulated differently depending upon the route of Ca2+ influx. Support for this hypothesis has been demonstrated for the c-fos gene (41Bading H. Ginty D.D. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1993; 260: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar).In order to confirm that the TH AP1 site participates in the response of the promoter to Ca2+ influx, we have performed a number of subsequent studies. Even though the minimal promoter construct, THAP1-CAT, does not respond significantly to 50 mM KCl, a slight, but statistically insignificant, response was observed in each experiment. This lack of significant response is apparently due to either the limited influx of Ca2+ elicited by high K+ treatment or to differences in the route of Ca2+ entry, because treatment of the cells with A23187 elicited a 7-8-fold increase in THAP1-CAT expression. This ability of a single copy of TH AP1 to increase CAT expression upon Ca2+ influx provides evidence that the TH AP1 functions as a Ca2+-responsive element at least under certain stimulus conditions. However, the results using A23187 need to be interpreted with caution, because this ionophore may be producing effects that are not specific to Ca2+ influx.The gel shift assays demonstrate that Ca2+ influx elicited by either depolarization or treatment with A23187 increases the formation of a TH AP1 complex. These results also strongly support the participation of the TH AP1 site in the response to Ca2+ influx. However, it is also possible that unidentified adjacent sites bind to PC12 cell nuclear proteins to form the observed complex. Hence, we used antibodies targeting specific transcription factors to identify the Ca2+-inducible nuclear proteins that bind to the TH AP1 site. These studies have identified c-Fos, c-Jun, JunB, and JunD as members of the inducible TH AP1 complex. Hence, the increased formation of this complex upon Ca2+ influx is due to the increased binding of Fos and Jun family transcription factors to this site, supporting the role of the TH AP1 site in this response.The TH CRE2 is a newly discovered site within the TH gene promoter that is homologous to the proenkephalin gene ENKCRE1 and that is responsive to cyclic AMP in PC12 cells (27Best J.A. Chen Y. Piech K.P. Tank A.W. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 1934-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The present results suggest that this site does not play a significant role in the response to Ca2+. This conclusion is based on the very modest decrease in response to high K+, when the TH CRE2 is mutagenized within the normal context of the TH gene promoter and the lack of response of the THCRE2 in the minimal promoter studies to either 50 mM KCl or A23187.A current prevailing hypothesis is that Ca2+ influx stimulates genes by activating a calcium/calmodulin- dependent protein kinase, which then phosphorylates and activates CREB, leading to the transactivation of genes downstream of CRE sites. However, our results using the CREB-deficient cell lines suggest that CREB is not necessary for Ca2+-mediated regulation of the TH gene promoter. These results do not rule out CREB as a participant in the response to Ca2+ influx in wild type cells but suggest that other transcription factors can compensate when CREB levels are diminished. In this regard Greenberg and co-workers (42Liu F. Thompson M.A. Wagner S. Greenberg M.E. Green M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6714-6720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that the c-fos gene CRE is responsive to Ca2+ via phosphorylation of ATF1. It is also possible that transactivating forms of the CREM gene family may participate in this response (see Ref. 43Sassone-Corssi P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4717-4728Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar for review). Both of these factors are still present in the ASCREB cell lines.2 Furthermore, when CREB levels are lowered, regulation via the TH AP1 site may predominate. Further work is needed to elucidate these compensatory mechanisms in the CREB-deficient cell lines.

In contrast to these cell types, WEHI7.2 mouse lymphoma cells undergo apoptosis when treated with TG, prompting us to examine the grp78/grp94 stress response in WEHI7.2 cells. TG treatment failed to induce grp78/grp94 transcription in WEHI7.2 cells, measured by Northern hybridization and nuclear run-on assays, even if the cells were protected from apoptosis by overexpressing bcl-2. However, grp78/grp94 transcription was induced by the glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin, suggesting that there are at least two grp78/grp94 signaling pathways, one in response to TG-induced endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pool depletion, which is inoperable in WEHI7.2 cells, and one in response to glycosylation inhibition, which is operable in WEHI7.2 cells. Studies of additional lymphoid lines, as well as several nonlymphoid lines, suggested a correlation between grp78/grp94 induction and resistance to apoptosis following TG treatment. In conclusion, the vulnerability of TG-treated WEHI7.2 cells to apoptosis may be due to failure to signal a grp78/grp94 stress response. grp78/grp94 induction is critical for maintaining the viability of epithelial cells and fibroblasts following treatment with thapsigargin (TG), an inhibitor of Ca2+ uptake into the endoplasmic reticulum.

However, grp78/grp94 transcription was induced by the glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin, suggesting that there are at least two grp78/grp94 signaling pathways, one in response to TG-induced endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pool depletion, which is inoperable in WEHI7.2 cells, and one in response to glycosylation inhibition, which is operable in WEHI7.2 cells. Studies of additional lymphoid lines, as well as several nonlymphoid lines, suggested a correlation between grp78/grp94 induction and resistance to apoptosis following TG treatment. In conclusion, the vulnerability of TG-treated WEHI7.2 cells to apoptosis may be due to failure to signal a grp78/grp94 stress response."
https://openalex.org/W2324496255,"Receptors for the cytokines leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), interleukin-6 (IL-6), oncostatin M (OSM), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) and interleukin-11 (IL-11) are members of the structurally conserved hemopoietin receptor superfamily. In addition, they all share the transmembrane signalling protein gp130. In this paper the expression and function of this family of receptors in breast cancer cells was examined. RT – PCR analyses demonstrated that gp130 was expressed in 12/12 breast cell lines and the specific receptor α-chains for IL-6, LIF, IL-11 and CNTF were expressed in the majority of these cell lines. This was in contrast to other hemopoitin receptors. Examination of 50 clinical samples of malignant breast tissue by RT – PCR showed a similar pattern of expression of gp130 associated receptors. Treatment of breast cancer cell lines with OSM resulted in changes in cellular morphology. Cellular proliferation was inhibited following exposure to OSM (3/4 cell lines), IL-11 (2/4 cell lines), and by IL-6 and LIF (1/4 cell lines). Cell surface binding of LIF and OSM was also documented. The expression of these receptors in 12/12 cell lines and greater than 95% of clinical samples suggests that these molecules may be important in regulating the growth of breast cells."

In rodents and monkeys, MDMA is cytotoxic to serotonergic neurons, but this is less clear with humans. Herein, MDMA was cytotoxic to human serotonergic JAR cells; it altered the cell cycle, increased G2/M phase arrest, and induced DNA fragmentation in a cycloheximide-sensitive way. This apoptosis was not observed in nonserotonergic human NMB cells. The stereospecific effect of amphetamines in JAR cells, and the key role of NO and dopamine in MDMA-induced apoptosis were determined. The relevancy of MDMA-induced cell death to drug users is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2152679839,"A clearly definable upper tolerance limit for chromosome arm length has been found. As a rule we postulate that, for normal development of an organism, the longest chromosome arm must not exceed half of the average length of the spindle axis at telophase. Above this length, fertility and viability of the carrier individuals become severely impaired due to increasingly incomplete separation of the longest chromatids during mitosis, resulting finally in the loss of DNA. The experimental work that points to a limit in genome plasticity has been carried out on a series of field bean lines with karyotypes of considerable variation in length of individual chromosomes."

https://openalex.org/W2062294082,"Nitric oxide (NO) modulates neurotransmission in the central and peripheral nervous systems. NO acts, in part, by stimulating cGMP production by soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), an obligate heterodimer composed of alpha and beta subunits. To investigate mechanisms that regulate responsiveness to NO in the nervous system, sGC regulation was examined in a rat pheochromocytoma cell line (PC12) exposed to nerve growth factor (NGF). NGF decreased sGC alpha1 and beta1 subunit mRNA and protein levels as well as NO-stimulated sGC enzyme activity. The NGF-mediated decrease in sGC subunit mRNA levels was blocked by 5'-deoxy-5'-methylthioadenosine (an inhibitor of NGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation). NGF did not decrease sGC subunit mRNA levels in PC12 cells containing a mutant Ras protein that blocks Ras-dependent intracellular signaling. Incubation of PC12 cells with a transcription inhibitor (actinomycin D) or protein synthesis inhibitors (anisomycin or cycloheximide) attenuated the ability of NGF to decrease sGC subunit mRNA levels. Moreover, sGC subunit mRNA levels decreased more rapidly in NGF-treated cells than in actinomycin D-treated cells, suggesting that NGF decreases sGC subunit mRNA stability. Thus, NGF decreases sGC subunit mRNA levels via mechanisms that are dependent on protein tyrosine phosphorylation and Ras activation. The effect of NGF on sGC subunit mRNA stability appears to be transcription- and translation-dependent. Modulation of sGC subunit levels and enzyme activity in PC12 cells suggests that NO responsiveness may be regulated in the nervous system by NGF."
https://openalex.org/W2057430185,"Staphylokinase (Sak), a single-chain protein comprising 136 amino acids with NH2-terminal sequence, forms a complex with plasmin, that is endowed with plasminogen activating properties. Plasmin is presumed to process mature (high molecular weight, HMW) Sak to low molecular weight derivatives (LMW-Sak), primarily by hydrolyzing the Lys10-Lys11 peptide bond, but the kinetics of plasminogen activation by HMW-Sak and LMW-Sak are very similar. Here, the requirement of NH2-terminal proteolysis of Sak for the induction of plasminogen activating potential was studied by mutagenesis of Lys10 and Lys11 in combination with NH2-terminal microsequence analysis of equimolar mixtures of Sak and plasminogen and determination of kinetic parameters of plasminogen activation by catalytic amounts of Sak. Substitution of Lys10 with Arg did not affect processing of the Arg10-Lys11 site nor plasminogen activation, whereas substitution with His resulted in cleavage of the Lys11-Gly12 peptide bond and abolished plasminogen activation. Substitution of Lys11 with Arg did not affect Lys10-Arg11 processing or plasminogen activation, whereas replacement with His did not prevent Lys10-His11 hydrolysis but abolished plasminogen activation. Substitution of Lys11 with Cys yielded an inactive processed derivative which was fully activated by aminoethylation. Deletion of the 10 NH2-terminal amino acids did not affect plasminogen activation, but additional deletion of Lys11 eliminated plasminogen activation. Thus generation of plasminogen activator potential in Sak proceeds via plasmin-mediated removal of the 10 NH2-terminal amino acids with exposure of Lys11 as the new NH2 terminus. This provides a structural basis for the hypothesis, derived from kinetic measurements, that plasminogen activation by Sak needs to be primed by plasmin and a mechanism for the high fibrin selectivity of Sak in a plasma milieu."
https://openalex.org/W1987890480,"The oncogene Tpr-Met is a constitutively active form of the hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF) receptor Met. It comprises the intracellular moiety of Met linked to the dimerization domain of the nuclear envelope protein Tpr, thus functioning as a constitutively activated Met. HGF/SF is responsible for various biological processes including angiogenesis and wound healing, in which secreted serine protease urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) is implicated. The action of HGF/SF on cells is mediated by the autophosphorylation of Met on two carboxyterminal tyrosine residues, Y1349VHVNATVY1356VNV. The two tyrosine residues provide docking sites for various effector molecules, suggesting that multiple signaling pathways are activated to exert biological effects of HGF/SF [Ponzetto et al., Cell (1994) 77: 261]. We found that Tpr-Met efficiently activates the uPA gene via a SOS/Ras/extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK)-dependent signaling pathway. Mutation of Y1356, which abrogates GRB2 binding, reduced the induction to half of the control level, while mutation of Y1349 showed little effect on uPA induction, suggesting an important but partly replaceable role for GRB2 in Met-dependent uPA gene induction. Mutation of both Y1349VHV and Y1356VNV into optimal PI 3-kinase sites resulted in a residual induction of about one quarter of the control level, suggesting a potential role for PI 3-kinase. Dose-response analysis of the Tpr-Met showed a biphasic curve. These results suggest that the interplay among different signaling molecules on the receptor is important for full induction of the pathway leading to the activation of the uPA gene."
https://openalex.org/W2334577064,"Expression of oncogenic Ras in 23A2 skeletal myoblasts is sufficient to induce both a transformed phenotype and a differentiation-defective phenotype, but the signaling pathways activated by oncogenic Ras in these cells and their respective contribution to each phenotype have not been explored. In this study, we investigated MAP kinase activity in control 23A2 myoblasts and in 23A2 myoblasts rendered differentiation-defective by the stable expression of an oncogenic (G12V)Ha-ras gene (Ras9 cells). The MAP kinase immunoprecipitated from Ras9 cells was 30 – 40% more active than that from control 23A2 cells. To establish if this elevated MAP kinase activity is essential to the maintenance of the oncogenic Ras-induced phenotype, we utilized the selective MAP kinase kinase 1 (MEK1) inhibitor, PD 098059. PD 098059 decreased the MAP kinase activity in Ras9 cells to the level found in 23A2 cells. PD 098059 did not affect the ability of 23A2 myoblasts to differentiate. PD 098059 reverted the transformed morphology of Ras9 cells but did not restore the ability of these cells to express the muscle-specific myosin heavy chain gene or to form muscle fibers. Treatment with PD 098059 also did not affect the ability of oncogenic Ha-Ras to establish a non-myogenic phenotype in C3H10T1/2 cells co-expressing MyoD. These results demonstrate that the activation of MAP kinase is necessary for the transformed morphology of Ras9 cells but is not required by oncogenic Ras to establish or to maintain a differentiation-defective phenotype. While these data do not rule out the possibility that constitutive signaling by MEK1 or MAP kinase could inhibit myoblast differentiation, they clearly demonstrate that other pathways activated by oncogenic Ras are sufficient to inhibit differentiation."

https://openalex.org/W1989228537,"The comparative biological properties of NBT-II cells, a rat bladder carcinoma cell line constitutively expressing FGF-1 and FGF-2 were analysed in nude mice. FGF-1 is not secreted by the transfected cells unless the cDNA contains a signal sequence; conversely, NBT-II cells transfected with FGF-2 coding sequence produce and secrete the factor in a biologically active form. Bovine brain capillary endothelial cells are stimulated to proliferate upon addition of medium conditioned by the FGF-2-producing cells and this activity can be abrogated by the addition of anti-FGF-2 blocking antibodies. In addition, the FGF-2-containing medium, which cannot stimulate NBT-II cells due to absence of appropriate receptors, is able to induce scattering of NBT-II cells expressing the FGFR1. It has been reported previously that FGF-1-producing cells are highly tumorigenic in nude mice and induce carcinoma with a period of latency reduced from 6 to 5 weeks when compared to parental NBT-II cells. In contrast, NBT-II cells producing FGF-2 are no more tumorigenic than parental cells, indicating that FGF-1 and FGF-2 have different oncogenic properties in carcinoma. FGF-1 and FGF-2 are potent antiogenic factors that trigger the host endothelial cells. VEGF, another potent angiogen was found to be expressed in small amounts by NBT-II cells and to be expressed in reduced amount in the FGF-producing cells. In the NBT-II system in vivo FGF-1 and FGF-2 are highly and comparatively angiogenic in the resultant carcinoma and this occurs in the absence of production of significant amounts of VEGF by the carcinoma cells. Taken together, our results indicate that activated angiogenesis is not sufficient for rapid tumor expansion. FGF-1 behaves as a tumorigenic factor in the NBT-II bladder carcinoma cell model, whereas expression and secretion of large amounts of FGF-2 are not sufficient for increasing tumor growth."

https://openalex.org/W2335580981,"A point mutation in PKCalpha was originally discovered in a subpopulation of human pituitary tumors characterized by their invasive phenotype, and the same mutation was also seen in some thyroid neoplasms. To investigate the role of this mutation in tumorigenesis, normal and mutant human PKCalpha cDNAs were overexpressed in Rat6 embryo fibroblasts (R6). When extracts of R6 cells that expressed either the normal or mutant PKCalpha were assayed in the presence of calcium, phosphatidylserine and the phorbol ester TPA, for phosphorylation of either histone IIIS or the EGF-receptor peptide, both extracts gave similar results. However, the subcellular localization of the two proteins differed. Immunohistochemistry studies indicated that after treatment with TPA normal PKCalpha mainly translocated to the plasma membrane, but mutant PKCalpha translocated mainly to the perinuclear region and slightly to the nucleus. Furthermore, the cells that expressed the mutant PKCalpha displayed a decreased requirement for serum when compared to the cells expressing the normal human PKCalpha, and they formed small colonies in soft agar. By contrast, the cells expressing the normal human PKCalpha failed to form colonies in soft-agar. Thus, ectopic expression in rat fibroblasts of this mutant human PKCalpha sequence alters the growth properties of these cells and, when activated, the mutant PKCalpha displays aberrant intracellular translocation. Therefore, this mutation in PKCalpha could contribute to the process of tumor progression in certain human tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2048249571,"Vav is a signal transducing molecule containing C-terminal Src homology 3 (SH3)-SH2-SH3 domains, and has been thought to be expressed exclusively in hematopoietic and trophoblastic cells. By Northern blot analysis, vav transcripts of unique sizes, 4.8 kb and 1.0 kb, were detected in the testis among various tissues examined. From a mouse spermatocyte cDNA library, a novel isoform of vav (vav-T) was cloned, which corresponded to a part of the 4.8 kb transcript. Vav-T had an alternative 5′ sequence up to the middle of SH2-coding region, and encoded 163 amino acids with a single SH3 domain. Northern blot analysis of fractionated testicular cells and in situ hybridization histochemistry demonstrated that vav-T transcripts were expressed in the differentiating germ cells, especially spermatocytes. A 24 kD protein was detected by anti-Vav antibodies in the testis, but not in the spleen or bone marrow. Transcripts of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K, known to associate with the most C-terminal SH3 domain of Vav, were also detected in the differentiating male germ cells. These results demonstrate expression of previously nondescribed Vav-isoform in the testicular germ cells, and suggest that it interacts with RNA-binding proteins and plays an important role in spermatogenesis."

In this report, we have isolated and characterized some spontaneously derived cytokine-independent variants from TF-1 cells. Analysis of several signaling molecules known to be activated by the GM-CSF pathway revealed that two non-autocrine variants were still responsive to GM-CSF stimulation. However, both variants, without ligand stimulation, already had some activated forms of Raf and MAP kinases. Given current knowledge, the activated Raf/MAP kinase pathway was likely to be responsible for the survival of both variants in the cytokine-free medium. However, the growth of hybrids between wild type and either variant was unexpectedly dependent on GM-CSF. Both variants like the wild type cells were still susceptible to apoptosis induced by other stimuli. These results suggest that either the activated Raf/MAP kinase pathway in both variants is not sufficient to repress the `two-fold' death signals generated from the hybrids or that there is another mechanism that is responsible for the factor-independent growth of both variants."
