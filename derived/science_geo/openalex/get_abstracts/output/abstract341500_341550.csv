https://openalex.org/W2009589779,"Analyses of x-ray-diffraction measurements on (Mg,Fe)SiO(3) perovskite and (Mg,Fe)O magnesiowÃ¼stite at simultaneous high temperature and pressure are used to determine pressure-volume-temperature equations of state and thermoelastic properties of these lower mantle minerals. Detailed comparison with the seismically observed density and bulk sound velocity profiles of the lower mantle does not support models of this region that assume compositions identical to that of the upper mantle. The data are consistent with lower mantle compositions consisting of nearly pure perovskite (>85 percent), which would indicate that the Earth's mantle is compositionally, and by implication, dynamically stratified."
https://openalex.org/W1999483114,"Pigeonite-plagioclase gabbros that occur as clasts in mesosiderites (brecciated stony-iron meteorites) show extreme fractionations of the rare-earth elements (REEs) with larger positive europium anomalies than any previously known for igneous rocks from the Earth, moon, or meteorite parent bodies and greater depletions of light REEs relative to heavy REEs than known for comparable cumulate gabbros. The REE pattern for merrillite in one of these clasts is depleted in light REEs and has a large positive europium anomaly as a result of metamorphic equilibration with the silicates. The extreme REE ratios exhibited by the mesosiderite clasts demonstrate that multistage igneous processes must have occurred on some asteroids in the early solar system. Melting of the crust by large-scale impacts or electrical induction from an early T-Tauri-phase sun may be responsible for these processes."

https://openalex.org/W2054578464,"The 1400 physicists who converged on Dallas 2 weeks ago for the International High Energy Physics meeting came from all over. Ask them about the state of their field, however, and you'll find a common dream-to go beyond the standard model of particles and forces. For physicists ""searching for chinks in the model's armor,"" as several put it, the elusive, unobtrusive neutrino is a promising object of study. And while the meeting saw the possibility of a superheavy ""17-keV"" neutrino fade, cosmic ray-produced neutrinos gave new hints of physics in that over-the-rainbow region beyond the standard model."
