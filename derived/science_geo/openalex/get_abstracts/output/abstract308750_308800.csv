https://openalex.org/W2092178859,"The expected changes over the past 500 million years in the principal astronomical frequencies influencing the Earth's climate may be strong enough to be detectable in the geological records, and such effects have been inferred in several cases. Calculations suggest that the shortening of the Earth-moon distance and of the length of the day back in time induced a shortening of the fundamental periods for the obliquity and climatic precession, from 54 to 35, 41 to 29, 23 to 19, and 19 to 16 thousand years over the last half-billion years. At the same time, the precessional constant increased from 50 to 61 arc seconds per year. The changes in the frequencies of the planetary system due to its chaotic motion are much smaller; their influence on the changes of the periods of climatic precession, obliquity, and eccentricity of the Earth's orbit around the sun can be neglected. Eccentricity periods used for Quaternary climate studies may therefore be considered to have been more or less constant for pre-Quaternary times."

Several different (001) crystal planes were imaged to atomic resolution with both kinds of tips. A selective imaging of the octahedrally coordinated Fe B-sites in the Fe-O planes, and even a selective imaging of the different magnetic ions Fe(2+) and Fe(3+), has been achieved, demonstrating for the first time that magnetic imaging can be realized at the atomic level."

The canopy appeared to be an ammonia source when exposed to air containing low concentrations, but a sink when exposed to air enriched by nearby agricultural sources. The forest-averaged compensation point was 0.8 part per billion by volume at 20 degrees C. The net burden of ammonia and other nitrogen species of anthropogenic origin at this site was much less than at forest sites in the eastern United States and Europe and may provide a valuable resource for this nitrogen-limited ecosystem."
https://openalex.org/W1973585449,"Public and private decision makers are increasingly confronted with more complex and far-reaching public policy decisions concerning energy. Examples include responsible development of energy resources, allocation of energy research and development funds, legislated restrictions or subsidies for energy production and use, land use restrictions, and government regulation of major energy-producing industries. Decisions regarding all of these require analysis of the many social, economic, environmental, and political options and the delicate balancing of disparate yet competing interests, goals, and values. Various concepts regarding net energy analysis are reviewed and limitations on its usefulness for public policy decisions are evident. Congress has mandated the use of net energy analysis in assessment of new energy resources. Net energy analysis represents a marked departure from economic theory. In this paper, an assessment of the important assumptions and concepts underlying net energy analysis and a comparison of the different conclusions reached by net energy analysis and economic analysis are presented. The concepts of net energy and its important assumptions are defined; net energy analysis is subjected to an economic assessment; and some observations are made concerning the uses and limitations of the technique in the public policy-making process.

Models used by geochemists, geophysicists, and glass scientists need to include such effects. In situ, high-temperature nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy on 23Na, 27Al, and 29Si was used to help determine the time-averaged structure of a series of alkali aluminosilicate liquids at temperatures to 1320Â°C. Isotropic chemical shifts for 29Si increase (to higher frequencies) with increasing temperature, probably in response to intermediate-range structural changes such as the expansion of bonds between nonbridging oxygens and alkali cations. In contrast, isotropic chemical shifts for 27Al decrease with increasing temperature, indicating that more significant short-range structural changes take place for aluminum, such as an increase in mean coordination number. The spectrum of a sodium aluminosilicate glass clearly indicates that at least a few percent of six-coordinated aluminum was present in the liquid at high temperature."
https://openalex.org/W2060575996,"In the phytophagous corn earworm, Helicoverpa (Heliothis) zea, females delay their reproductive behaviors until they find a suitable host on which to deposit their eggs. Perception of volatile chemical signals from corn silk triggers the production of sex pheromone followed by its release, which leads to mating. Several natural corn silk volatiles, including the plant hormone ethylene, induced pheromone production in H. zea females. Because H. zea larvae feed on the fruiting parts of a wide variety of hosts, ethylene, which is associated with fruit ripening, could act as a common cue."
https://openalex.org/W2063229375,"Multispectral images of the lunar western limb and far side obtained from Galileo reveal the compositional nature of several prominent lunar features and provide new information on lunar evolution. The data reveal that the ejecta from the Orientale impact basin (900 kilometers in diameter) lying outside the Cordillera Mountains was excavated from the crust, not the mantle, and covers pre-Orientale terrain that consisted of both highland materials and relatively large expanses of ancient mare basalts. The inside of the far side South Pole-Aitken basin (>2000 kilometers in diameter) has low albedo, red color, and a relatively high abundance of iron- and magnesium-rich materials. These features suggest that the impact may have penetrated into the deep crust or lunar mantle or that the basin contains ancient mare basalts that were later covered by highlands ejecta."

https://openalex.org/W2017819713,"Turbulence can be narrowly defined as a property of incompressible fluid flow at very high Reynolds number, and thus an attempt can be made to specify what is and what is not understood about it. The applicability of the Navier-Stokes equations of hydrodynamics to real turbulent flows and the successes and limitations of direct numerical simulation are considered. A discussion is presented of universality, and mention is made of the remarkable success of Kolmogorov's 1941 scaling ideas despite uncertainties about basic underlying assumptions such as local isotropy. Extensions of this scaling to the multifractal picture of dissipation fluctuations are discussed, but this picture remains phenomenological. Turbulence as defined above remains ""unsolved"" in the sense that a clear physical understanding of the observed phenomena does not exist."
