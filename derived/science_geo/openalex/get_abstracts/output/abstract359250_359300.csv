(wet weight) of guinea pig liver homogenate were added to a reaction mixture containing 1.3 per cent of an amino acid mixture corresponding to the composition of casein except for lysine and 0.01 M α-ketoglutarate, all in a final volume of 4 ml. of isotonic saline solution.(1) The reaction was carried out under oxygen for 6 hours at 38°."

By extracting the crushed potato residue with 10 per cent sodium chloride, they were able to obtain an additional amount of protein which they considered was identical with the globulin contained in the press juice. When a solution of this protein in 10 per cent sodium chloride was gradually heated, a flocculent coagulum was formed at about 60° C., and further precipitates were obtained at higher temperatures up to 80° C. At this temperature coagulation of all the protein was complete, although a minute amount of proteose material appeared to remain in solution. The authors concluded that the only true protein present in potato was a globulin, with rather indeterm-"

Our concern here will be the comparison between different directions in space, and we shall speak with respect to any quantity, or development, of isotropic symmetry to denote identity in the various directions, and of anisotropic symmetry to denote differences from one direction to another."

https://openalex.org/W1972647932,"THE observation of von Mutzenbecher1 that traces of thyroxine are formed on incubation of an alkaline solution of diiodotyrosine was developed by Harington and Pitt Rivers2. These authors showed that the course of the reaction was greatly influenced by pH ; the largest yield of thyroxine, amounting to 2.7 per cent calculated on the diiodotyrosine not recoverable at the end of the oxidation, was obtained at pH 10; at this pH the acidic groups of diiodotyrosine are 95 per cent neutralized. In highly alkaline solution, there was little destruction of diiodotyrosine and no thyroxine formation : at lower alkalinity (pH 8–9) the destruction of diiodotyrosine was very extensive and the formation of thyroxine was minute. In all experiments in which diiodotyrosine was oxidatively destroyed, tarry by-products appeared and the liberation of ammonia was evident."

https://openalex.org/W2001706112,"IT has recently been shown1 by a consideration of the molecular resonance properties associated with various structural models that the observed2 centro-symmetrical nature of the hexadiene-Astrol molecule (ppâ²-dihyaroxy-3 : 4-diphenyl-2 : 4-hexadiene) [I] requires the hexadiene chain to exist in the planar trans-trans-configuration shown below. The two benzene rings are probably rotated by some 50° out of the hexadiene plane in order to reduce the steric interference of the ortho hydrogen atoms. Similar arguments lead to a non-coplanar structure of stilbAstrol (ppâ²-dihydroxy-I±I²-trans-diethylstilbene [II], in which the conformation of the aliphatic hexene chain must be expected to approximate to a zig-zag shape rather than to the S-form [III], the latter offering much greater steric opposition to the resonance-induced tendency of the stilbene skeleton to attain full coplanarity."

https://openalex.org/W2042069251,"FEW attempts have been made to maintain (or grow) animal tissue cells in protein-free media, although it has been shown1 that the low molecular weight substances of blood plasma are of the utmost importance for the life of tissue cells, which rapidly perish in dialysed blood plasma. It has further been possible1,2, by the addition of a number of aminoacids together with glutamine, glutathione and hexose diphosphate to a medium containing only dialysed plasma proteins and dialysed embryonic extract, to obtain survival and growth of the cells. The few attempts made to devise completely synthetic media have met with only partial success because of lack of a suitable technique, and because very little is really known about the fundamental nutritional requirements of animal tissue cells during survival and growth."

https://openalex.org/W1992207514,"RECENTLY, Cowley and Rees1 reported some interesting work on the fine structure of electron diffraction patterns of crystals of magnesium oxide, cadmium oxide, etc. (multiple rings or spots) by application of high-resolution electron diffraction cameras. They confirmed the view of Sturkey and Frevel, who suggested that this fine structure arises from refraction at the faces of the regularly shaped crystal cubes. If the normals of the faces by which the beam of electrons enters and leaves the crystal lie in the same plane with the beam and the normal of the net plane2, one can derive an expression relating the angular displacement of the beam Îµ to the angles Ï†1 and Ï†2 (angle between face normal and incident and refracted electrons respectively):(V is inner potential, E is accelerating potential, Î¸0 Bragg angle for V = 0). This deviation having values of 10−4 radians (V = 10 volts, E = 50,000 volts, Ï† = 45°) or 3 x 10−3 cm. at a specimen-plate distance of 30 cm., high resolution will be necessary to detect it."
https://openalex.org/W2074325705,"Streptococcus bovis, a conspicuous streptococcus of cow dung and also occurring in human faeces, has proved difficult to classify. Biochemically it is a well-defined species (Orla Jensen), and although it has some of the characteristics of Lancefield‘s Group D streptococci, its serological identity has long been obscure because of its failure to yield a group serum. While many strains of Str. bovis reacted with Group D sera, a not inconsiderable proportion gave negative or equivocal results1,2,3, and until group sera for Str. bovis could be prepared its serological placing was necessarily left in abeyance."
https://openalex.org/W194261463,"SUMMARY A method is described for determining vitamin A simultaneously in stand- ard and unknown, thus canceling errors due to different treatment of standard and sample. Readings of the Carr-Price color can be taken more at leisure, as the difference in fading rather than the fading of the color it- self is measured. A simple reference diagram for converting readings into vitamin A units is given. * As Ei’& cannot be actually measured in determining the ultraviolet absorption of vitamin A, the density being too high, the half value, W::,., is suggested instead (7). The half value is the weight of a substance (in gm.) which has to be contained in 1 ml. of solvent in order to reduce the transmitted light by half, the length of the path being 1 cm. and the light transmitted by the solvent alone being unity. By falling always into the sensitive range, Wf’& does not call for extrapolation as in case of E:Fm.. Obviously, when a solution follows Beer’s law over a very wide range"
https://openalex.org/W2011639064,"RECENT work involved accurate weighing of the thymus glands of young (6–12 weeks old) hooded Lister rats of both sexes. It became evident that great care was essential in dissecting out the thymus because of the risk of including one or more lymph nodes in the tissue taken for weighing. In rats of this age, mediastinal lymph nodes are occasionally difficult to distinguish from part of the thymus. One or more of these nodes is usually found on each side of the thymus and is visible from the front on opening the thorax. Identification is simple when the nodes lie apart from the thymus ; but when they are welded by connective tissue to the thymus, and the symmetry of the sides of this organ is not altered, confusion may arise."
https://openalex.org/W2026646458,"UNFORTUNATELY, it is exceedingly difficult to exterminate insect pests over a large area (not to mention the whole world), because of their enormous numbers, small size, and powers of proliferation. Therefore, we have come to be satisfied with ‘‘control as an objective ; and so far as mosquitoes are concerned, control measures are considered satisfactory if they reduce the mosquito population below the ‘critical ‘density necessary for the propagation of disease."
https://openalex.org/W2102709675,"IT is well known that the short-lived atoms of radium A, B, C, and Câ² are deposited on the surfaces of objects which come in contact with radon. Three of them, namely, radium A, C and Câ², emit alpha rays. The emulsion of a photographic plate is blackened by these alpha particles. Their range in the emulsion is very short (maximum 50 µ). The geometric properties of the surface, for example, differences in the distance of various points of the surface of the object from the emulsion, cause a different blackening due to the alpha emission of the deposit on the surface. This enables us to develop a radiographic method which gives in a simple way a picture showing the structure of the surface."

https://openalex.org/W2047651712,"THE wall of the bacterial cell is solid. The cell- wall may maintain its approximate shape after cytolysis ; on breaking it may present a jagged line of fracture 1. Within the cell-wall, and normally doubtless closely applied to it, is the cytoplasmic membrane enveloping a fluid or potentially fluid protoplasm. In electron micrographs the protoplasm often is appreciably separated from the cell-wall2. This is doubtless a shrinkage artefact due to desiccation in the electron microscope, which operates in a high vacuum. The protoplast and in particular the cytoplasmic membrane are stained and visible, the cell-wall unstained and not seen, in routine bacteriological preparations. Flagella, if present, arise from the protoplast and pass through the cell-wall, at least in vibrios. They are of uniform diameter somewhat characteristic of the bacterial species. They are not artefacts or mucous threads3. Capsules, as in the case of the pneumococcus, are extracellular gels surrounding the cell-wall4."

https://openalex.org/W2073522256,"THE mechanical properties of a natural or synthetic polymer are profoundly affected when the van der Waals' intermolecular forces are supplemented by stable chemical linkages (cross-linkages) between the polymer molecules. In synthetic polymers, cross-linking may generally be brought about either as an essential part of the polymerization reaction, or by chemical modification of the polymer subsequent to polymerization; but cross-linking in natural rubber can only be accomplished by the latter method. Although cross-linkages in synthetic rubbers could be introduced during polymerization if desired, they are, in fact, excluded so far as possible; hence, as with natural rubber, it is necessary to carry out the cross-linking reactions on the polymer itself. In a recent series of lectures at the Royal Institution, London, various types of cross-linking mechanisms and their effect on the properties of polymers were discussed. Dr. H. P. Staudinger dealt with the cross-linking of vinyl polymers, the present writer discussed the structural modification of high polymers by vulcanization, with particular reference to rubber, and Dr. L. R. G. Treloar described the relation of mechanical properties to the degree of cross-linking in rubbers. Phenol-formaldehyde resins, in which the role of cross-linking reactions is rather less clear, were surveyed by Mr. E. G. K. Pritchett. My thanks are due to the board of the British Rubber Producers' Research Association for permission to contribute to this series of lectures and to prepare the following summary of them."

A positive precipitin reaction was obtained with the serum from a patient suffering from pulmonary hydatid disease, when dilute solutions of this polysaccharide were used as an antigen. Serum giving positive and negative Wassermann results showed no precipitin reaction with this same antigen."
https://openalex.org/W3027088956,"WHILE, as Prof. M. L. Oliphant has pointed out (Nature, May 25, p. 679) in reviewing the proposals of the Lilienthal Board for the international control of atomic energy, countries whose interest in the peaceful production of power by nuclear methods is more direct than that of countries like the United States richly endowed with coal and other sources of power, may give somewhat different emphasis to some of the points raised, there can be no dissent as to the urgency of the whole problem. If political dilatoriness and self-seeking lead to obstruction and lack of agreement, the Lilienthal proposals and any like scheme may, as Prof. Oliphant remarks, instead of saving the world, have precisely the opposite effect. It is therefore encouraging to note that both the British and Canadian delegates on the Atomic Energy Commission have already signified the support of their Governments for the general principles of the American scheme based on the work of the Lilienthal Board."
https://openalex.org/W1974916558,"THE experience gained by Army educationists between 1920 and 1939, the story of Army education during the Second World War and release period, together with the broad principles of post-war development, have been the theme of previous articles (Nature, 158, 775, 821, December 1946). The contrast between the condition of education in the Army after the First World War and after the Second is clearly marked. It is the difference between the newly formed Army Educational Corps struggling against apathy, suspicion and even hostility, and a Corps recognized as an integral part of the national system and a pioneer in the field of further education."

https://openalex.org/W4241678631,"WHILE the veil of secrecy drawn for the most part over the activities of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research since the spring of 1939 remains unlifted, and we still await the resumption of publication of the annual reports of the Department and even the appearance of the long-promised review of its war-time activities, pronouncements regarding administrative developments are made in diverse ways and sometimes to strange audiences. The address of the Lord President of the Council to the North Herts Labour Party at Letch-worth on January 14, containing the important announcement regarding the development of a scientific centre at the new town of Stevenage, is a recent example. Mr. Morrison prefaced his announcement by stating that the Government is eager to see science supporting enterprise in the national effort for economic recovery and independence. It proposes to bring to public enterprise new ideas and progressive development by making full use of the unrivalled scientific brains of Britain, sweeping away the old isolation of science and the tendency to look at scientific workers as people not needed in industry or only needed in the ‘back ‘room, or as long-haired old gentlemen cut off from worldly affairs. The Government is taking steps, he said, to bring science into the forefront of British industry, and does not believe that industry can give the nation what it wants in increasing abundance at decreasing costs unless science becomes more of a partner."
