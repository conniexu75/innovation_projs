https://openalex.org/W3025511956,"The new coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) uses an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) for the replication of its genome and the transcription of its genes1–3. Here we present a cryo-electron microscopy structure of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp in an active form that mimics the replicating enzyme. The structure comprises the viral proteins non-structural protein 12 (nsp12), nsp8 and nsp7, and more than two turns of RNA template–product duplex. The active-site cleft of nsp12 binds to the first turn of RNA and mediates RdRp activity with conserved residues. Two copies of nsp8 bind to opposite sides of the cleft and position the second turn of RNA. Long helical extensions in nsp8 protrude along exiting RNA, forming positively charged ‘sliding poles’. These sliding poles can account for the known processivity of RdRp that is required for replicating the long genome of coronaviruses3. Our results enable a detailed analysis of the inhibitory mechanisms that underlie the antiviral activity of substances such as remdesivir, a drug for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)4. A cryo-electron microscopy structure of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of SARS-CoV-2 sheds light on coronavirus replication and enables the analysis of the inhibitory mechanisms of candidate antiviral drugs."

Podgorski and Berg used measurements of arsenic in groundwater from ∼80 previous studies to train a machine-learning model with globally continuous predictor variables, including climate, soil, and topography (see the Perspective by Zheng). The output global map reveals the potential for hazard from arsenic contamination in groundwater, even in many places where there are sparse or no reported measurements. The highest-risk regions include areas of southern and central Asia and South America. Understanding arsenic hazard is especially essential in areas facing current or future water insecurity.

Encapsulation can limit decomposition by bringing such reactions to equilibrium and can prevent exposure to damaging ambient moisture. Shi et al. examined several encapsulation schemes for perovskite films and devices by probing volatile products with gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (see the Perspective by Juarez-Perez and Haro). Pressure-tight polymer/glass stack encapsulation was effective in suppressing gas transfer and allowed solar cells containing methylammonium to pass harsh moisture and thermal cycling tests.

Here, we show that KDs alter the human and mouse gut microbiota in a manner distinct from high-fat diets (HFDs). Metagenomic and metabolomic analyses of stool samples from an 8-week inpatient study revealed marked shifts in gut microbial community structure and function during the KD. Gradient diet experiments in mice confirmed the unique impact of KDs relative to HFDs with a reproducible depletion of bifidobacteria. In vitro and in vivo experiments showed that ketone bodies selectively inhibited bifidobacterial growth. Finally, mono-colonizations and human microbiome transplantations into germ-free mice revealed that the KD-associated gut microbiota reduces the levels of intestinal pro-inflammatory Th17 cells. Together, these results highlight the importance of trans-kingdom chemical dialogs for mediating the host response to dietary interventions."

Mitochondrial dysfunction in various tissues is a prominent characteristic of age-related deterioration, but it is unclear how mitochondrial dysfunction in particular cell types contributes to this process. Desdín-Micó et al. generated mice with T cells that were specifically deficient in a mitochondrial DNA–stabilizing protein. These animals exhibited multiple features associated with aging, including neurological, metabolic, muscular, and cardiovascular impairments. The defective T cells initiated an inflammatory program similar to that observed in older animals, a process called “inflammaging.” Blocking the cytokine tumor necrosis factor–α or administering precursors of the cofactor nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide restored many of these symptoms of senescence. These findings may potentially inform future therapies for age-associated diseases, as well as cachexia and cytokine-release syndrome. Science , this issue p. 1371"
https://openalex.org/W3027858658,"Topological materials exhibit properties dictated by quantised invariants that make them robust against perturbations. This topological protection is a universal wave phenomenon that applies not only in the context of electrons in solid-state materials but also to photonic systems, ultracold atoms, mechanical systems, circuits, exciton-polaritons and beyond. However, the vast majority of research in these systems has focused on the linear domain, i.e., where inter-particle interactions do not play a role. Here, we experimentally observe solitons -- waves that propagate without changing shape as a result of nonlinearity -- in the bulk of a photonic Floquet topological insulator. These solitons exhibit fundamentally different behaviour than solitons in ordinary band gaps in that they execute cyclotron-like orbits that are associated with the topology of the lattice. Specifically, we employ a laser-written waveguide array with periodic variations along the waveguide axis that give rise to non-zero Floquet winding number, where the nonlinearity arises from the optical Kerr effect of the ambient glass. The effect described here is applicable to a range of bosonic systems due to its description by the focusing nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation, i.e., the Gross-Pitaevskii equation with attractive interactions."

Although short-term drying and warming are known to affect forests, it is unknown if such effects translate into long-term responses. Here, we analyze 590 permanent plots measured across the tropics to derive the equilibrium climate controls on forest carbon. Maximum temperature is the most important predictor of aboveground biomass (-9.1 megagrams of carbon per hectare per degree Celsius), primarily by reducing woody productivity, and has a greater impact per °C in the hottest forests (>32.2°C). Our results nevertheless reveal greater thermal resilience than observations of short-term variation imply. To realize the long-term climate adaptation potential of tropical forests requires both protecting them and stabilizing Earth's climate."

The nine-subunit endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane protein complex (EMC) is a conserved co- and posttranslational insertase at the ER. We determined the structure of the human EMC in a lipid nanodisc to an overall resolution of 3.4 angstroms by cryo–electron microscopy, permitting building of a nearly complete atomic model. We used structure-guided mutagenesis to demonstrate that substrate insertion requires a methionine-rich cytosolic loop and occurs via an enclosed hydrophilic vestibule within the membrane formed by the subunits EMC3 and EMC6.

Challenges to achieving superior performance include creating highly aligned and dense arrays of nanotubes as well as removing coatings that increase contact resistance. Sun et al. aligned CNTs by wrapping them with single-stranded DNA handles and binding them into DNA origami bricks that formed an array of channels with precise intertube pitches as small as 10.4 nanometers. Zhao et al. then constructed single and multichannel FETs by attaching the arrays to a polymer-templated silicon wafer. After adding metal contacts across the CNTs to fix them to the substrate, they washed away all of the DNA and then deposited electrodes and gate dielectrics.

These results show that mito-SRAI is an essential tool for quantitative studies of mitochondrial quality control. For monitoring of autophagy, which involves the delivery of biomolecules and organelles to lysosomes, it has become common to use a tandem fusion of two differently colored fluorescent proteins (FPs), in most cases EGFP and mCherry (Kuma et al., 2017Kuma A. Komatsu M. Mizushima N. Autophagy-monitoring and autophagy-deficient mice.Autophagy. 2017; 13: 1619-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, Yoshii and Mizushima, 2017Yoshii S.R. Mizushima N. Monitoring and Measuring Autophagy.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2017; 18: E1865https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms18091865Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). The fluorescence of these proteins is differentially sensitive to the lysosomal environment: EGFP is sensitive whereas mCherry is not, and this difference is used to monitor lysosomal delivery of the probe. We have been deeply engaged in the characterization of FP sensitivities, which have reversible and irreversible components. Reversible sensitivity is based on the protonation-deprotonation equilibrium of the chromophore (Tsien, 1998Tsien R.Y. The green fluorescent protein.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 509-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (4939) Google Scholar), whereas irreversible sensitivity is based on the destruction of β-barrel scaffold by acids and/or acid proteases (Katayama et al., 2008Katayama H. Yamamoto A. Mizushima N. Yoshimori T. Miyawaki A. GFP-like proteins stably accumulate in lysosomes.Cell Struct. Funct. 2008; 33: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Although EGFP and mCherry are both very useful and popular (Shaner et al., 2004Shaner N.C. Campbell R.E. Steinbach P.A. Giepmans B.N. Palmer A.E. Tsien R.Y. Improved monomeric red, orange and yellow fluorescent proteins derived from Discosoma sp. red fluorescent protein.Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 1567-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (3497) Google Scholar, Tsien, 1998Tsien R.Y. The green fluorescent protein.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 509-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (4939) Google Scholar), they do not show opposite extremes in sensitivities. Furthermore, considering the incomplete assessment of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) from EGFP to mCherry, we came to the conclusion that the simple fusion of these proteins yields signals that are difficult to interpret in the context of autophagy detection. Mitophagy is the selective degradation of mitochondria by autophagy (Pickles et al., 2018Pickles S. Vigié P. Youle R.J. Mitophagy and Quality Control Mechanisms in Mitochondrial Maintenance.Curr. Biol. 2018; 28: R170-R185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). Although it is theoretically possible to monitor mitophagy by labeling mitochondria with an autophagy probe, in practice it is difficult to achieve complete mitochondrial localization of the probe. Pre-targeted or mistargeted products may be delivered directly to lysosomes via a non-selective autophagy, resulting in false-positive mitophagy signals. In contrast to GFP-LC3 (Mizushima et al., 2010Mizushima N. Yoshimori T. Levine B. Methods in mammalian autophagy research.Cell. 2010; 140: 313-326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3545) Google Scholar), a well-established probe for autophagosomes, recently developed autophagy (mitophagy) probes all accumulate in lysosomes to provide cumulative readouts that increase in intensity over time (Katayama et al., 2011Katayama H.

Their constitutive gene expression in transgenic mice may give rise to leakage signals that could be interpreted as basal mitophagy activities. We previously developed a mitophagy probe, mt-mKeima, and improved the specificity of its mitochondrial localization by turning off the gene expression for 1 day prior to observation (Katayama et al., 2011Katayama H. Kogure T. Mizushima N. Yoshimori T. Miyawaki A. A sensitive and quantitative technique for detecting autophagic events based on lysosomal delivery.Chem. Biol. 2011; 18: 1042-1052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). However, mt-mKeima is an FP that exhibits reversible acid sensitivity and is therefore applicable to mitophagy imaging only in living specimens. With the goal of elucidating mitophagy-related pathogenesis in Parkinsons disease (PD) and developing mitophagy-enhancing drugs that could potentially cure PD, we tried to develop a highly reliable mitophagy probe that can be applied to fixed as well as living samples. After deciding to take the tandem fusion approach, our initial goal was to create an FP that is more robust than any of the currently available FPs. Most FPs share X-Tyr-Gly, a chromophore-forming tripeptide. The chromophores possess a phenol ring derived from the Tyr residue, and their spectral properties are determined by the equilibrium between the protonated and ionized states of the phenol hydroxyl group (Tsien, 1998Tsien R.Y. The green fluorescent protein.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 509-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (4939) Google Scholar). They produce a bimodal absorption spectrum characterized by two peak maxima that correspond to the protonated and ionized states (short and long wavelengths, respectively). The ionized state, which is usually fluorescent, is modulated by a hydrogen bond network comprising an intricate system of polar interactions between the chromophore and several surrounding amino acids. A number of Aequorea GFP variants are useful as pH (acid) sensors (Llopis et al., 1998Llopis J. McCaffery J.M. Miyawaki A. Farquhar M.G. Tsien R.Y. Measurement of cytosolic, mitochondrial, and Golgi pH in single living cells with green fluorescent proteins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1998; 95: 6803-6808Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar, Miesenböck et al., 1998Miesenböck G. De Angelis D.A. Rothman J.E. Visualizing secretion and synaptic transmission with pH-sensitive green fluorescent proteins.Nature. 1998; 394: 192-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1966) Google Scholar); they can be titrated with single pKa values, indicating that their internal protonation equilibrium is affected by the external pH. This type of pH sensitivity occurs reversibly around neutral pH. On the other hand, although most FPs share a very rigid β-can fold, they are more or less denatured by strong acid, and their fluorescence does not recover after complete pH neutralization. For example, a previous in vitro study by our group revealed that a significant fraction of a non-aggregating mutant of DsRed, DsRed2, was irreversibly denatured during incubation at pH 5.0 at 37°C for 18 h (Katayama et al., 2008Katayama H. Yamamoto A. Mizushima N. Yoshimori T. Miyawaki A. GFP-like proteins stably accumulate in lysosomes.Cell Struct. Funct. 2008; 33: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, such irreversible acid denaturation depends greatly on the denaturing conditions and is therefore difficult to quantify. Because conventional pH titration experiments do not examine the reversibility of FP acid sensitivity, it is unclear to what extent the moderate difference in pH sensitivity between EGFP and mCherry (Figure 1A) contributes to the detection of lysosomal delivery of their fusion, i.e., mCherry-EGFP. The most straightforward approach to monitoring of autophagy would be to use a special FP that is completely resistant to acidity. We screened a library of wild-type and mutant FPs originating from Anthozoans and obtained a cyan-emitting FP (CFP) that exhibited full fluorescence not only at pH 7 but also at pH 4–5, corresponding to the acidity inside the lysosomal lumen. This CFP was tentatively named afCFP (acid-fast CFP). afCFP is derived from mAG, the monomeric version of a green-emitting FP, AzamiGreen (AG) (Karasawa et al., 2003Karasawa S. Araki T. Yamamoto-Hino M. Miyawaki A. A green-emitting fluorescent protein from Galaxeidae coral and its monomeric version for use in fluorescent labeling.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34167-34171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) (Table S1), which was previously cloned from the stony coral Galaxeidae. afCFP absorbed light maximally at 406 nm (Figure 1B), and when excited with violet-blue light, emitted bright fluorescence at 499 nm (Figure 1C). The absorption spectrum was extremely resistant to acidity (pKa < 3), with consistently uniform absorbance between pH 4 and 8 (Figure 1B). All the spectral properties of afCFP, namely, excitation and emission maxima, molar extinction coefficient, and fluorescence quantum yield, were identical between pH 4 and 7 (Table S2). For monitoring autophagy in fixed biological samples, where the pH gradient across lysosomal membranes is lost, we need to consider FP degradation (proteolysis) inside lysosomes in addition to irreversible acid denaturation. Our previous study revealed that most coral-derived FPs are resistant to lysosomal proteases, whereas Aequorea GFP variants are not (Katayama et al., 2008Katayama H. Yamamoto A. Mizushima N. Yoshimori T. Miyawaki A. GFP-like proteins stably accumulate in lysosomes.Cell Struct. Funct. 2008; 33: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Upon incubation in a lysosome-mimicking environment, Aequorea GFP variants such as EGFP were completely degraded, whereas coral-derived FPs such as mRFP1 were preserved. We confirmed that afCFP retained its full fluorescence after incubation with pepsin at pH 4.0 at 37°C for 18 h (Figure 1D), and we thus renamed this protein TOLLES (TOLerance of Lysosomal EnvironmentS); all the FPs derived from the jellyfish that we examined were degraded under this condition (Figure S1). In the intact tandem construct (mCherry-EGFP) used for autophagy imaging, a substantial amount of FRET should occur from EGFP to mCherry, and quenched EGFP signals are detected in the green channel. Certainly, this would make it difficult to quantify the autophagy readout. Although FRET efficiency varies depending on the situation, there is no simple method for quantifying it; a serious problem with mCherry-EGFP is that the donor FP (EGFP) can be degraded inside the lysosome. In principle, a degrading and a non-degrading FP must be used as acceptor and donor, respectively. Under these circumstances, FRET efficiency (E) is simply given by (Equation 1):E=1−(Fda/Fd)(1) where Fda and Fd are the fluorescence intensities of donor in the presence and absence of acceptor, respectively (Miyawaki and Tsien, 2000Miyawaki A. Tsien R.Y. Monitoring protein conformations and interactions by fluorescence resonance energy transfer between mutants of green fluorescent protein.Methods Enzymol. 2000; 327: 472-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). On the basis of this concept, we designed a tandem construct, yellow-emitting FP (YFP)-TOLLES, which contains TOLLES as FRET donor and YFP derived from Aequorea GFP as FRET acceptor. There is substantial overlap between TOLLES’s emission spectrum and YFP’s absorption spectrum (Figure S2A). With the goal of enhancing responsiveness, we optimized the linker of YFP-TOLLES to maximize FRET. Furthermore, to stabilize the maximized FRET around neutral pH, we chose a relatively less pH-sensitive YFP, YPet (Nguyen and Daugherty, 2005Nguyen A.W. Daugherty P.S. Evolutionary optimization of fluorescent proteins for intracellular FRET.Nat. Biotechnol. 2005; 23: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). We verified that YPet was irreversibly acid-denatured and degraded by pepsin (Figure 1E), providing a marked contrast with TOLLES in terms of fate after delivery into the lysosomal lumen. This tandem construct was expected to serve as a sensitive and quantitative indicator for autophagy and was thus named SRAI (signal-retaining autophagy indicator). We measured the emission spectra of SRAI at pH 7 in a cuvette after 18-h incubation at pH 7 or pH 4, or with pepsin at pH 4 (Figure 1F). Using (Equation 1), E in intact SRAI was calculated to be 0.56. The operational principle of autophagy detection in fixed cells expressing SRAI is shown in Figure 1G. We transfected SRAI into cultured mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) to visualize conventional autophagy. TOLLES and YPet were individually excited using two excitation band-pass filters, and their emissions were collected using two emission band-pass filters (Figure S2B). Ratio (TOLLES/YPet) images were generated using the two channel signals on a pixel-by-pixel basis. We mostly employed this dual-excitation dual-emission ratiometric approach since it provided a higher signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio than the single-excitation dual-emission approach. At first, we performed time-lapse live imaging. TOLLES fluorescence was homogeneously distributed in growth medium (Figure 2A, Live), but after starvation in Hanks’ balanced salt solution (HBSS) for 4 h, punctate structures reflecting lysosomes appeared in the TOLLES image (Figure 2B, Live). The puncta exhibited high ratio values, indicating significant quenching and/or digestion of YPet in the lysosomes. Of particular importance was the fact that these fluorescence and ratio images were completely retained after fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) (Figures 2A and 2B, Fixed) (Figures 2C and 2D). Such tolerance to fixation could distinguish SRAI from dKeima (Katayama et al., 2011Katayama H. Kogure T. Mizushima N. Yoshimori T. Miyawaki A. A sensitive and quantitative technique for detecting autophagic events based on lysosomal delivery.Chem. Biol. 2011; 18: 1042-1052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), which we developed previously as a fluorescent probe for autophagy in living cells. Especially, the use of fixed cells enabled prolonged observation for the statistical analysis of autophagy. We established a method that quantifies the intensity-weighted distribution of SRAI ratios on a per-pixel basis. As an autophagy inducer, we tested Torin2, which is a novel inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) (Wang et al., 2015Wang C. Wang X. Su Z. Fei H. Liu X. Pan Q. The novel mTOR inhibitor Torin-2 induces autophagy and downregulates the expression of UHRF1 to suppress hepatocarcinoma cell growth.Oncol. Rep. 2015; 34: 1708-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The sigmoidal dose-response relationship (Figure 2E) indicated that Torin2 caused autophagy with an EC50 of 8.1 nM in MEF cells. This result is consistent with the fact that Torin2 inhibits mTOR with an IC50 value of less than 10 nM (Kondapuram et al., 2019Kondapuram S.K. Sarvagalla S. Coumar M.S. Targeting autophagy with small molecules for cancer therapy.J. Cancer Metastasis Treat. 2019; 5https://doi.org/10.20517/2394-4722.2018.105Crossref Google Scholar). With new data mining algorithm, SRAI is expected to provide an image-based method that facilitates the quantitative assessment of a variety of autophagy modulators (Kaizuka et al., 2016Kaizuka T. Morishita H. Hama Y. Tsukamoto S. Matsui T. Toyota Y. Kodama A. Ishihara T. Mizushima T. Mizushima N. An Autophagic Flux Probe that Releases an Internal Control.Mol. Cell. 2016; 64: 835-849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) under natural conditions. Mitophagy, the selective degradation of mitochondria by autophagy, is thought to prevent the accumulation of damaged (dysfunctional) mitochondria, which leads to cellular degeneration in disease states (Whitworth and Pallanck, 2017Whitworth A.J. Pallanck L.J. PINK1/Parkin mitophagy and neurodegeneration-what do we really know in vivo?.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2017; 44: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar); hence, researchers are anxiously awaiting the development of a reliable method for quantifying mitophagy. Although the mitophagy signal from mt-mKeima increases cumulatively over time and can be measured at an arbitrary time point, the signal is sensitive to fixation and therefore not very suitable for large-scale high-throughput (high-content) screening assays, which usually use fixed cell samples. To develop a fixation-resistant mitophagy probe, we tried to engineer SRAI to localize into the mitochondrial matrix by fusing a tandem repeat of the COX VIII presequence (Rudolf et al., 2004Rudolf R. Mongillo M. Magalhães P.J. Pozzan T. In vivo monitoring of Ca(2+) uptake into mitochondria of mouse skeletal muscle during contraction.J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 527-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) (Figure 3A, mt-SRAI). As evidenced by the ratio of cytosolic to mitochondrial signals in MEFs, however, the mitochondrial localization was incomplete. Next, we added degrons to the C terminus of mt-SRAI so that mistargeted products remaining in the cytosolic fraction could be efficiently cleared. We found that the addition of both CL1 (Gilon et al., 1998Gilon T. Chomsky O. Kulka R.G. Degradation signals for ubiquitin system proteolysis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2759-2766Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) and PEST (Ghoda et al., 1992Ghoda L. Sidney D. Macrae M. Coffino P. Structural elements of ornithine decarboxylase required for intracellular degradation and polyamine-dependent regulation.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2178-2185Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) (Figure 3A, mt-SRAI-CL1-PEST) was sufficient to achieve targeting specificity comparable to that of mt-mKeima (Katayama et al., 2011Katayama H.

We further increased the mitochondrial localization specificity of mito-SRAI using a tetracycline (Tet)-inducible gene expression system (Loew et al., 2010Loew R. Heinz N. Hampf M. Bujard H. Gossen M. Improved Tet-responsive promoters with minimized background expression.BMC Biotechnol. 2010; 10: 81Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) (Figure S3A).

(C and D) MEF cells were transiently transfected with the gene constructs shown in (A). Scale bars, 20 μm (B–D). A set of experiments with co-expression of Parkin demonstrated that the mito-SRAI ratiometric imaging identified mitophagic events that had been induced by carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) (Figures S3B–S3E). We performed confocal fluorescence imaging to characterize mito-SRAI signals in MEFs treated with 30 μM CCCP and found that the signals reached a plateau after > 12-h treatment (Figure S3B) and were exclusively localized in fluorescent dextran-labeled lysosomes (Figure S3C). We also verified that CCCP-induced mitophagy was well visualized and quantified by conventional fluorescence microscopy (Figure S3D) and flow cytometry (Figure S3E), respectively. To establish a reproducible expression system, we next generated a human glioblastoma H4 cell line that expressed mito-SRAI in a doxycycline (Dox)-dependent manner (H4/Tet-On:mito-SRAI) (Figure S4A). We then added the gene for the constitutive expression of human Parkin to generate H4/Tet-On:mito-SRAI/Parkin cells (Figure S4A). These cells were exposed to Dox for 48 h to induce transient expression of mito-SRAI. Subsequently, they were treated with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (vehicle) or 10 μM carbonyl cyanide-4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (FCCP) in the absence of Dox for 24 h prior to fixation. The ratio (TOLLES/YPet) was homogeneously low in the absence of Parkin expression (Figure 4A) or FCCP treatment (Figure 4B, left). By contrast, the ratio was significantly increased in H4/Tet-On:mito-SRAI/Parkin cells after treatment with 10 μM FCCP (Figure 4B, right); the frequency distribution was considerably shifted to the right, and the ratios corresponding to signals from the lysosomal environment were greater than 2 (Figure 4C). We used the area ratio of lysosomal to total signals as an index of mitophagy for quantitative analysis and were able to obtain a sigmoidal dose (FCCP concentration)-response (mitophagy index: MI) relationship with small standard deviations (Figure 4D). Such dependence on FCCP was tolerant of cell cycle arrest by AraC and mitomycin C (Figure S4B), suggesting that mito-SRAI may provide reliable mitophagy signals during screening for chemical libraries that potentially contain a variety of cell cycle dysregulators.Figure 4Reliable Measurement of Mitophagy by mito-SRAIShow full caption(A and B) Representative ratio (TOLLES/YPet) images of fixed H4/Tet-On:mito-SRAI cells (A) or H4/Tet-On:mito-SRAI/Parkin cells (B) after incubation with vehicle (left) or 10 μM FCCP (right).

https://openalex.org/W3026491932,"DNA bricks build nanotube transistors Semiconducting carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are an attractive platform for field-effect transistors (FETs) because they potentially can outperform silicon as dimensions shrink. Challenges to achieving superior performance include creating highly aligned and dense arrays of nanotubes as well as removing coatings that increase contact resistance. Sun et al. aligned CNTs by wrapping them with single-stranded DNA handles and binding them into DNA origami bricks that formed an array of channels with precise intertube pitches as small as 10.4 nanometers. Zhao et al. then constructed single and multichannel FETs by attaching the arrays to a polymer-templated silicon wafer. After adding metal contacts across the CNTs to fix them to the substrate, they washed away all of the DNA and then deposited electrodes and gate dielectrics. The FETs showed high on-state performance and fast on-off switching. Science , this issue p. 874 , p. 878"
https://openalex.org/W3028186685,"The primary objective of this study was to examine the impacts associated with implementation of overdose preventions sites (OPSs) in Victoria, Canada during a declared provincial public health overdose emergency. A rapid case study design was employed with three OPSs constituting the cases. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews with 15 staff, including experiential staff, and 12 service users. Theoretically, we were informed by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research. This framework, combined with a case study design, is well suited for generating insight into the impacts of an intervention. Zero deaths were identified as a key impact and indicator of success. The implementation of OPSs increased opportunities for early intervention in the event of an overdose, reducing trauma for staff and service users, and facilitated organizational transitions from provision of safer supplies to safer spaces. Providing a safer space meant drug use no longer needed to be concealed, with the effect of mitigating drug related stigma and facilitating a shift from shame and blame to increasing trust and development of relationships with increased opportunities to provide connections to other services. These impacts were achieved with few new resources highlighting the commitment of agencies and harm reduction workers, particularly those with lived experience, in achieving beneficial impacts. Although mitigating harms of overdose, OPSs do not address the root problem of an unsafe drug supply. OPSs are important life-saving interventions, but more is needed to address the current contamination of the illicit drug supply including provision of a safer supply."

Here, we show that bumble bee workers facing pollen scarcity damage leaves of flowerless plants and thereby accelerate flower production. Laboratory studies revealed that leaf-damaging behavior is strongly influenced by pollen availability and that bee-damaged plants flower significantly earlier than undamaged or mechanically damaged controls. Subsequent outdoor experiments showed that the intensity of damage inflicted varies with local flower availability; furthermore, workers from wild colonies of two additional bumble bee species were also observed to damage plant leaves. These findings elucidate a feature of bumble bee worker behavior that can influence the local availability of floral resources."

However, knowledge of and strict adherence to complicated protocols in order to produce accurate measurements can prohibit RCF from being widely adopted in the clinic. The purpose of this study was to outline some simple and straightforward RCF fundamentals in order to help clinical medical physicists perform accurate RCF measurements. We describe a process and methodology successfully used in our practice with the hope that it saves time and effort for others when implementing RCF in their clinics. Two RCF analysis software programs which differ in cost and complexity, the commercially available FilmQA Pro package and the freely available ImageJ software, were used to show the accuracy, consistency and limitations of each. The process described resulted in a majority of the measurements across a wide dose range to be accurate within ± 2% of the intended dose using either FilmQA Pro or ImageJ."
https://openalex.org/W3022641363,"General Practitioners (GPs) are expected to provide patients with health behaviour change interventions, yet little is known about the views of patients themselves. We aimed to understand recent patients’: (1) general expectations about GPs delivering health behaviour change interventions during routine consultations (including perceptions of appropriateness and helpfulness for receiving interventions), (2) perceptions of responsibility for GPs to talk about health behaviours, and (3) experiences of receiving behaviour change interventions. Twenty-four semi-structured interviews were conducted with people who had recently attended a routine GP consultation. Data were analysed thematically. Three major themes were identified: (1) acceptability of discussions about behaviour change, (2) establishing clinician-patient rapport, and (3) healthcare professionals as a credible source and well placed to offer behaviour change interventions. Most patients were positive about, and were willing to accept behaviour change interventions from their GP during a routine consultation. Although behaviour change was perceived as a sensitive topic for patients, the doctor-patient relationship was perceived to provide an effective platform to discuss behaviour change, with the GP perceived as an appropriate and important healthcare professional from whom to receive advice. Contrary to the views of GPs, behaviour change interventions were perceived by patients as appropriate and helpful during routine medical consultations, particularly where behaviour change could have a positive effect on long-term condition management. Behaviour change interventions delivered by GPs during routine consultations could be used effectively in time-restricted consultations."
https://openalex.org/W3000947669,"Experimental corn hybrids are created in plant breeding programs by crossing two parents, so-called inbred and tester, together. Identification of best parent combinations for crossing is challenging since the total number of possible cross combinations of parents is large and it is impractical to test all possible cross combinations due to limited resources of time and budget. In the 2020 Syngenta Crop Challenge, Syngenta released several large datasets that recorded the historical yield performances of around 4% of total cross combinations of 593 inbreds with 496 testers which were planted in 280 locations between 2016 and 2018 and asked participants to predict the yield performance of cross combinations of inbreds and testers that have not been planted based on the historical yield data collected from crossing other inbreds and testers. In this paper, we present a collaborative filtering method which is an ensemble of matrix factorization method and neural networks to solve this problem. Our computational results suggested that the proposed model significantly outperformed other models such as LASSO, random forest (RF), and neural networks. Presented method and results were produced within the 2020 Syngenta Crop Challenge."
https://openalex.org/W3026293297,"Background Previous researches have shown that anesthetic techniques can influence the patient outcomes of cancer surgery. Here, we studied the relationship between type of anesthetic and patient outcomes following elective, open pancreatic cancer surgery. Methods This was a retrospective cohort study of patients who received elective, open pancreatic cancer surgery between January 2005 and July 2018. Patients were grouped according to the anesthesia they received, namely desflurane or propofol. A Kaplan–Meier analysis was conducted, and survival curves were presented from the date of surgery to death. Univariable and multivariable Cox regression models were used to compare hazard ratios for death after propensity matching. Subgroup analyses were performed for all-cause mortality, cancer-specific mortality, and disease progression. Results A total of 68 patients (56 deaths, 82.0%) under desflurane anesthesia, and 72 patients (43 deaths, 60.0%) under propofol anesthesia were included. Fifty-eight patients remained in each group after propensity matching. The propofol anesthesia was associated with improved survival (hazard ratio, 0.65; 95% confidence interval, 0.42–0.99; P = 0.047) in the matched analysis. Subgroup analyses showed significantly better cancer-specific survival (hazard ratio, 0.63; 95% confidence interval, 0.40–0.97; P = 0.037) in the propofol group. Additionally, patients under propofol had less postoperative recurrence, but not fewer postoperative metastases formation, than those under desflurane (hazard ratio, 0.55; 95% confidence interval, 0.34–0.90; P = 0.028) in the matched analysis. Conclusions In a limited sample size, we observed that propofol anesthesia was associated with improved survival in open pancreatic cancer surgery compared with desflurane anesthesia. Further investigations are needed to inspect the influences of propofol anesthesia on patient outcomes of pancreatic cancer surgery."

https://openalex.org/W3026358839,"Previous evidence suggests that modifiable lifestyle factors, such as engagement in leisure activities, might slow the age-related decline of cognitive functions. Less is known, however, about which aspects of lifestyle might be particularly beneficial to healthy cognitive ageing, and whether they are associated with distinct cognitive domains (e.g. fluid and crystallized abilities) differentially. We investigated these questions in the cross-sectional Cambridge Centre for Ageing and Neuroscience (Cam-CAN) data (N = 708, age 18–88), using data-driven exploratory structural equation modelling, confirmatory factor analyses, and age-residualized measures of cognitive differences across the lifespan. Specifically, we assessed the relative associations of the following five lifestyle factors on age-related differences of fluid and crystallized age-adjusted abilities: education/SES, physical health, mental health, social engagement, and intellectual engagement. We found that higher education, better physical and mental health, more social engagement and a greater degree of intellectual engagement were each individually correlated with better fluid and crystallized cognitive age-adjusted abilities. A joint path model of all lifestyle factors on crystallized and fluid abilities, which allowed a simultaneous assessment of the lifestyle domains, showed that physical health, social and intellectual engagement and education/SES explained unique, complementary variance, but mental health did not make significant contributions above and beyond the other four lifestyle factors and age. The total variance explained for fluid abilities was 14% and 16% for crystallized abilities. Our results are compatible with the hypothesis that intellectually and physically challenging as well as socially engaging activities are associated with better crystallized and fluid performance across the lifespan."
https://openalex.org/W3027599578,"Objective To investigate the value of CEP55 as a diagnostic marker and independent prognostic factor in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), and to analyze its co-expression genes and related signaling pathways. Methods TCGA database and GEO database were used to analyze the expression of CEP55 in LUAD and LUSC compared with normal tissues. The co-expression genes of CEP55 in LUAD and LUSC were excavated by cBioPortal and enriched by KEGG and GO. Establishing Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to evaluate the value of CEP55 as a diagnostic and prognostic factor. The association between CEP55 expression and the clinicopathological features was evaluated using χ2 tests. ROC curves for diagnosis and prognosis detection were constructed. Prognostic values were analyzed by univariate and multivariate Cox regression models. Results Compared with normal lung tissues, CEP55 expression was significantly upregulated in both LUAD and LUSC. ROC curve analysis showed that CEP55 could be used as an effective diagnostic target for LUAD (AUC = 0.969) and LUSC (AUC = 0.994). When CEP55 gene was selected as an independent prognostic factor, high expression of CEP55 was more disadvantageous to OS and RFS of LUAD patients (P<0.05), but no significant difference was found in LUSC patients (P>0.05). The number of co-expression genes of CEP55 in LUAD is more than that in LUSC, and is related to cell cycle, DNA replication and P53 signaling pathway. Conclusion CEP55 can be used as a diagnostic marker for LUAD and LUSC, but only as an independent prognostic factor for LUAD rather than LUSC."
https://openalex.org/W3028027817,"Environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis has gained traction as a precise and cost-effective method for species and waterways management. To date, publications on eDNA protocol optimization have focused primarily on DNA yield. Therefore, it has not been possible to evaluate the cost and speed of specific components of the eDNA protocol, such as water filtration and DNA extraction method when designing or choosing an eDNA protocol. At the same time, these two parameters are essential for the experimental design of a project. Here we evaluate and rank 27 different eDNA protocols in the context of Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) eDNA detection in an estuarine environment. We present a comprehensive evaluation of multiple eDNA protocol parameters, balancing time, cost and DNA yield. We collected samples composed of 500 mL estuarine water from Deverton Slough (38°11'16.7""N 121°58'34.5""W) and 500 mL from tank water containing 1.3 juvenile Chinook Salmon per liter. Then, we compared extraction methods, filter types, use of inhibitor removal kit for DNA yield, processing time, and protocol cost. Lastly, we used an MCMC algorithm together with machine learning to understand the DNA yield of each step of the protocol as well as the interactions between those steps. Glass fiber filtration was to be the most resilient to high turbidites, filtering the samples in 2.32 ± 0.08 min instead of 14.16 ± 1.86 min and 6.72 ± 1.99 min for nitrocellulose and paper filter N1, respectively. The filtration DNA yield percentages for paper filter N1, glass fiber, and nitrocellulose were 0.00045 ± 0.00013, 0.00107 ± 0.00013, 0.00172 ± 0.00013. The DNA extraction yield percentage for QIagen, dipstick, NaOH, magnetic beads, and direct dipstick ranged from 0.047 ± 0.0388 to 0.475 ± 0.0357. For estuarine waters, which are challenging for eDNA studies due to high turbidity, variable salinity, and the presence of PCR inhibitors, we found that a protocol combining glass filters, magnetic beads, and an extra step for PCR inhibitor removal, is the method that best balances time, cost, and yield. In addition, we provide a generalized decision tree for determining the optimal eDNA protocol for other studies in aquatic systems. Our findings should be applicable to most aquatic environments and provide a clear guide for determining which eDNA protocol should be used under different study constraints."

A personalized model of care can have a significant impact on the overall organizational culture in aged care homes. However, the dimensions of personalized aged care relating to dementia often remain under-managed. We aim to explore the factors that shape the dimensions of personalized dementia care in rural nursing homes using qualitative data of a mixed-method ‘Harmony in the Bush’ dementia study. The study participants included clinical managers, registered nurses, enrolled nurses and care workers from five rural aged care homes in Queensland and South Australia. One hundred and four staff participated in 65 semi-structured interviews and 20 focus groups at three phases: post-intervention, one-month follow-up and three-months follow-up. A multidimensional model of nursing home care quality developed by Rantz et al. (1998) was used in data coding and analysis of the factors. Three key themes including seven dimensions emerged from the findings: resident and family [resident and family centeredness, and assessment and care planning]; staff [staff education and training, staff-resident interaction and work-life balance]; and organization [leadership and organizational culture, and physical environment and safety]. A lack of consideration of family members views by management and staff, together with poorly integrated, holistic care plan, limited resources and absence of ongoing education for staff, resulted in an ineffective implementation of personalized dementia care. Understanding the dimensions and associated factors may assist in interpreting the multidimensional aspects of personalized approach in dementia care. Staff training on person-centered approach, assessment and plan, and building relationships among and between staff and residents are essential to improve the quality of care residents receive."

The aim of the study was to analyse the public health and economic impact of replacing TIV with QIV in different scenarios in Spain.A dynamic transmission model was developed to estimate the number of influenza B cases prevented under TIV and QIV strategies (<65 years (high risk) and ≥65 years). This model considers cross-protective immunity induced by different lineages of influenza B. The output of the transmission model was used as input for a decision tree model that estimated the economic impact of switching TIV to QIV. The models were populated with Spanish data whenever possible. Deterministic univariate and probabilistic multivariate sensitivity analyses were performed.Replacing TIV with QIV in all eligible patients with current vaccine coverage in Spain may have prevented 138,707 influenza B cases per season and, therefore avoided 10,748 outpatient visits, 3,179 hospitalizations and 192 deaths. The replacement could save €532,768 in outpatient visit costs, €13 million in hospitalization costs, and €3 million in costs of influenza-related deaths per year. An additional €5 million costs associated with productivity loss could be saved per year, from the societal perspective. The budget impact from societal perspective would be €6.5 million, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) €1,527 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Sensitivity analyses showed robust results. In additional scenarios, QIV also showed an impact at public health level reducing influenza B related cases, outpatient visits, hospitalizations and deaths.Our results show public health and economic benefits for influenza prevention with QIV. It would be an efficient intervention for the Spanish National Health Service with major health benefits especially in the population ≥65-year."

However, the driving alterations that underlie the broad dysregulation of ASEs are incompletely defined. Using head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) as a model, we hypothesized that the genomic alteration of genes associated with the spliceosome may broadly induce ASEs across a broad range of target genes, driving an oncogenic phenotype. We identified 319 spliceosome genes and employed a discovery pipeline to identify 13 candidate spliceosome genes altered in HNSCC using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) HNSCC data. Phenotypic screens identified amplified and overexpressed CPSF1 as a target gene alteration that was validated in proliferation, colony formation, and apoptosis assays in cell line and xenograft systems as well as in primary HNSCC. We employed knockdown and overexpression assays followed by identification of ASEs regulated by CPSF1 overexpression to identify changes in ASEs, and the expression of these ASEs was validated using RNA from cell line models. Alterations in expression of spliceosome genes, including CPSF1, may contribute to HNSCC by mediating aberrant ASE expression."

The K6 was translated into the Vietnamese language following a standard procedure. A survey was conducted of nurses in a large general hospital in Hanoi, Vietnam, using a questionnaire including the Vietnamese K6, other scales (DASS21, health-related QOL, self-rated health, and psychosocial work environment), and questions about demographic variables. Internal consistency reliability (Cronbach’s alpha coefficient) was calculated. A confirmatory factor analysis was conducted. Eleven hypotheses were tested (as Pearson’s correlations with the K6) to assess the scale’s construct validity. Item response theory (IRT) analysis was conducted to identify the item response characteristics. The Cronbach’s alpha coefficient was 0.864. The explanatory and confirmatory factor analyses indicated a one-factor structure. Most hypotheses tested for construct validity were supported. IRT analysis indicated that response categories were located in order according to severity. K6 provided reliable information regarding higher levels of psychological distress. The findings suggest that the Vietnamese version of the K6 is a reliable and valid instrument to measure psychological distress among hospital nurses in Vietnam."

Does market segmentation necessarily impair energy efficiency? Considering the critical role that Chinaese government play in managing erergy efficiency, we propose a non-linear relationship between market segmentation and energy efficiency. Using data of 30 provinces in Mainland China during 2000 to 2017, we find an inverse U-shaped relationship between market segmentation and energy efficiency. Our findings remain robust after controlling endogeneity issues. Therefore, a moderate level of market segmentation is acceptable and beneficial for long-term improvement of energy efficiency in emerging economies."
https://openalex.org/W3027814518,"The accuracy of the DNA barcoding tool depends on the existence of a comprehensive archived library of sequences reliably determined at species level by expert taxonomists. However, misidentifications are not infrequent, especially following large-scale DNA barcoding campaigns on diverse and taxonomically complex groups. In this study we used the species-rich flea beetle genus Longitarsus, that requires a high level of expertise for morphological species identification, as a case study to assess the accuracy of the DNA barcoding tool following several optimization procedures. We built a cox1 reference database of 1502 sequences representing 78 Longitarsus species, among which 117 sequences (32 species) were newly generated using a non-invasive DNA extraction method that allows keeping reference voucher specimens. Within this dataset we identified 69 taxonomic inconsistencies using barcoding gap analysis and tree topology methods. Threshold optimisation and a posteriori taxonomic revision based on newly generated reference sequences and metadata allowed resolving 44 sequences with ambiguous and incorrect identification and provided a significant improvement of the DNA barcoding accuracy and identification efficacy. Unresolved taxonomic uncertainties, due to overlapping intra- and inter-specific levels of divergences, mainly regards the Longitarsus pratensis species complex and polyphyletic groups L. melanocephalus, L. nigrofasciatus and L. erro. Such type of errors indicates either poorly established taxonomy or any biological processes that make mtDNA groups poorly predictive of species boundaries (e.g. recent speciation or interspecific hybridisation), thus providing directions for further integrative taxonomic and evolutionary studies. Overall, this study underlines the importance of reference vouchers and high-quality metadata associated to sequences in reference databases and corroborates, once again, the key role of taxonomists in any step of the DNA barcoding pipeline in order to generate and maintain a correct and functional reference library."
https://openalex.org/W3028421556,"The contribution of astrocytes to the BOLD fMRI and DfMRI responses in visual cortex of mice following visual stimulation was investigated using TGN-020, an aquaporin 4 (AQP4) channel blocker, acting as an astrocyte function perturbator. Under TGN-020 injection the amplitude of the BOLD fMRI response became significantly higher. In contrast no significant changes in the DfMRI responses and the electrophysiological responses were observed. Those results further confirm the implications of astrocytes in the neurovascular coupling mechanism underlying BOLD fMRI, but not in the DfMRI responses which remained unsensitive to astrocyte function perturbation."
https://openalex.org/W3027983743,"An outbreak of Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) transmitted by the brown dog tick (Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu lato) has emerged as a major human and animal health concern in Mexicali, Mexico. Due to high rates of brown dog tick infestation, susceptibility, and association with humans, dogs serve as sentinels and have a key role in the ecology of RMSF. A cross-sectional household questionnaire study was conducted in six rural and urban locations to characterize dog ecology and demography in RMSF high-and low-risk areas of Mexicali. In addition, we tracked movement patterns of 16 dogs using a GPS data logger. Of 253 households, 73% owned dogs, and dog ownership tended to be higher in high-risk areas, with a mean dog:human ratio of 0.43, compared with 0.3 in low-risk areas. Dogs in high-risk areas had higher fecundity and roamed more, but the dog density and numbers of free-roaming dogs were comparable. There was a higher proportion of younger dogs and lower proportion of older dogs in high-risk areas. The high proportion of immunologically naïve puppies in high risk areas could result in a lack of herd immunity leading to a more vulnerable dog and human population. The marked increase of space use of free-roaming dogs in high-risk areas suggests that unrestrained dogs could play an important role in spreading ticks and pathogens. As means to limit RMSF risk, practical changes could include increased efforts for spay-neuter and policies encouraging dog restraint to limit canine roaming and spread of ticks across communities; due to dog density is less impactful such policies may be more useful than restrictions on the number of owned dogs."
https://openalex.org/W3027478169,"Photoaging, the premature aging of skin induced by ultraviolet rays, is characterized by wrinkling, roughness, laxity, and pigmentary changes. Various natural and synthetic retinoids have been explored for the treatment of aging. Among retinoids, adapalene (Ada, 0.3%) is one of the most potent and widely used drugs to treat photoaging. However, it causes irritant reactions that limit its acceptance by patients. Several studies have shown the applicability of Lysozyme (Lys)-shelled microbubbles (MBs) for drug delivery through sonophoresis, and recently we have shown its efficiency to treat inflammatory skin disease. Here, we report the construction of novel Ada-LysMBs based on opposite electric charges for combined effects to treat photoaging. The Ada-LysMBs were self-assembled and had a mean diameter of 2857 nm. The maximum loading efficiency of Ada onto LysMBs was 13.99 ± 0.59%. An acoustic power density of 3 W/cm2 for 1 min revealing maximum penetration depth of LysMBs was optimized for further in vitro and in vivo studies of Ada-LysMBs. It was observed that in vitro Ada release from Ada-LysMBs at 6 h after ultrasound (US) treatment was more rapid at pH 7.4 (82%) than at pH 5.5 (73%). Franz diffusion experiments on isolated porcine skin indicated that US approximately doubled Ada delivery by Ada-LysMBs and Ada + LysMBs at 12 h and six-fold Lys permeation by LysMBs at 6 h, compared to these treatments alone. A 5-week in vivo study in mice identified significant wrinkle reduction in animals treated with US plus Ada-LysMBs. Our findings indicate that US may be used with Ada-LysMBs in the water phase to treat photoaging by normalizing hyperkeratinization and promoting collagen synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W3028312615,"Background Advances in earth observation and machine learning techniques have created new options for forest monitoring, primarily because of the various possibilities that they provide for classifying forest cover and estimating aboveground biomass (AGB). Methods This study aimed to introduce a novel model that incorporates the atom search algorithm (ASO) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) into mangrove forest classification and AGB estimation. The Ca Mau coastal area was selected as a case study since it has been considered the most preserved mangrove forest area in Vietnam and is being investigated for the impacts of land-use change on forest quality. The model was trained and validated with a set of Sentinel-1A imagery with VH and VV polarizations, and multispectral information from the SPOT image. In addition, feature selection was also carried out to choose the optimal combination of predictor variables. The model performance was benchmarked against conventional methods, such as support vector regression, multilayer perceptron, random subspace, and random forest, by using statistical indicators, namely, root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and coefficient of determination (R2). Results The results showed that all three indicators of the proposed model were statistically better than those from the benchmarked methods. Specifically, the hybrid model ended up at RMSE = 70.882, MAE = 55.458, R2 = 0.577 for AGB estimation. Conclusion From the experiments, such hybrid integration can be recommended for use as an alternative solution for biomass estimation. In a broader context, the fast growth of metaheuristic search algorithms has created new scientifically sound solutions for better analysis of forest cover."
https://openalex.org/W3028450884,"Salt is an essential nutrient; however, excessive salt intake is a prominent public health concern worldwide. Various physiological functions are associated with circadian rhythms, and disruption of circadian rhythms is a prominent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and immune disease. Certain nutrients are vital regulators of peripheral circadian clocks. However, the role of a high-fat and high-salt (HFS) diet in the regulation of circadian gene expression is unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effect of an HFS diet on rhythms of locomotor activity, caecum glucocorticoid secretion, and clock gene expression in mice. Mice administered an HFS diet displayed reduced locomotor activity under normal light/dark and constant dark conditions in comparison with those administered a normal diet. The diurnal rhythm of caecum glucocorticoid secretion and the expression levels of glucocorticoid-related genes and clock genes in the adrenal gland were disrupted with an HFS diet. These results suggest that an HFS diet alters locomotor activity, disrupts circadian rhythms of glucocorticoid secretion, and downregulates peripheral adrenal gland circadian clock genes."
https://openalex.org/W3026285282,"Background Many biological, social and cultural barriers for suboptimal breastfeeding practices have been identified in literature. Among these, excessive pre-pregnancy weight has been identified as a risk factor for not initiating breastfeeding early. Social support, coming from social networks (e.g. a partner, family or friends) or health care providers, has been positively associated with breastfeeding. This study aimed to examine the association between pre-pregnancy excessive weight and breastfeeding within the first hour after birth and if social support modifies this association. Design National population-based study conducted with 21,086 postpartum women from February 1, 2011 to October 31, 2012 in 266 hospitals from all five regions of Brazil. Social support was defined as having a companion at the hospital. Main effects and interactions were tested with multivariable regression analyses. Results Multivariate regression analyses indicated that class I and class II obese women had lower odds of breastfeeding within the first hour when a companion was not present (AOR = 0.59, 95% CI 0.42–0.82 and AOR = 0.59, 95% CI 0.36–0.97, respectively), but there was no association when the companion was present. Among overweight and obese women, the predicted probability of breastfeeding within the first hour was lower for those without a companion. This association was not found among those with normal pre-pregnancy BMI. Conclusions Social support modifies the relationship between pre-gestational BMI and breastfeeding initiation among women who are overweight or obese, specifically it reduces the risk of delayed breastfeeding initiation."
https://openalex.org/W3027093810,"The presence of selenium in European soil is low and this causes its deficiency in livestock and, in consequence, in humans. This study aimed to obtain Lentinula (L.) edodes mycelium with the maximum content of selenium. This species was used for experiment based on its documented medicinal properties. Calves were fed with selenium-enriched L. edodes mycelium, and serum selenium concentration, average daily weight gains and selected immune parameters were estimated. The selenium-enriched mushroom was found to be safe based on cytotoxicity tests (MTT and LDH tests) and for this reason it was used for further experiments. The mean quantity of selenium in the serum of calves fed with selenium-enriched L. edodes mycelium was significantly higher than that of control calves. Additionally, the calves fed with selenium-enriched L. edodes mycelium had higher body weight gains than those of control calves. White blood cell counts and subpopulations of lymphocytes in the experimental and control calves were within the reference range. The administration of L. edodes enriched with selenium had a beneficial effect on state of health of the calves."
https://openalex.org/W3028249835,"When exposed to fluctuating light intensity, chloroplasts move towards weak light (accumulation response), and away from strong light (avoidance response). In addition, cold treatment (5°C) induces the avoidance response even under weak-light conditions (cold-avoidance response). These three responses are mediated by the phototropin (phot), which is a blue-light photoreceptor and has also been reported to act as a thermosensory protein that perceives temperature variation. Our previous report indicated that cold-induced changes in phot biochemical activity initiate the cold-avoidance response. In this study, we further explored the induction mechanism of the cold-avoidance response in the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha and examined the relationship between changes in the amount of phot and the induction of the cold-avoidance response. The switch between the accumulation and avoidance responses occurs at a so-called 'transitional' light intensity. Our physiological experiments revealed that a cold-mediated decrease in the transitional light intensity leads to the induction of the cold-avoidance response. While artificial overexpression of phot decreased the transitional light intensity as much as cold treatment did, the amount of endogenous phot was not increased by cold treatment in wild-type M. polymorpha. Taken together, these findings show that the cold-avoidance response is initiated by a cold-mediated reduction of the transitional light intensity, independent of the amount of endogenous phot. This study provides a clue to understanding the mechanism underlying the switch in direction of chloroplast relocation in response to light and temperature."
https://openalex.org/W3026648937,"Supplementing endangered fish populations with captive bred individuals is a common practice in conservation management. The aim of supplementary releases from hatchery broodstocks is to maintain the viability of populations by maintaining their genetic diversity. Landlocked Lake Saimaa salmon (Salmo salar m. sebago) has been critically endangered for the past half-century. As a result of anthropogenic disturbance, especially construction of hydroelectric power plants, the Lake Saimaa salmon has become completely dependent on hatchery broodstock. Recently, habitat restoration has been done in one of the former spawning rivers with the aim of creating a new natural spawning ground for the critically endangered population. Hatchery fish releases have also been revised so that in addition to juveniles, adult fish from the hatchery and from the wild have been released into the restored river. We assessed here if a restored river stretch can be used as a natural spawning ground and juvenile production area with the aim of improving genetic diversity of the critically endangered Lake Saimaa salmon. By constructing a pedigree of the released adults, and juveniles sampled from the restored river, we found that the majority of the released adults had produced offspring in the river. We also found that wild-caught spawners that were released into the restored river had much higher reproductive success than hatchery-reared parents that were released into the restored river at the same time. We found no significant differences in genetic diversity between the parent and offspring generations. Meanwhile, relatedness among different groups of adults and juveniles varied a lot. For example, while the hatchery-reared females were on average half-siblings, wild-caught females showed no significant relatedness. This highlights the importance of using pedigree information in planning the conservation and management of endangered populations, especially when artificial propagation is involved."
https://openalex.org/W3026529271,"Recovery from perturbations during walking is primarily mediated by reactive control strategies that coordinate multiple body segments to maintain balance. Balance control is often impaired in clinical populations who walk with spatiotemporally asymmetric gait, and, as a result, rehabilitation efforts often seek to reduce asymmetries in these populations. Previous work has demonstrated that the presence of spatiotemporal asymmetries during walking does not impair the control of whole-body dynamics during perturbation recovery. However, it remains to be seen how the neuromotor system adjusts intersegmental coordination patterns to maintain invariant whole-body dynamics. Here, we determined if the neuromotor system generates stereotypical coordination patterns irrespective of the level of asymmetry or if the neuromotor system allows for variance in intersegmental coordination patterns to stabilize whole-body dynamics in the sagittal plane. Nineteen healthy participants walked on a dual-belt treadmill at a range of step length asymmetries, and they responded to unpredictable, slip-like perturbations. We used principal component analysis of segmental angular momenta to characterize intersegmental coordination patterns before, during, and after imposed perturbations. We found that two principal components were sufficient to explain ~ 95% of the variance in segmental angular momentum during both steady-state walking and responses to perturbations. Our results also revealed that walking with asymmetric step lengths led to changes in intersegmental coordination patterns during the perturbation and during subsequent recovery steps without affecting whole-body angular momentum. These results suggest that the nervous system allows for variance in segment-level coordination patterns to maintain invariant control of whole-body angular momentum during walking. Future studies exploring how these segmental coordination patterns change in individuals with asymmetries that result from neuromotor impairments can provide further insight into how the healthy and impaired nervous system regulates dynamic balance during walking."
https://openalex.org/W3027569740,"Fresh corneal donation is essential for basic and preclinical research, but more unknown to public and the medical teams than donation for transplantation: it may raise concerns. We prospectively compared the acceptance rates and the characteristics of targeted corneal donation for research versus donation for transplantation during one year. The Agence de la Biomédecine authorized us to procure fresh corneas targeted for research, only from the donors with medical contraindications for transplantation, in order not to increase grafts shortage. Three nurses from the hospital coordination team of Saint-Etienne University Hospital, obtained consent for research and transplantation in parallel, screening all intra-hospital deaths cases, following standard protocol to check no refusal from families, despite the French opt-out system. They contacted 127 families for research and 244 for transplantation, in 71% of cases by telephone. Consent was obtained in 62% of cases for research and 54% for transplantation (P = 0.135). The main contraindication for transplantation was the cognitive disorders (66%) followed by the blood cancers (8%). This new specific activity, providing new source of fresh corneas for research immediately usable without any eyebank storage steps, didn't reduce the number of corneas procured for transplantation versus previous years (P = 0.998). Donors in the research group were 10 years older (P<0.001) without difference regarding endothelial cell quality (P = 0.071), allowing maximal clinical relevance for protocols using these fresh human scientific corneas provided by targeted donation."

https://openalex.org/W3026703230,"The coastal vegetation of islands is expected to be affected by future sea-level rise and other anthropogenic impacts. The biodiverse coastal vegetation on the eastern part of the Dutch Wadden Island of Ameland has experienced land subsidence caused by gas extraction since 1986. This subsidence mimics future sea-level rising through increased flooding and raising groundwater levels. We studied the effects of this relative sea-level rise and other environmental factors (i.e. insect outbreaks, temperature and precipitation) on the population dynamics (i.e. cover and age structure and annual growth) of the shrub sea-buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides L.) in young (formed after 1950) and old (formed before 1950) dune areas over a period of 56 years (1959-2015). We found an increase in sea-buckthorn cover in the young dune areas since 1959, while over time the population in the old dunes decreased due to successional replacement by other species. With the increasing age of the young dunes, we found also a decrease in sea-buckthorn after 2009. However the sharp decrease indicated that other environmental factors were also involved. The most important determinant of annual shrub growth appeared to be five outbreaks of the brown-tail moth (Euproctis chrysorrhoea L.), in the last decade. Relative sea-level rise caused more frequent flooding and reduced growth at lower elevations due to inundation or soil water saturation. This study clearly indicates that sea-buckthorn is affected by relative sea-level rise, but that other ecological events better explain its variation in growth. Although shrub distribution and growth can be monitored with robust methods, future predictions of vegetation dynamics are complicated by unpredictable extreme events caused by (a)biotic stressors such as insect outbreaks."

Analysing these spatial relations is essential to allocate the socio-economic impact of the fishing activity into the relevant coastal communities. In addition, such spatial information gives the possibility, on the one hand, to assess the impacts from fisheries on the marine environment and, on the other, to manage competing uses of the sea space between different activities. In this paper, we use AIS data, which is individual vessels' positioning data, to examine the activity of the EU large-scale fishing fleets, their home ports, high intensity fishing areas (i.e., main fishing grounds), main ports and coastal communities involved."
https://openalex.org/W3027203038,"Pad Thai, a Thai dish of stir-fried rice noodles and other ingredients, is one of the culinary heritages of Thailand. In the southern region of Thailand, Pad Thai has different characteristics from other areas because coconut milk and curry paste are used to produce a thick sauce prior to cooking. To commercially distribute this uniquely local culinary treat in a convenient form all over Thailand and other export markets, a shelf-stable sauce using heat sterilization should be developed. Retort processing technology with retort pouches can be used for this purpose. However, phase separation and lipid oxidation can occur and subsequently reduce the overall quality of retorted southern-style Pad Thai sauce. The application of an appropriate stabilizer and antioxidant can be used to prevent such problems. Thus, the objective of this study was to investigate the effects of stabilizers and antioxidants on the stability of retorted southern-style Pad Thai sauce. Southern-style Pad Thai sauce was prepared according to the traditional recipe in the presence of different stabilizers (2.3% potato starch (PS) + 0.1% xanthan gum (XG), 0.5% soy lecithin (LT), and 4% whey protein isolate (WPI)) and antioxidants (500 mg/kg ascorbyl palmitate + 500 mg/kg α-tocopherol (As + Toc), 100 mg/kg ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 200 mg/kg butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), and As+Toc+EDTA+BHT (mixed antioxidants)). Samples were packed in retort pouches and processed in a retort at 121°C with an F0 value of 3.57 min. Results showed that the retorted southern-style Pad Thai sauce can be stabilized by 2.3% PS plus 0.1% XG in combination with mixed antioxidants. PS and XG helped stabilize the sauce with a desirable viscosity, water holding capacity, and color without any creaming layer and negative effect on sensory properties. Mixed antioxidants improved the oxidative stability of the retorted sauce by retarding the changes in the peroxide value and color during retorting. Consequently, the processing of southern-style Pad Thai sauce in retortable pouches could increase the market demand for this traditional product due to its convenience and ready-to-use features."
https://openalex.org/W3026585895,"Posttranscriptional regulation plays a fundamental role in the biology of embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Many studies have demonstrated that multiple mRNAs are coregulated by one or more RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) that orchestrate mRNA expression. A family of RBPs, which is known as the Pumilio-FBF (PUF) family, is highly conserved among different species and has been associated with the undifferentiated and differentiated states of different cell lines. In humans, two homologs of the PUF family have been found: Pumilio 1 (PUM1) and Pumilio 2 (PUM2). To understand the role of these proteins in human ESCs (hESCs), we first assessed the influence of the silencing of PUM1 and PUM2 on pluripotency genes and found that the knockdown of Pumilio genes significantly decreased the OCT4 and NANOG mRNA levels and reduced the amount of nuclear OCT4, which suggests that Pumilio proteins play a role in the maintenance of pluripotency in hESCs. Furthermore, we observed that PUM1-and-PUM2-silenced hESCs exhibited improved efficiency of in vitro cardiomyogenic differentiation. Through an in silico analysis, we identified mRNA targets of PUM1 and PUM2 that are expressed at the early stages of cardiomyogenesis, and further investigation will determine whether these target mRNAs are active and involved in the progression of cardiomyogenesis. Our findings contribute to the understanding of the role of Pumilio proteins in hESC maintenance and differentiation."

https://openalex.org/W3027459088,"John Horton Conway, renowned mathematician of legendary creativity, died on 11 April at age 82. Conway's playful approach to mathematics is visible in his game-changing contributions to a wide variety of mathematical fields. Conway was also a celebrated and gifted educator whose enthusiasm, charisma, and inventiveness captured the public's imagination.

Conway was born in Liverpool, England, on 26 December 1937. He received his mathematics degrees from the University of Cambridge: a bachelor's degree in 1959 and a Ph.D. 5 years later. He was subsequently hired by the university as an assistant lecturer, eventually rising to the rank of professor. In 1987, he accepted a position as the John von Neumann Professor in Applied and Computational Mathematics at Princeton University in Princeton, New Jersey, where he remained for the rest of his career.

Conway's first big mathematical breakthrough, in 1968, was the determination of the more than eight quintillion symmetries of the Leech lattice, an astonishingly symmetric mathematical structure that governs the tightest and most efficient way to pack spheres together in 24 dimensions. (Think of an array of stacked oranges in a grocery store, except the oranges are 24-dimensional and each one touches exactly 196,560 other oranges.) Through these investigations in the field of group theory, Conway discovered several additional groups, including 3 of the 26 so-called sporadic groups, which play an important role in mathematical physics and the theory of error-correcting codes.

Conway later spearheaded a collaboration that resulted in the Atlas of Finite Groups , one of the most important (and longest) books ever written on group theory. Together with Atlas coauthor Simon Norton, Conway put forth a series of fascinating conjectures relating the largest of the sporadic groups (which Conway dubbed “The Monster”) to the theory of modular forms, a previously unrelated subject arising in complex variables and number theory. These conjectures became known as “Monstrous Moonshine,” and Conway's former Ph.D. student Richard Borcherds won the prestigious Fields Medal for verifying them.

Conway's most famous invention was undoubtedly the Game of Life. An example of what is now called a cellular automaton, this game uses simple rules that lead to wildly unpredictable behavior. A Scientific American column written by Conway's lifelong friend and champion Martin Gardner turbocharged the game's popularity and vaulted Conway to international prominence. The simulation became a frequent pastime for budding computer programmers at the dawn of the age of personal computers.

Conway's proudest mathematical moment came about when he parlayed his study of the winning strategies for certain two-player games into the invention of surreal numbers. These numbers contain not only all real numbers (i.e., infinite decimals such as pi or the square root of 2) but also a staggering cornucopia of new numbers, some infinitely large and some infinitely small. The unification of infinite set theory and the theory of combinatorial games that resulted from this work was hailed by Gardner as “an astonishing feat of legerdemain.”



Conway made numerous other contributions to mathematics in a dizzying array of fields. In topology, the Conway polynomial is a fundamental tool for studying knots. In geometry, Conway and mathematician and computer scientist Michael Guy generalized Archimedes' classical enumeration of the 13 three-dimensional so-called “Archimedean solids” to four dimensions. In number theory, Conway and his student William Schneeberger discovered an important and unexpected result called the “15 theorem” and formulated a conjectural generalization (the “290 theorem”), which was later proved correct. In theoretical physics, Conway and mathematician Simon Kochen proved a striking result in quantum mechanics that they christened the “free will theorem.” Conway phrased the result in layman's terms as follows: “If experimenters have free will, then so do elementary particles.”

Conway was a captivating teacher. He spent 2 weeks every summer with aspiring young mathematicians at the Canada/USA Mathcamp, where he would give spontaneous lectures on whatever mathematical subject the students requested. His lectures at Cambridge, and later Princeton, were famously idiosyncratic. He would balance objects on his chin, perform magic tricks with a piece of rope, recite the digits of pi (he had memorized more than 1000 of them), and regale students with his astounding knowledge of etymology (a lifelong passion).

I knew Conway through the biennial Gathering 4 Gardner Conference. His notoriously outsized ego was occasionally off-putting, but in the words of biographer Siobhan Roberts, “Conway's is a jocund and playful egomania, sweetened by self-deprecating charm.” Once, while visiting Princeton, I ran into Conway, and we ended up chatting for almost 2 hours about different methods for mentally calculating the day of the week for any given date. Conway's astounding speed (in his prime, he could do it in under 2 seconds) made a convincing case for his own doomsday rule, one of his famous contributions to recreational mathematics.

Despite his considerable erudition and numerous mathematical awards, Conway referred to himself as a “professional nonunderstander,” claiming that he only comprehended things after thinking “for ages and [making] them very, very simple.” He followed his insatiably peripatetic curiosity no matter its direction, and the professional success he achieved in this way led him to adopt the dictum: “Thou shalt stop worrying and feeling guilty; thou shalt do whatever thou pleasest.” Another of Conway's guiding principles was to always go multiple steps beyond what any reasonable person would do.

In addition to his scientific breakthroughs, Conway transformed the public perception of mathematics. His singularly creative ideas have inspired generations of mathematicians. Although “recreational mathematics” may seem like an oxymoron to some, the term perfectly captures Conway's joyful approach to both serious and recreational mathematical discoveries."
