Here we show that, whereas Stella-positive ESCs were like the inner cell mass (ICM), Stella-negative cells were like the epiblast cells. These states were interchangeable, which reflects the metastability and plasticity of ESCs. The established equilibrium was skewed reversibly in the absence of signals from feeder cells, which caused a marked shift toward an epiblast-like state, while trichostatin A, an inhibitor of histone deactelylase, restored Stella-positive population. The two populations also showed different histone modifications and striking functional differences, as judged by their potential for differentiation. The Stella-negative ESCs were more like the postimplantation epiblast-derived stem cells (EpiSCs), albeit the stella locus was repressed by DNA methylation in the latter, which signifies a robust epigenetic boundary between ESCs and EpiSCs.

Mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) exhibit a degree of similarity with three different transient cell populations in the mouse embryo: the inner cell mass (ICM) of blastocysts, the epiblast cells of early postimplantation embryos, and primordial germ cells (PGCs), which includes expression of pluripotency marker genes, such as Oct4 (Chambers and Smith, 2004Chambers I.

However, unlike the cells in vivo, ESCs retain pluripotency and exhibit the capacity for indefinite self-renewal, while the cells in vivo undergo differentiation according to a strict developmental program. As long as ESCs are cultured in an appropriate medium, such as the one containing leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and with either serum or bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4), they can undergo self-renewal without compromising pluripotency (Ying et al., 2003Ying Q.L.

For this reason, ESCs are generally regarded as a homogeneous group of cells in the majority of studies. However, the precise provenance of ESCs for which there is no strict in vivo equivalent remains to be fully elucidated. Based on some recent studies, it has been suggested that germ cells may be the closest in vivo equivalent of ESCs (Zwaka and Thomson, 2005Zwaka T.P. Thomson J.A. A germ cell origin of embryonic stem cells?.Development. 2005; 132: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), partly because expression of Stella has been reported in both mouse and human ESCs, albeit heterogeneously (Clark et al., 2004Clark A.T. Rodriguez R.T. Bodnar M.S. Abeyta M.J. Cedars M.I. Turek P.J. Firpo M.T. Reijo Pera R.A.

Stella, a definitive marker of the germ cell lineage, is, however, first observed in preimplantation embryos. Thereafter, Stella is repressed in the epiblast (Payer et al., 2006Payer B.

Other proteins such as Pecam1, Nanog, and SSEA1 also exhibit heterogeneous expression in undifferentiated ESCs (Chambers et al., 2007Chambers I. Silva J. Colby D. Nichols J. Nijmeijer B. Robertson M.

Thus, while heterogeneity is a hallmark of ESCs, it remains to be fully elucidated how this is compatible with pluripotency and self-renewal. In this study, we set out to investigate the nature of Stella-expressing cells in undifferentiated ESCs. We demonstrate that Stella-positive ESCs are closely related to the ICM and not to the epiblast or PGCs. Moreover, cultured under conditions that maintain pluripotency, the proportion of Stella-positive cells remained relatively constant, while they were able to reversibly convert to Stella-negative ESCs. Expression of stella is regulated by chromatin-based modifications in ESCs, which can respond to both the environmental and epigenetic cues. We propose that while undifferentiated ESCs undergo self-renewal, they are in a highly dynamic state as they continuously fluctuate between an ICM- and epiblast-like phenotype. By contrast, stella is robustly repressed by DNA methylation in pluripotent stem cells derived from postimplantation epiblast cells (EpiSCs), which do not readily revert to an ICM-like state. We previously generated two stella-gfp transgenic ESC lines (SH10.10 and BAC9) with different lengths of the stella flanking sequences coupled to a gene for green fluorescent protein (GFP) as the reporter (Payer et al., 2006Payer B. Chuva de Sousa Lopes S.M. Barton S.C. Lee C. Saitou M. Surani M.A. Generation of stella-GFP transgenic mice: a novel tool to study germ cell development.Genesis. 2006; 44: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In these ESCs, expression of Stella as well as of Stella-GFP was detectable only in a subset of ESCs (Figures 1A–1C). Similar heterogeneous expression of Stella was also confirmed in nontransgenic ESCs by immunsostaining (data not shown). Notably, cells with expression of Stella-GFP coincided significantly with those observed for endogenous Stella expression. For example, this was the case in 126 of 141 (89%) randomly chosen ESCs, although some Stella-positive cells were negative for Stella-GFP (5%), and some strongly Stella-GFP-positive cells (6%) expressed Stella only weakly. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) consistently revealed that around 20%–30% of ESCs were Stella-GFP positive under our culture conditions, irrespective of the passage number (Figure 1D). However, the exact proportion of Stella-GFP-positive cells occasionally deviated from this range, as they are susceptible to slight differences in culture conditions (data not shown). These observations were made whether we used ESCs from stella-gfp BAC9 or from stella-gfp SH10.10 transgenic mice, except that the fluorescence activity of Stella-GFP in BAC9 ESCs was weaker (Figure 1D), which is most likely the result of the integration of a different copy number of transgenes in the genome. For convenience, we used stella-gfp SH10.10 ESCs in the rest of the studies described here. Next, we examined transcription profiles of the Stella-GFP-positive and -negative populations by quantitative reverse polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR). Notably, we found that the two fractions clearly differed in the levels of expression of Fgf5, a marker of pluripotent epiblast cells of early postimplantation embryos, which is not expressed in the ICM (Pelton et al., 2002Pelton T.A. Sharma S. Schulz T.C. Rathjen J. Rathjen P.D. Transient pluripotent cell populations during primitive ectoderm formation: correlation of in vivo and in vitro pluripotent cell development.J.

Formation of a primitive ectoderm like cell population, EPL cells, from ES cells in response to biologically derived factors.J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 601-612PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, Gbx2 was also detected at a higher level in the Stella-GFP-negative cells, and like Fgf5, Gbx2 is also upregulated in the primitive ectoderm cells soon after implantation (Figure 2A) (Chapman et al., 1997Chapman G.

By contrast, the Stella-GFP-positive population was slightly enriched in Pecam1 and Zfp42/Rex1 transcripts, which are preferentially expressed in ICM compared to the epiblast (Figure 2A) (Pelton et al., 2002Pelton T.A. Sharma S. Schulz T.C. Rathjen J. Rathjen P.D. Transient pluripotent cell populations during primitive ectoderm formation: correlation of in vivo and in vitro pluripotent cell development.J.

Inner cell mass-specific expression of a cell adhesion molecule (PECAM-1/CD31) in the mouse blastocyst.Dev. Biol. 2001; 234: 317-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Genes such as alphafetoprotein and collagen type IV that are upregulated in differentiated ESCs were not detectable in either of the two populations (data not shown), indicating that the Stella-GFP-negative population is not representative of differentiating ESCs. The above analysis was conducted on the two FACS-sorted cell populations, which would mask the extent of variations among individual cells. In addition, whereas Stella-GFP expression in ESCs showed extensive overlap with the endogenous expression of Stella, they do not coincide completely (Figures 1A–1C and 2A). Therefore, we decided to further investigate the nature of heterogeneity among the ESCs by examining gene expressions in 87 randomly selected single ESCs. Q-PCR analysis revealed variable stella transcripts in 63 (72.4%) cells (Figure 2B), among which we found 26 (29.9%) Gfp-expressing cells. Notably, Gfp was detected predominantly in cells with high expression of stella (Figure 2B), which is consistent with the 20%–30% of Stella-positive cells we detected by immunostaining. Among these, 15 of 26 cells showed high stella expression (stella-high; 57.8%), and 9 of 26 belonged to the stella-low group (34.6%) (Figure 2B). The differences in the percentage of cells with the stella transcript and those positive for the protein might be caused by translational regulation of stella transcript. It is possible that translational regulation is an important general feature of ESCs. Nevertheless, these results demonstrate that the number of stella transcripts in individual cells was variable, but virtually all the stella-Gfp-positive cells (92.9%, 26 of 28) were present within the group with high stella transcripts (Figure 2B). Next, we extended our single-cell Q-PCR analysis to further assess expression of the other key marker genes. In agreement with the data from the FACS-sorted populations, we detected Fgf5 expression predominantly among the stella-negative cells. By contrast, most Pecam1-expressing cells were among those with expression of stella, which also showed higher expression of Zfp42/Rex1 (Figure 2B). Furthermore, it is of interest that expression of Gbx2 was detected among the stella-low and stella-negative cells, which is consistent with the in vivo expression of Gbx2 that starts to increase in the E4.5 primitive ectoderm at the time when stella expression begins to decline (Kurimoto et al., 2006Kurimoto K. Yabuta Y. Ohinata Y. Ono Y. Uno K.D. Yamada R.G. Ueda H.R. Saitou M.

It is striking that the average numbers of Nanog and Sox2 transcripts were also significantly lower in stella-negative cells compared to the stella-positive cells (0.01 < p < 0.05) (Figure 2B), which may reflect a decrease in these transcripts in vivo in the E4.5 primitive ectoderm and epiblast cells of midstreak embryos, respectively (Avilion et al., 2003Avilion A.A.

By contrast, Oct4 transcripts were detected uniformly in all cells, which is the case in vivo in ICM and epiblast cells. Notably, these results indicated that the developmentally regulated genes are not expressed stochastically among ESCs, as their expression seems to reveal an adherence to the in vivo developmental program. Consistent with the Q-PCR analyses of single cells, the entire population of Stella-GFP-positive ESCs was contained within the Pecam1-positive population by FACS analysis (see Figure S1 available online). Pecam1 is a developmentally regulated gene that is homogeneously expressed in the ICM and completely absent from the epiblast (Figure S1 and Robson et al., 2001Robson P. Stein P. Zhou B. Schultz R.M. Baldwin H.S. Inner cell mass-specific expression of a cell adhesion molecule (PECAM-1/CD31) in the mouse blastocyst.Dev. Biol. 2001; 234: 317-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This being the case, it is clear that the Stella-GFP-positive cells are contained within these ICM-like cells. By contrast, expression of SSEA1, which also shows heterogeneous expression in ESCs (Cui et al., 2004Cui L. Johkura K. Yue F. Ogiwara N. Okouchi Y. Asanuma K. Sasaki K. Spatial distribution and initial changes of SSEA-1 and other cell adhesion-related molecules on mouse embryonic stem cells before and during differentiation.J. Histochem.

Reprod. 2004; 70: 1452-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), was detected in both the Stella-GFP-positive and Stella-GFP-negative cells (Figure S1). However, unlike Pecam1, there is heterogeneous expression of SSEA1 in both the ICM and epiblast cells (Cui et al., 2004Cui L. Johkura K. Yue F. Ogiwara N. Okouchi Y. Asanuma K. Sasaki K. Spatial distribution and initial changes of SSEA-1 and other cell adhesion-related molecules on mouse embryonic stem cells before and during differentiation.J. Histochem.

Reprod. 2004; 70: 1452-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We observed that the Stella-GFP-positive cells were detected within the SSEA1-positive as well as the SSEA1-negative population at comparable levels (17.4% versus 11.0%) (Figure S1). Immunofluorescence analysis confirmed that Stella-GFP-positive cells did not entirely overlap with the SSEA1-positive cells (Figure S1). These results again emphasize that heterogeneity among ESCs has a basis in the inherent developmental program in vivo. Next we asked how the relatively stable population of 20%–30% Stella-GFP-positive cells is maintained among the ESCs, for which there are at least two possibilities: either they are in a state of flux and interchange continuously between positive and negative states while maintaining a constant ratio, or they give rise only to descendants of the same type. To distinguish between these possibilities, FACS-sorted Stella-positive and Stella-negative ESCs populations were cultured and analyzed separately. To avoid contamination of cells that express endogenous stella but no Gfp transcripts, we used a Stella-GFP-negative/Pecam1-negative population, since single-cell analysis revealed that cells that do not express endogenous stella were enriched within the double-negative population. Remarkably, after 3 days of culture, approximately 50% of the cells in both the individual fractions were found to be Stella-GFP negative/Pecam1 positive (Figure 3A). We consider these cells to be phenotypically closest to the two original isolated FACS-sorted populations described above. Indeed, these individual cultures were eventually fully restored to the original state of about 20%–30% Stella-GFP-positive cells that we first encountered among the stella-gfp ESCs. Interestingly, the Stella-GFP-positive/Pecam1-positive population reverted to the original state faster than the Stella-GFP-negative/Pecam1-negative cells, which occurred within 5 and 7 days of culture, respectively (Figures 3A and 3B). These results show that the FACS-sorted populations of ESCs representing the two extreme populations are interchangeable. Moreover, the two individual groups of cells first generated a large proportion of Stella-GFP-negative/Pecam1-positive cells, which were in turn followed by the generation of cell types that progressively departed further away from the original FACS-sorted Stella-GFP-positive/Pecam1-positive and Stella-GFP-negative/Pecam1-negative cell types, respectively. These observations suggest an adherence to an intrinsic program during their interconversion rather than a stochastic change in gene expression. To exclude the possibility that the results could be influenced by the reciprocal contamination of the two cell populations, ESC subclones (n = 64) derived from FACS-sorted single Stella-GFP-positive/Pecam1-positive or Stella-GFP-negative/Pecam1-negative cells were analyzed at 9 days after FACS sorting. Clonal analysis revealed that both sets of cells could generate the reciprocal set of cells as in the parental cell lines (Figure 3C), except that there was a lower average percentage of Stella-GFP-positive cells detected from the latter subclones, which is consistent with the relatively less efficient generation of the reciprocal cell types as described previously. Moreover, the clonal analysis also showed less-efficient plating of Stella-GFP-negative/Pecam1-negative ESCs, which formed fewer colonies compared to the cells of the opposite phenotype (Figure 3D). Thus, while the overall population of Stella-positive ESCs is maintained through mutual conversion of positive and negative cells, the efficiency of the process clearly differs. We reason that the conversion of Stella-positive/Pecam1-positive cells into Stella-negative/Pecam1-negative cells follows an inherent developmental program from ICM toward epiblast, whereas the reciprocal conversion is contrary to the normal developmental program in vivo. This could account for the slower conversion rate of the latter. The intermittent expression of Stella in ESCs indicates that these pluripotent stem cells are probably in a metastable state, which should be reflected in their epigenetic states. We therefore examined histone modifications and DNA methylation in the endogenous genomic DNA sequences surrounding the start codon of Stella. We found that the Stella-GFP-positive ESCs displayed a relative enrichment of acetylated histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9ac) and trimethylated H3K4 (H3K4me3), which are a hallmark of an active gene, compared to the levels in Stella-GFP-negative/Pecam1-negative ESCs (Figure 4A). The levels of trimethylation of H3K27 (H3K27me3), a repressive gene marker, was, however, comparable in the two populations (Figure 4A). Furthermore, the DNA sequence, which has ten CpGs, was hypomethylated in both the Stella-GFP-positive and Stella-GFP-negative/Pecam1-negative FACS-sorted cells (Figure 4B), except for a slight increase in some of the latter cells. These results indicate that the metastable expression of stella is regulated by chromatin-based epigenetic changes, which is independent of DNA methylation. As the histone modifications can be relatively plastic, we next tested the responsiveness of Stella expression under a variety of conditions. First, we found that the culture of ESCs in a chemically defined medium without embryonic fibroblast feeder cells (MEFs), which are a source of signaling molecules that affect ESCs (Chambers and Smith, 2004Chambers I. Smith A. Self-renewal of teratocarcinoma and embryonic stem cells.Oncogene. 2004; 23: 7150-7160Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar), resulted in almost complete loss of Stella-GFP expression (Figure 4C). Notably, Stella-GFP expression was, however, restored as before in more than 20% of the ESCs when they were returned to culture with MEFs (Figure 4C). This clearly shows that the metastable state of Stella-GFP expression is influenced by environmental cues, one of which is signals from MEFs. Notably, Stella-GFP expression was also restored in response to 10 nM trichostatin A (TSA), an inhibitor of histone deacetylase, but DNA5-azacytidine, an inhibitor DNA methyltransferase, had no effect. Indeed, the proportion of Stella-GFP-positive cells increased to 37.5% in response to TSA. These ESCs also showed a striking phenotypic change as they formed compact colonies, which is characteristic of ESCs grown on MEFs (Figure 4D). These results demonstrate that histone acetylation, but not DNA methylation of Stella locus, is one of the epigenetic modifications regulating expression of Stella. Our studies above show that the ESCs consist of subpopulations of cells that exhibit distinct gene expression profiles while being in a metastable epigenetic state. The subpopulations were in a constantly interchangeable state under conditions that maintain them in an undifferentiated state. However, we decided to investigate whether the Stella-positive/Pecam1-positive and Stella-negative/Pecam1-negative cells exhibit distinct properties if they were forced to undergo differentiation. First, we attempted to check their differentiation potential in embryoid bodies (EBs) and found that the Stella-negative/Pecam-negative cells seldom formed EBs, whereas Stella-GFP-positive/Pecam1-positive cells could do so readily as expected and as judged by the detection of differentiation marker genes (data not shown), which suggests a difference in the properties of the two populations. Next, we cultured the two cell populations with retinoic acid (RA) that induces mainly neuronal differentiation. Q-PCR analysis showed that expression of early neuronal lineage-marker genes, Sox1, Nestin, and Pax6, was enhanced in Stella-GFP-negative/Pecam1-negative cells compared to the levels of expression detected in Stella-GFP-positive/Pecam1-positive cells (Figure 5A). This is not due to a difference in the basal levels of expression of these genes in each population, since Sox1 and Pax6 transcripts were rather lower in nonstimulated Stella-GFP-negative/Pecam1-negative cells (Figure 5A). These results demonstrate that the Stella-GFP-negative/Pecam1-negative cells were more sensitive to the signal to undergo differentiation, at least with respect to the response to RA-induced differentiation. Next we checked their response when each population was cultured under conditions that are known to induce differentiation of trophectoderm cells (TS medium). Surprisingly, the Stella-GFP-negative/Pecam1-negative population readily exhibited remarkable upregulation of Cdx2 gene expression, which is a marker of trophoectoerm cells in pre- and peri-implantation embryos, as well as of other markers of this lineage, such as Hand1 and Dlx1 (Figure 5B). Immunofluorescence analysis also showed that Cdx2 was clearly detectable in nuclei of these cells, forming dense colonies, as well as in large nuclei of presumptive trophoblast giant cells located around the periphery of differentiating colonies (Figure 5C). Recently, evidence from pluripotent stem cells derived from postimplantation epiblast cells (EpiSCs) shows that these are also more capable of differentiation into trophectoderm cells (Brons et al., 2007Brons I.G. Smithers L.E. Trotter M.W. Rugg-Gunn P. Sun B. Chuva de Sousa Lopes S.M. Howlett S.K. Clarkson A. Ahrlund-Richter L. Pedersen R.A. Vallier L.

New cell lines from mouse epiblast share defining features with human embryonic stem cells.Nature. 2007; 448: 196-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1571) Google Scholar). This is consistent with our data showing that the Stella-negative/Pecam1-negative ESCs are more like the epiblast cells. By contrast, the Stella-positive/Pecam1-positive cells failed to show this response. This is consistent with the fact that ESCs generally show a small number of differentiating trophectoderm cells when cultured under TS cell conditions. Taken together, these results demonstrate that Stella-negative cells possess functionally distinct properties, among which is a state that is permissive for differentiation into trophectoderm cells that is also observed with EpiSCs. Based on our analysis, ESCs consist of a population of Stella-GFP-negative/Pecam1-negative cells that are relatively closer to the epiblast cells and share some of the differentiation potential with EpiSCs, a stem cell line from epiblast cells of postimplantation embryos. We therefore further characterized the Stella-GFP-negative/Pecam1-negative ESCs by comparing marker gene expression and epigen"
https://openalex.org/W1986932941,"Metazoans employ cytoprotective and regenerative strategies to maintain tissue homeostasis. Understanding the coordination of these strategies is critical to developing accurate models for aging and associated diseases. Here we show that cytoprotective Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling influences regeneration in the Drosophila gut by directing proliferation of intestinal stem cells (ISCs). Interestingly, this function of JNK contributes to the loss of tissue homeostasis in old and stressed intestines by promoting the accumulation of misdifferentiated ISC daughter cells. Ectopic Delta/Notch signaling in these cells causes their abnormal differentiation but also limits JNK-induced proliferation. Protective JNK signaling and control of cell proliferation and differentiation by Delta/Notch signaling thus have to be carefully balanced to ensure tissue homeostasis. Our findings suggest that this balance is lost in old animals, increasing the potential for neoplastic transformation."

We show that knockdown of the canonical Notch effector Cbf-1 in the MaSC-enriched population results in increased stem cell activity in vivo as well as the formation of aberrant end buds, implying a role for endogenous Notch signaling in restricting MaSC expansion. Conversely, Notch was found to be preferentially activated in the ductal luminal epithelium in vivo and promoted commitment of MaSCs exclusively along the luminal lineage. Notably, constitutive Notch signaling specifically targeted luminal progenitor cells for expansion, leading to hyperplasia and tumorigenesis. These findings reveal key roles for Notch signaling in MaSCs and luminal cell commitment and further suggest that inappropriate Notch activation promotes the self-renewal and transformation of luminal progenitor cells.

Adult stem cells are important for organ development and maintenance of tissue homeostasis. The mouse mammary stem cell (MaSC) has been demonstrated to reconstitute an entire functional gland at the single-cell level (Shackleton et al., 2006Shackleton M. Vaillant F. Simpson K.J. Stingl J.

The recent identification of progenitor populations has provided evidence that the mammary epithelium is organized in a hierarchical manner such that stem cells give rise to differentiated epithelium via a series of lineage-restricted intermediates in both mouse and human (Asselin-Labat et al., 2007Asselin-Labat M.L.

There are at least three different types of mature epithelial cells in the mammary gland: myoepithelial cells and two types of luminal lineage cells. The luminal lineage comprises both ductal and alveolar epithelial cells that line the ducts and constitute the alveolar units that expand during pregnancy, respectively. Extracellular signals from hormones and cytokines (reviewed in Hennighausen and Robinson, 2001Hennighausen L. Robinson G.W. Signaling pathways in mammary gland development.Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 467-475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) are presumed to control mammary stem cell activity and their progressive lineage differentiation via specific regulatory pathways, but these are yet to be elucidated. Notch signaling has emerged as a key regulator of multiple cellular processes including stem cell maintenance, cell-fate specification, and differentiation (Artavanis-Tsakonas et al., 1999Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Rand M.D. Lake R.J. Notch signaling: cell fate control and signal integration in development.Science. 1999; 284: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (4671) Google Scholar, Chiba, 2006Chiba S. Notch signaling in stem cell systems.Stem Cells. 2006; 24: 2437-2447Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). The diverse effects of Notch appear to be orchestrated in a cell-specific and developmental stage-dependent manner. In the case of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and neural stem cells (NSCs), there is in vivo evidence that the Notch pathway maintains these cells in an uncommitted state as well as regulating their self-renewal (Chiba, 2006Chiba S. Notch signaling in stem cell systems.Stem Cells. 2006; 24: 2437-2447Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). In addition to its role in stem cell function, Notch signaling plays a prominent role in governing cell-fate decisions in multiple cellular systems, including the hematopoietic and neural cellular compartments (Artavanis-Tsakonas et al., 1999Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Rand M.D. Lake R.J. Notch signaling: cell fate control and signal integration in development.Science. 1999; 284: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (4671) Google Scholar). Deregulated Notch signaling has been implicated in a number of human malignancies (Radtke and Raj, 2003Radtke F. Raj K. The role of Notch in tumorigenesis: oncogene or tumour suppressor?.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 756-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar, Roy et al., 2007Roy M. Pear W.S. Aster J.C. The multifaceted role of Notch in cancer.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2007; 17: 52-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The biological effects of Notch are mediated through interactions between Notch receptors and ligands, leading to Notch cleavage by γ-secretase/presenilin and release of the active intracellular form of Notch (ICD), which translocates to the nucleus and interacts with its canonical partner Cbf-1/Rbp-Jκ to effect transcription. Targeted disruption of Cbf-1 in the mouse mammary gland during pregnancy has revealed that Notch signaling regulates alveolar cell maintenance and basal cell proliferation (Buono et al., 2006Buono K.D. Robinson G.W. Martin C. Shi S. Stanley P. Tanigaki K. Honjo T. Hennighausen L. The canonical Notch/RBP-J signaling pathway controls the balance of cell lineages in mammary epithelium during pregnancy.Dev. Biol. 2006; 293: 565-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). However, no defects in ductal morphogenesis were evident in virgin animals, possibly reflecting ineffective excision by MMTV-cre in the stem cell compartment. The role of the Notch pathway during the early stages of mammary development and stem/progenitor cell restriction remains to be defined. Such studies have important implications for understanding how deregulated Notch signaling leads to mammary tumors. Indeed, both Notch 1 and Notch 4 were identified as common sites of proviral integration in mammary tumors (Dievart et al., 1999Dievart A. Beaulieu N. Jolicoeur P.

Furthermore, Wnt appears to elicit oncogenesis through a Notch-dependent mechanism in human breast epithelial cells (Ayyanan et al., 2006Ayyanan A. Civenni G. Ciarloni L. Morel C. Mueller N. Lefort K. Mandinova A. Raffoul W. Fiche M. Dotto G.P. et al.Increased Wnt signaling triggers oncogenic conversion of human breast epithelial cells by a Notch-dependent mechanism.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 3799-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In breast cancer patients, overexpression of NOTCH1 or JAG1 has been shown to predict poor overall survival (Reedijk et al., 2005Reedijk M. Odorcic S. Chang L. Zhang H. Miller N. McCready D.R. Lockwood G. Egan S.E. High-level coexpression of JAG1 and NOTCH1 is observed in human breast cancer and is associated with poor overall survival.Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 8530-8537Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Here we have investigated the role of Notch signaling in mammary stem and progenitor cells by either knockdown of the canonical Notch effector gene Cbf-1 or constitutive activation of the pathway. Our data reveal distinct functions for the Notch pathway within the mammary epithelial hierarchy. Downregulation of Notch signaling in MaSCs led to increased repopulating activity in vivo and aberrant ductal morphogenesis, providing evidence that this pathway normally plays a role in restricting expansion of the MaSC pool. In contrast, Notch activity was found to be substantially higher in luminal epithelial cells of the mammary gland, with prominent expression of the active form of Notch1 and its target genes in luminal progenitor cells in vivo. Constitutive activation of Notch1 in MaSCs promoted luminal cell-fate specification at the expense of myoepithelial lineage commitment. Moreover, constitutive signaling was found to specifically target luminal progenitor cells for expansion and self-renewal, eventually leading to hyperplasia and tumorigenesis. To explore the role of Notch signaling in the mammary gland, we initially examined the mRNA expression profiles of Notch ligands, receptors, and target genes in freshly sorted epithelial subpopulations. We have previously shown that CD29/β1 integrin and CD24 resolve MaSC-enriched (CD29hiCD24+) and luminal cell (CD29loCD24+) subpopulations (Shackleton et al., 2006Shackleton M. Vaillant F. Simpson K.J. Stingl J. Smyth G.K. Asselin-Labat M.L. Wu L. Lindeman G.J. Visvader J.E. Generation of a functional mammary gland from a single stem cell.Nature. 2006; 439: 84-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1506) Google Scholar). The CD29hiCD24+ fraction also comprises myoepithelial cells, but the luminal subpopulation (CD29loCD24+) has been further subdivided into CD61+ luminal progenitor cells and a CD61− subpopulation that is highly enriched for mature luminal cells (Asselin-Labat et al., 2007Asselin-Labat M.L. Sutherland K.D. Barker H. Thomas R. Shackleton M. Forrest N.C. Hartley L. Robb L. Grosveld F.G. van der Wees J. et al.Gata-3 is an essential regulator of mammary-gland morphogenesis and luminal-cell differentiation.Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). The purity of the cell subpopulations was evaluated by determining expression of the luminal lineage marker keratin 18 (K18) and the myoepithelial markers p63 and smooth muscle actin (SMA) using quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (q-RT-PCR) analysis (Figure 1A). As predicted, K18 expression was highest in the CD61+ and CD61− luminal subpopulations, while expression of p63 and SMA was restricted to the MaSC-enriched subpopulation (CD29hi). Expression analysis of the receptors revealed that Notch1–3 were predominantly expressed in the luminal subtypes rather than the MaSC fraction (Figure 1A), with Notch1 levels exhibiting the highest differential expression. Expression of Notch4 appeared comparable among the different subpopulations, even though the relative level of this receptor was considerably lower than that of the other Notch genes. In human breast tissue, Notch members also appear to be expressed in luminal cells (Farnie and Clarke, 2007Farnie G. Clarke R.B. Mammary stem cells and breast cancer—role of Notch signalling.Stem Cell Rev. 2007; 3: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). The Notch ligands were found to be variably expressed: Delta1 was predominantly expressed in the MaSC-enriched subpopulation, while Jagged1 was restricted to the luminal cell subsets. Jagged2, Delta3, and Delta4 were expressed in all subsets but at varying levels (Figure 1A). To examine whether the Notch pathway was activated in mammary ductal epithelium, immunohistochemistry was performed using antibodies specific for the cleaved (active) intracellular form of the Notch1 receptor (NICD1) and its target, Hey2. Intense nuclear staining of ductal luminal cells was observed in each case, reflecting Notch activity (Figure 1B). The majority of myoepithelial cells did not express NICD and Hey2, although a low level of staining was apparent in some cells. Moreover, q-RT-PCR analysis of Notch target genes selected on the basis of gene profiling studies (M.-L.A.-L., F.V., G.J.L., and J.E.V., unpublished data) showed that Hey1 and Hey2 were prominently expressed in the luminal progenitor (CD61+) population. Gata-3 was also found to be preferentially expressed in luminal cells, and Hes6 levels were highest in the mature CD61− luminal subset (Figure 1C). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis using freshly sorted luminal cells (CD29loCD24+) demonstrated that the endogenous NICD1 is bound to the promoter regions of the target genes Hey2 (Gustafsson et al., 2005Gustafsson M.V. Zheng X. Pereira T. Gradin K. Jin S. Lundkvist J. Ruas J.L. Poellinger L. Lendahl U. Bondesson M. Hypoxia requires notch signaling to maintain the undifferentiated cell state.Dev.

No binding was detectable on adjacent promoter regions lacking Cbf-1 recognition sites. To explore the activity of the endogenous Notch pathway in the MaSC-enriched and luminal progenitor subpopulations, we treated cells plated in Matrigel with γ-secretase inhibitor XXI (GSI), which inhibits the proteolytic cleavage of Notch receptors to the active form, and then evaluated the expression of target genes. We have previously reported that Matrigel allows the generation of diverse structures from CD29hiCD24+ cells and alveolar-like structures from the CD29loCD24+ fraction (Shackleton et al., 2006Shackleton M. Vaillant F. Simpson K.J. Stingl J. Smyth G.K. Asselin-Labat M.L. Wu L. Lindeman G.J. Visvader J.E. Generation of a functional mammary gland from a single stem cell.Nature. 2006; 439: 84-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1506) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemical staining for multiple lineage markers confirmed that this 3D cellular assay maintains the integrity of the basal (CD29hi) and luminal progenitor (CD61+) subpopulations (see Figure S1 available online). On treatment of either population with GSI, markedly reduced expression of the target genes Hey1 and Gata-3 was observed relative to control cells treated with vehicle alone (Figure 1E). The relative levels of Notch target genes in the MaSC-enriched subpopulation grown in Matrigel were lower than in luminal progenitor cells (Figure 1E), compatible with the lower level of endogenous Notch signaling in this population (Figure 1C). Although the Notch pathway is more active in luminal cells, both Notch receptors (2, 3, and 4) and their target genes are expressed at lower levels in the MaSC-enriched population. To explore a potential role for Notch signaling in MaSCs, we utilized a short-term culture system for genetic manipulation followed by in vivo transplantation studies (Figure S2A). As proof of principle, freshly sorted CD29hiCD24+ cells were plated on irradiated fibroblasts and transduced with the control pMIG (MSCV-IRES-GFP) retroviral vector. Importantly, a high transduction efficiency (70%–80%) of primary epithelial cells was achieved, based on sorting for GFP expression. Limited numbers of GFP-positive (GFP+) cells were transplanted into the cleared fat pads of 3-week-old mice, and GFP+ ductal outgrowths were scored by fluorescence microscopy. An outgrowth is defined as a branched structure comprising multiple ducts emanating from a central point. As previously found (Shackleton et al., 2006Shackleton M. Vaillant F. Simpson K.J. Stingl J. Smyth G.K. Asselin-Labat M.L. Wu L. Lindeman G.J. Visvader J.E. Generation of a functional mammary gland from a single stem cell.Nature. 2006; 439: 84-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1506) Google Scholar), stem cell activity was confined to the CD29hiCD24+ subpopulation, whereas transplantation of 15,000–20,000 GFP+ cells from the luminal CD29loCD24+ fraction yielded no outgrowths (n = 18 primary recipients). The frequency of repopulation by CD29hiCD24+ cells was found to be approximately 1 in 7000 (Table S1), indicating that ecotropic retroviruses are as efficient as lentiviral transduction of mammary organoids (Welm et al., 2008Welm B.E. Dijkgraaf G.J.P. Bledau A.S. Welm A.L. Werb Z. Lentiviral transduction of mammary stem cells for analysis of gene function during development and cancer.Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 2: 90-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). However, the frequency was noted to be lower than that observed for freshly sorted cells that had no intervening culture (Shackleton et al., 2006Shackleton M. Vaillant F. Simpson K.J. Stingl J. Smyth G.K. Asselin-Labat M.L. Wu L. Lindeman G.J. Visvader J.E. Generation of a functional mammary gland from a single stem cell.Nature. 2006; 439: 84-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1506) Google Scholar). pMIG-transduced MaSCs exhibited extensive outgrowths in vivo (Figure S2B) and were serially transplantable, demonstrating their self-renewal capacity. The cultured MaSCs also retained full differentiation capacity during pregnancy, with dense milk-producing alveoli present at 0.5 day lactation (Figure S2C). Thus, MaSCs grown in vitro for a limited time period (total of 7 days) have the ability to regenerate a functional mammary gland comprised of all epithelial cell types. To examine a potential role for Notch signaling in MaSCs, we transduced CD29hiCD24+ cells with a retrovirus expressing a shRNA specific for the Notch effector Cbf-1 and then transplanted GFP+ cells into cleared mammary fat pads at limiting dilution. We transduced cells in the MaSC-enriched population with five independent Cbf-1 shRNA constructs in the LMP/LMS vector (Dickins et al., 2005Dickins R.A. Hemann M.T. Zilfou J.T. Simpson D.R. Ibarra I. Hannon G.J. Lowe S.W. Probing tumor phenotypes using stable and regulated synthetic microRNA precursors.Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 1289-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar) and selected the one that gave the most-effective knockdown for in vivo transplantation experiments. In three independent transplantation experiments, knockdown of Cbf-1 expression in the MaSC fraction was found to increase the repopulating frequency relative to control cells transduced with a LMS retrovirus containing a nonspecific sequence. Overall, a 2-fold increase in stem cell activity was found (Table 1; p = 0.0023). Furthermore, FACS analysis of control versus Cbf-1 shRNA-derived outgrowths showed an approximate 2-fold increase in the size of the MaSC-enriched CD29hiCD24+ population (Figure 2A; 1.9 ± 0.3; n = 4). Q-RT-PCR analysis confirmed efficient knockdown of Cbf-1 expression in the transduced MaSC-enriched population (Figure 2B).Table 1Limiting Dilution Analysis of the Repopulating Frequency of CD29hiCD24+ Cells Infected with a Cbf-1 shRNA or Control Nonspecific shRNA Ecotropic RetrovirusNumber of GFP+ Cells Injected per Mammary Fat PadNumber of Positive OutgrowthsControlCbf-1 shRNA5,0004/87/88,0004/66/610,0005/149/1415,0004/128/1220,0005/148/14Repopulating frequency (95% confidence interval)1/24,750 (1/38,200–1/16,000)1/10,900 (1/15,550–1/7,630)P valuep = 0.0023Number of positive outgrowths is shown as number of outgrowths per number of mammary fat pads injected.

The frequencies were converted to the absolute number of stem cells per number of transduced GFP+ cells, revealing 48 (31–75) versus 120 (84–172) MaSCs for control cells and Cbf-1 shRNA-transduced cells, respectively.

The frequencies were converted to the absolute number of stem cells per number of transduced GFP+ cells, revealing 48 (31–75) versus 120 (84–172) MaSCs for control cells and Cbf-1 shRNA-transduced cells, respectively. The outgrowths derived from Cbf-1 shRNA-transduced cells were markedly different from those generated by control cells. Increased but disorganized side branching was evident, and there was a striking increase in the number of buds at the ends of branches 8 weeks posttransplantation (Figure 2C). The latter are reminiscent of terminal end buds (TEBs) that drive ductal morphogenesis in the peripubertal mammary gland and comprise an outer cap cell layer enriched in mammary stem/progenitor cells and an inner body of cells destined to become luminal cells (Daniel et al., 1987Daniel C.W. Silberstein G.B. Strickland P. Direct action of 17 beta-estradiol on mouse mammary ducts analyzed by sustained release implants and steroid autoradiography.Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 6052-6057PubMed Google Scholar) (control panels in Figure 2D). Sectioning through end buds in Cbf-1 shRNA outgrowths revealed an increased number of basal cells that expressed the myoepithelial markers p63 and keratin 14, relative to that in control outgrowths. Within the end buds, there were clear areas of basal cell expansion into the body layer, and these were devoid of luminal epithelial cells, based on K18 expression (Figure 2D). We further examined the effect of inhibiting Notch signaling in the MaSC-enriched subpopulation on colony-forming ability in Matrigel cultures. A modest increase in clonogenic potential was observed for Cbf-1 shRNA-transduced CD29hiCD24+ cells or those treated with GSI (Figures 3A and 3C). More profoundly, a marked increase in colony size was apparent on inhibition of Notch signaling (Figures 3B and 3D and Figure S3A). All of the colonies or acini arising from GSI treatment or Cbf-1 shRNA transduction had a basal cell phenotype: they were positive for expression of p63 and keratin 5 and negative for that of keratin 18, keratin 8, MUC1, and Stat5a (Figures 3B and 3D and data not shown). These data suggested that Notch signaling normally acts to restrict MaSC and/or basal progenitor cell proliferation, consistent with the basal cell expansion observed in the end buds of Cbf-1-shRNA mammary outgrowths. The parallel results observed upon GSI treatment and knockdown of endogenous Cbf-1 expression suggest that GSI is acting via inhibition of the canonical Notch pathway. Knockdown of Cbf-1 mRNA and GSI-mediated inhibition of Hey1/Hey2 expression were verified (Figures S3B and S3C). Furthermore, downregulated expression of the Notch target gene Hey1 was observed at 24 hr following treatment of freshly sorted cells with GSI (Figure S3D). Overexpression of the Notch pathway antagonist Numb (Pece et al., 2004Pece S. Serresi M. Santolini E. Capra M. Hulleman E. Galimberti V. Zurrida S. Maisonneuve P. Viale G. Di Fiore P.P. Loss of negative regulation by Numb over Notch is relevant to human breast carcinogenesis.J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar) in the MaSC-enriched subpopulation also recapitulated the findings obtained with GSI and Cbf-1 shRNA retroviruses (data not shown). Taken together, these observations reveal that Notch signaling regulates proliferation in the basal cell compartment, while the in vivo transplantation data demonstrate that the Notch pathway controls stem cell expansion. Given that the endogenous Notch pathway is substantially more active in the luminal cell compartment and that Notch1 is most highly expressed in the luminal subsets (Figure 1), we performed gain-of-function experiments to investigate the effect of constitutive Notch1 signaling in MaSCs. CD29hiCD24+ cells were transduced with either pMIG or a pMIG retrovirus encoding the constitutively active NICD1 (Schroeter et al., 1998Schroeter E.H. Kisslinger J.A. Kopan R. Notch-1 signalling requires ligand-induced proteolytic release of intracellular domain.Nature. 1998; 393: 382-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1307) Google Scholar). In marked contrast to cells transduced with an empty retrovirus, no characteristic ductal outgrowths were generated by NICD1-transduced MaSCs (0/94 transplants). Rather, small, multifocal GFP+ nodules were evident in 97% of recipient fat pads at 8 weeks following transplantation (Figure 4A). Western blot and RT-PCR analyses of NICD1 and Hey1/Hey2 expression confirmed activation of the Notch pathway (Figures 4B and 4C). Histological sectioning revealed that the nodules were hyperplastic and were composed exclusively of luminal cells, based on the expression of the luminal markers keratin 8 (K8), K18, Stat5a, and E-cadherin (Figures 4D and 4E). Staining for expression of a further luminal marker, MUC-1, revealed abundant expression, although staining was more heterogeneous, perhaps reflecting the undifferentiated nature of these lesions (see below). Although rare SMA-positive cells were found scattered around the edge of luminal cell clusters, no p63 expression was observed (Figure 4D), thus demonstrating commitment to the luminal cell lineage. In contrast, control ductal outgrowths displayed normal morphology with luminal and myoepithelial cell layers (Figure S4A). Furthermore, the nodules arising from NICD1-transduced cells were completely blocked in their ability to undergo differentiation during pregnancy. Despite the presence of the luminal marker Stat5a, no expression of phospho-Stat5a or milk protein was detectable in the nodules (Figure 4E). Conversely, both were abundantly expressed in control outgrowths from pregnant recipients (Figure S4B).

The present studies identified CHOP as an interacting partner of activating transcription factor (ATF) 4 in a yeast two-hybrid screen and confirmed their interaction in HEK293T cells. CHOP protein levels rose modestly and transiently during amino acid deprivation, whereas endoplasmic reticulum stress caused a much higher and sustained expression of CHOP protein. Exogenous CHOP expression enhanced the TRB3 gene induction by amino acid deprivation. Conversely, CHOP suppressed the induction of the endogenous asparagine synthetase (ASNS) gene and inhibited transcription from a reporter gene driven by the ASNS promoter following activation by ATF4 or amino acid deprivation. Short interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of CHOP further enhanced the induction of ASNS by either amino acid deprivation or endoplasmic reticulum stress. The CHOP-dependent repression of the ASNS gene required the entire CHOP protein, arguing against the possibility of simple sequestration of ATF4 by the CHOP leucine zipper domain, and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis showed association of CHOP with the ASNS and TRB3 promoters. Interestingly, chromatin immunoprecipitation also showed that CHOP was associated with the C/EBP-ATF composite site regions of the SNAT2, VEGF, and CAT-1 genes, despite no significant effect on their expression after exogenous CHOP overexpression. Collectively, the results document that CHOP is a member of the transcription factor network that controls the stress-induced regulation of specific C/EBP-ATF-containing genes, such as ASNS.

The cascade of events that is triggered by ER stress is referred to as the unfolded protein response (UPR), and the pathway initiated by amino acid limitation is called the amino acid response (AAR) pathway. These pathways initiate a wide array of adaptive mechanisms and ultimately, if necessary, programmed cell death (1.Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Novoa I. Lu P.D. Calfon M. Sadri N. Yun C. Popko B.

Amino acid limitation leads to an increase in uncharged tRNA, which binds to and activates a kinase called GCN2 (general control nonderepressible 2) (3.Sood R. Porter A.C. Olsen D.A. Cavener D.R.

ER stress, triggered by perturbation of calcium homeostasis, glucose deprivation, or other causes of misfolded protein accumulation in the ER lumen, activates a kinase called PERK (double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase) (6.Okada T.

Both GCN2 and PERK phosphorylate the eukaryotic initiation factor 2α on serine 51, which provokes a suppression of global protein synthesis, but a paradoxical increase in the translation of selected mRNAs containing short upstream opening reading frames (9.Wek R.C. Cavener D.R. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2007; 9: 2357-2371Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Among the proteins for which translation is increased is activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) (10.Vattem K.M. Wek R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11269-11274Crossref PubMed Scopus (1135) Google Scholar, 11.Lu P.D. Harding H.P. Ron D. J.

Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2008; 40: 14-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). ATF members are known to heterodimerize within the ATF family as well as with members of another bZIP subgroup, the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) family, which consists of six members: C/EBPα,-β,-γ,-δ,-ϵ, and CHOP (13.Ramji D.P.

Among the ATF4 target genes are asparagine synthetase (ASNS) and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) homology protein (CHOP), also known as growth arrest and DNA damage protein 153 (GADD153). ASNS, for which the gene product catalyzes the glutamine and ATP-dependent conversion of aspartic acid to asparagine, is transcriptionally activated by ATF4 (19.Siu F. Bain P.J. LeBlanc-Chaffin R. Chen H. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24120-24127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The ASNS promoter contains two cis-acting sequences, Nutrient Sensing Response Elements-1 and -2 (NSRE-1 and NSRE-2), that together function as an enhancer element to mediate the transcriptional activation of the gene by either the AAR or the UPR pathway (20.Barbosa-Tessmann I.P.

The NSRE-1 sequence is a C/EBP-ATF composite site that has been shown by both electrophoretic mobility shift and ChIP assays to bind ATF4 following increased de novo synthesis of ATF4 following activation of either the AAR or the UPR (17.Chen H.

Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24120-24127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). C/EBP-ATF composite sites are composed of a half-site for C/EBP proteins and a half-site for ATF proteins (16.Fawcett T.W. Martindale J.L. Guyton K.Z. Hai T. Holbrook N.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 21.Wolfgang C.D. Chen B.P. Martindale J.L. Holbrook N.J. Hai T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6700-6707Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). CHOP was originally isolated as a gene induced in response to DNA-damaging agents (22.Fornace Jr., A.J. Alamo Jr., I. Hollander M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8800-8804Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar) and subsequently demonstrated to be induced by amino acid deprivation (23.Bruhat A. Jousse C. Wang X.-Z. Ron D. Ferrara M. Fafournoux P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17588-17593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) and ER stress (24.Wang X.Z. Lawson B. Brewer J.W. Zinszner H. Sanjay A. Mi L.J. Boorstein R. Kreibich G. Hendershot L.M. Ron D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4273-4280Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). The prototypic C/EBP protein contains a transcriptional activation/repression domain at its N terminus and a bZIP region at its C terminus, which consists of a basic DNA binding domain and a leucine zipper motif for dimerization. The basic region of CHOP contains proline and glycine substitutions in conserved residues believed to be essential to the interaction of these proteins with most C/EBP DNA-binding sites (25.Ron D. Habener J.F. Gene. Dev. 1992; 6: 439-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar, 26.Vinson C.R. Sigler P.B. McKnight S.L. Science. 1989; 246: 911-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar, 27.Landschulz W.H. Johnson P.F. McKnight S.L. Science. 1989; 243: 1681-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Consequently, it was originally proposed that CHOP lacked DNA binding activity for prototypic C/EBP-binding sites and instead negatively regulated the activity of bZIP proteins by sequestering them through nonfunctional dimers, thereby inhibiting their ability to bind DNA (25.Ron D. Habener J.F. Gene. Dev. 1992; 6: 439-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar). Indeed, CHOP-C/EBP heterodimers fail to bind several known C/EBP sequences in vitro, and when expressed in cells, CHOP attenuates the ability of other C/EBP proteins to activate promoter sites (25.Ron D. Habener J.F. Gene. Dev. 1992; 6: 439-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar). However, subsequent studies revealed that a CHOP-C/EBP heterodimer could function as a positive trans-activator (28.Wang X.-Z. Kuroda M. Sok J. Batchvarova N. Kimmel R. Chung P. Zinszner H. Ron D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3619-3630Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). More recently, TRB3 was also identified as a CHOP-inducible gene (29.Ohoka N. Yoshii S. Hattori T. Onozaki K. Hayashi H. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1243-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). CHOP plays an essential role in the response to a wide variety of cell stresses and induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in response to ER stress (2.Zinszner H. Kuroda M. Wang X.Z. Batchvarova N. Lightfoot R.T. Remotti H. Stevens J.L. Ron D. Gene. Dev. 1998; 12: 982-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (1683) Google Scholar). The basal expression level of CHOP is almost undetectable in most cell types, but expression is rapidly induced through ATF4-dependent transcription (25.Ron D. Habener J.F. Gene. Dev. 1992; 6: 439-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar, 30.Averous J. Bruhat A. Jousse C. Carraro V. Thiel G. Fafournoux P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5288-5297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Therefore, CHOP is one of the most important components in the network of stress-inducible transcription factors, and deciphering the range of CHOP actions is critical for understanding the molecular mechanisms for the cellular response to stress. However, the number of investigations focused on interaction of CHOP with ATF transcription factors and the physiological role of those interactions is limited. Chen et al. (31.Chen B.P. Wolfgang C.D. Hai T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1157-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) demonstrated that CHOP inhibits ATF3 function by forming a nonfunctional heterodimer, similar to the dominant negative effect on C/EBP proteins. Ohoka et al. (29.Ohoka N. Yoshii S. Hattori T. Onozaki K. Hayashi H. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1243-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar) showed that CHOP and ATF4 cooperatively activate TRB3 expression during ER stress but did not investigate whether or not this response required direct interaction. Likewise, CHOP antagonizes the action of ATF4 and ATF5 at C/EBP-ATF composite sites, but not the action of CREB at cyclic AMP-response elements (32.Yoon S. Govind C.K. Qiu H. Kim S.J. Dong J. Hinnebusch A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11713-11718Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The first published evidence for CHOP-ATF dimerization was from Gachon et al. (33.Gachon F. Gaudray G. Thebault S. Basbous J. Koffi J.A. Devaux C. Mesnard J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 502: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) who showed that CHOP binds to ATF4 in vitro based on glutathione S-transferase pulldown assays and that in a reporter assay CHOP blocks the action of ATF4. In this study, the interaction between ATF4 and CHOP was documented in intact cells, and the results also demonstrated that CHOP negatively regulates ATF4-dependent transcriptional activation of the ASNS gene. The inhibitory effect of CHOP on the ASNS gene was not observed when truncated proteins, encoding either the N- or C-terminal portion of the protein, were expressed. Despite its nonconventional C/EBP DNA binding domain, CHOP binds to the ASNS promoter, which contains a C/EBP-ATF composite site that mediates the response to amino acid deprivation or ER stress. Although the CHOP mRNA was elevated during amino acid deprivation, the increase in CHOP protein abundance was relatively modest and transient. In contrast, the increase in CHOP protein during the UPR was much greater and was sustained over 48 h. Consistent with the observed level of CHOP expression, amino acid deprivation did not cause cell apoptosis, whereas ER stress triggered the apoptotic pathway within 24 h. Antibodies and Plasmids—The CHOP monoclonal (sc-7351) and polyclonal (sc-575) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). ATF4 rabbit polyclonal antibody was generated by Cocalico Biologicals (Reamstown, PA) using purified ATF4 protein. Caspase-3 antibody (9662) and cleaved caspase-3 antibody (9661S) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Danvers, MA). The following plasmids were generated for expression of specific proteins: human ATF4 cDNA was subcloned into pcDNA3.1/zeo+ (Invitrogen) to generate the ATF4 expression vector driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter (hATF4/pcDNA3.1-zeo+); human CHOP cDNA was generated by PCR from a human HepG2 cDNA library and then cloned into pcDNA3.1/zeo+ (hCHOP/pcDNA3.1-zeo+), which was then used to generate clones encoding the full-length protein (aa 1∼169), an N-terminal fragment (aa 1∼100), or a C-terminal fragment (aa 101∼169) that were subcloned into the pEF6-V5-His vector (CHOP-FL-V5/pEF6-V5-His, CHOP-N-Term-V5/pEF6-V5-His, and CHOP-C-Term-V5/pEF6-V5-His). The reporter plasmid (ASNS-173/+51/luciferase) was made by inserting an ASNS promoter fragment (nucleotides -173/+51) upstream of the Firefly luciferase reporter gene using the HindIII site of the pGL3 plasmid (Promega, Madison, WI). Hemagglutinin-tagged ATF4 (HA-ATF4/pCGN) and green fluorescent protein (GFP/pcDNA3.1) plasmids were used to express the corresponding proteins in HEK293T cells. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—BD Matchmaker library construction and screening kits were purchased from Clontech. A human HepG2 library was generated as described in the manufacturer's protocols, using total RNA from HepG2 cells treated with 2 mm histidinol (HisOH) for 8 h. cDNAs corresponding to full-length or different domains of human ATF4 were generated by PCR, using the hATF4/pcDNA3.1-zeo+ plasmid as template, and subcloned into the pGBKT7 bait vector (Clontech). The procedures for culture media and plates for yeast growth and selection were as described in the manufacturer's protocols. Positive clones were sequenced and identified using National Center for Biotechnology Information databases. Cell Culture—Human HepG2 hepatoma cells or HEK293T embryonic kidney cells were cultured in minimal essential medium (MEM, pH 7.4, Mediatech, Herndon, VA) or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, pH 7.4 (Mediatech, Herndon, VA), respectively, each supplemented to contain 1× nonessential amino acids, 4 mm glutamine, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, 100 units/ml penicillin G, 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B, and 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2, 95% air incubator, and cultures were replenished with fresh MEM or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and serum for 12 h prior to initiating all treatments to ensure that the cells were in the basal (“fed”) state. Amino acid deprivation was induced by transfer of cells to culture medium containing 2 mm HisOH, which blocks charging of histidine onto the corresponding tRNA and thus mimics histidine deprivation and triggers activation of the AAR cascade (34.Thiaville M.M. Dudenhausen E.E. Zhong C. Pan Y.X. Kilberg M.S. Biochem. J. 2008; 410: 473-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). ER stress was induced by transfer of cells to culture medium containing 300 nm thapsigargin (Tg), which activates the UPR pathway because of its inhibition of the ER resident Ca2+-ATPase (35.Treiman M. Caspersen C. Christensen S.B. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1998; 19: 131-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). RNA Isolation and Quantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from HepG2 cells or HEK293T cells using the Qiagen RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), including a DNase I treatment before the final elution to eliminate DNA contamination, according to the manufacturer's protocol. To measure the relative amount of ASNS mRNA, quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis was performed using a DNA Engine Opticon 3 system (MJ Research, Reno, NV) and detection with SYBR Green I. To measure the steady state mRNA levels, the primers were as follows: for ASNS, sense, 5′-GCAGCTGAAAGAAGCCCAAGT-3′, and antisense, 5′-TGTCTTCCATGCCAATTGCA-3′; for CHOP, sense, 5′-CATCACCACACCTGAAAGCA-3′, and antisense, 5′-TCAGCTGCCATCTCTGCA-3′; for SNAT2, sense, 5′-GTGTCCTGTGGAAGCTGCTTTGA-3′, and antisense, 5′-CAGGTACAAGAGCTGTTGGCTGTGT-3′; for VEGF, sense, 5′-AGCTCCAGAGAGAAGTCGAGGAAGA-3′, and antisense, 5′-TCACTTTGCCCCTGTCGCTTT-3′; for TRB3, sense, 5′-TGGTACCAGCTCCTCTACG-3′, and antisense, 5′-GACAAAGCGACACAGCTTGA-3′; for CAT-1, sense, 5′-TGCCATTGTCATCTCCTTCCTG-3′, and antisense, 5′-AGCTCTCCAACGGTGACATAGC-3′; and for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), sense, 5′-TTGGTATCGTGGAAGGACTC-3′, and antisense, 5′-ACAGTCTTCTGGGTGGCAGT-3′. To measure the transcription rate from the ASNS gene, oligonucleotides derived from ASNS intron 12 and exon 13 were used to measure unspliced heteronuclear RNA as described previously (17.Chen H. Pan Y.X. Dudenhausen E.E. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50829-50839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), and the primers were as follows: sense, 5′-CCTGCCATTTTAAGCCATTTTGC-3′, and antisense, 5′-TGGGCTGCATTTGCCATCATT-3′. The PCRs were incubated at 48 °C for 30 min followed by 95 °C for 15 min to activate the Taq polymerase and amplification of 35 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 60 s. After PCR, melting curves were acquired by stepwise increase of the temperature from 55 to 95 °C to ensure that a single product was amplified in the reaction. PCR for each sample was done in duplicate with samples from at least three independent experiments, and the means ± S.E. between conditions were compared by Student's t test. Immunoblotting—Total cell or nuclear protein extract (30 μg/lane) or co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) eluate (45 μl/lane) was separated on a 10-14.5% Tris-HCl polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad) and then electrotransferred to a Protran nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). The membrane was stained with Fast Green to check for equal loading and then incubated with 10% blocking solution (10% (w/v) Carnation nonfat dry milk, 30 mm Tris base, pH 7.5, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, and 200 mm NaCl) for 1 h at room temperature with mixing. Immunoblotting was performed using rabbit polyclonal antibodies against ATF4 or CHOP at an antibody concentration of 0.2-0.4 μg/ml in 10% dry milk blocking solution overnight at 4 °C. The blots were washed three times for 10 min in 5% blocking solution on a shaker and then incubated with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD) at a 1:10,000 dilution for 2 h at room temperature. The blots were then washed two times for 10 min in 5% dry milk blocking solution and two times for 10 min in freshly made TBS/Tween (30 mm Tris base, 0.1% Tween 20, and 200 mm NaCl, pH 7.5). The bound secondary antibody was detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences) and exposing the blot to BioMax MR film (Eastman Kodak Co.). The films were quantified by densitometry using an UN-SCAN-IT software program (Silk Scientific, Orem, UT). Transient Transfection—HepG2 cells (0.2 × 106 cells/well) were seeded on 24-well plates 18-24 h before transfection with Superfect reagent (Qiagen) at a ratio of 6 μl of Superfect to 1 μg of DNA. For each transfection, 0.5 μg of the ASNS-173/+51/luciferase plasmid was used along with the indicated amounts of the transcription factor expression plasmids. The total amount of transfected DNA was kept constant among experimental groups by the addition of empty pcDNA3.1 plasmid. At 12 h following transfection, the cells were transferred to fresh complete MEM for 12 h before all treatments. At 36 h following transfection, cellular extracts were prepared for analysis of luciferase activity, by washing the cells with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubating in 300 μl of Passive lysis buffer (Promega). The lysates were collected and stored at -80 °C until use. A 10-μl aliquot was used for Firefly luciferase assays using the luciferase reporter assay system (Promega, Madison, WI). The luciferase values were normalized to protein content for each sample. For each experimental condition, three assays were performed for each transfection, and at least two independent transfections were done. ChIP Analysis—HepG2 cells were seeded at 1.5 × 107/150-mm dish with complete MEM and grown for 24 h. Cells were transferred to fresh MEM 12 h before transfer to either complete MEM, MEM containing 2 mm HisOH, or MEM containing 300 nm Tg for the time period indicated in each figure. ChIP analysis was performed as described previously (17.Chen H. Pan Y.X. Dudenhausen E.E. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50829-50839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). For double ChIP analysis, chromatin immunoprecipitated using CHOP antibody (sc-575, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was eluted by incubation for 30 min at 37 °C in ChIP dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 167 mm NaCl) containing 10 mm dithiothreitol. The eluate was diluted 100-fold with ChIP dilution buffer and divided evenly into two fractions. Each fraction was subjected again to the immunoprecipitation procedure using ATF4 antibody or normal rabbit IgG antibody (sc-2027, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), respectively. Purified, immunoprecipitated DNA was analyzed by qPCR, as described above. The results are expressed as the ratio to input DNA. Samples from three independent immunoprecipitations were analyzed in duplicate PCR assays, and the means ± S.E. between conditions were compared by the Student's t test. In the qPCR analysis, the primers 5′-TGGTTGGTCCTCGCAGGCAT-3′ and 5′-CGCTTATACCGACCTGGCTCCT-3′ were used to amplify the ASNS proximal promoter sequence (nucleotides -87 to -22, 5′-GGTTGGTCCTCGCAGGCATGATGAAACTTCCCGCACGCGTTACAGGAGCCAGGTCGGTATAAGCG-3′, NSRE-1 and NSRE-2 are underlined) and for ASNS exon 7 as a negative control (sense, 5′-GCAGCTGAAAGAAGCCCAAGT-3′ and 5′-TGTCTTCCATGCCAATTGCA-3′). As a positive control for CHOP-DNA interaction, primers designed to amplify the TRB3 promoter region, containing three sites reported to bind CHOP (29.Ohoka N. Yoshii S. Hattori T. Onozaki K. Hayashi H. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1243-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar), were also used in the qPCR analysis. The primers for the TRB3 gene (nucleotides +205/+343) were as follows: sense, 5′-ATTAGCTCCGGTTTGCATCAC-3′, and antisense, 5′-TCCACTTCCGCTGCGAGTCTC-3′. CHOP binding to the C/EBP-ATF containing regions of other amino acid responsive genes was also tested. Those primers were as follows: for SNAT2, sense, 5′-GGGAAGACGAGTTGGGAACATTTG-3′, and antisense, 5′-CCCTCCTATGTCCGGAAAGAAAAC-3′; for VEGF, sense, 5′-CTCTGCCCAGTGCTAGGAGGAATT-3′, and antisense, 5′-CAGGGGCTTCTCTCCAGGCTAAA-3′; and for CAT-1, sense 5′-AGGTGTGAGCAGCGGGTCAACT-3′, and antisense, 5′-AGAGGAGTGGAGGCTGCGGTTA-3′. The qPCR analysis was performed using a DNA Engine Opticon 3 system, and the products were detected with SYBR Green I. Serial dilutions of input DNA were used to generate a standard curve for determining the relative amount of product. Duplicates for both the standards and the samples were simultaneously amplified using the same reaction master mixture. The reactions were incubated at 95 °C for 15 min to activate the polymerase, followed by amplification at 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 60 s for 35 cycles. After PCR, melting curves were acquired by stepwise increases in the temperature from 55 to 95 °C to ensure that a single product was amplified in the reaction. The results are expressed as the ratio to input DNA. Samples from at least three independent immunoprecipitations were analyzed in duplicate PCR assays, and the means ± S.E. between conditions were compared by the Student's t test. siRNA Transfection—The human CHOP siRNA (L-004819-00), siControl nontargeting siRNA (D-001210-02), and DharmaFECT 4 transfection reagent were purchased from Dharmacon, Inc. (Lafayette, CO). HepG2 cells were seeded in 12-well plates at a density of 2.5 × 105 cells/well in MEM and grown for 16 h. Transfection was performed according to the instructions of Dharmacon using 3 μl of DharmaFECT-4 and a 100 nm per well final siRNA concentration. At 24 h following transfection, cells were rinsed with PBS, given fresh MEM, and cultured for another 12 h. The medium was then removed and replaced with control MEM, MEM containing 2 mm HisOH, or MEM containing 300 nm Tg. After a 4- h incubation, total RNA or protein extracts were isolated and analyzed by RT-PCR or immunoblotting, respectively. Co-immunoprecipitation—HEK293T cells were plated at 40% confluency in MEM medium 24 h before transfection. Cells were replenished with 3 ml/60-mm dish or 18 ml/150-mm dish of fresh MEM. CHOP-pcDNA3.1-zeo+, HA-ATF4-pCGN, or GFP-pcDNA3.1-zeo+ plasmids were transfected at 5 μg/60-mm dish or 20 μg/150-mm dish using a calcium phosphate-mediated transfection protocol. Transfection efficiency was evaluated by estimating the ratio of total cells to GFP-expressing cells. 36 h after transfection, cells"

Here we employed a conditional knockout strategy to simultaneously inactivate all three members, Rb, p107, and p130, in adult hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Rb family triple knockout (TKO) mice develop a cell-intrinsic myeloproliferation that originates from hyperproliferative early hematopoietic progenitors and is accompanied by increased apoptosis in lymphoid progenitor populations. Loss of quiescence in the TKO HSC pool is associated with an expansion of these mutant stem cells but also with an enhanced mobilization and an impaired reconstitution potential upon transplantation. The presence of a single p107 allele is sufficient to largely rescue these defects. Thus, Rb family members collectively maintain HSC quiescence and the balance between lymphoid and myeloid cell fates in the hematopoietic system.

Thus, Rb family members collectively maintain HSC quiescence and the balance between lymphoid and myeloid cell fates in the hematopoietic system. Hematopoiesis initiates from multipotent hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) that normally reside in the bone marrow (BM). HSC populations are largely quiescent but have the capacity to proliferate and differentiate into progenitors whose amplification ensures the constant and rapid renewal of all blood compartments (Metcalf, 2007Metcalf D.

A number of recent studies have pointed to a role for cell-cycle regulators and signaling pathways in the control of HSCs and hematopoiesis. The Bmi-1 polycomb group protein plays a critical role in the proliferative capacity of normal HSCs and leukemic stem cells. Bmi-1 functions in HSCs at least partly through its repressive action of the p16INK4a, p19ARF, and p21CIP1 cell-cycle inhibitors (Fasano et al., 2007Fasano C.A. Dimos J.T. Ivanova N.B. Lowry N.

These cell-cycle inhibitors and their family members generally restrain the ability of HSCs to proliferate and mediate the response of HSCs to stress signals (Cheng et al., 2000aCheng T. Rodrigues N.

Another critical pathway that controls the self-renewal potential and stress response of HSCs is the PTEN-FoxO signaling module (Miyamoto et al., 2007Miyamoto K. Araki K.Y. Naka K. Arai F. Takubo K.

However, the mechanisms by which HSCs normally maintain their quiescence state and transiently re-enter the cell cycle to produce hematopoietic progenitors are still not fully understood. In addition, the functional links between the cell-cycle machinery and the network of transcription factors regulating the fate of hematopoietic progenitors remain unclear (Orford and Scadden, 2008Orford K.W. Scadden D.T. Deconstructing stem cell self-renewal: genetic insights into cell-cycle regulation.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2008; 9: 115-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). The three members of the retinoblastoma family of transcriptional regulators, pRB, p107, and p130, integrate multiple cellular signals to control cellular proliferation and differentiation (Wikenheiser-Brokamp, 2006Wikenheiser-Brokamp K.A. Retinoblastoma family proteins: insights gained through genetic manipulation of mice.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2006; 63: 767-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). pRB family members act downstream of many of the critical cell-cycle regulators previously studied in HSCs. Thus, pRB family proteins are strong candidates to regulate HSCs and hematopoiesis. But no blood phenotype is observed in p130 mutant mice (Cobrinik et al., 1996Cobrinik D. Lee M.H. Hannon G. Mulligan G. Bronson R.T. Dyson N. Harlow E. Beach D. Weinberg R.A. Jacks T.

Given its strong cell-cycle-inhibitory functions and broad tumor suppressor activity, loss of pRB function has surprisingly no direct effect on the cell cycle of HSCs (Walkley and Orkin, 2006Walkley C.R.

Filippi M.D. Knudsen E.S. Faccio R. Li Z. Kalfa T. Geiger H. The retinoblastoma tumor suppressor is a critical intrinsic regulator for hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells under stress.Blood. 2008; 111: 1894-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Activation of CyclinD/Cdk4 kinase complexes and loss of p16Ink4a function, two upstream regulators of pRB, p107, and p130, are common in leukemias and lymphomas (Leoncini et al., 2006Leoncini L.

The Rb tumor suppressor in stress responses and hematopoietic homeostasis.Cell Cycle. 2005; 4: 42-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, the absence of a significant hematopoietic phenotype in mice mutant with single Rb family genes, and the known extensive functional redundancy within this gene family in many cell types (Wikenheiser-Brokamp, 2006Wikenheiser-Brokamp K.A. Retinoblastoma family proteins: insights gained through genetic manipulation of mice.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2006; 63: 767-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), we sought to inactivate Rb, p107, and p130 in adult mouse HSCs. To this end, we employed a conditional mutant strategy that bypasses the lethality of mutations in Rb family genes (Wikenheiser-Brokamp, 2006Wikenheiser-Brokamp K.A. Retinoblastoma family proteins: insights gained through genetic manipulation of mice.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2006; 63: 767-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We show that pRB family proteins collectively regulate programs of genes that normally inhibit the proliferation of HSCs and control the fate of hematopoietic progenitors. These experiments indicate that one key mechanism by which loss of pRB family function may initiate preneoplastic defects is by unrestricting the proliferation of adult stem cells. Similar to recent reports (Daria et al., 2008Daria D. Filippi M.D. Knudsen E.S. Faccio R. Li Z. Kalfa T. Geiger H. The retinoblastoma tumor suppressor is a critical intrinsic regulator for hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells under stress.Blood. 2008; 111: 1894-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, Walkley and Orkin, 2006Walkley C.R.

Rb regulates interactions between hematopoietic stem cells and their bone marrow microenvironment.Cell. 2007; 129: 1081-1095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), we found that Rb deletion in mouse HSCs does not significantly alter HSC functions but results in a mild myeloid neutrophilic expansion accompanied by extramedullary hematopoiesis (data not shown and see Figure S1 available online). We surmised that the additional deletion of p107 and p130 may unmask novel roles for this gene family in the hematopoietic system. To inactivate the entire Rb gene family in adult mouse HSCs, we generated Mx1-Cre Rblox/lox;p130lox/lox;p107−/− (Mx1-Cre condTKO) mice. Adult Mx1-Cre condTKO mice were injected with pI-pC to activate the Cre recombinase and delete the Rb and p130 genes in HSCs. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR (q-RT-PCR) analysis showed that a significant number of mutant cells are present in the BM of induced Mx1-Cre TKO mice (Figure S2A). TKO mice died within 1–3 months, whereas the viability of control mice was unaffected by pI-pC injections. Histopathological analysis of moribund Mx1-Cre TKO mice revealed marked spleen enlargement, with a severe disruption of the splenic architecture. A majority of splenocytes from Mx1-Cre TKO mice exhibited an eosinophilic morphology (Figure 1A). Infiltrating leukocytes were present in the kidney, liver, lungs, and skin (Figures 1B and data not shown). The BM structure was also altered and showed a marked expansion of myeloid cells, particularly eosinophils (Figure 1C). Next, we examined the distribution of the different hematopoietic lineages in TKO mice. Cell counts from TKO BM cytospins showed a decrease in the percentage of lymphocytes and neutrophils, accompanied by an increase in the frequency of myeloid precursors and mature eosinophils (2% in controls versus 20% in mutants) (Figure 1D). FACS analysis for myeloid markers indicated that the BM from Mx1-Cre TKO contained a large population of cells positive for Mac-1 and expressing low levels of Gr-1 (which we refer to as pre-M population) (Figures 1E and 1F). Cytospins from sorted BM subpopulations showed high heterogeneity in the pre-M population and well-differentiated granulocytes in the Mac-1+, Gr-1high population, as expected (Figure S2B). In addition, decreased percentages of Mac-1+, Gr-1high granulocytes (Figures 1E and 1F), erythrocytes, and B lymphocytes (Figure 1F and Figure S2C) were counted in the BM of mutant mice. While the pre-M myeloid expansion was restricted to the BM of Mx1-Cre TKO mice at early time points (data not shown), sick mice displayed extramedullary hematopoiesis. FACS analysis of splenocytes showed an increase in the number of pre-M cells (Figure 1G and Figure S2D). In addition, we observed an increase in the number of splenic erythrocytes at various stages of differentiation (Figure S2D, middle panel, and Figure S3). The total number of B cells in the spleen of TKO mice was not altered compared to control mice (Figure 1G, right, and Figure S2D). These observations indicate that deletion of Rb, p107, and p130 in Mx1-Cre TKO mice induces the development of a myeloproliferation characterized by the rapid expansion of a population of Mac-1+, Gr-1low (pre-M) myeloid cells with eosinophilic histological features. This disease originates from the BM, does not involve the peripheral blood (PB) (data not shown) but spreads to other organs, and is accompanied by general perturbations in the hematopoiesis of the mutant mice. The expansion of pre-M cells in TKO mice could originate from an increase in the proliferative capacity of these cells or of myeloid progenitor (MP) cells. However, cell-cycle analysis of pre-M and MP cells isolated from TKO and control mice did not reveal any significant differences in their cell-cycle profiles (Figure 2A). This result led us to analyze the cell cycle of early hematopoietic progenitors of the KLS compartment (c-Kit+, negative for lineage markers of differentiation, and Sca1+); KLS cells include HSCs and multipotent progenitors (MPPs). Strikingly, we found that TKO KLS cells were significantly more proliferative than control KLS cells (Figure 2A, right). We also observed a significant increase in the number of KLS and MP cells in the BM of sick Mx1-Cre TKO mice. Within the KLS population, both Flk2+ cells (MPP) and Flk2− cells (ST-HSC and LT-HSC) were increased (Figures 2B and 2C). Within the MP population, common myeloid progenitor (CMP, FcγR+) and megakaryocyte-erythrocyte progenitor (MEP, FcγR−) numbers were decreased in Mx1-Cre TKO mice, while granulocyte-monocyte progenitor (GMP, FcγRhigh) numbers were increased (Figures 2B and 2D). In the lymphoid lineage, the number of common lymphoid progenitor (CLP) cells was significantly decreased in Mx1-Cre TKO mice compared to controls (Figures 2E and 2F), and Annexin V staining experiments showed significantly higher numbers of apoptotic CLP in mutant mice (data not shown, see below). Based on these observations, we further tested the cell-cycle profile of subpopulations of stem/progenitors cells. Within the KLS population, both CD34+ (MPP and ST-HSC) and CD34− (LT-HSC) displayed enhanced proliferation (Figure 2G). This increased proliferation was not associated with changes in the apoptotic rates of these cells (data not shown). CMP cells, while decreased in numbers, cycled more rapidly, while GMP cells, which are more numerous in TKO mice, did not cycle more (Figure 2G). We next performed methylcellulose cultures using unfractioned BM cells and sorted KLS, MP, and pre-M cells. Unfractioned BM cells from Mx1-Cre TKO mice displayed a reduced number of colonies compared to controls (Figure 2H); this decrease is likely due to the dilution of the cells that have the capacity to form colonies by expanding pre-M cells. Nevertheless, the relative number of TKO granulocytic colonies (G-CFU) was increased compared to control cells, while the number of mixed colonies (GEMM-CFU) was decreased, which suggests a differentiation bias toward the granulocytic myeloid lineage. Purified Mx1-Cre TKO KLS cells produced a higher number of colonies compared to control cells, with again an increase in G-CFU and a decrease in GEMM-CFU. We observed a similar trend toward G-CFU with sorted MP populations. Only colonies obtained from KLS cells, but not MP cells, could be serially replated (data not shown). In addition, we did not observe colony formation from the more mature TKO pre-M cells, confirming that these mutant cells had not acquired a significant proliferation potential (data not shown). Together, these data suggest that the disease observed in TKO mice may result from the abnormal proliferation of early hematopoietic progenitors in the KLS and CMP compartments as well as from a change in the fate of these progenitors toward the myeloid lineage, and not by the increased proliferation potential of more mature myeloid cell populations. To assess the importance of the simultaneous inactivation of the three Rb family members for these phenotypes, we genetically reintroduced one wild-type allele of p107 and analyzed the BM of these p107-Single mice (Mx1-Cre Rblox/lox;p130lox/lox;p107+/−). As expected, p107-Single mice developed splenomegaly indicative of extramedullary hematopoiesis (data not shown). Strikingly, however, the BM of p107-Single mice did not exhibit a myeloproliferation (Figure 3A). p107-Single mice had similar numbers of KLS, MP, and pre-M cells in the BM as control mice as determined by FACS analysis (Figures 3B and 3C) and no increase in pre-M cells in the spleen (Figure 3D). The cell cycle of KLS cells was also similar in control and p107-Single mice (Figure 3E). The absence of a myeloproliferative phenotype illustrates the extent of the functional overlap within the Rb gene family and the necessity to inactivate all three genes to severely disrupt early hematopoietic development. Interestingly, however, the decrease in the number of lymphoid cells (both CLP and B cell populations) observed in TKO mice is still present in p107-Single mice (Figures 3B–3D), suggesting that different cell types during hematopoiesis may be differentially sensitive to different levels of Rb family function. The hyperproliferative phenotype of TKO KLS populations led us to further investigate the properties of these mutant stem cells. Since increased proliferation of hematopoietic progenitor cells is associated with their increased mobilization (Passegue et al., 2005Passegue E. Wagers A.J. Giuriato S. Anderson W.C. Weissman I.L. Global analysis of proliferation and cell cycle gene expression in the regulation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell fates.J. Exp. Med. 2005; 202: 1599-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar), we examined the mobilization of TKO hematopoietic progenitors. The spleen of Mx1-Cre TKO mice contained increased numbers of HSC and progenitor populations, indicative of extramedullary hematopoiesis (Figures 4A–4C). This was confirmed by the increase in the number of colonies formed by unfractioned splenocytes in methylcellulose (Figure 4D). Overall, there were approximately four times more Flk2− HSCs in the spleen of mutant mice compared to their BM (compare Figures 4C and 2C). KLS and MP cells were also more frequent in the PB of mutant mice (Figure 4E), providing further evidence of their increased mobilization. To test the homing capacity of TKO progenitors, lineage-negative cells, enriched in hematopoietic progenitors, were labeled with the fluorescent vital dye CFSE and transplanted into sublethally irradiated SCID mice. Under these conditions, fewer CFSE-labeled cells from Mx1-Cre TKO mice homed to the BM of the recipient mice (n = 10) (Figure 4F). Together, these data indicate that hyperproliferative TKO hematopoietic progenitors are constitutively mobilized and display a decreased homing capacity. The long-term engraftment potential of hematopoietic cells resides predominantly in the quiescent pool of HSCs (Fleming et al., 1993Fleming W.H. Alpern E.J. Uchida N. Ikuta K. Spangrude G.J.

Med. 2005; 202: 1599-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Because TKO HSCs are less quiescent than wild-type HSCs, we sought to test their reconstitution properties. To this end, 106 control or Mx1-Cre TKO BM cells expressing the Ly5.1 surface marker were transplanted together with 106 Ly5.1/Ly5.2 wild-type competitor cells into lethally irradiated Ly5.2 Rag2/commonγchain double mutant immunodeficient mice. Four weeks after transplantation, leukocyte chimerism was assessed in the PB. As shown in Figure 5A, Mx1-Cre TKO cells outcompeted control competitor cells in this short-term reconstitution setting. As expected given the expansion of these cells in TKO mice, this advantage was more pronounced in myeloid populations (Figure 5B). Strikingly, however, all the recipients of Mx1-Cre TKO cells died by week 5, while recipients of control cells survived (n = 5). Because irradiated mice that were not transplanted with any cells died ∼2 weeks after irradiation (data not shown), the death of mice reconstituted with TKO cells after 5 weeks suggested that TKO hematopoietic progenitors were only transiently able to reconstitute the hematopoietic system of recipient mice. Consistent with this idea, the BM cellularity was reduced in recipients of TKO cells compared to controls (Figure 5C). Despite this overall decreased cellularity, a majority of the mature hematopoietic cells were TKO and not wild-type competitors (Figure 5D). Importantly, hematopoietic progenitor cell numbers, including LT-HSCs, were significantly decreased in the BM of mice reconstituted with TKO cells (Figure 5E). Taken together, these results suggest that TKO early hematopoietic progenitors are very efficient at short-term repopulation, outcompeting wild-type cells and preventing their engraftment, probably by producing an outburst of myeloid cells. This observation may in part reflect the increased numbers of TKO KLS and mature myeloid cells transplanted as well as the hyperproliferative status of early progenitors. Nevertheless, hyperproliferative TKO HSCs are severely impaired in their long-term reconstitution potential in vivo, as illustrated by the decrease of LT- and ST-HSC populations and the rapid death of the transplanted recipients. This inability of TKO HSCs to reconstitute the blood system may have several nonexclusive causes, including, but not limited to, a reduced homing potential, an increased mobilization and an incapacity to stably reside in the BM that may be due to their hyperproliferative status, and a loss of self-renewal upon the stress of the transplantation. To further determine the kinetics and the cell autonomy of the TKO phenotype, we sought to investigate if these defects arose both rapidly and in transplanted mice. Low leaky expression of the Mx1 promoter in the absence of pI-pC injections and expression of this promoter in many cell types upon induction (data not shown) (Kuhn et al., 1995Kuhn R. Schwenk F. Aguet M. Rajewsky K. Inducible gene targeting in mice.Science. 1995; 269: 1427-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (1472) Google Scholar) precluded the use of the Mx1Cre TKO model for this purpose. To bypass this problem, we crossed condTKO mice to Rosa26Cre-ERT2 mice (Ventura et al., 2007Ventura A. Kirsch D.G. McLaughlin M.E. Tuveson D.A. Grimm J. Lintault L. Newman J. Reczek E.E. Weissleder R. Jacks T. Restoration of p53 function leads to tumour regression in vivo.Nature. 2007; 445: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (1274) Google Scholar). In these mice, Cre expression is very broad, but its activity is strictly dependent on tamoxifen injection (data not shown). Rosa26Cre-ERT2 TKO mice died on average 2–3 weeks after tamoxifen injection due to efficient deletion of the Rb and p130 alleles and loss of the entire Rb family in multiple cell types, including BM cells (Figure 6A and data not shown). Rosa26Cre-ERT2 TKO mice may die from digestive defects, as they show a rapid weight loss, but at these early time points, the spleen, thymus, and liver of mutant mice displayed normal appearance (data not shown). Two weeks after Cre induction, KLS, MP, and GMP cell numbers remained similar to control numbers in the BM of Rosa26Cre-ERT2 TKO mice. However, both CMP and CLP populations were already significantly decreased in Rosa26Cre-ERT2 TKO mice (Figure 6B and Figure S4A). In addition, analysis of mature BM cells already showed a significant increase in the pre-M population and a decrease in the B cell lineage (Figure 6C and Figure S4B). Thus, the shift toward the myeloid lineage is very rapid in TKO mice. To further probe the mechanisms underlying this phenotype, we tested the apoptotic activity in control and TKO hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells using Annexin V staining. We found that the number of apoptotic KLS and MP TKO cells was low but that TKO CLP cells displayed a significant increase in cell death compared to controls (Figure 6D), suggesting that enhanced death is one mechanism leading to decreased numbers of lymphoid cells in TKO mice. Increased proliferation was also observed in the BM of Rosa26Cre-ERT2 TKO mice 2 weeks after Cre induction, most strikingly in the KLS population, wh"

To address this, we devised a strategy using a fluorescent reporter gene under the transcriptional control of the anterior endoderm marker Hex alongside the definitive mesendoderm marker Cxcr4. Isolation of Hex+Cxcr4+ differentiating ESCs yielded a population expressing ADE markers that both can be expanded and is competent to undergo differentiation toward liver and pancreatic fates. Hex reporter ESCs were also used to define conditions for ADE specification in serum-free adherent culture and revealed an unexpected role for FGF signaling in the generation of ADE.

Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) hold tremendous promise as both a source of functional differentiated cell types for regenerative medicine and as an in vitro system for the study of developmental biology. Successful differentiation of ESCs to neural, hematopoietic, and epidermal cell types involves a progression through intermediate progenitor states prior to terminal differentiation (Bagutti et al., 1996Bagutti C.

It is likely that successful differentiation of endodermal lineages from ESCs will also depend on efficiently recapitulating the stepwise progression that occurs during normal embryogenesis. The anterior definitive endoderm (ADE) originates in the primitive streak, and these cells migrate anteriorly during embryogenesis and have an important role in patterning the anterior neural axis (Lu et al., 2001Lu C.C. Brennan J. Robertson E.J. From fertilization to gastrulation: axis formation in the mouse embryo.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 384-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Later, during gut tube formation, they migrate ventrally to form the ventral foregut, which contains a population of bipotent precursors of the liver and pancreas (Deutsch et al., 2001Deutsch G.

In mouse, this has relied on reporter ESC lines that contain a marker under the control of panmesendodermal or axial mesendodermal promoters. These cannot be used to identify positionally specified populations such as the ADE. Previous attempts to generate specialized endodermal cell types from mixed mesendodermal cultures have proved inefficient and may not reflect the normal developmental process. For example, cultures from differentiated ESCs expressing high levels of the panmesendodermal markers Foxa2 and Brachyury have been used to produce hepatocytes. These differentiated hepatoblast-like cells express AFP but reduced levels of albumin (Gouon-Evans et al., 2006Gouon-Evans V. Boussemart L. Gadue P. Nierhoff D. Koehler C.I. Kubo A. Shafritz D.A. Keller G. BMP-4 is required for hepatic specification of mouse embryonic stem cell-derived definitive endoderm.Nat. Biotechnol. 2006; 24: 1402-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Encouraging as these studies are, they failed to identify a defined positional intermediate with an appropriate in vivo correlate, and as a result these cells may have arisen via a nonphysiological route of differentiation. The generation and purification of this intermediate, in vitro-derived ADE, would be predicted to better recapitulate in vivo differentiation and afford opportunities for mechanistic dissection of downstream differentiation. Hex is a homeobox-containing transcriptional repressor that is one of the earliest markers of ADE and has also been shown to suppress more posterior, panmesodermal identities (Brickman et al., 2000Brickman J.M. Jones C.M. Clements M. Smith J.C. Beddington R.S.P.

Hex acts with beta-catenin to regulate anteroposterior patterning via a Groucho-related co-repressor and Nodal.Development. 2006; 133: 3709-3722Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In addition to its expression in the ADE, Hex is expressed in the extraembryonic visceral endoderm, in an early patterning center known as the anterior visceral endoderm (AVE) (Thomas et al., 1998Thomas P.Q. Brown A. Beddington R.S.P. Hex: a homeobox gene revealing peri-implantation asymmetry in the mouse embryo and an early transient marker of endothelial cell precursors.Development. 1998; 125: 85-94PubMed Google Scholar). Cxcr4 is a cell surface marker expressed in early embryonic mesoderm and endoderm, but not the AVE (McGrath et al., 1999McGrath K.E. Koniski A.D. Maltby K.M. McGann J.K. Palis J. Embryonic expression and function of the chemokine SDF-1 and its receptor, CXCR4.Dev. Biol. 1999; 213: 442-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, Yasunaga et al., 2005Yasunaga M. Tada S.

Biotechnol. 2005; 23: 1542-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Using Hex in conjunction with Cxcr4, we have developed a novel strategy for the induction and isolation of ADE cells from differentiating ESC cultures. Significant numbers of ADE cells could be induced and isolated, and using our optimized protocols we show that ADE cells have an enhanced capacity to further differentiate toward pancreatic and hepatic progenitors. Moreover, we were able to establish defined conditions in which these cells could be expanded while retaining their capacity to differentiate. This study represents the first report of the generation and isolation of endoderm with a specific anterior-posterior (A-P) identity from ESCs. The production of ADE cells in culture has enabled us to define requirements for activin and BMP signaling and suggests a role for FGF signaling in the induction or propagation of the anteriormost mesendoderm. We created ESC lines containing the marker gene RedStar (RS) (Knop et al., 2002Knop M. Barr F. Riedel C.G. Heckel T. Reichel C. Improved version of the red fluorescent protein (drFP583/DsRed/RFP).Biotechniques. 2002; 33 (592, 594, 596–598 passim)PubMed Google Scholar) under the control of the Hex locus (Figures 1A and 1B). These cells allowed us to monitor the emergence of newly formed ADE cells during in vitro differentiation. Two independent clones with normal karotype, HexRedStar (HexRS) 1 and 2, were selected for further analysis. To confirm that expression of RS protein accurately reflects endogenous Hex expression, HexRS1 ESCs were used to generate a HexRS mouse line. Embryos from HexRS/+ intercrosses are shown in Figure 1C. Red fluorescence was detected in the ADE, foregut as well as the liver and thyroid primordia, reflecting the expression of endogenous Hex protein as reported by Thomas et al., 1998Thomas P.Q. Brown A. Beddington R.S.P. Hex: a homeobox gene revealing peri-implantation asymmetry in the mouse embryo and an early transient marker of endothelial cell precursors.Development. 1998; 125: 85-94PubMed Google Scholar. Weak expression was also observed in the intersomitic vessels, endocardium of the heart, and aspects of the dorsal aorta reflecting endogenous Hex expression in hematopoietic/endothelial precursors. Consistent with the previously described phenotype (Martinez Barbera et al., 2000Martinez Barbera J.P. Clements M. Thomas P. Rodriguez T. Meloy D. Kioussis D. Beddington R.S. The homeobox gene Hex is required in definitive endodermal tissues for normal forebrain, liver and thyroid formation.Development. 2000; 127: 2433-2445PubMed Google Scholar), no live HexRS/RS mice were born (see Table S1 available online), and HexRS/RS embryos appear to recapitulate the Hex null phenotype (Figure 1C). Importantly, no phenotype was detected in HexRS/+ embryos or mice (Figure 1C, Table S1), indicating that any reduced Hex dosage in heterozygous cells will not impact on the ability of the cells to form ADE cells in vitro. The secreted TGF-β ligand activin has previously been shown to induce mesendoderm in Xenopus animal cap assays (reviewed in Okabayashi and Asashima, 2003Okabayashi K. Asashima M. Tissue generation from amphibian animal caps.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2003; 13: 502-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and ESCs in culture (Kubo et al., 2004Kubo A. Shinozaki K. Shannon J.M. Kouskoff V. Kennedy M. Woo S. Fehling H.J. Keller G. Development of definitive endoderm from embryonic stem cells in culture.Development. 2004; 131: 1651-1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar, Tada et al., 2005Tada S. Era T. Furusawa C.

Characterization of mesendoderm: a diverging point of the definitive endoderm and mesoderm in embryonic stem cell differentiation culture.Development. 2005; 132: 4363-4374Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). To test the ability of activin to induce HexRS expression, ESCs were differentiated in a two-step aggregation culture system in serum-containing media for 48 hr followed by serum-free media supplemented with activin for 5 days. Under these conditions, 6.8%–8.6% of cells were RS positive (RS+) at day 7 (Figure 2A). RT-PCR analysis on purified RS+ cell populations revealed they expressed Sox17, Cer1, E-cadherin, and Gata4, indicating these cells have an endoderm identity (Figure 2B). Hex is also expressed in mesodermal cell populations during early development including haemangioblast, angioblastic, and endothelial precursor populations (Kubo et al., 2005Kubo A. Chen V. Kennedy M. Zahradka E. Daley G.Q. Keller G.

Hex: a homeobox gene revealing peri-implantation asymmetry in the mouse embryo and an early transient marker of endothelial cell precursors.Development. 1998; 125: 85-94PubMed Google Scholar). Flow cytometry analysis for the hematopoietic marker CD45 and endothelial marker CD31 showed that our activin-treated cultures do not contain significant numbers of these cells (Figure S1A), although the HRS cells can support hematopoietic differentiation (Figure 2C). Using a Sox-1 GFP reporter ESC line, we also confirmed that our cultures do not contain neuroectodermal cells (Figure S1B). In addition to marking early ADE specification, Hex is also expressed in the AVE. To distinguish ADE from AVE, we used the chemokine receptor Cxcr4 that is expressed in definitive mesoderm and endoderm populations but excluded from all yolk sac visceral endoderm (McGrath et al., 1999McGrath K.E. Koniski A.D. Maltby K.M. McGann J.K. Palis J. Embryonic expression and function of the chemokine SDF-1 and its receptor, CXCR4.Dev.

Nishikawa S. Induction and monitoring of definitive and visceral endoderm differentiation of mouse ES cells.Nat. Biotechnol. 2005; 23: 1542-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Optimization of media, additives, and cell density (summarized in Tables S2 and Table S3) identified a regimen in which ESCs cultured in suspension for 2 days and then 5 days serum-free in the presence of activin and EGF yielded significant numbers of RS/Cxcr4 double-positive (H+C+) cells as assessed by flow cytometry (Figure 2D). As might be expected, antagonists of ADE specification in vivo, Bmp4 and retinoic acid, blocked the induction of the RS+ population (Table S2) without effecting Cxcr4 induction (data not shown). To assess whether our differentiating ESC cultures display a gene expression pattern similar to that observed during ADE induction, we examined a range of markers during a time course (Figure 3A). Epiblast markers, Oct4 (Pou5f1), Nodal, and E-cadherin were expressed during the early phase of in vitro differentiation and then downregulated concurrent with the expression of the early primitive streak markers Wnt3 and Brachyury (Tbra). Mixer-like 1 (Mixl1), Goosecoid (Gsc), and Foxa2, which define the streak region and prospective axial mesendoderm (notochord, prechordal plate, and ADE), began to be expressed at day 3, and peaked at day 5–6. Importantly, genes expressed in the ADE, Cerberus 1 homolog (Cer1), Hex, and Sox17 appeared between days 5 and 7 in our cultures. Although Mixl1 and Wnts have been implicated in endoderm induction (Hart et al., 2002Hart A.H. Hartley L. Sourris K. Stadler E.S. Li R. Stanley E.G. Tam P.P. Elefanty A.G. Robb L.

In our culture conditions, these markers are significantly expressed from day 3–5 and are then downregulated concordant with the emergence of markers of ADE. Thus, the dynamic pattern of expression evident in our differentiating ESC cultures is similar to that during ADE specification in vivo. Furthermore, Cxcr4 and Hex protein is present from days 4 and 5, respectively (Figures 3A–3C), consistent with the expression of these markers in vivo (McGrath et al., 1999McGrath K.E. Koniski A.D. Maltby K.M. McGann J.K. Palis J. Embryonic expression and function of the chemokine SDF-1 and its receptor, CXCR4.Dev.

Expression of chemokine receptor CXCR4 during chick embryo development.Anat. Embryol. (Berl.). 2005; 210: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This suggests that the Cxcr4 single-positive population may represent noncommitted mesendoderm or a mixture of mesoderm and endoderm precursors, whereas the H+C+ population is committed ADE. The sequential expression of a number of markers observed in Figure 3A is also consistent with differentiation toward ADE rather than AVE. Differentiating cultures were sorted into four populations based on RS (H) and Cxcr4 (C) protein levels and profiled by quantitative RT-PCR, microarrays, and immunomarkers. Levels of both Hex and Cxcr4 mRNA were highest in the H+C+ cell fraction, confirming the success of cell sorting. Surprisingly, we found that the transcript level of Hex in the H+C− and H−C+ populations were very similar and significantly less than the H+C+ population (Figure 4A). This may reflect the time lag between the production of Hex transcript and the presence of RS protein. The H+C+ cell population expressed the highest levels of E-cadherin, Cxcr4, Cer1, and Hex transcript (Figure 4A), all of which are expressed in the ADE. Importantly, the expression of markers Tbra, Wnt3, and Mixl1 that are associated with the early primitive streak, but not the ADE, were low in the H+C+ population. Markers of posterior endoderm (Cdx2), paraxial mesoderm (Meox1), and parietal endoderm (Sox7) were only detected at very low levels during differentiation and barely detectable in the H+C+ cell population (Figure 4A). In accordance with the PCR data, immunostaining showed almost all of the H+C+ cells to express the ADE marker Cer1 and the definitive endoderm markers Foxa2 and E-cadherin, but not the ESC marker Oct4 (Figure 4B). Microarray analysis of the four Hex/Cxcr4 cell fractions sorted from day 7 differentiated cultures showed that these fractions cluster close to each other and not to the samples derived from undifferentiated ESC cultures (Figure 4C). The close clustering of the two ESC lines to each other indicates there is little difference in gene expression in HexRS heterozygote and wild-type ESCs. Of the differentiated populations, the H+C+ population is most closely related to the H−C+ population, consistent with the view that the H+C+ ADE cells arises from the H−C+ mesendodermal cell population. Hierarchical clustering of the differentially expressed genes identified in a pairwise analysis of all four populations is shown in Figure 4D. This analysis supports the expression analysis in Figure 4A and gives a clear indication of the unique signature of the H+C+ fraction, which expresses a significant number of ADE markers such as Cer1, Frizzled 5, Lhx1 (Lim1), Otx2, and a number of previously unidentified gene products. Quantitative RT-PCR validation supports the identity of this expression cluster as unique to the H+C+ fraction (Figure 4E). We conclude from these data that the H+C+ population is enriched for the expression of anterior markers, normally expressed in the ADE. Since both pancreas and liver arise from ADE, we tested the hepatic potential of the H+C+ population using a method adapted from Gouon-Evans et al., 2006Gouon-Evans V. Boussemart L. Gadue P. Nierhoff D. Koehler C.I. Kubo A. Shafritz D.A. Keller G. BMP-4 is required for hepatic specification of mouse embryonic stem cell-derived definitive endoderm.Nat. Biotechnol. 2006; 24: 1402-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, which involves up to 13 additional days of hepatocyte differentiation (total culture period 20 days). By day 12, AFP-positive hepatoblasts were apparent in the H+C+ cell fraction, and while some AFP expression was observed in all four fractions, it was significantly higher in the double-positive fraction (Figure 5C). No AFP-positive cells were formed from noninduced ESCs cultured in the same conditions (data not shown). This trend was already apparent at the RNA level from day 9, where the H+C+ fraction expressed at least 3- to 4-fold higher levels of Krt19, albumin, AFP, Hnf6, and Foxa2 transcript than any of the other fractions (Figure 5B). The pattern of Hex expression during the differentiation period is also consistent with its later expression in the liver primordia (Thomas et al., 1998Thomas P.Q. Brown A. Beddington R.S.P. Hex: a homeobox gene revealing peri-implantation asymmetry in the mouse embryo and an early transient marker of endothelial cell precursors.Development. 1998; 125: 85-94PubMed Google Scholar; Figure 1C) with RS protein detected at day 9 in forming hepatocytes but only in the H+C+ and weakly in H+C− sorted cells (Figure 5A). Flow cytometry at this stage of differentiation also supports the quantitative capacity of the H+C+ fraction to differentiate toward liver, as 62% of the early hepatocyte cultures resulting from H+C+-sorted cells were Hex positive, whereas only 11% of the H−C+ population was weakly fluorescent (Figure 5A). By day 20, AFP expression was reduced and the number of albumin-positive cells had increased significantly in the H+C+ population, reflecting the maturation of hepatoblasts to hepatocytes (Figure 5D). At this stage, albumin expression was not detected in the other fractions (data not shown). On the contrary, under these conditions large numbers of cardiomyocytes were observed in H−C+ and double-negative fractions (Figure 5E). Taken together, these results suggest H+C+ fraction contains lineage-restricted endodermal progenitors. To examine the pancreatic potential of the sorted cell populations, we cultured them with cytokines implicated in pancreatic specification (Hebrok et al., 1998Hebrok M. Kim S.K. Melton D.A.

H+C+-sorted cells generated clusters expressing markers of the emerging pancreatic buds, Pdx1 and Hnf4α with the highest efficiency, indicating their pancreatic differentiation potential in vitro (Figure 5F). In contrast, H+C− fractions did not give rise to coexpressing clusters. Limited potential was detected from the H−C+ and H−C− fractions with 2- and 9-fold reduced cluster number, respectively, and reduced Pdx1 and Hnf4α immunostaining intensity for both (Figure 5F, H−C− data not shown), presumably reflecting some ability of noncommitted cells to generate ADE upon further culture. Using undifferentiated ESCs as a starting population for this 5-day protocol did not generate any Pdx1- or Hnf4α-positive cells (data not shown). When this protocol was repeated substituting FGF10 for FGF4 based on a human ESC differentiation protocol described by D'Amour et al., 2006D'Amour K.A. Bang A.G. Eliazer S. Kelly O.G. Agulnick A.D. Smart N.G. Moorman M.A. Kroon E. Carpenter M.K. Baetge E.E. Production of pancreatic hormone-expressing endocrine cells from human embryonic stem cells.Nat. Biotechnol. 2006; 24: 1392-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (1431) Google Scholar, a similar (3-fold) quantitative enhancement in cluster formation in the H+C+ fraction was obtained (data not shown). To evaluate the in vivo potency exhibited by cells in each H/C fraction, they were sorted at day 7 of differentiation and immediately transplanted under the kidney capsule of adult mice. Nine transplants were performed for each sorted fraction. The H−C− transplants gave rise to large teratomas (five out of nine), indicating these fractions still contained some ESCs. In contrast, no teratomas were generated from the H+C+ transplants. The H+C+ cells in one animal (one out of nine) gave rise to a small growth that contained endodermal derivatives indicated by the presence of ductal epithelial structures containing PAS positive secretory granules (Figure 5G). Similar epithelial structures were observed in the growths from the H−C+ grafts (four out of nine) and H+C− grafts (three out of nine). The H−C+ transplants were the only ones (excluding the H−C− teratomas) that contained cartilage (Figure 5G), consistent with the notion that this fraction still contains cells competent to generate both mesoderm and endoderm. During the early phase of further ADE differentiation, we noticed that purified H+C+ ADE proliferated in the presence of FGF2, BMP4, and VEGF. To test whether these conditions could be used to expand H+C+ ADE progenitors, the four H/C fractions purified by flow cytometry were plated in defined media incorporating these cytokines. All four populations were seeded at approximately 10% confluence and the growth of the red population observed over time. Initially all four population were able to grow, but only the H+C+ fraction contained significant numbers of Hex-positive cells (Figure 6A). While these cultures were not homogeneous, the H+C+ fractions were able to give rise to Hex-positive colonies upon repeated passaging (Figure 6B), and the percentage of Hex-positive cells in these cultures expanded over time, reaching as high as 96% (Figure S2). Cultures were routinely split 1:2 or 1:3 (see the Experimental Procedures) for eight passages to generate cultures that were a minimum of 90% Hex positive by passage seven. Based on these figures, this constituted a 1944-fold expansion of putative ADE. In contrast, cells from the other three fractions (H+C−, H−C+, and H−C−) were unable to survive multiple passages. To confirm the identity of cultured H+C+ cells, we examined the expression of the endoderm markers Foxa2 and E-cadherin, the ADE marker Cer1, and ESC marker Oct4 at passage five. The majority of cells within these cultures expressed Cer1, Foxa2, and E-cadherin, but not Oct4 (Figure 6C), indicating these cells represent a form of ADE progenitor. To confirm that these cultures were predominantly ADE, we quantitated the percentage of cells expressing these markers and found that 79% (±1.4) expressed Cer1, 71% (±14) expressed Hex, and 54% (±2.8%) expressed E-cadherin. Moreover, quantitation of the DAPI staining shown in Figure 6 and similar images indicated that the E-cadherin-expressing fraction contained greater than 3-fold more mitotic nuclei than E-cadherin-negative fraction, supporting the notion that the endodermal progenitors in these cultures are the major proliferating cell type. The ability of these cultures at passage seven to further differentiate toward hepatic and pancreatic cell types was tested as described above. Pancreatic differentiation produced clusters of Nkx2.2 and Pdx1-expressing cells (Figure 6D), whereas hepatic differentiation resul"

A body of evidence suggests that Aβ is actively transported from brain parenchyma to blood across the blood-brain barrier (BBB), although the precise mechanism remains unclear. To unravel the cellular and molecular mechanism of Aβ transport across the BBB, we established a new in vitro model of the initial internalization step of Aβ transport using TR-BBB cells, a conditionally immortalized endothelial cell line from rat brain. We show that TR-BBB cells rapidly internalize Aβ through a receptor-mediated mechanism. We also provide evidence that Aβ internalization is mediated by LRP1 (low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1), since administration of LRP1 antagonist, receptor-associated protein, neutralizing antibody, or small interference RNAs all reduced Aβ uptake. Despite the requirement of LRP1-dependent internalization, Aβ does not directly bind to LRP1 in an in vitro binding assay. Unlike TR-BBB cells, mouse embryonic fibroblasts endogenously expressing functional LRP1 and exhibiting the authentic LRP1-mediated endocytosis (e.g. of tissue plasminogen activator) did not show rapid Aβ uptake. Based on these data, we propose that the rapid LRP1-dependent internalization of Aβ occurs under the BBB-specific cellular context and that TR-BBB is a useful tool for analyzing the molecular mechanism of the rapid transport of Aβ across BBB.

The BBB is considered as a three-cell archetype composed of brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs), astrocytes, and supporting pericytes. It does not normally allow a free exchange of macromolecules between brain and blood, due to the presence of tight junctions formed by BMECs (17.Zlokovic B.V. Pharm. Res. 1995; 12: 1395-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), which suggests a receptor-mediated transport mechanism for the efflux of Aβ across the BBB. It has been suggested that LRP1 (low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1) is involved in the Aβ efflux transport at the BBB in vivo (15.Shibata M. Yamada S. Kumar S.R. Calero M. Bading J.

Neuron. 2004; 43: 333-344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar), although there is no direct evidence to support the role of LRP1 in BMECs, the latter bordering the outer limit of the BBB. Thus, there is a compelling need for an endothelial cell model that can recapitulate the transport of Aβ and other macromolecules across the BBB and with which a precise molecular mechanism of Aβ transport across the BBB could be elucidated. To verify the molecular and cellular mechanisms of Aβ transport across the BBB, application of cell biological and physiological techniques at a single cell level is mandatory. In this study, we adopted the TR-BBB cells, a conditionally immortalized cell line derived from brain capillary endothelial cells of transgenic rats expressing temperature-sensitive large T antigen (19.Terasaki T. Hosoya K. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 2001; 24: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), whose inactivation upon incubation at 37 °C renders the cells into a nonimmortalized state similar to primary BMECs. TR-BBB cells have been shown to express a number of receptors and transporters expressed in endothelial cells comprising the BBB (e.g. GLUT-1, P-glycoprotein (P-gp), and other influx or efflux transporters, allowing for the characterization of their functions in vitro (20.Hosoya K.I. Takashima T. Tetsuka K. Nagura T. Ohtsuki S. Takanaga H. Ueda M. Yanai N. Obinata M. Terasaki T. J. Drug Target. 2000; 8: 357-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Using TR-BBB cells, we established an in vitro model of Aβ uptake and found that LRP1 is involved in the rapid and robust Aβ internalization in TR-BBB cells. In contrast, fibroblasts or neuroblastoma cells that express LRP1 did not internalize Aβ, suggesting that LRP1 is not sufficient for the rapid internalization of Aβ, implicating cell type specificity in the LRP1-dependent Aβ uptake.

Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) genetically deficient in LRP1 (PEA13 cells), LRP1 (+/–) MEFs (PEA10 cells), and normal MEFs (MEF-1 cells) derived from the same mouse strain were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, as described previously (32.Willnow T.E.

In Vitro Uptake Assays of 125I-Labeled Proteins in TR-BBB Cells—The uptake of 125I-Aβ or 125I-tPA into TR-BBB cells was examined as reported previously (33.Tanabe S. Shimohigashi Y. Nakayama Y.

Briefly, TR-BBB cells cultured onto collagen I coated 24-well dishes were grown to 90–100% confluence. Prior to experiments, cells were washed three times with 1 ml of ECF buffer (138 mm NaCl, 5.0 mm KCl, 1.3 mm CaCl2, 0.8 mm MgCl2, 0.3 mm KH2PO4, 0.3 mm Na2HPO4, 5.6 mm d-glucose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) and incubated at 37 °C with 125I-labeled ligand proteins for a predetermined time period. After incubation, 125I-labeled ligand proteins were removed, and the cells were washed three times with 1 ml of ice-cold ECF buffer and an additional three times with acid wash buffer (28 mm CH3COONa, 120 mm NaCl, 20 mm sodium barbital, pH 3.0). In some experiments, cells were further treated with Pronase (1 mg/ml; Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C to completely remove cell surface-attached radioligands. The amount of surface-bound labeled ligands was calculated as the amount of ligands released by this treatment, and the amount of internalized ligands was defined as the amount of ligands that remained associated with the cell pellet following this treatment. Cells were solubilized with 200 μl of 5 m NaOH for 12 h, and the protein amount in the cells was measured by the Lowry method. The amount of the cell-associated ligands was expressed as the cell/medium ratio (see below). The cell/medium ratio (μl/mg of protein) is equal to 125I counts in the cells (cpm/mg protein)/125I counts in the incubation medium (cpm/μl). When the effects of various inhibitors or siRNA against LRP1 were studied, TR-BBB cells were incubated with 125I-Aβ and 125I-tPA for 5 and 10 min, respectively. In the efflux assay, TR-BBB cells were first incubated with 125I-Aβ for 10 min (first incubation). After incubation, the media were replaced with the ECF buffer (incubation medium), and cells were further incubated at 37 °C for a various time period to allow efflux of Aβ (second incubation). Degradation of 125I-Aβ was studied by a trichloroacetic acid precipitation assay (15.Shibata M. Yamada S. Kumar S.R. Calero M. Bading J. Frangione B. Holtzman D.M. Miller C.A. Strickland D.K. Ghiso J. Zlokovic B.V. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 1489-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar). Incubation medium was mixed with trichloroacetic acid (final concentration, 10%) and bovine serum albumin (final concentration, 1.25%) and centrifuged for 20 min, and the radioactivities in the precipitate and supernatant were quantitated by a γ counter. We confirmed that ∼85–90% of total 125I-Aβ in medium prior to the first incubation was trichloroacetic acid-precipitable. Thus, we quantitated the extent of trichloroacetic acid precipitability of Aβ prior to the first incubation upon each experiment and normalized the level of trichloroacetic acid-precipitable Aβ in incubation medium at each time point upon the second incubation by the precipitation extent and indicated the ratio of trichloroacetic acid-precipitable Aβ as the percentage of that at time 0 of the first incubation. For the uptake assay of Aβ·apoE complex, Aβ was preincubated with apoE4-containing lipoproteins (2 μg/ml) for 30 min at room temperature. To examine the involvement of heparan sulfate proteoglycans or chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans in 125I-Aβ uptake, TR-BBB cells were preincubated in medium containing heprinase I (Seikagaku), heparinase II (Sigma), heparinase III (Sigma), or condroitinase ABC (Seikagaku) at a concentration of 1 sigma unit/ml for 4 h at 37 °C, followed by three washes with ECF buffer. Transfection of Small Interference RNA (siRNA) against Rat LRP1—Control siRNA (Stealth™ RNAi negative control medium GC duplex 2) and two Stealth RNAis against rat LRP1 (siRNA 1, 5′-UUGACAUUCGGAUCACAGACGUGGG-3′; siRNA 2, 5′-AUGAAUGCCCGUUUGAUGGCUUGGG-3′) were purchased from Invitrogen. TR-BBB cells cultured in 24-well dishes were transfected with 42 pmol of siRNA duplex using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The Lipofectamine RNAiMAX and siRNA mixture were incubated with TR-BBB cells for 30 h. Transfected TR-BBB cells were collected for immunoblotting or uptake assays as described above. Binding of Aβ to Immobilized LRP1 in Vitro—An in vitro binding assay was performed as described previously (29.Hashimoto T. Wakabayashi T. Watanabe A. Kowa H. Hosoda R. Nakamura A. Kanazawa I. Arai T. Takio K. Mann D.M. Iwatsubo T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1524-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Briefly, microtiter wells were coated with purified full-length human LRP1 or recombinant sLRP2, sLRP4, or bovine serum albumin (negative control) at 4 °C. Unoccupied sites were blocked with Block Ace (Snow Brand, Sapporo, Japan) and washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20. Wells were then incubated with 100 nm Aβ or tPA in the presence or absence of 1 μm RAP for 12 h, washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20, and then reacted with an anti-Aβ antibody (BA27; gift of Takeda Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.) (34.Asami-Odaka A. Ishibashi Y. Kikuchi T. Kitada C. Suzuki N. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10272-10278Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) or anti-tPA (Oxford Biomedical Research) antibodies for 3 h. After incubation with a horseradish peroxidase-tagged secondary antibody (GE Healthcare), the levels of ligands bound to LRP1 were quantitated by development using a TMB microwell system (KPL, Inc.). Preparation of Radiolabeled tPA—Human tPA was iodinated, using IODO-GEN-precoated tubes, according to the manufacturer's instructions. The unincorporated 125I was removed using a D-salt polyacrylamide desalting column. Aβ Is Internalized by TR-BBB Cells in a Specific Manner—We reasoned that if Aβ is transported across the BBB, Aβ should be internalized by BMECs. To test this, we used TR-BBB cells, an in vitro cellular model in which the internalization in BBB endothelial cells can be analyzed (19.Terasaki T. Hosoya K. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 2001; 24: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We first evaluated the uptake of 125I-Aβ in monolayer cultures of TR-BBB cells. First, we checked whether 125I-Aβ-(1–40) does not form oligomers at the concentration used in this study (0.1 nm) by a light-induced chemical cross-linking experiment, PICUP, an efficient method for detecting SDS-sensitive Aβ assemblies by forming covalently cross-linked Aβ oligomers (30.Bitan G. Lomakin A. Teplow D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35176-35184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 31.Bitan G. Kirkitadze M.D. Lomakin A. Vollers S.S. Benedek G.B. Teplow D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 330-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar). The oligomerization state of each peptide after cross-linking was determined by immunoblot analysis or autoradiography. When 20 μm of unlabeled Aβ was subjected to PICUP reaction, several covalently cross-linked oligomer bands (i.e. dimer, trimer, and tetramer) appeared in an irradiation-dependent manner, suggesting that a fraction of Aβ formed SDS-sensitive oligomers in the solution (supplemental Fig. 1). In contrast, 0.1 nm 125I-Aβ-(1–40) did not exhibit any cross-linked oligomers, and only a single band migrating at 4 kDa was detected even after the PICUP reaction (supplemental Fig. 1). This suggested that the concentration of 125I-Aβ-(1–40) used in this experiment was low enough to eliminate formation of oligomers. Cells grown in collagen-coated dishes were incubated with 125I-Aβ-(1–40). After incubation, cells were extensively washed with acid wash buffer to remove 125I-Aβ that remained on cell surface. The remaining radioactivities in TR-BBB cells that represent 125I-Aβ were calculated as cell/medium ratio (μl/mg) (see “Experimental Procedures”). Incubation with 125I-Aβ at 37 °C elicited a rapid and robust uptake of 125I-Aβ by TR-BBB cells with total uptake reaching a plateau within 8 min (Fig. 1A). This rapid uptake of 125I-Aβ was not observed at 4 °C, suggesting that the Aβ uptake is a receptor-mediated event. The uptake was competed by the addition of excess unlabeled synthetic Aβ-(1–40) in a concentration-dependent manner, with an IC50 of ∼600 nm (Fig. 1B). Because the uptake assays were performed in serum-free medium, it is unlikely that Aβ uptake requires a prior complex formation of Aβ with serum proteins (e.g. apoE or α2-macroglobulin) (35.Qiu Z. Strickland D.K. Hyman B.T. Rebeck G.W. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1393-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 36.Gylys K.H. Fein J.A. Tan A.M. Cole G.M. J.

To more rigorously estimate the amount of internalized Aβ into TR-BBB cells, we further treated TR-BBB cells with Pronase after incubation with 125I-Aβ at 37 °C to remove surface-bound Aβ. We defined “cell-bound” Aβ as the sum of surface-bound Aβ that includes the binding to specific receptor(s) as well as nonspecific binding and defined “internalized” Aβ as the amount of Aβ taken up into cells and resistant to Pronase treatment (Fig. 1C). TR-BBB cells retained certain levels of 125I-Aβ radioactivity even after Pronase treatment, which was reduced by co-incubation with unlabeled Aβ-(1–40), confirming that Aβ is actually internalized into cells (Fig. 1D). We also found that unlabeled Aβ-(1–42) blocked internalization of 125I-Aβ-(1–40) with an efficacy similar to that of Aβ-(1–40) (Fig. 1D). Taken together, our data show that TR-BBB cells rapidly internalize Aβ possibly through a receptor-mediated mechanism and that Aβ-(1–40) and Aβ-(1–42) probably share the same receptor. TR-BBB Cells Partially Degrade Internalized Aβ and Release Fragments and Intact Aβ into Culture Medium—To examine the fate of internalized Aβ, we performed an efflux assay. TR-BBB cells were first incubated with 125I-Aβ for 10 min, and the media were then replaced with the ECF buffer. Cells were further incubated at 37 °C for various periods of time to allow efflux of Aβ. We found that the cell/medium ratio of Aβ internalized into TR-BBB cells was rapidly decreased over the incubation time (shown as cell in Fig. 2A). Concurrently, the radioactivity in the incubation medium was increased (shown as medium in Fig. 2A), suggesting that the internalized Aβ is rapidly effluxed into the culture medium (Fig. 2A). We next precipitated Aβ released into culture medium by trichloroacetic acid and found that ∼80% of 125I-Aβ in the culture medium escaped trichloroacetic acid precipitation and that the ratio of 125I-Aβ precipitated by trichloroacetic acid was constant for 15 min (Fig. 2B). However, SDS-PAGE analysis of culture medium revealed that a portion of effluxed Aβ remained intact and migrated at 4 kDa, which increased in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 2C). These data suggest that a significant proportion of internalized Aβ was degraded within TR-BBB cells before being released into the extracellular space. Aβ Internalization Is Inhibited by RAP or Anti-LRP1 Antibody—We next examined whether LRP1 plays a major role in the internalization of 125I-Aβ into TR-BBB cells. We conducted the experiments in the presence of RAP, an antagonist of low density lipoprotein receptor family proteins, including LRP1 (39.Bu G. Maksymovitch E.A. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13002-13009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When TR-BBB cells were incubated with 125I-Aβ in the presence of RAP, the uptake of 125I-Aβ was significantly inhibited (Fig. 3A). The strong inhibitory effect of Aβ uptake by RAP was observed even after Pronase treatment. The internalization of 125I-Aβ by TR-BBB cells was significantly inhibited by RAP, at an extent of ∼90% of that inhibited by unlabeled Aβ-(1–40) (Fig. 3B). Aβ binding to the cell su"

Identification and characterization of these niches is essential for understanding stem cell maintenance and tissue regeneration. Here we report on the identification of a novel stem cell niche in Botryllus schlosseri, a colonial urochordate with high stem cell-mediated developmental activities. Using in vivo cell labeling, engraftment, confocal microscopy, and time-lapse imaging, we have identified cells with stemness capabilities in the anterior ventral region of the Botryllus' endostyle. These cells proliferate and migrate to regenerating organs in developing buds and buds of chimeric partners but do not contribute to the germ line. When cells are transplanted from the endostyle region, they contribute to tissue development and induce long-term chimerism in allogeneic tissues. In contrast, cells from other Botryllus' regions do not show comparable stemness capabilities. Cumulatively, these results define the Botryllus' endostyle region as an adult somatic stem cell niche."
https://openalex.org/W2004795993,"Synthetic atrial natriuretic peptide (carperitide) and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP; nesiritide) are used to treat congestive heart failure. However, despite beneficial cardiac unloading properties, reductions in renal perfusion pressures limit their clinical effectiveness. Recently, CD-NP, a chimeric peptide composed of C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) fused to the C-terminal tail of Dendroaspis natriuretic peptide (DNP), was shown to be more glomerular filtration rate-enhancing than BNP in dogs. However, the molecular basis for the increased responsiveness was not determined. Here, we show that the DNP tail has a striking effect on CNP, converting it from a non-agonist to a partial agonist of natriuretic peptide receptor (NPR)-A while maintaining the ability to activate NPR-B. This effect is specific for human receptors because CD-NP was only a slightly better activator of rat NPR-A due to the promiscuous nature of CNP in this species. Interesting, the DNP tail alone had no effect on any NPR even though it is effective in vivo. To further increase the potency of CD-NP for NPR-A, we converted two different triplet sequences within the CNP ring to their corresponding residues in BNP. Both variants demonstrated increased affinity and full agonist activity for NPR-A, whereas one was as potent as any NPR-A activator known. In contrast to a previous report, we found that DNP binds the natriuretic peptide clearance receptor (NPR-C). However, none of the chimeric peptides bound NPR-C with significantly higher affinity than endogenous ligands. We suggest that bifunctional chimeric peptides represent a new generation of natriuretic peptide therapeutics.

We suggest that bifunctional chimeric peptides represent a new generation of natriuretic peptide therapeutics. The human natriuretic peptide system consists of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), 2The abbreviations used are: ANP, atrial natriuretic peptide; BNP, B-type natriuretic peptide; CNP, C-type natriuretic peptide; NPR, natriuretic peptide receptor; NPR-C, natriuretic peptide clearance receptor; DNP, Dendroaspis natriuretic peptide; GFR, glomerular filtration rate; hNPR, human NPR. B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP), and an N-terminally extended renal form of ANP called urodilatin (1.Potter L.R. Abbey-Hosch S. Dickey D.M. Endocr. Rev. 2006; 27: 47-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). ANP, BNP, and urodilatin bind natriuretic peptide receptor (NPR)-A, whereas CNP binds NPR-B. Both receptors are transmembrane guanylyl cyclases, which when activated catalyze the synthesis of cGMP. The natriuretic peptide clearance receptor (NPR-C) lacks guanylyl cyclase activity and functions primarily to clear natriuretic peptides from the circulation. However, a signaling function has been proposed for this receptor as well (2.Rose R.A. Giles W.R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2008; 586: 353-366Crossref Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Both ANP and BNP reduce blood pressure by increasing natriuresis, diuresis, vasodilation, and endothelial permeability. They also prevent cardiac hypertrophy and suppress the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone systems. In 2001, BNP was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of acutely decompensated heart failure. However, recent reports have suggested impaired renal function, which may be related to excessive hypotension (3.Sackner-Bernstein J.D. Skopicki H.A. Aaronson K.D. Circulation. 2005; 111: 1487-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar, 4.Sackner-Bernstein J.D. Kowalski M. Fox M. Aaronson K. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 2005; 293: 1900-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). CD-NP represents a new class of natriuretic peptide drug that may circumvent the hypotensive nature of BNP and preserve or augment renal function in the congestive heart failure setting. CD-NP contains the full-length 22-amino acid human CNP fused to the 15-amino acid C-terminal tail of Dendroaspis natriuretic peptide (DNP), an endogenous vasoactive peptide found in the venom of the green mamba. The benefits of CNP are that it is venodilatory; less hypotensive than ANP and BNP; and unlike ANP and BNP, remains active in the failing heart (5.Dickey D.M. Flora D.R. Bryan P.M. Xu X. Chen Y. Potter L.R. Endocrinology. 2007; 148: 3518-3522Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). However, CNP lacks the diuretic and natriuretic actions of ANP and BNP, which are critical for the improvement of patients with congestive heart failure. Because DNP possesses both natriuretic and hypotensive activities (6.Lisy O. Lainchbury J.G. Leskinen H. Burnett Jr., J.C. Hypertension. 2001; 37: 1089-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), CD-NP was engineered to combine the unique venodilatory and cardiac properties of CNP with the beneficial renal properties of DNP. In vivo application of CD-NP is promising because infusion of CD-NP into dogs increases natriuresis and diuresis while being less hypotensive than BNP. Furthermore, CD-NP increases the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) more than BNP (7.Lisy O. Huntley B.K. McCormick D.J. Kurlansky P.A. Burnett Jr., J.C. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 2008; 52: 60-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Although CD-NP infusion significantly increases cGMP concentrations in plasma, urine, and cultured fibroblasts, the ability of CD-NP to bind and activate each NPR was not determined. Here, we describe the molecular basis for the unique properties of CD-NP. In addition, we created two new variants of CD-NP that are even more potent activators of NPR-A. Surprisingly, the mutation of two amino acids in the ring of CNP transformed CD-NP into a superagonist of NPR-A. To our knowledge, this is the first description of peptides that are capable of activating both NPR-A and NPR-B at less than micromolar concentrations. Peptides and Reagents—Human ANP and CNP were purchased from Sigma. Human BNP, DNP, B-CDNP, and CDNP-B were synthesized by Phoenix Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Burlingame, CA). CD-NP was manufactured by Clinalfa (Weil am Rhein, Germany). The lyophilized peptides were reconstituted in deionized water, aliquoted, and stored at -80 °C until used. cGMP radioimmunoassay kits were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Cells—Human embryonic kidney 293 cells stably expressing rat or human NPR-A or NPR-B were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 200 μg/ml G418 or hygromycin B. Whole Cell cGMP Elevation Assays—Cells were plated in 48-well plates. The day of the assay, the cells were incubated in serum-free medium for 4 h. The cells were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) and 1 mm 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine. This medium was then replaced with the same medium containing various concentrations of natriuretic peptides. The cells were stimulated for 1 or 3 min, and then the assay was terminated by aspirating the medium and adding 200 μl of ice-cold 80% ethanol. cGMP concentrations were estimated by radioimmunoassay as described previously (8.Abbey S.E. Potter L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42423-42430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Membrane Guanylyl Cyclase Assays—Crude membranes were prepared and assayed as described previously (9.Bryan P.M. Xu X. Dickey D.M. Chen Y. Potter L.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2007; 292: F1636-F1644Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells from a 10-cm tissue culture plate were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then scraped in cold buffer containing phosphatase inhibitors. The cells were lysed by sonicating 1 to 2 s and membranes were precipitated by centrifugation. The crude membranes were resuspended in phosphatase inhibitor buffer. 20 μl of membranes containing 1 mm MgGTP were assayed for 3 min at 37 °C in the presence or absence of various concentrations of natriuretic peptide. The assayed were stopped with the addition of 400 μl of cold 50 mm sodium acetate buffer containing 5 mm EDTA and placed on ice. cGMP concentrations were determined on a fraction of the resulting solution by radioimmunoassay. Whole Cell Binding Assays—Cells were plated on 24-well plates precoated with polylysine. When the cells were 75–90% confluent, the growth medium was replaced with 0.2% bovine serum albumin in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Cells were incubated for 1–2 h in this medium at 37 °C. Binding medium containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 125I-ANP was prepared on ice. Binding media containing increasing concentrations of unlabeled ligand were added to the cells and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. The cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline to remove nonspecifically bound tracer. 0.5 ml of 1 n NaOH was added to each well and incubated at room temperature to solubilize the cells. Radioactivity was determined in a Beckman 5500 γ-counter. Statistics—Each experiment was performed in triplicate in three separate assays. The data were graphed with Prism software and are presented as the average of all assays combined or as a representative experiment with error bars representing the S.E. of the individual experiment. Our goal is to develop natriuretic peptide variants that are unique co-activators of NPR-B and NPR-A and therefore may have therapeutic advantage beyond native natriuretic peptides that are specific for NPR-B (CNP) or NPR-A (ANP and BNP) for the treatment of cardiorenal disease syndromes such as heart failure. As such, new peptides should reduce cardiac load, decrease cardiac remodeling, and most importantly, enhance renal function. Recently, CD-NP was shown to be a more effective stimulator of GFR, natriuresis, and diuresis than BNP (sequence in Fig. 1) (7.Lisy O. Huntley B.K. McCormick D.J. Kurlansky P.A. Burnett Jr., J.C. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 2008; 52: 60-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). However, the pharmacological basis for how CD-NP achieves this result has not been described. There are several possible explanations for why CD-NP elicits a greater GFR-enhancing effect than BNP. CD-NP could have a greater half-life than BNP, it could activate both NPR-A and NPR-B, or it could increase local concentrations of endogenous natriuretic peptides by binding more tightly to NPR-C, thereby reducing receptor-mediated degradation. These pharmacological questions related to the NPRs are addressed here. Activation of Human NPR-A—To unequivocally determine the ability of various ligands to activate human NPR (hNPR)-A or hNPR-B, we stably expressed each individual receptor in human embryonic kidney 293 cells devoid of endogenous NPRs. Using these cells, we could be confident that any increase in natriuretic peptide-dependent cGMP concentrations results from the activation of the single stably expressed receptor. We first tested the ability of CD-NP to activate hNPR-A compared with the original parent peptides, CNP and DNP. We found that addition of the C-terminal portion of DNP to CNP resulted in a peptide that was a dramatically more potent activator of hNPR-A than CNP (Fig. 2A). Although extremely high concentrations of CNP (10 μm) yielded just detectable increases in cellular cGMP concentrations, CD-NP produced equivalent responses at concentrations that were >2 orders of magnitude lower. The calculated EC50 for CD-NP was 723 nm. Surprisingly, saturating concentrations of CD-NP produced significantly less cGMP elevations than saturating amounts of ANP, indicating that CD-NP is a partial agonist of hNPR-A. Because infusion of the linear C-terminal portion of DNP significantly increased urinary cGMP excretion in dogs, we tested whether this same fragment could elevate cGMP levels in NPR-A-expressing cells. We found that this peptide at 10 μm did not elevate cGMP concentrations in cells expressing hNPR-A, consistent with a previous study showing that an intact ring structure is required for NPR-A activation (10.Misono K.S. Grammer R.T. Fukumi H. Inagami T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 123: 444-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Activation of hNPR-B—Similar experiments were conducted on 293 cells stably expressing hNPR-B. In these cells, CD-NP was ∼5-fold less potent than the natural ligand for NPR-B, CNP. The EC50 for CD-NP was 202 nm compared with 38 nm for CNP (Fig. 2B). Hence, compared with CNP, CD-NP is a >200-fold better agonist for NPR-A but a 5-fold worse agonist for NPR-B. Interestingly, the activity of CD-NP on NPR-B was much higher than the other NPR-A-specific ligands, ANP and DNP, which contain residues C-terminal to the ring structure. As with hNPR-A, the linear C-terminal portion of DNP (C-terminal tail) was unable to stimulate hNPR-B (Fig. 2B). Effect of CD-NP on Guanylyl Cyclase Activity—To determine whether the cGMP elevations observed in whole cells were due to direct activation of the receptor by CD-NP, guanylyl cyclase assays were performed. Crude membranes prepared from 293 cells expressing hNPR-A or hNPR-B were incubated with 1 mm GTP and 5 mm MgCl2 in the presence or absence of various concentrations of natriuretic peptide, and the amount of cGMP formed over a 3-min period was determined (Fig. 3). Similar to the whole cell assays, CD-NP was a dramatically more potent activator of hNPR-A than CNP (Fig. 3A). In contrast, the addition of the DNP tail only slightly reduced the ability of CNP to activate hNPR-B (Fig. 3B). Competition Binding of CD-NP in hNPR-A-expressing Cells—To determine whether the elevated sensitivity of hNPR-A to CD-NP was due to an increase in receptor binding affinity, competition 125I-ANP binding experiments were performed on whole hNPR-A-expressing 293 cells. CD-NP was not a particularly efficient competitor for binding to hNPR-A because ∼1000-fold more CD-NP than ANP was required to compete for 125I-ANP (Fig. 4A). However, much more striking was the complete inability of CNP or the C-terminal portion of DNP to compete for 125I-ANP binding to hNPR-A even at 10 μm concentrations. Hence, the addition of the C-terminal tail of DNP to the C terminus of CNP dramatically increases its affinity for hNPR-A, consistent with the idea that CD-NP, but not CNP, is a NPR-A agonist. Similar experiments were attempted using [125I-Tyr0]CNP binding to hNPR-B. Unfortunately, the purchased tracer lacked the specificity necessary for accurate interpretation of the experiments. Competition Binding of CD-NP in hNPR-C-expressing Cells—The above studies indicate that CD-NP directly binds and activates hNPR-A. However, that does not mean that the renal and hemodynamic effects of CD-NP result solely from the direct activation of hNPR-A. Another possible explanation is that infusion of CD-NP prolongs the half-life of endogenous ANP and/or BNP by competing for its degradation by the clearance receptor. To address this possibility, we measured the ability of CD-NP, ANP, and CNP to compete for 125I-ANP binding to the clearance receptor (Fig. 4B). In contrast to the dramatic effect that the DNP tail had on the ability of CNP to bind NPR-A, it had little if any effect on binding to NPR-C because similar concentrations of all three peptides were required to block binding of 125I-ANP to this receptor. Thus, the addition of the C-terminal portion of DNP to CNP increases affinity for NPR-A but not NPR-C. A previous report using 125I-DNP binding assays suggested that DNP does not bind NPR-C (11.Singh G. Kuc R.E. Maguire J.J. Fidock M. Davenport A.P. Circ. Res. 2006; 99: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), whereas another group using 125I-ANP competition binding assays concluded that DNP does bind NPR-C (12.Johns D.G. Ao Z. Heidrich B.J. Hunsberger G.E. Graham T. Payne L. Elshourbagy N. Lu Q. Aiyar N. Douglas S.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 358: 145-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To clarify this issue, we tested the ability of DNP to displace 125I-ANP binding to NPR-C compared with ANP, BNP, and CNP. As shown in Fig. 4C, DNP bound 3–5-fold less avidly than CNP and 20–25-fold less avidly than ANP and BNP to the clearance receptor. Hence, our data resolve the debate in the literature concerning the ability of DNP to bind NPR-A versus NPR-C; it clearly does bind NPR-C, but it binds NPR-C less tightly than it binds NPR-A. Activation of Rat Receptor Isoforms by CD-NP—The ability of CD-NP to activate the rat versions of NPR-A and NPR-B was also determined. Here, we made two surprising observations. First, unlike the human scenario, in which high concentrations of CNP had very little effect on hNPR-A (Fig. 5A), high concentrations of CNP were able to maximally activate rat NPR-A (Fig. 5B). Second, whereas CD-NP was a partial agonist of hNPR-A, it was a full agonist of rat NPR-A (Fig. 5B). In contrast, CD-NP had similar effects on rat and human NPR-B (data not shown). Hence, the addition of the C-terminal tail of DNP to CNP has a greater effect on hNPR-A because this receptor is essentially unresponsive to CNP even at pharmacological concentrations. Effect of Amino Acid Substitutions within the CD-NP Ring—We next tested whether substitutions within the cysteine ring would lead to further increases in the EC50 for hNPR-A activation. Alignment of ANP, BNP, and CNP shows four sections of amino acid divergence: the N terminus, a three-amino acid segment just inside the first cysteine residue of the ring, a second three-amino acid intra-ring sequence closer to the C-terminal cysteine, and the C-terminal tail (Fig. 1). The divergence of the C-terminal portions of the natriuretic peptides is addressed with the dramatic change in the pharmacological profile of CNP upon addition of the C-terminal portion of DNP. Previous studies tested the effect of adding the C-terminal tail of ANP (vasonatrin) or BNP to CNP; therefore, we will not address this region of the peptides further. Instead, we focused on modifications of the amino acids in the ring structure of CD-NP to further enhance its potency and/or affinity for hNPR-A. We substituted the corresponding sequence for BNP into the positions described above and measured the effect of the modifications on the resultant peptides' abilities to activate the hNPRs. The mutations were based on BNP, not ANP, because BNP and NPR-A coevolved (13.Schoenfeld J.R. Sehl P. Quan C. Burnier J.P. Lowe D.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 172-180PubMed Google Scholar). We used the same assays to determine the ability of the new chimeric peptides to activate hNPR-A and hNPR-B as we did to characterize CD-NP. However, in these studies, we used BNP rather than ANP as the representative NPR-A agonist because the sequence modifications for the new peptides were derived from BNP. ANP and BNP have similar abilities to activate NPR-A, although human ANP is typically a slightly better activator than BNP (EC50 = 10.8 nm for ANP in Fig. 2 versus EC50 = 28.4 nm for BNP in Fig. 6A). As shown in Fig. 6A, the mutation of the first set of amino acids to comparable residues within BNP resulted in a dramatic leftward shift in the concentration of the peptide required to yield maximal cGMP elevations in NPR-A-expressing cells. This peptide, called B-CDNP, was slightly more potent than human BNP, and unlike CD-NP, it was a full agonist. Mutation of the second set of amino acids within the ring structure of CNP to yield CDNP-B also resulted in a peptide with increased full agonist potency over CD-NP, although the effect was much less dramatic. Notably, both variants retained significant potency for NPR-B (Fig. 6B) because their EC50 values for NPR-B were <1 μm, although the reduction in potency was greater than that observed for CD-NP. Finally, competitive binding studies were conducted to determine whether the change in potency of the CD-NP analogs versus CD-NP was due to increased affinity of the peptides for the extracellular domain of NPR-A. The binding profile shown in Fig. 7A is strikingly correlated with the whole cell receptor activation profile shown in Fig. 6A. Hence, the increased potency of the CD-NP analogs for NPR-A results from increased affinity for the receptor. Finally, the ring mutations are specific for NPR-A because they had minimal or no effect on binding to NPR-C (Fig. 7B). The addition of the C-terminal tail of DNP to CNP, which is normally not natriuretic, resulted in a peptide (CD-NP) that is substantially natriuretic, diuretic, and GFR-enhancing while being less hypotensive than BNP (7.Lisy O. Huntley B.K. McCormick D.J. Kurlansky P.A. Burnett Jr., J.C. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 2008; 52: 60-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The retention of renal activities by the chimeric peptide is particularly important for therapeutic benefit. Synthetic BNP (nesiritide) is currently approved for the treatment of acutely decompensated heart failure. However, infusion of nesiritide can cause dramatic decreases in blood pressure in some patients, which reduces renal perfusion pressure and ultimately may reduce GFR (3.Sackner-Bernstein J.D. Skopicki H.A. Aaronson K.D. Circulation. 2005; 111: 1487-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). Therefore, the ability of CD-NP to retain these activities without eliciting extensive hypotension may be extremely beneficial in the clinical setting. Determining the molecular mechanism of action of CD-NP was the goal of this study, with specific focus on hNPRs. Our experiments unequivocally determined that CD-NP is a direct activator of both hNPR-A (Fig. 2A) and hNPR-B (Fig. 2B). This is in direct contrast to CNP, which essentially has no ability to activate the human form of NPR-A at concentrations up to 10 μm (Fig. 2A). The potency of CD-NP compared with ANP and BNP is reduced by ∼60-fold, but at pharmacological concentrations, it would still likely activate the receptor. The mutation of amino acids in the ring portion of the peptide to corresponding residues in BNP resulted in a chimeric peptide, B-CDNP, which activated hNPR-A with a potency similar to human BNP (Fig. 6A) and still maintained some ability to activate NPR-B, although higher concentrations were required to achieve similar levels of activation (Fig. 6B). Thus, determining which residues within these derivative chimeric peptides mediate selective binding to NPR-A and NPR-B will be the focus of future studies. The reduced potency of CD-NP for NPR-A could explain the less hypotensive effects observed upon infusion of CD-NP in dogs (7.Lisy O. Huntley B.K. McCormick D.J. Kurlansky P.A. Burnett Jr., J.C. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 2008; 52: 60-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and could be an important distinction for its therapeutic use over ANP (carperitide) and BNP (nesiritide). This characteristic may make CD-NP more beneficial than its derivatives, B-CDNP and CDNP-B, in normotensive patients, but the latter peptides may be therapeutically useful to hypertensive patients. Additionally, several reports suggest that NPR-B is involved in preventing cardiac hypertrophy in heart failure (14.Langenickel T.H. Buttgereit J. Pagel-Langenickel I. Lindner M. Monti J. Beuerlein K. Al-Saadi N. Plehm R. Popova E. Tank J. Dietz R. Willenbrock R. Bader M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 4735-4740Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 15.Soeki T. Kishimoto I. Okumura H. Tokudome T. Horio T. Mori K. Kangawa K. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 2005; 45: 608-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The ability of CD-NP to activate both hNPR-A and hNPR-B may prove doubly beneficial in regards to inhibiting cardiac remodeling in heart failure patients. Activation of NPR-A should induce natriuresis, diuresis, and arterial vasodilation to reduce blood pressure and load on the heart, and activation of NPR-B should unload the heart by stimulating venodilation (16.Wei C.M. Aarhus L.L. Miller V.M. Burnett Jr., J.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: H71-H73Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as well as by acting directly on the heart to decrease hypertrophy and fibrosis. Although our activation studies showed that CD-NP directly activates hNPR-A, they did not rule out additional causes for the physiological effects of CD-NP infusion in whole animal studies. The increase in cGMP could be explained by direct activation of NPR-A or by an increased half-life of ANP or BNP due to competition with CD-NP for degradation. Natriuretic peptides are removed from the circulation by NPR-C-mediated internalization and degradation as well as by neutral endopeptidase 24.11-dependent and possibly other protease-dependent degradation. We determined that CD-NP binds the clearance receptor with similar affinity to ANP and CNP (Fig. 4B); thus, CD-NP competes for degradation by NPR-C but not any better than CNP. Previous reports suggest that DNP is resistant to degradation by neutral endopeptidase (17.Chen H.H. Lainchbury J.G. Burnett Jr., J.C. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 2002; 40: 1186-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar); therefore, addition of the C-terminal tail of DNP to CNP may render the peptide less susceptible to neutral endopeptidase degradation and increase its half-life. However, we did not make any direct measurements of the ability of CD-NP to be degraded by neutral endopeptidase. To be most effective clinically, CD-NP should have a long half-life; thus, this topic warrants future investigation. Similar strategies for producing chimeric natriuretic peptides have been attempted previously. In 1993, Wei et al. (18.Wei C.M. Kim C.H. Miller V.M. Burnett Jr., J.C. J. Clin. Investig. 1993; 92: 2048-2052Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) described the development of vasonatrin peptide. This chimeric peptide contains the five-amino acid C-terminal tail of ANP appended to full-length CNP. Vasonatrin induces natriuresis similarly to ANP and is more potent than CNP in inducing venodilation. One might speculate that the strong venodilation combined with a potent arterial vasodilation response may produce hypotension similar to that observed with infusion of ANP or BNP. Therefore, vasonatrin would have little advantage over infusion of synthetic ANP or BNP in heart failure patients. Conversely, by being a less potent activator of NPR-A, CD-NP may eliminate or reduce some of the side effects of NPR-A agonists but still be potent enough to produce the beneficial renal actions reported with DNP. The species difference in CD-NP activation of NPR-A (Fig. 5) is similar to that reported by Cunningham et al. (19.Cunningham B.C. Lowe D.G. Li B. Bennett B.D. Wells J.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2508-2515Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) in their attempt to identify NPR-A-specific analogs and emphasizes the importance of using the correct model system when evaluating compounds for therapeutic potential. NPR-A is 91% identical in rat and human. Thus, the full agonist versus partial agonist responses to CD-NP shown in Fig. 5, B versus A, are clearly a function of the subtle differences between the human and rat receptors because CNP is identical in rats, mice, dogs, and humans. The structures of all three human natriuretic peptides (ANP, BNP, and CNP) are very similar (Fig. 1) (10.Misono K.S. Grammer R.T. Fukumi H. Inagami T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 123: 444-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). CNP differs from the other peptides in that it lacks a C-terminal tail. Although the ring structure appears to be most critical for activity, numerous reports have determined that deletion of amino acids C-terminal to the ring reduces the potency of ANP (20.Scarborough R.M.

(22.Ogawa H. Qiu Y. Ogata C.M. Misono K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28625-28631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) using the extracellular domain of rat NPR-A bound to an ANP peptide identified some of the amino acids important for binding ANP and suggest that the C-terminal tail portion of ANP is especially important for stabilization of binding. Hence, it is likely that the C-terminal amino acids from DNP form critical interactions with residues found in the extracellular domain of human but not rat NPR-A. Whether this species difference also applies to the dog receptor used as the model for the in vivo studies on CD-NP is not known. Sequence comparison of the extracellular ligand-binding domains of dog and rat NPR-A indicates that this region is 88 and 85% identical to the human receptor, respectively. Unfortunately, the critical interactions between hNPR-A and CD-NP are not known, so we cannot determine whether the important contacts are conserved in the dog receptor at this time. Comparison of the amino acids from the structure study of rat NPR-A by Ogawa et al. (22.Ogawa H. Qiu Y. Ogata C.M. Misono K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28625-28631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) indicates no significant amino acid difference between human, rat, and dog NPR-A. We are currently cloning the dog NPRs to directly compare the sensitivity of these receptors to the human receptors. Interestingly, although our data explain the mechanism behind the physiological response following in vivo administration of CD-NP, we could not explain the response seen following infusion of the linear C-terminal portion of DNP. This C-terminal fragment was unable to induce a cGMP response in either NPR-A- or NPR-B-expressing cells at concentrations up to 10 μm. We also did not measure any appreciable binding of the peptide to NPR-A or NPR-C. Thus, we speculate that the linear peptide blocks degradation and inactivation of the endogenous peptides by neutral endopeptidase or other proteases, but this remains to be determined. In summary, CD-NP is a novel natriuretic peptide that represents a potential new drug for the treatment of heart failure and other cardiorenal disease syndromes. The unique property of this chimeric peptide is that it activates both hNPR-A and hNPR-B. Additional changes in the amino acids located in the ring structure make the peptide a more potent NPR-A agonist. The availability of the three CD-NP peptides described here to distinguish between the benefits of a full NPR-A agonist versus a partial agonist in concert with the ability of these peptides to activate NPR-B may maximize the therapeutic potential of the NPRs and result in the development of a new group of drugs whose individual use could be selected for based on optimum treatment of the symptoms of patients with congestive heart failure with and without hypertension."

Drp1 is recruited from the cytosol to the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) by a multiprotein complex that includes Fis1.

Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a major, evolutionarily conserved family of Ser/Thr phosphatases with many essential functions in the cell (16Janssens V. Goris J. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 417-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1549) Google Scholar). The predominant form of PP2A is a heterotrimer of a catalytic C and scaffolding A and a variable regulatory or B subunit. Regulatory subunits define substrate specificity and subcellular localization of the PP2A holoenzyme and are often expressed in a tissue- and cell type-specific pattern. As one of the 12 mammalian PP2A regulatory subunit genes, Bβ (PPP2R2B) gives rise to several neuron-specific splice variants (17Schmidt K. Kins S. Schild A. Nitsch R. Hemmings B. Götz J. Eur. J.

Indicating a role for PP2A/Bβ in neuronal survival, a CAG repeat expansion in a non-coding region of PPP2R2B was shown to be responsible for spinocerebellar ataxia type 12, SCA12 (19Holmes S.E.

SCA12 is a relatively rare, late-onset neurodegenerative disorder characterized by diffuse cerebral and cerebellar atrophy (20Holmes S.E. O'Hearn E. Cortez-Apreza N. Hwang H.S. Ross C.A. Strack S.

It is not known whether and how the CAG repeat expansion affects expression of the different Bβ splice variants in humans, and animal models of SCA12 have yet to be established. We previously reported that the differentially spliced N terminus of Bβ2 recruits PP2A to the OMM by a transient and reversible interaction with receptor subunits of the translocase of the outer membrane (TOM) complex. Furthermore, overexpression of Bβ2 was shown to promote apoptosis in growth factor-deprived neuronal PC12 cells (18Dagda R.K. Zaucha J.A. Wadzinski B.E. Strack S. J. Biol.

Here, we demonstrate that Bβ2 redistributes from the cytosol to mitochondria in dying PC12 cells and hippocampal neurons and that apoptosis induction by Bβ2 requires recruitment of the PP2A holoenzyme to the OMM. RNA interference-mediated knockdown of Bβ2 in hippocampal cultures protects neurons from excitotoxic, ischemic, and metabolic insults. Multiple lines of gain- and loss-of-function evidence indicate that PP2A/Bβ2 antagonizes survival by driving Drp1- and Fis1-dependent mitochondrial fragmentation. The survival and morphogenetic activities of PP2A/Bβ2 can be dissociated by Bcl2 overexpression, indicating that mitochondrial restructuring occurs upstream of apoptosis. Our results identify an outer mitochondrial PP2A holoenzyme as a critical regulator of the mitochondrial morphogenetic equilibrium, which determines the susceptibility of neurons to diverse injuries. cDNA and shRNA Vectors—Wild-type and mutant Bβ1 and Bβ2-GFP expression vectors were described previously (18Dagda R.K.

Bβ2 and Fis1 were silenced by H1 promoter-driven expression of small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) (pSUPER plasmid (23Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R.

The nonspecific control shRNA had a similar base composition but was randomized for no more than 14 consecutive matches to any mammalian mRNA. Antibodies—A mouse monoclonal antibody directed against Bβ2 was generated at the University of Iowa Hybridoma Facility, using the N-terminal peptide KCFSRYLPYIFRPPNTILSS coupled to maleimide-activated keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Pierce) as an antigen. This antibody specifically recognized ectopically expressed Bβ2, but not Bβ1, by immunoblotting. As further confirmation of specificity, immunohistochemical labeling of brain sections with the Bβ2 antibody was nearly abolished in homozygous Bβ2 knock-out mice. 6R. A. Merrill, X. Zhou, and S. Strack, unpublished data. Other antibodies were obtained commercially: sheep anti-cytochrome c (Sigma), rabbit anti-GFP (AbCam), mouse anti-neurofilament (2H3, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa), and rabbit anti-β-galactosidase (Invitrogen). Immunofluorescence Staining and Quantification—Hippocampal neurons from E18 rat embryos (25Lim I.A. Merrill M.A. Chen Y. Hell J.W. Neuropharmacology. 2003; 45: 738-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) were cultured in Neurobasal medium with B27 supplement (Invitrogen). At 18–21 days in vitro, cultures were challenged as indicated, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde after 2 h, and processed for Bβ2 and cytochrome c immunofluorescence. The cytochrome c antibody was visualized by a Alexa Fluor 488-coupled secondary antibody (Invitrogen), whereas Bβ2 was detected with the Cy3 tyramide signal amplification kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Digital images of randomly selected neurons were captured at constant camera settings using the 40× objective of a Leica epifluorescence microscope. Clustering of Bβ2 in dendrites was quantified by image analysis using a macro custom-written for the ImageJ program (National Institutes of Health). To this end, images were background-subtracted using the rolling ball algorithm, and an autosegmentation mask was applied outlining regions of above threshold pixel intensity in the dendritic field. Average Bβ2 immunofluorescence (8-bit pixel intensity) in outlined dendritic clusters was compiled for 50–100 neurons per condition. For confocal microscopy of endogenous Bβ2 in the soma of hippocampal neurons, cultures were infected with lentivirus expressing mitochondria-targeted GFP (matrix import sequence from cytochrome oxidase subunit VIII) and challenged 5 days later with 2.5 μm rotenone or DMSO vehicle. After 2 h, cultures were paraformaldehyde-fixed, subjected to antigen retrieval (10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 9.0, for 30 min at 80 °C), and then immunofluorescently labeled for Bβ2 and GFP as described above. Confocal image stacks (3-μm interval) were acquired with an Olympus FluoView 3000 microscope, and colocalization of Bβ2 with mitochondria was assessed by blinded comparison with a set of reference images. Neuronal Survival Assays—Hippocampal cultures (25Lim I.A. Merrill M.A. Chen Y. Hell J.W. Neuropharmacology. 2003; 45: 738-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) were transduced with lentivirus or transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (0.15%, 2 μg/ml DNA) at 10–21 days in vitro. For survival assays based on counting transfected neurons or apoptotic nuclei, GFP- or β-galactosidase-expressing plasmids were cotransfected. For oxygen-glucose deprivation assays, a plasmid expressing luciferase driven by the neuron-specific calcitonin gene-related peptide promoter was included (20% of total plasmid mass). After 3–5 days, cultures were challenged with glutamate (250 μm, 20 min), rotenone (400 nm continuous), or oxygen-glucose deprivation (25 min). Glutamate- and rotenone-treated cultures (and their vehicle controls) were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde and processed for immunofluorescence staining for the transfection marker (GFP, β-galactosidase) and neurofilament protein as a neuronal marker. To score survival, transfection marker-positive neurons with intact processes were counted in quadruplicate wells of a 24-well plate. Apoptosis was quantified as the percentage of transfected neurons with condensed, irregular, or fragmented nuclei (labeled with 1 μg/ml Hoechst 33342). All survival assays based on counting neurons were performed blind to the experimental conditions. For oxygen-glucose deprivation assays, medium was exchanged with custom Neurobasal medium without glucose (formula 05-0128DJ, Invitrogen), and cultures were placed for 25 min in a Billups-Rothenberg (Del Mar, CA) modular incubator chamber, which was flushed with 95% N2 and 5% CO2. After adding back glucose-containing Neurobasal medium, cultures were returned to the standard incubator. Control cultures were mock-treated under normoglycemic/normoxic conditions. 72 h later, neuronal survival was determined by luciferase assays. Mitochondrial Morphology Assay—PC12 cells and hippocampal neurons cultured on, respectively, collagen- and poly-d-lysine-coated, chambered Number 1 cover glasses (20-mm2 chamber, Nalge Nunc), were infected with lentivirus or transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 as above. 24–96 h after transfection, cells were incubated with 100 nm tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM, Invitrogen) for 30 min at 37 °C to visualize mitochondria, and live cell images through the midplane of the soma were captured using a Zeiss LSM 510 laser-scanning confocal microscope. Mitochondrial morphology was scored by a reference image-based method. Coded confocal images were assigned scores from 0 to 4 by comparison with a set of reference images with increasing degrees of mitochondrial elongation. Non-transfected or non-transduced cells were analyzed in some experiments, yielding mitochondrial morphology scores that were statistically indistinguishable from cells expressing control shRNA or control proteins (e.g. outer mitochondrial GFP). Statistical Analysis—Data were analyzed by Student's t test (two-tailed) for single comparisons, and by one-way analysis of variance followed by pairwise Bonferroni post hoc tests for multiple comparisons. PP2A/Bβ2 Translocates to Mitochondria to Promote Neuronal Death—We investigated a possible redistribution of Bβ2-GFP in healthy versus stressed PC12 cells. Under basal conditions, Bβ2 localized to both cytosolic and mitochondrial compartments (the latter visualized by MitoTracker or TMRM) as reported previously (18Dagda R.K. Zaucha J.A. Wadzinski B.E. Strack S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24976-24985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In contrast, Bβ1-GFP localization was exclusively cytosolic, excluding areas of high mitochondrial density (18Dagda R.K. Zaucha J.A. Wadzinski B.E. Strack S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24976-24985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). When cells were incubated with the glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin (1.4μm), which induces apoptosis through the endoplasmic reticulum stress pathway, Bβ2 assumed an exclusively mitochondrial localization (Fig. 1A). Tunicamycin-dependent mitochondrial redistribution of Bβ2 was quantified at 24- and 48-h time points (Fig. 1B). Rotenone is a pesticide that blocks complex I of the electron transport chain and that has been used as a chemical model of Parkinson disease (26Betarbet R. Sherer T.B. MacKenzie G. Garcia-Osuna M. Panov A.V. Greenamyre J.T. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 1301-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (2984) Google Scholar). Similar to tunicamycin, rotenone (10 μm) induced a quantitative translocation of Bβ2 from the cytosolic to the mitochondrial compartment, which correlated in time and on a cell-by-cell basis with nuclear condensation and fragmentation, hallmarks of apoptosis (Fig. 1C). We extended these results to primary hippocampal neurons transduced with lentivirus expressing Bβ1- or Bβ2-GFP. As in PC12 cells, Bβ1-GFP was excluded from mitochondria (labeled with the potential-sensitive dye TMRM). Confocal imaging of Bβ2-GFP-expressing neurons revealed a modest degree of colocalization with mitochondria (Fig. 1D). Treatment of hippocampal cultures with 2 μm rotenone resulted in a rapid relocalization of Bβ2, but not Bβ1, from the cytosolic to the mitochondrial compartment (Fig. 1D). As in PC12 cells, mitochondrial translocation of Bβ2 was tightly correlated with the appearance of apoptotic nuclei and occurred concomitantly (Fig. 1E). We also observed increased association of Bβ2-GFP with mitochondria of PC12 cells following growth factor deprivation (data not shown). To investigate the localization of endogenous Bβ2, a monoclonal antibody was generated against a unique N-terminal sequence. This antibody is specific for Bβ2 as it labels various neuronal populations in brain sections of wild-type, but not homozygous Bβ2 null mice.6 Hippocampal cultures were challenged with glutamate (200 μm, 15 min), rotenone (2.5 μm, 2 h), or the classical apoptosis inducer staurosporine (0.5 μm, 2 h), fixed after 2 h, and immunofluorescently labeled for endogenous Bβ2 and mitochondrial markers. We used epifluorescence microcopy and computer-aided image analysis to quantify Bβ2 translocation to cytochrome c-positive areas in dendrites and detected significant increases with all insults (Fig. 2, A and C). To assess stress-induced association of Bβ2 with mitochondria in the soma of hippocampal neurons, cultures infected with lentivirus expressing mitochondrial matrix-targeted GFP were subjected to a 2-h DMSO or rotenone treatment, immunolabeled for Bβ2, and analyzed by confocal microscopy. Paralleling the behavior of GFP-tagged Bβ2 (Fig. 1, D and E), rotenone-induced mitochondrial swelling and fragmentation was accompanied by a transition of endogenous Bβ2 from a cytosolic to a largely mitochondrial staining pattern (Fig. 2, B and D). These data indicate that mitochondrial redistribution of this neuron-specific PP2A regulatory subunit may be a general consequence of neuronal injury. Mitochondrial Targeting of the PP2A Holoenzyme by Bβ2 Is Neurotoxic—When compared with non-transduced neurons in the same culture, Bβ2-GFP-overexpressing hippocampal neurons displayed increased vulnerability to rotenone (Fig. 1E). Therefore, translocation of Bβ2 to mitochondria appears to be a positive feedback mechanism that accelerates neuronal death. In support of this conclusion, long term (≥5 days) expression of Bβ2-, but not Bβ1-GFP, in hippocampal neurons resulted in massive apoptosis (Fig. 3A). We previously identified critical salt bridge interactions between Arg-168/Arg-169 of Bβ2 and Glu-100/Glu-101 of the scaffolding A subunit and characterized in detail the determinants for outer mitochondrial localization of Bβ2 (18Dagda R.K.

Chem. 2002; 277: 20750-20755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In further overexpression experiments, we found that the proapoptotic activity of Bβ2 requires recruitment of the PP2A holoenzyme to the mitochondrial surface, because mutations that disrupt association with mitochondria (R6A) or with the scaffolding and catalytic subunit (RR168EE) blocked the ability of Bβ2 to kill hippocampal neurons (Fig. 3A). PP2A/Bβ2 Silencing Is Neuroprotective—We employed RNA interference to investigate whether endogenous Bβ2 is a negative regulator of neuronal survival. Two shRNAs targeting the splice-specific 5′-untranslated region and N-terminal coding sequence effectively silenced a Bβ2-luciferase fusion protein in hippocampal cultures and stably expressed Bβ2 in PC12 cells (supplemental Fig. 1). Bβ2 knockdown conferred robust neuroprotection in hippocampal cultures exposed to a brief excitotoxic glutamate treatment as determined by counting the number of transfected neurons with intact cell bodies and processes (Fig. 3, B and C). The representative images in Fig. 3B illustrate the enhanced glutamate resistance of Bβ2 shRNA-expressing neurons when compared with their untransfected neighbors. Secondly, in an in vitro model of ischemia (oxygen/glucose deprivation), Bβ2 knockdown attenuated hippocampal neuron loss, which in these experiments was measured by luciferase expression from a neuron-specific promoter (Fig. 3D). Lastly, Bβ2 silencing by two shRNAs increased the number of surviving neurons and decreased apoptosis following inhibition of mitochondrial electron transport with rotenone (Fig. 3, C and E). In aggregate, these results implicate the SCA12 disease-associated PP2A/Bβ2 regulatory subunit as a neuron-specific component of the cell death machinery. PP2A/Bβ2 Drives Mitochondrial Fission—Mitochondrial fragmentation is an early, obligatory step in the intrinsic, mitochondria-dependent apoptosis program (6Cheung E.C. McBride H.M. Slack R.S. Apoptosis. 2007; 12: 979-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 7Suen D.F. Norris K.L. Youle R.J. Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 1577-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar, 28Martinou J.C. Youle R.J. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 1291-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In hippocampal cultures stained with the mitochondrial voltage-sensitive dye TMRM, we observed that neurons expressing Bβ2-GFP showed more punctate mitochondria than Bβ1-expressing neurons (Fig. 4A). Similar results were obtained in dividing and differentiated PC12 cells, as well as in dissociated dorsal root ganglion neurons (supplemental Fig. Fig. 2, B–D). To quantify mitochondrial shape changes, coded confocal images through the midplane of the neuronal soma were compared with a set of reference images with increasing degrees of mitochondrial length and interconnectivity (supplemental Fig. 2A, score 0–4). Although expression of wild-type Bβ2 resulted in significant mitochondrial fragmentation, the monomeric Bβ2 mutant (RR168EE (18Dagda R.K. Zaucha J.A. Wadzinski B.E. Strack S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24976-24985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar)) had an apparent dominant-negative effect, elongating and often clustering mitochondria near the nucleus (Fig. 4, A and B). RNA interference-mediated silencing of endogenous Bβ2 with two different shRNAs resulted in robust mitochondrial elongation to an extent similar to dominant-negative inhibition of the PP2A-targeting subunit (Fig. 4, A and B). To support a role for PP2A activity in mitochondrial morphogenesis, we expressed Plasmodium falciparum aspartate-rich protein (PfARP) in hippocampal neurons. PfARP is a predominantly cytosolic member of the I2PP2A family of PP2A catalytic subunit inhibitors (22Dobson S. Kumar R. Bracchi-Ricard V. Freeman S. Al-Murrani S.W. Johnson C. Damuni Z. Chakrabarti D. Barik S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 126: 239-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Expression of an untargeted PfARP-GFP fusion protein had no effect on mitochondrial morphology. However, redirecting the PP2A inhibitor to mitochondria by fusing the OMM anchor sequence of the mitochondrial import receptor MAS70p to its N terminus generated longer mitochondria (Fig. 4B). These results suggest that OMM targeting of PP2A activity via the neuron-specific Bβ2 regulatory subunit promotes cell death by shifting the mitochondrial fission/fusion balance toward fission. Mitochondrial Remodeling Is Critical for Neuronal Survival Regulation—Mitochondrial fragmentation induced by Bβ2 expression generally preceded loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (TMRM staining) and the appearance of apoptotic nuclei. Our results are therefore consistent with a model in which death is epistatic to fission. As a first test, we showed that rotenone-induced apoptosis, but not mitochondrial fragmentation, can be prevented by expressing the anti-apoptotic Bcl2 protein in hippocampal neurons (Fig. 5). Transfection of the fission GTPase Drp1 exacerbated both basal and rotenone-induced apoptosis. In agreement with a previous report (13Barsoum M.J. Yuan H. Gerencser A.A. Liot G. Kushnareva Y. Graber S. Kovacs I. Lee W.D. Waggoner J. Cui J. White A.D. Bossy B. Martinou J.C. Youle R.J. Lipton S.A. Ellisman M.H. Perkins G.A. Bossy-Wetzel E. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 3900-3911Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar), expression of a dominant-negative Drp1 mutant (K38A) or shRNA-mediated silencing of the adaptor protein Fis1 (supplemental Fig. 1A), which recruits Drp1 to the OMM, not only prevented mitochondrial fragmentation but also apoptosis induced by rotenone (Fig. 5). Thus, Fis1/Drp1-mediated mitochondrial fission is necessary and sufficient for at least some forms of neuronal cell death. We next investigated the involvement of mitochondrial fission in neuronal apoptosis induced by expression of Bβ2. Bcl2 coexpression completely blocked cell death associated with recruiting PP2A to mitochondria but did not restore normal mitochondrial morphology (Fig. 6). Therefore, PP2A-mediated mitochondrial restructuring is upstream of and distinct from the disintegration of various organelles that accompanies cell death. To address whether mitochondrial morphogenetic events are required for the death-promoting activity PP2A/Bβ2, we expressed Bβ2 together with dominant-negative Drp1- or Fis1-directed shRNA. Interfering with Fis1 and Drp1 not only reinstated normal mitochondrial morphology (Fig. 6A) but also at least partially restored viability of hippocampal neurons challenged by Bβ2 overexpression (Fig. 6B). We have identified the SCA12 gene product Bβ2 as a neuron-specific, OMM-localized PP2A regulatory subunit that regulates neuronal survival through the mitochondrial fission/fusion balance. RNA interference-mediated silencing of PP2A/Bβ2 was shown to confer neuroprotection against excitotoxic, ischemic, and free radical-mediated injury. Because OMM targeting is necessary for the proapoptotic activity of Bβ2, agents that interfere with the injury-induced mitochondrial translocation of this neuron-specific PP2A regulatory subunit should also be neuroprotective. The CAG repeat expansion in SCA12 maps close to the transcript initiation site of the Bβ1 splice form (20Holmes S.E. O'Hearn E. Cortez-Apreza N. Hwang H.S. Ross C.A. Strack S. Margolis R.L. Wells R. Ashizawa T. Genetic Instabilities and Neurological Diseases. Academic Press, New York2006: 461-474Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar), which lacks the mitochondrial localization and proapoptotic activity of Bβ2. Because Bβ2-specific exons are located upstream of the Bβ1 transcript start site, the Bβ2 pre-mRNA necessarily includes the CAG repeat. Although as yet untested, it is conceivable that the repeat expansion increases Bβ2 mRNA levels, resulting in late-onset neurodegeneration. Ultimately, however, animal models are required to address whether a disturbance of the mitochondrial fission/fusion equilibrium is the primary cause of neuron loss in SCA12. Tilting the kinase/phosphatase balance toward dephosphorylation by recruiting PP2A to the OMM (via wild-type Bβ2 expression) resulted in smaller mitochondria and compromised neuronal viability, whereas silencing PP2A/Bβ2 had the opposite effect. Neuronal death induced by favoring outer mitochondrial dephosphorylations could be mitigated by expression of Bcl2, dominant-negative Drp1, and Fis1 knockdown. Importantly, Bcl2 did not prevent mitochondrial fragmentation, supporting a linear model in which PP2A-mediated mitochondrial remodeling is epistatic to apoptosis (Fig. 6C). In agreement with similar results from other laboratories (13Barsoum M.J. Yuan H. Gerencser A.A. Liot G. Kushnareva Y. Graber S. Kovacs I. Lee W.D. Waggoner J. Cui J. White A.D. Bossy B.

Liot G. Lipton S.A. Ellisman M. Perkins G.A. Bossy-Wetzel E. Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 462-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), we found that inhibition of Fis1 and Drp1 also potently attenuates neurotoxicity of the electron transport inhibitor rotenone. Although the contribution of mitochondrial shape changes to apoptosis in immortalized cell lines is currently a matter of controversy (30James D.I. Martinou J.C. Dev.

Cell. 2008; 31: 570-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), Fis1/Drp1-dependent mitochondrial fragmentation appears to be a critical checkpoint in the demise of primary neurons induced by either proapoptotic proteins or environmental toxins. The role of PP2A in programmed cell death is well established (3McBride H.M. Neuspiel M. Wasiak S. Curr.

We hypothesize that in healthy neurons, as yet to be identified kinases drive mitochondrial fusion and/or inhibit fission by phosphorylation of the enzymes involved. Upon cell stress (e.g. glutamate, rotenone, staurosporine), the PP2A/Bβ2 holoenzyme translocates from the cytosol to the OMM via an interaction of a cryptic mitochondrial import sequence in the alternatively spliced N terminus of Bβ2 and receptor components of the TOM import complex (21Dagda R.K. Barwacz C.A. Cribbs J.T. Strack S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27375-27382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Outer mitochondrial PP2A, perhaps in conjunction with kinase inactivation, proceeds to dephosphorylate mitochondria-shaping proteins, thus inhibiting fusion and/or stimulating fission activities. Excessive mitochondrial fragmentation could lead to cell death either by fostering the release of apoptogenic proteins from the mitochondrial intermembrane space or by altering mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and Ca2+ homeostasis (1Dimmer K.S. Scorrano L. Physiol. (Bethesda). 2006; 21: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 2Chan D.C.

Cell Biol. 2008; 182: 573-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Rather than PP2A, however, the calcium/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase PP2B/calcineurin has been implicated in the dephosphorylation and activation of Drp1 (39Cribbs J.T. Strack S. EMBO Rep. 2007; 8: 939-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar, 40Cereghetti G.M. Stangherlin A. Martins de Brito O. Chang C.R. Blackstone C. Bernardi P. Scorrano L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Thus, further studies are needed to identify the relevant PP2A substrates and dephosphorylation sites among mitochondria restructuring enzymes and their known and unknown modulators (8Hoppins S. Lackner L. Nunnari J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 751-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). Although Bβ2 is a neuron-specific PP2A regulatory subunit, other mitochondrial PP2A holoenzymes have been reported in non-neuronal cells (34Ruvolo P.P. Clark W. Mumby M. Gao F. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22847-22852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). It is therefore likely that similar survival signaling mechanisms operate outside of the nervous system. In summary, our study points to the mitochondrial fission/fusion equilibrium as a pivotal determinant for neuronal life and death decisions, identifies the phosphatase PP2A/Bβ2 as an important modulator, and suggests dysregulation of mitochondrial morphogenesis as a plausible pathogenic mechanism in SCA12. We thank Yisang Yoon (University of Rochester) and Michael Knudson (University of Iowa) for Drp1 and Bcl2 expression plasmids, respectively, and Susan Holmes, Elizabeth O'Hearn, and Russell Margolis (The Johns Hopkins University) and members of the Strack laboratory for stimulating discussions.

Recent clinical studies have demonstrated that ETV is also active against the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Unlike all approved nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase RT) inhibitors (NRTIs), ETV contains a 3′-hydroxyl group that allows further nucleotide incorporation events to occur. Thus, the mechanism of inhibition probably differs from classic chain termination. Here, we show that the incorporated ETV-monophosphate (MP) can interfere with three distinct stages of DNA synthesis. First, incorporation of the next nucleotide at position n + 1 following ETV-MP is compromised, although DNA synthesis eventually continues. Second, strong pausing at position n + 3 suggests a long range effect, referred to as “delayed chain-termination.” Third, the incorporated ETV-MP can also act as a “base pair confounder” during synthesis of the second DNA strand, when the RT enzyme needs to pass the inhibitor in the template. Enzyme kinetics revealed that delayed chain termination is the dominant mechanism of action. High resolution foot-printing experiments suggest that the incorporated ETV-MP “repels” the 3′-end of the primer from the active site of HIV-1 RT, which, in turn, diminishes incorporation of the natural nucleotide substrate at position n + 4. Most importantly, delayed chain termination protects ETV-MP from phosphorolytic excision, which represents a major resistance mechanism for approved NRTIs. Collectively, these findings provide a rationale and important tools for the development of novel, more potent delayed chain terminators as anti-HIV agents.

However, the development of resistance can limit their clinical utility (8Boucher C.A. Cammack N. Schipper P. Schuurman R. Rouse P. Wainberg M.A. Cameron J.M. Antimicrob.

The incidence of 3TC resistance is high in part because 3TC has been for a long time the only small molecule approved for the treatment of HBV, and 3TC has also been and remains an important component in recommended drug regimens for the treatment of HIV (2De Clercq E. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2007; 6: 1001-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). The acyclic phosphonate tenofovir is active against 3TC-resistant HIV and HBV strains (18Miller M.D. Margot N.A.

This compound does not appear to select for M204 and L180M in HBV, although the preexistence of the two mutations can decrease susceptibility to ETV (26Colonno R.J. Rose R. Baldick C.J. Levine S.

Other additional mutations can further amplify clinically relevant levels of resistance to this drug (28Tenney D.J. Levine S.M. Rose R.E. Walsh A.W. Weinheimer S.P. Discotto L. Plym M. Pokornowski K. Yu C.F. Angus P. Ayres A. Bartholomeusz A. Sievert W. Thompson G. Warner N. Locarnini S. Colonno R.J. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2004; 48: 3498-3507Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). In contrast, it has recently been demonstrated that ETV can select for the M184V mutation in HBV/HIV-co-infected individuals (29McMahon M.A. Jilek B.L. Brennan T.P. Shen L. Zhou Y. Wind-Rotolo M. Xing S. Bhat S. Hale B. Hegarty R. Chong C.R. Liu J.O. Siliciano R.F. Thio C.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 2007; 356: 2614-2621Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). These data showed unambiguously that ETV can exert antiretroviral effects, which led to the recommendation that ETV should not be administered in co-infected individuals unless these persons are simultaneously on highly active antiretroviral therapy (29McMahon M.A. Jilek B.L. Brennan T.P. Shen L. Zhou Y. Wind-Rotolo M. Xing S. Bhat S. Hale B. Hegarty R. Chong C.R. Liu J.O. Siliciano R.F. Thio C.L. N. Engl. J.

Subsequent case reports and clinical studies with smaller cohorts are consistent with the original study, and in vitro selection experiments as well as phenotypic susceptibility measurements with HIV-1 strains containing the M184V mutation confirmed the clinical data (31Soriano V. Vispo E. Labarga P. Barreiro P. AIDS. 2008; 22: 911-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 32Sasadeusz J. Audsley J. Mijch A. Baden R. Caro J. Hunter H. Matthews G. McMahon M.A. Olender S.A.

Moreover, pre-steady-state kinetics with wild type HIV-1 RT demonstrated that the enzyme can incorporate ETV-monophosphate (MP) (36Domaoal R.A. McMahon M. Thio C.L. Bailey C.M. Tirado-Rives J. Obikhod A. Detorio M. Rapp K.L. Siliciano R.F. Schinazi R.F. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 5452-5459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The M184V mutant appears to be able to discriminate against the inhibitor, since the efficiency of incorporation of ETV-MP is severely diminished. Aside from the clinical importance of these findings, the observation that ETV exhibits antiretroviral activity has potential implications for the development of novel drugs that may evade major resistance pathways in HIV. Unlike all approved nucleoside analogue RT inhibitors that lack the 3′-hydroxyl group of the sugar moiety and act as chain terminators, ETV contains this group, which can attack the next incoming nucleotide on its ;-phosphate (Fig. 1). Thus, DNA synthesis may be inhibited at several steps after incorporation of ETV-MP. In vitro studies with HBV replication complexes (37Seifer M. Hamatake R.K. Colonno R.J. Standring D.N. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 3200-3208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and purified HIV-1 RT (36Domaoal R.A. McMahon M. Thio C.L. Bailey C.M. Tirado-Rives J. Obikhod A. Detorio M. Rapp K.L. Siliciano R.F. Schinazi R.F. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 5452-5459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), respectively, indicated pausing of DNA synthesis immediately following incorporation of ETV-MP and later following incorporation of up to three additional nucleotides. Such late pausing is referred to as “delayed chain termination.” Very few nucleotide analogues have been described that show this type of inhibition of HIV-1 RT (38Boyer P.L. Julias J.G. Marquez V.E. Hughes S.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 345: 441-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar); however, these compounds are toxic and/or are not converted intracellularly into their triphosphate form (39Marquez V.E. Ben-Kasus T. Barchi Jr., J.J. Green K.M. Nicklaus M.C. Agbaria R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 543-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). ETV may therefore be exploited as a model compound for the study of delayed chain termination and its implications in current drug development efforts. Of note, ETV is fully susceptible against a background of thymidine analogue-associated mutations (TAMs) (36Domaoal R.A. McMahon M. Thio C.L. Bailey C.M. Tirado-Rives J. Obikhod A. Detorio M. Rapp K.L. Siliciano R.F. Schinazi R.F. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 5452-5459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), which reduce susceptibility to literally all approved nucleotide analogue RT inhibitors (NRTIs), albeit at different degrees (40Menendez-Arias L. Virus Res. 2008; 134: 124-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). TAMs include changes at positions 41, 67, 70, 210, 215, and 219 that were shown to increase the phosphorolytic excision of incorporated nucleotide analogues (41Goldschmidt V. Marquet R. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 1687-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 42Meyer P.R. Matsuura S.E. Mian A.M. So A.G. Scott W.A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 35-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). These mutations are able to recruit ATP as a PPi donor, which ultimately removes the inhibitor from the primer terminus and leads to the rescue of DNA synthesis. ETV may evade this resistance mechanism through delayed chain termination. Here, we demonstrate that delayed chain termination at position n + 3(i.e. three nucleotides following incorporation of ETV-MP) is the major mechanism of inhibition. Although ETV-MP is efficiently excised with TAMs containing RT enzymes, the inhibitor is not excised when the primer was extended by three additional nucleotides. These proof-of-principle studies show that delayed chain terminators are protected from excision. Enzymes and Nucleic Acids—Heterodimeric reverse transcriptase p66/p51 was expressed and purified as described (43Le Grice S.F. Cameron C.E. Benkovic S.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 130-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Mutant enzymes were generated through site-directed mutagenesis using the Stratagene QuikChange kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. TAM refers to HIV1 RT containing the following substitutions: M41L, D67N, L210W, and T215Y. Oligodeoxynucleotides used in this study were chemically synthesized and purchased from Invitrogen and from Integrated DNA Technologies. The following sequences were used as templates: T45, 5′-ATTGAGTATGAAGGATTGATATCTATTCACTCCACTATACCACTC; T50, 5′-CCAATATTCACCATCAAGGCTTGACGTCACTTCACTCCACTATACCACTC; T50A, 5′-CCAATATTCACCATCAAGGCTTGACGTGACTTCACTCCACTATACCACTC; T50A6, 5′-CCAATATTCACCATCAAGGCTTGATGAAACTTCACTCCACTATACCACTC. The underlined nucleotides are the portion of the templates annealed to the primer. The following primers were used in this study: P1, 5′-GAGTGGTATAGTGGAGTGAA; P1b, 5′-GAGTGGTATAGTGGAGTGAATA; P2, 5′-ATTGAGTATGAAGGATTGAT. Synthesis of ETV-TP—2-Amino-9-[4-hydroxy-3-(hydroxymethyl)-2-methylidene-cyclopentyl]-3H-purin-6-one (4.71 mg, 1.7 mmol) was dissolved in 200 ml of dry 1,3-dimethyl-2-oxohexahydropyrimidine N,N′-dimethylpropylene urea with 15 molecular sieves under nitrogen and stirred for 24 h. The mixture was chilled with an ice-water bath and stirred for 1 h, followed by the slow addition of phosphorus oxychloride (3 eq) and stirred for another 50 min. A solution of tributylammonium pyrophosphate (4 eq) in 200 ;l of 1,3-Dimethyl-3,4,5,6-tetrahydro-2(1H)-pyrimidinone and tributyl amine (15 eq) were simultaneously added to the reaction. After 2 h, the reaction was quenched with ice-cold water and slowly brought to room temperature. The solution was washed with chloroform, and the aqueous layer was collected and co-evaporated with water three times. The product was resuspended in 100 ml of water and purified by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), followed by co-evaporation with water, giving a total yield of 9% with 98% purity. ETV-TP was finally purified by ion exchange HPLC. DNA Synthesis at Position n—150 nm DNA/DNA template-primer hybrid T50A/P1 was incubated with 50 nm of HIV-1 RT in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 50 mm NaCl, in the presence of increasing concentrations of dGTP or ETV-TP or both. The concentrations of dGTP ranged from 0.008 to 2 ;m, and the concentrations of ETV-TP covered the range of 0.039–10 ;m in a series of 2-fold dilutions. In the experiments where both nucleotides were present, only ETV-TP concentrations were varied from 0.16 to 50 ;m in the series of 2-fold dilutions, whereas the concentration of dGTP was kept constant at 0.05, 0.1, or 0.5 ;m. Nucleotide incorporation was initiated by the addition of MgCl2 to a final concentration of 10 mm, and the reactions were allowed to proceed for 3 min. The reaction conditions were optimized such that the rate of the product formation was within its linear range with respect to the enzyme concentration and time point, which is consistent with the steady-state approach. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 3 reaction volumes of formamide containing traces of bromphenol blue and xylene cyanol. The samples were then subjected to 18% denaturing PAGE followed by phosphorimaging. The incorporation of single nucleotides was quantified as the fraction of the DNA substrate (template-primer) converted to product (template-primer + 1 nucleotide). The rate of the reaction was plotted versus the concentration of nucleotide substrate. The data were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation by use of GraphPad Prism (version 4.0) to determine Km and kcat values for dGTP and ETV-TP. Significant figures for the fitted data are as reported by the software. kcat was defined as the maximal rate of single nucleotide incorporation. Km was defined as the concentration of dNTP at which the rate of single nucleotide incorporation equals half of the maximal rate. In the experiments where both dGTP and ETV-TP were present for the incorporation at position n, the concentration of ETV-TP at which the incorporation of dGTP was reduced by 50% (IC50) was determined by plotting the percentage incorporation of dGTP versus the concentration of ETV-TP. The data were fit to a sigmoidal curve (variable slope). DNA Synthesis at Position n + 1—The reactions were conducted as described above, except that (i) T50A/P1 was used as the DNA/DNA hybrid, (ii) 1 ;m dGTP or 10 ;m ETV-TP was used for the incorporation at position n, and (iii) the time point was extended to 30 min to ensure maximum product formation at position n. Then increasing concentrations of dTTP from 0.02 to 2 ;m with n = dGMP and 0.078 to 10 ;m were allowed to proceed for 4 min. DNA Synthesis at Position n + 4—The reactions were conducted as described, except that (i) T50A6/P1 was used as the DNA/DNA hybrid and (ii) increasing concentrations of dCTP from 0.03 to 256 ;m were added in a series of 2-fold dilutions. Reactions were allowed to proceed for 4 min. In the experiment where dGTP, ETV-TP, dTTP, and dCTP were present at the same time, only dGTP concentrations were varied from 0.03 to 2 ;m, whereas the concentrations of ETV-TP, dTTP, and dCTP were kept constant at 5 and 0.5 ;m, respectively. In addition, the concentrations of HIV-RT and DNA substrate were adjusted to 100 nm, and the reactions were stopped after 5 min to enhance the signal at the pausing sites. Site-specific Footprinting—In preparation of the footprinting reaction, the 5′-end-labeled template T50A was heat-annealed with the primer P1. 50 nm DNA/DNA hybrid was incubated with 750 nm HIV-RT for 10 min in a reaction mixture containing sodium cacodylate, pH 7 (120 mm), NaCl (20 mm), DTT (0.5 mm), MgCl2 (10 mm), and 25 ;m ddGTP or ETV-TP in a final volume of 15 ;l. At the 10 min time point, increasing concentrations of foscarnet (PFA) or dTTP from 0.8 to 500 ;m were added to the reactions in a series of 5-fold dilutions, followed by an incubation of 5 min at 37 °C. The complex was treated with 0.1 mm ammonium Fe(II) sulfate hexahydrate (44Marchand B. Gotte M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35362-35372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The reactions were allowed to proceed for 5 min and were processed and analyzed as described. Ribonuclease H (RNase H) Activity Assays—Primer P1, annealed to T50A or T50A6 templates, was extended by 2 or 4 nucleotides, respectively, such that dGMP or ETV-MP were incorporated at position n, followed by 1 or 3 more nucleotides. These primers with n = dGMP or ETV-MP were gel-purified and reannealed to T50A or T50A6 RNA templates, respectively. 3′-End-labeling with [32P]pCp and T4 RNA ligase was carried out as described (45Gotte M. Fackler S. Hermann T. Perola E. Cellai L. Gross H.J. Le Grice S.F. Heumann H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 833-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The RNA/DNA hybrid (50 nm) was incubated with 750 nm HIV-RT in a reaction buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 50 mm NaCl, and 0.3 mm EDTA at 37 °C for 10 min. Heparin (4 mg/ml, final) was added to the reaction mixture and allowed to incubate for variable time ranging from 0 to 60 s, after which MgCl2 (10 mm, final) was added to initiate the RNase H activity. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 3 reaction volumes of formamide containing traces of bromphenol blue and xylene cyanol. The samples were subjected to 18% denaturing PAGE, followed by phosphorimaging. RNase H activity was monitored and quantified based on the appearance of the 3′-end-labeled RNA template degradation products. RNase H-specific products were identified based on the experiments controlling for the efficiency of the heparin trap as well as for RNase H activity in the absence of MgCl2. The rate of the dissociation of the RNA/DNA hybrid from the RNase H active site of the HIV-1 RT (koff) was determined by plotting the percentage of remaining RNase H activity versus incubation time with heparin and fitting the data points to a single exponential decay function. Inhibition of DNA Synthesis with Primer-Templates Containing dGMP, ddGMP, or ETV-MP at the 3′-end of the primer—The rate constant (kcat) for dGTP incorporation using 150 nm T50A/P1 primer-template was determined from the slope of the linear portion of product formation versus time. Reactions were carried out in the presence of 50 nm HIV-RT and 1 ;m dGTP. The effect of the addition of 300 nm primer-templates already containing dGMP, ddGMP, or ETV-MP at the 3′-end of the primer on the kcat was monitored to assess potential differences in relative affinities of dGMP-, ddGMP-, or ETV-containing primer-templates. DNA Synthesis across a Template Containing ETV-MP—The T45/P1 RNA/DNA hybrid was used to generate a template containing ETV-MP. The RT-associated RNase H activity degraded the original T45 RNA template. The newly synthesized DNA template containing ETV-MP was annealed to 5′-end-labeled primer P2 and incubated with 500 nm HIV-1 RT in the presence of an MgCl2 (10 mm) and dNTP mix (0.5 ;m). Aliquots were taken at time points 1, 2, 5, 20 min, and data were processed and analyzed as described. ATP-dependent Phosphorolysis— The radiolabeled T50A6/P1 DNA/DNA hybrid was extended by a single nucleotide to generate an oligonucleotide with ETV-MP or dGMP at the 3′-end. Primers were also further extended by three residues, gel-purified, and annealed with T50A6. The 50 nm DNA/DNA template-primer hybrid with ETV-MP at the 3′-end of the primer or ETV-MP followed by an additional 3 nucleotides was incubated with 750 nm HIV-1 RT in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 3.5 mm ATP (pyrophosphatase-treated). Aliquots were taken at time points 1, 3, 6, 12, 25, 40, and 60 min and analyzed as described. ETV-TP Is Able to Compete with dGTP—In order to assess the efficiency with which ETV-MP is incorporated in comparison with its natural counterpart dGMP, we determined the concentration of ETV-TP required for 50% inhibition (IC50) of incorporation of dGMP (Fig. S1). High resolution polyacrylamide gels allowed us to distinguish between primers extended by dGMP or ETV-MP, respectively (Fig. S1A). As expected for a competitive inhibitor, we found that the IC50 (ETV-TP) value increased with increasing concentrations of dGTP (Fig. S1B). Concentrations of dGTP as low as 0.5 ;m, which is within the physiologically relevant range, require relatively high concentrations of 19 ;m ETV-TP to obtain 50% inhibition. These data are in good agreement with steady-state kinetics that show 14–18-fold differences in efficiencies of incorporation (Table 1).TABLE 1Summary of the single nucleotide incorporation kinetic constants for HIV-RT at position n Km is in ;m dGTP or ETV-TP. kcat is in min–1. Selectivity is defined as a ratio of kcat/Km for dGTP over kcat/Km for ETV-TP. S.D. was determined on the basis of at least three independent experiments.SubstrateSelectivitydGTPETV-TPkcatKmkcat/KmkcatKmkcat/Kmmin–1;mmin–1;m0.51 ± 0.0680.041 ± 0.0075130.34 ± 0.110.45 ± 0.0750.7418 Open table in a new tab Incorporation of ETV-MP Causes Pausing at Positions n and n + 3— The effects of incorporation of ETV-MP at position n were analyzed by studying the efficiency of subsequent nucleotide incorporation events (Fig. 2). Enzyme pausing is evident at positions n and n + 3 and to a lesser extent also at position n + 2 (Fig. 2B). Pausing at positions n and n + 2 can be overcome, whereas pausing at position n + 3 represents the final product when DNA synthesis was limited to four nucleotide incorporation events (Fig. 2C). Increasing the concentrations of dCTP reduced pausing and resulted in increased product formation at position n + 4 (Fig. 2D). Thus, incorporation of ETV-MP appears to exert an immediate effect on the next nucleotide at position n + 1, and pausing at position n + 3 points to long range effects of the inhibitor that can affect nucleotide incorporation at position n + 4. To translate these findings into quantitative terms, we devised primer-template substrates that allowed us to determine the efficiency of nucleotide incorporation at positions n + 1 and n + 4. The primer strands contained either ETV-MP or dGMP at position n. Steady-state kinetics revealed that the incorporation of the next complementary nucleotide was ∼7-fold reduced when the primer was terminated with ETV-MP (Table 2). Nucleotide incorporation at position n + 4 was measured with primers that were further extended by 3 nucleotides to yield the n + 3 substrate. The measurements revealed substantially higher reductions (i.e. >1000-fold) in efficiency of nucleotide incorporation with ETV-MP at position n. Thus, inhibition at position n + 4 was more than 2 orders of mag"

https://openalex.org/W2008602342,"Neurotransmitter binding to Cys-loop receptors promotes a prodigious transmembrane flux of several million ions/s, but to date, structural determinants of ion flux have been identified flanking the membrane-spanning region. Using x-ray crystallography, sequence analysis, and single-channel recording, we identified a novel determinant of ion conductance near the point of entry of permeant ions. Co-crystallization of acetylcholine-binding protein with sulfate anions revealed coordination of SO42- with a ring of lysines at a position equivalent to 24Å above the lipid membrane in homologous Cys-loop receptors. Analysis of multiple sequence alignments revealed that residues equivalent to the ring of lysines are negatively charged in cation-selective receptors but are positively charged in anion-selective receptors. Charge reversal of side chains at homologous positions in the nicotinic receptor from the motor end plate decreases unitary conductance up to 80%. Selectivity filters stemming from transmembrane α-helices have similar pore diameters and compositions of amino acids. These findings establish that when the channel opens under a physiological electrochemical gradient, permeant ions are initially stabilized within the extracellular vestibule of Cys-loop receptors, and this stabilization is a major determinant of ion conductance.

Ion selectivity defines two major classes of Cys-loop receptors. Receptors that selectively translocate cations are excitatory and include vertebrate nAChRs 3The abbreviations used are: nAChRnicotinic acetylcholine receptorAChBPacetylcholine-binding proteinAcAplysia californica 3The abbreviations used are: nAChRnicotinic acetylcholine receptorAChBPacetylcholine-binding proteinAcAplysia californica and 5-HT3 receptors, whereas receptors that selectively translocate anions are inhibitory and include γ-aminobutyric acid and glycine receptors. A molecular basis for ion selectivity was first proposed based on conserved rings of charged residues and the observation that mutations of these residues in the nAChR influence conductance and selectivity (supplemental Fig. S1) (1Imoto K.

Subsequent studies have focused on reversing selectivity (2Galzi J.L. Devillers-Thiery A. Hussy N. Bertrand S. Changeux J.P. Bertrand D.

Moorhouse A.J. Schofield P.R. Barry P.H. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2004; 86: 161-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). These studies described ion selectivity filters in transmembrane-spanning domains using mutagenesis and electrophysiological techniques. More recently, mutations of residues in a channel cytoplasmic region altered conductance in 5-HT3A receptors (5Kelley S.P. Dunlop J.I. Kirkness E.F. Lambert J.J. Peters J.A. Nature. 2003; 424: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), suggesting that other domains form vestibules leading into the channel that may influence ion conductance and selectivity. In Cys-loop receptors, a large N-terminal domain encloses a vestibule that extends from the constricted ion pore extracellularly by 60 Å. Structural and computational studies have suggested that regions within the N-terminal domain contribute to ion conductance and selectivity (6Unwin N. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 967-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (1396) Google Scholar, 7Wang H.-L. Cheng X. Taylor P. McCammon J.A. Sine S.M. PLoS Comput.

Cryo-electron microscopy applied to the nAChR from Torpedo provided structural information at a resolution of 4 Å (6Unwin N. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 967-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (1396) Google Scholar, 8Miyazawa A. Fujiyoshi Y. Unwin N. Nature. 2003; 423: 949-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar), but single ions and most amino acid side chains could not be resolved. Currently, our understanding of ion translocation through channels comes from studies on voltage-gated ion channels (9Dutzler R. Campbell E.B. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 415: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (1326) Google Scholar, 10Zhou Y. Morais-Cabral J.H. Kaufman A. MacKinnon R.

Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5649) Google Scholar), where non-hydrated ions are coordinated in a pore lined with partial charges of carbonyl groups of the protein backbone, and single ions pass processionally in a linear chain through the channel. Functional studies suggest a fundamentally different mechanism of ion translocation in Cys-loop receptors. First, hydrophobic α-helices line the pore, and ions remain hydrated as they pass. Second, ions are coordinated by fully charged amino acid side chains in multiple locations along the ion translocation pathway. Third, the diameter of the channel pore is larger in the Cys-loop family of receptors. Herein, we describe a novel ion selectivity filter stemming from the β-sheets of the extracellular ligand-binding domain of nAChRs and provide a high resolution atomic structure of ion coordination in the water-soluble AChBP. Using the low resolution structure of the nAChR transmembrane domain (8Miyazawa A. Fujiyoshi Y. Unwin N. Nature. 2003; 423: 949-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar), we show spatial and charge similarities between the β-sheet filter and α-helical filters of the transmembrane domain. A gene chemically synthesized from oligonucleotides encoding the soluble Ac_AChBP was expressed in HEK293S cells lacking the N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I gene (GnTI– cells) (12Reeves P.J. Callewaert N. Contreras R. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13419-13424Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Ac_AChBP was purified from the media as described previously (13Hansen S.B. Sulzenbacher G. Huxford T. Marchot P. Taylor P. Bourne Y. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3635-3646Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar, 14Hansen S.B. Talley T.T. Radic Z. Taylor P. J. Biol.

Sulfate complexes were formed in 1.26 m (NH4)2SO42− and 0.1 m cacodylate (pH 6.5) with 10–15 mg/ml protein at room temperature. Crystallization was achieved by vapor diffusion at 18 °C using a protein-to-well ratio of 1:1 in 0.2-μl sitting drops using a Douglas Oryx8 robot. 20% glycerol was added to the drop, and the crystals were flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen. Data were processed with HKL2000 (15Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38253) Google Scholar), and all further computing was carried out with the CCP4 Program Suite (16Collaborative Computational Project Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19668) Google Scholar). A solution was obtained by molecular replacement with AMoRe (17Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5026) Google Scholar) using the structure of apo-Ac_AChBP (Protein Data Bank code 2BYN) (13Hansen S.B. Sulzenbacher G. Huxford T. Marchot P. Taylor P. Bourne Y. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3635-3646Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar) as a search model. The initial electron density maps were improved considerably by manual adjustment with the graphics program Xtalview Version 4.1 (18McRee D. J. Mol. Graph. 1992; 10: 44-46Crossref Google Scholar). All structures were refined with REFMAC (19Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13712) Google Scholar) using the maximum likelihood approach and incorporating bulk solvent corrections, anisotropic Fo versus Fc scaling, and TLS refinement with each subunit defining a TLS group. Electrophysiological studies were performed in BOSC cells (20Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2275) Google Scholar) using the cell-attached patch-clamp method essentially as described previously (21Wang H.-L. Milone M. Ohno K. Shen X.M. Tsujino A. Batocchi A.P. Tonali P. Brengman J. Engel A.G. Sine S.M. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 226-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). For electrophysiological studies, BOSC cells (20Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2275) Google Scholar), a variant of the HEK293 cell line, were transfected with human wild-type or mutant nAChR subunit cDNAs using calcium phosphate precipitation. A plasmid encoding green fluorescent protein was included in all transfections to allow identification of transfected cells under fluorescence optics. Cells were used for single-channel current measurements 1 or 2 days after transfection. Mutant cDNAs were constructed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and were confirmed by sequencing the entire coding region. Coexpression of four or five nAChR subunits with Lys substituted for Asp97 greatly reduced the number of nAChRs on the cell surface, as indicated by decreased binding of 125I-α-bungarotoxin and low frequency of acetylcholine-elicited single-channel openings detected by patch clamp. Thus, for receptors with four or five Lys substitutions, we incorporated a Leu-to-Ser mutation at position 9′ of transmembrane domain M2 in the ϵ-subunit (ϵL9′S) and found that it enhanced the frequency of channel opening but did not alter the unitary conductance of receptors without D97K mutations. Single-channel recordings were obtained in the cell-attached patch configuration at 22 °C. The bath and pipette solutions contained 142 mm KCl, 5.4 mm NaCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1.7 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). Acetylcholine (Sigma) was kept as a 100 mm stock solution at –80 °C and added to the pipette solution before recording. Patch pipettes were pulled from 7052 capillary tubes (Garner Glass) and coated with Sylgard (Dow Corning). Single-channel currents were recorded using an Axopatch 200B patch-clamp amplifier (Molecular Devices) and digitized at 2-μs intervals with the PCI-6111E fast data acquisition board (National Instruments) using Acquire software (Bruxton Corp.). Single-channel currents were detected using TAC software (Bruxton Corp.) at a final bandwidth of 10 kHz. Single-channel current amplitudes were determined by fitting a Gaussian function to all-point histograms generated from the digitized current traces. In most cases, two Gaussian functions were needed to describe the all-point histogram from each recording; one Gaussian function corresponded to the closed current level, and the other corresponded to the open current level. The difference between the mean values of the two distributions yielded the single-channel current amplitude. The soluble AChBP from mollusks is an established structural and functional surrogate of the N-terminal ligand-binding domain of Cys-loop receptors amenable to high resolution crystallographic studies (22Bouzat C. Gumilar F. Spitzmaul G. Wang H.-L. Rayes D. Hansen S.B. Taylor P. Sine S.M. Nature. 2004; 430: 896-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 23Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. Schuurmans M. van der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1564) Google Scholar). We co-crystallized Ac_AChBP in the presence of the anions sulfate and cacodylate. Crystals diffracted to 3.1-Å resolution, and the data were refined to an R/Rfree of 21/25 (supplemental Table S1). The asymmetric subunit contains two pentamers each enclosing a symmetric ring of sulfate ions 13 Å in diameter and orthogonal to the 5-fold symmetry axis located in the vestibule. Arg97 and Lys42 occupy a single conformation in each subunit and coordinate one of five total sulfate ions per pentamer (Fig. 1, A–C). When viewed perpendicular to the central vestibule, the ring of sulfates is located ∼15 Å apical to what would be the outer membrane interface in a full-length receptor (Fig. 1A). Sequence alignment of human Cys-loop receptors shows that residues at a position equivalent to Arg97 in Ac_AChBP are conserved as Asp in cation-selective receptors, whereas they are conserved as Lys or adjacent Lys residues in anion-selective receptors (Fig. 2); Lys42 is not conserved in the family. In the Torpedo nAChR, Asp97 extends from a loop that forms the narrowest region of the central vestibule of the N-terminal ligand-binding domain. We reasoned that residue 97 may be positioned to filter ions analogous to the selectivity filters that flank the α-helical transmembrane domain or within the cytoplasmic domain. To determine whether the ring of charged residues contributes to ion translocation, we examined Asp97 of the α-subunit and residues at equivalent positions of the β-, δ-, and ϵ-subunits in the nicotinic receptor from the motor end plate. We reversed the charges of residues in all five subunits, coexpressed the subunits to form heteropentameric receptors, and recorded single-channel currents elicited by acetylcholine (Fig. 3). Compared with the wild-type receptor, the mutant receptor exhibited decreased unitary current amplitude at each test potential (Fig. 3, A and B); a plot of unitary current against transmembrane potential reveals a straight line, the slope of which yields the unitary conductance and shows a decrease of 70% compared with the wild-type nAChR (Fig. 3F). Channel openings of receptors containing five Lys substitutions also appear prolonged; this is likely a consequence of the mutation in the second transmembrane domain needed to enhance expression (see “Experimental Procedures”), which also increases mean channel open time (24Labarca C. Nowak M.W. Zhang H. Tang L. Deshpande P. Lester H.A. Nature. 1995; 376: 514-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The conductance decrease depends nonlinearly on the number of charge-reversal mutations in the pentamer, showing no change following reversal of the two α-subunits and only a slight decrease with reversal of three subunits (Fig. 3, D and E). However, the net charge of the ring is less important than the side chain substitutions and the locations of the mutant subunits. Introducing four Lys residues and maintaining one Asp residue (net charge of +3) decreased unitary conductance by 55%, whereas introducing three Lys and two Ala residues (net charge of +3) decreased unitary conductance by 80%. The observation that the ring of charge aligned at α-Asp97 affects unitary conductance agrees with predictions from all atom molecular dynamics simulations, which showed that cations pause for extended periods at this location in the course of passing through the channel (7Wang H.-L. Cheng X. Taylor P. McCammon J.A. Sine S.M. PLoS Comput. Biol. 2008; 4: e41Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Thus positioned close to the point where permeant ions enter the channel, this vestibular ring of charge acts to concentrate and select cations for translocation. The spacing of the α-carbon atoms that form the selectivity filter in Ac_AChBP is 19.3 Å, whereas the equivalent α-carbon atoms in the Torpedo nAChR at 4-Å resolution (6Unwin N. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 967-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (1396) Google Scholar) show an average spacing of 30.3 ± 1.5 Å, a distance that appears inconsistent with a selectivity filter. However, we overlaid a recent 1.94-Å crystallographic structure of the extracellular domain of the α1-subunit (25Dellisanti C.D. Yao Y. Stroud J.C. Wang Z.Z. Chen L. Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 953-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar) onto the two α-subunits of the 4-Å Torpedo nAChR pentamer and found a ring diameter of 21 Å. The decrease in spacing is due to a distinct conformation in the β4/5 loop, where the tip, containing Asp97, protrudes toward the central vestibule. Next, we compared the β-sheet filter in the vestibule of Ac_AChBP with the transmembrane α-helical filters in the 4-Å resolution structure of the Torpedo nAChR (8Miyazawa A. Fujiyoshi Y. Unwin N. Nature. 2003; 423: 949-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar) transmembrane domain (Fig. 4). The ring diameters for the α-helical filters average 19.6 ± 0.2 Å, very close to that of the β-sheet filter (Fig. 5). At the cytosolic entrance in the Torpedo nAChR, the poreforming α-helices narrow to ∼11 Å. The well conserved selectivity filter containing Glu241 is located in this region; the α-carbons of the cytosolic filter show a filter diameter of 18.4 Å, even though they are situated behind the α-helix on the M1–M2 linker (Fig. 4). Thus, regardless of whether the selectivity filter is formed by α-helices or the tips of a β-sheet loop, the diameter of the filter defined by the corresponding α-carbon atoms is determined to be ∼19 Å (6Unwin N. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 967-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (1396) Google Scholar).FIGURE 5The transmembrane (TM) and extracellular (EC) filters are compared in the table on the left.

The highest resolution structure available is a 1.8-Å resolution structure of Ac_AChBP complexed with cocaine in the ligand-binding pocket (26Hansen S.B. Taylor P. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 369: 895-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The central vestibule is water-filled, and the narrowest region encloses the extracellular selectivity filter, ∼24 Å from the “membrane”; two pentameric rings of ordered water stack vertically near the vestibule wall (supplemental Fig. S1). The vertical position of the water rings is 9 Å apical to that of the rings that coordinate SO42-. The lower position of SO42- in the vestibule allows it to occupy a segment with a wider diameter, perhaps reducing electrostatic repulsion between the internal anions. The extracellular β-sheet filter appears late in prokaryote development and is maintained in all eukaryotes (27Tasneem A. Iyer L.M. Jakobsson E. Aravind L. Genome Biol. 2005; 6: R4Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ac_AChBP contains an Arg at position 97 (Fig. 1) (14Hansen S.B. Talley T.T. Radic Z. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24197-24202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), and anion-conducting nAChRs are found for Aplysia (28Kehoe J. McIntosh J.M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 8198-8213Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that Ac_AChBP evolved from an anion channel. Recently, the first high resolution structure of a nicotinic receptor homolog called ELIC was solved from a bacterial species (29Hilf R.J. Dutzler R. Nature. 2008; 452: 375-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Asp86 from ELIC occupies a position near Asp97 in the nAChR, and the diameter defined by α-carbon atoms is 19.1 Å. ELIC may also have an even more apical selectivity filter at Glu64, where an α-helix narrows the extracellular vestibule to a diameter of 20 Å, and the aspartate carboxylates are tilted inward for hydrogen bonding (Fig. 5). The molecular basis of ion selectivity correlates well with the charge-selective nature of Cys-loop receptors. Filters are located at relatively wide regions of the extracellular domain, where a flexible side chain points into the channel lumen. The channel is selective for charge but limited in its selectivity for size or valence. Ions are thought to be hydrated at the level of the filter (30Lewis C.A. Stevens C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 6110-6113Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and bound SO42- coordinates several waters. Coincidently, a pentameric ring forms angles of 108°, an angle amenable to water and ion coordination. Potentially, these geometrical constraints and the need to translocate hydrated ions may have contributed to the rise of pentameric ion channels with an elongated vestibule for ion entry. Characterization of ion selectivity filters in the N-terminal domain and a structural description of ion translocation are fundamental to understanding how Cys-loop receptors function. We have shown for the first time that pentameric β-sheets form a vestibular structure capable of filtering ions as they flow through the open channel. These data demonstrate that the structure of the extracellular domain plays a function role beyond that of ligand binding and its linkage to allosteric gating. The location of the filter is also significant; when nicotinic receptor channels open, sodium ions flow from outside the cell to the cytoplasm and are thus first exposed to the most extracellular selectivity filter. As a region of conserved structure and critical sequence positions, the vestibule could serve as a site for non-competitive modulators.

We have recently shown that GSH depletion by its extrusion regulates apoptosis independently of excessive reactive oxygen species accumulation. However, the mechanisms by which GSH depletion regulates apoptosis are still unclear. Because disruption of intracellular ionic homeostasis, associated with apoptotic volume decrease (AVD), is necessary for the progression of apoptotic cell death, we sought to evaluate the relationship between GSH transport and ionic homeostasis during Fas ligand (FasL)-induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells. GSH depletion in response to FasL was paralleled by distinct degrees of AVD identified by differences in cellular forward scatter and electronic impedance analysis. Inhibition of GSH efflux prevented AVD, K+ loss, and the activation of two distinct ionic conductances, mediated by Kv1.3 and outward rectifying Cl– channels. Reciprocally, stimulation of GSH loss accelerated the loss of K+, AVD, and consequently the progression of the execution phase of apoptosis. Although high extracellular K+ inhibited FasL-induced apoptosis, GSH depletion was largely independent of K+ loss.

Apoptosis or programmed cell death is a ubiquitous energy-dependent, evolutionary conserved process. Under physiological conditions it is important not only in the constant turnover of cells in all tissues, but also during the normal development and senescence of the organism. Moreover, its deregulation has been observed to occur as either a cause or consequence of distinct pathologies (1Green D.R. Immunol.

However, the mechanism involved in the regulation of apoptosis by changes in GSHi are still elusive. Apoptotic volume decrease (AVD) and changes in intracellular ionic homeostasis are common early features observed during apoptosis (5Bortner C.D. Cidlowski J.A.

Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39176-39184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), changes in intracellular ion homeostasis during apoptosis have been shown to be necessary for the activation and assembly of the apoptotic machinery (5Bortner C.D.

However, the exact signaling cascades that modulate the changes in ionic homeostasis have not been identified yet. Apoptotic volume decrease, changes in ionic homeostasis, and GSH loss have been observed to occur at early stages of apoptosis (5Bortner C.D. Cidlowski J.A. Pfluegers Arch. 2004; 448: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 22). However, their interrelationship and further connection with the cell death program are unknown. Here we report that GSH efflux occurs concomitant to cell shrinkage or AVD and show that GSH transport is necessary for changes in intracellular ionic homeostasis, during FasL-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, we present evidence that the regulation of the execution phase of apoptosis by changes in GSHi is mediated, at least in part, by the modulation of changes in the intracellular ionic balance. Reagents—RPMI 1640 medium, penicillin/streptomycin, and heat-inactivated fetal calf serum were from Invitrogen. MK571 was from Biomol (Plymouth, PA). l-(α,β-Diaminopropionyl22)-Stichodactyla helianthus peptide neurotoxin (ShK-Dap22) was from Bachem (King of Prussia, PA). Monochlorobimane (mBCl) and 1,3-benzenedicarboxylic acid, 4,4′-[1,4,10,13-tetraoxa-7,16-diazacyclooctadecane-7,16-diylbis(5-methoxy-6,2-Benzofuran-diyl)]bis-tetrakis [(acetyloxy)-methyl]ester (PBFI-AM) were from Molecular Probes Inc. (Eugene, OR). Cytofix/cytoperm kit and monoclonal antibodies PE-conjugated anti-active caspase 3, and FITC-conjugated anti-PARP cleavage site were from BD Biosciences. Anti-caspase 3, anti-caspase 7, anti-PARP, and anti-α-fodrin antibodies (human-specific) were from Cell Signaling Technology Inc (Beverly, MA). All other reagents were from Sigma. Cell Culture and Media—Jurkat cells, E6.1 clone (human leukemia) were obtained from American Tissue Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 4 mm glutamine, 31 mg/liter penicillin, and 50 mg/liter streptomycin at 37 °C, 7% CO2 atmosphere. Cells (5–7 × 105 cells/ml) were incubated with Fas ligand (FasL) (Kamiya Biomedical Co. Seattle, WA) for the time indicated to induce apoptosis. In media containing high glutathione (+GSH) or high S-methyl-GSH, NaCl was substituted with 25 mm of each compound, maintaining the same osmolarity of the media. High extracellular K+ medium (high [K+]e) was made by isosmolar substitution of extracellular 104 mm NaCl with KCl. Media osmolarity were measured on a Wescor 5500 vapor pressure osmometer (Logan, UT). Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorting (FACS)—FasL-induced apoptotic parameters were analyzed by FACS, using an LSR II flow cytometer and FACSDiva software (BD Biosciences) for data analysis. Cells were analyzed at a cell density of 5–7 × 105 cells/ml, and 1 × 104 cells were recorded. Fluorophores were diluted in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and preloaded at 37 °C, 7% CO2. The final concentration of DMSO never exceeded 0.1%. When indicated, propidium iodide (PI) was added to a final concentration of 10 μg/ml, to assess the loss of membrane integrity. Sequential analysis of the distinct fluorophores was used, and cells with increased PI fluorescence were excluded during the analysis. Cells were analyzed in FL-3 fluorescence for PI (488 nm excitation, 695/40 nm emission). Histograms and plots in all cases are representative of at least three different experiments. Changes in different morphological and biochemical parameters during apoptosis induced by FasL in Jurkat cells were determined as follows. Changes in Forward Scatter (Cell Size)—Cell size was determined as changes in the forward scatter light pattern of the cells. Cells were excited with an argon 488 nm laser. The forward-angle light scatter relates to cell diameter, i.e. cell shrinkage is reflected as a decrease in the amount of forward scattered light. Changes in Intracellular Glutathione Content, GSHi—Cells were preloaded for 10 min with 10 μm mBCl, which forms blue fluorescent adducts with intracellular glutathione (40Hedley D.W. Chow S. Cytometry. 1994; 15: 349-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Immediately prior to flow cytometry examination, PI was added. For mBCl, cells were excited with a UV 405 nm laser, and emission was acquired with a 440/40 filter. Changes in the GSHi are reflected by the appearance of populations of cells with differences in mBCl fluorescence, reflecting changes in GSHi. Populations were gated as described previously (22Franco R. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 29542-29557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 34Franco R. Panayiotidis M.I. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 30452-30465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Briefly, contour plots of mBCl fluorescence versus forward scatter were used to identify populations of cells with different GSHi levels induced after FasL treatment. Three different populations were identified and represented independently as follows: cells with high GSHi or control cells (black); cells that displayed an initial reduction in GSHi (10-fold decrease in mBCl fluorescence) and a slight decrease in their forward scatter properties (light gray); and cells with an enhanced depletion of GSHi (100-fold decrease in mBCl fluorescence) and a marked decrease in forward scatter light (dark gray). Changes in Intracellular Potassium, K+i—Cells were preloaded for 1 h with 5 μm PBFI-AM (K+ fluorophore) prior to the time of analysis. The excitation peak of this benzofuran isophthalate derivative narrows significantly upon K+ binding shifting the excitation maxima to shorter wavelengths and causing a large change in the ratio of energy absorbed at 340/380 nm. Immediately prior to flow cytometry examination PI was added. For PBFI, cells were excited with a UV 350/360 nm laser, and emission was examined with a 440/40 filter. Changes in the K+i are reflected by the appearance of populations of cells with differences in PBFI fluorescence, reflecting changes in the intracellular concentration of this ion. Analysis of Plasma Membrane Lipid Symmetry—Externalization of phosphatidylserine during apoptosis was determined by its binding to annexin V conjugated to FITC (Trevigen, Gaithersburg, MD). Briefly, control or treated cells, initially washed in PBS, were incubated with annexin-FITC and PI for 15 min at room temperature according to the manufacturer's instructions. Annexin-FITC/PI-stained samples were diluted in annexin binding buffer and examined immediately by FACS. FITC fluorescence was analyzed in FL-1 (488 nm excitation, 530/30 nm emission). Early apoptotic cells are defined as having annexin-positive, PI-negative staining. Late apoptotic and non-viable cells are both annexin- and PI-positive. Caspase 3 and PARP Cleavage Analysis—Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then fixed and permeabilized using the Cytofix/Cytoperm kit for 30 min at room temperature in the dark according to the manufacturer's specifications. Cells were then pelleted and washed with the Perm/Wash buffer and stained with PE-conjugated anti-active caspase 3 or FITC-conjugated anti-PARP cleavage site-specific antibodies for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. Following incubation, cells were washed with the PermWash buffer and analyzed by flow cytometry. PE and FITC fluorescence were examined in FL-2 (488 nm excitation, 575/26 nm emission) and FL-1, respectively. Electronic Cell Volume Determination—Jurkat cells, treated with or without 10 ng/ml FasL for 4 h, were incubated for an additional 10-min period with 10 μm mBCl. Cell volume (CV) measurements of normal and low mBCl fluorescence populations were performed by analysis of the electronic (impedance) Coulter volume with an NPE Quanta flow cytometer (NPE Systems, Pembroke Pines, FL) as described previously (41Bortner C.D. Sifre M.I. Cidlowski J.A. Methods Enzymol. 2007; 428: 161-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 42Bortner C.D. Sifre M.I. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 7219-7229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Electronic volume calibration was performed for each experiment with 6 μm UV excitable flow cytometry alignment beads (Align Flow, Molecular Probes). Monochlorobimane was excited with a 365-nm excitation filter, and emission was detected on a photomultiplier using a 450/55-nm filter. Populations were depicted in dot plots of mBCl fluorescence and cell diameter (CD) (not shown). Populations with different levels of mBCl fluorescence and hence different levels of intracellular GSH were analyzed in histograms according to their CD values. CV was determined from the electronic cell diameter (d) and the sphere volume equation (π ·d3)/6. Cell Sorting and Confocal Imaging of Cells with Different Intracellular Glutathione Concentration [GSH]i—Jurkat cells, which had been treated with or without 10 ng/ml FasL for 4 h, were incubated for an additional 15-min period with 10 μm mBCl, 10 μm DRAQ (nuclear staining), and 150 nm MitoTracker Green (mitochondrial staining). Sorting of the normal and low mBCl fluorescent cells was accomplished using a BD Biosciences FACS Vantage SE flow cytometer. Sort gates were set on a forward-scatter versus mBCl fluorescence plot. Cells were then sorted based on their mBCl fluorescence and forward scatter properties (see Fig. 1B). Populations of cells with discrete fluorescence intensities, hence intracellular GSH levels, were immediately placed on coverslips and observed immediately using a Zeiss 510 UV laser scanning confocal microscope to obtain simultaneous DIC and confocal images. DRAQ was excited at 633 nm, and emission was collected with a 655–708-nm filter. MitoTracker Green was excited at 488 nm with an argon laser, and emission was collected with a BP 505–550-nm filter. Differential Interference Contrast (DIC) Microscopy—A Zeiss LSM 510 microscope was used to obtain DIC images. Cells were pre-stained for 30 min at 37 °C and 5% CO2 with 5 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 and then washed with fresh culture media. Hoechst-stained cells were examined with a Plan-Apo 63× oil N.A. = 1.4 objective lens to obtain simultaneous DIC and UV images. Hoechst was excited at 390 nm with a Titanium Saphire 750 nm laser, and emission was collected with a BP 465-nm filter. Images were analyzed with LSM 5 image browser software. Protein Extraction and Western Immunoblotting—Cells were pelleted, washed once with ice-cold PBS, and lysed in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na2EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors (Complete Mini protease mixture, Roche Applied Science). Samples were sonicated and centrifuged, and the pellets were discarded. Then samples were assayed in a Beckman DU650 spectrophotometer for protein concentration using the Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad), and cell extracts were normalized to equal protein concentration. Loading buffer containing glycerol, SDS, and bromphenol blue was added, and samples were denatured at 99 °C for 5 min. Protein extracts, 50 μg/sample, were separated by SDS-PAGE on 4–20% gradient polyacrylamide Tris/glycine gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to nitrocellulose. Membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween, 10% nonfat dry milk, and 2% bovine serum albumin. Antibodies were diluted in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween, 5% nonfat dry milk, and 1% bovine serum albumin. Blots were incubated with the corresponding primary antibody (1:1000) overnight. Then blots were incubated with the corresponding horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) diluted 1:10,000. Blots were then visualized on film with the ECL chemiluminescent system (Amersham Biosciences). Blots were subsequently stripped using 65 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS buffer and reprobed for α-tubulin (1:10,000) to verify equal protein loading. Patch Clamp Electrophysiology—Whole-cell currents were investigated at room temperature (20–25 °C) in Jurkat cells using the patch clamp technique in the whole-cell configuration. Jurkat cells were bathed in HEPES-buffered saline solution containing (in mm) the following: 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 2.2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, and 10 glucose at pH 7.3–7.4 (with NaOH), and voltage-clamped to –80 mV with an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Fire-polished pipettes fabricated from borosilicate glass capillaries (WPI, Sarasota, FL) with 5–7-megohm resistance were filled with pipette solution containing (mm) 140 potassium aspartate, 2.2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid, 10 HEPES, and 5 MgATP at pH 7.1–7.2 (with KOH). The reference electrode was a AgCl-wired pellet. Cells were treated with FasL in cell culture medium at 37 °C, 7% CO2. Immediately prior to recording Jurkat cells were gently washed and resuspended in bath solution. Potassium and/or chloride (Cl–) currents were evoked by a range of 100-ms voltage steps from –60 to +60 mV from a holding potential of –80 mV. The currents were measured after 1 min of attaining the whole-cell configuration. Cell capacitance obtained through the pCLAMP software was between 3 and 5 picofarads. Access resistance was typically between 10 and 30 megohms. Data were digitized at 2.5 kHz and filtered at 2 kHz. The currents were acquired with pCLAMP-9 and analyzed with Clampfit 9.2 (Axon Instruments). Statistical Analysis—When indicated, significance of differences in mean values was calculated using the two-tailed Student's t test. The number of experiments performed is indicated in the corresponding legend of the figures. FasL-induced Reduction in Intracellular GSH Content (GSHi) Is Paralleled by Apoptotic Volume Decrease (AVD)—Glutathione depletion and AVD are common early hallmarks of apoptosis induced by numerous stimuli (5Bortner C.D. Cidlowski J.A. Pfluegers Arch. 2004; 448: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 8Franco R. Schoneveld O.J. Pappa A. Panayiotidis M.I. Arch. Physiol.

We recently reported that GSH loss induced by FasL is mediated through the activation of an efflux transport mechanism for GSH extrusion rather than due to its oxidation to GSSG or loss of membrane integrity (22Franco R.

We first analyzed if GSH loss was associated with cell shrinkage or AVD. Single cell analysis of changes in GSHi was done using FACS and the GSH binding dye mBCl. We have previously reported that GSH loss occurs stochastically reflected by the appearance of discrete populations with changes in GSHi. These populations represent two different stages of GSH loss (22Franco R. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 29542-29557Abstract Full Text Full"
https://openalex.org/W2089974025,"Assembly of pili in Gram-positive bacteria and their attachment to the cell wall envelope are mediated by sortases. In Bacillus cereus and its close relative Bacillus anthracis, the major pilin protein BcpA is cleaved between the threonine and the glycine of its C-terminal LPXTG motif sorting signal by the pilin-specific sortase D. The resulting acyl enzyme intermediate is relieved by the nucleophilic attack of the side-chain amino group of lysine within the YPKN motif of another BcpA subunit. Cell wall anchoring of assembled BcpA pili requires sortase A, which also cleaves the LPXTG sorting signal of BcpA between its threonine and glycine residues. We show here that sortases A and D require only the C-terminal sorting signal of BcpA for substrate cleavage. Unlike sortase D, which accepts the YPKN motif as a nucleophile, sortase A forms an amide bond between the BcpA C-terminal carboxyl group of threonine and the side-chain amino group of diaminopimelic acid within the cell wall peptidoglycan of bacilli. These results represent the first demonstration of a cell wall anchor structure for pili, which are deposited by sortase A into the envelope of many different microbes. Assembly of pili in Gram-positive bacteria and their attachment to the cell wall envelope are mediated by sortases. In Bacillus cereus and its close relative Bacillus anthracis, the major pilin protein BcpA is cleaved between the threonine and the glycine of its C-terminal LPXTG motif sorting signal by the pilin-specific sortase D. The resulting acyl enzyme intermediate is relieved by the nucleophilic attack of the side-chain amino group of lysine within the YPKN motif of another BcpA subunit. Cell wall anchoring of assembled BcpA pili requires sortase A, which also cleaves the LPXTG sorting signal of BcpA between its threonine and glycine residues. We show here that sortases A and D require only the C-terminal sorting signal of BcpA for substrate cleavage. Unlike sortase D, which accepts the YPKN motif as a nucleophile, sortase A forms an amide bond between the BcpA C-terminal carboxyl group of threonine and the side-chain amino group of diaminopimelic acid within the cell wall peptidoglycan of bacilli. These results represent the first demonstration of a cell wall anchor structure for pili, which are deposited by sortase A into the envelope of many different microbes. Many Gram-positive bacteria use pili, protein fibers that project from microbial surfaces, to adhere to and invade host tissues or form biofilms (1Telford J.L. Barocchi M. Margarit I. Rappuoli R. Grandi G. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2006; 4: 509-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Gram-positive pili are assembled from pilin subunits that are synthesized as precursors with N-terminal signal peptides and C-terminal sorting signals in the bacterial cytoplasm (P1) (2Ton-That H. Schneewind O. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50: 1429-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The signal peptide is cleaved and precursors translocated through the bacterial membrane by the Sec machinery, thereby generating the P2 precursor (3Ton-That H. Schneewind O.

Assembly of pili involves the polymerization of the major pilin protein, a reaction that is catalyzed by pilin-specific sortase (2Ton-That H. Schneewind O. Mol.

Pilin-specific sortases perform a transpeptidation reaction, whereby the C-terminal LPXTG motif sorting signal of the major pilin protein, BcpA in bacilli, is cleaved between the threonine and the glycine residue (4Budzik J.M.

Intermediary product of this reaction is a thioester-linked acyl-enzyme between the active site cysteine residue of sortase and the carboxyl group of threonine (7Ton-That H. Liu G. Mazmanian S.K.

Nucleophilic attack of the ϵ-amino group of lysine within the YPKN pilin motif of another BcpA subunit resolves the sortase D intermediate and generates the amide bond between the C-terminal carboxyl group of threonine and the side-chain amino group of lysine of adjacent BcpA subunits (4Budzik J.M. Marraffini L.A. Souda P. Whitelegge J.P. Faull K.F. Schneewind O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 10215-10220Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Conservation of pilin-specific sortase, the YPKN motif, and C-terminal sorting signal in the major subunit of pilin proteins suggests that pilus assembly occurs by a universal mechanism in Gram-positive bacteria (2Ton-That H.

Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 4646-4655Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), the mechanisms that provide for the deposition of pili in the cell wall envelope are still unknown. Unlike surface proteins, pili must first be assembled by pilin-specific sortase and then be deposited in the envelope (21Oh S.-Y. Budzik J.M. Schneewind O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 13703-13704Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The latter requires the aforementioned signal peptide, YPKN pilin motif, and sorting signal, however, the requirements for substrate recognition of the major pilin by sortase A are still unknown. Further, the anchored product of the sortase A-mediated reaction, presumably pilin protein linked to cell wall, has not been characterized. Both of these questions are addressed in this report. Bacterial Plasmids and Strains—PCR with primer pairs P2 (encompassing an XbaI site) and P101 (NheI) amplified bcpA between residues 26 and 515 (Table 1).

To swap the bcpA coding region preceding its cell wall sorting signal with isdX1 in pJB69, a PstI site was generated 15 nucleotides upstream of the DNA sequence encoding for the LPVTG cell wall sorting signal with quick change mutagenesis and primers P17/18, as described previously (6Budzik J.M. Marraffini L.A. Schneewind O. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 66: 495-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid, pJB69-PstI, was digested with XbaI, blunt-ended, and digested with PstI. The purified plasmid fragment was ligated with PstI-digested isdX1 Pfu PCR product. Plasmid variants lacking srtD or containing srtD with active site cysteine 207 to alanine substitution were generated by quick change. Primers P173/174 generated pSY13 (isdX1SS-gst-srtDC207A).

Bacilli were suspended in 100 mm NaCl, vortexed briefly, and centrifuged for 2 min at 6000 × g. Cells were washed two more times in 0.1 m NaCl. The sediment was analyzed by immunoelectron microscopy with α-BcpA antisera and 10 nm gold anti-rabbit IgG conjugate as previously reported with additional wash steps between secondary antibody labeling and fixation with glutaraldehyde (6Budzik J.M. Marraffini L.A. Schneewind O. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 66: 495-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). For immunoblotting experiments, cells were extracted for 10 min by boiling with 500 μl of 6 m urea, 1% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.5, releasing the cytoplasm and membrane fractions (25Maresso A.W. Chapa T.J. Schneewind O. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 8145-8152Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Bacterial samples were washed in water, extracted with 5% trichloroacetic acid, and peptidoglycan-digested with mutanolysin (6Budzik J.M. Marraffini L.A. Schneewind O. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 66: 495-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Sortase A was detected by immunoblotting of extracts of bacilli that had been concentrated by precipitation with 8% trichloroacetic acid. Purification of Cell Wall-anchored Pilin—B. anthracis strain Sterne F32 harboring pJB169 was grown for 20 h at 30 °C in 6 liters of LB broth containing 10 μg/ml kanamycin and 1 mm IPTG. For mutanolysin treatment, cells were washed with 100 ml of double distilled water (ddH2O) and extracted by boiling with 100 ml of 6 m urea, 1% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.5. Murein sacculi were washed in ddH2O, extracted by boiling in 5% trichloroacetic acid, washed in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.3)-1.5 mm MgCl2, and peptidoglycan-digested with 20,000 units of mutanolysin (23Marraffini L.A. Schneewind O. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 6425-6436Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). For PlyL digestion, sedimented bacilli were washed once in 100 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and suspended in 50 ml of the same buffer supplemented with 5 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (26Marraffini L.A. Schneewind O. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16263-16271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Cell walls were broken in a bead beater instrument (Biospec Products Inc.) by 10 pulses of 1 min, followed by 5 min of incubation on ice. The crude lysate was decanted to remove the glass beads and centrifuged at 33,000 × g for 15 min to sediment cell wall sacculi and membranes. Sediment was treated with 1% Triton X-100, 100 mm phosphate (pH 7.5), and 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and peptidoglycan was then treated with PlyL as described previously (23Marraffini L.A. Schneewind O. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 6425-6436Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Following cell wall digestion, insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 33,000 × g. The pH of the samples was adjusted to 7.5 with 2 m sodium phosphate dibasic, and BcpAMH6 was purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography (26Marraffini L.A. Schneewind O. J. Biol.

Anchor peptides were purified by a second round of Ni-NTA affinity chromatography under denaturing conditions and separated by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) with uv detection using a C18 column with a linear gradient from 1% to 99% acetonitrile (CH3CN) in 0.1% formic acid in 100 min, as previously reported for BcpA pilin peptides (4Budzik J.M. Marraffini L.A. Souda P. Whitelegge J.P. Faull K.F. Schneewind O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 10215-10220Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). MALDI-MS—Aliquots of RP-HPLC fractions (0.5 μl) were co-spotted with matrix (0.5 μl of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid) prepared at 10 mg/ml in CH3CN-water-trifluoroacetic acid (30:40:0.1), 4 mm (NH4)2HPO4. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) spectra were obtained in a reflectron time-of-flight instrument (ABI Biosystems MALDI 4700) in reflectron mode. Spectra were acquired using external calibration with bovine insulin. Theoretical parent ion and fragmentation ion monoisotopic m/z values were produced with ProteinProspector version 4.27.2 MS-Product web-based program (University of California-San Francisco, prospector.ucsf.edu). Edman Degradation—RP-HPLC samples of anchor peptides were dried under vacuum and submitted for Edman sequencing at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Biotechnology Center Protein Sciences Facility. Substrate Properties Control the Fate of Pilin Precursors—Previous work demonstrated that sortase A and sortase D both cleave the major pilin protein precursor BcpA, but left unresolved the substrate requirements of these enzymes. To address this, we used pJB69, encoding bcpA-gst srtD, and transformed this plasmid into B. anthracis Sterne (expressing sortase A) or its isogenic srtA variant (Fig. 1A). Processing of BcpA-GST was monitored by separating whole bacterial extracts on SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with antibodies specific for GST (Fig. 1B). Bacilli expressing both enzymes (A and D) or only sortase D both cut BcpA-GST precursor between the threonine and the glycine of its LPVTG sorting signal and generated GST cleavage products (Fig. 1B). Bacilli lacking sortase A and D cannot cleave this hybrid substrate (4Budzik J.M. Marraffini L.A. Souda P. Whitelegge J.P. Faull K.F. Schneewind O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 10215-10220Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In the presence of sortase D, BcpA is polymerized into pili, whereas sortase A is thought to immobilize pili in the cell wall envelope (4Budzik J.M. Marraffini L.A. Souda P. Whitelegge J.P. Faull K.F. Schneewind O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 10215-10220Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Pilus assembly requires the YPKN pilin motif and CNA B domain of BcpA (4Budzik J.M. Marraffini L.A. Souda P. Whitelegge J.P. Faull K.F. Schneewind O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 10215-10220Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). It is not known, however, whether these elements are also required for substrate recognition, defined here as sortase cleavage of the pilin sorting signal (SS). To test this, we generated plasmid pSY8, encoding isdX1SS-gst srtD. Under physiological conditions, bacilli secrete IsdX1 via its N-terminal signal peptide into the extracellular medium, where the soluble protein binds hemoglobin and scavenges heme with its NEAT domain (27Maresso A.W. Garufi G. Schneewind O. PLoS Pathogens. 2008; 4: e1000132Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Fusion of IsdX1 to the sorting signal of BcpA (SS) and GST generated a hybrid that was cleaved by bacilli expressing both sortase D and sortase A, or only one of these enzymes, but not by bacilli that lacked sortase A and D (Fig. 1, A and B). To verify that the active site cysteine of sortase D is involved in substrate cleavage, we generated an alanine substitution mutant (DC207A). Although sortase DC207A was expressed at the same level as the wild-type enzyme, the mutant was unable to cleave IsdX1SS-GST substrate (Fig. 1, B and C). Of note, expression of sortase DC207A in wild-type bacilli appeared to reduce the ability of sortase A to cleave IsdX1SS-GST, suggesting that the mutant sortase may interact with the substrate in a manner that interferes with its recognition by the other sortase (Fig. 1, B and C). As a control, expression of sortase DC207A did not affect the abundance of sortase A in bacilli (Fig. 1B). Sortase A, but not sortase D, cleavage of IsdX1SS-GST led to the deposition of IsdX1 in the cell wall envelope of bacilli (Fig. 1C). Together these findings support a model, whereby sortase A acyl intermediates can only be resolved by the nucleophilic attack of lipid II, whereas sortase D intermediates must be resolved by the nucleophilic attack of BcpA unless hydrolysis at the active site thioester precipitates release of product into the extracellular medium (21Oh S.-Y. Budzik J.M. Schneewind O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 13703-13704Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Finally, the pilin sorting signal alone is sufficient for sortase A cleavage of BcpA at the LPVTG motif and, following completion of the transpeptidation reaction, for transfer of the cleaved product into the cell wall envelope. Purification of Anchored Pilin from the Cell Wall Envelope of Bacilli—B. anthracis was transformed with pJB12, a plasmid that encodes bcpA-srtD-bcpB under control of the IPTG-inducible Pspac promoter (6Budzik J.M. Marraffini L.A. Schneewind O. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 66: 495-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). In the presence of sortase A and D, BcpA was assembled into cell wall-anchored pili as demonstrated by immunogold-electron microscopy (Fig. 2C). Pilus formation was also confirmed by immunoblotting of covalently cross-linked high molecular weight polymers in the stack of SDS-PAGE that had been released from murein sacculi by treatment with mutanolysin (Fig. 2B). In the absence of sortase D (pJB173), sortase A deposited BcpA into the cell wall envelope (Fig. 2B). Sortase A did not form pili from BcpA and instead caused the near uniform distribution of anchored product in the cell wall envelope of bacilli (Fig. 2C). In the absence of both sortase A and sortase D, BcpA was not found in the envelope of bacilli, similar to a B. anthracis control harboring the empty vector plasmid pLM5 (Fig. 2C). To analyze the cell wall anchor structure of BcpA, we engineered BcpAMH6 with an insertion of methionyl-six histidyl (MH6) upstream of the LPVTG motif sorting signal of BcpA (Fig. 2A). Cell wall-anchored BcpAMH6 was detected in mutanolysin extracts of B. anthracis (pJB169) by immunoblot with antibodies specific for BcpA (α-BcpA) or staining with His-HRP (Fig. 2B). Electron microscopy and immunogold labeling with BcpA-specific antibodies revealed gold particle deposition on the surface of bacilli expressing BcpAMH6 (pJB169), but not for B. anthracis harboring the empty vector (pLM5) control (Fig. 2C). In the absence of srtA, BcpA- and BcpAMH6-specific gold conjugate deposits were not detected in the envelope of bacilli (Fig. 2C). As BcpAMH6 is anchored to the cell wall of bacilli in a manner similar to BcpA, we employed this reporter to examine the anchoring of pilin protein to the peptidoglycan. BcpAMH6 was solubilized from purified cell wall of B. anthracis (pJB169) with two different murein hydrolases and released protein was subjected to affinity chromatography on Ni-NTA. PlyL amidase cleaves the amide bond between MurNAc and l-Ala (24Low L.Y. Yang C. Perego M. Osterman A. Liddington R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 35433-35439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A). In agreement with the C-terminal cell wall anchor structures proposed in Fig. 3A, PlyL-solubilized BcpAMH6 migrated as a spectrum of fragments on Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE (49-79 kDa), as ∼19% of wall peptides in B. anthracis peptidoglycan are cross-linked (28Severin A. Tabei K. Tomasz A. Microb. Drug Resist. 2004; 10: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar)(Fig. 3B). Purified peptidoglycan of B. anthracis was also digested with mutanolysin, a muramidase that cleaves the repeating disaccharides MurNAc-GlcNAc or MurNAc-GlcNH2 (Fig. 3A) (29Calandra G.B. Cole R. Infect. Immun. 1980; 28: 1033-1037Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Yokogawa K. Kawata S. Nishimura S. Ikeda Y. Yoshimura Y. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1974; 6: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Muramidase treatment released protein that also migrated as a spectrum fragments on SDS-PAGE (49-79 kDa), albeit that the mobility of these species differed from those of PlyL-solubilized BcpAMH6 (Fig. 3B). Cell Wall Anchor Structure of PlyL-solubilized BcpAMH6—PlyL-solubilized and Ni-NTA-purified BcpAMH6 was cleaved at methionyl residues with CNBr. C-terminal peptides harboring the six-histidyl tag and cell wall anchor structure were purified by a second round of affinity purification on Ni-NTA. Peptides were separated by RP-HPLC with a C18 column. PlyL-released anchor peptides eluted at 35% CH3CN-0.1% formic acid and were analyzed by MALDI-MS and Edman degradation (Fig. 3C and Table 2, and see Table 5). The predominant ions in this spectrum could be explained as BcpAMH6 C-terminal anchor peptides linked to the side-chain amino group of diaminopimelic acid of wall peptides (Table 2). meso-Diaminopimelic acid (m-Dap) is a diamino acid at position 3 of the Bacillus cell wall pentapeptide precursor (l-Ala-d-iGln-m-Dap-d-Ala-d-Ala), and its side-chain amino group is involved in peptidoglycan cross-linking by forming an amide bond with d-Ala at position four of neighboring wall peptides [l-Ala-d-iGln-(l-Ala-d-iGln-m-Dap-d-Ala-)m-Dap-d-Ala-d-Ala] (28Severin A. Tabei K. Tomasz A. Microb. Drug Resist. 2004; 10: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The predicted m/z of the anchor peptide [l-Ala-d-iGln-(H6GWILPVT-)m-Dap] is 1978.99. Isoforms containing tryptophan oxidation products hydroxytryptophan or N-formylkynurenine are expected at a mass of 1994.98 and 2010.98, respectively (Table 2) (31Taylor S.W. Fahy E. Murray J. Capaldi R.A. Ghosh S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19587-19590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Formylated, diformylated, and carbamylated anchor peptide species were detected at m/z 2021.9, 2022.8, 2037.9, 2038.88, 2050.89, and 2053.89 (Table 2). Formylation and carbamylation of α-NH2 groups in cell wall anchor peptides are known to occur following CNBr cleavage (70% formic acid) and purification under denaturing conditions in urea buffer. The predominant ion at m/z 1994.89 was fragmented by collision-activated dissociation (CAD) (Fig. 3D). Table 3 summarizes the observed fragment ions and their structural interpretation, which is in agreement with the peptide structure l-Ala-d-iGln-(H6GWILPVT-)m-Dap harboring the tryptophan oxidation product hydroxytryptophan (Table 3 and Fig. 3D). The second most abundant ion at m/z 2065.93 was explained as l-Ala-d-iGln-(H6GWILPVT-)m-Dap-d-Ala, a C-terminal anchor peptide containing d-Ala at position 4 of the cell wall pentapeptide precursor (calculated m/z 2066.02) (Table 2 and Fig. 3D). The structure of ion 2065.93 m/z was also confirmed by tandem mass spectrometry (data not shown).TABLE 2Summary of ions observed in the mass spectrum of PlyL-released BcpAMH6 anchor peptidesm/zΔcalc-obsaThe difference between the calculated and observed ion masses.Proposed structureModificationbModification of αNH2 groups: formylation, HC(O)-, carbamylation, NH2-C(O)-; modification of tryptophan: hydroxytryptophan (HTRP), N-formylkynurenine (NFK).ObservedCalculated1979.881978.99−0.89[l-Ala-d-iGln-(HHHHHHGWILPVT-)m-Dap]none1994.891994.980.09[l-Ala-d-iGln-(HHHHHHGWILPVT-)m-Dap]HTRP2010.902010.980.08[l-Ala-d-iGln-(HHHHHHGWILPVT-)m-Dap]NFK2021.902022.000.10[l-Ala-d-iGln-(HHHHHHGWILPVT-)m-Dap]NH2-C(0)-2022.802022.980.18[l-Ala-d-iGln-(HHHHHHGWILPVT-)m-Dap]HTRP; HC(O)-2037.902037.990.09[l-Ala-d-iGln-(HHHHHHGWILPVT-)m-Dap]HTRP; NH2-C(O)-2038.882038.970.09[l-Ala-d-iGln-(HHHHHHGWILPVT-)m-Dap]NFK; HC(O)-2050.892050.990.10[l-Ala-d-iGln-(HHHHHHGWILPVT-)m-Dap]HTRP; 2 X HC(O)-2053.892053.990.10[l-Ala-d-iGln-(HHHHHHGWILPVT-)m-Dap]NFK; NH2-C(O)-2065.932066.020.09[l-Ala-d-iGln-(HHHHHHGWILPVT-)m-Dap-d-Ala]HTRP2081.922082.020.10[l-Ala-d-iGln-(HHHHHHGWILPVT-)m-Dap-d-Ala]NFK2093.922094.020.10[l-Ala-d-iGln-(HHHHHHGWILPVT-)m-Dap-d-Ala]HTRP; HC(O)-2108.932109.030.10[l-Ala-d-iGln-(HHHHHHGWILPVT-)m-Dap-d-Ala]HTRP; NH2-C(O)-2122.932122.030.10[l-Ala-d-iGln-(HHHHHHGWILPVT-)m-Dap-d-Ala]HTRP; 2 × HC(O)-2124.952125.020.07[l-Ala-d-iGln-(HHHHHHGWILPVT-)m-Dap-d-Ala]NFK; NH2-C(O)-2437.082437.200.12l-Ala-d-iGln-[l-Ala-d-iGln(HHHHHHGWIPLVT -)m-Dap-d-Ala]m-DapHTRP2465.092465.200.11l-Ala-d-iGln-[l-Ala-d-iGln(HHHHHHGWIPLVT -)m-Dap-d-Ala]m-DapHTRP; HC(O)-2480.082480.210.13l-Ala-d-iGln-[l-Ala-d-iGln(HHHHHHGWIPLVT -)m-Dap-d-Ala]m-DapHTRP; NH2-C(O)-2493.072493.210.14l-Ala-d-iGln-[l-Ala-d-iGln(HHHHHHGWIPLVT -)m-Dap-d-Ala]m-DapHTRP; 2 × HC(O)-a The differenc"
https://openalex.org/W1986187491,"Binding of oleate to S-nitrosylated human serum albumin (SNO-HSA) enhances its cytoprotective effect on liver cells in a rat ischemia/reperfusion model. It enhances the antiapoptotic effect of SNO-HSA on HepG2 cells exposed to anti-Fas antibody. To identify some of the reasons for the increased cytoprotective effects, additional experiments were performed with glutathione and HepG2 cells. As indicated by 5,5′-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid binding, the addition of oleate increased the accessibility of the single thiol group of albumin. Binding of increasing amounts of oleate resulted in increasing and more rapid S-transnitrosation of glutathione. Likewise, binding of oleate, or of a mixture of endogenous fatty acids, improved S-denitrosation of SNO-HSA by HepG2 cells. Oleate also enhanced S-transnitrosation by HepG2 cells, as detected by intracellular fluorescence of diaminofluorescein-FM. All of the S-transnitrosation caused by oleate binding was blocked by filipin III. Oleate also increased, in a dose-dependent manner, the binding of SNO-HSA labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate to the surface of the hepatocytes. A model in two parts was worked out for S-transnitrosation, which does not involve low molecular weight thiols. Fatty acid binding facilitates S-denitrosation of SNO-HSA, increases its binding to HepG2 cells and greatly increases S-transnitrosation by hepatocytes in a way that is sensitive to filipin III. A small nitric oxide transfer takes place in a slow system, which is unaffected by fatty acid binding to SNO-HSA and not influenced by filipin III. Thus, fatty acids could be a novel type of mediator for S-transnitrosation.

S-Nitrosothiols may serve as a reservoir of NO in biological systems, and they represent a class of NO donor with many potential biological and clinical uses. In this respect, Cys-34 of human serum albumin (HSA) 2The abbreviations used are: HSA, human serum albumin; SNO-HSA, S-nitrosylated HSA; GS-NO, S-nitrosylated GSH; OA, oleic acid/oleate; ALT, alanine aminotransferase; AST, asparatate aminotransferase; DAF-FM DA, diaminofluorescein-FM diacetate; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; DTT, 1,4-dithiothreitol; DTNB, 5,5′-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid; DTPA, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid; IAN, isoamyl nitrite; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium.2The abbreviations used are: HSA, human serum albumin; SNO-HSA, S-nitrosylated HSA; GS-NO, S-nitrosylated GSH; OA, oleic acid/oleate; ALT, alanine aminotransferase; AST, asparatate aminotransferase; DAF-FM DA, diaminofluorescein-FM diacetate; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; DTT, 1,4-dithiothreitol; DTNB, 5,5′-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid; DTPA, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid; IAN, isoamyl nitrite; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. is important, because it represents the largest fraction of free thiols in circulation (1.Peters Jr., T. All About Albumin: Biochemistry, Genetics, and Medical Applications. Academic Press, San Diego1996Google Scholar). In accordance with this proposal, S-nitrosylated HSA (SNO-HSA) has been reported to improve systolic and diastolic function, as well as myocardial perfusion and oxygen metabolism, in pigs during reperfusion after severe myocardial ischemia (2.Dworschak M.

Akaike T. Otagiri M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2007; 320: 969-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Among its other beneficial effects, SNO-HSA inhibits the activation of circulating platelets (6.Crane M.S. Ollosson R. Moore K.P. Rossi A.G. Megson I.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46858-46863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), suppresses apoptosis of human promonocytic cells (5.Ishima Y. Sawa T. Kragh-Hansen U. Miyamoto Y.

Kragh-Hansen U. Miyamoto Y. Matsushita S. Akaike T. Otagiri M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2007; 320: 969-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). HSA is a multifunctional protein synthesized and secreted by liver cells. It is a single, non-glycosylated polypeptide that organizes to form a heart-shaped protein with ∼67% α-helix but no β-sheet (1.Peters Jr., T. All About Albumin: Biochemistry, Genetics, and Medical Applications. Academic Press, San Diego1996Google Scholar). All but one (Cys-34) of the 35 cysteine residues are involved in the formation of stabilizing disulfide bonds. In circulation, approximately half of HSA contains Cys-34 as a free sulfhydryl, whereas the remainder is oxidized or ligand-bound. In addition to forming S-nitrosothiols, HSA can interact reversibly with a large number of endogenous and exogenous ligands (1.Peters Jr., T. All About Albumin: Biochemistry, Genetics, and Medical Applications. Academic Press, San Diego1996Google Scholar, 7.Kragh-Hansen U. Pharmacol. Rev. 1981; 33: 17-53PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Kragh-Hansen U. Chuang V.T.G. Otagiri M. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 2002; 25: 695-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). Thus, one of the important in vivo functions of albumin is to transport fatty acids, and usually the protein carries different fatty acid anions, up to a total amount of 1–2 molar equivalents. However, this value can rise to about 4 after maximal exercise or other adrenergic stimulation (1.Peters Jr., T. All About Albumin: Biochemistry, Genetics, and Medical Applications. Academic Press, San Diego1996Google Scholar). In the present work, the effect of oleate (OA) on S-transnitrosation from SNO-HSA was studied. OA was used as a representative for the endogenous fatty acids, because quantitatively it is the most important fatty acid in human depot fat, and because it is a major contributor to the albumin-bound fatty acids. First, it was observed that co-binding of OA improved SNO-HSA-mediated cytoprotection against ischemia/reperfusion liver injury in rats and improved its antiapoptotic effect on human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells exposed to anti-Fas antibody. In an attempt to explain these effects, S-transnitrosation was then investigated in simpler systems, namely from SNO-HSA to glutathione (GSH) and to HepG2 cells. The effect of a mixture of endogenous fatty acids on the latter S-transnitrosation was also studied. The influence of OA binding on NO transfer to the HepG2 cells and on the interaction between SNO-HSA and the hepatocytes was examined. Finally, a model for the OA-induced improvement of NO transfer to HepG2 cells is proposed. Materials—Non-defatted HSA (96% pure) was donated by the Chemo-Sera-Therapeutic Research Institute (Kumamoto, Japan), and it was defatted by treatment with charcoal as described by Chen (9.Chen R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 173-181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sephadex G-25 (ϕ 1.6 × 2.5 cm) and Blue Sepharose CL-6B (ϕ 2.5 × 20 cm) were from GE Healthcare (Tokyo, Japan). OA, caprylate, stearate, GSH, 1,4-dithiothreitol (DTT), and filipin III were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Isoamyl nitrite (IAN) was purchased from Wako Chemicals (Osaka, Japan). Sulfanilamide, naphthylethylenediamine-hydrochloride, HgCl2, and NaNO2 were obtained from Nakalai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan). Diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA), 5,5′-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid (DTNB), and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) were bought from Dojindo Laboratories (Kumamoto, Japan). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) was from Invitrogen (Rockville, MD), and diaminofluorescein-FM diacetate (DAF-FM DA) was from Daiichi Pure Chemicals (Tokyo, Japan). 111InCl3 (74 MBq/ml in 0.02 n HCl) was a gift from Nihon Medi-Physics Co., Ltd. (Hyogo, Japan). The other chemicals were of the best grades commercially available, and all solutions were made in deionized and distilled water. S-Nitrosylation of HSA—S-Nitrosylated protein was prepared with protection against light and according to previously reported methods (10.Akaike T. Inoue K. Okamoto T. Nishino H. Otagiri M. Fujii S. Maeda H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 122: 459-466Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Ikebe N. Akaike T. Miyamoto Y. Hayashida K. Yoshitake J. Ogawa M. Maeda H. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 295: 904-911PubMed Google Scholar). First, HSA (300 μm) was incubated with DTT (molar ratio, protein:DTT = 1:10) for 5 min at 37 °C. After incubation, DTT was immediately removed by Sephadex G-25 gel filtration and eluted with 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.5 mm DTPA. Samples of 0.1 mm DTT-treated protein (0.8 mol sulfhydryl groups/mol protein) were then incubated with IAN (molar ratio, protein:IAN = 1:10) in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.5 mm DTPA for 60 min at 37 °C. The amount of the S-nitroso moiety of SNO-HSA was quantified by HPLC coupled with a flow-reactor system, as previously reported (10.Akaike T. Inoue K. Okamoto T. Nishino H. Otagiri M. Fujii S. Maeda H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 122: 459-466Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The HPLC column was a gel filtration column for S-nitrosylated proteins (ϕ 8 × 300 mm), Diol-120, YMC, Kyoto, Japan. Briefly, the eluate from the HPLC column was mixed with a HgCl2 solution to decompose S-nitrosylated compounds to yield NO2- (via NO+). The NO2- generated was then detected after reaction with Griess reagent in the flow-reactor system. Controls performed in the absence of HgCl2 gave no protein-derived absorbency at 540 nm after reaction with the Griess reagent. Therefore, non-covalent association of the nitrite anion with albumin can be excluded. The S-nitrosylated product (0.35 ± 0.04 mol SNO-groups/mol protein; mean ± S.E., n = 53) was purified by Sephadex G-25 gel filtration, eluted with 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.5 mm DTPA, and concentrated by ultrafiltration (cutoff size of 7500 Da). These samples were stored at -80 °C until use. The protein content of all protein preparations used in this study was determined using the Bradford assay. Binding of Fatty Acid to HSA—A stock solution of 20 mm OA was made in methanol-H2O (1:1, v/v). Aliquots of the OA stock solution were added to HSA or SNO-HSA and dissolved in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) to give OA:HSA molar ratios of 1, 3, or 5; the maximal methanol concentration in the final solutions was 1.25%. Before use, the solutions were held at 37 °C for 30 min. The amount of bound OA was checked using the following approach. The solutions containing albumin and OA were applied to a Sephadex G-25 gel filtration column, the protein-containing fractions were pooled, and both the protein and OA concentrations in the pooled material were determined. The OA concentrations were determined by a colorimetric method using a commercial kit (WAKO NEFA kit) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Three standards (0.5, 1.0, and 1.97 mEq/liter) supplied by the vendor were used to establish a standard curve for determination of the concentration of OA. Cytoprotective Effect of SNO-HSAs in Vivo—A rat ischemia/reperfusion liver injury model was used to investigate the cytoprotective effect of SNO-HSA, as previously reported (5.Ishima Y. Sawa T. Kragh-Hansen U. Miyamoto Y. Matsushita S. Akaike T. Otagiri M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2007; 320: 969-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 11.Ikebe N. Akaike T. Miyamoto Y. Hayashida K. Yoshitake J. Ogawa M. Maeda H. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 295: 904-911PubMed Google Scholar). Male Wistar rats weighing between 200 and 230 g (Kyudo, Inc., Kumamoto, Japan) were used. The animals were fasted for 9 h before surgery, but were allowed access to water. The rats were anesthetized with ether during the operation. After the abdomen was shaved and disinfected with 70% ethanol, a complete midline incision was made. The portal vein and hepatic artery were exposed and cross-clamped for 30 min with a noncrushing microvascular clip. Saline, as the vehicle control, or HSA or SNO-HSA (0.1 μmol/rat) with or without bound OA was given via the portal vein immediately after reperfusion was initiated. Because the blood volume of a 200-g rat was estimated to be about 10 ml, we expected blood levels of SNO-HSA to reach ∼3 μm after administration of 0.1 μmol/rat of SNO-HSA. This concentration of SNO-HSA is a physiologically relevant one, because levels of S-nitrosothiols in normal plasma are at the most 7 μm (12.Wang X. Tanus-Santos J.E. Reiter C.D. Dejam A. Shiva S. Smith R.D. Hogg N. Gladwin M.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11477-11482Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The abdomen was then closed in two layers with 2–0 silk. The rats were kept under warming lamps until they awakened and became active. Because blood loss caused by frequent blood sampling could affect liver function, the animals were euthanized by taking whole circulating blood via the abdominal aorta under anesthesia at various time points after reperfusion was initiated. Plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activities were measured by using a sequential multiple AutoAnalyzer system from Wako Chemicals, with activities expressed in international units per liter. All the animal experiments were carried out according to the guidelines of the Laboratory Protocol of Animal Handling, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kumamoto University. Antiapoptotic Effect of SNO-HSA in Vitro—HepG2 cells (2 × 105 cells/well) were cultured in 96-well plates (16-mm diameter; Falcon, Lincoln Park, NJ) with DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). The cells were maintained in a humidified incubator (95% air, 5% CO2) for 12 h at pH 7.4 and 37 °C. Afterwards, they were treated with different concentrations of HSA or SNO-HSA, with and without bound OA, for 6 h in the dark. The cells were then washed three times with 10 mm phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) to remove the remaining SNO-HSA. After washing, the cells were reacted with 400 ng/ml anti-Fas antibody (Medical and Biological Laboratories, Nagoya, Japan). After 15 h of incubation, the cultures were treated with 0.05% trypsin, and the cells were transferred to Eppendorf tubes (1.5 ml). The number of apoptotic cells was determined by an annexin V-FITC binding assay kit from BD Biosciences (Tokyo, Japan). The fluorescence of annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide were measured by a FACSCalibur flow cytometer. Pharmacokinetic Experiments—SNO-HSA, with and without OA, was labeled with 111In, using DTPA anhydride as a bifunctional chelating agent (13.Hnatowich D.J. Layne W.W. Childs R.L. Int. J. Appl. Radiat. Isot. 1982; 33: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 14.Yamasaki Y. Sumimoto K. Nishikawa M. Yamashita F. Yamaoka K. Hashida M. Takakura Y. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 301: 467-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Labeled proteins were injected via the tail vein into male ddY mice (weighing 25–27 g) at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg. At appropriate times after injection, blood was collected from the vena cava with the mouse under ether anesthesia. Heparin sulfate was used as an anticoagulant, and plasma was obtained from the blood by centrifugation. Liver, kidney, and spleen samples were obtained, rinsed with saline, and weighed. The radioactivity in each sample was counted using a well-type NaI scintillation counter ARC-2000 (Aloka, Tokyo, Japan). 111In radioactivity concentrations in plasma were normalized as a percentage of the dose per milliliter and analyzed using the nonlinear least-squares program MULTI (15.Yamaoka K. Tanigawara Y. Nakagawa T. Uno T. J. Pharmacobiodyn. 1981; 4: 879-885Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Organ distribution profiles were evaluated by relating the radioactivity per gram of tissue to the total amount of injected radioactivity. Accessibility of Cys-34—We determined the accessibility of Cys-34 in reduced HSA with Ellman's reagent, DTNB (16.Gryzunov Y.A. Arroyo A. Vigne J.L. Zhao Q. Tyurin V.A. Hubel C.A. Gandley R.E.

Kai T. Otagiri M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 364: 790-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). HSA (300 μm), with and without OA, and DTNB (5 mm) were mixed in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) at 20 °C, and the absorbance at 450 nm was registered as a function of time. S-Denitrosylation of SNO-HSA by GSH and by HepG2 Cells—Solutions with both 100 μm SNO-HSA and 100 μm GSH were made in 10 mm phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4. Then 0-, 7.5-, 15-, and 30-min samples were taken, mixed with 1/10 volume of 5 mm DTPA (pH 7.4) and placed at -80 °C. The concentrations of the remaining SNO-HSA and the S-nitrosylated GSH (GS-NO) formed were then determined separately by the HPLC flow reactor system. HepG2 cells (5 × 105 cells/well) were cultured and incubated with DMEM and fetal bovine serum, as described above. After incubation, the culture medium was removed, and the hepatocytes were washed three times with 10 mm phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4. Cells were further incubated at 37 °C in the CO2 incubator with 200 μl of 10 mm phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4 and 100 μm SNO-HSA with different molar ratios of bound OA. Samples were taken after incubation for 0, 15, 30, or 60 min, mixed with 1/10 volume of 5 mm DTPA, pH 7.4 and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. These supernatants were stored at -80 °C until applied to the HPLC flow reactor system. HSA Obtained from Hemodialysis Patients—It is known that fatty acids bound to HSA rise by dialysis. The content of fatty acids bound to HSA isolated from hemodialysis patients before and after dialysis was analyzed, and the influence on S-denitrosation of fatty acid binding was examined. HSA samples were obtained from hemodialysis patients before (HSA-hd (-)) and after dialysis (HSA-hd (+)) according to a previously reported protocol (18.Watanabe H. Yamasaki K. Kragh-Hansen U. Tanase S. Harada K. Suenaga A. Otagiri M. Pharm. Res. 2001; 18: 1775-1781Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In brief, albumin concentrations in blood plasma were measured using a diagnostic kit (Biotech Reagent) based on the bromcresol green method. Non-esterified fatty acids were measured using a diagnostic kit from Wako Chemicals (Osaka, Japan). To isolate HSA from patient sera, polyethylene glycol fractionation of blood plasma was followed by chromatography on a Blue Sepharose CL-6B column. After isolation, the samples were dialyzed against deionized water for 48 h at 4 °C, followed by lyophilization. The purity of the HSA-hd samples was at least 95%, and the percentage of dimers did not exceed 7%, as evidenced by SDS-PAGE and native PAGE, respectively. The protocol used in this study was approved by the Institutional Review Board, and informed consent was obtained from all subjects. Preparation of S-Nitrosylated HSA-hd—HSA-hd (-) or HSA-hd (+) was S-nitrosylated using IAN, as described above. The content of SNO groups in SNO-HSA-hd was determined to be (0.35 ± 0.04 for HSA-hd (-) or 0.39 ± 0.06 for HSA-hd (+) mol SNO-groups/mol protein; mean ± S.E., n = 7). S-Denitrosylation of Hemodialysis Patient SNO-HSA by HepG2 Cells: Effects of HSA-bound Fatty Acids—One-hundred micromolar of SNO-HSA-hd (-) and SNO-HSA-hd (+) dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline was incubated with HepG2 cells (5 × 105 cells/well). After 15-, 30-, and 60-min incubation, culture supernatant was collected, and the remaining SNO content was measured and compared with control SNO-HSA samples before incubation. NO Uptake by HepG2 Cells—HepG2 cells (5 × 105 cells/well) were cultured and incubated with DMEM and fetal bovine serum, as described above. After incubation, the culture medium was removed, and the hepatocytes were washed three times with 10 mm phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4. After adding phosphate-buffered saline containing 5 μm DAF-FM DA, the cells were incubated for 1 h in the dark at 37 °C. The cells were again washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and further incubated at 37 °C with 100 μm HSA or SNO-HSA with different molar ratios of bound OA. Upon cellular uptake, ester groups in DAF-FM DA are cleaved by esterases, resulting in the formation of DAF-FM that can react with NO to give fluorescence. The fluorescence was determined with excitation at 385 nm and monitored at 535 nm using a monochromator (TECAN SPECTRA FLUOR). In some experiments, 50 μm filipin III (caveolae formation inhibitor) dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline was added after 30 min of DAF-FM DA exposure (19.Pohl J. Ring A. Stremmel W. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 1390-1399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Binding of FITC-HSA to HepG2 Cells—The binding of HSA to HepG2 cells, with or without S-nitrosylation and its modulation by fatty acid binding, was analyzed by means of fluorescent microscopy with HSA labeled with FITC. FITC-HSA was prepared according to a previous report (20.Maeda H. Ishida N. Kawauchi H. Tuzimura K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1969; 65: 777-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In short, HSA (60 μm) was incubated with FITC (2 mm) for 3 h at 25 °C in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). After incubation, FITC-HSA was isolated from unreacted FITC using a Sephadex G-25 gel with the phosphate buffer, and stored at -80 °C until use. To prepare FITC-SNO-HSA, HSA was first S-nitrosylated as described above, followed by FITC labeling. After purification of FITC-SNO-HSA, the SNO content was determined to be (0.33 ± 0.03 mol SNO-groups/mol protein; mean ± S.E., n = 3), suggesting that FITC labeling did not affect the SNO content to a significant extent. For the binding assay, HepG2 cells (5 × 105 cells/well) were preincubated with serum-free DMEM for 2 h at 37 °C. In some experiments, cells were further treated with 50 μm filipin III for 30 min, which inhibits caveolae formation. Cells were then maintained at 4 °C to block the uptake of macromolecules through energy-dependent mechanisms, including endocytosis. FITC-SNO-HSA with varying OA content (0, 3, 5 OA/HSA) was dissolved in 10 mm phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4 and added to the culture wells to give a final concentration of 50 μg/ml. After 10 min, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline to remove unbound FITC-SNO-HSA and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline at 25 °C for 30 min. After washing twice in MilliQ water, these cells were analyzed using a fluorescence microscope (Biozero-8000, Keyence, Osaka, Japan) with the combination of excitation at 385 nm and emission at 535 nm. Fluorescent intensity was quantified using an NIH Image. Similar experiments were conducted using FITC-HSA without S-nitrosylation. Statistical Analysis—The statistical significance of the collected data were evaluated using analysis of variance, followed by the Newman-Keuls method for more than 2 means. Data are expressed as means ± S.E. Differences between groups were evaluated using a Student's t test. p < 0.05 was regarded as statistically significant. Effect of OA Binding on SNO-HSA-mediated Cytoprotection against Ischemia/Reperfusion Liver Injury in Rats—An ischemia/reperfusion liver injury model (5.Ishima Y. Sawa T. Kragh-Hansen U. Miyamoto Y. Matsushita S. Akaike T. Otagiri M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2007; 320: 969-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) was used to examine the in vivo effect of OA binding on SNO-HSA-mediated cytoprotection. Because previous studies with SNO-HSA showed that a quantity of 0.1 μmol/rat had the greatest protective effect (5.Ishima Y. Sawa T. Kragh-Hansen U. Miyamoto Y. Matsushita S. Akaike T. Otagiri M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2007; 320: 969-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), the same quantity was used in this study. To evaluate liver injury, the extracellular release of the liver enzymes AST and ALT was measured via plasma enzyme values. Injecting HSA, OA, or HSA-OA into the portal vein immediately after reperfusion was initiated did not affect the plasma concentrations of AST and ALT (data not shown). However, administration of SNO-HSA diminished, to a significant extent, the enzyme concentrations measured after 60 and 120 min (Fig. 1). The protection of the liver cells by SNO-HSA was more pronounced if the protein also carried OA; the additive effect was most evident after 120 min of reperfusion. The effect of OA on SNO-HSA-mediated cytoprotection appears to depend on OA content, e.g. AST release was reduced significantly more by treatment with SNO-HSA-OA5 than with SNO-HSA-OA3 120 min after reperfusion (Fig. 1A). Even at 12 h after reperfusion, the levels of AST and ALT remained significantly lower in SNO-HSA-OA-treated animals than in control animals, although the differences were not so pronounced as those observed at 120 min after reperfusion (data not shown). We also examined the effect of other fatty acid on cytoprotective effect for SNO-HSA. In the ischemia/reperfusion injury model, we found that caprylate (C8:0), a short-chain and saturated fatty acid, potentiated the cytoprotective effect of SNO-HSA. The potentiation effect of caprylate was slightly weaker than that of OA. AST levels at 120 min after reperfusion were 3256 ± 55, 2586 ± 105, 2202 ± 253 for treatment with SNO-HSA, SNO-HSA-caprylate (HSA: caprylate = 1:5), SNO-HSA-OA5, respectively (The values are means ± S.E., n = 4). Effect of OA Binding on SNO-HSA-mediated Cytoprotection of HepG2 Cells Exposed to Anti-Fas Antibody—NO and related species reportedly induce both antiapoptotic and proapoptotic responses in cells, the type of response depending on the concentration of the NO donors and on the type of cell and apoptosis-inducing reagent (5.Ishima Y. Sawa T. Kragh-Hansen U. Miyamoto Y. Matsushita S. Akaike T. Otagiri M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2007; 320: 969-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In the present study, the influence of OA binding on the antiapoptotic effect of SNO-HSA on HepG2 cells treated with anti-Fas antibody was examined. As seen in Fig. 2, the presence of HSA, with or without bound OA, had no effect on the induced apoptosis. OA alone possessed no antiapoptotic activity in our HepG2 cell study (data not shown). By contrast, the addition of SNO-HSA resulted in concentration-dependent protection of the cells. This protection was greatly increased by binding 5 mol of OA per mol of SNO-HSA. Thus, fatty acid binding can also improve the cytoprotective effect of SNO-HSA in an in vitro system. Pharmacokinetic Experiments—The pharmacokinetic characteristics of SNO-HSA with and without bound OA were determined in mice. The results in Fig. 3A indicate that OA binding did not affect the elimination of SNO-HSA from the circulation. The plasma half-lives were 269.3 ± 1.7 min, 270.6 ± 1.2 min, and 271.6 ± 5.5 min for SNO-HSA, SNO-HSA-OA3, and SNO-HSA-OA5, respectively. Likewise, the uptake of SNO-HSA by liver, kidney, and spleen was unaffected by OA binding (Fig. 3, B–D). These data suggest that binding of as much as 5 mol of OA per mol of protein does not modify the pharmacokinetic properties of SNO-HSA. Accessibility of Cys-34 in HSA-OA—Crystallographic studies have revealed the existence of seven OA binding sites in HSA, and showed that none of these sites involve Cys-34 (21.Petitpas I. Grune T. Bhattacharya A.A. Curry S. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 955-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4A). Cys-34"

We reported previously that rabbit ESC (rESC) are more similar to primate ESC than to mouse ESC. However, the signaling pathways that regulate rESC self-renewal had not been identified. Here we show that inhibition of the transforming growth factor β (TGFβ), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), and canonical Wnt/β-catenin (Wnt) pathways results in enhanced differentiation of rESC accompanied by down-regulation of Smad2/3 phosphorylation and β-catenin expression and up-regulation of phosphorylation of Smad1 and β-catenin. These results imply that the TGFβ, FGF, and Wnt pathways are required for rESC self-renewal. Inhibition of the MAPK/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways, which lie downstream of the FGF pathway, led to differentiation of rESC accompanied by down-regulation of phosphorylation of ERK1/2 or AKT, respectively. Long-term self-renewal of rESC could be achieved by adding a mixture of TGFβ ligands (activin A, Nodal, or TGFβ1) plus basic FGF (bFGF) and Noggin in the absence of serum and feeder cells. Our findings also suggest that there is a regulatory network consisting of the FGF, Wnt, and TGFβ pathways that controls rESC pluripotency and self-renewal. We conclude that bFGF controls the stem cell properties of rESC both directly and indirectly through TGFβ or other pathways, whereas the effect of Wnt on rESC might be mediated by the TGFβ pathway.

Because of their potential to provide a variety of tissues for use in regenerative medicine, there is great interest in studying the signaling pathways that regulate self-renewal of ESC. However, the signaling pathways that govern the unique properties of ESC remain largely unknown and exhibit some species differences.Previous studies demonstrated that transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) (1Goumans M.J. Mummery C. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 2000; 44: 253-265PubMed Google Scholar), fibroblast growth factor (FGF) (2Bottcher R.T. Niehrs C. Endocr.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3286-3305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2210) Google Scholar) signaling pathways play prominent roles in the early embryogenesis of vertebrates. These pathways, together with the leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)-signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (Stat3) and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) pathways (4Smith A.G. Heath J.K.

However, the precise functions and interactions of these pathways in regulating ESC are largely unknown. In mouse ESC (mESC), the LIF-Stat3 and BMP signaling pathways play essential roles in pluripotency maintenance (4Smith A.G. Heath J.K. Donaldson D.D. Wong G.G. Moreau J. Stahl M. Rogers D.

However, neither the addition of LIF to the culture medium (9Thomson J.A. Itskovitz-Eldor J. Shapiro S.S. Waknitz M.A. Swiergiel J.J. Marshall V.S. Jones J.M.

Addicks G.C. Glennon C. Zwaka T.P. Thomson J.A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 1261-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar), and the TGFβ pathway (another branch of the TGFβ superfamily, which contains two main branches, the BMP and TGFβ pathways), plays a key role in the maintenance of hESC pluripotency (14Amit M.

Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 4495-4509Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). The first indication of such a role emerged from the prevalence of TGFβ signaling pathway components in the transcriptome of hESC and their rapid disappearance upon differentiation (19Brandenberger R. Wei H. Zhang S. Lei S. Murage J. Fisk G.J. Li Y. Xu C. Fang R. Guegler K. Rao M.S. Mandalam R. Lebkowski J. Stanton L.W. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 707-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Moreover, exposing hESC to Nodal up-regulated pluripotent markers (20Vallier L. Reynolds D. Pedersen R.A. Dev. Biol. 2004; 275: 403-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar); TGFβ family members are also less potent than other growth factors in inducing differentiation (21Schuldiner M. Yanuka O.

However, the TGFβ pathway is only involved in the propagation of mESC without affecting their pluripotency (22Ogawa K. Saito A. Matsui H. Suzuki H. Ohtsuka S. Shimosato D. Morishita Y. Watabe T. Niwa H. Miyazono K. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 55-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). There is ample evidence of a role for basic FGF (bFGF) in hESC self-renewal; bFGF has been included in media to derive and maintain hESC lines, which suggests that the FGF pathway has an important function in regulating the pluripotency and self-renewal of hESC (21Schuldiner M.

Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/ERK and phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathways, both of which lie downstream of the FGF pathway, are important for maintenance of pluripotency and viability in hESC (2Bottcher R.T.

Differentiation. 2007; 75: 299-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). However, FGF stimulation of the ERK1/2 signaling cascade triggers the transition of mESC from self-renewal to lineage commitment (29Kunath T. Saba-El-Leil M.K. Almousailleakh M. Wray J. Meloche S. Smith A. Development (Camb.). 2007; 134: 2895-2902Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar), and self-renewal of mESC is enabled by the elimination of differentiation-inducing signaling from MAPK (30Ying Q.L. Wray J. Nichols J. Batlle-Morera L. Doble B. Woodgett J. Cohen P. Smith A. Nature. 2008; 453: 519-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (2487) Google Scholar). On the other hand, inhibition of PI3K/AKT pathway leads to a reduction in the ability of LIF to maintain self-renewal in mouse ESC through augmenting LIF-induced phosphorylation of ERK (31Paling N.R. Wheadon H. Bone H.K. Welham M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48063-48070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Wnt signaling was reported to be activated in undifferentiated human and mouse ESC (32Sato N. Meijer L. Skaltsounis L. Greengard P. Brivanlou A.H. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1714) Google Scholar), but Wnt activity alone is not sufficient to maintain pluripotency of hESC (16James D. Levine A.J. Besser D. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Development (Camb.). 2005; 132: 1273-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). The level of Wnt signaling is low in human ESC but increases during differentiation, and inhibiting Wnt signaling does not affect the self-renewal of hESC (33Dravid G. Ye Z. Hammond H. Chen G. Pyle A. Donovan P. Yu X. Cheng L. Stem Cells (Dayton). 2005; 23: 1489-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Although signaling pathways that sustain monkey ESC self-renewal have not yet been well defined, it appears that exogenous LIF or bFGF is absolutely required for rhesus (10Thomson J.A. Kalishman J.

These previous studies suggested that the LIF-Stat3, TGFβ, FGF, and Wnt pathways could be potential candidates for regulating ESC pluripotency and self-renewal but that there exist some species differences in the mechanisms regulating pluripotency maintenance of ESC.In our previous study, pluripotent rabbit ESC (rESC) lines were established from fertilized and parthenogenetic embryos. The rESC expressed all cell surface markers found in both mouse and primate ESC. rESC were more similar to primate ESC than mouse ESC in many ways, including morphological characteristics, LIF-independent self-renewal, and trophoblast differentiation capacity (36Wang S. Tang X. Niu Y. Chen H. Li B. Li T. Zhang X. Hu Z. Zhou Q. Ji W. Stem Cells (Dayton). 2007; 25: 481-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). However, the signaling pathways involved in the pluripotency and self-renewal of rESC are still largely unexplored. Here, we tackled this question by using activators and inhibitors of various signaling pathways and found that activation of the TGFβ, FGF (MAPK/ERK and PI3K/AKT), and Wnt pathways and inhibition of the BMP pathway are required for rESC self-renewal. Mixed media composed of ligands of TGFβ (TGFβ1, activin A, or Nodal) and bFGF plus a BMP antagonist were sufficient to sustain long-term culture of the rESC lines. Our findings also suggest that there is an interactive network among the FGF, Wnt, and TGFβ pathways that regulates rESC self-renewal.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCulture of rESC—Two rESC lines, RF and RP01, derived from a fertilized and a parthenogenic blastocyst, respectively, were cultured as described previously (36Wang S. Tang X. Niu Y. Chen H. Li B. Li T. Zhang X. Hu Z. Zhou Q. Ji W. Stem Cells (Dayton). 2007; 25: 481-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were cultured on mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) in ESC medium containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen Corp.) supplemented with 10! defined fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), 2 mm l-glutamine (Sigma-Aldrich), 1! non-essential amino acids (Invitrogen), and 0.1 mm β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma-Aldrich). The rESC from passages 30 to 40 (p30-p40) were used in this study.For receptor inhibition experiments, rESC were treated with 1 mg/ml dispase (Invitrogen) for 10 min to detach them from the feeder cells. The dislodged cell colonies were then dissociated into single cells by treatment with 0.25! trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich) in 0.04! EDTA (Sigma-Aldrich) solution (23Amit M. Carpenter M.K. Inokuma M.S.

The cell clumps were seeded onto Matrigel (Sigma-Aldrich)-coated plates (Nunc A/S, Roskilde, Denmark) in KSR medium containing knock-out Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 20! knock-out serum replacement, 0.1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1! nonessential amino acids, and 2 mm glutamine supplemented with activin A, Nodal, TGFβ1, BMP4, Wnt3a (all from R&D Systems), bFGF (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA), Noggin (Sigma-Aldrich), or various combinations of the above factors. The cells were split every 3-4 days.The differentiation potential of rESC from feeder- and serum-free culture systems was tested by in vitro embryoid body (EB) formation and in vivo teratoma formation assays. Dislodged rESC colonies were suspended in the ESC medium and cultured in hanging drops (30 μl/drop). Two days later, the formed EBs were transferred to Petri dishes (BD Biosciences) coated with agar (Sigma-Aldrich) to keep them in a continuous suspension culture for another 2 days. Then the EBs were plated onto gelatin (Sigma-Aldrich)-coated plates and continuously cultured in the ESC medium until being harvested for analysis of the differentiation markers. For teratoma formation, 6-8-week-old Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID)-beige mice (Charles River Laboratory) were injected intramuscularly with 2-4 × 106 rESC. The tumors were removed 8-14 weeks after injection and fixed in 4! paraformaldehyde. Paraffin sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and processed for histological examination.Characterization of ESC—In situ analysis of pluripotency markers such as alkaline phosphatase (Akp; Sino-American Biotechnology Co., LuoYang, China), SSEA-4 (Chemicon International), and Oct4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) on rESC or their derivatives was performed as described previously (36Wang S. Tang X. Niu Y. Chen H. Li B. Li T. Zhang X. Hu Z. Zhou Q. Ji W. Stem Cells (Dayton). 2007; 25: 481-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Based on Akp staining, rESC colonies were classified into two types: undifferentiated (compacted colonies with almost all cells positive for Akp) and differentiated (non-compacted colonies with some or all cells negative for Akp) (44Chambers I. Colby D. Robertson M. Nichols J. Lee S. Tweedie S. Smith A. Cell. 2003; 113: 643-655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2617) Google Scholar). The percentage of differentiated cell colonies compared with the total number of colonies was determined. Antibodies used to immunostain other markers included those against Nestin and glial fibrillary acidic protein (Chemicon International), brachyury (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), phospho-Smad1/5/8 (pSmad1/5/8) and phospho-Smad2/3 (pSmad2/3) (both from Cell Signaling Technologies), α-fetoprotein and albumin (Sigma-Aldrich), and smooth muscle actin (DakoCytomation, Glostrup, Denmark). The staining was visualized using fluorescein isothiocyanate- or phycoerythrin-conjugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Cell nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst 33342 (Sigma-Aldrich). Images were taken using a confocal laser-scanning system LSM 510 META (LSM 510 META; Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany).Cells positive for SSEA-4 or Oct4 were quantified by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). The cells were detached from the plates with 1 mg/ml dispase and dissociated with 0.25! trypsin in 0.04! EDTA (Sigma-Aldrich) (23Amit M. Carpenter M.K. Inokuma M.S. Chiu C.P. Harris C.P. Waknitz M.A. Itskovitz-Eldor J. Thomson J.A. Dev. Biol. 2000; 227: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar). Cells to be probed for the cell surface marker SSEA-4 were tested live, whereas cells to be probed for the nuclear marker Oct4 were fixed with 0.1! paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) for 10 min at 37 °C and then permeabilized with 90! methanol (Fisher Scientific) for 30 min on ice. 105 fixed (for Oct4) or live (for SSEA-4) cells were then incubated for 30 min at room temperature with anti-SSEA-4 antibody at a 1:50 dilution or with anti-Oct4 antibody at a 1:100 dilution. The corresponding isogenic immunoglobins (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used as negative controls for gating. The cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline containing 3! normal goat serum (Sigma-Aldrich) and then incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at a 1:200 dilution. The percentage of Oct4+ or SSEA-4+ cells was calculated following FACS analysis. Cell expansion -fold after a treatment was calculated as the number of SSEA-4+ cells at the end of the treatment over the total number of cells plated before the treatment. Two or more replicates were set for each group, and all experiments were repeated multiple times. The karyotypes of rESC were analyzed as described by Hayes et al. (45Hayes H. Rogel-Gaillard C. Zijlstra C. De Haan N.A. Urien C. Bourgeaux N. Bertaud M. Bosma A.A. Cytogenet. Genome Res. 2002; 98: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).Western Blotting—Cell colonies were mechanically removed from the culture plates and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Each cell sample was divided into two groups, from which the nuclear and total proteins were extracted, respectively. For nuclear protein extraction, the cell pellet was resuspended in a lysis buffer containing 10 mm Hepes, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mm EGTA with proteinase inhibitors to which 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added just before use. After a 15-min incubation at 4 °C, 1! Nonidet P-40 was added, and following centrifugation (11,400 × g for 5 min) the nuclei were precipitated and lysed in a buffer containing 10 mm Hepes, 0.4 mm NaCl, and 5 mm EDTA. After incubation for 30 min at 4 °C and centrifugation at 11,400 × g for 5 min, the supernatant containing the nuclear extract was transferred into a fresh tube and the protein content estimated as described below.For total protein extraction, radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, which contained 65 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1! Nonidet P-40, and 0.25! sodium deoxycholate, was used to lyse the cells and was supplemented with proteinase inhibitors before use. The cell pellets were resuspended and incubated in the radioimmune precipitation assay buffer for 30 min at 4 °C. The cell lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 8 min at 4 °C. Quantification of protein concentrations was carried out using the Protein Quantification Kit-Rapid (Biochemica International, Melbourne, FL) according to the manufacturer's instructions.The protein extracts (20 μg/lane) were separated in a polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membrane was then stained with primary antibodies to detect pSmad1/5/8, pSmad2/3, β-catenin (Abcam International), or Oct4 in the nuclear extracts, with AKT, phospho-AKT (Ser-473, p-AKT), phospho-ERK1/2 (Thr-202/Tyr-204, p-ERK1/2), ERK1/2 (all from Cell Signaling Technologies), Smad4 (Abcam), phospho-β-catenin (pCatenin, Abcam), bFGF (Calbiochem), or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (as a loading control, Kangchen Bio-Tech, Shanghai, China) for the total extracts. Horseradish peroxidase-labeled corresponding secondary antibodies (Pierce Biotechnology) were used to bind the primary antibodies. The antibody-bound protein bands on the membranes were visualized by using the ECL Western blotting detection system (Pierce). The experiments were repeated at least once on three different batches of rESC.Statistical Analysis—The results are presented as means ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using the least significant difference test. Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05.RESULTSTGFβ, FGF, and Wnt Pathways Are Required for rESC Self-renewal—The rESC express many genes for components of the TGFβ, FGF, and Wnt signaling pathways (36Wang S. Tang X. Niu Y. Chen H. Li B. Li T. Zhang X. Hu Z. Zhou Q. Ji W. Stem Cells (Dayton). 2007; 25: 481-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), but whether these pathways are required to sustain the self-renewal of rESC remains elusive. In this study, we first addressed this question by using SB431542 and TGFβ receptor I inhibitor (to repress the TGFβ pathway), SU5402 (to repress the FGF pathway), and Frizzled-1 and anti-Wnt3a antibody (to repress the Wnt pathway). These inhibitors promoted differentiation of rESC either on MEF in the ESC medium or on Matrigel in MEF-CM as judged on the basis of morphological criteria, Akp activity, and Oct4 expression (Table 1 and Fig. 1). Inhibition of the TGFβ, FGF, or Wnt pathways had negative effects on the pluripotency and proliferation capacity of rESC, based on up-regulation of the cell differentiation rate, the fraction of SSEA-4 positive cells, and the cell expansion -fold (Table 1). The results also showed that the degree of inhibition was different for different inhibitors. The efficacy of these inhibitors was in the following high-to-low order: SB431542 or SU5402 > TGFβ receptor I inhibitor > Frizzled-1 or anti-Wnt3a antibody (Table 1 and Fig. 1). A combination of the inhibitors showed a synergistic effect between SB431542 and SU5402. Furthermore, the combination of SU5402 and Frizzled-1 increased th"

To investigate the underlying mechanism and because the predicted structural features (tandem zinc fingers) are often present in transcription factors, we hypothesized that ZKSCAN3 regulates the expression of a gene(s) favoring tumor progression. We employed unbiased screening to identify a DNA binding motif and candidate downstream genes. Cyclic amplification and selection of targets using a random oligonucleotide library and ZKSCAN3 protein identified KRDGGG as the DNA recognition motif. In expression profiling, 204 genes were induced 2-29-fold, and 76 genes reduced 2-5-fold by ZKSCAN3. To enrich for direct targets, we eliminated genes under-represented (<3) for the ZKSCAN3 binding motif (identified by CAST-ing) in 2 kilobases of regulatory sequence. Up-regulated putative downstream targets included genes contributing to growth (c-Met-related tyrosine kinase (MST1R), MEK2; the guanine nucleotide exchanger RasGRP2, insulin-like growth factor-2, integrin β4), cell migration (MST1R), angiogenesis (vascular endothelial growth factor), and proteolysis (MMP26; cathepsin D; PRSS3 (protease serine 3)). We pursued integrin β4 (induced up to 6-fold) as a candidate target because it promotes breast cancer tumorigenicity and stimulates phosphatidyl 3-kinase implicated in colorectal cancer progression. ZKSCAN3 overexpression/silencing modulated integrin β4 expression, confirming the array analysis. Moreover, ZKSCAN3 bound to the integrin β4 promoter in vitro and in vivo, and the integrin β4-derived ZKSCAN3 motif fused upstream of a tk-Luc reporter conferred ZKSCAN3 sensitivity. Integrin β4 knockdown by short hairpin RNA countered ZKSCAN3-augmented anchorage-independent colony formation. We also demonstrate vascular endothelial growth factor as a direct ZKSCAN3 target. Thus, ZKSCAN3 regulates the expression of several genes favoring tumor progression including integrin β4.

Sporadic colorectal cancer largely reflects aberrantly activated pathways leading to unrestrained growth. In the Wnt pathway, stabilized β-catenin together with T cell factor-4 and lymphoid enhancer factor-1 DNA-binding proteins (1.Heyer J. Yang K. Lipkin M. Edelmann W. Kucherlapati R.

Kuwai T. Ellis L.M. Sanguino A. Lopez-Berestein G. Boyd D.D. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 4321-4330Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which ZKSCAN3 augmented colorectal tumorigenicity and progression was not addressed. Because the predicted ZKSCAN3 protein sequence included tandem zinc fingers, KRAB and SCAN domains typical of proteins that control gene expression (16.Chowdhury K. Goulding M. Walther C. Imai K. Fickenscher H. Mech. Dev. 1992; 39: 129-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 17.Li Y. Du X. Deng Y. Yang Z. Wang Y. Pen Z. Wang Z. Yuan W. Zhu C. Wu X. Mol. Biol. Rep. 2006; 33: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 18.Lu H. Zhu C. Luo J. Wang Y. Li D. Li Y. Zhou J. Yuan W. Qu Y. Liu M. Wu X. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 320: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that this zinc finger protein regulates the expression of one or multiple genes favoring tumor progression. To answer this question, we employed unbiased screening methods to identify a ZKSCAN3 DNA binding site and downstream targets. Cyclic Amplification and Selection of Targets (CAST-ing)—A random oligonucleotide library was synthesized as 5′-CACGTGAGTTCAGCGGATCCTGTCGNGAGGCGAATTCAGTGCAACTGCAGC-3′ (where N represents 26 random nucleotides). Binding reactions included poly(dI·dC), immobilized FLAG-ZKSCAN3, acetylated bovine serum albumin, and 500 ng of the random oligonucleotide library. After DNA-protein complex formation (room temperature, 20 min), complexes were proteinase K-treated, DNA-extracted, precipitated, and dissolved in Tris-EDTA buffer. PCR was used to enrich the ZKSCAN3-bound oligonucleotides. The 76′-mer PCR products were purified and used in subsequent rounds (total of 6) as described above. In the final round PCR products were labeled with [32P]dCTP mixed with purified FLAG-ZKSCAN3 protein (0-100 ng), and protein-DNA complexes were resolved in an polyacrylamide gel. Recovered oligonucleotides in DNA-protein complexes were cloned into the pGEM-T Easy Vector (Promega, #A1360) and sequenced. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—These were as described previously (19.Yan C. Boyd D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 6357-6358Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) using 2.5 μg of antibody and the following PCR primers for the integrin β4 intron 1 (specific 5′, 5′-GGGAAGGACAGCAGGAGGGAC-3′; specific 3′,5′-CTCTGGGCACACCTGCTCCT-3′; nonspecific 5′,5′-ATGGCACGGAACAGGGCA-3′; nonspecific 3′,5′-GCCATCCTCTTCCTCCTGCAG-3′) and VEGF (specific, 5′-GGGCAAAGCCCCAGAGGG-3′; specific 3′-GGAGGCTGGAGGGGTTCC-3′); nonspecific, 5′-GTGTCCCTCTCCCCACCC-3′;5′-CTGTCCAGAGACACGCGCC-3′) genes. Real-time quantitation of chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed using the ChIP-IT Enzymatic kit (Active Motif, catalog # 53006) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For primer design, the integrin β4 intron 1 sequence was analyzed by the File Builder v3.1 software (Applied Biosystems) and the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) to exclude repeat elements, low complexity DNA, and regions with sequence similarity. The resulting intronic sequences spanning or distant from the ZSCAN3 binding sites were chosen to design custom TaqMan primers (specific and nonspecific Taqman primers, respectively). EMSA—Nuclear extract (10 μg) was mixed with 0.6 μg of poly(dI/dC) and (2 × 104 cpm) of a γ-32P-labeled oligonucleotide and, where indicated, anti-ZKSCAN3 or pre-immune IgG (1 and 3 μg). The VEGF oligonucleotide sequence was 5′-TTGGCTTATGGGGGTGGGGGGTGCC-3′. The integrin β4 oligonucleotide sequences used were (wt-5′-GTC CCT GAG GGG AGG AGA TGT GAC A-3′; mt-probe, 5′-GTC CCT GAt ata AGG AGA TGT GAC A-3′) spanning the putative ZKSCAN3 binding motif in the integrin β4 promoter. Expression Profiling—RNA was extracted from orthotopically established tumors derived from HCT 116 cells harboring the empty vector or expressing the ZKSCAN3 coding sequence and subjected to expression profiling using the U133A Affymetrix chip harboring ∼18,000 cDNAs. We chose tumors instead of monolayer cells because the progression effects of ZKSCAN3 are so clearly evident in vivo. To increase our chances that we were identifying direct ZKSCAN3 targets, we queried the upstream -2-kb and downstream non-coding sequences including the first intron of the regulated genes for the ZKSCAN3 binding motif (KRDGGGG) identified by CAST-ing. Because this sequence would be expected to occur by chance 3× per 2 kb of nucleotide sequence (both strands), modulated genes harboring <4 copies of this motif in 2 kb of regulatory sequence were excluded. Immunocytochemistry—RKO cells were transiently transfected with pcDNA3-FLAG-ZKSCAN3 or the empty vector, and cells were fixed 48 h later and incubated with an anti-FLAG-M2 antibody (1:400) and then with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody. Nuclei were 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole-stained. Immunohistochemistry—After de-waxing and antigen retrieval, endogenous peroxidase was inactivated with H2O2, and slides were blocked with 5% normal horse serum, 1% normal goat serum. Sections were incubated with the indicated antibodies: 1 μg/ml affinity-purified anti-ZKSCAN3, a mouse anti-human integrin β4 (Chemicon MAB2058) (1:50), or a polyclonal anti human VEGF (1:100) (Santa Cruz sc-152) and then with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Immunoreactivity was detected with the DAB chromogen (Research Genetics). For negative controls, the anti-ZKSCAN3 antibody was substituted with an equivalent amount of pre-immune IgG. Orthotopic Tumor Model—Cells (>95% viability) (106 in 50 μl) were injected into the cecal wall of male athymic nude mice as described previously (20.Morikawa K. Walker S. Jessup J. Fidler I. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 1943-1948PubMed Google Scholar). All experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees. Purification of the FLAG-ZKSCAN3 Protein—Lysates of ZKSCAN3-expressing HCT116 cells in a buffer (50 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA 1% Triton X-100) were incubated with anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (4 °C overnight). The FLAG-ZKSCAN3 protein was eluted with 3× FLAG peptide. Reporter Assays—These were performed as described previously (21.Yan C. Lu D. Hai T. Boyd D.D. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2425-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). For the ZKSCAN3 reporter, duplicate copies of the wt (TGAGGGG) or mutated (TGAatat) ZKSCAN3 binding site derived from the integrin-β4 intron-1 were cloned upstream of a minimal tk-regulated luciferase reporter. Retroviral Transductions—AmphoPack™-293 cells (Clontech, #631505) were transfected with 10 μg of DNA (pSuperior-IGB4-shRNA) (22.Lipscomb E.A. Simpson K.J. Lyle S.R. Ring J.E. Dugan A.S. Mercurio A.M. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 10970-10976Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) using Lipofectamine 2000. After 10-24 h, medium was aspirated, and cells were washed 2× with phosphate-buffered saline and replenished with culture medium. Culture supernatant (containing the retroviral-encoded integrin β4-targeting shRNA) was collected every 12 h thereafter for 48 h, filtered through a 0.45-μm filter, and diluted 2-fold with fresh medium. Actively dividing target cells were transduced with the virus-containing medium using Polybrene (final concentration = 4 μg/ml), and cells were selected with puromycin. RT-PCR Semiquantitation of Transcripts—Total RNA was prepared from colorectal tissue (50 mg) in TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNA (20 μg) was treated (37 °C, 25 min) with 2 units/μl of TURBO DNA-free DNase enzyme (Ambion, #1907), and after DNase inactivation, cDNA was synthesized with avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase. PCR was performed using primers for ZKSCAN3 (100 ng each RT-5, 5′-GGC CCT GAC CCT CAC CCC-3′; RT-3, 5′-CAG ATG TGC CGC CTC CCT CC-3′), β-actin (10 ng), 1 unit of Taq polymerase in 30 amplification cycles. ZKSCAN3 primers were located in exons 6 and 7 with a PCR product of 294 bp. To semiquantitate the integrin β4 transcript, cDNA was prepared from 2 μg of RNA, and RT-PCR was performed using forward (5′-CAA GGA GGA GGG CCA GCC-3′) and reverse primers (5′-GGG TCA GCC CAT CCA CTA GG-3′) respectively. The predicted PCR product size was 288 bp. RT-PCR for VEGF employed the following primers: forward (5′-CCT CAC CAA GGC CAG CAC-3′ and reverse (5′-CTC ACC GCC TCG GCT TGT C-3′) with the predicted amplicon sizes: 318 bp, 244 bp, 112 bp, for VEGF isoforms 189, 16S, and 121, respectively. Q-PCR for Quantitation of Transcript Levels—Total RNA was isolated from cultured cells using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and reverse-transcribed using the cloned AMV First-Strand cDNA Synthesis kit (Invitrogen). Q-PCR was performed in duplicate (1 μl of cDNA in a total volume of 20 μl) using an ABI PRISM 7900 HT Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). Expression of integrin β4 was determined using the Applied Biosystems TaqMan Gene Expression Assay. Primers and probes were purchased from Applied Biosystems and were labeled with a 6-carboxyfluorescein, major Groove Binder quencher. Normalization was with β-actin. Soft-agar Assay—Cells were seeded in 0.3% agar and incubated at 37 °C for 14 days. VEGF Protein Measurements—We used an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; Quantikine Human VEGF ELISA kit, R&D Systems, catalog# DVE00) as per the manufacturer's protocol. Statistics—Statistical differences were determined using an unpaired t test and GraphPad Prism (Version 3.03) software. Identification of a DNA Binding Site for ZKSCAN3 by Cyclic Amplification and Selection of Targets—Although we previously implicated ZKSCAN3 as a new driver of colon cancer progression (15.Yang L. Hamilton S.R. Kuwai T. Ellis L.M. Sanguino A. Lopez-Berestein G. Boyd D.D. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 4321-4330Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), the underlying mechanism was not determined. Because the ZKSCAN3 sequence predicts protein domains typical of transcription factors, we hypothesized that the encoded protein is regulatory for one or multiple genes favoring colorectal cancer progression. Nuclear localization was evident in RKO cells transfected with a FLAG-tagged ZKSCAN3 (supplemental Fig. 1A, arrows) consistent with our immunohistochemistry on resected human colorectal cancers (15.Yang L. Hamilton S.R. Kuwai T. Ellis L.M. Sanguino A. Lopez-Berestein G. Boyd D.D. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 4321-4330Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and as expected for a regulator of gene expression. We then undertook cyclic amplification and selection of targets (CAST-ing) to identify a consensus DNA binding site. Purified ZKSCAN3 protein (supplemental Fig. 1B, first lane) was mixed with a random oligonucleotide library (complexity = 4 × 1015), protein-bound oligonucleotides were PCR-amplified, and the enriched population was subjected to additional rounds of enrichment (supplemental Fig. 1C). In the sixth round, enriched oligonucleotides were radiolabeled and subjected to EMSA with FLAG-ZKSCAN3 protein (supplemental Fig. 1D). Oligonucleotides in the DNA-protein complex were extracted, subcloned, and sequenced. Using the Align-Ace algorithm (23.Hughes J.D. Estep P.W. Tavazoie S. Church G.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 1205-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar), a consensus DNA binding site of KRDGGGG (K = G/T, R = A/G, and D = A/G/T) was derived. Identification of Candidate ZKSCAN3 Downstream Targets—To identify candidate downstream targets, we performed parallel expression profiling experiments using RNA from tumors (15.Yang L. Hamilton S.R. Kuwai T. Ellis L.M. Sanguino A. Lopez-Berestein G. Boyd D.D. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 4321-4330Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) generated from HCT 116 colon cancer cells expressing the ZKSCAN3 cDNA or the empty vector. HCT 116 express modest endogenous ZKSCAN3 levels and form small orthotopic tumors at a low incidence, whereas forced ZKSCAN3 cDNA expression in these cells yields 100% tumor take in nude mice, and tumors are larger (15.Yang L. Hamilton S.R. Kuwai T. Ellis L.M. Sanguino A. Lopez-Berestein G. Boyd D.D. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 4321-4330Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Transcription factors bearing zinc-finger SCAN and KRAB domains activate and repress gene expression (24.Luo K. Yuan J. Shan Y. Li J. Xu M. Cui Y. Tang W. Wan B. Zhang N. Wu Y. Yu L. Gene (Amst.). 2006; 367: 89-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 25.Huang C. Jia Y. Yang S. Chen B. Sun H. Shen F. Wang Y. Exp. Cell Res. 2007; 313: 254-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and we identified 204 genes induced 2-29-fold and 76 genes reduced 2-5-fold by ZKSCAN3 (data not shown). To reduce this large dataset we undertook 2 strategies; (a) we eliminated transcripts showing no change in parallel expression profiling using tissue cultured ZKSCAN3/vector-expressing HCT 116 cells, and (b) to enrich for direct targets, we eliminated genes under-represented (≤3) for the ZKSCAN3 binding motif (identified by CAST-ing) in 2 kb of regulatory sequence as this motif would by chance occur 3× per 2 kb. Fig. 1A shows induced putative downstream targets satisfying these criteria including several genes that contribute to increased growth (c-Met-related tyrosine kinase (MST1R) (26.Peace B.E.

Integrin β4 Is a Direct ZKSCAN3 Target—The induction of integrin β4 mRNA evident in expression profiling (up to 6-fold) and verified by RT-PCR and Q-PCR using RNA from tumors generated from the indicated cells (Fig. 1, B and C) was intriguing because this protein has been implicated in tumorigenicity (22.Lipscomb E.A.

Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4811-4819PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, integrin β4 stimulates the phosphatidyl 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling module (37.Lipscomb E.A. Mercurio A.M. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2005; 24: 413-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) implicated in colorectal cancer progression (9.Samuels Y. Diaz L.A. Schmidt-Kittler O. Cummins J.M. DeLong L.

https://openalex.org/W2010717647,"Copper metabolism Murr1 domain 1 (COMMD1) is a 21-kDa protein involved in copper export from the liver, NF-κB signaling, HIV infection, and sodium transport. The precise function of COMMD and the mechanism through which COMMD1 performs its multiple roles are not understood. Recombinant COMMD1 is a soluble protein, yet in cells COMMD1 is largely seen as targeted to cellular membranes. Using co-localization with organelle markers and cell fractionation, we determined that COMMD1 is located in the vesicles of the endocytic pathway, whereas little COMMD1 is detected in either the trans-Golgi network or lysosomes. The mechanism of COMMD1 recruitment to cell membranes was investigated using lipidspotted arrays and liposomes. COMMD1 specifically binds phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) in the absence of other proteins and does not bind structural lipids; the phosphorylation of PtdIns at position 4 is essential for COMMD1 binding. Proteolytic sensitivity and molecular modeling experiments identified two distinct domains in the structure of COMMD1. The C-terminal domain appears sufficient for lipid binding, because both the full-length and C-terminal domain proteins bind to PtdIns(4,5)P2. In native conditions, endogenous COMMD1 forms large oligomeric complexes both in the cytosol and at the membrane; interaction with PtdIns(4,5)P2 increases the stability of oligomers. Altogether, our results suggest that COMMD1 is a scaffold protein in a distinct sub-compartment of endocytic pathway and offer first clues to its role as a regulator of structurally unrelated membrane transporters.

COMMD1 (Murr1) is the founding member of a recently discovered family of COMMD (Copper metabolism Murr1 domain) 3The abbreviations used are: COMMD, copper metabolism Murr1 domain; TGN, trans-Golgi network; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; Ab, antibody; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; VARD, residues Met-1 through Gly-121; Bis-Tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; CAPS, 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid; BCS, bathocuproine disulfonate; PA, phosphatidic acid; PtdIns(4,5)P2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; CTD, C-terminal domain; BN-PAGE, Blue-native PAGE.3The abbreviations used are: COMMD, copper metabolism Murr1 domain; TGN, trans-Golgi network; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; Ab, antibody; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; VARD, residues Met-1 through Gly-121; Bis-Tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; CAPS, 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid; BCS, bathocuproine disulfonate; PA, phosphatidic acid; PtdIns(4,5)P2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; CTD, C-terminal domain; BN-PAGE, Blue-native PAGE. proteins (1Maine G.N. Burstein E. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2007; 64: 1997-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). COMMD1 was identified as the product of a gene mutated in dogs with severe hepatic copper toxicosis (2van De Sluis B. Rothuizen J. Pearson P.L. van Oost B.A. Wijmenga C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). In several breeds of dogs, especially in Bedlington terriers, a mis-splicing event in the Murr1 gene results in the loss of protein expression (3Klomp A.E. van de Sluis B. Klomp L.W. Wijmenga C. J. Hepatol. 2003; 39: 703-709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and massive copper accumulation in the liver that can reach remarkably high concentrations of 10,000-12,000 μg/g and lead to acute organ failure (4Kawamura M. Takahashi I. Kaneko J.J. Vet. Pathol. 2002; 39: 747-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The identification of Murr1 (COMMD1) by van de Sluis and co-workers (2van De Sluis B. Rothuizen J. Pearson P.L. van Oost B.A. Wijmenga C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) generated a great deal of interest and helped to create tools for genetic screening. However, the molecular mechanism through which COMMD1 regulates copper metabolism remains unknown. COMMD1 was shown to bind Cu(II) in vitro (5Narindrasorasak S. Kulkarni P. Deschamps P. She Y.M. Sarkar B. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 3116-3128Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), but whether this binding represents an in vivo property is uncertain. The observation, that in dogs lacking COMMD1 hepatic copper uptake is unperturbed but copper accumulates in dense lysosomal granules, suggested a defect in biliary copper export (6Johnson G.F. Morell A.G. Stockert R.J. Sternlieb I. Hepatology. 1981; 1: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The role of COMMD1 in copper export was further supported by the increased retention of copper in cultured cells in which COMMD1 was down-regulated with small interference RNA (7Burstein E. Ganesh L. Dick R.D. van De Sluis B. Wilkinson J.C. Klomp L.W. Wijmenga C. Brewer G.J. Nabel G.J. Duckett C.S. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 244-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). However, COMMD1 is a small soluble protein (see below) and cannot directly mediate transmembrane copper transport. It was proposed that COMMD1 controls copper export by regulating the intracellular localization of the copper-transporting ATPase ATP7B, which is chiefly responsible for the removal of excess copper from the liver into the bile. In support of this hypothesis, recombinant COMMD1 was shown to interact with the N-terminal domain of ATP7B in vitro and in cell lysates (8Tao T.Y. Liu F. Klomp L. Wijmenga C. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41593-41596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). However, down-regulation of COMMD1 has no apparent effect on the ability of ATP7B to traffic from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) to exocytic vesicles (Ref. 9de Bie P. van de Sluis B. Burstein E. van de Berghe P.V. Muller P. Berger R. Gitlin J.D. Wijmenga C. Klomp L.W. Gastroenterology. 2007; 133: 1316-1326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar and our data, not shown), suggesting that the effect of COMMD1 is downstream of the TGN. More recently, the observed increase in interactions between ATP7B mutants and COMMD1 led to the alternative hypothesis that COMMD1 may be a part of a quality-control mechanism for ATP7B folding (9de Bie P. van de Sluis B. Burstein E. van de Berghe P.V. Muller P. Berger R. Gitlin J.D. Wijmenga C. Klomp L.W. Gastroenterology. 2007; 133: 1316-1326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). A further layer of complexity (and uncertainly) about COMMD1 function was added by studies demonstrating that the genetic knockout of COMMD1 in mice leads to embryonic lethality between days 9.5 and 10.5 (10van de Sluis B. Muller P. Duran K. Chen A. Groot A.J. Klomp L.W. Liu P.P. Wijmenga C. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 27: 4142-4156Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Such a severe and early phenotype in rodents but not in dogs indicates that the functional significance of COMMD1 is species-dependent and may extend beyond hepatic copper export, a suggestion supported by the expression of Murr1 transcripts in all major tissues and cell types (3Klomp A.E. van de Sluis B. Klomp L.W. Wijmenga C. J. Hepatol. 2003; 39: 703-709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Furthermore, various protein-protein interaction experiments uncovered the ability of COMMD1 to dimerize with several members of COMMD family (11Burstein E. Hoberg J.E. Wilkinson A.S. Rumble J.M.

Klomp L.W. Wijmenga C. J. Hepatol. 2003; 39: 703-709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Evaluations of these interactions revealed that COMMD1 levels influence HIV infection, NF-κB signaling, sodium transport, and proteasome-mediated protein degradation (11Burstein E. Hoberg J.E.

EMBO J. 2007; 26: 436-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Today, the importance of COMMD1 in mammalian physiology is well established, whereas the mechanism behind COMMD1 activity, particularly at a cell membrane, remains elusive. Human COMMD1, characterized in this study, is a soluble 21-kDa protein, which is 88% identical to its canine orthologue. Members of the COMMD family show only modest homology to each other, sharing a single invariant residue (Trp-124 in COMMD1). Structural studies of the full-length COMMD1 have been complicated by protein instability and aggregation. However, the structure of the N-terminal fragment of COMMD1 (residues 1-108) was recently solved using NMR (15Sommerhalter M. Zhang Y. Rosenzweig A.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 365: 715-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). These studies revealed a helical structure and two positive patches at the surface of the fragment, but structural motifs that might offer mechanistic clues to COMMD1 activity were not apparent. We were in trigued by the observation that several COMMD1-dependent effects involve membrane proteins (copper transporter ATP7B and sodium channel ENaC) or membrane-dependent events (HIV infection and viral escape). Although it is thought that COMMD1 is a cytosolic protein, available data on the staining of endogenous COMMD1 in cells shows vesicular rather than cytosolic pattern (3Klomp A.E. van de Sluis B. Klomp L.W. Wijmenga C. J. Hepatol. 2003; 39: 703-709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Therefore, to better understand the biochemical function of COMMD1 we characterized in detail recombinant COMMD1, determined the localization of endogenous COMMD1 in hepatocytes, and generated a molecular model of this protein. We discovered that COMMD1 binds with high specificity to an important signaling and regulatory lipid, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2), localizes to the endosomal compartment, and forms higher order oligomers, which are stabilized by interactions with lipid. These properties suggest a mechanism by which COMMD1 can be recruited to the endocytic membranes and act as a scaffold/adaptor protein contributing to protein/vesicle sorting. Antibodies for COMMD1 Detection—Mouse monoclonal anti-COMMD1 antibody (Ab) was obtained from Abnova (Taipei, Taiwan). Polyclonal anti-COMMD1 Abs were obtained after serial immunization of chickens with purified non-tagged COMMD1 and purification of immune IgY from egg yolk (Aves Laboratories, Tigard, OR). Monoclonal anti-COMMD1 and chicken polyclonal anti-COMMD1 detect equally the monomeric COMMD1, but recognize various oligomeric forms of COMMD1 with different affinities (not shown). Immunofluorescence Detection of COMMD1 in HepG2 Cells—Cells were seeded onto lysine-coated coverslips and cultured in MEM+Glutamax, 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Coverslips were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, and then cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Blocking and permeabilization were done simultaneously with 3% bovine serum albumin, 1% gelatin, and 0.1% Tween 20. Primary Abs were diluted in PBS with 3% bovine serum albumin, and secondary antibodies were diluted in PBS with 0.1% Tween 20. Primary antibody dilutions were as follows: mouse anti-COMMD1 IgG2, 1:100, chicken anti-COMMD1 polyclonal, 1:500, mouse anti-EEA1 IgG1 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) 1:100, anti-CHMP2B (Abcam), 1:100, rat anti-LAMP1 (DHSB, University of Iowa), 1:100, anti-Golgin-97 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), 1:100, rat anti-ATP7B (16Tsivkovskii R. MacArthur B.C. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2234-2242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) 1:1000. Anti-Chicken HiLyte 555 (Anaspec, San Jose, CA) was used at 1 μg/ml. All other secondary Abs were from Invitrogen and used at 2 μg/ml and conjugated with either AlexaFluor 488 (shown in green) or AlexaFluor 555 (shown in red). Confocal microscopy was done utilizing a Zeiss LSM 500 laser-scanning microscope. Treatment of cells with 200 μm BCS or 50 μm CuCl2 was for 8 h in the media described above. The extent of co-localization, i.e. the proportion of overlapping pixels, was measured with the NIH ImageJ “Co-localization Test” plug-in using the Costes method of randomization for 25 iterations (17Costes S.V. Daelemans D. Cho E.H. Dobbin Z. Pavlakis G. Lockett S. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 3993-4003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar). Immunodetection of COMMD1 in Fractionated HepG2 Cell Lysates—HepG2 cells were seeded on 10-cm Petri dishes and allowed to grow for 3 days in the growth medium composed of MEM+Glutamax, 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin. Four hours prior to harvest, growth medium was replaced with fresh media containing 200 μm BCS or 50 μm CuSO4. Cells were washed with PBS before harvest and scraped from the plate in a lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1.0 mm EDTA, 1.0 mm EGTA, 1.0 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonylfluoride hydrochloride, and a Roche Complete protease inhibitor mixture). Cells were disrupted in a Dounce homogenizer with a loose-fitting pestle, incubated on ice for 5 min, made isotonic by addition of 0.1 volumes of 2.5 m sucrose, and homogenized by 25 strokes with a tight-fitting pestle. The cell lysates were then centrifuged at 6300 × g for 10 min to pellet nuclei and cell debris. The postnuclear supernatant was centrifuged for 30 min at 100,000 × g to separate the microsomal membranes from a soluble cytosolic fraction. The nuclei were purified from the initial 6300 × g pellet by twice re-suspending in TSE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 300 mm sucrose, 1.0 mm EDTA, 0.1% Igepal (Sigma-Aldrich)) and centrifuging for 5 min at 4000 × g. Membrane and nuclear fractions were then solubilized in TSE buffer containing 0.2% Triton X-100, and protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay (18Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of protein from nuclear, soluble, and membrane fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE on a 4-20% gradient gel (Pierce) under reducing conditions. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose by Western blot, and the membrane was blocked in Aquablock (EastCoastBio, North Berwick, ME) for 1 h at room temperature. Antibody incubations for immunodetection were used at following dilutions: mouse anti-COMMD1 (1:1000), chicken anti-COMMD1 (1:5000). Secondary antibodies, conjugated with either IRDye 700 or IRDye 800, were obtained from Rockland Immunochemicals (Gilbertsville, PA). Fluorescence detection of bound secondary Ab was performed with an Odyssey Scanner (Licor, Lincoln, NE). The same 21-kDa band corresponding to the endogenous COMMD1 was detected by different antibodies, immunodetection with chicken polyclonal anti-COMMD1 shown. Density Gradient Fractionation of Postnuclear Fraction—HepG2 cells were grown as described above. Fractionation was done essentially as described in a previous study (19Press B. Feng Y. Hoflack B. Wandinger-Ness A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1075-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Cells were washed once on the plate with PBS containing 2.0 mm CaCl2 and 0.9 mm MgCl2. Cells were scraped into PBS and centrifuged at 200 × g for 10 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in 3 volumes of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and protease inhibitors (Complete, Roche Applied Science). HepG2 cells were lysed by 15 passes through a 27-guage needle. Nuclei and unbroken cells were pelleted by two centrifugation steps at 1000 × g for 10 min. The postnuclear supernatant was loaded onto the top of a 20% Percoll cushion made isotonic with Tris-buffered saline and including protease inhibitors. Centrifugation was carried out in a Beckman Type 60 Ti ultracentrifuge rotor at 20,000 × g for 55 min. Fractions were collected from the bottom of the tube (∼950 μl each), to which CHAPS was added to 10 mm to solubilize membranes. After 1 h on ice with CHAPS, Percoll was sedimented by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min. Proteins were precipitated with 15% trichloroacetic acid in the presence of 0.12% deoxycholic acid. Denatured proteins were sedimented at 20,000 × g for 20 min, washed with 90% acetone, and air-dried. Denatured proteins were resuspended in 62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 5% SDS, and 10% glycerol, then heated to 95 °C for 5 min. Urea was added to 2.5 m, and solubilized proteins were loaded onto a 12.5% gel for SDS-PAGE. Cloning, Expression, and Purification of Recombinant COMMD1 and Its N-terminal and C-terminal Domains—Human COMMD1 cDNA (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) was cloned into pTYB12 (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) to generate a fusion protein with the chitin-binding domain/intein moiety or into the pET28b vector (Novagen/EMD Biosciences, Darmstadt, Germany) to add an N-terminal His6 tag (construct pET28b-COMMD1). In either case the cloning sites, NdeI (5′) and SalI (3′), were introduced by PCR using proofreading Pfu DNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science) and the forward 5′-CATATGGCAGCAGGCGAGCTTGAGGGTGGGCAAA and reverse 5′-GTCGACCTATCAGTTAGGCTGGCTGATCAGTGT primers, respectively. The N-terminal domain of COMMD1 (residues Met-1 through Gly-121, VARD) was cloned into pET28b utilizing pET28b-COMMD1 as a template, the same forward primer as for cloning of the full-length COMMD1, and the reverse primer 5′-GCCATCAAGTCTCGCGCTCAGGCCCCG to generate an SalI restriction site. The C-terminal domain, CTD (COMMD) of COMMD1 was cloned into pET28b from pET28b-COMMD1 template. The forward primer 5′-CATATGAGAGTTGATGGCAAG containing the NdeI restriction site was used along with the reverse primer described for cloning the full-length COMMD1. Expression and Purification—Initially, recombinant COMMD1 was expressed as a fusion with an intein and a chitin-binding domain in Escherichia coli ER2566 cells and purified in a nontagged form following dithiothreitol-induced excision from the fusion protein. In this purification system COMMD1 showed unusual properties. Specifically, despite good expression and solubility of the fusion protein, the yield of purified untagged COMMD1 was low because COMMD1 remained tightly bound to chitin (a polymer of N-acetylglucosamine) even after cleavage from the fusion portion. The protein could only be eluted from the resin using 4-6 m guanidine chloride. The small amount of non-tagged COMMD1 that was eluted from chitin beads showed rapid proteolysis to a stable ∼13-kDa fragment. Consequently, the non-tagged COMMD1 was only used to produce a polyclonal antibody (see above) and to confirm the identity of the 13-kDa product. For all functional studies, the His6-tagged variant was utilized. To produce recombinant His-tagged proteins (COMMD1 or individual domains), overnight cultures of E. coli BL21(DE3) cells transformed with the appropriate plasmid were diluted 1:200 to into 1-liter volumes of LB in baffled Erlenmeyer flasks and grown at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.8-1.0. Cultures were cooled to 16 °C before induction with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells were harvested after 4 h of growth at 16 °C. Cell pellets were resuspended in Buffer A (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.8, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (Complete Protease Inhibitors, Roche Applied Science). Cells were lysed in a French press, centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min, and the soluble fraction was passed through a 27-guage needle to reduce viscosity. The soluble lysate was applied to a column of either nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Qiagen) or Talon Cobalt resin (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed by gravity flow with 20 column bed volumes of buffer A, then 20 volumes buffer A containing 0.1% Triton X-100, and another 20 volumes of buffer A. COMMD1 was eluted with steps of buffer B (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.8, 300 mm NaCl) containing 50 mm, 100 mm, 150 mm, and 500 mm imidazole. Most of the full-length COMMD1 elutes with 150 mm imidazole, whereas degradation products elute at 50-100 mm imidazole (supplemental Fig. S1A). The VARD and CTD were purified using the same methods and eluted with 150 mm imidazole. For the liposome floatation assay, purified proteins were dialyzed to liposome buffer (20 mm HEPES, 50 mm KAc, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4). Mass spectrometry of purified COMMD1 and of the stable degradation fragment was performed at the Oregon Health & Science University Metal Ion Core by Dr. M. Ralle. N-terminal sequencing was performed at the Microchemical Facility at Emory University by Dr. J. Pohl. PIPstrip Assays—PIPstrips (Echelon, Salt Lake City, UT) were blocked in SuperBlock T-20 PBS (Pierce) for 2 h at room temperature and incubated with 1.0 μg/ml COMMD1, CTD, VARD, or the His6-tagged ATP-binding domain of ATP7B ATP-BD (16Tsivkovskii R. MacArthur B.C. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2234-2242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) (used as a negative control) for 2 h in SuperBlock (Pierce). After washing with PBS-T, the strips were incubated with anti-6His monoclonal antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) or chicken anti-COMMD1 Ab and visualized with appropriate secondary IRDye 800 Ab (Rockland) using an Odyssey scanner. Both primary Abs gave similar results. Liposome Binding/Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay Plate Assay—COMMD1, ATP-BD, alcohol dehydrogenase (Sigma-Aldrich), and PH domain of phospholipase Cδ (PIP2grip, Echelon Inc., Salt Lake City, UT) were bound to a Corning Costar 3591 polystyrene (medium binding) plate by incubating 1.0, 0.5, and 0.1 μg of each protein in 100 μl of PBS overnight at 4 °C. Unbound protein was removed, and wells were then blocked for 2 h at room temperature with 200 μl of blocking buffer (3% bovine serum albumin in PBS). Liposomes (PIPosome, Echelon), containing 1% of phosphorylated or non-phosphorylated phosphatidylinositol, were added at a total lipid concentration of 1 mm in 50 μl of blocking buffer and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with gentle rocking. The liposome solution was removed, and the wells were washed twice with 200 μl of PBS, then 4 times 10 min with blocking buffer. Bound liposomes were detected with Alexa-fluor 680-streptavidin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) using the Odyssey scanner. Fluorescence was quantified with Odyssey 2.0 software. Data are shown for 0.5 μg of protein bound to the plate. Testing Specificity of Lipid Binding in Solution Using a Liposome Floatation Assay—Lipids were obtained as chloroform solutions from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Phosphatidylcholine was mixed with target lipids in glass tubes at indicated percentages (w/w) for 2 mg of total lipid. Chloroform was removed under a stream of nitrogen gas. The dried lipids were dissolved in 200 μl of hexane, dried under nitrogen, and then dried for 45 min under vacuum. The dried lipid film was resuspended in liposome buffer (20 mm HEPES, 50 mm KAc, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) as described by Kno¨dler and Mayinger (20Knodler A. Mayinger P. BioTechniques. 2005; 38: 858Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and sonicated in a cup-horn sonicator for 15 min at 130-140 watts. For liposome binding, 100 μl of 2.0 mg/ml liposomes was mixed with purified COMMD1, VARD, or CTD at a final volume of 150 μl and allowed to bind at room temperature for 15 min. 450 μl of 40% sucrose in liposome buffer was added to a final sucrose concentration of 30%, and the mixture was layered onto a 700-μl 45% sucrose cushion. The liposome-protein-30% sucrose step was overlaid with 600 μl of 15% sucrose in liposome buffer, then with 150 μl of liposome buffer. The resultant sucrose step gradients were centrifuged at 40,000 rpm in a Beckman TLS-55 rotor for 20 min. Liposomes and bound protein were removed from the buffer phase (100 μl), and the protein was precipitated by addition of 400 μl of methanol. 100 μl of chloroform was added, then 300 μl of water. The mixture was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 3 min in a tabletop microcentrifuge, and the aqueous upper phase was removed, leaving the precipitated protein at the interphase. 400 μl of methanol was added to reduce density, and proteins were pelleted by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 5 min. Protein pellets were air-dried and dissolved in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Proteins were separated by reducing SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining or by Western blot as described above. BN-PAGE—HepG2 cells were cultured in 10-cm plates as described above and harvested by scraping into BN buffer (50 mm Bis-Tris, 500 mm ε-amino caproic acid, 2.5% glycerol, Roche Complete protease inhibitors, pH 7.0). Cells were lysed by 25 passages through a 27-gauge needle. Nuclei and cell debris were pelleted by centrifugation at 5,000 × g. The postnuclear supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min to separate soluble and membrane fractions. Membrane pellets were dissolved in BN buffer with 2% dodecyl maltoside DDM and incubated on ice for 1 h. Solubilized membrane fractions were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatants were used for BN-PAGE. Soluble and membrane fractions were loaded onto a 4-20% NativePage gel (Invitrogen) in BN buffer containing 2% dodecyl maltoside and 0.5% Coomassie G-250. For Western blot analysis, the gel was equilibrated in 10 mm CAPS, pH 11.0, and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane in the same buffer for 3 h at 180 mA. Immunodetection was performed as described above utilizing polyclonal chicken anti-COMMD1 and secondary detection with horse-radish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-Chicken (Aves Labs, Tigard, OR). Molecular Modeling of COMMD1 Structure—Ab initio structure prediction was carried out on a locally installed Rosetta ab initio software version 2.0 licensed through the University of Washington (the web-based version of this program is known as “Robetta”); the fragment libraries were generated using the web version of the Rosetta fragment server. In the fragment selection, the “homs” option was included while all remaining parameters were set as defaults. Using “ab initio” mode after decoy population filtering 1,000 structures had been obtained. In the case of the “constrained” mode, the distances between the Cα atoms for the N-terminal part of COMMD1 (2H2M) were calculated using a Shell script. Cα distances >8 but <12 Å were used to create a constraint file, which was used for decoy population filtering. The 1000 structures thus obtained were clustered using the Rosetta clustering program. The center of the most populated cluster was selected and minimized using CharmM and then validated as previously described (21Subbian E. Yabuta Y. Shinde U. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 14348-14360Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). COMMD1 Is Localized to Endosomal Vesicles in Hepatic Cells—The original genetics experiments revealed the important physiological role of COMMD1 in copper export from the liver, however the intracellular localization of COMMD1 in polarized hepatocytes has not been characterized. Consequently, we first examined the distribution of endogenous COMMD1 in cell compartments using subcellular fractionation. HepG2 cells were allowe"
https://openalex.org/W2071911784,"Mutations affecting either the structure or regulation of the microtubule-associated protein Tau cause neuronal cell death and dementia. However, the molecular mechanisms mediating these deleterious effects remain unclear. Among the most characterized activities of Tau is the ability to regulate microtubule dynamics, known to be essential for proper cell function and viability. Here we have tested the hypothesis that Tau mutations causing neurodegeneration also alter the ability of Tau to regulate the dynamic instability behaviors of microtubules. Using in vitro microtubule dynamics assays to assess average microtubule growth rates, microtubule growth rate distributions, and catastrophe frequencies, we found that all tested mutants possessing amino acid substitutions or deletions mapping to either the repeat or interrepeat regions of Tau do indeed compromise its ability to regulate microtubule dynamics. Further mutational analyses suggest a novel mechanism of Tau regulatory action based on an “alternative core” of microtubule binding and regulatory activities composed of two repeats and the interrepeat between them. In this model, the interrepeat serves as the primary regulator of microtubule dynamics, whereas the flanking repeats serve as tethers to properly position the interrepeat on the microtubule. Importantly, since there are multiple interrepeats on each Tau molecule, there are also multiple cores on each Tau molecule, each with distinct mechanistic capabilities, thereby providing significant regulatory potential. Taken together, the data are consistent with a microtubule misregulation mechanism for Tau-mediated neuronal cell death and provide a novel mechanistic model for normal and pathological Tau action.

The fact that such alterations cause neurodegeneration indicates that different Tau isoforms must exert at least some functionally distinct effects. fronto-temporal dementia and Parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 high pressure liquid chromatography 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid wild type fronto-temporal dementia and Parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 high pressure liquid chromatography 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid wild type Alternative splicing of Tau RNA produces six different Tau isoforms in the central nervous system; these isoforms fall into two groups known as 4-repeat Tau and 3-repeat Tau (14Goedert M.

As seen in Fig. 1A, 4-repeat Tau contains four 18-amino acid imperfect repeats near the COOH terminus separated from one another by 13–14-amino acid interrepeats. The exclusion of exon 10, which encodes the first interrepeat and second repeat, results in 3-repeat Tau. Mechanistically, both 3-repeat and 4-repeat Tau bind directly to microtubules, stimulate microtubule polymerization, and regulate microtubule dynamics (17Bunker J.M. Wilson L.

A number of models have been suggested to explain the mechanistic significance of the repeat/interrepeat region of Tau. Initially, each 18-amino acid repeat was thought to serve as an independent microtubule binding domain, with the interrepeats serving as spacers or linkers (26Butner K.A. Kirschner M.W. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 717-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 27Lee G. Neve R.L. Kosik K.S.

Subsequently, more detailed structure-function analyses demonstrating that the interrepeat between repeats 1 and 2 possesses potent microtubule assembly (28Goode B.L. Feinstein S.C. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 769-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar) and microtubule dynamics regulatory (21Panda D. Goode B.L. Feinstein S.C. Wilson L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11117-11127Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) activities as well as the presence of multiple FTDP-17 Tau mutations mapping to interrepeats led to revisions of this early model. For example, Goode et al. (25Goode B.L. Chau M. Denis P.E. Feinstein S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38182-38189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) provided evidence suggesting that the first two repeats and the interrepeat between them serve as a core functional unit for microtubule binding. Since Tau is an important regulator of microtubule action (17Bunker J.M. Wilson L. Jordan M.A. Feinstein S.C. Mol. Biol.

Cell. 1995; 6: 1887-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), it is not surprising that cells impose powerful regulatory controls over Tau activity. Indeed, Tau activity is finely regulated, both by developmentally regulated alternative RNA splicing and by complex combinatorial patterns of phosphorylation (reviewed in Refs. 29Andreadis A.

The regulatory FTDP-17 Tau mutations cause disease by expressing improper ratios of wild type Tau isoforms, generally resulting in an increased proportion of 4-repeat Tau expression (9Hutton M.

The underlying molecular mechanism(s) leading to neuronal cell death due to Tau dysfunction/misregulation are not understood. A widely held, gain-of-toxic function model suggests that Tau mutations lead to the formation and accumulation of abnormal intracellular Tau fibers, which in turn cause cell death by virtue of their proposed cytotoxicity (10Hong M. Zhukareva V. Vogelsberg-Ragaglia V. Wszolek Z. Reed L. Miller B.I. Geschwind D.H. Bird T.D. McKeel D. Goate A. Morris J.C. Wilhelmsen K.C. Schellenberg G.D. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.

This model is consistent with the ubiquitous presence of abnormal Tau fibers in numerous neurodegenerative diseases (7Lee V.M. Goedert M. Trojanowski J.Q. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1121-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (2112) Google Scholar). These fibers are all the more remarkable given the extreme solubility of normal Tau, even at high temperatures or low pH. However, recent work shows that Tau-mediated neuronal cell death occurs in several animal models in the absence of abnormal Tau fibers (44Wittmann C.W. Wszolek M.F. Shulman J.M. Salvaterra P.M.

An alternative, “microtubule misregulation” model suggests that Tau mutations interfere with the normal ability of Tau to regulate microtubule dynamics, which in turn leads to cell death (17Bunker J.M.

This model is consistent with a variety of pharmacological and somatic cell genetics investigations demonstrating that tight regulation of microtubule dynamics is essential for proper cell function and viability (50Jordan M.A. Wilson L.

To assess further the molecular basis of normal and pathological Tau action, we have used video microscopy to analyze the dynamic instability behavior of individual microtubules regulated by wild type and various FTDP-17 mutant Tau proteins. We show that amino acid substitution and deletion mutations that map to either the repeats or interrepeats in Tau and that cause neuronal cell death and dementia alter the ability of Tau to regulate microtubule dynamic instability in vitro. Alternatively, mutations mapping outside the region of repeats and interrepeats do not affect the regulation of microtubule dynamics in this reconstituted in vitro system. These findings provide strong support for the view that abnormal Tau action might lead to neuronal cell death and dementia through aberrant regulation of microtubule dynamics. Additionally, our data lead us to propose a novel model for Tau-mediated regulation of microtubule dynamic instability based on an “alternative core” mechanism. Generation of FTDP-17 Constructs—Expression vectors containing the human cDNA sequences for 3-repeat Tau (pET vector, 352aa; lacking either amino-terminal alternatively spliced exon) and 4-repeat Tau (pRK vector, 383aa; lacking either amino-terminal alternatively spliced exon) were kind gifts from Dr. Gloria Lee (University of Iowa) and Dr. Kenneth Kosik (University of California, Santa Barbara). 4-Repeat G272V, 4-repeat Δ280K, 4-repeat P301L, 4-repeat S305N, 4-repeat R406W, 3-repeat G272V, and 3-repeat R406W FTDP-17 constructs as well as 4-repeat P270L, 4-repeat G271V, 4-repeat G273V, 3-repeat P270L, 3-repeat G271V, and 3-repeat G273V were generated from the corresponding wild type construct by QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene). All mutations were verified by DNA sequence analysis. Purification of Tau and Tubulin—Tau was expressed and purified, as described (17Bunker J.M. Wilson L. Jordan M.A. Feinstein S.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2720-2728Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Briefly, Tau was expressed in Rosetta (DE3) pLacI cells (Novagen, Madison, WI). Bacteria were lysed by sonication and boiled for 20 min. Heat-stable proteins were isolated by centrifugation, bound to a phosphocellulose column, and eluted with a salt gradient (0.2-1.0 m NaCl). Tau-containing fractions were pooled and further purified using reverse-phase HPLC (DeltaPak-C18; Millipore, Billerica, MA). HPLC fractions containing Tau were pooled, lyophilized, and resuspended in BRB-80 buffer (80 mm Pipes, pH 6.8, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgSO4) with 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol. The concentration of each Tau sample was determined by an SDS-PAGE comparison with a Tau mass standard, the concentration of which was established by amino acid analysis (22Panda D. Samuel J.C. Massie M. Feinstein S.C. Wilson L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9548-9553Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Tubulin was purified, as described (54Toso R.J. Jordan M.A. Farrell K.W. Matsumoto B. Wilson L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1285-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Briefly, microtubule-associated protein-rich bovine brain microtubule protein was prepared by two cycles of assembly and disassembly. Tubulin was purified from other microtubule proteins by elution through a Whatman P-11 phosphocellulose column equilibrated in PEM50 (50 mm Pipes, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm GTP). Purified tubulin (>99% pure) was drop-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -70 °C. Microtubule Co-sedimentation Assays—Tubulin (15 μm tubulin dimer) was mixed with wild type or FTDP-17 mutant 3-repeat or 4-repeat Tau at 0.27 μm (1:55 Tau/tubulin) in PMEM (87 mm Pipes, 36 mm MES, 1.4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, pH 6.8) with 2 mm GTP. Microtubules were assembled at 35 °C until steady state was achieved (2 h), layered over an 80-μl sucrose cushion (50% sucrose in PMEM, 2 mm GTP) in 5 × 20-mm ultraclear centrifuge tubes (Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA), and centrifuged in a Beckman AH650 swinging bucket rotor for 12 min at 35,000 rpm (150,000 × g) at 35°C. Supernatants and pellets were harvested and solubilized in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Relative amounts of Tau in the supernatants and pellets were determined by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with the monoclonal antibody Tau-1 (55Binder L.I. Frankfurter A. Rebhun L.I. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 1371-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (1232) Google Scholar). Dynamic Instability Analyses—Purified tubulin (15 μm tubulin dimer) was polymerized on sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) axonemal seeds at 37 °C in the presence or absence of purified wild type or FTDP-17 mutant Tau protein in PMEM buffer (87 mm Pipes, 36 mm MES, 1.4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, pH 6.8) and 2 mm GTP. The dynamics of individual microtubules were recorded at 37 °C using video-enhanced differential interference contrast microscopy. The ends were designated as plus or minus on the basis of the growth rate, the number of microtubules that grew at opposite ends of the seeds, and the relative lengths of the microtubules (21Panda D. Goode B.L. Feinstein S.C. Wilson L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11117-11127Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 56Walker R.A. O'Brien E.T. Pryer N.K. Soboeiro M.F. Voter W.A. Erickson H.P. Salmon E.D. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1437-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). Plus ends were analyzed during the early elongation phase of polymerization (2–10 min after initiation of polymerization). Life histories of individual microtubules were collected as described in Ref. 21Panda D. Goode B.L. Feinstein S.C. Wilson L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11117-11127Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar with modifications. Data points were collected at 1–3-s intervals. A microtubule was considered to be growing or shortening if it increased or decreased in length at a rate >0.5 μm/min. Microtubules exhibiting growth rates of ≤0.5 μm/min over a period greater than 30 s were considered to be in an attenuated state. Average growth rates are the average of independent growth events. The catastrophe frequency was calculated by dividing the number of shortening events by the total time tracked. Each condition was filmed over multiple days using 2–5 distinct Tau/tubulin/GTP mixes (3–4 slides each). No gross variation in microtubule dynamics was observed between mixes or slides of a given condition. Microtubules were tracked by two independent investigators, each of whom obtained approximately equal average growth rates for each condition. Computational Methods—A quantitative measurement of the relationship between different experimental conditions can be achieved by extracting a feature for each condition and using a distance metric to compare the features. For our purposes, we extracted the growth rate distribution histograms for each of the Tau-microtubule dynamics reactions. The distances between two histograms were then computed using the match distance (57Werman M.P. S. Rosenfeld A. Comput. Vision Graphics Image Process. 1985; 32: 328-336Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar), which takes into account both the height of a histogram bin as well as the spatial position of the bin in the histogram. Two bins that are spatially distant contribute more to the distance between histograms than two bins that are spatially adjacent. Histogram modeling and distance computations were performed as described in Bhattacharya et al. (58Bhattacharya A. Levy S. LeBoeuf A. Gaylord M. Wilson L. Singh A.K. Feinstein S.C. BMC Bioinformatics. 2008; 9: 339-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Using the match distance, a distance matrix can be computed among the conditions. Although the distance matrix itself contains all of the needed information, its interpretation can be simplified by clustering and visualizing the values. We accomplished this with a heat map of the distance matrix, generated using the “heatmap.2” function from the “gplots” library of the open-source R statistical computing package (available on the World Wide Web). Both rows and columns were hierarchically clustered, and the clustering dendrogram is shown for the rows. In order to compare the abilities of wild type and mutant Tau pr"

We generated and analyzed transgenic mice expressing high levels of either FENIB-type (G392E) or wild-type human neuroserpin in neurons of the central nervous system. G392E neuroserpin accumulated age-dependently in neurons of the neocortex, thalamus, amygdala, pons, and spinal cord of homozygous transgenic mice. Such accumulations were not observed in hemizygous transgenic mice nor in transgenic mice for wild-type neuroserpin. In differential centrifugation of brain homogenates, G392E neuroserpin recovered in the nucleus-rich fraction dramatically increased along with aging, suggesting that the aggregations gradually increase their densities presumably by their conversion into heavier and more compact configurations. In immunoelectron microscopical analyses, immunopositivities for G392E neuroserpin were found not only in endoplasmic reticulum but also in lysosomes. G392E neuroserpin transgenic mice were much more susceptible to seizures induced by kainate administration than nontransgenic mice. Overall, G392E neuroserpin accumulated in the central nervous system neurons of transgenic mice in mutation-, aging-, and gene dosage-dependent manners. The established transgenic mice will be valuable to elucidate not only mechanisms for the formation of G392E neuroserpin aggregations but also pathways for the degradation and/or clearance of the already formed aggregations in neurons. Mutations in human neuroserpin gene cause an autosomal dementia, familial encephalopathy with neuroserpin inclusion bodies (FENIB). We generated and analyzed transgenic mice expressing high levels of either FENIB-type (G392E) or wild-type human neuroserpin in neurons of the central nervous system. G392E neuroserpin accumulated age-dependently in neurons of the neocortex, thalamus, amygdala, pons, and spinal cord of homozygous transgenic mice. Such accumulations were not observed in hemizygous transgenic mice nor in transgenic mice for wild-type neuroserpin.

The expression pattern in brain and in vitro complex formation studies demonstrated that tissue plasminogen activator is the most probable target protease for neuroserpin (2Krueger S.R. Ghisu G.-P.

Neurochem. 2002; 82: 1406-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The administration of neuroserpin decreased stroke volume and subsequent apoptosis associated with focal ischemia/reperfusion injury (6Yepes M. Sandkvist M. Wong M. K.K. Coleman T.A. Smith E.

These physiological actions of neuroserpin are thought to depend on the modulation of extracellular matrix degradation by proteolytic enzymes such as tissue plasminogen activator. Neuroserpin-deficient mice exhibited selective reduction of locomotor activity in novel environments and a neophobic response to novel objects (8Madani R. Kozlov S. Akhmedov A. Cinelli P. Kinter J.

Until now, four different mutations have been identified in human neuroserpin gene: S49P, S52R, H338R, and G392E. In the post-mortem examination of FENIB patient brains, the most disruptive mutation (G392E) formed much larger and more inclusion bodies compared with the S49P and S52R mutations. Because the earlier onset of the disease and the severity of clinical syndromes were strongly correlated with the magnitude of intracellular accumulation of mutant neuroserpin (11Davis R.L. Shrimpton A.E. Carrell R.W. Lomas D.A. Gerhard L. Baumann B. Lawrence D.A. Yepes M. Kim T.S. Ghetti B. Piccardo P. Takao M. Lacbawan F. Muenke M. Sifers R.N. Bradshaw C.B. Kent P.F. Collins G.H. Larocca D. Holohan P.D. Lancet. 2002; 359: 2242-2247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), neuroserpin accumulation in the central nervous system (CNS) appears to play a central role in the development of FENIB. Among the known neuroserpin mutants, the biochemical nature of mutant protein has been well characterized in S49P and S52R neuroserpin. The S49P neuroserpin was a poor protease inhibitor and readily formed polymers in vitro (13Belorgey D. Crowther D.C. Mahadeva R. Lomas D.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 2005; 280: 13735-13741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The S52R neuroserpin was trapped as an inactive intermediate that rapidly formed polymers in vitro (15Belorgey D. Sharp L.K. Crowther D.C. Onda M. Johansson J. Lomas D.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 3360-3367Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Crystal structures of neuroserpin indicated sequential insertion of the reactive center loop of one molecule into β-sheet A of another (16Briand C. Kozlov S.V. Sonderegger P. Grutter M.G. FEBS Lett. 2001; 505: 18-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Cell transfection studies in COS-7 cells have shown that mutant neuroserpin (S49P and S52R) is retained within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as polymers (17Miranda E. Romisch K. Lomas D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28283-28291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). However, such biochemical studies have not been reported on most severely disruptive mutant neuroserpin (G392E). The transgenic mice overexpressing wild-type (WT) neuroserpin in CNS showed a marked resistance to CNS injury induced by focal cerebral ischemia (18Cinelli P. Madani R. Tsuzuki N. Vallet P. Arras M. Zhao C.N. Osterwalder T. Rulicke T. Sonderegger P. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2001; 18: 443-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), suggesting a neuroprotective role for neuroserpin. Transgenic mice overexpressing mutant neuroserpin (S49P or S52R) in neurons of the CNS have been recently generated and characterized (19Galliciotti G. Glatzel M. Kinter J. Kozlov S.V. Cinelli P. Rulicke T. Sonderegger P. Am. J. Pathol. 2007; 170: 1305-1313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). These mice exhibited morphological, biochemical, and clinical features resembling those found in human FENIB. However, no transgenic mice have been reported that express G392E neuroserpin. In the present study, we generated transgenic mice overexpressing human G392E neuroserpin in neurons of the CNS. The G392E neuroserpin accumulated in CNS neurons of transgenic mice in mutation-, aging-, and gene dosage-dependent manners. The G392E neuroserpin transgenic mice were much more susceptible to seizures induced by kainate administration than nontransgenic (nonTg) mice. The pathological and physiological features of G392E neuroserpin transgenic mice reproduced those of human FENIB. Thus, this transgenic mouse strain will be useful in elucidating the molecular mechanisms of G392E neuroserpin accumulation in neurons and progression of the disease. Transgene Construction—By using mouse Thy-1.2 genomic DNA fragment (nucleotides 3233–3542; GenBank™ accession number M12379) as a probe, 4.50-kbp EcoRI-XhoI genomic DNA fragment containing mouse Thy-1.2 promoter (20Kelley K.A. Friedrich Jr., V.L. Sonshine A. Hu Y. Lax J. Li J. Drinkwater D. Dressler H. Herrup K. Mol. Brain Res. 1994; 24: 261-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) was cloned from a mouse embryonic stem cell genomic DNA library. WT human neuroserpin cDNA was generated by reverse transcription-PCR on human fetal brain total RNA (Stratagene). Primers used in the PCR were 5′-TTC TCG AGG AAA CTG TTA CAA TAT GGC TTC CTT GG-3′ and 5′-TTG GAT CCC AGG ACC ATT AGC TTA ATA CTG ATA ACA TTC C-3′; these sequences correspond to the nucleotides 68–95 and 1502-1471 of human neuroserpin cDNA (GenBank™ accession number Z81326) and contain XhoI and BamHI sites (underlined sequences), respectively. The amplified product was subcloned at the HincII site in pUC118 vector (Takara), and the plasmid was designated as pUC118/HuNS. pUC118/HuNS was digested with SalI (1195) and NsiI (1268), and then the SalI-NsiI 73-bp fragment was replaced with double stranded-oligonucleotides containing G to A mutation at 1256, leading to a replacement of the 392 glycine with glutamic acid. The WT and G392E neuroserpin cDNAs were fully sequenced for their accuracies and ligated between the Thy-1.2 promoter and SV40 polyadenylation signal sequence using XhoI and BamHI sites. The resultant hybrid gene (7.5 kbp) was separated from the pBlueScript SK(-) (Stratagene) by EcoRI. Generation of Transgenic Mice—DNA solution (3 ng/μl) was microinjected into the pronuclei of fertilized eggs from BDF1 females as described (21Umemura K. Kato I. Hirashima Y. Ishii Y. Inoue T. Aoki J. Kono N. Oya T. Hayashi N. Hamada H. Endo S. Oda M. Arai H. Kinouchi H. Hiraga K. Stroke. 2007; 38: 1063-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Identification of transgenic mice was performed by PCR on tail genomic DNA; the sequences of the primers for transgene amplification were 5′-CCA GGT TCA CAG TGG AAC AG-3′ and 5′-ATA CAG CAC AGC CAT CCT AC-3′. PCR was performed in thermal cycler (Bio-Rad) for 35 cycles with the following parameters: denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 60 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 90 s. Transgenic mice were backcrossed to CD-1 mice more than five times and analyzed. All of the procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines at the University of Toyama. Northern and Southern Blot Analyses—Northern blot analyses were carried out as described (22Kato I. Takasawa S. Akabane A. Tanaka O. Abe H. Takamura T. Suzuki Y. Nata K. Yonekura H. Yoshimoto T. Okamoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30045-30050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) by using 32P-labeled cDNAs; those were human neuroserpin cDNA (nucleotides 274–1197; GenBank™ accession number Z81326), mouse neuroserpin cDNA (nucleotides 84–788; GenBank™ accession number AJ001700), or mouse glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) cDNA (nucleotides 151–987; GenBank™ accession number M32599). Washed membranes were exposed to autoradiographic films (BioMax; Kodak). Southern blot was performed on PvuII-digested mouse genomic DNAs using human neuroserpin cDNA (nucleotides 68–903; GenBank™ accession number Z81326) as a probe. Western Blot Analyses—Each portion of CNS was homogenized using a glass Teflon homogenizer in 9 volumes of homogenizing buffer (0.32 m sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mg/ml each of leupeptin and pepstatin A, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Protein concentrations were determined using protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Homogenates denatured in the presence of 2! each of SDS and 2-mercaptoethanol for 10 min at 95 °C were subjected to SDS-PAGE on an 8! gel. Proteins blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences) were incubated with Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 0.1! Tween 20 (TBST) and 5! skim milk at room temperature for 1 h and then with goat anti-human neuroserpin antibody (at 1:250 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology; sc-20831), mouse anti-human calnexin antibody (at 1:500 dilution; BD Biosciences; C45520), rabbit anti-horse cytochrome c antibody (at 1:200 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology; sc-7159), or goat anti-mouse GAPDH antibody (at 1:200 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology; sc-20357) for 1 h. After washing excess antibodies off with TBST, the immunoreactive proteins were visualized using an ECL system coupled with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (at 1:5000 dilution; Amersham Biosciences). Densitometric Analyses—Computer-aided densitometric analyses using image analyzing software “ImageJ” were performed to establish a reliable standardization by an internal control. The GAPDH mRNA/protein, which is constitutively expressed in almost all of the tissues, was selected for an internal control. Relative mRNA or protein levels for human neuroserpin were expressed as ratios between the densities of bands corresponding to human neuroserpin and those to mouse GAPDH. Statistical significances were analyzed by a Student's t test. Significance was assumed at a p value of 0.05. Immunohistochemistry—The mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital and transcardinally perfused with phosphate-buffered saline. The excised brain and spinal cord were fixed in Gendre's fixative (a mixture of ethanol, formaldehyde, and acetic acid) at 4 °C overnight and embedded in paraffin. Following sectioning, the slides were deparaffinized and immersed in 0.3! H2O2 for 10 min. They were then preincubated with blocking reagent (DAKO) for 10 min, followed by overnight incubation in the presence of goat anti-human neuroserpin antibody (at 1:500 dilution) at 4 °C. After washing, sections were incubated with Histofine Simple Stain MAX-PO(G) (NICHIREI) for 30 min. Following several washes with TBS, the sections were reacted in a diaminobenzidine solution and then counter-stained with Mayer's hematoxylin for 30 s. Subcellular Fractionation—Subcellular fractions were prepared from whole brain homogenates using differential centrifugation (23Hansen T. Tommarello S. Allen J. Pediatr. Res. 2001; 49: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The homogenate was centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 11 min, and the supernatant (S1) was preserved in an ice bath. The pellet was resuspended with the homogenizing buffer and centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 11 min. The resulting pellet was resuspended in homogenizing buffer and harvested as a nuclear fraction (P1). The supernatant from the second centrifugation was combined with the S1 fraction and centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 60 min. The resulting pellet was resuspended in homogenizing buffer and harvested as a mitochondrial fraction (P2). The supernatant (S2) was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min, and the resulting supernatant was collected as a cytosolic fraction (S3). The final pellet was resuspended in homogenizing buffer and harvested as a microsomal fraction (P3). Electron and Immunoelectron Microscopy—The mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital and transcardinally perfused with 0.9! NaCl followed by 1/2 Karnovsky's fixation (2! paraformaldehyde and 2.5! glutaldehyde solution) in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The brains were embedded in 7! agar solution, and coronal slices with 100 μm-thickness were prepared by a micro-slicer (DTK-1500). The slices were fixed in 1! OsO4 in 0.2 m phosphate buffer, rinsed in water, and block-stained with 3! uranyl solution. They were dehydrated and embedded in Quetol 812. Ultrathin sections doubly stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate were examined under JEM-100S electron microscope at an acceleration voltage of 80 kV. For immunoelectron microscopy, sample preparations were performed at 4 °C after perfusion with 4! paraformaldehyde containing 0.05! glutaldehyde (pH7.4). They were subjected to cryoprotection by immersion in phosphate-buffered saline containing 15! sucrose. Coronal slices of cerebral cortex with a thickness of 2–3 mm were prepared and treated with the anti-human neuroserpin antibody (at 1:200 dilution). The brain slices were incubated with a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and then incubated with a benzidine chromogen. Ultrathin sections prepared from tissue sections embedded in Epon812 were examined. Kainate Administration—Kainate (Sigma) was dissolved in 0.9! saline at a concentration of 2.5 mg/ml. The intraperitoneal injection of kainate at a dose of 30 mg/kg body weight was performed on mice at 3 months of age. They were monitored for behavioral seizures by video recording for 3 h. The maximal seizure stage as well as the latency to the first maximal seizure were determined according to the criteria described previously (24Schauwecker P.E. Williams R.W. Santos J.B. J. Comp. Neurol. 2004; 477: 96-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar): stage 1, immobility; stage 2, forelimb and/or tail extension, rigid posture; stage 3, repetitive movements, head bobbing; stage 4, rearing and falling; stage 5, continuous rearing and falling; stage 6, severe tonic-clonic seizures. Generation of Transgenic Mice Overexpressing Human WT or G392E Neuroserpin in CNS Neurons—To generate the transgenic mice that express human WT- or G392E neuroserpin, the respective cDNAs were ligated to the mouse Thy-1.2 promoter (Fig. 1A), which ensures high expression of the transgene in most of the neurons in the CNS (20Kelley K.A. Friedrich Jr., V.L. Sonshine A. Hu Y. Lax J. Li J. Drinkwater D. Dressler H. Herrup K. Mol. Brain Res. 1994; 24: 261-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). By microinjection into fertilized eggs, we established three independent lines of transgenic mice for G392E neuroserpin (G392E-Tg mice) and three lines of transgenic mice for WT neuroserpin (WT-Tg mice). In Northern blot analysis using human neuroserpin cDNA as a probe, three lines (lines 183, 819, and 824) of WT neuroserpin transgenic mice but not nonTg mice expressed human neuroserpin mRNA in the brain (Fig. 1B, top panel). Among the G392E neuroserpin transgenic mice having hemizygous transgenes (G392Ehemi-Tg mice), line 333 expressed much higher levels of G392E neuroserpin mRNA than the other lines, 42 and 115. Mice having the homozygous G392E neuroserpin transgenes (G392Ehomo-Tg mice), which were generated by intercrossing male and female of G392Ehemi-Tg mice of line 333, showed much higher expression of human neuroserpin mRNA than G392Ehemi-Tg mice at 2 and 6 months of ages. In Northern blot analysis using mouse neuroserpin cDNA probe, similar but not identical levels of mouse neuroserpin mRNA expression (Fig. 1B, middle panel) were detected in the respective mice. The mouse GAPDH mRNA levels, used as an internal control, did not vary among the mice (Fig. 1B, bottom panel). Next we conducted Western blot analysis using anti-human neuroserpin antibody on whole brain homogenates (Fig. 1C). The three lines (lines 183, 819, and 824) of WT-Tg mice but not nonTg mice contained human neuroserpin protein in the brain at 2 months of age. As expected from Northern blotting (Fig. 1B), the brain of transgenic line 333 contained the highest level of human neuroserpin polypeptide among the G392Ehemi-Tg mice. In the line 333, the amounts of neuroserpin protein in the brain were much increased in the G392Ehomo-Tg mice when compared with the G392Ehemi-Tg mice. The amounts of neuroserpin protein in the G392Ehomo-Tg mice of line 333 appeared increased at 6 months of age when compared with those at 2 months of age. Immunohistochemistry of Human Neuroserpin in Transgenic Mouse Brain—By using anti-human neuroserpin antibody, we performed immunohistochemistry in various brain regions of nonTg and G392Ehomo-Tg mice of line 333 at 6 months of age. In the G392Ehomo-Tg mice, human neuroserpin immunoreactivities were observed in widespread neurons in the CNS, with higher levels in the cerebral cortex layer V (Fig. 2D, arrows), thalamus, and amygdala (Fig. 2E, arrows), and pons (Fig. 2F, arrows). Neurons in the hippocampus, striatum, internal capsule, and cerebellum had a lower prevalence of neuroserpin immunoreactivities (Fig. 2, D–F). As expected from the results of Western blotting (Fig. 1C), there were no significant immunoreactivities for human neuroserpin in the nonTg mouse brain (Fig. 2, A–C), confirming that the antibody reacts to human neuroserpin but not to mouse neuroserpin. We next examined intracellular localization of expressed neuroserpin at higher magnifications in various brain regions of nonTg, WT-Tg, G392Ehemi-Tg, and G392Ehomo-Tg mice at 2 and 12 months of age. WT neuroserpin was weakly and diffusely stained in neuronal cell bodies of the cerebral cortex and pons of WT-Tg mice (Fig. 3, A–D). In contrast, coarse and granular staining patterns for neuroserpin were observed within neuronal cell bodies of the cerebral cortex, pons, and spinal cord in G392Ehemi-Tg mice (Fig. 3, E–H). The immunopositive granules in the cerebral cortex of 12-month-old G392Ehomo-Tg mice (Fig. 3J, arrows) were much larger in size and greater in number when compared with those in 2-month-old G392Ehomo-Tg mice (Fig. 3I). It should be noted that in the neurons of the pons and spinal cord, almost all the area of the perikaryon was occupied by deposits immunopositive for neuroserpin (Fig. 3, K and L, arrows). In nonTg mice, there were no immunoreactivities for human neuroserpin (Fig. 3, M and N). In the PAS staining of cerebral cortex and pons of 12-month-old G392Ehomo-Tg mice, the neuroserpin deposits appeared PAS-positive (Fig. 3, O and P, arrows). Detection of Proteins, Genes, and mRNAs for Human Neuroserpin—We evaluated the levels of accumulated neuroserpin and GAPDH (internal control) in CNS by Western blot analyses. There were no significant changes in the protein levels of human neuroserpin in the brains of WT-Tg and G392Ehemi-Tg mice at 6 and 12 months of age compared with those at 2 months of age (Fig. 4A, top and middle panels). In contrast, G392Ehomo-Tg mice accumulated human G392E neuroserpin in an age-dependent manner (Fig. 4A, bottom panel). The densitometric ratios of human neuroserpin protein to mouse GAPDH protein indicated that there are significant increases of neuroserpin protein levels at 6 and 12 months of age when compared with those of the same genotype at 2 months of age (Fig. 4B). We then evaluated the accumulation of neuroserpin in various portions of CNS from 2 to 12 months of age. In the G392Ehomo-Tg mice, the G392E neuroserpin protein but not GAPDH protein age-dependently accumulated in the cerebral cortex, pons, and spinal cord but not in the cerebellum (Fig. 4C). The densitometric ratios of human neuroserpin protein to mouse GAPDH protein indicated that there are significant increases of neuroserpin protein levels at 6 and/or 12 months of age when compared with those of the same portions at 2 months of age (Fig. 4D). The significant increases were found in the cerebral cortex, pons, and spinal cord but not in the cerebellum. In Southern blot analysis using human neuroserpin cDNA probe, the G392Ehomo-Tg mice possessed human neuroserpin transgene in a doubled dosage compared with the G392Ehemi-Tg mice (Fig. 4E). By using human neuroserpin cDNA probe, Northern blot analysis was performed on brain RNAs of WT-Tg, G392Ehemi-Tg, and G392Ehomo-Tg mice (Fig. 4F, upper panel). In the respective transgenic mice, the levels of human neuroserpin mRNA remained unchanged at 11 or 12 months when compared with those at 2 months. The levels of mouse GAPDH mRNA were at similar levels in all the transgenic mice tested (Fig. 4F, lower panel). The densitometric ratios of human neuroserpin mRNA to mouse GAPDH mRNA indicated that there are significant increases of human neuroserpin mRNA levels in the G392Ehomo-Tg mice when compared with those in the age-matched G392Ehemi-Tg mice (Fig. 4G). Subcellular Fractionation of Human Neuroserpin in Transgenic Brains—Next we fractionated whole brain homogenates of various transgenic mice by differential centrifugation (see “Experimental Procedures”) and examined neuroserpin levels in each fraction by Western blot analyses (Fig. 5A). WT human neuroserpin in the WT-Tg mice was predominantly recovered in the microsomal fraction (100,000 × g pellet; P3) and to a lesser amount in the mitochondrial fraction (17,000 × g pellet; P2) fraction. G392E neuroserpin in G392Ehemi-Tg mice was largely recovered in the P2 and P3 fractions. In the G392Ehomo-Tg mice at 2 months of age, G392E neuroserpin was mainly recovered in the P2 and P3 fractions and to a lesser amount in the nuclear fraction (1,000 × g pellet; P1). In the G392Ehomo-Tg mice at 6 and 12 months of age, the amounts of G392E neuroserpin recovered in the P1 fraction dramatically increased along with aging. We next determined subcellular localization of neuroserpin, cytochrome c, and calnexin in various types of mice at 12–14 months of age. In the nonTg, WT-Tg, G392Ehemi-Tg, and G392Ehomo-Tg mice, the endogenous cytochrome c was recovered in the P1 and P2 fractions but not in the P3 and S3 fractions (Fig. 5, B–E). In the nonTg, WT-Tg, and G392Ehemi-Tg mice, the ER marker calnexin was predominantly recovered in the P3 fraction (Fig. 5, B–D). In the G392Ehomo-Tg mice, however, calnexin was recovered not only in the P3 fraction but also in the P1 fraction (Fig. 5E). Ultrastructural Analyses of Mouse Neurons—Transmission electron microscopy revealed that neocortical neurons of 10-month-old G392Ehomo-Tg mice have abnormally ballooned structures (Fig. 6B, open arrowheads). Such abnormal structures were never found in nonTg mice (Fig. 6A). At higher magnifications, the ballooned structures appeared to be filled with homogenous substances (Fig. 6C, open arrowheads) and encapsulated with polysome-attached ER membranes (Fig. 6C, arrows). The ballooned structures were clearly distinguishable from normal ER membranes (Fig. 6, A–C, filled arrowheads) as well as other organelles such as electron-dense lysosomes (Fig. 6C, indicated by L) and mitochondria with a heterogeneous appearance by its laminar structures (Fig. 6, A–C, indicated by M).

https://openalex.org/W1974273182,"The COOH-terminal polybasic region (PBR) of Rac1, a Rho family GTPase member, is required for Rac1 self-association, membrane localization, nuclear translocation, and interaction with downstream effectors. We previously demonstrated that phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase, one of the effectors that requires the polybasic region for interaction, is necessary for efficient invasin-promoted uptake of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis by nonphagocytic cells. Here we further examined the role of this region in invasin-promoted uptake. Using fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments (FRET), we determined that engagement of integrin receptors by invasin caused elevated levels of Rac1 self-association at the site of bacterial adhesion in a PBR-dependent fashion. Self-association could be disrupted using several strategies: translocation of the Yersinia YopT prenylcysteine protease into host cells, inactivation of the Rac1 isoprenylation signal that is required for membrane localization, and elimination of the PBR. Disruption in each case impaired invasin-promoted uptake. To determine if there is a role for the PBR in Rac1 effector signaling that was independent of its role in membrane localization or multimerization, we examined the effect of the PBR in the context of a Rac1 derivative that was targeted to the membrane via an NH2-terminal lipid tail. The membrane-targeted Rac1 derivative restored significant invasin-promoted bacterial uptake in a PBR-dependent manner and yet displayed no detectable self-association. This study indicates that, in addition to its role in promoting membrane localization, the PBR exerts a positive effect on Rac1-controlled bacterial uptake that is independent of Rac1 self-association, most likely due to signaling to downstream effectors.

Uptake of pathogenic bacteria by normally nonphagocytic cells is uniformly regulated by members of the Rho GTPase family, including Cdc42, Rac1, and RhoA (1Gruenheid S. Finlay B.B. Nature. 2003; 422: 775-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). In the case of the Gram-negative enteropathogenic bacterium Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, Rac1 is required for uptake, whereas Cdc42 and RhoA play either no role or a negative role, respectively (2Alrutz M.A. Srivastava A. Wong K.W. D'Souza-Schorey C. Tang M. Ch'Ng L.E. Snapper S.B. Isberg R.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 689-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 3Black D.S. Bliska J.B. Mol.

Rac1 can facilitate bacterial uptake by remodeling the actin cytoskeleton through one of three mechanisms: 1) inducing actin filament nucleation and branching by activating the Arp2/3 complex via WAVE family members (5Takenawa T. Miki H. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1801-1809Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); 2) increasing phosphoinositol 4,5-bisphosphate concentrations in the plasma membrane, resulting in uncapping of actin filaments (6Wong K.W. Isberg R.R. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 7Tolias K.F. Hartwig J.H. Ishihara H. Shibasaki Y. Cantley L.C. Carpenter C.L. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 153-156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar); or 3) inhibiting actin depolymerization by activating LIM kinases, which deactivate cofilin (8Bierne H. Gouin E. Roux P. Caroni P. Yin H.L. Cossart P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Activation of Rac1 requires GTP loading by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (RacGEFs), which show specificity for subclasses of Rho family members (9Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Sondek J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6: 167-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1327) Google Scholar). Exchange takes place simultaneously with release of Rac1 from RhoGDI proteins, which maintain Rho family GTPases in an inactive state in the cell cytoplasm (10Dovas A. Couchman J.R. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Release allows insertion of Rac1 in a target membrane via a prenyl group linked to the carboxyl terminus of the protein (11Robbe K. Otto-Bruc A. Chardin P. Antonny B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4756-4762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). After exchange and insertion into the membrane, active Rac1 is able to bind downstream effectors, many of which modulate the actin dynamics associated with bacterial uptake (12Ridley A.J. Trends Cell Biol. 2006; 16: 522-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar). The activation observed is often a response to engagement of cell surface receptors, resulting in interaction with downstream effectors (13del Pozo M.A. Price L.S. Alderson N.B. Ren X.D. Schwartz M.A. EMBO. 2000; 19: 2008-2014Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 14Del Pozo M.A. Kiosses W.B. Alderson N.B. Meller N. Hahn K.M. Schwartz M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 232-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). One example of a group of host cell surface molecules that activate Rac1 in response to substrate engagement is the β1 integrin receptor family, the members of which bind envelope proteins encoded by a wide range of pathogenic microorganisms (15Rottner K. Stradal T.E. Wehland J. Dev. Cell. 2005; 9: 3-17Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 16Stewart P.L. Nemerow G.R. Trends Microbiol. 2007; 15: 500-507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Y. pseudotuberculosis undergoes high efficiency bacterial uptake after engagement of β1 integrin receptors by the bacterial cell surface protein invasin (17Isberg R.R. Voorhis D.L. Falkow S. Cell. 1987; 50: 769-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Invasin binds integrins with a much higher affinity than natural ligands, such as fibronectin and laminin (18Van Nhieu G.T. Isberg R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24367-24375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Invasin is also able to form multimers, which is predicted to allow receptor clustering, thought to be a prerequisite for triggering intracellular signaling processes required for bacterial uptake (19Dersch P. Isberg R.R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1199-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The combined activities of high affinity binding and multimerization by invasin are critical for high efficiency invasin-mediated bacterial uptake that is regulated by activated Rac1 (19Dersch P. Isberg R.R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1199-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 20Leong J.M. Morrissey P.E. Marra A. Isberg R.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 422-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Engagement of β1 integrins by Y. pseudotuberculosis triggers efficient recruitment of Rac1 to nascent phagosomal membranes, resulting in localized accumulation of the activated GTPase, as determined by FRET 4The abbreviations used are:FRETfluorescence resonance energy transferPBRpolybasic regionCFPcyan fluorescent proteinmCFPmonomeric CFPYFPyellow fluorescent proteinmYFPmonomeric YFPWTwild typeGAPGTPase-activating proteinHAhemagglutininPIP5Kphosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase analysis (2Alrutz M.A. Srivastava A.

Although the most attractive model for Rac1 function at the phagocytic cup is that localized activation of Rac1 occurs at sites of receptor engagement, it is possible that active Rac1 is simply delivered to these sites by release of the GTP-loaded form from their soluble RhoGDI-bound complexes in the host cell cytoplasm. The latter possibility was suggested from a study in which fibronectin-coated beads were used to challenge cultured cells (14Del Pozo M.A. Kiosses W.B. Alderson N.B. Meller N. Hahn K.M. Schwartz M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 232-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that Rac1-GTP can be sequestered by cytosolic RhoGDI and then directly delivered to the site of receptor clustering without a membrane-dependent activation step. fluorescence resonance energy transfer polybasic region cyan fluorescent protein monomeric CFP yellow fluorescent protein monomeric YFP wild type GTPase-activating protein hemagglutinin phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase An additional mechanism for regulating the activity of Rac1 has been proposed. Gel filtration studies and co-immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that the polybasic region (PBR) at the COOH terminus of Rac1 mediates self-association of Rac1 (21Zhang B. Gao Y. Moon S.Y. Zhang Y. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8958-8967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This self-association is independent of the nucleotide status of Rac1. It has been suggested that PBR-mediated self-association potentiates Rac1-GTP to activate effectors, based on the observation that Rac1 derivatives lacking the PBR are defective for activation of the serine/threonine kinase PAK1 (21Zhang B. Gao Y. Moon S.Y. Zhang Y. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8958-8967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). If local engagement of β1 integrin receptors indeed triggers a localized RhoGDI release from Rac1, there should also be an induction of Rac1 self-association at the sites of integrin engagement. In this report, we investigate the role of the PBR in supporting invasin-mediated uptake of Y. pseudotuberculosis and identify sequence elements that are important for Rac1 self-association. Using derivatives that allow membrane localization of Rac1 without the presence of the PBR, we provide evidence that the role of this sequence in the uptake process appears to be independent of its role in self-association, presumably because the PBR is necessary to interact with downstream effectors or guanine nucleotide exchange factors. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Plasmid Constructs—Culture and transfection of COS1 cells were performed as previously described (2Alrutz M.A. Srivastava A. Wong K.W. D'Souza-Schorey C. Tang M.

Mammalian expression plasmids pmCFP-Rac1 and pmYFP-Rac1 encoding the NH2-terminal fusion of monomeric cyan fluorescence protein (CFP) or yellow fluorescence protein (YFP) to Rac1 as well as Rac1 derivatives having the G12V, R66A, C189S, or 6Q (183KKRKRK → 183QQQQQQ) mutations have been described (22Wong K.W.

The K186E mutation in Rac1 was generated using the Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit. pLyn-mCFP consists of a 10-amino acid myristoylation/palmitoylation sequence of Lyn kinase fused to the 5′-end of the mCFP gene (6Wong K.W. Isberg R.R. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). pLyn-mYFP was generated by replacing mCFP with mYFP. Rac1(C189S) or Rac1(6Q/C189S) devoid of the geranylgeranylation signal were inserted in frame into the COOH terminus of pLyn-mCFP to generate pLyn-mCFP-Rac1(C189S) or pLyn-mCFP-Rac1(6Q/C189S). mCFP-GerGer and mYFP-GerGer containing fluorescence protein fused to the CAAX geranylgeranylation signals, without the upstream polybasic region, were kindly provided by Dr. R. Tsien (University of California, San Diego) (24Zacharias D.A. Violin J.D. Newton A.C. Tsien R.Y. Science. 2002; 296: 913-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (1803) Google Scholar). Plasmids encoding HA-mYFP, Lyn-HA-mYFP, Myc-mCFP, and Lyn-Myc-mCFP fusions were constructed by replacing the enhanced green fluorescent protein gene in pEGFP-C1 (Clontech) with each tag-encoded gene indicated. Various Rac1 alleles (WT, R66A, 6Q, C189S, and 6Q/C189S) were then cloned into all four plasmids. All plasmids were verified by sequencing. Oligonucleotide sequences are available upon request.

Isberg R.R. PLoS Pathog. 2005; 1: 125-136Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The plasmid-cured Y. pseudotuberculosis strain lacks the virulence plasmid (pYV) that encodes YopE and YopT and is efficiently internalized into host cells. Strains that harbor the YopE Rho family GAP (22Wong K.W. Isberg R.R. PLoS Pathog. 2005; 1: 125-136Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar) or the YopT family CAAX protease (kind gift of Dr. James Bliska, SUNY Stony Brook) contain plasmids encoding these proteins as well as the plasmid pYV (yopT-deficient yopE::kan yopH::cam; referred to as strain YP17) to allow translocation of these proteins via the bacterial type III secretion system (22Wong K.W. Isberg R.R. PLoS Pathog. 2005; 1: 125-136Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar). For bacteria lacking the virulence plasmid, the YPIII(p-) strain was grown logarithmically in Luria Bertani broth at 26 °C until an A600 of 0.7, prior to inoculation onto cultured mammalian cells (22Wong K.W. Isberg R.R. PLoS Pathog. 2005; 1: 125-136Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar). For strains harboring the pYV plasmid and Yop-encoding plasmids, bacteria were grown with aeration at 26 °C overnight in broth supplemented with 2.5 mm CaCl2 and 100 μg/ml ampicillin and then subcultured and grown at 26 °C until A600 of 0.2. At this point, the cultures were shifted to 37 °C and aerated for 1 h. A multiplicity of infection of 50:1 was used for YPIII(p-) incubations, and a multiplicity of infection of 25:1 was used for other derivatives. For the pYopE-expressing plasmid, 0.1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was supplemented during infection to induce YopE expression. Bacterial uptake was assayed using immunofluorescence protection as described (6Wong K.W. Isberg R.R. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Briefly, bacteria appropriately cultured were incubated with transfected cells for 30 min at a multiplicity of infection of 50 at 37 °C. After incubation, the adherent cells were analyzed for internalized or surface-bound bacteria as described previously (6Wong K.W. Isberg R.R. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The monolayers were fixed in 3! paraformaldehyde and probed with primary antibody directed against Y. pseudotuberculosis, followed by a fluorescent secondary antibody (anti-IgG conjugated to either Alexa Fluor 594 or Cascade Blue) to detect extracellular bacteria. The cells were then permeabilized (2Alrutz M.A. Srivastava A. Wong K.W. D'Souza-Schorey C. Tang M. Ch'Ng L.E. Snapper S.B. Isberg R.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 689-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and probed with antibodies directed against the bacteria to allow detection of both intracellular and extracellular bacteria. The coverslips were then probed with appropriate secondary antibodies to detect intracellular bacteria. FRET Measurements—The basis of the assay is that association between Rac1 derivatives fused to either monomeric CFP or monomeric YFP should be detected as a FRET readout. COS1 cells were first transfected with a combination of various derivatives of mCFP-Rac1 and mYFP-Rac1 and then challenged with bacteria. Infections were stopped by fixation after 30 min. The cells were then imaged and analyzed for sensitized FRET from CFP to YFP essentially as described (22Wong K.W. Isberg R.R. PLoS Pathog. 2005; 1: 125-136Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar), using correction factors for CFP (0.32) and YFP (0.18) for bleed-through from CFP emission and cross-YFP excitation by the FRET filter set. To measure FRET, images from YFP, CFP, and FRET filter sets (22Wong K.W. Isberg R.R. PLoS Pathog. 2005; 1: 125-136Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar) were captured, choosing regions of interest about nascent phagosomes. Sensitized FRET was then calculated from these regions, by subtracting the CFP and YFP correction factors, using exactly the same procedure as described previously (22Wong K.W. Isberg R.R. PLoS Pathog. 2005; 1: 125-136Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar). FRET signals were normalized by combination of mCFP and mYFP emissions calculated from the CFP and YFP filter sets using the following formula as described (25Xia Z. Liu Y. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 2395-2402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). NormalizedFRET=sensitizedFRETCFP×YFP(Eq. 1) Determination of mYFP-Rac1 Expression Levels Relative to Endogenous Rac1—COS1 cells were transfected with mYFP-Rac1 and cultured overnight. Transfected cells were lifted and subjected to flow cytometry using YFP fluorescence to sort cells into four fractions according to levels of fluorescence (YFP negative, low, medium, and high). A portion of the sorted cells were plated onto fibronectin-coated coverslips, allowed to adhere for ∼3 h, fixed in 4! paraformaldehyde, and imaged to quantify YFP fluorescence. YFP fluorescence quantification was performed as described above for FRET experiments. The remaining sorted cells were lysed in sample buffer; lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, blotted, and probed for Rac1 using a monoclonal anti-Rac1 antibody (clone 23A8; Sigma). Immunoprecipitation of Myc/HA-tagged mCFP/mYFP Fusions—293T cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of each plasmid in 6-well dishes. Bait constructs were Myc-tagged, and prey constructs were HA-tagged. Cells were lysed 24 h post-transfection in 500 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1! Nonidet P-40, and complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). Lysates were then incubated at 4 °C (with agitation) for 10 min and spun to remove debris. 50 μl of the cleared lysates was saved as the input fraction, and 400 μl was applied to washed anti-HA epitope affinity resin (monoclonal anti-HA; Sigma) and incubated at 4 °C (with agitation) for 1 h. The resin was washed three times in wash buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 30 mm MgCl2, 40 mm NaCl, 0.1! Nonidet P-40), and bound proteins were eluted in 100 μl of sample buffer. 10 μl of eluted proteins (immunoprecipitate) as well as 10 μl of cleared lysates (input) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Input and immunoprecipitated proteins were detected using an anti-Myc epitope antibody (rabbit polyclonal; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) as well as an anti-HA epitope antibody (rabbit polyclonal; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Rac1 Self-associates in Cultured Cells—Y. pseudotuberculosis employs a variety of proteins to activate and misregulate Rac1 in host cells (22Wong K.W. Isberg R.R. PLoS Pathog. 2005; 1: 125-136Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In this report, we examined whether Y. pseudotuberculosis could also control self-association of Rac1 (21Zhang B. Gao Y. Moon S.Y. Zhang Y. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8958-8967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Previously, self-association was demonstrated in vitro by gel filtration chromatography and immunoprecipitation of differentially tagged Rac1 derivatives in an event requiring the COOH-terminal PBR (Fig. 1A) (21Zhang B. Gao Y. Moon S.Y. Zhang Y. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8958-8967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To determine if self-association occurs in cells and can be detected at spatially distinct sites within the cell, Rac1 self-association was analyzed by a FRET-based system, using monomeric CFP and YFP derivatives (mCFP-Rac1 and mYFP-Rac1) (Fig. 1C). When coexpressed in the same cells, mCFP-Rac1(WT) and mYFP-Rac1(WT) produced FRET throughout the cells in all regions except for the nucleus (Fig. 1, B and C). When normalized to the concentration of Rac1 at individual sites in the cell, FRET signals (normalized FRET) were notably stronger at membrane ruffles, indicating enhanced Rac1 self-association (Fig. 1C, arrows). These elevated FRET levels were specific to these sites, because at regions where no ruffles were evident, the lower levels of normalized FRET were independent of Rac1 concentrations. Consistent with biochemical data, self-association of Rac1, as detected by FRET, required the presence of the PBR on both partners. Co-transfection of mCFP-Rac1(WT) with mYFP-Rac1(6Q), which has each of the basic residues in the PBR replaced with Gln (26Knaus U.G. Wang Y. Reilly A.M. Warnock D. Jackson J.H. J. Biol.

Gao Y. Moon S.Y. Zhang Y. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8958-8967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Self-association Is Not Due to Overexpression of Rac1 Constructs—Since any self-association observed by FRET could result from aggregation of overexpressed protein, the concentration of Rac1 expressed from the transfected plasmids relative to endogenous levels of Rac1 was determined. COS1 cells were transfected with mYFP-Rac1 and sorted by flow cytometry to determine the concentration of Rac1 relative to the amount of YFP fluorescence observed by microscopy. The transfected cells showed a broad distribution of fluorescence (Fig. 2A), with a peak of untransfected cells and a shoulder of cells having increasing amounts of fluorescence. The total cell population was collected into four separate fractions consisting of cells with increasing amounts of YFP fluorescence (neg, lo, med, hi; Fig. 2A), and each population was analyzed to determine the amount of mYFP-Rac1 expression as well as the level of fluorescence using our standard microscopic techniques. The expression of mYFP-Rac1 in the YFP-lo fraction was lower than that of endogenous Rac1, based on Western blotting with anti-Rac1 antibody. The levels of mYFP-Rac1 were about 50! of the levels of endogenous Rac1 in this population (Fig. 2B; YFP lo). In contrast, the other sorted fractions (Fig. 2B; YFP med and YFP hi) expressed much higher levels of YFP-Rac1 compared with endogenous Rac1. Transfectants plated onto coverslips from the YFP-lo population clearly had fluorescence levels similar to those being used for FRET analysis (Fig. 2, C and D; compare lo versus med). When the fluorescence was determined on individual cells from the mYFP-lo fraction, the average intensity of individual cells was ∼500 fluorescence units (Fig. 2D), which is about the mean intensity of all the cells used for FRET (Fig. 2D; mYFP-Rac1(FRET)). In fact, the cell populations that showed overexpression of YFP-Rac1 gave fluorescence intensities that were well beyond what was analyzed by FRET (Fig. 2D; med). Therefore, a large proportion of the cells analyzed by FRET expressed amounts of mYFP-Rac1 that are at or below endogenous levels of Rac1. We conclude that self-association is not due to overexpression of the fluorescence derivatives. Plasma Membrane Localization of Rac1 Is Not Sufficient to Promote Self-association—The 6Q mutation that replaces the PBR has the secondary effect of interfering with plasma membrane localization of Rac1 (14Del Pozo M.A. Kiosses W.B. Alderson N.B. Meller N. Hahn K.M. Schwartz M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 232-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3, compare A with E). We therefore tested whether blocking plasma membrane localization would affect the ability of Rac1 to self-associate. The C189S mutation, immediately downstream of PBR, prevents geranylgeranylation of Rac1 at the carboxyl-terminal CAAX box and resulted in a large pool of the protein localizing in the nucleus, as previously described (27Kreck M.L. Freeman J.L. Abo A. Lambeth J.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15683-15692Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3C). This lipid modification is essential for the Ras superfamily of small GTPases to anchor onto the plasma membrane (28Hancock J.F. Paterson H. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1990; 63: 133-139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). Based on the FRET assay, mCFP-Rac1(C189S) showed no ability to interact with mYFP-Rac1(WT) (Fig. 1, B and E; C189S), indicating the importance of plasma membrane localization for Rac1 self-association. The C189S mutation also blocks RhoGDI binding (29Michaelson D. Silletti J. Murphy G. D'Eustachio P. Rush M. Philips M.R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 111-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that RhoGDI could play some role in Rac1 self-association. To rule out this possibility, the interaction of the Rac1(R66A) mutant was analyzed, which is unable to bind RhoGDI but maintains plasma membrane localization (22Wong K.W. Isberg R.R. PLoS Pathog. 2005; 1: 125-136Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 30Gibson R.M. Wilson-Delfosse A.L. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). mCFP-Rac1(R66A) p"

Different functional variants of this integrin are generated by alternative splicing and post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and ADP-ribosylation.

Protein structure modeling indicates this cleavage site is located in an open region between the β-propeller and thigh domains of the α7 chain. Compared with the non-cleavable α7 chain, the cleaved form enhances cell adhesion and spreading on laminin. Cleavage of the α7 chain is elevated upon myogenic differentiation, and this cleavage may be mediated by urokinase-type plasminogen activator.

Integrins are present in all metazoans and they are highly conserved in structure and function. In general, both α and β subunits have a short cytoplasmic domain, a large N-terminal extracellular domain, and a single hydrophobic transmembrane segment (9Humphries M.J. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 97: 585-592Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The N-terminal of the α subunit contains seven FG-GAP repeats forming a β-propeller domain that is important for ligand binding (10Xiong J.P. Stehle T. Diefenbach B. Zhang R. Dunker R. Scott D.L. Joachimiak A. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. Science. 2001; 294: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (1092) Google Scholar). The α7 chain is synthesized as a single 1135-amino acid polypeptide precursor, and like other integrin α chains, it is cleaved within the cell to form a heavy (≈100 kDa) and a light (≈30 kDa) chain connected by a disulfide bond (11Song W.K. Wang W. Foster R.F. Bielser D.A. Kaufman S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 643-657Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). α7 associates with β1 subunits and the α7β1 integrin is expressed in skeletal and smooth muscle cells, neurons, Schwann cells, and cardiomyocytes where it functions as a receptor for laminin (12Song W.K.

Expression of α7 integrin in skeletal muscle is developmentally regulated at the transcriptional level and by alternative splicing, resulting in at least two extracellular (X1 and X2) and two cytoplasmic isoforms (A and B) (12Song W.K.

The α7A cytoplasmic isoform is only found in skeletal muscle, and it is enriched at myotendinous and neuromuscular junctions (12Song W.K. Wang W. Sato H. Bielser D.A. Kaufman S.J. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 1139-1152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Burkin D.J. Kaufman S.J. Cell Tissue Res. 1999; 296: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 15Collo G. Starr L.

Cell Tissue Res. 1999; 296: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 19Ren B. Yu Y.P. Tseng G.C. Wu C. Chen K. Rao U.N. Nelson J. Michalopoulos G.K. Luo J.H. J. Natl.

Both α7A and α7B levels increase during myogenic differentiation, indicating that expression of the integrin is coordinately regulated with skeletal muscle maturation (11Song W.K. Wang W. Foster R.F. Bielser D.A. Kaufman S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 643-657Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The α7X1 and α7X2 isoforms differ in their extracellular regions and have different ligand preferences and binding affinities to laminin (16Ziober B.L. Vu M.P. Waleh N. Crawford J. Lin C.S.

Whereas α7X2 binds equally well to laminin-1 and laminin-2/4 (merosin), α7X1 preferably binds to laminin-2/4, and may also bind laminin-8 and laminin-10/11 (17Ziober B.L. Chen Y. Kramer R.H. Mol.

This suggests that diverse functions of the integrin can be achieved by varying the composition of its extracellular and cytoplasmic domains. The β1 cytoplasmic domain may also influence α7β1 binding (23Yeh M.G. Ziober B.L. Liu B. Lipkina G. Vizirianakis I.S. Kramer R.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3507-3518Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additional post-translational modifications, including glycosylation and ADP-ribosylation, may also regulate α7β1 functions (24Zolkiewska A. Moss J. Adv. Exp. Med.

Interestingly, both α7 and α6 integrins have recently been identified as tumor suppressors and inhibitors of metastasis in various malignances including prostate cancer (19Ren B. Yu Y.P. Tseng G.C.

Thus, it is of interest to understand if proteolytic cleavage of the α7 integrin chain occurs and how it may regulate α7 integrin functions. Myogenesis and regeneration of skeletal muscle involves myoblast activation, proliferation, migration, and subsequent fusion into myofibers (37Schmalbruch H. Bibl.

The activation of plasminogen is often used to generate such extracellular proteolytic activities (42Castellino F.J. Ploplis V.A. Thromb.

Similarly, skeletal muscle disease and injuries also induce higher levels of α7 gene expression and its protein levels at the sarcolemma (54Hodges B.L. Hayashi Y.K. Nonaka I. Wang W. Arahata K.

Cleavage of the α7 chain is elevated upon myogenic differentiation, and may be mediated by urokinase-type plasminogen activator. These results suggest proteolytic cleavage as a novel mechanism that regulates α7 integrin functions in skeletal muscle, and that the generation of such cleavage sites is another evolutionary mechanism for expanding and modifying protein function.

The gastrocnemius-soleus complexes were rapidly dissected and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Cell Culture and Transfection—C2C12 mouse myoblasts were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 20! fetal bovine serum (Biomeda), 0.5! chick embryo extract (Biologos Inc.), and 2 mm glutamine (Invitrogen).

Upon confluence cells were switched to differentiation medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2! horse serum) to induce myotube formation. Transfections were carried out using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer's instructions.

Primers (5′-ggtctccaaacccctcgattagggaggcaagcgcctgacc-3′ and 5′-ggtcaggcgcttgcctccctaatcgaggggtttggagacc-3′) were used to produce the desired point mutation in the rat α7 integrin with QuikChange II Site-directed Mutagenesis Kits (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's instructions. The sequence of the mutated α7 plasmid was confirmed by sequencing. Reverse Transcription, PCR, and Sequencing—Genomic DNA was isolated using the Wizard genomic DNA purification kit (Promega). Total cellular RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). 2 μg of total RNA was used to synthesize first strand cDNA with the Retroscript reverse transcription kit (Ambion). Primers used to amplify human, mouse, and rat α7 integrin from genomic DNA and cDNA are listed in Table 1. PCRs of genomic DNA or cDNA were carried out using high fidelity Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) in 50-μl reactions. PCR conditions were: 95 °C for 5 min, followed by 40 cycles of 94 °C for 45 s, 57 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 1 min, with a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min. PCR products were cleaned using QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen) and sequenced at the W. M. Keck Center for Comparative and Functional Genomics, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign.TABLE 1Primers for amplifying and sequencing α7 integrin genomic DNA and cDNA regions spanning the cleavage sitecDNAGenomic DNARat and L8E63Forward5′-gtgcccagcagctacagc-3′5′-ggggttgttccagtgagaaa-3′Reverse5′-gggtcagagggcaggttg-3′5′-ctctcacaccaggagcactg-3′Human and PC1Forward5′-catgttccagctccaggaaaatgt-3′5′-gggattgttccagtgaggaa-3′Reverse5′-gggtccgatggcaggttg-3′5′-cagaacccatgctcacctct-3′Mouse and C2C12Forward5′-tgtgttccagctgcaggaaaacgt-3′5′-tgggacttgggagttgtttc-3′Reverse5′-gggtcagagggcaggttg-3′5′-gggtgctgtcctttcacatt-3′ Open table in a new tab Sequence Alignment and Protein Structure Modeling—Sequences of α7 integrin were obtained from the Ensemble data base and aligned using ClustalW (60Chenna R. Sugawara H. Koike T. Lopez R. Gibson T.J. Higgins D.G. Thompson J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3497-3500Crossref PubMed Scopus (3999) Google Scholar). This program was also used to align human α3, α6, α7, and αV integrin sequences. Structural modeling of the α7 integrin chain was done in MOD-BASE (61Pieper U. Eswar N. Braberg H. Madhusudhan M.S. Davis F.P. Stuart A.C. Mirkovic N. Rossi A. Marti-Renom M.A. Fiser A. Webb B. Greenblatt D. Huang C.C. Ferrin T.E. Sali A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: D217-D222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using the known integrin αV crystal structure (Protein Data Bank code 1JV2) in the protein data bank. The modeled α7 integrin structure was viewed with Chimera Package (62Pettersen E.F. Goddard T.D. Huang C.C. Couch G.S. Greenblatt D.M. Meng E.C. Ferrin T.E. J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25: 1605-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (26187) Google Scholar) and superimposed on the αV integrin structure. Antibody and Chemical Reagents—O26 monoclonal antibody was prepared as described (11Song W.K. Wang W. Foster R.F. Bielser D.A. Kaufman S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 643-657Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Preparation of rabbit polyclonal antibody (CDB347) against the α7B cytoplasmic domain has also been described (12Song W.K. Wang W. Sato H. Bielser D.A. Kaufman S.J. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 1139-1152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Polyclonal rabbit anti-rat integrin β1 antibody was kindly provided by Dr. Steffan Johansson (Uppsala University, Sweden). Active murine uPA was purchased from Chemicon. Amiloride hydrochloride hydrate was obtained from Sigma. Serine protease inhibitor mixture, α2-antiplamin, and uPA inhibitor PAI-1 were obtained from Calbiochem-Novabiochem (La Jolla, CA). Western Blotting and Immunoprecipitation—Muscle tissue or cell pellets were extracted in lysis buffer composed of 2! Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 1 mm EGTA (pH 7.5), 1/200 Protease Inhibitor Mixture III (Calbiochem), and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at 4 °C for 30 min. After centrifugation, supernatants were collected and protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of total protein were separated on 8! SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Blocked membranes were incubated with the respective primary antibodies. Horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch) were used to detect bound primary antibodies. Immunoreactive protein bands were detected by chemiluminescence using an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). The intensities of these bands were quantified using ImageQuant software. For immunoprecipitations, polyclonal antibody against β1 integrin was covalently linked to AminoLink plus coupling gel using a mammalian co-immunoprecipitation kit (Pierce). 500 μl of total protein were added to the antibody-coupled gel and control non-antibody-linked gel. The mixtures were rotated at 4 °C for 4 h, and washed five times with cold Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS). Bound protein complexes were eluted with ImmunoPure IgG Elution Buffer (pH 2.8) (Pierce) and loaded onto 8! SDS-PAGE gels and subjected to Western blotting. Immunofluorescence—Expression of wild type and mutant rat integrin α7 was detected by immunofluorescence microscopy using O26 monoclonal antibody at 10 μg/ml, a concentration that detects only rat α7. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) diluted 1:150 was used to detect the primary antibody. Washes were done in serum-free media. Cells were then fixed in ice-cold methanol for 5 min and rehydrated in PBS for 30 min at 4 °C. Texas Red-labeled phalloidin (Molecular Probes) was used at a 1:200 dilution. Coverslips were mounted with Vectashield mounting medium containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories) and sealed with Pro-Texx (Lerner Laboratories). Immunofluorescent images were acquired using a Leica DMRXA2 microscope, AxioCam digital camera (Zeiss), and Openlab software (Improvision) and immunofluorescence intensity was determined using ImageQuant software (GE Healthcare). Flow Cytometry—Cells transfected to express wild type and mutant α7 integrin were detached and pelleted. After washing, cells were incubated with monoclonal antibody O26 in medium containing 1! BSA on ice for 1 h. After three washes the cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled secondary antibody (1:150 dilution) for 1 h on ice. Following three more washes the cells were fixed in 4! paraformaldehyde for 10 min, pelleted, and resuspended in DPBS containing 1! BSA. Vector-only transfected cells were used as a negative control. Flow cytometry analysis was performed using a BD Biosciences FACS 6 color cytometer (BD Biosciences). Data analysis was performed using FCS Express 3 (De Novo Software). Cell Adhesion and Spreading Assays—The adhesion assay has been described (21Crawley S. Farrell E.M. Wang W. Gu M. Huang H.Y. Huynh V. Hodges B.L. Cooper D.N. Kaufman S.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 235: 274-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Briefly, mouse laminin (Invitrogen) in 0.1! BSA in DPBS was adsorbed onto 24-well polystyrene plates (Costar) overnight. The plates were washed three times with DPBS and blocked for 1 h at room temperature with DPBS containing 1! BSA. Ham's F-12 medium with 0.1! BSA was added to the wells and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Transfected CHO cells were washed once and suspended in F-12 medium containing 1! BSA. 5 × 104 cells were added to each well and incubated at 37 °C for 10, 20, and 30 min. Non-adherent cells were removed by gently washing with DPBS; the remaining cells were fixed in 95! ethanol for 5 min and stained with 0.1! crystal violet for 30 min. After destaining with distilled water, stained cells in 10 random fields were counted using a Nikon eclipse TS100 inverted microscope (×20 objectives) equipped with a Nikon Coolpix 950 digital camera. For cell spreading assays, glass Lab-Tek chamber slides (Fisher Scientific) were coated overnight with 20 μg/ml laminin in DPBS containing 0.1! BSA. Chambers were washed three times with DPBS and 105 cells in 500 μl of Ham's F-12 containing 1! BSA were added. After 15, 30, 45, and 60 min, non-adherent cells were gently washed away with DPBS. Adherent cells were fixed with 4! paraformaldehyde in DPBS for 10 min and rendered permeable in DPBS containing 0.5! Triton X-100 for 10 min. Fixed cells were stained with Texas Red-labeled phalloidin. Cellular and nuclear areas were measured using Openlab software. The percent of spread cells in 20 randomly chosen fields per sample were counted. A cell was considered to have spread when its total area was at least 2-fold larger than the area of its nucleus. Data Analysis—All averaged data are presented as the mean ± S.E. Multiple group comparisons were performed using one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey's post hoc analyses. Comparisons of two groups were performed using unpaired two-tail Student's t test. Differences were considered significant at p < 0.05. A Species-specific Proteolytic Cleavage Site in the α7 Integrin Chain—Two proteolytic cleavage sites were initially identified in the sequence inferred from the gene encoding the rat α7 integrin chain (Fig. 1A) (11Song W.K. Wang W. Foster R.F. Bielser D.A. Kaufman S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 643-657Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One cleavage takes place within the cell, at a RRRE site, and is common to many α integrin chains (1Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8946) Google Scholar). This generates a heavy and a light chain that are disulfide bond linked (1"
