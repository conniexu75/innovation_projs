https://openalex.org/W2091407052,"Long-standing models propose that plant growth responses to light or gravity are mediated by asymmetric distribution of the phytohormone auxin. Physiological studies implicated a specific transport system that relocates auxin laterally, thereby effecting differential growth; however, neither the molecular components of this system nor the cellular mechanism of auxin redistribution on light or gravity perception have been identified. Here, we show that auxin accumulates asymmetrically during differential growth in an efflux-dependent manner. Mutations in the Arabidopsis gene PIN3, a regulator of auxin efflux, alter differential growth. PIN3 is expressed in gravity-sensing tissues, with PIN3 protein accumulating predominantly at the lateral cell surface. PIN3 localizes to the plasma membrane and to vesicles that cycle in an actin-dependent manner. In the root columella, PIN3 is positioned symmetrically at the plasma membrane but rapidly relocalizes laterally on gravity stimulation. Our data indicate that PIN3 is a component of the lateral auxin transport system regulating tropic growth. In addition, actin-dependent relocalization of PIN3 in response to gravity provides a mechanism for redirecting auxin flux to trigger asymmetric growth."

Our results indicate that imitation of goal-directed action by preverbal infants is a selective, interpretative process, rather than a simple re-enactment of the means used by a demonstrator, as was previously thought."

https://openalex.org/W2053805369,"Historical biogeography is dominated by vicariance methods that search for a congruent pattern of fragmentation of ancestral distributions produced by shared Earth history. A focus of vicariant studies has been austral area relationships and the break-up of the supercontinent Gondwana. Chameleons are one of the few extant terrestrial vertebrates thought to have biogeographic patterns that are congruent with the Gondwanan break-up of Madagascar and Africa. Here we show, using molecular and morphological evidence for 52 chameleon taxa, support for a phylogeny and area cladogram that does not fit a simple vicariant history. Oceanic dispersal--not Gondwanan break-up--facilitated species radiation, and the most parsimonious biogeographic hypothesis supports a Madagascan origin for chameleons, with multiple 'out-of-Madagascar' dispersal events to Africa, the Seychelles, the Comoros archipelago, and possibly Reunion Island. Although dispersal is evident in other Indian Ocean terrestrial animal groups, our study finds substantial out-of-Madagascar species radiation, and further highlights the importance of oceanic dispersal as a potential precursor for speciation."
https://openalex.org/W2163170565,"Searching for cell surface proteins expressed at interendothelial cell contacts, we have raised monoclonal antibodies against intact mouse endothelial cells. We obtained two monoclonal antibodies, 1G8 and 4C10, that stain endothelial cell contacts and recognize a protein of 55 kDa. Purification and identification by mass spectrometry of this protein revealed that it contains two extracellular Ig domains, reminiscent of the JAM family, but a much longer 120-amino acid cytoplasmic domain. The antigen is exclusively expressed on endothelial cells of various organs as was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Immunogold labeling of ultrathin sections of brain as well as skeletal muscle revealed that the antigen strictly colocalizes in capillaries with the tight junction markers occludin, claudin-5, and ZO-1. Upon transfection into MDCK cells, the antigen was restricted to the most apical tip of the lateral cell surface, where it colocalized with ZO-1 but not with β-catenin. In contrast to JAM-1, however, the 1G8 antigen does not associate with the PDZ domain proteins ZO-1, AF-6, or ASIP/PAR-3, despite the presence of a PDZ-binding motif. The 1G8 antigen was not detected on peripheral blood mouse leukocytes, whereas similar to JAM-1 it was strongly expressed on platelets and megakaryocytes. The 1G8 antigen supports homophilic interactions on transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells. Based on the similarity to the JAM molecules, it is plausible that the 1G8 antigen might be involved in interendothelial cell adhesion.

The control of vascular permeability, leukocyte extravasation, and the formation and outgrowth of blood vessels are dependent on the opening and closure or the dissociation and formation of interendothelial cell junctions (1Dejana E. Lampugnani M.G. Martinez-Estrada O. Bazzoni G. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 2000; 44: 743-748PubMed Google Scholar, 2Vestweber D. J. Pathol. 2000; 190: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Adherens junctions are essential for the integrity of endothelial cell contacts, and VE-cadherin, the most prominent transmembrane protein of adherens junctions, is directly involved in the maintenance of these contactsin vitro as well as in vivo (3Lampugnani M.G. Resnati M. Raiteri M. Pigott R. Pisacane A. Houen G. Ruco L.P. Dejana E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1511-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar, 4Gotsch U. Borges E. Bosse R. Böggemeyer E.

Paracellular permeability across endothelial or epithelial cell layers is determined by tight junctions that seal the intercellular space (6Anderson J.M. Van Itallie C.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: G467-G475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tight junctions show ion and size selectivity, and their barrier function varies in tightness between epithelial and endothelial cells and also between endothelia in different types of blood vessels and different tissues (7Kniesel U. Wolburg H. Cell. Mol. Neurobiol. 2000; 20: 57-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). To understand how the paracellular permeability of tight junctions is regulated and how they are formed, we need to know their molecular composition. Several proteins have been identified that are associated with the cytoplasmic side of tight junctions, but only a few tight junction proteins are known that span the membrane (8Tsukita S. Furuse M. Itoh M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 285-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (2041) Google Scholar). Occludin was the first tight junction membrane protein that was identified. It contains four transmembrane domains (9Furuse M. Hirase T. Itoh M. Nagafuchi A. Yonemura S. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1777-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (2129) Google Scholar) and is found in epithelia as well as endothelia. It is likely to be a functional component of tight junctions, although junctional strands and functional tight junctions also form in the absence of the occludin gene (10Saitou M. Fujimoto K. Doi Y. Itoh M. Fujimoto T. Furuse M. Takano H. Noda T. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 397-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). By contrast, members of the newly discovered gene family of the claudins are indeed essential for tight junction formation and can lead to the formation of tight junction strands upon transfection into fibroblasts (11Furuse M. Fujita K. Hiiragi T. Fujimoto K. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1539-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (1715) Google Scholar, 12Furuse M. Sasaki H. Fujimoto K. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 391-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar, 13Tsukita S. Furuse M. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 268-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). There are presently some 20 members of this family known. They are small tetraspanning membrane proteins with short cytoplasmic N and C termini. Some of the claudins have highly restricted expression patterns. Claudin-5 was found to be expressed by endothelia in a large range of blood vessels in different tissues including muscle and brain (14Morita K. Sasaki H. Furuse M. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). The third type of tight junction-associated membrane proteins is represented by the immunoglobulin supergene family (IgSF) member JAM (junctional adhesion molecule), a protein with two V-type Ig domains (15Martin-Padura I. Lostaglio S. Schneemann M. Williams L. Romano M. Fruscella P. Panzeri C. Stoppacciaro A. Ruco L. Villa A. Simmons D. Dejana E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar). JAM is expressed by endothelial as well as epithelial cells and was found to be enriched at tight junctions. JAM was also identified on mouse platelets and dendritic cells (16Malergue F. Galland F. Martin F. Mansuelle P. Aurrand-Lions M. Naquet P. Mol. Immunol. 1998; 35: 1111-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and on human neutrophils, monocytes, subsets of lymphocytes, platelets, and red blood cells (17Williams L.A. Martin-Padura I. Dejana E. Hogg N. Simmons D.L. Mol. Immunol. 1999; 36: 1175-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), (18Liu Y. Nusrat A. Schnell F.J. Reaves T.A. Walsh S. Pochet M. Parkos C.A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2363-2374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A mAb1 against JAM can block the extravasation of myeloid cells in two mouse inflammation models (15Martin-Padura I. Lostaglio S. Schneemann M. Williams L. Romano M. Fruscella P. Panzeri C. Stoppacciaro A. Ruco L. Villa A. Simmons D. Dejana E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar, 19De Del Maschio A. Luigi A. Martin-Padura I. Brockhaus M. Bartfai T. Fruscella P. Adorini L. Martino G. De Furlan R. Simoni M.G. Dejana E. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1351-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). It is not yet known whether the inhibitory effect of the antibody is due to interference with control mechanisms that regulate the opening of interendothelial cell contacts or whether it is due to the inhibition of leukocyte-endothelial interactions possibly mediated by JAM. The antibody does not change paracellular permeability of endothelial cell monolayers; however, another mAb against human JAM was reported to inhibit transepithelial resistance recovery in epithelial cell monolayers (18Liu Y. Nusrat A. Schnell F.J. Reaves T.A. Walsh S. Pochet M. Parkos C.A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2363-2374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In combination with the recently found association of JAM with the PDZ domain protein ASIP/PAR-3 (20Ebnet K. Suzuki A. Horikoshi Y. Hirose T. Meyer-zu-Brickwedde M.-K. Ohno S. Vestweber D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3738-3748Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), an essential cytoplasmic factor for the establishment of cell polarity, it is conceivable that JAM is involved in the regulation or formation of tight junctions. Recently two JAM-related proteins were identified, each containing one V and one C2 type Ig domain (21Palmeri D. van Zante A. Huang C.C. Hemmerich S. Rosen S.D. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 19139-19145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) have been suggested. The subcellular localization at junctions was analyzed for JAM-1 by immunogold electron microscopy (15Martin-Padura I. Lostaglio S. Schneemann M. Williams L. Romano M. Fruscella P. Panzeri C. Stoppacciaro A. Ruco L. Villa A. Simmons D. Dejana E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar), revealing its localization at tight junctions and even its close spatial relationship with tight junction strands (26Itoh M. Sasaki H. Furuse M. Ozaki H. Kita T. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Based on confocal laser scanning microscopy, JAM-2 was reported to be enriched at the apical site of intercellular contacts of transfected MDCK cells, suggesting its potential to be targeted to the area of tight junctions (23Aurrand-Lions M. Duncan L. Ballestrem C. Imhof B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2733-2741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). As judged by immunohistochemistry, this JAM was restricted to endothelial cells in sections of mouse kidney and lymph nodes (23Aurrand-Lions M. Duncan L. Ballestrem C. Imhof B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2733-2741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). VE-JAM was reported to be absent from human leukocytes and from epithelia in several human tissues and was found on endothelial cells of various blood vessels (21Palmeri D. van Zante A. Huang C.C. Hemmerich S. Rosen S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19139-19145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Based on a classical mAb approach, we have found two endothelially specific mAbs with which we identified a 55-kDa protein at interendothelial cell contacts. Identification of the purified protein by mass spectrometry revealed that it is an Ig-SF member containing one V-type and one C2-type Ig domain that is related to the JAMs although different in several aspects from the three known members of this family. Our antigen is identical to the recently described endothelial cell-selective adhesion molecule (ESAM) whose endothelial specificity has been analyzed so far on the RNA level by in situhybridization (27Hirata K. Ishida T. Penta K. Rezaee M. Yang E. Wohlgemuth J. Quertermous T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16223-16231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Analyzing a panel of mouse tissues by immunohistochemistry, we show here that the ESAM protein is indeed specifically expressed on endothelium and not on epithelium. Although a tagged recombinant form of ESAM had been reported not to colocalize with ZO-1 in transfected MDCK-II cells (27Hirata K. Ishida T. Penta K. Rezaee M. Yang E. Wohlgemuth J. Quertermous T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16223-16231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), we found that native ESAM does colocalize with ZO-1 but not with β-catenin in transfected MDCK-C7 cells. More importantly, ESAM was clearly colocalized with the three tight junction markers occludin, claudin-5, and ZO-1 in brain and muscle blood capillaries, as documented by immunogold electron microscopy. ESAM was not found on peripheral blood mouse leukocytes but was strongly expressed on megakaryocytes and activated platelets. The association of ESAM with endothelial tight junctions and its ability to support homophilic adhesion between transfected CHO cells suggest that ESAM might be involved in the control of interendothelial cell contacts. Monoclonal antibodies against mouse endothelial cell surface antigens were generated by immunizing rats with intact bEnd.3 mouse endothelioma cells and screening hybridoma supernatants for antibody binding in cell surface enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays as described (28Morgan S.M. Samulowitz U. Darley L. Simmons D.L. Vestweber D. Blood. 1999; 93: 165-175Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Positive antibodies were further screened for cell contact staining by immunofluorescence and for endothelial specificity by immunohistochemistry (see below). In this way two antibodies were selected: 1G8 (IgG2a) and 4C10 (IgG2a). Rabbit antibodies against the extracellular domain of ESAM (VE-19) were raised against an ESAM-IgG fusion protein, and rabbit antibodies against the cytoplasmic domain of ESAM (VE-2) were raised against a GST fusion protein containing the cytoplasmic domain of ESAM except for the last 21 C-terminal amino acids. To purify the polyclonal antibodies, non-IgG proteins were removed from the sera by caprylic acid precipitation. Antigen-specific antibodies of serum VE-19 were affinity-purified on ESAM-IgG immobilized on CNBr-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), and antibodies against the IgG1 Fc part were removed by incubation with immobilized human IgG1. Antibodies from antiserum VE-2 were affinity-purified on CNBr-Sepharose-immobilized MBP-ESAM fusion protein. The following antibodies were commercially obtained: mouse mAb clone 14 (IgG1) against β-catenin (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY); rat mAb RAM 34 (IgG2a) against mouse CD34 (Pharmingen, Heidelberg, Germany); rat mAb MECA-79 (29Streeter P.R. Rouse B.T.N. Butcher E.C. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1853-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar) against peripheral node addressin (ATCC, Manassas, VA); rabbit polyclonal antibodies against ZO-1 and occludin (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA); rabbit serum against von Willebrand factor (DAKO, Hamburg, Germany); labeled secondary antibodies (Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rat from Jackson Immunoresearch Lab., Inc. West Grove, PA; Alexa goat anti-rabbit from MoBiTec, Göttingen, Germany); gold-conjugated antibodies: goat anti-rat 5 nm, goat anti-rabbit 10 nm, and 15 nm (British Biocell Int., Cardiff, UK). Generation and affinity purification of rabbit polyclonal antibodies against mouse claudin-5 have been described (30Liebner S. Fischmann A. Rascher G. Duffner F. Grote E.H. Kalbacher H. Wolburg H. Acta Neuropathol. 2000; 100: 323-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Confluent monolayers of bEnd.3 cells were rinsed two times with phosphate-buffered saline, collected by scraping in the same buffer supplemented with 2 mm dithiothreitol and protease inhibitors (2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin), harvested by centrifugation, and extracted in lysis buffer (20 mm imidazole, pH 6.8, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin). The lysates were clarified by two consecutive centrifugation steps (30,000 × g for 20 min; 90,000 × g for 2 h). The cell lysates were incubated with mAb 1G8 or 4C10 immobilized to CNBr-Sepharose. The immunocomplexes were washed four times with lysis buffer (protease inhibitors omitted), subjected to SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by silver staining. Gel-separated proteins were reduced, alkylated, and digested in gel according to Ref. 31Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7822) Google Scholar and subsequently identified by a two-tier mass spectrometric approach. In the first round, small aliquots (1–2%) of the generated peptide mixtures were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry on a Bruker REFLEX III (Bruker Daltonik, Bremen, Germany) to yield a peptide mass map (32Jensen O.N. Podtelejnikov A.V. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1997; 69: 4741-4750Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). A list of monoisotopic peptide masses was obtained from the spectrum, and this list was used to query a nonredundant protein sequence data base (NRDB, >650,000 entries) at the European Bioinformatics Institute (Hinxton, UK). Correlating the measured peptide masses with theoretical digests of all proteins present in the data base did not lead to the identification of a protein. Therefore, the isolated protein was subjected to nanoelectrospray tandem mass spectrometry (33Wilm M. Shevchenko A. Houthaeve T. Breit S. Schweigerer L. Fotsis T. Mann M. Nature. 1996; 379: 466-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (1507) Google Scholar). Protein digests were desalted and concentrated using microcolumns packed with approximately 100 nl of POROS R2 perfusion chromatography material (Perseptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA). Peptides were eluted with 60% MeOH/5% HCOOH directly into nanospray capillaries (MDS Proteomics, Odense, Denmark). Peptide sequencing by tandem mass spectrometry was performed using a nanoelectrospray ion source (MDS Proteomics) coupled to a quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (QSTAR, Sciex, Toronto, Canada). The sequence and mass information contained in the tandem mass spectra were assembled into peptide sequence tags (34Mann M. Wilm M. Anal. Chem. 1994; 66: 4390-4399Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar) and used for queries in the NRDB and dbEST (expressed sequence tags data base, NCBI). Proteins/ESTs were identified by comparing the retrieved sequences with the mass spectrometric data. All data base searches were performed using the program Pepsea (MDS Proteomics). This procedure led to the identification of ESTs that represent parts of the 1G8 sequence that were subsequently used for cloning. Based on these data, it was sufficient to perform MALDI mass spectrometry to identify the 4C10-immunoprecipitated protein as the 1G8 antigen. This second approach was done by TopLab (Martinsried, Germany). Mass spectrometric data of immunoisolated proteins were applied in EST data base searches, ESTs of interest were sequenced, and the retrieved sequences were aligned with each other, with mouse genomic sequences, or with sequences of homologous proteins. This led to the identification of an EST clone containing an open reading frame of 1185 bp coding for a protein sequence that was covered to 49% by all MS generated sequence data. The sequence and its expression in bEnd.3 cells were confirmed by amplifying the corresponding cDNA by reverse transcription-PCR from total RNA of bEnd.3 cells; using the sense primer (5′-GCG GGTACC CTC CCT GAG TAC TCC GGG CC-3′) and the antisense primer (5′-GCG AAGCTT ACA CAA GAG ACC CA CCT GAC T-3′) yielded a single 1.2-kilobase pair product that was subcloned into the pCR®2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) after the addition of 3′A overhangs with Platinum Taq (Invitrogen). DNA sequence analysis on an ABI-377 automated DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) confirmed that the EST contained start and stop codons. Full-length ESAM eukaryotic expression vectors were constructed by cloning theEcoRI/XbaI insert of EST (AA472099) into corresponding sites of pCMV5 (pCMV5-ESAM) and pcDNA3 (pcDNA3-ESAM). C-terminally truncated ESAM (amino acid residues 1–389, referred to as pcDNA3-ESAM antigen/Δ5) was cloned by PCR using pcDNA3-ESAM as template and the sense primer (5′-GCG CCA TGG GAA GCA AGA CCT TGG AAG AGC TG-3′) and antisense primer (5′-GCG TCT AGA CTA CTG ACT CTG TGC AGG CAC C-3′). The PCR product was subcloned into the pCR®2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) after the addition of 3′A overhangs with platinum Taq (Invitrogen). After digestion of the plasmid with EcoRV/XbaI, the insert was ligated into corresponding sites of pcDNA-ESAM. Expression vectors encoding fragments of murine ZO-1 (ZO-1/1–3, ZO-1/6–1256), AF-6 (AF-6/full-length), and ASIP (ASIP/full-length) were described previously (20Ebnet K. Suzuki A. Horikoshi Y.

Expression vectors encoding the PDZ domains of ZO-2 (ZO-2/1–3) and ZO-3 (ZO-3/1–3) were generated by subcloning amino acid residues 1–636 of ZO-2 or amino acid residues 1–495 of ZO-3 into pSecTag (Invitrogen). The cloned cDNAs encoding canine ZO-2 and ZO-3 were kindly provided by Dr. B. Stevenson. A cDNA fragment coding for the extracellular part of ESAM covering amino acid residues 1–249 (bp 1–747) was amplified from pCMV5-ESAM using the BamHI site containing sense oligonucleotide 5′-CG GGATCC ATG ATT CTT CAG GCT GGA AC-3′ and the EcoRI site containing antisense oligonucleotide 5′-G GAATTC ACTTACCT TTG GAC CCT GTC ATC ACG-3′. The product was inserted in a pcDNA3 vector in frame and upstream of a fragment of human IgG1 covering bases 553–1803 (hinge, CH2, CH3). Prokaryotic expression vectors encoding the C termini of JAM, claudin-1, and claudin-5 fused to GST were described previously (20Ebnet K. Suzuki A. Horikoshi Y. Hirose T. Meyer-zu-Brickwedde M.-K. Ohno S. Vestweber D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3738-3748Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). GST-ESAM antigen was generated by cloning a cDNA fragment coding for the cytoplasmic part of ESAM (amino acid residues 278–394) into pGEX-KG (36Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1640) Google Scholar). The respective fragment was generated from total RNA of bEND.3 cells by reverse transcription-PCR using the XhoI site-containing sense primer (5′-GCG CTCGAG AGC AAG ACC TTG GAA GAG CTG-3′) and theHindIII site-containing antisense primer (5′-GCG AAGCTT ACA CAA GAG ACC CA CCT GAC T-3′). For generation of rabbit antibodies against the cytoplasmic part of ESAM, prokaryotic GST and MBP (mannose-binding protein) fusion proteins were generated that contained the truncated cytoplasmic part of ESAM lacking the 21 C-terminal amino acids, which show high homology to mCAR. For construction of GST-ESAM-21 and MBP-ESAM-21 (amino acid residues 278–373), the respective fragment of ESAM was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the XhoI site-containing sense primer (5′-GCG CTCGAG AGC AAG ACC TTG GAA GAG CTG-3′) and theHindIII site-containing antisense primer (5′-GCG AAGCTT AAG CAG AAG AAG AAA CCC CAC C-3′) and subcloned into the pGEX-KG vector or into the pMal-c2 vector, respectively (New England Biolabs, Frankfurt, Germany). The following cells were used: murine endothelioma bEnd.3 derived from brain capillaries (37Williams R.L. Risau W. Zerwes H.G. Drexler H. Aguzzi A. Wagner E.F.

All of these cells as well as the myeloma cell line SP2/0 and the hybridomas were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine (for myEnd, additionally 1 mm sodium pyruvate), and penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in a 10% CO2 atmosphere. MDCK C7 cells representing a high resistance subclone of MDCK cells (38Gekle M. Wunsch S. Oberleithner H. Silbernagl S. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J.

Stable transfectants of MDCK C7, expressing full-length ESAM or C-terminally truncated ESAM (ESAM/Δ5) were 5selected and cultured in medium as described above containing 800 μg/ml G418 (PAN Biotech, Aidenbach, Germany). CHO dhfr− cells were maintained in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin. Stable transfected CHO dhfr− cells expressing full-length ESAM or ESAM-IgG were grown in α-minimal essential medium as described above supplemented with 800 μg/ml active G418. For the production of ESAM-IgG fusion protein, the same medium with ultralow IgG-fetal calf serum was used (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany). CHO dhfr− cells were transfected with 20 μg of ESAM-IgG plasmid or pcDNA3 full-length ESAM by electroporation. Stable transfectants were selected with 800 μg/ml G418 (PAN Biotech, Aidenbach, Germany) and maintained in the continuous presence of the selecting drug. Stable transfectants of MDCK C7 expressing full-length ESAM or C-terminally truncated ESAM (ESAM/Δ5) were generated using the same protocol. Mouse peripheral blood leukocytes were isolated and separated by density gradient centrifugation (Histopaque; Sigma) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Platelet-rich plasma was obtained from 1 ml of acid citrate dextrose-anticoagulated mouse blood, diluted 1:1 with PBS, pH 7.7, and centrifuged for 10 min at 40 × gat room temperature. The platelets were either left unstimulated or activated with thrombin (1 unit/ml) for 5 min at room temperature in the presence of glycine-proline-arginine-proline (1.25 mm) (Bachem) to prevent fibrin polymerization as described (40Frenette P.

The platelets were fixed with Cell Fix (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA) for 30 min at room temperature and washed with PBS. The staining was done with the following antibodies: RB40 (anti-mouse P-selectin), VE-2, VE-19 (rabbit polyclonal anti-mouse ESAM antibodies), 1G8, 4C10 (rat monoclonal anti-ESAM antibodies), fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated clone MWReg30 (rat IgG1 mAb against mouse CD41), fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated clone R3–34 (isotype standard rat IgG1), V7C7 (rat IgG2b mAb against mouse endomucin), and V1G5 (rat anti-mouse PECAM-1). All primary antibodies were used at a concentration of 10 μg/ml. As secondary antibodies dichlorotriazinyl amino fluorescein- and phycoerythrin-conjugated donkey anti-rat (H + L) and phycoerythrin-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) were used at a dilution of 1:100. All antibody incubations were performed for 30 min at room temperature. Cells metabolically labeled with [35S] methionine/cysteine were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed directly in the culture dish in lysis buffer (see above).

https://openalex.org/W2104789070,"Netrins are chemotropic guidance cues that attract or repel growing axons during development. DCC (deleted in colorectalcancer), a transmembrane protein that is a receptor for netrin-1, is implicated in mediating both responses. However, the mechanism by which this is achieved remains unclear. Here we report that Rho GTPases are required for embryonic spinal commissural axon outgrowth induced by netrin-1. Using N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells, we found that both Rac1 and Cdc42 activities are required for DCC-induced neurite outgrowth. In contrast, down-regulation of RhoA and its effector Rho kinase stimulates the ability of DCC to induce neurite outgrowth. In Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts, DCC was found to trigger actin reorganization through activation of Rac1 but not Cdc42 or RhoA. We detected that stimulation of DCC receptors with netrin-1 resulted in a 4-fold increase in Rac1 activation. These results implicate the small GTPases Rac1, Cdc42, and RhoA as essential components that participate in signaling the response of axons to netrin-1 during neural development.

These results implicate the small GTPases Rac1, Cdc42, and RhoA as essential components that participate in signaling the response of axons to netrin-1 during neural development. Netrins are a small family of secreted proteins that guide growing axons during neural development (1.Tessier-Lavigne M. Goodman C.S. Science. 1996; 274: 1123-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (2693) Google Scholar, 2.Kennedy T.E. Tessier-Lavigne M. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1995; 5: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The first netrin cloned, UNC-6, was identified using a genetic screen for mutations affecting axon guidance in Caenorhabditis elegans (3.Ishii N. Wadsworth W.G. Stern B.D. Culotti J.G. Hedgecock E.M. Neuron. 1992; 9: 873-881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Netrins were first identified in vertebrates on the basis of their ability to promote commissural axon outgrowth from explants of embryonic spinal cord (4.Kennedy T.E. Serafini T. de la Torre J.R. Tessier-Lavigne M. Cell. 1994; 78: 425-435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1135) Google Scholar,5.Serafini T. Kennedy T.E. Galko M.J. Mirzayan C. Jessell T.M. Tessier-Lavigne M. Cell. 1994; 78: 409-424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar). Netrin family members have now been identified in multiple vertebrate and invertebrate species and shown to have a highly conserved function as axon guidance cues (6.Chisholm A. Tessier-Lavigne M. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1999; 9: 603-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Netrins are bifunctional molecules attracting and repelling different classes of axons. Growth cone attraction mediated by netrin-1 involves the transmembrane netrin receptor DCC (7.Keino-Masu K. Masu M. Hinck L. Leonardo E.D. Chan S.S.-Y. Culotti J.G. Tessier-Lavigne M.

Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 609-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In C. elegans, the identification of UNC-5 first implicated it as a receptor required for the repellent response to UNC-6 (9.Leung-Hagesteijn C. Spence A.M. Stern B.D. Shou Y. Su M.-W. Hedgecock E.M. Culotti J.G. Cell. 1992; 71: 289-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Three UNC-5 homologs have now been identified in mammals (10.Leonardo E.D. Hinck L. Masu M.

Nature. 1997; 866: 838-842Crossref Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Current evidence suggests that netrin-mediated repulsion requires the function of both UNC-5 and DCC family members in some and perhaps all cases, suggesting that UNC-5 and DCC may form a netrin receptor complex (12.Hong K. Hinck L. Nishiyama M. Poo M. Tessier-Lavigne M. Stein E. Cell. 1999; 97: 927-941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). The intracellular mechanisms mediating the response of an axon to netrin-1 are currently unclear. Previous studies indicate that extracellular guidance cues induce the neuronal growth cone to advance, retract, or turn by regulating the actin cytoskeleton within the growth cone (13.Suter D.M. Forscher P. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 106-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The Rho family of small GTPases, in particular, RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42, are well established regulators of actin reorganization in non-neuronal cells (14.Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5220) Google Scholar), and there is now compelling evidence demonstrating roles for RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 as signaling elements within the neuronal growth cone (15.Luo L. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 1: 173-180Crossref Scopus (836) Google Scholar, 16.Dickson B.J. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Here, we report that members of the Rho family of GTPases are required for commissural axon outgrowth produced by netrin-1 from explants of embryonic rat spinal cord. Both Rac1 and Cdc42 are required for neurite outgrowth promoted by DCC in N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells, and in contrast, inhibition of RhoA and Rho kinase increases the ability of DCC to induce neurite outgrowth. In Swiss 3T3 cells, DCC was found to trigger actin reorganization through activation of Rac1 in a netrin-1-dependent manner. In fibroblasts, DCC did not activate Cdc42 or RhoA. Embryonic day 13 rat dorsal spinal cord and floor plate explants were dissected and cultured in three-dimensional collagen gels as described (5.Serafini T. Kennedy T.E. Galko M.J. Mirzayan C. Jessell T.M. Tessier-Lavigne M. Cell. 1994; 78: 409-424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar). Recombinant chick netrin-1 protein was produced and purified as described (5.Serafini T. Kennedy T.E. Galko M.J. Mirzayan C. Jessell T.M. Tessier-Lavigne M. Cell. 1994; 78: 409-424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar). Toxin B was purified as previously described (17.Just I. Selzer J. Wilm M. von Eichel-Streiber C. Mann M. Aktories K. Nature. 1995; 375: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar). Both netrin-1 protein and toxin B were added to the culture medium at the beginning of the culture period. The explants were cultured for 14 h, then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and photographed with an Optronics MagnaFire camera and a Carl Zeiss Axiovert microscope using a 20× objective lens and phase contrast 5optics. The length of axon fascicles growing out of the explants were quantified using Northern Eclipse Software (Empix Imaging). The total length of fascicle growth was then calculated for each explant. Standard DNA protocols were used as described (18.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 1.53-1.105Google Scholar). pRK5-DCC-C (3394–4690 bp) was generated by digestion of pBS-DCC with EcoRI and BglII followed by ligation of a EcoRI-BglII fragment into pRK5 digested with EcoRI and BamHI. To generate pRK5 encoding full-length DCC, a fragment (3061 bp) from the start codon to the EcoRI site of pBS-DCC was amplified by PCR and subcloned into pRK5-DCC-C digested with EcoRI. pDCC-E encoding the N terminus of DCC (1122 amino acids) comprising the extracellular and transmembrane domains tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP) 1The abbreviations used are: GFPgreen fluorescent proteinRTreverse transcriptaseWASPWiskott-Aldrich syndrome proteinGSTglutathione S-transferase at its C terminus was kindly provided by Dr. Tim Kennedy (McGill University).

The primers were annealed at 60 °C, and 35 cycles of amplification were carried out. The size of the predicted amplification product is indicated. Mouse fibroblast Swiss 3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum and antibiotics and maintained in an atmosphere of 10% CO2. Confluent serum-starved Swiss 3T3 cells were prepared as described (19.Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3076) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were plated in 5% serum at a density of 6 × 104 onto acid-washed coverslips. 7–10 days later, the cells became quiescent and were subjected to serum starvation for 16 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2 g/liter NaHCO3. The eukaryotic expression vector pRK5 encoding full-length DCC or truncated DCC (pRK5-DCC-C) was microinjected alone or with pRK5 encoding Myc-tagged Cdc42N17, RacN17, or pEFmyc-C3 transferase at 0.1 mg/ml into the nucleus of ∼100 cells over a period of 20 min in CO2-independent medium (Invitrogen) using an Eppendorf microinjection system 5246. pDCC-E or pEGFP were microinjected at 0.1 mg/ml into the nucleus of ∼100 cells. During microinjection, the cells were maintained at 37 °C within a humidified atmosphere. The cells were returned to the incubator for a further 5 h followed by the addition of purified netrin-1 at 500 ng/ml for up to 30 min. N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells and COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics at 10% CO2. N1E-115 cells were plated onto coverslips previously coated with laminin (20 μg/ml; VWR Canlab) for 24 h at 37 °C, washed twice with water, and left to air dry. Transfection was carried out with LipofectAMINE transfection reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, the cells were incubated in serum-free medium for 1 h. During this time, pRK5, pRK5-DCC-C, pDCC-E, pRK5-DCC (0.4 μg) with or without pRK5myc-RacN17 or -Cdc42N17, or pEFmyc-C3 transferase (0.2 μg) were mixed with LipofectAMINE reagent and incubated for 15 min at room temperature followed by the addition of the transfection mix to the cells. 6 h later, the transfection mix was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal calf serum and incubated for 12 h with or without the blocking antibodies PN3 against netrin-1 (25 μg/ml) (52.Manitt C. Colicos M.A. Thompson K.M. Rousselle E. Peterson A.C. Kennedy T.E. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 3911-3922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (provided by Dr. Tim Kennedy) and DCC (10 μg/ml) (AF5, Cedarlane Laboratories, Ltd.) or mouse IgG (25 μg/ml) before fixation in freshly prepared 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde for 10 min. When indicated, the cells transfected with pRK5 or pRK5-DCC were incubated with 10 μm Y-27632 compound for 2 h before fixation. COS-7 cells were transfected using the DEAE-dextran method as described previously (20.Olson M.F. Ashworth A. Hall A. Science. 1995; 269: 1270-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar). The amounts of plasmid used per 100-mm dish were as follows: pRK5, 5 μg; pRK5-DCC, 5 μg; and pRK5myc-Rac1 or -Cdc42, 1.5 μg. 24 h after transfection, the cells were serum-starved overnight and treated with netrin-1 (500 ng/ml) for different periods of time. At the indicated times, microinjected Swiss 3T3 cells or transfected N1E-115 cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed for 10 min in freshly prepared 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde. All steps were carried out at room temperature, and coverslips were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline between each of the step. The cells were permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min, and free aldehyde groups were reduced with 0.5 mg/ml sodium borohydride for 10 min. The cells were double labeled following the procedure previously described (21.Nobes C.D. Hawkins P. Stephens L.A.H. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 225-233Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were incubated with the primary monoclonal antibodies anti-DCC (Pharmingen, G97-449), anti-Myc (a generous gift from Dr. Nicole Beauchemin, McGill University), or anti-GFP (Molecular Probe) diluted in phosphate-buffered saline for 60 min. Then coverslips were transferred to a second antibody mixture composed of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Sigma) and tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-conjugated phalloidin (Sigma) for 60 min. In N1E-115 cells, a neurite was defined as a process that measured at least the length of the cell body and stained positively for neurofilament M using a polyclonal anti-neurofilament 150 (Chemicon). Coverslips were mounted by inverting them onto 8 μl of Mowiol (Calbiochem) mountant containingp-phenylenediamine as an anti-bleach reagent. After 2 h at room temperature, the coverslips were examined on a Zeiss Axiovert 135 microscope using Zeiss oil immersion 63× objective lens. Fluorescence images were recorded using a digital camera (DVC) and analyzed with Northern Eclipse software (Empix Imaging Inc.). GST-PAK (amino acids 56–272) and GST-WASP (amino acids 201–321) were used to isolate GTP-bound Rac1 and Cdc42, respectively. Escherichia colitransformed with GST-PAK and GST-WASP constructs were grown at 37 °C to an absorbance of 0.5. Expression of the fusion proteins was induced by isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (1 mm) for 3 h at 37 °C. The cells were washed once in STE buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) prior to sonication in buffer A (20 mmHepes, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The lysates were cleared by centrifugation, and Nonidet P-40 was added to a final concentration of 0.5%. The proteins were stored at −80 °C until use. Protein concentration was determined by comparison with different amounts of bovine serum albumin using SDS-PAGE. For each sample, 10–15 μg of GST-PAK or GST-WASP was purified using glutathione-Sepharose beads (Sigma) for 30 min at 4 °C. The beads were washed twice with buffer A, and the protein lysates were added as described below. COS-7 cells cotransfected with pRK5 encoding DCC and Myc-tagged Rac1 or Cdc42 were serum-starved overnight and treated with purified netrin-1 for different periods of time. The cells were lysed in 25 mmHepes, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. The protein concentrations were determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit. An equal amount of proteins was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with GST-PAK or GST-WASP (10–15 μg) purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads in binding buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 30 mm MgCl2, 40 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmdithiothreitol) as described (22.Royal I. Lamarche-Vane N. Lamorte L. Kaibuchi K. Park M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1709-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The beads were washed three times with washing buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 30 mmMgCl2, 40 mm NaCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol) and twice with washing buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40 before being boiled in SDS sample buffer. The proteins were separated on 12% SDS-PAGE. GTP-bound Rac1 and Cdc42 were revealed by immunoblotting using the anti-Myc antibody and ECL reagent detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). The levels of GTP-bound Rac1 and Cdc42 in each sample were assessed using densitometry. To determine whether Rho GTPases are involved in mediating the axon outgrowth promoting activity of netrin-1, we examined the effect of adding the Rho GTPase inhibitor toxin B to explants of E13 rat dorsal spinal cord cultured in a three-dimensional collagen gel in the presence of netrin-1. Explants of dorsal spinal cord cultured in the presence of recombinant netrin-1 (200 ng/ml) produced maximal commissural axon outgrowth from these explants as previously reported (4.Kennedy T.E. Serafini T. de la Torre J.R. Tessier-Lavigne M. Cell. 1994; 78: 425-435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1135) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1,A and C). The addition of increasing concentrations of toxin B from 0.001 to 1 ng/ml in the presence of maximal concentrations of netrin-1 resulted in increasing inhibition of commissural axon outgrowth from explants (Fig. 1, A andD–G). In the presence of toxin B, cells at the edge of the explants were clearly rounded (Fig. 1 E,arrowhead), a characteristic effect of toxin B on other cell types (23.Aktories K. Schmidt G. Just I. Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 421-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In addition, although a small amount of axon outgrowth occurred at higher concentrations of toxin B, the axons were much less fasciculated than normal (Fig. 1, compare C withD and E). These findings indicate that netrin-1-mediated commissural axon outgrowth requires the activity of one or more Rho GTPases. Mouse N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells exhibit neurite outgrowth in response to serum deprivation (24.Jalink K. Vancorven E.J. Hengeveld T. Morii N. Narumiya S. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 801-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Using immunoblotting analyses, N1E-115 cells were found to constitutively express netrin-1. However, these cells did not express DCC (Fig. 2 A). RT-PCR analysis revealed the expression of mRNAs encoding the netrin-1 receptors UNC5 h1 and UNC5 h2 but not DCC (Fig. 2 B). In the presence of 5% serum, the cells are round and extend lamellipodia and multiple filopodia (Fig. 3 G). When DCC is expressed in N1E-115 cells in the presence of 5% serum, 62% of transfected cells exhibited neurite outgrowth (Fig. 4). The majority of DCC-expressing cells contained one long neurite (∼30 μm) per cell with thin filopodia along the neurite (Fig. 3, A and B). DCC protein was consistently enriched at the extending tip of the neurite as shown in Fig. 3 A (arrow). The presence of antibodies blocking the function of DCC or netrin-1 inhibited the ability of DCC to induce neurite outgrowth in N1E-115 cells (Fig. 4). In addition, truncated DCC proteins lacking the majority of the extracellular domain (DCC-C) or the cytoplasmic domain (DCC-E) of DCC were unable to produce neurite outgrowth (Fig. 4). These results strongly suggest that netrin-1 binding to DCC is necessary to mediate intracellular signaling events leading to neurite outgrowth in N1E-115 cells.Figure 3DCC-induced neurite outgrowth requires Rac1 and Cdc42 activity in N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells. N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells were transfected either with empty vector pRK5 (G) or pRK5-DCC alone (A and B) or with pRK5myc-RacN17 (C and D) or pRK5myc-Cdc42N17 (E and F). F-actin (B, D,F, and G) was visualized with fluorescently tagged phalloidin, and DCC (A, C, andE) was revealed by costaining with an anti-DCC antibody and by indirect immunofluorescence. The expression of Myc-tagged RacN17 and Cdc42N17 was detected using anti-Myc antibodies and by indirect immunofluorescence. Scale bars, 10 μm.

When indicated, the cells transfected with pRK5 or pRK5-DCC were treated with 10 μmof Y-27632 compound for 2 h prior to fixation, with the blocking antibodies against netrin-1 (PN3) and DCC (AF5), or with mouse IgG as a negative control. F-actin, DCC, and Myc-tagged proteins were visualized as described in the legend to Fig. 3. DCC lacking the majority of the extracellular domain (DCC-C) was revealed with the anti-DCC antibody (Pharmingen) raised against the intracellular domain of DCC. DCC lacking the cytoplasmic domain (DCC-E) tagged at its C terminus with GFP was visualized with anti-GFP antibodies. The values indicate the percentages of transfected cells with neurite extension and correspond to the averages of at least three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) C3 transferase has been shown to inactivate RhoA by ADP-ribosylation at residue Asn41 (23.Aktories K. Schmidt G. Just I. Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 421-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). When C3 transferase is expressed in N1E-115 cells, 50% of transfected cells showed neurite outgrowth as previously reported (53.Kozma R. Sarner S. Ahmed S. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1201-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4). When DCC is expressed in the presence of C3 transferase, the number of transfected cells with neurite outgrowth increased to 80% (Fig. 4). Similarly, when DCC-expressing cells are incubated with the Y-27632 compound that inhibits the Rho effector Rho kinase, neurite outgrowth is stimulated in more than 80% of transfected cells (Fig. 4). These results suggest that inhibition of RhoA and its effector Rho kinase known to mediate the effects of RhoA on neurite retraction in N1E-115 cells (51.Hirose M. Ishizaki T. Watanabe N. Uehata M. Kranenburg O. Moolenaar W.H. Matsumura H. Maekawa M. Bito H. Narumiya S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1625-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar) increases the ability of DCC to stimulate neurite extension in N1E-115 cells. Expression plasmids encoding dominant negative RacN17 or Cdc42N17 were transfected together with pRK5-DCC into N1E-115 cells. As shown in Fig. 3 (D and F), both dominant negative Rac1 and Cdc42 significantly inhibited neurite outgrowth induced by DCC. In DCC-expressing cells, the dominant negative Rac1 and Cdc42 mutants reduced neurite extension by 55 and 45%, respectively (Fig. 4). Cells expressing both RacN17 and DCC were rounded and flattened and exhibited long filopodia but not lamellipodia. These findings suggest that although Rac1 has been inhibited, Cdc42 remained activated in these cells (Fig. 3 D). Cells expressing both Cdc42N17 and DCC exhibited lamellipodia and short microspikes at the plasma membrane, suggesting that Rac1 remained activated in these cells (Fig. 3 F). Therefore, both Rac1 and Cdc42 activities are required for neurite outgrowth induced by DCC in N1E-115 cells. To further dissect the mechanisms used by netrin-1 to signal through Rho GTPases, we reconstituted the phenomenon in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts by transiently expressing DCC and using the organization of the actin cytoskeleton as a functional read-out. Following serum starvation, Swiss 3T3 cells lose most of the actin based structures usually found in a fibroblast: lamellipodia, filopodia, and stress fibers. However, the cells do remain attached to the supporting extracellular matrix (Fig. 5 A). Microinjection of constitutively active Cdc42L61, RacL61, and RhoL63 proteins into quiescent, serum-starved Swiss 3T3 cells has been shown to rapidly induce the formation of three distinct actin based structures: filopodia, lamellipodia, and stress fibers, respectively (19.Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3076) Google Scholar, 25.Ridley A.J. Hall A.

Ahmed S. Best A. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1942-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar). In addition, in some cell types, such as fibroblasts and epithelial cells, activation of Cdc42 leads to rapid activation of Rac1, which in turn leads to activation of RhoA (26.Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3734) Google Scholar). Netrin-1 and DCC proteins were undetectable by Western blot analyses of Swiss 3T3 cell lysates (Fig. 2 A). RT-PCR analyses detected the expression of mRNAs encoding UNC5 h2 but not UNC5 h1 or DCC. As shown in Fig. 5 B, the addition of recombinant netrin-1 protein does not affect the reorganization of polymerized actin in uninjected cells. Microinjection of the eukaryotic expression vector, pRK5, encoding full-length rat DCC into quiescent, serum-starved Swiss 3T3 cells led to the expression of DCC (Fig. 5 C), and no spontaneous reorganization of actin was observed (Fig. 5 D). However, 10 min after the addition of 500 ng/ml of purified netrin-1 to the medium, assemblies of polymerized actin were detected at the leading edge of the plasma membrane in DCC expressing cells. These developed into lamellipodia and membrane ruffles as shown in Fig. 5 F(arrows). The minimum concentration of netrin-1 required to cause actin reorganization in DCC expressing cells was 100 ng/ml (data not shown). However, optimal effects were obtained at 500 ng/ml of netrin-1. 30 min after the addition of netrin-1, in cells expressing DCC, actin assembled into stress fibers that traverse the cell (Fig. 5 H). Recently, it has been reported that netrin-1 binds to the extracellular domain of DCC (28.Stein E. Zou Y. Poo M. Tessier-Lavigne M. Science. 2001; 291: 1976-1982Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). A truncated DCC protein lacking the majority of the extracellular domain did not induce actin reorganization after the addition of netrin-1 for 30 min, suggesting that netrin-1 binding to DCC is essential to activate Rho GTPase signaling pathways (Fig. 6 B). Similarly, the expression of a truncated DCC protein lacking the cytoplasmic domain and coupled to green fluorescent protein did not lead to actin reorganization after the addition of netrin-1 (Fig. 6 D). We conclude that DCC is essential to activate the cascade of Rho GTPases in Swiss 3T3 cells in a ligand-dependent manner.Figure 6Netrin-1 binding to DCC is essential to mediate actin reorganization in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts.Serum-starved Swiss 3T3 cells microinjected with pRK5-DCC-C (A and B), with pDCC-E (C andD), or with pEGFP (E and F) were fixed after addition of 500 ng/ml recombinant netrin-1 for 30 min. F-Actin (B, D, and F) and DCC-C (A) were visualized as in Fig. 3. DCC-E fused to GFP at its C terminus (C) and GFP (E) were visualized using anti-GFP antibodies and indirect fluorescence. Approximately 100 cells were microinjected per coverslip, and 5 h after injection, 90% of the injected cells showed expression of DCC. Scale bars, 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether DCC activates the cascade of Rho GTPases through Cdc42 or Rac1 in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts, we microinjected quiescent, serum-starved Swiss 3T3 cells with pRK5-DCC together with eukaryotic vectors encoding either Myc-tagged dominant negative RacN17 or Cdc42N17 or C3 transferase. As shown in Fig. 7, the expression of dominant negative Cdc42N17 did not inhibit actin reorganization induced by netrin-1 in DCC-expressing cells (Fig. 7, compare D with B), whereas dominant negative RacN17 inhibited the formation of both lamellipodia and stress fibers (Fig. 7 F). C3 transferase blocked the formation of stress fibers but not the formation of polymerized actin at the leading edge of the plasma membrane (Fig. 7 H). Hence, DCC activates Rac1-induced signaling pathways but not Cdc42-dependent signals in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts. These findings indicate that in these cells, activation of RhoA by DCC is a consequence of cross-talk between Rac1 and RhoA. Pull-down assays were carried out in which Rac1 and Cdc42 GTP loading was assessed by specific binding of the active GTPases to the Cdc42/Rac interactive binding domain (29.Burbelo P.D. Drechsel D.

Several non-peptide CGRP receptor antagonists have been shown to exhibit marked species selectivity, with >100-fold higher affinities for the human CGRP receptor than for receptors from other species (Doods, H., Hallermayer, G., Wu, D., Entzeroth, M., Rudolf, K., Engel, W., and Eberlein, W. (2000) Br. J. Pharmacol. 129, 420–423; Edvinsson, L., Sams, A., Jansen-Olesen, I., Tajti, J., Kane, S. A., Rutledge, R. Z., Koblan, K. S., Hill, R. G., and Longmore, J. (2001) Eur. J. Pharmacol. 415, 39–44). This observation provided an opportunity to map the determinants of receptor affinity exhibited by BIBN4096BS and the truncated analogs, Compounds 1 and 2. All three compounds exhibited higher affinity for the human receptor, human CRLR/human RAMP1, than for the rat receptor, rat CRLR/rat RAMP1. We have now demonstrated that this species selectivity was directed exclusively by RAMP1. By generating recombinant human/rat CRLR/RAMP1 receptors, we demonstrated that co-expression of human CRLR with rat RAMP1 produced rat receptor pharmacology, and vice versa. Moreover, with rat/human RAMP1 chimeras and site-directed mutants, we have identified a single amino acid at position 74 of RAMP1 that modulates the affinity of small molecule antagonists for CRLR/RAMP1. Replacement of lysine 74 in rat RAMP1 with tryptophan (the homologous amino acid in the human receptor) resulted in a ≥100-fold increase in antagonist affinities, similar to theKi values for the human receptor. These observations suggest that important determinants of small molecule antagonist affinity for the CGRP receptor reside within the extracellular region of RAMP1 and provide evidence that this receptor accessory protein may participate in antagonist binding.

CGRP is a 37-amino acid neuropeptide that is expressed in a variety of cell types in both the central and peripheral nervous systems (5.Van Rossum D. Hanisch U.-K. Quirion R. Neurosci. Biobehav. Rev. 1997; 21: 649-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). In many tissues, CGRP-containing fibers are closely associated with blood vessels (6.Mulderry P.K. Ghatei M.A. Rodrigo J. Allen J.M. Rosenfeld M.G. Polak J.M. Bloom S.R. Neuroscience. 1985; 14: 947-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Among the various physiological functions reported for CGRP, the most pronounced is vasodilation. CGRP is the most powerful of the vasodilator transmitters (7.Brain S.D. Williams T.J. Tippins J.R. Morris H.R. MacIntyre I. Nature. 1985; 313: 54-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (1798) Google Scholar), and its vasoactive effects have been demonstrated in a variety of blood vessels (8.Jansen I. Nilsson L. Edvinsson L. Edvinsson L. Uddman R. Vascular Innervation and Receptor Mechanisms. Academic Press, 1993: 263-279Crossref Google Scholar), including those in the cerebral, coronary, and mesenteric vasculature.Mounting evidence suggests that CGRP is involved in the pathophysiology of migraine headache (9.Goadsby P.J. Poyer D. Marshall I. Brain S.D. The CGRP Family: Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (CGRP), Amylin and Adrenomedullin. Landes Bioscience, Georgetown, TX2000: 159-166Google Scholar). Migraine is thought to be associated with dilation of cerebral blood vessels and activation of the trigeminovascular system (10.May A. Goadsby P.J. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1999; 19: 115-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). During the headache phase of a migraine, CGRP levels are elevated in the cranial circulation (11.Goadsby P.J. Edvinsson L. Ekman R. Ann. Neurol. 1990; 28: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar, 12.Goadsby P.J. Edvinsson L. Ann. Neurol. 1993; 33: 48-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar). Successful treatment of the headache with sumatriptan resulted in normalization of CGRP levels (12.Goadsby P.J. Edvinsson L. Ann. Neurol. 1993; 33: 48-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar), thus implicating CGRP in the pathophysiology of this disorder. Moreover, intravenous administration of CGRP to migraineurs induced a delayed migrainous headache in some patients (13.Lassen L.H. Jacobsen V.B. Pedersen P.A. Sperling B. Iversen H.K. Olesen J. Eur. J. Neurol. 1998; 5: S63Google Scholar). These observations suggest that inhibition of CGRP-mediated vasodilation may have therapeutic utility in the treatment of migraine.Research in the area of CGRP has intensified in recent years due in large part to the identification of its receptor, CRLR 1The abbreviations used are: CRLRcalcitonin receptor-like receptorhCRLRhuman CRLRrCRLRrat CRLRRAMPreceptor activity-modifying proteinhRAMPhuman RAMPrRAMPrat RAMPGPCRG-protein-coupled receptorhCGRPhuman CGRP1The abbreviations used are: CRLRcalcitonin receptor-like receptorhCRLRhuman CRLRrCRLRrat CRLRRAMPreceptor activity-modifying proteinhRAMPhuman RAMPrRAMPrat RAMPGPCRG-protein-coupled receptorhCGRPhuman CGRP(14.Aiyar N.

Roos B.A. Dickerson I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3455-3460Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). CGRP activity is mediated by the Gs-coupled G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), CRLR, which shares 55% homology with the calcitonin receptor. In an elegant study, McLatchie et al. (1.McLatchie L.M. Fraser N.J. Main M.J. Wise A. Brown J. Thompson N. Solari R. Lee M.G. Foord S.M. Nature. 1998; 393: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (1836) Google Scholar) demonstrated that functional CGRP and adrenomedullin receptors are both derived from CRLR and that the phenotype is determined by co-expression with a particular RAMP. Co-expression of CRLR with RAMP1 results in CGRP receptor pharmacology, whereas RAMP2 or RAMP3 co-expression produces an adrenomedullin receptor. RAMPs are relatively small (148–175-amino acid) proteins containing a single predicted membrane-spanning domain, a large extracellular domain, and a short cytoplasmic domain. CRLR and RAMP1 form a 1:1 heterodimer that was recently shown to undergo internalization as a stable receptor complex in a β-arrestin- and dynamin-dependent fashion (16.Hilairet S. Bélanger C.

The molecular function of RAMPs includes cell surface targeting (17.Foord S.M. Marshall F.H. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 184-187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) and may involve direct ligand binding, indirect modulation of CRLR conformation, or both (18.Hilairet S. Foord S.M. Marshall F.H. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29575-29581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar).In the pursuit of small molecule antagonists of the CGRP receptor, CRLR/RAMP1, Doods et al. (2.Doods H. Hallermayer G. Wu D. Entzeroth M. Rudolf K. Engel W. Eberlein W. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 129: 420-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar) identified a potent and highly specific compound, BIBN4096BS (Fig. 1). BIBN4096BS demonstrated high affinity for the human CGRP receptor, with a Ki of 14 pm. Of particular interest was the observation that BIBN4096BS exhibited >100-fold lower affinity for CGRP receptors from rat, rabbit, dog, and guinea pig, although the affinity for the marmoset receptor was reported to be similar to that for human. These authors utilized marmoset for in vivostudies to evaluate the utility of BIBN4096BS as a potential anti-migraine agent. A related compound, Compound 1 (Fig. 1), was likewise shown to be a significantly more potent antagonist on human cerebral arteries than on guinea pig cerebral and porcine coronary arteries (3.Edvinsson L. Sams A. Jansen-Olesen I. Tajti J. Kane S.A. Rutledge R.Z. Koblan K.S. Hill R.G. Longmore J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 415: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 4.Hasbak P. Sams A. Schifter S. Longmore J. Edvinsson L. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 133: 1405-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar).To probe the species selectivity observed with the non-peptide antagonists BIBN4096BS and Compound 1, we chose to focus on the affinity differences seen for the human and rat CGRP receptors. In this report, we demonstrate that the small molecule antagonists, BIBN4096BS, Compound 1, and an analog, Compound 2, have different affinities for the human and rat receptors, and these differences are determined by the species origin of RAMP1 that is co-expressed with CRLR. Furthermore, through the use of chimeric RAMP1 proteins and site-directed mutagenesis, the exact residues responsible for the species selectivity have been identified. The results of this study may provide additional insight into the molecular basis of the CRLR-RAMP interaction and facilitate the future discovery of high affinity non-peptide antagonists.RESULTSSmall molecule antagonists of the CGRP receptor such as Compound 1 and BIBN4096BS exhibit species-selective pharmacology (2.Doods H. Hallermayer G. Wu D. Entzeroth M. Rudolf K. Engel W. Eberlein W. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 129: 420-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 3.Edvinsson L. Sams A. Jansen-Olesen I. Tajti J.

J. Pharmacol. 2001; 133: 1405-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). For example, BIBN4096BS was reported to exhibit >100-fold higher affinity for the human CGRP receptor than for the rat receptor (2.Doods H. Hallermayer G. Wu D. Entzeroth M. Rudolf K. Engel W. Eberlein W. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 129: 420-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). This observation led us to examine the sequences of CRLR and RAMP1 from different species. Protein sequence alignment revealed that whereas human and rat CRLR are 91% homologous, human and rat RAMP1 share only 71% homology. This observation suggested that the pharmacological differences could be a result of the sequence dissimilarity of either protein or may result from a combined effect of differences in both CRLR and RAMP1 sequences. To determine whether the species selectivity is derived from either CRLR itself or its accessory protein, RAMP1, hybrid human/rat CGRP receptors were created by transiently transfecting cDNAs coding for human CRLR with rat RAMP1 and vice versa in 293 EBNA cells. The cells were harvested, and cell membranes were prepared for subsequent competitive ligand binding experiments. As expected, the small molecule antagonists Compound 1 and BIBN4096BS had lower affinity for rCRLR/rRAMP1 than for the transfected human CGRP receptor, hCRLR/hRAMP1 (Table I). To confirm that these transiently transfected receptors exhibited physiologically relevant pharmacology, comparisons were made to native human and rat CGRP receptors found in SK-N-MC cells (20.Semark J.E. Middlemiss D.N. Hutson P.H. Mol. Neuropharmacol. 1992; 2: 311-317Google Scholar) and rat brain, respectively. As seen in Table I, similar Ki values were obtained for both Compound 1 and BIBN4096BS on native and transiently expressed receptors. In 293 EBNA membranes expressing rCRLR/rRAMP1, 125I-hCGRP binding was inhibited by Compound 1 and BIBN4096BS with Ki values of 8670 and 2.1 nm, respectively. In contrast, co-expression of rCRLR with hRAMP1 resulted in a dramatic increase in antagonist affinities, essentially yielding human-like pharmacology with Kivalues for Compound 1 and BIBN4096BS of 123 and 0.032 nm,respectively. Likewise, co-expression of hCRLR with rRAMP1 resulted inKi values that were similar to those observed for the pure rat receptor. These results demonstrated that RAMP1 determined the affinity of BIBN4096BS and Compound 1 for human and rat CGRP receptors. By contrast, the peptide antagonist CGRP8–37was not species-selective, resulting in Ki values of 1.3 and 1.2 nm for the human and rat receptors, respectively (data not shown), consistent with previous reports (2.Doods H. Hallermayer G. Wu D. Entzeroth M. Rudolf K. Engel W. Eberlein W. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 129: 420-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar,21.Longmore J. Hogg J.E. Hutson P.H. Hill R.G. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 265: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The Kd of the radioligand125I-hCGRP also was similar for both human and rat receptors, as well as for the mixed-species receptors (Supplementary Material Table SI). The species origin of CRLR in these hybrid receptors had little or no effect on the small molecule antagonist affinities.One of the demonstrated functions of RAMPs is to ensure proper cell surface targeting of CRLR. In doing so, it was originally proposed that RAMPs also serve to influence the glycosylation state of the receptor (1.McLatchie L.M. Fraser N.J. Main M.J. Wise A. Brown J. Thompson N. Solari R. Lee M.G. Foord S.M. Nature. 1998; 393: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (1836) Google Scholar). In our studies, the functional significance of glycosylation was therefore addressed because the glycosylation state of the rat CGRP receptor had not been characterized previously; furthermore, the possibility existed that co-expression of CRLR with either human or rat RAMP1 resulted in differential glycosylation of CRLR and that this effect determined the observed differences in antagonist affinities. Using an antibody to rCRLR and deglycosylation enzymes, the glycosylation state of rCRLR associated with rat or human RAMP1 was determined. The membranes from the competitive binding experiments (rCRLR/rRAMP1, rCRLR/hRAMP1, and control rCRLR/pcDNA3.1) were treated with peptide-N-glycosidase F and endoglycosidase F1. Peptide-N-glycosidase F catalyzes the hydrolysis of mature glycoproteins, whereas endoglycosidase F1 cleaves N-linked high mannose and hybrid oligosaccharides, but not complex oligosaccharides. Thus, the molecular mass of a glycosylated receptor will decrease after treatment with peptide-N-glycosidase F, and a receptor with complex glycosylation will resist endoglycosidase F1 cleavage. Co-expression of rCRLR with either human or rat RAMP1 produced species with molecular masses of 55 and 68 kDa, which were reduced to a single 42-kDa species after peptide-N-glycosidase F treatment (Fig. 2). Furthermore, the 68-kDa species represented a mature glycoprotein, as demonstrated by its resistance to endoglycosidase F1 cleavage. The negative control rCRLR alone resulted in background levels of the 55-kDa species, possibly resulting from interaction of transfected CRLR with low levels of endogenous RAMPs. The 55-kDa species likely represents a core glycosylated form of the receptor (18.Hilairet S. Foord S.M. Marshall F.H. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29575-29581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). These results indicated that the co-expression of either human or rat RAMP1 with rat CRLR resulted in similar levels of complex glycosylation.Figure 2Western blot analysis of rCRLR co-expressed with rRAMP1 and hRAMP1. The membranes from the competitive binding experiments, including rCRLR transfected with empty vector (pcDNA3.1), were treated with peptide-N-glycosidase F (F), endoglycosidase F1 (F1), or no enzyme.

To elucidate the region of RAMP1 that is directly involved in determining the affinities of BIBN4096BS and Compound 1, human/rat RAMP1 chimeras were constructed. Chimera 1 was created by replacing the first 66 amino acids of rRAMP1 with the corresponding hRAMP1 sequence. Conversely, replacement of the first 112 amino acids of rRAMP1 with the human sequence produced Chimera 2. These constructs were then used for transient transfections in similar experiments as described above. In membranes expressing rCRLR with Chimera 1, 125I-hCGRP binding was inhibited by Compound 1 and BIBN4096BS withKi values of 4704 and 2.0 nm,respectively (Table II). These results were similar to those obtained for rCRLR/rRAMP1. By contrast, when rCRLR was co-expressed with Chimera 2, the resultingKi values were similar to those obtained for hCRLR/hRAMP1. These studies demonstrated that amino acids 66–112 in the extracellular domain of RAMP1 were responsible for modulating the affinity of BIBN4096BS and Compound 1 for CRLR/RAMP1.The identification of amino acids 66–112 of RAMP1 as the critical region determining CGRP receptor pharmacology led us to examine the possibility that the species selectivity might be governed by specific amino acid residues. BIBN4096BS and Compound 1 were reported to have lower affinity for rat (2.Doods H. Hallermayer G. Wu D. Entzeroth M. Rudolf K. Engel W. Eberlein W. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 129: 420-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar) and porcine (4.Hasbak P. Sams A. Schifter S. Longmore J. Edvinsson L. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 133: 1405-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) receptors, respectively, than for the human receptor. However, high affinity binding of BIBN4096BS was reported for both human and marmoset CGRP receptors (2.Doods H. Hallermayer G. Wu D. Entzeroth M. Rudolf K. Engel W. Eberlein W. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 129: 420-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Accordingly, a partial marmoset RAMP1 cDNA was cloned, and the sequence was compared with human and other available RAMP1 sequences. Protein sequence alignment revealed numerous residues that were identical in human and marmoset but different from that found in rat, mouse, and pig (Fig. 3). However, amino acid 74 was shown to be the least-conserved residue among these species; the human and marmoset sequences contained tryptophan at this position, but a basic residue was found in the three other species. Subsequently, lysine at position 74 of rRAMP1 was replaced with the corresponding human/marmoset amino acid, tryptophan. This construct was then co-transfected with rCRLR in 293 EBNA cells. Competitive binding experiments demonstrated that human-like receptor pharmacology could be achieved by co-expression of rCRLR with rK74W RAMP1 (Table III). The affinity of BIBN4096BS increased from 2.9 nm for the rat receptor to 0.036 nm for rCRLR/rK74W RAMP1, similar to that seen for hCRLR/hRAMP1, 0.013 nm. A similar trend was observed for Compound 2. Interestingly, Compound 1 exhibited >10-fold higher affinity for the rCRLR/rK74W RAMP1 receptor than for the native human receptor, perhaps due to favorable interactions between the dibromotyrosyl moiety and the tryptophan in the RAMP1 mutant. These results suggested that the affinities of these small molecule antagonists for the CGRP receptor were heavily influenced by the nature of amino acid 74 of RAMP1.Figure 3A, alignment of amino acids 66–112 of RAMP1 from human, marmoset, rat, mouse, and pig.

RAMPs confer agonist specificity to both CRLR and the calcitonin receptor. CRLR in combination with RAMP1 binds CGRP with high affinity, whereas co-expression of CRLR with RAMP2 or RAMP3 results in high affinity adrenomedullin binding (1.McLatchie L.M. Fraser N.J. Main M.J. Wise A. Brown J. Thompson N. Solari R. Lee M.G. Foord S.M. Nature. 1998; 393: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (1836) Google Scholar). RAMPs also regulate the interaction of the calcitonin receptor with calcitonin and amylin, such that co-expression of calcitonin receptor with RAMP1 or RAMP3 results in amylin receptor pharmacology (22.Christopoulos G. Perry K.J. Morfis M. Tilakaratne N. Gao Y. Fraser N.J. Main M.J. Foord S.M. Sexton P.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). It was recently demonstrated that the peptide agonists CGRP and adrenomedullin could be cross-linked to both CRLR and the respective RAMP, an observation that suggests that RAMPs may participate directly in the agonist binding site (18.Hilairet S. Foord S.M. Marshall F.H. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29575-29581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). An alternative explanation would be that RAMPs indirectly influence agonist binding sites by altering the conformation of CRLR.Certain small molecule CGRP receptor antagonists display remarkable species selectivity, exhibiting up to 100-fold higher affinity for the human receptor than for the rat receptor. This observation is intriguing, considering the fact that the sequence homology of CRLR between these species is >90%. However, RAMP1 homology is only 71%. Using this information, we sought to determine whether the observed differences in pharmacology between the rat and human CGRP receptors for small molecule antagonists resulted uniquely from either CRLR or RAMP1. The results of the present investigation demonstrated that the pharmacology was directed exclusively by RAMP1. Moreover, through the use of human/rat chimeric RAMP1 constructs and site-directed mutagenesis, we have determined that tryptophan 74 of RAMP1 is responsible for the high affinity binding of BIBN4096BS and Compounds 1 and 2 to the human receptor.These observations have important implications for furthering our understanding of the heterodimeric CGRP receptor. CRLR is a member of the class B family of GPCRs that includes parathyroid hormone, corticotropin-releasing hormone, calcitonin, secretin, and glucagon receptors (23.Gether U. Endocr. Rev. 2000; 21: 90-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). It is well established that the large amino terminus of class B GPCRs plays a key role in agonist binding, although additional interactions with extracellular loops are still required. In the case of the CGRP receptor, RAMP1 also contains a large extracellular domain. A recent report demonstrated that CRLR and RAMP1 form a 1:1 heterodimer that is internalized as a stable receptor complex (16.Hilairet S. Bélanger C. Bertrand J. Laperrière A. Foord S.M. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42182-42190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the peptides CGRP and adrenomedullin could be cross-linked to both CRLR and RAMP1 or RAMP2, respectively (18.Hilairet S. Foord S.M. Marshall F.H. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29575-29581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), suggesting that either the accessory proteins are in close proximity to the agonist binding sites or the peptide agonists interact directly with both CRLR and RAMP. The present study has demonstrated that the Kd of the radioligand 125I-hCGRP was unaffected by the species of RAMP1 that was co-expressed with CRLR, suggesting that any potential interaction with the RAMP likely occurs through residues that are conserved between these species. The fact that the affinity of small molecule antagonists can be affected by a single amino acid change suggests that these compounds may interact directly with RAMP1. From a mechanistic standpoint, both Compound 1 and BIBN4096BS have been shown to be competitive antagonists of the CGRP receptor (2.Doods H. Hallermayer G. Wu D. Entzeroth M. Rudolf K. Engel W. Eberlein W. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 129: 420-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 3.Edvinsson L. Sams A. Jansen-Olesen I. Tajti J. Kane S.A. Rutledge R.Z. Koblan K.S. Hill R.G. Longmore J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 415: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations strongly suggest that the receptor binding sites of both CGRP and these small molecule antagonists include RAMP1. The observation that the affinity of the peptide antagonist CGRP8–37 is similar for both human and rat receptors may suggest that this antagonist does not interact with RAMP1. It is tempting, therefore, to speculate that the amino-terminal disulfide-linked ring structure of CGRP, which is lacking in the truncated antagonist CGRP8–37, makes unique contacts with RAMP1 that trigger or facilitate signal transduction by CGRP. However, the possibility that CGRP8–37 interacts with a conserved region of RAMP1 cannot be ruled out.Several potential mechanisms could account for the ability of Trp-74 of RAMP1 to confer high affinity binding to non-peptide antagonists of the human CGRP receptor. An indirect mechanism could involve modulation of the conformation of CRLR by residues in the extracellular domain of RAMP1. An alternative scenario could be envisioned whereby these antagonists interact, at least in part, with RAMP1 directly. Favorable hydrophobic interactions between Trp-74 and the antagonists could potentially account for the additional binding energy relative to that seen with Lys-74 of the rat receptor. Conversely, repulsive interactions with the charged lysine in rat RAMP1 could result in decreased antagonist affinity. An alternative model could involve the formation of a binding pocket that includes Trp-74 and other amino acids found within either CRLR or RAMP1. Identification of additional residues within the CRLR-RAMP1 heterodimer involved in binding of these small molecule antagonists remains to be determined. It should be pointed out that a tryptophan residue (Trp-33) was recently shown to confer high affinity binding to a small molecule antagonist of the class B human glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor (24.Tibaduiza E.C. Chen C. Beinborn M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37787-37793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Trp-33 is located within the amino terminus, demonstrating further that important determinants of small molecule ligand affinity may reside within the extracellular domains of class B GPCRs.Alignment of known RAMP1 sequences from other species revealed a lysine residue at position 74 of mouse RAMP1. A novel application of the present discovery would be generation of a humanized CGRP receptor mouse, wherein lysine 74 is replaced with tryptophan by homologous recombination. Such a knock-i"

However, instead of mutational inactivation, overexpression of wild-type p73 has been reported in various tumor types compared with normal tissues, arguing against a classical tumor suppressor function. Recently, N-terminally truncated, transactivation-deficient p73 isoforms (ΔTA-p73) have been identified as a second class of p73 proteins. Because overexpression of p73 in tumors includes ΔTA-p73, we further characterized these novel p73 isoforms. We show that ΔTA-p73 retains DNA-binding competence but lacks transactivation functions, resulting in an inability to induce growth arrest and apoptosis. Importantly, ΔTA-p73 acts as a dominant-negative inhibitor of p53 and full-length p73 (TA-p73). We demonstrate that inhibition of p53 involves competition for DNA binding, whereas TA-p73 can be inhibited by direct protein-protein interaction. Further, we show that up-regulation of endogenous p73 just like ectopic overexpression of ΔTA-p73 confers resistance to p53-mediated apoptosis induced by the chemotherapeutic agent H-7.

Because inhibition of p53 is a common theme in human cancer, our data strongly support a role of ΔTA-p73 expression for tumor formation. The TP53 gene was the first tumor suppressor gene to be identified and is still considered the prototypical tumor suppressor. In more than half of human tumors the TP53 gene is inactivated directly by mutations, and in many others p53 is functionally compromised epigenetically by various mechanisms (1.Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5799) Google Scholar, 2.Sherr C.J. Weber J.D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 94-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). In fact, several transforming oncogenes have been shown to be potent inhibitors of p53 (1.Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5799) Google Scholar). Loss of functional p53 therefore appears to be crucial for the development of most, if not all, cancers. Although p53 was long considered to be unique, recently two p53-related genes were discovered (3.Kaghad M. Bonnet H. Yang A. Creancier L. Biscan J.C. Valent A. Minty A. Chalon P. Lelias J.M.

TP73 andTP63 encode proteins with remarkable sequence homology to p53, suggesting that they are also involved in the regulation of cell growth and apoptosis. Indeed, in experimental systems, p73 showed many p53-like properties; it could bind to p53 DNA binding sites, transactivate p53-responsive genes, and induce cell cycle arrest or apoptosis (3.Kaghad M. Bonnet H. Yang A. Creancier L. Biscan J.C. Valent A. Minty A. Chalon P. Lelias J.M. Dumont X. Ferrara P. McKeon F. Caput D.

However, apart from the structural and functional similarities between p53 and p73, several pieces of evidence argue against p73 being a classical tumor suppressor. In contrast to p53, p73 is not inactivated by classic viral oncoproteins to allow host cell transformation, indicating that p73 may augment, rather than inhibit, viral and cellular transformation (7.Marin M.C. Jost C.A. Irwin M.S. DeCaprio J.A. Caput D. Kaelin W.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6316-6324Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In contrast to mice lacking p53, p73-negative mice are not prone to tumor development (8.Yang A. Walker N. Bronson R. Kaghad M. Oosterwegel M. Bonnin J. Vagner C. Bonnet H. Dikkes P. Sharpe A. McKeon F. Caput D. Nature. 2000; 404: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar). Despite initial reports suggesting tumor-associated deletion of p73, many subsequent studies failed to demonstrate mutational inactivation of theTP73 gene in a wide variety of tumors (3.Kaghad M.

High p73 expression levels were revealed as an independent marker of poor patient survival prognosis in hepatocellular carcinomas and correlated positively with higher risk stages in B-CLLs (B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia) (14.Tannapfel A.

Together, these data raise the question about additional activities of p73 in cancer. The molecular basis for the apparently different functions of p53 and p73 in human tumors is at present unknown but might be related to the differences in genomic organization of the TP53 andTP73 genes. Whereas TP53 does not show much splice variations, the TP73 gene encodes a complex number of isoforms with at least nine different isoforms generated by alternative splicing of the C-terminal exons (Fig. 1) (15.Stiewe T. Putzer B.M. Apoptosis. 2001; 6: 447-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, apart from a shift toward expression of the shorter C-terminal isoforms in tumor cells, little is known to support their role in tumorigenesis (12.Zaika A.I. Kovalev S. Marchenko N.D.

Because the translation start is located in exon 2, these splice variants also encode N-terminally truncated proteins termed ΔTA-p73 (Fig. 1). Interestingly, overexpression of p73 in tumors has been shown to include both full-length p73 (TA-p73) and N-terminally truncated p73 isoform (ΔTA-p73).1, 2Moreover, overexpression of ΔTA-p73 results in malignant transformation of NIH3T3 cells supporting a function in tumorigenesis.2 In this study we have further characterized these novel p73 isoforms. We show that ΔTA-p73 just as full-length p73 (TA-p73) and wild-type p53 is a sequence-specific DNA binding factor. Due to the lack of the N-terminal transactivation domain, however, ΔTA-p73 does not transactivate typical p53-regulated genes, resulting in an inability to induce growth arrest and apoptosis. Moreover, ΔTA-p73 acts as a dominant-negative inhibitor of p53 and full-length p73 (TA-p73). Investigating the mechanism, we demonstrate that inhibition of p53 involves competition for DNA binding, whereas TA-p73 can be inhibited by direct protein-protein interaction.

Rat monoclonal anti-H-ras (sc-35) and goat polyclonal anti-p21 (sc-397) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA. cDNAs encoding p53 and various p73 isoforms were cloned into pAdTrack-CMV (kindly provided by B.

Luciferase activities were determined 48 h following transfection using a premanufactured Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) and normalized to the total protein concentration in the cell extract. For colony formation assays, H1299 cells were transfected with 10 μg of pcDNA3.1-based expression plasmids for p53 or p73 cultured in the presence of 500 μg/ml G418 for 3 weeks, fixed, and stained with Giemsa. For MTT viability assays, H1299 cells were plated on 96-well plates, infected with a combination of p53- and ΔTA-p73-expressing adenoviral vectors, and analyzed 48 h post-infection using the CellTiter 96® AQueousOne Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega). MTT assays of SH-SY5Y cells were performed as described (27.Ronca F. Yee K.S. Yu V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18128-18134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). DNA analysis by flow cytometry and DNA fragmentation assays of H1299 cells infected with various adenoviral vectors were performed as described (28.Putzer B.M. Stiewe T. Crespo F. Esche H.

Semiquantitative RT-PCR was carried out on total RNA prepared with the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) essentially as described (24.Stiewe T. Putzer B.M. Nat.

To obtain a semiquantitative result, we used the minimum number of cycles required to obtain a clear signal in the linear range and labeling of PCR products with [α-32P]dCTP for high sensitivity detection. The amount of PCR product was quantitated on a PhosphorImager. Primer sequences are available upon request. EMSAs were performed as described (7.Marin M.C. Jost C.A. Irwin M.S. DeCaprio J.A. Caput D. Kaelin W.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6316-6324Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). For supershift analysis 1 μg of the anti-p73 monoclonal ER15 or the polyclonal anti-p73 antibody Ab-7 were used. In vitro translation was performed with the TNT translation system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For co-immunoprecipitation experiments, 3 mg of lysate from transfected H1299 cells were precipitated with 1 μg of either p53 antibodies (mixture of DO-1 and PAb421) or HA antibody (F-7, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in NET buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol). Immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to ECL nitrocellulose (Amersham Biosciences), and immunoblotted with p73-antisera. For GST-pull-down assays, 35S-labeled in vitrotranslated proteins were bound with recombinant GST-p53 in GST-binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) and detected by autoradiography following SDS-PAGE. Because ΔTA-p73 proteins share the DNA-binding domain with the full-length isoforms, DNA-binding properties were analyzed by EMSA. As shown in Fig. 2A, full-length proteins as well as ΔTA isoforms all form complexes with a p53 consensus oligonucleotide with comparable affinity, which can be specifically competed and supershifted with appropriate antibodies. Whereas the full-length p73 containing complexes were supershifted by antibodies directed against the C terminus and the N terminus, ΔTA-p73 DNA complexes, which lack the N-terminal epitope, were only supershifted by the C-terminal antibody. Next we analyzed p73-mediated transactivation of p53-regulated reporters by luciferase assay by transient transfection in p53-null H1299 cells (Fig. 2, B and C). Although full-length p73α and p73β activated a p53-responsive luciferase reporter plasmid containing three p53 binding sites upstream of a TATA box, no significant transactivation was observed for ΔTA-p73α and ΔTA-p73β, consistent with the lack of the N-terminal transactivation domain. Protein expression of ΔTA-p73 was verified by Western blot (data not shown). Furthermore, wild-type p53 has been shown to inhibit transcription from several viral and cellular promoters without known p53-binding sites such as the SV40 early promoter (30.Subler M.A. Martin D.W. Deb S. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4757-4762Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, certain transforming p53 mutants or artificial N-terminal deletion mutants lack transrepression activity or even activate such promoters (31.Deb S. Jackson C.T. Subler M.A. Martin D.W. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6164-6170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Subler M.A. Martin D.W. Deb S. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1351-1359PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2D, full-length p73β is also a potent repressor of the SV40 promoter, whereas ΔTA-p73β leads to a significant induction of promoter activity. The effect of ΔTA-p73 on the expression of endogenous p53-regulated target genes (p21CDKN1A, HDM2, 14-3-3ς, PIG3, and PIDD) was evaluated by Western blot and semiquantitative RT-PCR in p53-deficient H1299 cells. To obtain high transfection rates we used adenoviral vectors encoding p73α, ΔTA-p73α, p73β, ΔTA-p73β, p53, or GFP as a control (expression is shown in Fig. 3A). Whereas p53, p73β, and to a lesser extent p73α activated p53 target genes, ΔTA-p73 consistently failed to induce or even repressed the majority of target genes (Fig. 3, A and B). The inability to induce growth arrest and cell death-associated target genes suggests that ΔTA-p73 lacks the cytotoxic activity considered to be the primary mechanism for tumor suppression by p53 and perhaps TA-p73. Indeed, compared with p53 and especially with full-length p73, both ΔTA-p73α and ΔTA-p73β show a significantly reduced ability to suppress colony formation (Fig. 4A). To investigate the underlying causes, we analyzed the cell cycle profile of H1299 cells infected with recombinant adenoviral vectors expressing p53, p73β, or ΔTA-p73β. As shown in Fig. 4B, both p53 and p73β induced growth arrest and apoptosis, whereas ΔTA-p73β induced no significant cell cycle aberrations. Consistently, only p53, p73β, and to a lesser extent p73α induced DNA fragmentation as an indicator of apoptotic cell death (Fig. 4C). These data demonstrate that N-terminally truncated p73 proteins retain the DNA-binding properties of full-length p73 but due to the lack of the transcriptional activation domain in the N terminus fail to activate typical p53 target genes and consequently lack the ability to induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. The ability to target p53 DNA binding sites in the absence of transactivation functions suggests that ΔTA-p73 might compete with transactivation-competent isoforms of p73 and wild-type p53. As shown in Fig. 5A, expression of increasing amounts of ΔTA-p73 significantly inhibited transactivation of a p53-regulated luciferase reporter by both p53 and transactivation-competent TA-p73β. Consistently, induction of p53 target genes by adenoviral expression of p53 in H1299 cells was completely inhibited by co-infection with ΔTA-p73-expressing vectors (Fig. 5B). In addition, ΔTA-p73 inhibited the transactivation function of endogenous p53 in MCF-7 cells following treatment with adriamycin, despite efficient stabilization of the p53 protein independently of ΔTA-p73 expression (Fig. 4, C andD). As a consequence of the induction of proapoptotic genes, adenoviral expression of p53 led to a rapid loss of cell viability in H1299 cells, which could be significantly inhibited by ΔTA-p73 expression (Fig. 5E). These data indicate that overexpression of ΔTA-p73 inhibits p53- and TA-p73-induced target gene activation, thereby blocking apoptotic cell death as a major tumor suppressor function of p53. In general, two basic mechanisms for inhibition of p53 are conceivable. First, ΔTA-p73 may physically interact with and sequester p53 to form hetero-oligomers that are transactivation-incompetent (33.Yang A. McKeon F. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 199-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Second, as ΔTA-p73 retains the core DNA-binding domain and exhibits binding specificity for p53 binding sites, simple competition for DNA sites might prevent p53 or TA-p73 from binding to target gene promoters. To determine whether ΔTA-p73 inhibits p53 function by interfering with sequence-specific DNA binding of p53, we used a fusion protein of p53, the Gal4 DNA-binding domain, and a Gal4-dependent luciferase reporter construct (Gal-TK-Luc). Transfection of increasing amounts of ΔTA-p73 did not lead to substantial inhibition of Gal4-p53-induced reporter activity as was observed for p53 on a p53-dependent reporter (Fig. 5A), suggesting that interference with the sequence-specific DNA binding of p53 might be the primary mechanism of inhibition (Fig. 6A). This view is further supported by a competition EMSA (Fig. 6B). Both p53 and ΔTA-p73β formed specific DNA complexes that could be supershifted with appropriate antibodies (ER15 for ΔTA-p73β and DO-1 for p53), whereas a DNA binding-defective mutant of ΔTA-p73 (ΔTA-p73βR292H) proved unable to bind DNA. The p53 complexes could be efficiently competed by increasing amounts of ΔTA-p73 but not the DNA binding-defective mutant of ΔTA-p73β, which underlines the importance of an intact DNA-binding domain of ΔTA-p73 to inhibit p53 function. To investigate whether ΔTA-p73 interacts with and sequesters p53, we performed in vitro and in vivo protein interaction assays. A GST-pull-down assay with recombinant GST-p53 and various 35S-labeled in vitro-translated p53 and p73 proteins demonstrated strong homotypic interaction between GST-p53 and both wild-type and mutant p53 (Fig. 6C). However, neither full-length TA-p73 nor truncated ΔTA-p73 isoforms significantly bound to GST-p53. These data could be confirmed byin vivo immunoprecipitation. ΔTA-p73α co-precipitated only with the p53 mutant p53R175H, which was previously shown to interact with full-length p73 but not with wild-type p53 (Fig. 6D). The failure of ΔTA-p73 to directly interact with wild-type p53 precludes formation of inactive p53/ΔTA-p73 hetero-oligomers and confines the mechanism of p53 inhibition to competition on the promoter level. In contrast, ΔTA-p73α specifically co-precipitated with full-length, wild-type p73α (Fig. 6D). Interestingly, the DNA-binding defective ΔTA-p73 mutant ΔTA-p73R292H efficiently inhibited p73- but not p53-mediated transactivation, suggesting that ΔTA-p73R292H inhibits full-length p73 by formation of DNA-binding defective hetero-oligomers (Fig. 6E). Therefore, competition for DNA binding appears to be the major mechanism of p53 inhibition, whereas inhibition of full-length p73 can also be achieved by formation of heteromeric complexes between full-length p73 and ΔTA-p73. To demonstrate the physiological relevance of the dominant-negative activity of ΔTA-p73, we analyzed the effect of endogenous p73 on p53 function. Treatment of wild-type p53 expressing SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells with RA resulted in the induction of both endogenous full-length and N-terminally truncated p73α proteins, consistent with recent reports on induction of p73 by RA in other neuroblastoma and myeloid leukemic cells (Fig. 7A) (16.Tschan M.P. Grob T.J. Peters U.R. Laurenzi V.D. Huegli B. Kreuzer K. Schmidt C.A. Melino G. Fey M.F. Tobler A. Cajot J.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Melino G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15226-15231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Up-regulation of p73 expression by RA therefore mimics p73 overexpression in cancer cells. Treatment of SH-SY5Y cells with RA conferred resistance to p53-dependent apoptosis induced by the protein kinase inhibitor H-7 (Fig. 7C) without interfering with p53 protein accumulation (Fig. 7B), suggesting that RA inhibits apoptosis signaling via p53, possibly by induction of ΔTA-p73 (27.Ronca F. Yee K.S. Yu V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18128-18134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In fact, overexpression of ΔTA-p73 enhanced resistance to H-7 similar to RA itself (Fig. 7C). These findings strongly suggest that induction of endogenous p73 is able to inhibit apoptosis signaling by endogenous p53. The identification of the p53-homologous TP73 gene on chromosome 1p36, a genomic region frequently deleted in a variety of human cancers, suggested that p73 has tumor suppressor activity similar to that of the classical tumor suppressor, p53. However, p73 is not commonly mutated in all tumor entities analyzed so far. Instead, overexpression of wild-type p73 has been reported frequently and positively correlates with prognostically relevant parameters.1 Considering that oncogene-induced up-regulation of p73 expression causes apoptosis, sustained overexpression of p73 would therefore require inhibition of its inherent proapoptotic activity (24.Stiewe T. Putzer B.M. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 464-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 35.Irwin M. Marin M.C. Phillips A.C. Seelan R.S. Smith D.I. Liu W. Flores E.R. Tsai K.Y. Jacks T. Vousden K.H. Kaelin W.G. Nature. 2000; 407: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). On one hand, p53 mutants were demonstrated to inhibit the proapoptotic activity of full-length p73 in a dominant-negative fashion by generating defective hetero-oligomers with wild-type p73. On the other hand, the TP73 gene itself might encode anti-apoptotic isoforms. The first evidence for the latter mechanism was based on the analysis of murine p73, which encodes N-terminally truncated p73 isoforms (ΔN-p73) derived from a cryptic promoter in intron 3 (8.Yang A. Walker N. Bronson R. Kaghad M. Oosterwegel M. Bonnin J. Vagner C. Bonnet H. Dikkes P. Sharpe A. McKeon F. Caput D. Nature. 2000; 404: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar). Murine ΔN-p73 is a potent anti-apoptotic protein, which rescues sympathetic neurons from apoptosis induced by nerve growth factor withdrawal or p53 overexpression. Because sympathetic neuron death following nerve growth factor withdrawal is p53-dependent, ΔN-p73 possibly inhibits neuronal apoptosis by acting as a direct antagonist to p53 (18.Pozniak C.D. Radinovic S. Yang A. McKeon F. Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. Science. 2000; 289: 304-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Recently the human homologue of ΔN-p73 was cloned and shown to possess similar p53- and TA-p73-inhibiting functions, suggesting that increased expression of ΔN-p73 could be involved in tumorigenesis (20.Grob T.J.

Apart from ΔN-p73, which is a physiological transcript regulated by its own independent promoter, in human tumor cells N-terminally truncated p73 proteins (ΔTA-p73) are also encoded by alternatively (aberrantly) spliced transcripts that lack exon 2 (p73Δex2) (3.Kaghad M.

Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 636-641PubMed Google Scholar) recently described other alternatively spliced transcripts, which either lack exons 2 and 3 (p73Δex2/3) or include exon 3B (ΔN′-p73). In an analysis of ovarian cancers, expression of p73Δex2 was detected exclusively in cancer cell lines and invasive tumor tissues but not in semi-malignant borderline tumors (23.Ng S.W. Yiu G.K. Liu Y. Huang L.W. Palnati M. Jun S.H. Berkowitz R.S. Mok S.C. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1885-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In an analysis of hepatocellular carcinomas, both p73Δex2 and p73Δex2/3 were shown to be up-regulated in tumor tissue compared with surrounding normal liver tissue.2 Considering that ectopic expression of these isoforms inhibits transactivation and apoptosis induction by p53 and TA-p73 and that many inhibitors of p53 act as transforming oncogenes, they might as well be involved in tumorigenesis (19.Fillippovich I. Sorokina N. Gatei M. Haupt Y. Hobson K. Moallem E. Spring K. Mould M. McGuckin M.A. Lavin M.F. Khanna K.K. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 514-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). This hypothesis was supported by our own findings demonstrating that expression of p73Δex2/3 promotes anchorage-independent growth of NIH3T3 cells and tumor growth in nude mice.2 In this study we further characterized the effects of ΔTA-p73 expression and analyzed the mechanism of p53/p73 inhibition in more detail. As sequence-specific DNA binding is a prerequisite for regulation of specific genes, we first confirmed that ΔTA-p73 retains its DNA-binding competence and specificity for p53 binding sites. Due to the lack of the N-terminal transactivation domain, ΔTA-p73 acts as a DNA-binding factor without transactivation function, thereby acting as a dominant-negative inhibitor by blocking the proapoptotic activity of p53 and full-length p73. In general, two basic mechanisms for inhibition of p53 are conceivable. First, ΔTA-p73 may physically interact with and sequester p53 to form hetero-oligomers that are transactivation-incompetent (33.Yang A. McKeon F. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 199-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). In support of this theory, Kaghad et al. (3.Kaghad M. Bonnet H. Yang A. Creancier L. Biscan J.C. Valent A. Minty A. Chalon P.

However, others failed to find an interaction between p53 and p73 using purified oligomerization domains or to detect hetero-oligomeric complexes of full-length p73 and wild-type p53 in coimmunoprecipitation and GST pull-down assays (37.Davison T.S.

However, a physical interaction between p73 and p53 has been reported repeatedly for several p53 mutants (38.DiComo C.J. Gaiddon C. Prives C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1438-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 39.Strano S. Munarriz E. Rossi M. Cristofanelli B. Shaul Y. Castagnoli L. Levine A.J. Sacchi A. Cesareni G. Oren M. Blandino G.

Allday M.J. Gusterson B. Ikawa S. Hinds P.W. Crook T. Kaelin W.G. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). As shown by Gaiddon and colleagues (40.Gaiddon C. Lokshin M. Ahn J. Zhang T. Prives C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1874-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar), interaction between mutant p53 and wild-type p73 is mediated by the p53 core domain and correlates with recognition of p53 by the conformation-sensitive monoclonal antibody PAb240. These data indicate that physical interaction between p53 and p73 requires a special (mutant) conformation of the p53 core domain and explain specific interaction of ΔTA-p73 with mutant but not wild-type p53. Second, as ΔTA-p73 retains the core DNA-binding domain and exhibits binding specificity for p53 binding sites, simple competition for DNA sites might prevent p53 or TA-p73 from binding to target gene promoters. This mechanism is supported by our competition EMSA, which demonstrates efficient disruption of p53 complexes by increasing amounts of ΔTA-p73. This competition is absolutely dependent on the DNA binding ability of ΔTA-p73, as shown by experiments with the DNA binding-defective mutant, R292H. Consistently, p53-mediated transactivation was inhibited by ΔTA-p73 but not ΔTA-p73R292H. In addition, inhibition of p53 targeted by fusion to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain to a Gal4-regulated promoter was significantly reduced. We could observe only a 50% reduction with the highest amount of ΔTA-p73. This might hint at additional inhibitory functions of ΔTA-p73 unrelated to interference with sequence-specific DNA-binding or simply be due to unspecific quelching effects. In summary, the data support strongly a model in which ΔTA-p73 exerts a dominant-negative effect by displacing p53 from target gene promoters (Fig. 8A). In contrast, inhibition of full-length p73 appears to be more complex. Because both TA-p73 and ΔTA-p73 efficiently bind to target DNA, simple competition for DNA binding will certainly be involved. However, whereas ΔTA-p73 does not interact with wild-type p53, we observed protein-protein interaction between TA-p73 and ΔTA-p73 by in vivo immunoprecipitation. This interaction, which results in the formation of transactivation-defective hetero-oligomers, appears to be sufficient to inhibit transactivation by TA-p73. In fact, there is no difference in inhibition of TA-p73 by wild-type ΔTA-p73 and the DNA binding-defective mutant ΔTA-p73R292H, which still interacts with TA-p73 (data not shown). Our experiments therefore clearly demonstrate that the dominant-negative effect of ΔTA-p73 involves different mechanisms for inhibition of p53 and TA-p73 (Fig. 8B). All of the experiments on ΔTA-p73 function by us and others relied on ectopic overexpression of ΔTA-p73. To explain the increased expression level of p73 in tumor tissues with the described dominant-negative effect of ΔTA-p73, it is therefore important to demonstrate that increased expression of endogenous p73 has a similar inhibitory effect on p53 function. It has recently been described that p73 is up-regulated during differentiation of neuroblastoma cells induced by RA (34.De Laurenzi V. Raschella G. Barcaroli D. Annicchiarico-Petruzzelli M. Ranalli M. Catani M.V. Tanno B. Costanzo A. Levrero M. Melino G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15226-15231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Consistently, treatment of wild-type p53-expressing SH-SY5Y cells with RA resulted in increased expression of p73α. Interestingly both full-length TA-p73α and truncated ΔTA-p73α levels were elevated simultaneously. Because tumor tissues usually also show concomitant up-regulation of full-length and ΔTA-p73 expression,2 this system is an appropriate model to assess the net function of p73 overexpression. SH-SY5Y cells undergo p53-dependent apoptosis when treated with the protein kinase inhibitor H-7 (27.Ronca F. Yee K.S. Yu V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18128-18134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Although p53 protein was stabilized by H-7 in both untreated and RA-treated cells, apoptosis was significantly reduced by RA treatment. Because ectopic expression of ΔTA-p73 had an effect similar to RA treatment on cell survival, it can be assumed that up-regulation of endogenous ΔTA-p73 is responsible for this effect. Together, our data show that ΔTA-p73 proteins are effective inhibitors of p53 and TA-p73 function. Consistently, increased expression of endogenous p73 including expression of ΔTA-p73 protects cells from p53-dependent apoptosis. These functions of ΔTA-p73 provide a possible explanation for the high level of p73 expression in human cancer cells, even in the absence of p73 mutations, although additional work is needed to further investigate the role of ΔTA-p73 for tumor development and progression.

https://openalex.org/W1981552086,"Vacuolar proton-translocating ATPases are composed of a peripheral complex, V1, attached to an integral membrane complex, Vo. Association of the two complexes is essential for ATP-driven proton transport and is regulated post-translationally in response to glucose concentration. A new complex, RAVE, was recently isolated and implicated in glucose-dependent reassembly of V-ATPase complexes that had disassembled in response to glucose deprivation (Seol, J. H., Shevchenko, A., and Deshaies, R. J. (2001) Nat. Cell Biol. 3, 384–391). Here, we provide evidence supporting a role for RAVE in reassembly of the V-ATPase but also demonstrate an essential role in V-ATPase assembly under other conditions. The RAVE complex associates reversibly with V1 complexes released from the membrane by glucose deprivation but binds constitutively to cytosolic V1 sectors in a mutant lacking Vosectors. V-ATPase complexes from cells lacking RAVE subunits show serious structural and functional defects even in glucose-grown cells or in combination with a mutation that blocks disassembly of the V-ATPase. RAVE·V1 interactions are specifically disrupted in cells lacking V1 subunits E or G, suggesting a direct involvement for these subunits in interaction of the two complexes. Skp1p, a RAVE subunit involved in many different signal transduction pathways, binds stably to other RAVE subunits under conditions that alter RAVE·V1 binding; thus, Skp1p recruitment to the RAVE complex does not appear to provide a signal for V-ATPase assembly.

Forgac M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 779-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). In some cells, VATPases are also present at high levels at the plasma membrane, where they pump protons from the cytosol out of the cell (2.Nelson N. Harvey W.R. Physiol.

Bioessays. 1999; 21: 637-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). In all of these locations and in organisms ranging from yeast to humans, V-ATPases have a very similar structure and subunit composition. They are comprised of 13 or 14 subunits arranged as a complex of cytosolic peripheral membrane subunits containing the sites of ATP hydrolysis, the V1sector, attached to a membrane complex containing the proton pore, the Vo sector. ATP-driven proton transport occurs only when the two sectors are structurally and functionally coupled. Free V1 sectors do not catalyze hydrolysis of MgATP, the physiological substrate, and free Vo sectors do not appear to form open proton pores (5.Graf R. Harvey W.R. Wieczorek H. J. Biol.

Both mammalian cells and yeast contain free V1and Vo sectors in vivo (8.Myers M. Forgac M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 156: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 9.Peng S.B. Li X. Crider B.P.

Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16845-16851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Yet there is evidence that the major pathway for biosynthetic assembly of V-ATPases does not involve independent assembly of free V1 and Vo sectors followed by attachment of the two sectors. Instead, pulse-chase studies indicate very early association of V1 and Vo sector subunits followed by addition of subunits from both sectors (11.Kane P.M. Tarsio M. Liu J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17275-17283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Definition of assembly pathways was further complicated by the observation that fully assembled V-ATPases could rapidly and reversibly disassemble into free V1 and Vo sectors (12.Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17025-17032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,13.Sumner J.P. Dow J.A. Earley F.G. Klein U. Jager D. Wieczorek H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5649-5653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Disassembly of V-ATPases in yeast and insects, the two systems in which the process is best characterized, occurs in response to low extracellular glucose concentrations. Reversible disassembly is believed to be an important regulatory mechanism; disassembly of V-ATPases conserves ATP under conditions of nutrient limitation by silencing the ATPase activity of the enzyme and reassembly rapidly reactivates the pump with no need for new protein synthesis (14.Wieczorek H. Grber G. Harvey W.R. Huss M. Merzendorfer H. Zeiske W. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 127-135Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,15.Kane P.M. Parra K.J. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 81-87Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The signaling pathways connecting V-ATPase assembly with extracellular glucose concentration have proven to be somewhat elusive. Many of the pathways that signal glucose availability in yeast cells do not appear to be involved in modulating the assembly state of the V-ATPase (16.Parra K.J. Kane P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7064-7074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, a new player in V-ATPase assembly was identified. Seolet al. (17.Seol J.H. Shevchenko A. Deshaies R.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 384-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) identified a Skp1p-containing complex they called RAVE, regulator of the ATPase of vacuolar and endosomal membranes, through affinity chromatography to detect Skp1p binding partners, and subsequently showed that RAVE also bound at least four of the V1 subunits of the yeast V-ATPase. The RAVE complex contains three members, Rav1p, Rav2p, and Skp1p. RAV1 andRAV2 were previously uncharacterized yeast open reading frames, but RAV1 has homologues in all eukaryotes. Deletion of the RAV1 and RAV2 genes resulted in a temperature-dependent Vma− phenotype, characterized by sensitivity to elevated pH and poor growth on glycerol-containing medium. The V-ATPase also showed assembly defects in the rav mutants, and the V1 subunits that were assembled on the vacuolar membrane in a rav1Δ mutant disassembled rapidly in response to glucose deprivation but reassembled much more slowly upon glucose re-addition than in wild-type cells. These results implicated the RAVE complex in glucose-triggered reassembly of the V-ATPase, but it was not clear whether this aspect of RAVE function accounted for the V-ATPase assembly defects of rav1Δ mutants observed even in the presence of glucose. Skp1p is a very highly conserved protein primarily known as a component of SCF (Skp1-cullin-F-box) ubiquitin ligases, which are involved in signal-induced protein degradation (18.Deshaies R.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 435-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar, 19.Patton E.E. Willems A.R. Tyers M.

Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1999; 354: 1533-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). SCF complexes regulate a wide range of fundamental cell processes ranging from cell cycle progression to nutrient utilization to transcription. Skp1p mediates this wide range of functions by binding a variety of proteins with little structural or sequence similarity beyond an F-box motif, a degenerate, 40-amino acid sequence motif originally identified by sequence alignment of several Skp1p-binding proteins and subsequently shown to be directly involved in binding to Skp1p (19.Patton E.E. Willems A.R. Tyers M. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 236-243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 21.Bai C. Sen P. Hofmann K. Ma L. Goebl M. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1996; 86: 263-274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). In SCF complexes Skp1p is seen primarily as an adaptor capable of bridging F-box proteins with specificity for phosphorylated substrates to be degraded and E2/E3 ubiquitin ligase components bound to the cullin (19.Patton E.E. Willems A.R. Tyers M. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 236-243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar,21.Bai C. Sen P. Hofmann K. Ma L. Goebl M. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1996; 86: 263-274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). The RAVE complex diverges from the SCF model in several important ways. Although Seol et al. (17.Seol J.H. Shevchenko A. Deshaies R.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 384-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) determined that Rav1p binds to Skp1p, RAV1 contains no identifiable F-box sequence or resemblance to the cullin proteins. More importantly, the RAVE complex does not contain the yeast cullin, Cdc53p (17.Seol J.H. Shevchenko A. Deshaies R.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 384-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), and there is no apparent role for protein degradation in disassembly or reassembly of the V-ATPase (12.Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17025-17032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these data indicate that RAVE is a non-SCF Skp1p-containing complex. The role of Skp1p in the RAVE complex is mysterious, but the presence of Skp1p invokes rich possibilities for cross-talk between V-ATPase assembly and the wide variety of signaling pathways in yeast that ultimately act through other Skp1-containing complexes. In this work we have taken a closer look at the role of RAVE in both biosynthetic assembly and glucose-dependent disassembly and reassembly of the V-ATPase in yeast. Our results support those of Seolet al. (17.Seol J.H. Shevchenko A. Deshaies R.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 384-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) implicating RAVE in glucose-induced reassembly of the V-ATPase but also indicate that the RAVE complex must play a more general role in V-ATPase assembly. We provide evidence that the RAVE complex appears to bind V1 whenever it is in the cytosol and that RAVE is required for stable assembly even in a mutant V-ATPase incapable of disassembly in response to glucose deprivation. We also find that the association of Skp1p with the RAVE complex does not change with changes in carbon source or under conditions where the RAVE complex cannot bind to V1. These results suggest that Skp1p is a stable component of the RAVE complex and that the RAVE complex is critical for stable assembly of the V-ATPase under many different conditions. Oligonucleotides were purchased from MWG Biotech. LA-Taq polymerase was from Panvera and native Pfu DNA polymerase was from Stratagene. Other molecular biology reagents were purchased from New England BioLabs. Tran35S-label and zymolyase 100T were purchased from ICN. Concanamycin A was from Wako Biochemicals. Monoclonal antibody 9E10 against the myc epitope was obtained from Roche Molecular Biotechnology or Zymed Laboratories Inc., and alkaline phosphatase second antibodies were from Promega. Yeast and Escherichia coli media were from Difco or Fisher. All other reagents were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. Yeast cells were grown in yeast extract-peptone-2% dextrose (YEPD) medium or fully supplemented minimal medium (SD) lacking individual nutrients as described previously (22.Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). For growth of vma mutant strains, YEPD was buffered to pH 5.0 with 50 mm sodium phosphate/50 mm sodium succinate (YEPD, pH 5). For analysis of the Vma− growth phenotype, YEPD was buffered to pH 7.5 with 50 mm Mes, 50 mm MOPS buffer, and 60 mm CaCl2 was added (YEPD, pH 7.5, + Ca2+). The strains used in this work are listed in Table I. Therav1Δ::LEU2 andrav2Δ::URA3 alleles were constructed by fusion PCR. Sequences immediately upstream and downstream of theRAV1 and RAV2 open reading frames were amplified using oligonucleotides YJR1-7 and YJR2-8 to amplify the 5′-end ofRAV1, oligonucleotides YJR5-11 and YJR6-12 to amplify the 3′-end of RAV1, oligonucleotides YDR1-1 and YDR2-2 to amplify the 5′-end of RAV2, and oligonucleotides YDR5-5 and YDR6-6 to amplify the 3′-end of RAV2. Oligonucleotide sequences are shown in Table II. TheURA3 and LEU2 genes were amplified using oligonucleotides YDR3-3 and YDR4-4 with pRS316 as a template and YJR3-9 and YJR4-10 with pRS315 as a template, respectively (23.Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The deletion alleles were constructed by combining the RAV2 5′ and 3′-ends and URA3 fragment into a single fusion PCR reaction containing oligonucleotides YDR1-1 and YDR6-6. The RAV1 5′- and 3′-ends and LEU2 fragment were combined in a fusion PCR reaction containing oligonucleotides YJR1-7 and YJR6-12. The PCR reactions employed a mixture of LA-Taq and native Pfuthermostable DNA polymerases in LA-Taq buffer provided by the manufacturer. The products of the fusion PCR reactions were gel-purified and used to transform wild-type strain SF838-5A in a one-step gene replacement (24.Rothstein R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 202-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (2033) Google Scholar). Replacement of the wild-type with the mutant alleles was confirmed by PCR. To create therav1Δrav2Δ double mutant, therav2Δ::URA2 fusion product was transformed into the rav1Δ strain, and transformants were selected on SD-uracil.Table IGenotypes of strains used in this studyStrainGenotypeSourceSF838–5AMATαura3–52 leu2–3,112 his4–519 ade6(54.Stevens T.H.

Transformants were selected on YEPD, pH 5, medium containing 200 μg/ml G418 and confirmed by PCR and/or immunoblotting. Immunoprecipitation of V-ATPase complexes from biosynthetically labeled cells was performed as described previously (12.Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17025-17032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation of cytosolic RAVE·V1 complexes, cytosolic fractions were obtained from the indicated strains (150 A600 of each) as described previously (6.Parra K.J. Keenan K.L. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21761-21767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Protein from 10% of the cytosolic fraction was directly precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid, and the remaining 90% was combined with 100 μl of anti-V1monoclonal antibody (8B1 or 13D11 (29.Kane P.M. Kuehn M.C. Howald-Stevenson I. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 447-454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) or 5 μg of anti-myc antibody (9E10, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) followed by 60 μl of a 50% (v/v) suspension of Protein A-Sepharose CL4B. The immunoprecipitated proteins were solubilized at 75 °C in cracking buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 8 m urea, 5% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol) for analysis by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. For comparison of immunoprecipitations from the variousvmaΔ strains (Fig. 6), cells (100A600 of each strain) were lysed by agitation with glass beads as described (34.Seol J.H. Feldman R.M. Zachariae W. Shevchenko A. Correll C.C. Lyapina S. Chi Y. Galova M. Claypool J. Sandmeyer S. Nasmyth K. Deshaies R.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1614-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) and cytosol was obtained by centrifugation for 30 min at 100,000 × g in a Beckman TLA-100 Ultracentrifuge. Protein concentration in the cytosolic fractions from the various strains was measured by Lowry assay (35.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); 0.4 mg of protein was directly trichloroacetic acid-precipitated, and 4 mg was immunoprecipitated and analyzed by immunoblotting as described below. Vacuolar vesicles were isolated as described (36.Roberts C.J. Raymond C.K. Yamashiro C.T. Stevens T.H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 644-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). ATP hydrolysis activity was determined at 37 °C using a coupled enzyme assay (37.Lotscher H.R. deJong C. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4140-4143Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), in the presence and absence of 100 nm concanamycin A. For immunoblotting, vacuolar vesicles were pelleted by centrifugation and solubilized in cracking buffer. For all immunoblots, samples were separated by SDS-PAGE then transferred to nitrocellulose. Blots were probed with mouse monoclonal antibodies 8B1, 13D11, 7A2, and 10D7 against V1 subunits A, B, and C, and Vo subunit a, respectively. Myc-tagged RAVE subunits were detected with mouse monoclonal antibody 9E10. Rabbit polyclonal antisera against yeast Skp1 was a generous gift from Ray Deshaies, California Institute of Technology. Primary antibodies were bound by alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody and detected by colorimetric assay as described (38.Kane P.M. Stevens T.H. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 383-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Seol et al. (17.Seol J.H. Shevchenko A. Deshaies R.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 384-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) reported that the reduced levels of V1 sectors that were present at the vacuolar membrane in a rav1Δ mutant in vivodissociated rapidly from the membrane upon glucose deprivation but were slow to re-associate upon glucose re-addition. This result implicated the RAVE complex in the glucose-dependent reassembly of the V-ATPase. To probe this aspect of RAVE activity further, we examined the effects of extracellular glucose on the RAVE·V1interaction by using a monoclonal antibody against the V1 B subunit to immunoprecipitate free V1 complexes from cytosol along with bound RAVE subunits. Immunoblots of the cytosolic fractions probed with antibody against another V1 subunit, subunit A, or against Rav1p and Rav2p proteins tagged with a myc9epitope are shown in Fig. 1A. These immunoblots demonstrate that there are detectable levels of V1 subunits in the cytosol even in the presence of glucose (+), but the level of V1 subunits in the cytosol increases markedly when the cells are deprived of glucose for 15 min (−) and then falls to the original level when glucose is restored to the cells (−/+). (Although this immunoblot was probed only with the anti-A subunit antibody, previous results indicate that all of the V1 subunits except subunit C are present in the cytosolic V1 complexes (6.Parra K.J. Keenan K.L. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21761-21767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 12.Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17025-17032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).) In contrast, the levels of Rav1p and Rav2p in the cytosol remain the same regardless of the level of extracellular glucose. In the right panels of Fig. 1A, complexes immunoprecipitated under non-denaturing conditions with an anti-B subunit antibody were probed for the presence of V1 subunit A, Rav1p, and Rav2p on immunoblots. The levels of co-precipitated A subunit reflect the levels present in the cytosolic fractions, as expected; they increase in the absence of glucose and decrease in the presence of glucose. It is striking, however, that the levels of coprecipitated Rav1p and Rav2p also rise and fall with the changes in glucose concentration. This indicates that a part of the population of cytosolic RAVE complexes is recruited to interact with V1 sectors released from the membrane by glucose deprivation and that these RAVE complexes are able to rapidly release the bound V1 when extracellular glucose is restored. Disassembly and reassembly of the yeast V-ATPase has been shown to be entirely post-tran"
https://openalex.org/W2079187415,"With time, convective processes in the Earth's mantle will tend to align crystals, grains and inclusions. This mantle fabric is detectable seismologically, as it produces an anisotropy in material properties--in particular, a directional dependence in seismic-wave velocity. This alignment is enhanced at the boundaries of the mantle where there are rapid changes in the direction and magnitude of mantle flow, and therefore most observations of anisotropy are confined to the uppermost mantle or lithosphere and the lowermost-mantle analogue of the lithosphere, the D"" region. Here we present evidence from shear-wave splitting measurements for mid-mantle anisotropy in the vicinity of the 660-km discontinuity, the boundary between the upper and lower mantle. Deep-focus earthquakes in the Tonga-Kermadec and New Hebrides subduction zones recorded at Australian seismograph stations record some of the largest values of shear-wave splitting hitherto reported. The results suggest that, at least locally, there may exist a mid-mantle boundary layer, which could indicate the impediment of flow between the upper and lower mantle in this region."
https://openalex.org/W2036385397,"Endothelial barrier function is altered by the release of soluble polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN)-derived mediators during inflammatory states. However, endogenous pathways to describe such changes are only recently appreciated. Using an in vitro endothelial paracellular permeability model, cell-free supernatants from formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine-stimulated PMNs were observed to significantly alter endothelial permeability. Biophysical and biochemical analysis of PMN supernatants identified PMN-derived glutamate in modulating endothelial permeability. Furthermore, novel expression of metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGluR1), mGluR4, and mGluR5 by human brain and dermal microvascular endothelial cells was demonstrated by reverse transcription-PCR,in situ hybridization, immunofluorescence, and Western blot analysis. Treatment of human brain endothelia with glutamate or selective, mGluR group I or III agonists resulted in a time-dependent loss of phosphorylated vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) and significantly increased endothelial permeability. Glutamate-induced decreases in brain endothelial barrier function and phosphorylated VASP were significantly attenuated by pretreatment of human brain endothelia with selective mGluR antagonists. These observations were extended to anin vivo hypoxic mouse model in which pretreatment with mGluR antagonists significantly decreased fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran flux across the blood-brain barrier. We conclude that activated human PMNs release glutamate and that endothelial expression of group I or III mGluRs function to decrease human brain endothelial VASP phosphorylation and barrier function. These results identify a novel pathway by which PMN-derived glutamate may regulate human endothelial barrier function.

Endothelial cells, which line the inner lumen of blood vessels, are the primary determinants vascular barrier function. During episodes of infection, ischemic or traumatic injury, endothelial cells are primary targets for leukocytes and can result in altered barrier function (1.Cotran R.S. Mayadas-Norton T. Pathol. Biol. 1998; 46: 164-170PubMed Google Scholar). Under such pathological conditions, endothelial metabolism, gene expression, and cell surface protein expression may be altered by a myriad of soluble factors, including cytokines, bioactive lipids, and bacterial endotoxin (1.Cotran R.S. Mayadas-Norton T. Pathol. Biol. 1998; 46: 164-170PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, vascular barrier function may be altered by the local release of soluble mediators from activated polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs). 1The abbreviations used are: PMNpolymorphonuclear leukocyteBBB blood brain barrierBMVEC brain microvascular endothelial cellsmGluR metabotropic glutamate receptorHMVEC, human microvascular endothelial cellsVASPvasodilator-stimulated phosphoproteinHBSSHanks' balanced salt solutionfMLFformylmethionylleucylphenylalanineCNScentral nervous systemHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyFTICfluorescein isothiocyanateDHPG3,5-dihydrophenylglycinel-AP4l-2-amino-4-phosphonobutyratePHCCCN-phenyl-7-(hydroxyamino)cyclopropa[b]chromen-1a-carboxamideCPPG(RS)-α-cyclopropyl-4-phosphonophenylglycinebpbase pair(s)PBSphosphate-buffered salineAbantibodyRTreverse transcriptaseEVHEna-VASP homology1The abbreviations used are: PMNpolymorphonuclear leukocyteBBB blood brain barrierBMVEC brain microvascular endothelial cellsmGluR metabotropic glutamate receptorHMVEC, human microvascular endothelial cellsVASPvasodilator-stimulated phosphoproteinHBSSHanks' balanced salt solutionfMLFformylmethionylleucylphenylalanineCNScentral nervous systemHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyFTICfluorescein isothiocyanateDHPG3,5-dihydrophenylglycinel-AP4l-2-amino-4-phosphonobutyratePHCCCN-phenyl-7-(hydroxyamino)cyclopropa[b]chromen-1a-carboxamideCPPG(RS)-α-cyclopropyl-4-phosphonophenylglycinebpbase pair(s)PBSphosphate-buffered salineAbantibodyRTreverse transcriptaseEVHEna-VASP homology For example, it is only recently appreciated that PMN-derived compounds, such as adenosine, may provide endogenous pathways to dampen changes in endothelial permeability during leukocyte extravasation (2.Lennon P.F. Taylor C.T. Stahl G.L. Colgan S.P. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1433-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar).

Four classes of glutamate receptors have been identified, including α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropioninc acid, kainate,N-methyl-d-aspartate, and the more recently described metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) (3.Hollmann M. Heinemann S. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 31-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (3638) Google Scholar). mGluRs are single polypeptide chain receptors characterized by a seven-transmembrane-spanning structure and a long N-terminal extracellular domain important in Glu binding (4.Kunishima N. Shimada Y. Tsuji Y. Sato T. Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. Morikawa K. Nature. 2000; 407: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (1084) Google Scholar). Coupled to guanosine triphosphate-binding proteins, mGluR forms a family of at least eight subtypes, which are classified into three groups based on sequence homology, pharmacological profile of activation, and signal transduction pathways (5.Conn P.J. Pin J.P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 205-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (2691) Google Scholar). Group I mGluRs (receptors 1 and 5) are coupled to phospholipase C activation and stimulate polyphosphoinositide hydrolysis via coupling to Gq/11 (5.Conn P.J. Pin J.P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 205-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (2691) Google Scholar). In contrast, group II (receptors 2 and 3) and III (receptors 4, 6, 7 and 8) mGluRs are negatively coupled via Gi/Goto adenylate cyclase and decrease cAMP formation (5.Conn P.J. Pin J.P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 205-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (2691) Google Scholar). Originally described within the CNS, recent evidence suggests that mGluRs are expressed by a wide variety of peripheral cell types outside the mammalian CNS (6.Gill S.S. Pulido O.M. Toxicol. Pathol. 2001; 29: 208-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Although their role outside the CNS has yet to be defined, mGluRs are involved in various aspects of CNS physiology and pathology, including modulation of excitatory synaptic transmission, developmental plasticity, learning and memory processes, and neurodegeneration (5.Conn P.J. Pin J.P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 205-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (2691) Google Scholar). To date, expression of functional mGluRs on human endothelia has not been described. In the present studies, we demonstrated that cell-free supernatants from fMLF-stimulated PMNs significantly altered endothelial permeability, suggesting the presence of a soluble PMN-derived mediator(s). Structural analysis of the bioactive, PMN-derived fractions identified glutamate as an active component in regulating human endothelial barrier function. Furthermore, we propose a novel pathway by which glutamate may regulate human vascular endothelial barrier function via its action on endothelial-expressed mGluRs. Human brain (BMVEC; Cell Systems Corp., Kirkland, WA) and dermal (HMVEC; Cascade Biologics, Portland, OR) microvascular endothelial cells were obtained as primary cultures and passaged as previously described (2.Lennon P.F. Taylor C.T. Stahl G.L. Colgan S.P. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1433-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 7.Mitra D. Jaffe E.A. Weksler B. Hajjar K.A. Soderland C. Laurence J. Blood. 1997; 89: 1224-1234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For preparation of experimental HMVEC or BMVEC monolayers, confluent endothelial cells (passage <10) were on permeable polycarbonate inserts or 100-mm Petri dishes coated with 0.1% gelatin, as described previously (2.Lennon P.F. Taylor C.T. Stahl G.L. Colgan S.P. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1433-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Endothelial cell purity was assessed by phase microscopic “cobblestone” appearance and uptake of fluorescent acetylated low density lipoprotein. PMNs were freshly isolated from whole blood obtained by venipuncture from human volunteers and anticoagulated with acid citrate/dextrose (8.Henson P. Oades Z.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1975; 56: 1053-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Plasma and mononuclear cells were removed from the buffy coat by aspiration after centrifugation (400 × g for 20 min) at 25 °C. Erythrocytes were removed using a 2% gelatin sedimentation technique. Residual erythrocytes were removed by lysis in cold NH4Cl buffer. The remaining cells were >90% PMNs as assessed by microscopic evaluation. PMNs were studied within 3 h of isolation. Freshly isolated PMNs (108 cells/ml in HBSS with 10−8m fMLF) were placed in glass culture tubes and incubated for the indicated periods of time. PMNs were pelleted (1000 ×g for 20 s, 4 °C), and supernatants were filtered (0.45 m, Phenomenex, Terrence, CA) and frozen (−80 °C) until assayed. In experiments measuring supernatant concentrations of glutamate and glutamine, samples were collected at the indicated periods, PMNs were pelleted (1000 g x 20 s, 4 °C), and supernatants were filtered (0.45 μm) and frozen (−80 °C) until HPLC analysis. Using a modification of methods previously described (2.Lennon P.F. Taylor C.T. Stahl G.L. Colgan S.P. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1433-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), HMVEC or BMVEC on polycarbonate permeable inserts (0.4-μm pore, 6.5-mm diameter; Costar Corp., Cambridge, MA) were studied 7–10 days after seeding (2–5 days post-confluency). Inserts were placed in HBSS-containing wells (1 ml), and HBSS, cell-free PMN supernatant (150 μl), or l-glutamic acid (Sigma) was added to the inserts. At the start of the assay (t = 0), 70-kDa FITC-labeled dextran (final concentration 500 μg/ml) was added to fluid within the insert. The size of 70-kDa FITC-dextran approximates that of human albumin, both of which have been used in similar endothelial permeability models (9.Albelda S.M. Sampson P.M. Haselton F.R. McNiff J.M.

Takano T. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1987; 36: 3809-3813Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Monolayers were stirred via a rotating platform (60 rotations/min, Clinical Rotator, Fisher), and adluminal fluid from each well was sampled (50 μl) over 60 min. Sample volume was replaced with HBSS. Fluorescence intensity (excitation, 485 nm; emission, 530 nm) of each sample was measured (Cytofluor 2300, Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA), and FITC-dextran concentrations were determined from standard curves generated by serial dilution of FITC-dextran. Paracellular flux was calculated by linear regression of sample fluorescence. Consistent with previous reports, control experiments demonstrated decreased permeability with forskolin and 8-bromo-cAMP (11.Casnocha S.A. Eskin S.G. Hall E.R. McIntire L.R. J. Appl. Physiol. 1989; 67: 1997-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and increased permeability with thrombin and hydrogen peroxide (data not shown) (12.Garcia J.G.N. Siflinger-Birnboim A. Bizios R. DelVecchio P.J. Fenton J.W. Malik A.B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1986; 128: 96-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Paracellular flux was also determined across monolayers treated with glutamate, 3,5-dihydrophenylglycine (DHPG; selective group I mGluR agonist), l-2-amino-4-phosphonobutyrate (l-AP4; selective group III mGluR agonist), or glutamate (1 μm) plusN-phenyl-7-(hydroxyamino)cyclopropa[b]chromen-1a-carboxamide (PHCCC; selective group I mGluR antagonist), or (RS)-α-cyclopropyl-4-phosphonophenylglycine (CPPG; selective group III mGluR antagonist) (Tocris Cookson Inc., Ellisville, MO). A Hewlett-Packard HPLC (Model 1050) with a HP 1100 diode array detector was used with a C18 reverse phase HPLC column (5 μm, 4.6 × 250 mm, Phenomenex, Torrance CA). Activated PMN-derived samples were eluted (1-ml fractions), evaporated to dryness, reconstituted in HBSS, and assayed for influence on paracellular permeability. Dabsylated glutamate and glutamine were measured as previously described (13.Chang J.Y. Knecht R. Braun D.G. Biochem. J. 1981; 199: 547-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 g of dabsyl-Cl (Sigma) was recrystallized by boiling in 100 ml of acetone for 5 min and then cooled. The solution was then filtered (0.45 μm nylon filter) and crystallized overnight at −20 °C. Dabsylated amino acids were prepared by dissolving 1 mg of l-glutamic acid or glutamine (Sigma) in 100 μl of 0.1 mNaHCO3 buffer, pH 9.0, and then adding 100 μl of dabsyl-Cl solution (2 nmol/μl acetone). The mixture was then heated for 10 min at 70 °C, dried (Savant Automatic Environmental SpeedVac System, Holbrook, NY), and re-dissolved in 200 μl of 70% (v/v) ethanol. l-Glutamic acid and glutamine were measured in cell-free PMN supernatants using a Na2HPO4 (0.1m), Na2EDTA (0.1 mm), pH 6.38, mobile phase (1.2 ml/min). Absorbance was measured at 460 and 275 nm. UV absorption spectra were obtained at chromatographic peaks.l-Glutamic acid and glutamine were identified by their chromatographic behavior (e.g. retention time, UV absorption spectra, co-elution with standards) (13.Chang J.Y. Knecht R. Braun D.G. Biochem. J. 1981; 199: 547-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). For structural elucidation ofl-glutamic acid and glutamine, bioactive materials eluted by HPLC were injected into a liquid chromatograph in tandem with a mass spectrometer (LC/MS) using a 2.1 × 100-mm ODS Hypersil column (Hewlett Packard). The LC/MS was run at 0.5 ml/min. Buffers were A= water with 0.1% formic acid and B = acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid, with the gradient set at 20.5% B to 75% B in 35 min using buffer A as a diluent. The mass spectrometer used was a Platform II (Micromass Instruments, Beverly, MA) operated using atmospheric pressure chemical ionization and operated such that scans of opposite polarity were obtained on alternating scans (alternating positive/negative ion mode). The instrument was scanned from mass 100 to 600 in 1 s, with a 0.1-s interscan time. In this manner, full positive and negative ion mass spectra were obtained from a single chromatographic analysis. RT-PCR analysis of BMVEC and HMVEC mRNA levels was performed using DNase-treated total RNA as previously described (14.Taylor C.T. Fueki N. Agah A. Hershberg R.M. Colgan S.P. J. Biol.

All cDNA was synthesized with random primers using the reverse transcription system (Promega, Madison WI) according to the manufacturer's protocol. cDNA was amplified in 50-μl reactions containing 2 μl of the cDNA reaction mix, 1× PCR buffer (Invitrogen) (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.4, 50 mm KCl), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 200 μm of each dNTP, and 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). Reactions were heated to 94 °C for 5 min before adding 20 pmol of each primer. Each primer set was then amplified at 94 °C for 30 s, 56 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s for the indicated number of cycles followed by a 10-min extension at 72 °C. The PCR reactions were then visualized on a 1.8% agarose gel containing 0.06 μg/ml ethidium bromide. Bands were digitized using an electrophoresis documentation and analysis system and analyzed by one-dimensional analysis software (Kodak Digital Science). Net band intensity (background subtracted intensity) was normalized to values for β-actin and plotted as relative units. Water samples or RNA samples containing no reverse transcriptase were amplified in parallel to ensure that no contaminating DNA was present during PCR (data not shown). PCR products for human endothelial mGluR1, mGluR4, and mGluR5 were gel-purified using a Qiagen gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), ligated into a pGEM-T vector, and transformed using the pGEM-T Easy vector system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The predicted nucleotide sequence for each mGluR was confirmed by sequencing (Harvard sequencing core) several colonies from each mGluR ligation (data not shown). For probe production,EcoRI-digested fragments were gel-purified using a Qiagen gel extraction kit (Qiagen) and labeled with biotin-16-dUTP, and the probes were separated with spin columns. For mGluR analysis by in situ hybridization, human BMVEC or HMVEC were grown to confluence on LabTech tissue culture microscope slides (Nalge Nunc International, Rochester, NY). After aspirating the media, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, PBS (10 min) and washed in PBS/MgCl2 (5 mm). All materials were kept RNase-free throughout the procedure. Before hybridization, the cells were hydrated in 0.2 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 0.1m glycine for 10 min and then changed to 50% formamide, 2× SSC (SSC contains 0.15 m NaCl, 0.015 msodium citrate, pH 7.0) at 65 °C for 15 min. Although the cells were being hydrated, the probe (80–100 liters probe), 4 μl ofEscherichia coli tRNA (Sigma), and 4 μl of salmon sperm DNA (Sigma) were melted in 10–30 liters of 100% formamide (Sigma) at 90 °C for 10 min. An equal volume of hybridization mix was added for a final concentration of 50% formamide, 2× SSC, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 10 mm vanadyl sulfate-ribonucleoside complex (Invitrogen), 10% dextran sulfate, and 1 g/ml each E. colitRNA and salmon sperm DNA. The final concentration of the probe was 80–100 ng/30 μl hybridization. The probe and hybridization mix were added to the tissue culture slides, the covers replaced, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C (4–16 h) in a closed, 2× SSC-saturated chamber. After hybridization, the cells were washed with 2× SSC, 50% formamide for 30 min at 37 °C, then in 1× SSC, 50% formamide for 30 min at 37 °C, and twice in 1× SSC at room temperature for 30 min. The cells were incubated in 4× SSC-1% bovine serum albumin with avidin-FITC (2 μg/ml) for 30 min and washed 3 times in 2× SSC at room temperature on a rotating shaker. The cells were mounted in antifade mounting medium and covered and viewed on a Leica confocal scanning microscope. Control BMVEC and HMVEC were incubated in RNase A (100 μg/ml in 2× SSC for 1 h at 37 °C) to determine the specificity of the probe for RNA. After incubation in RNase A, the cells were hybridized as described above and incubated with avidin-FITC, washed, and viewed by confocal microscopy. A second negative control preparation consisted of BMVEC and HMVEC hybridized with a porcine mannose binding lectin cDNA probe, washed, then reacted with FITC-avidin and viewed on a confocal microscope. Allin situ hybridization studies were done in triplicate. Confluent human BMVEC and HMVEC grown on coverslips were washed in PBS, fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde, 100 mm cacodylate buffer for 10 min at room temperature, and washed again. The coverslips were incubated with rabbit anti-mGluR1 (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), mGluR4, or mGluR5 (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA) polyclonal Ab for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, the slips were incubated with FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) or rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The coverslips were washed (×3; 10 min each), mounted with anti-fade mounting media (Molecular Probes), and analyzed with a Zeiss confocal microscope as previously described (15.Collard C.D. Bukusoglu C. Agah A. Colgan S.P. Reenstra W.R. Morgan B.P. Stahl G.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C450-C458Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Controls incubated with FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG only were processed as above, omitting the primary antibody to determine nonspecific binding. Additionally, some coverslips were incubated with an irrelevant, isotype control rabbit anti-rat mannose binding lectin polyclonal Ab. All analyses were conducted at the same pinhole, voltage, and laser settings. This experiment was performed three times (n = 3). Confluent human BMVEC were labeled with biotin and lysed, and the cell debris was removed by centrifugation (16.Zünd G. Uezono S. Stahl G.L. Dzus A.L. McGowan F.X. Hickey P.R. Colgan S.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1571-C1580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell lysates were pre-cleared with 50 μl of preequilibrated protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Overnight immunoprecipitation of mGluRs was performed by the addition of anti-mGluR1, mGluR4, and mGluR5 polyclonal Ab (10 μg/ml) or control Ab directed against cAMP response element-binding protein (Upstate Biotechnology) and 50 μl of preequilibrated protein G-Sepharose. Washed immunoprecipitates were boiled in Laemmli buffer plus 20 mm dithiothreitol, separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose (Bio-Rad) and blocked overnight in blocking buffer. Biotinylated proteins were labeled with streptavidin-peroxidase and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Biosciences). Confluent BMVEC 100-mm Petri dishes were treated with indicated concentrations of glutamate, DHPG (10 μm), and l-AP4 (10 μm) for 0–50 min. As a positive control, separate BMVEC dishes were treated with forskolin (10 μm) for 15 min. The dishes were washed with HBSS and then scraped with Laemmli buffer plus 20 mmdithiothreitol. BMVEC lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and the membranes were blocked with 10% nonfat dry milk. The membranes were then incubated with murine anti-human VASP mAb (1 μg/ml; BD Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) for 1 h at 20 °C. The membranes were then washed 5 times with PBS/Tris buffer and incubated with a 1:2000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG antibody (Sigma) for 1 h at 20 °C. Labeled bands were detected by ECL. Alterations in BBB permeability in vivo were determined in a hypoxic mouse model (17.Furuta G.T. Turner J.R. Taylor C.T. Hershberg R.M. Comerford K.M. Narravula S.

As guided by previousin vivo studies using mGluR agonists and antagonists in rodents (18.Tizzano J.P. Griffey K.I. Schoepp D.D.

The mice were then gavaged with 4.4-kDa FITC-dextran (60 mg/100 gm of body weight) and immediately placed into a hypoxia chamber (8% O2) or back into their cage (21% O2) for 4 h. The mice were then sacrificed, and the brains were removed and weighed. After sonication and centrifugation to remove cellular debris, the fluorescence intensity (excitation, 485 nm; emission, 530 nm) of each brain sample was measured (Cytofluor 2300, Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) and normalized to the serum fluorescence and expressed as a permeability index. Control tissues derived from mice not administered FITC-dextran were used as background controls for fluorescence. The PMN marker myeloperoxidase was quantified as previously described (20.Amsterdam E.A. Stahl G.L. Pan H.L. Rendig S.V. Fletcher M.P. Longhurst J.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: H448-H457PubMed Google Scholar) in brain homogenates. This protocol was in accordance with NIH guidelines for use of live animals and was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Brigham and Women's Hospital. All data presented represent the mean and S.E. for n determinations. Data analyses were performed using Sigma Stat (Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA). A pvalue of < 0.05 was considered significant. Transendothelial FITC-dextran flux across endothelial monolayers was normalized to untreated cells and analyzed by one- or two-way analysis of variance. All pairwise multiple comparisons were made using the Student-Newman-Keuls test. FITC-dextran flux across the BBB in hypoxic mice is presented as a permeability index calculated as the ratio of measured brain to serum fluorescence. We have previously demonstrated that upon activation, PMNs release AMP and adenosine, which through activation of surface adenosine receptors provide a resealing mechanism during PMN transendothelial migration (2.Lennon P.F. Taylor C.T. Stahl G.L. Colgan S.P. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1433-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Here, we pursued the existence of additional pathways for regulation of barrier function by PMNs. Initial studies were undertaken to screen supernatants derived from fMLF (10−8m)-stimulated PMNs. As shown in Fig. 1 A, the addition of the activated PMN supernatants significantly decreased transendothelial FITC-dextran flux compared with untreated, control cells (Fig. 1, panel A). Because we have previously demonstrated no apparent endothelial uptake of FITC-dextran, no influence of fMLF (10−8-10-10m) on FITC-dextran transendothelial flux, and no quenching of FITC-dextran fluorescence by activated PMN supernatants (2.Lennon P.F. Taylor C.T. Stahl G.L. Colgan S.P. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1433-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), we concluded that a PMN-derived soluble mediator(s) decreases endothelial pe"

Here we show that perlecans immunopurified from three cellular sources possess different HS structures and subsequently different FGF-2 binding and activating capabilities. Perlecan isolated from human umbilical arterial endothelial cells (HUAEC) and a continuous endothelial cell line (C11 STH) bound similar amounts of FGF-2 either alone or complexed with FGFRα1-IIIc or FGFR3α-IIIc. Both perlecans stimulated the growth of BaF3 cell lines expressing FGFR1b/c; however, only HUAEC perlecan stimulated those cells expressing FGFR3c, suggesting that the source of perlecan confers FGF and FGFR binding specificity. Despite these differences in FGF-2 activation, the level of 2-O-and 6-O-sulfation was similar for both perlecans. Interestingly, perlecan isolated from a colon carcinoma cell line that was capable of binding FGF-2 was incapable of activating any BaF3 cell line unless the HS was removed from the protein core. The HS chains also exhibited greater bioactivity after digestion with heparinase III. Collectively, these data clearly demonstrate that the bioactivity of HS decorating a single PG is dependent on its cell source and that subtle changes in structure including secondary interactions have a profound effect on biological activity.

Perlecan consists of five distinct domains. Domains II–V are homologous to protein motifs found in epidermal growth factor, neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), and laminin, although domain I is unique to perlecan and contains three potential heparan sulfate (HS) chain attachment sites.

Nearly half of all perlecan null mice die at embryonic day 10.5, the normal onset of perlecan expression, or just after birth with severe defects including aberrant basement membrane formation (particularly in the heart), defective cephalic and long bone development, and achondroplasia (17.Arikawa-Hirasawa E.

Similar abnormalities in cartilage development and bone ossification have been identified in mice with activating mutations in fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor 3.

Perlecan has also been shown to regulate FGF-2 activity in vitro (16.Aviezer D. Hecht D. Safran M. Eisinger M. David G. Yayon A.

HS (or heparin, a widely available analogue of sulfated domains in HS) is essential to FGF-2 cell signaling, as demonstrated by the fact that addition of heparin or HSPG was shown to restore growth in FGF-responsive HSPG-deficient cells (19.Yayon A.

FGF-2 interacts with a specific HS sequence that consists of a hexasaccharide containing 2-O-sulfated iduronic acid (IdoUA(2S)) andN-sulfated glucosamine (GlcNS) (22.Guimond S. Maccarana M. Olwin B.B. Lindahl U. Rapraeger A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23906-23914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For receptor signaling, a dodecasaccharide containing this binding region as well as 6-O-sulfated GlcNS residues is also required (23.Pye D.A. Kumar S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 248: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The role of heparin/HS in enhancing FGF-2 binding and signaling remains controversial. Some studies (22.Guimond S. Maccarana M.

In either case heparin/HS is believed to facilitate FGFR dimerization and subsequent activation. The ability to stimulate FGF-2 activity relies on the primary sequence, structure, and organization of HS, which is dependent on cell type and differentiation state (16.Aviezer D. Hecht D. Safran M.

Matrix Biol. 1999; 18: 163-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) that perlecan HS chains isolated from arterial and venous endothelial cells differed in their ability to bind FGF-2 and to adhere to vascular cells. In this study we have investigated the HS chains of perlecans isolated from three different cell types using binding assays, the BaF3 cell system, and HS structural analysis techniques. We report that the source of perlecan significantly influences its HS substructure and subsequently its ability to bind FGF-2 and to promote FGF-2 signaling through FGFRs.

After washing with PBS, 100-μl aliquots of rabbit anti-mouse antibody conjugated to protein A-Sepharose were incubated with either mAbA76 (20 μg/tube), or perlecan·FGF-2 samples for 2 h. Perlecan·FGF-2 samples were then added to pre-washed A76-protein A-Sepharose beads and incubated at RT for 2 h. The beads were washed extensively with PBS and bound counts/min determined on an automated gamma counter (Wallac, Finland). Perlecan was biotinylated essentially as described by Coleet al. (32.Cole S.R. Ashman L.K. Ey P.L. Mol. Immunol. 1987; 24: 699-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). A 100 μg/ml solution of perlecan in 0.1m NaHCO3, pH 8.0, was incubated with a 50-fold molar excess of N-hydroxysuccinimide-biotin for 3 h at RT. Biotinylation was stopped by the addition of 2 mNH4Cl, and excess biotin was removed by dialysis against PBS for 48 h. Ligand binding experiments were performed using a BIAcore 2000 instrument (Amersham Biosciences). The BIAcore technique has been described previously (33.Jonsson U. Fagerstam L. Ivarsson B. Johnsson B. Karlsson R. Lundh K. Lofas S. Persson B. Roos H. Ronnberg I. BioTechniques. 1991; 11: 620-627PubMed Google Scholar). Similar amounts of biotinylated perlecans (10 μg/ml) in PBS were coupled to different flow cells of a streptavidin-derivatized sensor chip at a flow rate of 5 μl/min, as determined by the change in response units. Binding experiments were performed at a flow rate of 20 μl/min at 25 °C. The injected volume of analyte was 55 μl, and the kinject function was used with a programmed dissociation time of 150 s. For titration of FGF-2 against bound perlecans, stock solutions of FGF-2 were serially diluted in HBS-EP (0.01 m HEPES, 0.15m NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0.005% (v/v) polysorbate 20, pH 7.4) running buffer to concentrations in the interval 6.25–400 nm. Competitive binding experiments were performed on 100 nm FGF-2 incubated with or without 100 mm NaCl or 0.1 μg/ml heparin. FGFR1α-IIIc and FGFR3α-IIIc fusion proteins (50 nm) were incubated with or without 50 nmFGF-2 in 0.01 m HEPES, 0.15 m NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.01% Tween 20, pH 7.4, running buffer for 5 min prior to injection. The perlecan surface was regenerated with a 30-s pulse of 1 m NaCl or 100 μg/ml heparin. Sensograms were analyzed using the BIAcore 2000 Evaluation Software 3.0. Sensograms were fitted with separate differential rate equations for the parts of the curve representing association and dissociation. The closeness of fit for each kinetic parameter is described by the statistical value χ2. HS chains were liberated from the protein core by incubation of [3H]perlecan (1 × 105 cpm) in Milli-Q H2O with 200 μg/ml Pronase for 8 h at 37 °C. Free HS chains were de-salted by size fractionation on a PD-10 column into Milli-Q H2O and lyophilized. HS chains (1 × 104 cpm) were depolymerized with heparinase I or heparinase III at a concentration of 0.025 units/ml in PBS. Samples were incubated for 16 h at 37 °C, and the reaction was stopped by heating at 100 °C for 5 min. Cleavage of intact perlecan HS chains by HNO2 treatment at low pH (pH 1.5) was carried out by the method of Shively and Conrad (34.Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3932-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). Briefly, equal volumes of 1 m Ba(NO2)2 and 1m H2SO4 were mixed and centrifuged for 5 min at 10,000 rpm to remove precipitated BaSO4. The resulting HNO2 (100 μl) was added to lyophilized [3H]perlecan HS samples (1 × 104 cpm) and incubated for 30 min at RT. Reaction was stopped by the addition of 2 m Na2CO3 (10 μl). Superose 6 gel filtration was performed essentially as described by Melrose and Ghosh (35.Melrose J. Ghosh P. J. Chromatogr. 1993; 637: 91-95Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). A Superose TM 6 pre-packed HR 10/30 (Amersham Biosciences) column was equilibrated with 0.5 m CH3COONa, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.5, at 0.4 ml/min. Whole perlecan HS and heparinase I/III-cleaved chains (1 × 104 cpm; 200 μl) were injected onto the column and 2-min (0.8 ml) fractions collected. Aliquots of each fraction were measured in a Packard scintillation counter to generate an elution profile. Separation of heparinase III and nitrous acid cleavage-resistant oligosaccharides was performed on a Bio-Gel P-10 column (120 × 1 cm) equilibrated with 0.1 m NaCl, pH 8. Heparinase III- or HNO2-cleaved HS chains (1 × 104 cpm; 200 μl) were loaded onto the column and eluted at 4 ml/h. 1-ml fractions were collected, and radioactivity was determined using liquid scintillation. The percentage of susceptible linkages in the size groups corresponding to degree of polymerization dp2–dp12 (dp = degree of polymerization, or number of saccharide units,e.g. dp2 = disaccharide) resolved using Bio-Gel P-10 is given by the formula An/n, where An is the percentage of the total 3H counts eluting in a specific peak, and n is the number of disaccharide repeat units in the oligosaccharide corresponding to that peak. Perlecan [3H]HS chains (5 × 104 cpm) were digested with a combination of heparinases I–III (0.1 unit/ml, 16 h at 37 °C). Disaccharides (50–90% of total HS counts) were recovered from a Bio-Gel P-2 column (120 × 1 cm) eluted at 4 ml/h in 0.1 mNH4HCO3 with collection of 1-ml fractions. Disaccharides were analyzed by strong anion-exchange high pressure liquid chromatography on a ProPac PA-1 column eluted with a linear gradient of 0–1 m NaCl in MilliQ water, pH 3.5, at a flow rate of 1 ml/min (36.Turnbull J.E. Fernig D.G. Ke Y. Wilkinson M.C. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10337-10341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fractions of 0.5 ml were counted, and disaccharides were identified by comparison of elution positions with known standards. The ability of the different perlecans to stimulate a heparin-dependent biological response to FGF-2 was examined in HSPG-deficient myeloid cell lines (BaF3) expressing splice variants of the FGFR1 isoform (FGFR1b and -c) and of the FGFR3 isoform (FGFR3c) (20.Ornitz D.M. Yayon A. Flanagan J.G. Svahn C.M. Levi E. Leder P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 240-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). FGFR1b/c and FGFR3c cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium, supplemented with 10% FCS, 10% conditioned media from WEHI-3BD−cells, G418 (400 μg/ml), and penicillin/streptomycin. Mitogenic assays were performed essentially as described by Ornitz et al. (20.Ornitz D.M. Yayon A. Flanagan J.G. Svahn C.M. Levi E. Leder P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 240-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed, resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FCS, and seeded into 96-well plates at 6 × 105 cells/50 μl/well. The volume in the wells was made up to 100 μl with RPMI 1640 medium containing final concentrations of 2 μg/ml heparin or 1.25 μg/ml perlecan and 5 nm FGF-2. For the free HS chain assay, whole HS chains or HS chains digested with heparinase I or heparinase III were added to a final concentration of 5 μg/ml. Plates were then incubated at 37 °C for 40 h. Cell proliferation was assayed by [3H]thymidine uptake with 0.5 μCi of [3H]thymidine in 20 μl of media being added to each well and incubated for 6 h. Cells were pelleted in the wells by centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 5 min and the supernatant flicked into waste. Cells were then washed three times by the addition of 200 μl of PBS per well and centrifuged followed by flicking to waste. After the final wash, cells were resuspended in 100 μl of PBS, vortexed in 2 ml of scintillation fluid, and counted on an automated scintillation liquid analyzer (Packard Instrument Co.). Significant differences were determined using analysis of variance Student-Newman-Keuls tests. Unless otherwise stated, results from all static binding studies and BaF3 experiments are expressed as the means ± S.E. of three and four observations, respectively. All experiments were performed at least twice. Perlecans derived from either HUAEC, C11 STH, or WiDr were assessed for their ability to bind soluble FGF-2 after coating wells of a 96-well microtiter plate with perlecan (Fig. 1 A) or by immunoprecipitation of the complex in conditioned medium with anti-perlecan antibodies (Fig. 1 B). In both assays, WiDr perlecan bound significantly more 125I-FGF-2 than either HUAEC or C11 STH perlecan (Fig. 1 A, p < 0.05; Fig. 1 B,p < 0.001), indicating that WiDr perlecan-HS possessed a greater number of FGF-2-binding sites than either HUAEC or C11 STH perlecan-HS. Perlecan derived from either endothelial cell line bound similar amounts of 125I-FGF-2 with C11 STH perlecan binding a little more when coated onto microtiter wells (Fig. 1 A). This difference was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). BIAcore was used to assess binding of FGF-2 to immobilized perlecans under flow conditions. Fig. 2 shows a composite sensorgram of FGF-2 binding the three different perlecans. Fig. 2, curve a, shows the binding to HUAEC perlecan, andcurve b indicates the binding to C11 STH perlecan, andcurve c shows the binding to WiDr perlecan. Both HUAEC and C11 STH perlecans bound FGF-2 very efficiently and to a similar extent. In contrast to the static assays, immobilized WiDr perlecan exhibited very little binding of FGF-2, suggesting immobilization of WiDr to the BIAcore chip has a negative effect on FGF-2 binding, possibly due to steric constraints. The addition of 5 mm MgCl2to the binding buffer had no effect on binding (data not shown). The amount of binding demonstrated to WiDr perlecan was similar to that seen to the protein core of either C11 STH or HUAEC perlecan (Fig. 3, A and B). To rule out the possibility that the conjugation chemistry had removed the HS from WiDr perlecan, we confirmed the presence of HS attached to WiDr perlecan before and after the biotinylation procedure by probing with the anti-HS antibody, 10E4 (data not shown). The interaction of FGF-2 with HUAEC (Fig. 3 A) and C11 STH (Fig. 3 B) perlecan was shown to be HS-dependent with binding reduced by either the addition of salt (Fig. 3, curves b) or heparin (Fig. 3, curves c) to the binding buffer. There was also limited binding to the protein core of both the perlecans (Fig. 3,curves d) most likely due to HS remaining after heparinase III digestion (see Fig. 7).Figure 3FGF-2 binding to immobilized perlecans in the presence of salt and heparin. 100 nm FGF-2 alone (curve a), or preincubated for 5 min at RT with either 100 mm NaCl (curve b) or 0.5 μg/ml heparin (curve c), was applied to HUAEC (A) or C11 STH (B) perlecan-coated surfaces as indicated in the legend of Fig. 2. Curve d represents binding of 100 nmFGF-2 to perlecan pretreated with heparinase III (0.025 units/ml, 24 h at 37 °C). The result is representative of at least three separate experiments.

An initial reaction that resulted in a rapid rise in response units followed by a secondary binding that was demonstrated by the shallower gradient of the binding curve. To assess what might be causing each of the binding phases, we analyzed the binding of FGF-2 in the presence of salt (Fig. 3, curves b) or heparin (Fig. 3,curves c). The initial fast interaction was decreased quite effectively with either salt or heparin competition, indicating that this phase of binding between the HS and FGF-2 was ionic. The secondary binding phase was also reduced in the presence of heparin but increased in the presence of salt. The HS-FGF-2 interaction was assumed to be 1:1, and kinetic constants were fitted separately to the endothelial perlecan sensorgrams at FGF-2 concentrations that did not exhibit the secondary binding phase (<50 nm). HUAEC perlecan gave ak a ≈ 1.0 × 106,k d ≈2.0 × 10−3, andK d ≈2 nm (χ2≈2.9). This was similar to the binding constants calculated for C11 STH perlecan, which gave a k a ≈ 1.4 × 106, k d ≈ 1.7 × 10−3, and K d ≈ 1 nm(χ2 ≈1.8).

https://openalex.org/W2082457469,"Prostaglandin E2(PGE2) production involves the activity of a multistep biosynthetic pathway. The terminal components of this cascade, two PGE2 synthases (PGES), have very recently been identified as glutathione-dependent proteins. cPGES is cytoplasmic, apparently identical to the hsp90 chaperone, p23, and associates functionally with prostaglandin-endoperoxide H synthase-1 (PGHS-1), the constitutive cyclooxygenase. A second synthase, designated mPGES, is microsomal and can be regulated. Here we demonstrate that mPGES and PGHS-2 are expressed at very low levels in untreated human orbital fibroblasts. Interleukin (IL)-1β treatment elicits high levels of PGHS-2 and mPGES expression. The induction of both enzymes occurs at the pretranslational level, is the consequence of enhanced gene promoter activities, and can be blocked by dexamethasone (10 nm). SC58125, a PGHS-2-selective inhibitor, could attenuate the induction of mPGES, suggesting a dependence of this enzyme on PGHS-2 activity. IL-1β treatment activates p38 and ERK mitogen-activated protein kinases. Induction of both mPGES and PGHS-2 was susceptible to either chemical inhibition or molecular interruption of these pathways with dominant negative constructs. These results indicate that the induction of PGHS-2 and mPGES by IL-1β underlies robust PGE2 production in orbital fibroblasts.

The past decade has witnessed dramatic advances in our understanding of the prostanoid biosynthetic pathways in mammalian cells. Of particular importance was the discovery and molecular characterization of two cyclooxygenase isoforms and the realization that each protein might possess distinct functions and patterns of expression and regulation (1.Smith W.L.

Both are glutathione-dependent and catalyze the terminal conversion reaction of PGH2 to PGE2. One enzyme is a constitutively expressed cytosolic protein, designated cPGES (12.Tanioka T. Nakatani Y. Semmyo N. Murakami M. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32775-32782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). Evidence has been advanced indicating that cPGES is identical to p23, a putative chaperone of hsp90 that stabilizes steroid hormone receptor-hsp90 complexes (14.Freeman B.C. Felts S.J. Toft D.O. Yamamoto K.R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 422-434PubMed Google Scholar). It exhibits substantial constitutive expression in many tissues. Moreover, this expression was reported to be invariant in several cell lines in vitro with regard to treatment with IL-1β or TNF-α (12.Tanioka T. Nakatani Y. Semmyo N. Murakami M. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32775-32782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). cPGES protein was found to be induced modestly in rat brain 48 h after injection of lipopolysaccharide (12.Tanioka T. Nakatani Y. Semmyo N. Murakami M. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32775-32782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). The other isoform, mPGES, is a 16-kDa microsomal protein that can be regulated (11.Jakobsson P.-J. Thorén S. Morgenstern R. Samuelsson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7220-7225Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar, 13.Murakami M. Naraba H. Tanioka T. Semmyo N. Nakatani Y. Kojima F. Ikeda T. Fueki M. Ueno A. Oh-ishi S. Kudo I. J. Biol.

This enzyme may be expressed and regulated in a cell type-specific manner. mPGES is induced by lipopolysaccharide in rat macrophages, and this up-regulation can be blocked by the glucocorticoid, dexamethasone (13.Murakami M. Naraba H. Tanioka T. Semmyo N. Nakatani Y. Kojima F. Ikeda T. Fueki M. Ueno A. Oh-ishi S. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32783-32792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). Neither treatment altered the levels of cPGES in macrophages. Thus mPGES represents a regulated enzyme and a potentially important drug target. Very recent studies imply a preferential, functional association of each PGES isoform with a particular PGHS enzyme (12.Tanioka T. Nakatani Y. Semmyo N. Murakami M. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32775-32782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar,13.Murakami M. Naraba H. Tanioka T. Semmyo N. Nakatani Y. Kojima F. Ikeda T. Fueki M. Ueno A. Oh-ishi S. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32783-32792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). The studies demonstrated that cPGES is linked to PGHS-1 and that mPGES utilizes PGH2 generated by PGHS-2. Further studies have extended the notion that functional, stimuli-dependent linkage exists between specific PGHS isoforms and cell type-specific downstream enzymes (15.Ueno N. Murakami M. Tanioka T. Fujimori K. Tanabe T. Urade Y. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34918-34927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). These observations were made in transfected cells where one or more of the relevant enzymes had been over-expressed. Importantly, nothing is known currently about whether the expression of endogenous PGHS isoforms might in some way exhibit physiological coordination with that of the PGES enzymes. Such a coupling would be consistent with a model of PGE2production that exhibited functional cellular compartmentalization. Fibroblasts have been shown to express components of the prostanoid biosynthetic pathways, and cultures derived from particular anatomic regions and tissues can generate large amounts of PGE2 when provoked (16.Smith T.J. Exp. Clin. Endocrinol. Diabetes. 1999; 107 (Suppl.): S160-S163Google Scholar). These sentinel cells are critical to the orchestration of inflammatory responses, tissue remodeling, and wound healing and are key participants in the evolution of fibrosis (17.Smith R.S. Smith T.J. Blieden T.M. Phipps R.P. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 151: 317-322PubMed Google Scholar). Diversity among human fibroblasts has only recently been appreciated as being potentially important to normal tissue function and disease manifestation. It is now clear that fibroblast subsets represent highly specialized cells that participate in reactive processes in the context of both normal function and pathology (18.Smith T.J. Sempowski G.D.

Human orbital fibroblasts exhibit a phenotype that sets them apart from fibroblasts derived from other anatomic regions. They are composed of discrete subsets (18.Smith T.J. Sempowski G.D. Wang H.-S. Del Vecchio P.J. Lippe S.D. Phipps R.P. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1995; 80: 2620-2625Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), one of which represents pre-adipocytes (21.Sorisky A. Pardasani D. Gagnon A.

Of particular relevance to their proposed participation in orbital inflammation are the robust responses to a variety of disease mediators such as cytokines, growth factors, and bioactive lipids (25.Wang H.-S. Cao H.J. Winn V.D. Rezanka L.J. Frobert Y. Evans C.H. Sciaky D. Young D.A. Smith T.J. J. Biol.

Endocrinol. Metab. 1995; 80: 3553-3560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These fibroblasts have been implicated in the pathogenesis of thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy (TAO), an autoimmune process. Two hallmarks of the tissue remodeling observed in TAO are the accumulation of hyaluronan and an often intense inflammatory reaction (30.Hufnagel T.J. Hickey W.F. Cobbs W.H. Jakobiec F.A. Iwamoto T. Eagle R.C. Ophthalmology. 1984; 91: 1411-1419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that it is this set of attributes that renders connective tissues in the human orbit susceptible to the remodeling associated with TAO. Among the characteristics that set apart orbital fibroblasts is the dramatic up-regulation of PGE2 synthesis observed following exposure of these cells in culture to proinflammatory cytokines (25.Wang H.-S. Cao H.J. Winn V.D. Rezanka L.J. Frobert Y. Evans C.H. Sciaky D. Young D.A. Smith T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22718-22728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar,26.Cao H.J. Smith T.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C1075-C1085Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These increases in PGE2 can be blocked by specific inhibitors such as SC58125 and NS-398, suggesting a dominant role for PGHS-2 in mediating the up-regulation (25.Wang H.-S. Cao H.J. Winn V.D.

In fact, orbital fibroblasts when provoked by IL-1β or leukoregulin or through engagement of surface-displayed CD40 by CD154, exhibit a particularly robust induction of PGHS-2 (25.Wang H.-S. Cao H.J. Winn V.D. Rezanka L.J. Frobert Y. Evans C.H. Sciaky D. Young D.A. Smith T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22718-22728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 26.Cao H.J.

Here, we report that the treatment of orbital fibroblasts with IL-1β results in dramatic increases in PGE2 production and is associated with coordinate induction of both PGHS-2 and mPGES expression. These responses are mediated through elevations in the steady-state levels of their respective mRNAs and involve the use of overlapping intracellular signaling pathways, including the p38 and ERK mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases. Inhibiting PGHS-2 activity results in the blockade of mPGES induction by IL-1β, indicating some involvement of the products of the former enzyme in the expression of the latter. These latest findings provide insights into the complex interactions between PGHS-2 and mPGES in orbital fibroblasts that culminate in the generation of PGE2. SC58125 was obtained form Searle (Skokie, IL). Dexamethasone (1,4 pregnadien-9-fluoro-16α-methyl-11β,17α,21-triol-3,20-dione), 5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole (DRB), arachidonate, and cycloheximide were from Sigma. IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-4, TNF-α, and TGF-β were purchased from BIOSOURCE (Camarillo, CA). Interferon γ was obtained from Invitrogen. The cDNA encoding the human mPGES and antibodies directed against human mPGES protein were kindly provided by Dr. Per-Johan Jakobsson (Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden). An affinity-purified antibody against cPGES was kindly provided by Prof. I. Kudo (Showa University, Tokyo, Japan). PD98059 and SB203580 were obtained from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). p23 (cPGES) cDNA was a kind gift of Dr. David Toft (Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN); full-length human PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 cDNAs were gifts from Dr. Kerry O'Banion (University of Rochester, Rochester, NY), and the plasmid designated −1800pGL2, containing a 1.8-kb fragment of the human PGHS-2 promoter, was generously supplied by Dr. Stephen M. Prescott (University of Utah, Salt Lake City). A dominant negative (DN) expression vector for p38 was generously provided by Dr. Roger Davis (University of Massachusetts, Worcester, MA), and the DN expression vector for ERK 1 was a gift from Dr. Melanie Cobb (Southwestern School of Medicine, Dallas, TX). Monoclonal antibodies directed against both human PGHS isoforms were purchased from Cayman (Ann Arbor, MI). Recombinant human CD154 was kindly supplied by Dr. R. P. Phipps (Rochester, NY) and prepared by the method of Kehry (32.Kehry M.R. Castle B.E. Semin. Immunol. 1994; 6: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). PGE2 radioimmunoassay kits were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Antibodies against p38 and ERK were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Orbital fibroblast cultures were initiated from tissue explants obtained as surgical waste during decompression surgery from severe TAO or were from normal appearing orbital tissues in patients undergoing surgery for non-inflammatory conditions. These activities have been approved by the Institutional Review Boards of Albany Medical College and Harbor-UCLA Medical Center. Some of the fibroblast strains were kindly provided by Dr. Rebecca Bahn (Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN). Tissue fragments were generated by mechanical disruption of explants, and fibroblasts were then allowed to adhere to plastic culture plates. They were covered with Eagle's medium to which 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), glutamine (435 μg/ml), and penicillin/streptomycin were added as described previously (33.Smith T.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 79: 1493-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Medium was changed every 3–4 days, and monolayers were maintained in a 5% CO2, humidified incubator at 37 °C. Culture strains were utilized between the second and twelfth passage from initiation. All experimental manipulations were conducted after a state of confluence had been reached. We have already established the purity of these cultures and found them to be essentially free of contamination by endothelial and smooth muscle cells (18.Smith T.J. Sempowski G.D. Wang H.-S. Del Vecchio P.J. Lippe S.D. Phipps R.P. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1995; 80: 2620-2625Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fibroblasts were cultivated in 100-mm-diameter plates to a confluent state and were then treated with the test agents specified in the figure legends. Cellular RNA was extracted from rinsed monolayers by the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (34.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar) with an RNA isolating system purchased from Biotecx (Houston, TX). The nucleic acid was subjected to electrophoresis through denaturing 1% agarose, formaldehyde gels. Integrity of the RNA was established by determining the 260/280 spectroscopic ratios and by staining the electrophoresed samples with ethidium bromide and inspecting them under UV light. The RNA was transferred to Zeta-probe membrane (Bio-Rad), and immobilized samples were hybridized with [32P]dCTP-labeled PGHS-1, PGHS-2, p23, and mPGES cDNA probes generated by the random primer method. Hybridization was conducted in a solution containing 5× SSC, 50% formamide, 5× Denhardt's solution, 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 6.5), 1% SDS, and 0.25 mg/ml salmon sperm at 48 °C overnight. Membranes were washed under high stringency conditions, and then the RNA/DNA hybrids were visualized by autoradiography on X-Omat film (Kodak, Rochester, NY) following exposure at −70 °C. Bands resulting from radioactive hybrids were scanned by densitometry. Membranes were then stripped according to the instructions of the manufacturer and rehybridized with a GAPDH cDNA probe, and the band densities were normalized to this signal. For mPGES and PGHS-2 mRNA stability studies, cultures were treated with IL-1β for 3 h as a pretreatment. Cells were washed and incubated in growth medium for 4 h. At time 0, DRB (20 μg/ml), an inhibitor of gene transcription, was added to the medium of all plates without or with IL-1β (10 ng/ml) for the intervals indicated in Fig. 4. Abundance of mRNAs for the two enzymes was quantified by Northern blot hybridization. mPGES and PGHS-2 mRNA signals were normalized to their respective GAPDH levels. Cellular proteins were solubilized from rinsed fibroblast monolayers following the treatments indicated in the figure legends. The ice-cold harvest buffer contained 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and 10 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Lysates were taken up in Laemmli buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the separated proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). Primary monoclonal antibodies directed against PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 (10 μg/ml, Cayman) were incubated with the membranes for 2 h at room temperature. Following washes, membranes were reincubated with secondary peroxidase-labeled antibodies. In other experiments, primary antibodies directed against human mPGES and cPGES were utilized for the detection of these enzyme proteins. The ECL (Amersham Biosciences) chemiluminescence detection system was used to generate signals, and the resulting bands were analyzed with a densitometer. With regard to assessing the activation of p38 and ERK MAP kinases, cell lysates from untreated orbital fibroblast cultures and those treated with IL-1β (10 ng/ml) were subjected to SDS-PAGE; the proteins were transferred to membrane and then probed with phospho-specific antibodies against the two kinases. Fibroblasts were grown to confluence in 24-well plastic cluster plates in medium containing 10% FBS. Monolayers were shifted to serum-free medium for the final 24 h of incubation. IL-1β and the other test compounds were added at the times and concentrations indicated in the figure legends. Medium was removed from the cultures, and the monolayers were covered with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) in the presence of the respective agents for the final 30 min of the treatment period. PBS was collected quantitatively, clarified by centrifugation, and subjected to PGE2 radioimmunoassay using a commercially available kit (Amersham Biosciences). For studies involving the transient transfection of human fibroblasts, cultures were allowed to proliferate to 80–90% confluence in medium containing 10% FBS. With regard to assessment of promoter activities, a 510-bp fragment spanning −538 to −28 of the putative mPGES promoter was cloned with the Human GenomeWalker kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) according to the instructions of the supplier. Two reverse primers used for the PCR reactions included 5′-CGCAGCTCAACTGTGGGTGTGATC-3′ and 5′-GTGATCAGCTCGACAGAGGAGCAG-3′. The amplified fragment was sequenced and subcloned from pCR2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) into a promoter-less pGL2-luciferase vector (Promega, Madison, WI). With regard to the human PGHS-2 promoter, a plasmid designated −1800pGL2, containing −1840 to +123 and thus located five base pairs upstream from the ATG of the human PGHS-2 promoter, was used. Promoter constructs were transiently transfected into fibroblasts using the LipofectAMINE PLUS system (Invitrogen). 0.75 μg of pGL2 promoter DNA and 0.1 μg of pRL-TK vector DNA (Promega), serving as a transfection efficiency control, were mixed with PLUS reagent for 15 min before being combined with LipofectAMINE PLUS for another 15 min. The DNA-lipid mixture was added to culture medium of 80% confluent cells for 3 h at 37 °C. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FBS replaced the transfection mixture overnight. Transfected cultures were then serum-starved, and some received either IL-1β (10 ng/ml) for 2 h or nothing (control) as indicated in the figure legends. Cellular material was harvested in buffer provided by the manufacturer (Promega) and stored at −80 °C until assayed. Luciferase activity was monitored with the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) in an FB12 tube luminometer (Zylux). Values were normalized to internal controls, and each experiment was performed at least three times. To interrupt the expression of potentially relevant signaling pathway components, DN constructs for p38 and ERK1 were ligated into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). These were transiently transfected into cells as described above. Control cultures received a constant amount (2 μg) of empty vector DNA. The diminished levels of the kinases were documented by Western blotting an aliquot of the lysate with relevant antibodies. Confluent orbital fibroblast monolayers were shifted to serumless medium without or with IL-1β (10 ng/ml) for up to 48 h. As the data in Fig. 1 Asuggest, the cytokine elicits a dramatic increase in PGE2levels, which are 90-fold above control levels at 6 h, remain near peak values for 24 h, and then begin to decline at 48 h. Western blot analysis of cellular proteins from fibroblasts treated under identical conditions reveal a large, time-dependent induction of mPGES and PGHS-2. Neither is expressed at detectable levels under basal conditions. With regard to PGHS-2, the protein is detectable at 6 h. At 12 h, PGHS-2 levels are near maximal, at least 100-fold above control values, and remain elevated at 24 h. At the final time point in the experiment (48 h), PGHS-2 protein levels are again undetectable. The induction of mPGES lags behind that of PGHS-2 in that its levels are modestly elevated at 6 and 12 h and do not reach an apparent maximum until 24 h. Unlike PGHS-2, mPGES protein levels remain close to their peak at 48 h. In contrast, levels of cPGES and PGHS-1 are not altered as a consequence of IL-1β treatment. The effects of IL-1β on PGE2 synthesis, the expression of PGHS-2 and mPGES are dose-dependent, as the data in Fig. 1 B suggest. A near maximal effect on PGHS-2 expression and PGE2 production is achieved at a concentration of 1 ng/ml. That concentration yields a suboptimal induction of mPGES. IL-1β at 10 ng/ml, the highest concentration of the cytokine used, results in a considerably higher level of mPGES. The induction of both mPGES and PGHS-2 by IL-1β was susceptible to blockade by the synthetic glucocorticoid, dexamethasone (10 nm, Fig. 2). That concentration of dexamethasone is associated with a high fractional occupancy of the nuclear glucocorticoid receptor and near maximal effects on human fibroblast metabolism (35.Smith T.J. Metabolism. 1988; 37: 179-184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The steroid had no effect on basal enzyme expression. The blockade of IL-1β-dependent enzyme expression was accompanied by a substantial inhibition of cytokine-provoked PGE2production. Northern blot analysis was employed to determine the relationship in orbital fibroblasts between the induction of PGHS-2 and of mPGES mRNAs. Confluent cultures were shifted to medium without FBS overnight, and then IL-1β (10 ng/ml) was added at various times prior to monolayer harvest. As the Northern blot shown in Fig. 3 A indicates, the tra"

Native dermaseptin S4 displayed high aggregation in solution and high binding affinity. These properties correlated with high cytotoxicity. Yet, potency was progressively limited when facing cells whose plasma membrane was surrounded by increasingly complex barriers. Increasing the positive charge of the native peptide led to partial depolymerization that correlated with higher binding affinity and with virtually non-discriminative high cytotoxicity against all cell types. The C-terminal hydrophobic domain was found responsible for binding to membranes but not for their disruption. Truncations of the C terminus combined with increased positive charge of the N-terminal domain resulted in short peptides having similar binding affinity as the parent compound but displaying selective activity against microbes with reduced toxicity toward human red blood cells. Nuclear magnetic resonance-derived three-dimensional structures of three active derivatives enabled the delineation of a common amphipathic structure with a clear separation of two lobes of positive and negative electrostatic potential surfaces. Whereas the spatial positive electrostatic potential extended considerably beyond the peptide dimensions and was required for potency, selectivity was affected primarily by hydrophobicity. The usefulness of this approach for the design of potent and/or selective cytolytic peptides is discussed herein.

After a half-century of virtually complete control over microbial infections, the 1990s have brought a worldwide resurgence of infectious diseases by evolution of antibiotic-resistant strains. So far, resistance has developed to nearly all antimicrobial drugs (1.Cohen M.L. Science. 1992; 257: 1050-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar, 2.Gold H.S. Moellering R.C. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 335: 1445-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Levels of resistance to antibacterial agents, for instance, are increasing at an alarming rate as antibiotics are progressively losing their effectiveness (3.Travis J. Science. 1994; 264: 360-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 4.Davies J. Nature. 1996; 383: 219-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Moreover, bacterial strains resistant to all available antibacterial agents have been identified among clinical isolates of different bacterial species, and the World Health Organization report on essential drugs has announced antimicrobial drug resistance as a main public health concern (5.World Health Organization (1995) WHO Tech. Rep. Ser.850Google Scholar). Animal-derived antimicrobial peptides have recently emerged as a potential class of novel antimicrobial agents that could either complement existing antibiotics or possibly even be used as an alternative (6.Levy O. Blood. 2000; 96: 2664-2672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Mor, A. (2001) The Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, Online edition: www3.interscience.wiley.com:8095/articles/peptwise.a01/frame.html, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New YorkGoogle Scholar). So far, more than 400 ribosomally made antimicrobial peptides have been isolated and characterized. After extensive studies of these peptides during the past 2 decades, it is presently becoming indisputably evident that these ubiquitous peptides represent an essential defense component in vertebrates and invertebrates (8.Nicolas P. Mor A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1995; 4: 277-304Crossref Scopus (529) Google Scholar, 9.Boman H.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 61-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (1494) Google Scholar, 10.Ganz T. Lehrer R.

The three-dimensional structures of many antimicrobial peptides present an amphipathic character, i.e. a hydrophobic face, consisting of non-polar amino acids, topologically separated from a hydrophilic face composed of polar and charged residues. In linear peptides, the amphipathic character can be induced by hydrophobic media (12.Mor A. Nguyen V.H. Delfour A. Migliore S.D. Nicolas P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8824-8830Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 13.Mor A. Amiche M. Nicolas P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6642-6650Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 14.Maloy L.W. Kari U.P. Biopolymers. 1995; 37: 105-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar), although conformationally constrained peptides present the amphipathic character in both hydrophilic and hydrophobic media (15.Hill C.P. Yee J. Selsted M.E. Eisenberg D. Science. 1991; 251: 1481-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 16.Aumelas A. Mangoni M. Roumestand C. Chiche L. Despaux E. Grassy B. Calas A. Chavanieu A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 575-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Antimicrobial peptides vary considerably in structure, size, amino acid sequence, and spectrum of action. Structure-activity relationship studies have shown that the most potent peptides are highly basic with a pronounced amphipathic character (14.Maloy L.W. Kari U.P. Biopolymers. 1995; 37: 105-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 17.Tossi A. Sandri L. Giangaspero A. Biopolymers. 2000; 55: 4-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar, 18.Chen J.

Biopolymers. 2000; 55: 74-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar).Antimicrobial peptides are often described as membrane-active agents although their detailed mechanism of action is not well understood. Nevertheless, several lines of evidence exist that enable us to stipulate a probable mechanism. Thus, isomers composed ofd-amino acids only display identical cytotoxic potency as the l-enantiomers, implying that their mechanism of action is not mediated by interaction with a stereospecific target such as protein receptors, enzymes, and so on (20.Wade D. Boman A. Wahlin B. Drain C.M. Andreu D. Boman H.G. Merrifield R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4761-4765Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar, 21.Feder R. Dagan A. Mor A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4230-4238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Rather, it seems that the peptide physicochemical properties (i.e. charge and hydrophobicity) are the main factors affecting antimicrobial activity. Indeed, despite a large heterogeneity in primary and secondary structures, all antimicrobial peptides carry a net positive charge; they can fold into well defined amphipathic structures, and they often display strong lipophilic properties and activity against a wide range of microorganisms (6.Levy O. Blood. 2000; 96: 2664-2672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Mor, A.

In addition, microbicidal activity exhibits strong concentration dependence. At lower concentrations, the peptides are virtually inactive until a critical concentration is reached (22.Oren Z. Shai Y. Biopolymers. 1998; 47: 451-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar,23.Shai Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1462: 55-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (1555) Google Scholar) suggesting that the active form of the peptide is an oligomer. Some of these peptides were stipulated to form ion channels or pores, as suggested by their ability to dissipate the electric potential across energy-transducing membranes and ion conductance across lipid bilayers (24.Sokolov Y.

For instance, a microbial membrane enclosed within a cell wall would be less accessible than the virtually “naked” membrane of protozoan cells. Correspondingly, potent antiprotozoan peptides were shown to display weak antibacterial activity (21.Feder R. Dagan A. Mor A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4230-4238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Furthermore, many antimicrobial peptides display a broad spectrum of activity (31.Mor A. Nicolas P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1934-1939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Martin E. Ganz T. Lehrer R.I. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1995; 58: 128-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 33.Soballe P.W. Maloy W.L. Myrga M.L. Jacob L.S. Herlyn M. Int. J. Cancer. 1995; 60: 280-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), yet many are quite inactive on normal eukaryotic cells. The basis for this discrimination is also unclear. It appears to be related to the lipid composition of the target membrane (i.e. fluidity, negative charge density, and absence/presence of cholesterol), and the possession, by the peptide-susceptible organism, of a large negative trans-membrane electrical potential (34.Andreu D. Rivas L. Biopolymers. 1998; 47: 415-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar).Thus, whereas the precise mechanism of action of antimicrobial peptides is yet to be better defined, the microbicidal effect is widely believed to result from their capacity to permeabilize the membrane of target cells. Such a mechanism of action endows the peptide-based antimicrobial system with attractive advantages over classical antibiotics because it makes it extremely difficult for microbes to develop resistance (18.Chen J. Falla T.J. Liu H. Hurst M.A. Fujii C.A. Mosca D.A. Embree J.R. Loury D.J. Radel P.A. Chang C.C. Gu L. Fiddes J.C. Biopolymers. 2000; 55: 88-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 35.Lamb H.M.

Agents Chemother. 2002; 46: 689-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). However, a major downside of such a mechanism is reflected in its unselective activity over a wide range of cell types, which could be problematic, for instance, in systemic routes of administration (37.Gura T. Science. 2001; 291: 2068-2071Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In some ironic way therefore, a major challenge of this field of research consists of figuring out how to endow specificity to a system that by definition is nonspecific.Toward better understanding the mechanism of action of peptide-antimicrobials, particularly with respect to better defining the factors affecting potency versus selectivity, we investigated in this study the relations between physicochemical properties of the peptides (composition, three-dimensional structure, and molecular organization in solution) and their interaction with target membranes as a function of the accessibility of the membrane. The 28-residue antimicrobial peptide dermaseptin S4 was selected for this investigation. Dermaseptin S4 belongs to a large family of linear polycationic peptides from frogs (12.Mor A. Nguyen V.H.

Nechushtai R. Mor A. Peptides (Elmsford). 2001; 22: 1683-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Among natural dermaseptins, S4 is unique in displaying high cytotoxicity toward erythrocytes as well (21.Feder R. Dagan A. Mor A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4230-4238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 39.Ghosh J.K. Shaool D. Guillaud P. Ciceron L. Mazier D. Kustanovich I. Shai Y. Mor A. J. Biol.

Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 2442-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Previous structure-activity relationship investigations suggested that peptide aggregation in solution, because of hydrophobic interactions at the peptide extremities, had dramatic consequences on cytotoxic properties including selectivity of the peptides (21.Feder R. Dagan A. Mor A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4230-4238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Thus, tampering with the composition of the peptide extremities led to disaggregation and selective activity in vitro and in animal models for infectious disease (36.Navon-Venezia S. Feder R. Gaidukov L. Carmeli Y. Mor A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2002; 46: 689-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 44.Feder R. Nechushtai R. Mor A. Peptides (Elmsford). 2001; 22: 1683-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Yet, the lack of three-dimensional structural data made it impossible to draw sound conclusions as to how the properties of the non-aggregated derivatives contributed to selectivity (21.Feder R. Dagan A. Mor A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4230-4238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Here, we investigated the three-dimensional structure of selected dermaseptin S4 derivatives. Because peptide structure might be medium-sensitive, as indicated by circular dichroism measurements (12.Mor A. Nguyen V.H. Delfour A. Migliore S.D. Nicolas P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8824-8830Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 13.Mor A. Amiche M. Nicolas P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6642-6650Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 31.Mor A. Nicolas P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1934-1939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the choice of medium for structural studies is critical. We chose to look at the peptide structure a fraction of time prior to the initial interaction (i.e. the electrostatic adhesion) that we believe to represent a most crucial moment in the mechanism of cytolytic action. To mimic such an interface milieu, structural studies were performed in an aqueous medium somewhat more hydrophobic than water, i.e.20% trifluoroethanol/water (45.Hirota N. Mizuno K. Goto Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 365-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 46.Sonnichsen F.D. Van Eyk J.E. Hodges R.S. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8790-8798Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). We also investigated here the effects of peptide alterations (length, charge, and hydrophobicity) on cytotoxic activity as a function of accessibility to the target membrane. The structure-dependent peptide properties were first investigated with respect to binding to model membranes and then correlated with their capacity to lyse erythrocytes and protozoa, for which accessibility is maximal, or fungi, Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, cells for which accessibility is hampered due to the presence of surrounding cell walls of increasing complexity (47.De Nobel J.G. Barnett J.A. Yeast. 1991; 7: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar).EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPeptidesThe peptides were synthesized by the solid phase method as described (21.Feder R. Dagan A. Mor A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4230-4238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) applying the Fmoc (9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl) active ester chemistry on a fully automated, programmable model 433A Peptide Synthesizer (Applied Biosystems). 4-Hydroxymethylphenoxymethyl-copolystyrene-1% divinylbenzene resin (Wang resin) and 4-methylbenzhydrylamine resin (Novabiochem) were used to obtain free carboxyl or amidated peptides, respectively. After purification by high pressure liquid chromatography (21.Feder R. Dagan A. Mor A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4230-4238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) the peptides were subjected to amino acid analysis and mass spectrometry in order to confirm their composition. Peptides were stocked as lyophilized powder at −20 °C. Prior to testing, fresh solutions were prepared in water, briefly vortexed, sonicated, and centrifuged and then diluted in the appropriate medium. Buffers were prepared using distilled water (Milli-Q, Millipore). All other reagents were of analytical grade.Aggregation in SolutionThe aggregation properties of the peptides in aqueous solution were investigated by static light scattering measurements on a PerkinElmer LS-5B Luminescence Spectrometer. Peptides at an initial concentration of 50 μm were successively diluted in 2 ml of PBS 1The abbreviations used are: PBSphosphate-buffered salinePCegg yolkl-α-phosphatidylcholinePAl-α-phosphatidic acidTFEtrifluoroethanolTOCSYtotal correlation spectroscopyNOEnuclear Overhauser enhancementNOESYtwo-dimensional NOE spectroscopyMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidr.m.s.d.root mean square deviationCMCcritical micelle concentrationMICminimal inhibitory concentration (10 mmsodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.3) at room temperature, and light scattering was evaluated by measuring the reflected light at an angle of 90°, holding both the excitation and the emission at 400 nm (5-nm slits).To describe the dependence of scattered signal on peptide concentration, the intensity of scattered light (mean from at least two independent experiments) was plotted against total peptide concentrations, and a linear regression analysis was performed on the data at the concentration range close to the monomer-micelle transition zone. The static light scattering signal is proportional to the number of aggregated molecules and the size of the aggregate. Therefore, the slope is indicative of the aggregation tendency and reveals the aggregation properties of the peptides, where a slope value above unity indicates the presence of micellar form. For aggregating peptides, the critical micelle concentration (CMC) was evaluated by extrapolating the curve to the intercept with the x axis (48.Tanford C. The Hydrophobic Effect: Formation of Micelles and Biological Membranes. 2nd Ed. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1980Google Scholar).Binding ExperimentsLiposome PreparationSmall unilamellar vesicles composed of phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidic acid (PC/PA, 1:1 molar ratio) were prepared in PBS by the extrusion method. Briefly, dry PC and PA were dissolved in EtOH or CHCl3, respectively, and mixed at equimolar ratios. The solvents were evaporated under a stream of nitrogen, and lipids were resuspended in PBS buffer at 0.5 mm total lipid concentration. The resultant suspension was vortexed, briefly sonicated, and passed 21 times through 100 nm polycarbonate membranes in an Avestin LiposoFast-Basic extrusion apparatus to give a translucent solution of vesicles with a mean diameter of 100 nm.Surface Plasmon Resonance AnalysisPeptide binding to phospholipid membranes was determined using the optical biosensor system (BIAcore 3000, Uppsala, Sweden) based on the principle of surface plasmon resonance (49.Jönsson U. Fägerstam L. Ivarsson B. Johnsson B. Karlsson R. Lundh K. Löfås S. Persson B. Roos H. Rönnberg I. Sjölander S. Stenberg E. Ståhlberg R. Urbaniczky C. Östlin H. Malmqvist M. BioTechniques. 1991; 11: 620-627PubMed Google Scholar). The sensor chip L1, a carboxymethyl dextran hydrogen derivatized with lipophilic alkyl chain anchors (BIAcore), was used to prepare a lipid bilayer as follows. After washing the chip with octyl glucoside (40 mm), the liposomes (0.5 mm) were injected over the chip surface at a flow rate of 2 μl/min at 25 °C to allow adsorption to the chip. Irregular and loosely bound structures such as multiple lipid layers and partially fused liposomes were washed away by a brief injection of NaOH (50 mm) at a high flow rate (100 μl/min). Bovine serum albumin was used to assess the degree of surface homogeneity. Under these conditions, about 5000 resonance units of lipid were immobilized which corresponds to a surface density equivalent to 4.6 ng/mm2 (50.Cooper A.M. Try A.C. Carroll J. Ellar D.J. Williams D.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1373: 101-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Surface regeneration between consecutive injections included the sequential injection of NaOH (50 mm) and HCl (50 mm). Association and dissociation rate constants were calculated by nonlinear fitting of the primary data using the BIAevaluation 3.0 software (BIAcore). The association and dissociation rate constants were derived assuming a simple bimolecular interaction model (51.O'Shannessy D.J. Brigham-Burke M. Soneson K.K. Hensley P. Brooks I. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 212: 457-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Their ratio (k a/k d) yields the association affinity constant K app.Cytotoxic AssaysHemolytic activity was assessed against human red blood cells. Human blood was rinsed 3 times in PBS by centrifugation for 1 min at 2700 × g and then resuspended in PBS at 5% hematocrit. A 50-μl suspension containing 2.5 × 108red blood cells was added to Eppendorf test tubes containing 200 μl of peptide solutions (serial 2-fold dilutions in PBS), PBS alone (for base-line values), or distilled water (for 100% hemolysis). After incubation (3 h under agitation, 37 °C) samples were centrifuged, and the hemolytic activity was assessed as a function of hemoglobin leakage by measuring the absorbance of 200 μl of supernatant (405 nm). Statistical data were obtained from at least two independent experiments performed in duplicate.Antiprotozoan activity was assessed against the promastigote form of aLeishmania major clinical isolate (graciously provided by Prof. Kobi Golenzer, the Parasitology Laboratory at Hadassah-Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel) cultured in RPMI 1640 complemented with 20% fetal calf serum, 1% penicillin, and 1% streptomycin. Inhibition of proliferation assay was performed by adding a 100-μl suspension of promastigotes (1 × 106 cells/ml) to 100 μl of culture medium (non-complemented RPMI) in 96-well plates (Nunc) containing zero or various peptide concentrations (serial 2-fold dilutions). After the incubation period (3 h, 27 °C) the number of viable (motile) cells was determined by counting an aliquot from each culture on a Neubauer cell counter under a microscope (Olympus IX70). Statistical data were obtained from at least two independent experiments performed in duplicate.Antifungal activity was assessed against a clinical isolate ofCryptococcus neoformans (strain B3501, graciously provided by Prof. Itzhac Polacheck, the Mycology Laboratory at Hadassah-Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel) cultured in RPMI supplemented with 150 mm MOPS. Inocula of 106 cells/ml were used. The cell populations were estimated by absorbance measurements at 620 nm referred to a calibration curve. 100-μl suspensions of the yeast cells were added to 100 μl of culture medium containing zero or various peptide concentrations (serial 2-fold dilutions) in 96-well plates (Nunc). Inhibition of proliferation was determined by absorbance measurements (620 nm) after incubation overnight at 30 °C. Statistical data were obtained from at least two independent experiments performed in duplicate.Antibacterial activity was assessed against clinical isolates (graciously provided by Dr. Yehuda Carmeli, Division of Infectious Diseases, Sourasky Medical Center, Tel Aviv, Israel) ofStaphylococcus aureus (strain B38302) and Escherichia coli (strain U16318) representatives for Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, respectively. Growth inhibition was assessed essentially as described for the antifungal assay except that the culture medium used was 2xty (16 g/liter tryptone, 10 g/liter yeast extract, 5 g/liter NaCl, pH 7.4), and incubations were performed at 37 °C.CD MeasurementsCD spectra in millidegrees were measured with an Aviv model 62A DS spectrometer (Aviv Associates, Lakewood, NJ) using a 0.020-cm rectangular QS Hellma cuvette at 25 °C (controlled by thermoelectric Peltier elements with an accuracy of 0.1 °C). The CD spectrum was scanned for peptide samples (280 μm, determined by UV using standard curves of known concentrations for each peptide) that were dissolved in 20% (v/v) trifluoroethanol/water. CD data represent average values from three separate recordings.NMR MeasurementsFor the NMR studies, a 1 mm solution of each S4 derivative (Table I) was prepared by dissolving lyophilized powder in an aqueous solution containing 20% (v/v) trifluoroethanol-d3 (Aldrich) at the apparent pH = 2.8–3.5.Table IBiological properties of dermaseptin S4 and six derivativesPeptide designationAmino acid sequence1 K app, PC/PA1-aAffinity constant for model membrane composed of phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidic acid, as determined using the BiaCore system.

To understand better the function of mammalian OPA1, we isolated a mouse ortholog (mOPA1) from brain and raised a specific antibody against its C terminus. The subcellular distribution of mOPA1 overexpressed in COS-7 cells largely overlapped that of endogenous cytochrome c, a well known mitochondrial marker, and dramatically affected mitochondrial morphology, altering it from tubular to vesicular. Mitochondrial targeting was mediated by the N-terminal region of mOPA1 as follows: deletion of the 124 N-terminal amino acids eliminated mitochondrial targeting, although fusion of the N-terminal 60 or 90 amino acids of mOPA1 with green fluorescent protein resulted in its mitochondrial targeting. mOPA1 was expressed widely in the mouse brain, especially in neurons of olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, piriform cortex, hypothalamus, hippocampus, red nucleus, cochlear nucleus, motor trigeminal nucleus, facial nucleus, cerebellar nucleus, and Purkinje cells.

Miyashita T. Kubo Y. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). This protein had a clear GTP-binding motif but showed only limited homology with the other members of this family known at that time (for example 25% amino acid identity with dynamin). The transcript was expressed in the brain and ovary, and in situ hybridization analysis of brain sections revealed the mRNA to be most intensely expressed in the large motor neurons of the brain stem. The specific function of this protein remains unknown, however. In the present work, we first isolated a mouse ortholog of the salmon cDNA clone in order to investigate the function of this large G protein in mammals. During the course of this study, it was reported that human OPA1 (hOPA1), which is highly homologous with our salmon clone (76.4%) and is described as the only known large G protein in vertebrates that has an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence, is mutated in patients with autosomal dominant optic atrophy (18Delettre C.

Pelloquin L. Grosgeorge J. Turc-Carel C. Perret E. Astarie- Dequeker C. Lasquellec L. Arnaud B. Ducommun B. Kaplan J. Hamel C.P. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (1169) Google Scholar) demonstrated that hemagglutinin-tagged hOPA1 localized to mitochondria in transfected HeLa cells, but the subcellular distribution of the untagged hOPA1 protein is not yet known due to the lack of a specific antibody. That mutation of hOPA1 caused optic atrophy suggests it has a biologically important role, presumably affecting mitochondrial function. However, as with the salmon clone, the functional significance of hOPA1 and its regulation by GTP binding have not yet been studied in detail. Here we describe our use of a specific antibody raised against a mouse OPA1 to analyze the subcellular distribution of OPA1, as well as the structural basis for that localization, its GTP-dependent regulation, and its macroscopic distribution within brain. We initially did a TBLASTN search of an EST data base using the amino acid sequence of the salmon large G protein clone (17Kubokawa K. Miyashita T. Kubo Y. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) as a probe and found several highly homologous mouse EST clones. We then used the registered sequence of one of the clones (GenBankTM accession number AA105109) to design a sense primer corresponding to amino acids 96–104 (salmon clone numbering) (5′-GCTGCAAGACTCTTAAAACTTCGATAT-3′) and an antisense primer corresponding to amino acids 152–159 (5′-GGAAGGGCTTTTCTAATTTTCTC-3′). By using this primer pair and PCR, we screened subdivided pools of a mouse brain cDNA plasmid library (Takara, Japan). One positive pool was then repeatedly subdivided until a single clone was obtained, after which the entire nucleotide sequence was determined using a BigDye Terminator Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems) and an automatic DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems type 377 and type 310). A Sculptor in vitro mutagenesis system (Amersham Biosciences) and QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) were used with mutated oligonucleotide DNA primers as instructed by the manufacturer to construct a group of mOPA1 point mutants: Met125 to Ala (M125A), Gln297 to Val (Q297V), Gln297 to Gly (Q297G), Gln297 to Leu (Q297L), Gln297 to Phe (Q297F), Gln297 to Trp (Q297W), Lys301 to Ala (K301A), and Thr302 to Asn (T302N). mOPA1 FLAG-tagged at the N terminus was constructed using PCR protocol that inserted DYKDDDDK between Met1 and Trp2. An N-terminal deletion mutant in which the N-terminal region upstream of Met125 was deleted (ΔN-mOPA1) was also constructed by PCR. mOPA1 Myc tagged at the C terminus (960Myc) was constructed using PCR that added EEQKLISEEDL after Lys960. A C terminus deletion mutant (355Myc), in which the C-terminal region downstream of Asp355 was deleted and Myc tag was added at the C terminus, was constructed by inserting theSalI-BglII fragment of mOPA1 cDNA into the Myc-tagged vector. Fusion proteins composed of N-terminal fragments of mOPA1 fused to enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) were constructed by inserting the appropriate PCR product into the EGFP-N1 vector (CLONTECH). DNA sequencing of the primer and surrounding regions confirmed all of the mutations. Wild type (WT) mOPA1 and its mutants were also subcloned into pCXN, a plasmid vector for efficient expression in mammalian cells (20Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (4617) Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA samples were isolated from BALB/c mice. After determining the concentrations of the samples by absorbance at 260 nm, a 2-μg aliquot of the poly(A)+ RNA was fractionated on a 0.7% agarose-formaldehyde gel and transferred to a nylon membrane. Thereafter, the entire mOPA1 cDNA was labeled with 32P through random priming and hybridization. Finally, the membranes were washed with 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 15 min, and exposed to an x-ray film for 1 day. The integrity of the loaded RNA was confirmed by staining the RNA gel with ethidium bromide and the nylon membrane with methylene blue. In same cases, a mouse Multiple Tissue Northern blot filter (CLONTECH) was simultaneously used for hybridization. COS-7, HEK 293, and HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 4 mm glutamine. For immunocytochemistry, cells were seeded onto poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips, where they were transiently transfected with the appropriate expression plasmids using the LipofectAMINE PLUS (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. In addition, primary cultures of rat cerebellar cells were prepared as described previously (21Hirano T. Kasono K. J. Neurophysiol. 1993; 70: 1316-1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). A peptide corresponding to amino acids 938–960 of mOPA1 (CDLKKVREIQEKLDAFIEALHQEK) was synthesized with an artificial Cys placed at the N-terminal end for conjugation with keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Three rabbits were then immunized by subcutaneous injection with the keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated peptide every 4 weeks. A specific antibody against mOPA1 was purified from the collected antiserum as follows. Epoxy-activated Sepharose 6B (Amersham Biosciences) was coupled for 16 h at 37 °C with synthetic peptide in 0.2 msodium carbonate buffer (pH 9.5). The Sepharose was then blocked with 1m ethanolamine (pH 8.0) for 4 h at 50 °C and washed with 10 column volumes of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 150 mm NaCl (TBS). Antiserum was then loaded onto the column and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C, after which the column was washed with 10 volumes of TBS. The antibody was then eluted with 0.1 m glycine hydrochloride (pH 2.5) and immediately neutralized with Tris base. The specificities of the antiserum and the affinity-purified antibody were confirmed by comparing Western blot and immunocytochemical data obtained from mOPA1-transfected and untransfected HEK 293 cells. Mitochondria were labeled with mouse anti-cytochrome c mAb (clone 6H2.B4, BD PharMingen); neurons with mouse anti-MAP-2 mAb (clone AP20, Roche Molecular Biochemicals); astrocytes and Bergman glial cells with mouse anti-GFAP mAb (clone G-A-5, Roche Molecular Biochemicals); FLAG tag with mouse anti-FLAG mAb (M2, Sigma); and Myc tag with rabbit anti-c-Myc antibody (A-14, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Alexa-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes), Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch), biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG (Vector Laboratories), and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Biosciences) served as secondary antibodies. Brains from adult BALB/c mice were homogenized in a glass-Teflon Potter homogenizer in ice-cold PBS supplemented with a mixture of proteinase inhibitors (Complete, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and then centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove unbroken tissues. The supernatant was mixed with Laemmli SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiled for 10 min. Alternatively, HEK 293 cells transfected with mOPA1 were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and incubated in 10% trichloroacetic acid for 15 min on ice, after which they were collected by centrifugation, suspended in Laemmli SDS-PAGE sample buffer, neutralized with Tris base, and boiled for 10 min. In either case, protein samples were resolved on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electrotransfered to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). The membranes were then blocked for 30 min at room temperature with blocking solution (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20 and 5% skim milk) and probed for 1 h at 37 °C with affinity-purified anti-mOPA1 antibody diluted in blocking solution. After washing, membranes were treated first with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and then with ECL Plus reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Cells plated on coverslips were transfected with wild type mOPA1 or its mutants. After incubation (ordinarily 24 h), they were fixed for 15 min at room temperature in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS and then washed with PBS and blocked for 1 h 37 °C in PBS containing 2% skim milk and 0.1% Triton X-100. The coverslips were then incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with the appropriate primary antibodies in PBS + 2% skim milk, washed three times with PBS, and incubated with fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibodies in PBS + 2% skim milk. After again washing the coverslips three times with PBS, they were incubated for 5 min with PBS containing 0.5 μg/ml DAPI and washed again with PBS. Finally, the coverslips were mounted on microscope slide glass using PermaFluor mounting medium (Shandon). Fluorescent images were acquired using a Zeiss AxioCam camera, and pseudocolors were added to the digitized images. For DAB staining, a biotinylated secondary antibody was used as described below. Adult BALB/c mice were deeply anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital and then transcardinally perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The brains were then removed from the skulls, cryoprotected with 15% (w/w) sucrose in 0.1 msodium phosphate buffer at 4 °C overnight, and cut into frontal and sagittal sections (50 μm) on a freezing microtome. Before hybridization, the sections were pretreated with 10 μg/ml proteinase K for 30 min at 37 °C. Digoxigenin-labeled antisense and sense strand RNA probes were prepared from the entire mOPA1 cDNA using RNA polymerases and a digoxigenin labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The transcribed RNA probes were treated with NaOH, yielding 400-bp lengths on average. Hybridization was carried out for 16 h at 50 °C in a solution of 50% formamide, 1× Denhardt’s solution, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 300 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm EDTA, 0.01% Tween 20, and 500 μg/ml tRNA. After hybridization, the sections were washed several times under low and then high stringent conditions (0.1× SSC and 50% formamide at 50 °C for 60 min), after which they were incubated first with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-digoxigenin antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and then with 4-nitro blue tetrazolium chloride substrate solution. A sense strand probe was used as a negative control. Sections from adult mice were prepared as described above. Free-floating sections were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in PBS + 1% skim milk and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-mOPA1 antiserum in the blocking solution. The sections were then rinsed with PBS and incubated with biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG (Vector Laboratories), rinsed again, and reacted with avidin-biotin peroxidase complex (Elite ABC kit, Vector Laboratories). Finally, the sections were reacted with 0.02% DAB and 0.002% hydrogen peroxide in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer. To isolate a mouse ortholog of the large G protein previously cloned from salmon brain (17Kubokawa K. Miyashita T. Kubo Y. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), we carried out a TBLASTN search of a mouse EST data base using the amino acid sequence of the salmon clone as a probe. We then prepared a set of PCR primers based on the registered sequence of one of the clones obtained, screened a mouse brain cDNA library, and through repeated subdivision of a positive pool, eventually identified a single cDNA clone. It was ∼6 kbp in length and encoded 960 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence (Fig. 1A) showed ∼76% identity with the salmon clone (17Kubokawa K. Miyashita T. Kubo Y. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) and 96% identity with the recently isolated hOPA1 (18Delettre C. Lenaers G. Griffoin J.M. Gigarel N. Lorenzo C. Belenguer P. Pelloquin L. Grosgeorge J. Turc-Carel C. Perret E. Astarie- Dequeker C. Lasquellec L. Arnaud B. Ducommun B. Kaplan J. Hamel C.P. Nat.

Bhattacharya S.S. Wissinger B. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar). We therefore designated the isolated mouse clone mOPA1. Like hOPA1 and the salmon clone, the N-terminal region of mOPA1 contained an obvious GTP-binding motif (Fig. 1A,boxes), a putative mitochondrial targeting signal with scattered positively charged amino acid residues (14Pfanner N. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: R412-R415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), and three mitochondrial endopeptidase cleavage motifs (RX(F/L/I)XX(G/S/T)XXXX) (22Branda S.S. Isaya G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27366-27373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) (Fig.1B). There were also two predicted coiled-coil structure motifs (Fig. 1A, amino acids 208–251 and 922–951) (23Berger B. Wilson D.B. Wolf E. Tonchev T. Milla M. Kim P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8259-8263Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Although hOPA1 was found to be expressed in almost every tissue investigated (18Delettre C. Lenaers G. Griffoin J.M. Gigarel N. Lorenzo C. Belenguer P. Pelloquin L. Grosgeorge J. Turc-Carel C. Perret E. Astarie- Dequeker C. Lasquellec L. Arnaud B. Ducommun B. Kaplan J. Hamel C.P. Nat.

Bhattacharya S.S. Wissinger B. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar), the salmon clone was most abundantly expressed in brain and ovary (17Kubokawa K. Miyashita T. Kubo Y. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). When we analyzed tissue-specific expression of mOPA1 using Northern hybridization (Fig. 2), we observed that an mRNA of ∼6 kb, comparable in size to the isolated cDNA, was expressed in the forebrain, cerebellum, and brain stem, as well as in the heart. A faint 6-kb band was also detected in liver, kidney, ovary, and skeletal muscle; however, a stronger band was detected at ∼3.5 kb. Although the identity of the lower molecular weight product is presently unknown, it was also clearly detectable on a commercially available RNA blot sheet (CLONTECH; data not shown), and its presence was also reported in conjunction with hOPA1 (18Delettre C. Lenaers G. Griffoin J.M. Gigarel N. Lorenzo C. Belenguer P. Pelloquin L. Grosgeorge J. Turc-Carel C. Perret E. Astarie- Dequeker C. Lasquellec L. Arnaud B. Ducommun B. Kaplan J. Hamel C.P. Nat.

Bhattacharya S.S. Wissinger B. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar). As the mOPA1 amino acid sequence contains three cleavage motifs (Fig. 1B), we used Western blot analyses to examine the extent to which this protein is processed in cells. When mouse brain was probed using a specific anti-mOPA1 antibody, a major band at ∼90 kDa and double bands at 80 kDa were detected (Fig.3, lane 1). In the HEK 293 cells transfected with WT mOPA1, bands were detected at 100 and 90 kDa, and a major band appeared at 80 kDa (Fig. 3, lane 2). No protein was detected in HEK 293 cells transfected with empty vector, confirming the specificity of the antibody (Fig. 3, lane 6). To exclude the possibility that the presence of various sized mOPA1 proteins reflects multiple translation initiation sites, we constructed a deletion mutant in which the N-terminal region upstream of the 2nd Met (Met125) was deleted (ΔN-mOPA1). In that case, only a single major band was detected (Fig. 3, lane 4). In addition, analysis of an M125A point mutant yielded three bands like those obtained with the wild type protein (Fig. 3, lane 5). It thus appears that all three bands obtained with WT mOPA1 isolated from HEK cells were derived from a single protein translated from the 1st Met (Met1) and that the lower molecular weight bands resulted from processing at the N-terminal end of that protein. We also evaluated a mOPA1 construct having a FLAG tag attached at its N terminus. This construct yielded only one band at 100 kDa plus FLAG and was detectable using antibodies against either the C-terminal end of mOPA1 (Fig. 3, lane 3) or FLAG (data not shown), which confirms that the 100-kDa protein is the unprocessed form of mOPA1 and indicates that the presence of a FLAG tag at the N-terminal end inhibits processing of the protein. Immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 4A) and DAB staining (Fig. 4, B and B′) revealed mOPA1 to be distributed in a pattern of small vesicles throughout the cytoplasm of transfected COS-7 cells. The same vesicular pattern was observed in mOPA1-transfected HeLa and HEK 293 cells (data not shown). In addition, some staining presumed a ring-like pattern (arrows in Fig.4B′), suggesting mOPA1 might be situated on the membrane of an organelle in the transfected cells. No signal was observed in mock-transfected (Fig. 4C′) or untransfected (data not shown) COS-7 cells, indicating they do not endogenously express mOPA1 or any related protein. Because the vesicular distribution of mOPA1 differed markedly from the standard tubular shape of mitochondria, we tested whether mOPA1 might be localized in organelles other than mitochondria. When cells were double-labeled with antibodies against mOPA1 and a marker for lysosomes (anti-Lamp1), early endosomes (anti-EEA1), trans-Golgi-networks (anti-TGN38), microtubules (anti-α-tubulin), endocytotic pathways (fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran), or actin filaments (fluorescein isothiocyanate-phalloidin), no overlap between the distribution of mOPA1 and that of any of the organelle markers tested was detected (data not shown). We then double-labeled COS-7 cells with antibodies against mOPA1 and cytochrome c, a reliable mitochondrial marker (24Gonzales D.H. Neupert W. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1990; 22: 753-768PubMed Google Scholar). In mock-transfected cells, the mitochondrial morphology revealed by anti-cytochrome c was tubular, which is typical (Fig.4C). In mOPA1-transfected cells, the distribution of mOPA1 overlapped that of cytochrome c to a substantial degree, indicating labeling of mitochondria; however, the morphology was vesicular (Fig. 4, D–D""), perhaps indicating that overexpression of mOPA1 causes mitochondria to fragment into small pieces. We also analyzed the subcellular localization of mOPA1 protein in COS-7 cells at the earliest stage after transfection when the amount of mOPA1 protein had not reached too high a level. By chronological analysis, the expression started to be detected from 9 h after transfection, when mOPA1 protein had already localized at mitochondria in a small vesicular pattern (data not shown). This result suggests that mOPA1 shows a vesicular localization pattern in mitochondria even before accumulating excessively in the transfected cells. Therefore, it is thought that this morphological change of mitochondria is not a simple artifact due to overexpression of mOPA1. It remains unclear, however, what the role of mOPA1 is at a physiological expression level. The functional significance of the putative mitochondrial targeting signal at the N terminus of hOPA1 has not been demonstrated experimentally. To clarify this point with respect to mOPA1, we first examined the subcellular distribution of ΔN-mOPA1, which started at Met125 and thus lacked the mitochondrial targeting signal. As expected, the intracellular distribution of the truncated protein was diffuse, although some aggregates were seen (Fig.5A). The morphology of mitochondria revealed by anti-cytochrome c showed the standard tubular shape (Fig. 5A′), and the distributions of the two proteins did not overlap (Fig. 5A""). We next created a group of fusion proteins composed of 30-, 60-, or 90-amino acid fragments from the N terminus of mOPA1 fused with EGFP at its N-terminal end and examined their subcellular distributions. Comparison of the distributions of cytochrome c(red) and the EGFP fusion proteins (green) revealed that the 60- and 90-amino acid fragments were sufficient for mitochondrial targeting, but the 30-amino acid fragment was not (Fig.5, C–E). The mitochondria retained their standard tubular morphology in these experiments, indicating that the N-terminal sequence of mOPA1 is necessary and sufficient for mitochondrial targeting but that expression in mitochondria, itself, is not sufficient to alter mitochondrial morphology. Although mOPA1, hOPA1, and the salmon clone all contain an obvious GTP-binding motif, little is known about the regulation of their function by GTP. To gain some idea, we transfected COS-7 and HeLa cells with either WT mOPA1 or one of the constructs containing a point mutation (Q297V, K301A, or T302N) in the GTP-binding motif and then monitored the morphology of the mitochondria in the transfectants (Fig. 6, A–F). Gln297 of mOPA1 corresponds to the residue at which Gly to Val mutation was shown to make Rho protein constitutively active by depriving GTP hydrolyzing activity (25Murphy C. Saffrich R. Grummt M.

https://openalex.org/W2054228700,"PRELP (proline arginine-rich end leucine-rich repeat protein) is a heparin-binding leucine-rich repeat protein in connective tissue extracellular matrix. In search of natural ligands and biological functions of this molecule, we found that PRELP binds the basement membrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan perlecan. Also, recombinant perlecan domains I and V carrying heparan sulfate bound PRELP, whereas other domains without glycosaminoglycan substitution did not. Heparin, but not chondroitin sulfate, inhibited the interactions. Glycosaminoglycan-free recombinant perlecan domain V and mutated domain I did not bind PRELP. The dissociation constants of the PRELP-perlecan interactions were in the range of 3–18 nm as determined by surface plasmon resonance. As expected, truncated PRELP, without the heparin-binding domain, did not bind perlecan. Confocal immunohistochemistry showed that PRELP outlines basement membranes with a location adjacent to perlecan. We also found that PRELP binds collagen type I and type II through its leucine-rich repeat domain. Electron microscopy visualized a complex with PRELP binding simultaneously to the triple helical region of procollagen I and the heparan sulfate chains of perlecan. Based on the location of PRELP and its interaction with perlecan heparan sulfate chains and collagen, we propose a function of PRELP as a molecule anchoring basement membranes to the underlying connective tissue.

Connective tissue is ubiquitous in the body of vertebrates. The relative proportion of connective tissue varies between organ systems, constituting the entire structure in cartilage or contributing a minor element in muscle tissue. The common denominator is a predominant extracellular matrix. This is composed of collagens, non-collagenous glycoproteins, and proteoglycans, the latter of which are proteins carrying glycosaminoglycan (GAG) 1The abbreviations used are: GAGglycosaminoglycanCSchondroitin sulfateHSheparan sulfateLRRleucine-rich repeatEHSEngelbreth-Holm-Swarm1The abbreviations used are: GAGglycosaminoglycanCSchondroitin sulfateHSheparan sulfateLRRleucine-rich repeatEHSEngelbreth-Holm-Swarm substituents. Among the constituents, leucine-rich repeat (LRR) proteins constitute a family of small proteoglycans and proteins. They contain a central, main portion of 10–11 LRRs flanked by disulfide-linked loops on both sides. Several of the LRR proteins have been shown to bind to collagen through this domain. In contrast to the fairly uniform LRR regions, the amino-terminal domains are quite variable. Most of these proteins have an amino-terminal region with acidic properties. In decorin and biglycan, there are one and two chondroitin/dermatan sulfate chains, respectively. In fibromodulin, osteoadherin, lumican, and keratocan, sulfated tyrosine residues contribute the anionic properties (Ref. 1.Heinegård D. Lorenzo P. Saxne T. Seibel M.J. Robins S.P. Bilezikian J.P. Dynamics of Bone and Cartilage Metabolism. Academic Press, San Diego1999: 59-69Google Scholarand the references therein). In asporin, an extended stretch of aspartic acid residues provides a cluster of negative charge (2.Lorenzo P. Aspberg A. Önnerfjord P. Bayliss M.T. Neame P.J. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12201-12211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). PRELP is the only member of this family with a basic amino-terminal region that is rich in proline and has clusters of arginine residues (3.Bengtsson E. Neame P.J. Heinegård D. Sommarin Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25639-25644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). This domain has been shown to bind heparin and heparan sulfate (HS) (4.Bengtsson E. Aspberg A. Heinegård D. Sommarin Y. Spillmann D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40695-40702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). HS chains are very variable in fine structure. They are components of a set of proteoglycans, where syndecans and glypicans occur at the cell surface, and perlecan is found in the extracellular matrix. It is not clear whether PRELP will bind HS chains on all these proteoglycans. LRRs are believed to facilitate protein-protein interactions (5.Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 415-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar), but no ligands for this part of the PRELP molecule are known. However, in view of the described interactions of several other proteins within the family, collagen is a likely candidate (reviewed in Ref. 1.Heinegård D. Lorenzo P. Saxne T. Seibel M.J. Robins S.P. Bilezikian J.P. Dynamics of Bone and Cartilage Metabolism.

It is predominantly found in the territorial matrix (6.Heinegård D. Larsson T. Sommarin Y. Franzén A. Paulsson M. Hedbom E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13866-13872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, radioimmunoassays demonstrated its presence also in kidney, aorta, sclera, liver, skeletal muscle, cornea, skin, and tendon (6.Heinegård D. Larsson T. Sommarin Y. Franzén A. Paulsson M. Hedbom E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13866-13872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Preliminary experiments indicate that PRELP is present in or close to several basement membranes. This structure is found as a thin sheet of extracellular matrix separating epithelial cells from the underlying connective tissue. It functions as a barrier for molecules and cells (Ref. 7.Timpl R.

Structurally, basement membranes are built up by networks of collagen type IV and laminin, respectively, connected to one another via nidogen (reviewed in Ref.8.Timpl R. Brown J.C. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). There are a number of other proteins that contribute to the complex structure of basement membranes. One of the most abundant is the proteoglycan perlecan. This molecule consists of five domains with three GAG chains attached to domain I. In some cases, additional chains are found at domain V (9.Brown J.C. Sasaki T. Göhring W. Yamada Y. Timpl R. Eur. J.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 435: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The discovery of PRELP close to basement membranes prompted us to search for potential interaction partners. We show here that PRELP binds to the HS chains of perlecan and also, to some extent, to other basement membrane proteins. In addition, PRELP is shown to interact with triple helical collagens type I and II. By binding to perlecan HS chains in the basement membrane via its amino-terminal part and to collagen in the connective tissue via its LRR domain, PRELP is a likely candidate as one of the anchoring molecules at basement membrane-connective tissue junctions. Perlecan and complexes of laminin-nidogen were purified from mouse Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm tumor (22.Paulsson M. Aumailley M. Deutzmann R. Timpl R. Beck K. Engel J. Eur. J.

Biochem. 1997; 250: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), was produced in 293-EBNA or 293 cells. Bovine PRELP was extracted from nasal cartilage under dissociative conditions (6.Heinegård D. Larsson T. Sommarin Y. Franzén A. Paulsson M. Hedbom E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13866-13872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant human PRELP, both the full-length form and the truncated form without its amino-terminal basic region, was expressed in 293-EBNA cells (4.Bengtsson E. Aspberg A. Heinegård D. Sommarin Y. Spillmann D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40695-40702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Bovine tracheal CS A (containing ∼70% 4-O-sulfate and ∼30% 6-O-sulfate, according to the manufacturer) and heparin were from Sigma and Hoffmann-La Roche, respectively. Pepsin-solubilized bovine dermal collagen type I (Vitrogen 100) was from Collagen Biomaterials (Palo Alto, CA). Collagen type II was purified from pepsin-digested bovine articular cartilage as described previously (33.Vogel K.G. Paulsson M. Heinegård D. Biochem. J. 1984; 223: 587-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). Procollagen I was isolated from calf tendon fibroblasts as described previously (34.Kadler K.E. Hojima Y. Prockop D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15696-15701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and was a kind gift from Dr. Charlotte Wiberg (Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden). Bovine PRELP was coated at 5 μg/ml in 50 mm sodium carbonate buffer, pH 9.2, overnight at 4 °C in a 96-well plate (PS-microplate F-form; Greiner). Further binding was blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in TBS (0.15 m NaCl and 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4). Basement membrane components at different concentrations (laminin-nidogen complex, fibronectin, nidogen, fibulins, BM-40, perlecan, and perlecan fragments) in 1% bovine serum albumin in TBS were added for 3 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. In the competition assays, heparin or CS was added to the PRELP-coated dishes for 3 h before the addition of perlecan or perlecan fragments. In assays with fibulins and BM-40, TBS buffer containing 2 mm CaCl2 was used. Washes were performed with T-TBS (TBS with 0.05% Tween 20) with or without CaCl2. Antibodies for the particular basement membrane component were added in TBS. Bound antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG using 5-aminosalicylic acid in 20 mm phosphate, pH 6.8, 0.01% H2O2as substrate. The reaction was terminated with 1 m NaOH, and the absorbance was measured at 490 nm. As a control, basement membrane proteins at the highest concentration studied were added to wells coated with bovine serum albumin only and detected as described above. The resulting low background absorbance values were subtracted from the experimental data values. All measurements were performed with a BIAcore2000 System (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). To allow studies of perlecan binding, PRELP dissolved in 5 mmmaleic acid, pH 5.6, was immobilized onto a carboxymethylated gold surface (Pioneer Chip C1) via amino coupling according to the manufacturer's instructions (BIA Applications Handbook, BIAcore AB). PRELP extracted from cartilage was immobilized to ∼1100 resonance units, whereas the recombinant full-length or truncated molecule was bound to ∼400 resonance units. To serve as a blank, a flow cell was subjected to the same coupling procedure, omitting protein. Perlecan (1–34 nm) and its fragments (4–136 nm), as well as nidogen (18–560 nm), fibulin-2 (9–290 nm), and BM-40 (9–290 nm), were injected at a flow rate of 20 μl/min in HBS (10 mm Hepes, 0.15 m NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, and 0.005% Surfactant P20) (BIAcore AB). After each injection, the surfaces were regenerated with HBS buffer containing 1.15 m NaCl, with the exception of nidogen, for which HBS buffer containing 2.15 m NaCl was used. Affinity analyses of the association and dissociation curves were performed with BIAevaluation 3.0 software. The dissociation constants were calculated using the 1:1 binding model correcting for drifting baseline. In studies of PRELP-collagen binding, PRELP was immobilized as described above, but onto a carboxymethylated dextran matrix (Sensor Chip CM5). The immobilization levels were 7000 resonance units for PRELP extracted from cartilage and 3300 resonance units for both recombinant full-length and truncated PRELP. The blank was prepared as described above. Collagen type I (12.5–400 nm) and type II (18.75–300 nm) were injected at a flow rate of 20 μl/min in TBS with Surfactant P20 (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.15m NaCl, and 0.005% Surfactant P20). The surfaces were regenerated with running buffer containing 1 m NaCl. Frozen sections of human skin and bovine testis and kidney were fixed in acetone for 10 min at 4 °C, preincubated with normal donkey serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.), and then simultaneously incubated with affinity-purified anti-bovine PRELP and rat monoclonal anti-perlecan domain IV (MAB 1948; Chemicon International Inc.), followed by secondary antibodies preadsorbed against immunoglobulins from species other than the primary target antibody to eliminate any cross-reactivity (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.). The Texas Red dye-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rat IgG were visualized with a Bio-Rad 1024 confocal laser scanning microscope. The gray scale images obtained were pseudocolored using Adobe Photoshop 5.0 without any other modifications, and the final figure was assembled using Macromedia FreeHand 8.0. Control experiments included secondary antibodies alone, as well as inhibition of anti-PRELP antibody binding with some 10 μg/ml bovine protein. Glycerol spraying/rotary shadowing, negative staining, and evaluation of the data from electron micrographs were carried out as described previously (35.Engel J. Furthmayr H. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 145: 3-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). For negative staining, 5-μl samples of different complexes between procollagen, PRELP, and perlecan (typical concentrations of about 5 μg/ml in TBS) were adsorbed onto 400 mesh carbon-coated copper grids, washed briefly with water, and stained on two drops of freshly prepared 0.75% uranyl formate. The grids were rendered hydrophilic by glow discharge at low pressure in air. In some experiments, the PRELP was labeled with 5 nm colloidal gold (36.Baschong W. Lucocq J.M. Roth J. Histochemistry. 1985; 83: 409-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). For rotary shadowing, 30 μl of perlecan or PRELP/perlecan samples (typical concentrations of about 20 μg/ml) were dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 0.2 m ammonium hydrogen carbonate, pH 7.9. They were mixed with equal volumes of 80% glycerol and sprayed onto freshly cleaved mica discs with a nebulizer designed for small volumes. They were dried in a high vacuum for 2 h and shadowed under rotation with 2 nm platinum/carbon at a 9° angle, followed by coating with a stabilizing 10 nm carbon film. Specimens were observed in a Jeol 1200 EX transmission electron microscope operated at 60 kV accelerating voltage. Images were recorded on Kodak SO-163 plates without preirradiation at a dose of typically 2000 electrons/nm2. The negatives were scanned, cropped, and assembled into the final figure using Adobe Photoshop 6.0. Because preliminary results indicated that PRELP was located in or close to several basement membranes, e.g. in skin, testes, and Bowman's capsule of the kidney, we tested various basement membrane proteins for binding to the protein. In a microtiter solid phase assay, perlecan clearly bound bovine PRELP (Fig. 1). Other basement membrane proteins such as nidogen, fibulin-2, and BM-40 also interacted with PRELP, but with lower affinities compared with perlecan. Fibronectin and fibulin-1C showed little or no binding (Fig. 1). To determine the binding constants, bovine PRELP was immobilized to carboxyl groups on a BIAcore sensor chip, and the binding was analyzed by surface plasmon resonance (Table I). As expected from the microtiter assay, PRELP interaction with perlecan was the strongest, with a steady-state dissociation constant (K D) of ∼3 nm. Binding of the other basement membrane components nidogen-1, fibulin-2, and BM-40 to PRELP showed K D values of ∼60–180 nm.Table ISteady-state dissociation constants (KD) for PRELP interactions with various basement membrane componentsSoluble ligandk assk dissK Dm−1s−1s−1nmPerlecan283,0000.000913Nidogen-17,4900.00134180Fibulin-218,9000.00191100BM-4030,4000.0018260PRELP, extracted from bovine nasal cartilage, was immobilized to a gold surface and analyzed for binding to perlecan extracted from EHS tumor, recombinant nidogen, fibulin-2, and BM-40 in a BIAcore 2000 surface plasmon resonance system. Open table in a new tab PRELP, extracted from bovine nasal cartilage, was immobilized to a gold surface and analyzed for binding to perlecan extracted from EHS tumor, recombinant nidogen, fibulin-2, and BM-40 in a BIAcore 2000 surface plasmon resonance system. The domains of perlecan that bind PRELP were identified using recombinant fragments of perlecan (Fig. 2). Together, these cover the full length of the molecule, and all were examined, except for domain IV-1. GAG-substituted perlecan domain I and domain V both bound PRELP in solid phase assay (Fig. 3), whereas fragments containing other perlecan domains (II, III-1, III-2, III-3, and IV-2; data not shown) did not bind PRELP. To elucidate whether the interaction was mediated via the core protein or the GAG side chains, perlecan domain I with and without GAGs was tested. Perlecan domain I with HS chains interacted with PRELP to a much higher extent than a preparation of the same domain substituted with both HS and CS chains. A mutated form of perlecan domain I containing no GAG chains did not bind PRELP (Fig. 3 B). Similarly, perlecan domain V with GAGs present bound to PRELP, whereas perlecan domain V lacking GAGs did not bind to PRELP (Fig. 3 C).Figure 3Interaction of PRELP and perlecan or perlecan fragments analyzed by solid phase assay. PRELP was coated to microtiter plate wells and incubated with (A) perlecan extracted from EHS tumor; (B) recombinant perlecan domain IA with HS (●), domain IB with HS and CS (○), mutated domain I without GAG chains (x); and (C) recombinant perlecan domain V with GAG chains (Vc, ●) or without GAG chains (V, ○). Bound proteins were detected with specific antibodies. Data are the means of triplicates ± S.D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The interactions of the different fragments were also analyzed by surface plasmon resonance, confirming the result of the solid phase assay. Perlecan fragments IA, IB, and Vc with GAG chains all bound to bovine PRELP, whereas mutated perlecan domain I and perlecan domain V without GAGs did not interact with PRELP. The dissociation constants of PRELP-perlecan IA (18 nm) and PRELP-Vc (4 nm) were similar to the K D calculated for the interaction between PRELP and full-length perlecan (3 nm). Attempts to calculate the dissociation constant for the interaction of PRELP with perlecan domain I with both HS and CS chains did not result in an acceptable curve fit, but binding was observed. To further show that PRELP interacts with HS chains of perlecan domain I and V, we performed competition experiments with isolated heparin and CS chains. Indeed, low concentrations of heparin (0.1–0.01 μg/ml) efficiently inhibited the interactions, whereas addition of CS only resulted in a small reduction in binding, even at a high concentration (100 μg/ml) (Fig. 4). Also, the PRELP binding of perlecan domain I carrying a mix of HS and CS chains was inhibited by heparin, whereas the addition of CS had a very limited effect (1000–10,000-fold difference). Because fraction IB contains both HS and CS, binding probably reflects PRELP interaction with HS or possibly reflects PRELP interaction with a highly sulfated form of CS. The amino-terminal part of PRELP is known to interact with heparin (4.Bengtsson E. Aspberg A. Heinegård D. Sommarin Y. Spillmann D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40695-40702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In view of the shared structures between heparin and heparan sulfate, it is reasonable to assume that PRELP can bind to perlecan via its amino-terminal domain. To confirm this, full-length PRELP and truncated human PRELP (lacking the amino-terminal domain) were immobilized to a carboxymethylated chip, and interactions with perlecan were determined by surface plasmon resonance. As expected, full-length PRELP bound perlecan domain V substituted with GAG chains and perlecan domain I with HS chains, whereas truncated PRELP did not do so (Fig. 5). Confocal immunohistochemistry was used to determine the localization of PRELP at the basement membrane. Human skin and bovine testis and kidney were double-stained with antibodies to PRELP and perlecan domain IV, respectively. Bound antibodies were detected with Texas Red- or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies. In kidney, PRELP was present mainly around Bowman's capsule, whereas the perlecan antibody stained Bowman's capsule as well as glomeruli and tubuli. However, the PRELP staining in Bowman's capsule did not overlap with but was adjacent to the perlecan staining (Fig. 6 A). In testis, perlecan was detected in the basement membranes surrounding the seminiferous tubules and blood vessels. PRELP was localized adjacent to the basement membrane in the seminiferous tubules of testis (Fig. 6 B), which was evident at a higher magnification (Fig. 6 C). A similar pattern was seen in human skin, where PRELP was detected as a gradient in the dermal tissue, with the most intense staining just underneath the basement membrane (Fig. 6 D). The faint staining of the epidermis in skin with PRELP antibodies was also seen in control sections incubated with only the secondary antibodies (data not shown). The specificity of the anti-PRELP antibodies was confirmed by inhibition with added PRELP protein (data not shown). PRELP is closely related to fibromodulin and several other LRR proteins known to bind to collagen (37.Hedbom E. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27307-27312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that PRELP also interacts with collagen. Indeed, surface plasmon resonance assays showed that PRELP binds to collagen. PRELP extracted from bovine cartilage and recombinant human full-length PRELP and truncated PRELP (i.e. without the HS binding amino-terminal) were all immobilized to carboxyl groups on the BIAcore surface chip. Interaction was studied by injection of collagen type I or II over the surface (Fig. 7). All three forms of PRELP, including truncated PRELP, were shown to interact with both types of collagen. It is apparent that binding is mediated by the central domain, probably the LRR region, rather than through the amino-terminal part. In addition, the binding curves of collagen to full-length and truncated PRELP, respectively, had a similar appearance, suggesting that the interactions have similar affinities. Because both full-length PRELP and truncated PRELP bind to collagen, it was also confirmed that recombinant truncated PRELP is active and thus apparently correctly folded. Comparison of the binding curves of type I and II collagens disclosed higher association rates and lower dissociation rates for type I collagen, showing a higher affinity for this collagen. Attempts to calculate the affinities of the interactions using different models did not result in acceptable curve fits. This could be due to the presence of several binding sites for PRELP on the collagen molecule (see below) or possibly to the self-interaction of collagen, once bound to the PRELP surface. To visualize the complexes between PRELP, perlecan, and procollagen I, we performed electron microscopy after glycerol spraying/rotary shadowing and negative staining. The carboxyl-terminal globular propeptide of procollagen was used to indicate the polarity of the collagen helix. In negative staining electron microscopy of complexes, PRELP was identified at two distinct sites at the triple helical region of the procollagen molec"
https://openalex.org/W1967703115,"We demonstrated previously that 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO), a key enzyme in leukotriene biosynthesis, can be phosphorylated by p38 MAPK-regulated MAPKAP kinases (MKs). Here we show that mutation of Ser-271 to Ala in 5-LO abolished MK2 catalyzed phosphorylation and clearly reduced phosphorylation by kinases prepared from stimulated polymorphonuclear leukocytes and Mono Mac 6 cells. Compared with heat shock protein 27 (Hsp-27), 5-LO was a weak substrate for MK2. However, the addition of unsaturated fatty acids (i.e. arachidonate 1–50 μm) up-regulated phosphorylation of 5-LO, but not of Hsp-27, by active MK2 in vitro, resulting in a similar phosphorylation as for Hsp-27. 5-LO was phosphorylated also by other serine/threonine kinases recognizing the motif Arg-Xaa-Xaa-Ser (protein kinase A, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II), but these activities were not increased by fatty acids. HeLa cells expressing wild type 5-LO or S271A-5-LO, showed prominent 5-LO activity when incubated with Ca2+-ionophore plus arachidonate. However, when stimulated with only exogenous arachidonic acid, activity for the S271A mutant was significantly lower as compared with wild type 5-LO. It appears that phosphorylation at Ser-271 is more important for 5-LO activity induced by a stimulus that does not prominently increase intracellular Ca2+ and that arachidonic acid stimulates leukotriene biosynthesis also by promoting this MK2-catalyzed phosphorylation.

Depending on the cell type, 5-LO is present in the cytosol but also in a nuclear soluble pool of resting cells. Upon cell stimulation, soluble 5-LO translocates to the nuclear membrane where it colocalizes with 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein (FLAP) and cytosolic phospholipase A2, and initializes the formation of LTs (for review see Ref. 4.Peters-Golden M.

J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 71: 169-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We found that also 5-LO is a substrate for p38 MAPK-regulated MKs (10.Werz O. Klemm J. Samuelsson B. Radmark O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5261-5266Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar,12.Werz O. Klemm J. Radmark O. Samuelsson B. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2001; 70: 830-838PubMed Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that Ser-271 is a phosphorylation site in 5-LO and that unsaturated fatty acids such as AA stimulate phosphorylation of 5-LO at Ser-271 by MK2. This phosphorylation site was more important for 5-LO activity in transfected cells stimulated with only exogenous AA as compared with cells stimulated with AA plus Ca2+-ionophore. Human transforming growth factor β was purified from outdated platelets as described (26.Werz O. Brungs M. Steinhilber D. Pharmazie. 1996; 51: 893-896PubMed Google Scholar). 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 was from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA); RPMI 1640 from Invitrogen; fetal calf serum, bovine insulin, protein kinase A (PKA) catalytic subunit, human recombinant Hsp-27, arachidic acid, linoleic acid, linolenic acid, palmitic acid, oleic acid, Ca2+-ionophore A23187, and fMLP from Sigma; arachidonic acid from Nu-Chek (Elysian, MN); SB203580 from Calbiochem; [γ-32P]ATP (110 TBq/mmol) from Amersham Biosciences; HPLC solvents from Rathburn Chemicals (Walkerburn, Scotland); activated GST-MK2 and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase (CaMK) II from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY); and oligonucleotides were from Cyber Gene (Huddinge, Sweden). Mono Mac 6 (MM6) cells were cultured and differentiated with transforming growth factor β and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 as described (10.Werz O. Klemm J. Samuelsson B. Radmark O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5261-5266Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested by centrifugation (200 × g, 10 min at room temperature) and washed once in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4 (PBS). Human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL) were isolated from leukocyte concentrates obtained from healthy donors at Karolinska Hospital. For incubations, MM6 cells and PMNL were finally resuspended in PGC buffer (PBS with 1 mm Ca2+ and 1 mg/ml glucose). HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 units/ml penicillin at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. Plasmid DNA (pcDNA3.1-5LO, 10 μg) was transiently transfected into HeLa and HEK-293 cells using the Ca2+-phosphate method (27.Chen C.A. Okayama H. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), cultured for 48 h, and assayed for 5-LO activity. The codon for Ser-271 in the plasmid pT3-5LO was mutated using the QuikChange™ kit from Stratagene as described (5.Hammarberg T. Provost P. Persson B. Radmark O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38787-38793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The mutated DNA was confirmed using the Applied Biosystem PRISM Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), followed by analysis on a Applied Biosystem PRISM 377 sequencer (carried out by KISeq, Core Facilities at Karolinska Institutet). Escherichia coli MV1190 was transformed with mutated and wild type (wt) DNA, and recombinant 5-LO proteins were expressed at 27 °C and purified as described (5.Hammarberg T. Provost P. Persson B. Radmark O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38787-38793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The mutated plasmid pcDNA3.1-5LO-S271A was prepared from pcDNA3.1-5LO (28.Provost P. Doucet J. Hammarberg T. Gerisch G. Samuelsson B. Rådmark O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16520-16527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) by replacement of the EcoRV toNotI fragment with the corresponding DNA fragment from pT3-5LO-S271A. PMNL and differentiated MM6 cells (5 × 107 and 2.5 × 107, respectively, in 1 ml of PGC buffer) were stimulated with the indicated additives for 3 min at 37 °C. Incubations were stopped by addition of the same volume of 2× SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer (SDS-b) and heated for 6 min at 95 °C. Total cell lysates corresponding to 0.25 × 106 MM6 cells or 0. 5 × 106PMNL were loaded on 10% SDS-PAGE. A Mini Protean system (Bio-Rad) was used, and the separation gels contained 0.2 mg/ml purified recombinant human wt-5-LO or S271A-5-LO. After electrophoresis, 5-LO phosphorylation by activated kinases was analyzed by in-gel kinase assay as described previously (10.Werz O. Klemm J. Samuelsson B. Radmark O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5261-5266Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). For preparation of immunoprecipitates (IPs), MM6 cell incubations were stopped by the addition of 2 volumes of ice-cold stop buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, and 2 mmNa3VO4) and cooled on ice. After about 2 min on ice, cells were pelleted (500 × g, 3 min, 4 °C) and lysed by the addition of ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaF, 2 mm Na3VO4, 25 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm 4-nitrophenyl phosphate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μm ZnCl2, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 60 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor). During 10 min in this buffer, the suspension was vortexed repeatedly (5 s bursts) to assure complete lysis. Supernatants were obtained by centrifugation of the lysates (16,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C) and kept on ice. To immunoprecipitate MK2, supernatants corresponding to 2 × 107 MM6 cells were incubated with 5 μl of MK2-antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 2 h at 4 °C. The immune complexes were precipitated (2 h at 4 °C) with 20 μl of protein A/G Plus-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and washed twice with lysis buffer and twice with kinase buffer. For in vitrophosphorylation studies, purified recombinant wt-5-LO, S271A-5-LO, and recombinant Hsp-27 (40 pmol each) were preincubated in the absence or presence of fatty acids in kinase buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 25 mm MgCl2, 25 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na3VO4) for 5 min at room temperature. Then, kinase (MK2-IPs, MK2, CaMKII, and catalytic subunit of PKA) was added and the reaction was started by the addition of ATP (100 μm) and [γ-32P]ATP (100 μCi/ml). The final volume was 20 μl, and incubation time was 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of the same volume of SDS-b and heating at 95 °C for 6 min. Samples (20 μl) were separated by SDS-PAGE, and proteins were first visualized by Coomassie staining to assure correct loading of protein. Phosphorylated proteins were then visualized by autoradiography and quantitated by densitometry using a Gel Doc 1000 instrument and the Molecular Analyst software (Bio-Rad), or alternatively they were analyzed with a Phosphoimager (Fuji FLA-3000). Here we define 1 milliunit of kinase activity (MK2, CaMKII, and the catalytic subunit of PKA) as incorporation of 1 pmol of phosphate into a standard substrate peptide. Since the standard substrates used by the suppliers are different for the different kinases, the unit amounts are not strictly comparable. Purified recombinant 5-LO (3 μg or 40 pmol) was phosphorylated in vitro by activated MK2 (10 milliunits) in the presence of ATP (100 μm) and [γ-32P]ATP (2 μCi/ml) with or without 50 μm AA as described above. After separation of proteins by SDS-PAGE, 5-LO was excised from the gel, and in-gel digestion of 5-LO by trypsin was performed as described (29.Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7831) Google Scholar). The gel was extracted by acidic, basic, and lipophilic extraction methods to recover all peptides, and successful digestion was confirmed by MALDI analysis (matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization). The tryptic digests were resuspended in glacial acetic acid and subjected to thin layer electrophoresis and subsequent ascending chromatography as described (30.de Carvalho M.G.S. McCormack A.L. Olson E. Ghomashchi F. Gelb M.H. Yates III, J.R. Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6987-6997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). After air drying the phosphopeptides were visualized using a Phosphoimager Fuji FLA-3000. Isolated human PMNL (3 × 107 in 1 ml PGC buffer) were incubated for 5 min at 37 °C with the indicated additives. Samples were chilled on ice, and nuclear and non-nuclear fractions were obtained after cell lysis by 0.1% Nonidet P-40 as described previously (11.Werz O. Klemm J. Samuelsson B. Radmark O. Blood. 2001; 97: 2487-2495Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Aliquots of nuclear and non-nuclear fractions were immediately mixed with the same volume of SDS-b, heated for 6 min at 95 °C, and analyzed for 5-LO protein by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Subcellular fractions or total cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE using a Mini Protean system (Bio-Rad) on a 4–15% linear gradient gel. After electroblot to nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond C, Amersham Biosciences), blocking with 5% nonfat dry milk in 50 mm TBS (Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 100 mmNaCl), membranes were washed and then incubated with primary antibody for overnight at 4 °C. A 5-LO column was used to produce an affinity-purified anti-5-LO antiserum (1551, AK7). Anti-p38 MAPK antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and phospho-specific antibodies recognizing p38 MAPK (Thr-180/Tyr-182) were obtained from New England Biolabs and used as 1:2,000 dilution. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated IgGs as described (5.Hammarberg T. Provost P. Persson B. Radmark O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38787-38793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Cells (5 × 106 PMNL, HeLa 2 × 106) in 1 ml of PGC buffer were stimulated by the addition of exogenous AA at the indicated concentrations with or without ionophore. After 5 min at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped with 1 ml of methanol and 30 ml of 1n HCl, and then 200 ng of prostaglandin B1 and 500 μl of PBS were added. 5-LO metabolites were extracted and analyzed by HPLC as described (31.Werz O. Steinhilber D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 90-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). 5-LO activity is expressed as pmol of 5-LO products per 106 cells, which includes LTB4 and its all-trans-isomers, 5(S),12(S)-dihydroxy-6,10-trans-8,14-cis-eicosatetraenoic acid, 5-HPETE and 5-HETE. We showed that 5-LO is a substrate for p38 MAPK-regulated MKs in vitro, and we identified a MK2 phosphorylation motif (hyd-Xaa-Arg-Xaa-Xaa-Ser) within the primary sequence of 5-LO with Ser-271 as the putative phosphorylation site (10.Werz O. Klemm J. Samuelsson B. Radmark O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5261-5266Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). To determine the sites of 5-LO phosphorylation by MKs, Ser-271 was mutated to alanine. Phosphorylation of wt-5-LO and S271A-5-LO was analyzed by in-gel kinase assays using lysates from activated MM6 cells and PMNL as sources for active kinases. Using wt-5-LO as substrate, lysates of ionophore-stimulated MM6 cells and ionophore (or fMLP)-stimulated PMNL contained 5-LO kinase activities migrating at ∼40, 47, and 55 kDa (Fig. 1). These bands agree which the positions of MK2 and MK3 (compare Ref. 10.Werz O. Klemm J. Samuelsson B. Radmark O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5261-5266Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). With samples from ionophore-stimulated MM6 cells, particularly the kinase activity migrating at 47 kDa (presumably MK2) was reduced when mutated S271A-5-LO was used as substrate. However, kinase activities at 55 and 40 kDa were still observed. When mutated S271A-5-LO was used as substrate for kinases prepared from PMNL, activities migrating at 47 and 40 kDa were very weak, but a 55-kDa kinase activity remained, which is best seen with the sample from cells stimulated with fMLP. It appears that kinase activities migrating close to 40 kDa were different in MM6 cells and PMNL. This activity from MM6 cells remained with S271A-5-LO as substrate, but for PMNL samples (apparently two bands) it was practically absent with S271A-5-LO as substrate. Since MK3 recognizes the same motif as MK2 (32.Sithanandam G. Latif F. Duh F.M. Bernal R. Smola U. Li H. Kuzmin I. Wixler V. Geil L. Shrestha S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 868-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 33.Clifton A.D. Young P.R. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 34.New L. Jiang Y. Zhao M. Liu K. Zhu W. Flood L.J. Kato Y. Parry G.C. Han J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3372-3384Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), this further confirms that the PMNL 40 kDa band is MK3. In summary, Ser-271 is important for phosphorylation of 5-LO, but kinases recognizing other motifs were present, particularly in extracts from stimulated MM6 cells. The MM6 cell kinase activities migrating above 57 kDa appeared also without 5-LO in the gel, which is believed to reflect autophosphorylation of various kinases (10.Werz O. Klemm J. Samuelsson B. Radmark O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5261-5266Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). To estimate the efficiency of 5-LO phosphorylation by MK2, we compared 5-LO and Hsp-27 as substrates for MK2, by in vitro kinase assays. Hsp-27 is phosphorylated by MK2 at three serine residues, most efficiently on Ser-82 followed by Ser-78 and Ser-15 (33.Clifton A.D. Young P.R. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Purified 5-LO (40 pmol) or human Hsp-27 (40 pmol) was incubated with the same amounts of active recombinant MK2 inin vitro kinase assays, and phosphorylated proteins were visualized and quantitated after SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig. 2 A, 5-LO is a rather weak substrate for activated MK2 (10 milliunits) compared with Hsp-27. Densitometric analysis of phosphorylated bands obtained after audioradiography revealed that MK2 is ∼20–30-fold more active toward Hsp-27 than toward 5-LO. Similar differences in phosphorylation were obtained when the amount of substrates or amount of MK2 was varied. Co-incubation of 5-LO together with Hsp-27 did not reduce phosphorylation of Hsp-27, indicating that 5-LO had no inhibitory effect on kinase activity of MK2 or any phosphatase activity (data not shown). AA dose-dependently enhanced 5-LO phosphorylation by MK2, about 3-fold at 1 μm AA and up to about 30-fold at 50 μm AA as shown in Fig. 2 B(left panel). Thus, in the presence of AA, MK2 efficiently phosphorylates 5-LO, comparable with Hsp-27. Ca2+ (0.01–1 mm) and phosphatidylcholine (20 μg/ml), as well as cellular soluble or particulate fractions (which can increase catalytic activity of 5-LO in vitro) gave no such up-regulation but rather reduced MK2 activity toward 5-LO in the absence or presence of AA (data not shown). In contrast to 5-LO, no increase in phosphorylation of Hsp-27 was obtained after adding AA to the reaction mixture (Fig. 2 B, right panel). Higher amounts of MK2 augmented Hsp-27 phosphorylation dose-dependently, indicating that substrate supply was not a limiting factor. This effect of AA could be related to phosphorylation of other sites in 5-LO, in addition to Ser-271. Therefore, we investigated whether AA induced phosphorylation of the S271A mutant by MK2. The same amounts of wt- and S271A-5-LO proteins were used in in vitro kinase assays with active MK2 as kinase (Fig. 2 C, upper panel). Prior to drying and exposure of the gels, Coomassie staining was performed to ensure correct loading of 5-LO proteins (lower panel). As shown in Fig. 2 C, S271A-5-LO was not a substrate for MK2 in vitro neither in the absence or presence of AA. Enhanced 5-LO phosphorylation in the presence of AA might be due to phosphate incorporation at additional sites of 5-LO by MK2, which require initial phosphorylation at Ser-271. Therefore, two-dimensional phosphopeptide analyses of 5-LO incubated with MK2 in the presence or absence of AA (50 μm) were performed. As seen in Fig. 2 D, only one major phosphopeptide was detectable in both samples. For the sample derived from 5-LO that was phosphorylated in the presence of 50 μm AA, the signal of this phosphopeptide was much more intense as compared with the control. Thus, AA apparently increases 5-LO phosphorylation at one major site (Ser-271) but does not lead to phosphorylation at additional sites. The faint spots on the left of the plates (seen for both samples) might result from incomplete trypsin digestion. We also determined the capability of other long chain fatty acids to stimulate phosphorylation of 5-LO by MK2. The results in Fig. 3 illustrate that oleic acid (C18:1) was effective. Compared with AA, the concentration of oleic acid required for the same effect appeared to be slightly lower. Similar dose-dependent up-regulation of 5-LO phosphorylation by MK2 was observed with linoleic acid (C18:2) and linolenic acid (C18:3) at 10–50 μm (data not shown). In contrast, arachidic acid (C20:0) (the saturated derivative of AA) or palmitic acid (C16:0) up to 50 μm caused only marginal enhancement of 5-LO phosphorylation (Fig. 3). Also oxygenated metabolites of polyunsaturated fatty acids (13-HPODE, 5-HPETE, LTB4) gave only slight (about 2–4-fold) increase in 5-LO phosphorylation (not shown). No enhancement of phosphorylation was obtained with esterified fatty acids (oleyl-acetyl-glycerol, mixed phosphatidylcholines; data not shown). These findings indicate that efficient phosphorylation of 5-LO by MK2 in vitro requires the presence of free unsaturated fatty acids. The MK2 phosphorylation motif, hyd-Xaa-Arg-Xaa-Xaa-Ser, is also recognized by other basic amino acid-directed Ser/Thr kinases (for example PKC, PKA, and CaMK II and IV). Thus, we tested whether kinases other than MKs could phosphorylate 5-LO in in vitro kinase assays (Fig. 4). The catalytic subunit of PKA as well as CaMKII phosphorylated 5-LO in a dose-dependent manner. Interestingly, PKA and CaMKII also phosphorylated Hsp-27 (not shown). The amounts of kinases used are given in units as provided by the suppliers. Please note that the unit definitions for these kinases are based on different synthetic substrates and may not be directly comparable. As found for MK2, PKA was unable to phosphorylate S271A-5-LO, indicating that PKA also acts on the Ser-271 residue (not shown). As demonstrated in Fig. 5, the presence of AA (or oleic acid, not shown) during the kinase reaction did not enhance the phosphorylation rates of CaMKII and PKA toward 5-LO. In contrast, fatty acids rather inhibited the kinase activity of CaMKII toward 5-LO as well as its autophosphorylation (Fig. 5) as observed by other investigators (35.Piomelli D. Wang J.K. Sihra T.S. Nairn A.C. Czernik A.J. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8550-8554Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar).Figure 5Arachidonic acid stimulates 5-LO phosphorylation by MK2 but not by CaMKII and PKA. Effects of AA on phosphorylation of 5-LO by different kinases was determined by in vitro kinase assays as described under “Experimental Procedures” except that 1 mm CaCl2 and 50 μg/ml calmodulin were added to incubations with CaMKII. 40 pmol of 5-LO and 10 milliunits of MK2, CaMKII, and the catalytic subunit of PKA were used.

https://openalex.org/W1970573661,"The platelet collagen receptor glycoprotein VI (GPVI) couples to the immune receptor adaptor Fc receptor γ-chain (FcRγ) and signals using many of the same intracellular signaling molecules as immune receptors. Studies of immune receptor signaling have revealed a critical role for specialized areas of the cell membrane known as lipid rafts, which are enriched in essential signaling molecules. However, the role of lipid rafts in signaling in nonimmune cells such as platelets remains poorly defined. This study shows that GPVI-FcRγ does not constitutively associate with rafts, but is recruited to lipid rafts following receptor stimulation in both GPVI-expressing RBL-2H3 cells and human platelets. FcRγ is required for GPVI association with lipid rafts, as mutant GPVI receptors that do not couple to FcRγ were unable to associate with lipid rafts after receptor clustering. Following GPVI stimulation in platelets, virtually all phosphorylated FcRγ was found in lipid rafts, but inhibition of FcRγ phosphorylation did not block receptor association with lipid rafts. This work demonstrates that lipid rafts orchestrate GPVI receptor signaling in platelets in a manner analogous to immune cell receptors and supports a model of GPVI signaling in which FcRγ phosphorylation is controlled by ligand-dependent association with lipid rafts.

Like these immune receptors, GPVI is a multisubunit receptor in which the ligand-binding subunit (GPVI) is noncovalently associated with a signaling subunit (Fc receptor γ-chain (FcRγ)) that contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine activation motif (3Clemetson K.J.

Nature. 1999; 402: B24-B30Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar), and platelet activation by GPVI is also believed to result from receptor clustering initiated by interaction with collagen (6Chen H.

Precisely how clustering of immune receptors initiates signal transduction is not well understood, but one proposed mechanism is through receptor association with specialized areas of the cell membrane known as lipid rafts, which are enriched in signaling proteins such as Src family kinases and the transmembrane adaptor LAT (reviewed in Ref.8Simons K.

Lipid rafts are too small to be detected by standard microscopy, but they are resistant to solubilization at low temperature by nonionic detergents and have been isolated using density gradients (11Hooper N.M.

Lipid rafts form distinct membrane compartments that exclude most membrane-associated proteins, but are enriched for some, including acylated Src family kinases such as Lyn and Fyn and palmitoylated adaptor proteins such as LAT (9Dorahy D.J. Burns G.F. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 13Horejsi V. Drbal K. Cebecauer M. Cerny J. Brdicka T. Angelisova P. Stockinger H. Immunol.

Immunity. 1998; 9: 239-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). Lipid rafts are believed to participate in immune receptor signal transduction by sequestering oligomerized receptors in a microenvironment in which they interact productively with downstream signaling molecules. The role of lipid rafts as a signaling platform is supported by genetic studies demonstrating that the raft-associated protein LAT is required for downstream signaling by the FcεRI and T-cell receptors (15Saitoh S.

Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8157) Google Scholar). Although lipid rafts and raft-associated proteins have been identified in many cell types, including platelets (9Dorahy D.J. Burns G.F. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), the role of lipid rafts in receptor signaling in nonimmune cells is largely unexplored. To assess the role of lipid rafts in GPVI-FcRγ signaling, we have taken advantage of the ability to confer GPVI signaling in the basophilic RBL-2H3 cell line (4Zheng Y.M. Liu C. Chen H. Locke D. Ryan J.C. Kahn M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12999-13006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and studied endogenous GPVI responses in human platelets. RBL-2H3 cells express FcεRI, which also couples to FcRγ; and activation of FcεRI in these cells results in transient receptor association with lipid rafts (17Field K.A. Holowka D. Baird B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9201-9205Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 18Field K.A. Holowka D. Baird B. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 1753-1758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). As observed for FcεRI, virtually no GPVI was associated with lipid rafts in RBL-2H3 cells under basal conditions, but activation of GPVI by CVX resulted in movement of a significant number of receptors to lipid rafts. Studies using human platelets revealed a similar activation-dependent movement of GPVI to lipid rafts where Src family tyrosine kinases were constitutively present. Following GPVI-FcRγ activation, phosphorylated FcRγ was found exclusively in lipid rafts; but, surprisingly, inhibition of FcRγ phosphorylation did not block GPVI association with lipid rafts. In RBL-2H3 cells, clustering of mutant GPVI receptors that do not couple to FcRγ failed to induce receptor movement to lipid rafts, demonstrating a critical role for FcRγ in this process. Our results establish a role for lipid rafts in platelets and support a model of platelet activation by GPVI in which receptor activation stimulates movement to lipid rafts, where FcRγ is phosphorylated to initiate downstream signaling. Whether other receptors in platelets utilize lipid rafts for signaling and whether platelet lipid rafts contain unique proteins to facilitate receptor signaling remain to be determined. All reagents were from Sigma unless stated otherwise. The RBL-2H3 cell line that stably expresses human GPVI has been described (4Zheng Y.M. Liu C. Chen H. Locke D. Ryan J.C. Kahn M.L. J. Biol.

Convulxin was purified from the venom of the South American rattlesnake (Crotalus durissus terrificus) by gel filtration (20Leduc M. Bon C. Biochem.

Mouse anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody 4G10, rabbit anti-LAT polyclonal antibody, and anti-FcRγ antibody were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Mouse anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody PY20 and rabbit anti-Lyn polyclonal antibody were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Mouse anti-dinitrophenol (DNP) IgE and a mouse monoclonal antibody recognizing the FLAG epitope (bio-M2) was purchased from Sigma, as were α- and β-cyclodextrins. The production of a mouse anti-human GPVI monoclonal antibody is described in detail elsewhere (6Chen H. Locke D. Liu Y. Liu C. Kahn M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3011-3019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and briefly below. Human GPVI with a transmembrane mutation replacing arginine 272 with leucine (R272L) was expressed on the surface of the Balb/c strain of 3T3 fibroblasts. R272L-3T3 cells were used as an immunogen and injected peritoneally into a Balb/c background. Hybridoma cell lines were screened by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis of RBL-2H3 cells expressing wild-type human GPVI and human platelets using mouse platelets as an isogenic control. HY101 was affinity-purified using protein G and covalently modified with one of the following: biotin (F-2610, Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR), fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) (F-6434, Molecular Probes, Inc.), or Cy3 (PA-33001, APBiotech, Piscataway, NJ) according to the accompanying instructions. Adherent cells were detached from culture plates using 5 mm EDTA and resuspended in RHB medium (RPMI 1640 medium containing 25 mm HEPES and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA)) at a concentration of 2 × 107 cells/ml. Fura-2/AM (Molecular Probes, Inc.) was added to 4 μg/ml, and cells were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Excess Fura-2/AM was removed by washing in RHB medium. Fluorescence was measured using a Aminco-Bowman Series-2 luminescence spectrometer (SLM-AMINCO, Urbana, IL). Fluorescence was measured at 340 and 380 nm for excitation and at 510 nm for emission. Cells (2 × 106) were stirred continuously during the fluorescence recording. The data were recorded as the relative ratio of fluorescence excited at 340 and 380 nm and the concentration of mobilized calcium using a dissociation constant of 224 nmol/liter for Fura-2/Ca2+. RBL-2H3 cells (5 × 106) were sensitized for 1 h on ice in 0.1 m phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) and 3% fetal calf serum with 10 μg/ml125I-labeled mouse anti-DNP IgE. The high affinity Fc receptor for IgE (FcεRI) was clustered using 10 μg/ml DNP-BSA (Molecular Probes, Inc.) for 3 min at 37 °C (18Field K.A. Holowka D. Baird B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4276-4280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 19Field K.A. Holowka D. Baird B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1753-1758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). 10 μg of DNP was added as a control. 125I-HY101 was used to label the extracellular domain of GPVI. Antibody binding to the epitope was independent of convulxin binding to the extracellular domain of GPVI. RBL-2H3 cells (5 × 106) containing human GPVI and structural variants of GPVI (as described below) were incubated with 5 μg/ml125I-labeled anti-GPVI monoclonal antibody HY101 and then washed as described above. Human blood was collected into acid/citrate/dextrose buffer (71 mm citric acid containing 1 μg of prostacyclin E1, 85 mm sodium citrate, and 111 mm glucose), and platelet-rich plasma was obtained by centrifugation at 200 ×gav. Platelet-rich plasma was incubated with 1 μg of 125I-labeled anti-GPVI monoclonal antibody HY101/107 human platelets for 1 h at room temperature. Platelets were isolated from platelet-rich plasma and free antibody by centrifugation after dilution in a 5-fold excess of 150 mmsodium chloride, 10 mm HEPES (pH 6.5), 5 mmEDTA, and 1 μm prostacyclin. A total of 5 × 107 platelets were used in each gradient assay. GPVI-expressing RBL-2H3 cells and human platelets were allowed to recover for 30 min at 37 °C. GPVI was clustered using 10 nm CVX for 30 s. Untreated cells were used as a negative control for CVX-receptor clustering. Reactions were stopped by lysis in fresh ice-cold 2× lysis buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 100 mm sodium chloride, 4 mm sodium vanadate, 60 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 20 mmsodium glycerophosphate, 0.02% (v/v) sodium azide, and a 100-fold dilution of Sigma protease inhibitor mixture (P-8340) and Sigma phosphatase inhibitor mixture (P-2850 and P-5726)) with surfectAmps Triton X-100 (Pierce) added immediately before use from a 10% (w/v) stock (percent (w/v) Triton X-100 final concentrations indicated below). Cell lysate was mixed with an equal volume of 80% (w/v) sucrose in 25 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, and 2 mm EDTA. The final volume was always 2.0 ml at 40% (w/v) sucrose. In all experiments, to exclude artifactual possibilities, Triton X-100 was added to the gradient buffers. All gradient solutions and the rotor were suitably pre-cooled. Gradients (from bottom to top) were 80% (w/v) (1.0 ml), 40% (lysate, 2.0 ml), 30% (w/v) (1.5 ml), and 10% (w/v) (0.50 ml) sucrose (total of 5 ml) and were centrifuged at 200,000 ×gav using a Beckman SW 55 rotor for 18 h with minimal acceleration and no braking. Fractions (20 fractions at 250 μl each) including the pellet (in fraction 20) were collected sequentially from the top of the gradient and were assayed by gamma counting for movement of receptors into buoyant lipid rafts. For SDS-PAGE, gradient fractions 1–20 (250 μl each) were combined into 10 500-μl fractions (i–x sequentially from the top of the gradients) and heated to 100 °C in 5× modified Laemmli sample buffer (3.5 m Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 0.5m dithiothreitol, and 10% (w/v) SDS). Alternatively, fractions were used for immunoprecipitations (see below). For immunoprecipitations from total cell lysates, cells were lysed for 1 h at 4 °C in ice-cold 2× lysis buffer (2% (w/v) digitonin (Calbiochem), 0.24% (v/v) Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 0.02% (w/v) NaN3, and 20 mm triethanolamine (pH 7.8) containing a 1:100 (v/v) dilution of Sigma mammalian protease phosphatase inhibitor mixture). Sucrose gradient fractions were diluted in 2× ice-cold raft lysis buffer (same as the lysis buffer described above with 60 mmn-octyl β-d-glucoside to ensure full solubilization of lipid rafts and associated proteins). Detergent-insoluble cellular debris was pelleted at 10,000 ×gav for 15 min, and the supernatants were used for immunoprecipitations. Supernatants were precleared with a mixture of protein G and protein LA beads (50% (w/v) slurry in lysis buffers). Primary antibodies were added overnight and immunoprecipitated the following day with protein G/LA beads. Beads were pelleted by centrifugation and washed three times in ice-cold wash buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl (pH 8.0), and 5 mm CHAPS). Beads were heated to 100 °C in an equal volume of 2× Laemmli sample buffer (1m Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 0.2 m dithiothreitol, 4% (w/v) SDS, 0.004% bromphenol blue, and 20% glycerol), and an aliquot was run on 5–20% (v/v) gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gels for Western blotting/ECL. Platelets were isolated from platelet-rich plasma by gel filtration through Sepharose 2B (APBiotech) using a modified Tyrode's buffer (137 mmsodium chloride, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 5.6 mmglucose, 1 mg/ml BSA, 1 mm magnesium chloride, 2.7 mm potassium chloride, and 3.3 mm sodium dihydrogen phosphate) as the eluent. Gel-filtered platelets (22Watson S.P. Platelets: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1996Google Scholar) were incubated for 5 min at 37 °C with the indicated concentrations of the PP2 kinase inhibitor or the nonspecific control for the PP3 inhibitor (both from Calbiochem). Resting cells and cells stimulated with 10 nm CVX for 30 s were lysed with an equal volume of 2× Laemmli buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting on polyvinylidene difluoride membrane probed with mouse anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibodies 4G10 and PY20. Gel-filtered platelets were incubated with the indicated concentrations of β-cyclodextrin or the inactive stereoisomer control, α-cyclodextrin (data not shown), for 1 h at 30 °C. Platelets were washed by centrifugation at 800 ×gav at least three times in a 5-fold excess of 150 mm sodium chloride, 10 mm HEPES (pH 6.5), 5 mm EDTA, and 1 μm prostacyclin. For cholesterol repletion, cholesterol-depleted cells were repleted using cholesterol/β-cyclodextrin as described (23Furuchi T. Anderson R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21099-21104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). The efficiency of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between FITC- and Cy3-labeled mouse anti-GPVI monoclonal antibody HY101 on the surface of RBL-2H3 cells was measured by flow cytometry using a BD PharMingen FACStar with dual-laser excitation (488 and 528 nm). The contribution of autofluorescence was determined from unlabeled cells and/or irrelevant FITC and Cy3 controls. To calculate FRET efficiency for dual-labeled cells and also to confirm that FRET between FITC-HY101 and Cy3-HY101 was due to receptor clustering and was not an artifact of high receptor density, correction factors for spectral overlap were determined from single labeling by substitution of either donor or acceptor fluorochrome with unlabeled HY101. At least 10,000 events were collected from the same cell population every 30-s interval for 5 min after addition of 10 nm CVX. To test the role of lipid rafts in signaling by the platelet collagen receptor GPVI, we expressed the receptor in RBL-2H3 cells (4Zheng Y.M. Liu C. Chen H. Locke D. Ryan J.C. Kahn M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12999-13006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), a basophilic cell line that expresses endogenous FcRγ and FcεRI (24Barsumian E.L. Isersky C. Petrino M.G. Siraganian R.P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1981; 11: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). The RBL-2H3 cell line is used as a model cell line to study the earliest membrane-associated events in signaling through FcεRI (25Holowka D. Baird B. Semin. Immunol. 2001; 13: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Studies by Field et al. (18Field K.A. Holowka D. Baird B. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 1753-1758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) have established that FcεRI signaling in RBL-2H3 cells proceeds through a transient association with lipid rafts, which requires precise detergent conditions to capture. Expression of GPVI in RBL-2H3 cells confers calcium signaling in response to the GPVI-specific agonist convulxin, which requires GPVI coupling to endogenous FcRγ (4Zheng Y.M. Liu C. Chen H. Locke D. Ryan J.C. Kahn M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12999-13006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The movement of GPVI receptors during signaling was followed using a radiolabeled anti-GPVI monoclonal antibody, 125I-HY101. HY101 was generated against an undefined epitope on the extracellular domain of human GPVI, and receptor binding did not prevent CVX binding to GPVI (Fig. 1A) or convulxin-induced calcium responses (Fig. 1B). Lipid rafts were isolated as described (see “Experimental Procedures”) using sucrose gradients and defined as being Triton X-100-insoluble membranes enriched in GM1, a ganglioside lipid marker (26Harder T. Scheiffele P. Verkade P. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 929-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar), and LAT (27Zhang W. Sloan-Lancaster J. Kitchen J. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 83-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). GPVI receptors were detected in lipid rafts at low levels under basal conditions (1.8 ± 0.5%), but receptor association with lipid rafts increased almost 8-fold following receptor activation by CVX (13.5 ± 1.6%) (Fig. 2A). Although less quantitative, immunoblot analysis of cell lysate following sucrose gradient analysis also revealed the movement of GPVI receptors to lipid raft fractions following CVX stimulation (Fig. 2A). As previously reported, activation of endogenous FcεRI in these cells resulted in a similar movement of FcεRI receptors to lipid rafts (Fig. 2, B and C). FcεRI identified in raft fractions was 3.8 ± 0.7% after DNP stimulation (a non-clustering ligand) and 20.6 ± 3.5% after DNP/BSA clustering, a 5.5-fold increase. No GPVI was detected in lipid rafts if GPVI was clustered by CVX following cell lysis in Triton X-100, suggesting that association of activated GPVI with lipid rafts is not merely a biochemical property of clustered receptors (data not shown). Cross-linking of raft GM1 by pentavalent cholera toxin B subunit or cross-linking the endogenous FcRγ partner FcεRI also had no effect on 125I-HY101-labeled GPVI distribution in the sucrose centrifugation gradient (data not shown). Finally, aggregation of GPVI by CVX did not alter the restricted localization of Lyn and LAT in lipid rafts (data not shown). Thus, GPVI signaling in RBL-2H3 cells is associated with the movement of a considerable fraction of receptors to lipid rafts, a response that closely mimics FcεRI.Figure 2GPVI and FcεRI associate with lipid rafts following receptor stimulation in RBL-2H3 cells.A, GPVI moves to lipid rafts following CVX stimulation. GPVI-expressing RBL-2H3 cells prelabeled with125I-labeled anti-GPVI monoclonal antibody HY101 were treated with 10 nm CVX for 30 s (■) or left untreated (○) before lysis in 0.025% (w/v) Triton X-100. Cell lysate was centrifuged through sucrose gradients as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and fractions were taken sequentially from the top (fraction 1) of the gradient. % receptor indicates the percentage of 125I-HY101-labeled GPVI in each gradient fraction including the pellet (fraction 20). The position of lipid rafts was identified by dot blotting of the lipid raft marker GM1 using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated cholera toxin B subunit as a probe. LAT in lipid rafts was shown by immunoblotting. GPVI distribution with and without CVX stimulation was also followed by immunoblotting (lower panels). The experiment shown is representative of seven independent experiments. B, FcεRI receptors move to lipid rafts following cross-linking with DNP/BSA. RBL-2H3 cells sensitized with 125I-labeled anti-DNP IgE were lysed with 0.025% (w/v) Triton X-100 after 3 min of stimulation with 10 μg of DNP (○) or 10 μg of DNP/BSA (■). The distribution of 125I-IgE-labeled FcεRI expressed as a percentage of total 125I in the gradient and is representative of five independent experiments. C, the percentage of total GPVI and FcεRI receptors that move to lipid rafts after cross-linking is similar. The percentage of total FcεRI (open bars) and GPVI (closed bars) receptors within lipid raft fractions before and after addition of multivalent ligand is shown (means ± S.D. of seven and five experiments, respectively).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) FcεRI association with lipid rafts following receptor activation in RBL-2H3 cells is transient and difficult to capture biochemically unless detergent conditions are optimized (18Field K.A.

Association of aggregated GPVI with lipid rafts also depended to a great extent on the detergent conditions employed (Fig. 3). Optimal recovery of clustered GPVI was observed at a final concentration of 0.025% (w/v) Triton X-100 (0.40 mm) in the sucrose gradient (Fig. 3A and Table I). Treatment of lipid rafts isolated using 0.025% (w/v) Triton X-100 with a 2-fold higher Triton X-100 concentration (0.05%) resulted in a drop in GPVI recovery in raft fractions from 19 to 2% despite no detectable loss of the constitutive raft protein LAT (Fig. 3B).

Acta. 2000; 1508: 182-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar) to the cell lysis buffer also led to the exclusive recovery of GPVI in the non-raft membranes (Fig. 3C). The rigorous detergent isolation conditions required to demonstrate association of both GPVI and FcεRI receptors with lipid rafts is likely to reflect the transient nature of this association.Table IInfluence of Triton X-100 concentration on recovery of clustered GPVI from lipid rafts in RBL-2H3 cellsTriton X-100 (w/v) final conc in sucrose gradient%0.0100.0250.0500.100GPVI in raft%Unstimulated0.741.451.220.85+10 nmCVX2.1316.733.672.90Increase in receptor movement to raft-fold2.8911.553.013.42 Open table in a new tab Using the conditions and methods established for following receptor movement in GPVI-expressing RBL-2H3 cells, association of GPVI receptors with lipid rafts in human platelets was investigated (Fig. 4). Lipid rafts isolated from human platelets were enriched in GM1, LAT, and the Src family kinase Lyn (Fig. 4A). As previously observed in RBL-2H3 cells, under resting conditions, GPVI receptors were not associated with lipid rafts; but following platelet stimulation with CVX, a significant number of GPVI receptors were found associated with lipid rafts (Fig. 4, A and C). Compared with receptor movement in clonal lines of GPVI-expressing RBL-2H3 cells, the movement of GPVI receptors to lipid rafts in human platelets was more variable. GPVI receptors in lipid rafts under resting conditions were detected at 1.7 ± 0.9% and rose to 23.7 ± 12.5% with CVX stimulation, an average 12.5-fold increase (values represent means ± S.D. of 15 independent experiments performed on platelets from three individuals). The isolation of CVX-clustered GPVI-FcRγ from platelet lipid rafts was sensitive to cholesterol depletion. Although the dose response and amount of GPVI-FcRγ recovered in rafts after β-cyclodextrin treatment also showed individual variability, a drop in GPVI recovery in raft fractions to near basal levels was complete using 20 mm β-cyclodextrin and could be reversed by cholesterol repletion (Fig. 4B). Phosphorylation of tyrosine residues on FcRγ is a critical early event in GPVI signaling in platelets (28Gibbins J. Asselin J. Farndale R. Barnes M. Law C.L. Watson S.P. J. Biol.

Expression of c-Myc and anchorage-independent growth were enhanced in resistant cells. Resistance was unstable in each of three clones characterized. In resistant cells, as compared with parental cells, ∼10-fold less 4E-binding protein (4E-BP) was bound to eIF4E, and total cellular 4E-BP was markedly reduced. Levels of eIF4E were unchanged. Steady-state levels of 4E-BP transcript remained unaltered, but the rate of 4E-BP synthesis was reduced in resistant cells. In cells that reverted to rapamycin sensitivity, levels of total 4E-BP returned to those of parental cells. Compared with parental cells, resistant clones had either similar or lower levels and activity of ribosomal p70 S6 kinase, but c-Myc levels were elevated in both resistant and revertant clones. Several colon carcinoma cell lines with intrinsic rapamycin resistance were found to have low 4E-BP:eIF4E ratios. In stable clones of HCT8 carcinoma engineered to overexpress 4E-BP, rapamycin sensitivity increased markedly (>1000-fold) as 4E-BP expression increased. These results suggest that the 4E-BP:eIF4E ratio is an important determinant of rapamycin resistance and controls certain aspects of the malignant phenotype.

In serum-starved quiescent cells, stimulation with growth factor or serum leads to phosphorylation of 4E-BPs and their resultant dissociation from eIF4E, thereby facilitating assembly of the multisubunit complex (eIF4F) and efficient translation of mRNA having highly structured 5′-untranslated regions (21.Sonenberg N. Gene Expr. 1993; 3: 317-323PubMed Google Scholar). Rapamycin prevents phosphorylation of 4E-BPs and prevents dissociation of the 4E-BP·eIF4E complex in growth factor-stimulated cells. The activity of mTOR is directly (22.Pullen N. Dennis P.B. Andjelkovic M. Dufner A. Kozma A.C. Hemmings B.A. Thomas G.

Papst P. Gelfand E.W. Terada N. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 656-660PubMed Google Scholar). Substitution of this residue abrogates rapamycin sensitivity. However, it is less certain whether inhibition of p70 S6 kinase activation is a crucial determinant of the action of rapamycin. Rapamycin inhibited the proliferation of embryonic stem cells in which p70 S6 kinase was disrupted (26.Kawasome H. Papst P. Webb S. Keller G.M. Johnson G.L. Gelfand E.W. Terada N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5033-5038Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar); this finding suggests that other signaling events downstream of mTOR are crucial to growth inhibition. Resistance to rapamycin has been extensively studied in the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae. Dominant mutations in the rapamycin target, TOR, that prevent its binding to the FKBP-12-rapamycin complex have been reported to cause resistance (27.Freeman K. Livi G.P. Gene. 1996; 172: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 28.Cafferkey R. McLaughlin M.M. Young P.R. Johnson R.K. Livi G.P.

Chem. 1995; 270: 27531-27537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In addition, a recessive resistance phenotype was reported to be associated with decreased expression of RBP1, a homolog of mammalian FKBP-12, or with a mutation altering Tyr-89; either of these changes decreased the formation of the rapamycin complex (30.Koser P.L. Eng W.K. Bossard M.J. McLaughlin M.M. Cafferkey R. Sathe G.M. Faucette L. Levy M.A. Johnson R.K. Bergsma D.J. Livi G.P. Gene. 1993; 129: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells selected for resistance to rapamycin after mutagenesis, resistance is associated with a dominant phenotype consistent with a mutant mTOR (31.Dumont F.J. Staruch M.J. Grammer T. Blenis J. Kastner C.A. Rupprecht K.M. Cell. Immunol. 1995; 163: 70-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) that has decreased binding affinity for the FKBP-rapamycin complex. Expression of a mutant mTOR (S2035I) that has reduced affinity for this complex confers marked resistance (32.Chen J. Zheng X.F. Brown E.J. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4947-4951Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 33.Hosoi H. Dilling M.B. Shikata T. Liu L.N. Shu L. Ashmun R.A. Germain G.S. Abraham R.T. Houghton P.J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 886-894PubMed Google Scholar). Rapamycin resistance is also reported to be associated with loss of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27Kip1 (34.Luo Y. Marx S.O. Kiyokawa H. Koff A. Massague J. Marks A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6744-6751Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) and to be enhanced in the cells of patients with ataxiatelangiectasia (35.Beamish H. Williams R. Chen P. Khanna K.K. Hobson K. Watters D. Shiloh Y. Lavin M. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 963-970PubMed Google Scholar). Intrinsic resistance to rapamycin does not correspond to altered phosphorylation of 4E-BPs (36.Marx S.O. Marks A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6041-6047Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This finding is consistent with our previous report that mTOR-dependent activation of p70 S6 kinase does not coincide with cellular sensitivity to rapamycin (37.Hosoi H. Dilling M.B. Liu L.N. Danks M.K. Shikata T. Sekulic A. Abraham R.T. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Houghton P.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 815-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Our studies also found similar levels of mTOR protein, drug uptake, and drug retention in rapamycin-sensitive and rapamycin-resistant cells. Intrinsic resistance appears to result partially from redundant signaling. For example, exogenous IGF-I completely prevents rapamycin-induced apoptosis and allows proliferation, although mTOR signaling is inhibited (33.Hosoi H. Dilling M.B. Shikata T. Liu L.N. Shu L. Ashmun R.A. Germain G.S. Abraham R.T. Houghton P.J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 886-894PubMed Google Scholar). Resistance to rapamycin may be acquired through mutations in FKBP-12, mTOR, or p70 S6 kinase. It remains unclear, however, whether rapamycin sensitivity (growth inhibition of tumor cells) requires the inhibition of both the p70 S6 kinase and eIF4E pathways or of only one of these pathways. To answer this question, we analyzed Rh30 rhabdomyosarcoma cells selected for resistance to rapamycin. We found resistance to be unstable and to be associated with decreased intracellular 4E-BP. We observed no alterations in mTOR signaling to p70 S6 kinase or in sensitivity to inhibition by rapamycin. As expected with dysregulation of eIF4E, rapamycin-resistant cells showed increased intracellular c-Myc and significantly enhanced anchorage-independent growth. Furthermore, overexpression of 4E-BP1 dramatically sensitized colon carcinoma cells that are intrinsically resistant to rapamycin. The rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines Rh30 and Rh18 (33.Hosoi H.

The human colon carcinoma cell lines CaCo2, HCT8, HCT29, and HCT116 were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The GC3 (38.Houghton P.J. Germain G.S. Hazelton B.J.

Rh30 human rhabdomyosarcoma cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 2 mml-glutamine (33.Hosoi H. Dilling M.B. Shikata T. Liu L.N. Shu L. Ashmun R.A. Germain G.S. Abraham R.T. Houghton P.J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 886-894PubMed Google Scholar); 300 ng/ml rapamycin was added. After 10 days, the entire monolayer was transferred to a single flask, and the rapamycin concentration was increased to 10,000 ng/ml. The cells adapted to this concentration without significant cell death and could be passaged in a 1:3 split ratio used for parental Rh30 cells. The cells were grown in 10,000 ng/ml rapamycin until colonies could be isolated. Clones were maintained in 10,000 ng/ml rapamycin until used in experiments. The rapamycin-resistant clones Rapa10K (rapamycin, 10,000 ng/ml) and C2 were selected for further study. Rh30 cells maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS were exposed to 400 μg/ml mutagen ethane methylsulfonate for 16 h, and medium was then replaced. Cells were allowed to proliferate for 5 days and were then harvested; 108 cells were transferred to each of 30 Costar ACCELL peel-top flasks. Two days later, 10,000 ng/ml rapamycin in fresh medium was added to each flask. After 15 days of incubation, colonies were visible; 48 colonies were isolated by using glass cloning rings, and each was transferred to a separate well of a 24-well cluster plate containing rapamycin-free medium. The next day, 5000 ng/ml rapamycin in fresh medium was added to each well. Ten days later, when clone C4 had formed a monolayer, it was transferred to a 25-cm2 flask containing 5000 ng/ml rapamycin and was subsequently maintained in this concentration of rapamycin. Cells (105/well) were plated in triplicate on 6-well culture plates. The next day, serial dilutions of rapamycin were added to the wells; cells were then incubated for 7 days. Cells were lysed under hypotonic conditions, as described previously, and nuclei were enumerated by using a Coulter counter (4.Dilling M.B. Dias P. Shapiro D.N. Germain G.S. Johnson R.K. Houghton P.J. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 903-990PubMed Google Scholar, 33.Hosoi H. Dilling M.B. Shikata T. Liu L.N. Shu L. Ashmun R.A. Germain G.S. Abraham R.T. Houghton P.J.

A solution of Bacto-Noble agar (1.2 g/100 ml; Difco) at 45 °C was added to an equal volume of 2× RPMI 1640 with 20% FBS at 37 °C to produce a 0.6% agar solution in 1× RPMI 1640 and 10% FBS. The mixture (1.5 ml) was added to each well of a six-well cluster plate (Falcon) and allowed to solidify at room temperature for ∼20 min. The top layer (for cell growth) was composed of 0.3% Bacto-Noble agar made by mixing equal volumes of 1.2% agar and sterile water, both at 45 °C, to produce a 0.6% agar solution and then mixing equal volumes of the 0.6% agar solution and 2× RPMI 1640 and 20% FBS at 37 °C to yield a 0.3% agar solution in 1× RPMI 1640 and 10% FBS. Cells were added to yield a final concentration of 3000 cells/ml. One ml of the cell-containing agar was layered over the base layer in each well and allowed to solidify for 20 min at room temperature. The plates were incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2. After 11–14 days, 0.5 ml of a solution of MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; Sigma) color reagent (0.5 mg/ml in sterile PBS) was added to each well, and cells were incubated overnight at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The next day, the stained colonies were counted, and their areas were measured by using an AlphaImager 2000 Documentation & Analysis System (Alpha Innotech Corporation, San Leandro, CA). Lysates were prepared as previously described (10.Brunn G.J. Hudson C.C. Sekulic A. Williams J.M. Hosoi H. Houghton P.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Abraham R.T. Science. 1997; 277: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar), separated by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted as described previously (37.Hosoi H. Dilling M.B. Liu L.N. Danks M.K. Shikata T.

Rabbit polyclonal antibody (11208, generously provided by Nahum Sonenberg, McGill University) was used to detect 4E-BP1. A different rabbit polyclonal antibody that recognizes a carboxyl-terminal epitope common to all 4E-BP isoforms was also used (Zymed Laboratories Inc. Laboratories, South San Francisco, CA). A monoclonal antibody (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) was used to detect eIF4E. A functional assay of 4E-BP1 was performed essentially as described by Gingras et al. (39.Gingras A.C. Kennedy S.G. O'Leary M.A. Sonenberg N. Hay N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 502-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). Cells were plated at a density of 3.0 × 106 cells/100-mm dish. The next day they were transferred to serum-free medium. After 24 h, the cells were stimulated with IGF-I (10 ng/ml; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) for 1 or 3 h in the presence or absence of 10 ng/ml rapamycin The cells were scraped into 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mmTris, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm EGTA, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm okadaic acid, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 mm benzamidine, and 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor). Lysis was accomplished by three freeze-thaw cycles. To bind eIF4E, 25 μl of 7-methyl-GTP-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) was added to the lysates, which were then incubated overnight on a rotator at 4 °C. The complexes were pelleted by centrifugation and washed three times with lysis buffer. To elute eIF4E from the Sepharose, 50 μl of SDS-PAGE loading buffer was added to the samples, which were then heated to 95 °C for 3 min. Samples were analyzed for 4E-BP and eIF4E by SDS-PAGE and Western blot with standard chemiluminescent methods, as described above. Assays were performed as described previously (37.Hosoi H. Dilling M.B. Liu L.N. Danks M.K. Shikata T. Sekulic A. Abraham R.T. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Houghton P.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 815-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 × 106 cells were seeded in 75-cm2 flasks and allowed to attach overnight. Initial experiments determined that exposure to rapamycin for 1 h resulted in maximal inhibition of p70 S6 kinase activity. Cells were exposed for 1 h to rapamycin (100 ng/ml), washed extensively, and lysed by gentle rocking at 4 °C in 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1 mmNaF) containing 10 μg/ml each aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin. Lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C to remove nuclei. Twenty microliters of a mixture of anti-p70 S6 kinase polyclonal antibody (2 μg; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and protein A-conjugated Sepharose beads were added to the supernatant; the mixture was kept on a rotator overnight at 4 °C. After centrifugation, the beads were washed twice with PBS and resuspended in 20 μl of p70 S6 kinase assay buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7, 25 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol). The S6 kinase assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions to assay p70 S6 kinase activity. Cells were plated in 2 ml of medium in six-well plates (Corning, NY) at a density of 5 × 105 cells/35-mm well. After overnight incubation at 37 °C and 5% CO2, medium was removed from adherent cells, and 2 ml of serum-free RPMI 1640 supplemented with 2 mml-glutamine was added to each well. After 24 h, the cells were stimulated by adding serum to a final concentration of 10% with or without rapamycin (100 ng/ml). Cells were further incubated for the appropriate time periods, washed with ice-cold PBS, and processed as described above for Western analysis with anti−c-Myc monoclonal antibody 1–9E10 (37.Hosoi H. Dilling M.B. Liu L.N. Danks M.K. Shikata T. Sekulic A. Abraham R.T. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Houghton P.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 815-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from Rh30 cells, the Rapa10K clone, and the Rapa10K/Rev clone (a revertant to rapamycin sensitivity) by using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). Briefly, 1.0 × 107 cells were washed with PBS, treated with trypsin, and pelleted by centrifugation at 300 × g for 5 min. The pellets were lysed and processed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Ten μg of total RNA from each sample was separated by electrophoresis on a denaturing agarose gel containing 0.66 m formaldehyde. The RNA was transferred to a nylon membrane (Gene Screen Plus, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) by capillary transfer in 10× SSC (1× SSC = 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015m sodium citrate) buffer. The samples were hybridized with a random-primed probe (RediPrime, Amersham Biosciences) synthesized from a 375-base pair NotI-ApaI fragment containing the coding sequence for the 4E-BP1 protein (provided generously by Robert T. Abraham, Duke University, NC). A probe to the human housekeeping gene encoding glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (CLONTECH) was synthesized and served as a control for RNA loading. Hybridization was conducted in ExpressHyb buffer (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The blots were washed at a final stringency of 0.5× SSC, 1% SDS at 65 °C, and autoradiograms were produced. Rh30 and Rapa10K cells were plated in 100-mm tissue culture dishes. When cells had reached 80–90% confluence, the culture medium was aspirated. The cells were washed twice with 10 ml of prewarmed (37 °C) pulse-labeling medium (Sigma), 5 ml of prewarmed pulse-labeling medium was added, and samples were incubated for 15 min in a humidified incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2) to deplete intracellular pools of methionine. Medium was aspirated, and 2 ml of prewarmed pulse-labeling medium containing [35S]methionine (0.2 mCi/ml; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added. Samples were incubated (37 °C, 5% CO2) for up to 4 h, washed twice with 10 ml of cold PBS, and lysed at 4 °C for 1 h in 1 ml of cell lysis buffer (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA) containing protease inhibitors. Lysates were transferred to 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes, disrupted by sonication, and centrifuged at 17,500 × g for 15 min. Protein A/G (20 μl; Santa Cruz) and normal rabbit or mouse IgG (2 μg; Santa Cruz) were added to the supernatants, and samples were rotated at 4 °C for 1 h. The complexes were pelleted at 12,500 × g for 5 min. Rabbit polyclonal anti-4E-BP antibody (20 μg; Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA) or mouse monoclonal anti-β-tubulin antibody (20 μg; Sigma) were added, and samples were rotated at 4 °C overnight. Protein A/G-conjugated beads (30 μl) were added, and samples were rotated for 3 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation, the beads were washed twice with 500 μl of cold lysis buffer and twice with 500 μl of cold PBS. The pellets were resuspended in 20 μl of SDS sample buffer and separated in a 12% Bio-Rad Ready Gel. The gel was dried at 80 °C for 1 h, and the radiolabeled products were quantified by scanning of the resulting autoradiograms. HCT-8 cells were plated at a density of 3 × 106 cells per Nunc T75 peel-top flask (Nalge Nunc International, Rochester, NY) and transfected for 18 h under serum-free conditions in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The 4E-BP1 construct of interest, pcDNA3-PHAS-I (a gift from Robert T. Abraham), was transfected at a concentration of 10 μg/75-cm2 flask. Cells were then washed with Hanks' solution and fed with RPMI 1640 containing 10% dialyzed FBS and 2 mml-glutamine. After 48 h, fresh medium containing 500 μg/ml G418 was added. Surviving colonies were allowed to grow for 2 weeks and were then ring-cloned and placed in 12.5-cm2 flasks in 2 ml of medium containing 10% dialyzed FBS, 2 mml-glutamine, and 500 μg/ml G418. Ten colonies were selected for further evaluation. Cultured cells at a logarithmic phase of growth were briefly washed with cold PBS, and samples containing 1.5 × 106 cells were lysed on ice in 75 μl of lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 tablet of protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Complete™ Mini). Cells were frozen in liquid N2 for 5 min and thawed at 37 °C for 5 min three times and centrifuged at 17,500 rpm ×g for 10 min at 4 °C; supernatants were then transferred to a fresh tube, and 25 μl of NuPAGE 4× lithium dodecyl sulfate sample buffer (Invitrogen) was added. Samples were heated for 10 min at 70 °C before centrifugation at 17,500 rpm × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Proteins were separated on a 12% bis-Tris-polyacrylamide gel (Invitrogen) and transferred to Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Membranes were incubated first with rabbit polyclonal anti−4E-BP1, (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) and then with goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Pierce). Immunoreactive bands were visualized by using Pierce SuperSignal® chemiluminescence substrate (Pierce) and Kodak BiomaxTM MR film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Cultured cells were plated in triplicate (3000 cells/35-mm dish) in 6-well Falcon culture plates (BD PharMingen). After 24 h, the medium was aspirated from the adherent cells, and 2 ml of RPMI 1640 containing 10% FBS, 2 mml-glutamine, and rapamycin (serial dilutions, 0–10,000 ng/ml) was added to each well. After 7 days, cells were washed with 0.9% saline solution and stained with 0.1% crystal violet. Colonies were enumerated by using an AlphaImager 2000™ (Alpha Innotech Corp.). The alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma cell line Rh30 is exquisitely sensitive to rapamycin (4.Dilling M.B. Dias P. Shapiro D.N. Germain G.S. Johnson R.K. Houghton P.J.

Cells were grown in increasing concentrations of rapamycin to obtain lines that proliferated in the presence of 5000 or 10,000 ng/ml rapamycin (IC50 ∼ 10,000- to 20,000-fold greater than that of the parental lines).

EKLF/KLF-1 is a 358-amino acid nuclear protein with an amino-terminal proline-rich domain and a carboxyl-terminal DNA binding domain. The nuclear localization signal (NLS) of EKLF/KLF-1 has not been empirically determined. We generated a series of epitope-tagged deletion and point mutants and assessed their subcellular localization. Our results delimit the NLS to the 83-amino acid (amino acids 276–358) DNA binding domain that consists of three Kruppel zinc fingers. All three zinc fingers are necessary for efficient nuclear localization; deletion of any individual finger results in cytoplasmic accumulation. Fusion of the three zinc fingers to green fluorescent protein (GFP) targeted GFP to the nucleus, demonstrating that the zinc finger domain is sufficient for nuclear localization. EKLF/KLF-1 containing histidine to alanine mutations that disrupt the structure of all three fingers retains appropriate nuclear localization, indicating that neither the tertiary structure of the zinc fingers nor specific DNA binding are necessary for nuclear localization. We demonstrate that basic residues within the fingers are the critical determinants for nuclear localization; mutations of these basic residues to alanine resulted in cytoplasmic mislocalization. The basic residues of all mammalian Kruppel zinc fingers are highly conserved; therefore we propose that these basic residues are a common NLS shared by all Kruppel family members.

Individual members function as transcriptional activators, repressors, or both and exert a wide range of molecular effects in cellular proliferation, differentiation, and malignancy. Gene knockout studies of several members have defined crucial roles in embryonic (Sp1, KLF1, KLF2) and post-natal (Sp4, KLF4) development (reviewed in Refs. 1Bieker J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34355-34358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar and 3Philipsen S. Suske G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2991-3000Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). The family is defined by a highly homologous DNA binding domain (DBD)1 situated at or very close to the carboxyl terminus. The DBD consists of three C2H2-type zinc fingers that are similar to the Drosophila Kruppel protein. A second similarity shared by the family members is a characteristic amino acid (aa) sequence designated the Kruppel-link that connects individual zinc fingers (4Turner J. Crossley M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 236-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The members display no other significant homology in any other part of the protein. EKLF/KLF1 was one of the founding members of this family (reviewed in Ref. 5Perkins A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 1175-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This erythroid-specific transcription factor binds the β-globin promoter and activates high level expression. The β-globin promoter is a 358-aa nuclear protein consisting of an amino-terminal proline-rich transactivation domain (aa 1–275) and a carboxyl-terminal DBD (aa 276–358). The DBD, consisting of three C2H2 Kruppel-like zinc fingers, binds specifically to the CCACACCCT motif at −90 of the β-globin promoter. Gene ablation studies have demonstrated a critical role for EKLF/KLF1 in consolidating the switch between the fetal γ- to the adult β-globin gene expression; EKLF/KLF1−/− embryos display drastically reduced β-globin gene expression and die at E15.5 due to severe lethal anemia (6Nuez B. Michalovich D. Bygrave A. Ploemacher R. Grosveld F. Nature. 1995; 375: 316-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 7Perkins A.C. Sharpe A.H. Orkin S.H. Nature. 1995; 375: 318-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). EKLF/KLF1 is also thought to exert important functions at the β-globin locus control region and other as yet undetermined erythroid target genes whose expression is necessary for survival (8Guy L.G. Delvoye N. Wall L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3675-3680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 9Perkins A.C. Peterson K.R. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Witkowska H.E. Orkin S.H. Blood. 2000; 95: 1827-1833Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although a large amount of information suggests a crucial role for EKLF/KLF1 in globin gene expression and adult hematopoiesis, the molecular mechanisms underlying its functions are not clearly understood. Several studies focus on a structure-function analysis of EKLF/KLF1 to yield insights into its functions (10Brown R.C. Pattison S. van Ree J. Coghill E. Perkins A. Jane S.M. Cunningham J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 11Chen X. Bieker J.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5888-5896Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 12Pandya K. Donze D. Townes T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8239-8243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). These studies identify discrete domains involved in transactivation (aa 1–104 and 140–225), chromatin remodeling (aa 225–358), and inhibition of DNA binding (aa 176–271). However, despite all this information, the sequences necessary for its nuclear localization are unknown. Studies conducted on a closely related family member GKLF/KLF4 have led to the proposal that the nuclear localization signal (NLS) of EKLF/KLF1 localizes to a 12-aa basic stretch at position 260 (13Shields J.M. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18504-18507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar); however, this has not been experimentally confirmed. In this report we have identified and characterized the NLS of EKLF. The NLS localizes to the zinc finger DBD and is both necessary and sufficient for nuclear localization. We also demonstrate that the basic residues within this region are the critical determinants for nuclear localization. Comparison of the zinc finger sequences among the Kruppel family members indicate that the basic residues are almost perfectly conserved among them, suggesting that these residues could be part of an NLS common to all Kruppel members. The plasmids HA-EKLF, HA-Δ4–254, HA-Δ255–358, and HA-Δ139–225 have been described previously (12Pandya K. Donze D. Townes T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8239-8243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Unless noted otherwise, the plasmid HA-EKLF was used as the parental plasmid for the generation of all mutants. Restriction enzymesSmaI, MslI, BsaI, BspMI, and PflFI cut at positions corresponding to codons 256, 276, 277, 298, and 333, respectively. Plasmid HA-Δ276–358 was generated by ligating two fragments, a 0.8-kbEcoRI-MslI fragment and a 4.2-kbEcoRI-BamHI fragment (the BamHI end was blunted with Klenow). The plasmid HA-Δ256–276 was generated in two steps. First, an intermediate plasmid was generated by ligating two fragments, a 4.8-kb SmaI-PflFI fragment (from HA-Δ139–225) and a 170-bp BsaI-PflFI fragment. A 330-bp MscI-BamHI fragment from this plasmid was then ligated with a 5.1-kb MscI-BamHI fragment from HA-EKLF. HA-ΔZF1 was generated by ligating two fragments, a 0.9-kbEcoRI-MslI fragment and a 4.2-kbEcoRI-BspMI fragment (the BspMI end was blunted with mung bean nuclease). HA-ΔZF2 was generated by digesting the HA-EKLF plasmid with BspMI andPflFI. The BspMI end was blunted with Klenow, and the PflFI end was blunted with mung bean nuclease. The 5.1-kb BspMI(blunt)-PflFI(blunt) fragment was gel-purified and self-ligated. Plasmid HA-ΔZF3 was generated by digesting the HA-EKLF plasmid with PflFI andBamHI.

The BspMI and BamHI ends were blunted with Klenow, and the 5.1-kbBspMI(blunt)-BamHI(blunt) fragment was gel-purified and self-ligated. Plasmid HA-ΔZF1,3 was generated by digesting plasmid HA-ΔZF1 with PflFI and BamHI. The PflFI and BamHI ends were blunted with Klenow. The 5.1-kb PflFI(blunt)-BamHI(blunt) fragment was gel-purified and self-ligated. The HA-H295A,H325A,H353A plasmid was generated in several steps. First, plasmid HA-H295A was generated using PCR-based mutagenesis utilizing the following primers: upstream, 5′-GGTGGCCCAGGGTTGGTGACT-3′; downstream, 5′-CGTGTGCGTGCGCAGGGCCGCCTTGAG-3′. The mutant codon changing histidine to alanine is underlined. The PCR product was digested with SacII and FspI and used to replace the corresponding wild type fragment in HA-EKLF. The HA-H353A and HA-H325A plasmids were generated by oligomer-based mutagenesis. HA-H353A was generated by ligating a double stranded oligomer withBsgI ends (top, 5′-CTGACCACTTAGCTCTGGCCATGAAGCGTC-3′; bottom, 5′-CGCTTCATGGCCAGAGCTAAGTGGTCAGAG-3′) with a 5.2-kbBsgI fragment. The mutant codon changing histidine to alanine is underlined. The HA-H325 plasmid was generated by ligating a double-stranded oligomer with BpmI and PflFI ends (top, 5′-GAACTGACGCGCGCCTACCGGAAGCACACTGGACA-3′; bottom, 5′-ATGTCCAGTGTGCTTCCGGTAGGCGCGCGTCAGTTCGT-3′) with a 240-bpMscI-BpmI fragment and a 4.9-kbMscI-PflFI fragment. The mutant codon changing histidine to alanine is underlined. Plasmid HA-H295A,H325A was generated by ligating three fragments, a 0.9-kbEcoRI-FspI fragment (from HA-H295A plasmid), a 0.3-kb FspI-XbaI fragment (from HA-H325A plasmid), and a 4.2-kb EcoRI-XbaI fragment. Finally, a 1.0-kb EcoRI-PflFI fragment (from HA-H295A,H325A plasmid) was ligated with a 4.2-kbEcoRI-PflFI fragment (from HA-H353A) to generate HA-H295A,H325A,H353A. Plasmid HA-Δ256–276,H295A,H325A,H353A was generated by ligating two fragments, a 0.3-kbSapI-BamHI fragment (from HA-H295A,H325A,H353A) and a 4.9-kb SapI-BamHI fragment from HA-Δ256–276. Oligomer-based mutagenesis was used to generate HA-EKLF(mZF1), HA-EKLF(mZf2), HA-EKLF(mZF3), HA-EKLF(mZF1,2), HA-EKLF(mZF2,3), HA-EKLF (mZF1,3), HA-EKLF(mZF1,2,3) plasmids. A double-stranded oligomer with SapI and BspMI ends (top, 5′-GCG GGGCGAGCTACTCCGCGAGCTCGCACCTCGCGGCGCACCTGGCCAC-3′; bottom, 5′-GTGCGTGGCCAGGTGCGCCGCGAGGTGCGAGCTCGCGGAGTAGCTCGCCC-3′) was ligated with a 5.2-kb SapI-BspMI fragment to generate HA-EKLF(mZF1). Plasmid HA-EKLF(mZf2) was generated by first mixing four oligomers (top 1, 5′-GCACACGGGAGAGGCGCCTTATGCCTGCTCCTGGGACGGCTGTGACTGGGCGTTCGCTGCCTCAGA-3′; top 2, 5′-CGAACTGACGGCCCACTACGCGGCGCACACTGGACA-3′; bottom 1, 5′-ATGTCCAGTGTGCGCCGCGTAGTGGGCCGTCAGTTCGTCTGAGGCAGCGAACGCCCAGTCACAGCCGT-3′; bottom 2, 5′-CCCAGGAGCAGGCATAAGGCGCCTCTCCCGT-3′) in a 1:1 molar ratio to generate a 95-bp fragment with BspMI andPflFI ends. This fragment was ligated with a 5.2-kbBspMI-PflFI fragment. Plasmid HA-EKLF(mZF3) was generated by a double-stranded oligomer with PflFI andBsgI ends (top, 5′-TGCTCCCTTCTGCTGTGGCCTCTGCCCAGCTGCTTTTTCAGCCTCTGACCACTTAGCTCTGCACATGGCGGCTC-3′; bottom, 5′-GCCGCCATGTGCAGAGCTAAGTGGTCAGAGGCTGAAAAAGCAGCTGGGCAGAGGCCACAGCAGAAGGGAGC-3′) to a 5.2-kb PflFI-BsgI fragment. Plasmid HA-EKLF(mZF1,2) was generated by ligating the oligomers used for HA-EKLF(mZF1) with a 5.2-kb SapI-BspMI fragment from HA-EKLF(mZF2). Plasmid HA-EKLF(mZF2,3) was generated by ligating the oligomers used for HA-EKLF(mZF3) with a 5.2-kbPflFI-BsgI fragment from HA-EKLF(mZF2).

Plasmid HA-EKLF(mZF1,2,3) was generated as follows. Seven overlapping oligomers (top 1, 5′-GCGGGGCGAGCTACTCCGCGAGCTCGCACCTCGCGGCGCACCTGGCCACGCACACGGGAGAGGCGCCTTATGCCT-3′; top 2, 5′-GCTCCTGGGACGGCTGTGACTGGGCGTTCGCTGCCTCAGACGAACTGACGGCCCACTACGCGGCGCACACTGGA-3′; top 3, 5′-CATGCTCCCTTCTGCTGTGGCCTCTGCCCAGCTGCTTTTTCAGCCTCTGACCACTTAGCTCTGCACATGGCGGCTC-3′; bottom 1, 5′-GCCGCCATGTGCAGAGCTAAGTGGTCAGAGGCTG-3′; bottom 2, 5′-AAAAAGCAGCTGGGCAGAGGCCACAGCAGAAGGGAGCATGTCCAGTGTGCGCCGCGTAGTGGGCCGTCAGTTCGT-3′; bottom 3, 5′-CTGAGGCAGCGAACGCCCAGTCACAGCCGTCCCAGGAGCAGGCATAAGGCGCCTCTCCCGTGTGCGTGGCCAGGT-3′; bottom 4, 5′-GCGCCGCGAGGTGCGAGCTCGCGGAGTAGCTCGCCC-3′) were mixed in a 1:1 molar ratio to give a 220-bp fragment withSapI and BsgI ends. This fragment was gel-purified and ligated to a 5.0-kb SapI-BsgI fragment. The mutant codons changing histidine to alanine are underlined. Plasmids GFP/ZF1,2,3 and GFP/(mZF1,2,3) were generated by subcloning a 0.3-kb MslI-BamHI fragment from either HA-EKLF (for GFP/ZF1,2,3) or HA-EKLF(mZF1,2,3) (for GFP/(mZF1,2,3)) into plasmid pEGFP-C2 digested with SalI (blunted with Klenow) and BamHI. Plasmid GFP/NES/NLS (NES, nuclear export signal) was generated by subcloning a double-stranded oligomers withEcoRI and BamHI ends (top, 5′-AATTGCCACCATTGGAGCGATTGACATTGGCAGGCGCAGGCCCGAAAAAGAAACGCAAAGTA-3′; bottom, 5′-GATCTACTTTGCGTTTCTTTTTCGGGCCTGCGCCTGCCAATGACAATCGCTCCAATGGTGGC-3′) into plasmid pEGP-C2 digested with EcoRI andBamHI. The sequence encoding the human immunodeficiency virus Rev NES is shown in bold and represents the peptide LPPLERLTL, whereas the sequence encoding the NLS is designated in italics and represents the NLS peptide PKKKTKV from SV40 large T antigen protein. All plasmids were verified by sequencing. Nuclear fractionation was performed as described in Greenwood and Johnson (14Greenwood J.A. Johnson G.V. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 220: 332-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Briefly, 48 h after transfection, COS cells were washed and harvested in phosphate-buffered saline. The cell pellet was lysed two times in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mmMgCl2, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EGTA). The nuclei were isolated by spinning at 0.35 relative centrifugal force for 5 min and washed two times with wash buffer (300 mm sucrose, 10 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 25 mm NaCl). The nuclei were then purified over a sucrose cushion (1 m sucrose in wash buffer) and resuspended in Buffer B (wash buffer with 0.5% Triton X-100). The tubes were then incubated briefly on ice and spun at 1.2 relative centrifugal force for 5 min. The supernatant yielded the nucleosol fraction. The pellet was resuspended in SDS sample buffer and yielded the chromatin fraction. COS and K562 cell transfection, Western blot analyses, indirect immunofluorescence, and transactivation analyses were conducted as described previously (12Pandya K. Donze D. Townes T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8239-8243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Whole cell extracts were prepared by lysing cells in radioimmune precipitation buffer. Anti-tubulin antibodies (catalog #T5168) and leptomycin B (catalog #L2913) were purchased from Sigma, anti-histone antibodies were purchased from Chemicon (catalog #MAB052), and GFP plasmid (pEGFP-C2) was purchased from CLONTECH. We used our previously established assay to define the sequences necessary for nuclear localization of EKLF/KLF1 (12Pandya K. Donze D. Townes T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8239-8243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In this assay, HA epitope-tagged EKLF/KLF1 (wild type or mutant) constructs were transfected into COS cells, and HA-EKLF/KLF1 proteins were detected by indirect immunofluorescence with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-HA antibody (Fig. 1C, shown in green). Propidium iodide staining (red) was utilized to define the nucleus, and a two-color merge was used to assess subcellular localization. As shown in Fig. 1C, the wild type EKLF/KLF1 protein (HA-EKLF) localized exclusively to the nucleus (panels D–F) in more than 99% of transfected cells (Table I). Cells transfected with vector alone show very little background (Fig. 1C, panels A–C).Table ISubcellular distribution of mutant EKLFsConstruct% N% N>C% C=NHA-EKLF99 ± 11 ± 10HA-Δ4–25496 ± 2.63.6 ± 2.50.3 ± 0.5HA-Δ255–35801 ± 199 ± 1HA-Δ256–27697 ± 22.6 ± 20.3 ± 0.5HA-Δ276–35800.33 ± 0.599 ± 0.5HA-ΔZF114.3 ± 785.3 ± 70.3 ± 0.5HA-ΔZF26.3 ± 5.593.6 ± 5.50HA-ΔZF34 ± 396 ± 30HA-ΔZF1,21 ± 117.6 ± 8.681.3 ± 9.3HA-ΔZF2,31 ± 1.78.6 ± 2.590 ± 4HA-ΔZF1,30.66 ± 0.57 ± 4.692.3 ± 5HA-EKLF(mZF1)96.6 ± 2.53.3 ± 2.50HA-EKLF(mZF2)23.6 ± 575.6 ± 6.10.6 ± 1.1HA-EKLF(mZF3)20.6 ± 6.579 ± 6.50.3 ± 0.5HA-EKLF(mZF1,2)3 ± 268 ± 10.129 ± 8.1HA-EKLF(mZF2,3)5.6 ± 3.592.6 ± 4.51.3 ± 1.5HA-EKLF(mZF1,3)3.6 ± 1.596.3 ± 1.50HA-EKLF(mZF1,2,3)07.6 ± 8.392.3 ± 8.3HA-H295A,H325A,H353A99 ± 10.3 ± 0.50.6 ± 0.5HA-Δ256–276,HA–H295A,H325A,H353A95.3 ± 44.3 ± 3.50.3 ± 0.5 Open table in a new tab We had previously demonstrated that all signals necessary for nuclear localization are contained within a carboxyl-terminal region (aa 255–358) (12Pandya K. Donze D. Townes T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8239-8243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). A mutant (HA-Δ255–358, Fig. 1A) with this region deleted is located in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1C,panels J–L), whereas a mutant (HA-Δ4–255, Fig.1A) containing only this sequence is localized to the nucleus (Fig. 1C, panels G–I). This region consists of the DBD (aa 275–358) and a putative basic NLS-like sequence PKRSRRTLAPKR at position aa 260. This basic sequence has been proposed to be the NLS for EKLF/KLF1 because it is highly homologous to the NLS of the closely related family member GKLF/KLF4 (13Shields J.M. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18504-18507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we deleted a 20-aa region encompassing this sequence (HA-Δ256–276, Fig. 1A). Interestingly, when this mutant was tested for subcellular localization, the protein was found exclusively in the nucleus (Fig. 1C, panels M–O), indicating that this sequence is dispensable for nuclear localization. However, a mutant with the DBD deleted (HA-Δ276–358, Fig. 1A) was found to accumulate in the cytoplasm (Fig.1C, panels P–R). These results indicate that the DBD (aa 275–358) is necessary for nuclear localization. We next carried out experiments to further delimit the NLS within the DBD. This domain consists of three Kruppel zinc finger motifs that are highly homologous to each other. We evaluated the contribution of each zinc finger motif to nuclear localization. A series of mutants were generated that deleted any one or any two zinc fingers. Fig. 2A illustrates a schematic of these deletions. Western blot analysis conducted on cell extracts transfected with these mutants indicated that the mutants were expressed at wild type levels (Fig. 2B). Results from indirect immunofluorescence show that deletion of any one zinc finger leads to partial mislocalization of the protein (Table I and Fig.2C, panels D–F, for representative staining). Deletion of any two zinc fingers results in diffuse staining throughout the cell (Table I and Fig. 2C, panels G–I, for representative staining). These experiments indicate that all three zinc fingers are necessary for efficient nuclear localization of EKLF/KLF1. We next determined if the three zinc fingers were sufficient for nuclear localization. The three zinc fingers were fused to GFP (GFP/ZF1,2,3, see Fig. 6A) and examined for subcellular distribution. GFP alone is found in the cytoplasm and gives rise to diffuse staining throughout the cell (Fig. 6B,panel A). As shown in Fig. 6B (panel B) the three zinc fingers targeted GFP predominantly to the nucleus. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the three zinc fingers of EKLF/KLF1 encode an NLS that is both necessary and sufficient for nuclear localization.Figure 6The three zinc fingers are sufficient for nuclear localization. A, schematic of different constructs. The GFP/ZF1,2,3 construct is a fusion of the three zinc fingers to GFP. GFP/mZF1,2,3 is the same as GFP/ZF1,2,3 except that all basic residues within the zinc fingers are mutated to alanine (each change is denoted by an asterisk). The subcellular localization category of each mutant is summarized on theright. C, subcellular localization of the different constructs. COS cells were transfected with the indicated constructs, and direct immunofluorescence was conducted as described in Fig. 5. Representative cells from each construct are shown. The subcellular localization of each mutant is summarized on theright. One hundred cells/transfection were analyzed in three experiments, and more than 80% of them showed the representative staining.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The NLS of several zinc finger-containing proteins are localized to their zinc fingers (15Bruening W.

Chem. 2002; 277: 11606-11613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and the tertiary zinc finger structure is crucial for nuclear targeting activity for some of them (16Matheny C. Day M.L. Milbrandt J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8176-8181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Yang M. May W.S. Ito T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27399-27406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To determine whether zinc finger structure is essential for EKLF nuclear localization, we generated histidine to alanine point mutations in the first zinc-chelating histidine of all three zinc fingers (HA-H295A,H325A,H353A, Fig.3A). These mutations have been shown previously to destabilize zinc finger tertiary structure (18Yang M. May W.S. Ito T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27399-27406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar,21Coleman J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 897-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). The mutant protein was expressed at wild type level (Fig.3B). When tested for subcellular distribution, the results demonstrate that the mutant protein was localized exclusively to the nucleus (Fig. 3C, panels D–F). To verify that the mutations did destabilize the zinc finger structure, we tested the transactivation capacity of this mutant in a transient transactivation assay. The histidine to alanine mutations should inhibit the formation of a stable zinc finger structure and, thus, prevent the protein from binding and activating the β-globin promoter. Although wild type EKLF/KLF1 activated the β-promoter 500-fold relative to controls, the mutant failed to transactivate the β-globin promoter (Fig. 3D). This result confirms that the histidine mutations destabilized zinc finger structure and suggests that the NLS is independent of zinc finger tertiary structure and sequence-specific DNA binding. Alternatively, the nuclear accumulation of this mutant could result from a redundant nuclear-targeting activity encoded by the NLS-like sequence at position aa 260. To test this possibility, we constructed a mutant that deleted the putative NLS-like sequence (aa 256–276), whereas retaining the three histidine point mutations (HA-Δ256–276,H295A,H325A,H353A, Fig.3A). When tested for subcellular distribution, our results demonstrate that this mutant protein is localized exclusively to the nucleus (Fig. 3C, panels G–I). These data exclude a role for this sequence (aa 256–276) in nuclear localization. All of these data indicate that the NLS encoded by the three zinc fingers is independent of its tertiary structure and sequence-specific DNA binding. The nuclear localization signals of many transcription factors are localized to the DBD, and LaCasse and Lefebvre (22LaCasse E.C. Lefebvre Y.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1647-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) propose that nuclear localization is a result of nonspecific binding to DNA (for review, see Ref. 22LaCasse E.C. Lefebvre Y.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1647-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). These investigators suggested that sequence-independent protein-DNA associations result in selective retention and accumulation of transcription factors in the nucleus. If this hypothesis is true for EKLF/KLF1, one would predict that both wild type and zinc finger mutant (HA-H295A,H325A,H353A) proteins, which are observed in the nucleus, would be associated with chromatin. To test this prediction, we performed a biochemical fractionation assay to assess the sub-nuclear localization of these proteins. Cells were transfected with constructs encoding wild type or mutant EKLF; nuclei were then purified and fractionated into nucleosol and chromatin fractions. Fig. 3E illustrates these fractions after electrophoresis on a SDS-PAGE gel and staining with Coomassie Blue. The purity of different fractions was confirmed by conducting Western blot analysis using chromatin (histone) and cytosolic (tubulin) markers. As shown in the Fig. 3E, histone proteins were present only in the chromatin fractions, and tubulin was absent from both chromatin and nucleosolic fractions. When the chromatin and nucleosolic fractions were tested for EKLF/KLF1 proteins, the results demonstrated that both wild type and mutant proteins were associated exclusively with the chromatin fraction (Fig. 3E, bottom panel). These results suggest that protein-DNA associations are important for nuclear accumulation. Biophysical studies of zinc finger proteins have demonstrated that nonspecific protein-DNA interactions are retained in the absence of tertiary zinc finger structures (23Nedved M.L. Moe G.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4705-4711Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Our observations that tertiary zinc finger structures are dispensable for EKLF/KLF1 nuclear localization are consistent with these studies. All of these data suggest that the zinc finger region may function as an NLS due to nonspecific associations with DNA. Structural and biophysical studies of DNA-protein interactions show that nonspecific interactions with DNA are predominantly mediated through basic residues, which interact with the negatively charged phosphodiester backbone of DNA (24deHaseth P.L. Lohman T.M. Record Jr., M.T. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 4783-4790Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 25Elrod-Erickson M. Rould M.A. Nekludova L. Pabo C.O.

The primary amino acid sequence of EKLF/KLF1 zinc fingers contains a total of 15 basic residues; four, six, and five basic residues are present in the first, second, and third zinc fingers, respectively (Fig.4A). We directly assessed the roles of these basic residues for nuclear localization. All basic residues in any one, any two, or all three zinc fingers were mutated to alanine. Fig. 4A indicates the zinc finger amino acid sequences of these mutant proteins. Western blot analysis demonstrated that all mutants were expressed at wild type levels (Fig.4B). The results of the subcellular localization assay of these mutants are summarized in Fig. 4A and Table I. Interestingly, mutations of basic residues in zinc finger 2 or zinc finger 3 resulted in a partial mislocalization of the protein to the cytoplasm (HA-EKLF(mZF2), HA-EKLF(mZF3), Fig. 4C,panels D–F; Table I). Importantly, the mutation of all 15 basic residues contained within the three zinc fingers resulted in a protein that is predominantly localized to the cytoplasm (HA-EKLF(mZF1,2,3), Fig. 4C, panels G–I). These results indicate that the basic residues within the DBD play an important role in nuclear localization. We next tested whether cytoplasmic accumulation of HA-EKLF(mZF1,2,3) results from a cryptic NES that is exposed as a consequence of the mutations. Cells transfected with the mutant were treated with the nuclear export pathway inhibitor leptomycin B (LMB). This compound binds and inhibits the function of Crm1 protein, a critical mediator of nuclear export pathways (28Nishi K. Yoshida M. Fujiwara D. Nishikawa M. Horinouchi S. Beppu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6320-6324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Ullman K.S. Powers M.A. Forbes D.J. Cell. 1997; 90: 967-970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Interestingly, LMB treatment had no effect on the cytoplasmic accumulation of this mutant protein (Fig.5, panels A and B). This result suggests that cytoplasmic accumulation of the mutant protein results from NLS disruption and not from exposure of a cryptic NES. As a positive control for LMB activity, we generated a construct GFP/NES/NLS that fuses GFP with a NES (LPPLERLTL) from human immunodeficiency virus-Rev protein and a NLS (PKKKRKV) from SV40 large T antigen. GFP/NES/NLS shuttles continuously into and out of the nucleus, resulting in diffuse staining throughout the cell (Fig. 5,panel C). As expected, LMB treatment of these cells resulted in the nuclear accumulation of GFP/NLS/NES (Fig. 5, panel D). Finally, all 15 basic residues within the three zinc fingers of the nuclear protein GFP/ZF1,2,3 were mutated to alanine (Fig.6A). When a construct encoding this mutant protein was transfected into cells, GFP/mZF1,2,3 distributed diffusely throughout the cell (Fig. 6B,panel C). This result further demonstrates that these basic residues are directly involved in nuclear localization of EKLF/KLF1. This report demonstrates that the NLS of EKLF/KLF1 is contained specifically within the three Kruppel zinc fingers. Deletion of the three zinc fingers results in a protein that is localized to the cytoplasm (HA-Δ276–258, Fig. 1C, panels P–R). All three zinc fingers are necessary for efficient nuclear localization; deletion of any one finger results in partial loss of nuclear targeting (Fig. 2A, HA-ΔZF1, HA-ΔZF2, HA-ΔZF3), whereas deletion of any two zinc fingers resulted in predominant cytoplasmic accumulation (Fig. 2A, HA-ΔZF1,2, HA-ΔZF2,3, HA-ΔZF1,3). The three fingers were sufficient to direct a heterologous protein to the nucleus (Fig. 6B, compare GFP/ZF1,2,3 with GFP). The ability of the zinc fingers to target EKLF/KLF1 to the nucleus is independent of finger tertiary structure and sequence-specific DNA binding; histidine to alanine mutations in the zinc fingers resulted in appropriate nuclear localization (Fig.3C, HA-H295A,H325A,H353A). Our results also demonstrate that the putative NLS-like sequence at position aa 260 does not play a critical role in nuclear targeting; EKLF/KLF1 proteins lacking this sequence are faithfully localized to the nucleus (Fig. 1C, HA-Δ 256–276, panels M–O; Fig. 3C,panels G–I). The NLS of several zinc finger proteins (Zif268, neuron restrictive silencer factor (NRSF), Wilms' tumor 1 (Wt1), JAZ, mouse orphan receptor (TR2), tristetraprolin (TTP), and EGF-response factor 1 (CMG1)) are localized to their zinc finger regions (15Bruening W. Moffett P. Chia S. Heinrich G. Pelletier J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 393: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 16Matheny C. Day M.L. Milbrandt J. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 11606-11613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). However, these proteins appear to have different sequence requirements for nuclear localization. For example, the NLS of Wt1 was delimited to the first (of four) zinc fingers, whereas the second (of two) zinc fingers of TR2 was sufficient for nuclear localization (15Bruening W. Moffett P. Chia S. Heinrich G. Pelletier J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 393: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 19Yu Z. Lee C.H. Chinpaisal C. Wei L.N. J. Endocrinol. 1998; 159: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). By contrast, all three zinc fingers are necessary for efficient nuclear localization of EKLF/KLF1. Results obtained for Zif268 and JAZ demonstrated that mutations which disrupt the tertiary structure of zinc fingers also abrogated nuclear localization (16Matheny C. Day M.L. Milbrandt J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8176-8181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Yang M. May W.S. Ito T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27399-27406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar); disruption of any one of the three zinc fingers of Zif268 resulted in cytoplasmic mislocalization. In contrast, the tertiary structures of all three zinc fingers in EKLF/KLF1 were dispensable for nuclear localization. In this respect, EKLF/KLF1 is similar to NRSF, TTP, and CMG1; the NLS of these proteins was also independent of zinc finger tertiary structure (17Shimojo M. Lee J.H. Hersh L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13121-13126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 20Phillips R.S. Ramos S. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11606-11613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Our results also demonstrate that the basic residues within the zinc fingers are a critical determinant for nuclear localization. Mutations of these residues in the three fingers resulted in predominant accumulation in the cytoplasm. This localization was not due to exposure of a cryptic NES, because treatment with the nuclear export inhibitor LMB had no effect on the cytoplasmic accumulation of this mutant. Our results also demonstrate that the basic residues are directly involved in nuclear localization; mutations in basic residues of GFP/ZF1,2,3 resulted in cytoplasmic accumulation.. Basic residues within the zinc fingers could function in several ways to affect nuclear localization. DNA and RNA binding domains are thought to function as nuclear retention signals based on their ability to bind DNA (22LaCasse E.C. Lefebvre Y.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1647-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). This is consistent with a survey showing that the NLS of ∼70% of nucleic acid-binding proteins are coincident with the nucleic-acid binding domain (22LaCasse E.C. Lefebvre Y.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1647-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Biophysical studies demonstrate that electrostatic interactions between positively charged basic residues and the negatively charged phosphate DNA backbone are the predominant mediators of nucleic acid binding (24deHaseth P.L. Lohman T.M. Record Jr., M.T. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 4783-4790Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 25Elrod-Erickson M. Rould M.A. Nekludova L. Pabo C.O. Structure (Lond.). 1996; 4: 1171-1180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 26Revzin A. von Hippel P.H. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 4769-4776Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 27Spolar R.S. Record Jr., M.T. Science. 1994; 263: 777-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (1371) Google Scholar). Therefore, the basic residues of EKLF/KLF1 could mediate nonspecific interactions with DNA, leading to nuclear accumulation. Binding studies demonstrate that the nonspecific associations with DNA are independent of tertiary structure, at least for zinc finger domains (23Nedved M.L. Moe G.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4705-4711Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). This is also consistent with our results demonstrating that the tertiary zinc finger structure is dispensable for nuclear localization and chromatin co-localization of EKLF/KLF1. Alternatively, the basic residues within the zinc fingers might be necessary for interacting with other chromatin-associated proteins and thus co-localize to chromatin. Indeed, the zinc fingers of EKLF/KLF1 can associate with components of SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex in vitro (30Kadam S. McAlpine G.S. Phelan M.L. Kingston R.E. Jones K.A. Emerson B.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2441-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). However, this possibility is not likely because protein-protein interactions mediated by zinc fingers require tertiary zinc finger structure, and our results demonstrate that finger tertiary structure is dispensable for nuclear localization. There is a formal possibility that the zinc finger basic residues constitute an unusually long basic-type NLS. However, most basic-type NLSs consist of a short stretch (4–6 aa) of basic residues (classical) or two smaller clusters (∼4 aa) separated by 6–10 residues (bipartite) (31Christophe D. Christophe-Hobertus C. Pichon B. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 337-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The 15 basic residues of EKLF/KLF1 are dispersed over a relatively large region (83 amino acids). Therefore, the likelihood that this sequence constitutes an atypically long basic-type NLS is remote, although not impossible. EKLF/KLF1 belongs to a growing family of transcription factors that are highly homologous in their zinc finger region. Fig.7 illustrates the consensus amino acid sequence of the zinc finger region of 17 SP/KLF family members (adapted from Turner and Crossley (4Turner J. Crossley M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 236-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar)). An inspection of the sequence reveals that many but not all amino acids are conserved, indicating important functional roles for residues that are common to all family members. Interestingly, a comparison between the consensus and EKLF/KLF1 zinc finger sequences demonstrates that 14 of the 15 basic residues are perfectly conserved in all 17 members. Based on this observation together with our results demonstrating a critical role for the basic residues in nuclear localization, we propose that the basic residues of Kruppel zinc fingers are a common NLS shared by all Kruppel family members. Consistent with this proposal, the zinc fingers of GKLF/KLF4 encode a potent NLS (13Shields J.M. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18504-18507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), and the NLS for Sp1 has been delimited to the zinc finger region (32Kuwahara J. Azumano M. Takeda T. Nucleic Acids Symp. Ser. 1999; 42: 293-294Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that mutation of basic amino acids in the GKLF/KLF4 and Sp1 zinc fingers will inhibit the NLS activity of these domains.

As an initial approach to further define the cellular role of AGS1 in GPCR signaling, we determined the influence of AGS1 on the regulation of Gβγ-regulated inwardly rectifying K+ channel (GIRK) current (IACh) by M2-muscarinic receptor (M2-MR) in Xenopus oocytes.

These data suggest that AGS1 may antagonize GPCR signaling by altering the pool of heterotrimeric G-proteins available for receptor coupling and/or disruption of a preformed signaling complex.

These data suggest that AGS1 may antagonize GPCR signaling by altering the pool of heterotrimeric G-proteins available for receptor coupling and/or disruption of a preformed signaling complex. Such regulation would be of particular importance for those receptors that exist precoupled to heterotrimeric G-protein and for receptors operating within signaling complexes. Heterotrimeric G-proteins transduce a variety of extracellular stimuli into intracellular responses. Such stimuli are primarily sensed by the superfamily of G-protein-coupled receptors. In general, the specific intracellular response is determined by the external stimuli itself and cell type-specific expression of receptors, G-proteins, and effectors. However, additional proteins also operate to influence signaling specificity as well as signal magnitude and duration. Such accessory proteins may act as scaffolding proteins within a signal transduction complex and/or directly influence the basal activation state of G-proteins and effectors independent of an activated GPCR 1The abbreviations used are: GPCRG-protein-coupled receptorAGSactivator of G-protein signalingGIRKGβγ-regulated inwardly rectifying K+channelM2-MRM2-muscarinic receptors(1.Cismowski M.J.

The latter proteins include both the family of regulators ofG-protein signaling (RGS), initially defined based upon their ability to accelerate the GTPase activity of selected Giα proteins, and the recently identifiedactivators of G-protein signaling (AGS) 1–3.

AGS1 (AF069506) selectively activated the Gi/Go-protein signaling pathway, and it appears to act as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Gi, somewhat mimicking a GPCR (1.Cismowski M.J.

AGS1 is a member of the Ras superfamily of small G-proteins providing a potential interface between signaling pathways regulated by the two broad classes of G-proteins. AGS1 is the human counterpart of the Ras-related protein DexrasI (NP_033052), which was identified as a dexamethasone-inducible cDNA in AtT-20 mouse corticotroph cells (9.Kemppainen R.J. Behrend E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3129-3131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), where it may influence cAMP regulation of hormone secretion (10.Graham T.E. Key T.A. Kilpatrick K. Dorin R.I. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 2631-2640Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). AGS1 was also implicated inN-methyl-d-aspartate receptor signaling in neuronal cells, where it is an apparent target of neuronal nitric-oxide synthase (11.Fang M. Jaffrey S.R. Sawa A. Ye K. Luo X. Snyder S.H. Neuron. 2000; 28: 183-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Thus, AGS1 is clearly involved in cellular signaling events and binds to as well as activates Gi/Goα, but it is not known how this apparent G-protein regulator influences the activation of signaling systems by a GPCR. AGS1 may influence the specificity, magnitude, or duration of GPCR signaling events as it may actually interfere with receptor-effector coupling (12.Graham T.E. Prossnitz E.R. Dorin R.I. J. Biol.

Duzic, unpublished observations. by altering the pool of G-protein available for interacting with receptor. As an initial approach to define the role of AGS1 in GPCR signaling, we determined the influence of AGS1 on the regulation of Gβγ-regulated inwardly rectifying K+ channel (GIRK) current (IACh) by M2-muscarinic receptors (M2-MR) in Xenopus oocytes (13.Krapivinsky G.

Krapivinsky G.B. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Clapham D.E. Nature. 1994; 368: 255-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). AGS1 expression had little effect on basal levels of current (IhK) but inhibited the increase in GIRK channel activity elicited by activation of the M2-MR. The inhibition of IACh by AGS1 was progressively lost upon injection of increasing amounts of M2-MR cRNA. These data suggest that AGS1 antagonized GPCR signaling by altering the pool of heterotrimeric G-proteins available for receptor coupling and/or by disrupting a preformed signal transduction complex. GIRK1, GIRK4, and M2-MR in pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen) were kindly provided by Drs. Paolo Kofuji and H. A. Lester (California Institute of Technology). AGS1 and AGS1G31V were propagated in the pcDNA3.1-HisA vector (Invitrogen). All plasmids were linearized with appropriate enzymes at sites immediately following translational stop codons and used for capped cRNA synthesis using mMESSAGE MACHINE kits (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX). Xenopus oocytes were surgically extracted and dissociated with defolliculation by collagenase treatment (1 mg/ml collagenase A; Roche Applied Sciences, Indianapolis, IN) (15.Quick M.W. Lester H.A. Narahashi T. Ion Channels of Excitable Cells. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1994: 261-279Google Scholar). Healthy stage V and VI oocytes were selected and maintained at 19 °C in ND96 buffer (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mmHEPES, pH 7.5) supplemented with 5% horse serum, 2.5 mmsodium pyruvate, and 50 μg/ml gentamycin. Various combinations of cRNAs (final volume, 50 nl in diethyl pyrocarbonate-H2O) were injected into stage V and VI oocytes with a Drummond microinjector. Injected oocytes were incubated for 2 days at 19 °C with replacement of culture medium twice daily. Electrophysiological measurements were carried out using a standard two-electrode voltage clamp technique (16.Nowak M.W. Kearney P.C. Sampson J.R. Saks M.E. Labarca C.G. Silverman S.K. Zhong W. Thorson J. Abelson J.N. Davidson N. Schultz P.G. Dougherty D.A. Lester H.A. Science. 1995; 268: 439-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Oocytes were clamped at −80 mV using a Warner oocyte clamp (Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT). Voltage and current recording electrodes had resistances of 0.5–2 megaohms. Constitutive GIRK-associated current responses (IhK) were elicited by switching the perfusion medium from ND96 to a high potassium solution (2 mm NaCl, 96 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm Hepes, pH 7.5). Acetylcholine-induced GIRK current responses were elicited by switching the perfusion solution from high potassium to high potassium solution containing acetylcholine. The difference between the acetylcholine-mediated current andIhK is referred to asIACh. Switching the perfusion solution back to ND96 returned the current to base-line values (see Fig. 1A). The ability of AGS1 to interact with heterotrimeric G-proteins raises immediate questions as to its role in signal processing following activation of a GPCR at the cell surface. To address this question, we investigated the role of AGS1 on M2-MR coupling to GIRK channels using a Xenopus oocyte expression system. The Xenopus oocyte expression system has been widely utilized to analyze the function and regulation of GIRK channel activities because of the ease of gene expression and functional readouts. In oocytes injected with GIRK1/4 cRNAs and M2-MR cRNA, an inward K+ current (IhK) was elicited by exchanging ND96 for a high potassium solution. Acetylcholine elicited an additional inward K+ current (IACh), and this receptor-mediated event was completely blocked by injection of pertussis toxin. 3A. Takesono, M. W. Nowak, and S. M. Lanier, unpublished observations. Co-injection of AGS1 with GIRK1/4 and M2-MR cRNAs elicited little change in Ihk but markedly diminishedIACh (Fig. 1). 4A. Takesono, M. W. Nowak, and S. M. Lanier, unpublished observations. IhK were slightly (∼2-fold) but consistently increased by co-injection of AGS1 cRNA with GIRK1/4 cRNAs, but this effect was variable and of lesser magnitude when oocytes were also injected with M2-MR cRNA. A more robust regulation of G-protein signaling by AGS1 may require stimulus input to AGS1 to activate the protein. This signal input is likely absent in the oocyte perfusion system. G-protein activation of AGS1 may also be more robust in an assay system involving a cumulative response readout (i.e. growth or luciferase reporter assays as in yeast and COS7 cells, respectively) (1.Cismowski M.J. Takesono A. Ma C. Lizano J.S. Xie X. Fuernkranz H. Lanier S.M. Duzic E. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 878-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 4.Cismowski M.J. Ma C. Ribas C. Xie X. Spruyt M. Lizano J.S. Lanier S.M. Duzic E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23421-23424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Mutation of residues in the G1 domain of AGS1 (G31V) rendered AGS1 inactive (Fig. 1, A and B), as was the case for AGS1 in the yeast assay system and for AGS1 regulation of ERK activity in COS-7 cells (1.Cismowski M.J. Takesono A. Ma C. Lizano J.S. Xie X. Fuernkranz H. Lanier S.M. Duzic E. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 878-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 4.Cismowski M.J. Ma C. Ribas C. Xie X. Spruyt M. Lizano J.S. Lanier S.M. Duzic E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23421-23424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The inhibition ofIACh by expression of AGS1 was progressively enhanced by injection of increasing amounts of AGS1 cRNAs (Fig. 2). At the lower expression levels of GIRK channels (0.01 ng/oocyte), AGS1 inhibitedIACh by 76 ± 4.2% (Fig. 2A). In oocytes expressing higher levels of GIRK channels, AGS1 inhibitedIACh by 47 ± 7.7% (Fig. 2B). Expression of AGS1G31V did not alter IACh at either expression level of GIRK channels (Fig. 2), indicating that the inhibition of IACh was not because of altered expression of receptor or channels, per se. This thought is further supported by the absence of a decrease inIhk when AGS1 was coexpressed with GIRK channels. Thus, AGS1 likely inhibits IACh by interfering with the transfer of signal from receptor to G-protein or perhaps from G-protein to the channels. Similar conclusions regarding the action of AGS1 on GPCR signaling were reported by Graham et al. (12.Graham T.E. Prossnitz E.R. Dorin R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10876-10882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) for formyl peptide receptor activation of ERK1/2 kinases in COS-7 cells. As AGS1 clearly interacts with Gi/Go α subunits (1.Cismowski M.J. Takesono A. Ma C. Lizano J.S. Xie X. Fuernkranz H. Lanier S.M. Duzic E. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 878-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 4.Cismowski M.J. Ma C. Ribas C. Xie X. Spruyt M. Lizano J.S. Lanier S.M. Duzic E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23421-23424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), AGS1 may inhibit IACh by competing with M2-MR for the available pool of G-proteins. This possibility was addressed by examining the dose-response curve for acetylcholine in the presence and absence of AGS1 and by determining the ability of increasing amounts of M2-MR to overcome the AGS1-mediated IACh inhibition. Under standard experimental conditions (cRNA/oocyte: M2-MR, 0.1 ng; GIRK1/4, 2 ng for each; AGS1, 5 ng) increasing concentrations of acetylcholine did not overcome the inhibitory effect of AGS1 onIACh (Fig. 3A). In contrast to the influence of increasing amounts of agonist, the inhibitory action of AGS1 on IACh was overcome by increasing the levels of expressed receptor. Increased levels of receptor increased the amount of IAch at fixed amounts of GIRK channels, suggesting that under these experimental conditions receptor was somewhat rate-limiting or that at least G-proteins and effectors were not saturated (17.Herlitz S. Ruppersberg J.P. Mark M.D. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 517: 341-352Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). At the lowest expression levels of M2-MR (0.1 ng of cRNA/oocyte), AGS1 inhibitedIACh by 80 ± 3.9%IACh (Fig. 3B). At the higher levels of M2-MR expression, AGS1 inhibitedIACh by only 17 ± 5.9%IACh (Fig. 3B). AGS1G31V did not inhibit IACh at any levels of M2-MR expression (Fig. 3B). These observations raise several interesting points relative to signal processing through this system. The ability of increased amounts of receptor to overcome the inhibitory effect of AGS1 suggests that, indeed, AGS1 competes with the M2-MR for the pool of available heterotrimeric Gi/Go to activate GIRK channel. This may reflect an action of AGS1 to disrupt a preconfigured signal transduction complex that is required for agonist activity. Thus increasing concentrations of agonist could not overcome the inhibitory affect of AGS1 action. Such a signal transduction complex may consist of receptor and G-protein, G-protein and GIRK, or perhaps all three entities (17.Herlitz S. Ruppersberg J.P. Mark M.D. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 517: 341-352Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 18.Huang C.L. Slesinger P.A. Casey P.J. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y.

Chem. 2000; 275: 4166-4170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). By complexing with a defined population of G-proteins, AGS1 may limit the ability of a receptor to act catalytically as it cannot access multiple G-proteins. These thoughts likely have important implications for Gi/Go-coupled receptors that exist in a precoupled state where the receptor is complexed with G-protein and “stabilized” in a conformation exhibiting high affinity for agonist. AGS1 may block the formation of this precoupled complex, and as such, even high concentrations of agonist would not be able to activate downstream effectors. Increasing the amount of receptors in the presence of AGS1 as opposed to agonist itself would allow more of the receptor population to exist in a precoupled state and thus effectively override the inhibitory effect of AGS1 as was indeed the case in the present study. A flurry of recent reports indicates that multiple proteins interact with and/or regulate the activation state of heterotrimeric G-proteins. Although the role of these proteins in GPCR processing can be varied, they certainly offer unexpected avenues for manipulating the signaling system. Controlling the population of receptors precoupled with G-protein or the generation of signaling complexes may be a key mechanism for regulating the action of hormones and as such provide new pathways for therapeutics that mimic or disrupt specific signaling systems. We appreciate the suggestions and input of Drs. Motohiko Sato and Joe Blumer in the Lanier laboratory."

In mammalian cells, MM1 co-immunoprecipitated with p73α, whereas p73β and tumor suppressor p53 did not interact with MM1. Overexpression of MM1 in p53-deficient osteosarcoma SAOS-2 cells enhanced the p73α-dependent transcription from the p53/p73-responsiveBax and PG13 promoters, whereas p73β- and p53-mediated transcriptional activation was unaffected in the presence of MM1.

In addition, the endogenous level of p73 is increased during retinoic acid-induced differentiation in cultured neuroblastoma cells, and overexpression of p73 but not p53 caused neuronal differentiation (14.De Laurenzi V. Raschella G. Barcaroli D. Annicchiarico-Petruzzelli M. Ranalli M. Catani M.V. Tanno B. Costanzo A. Levrero M. Melino G. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 823-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) have found that overexpression of p73 induces the growth arrest and the senescence-like phenotypes in human bladder carcinoma cells.p73 is assigned to chromosome 1p36.3, which is a candidate tumor suppressor locus in a variety of human cancers (1.Kaghad M. Bonnet H. Yang A. Creancier L. Biscan J.C. Valent A. Minty A. Chalon P. Lelias J.M. Dumont X. Ferrara P. McKeon F. Caput D. Cell. 1997; 90: 809-819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1533) Google Scholar). Although p73 mimics p53 in transcriptional activation as well as induction of apoptosis, p73 is infrequently mutated in many human tumors (15.Ikawa S. Nakagawara A. Ikawa Y. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1154-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In contrast to p53-knockout mice, p73 deficiency in mice did not lead to an increased susceptibility to spontaneous tumorigenesis (16.Yang A. Walker N. Bronson R. Kaghad M. Oosterwegel M. Bonnin J. Vagner C. Bonnet H. Dikkes P. Sharpe A. McKeon F. Caput D. Nature. 2000; 404: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar). In addition, the elevated level of p73expression was detected in some primary tumors, including breast and ovarian cancers (17.Zaika A.I. Kovalev S. Marchenko N. Moll U.M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3257-3263PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Chen C.L. Ip S.M. Cheng D. Wong L.C. Ngan H.Y. Clin. Cancer Res. 2000; 6: 3910-3915PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent work from several laboratories has shown that forced expression of cellular and viral oncogenes, such as E2F-1, c-Myc, and E1A, stimulated expression of the p73 gene (19.Lissy N.A.

Thus, there have been conflicting reports about the role of p73 in cellular function, although the reasons remain unclear.Unlike p53, p73 encodes at least six distinct isoforms (α, β, γ, δ, ε, and ζ) that are generated as a result of the alternative splicing of the primary p73transcript (1.Kaghad M. Bonnet H. Yang A. Creancier L. Biscan J.C. Valent A. Minty A. Chalon P. Lelias J.M. Dumont X. Ferrara P. McKeon F. Caput D.

These splicing isoforms possess different COOH-terminal extensions not found in p53, and their expression patterns vary among normal tissues (3.De Laurenzi V. Costanzo A. Barcaroli D. Torrinoni A.

Intriguingly, these COOH-terminal splicing isoforms show different transcriptional and biological properties (3.De Laurenzi V. Costanzo A. Barcaroli D. Torrinoni A. Falclco M.

Takagi S. Chiba T. Shimotohno K. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4993-4998Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Indeed, p73β transactivated a variety of the p53-responsive promoters to a greater degree than p73α (2.Jost C.A. Marin M.C. Kaelin Jr., W.G.

Similarly, the ability of p73β to inhibit cell growth in p53-deficient cells was stronger than p73α (3.De Laurenzi V. Costanzo A. Barcaroli D. Torrinoni A. Falclco M. Annicchiarico-Petruzzelli M. Levrero M. Melino G. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1763-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the COOH-terminal region of p73 may possess a regulatory role, which modulates its transactivation ability as well as its biological activity.Accumulating evidence indicates that homotypic and heterotypic interactions among p53 family members regulate their activities. The various p73 splicing isoforms interacted with each other with various efficiency (1.Kaghad M. Bonnet H. Yang A. Creancier L. Biscan J.C. Valent A. Minty A. Chalon P. Lelias J.M. Dumont X.

Biol. 1999; 19: 1438-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar) found that tumor-derived p53 mutants but not wild-type p53 were associated with p73α and thereby reduced its transactivation and pro-apoptotic function. Likewise, p53 mutant also interacted with the remaining p73 splicing isoforms (β, γ, and δ) through its DNA-binding domain, and abrogated their transcriptional activities (26.Strano S. Munarriz E. Rossi M. Cristofanelli B. Shaul Y. Castagnoli L. Levine A.J. Sacchi A. Cesareni G. Oren M. Blandino G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29503-29512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The ability of mutant p53 to interact with p73 was regulated by the status of a common p53 polymorphism at codon 72 (27.Marin M.C. Jost C.A. Brooks L.A. Irwin M.S. O'Nions J. Tidy J.A. James N.

Recently, Yang et al. (16.Yang A. Walker N. Bronson R. Kaghad M. Oosterwegel M. Bonnin J. Vagner C. Bonnet H. Dikkes P. Sharpe A. McKeon F. Caput D.

ΔNp73 was generated from an alternative promoter located within the intron 3 of the p73 gene and lost the transactivation ability toward the p53-responsive promoter. Of note, ΔNp73 was predominantly expressed in the developing brain and sympathetic neurons, and inhibited the pro-apoptotic function of p53 by hetero-oligomerization (29.Pozniak C.D. Radinovic S. Yang A. McKeon F. Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. Science. 2000; 289: 304-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). These homotypic and heterotypic interactions among p53 family members give a complexity to the understanding of the p73 signaling in vivo.Various lines of evidence suggest that the extreme COOH-terminal region of p53 has a function of negative regulator. The COOH terminus of p53 directly binds and masks its central DNA-binding domain (30.Hupp T.R. Lane D.P. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1994; 59: 195-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 31.Hupp T.R. Sparks A. Lane D.P. Cell. 1995; 83: 237-245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Indeed, its inhibitory effect was removed by structural modifications such as phosphorylation, glycosylation, acetylation, or deletions (32.Hupp T.R. Meek D.W. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P.

Additionally, physical interaction of Ref-1 (previously identified as the AP-1-stimulating protein (37.Xanthoudakis S. Curran T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 653-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar)) or 14-3-3 with the COOH-terminal region of p53 stimulated its DNA-binding activity (38.Jayaraman L. Murthy K.G.K. Zhu C. Curran T. Xanthoudakis S. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 558-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar,39.Waterman M.J.F. Stavridi E.S. Waterman J.L.F. Halazonetis T.D. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Like p53, the COOH-terminal deletion of p73α caused the significant increase in its DNA-binding and transactivation activities (8.Ueda Y. Hijikata M. Takagi S. Chiba T. Shimotohno K. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4993-4998Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 25.Lee C.-W. La Thangue N.B. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4171-4181Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 40.Ozaki T. Naka M. Takada N. Tada M. Sakiyama S. Nakagawara A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5902-5907PubMed Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the p73-DNA crystal structure might be similar to that of p53, although the COOH-terminal region of p73 does not share amino acid sequence similarity with that of p53.The purpose of this study was initially to isolate and characterize cellular protein(s) that could associate with the COOH-terminal region of p73α. By using a yeast-based two-hybrid screening, we identified MM1, which had been reported to be a c-Myc-binding protein (41.Mori K. Maeda Y. Kitaura H. Taira T. Iguchi-Ariga S.M. Ariga H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29794-29800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), as a p73α COOH-terminal region-binding protein. We found that overexpression of MM1 stimulated the p73α-mediated transcription from some p53/p73-responsive promoters as well as growth suppression. Moreover, c-Myc bound to p73α and inhibited the p73α-dependent transactivation. Of interest, overexpression of MM1 antagonized the inhibitory effect of c-Myc on p73α.DISCUSSIONOur present results have revealed for the first time that p73 is directly associated with c-Myc and its repressor MM1. However, the functional interactions among them appear to be finely regulated. MM1 is able to bind only to p73α but not to p73β and stimulates transactivation ability of the former. Only c-Myc but not N-Myc binds to p73α and inhibits its transcriptional activity. In addition, the regulatory effect of MM1 on p73α function seems to be dependent on each target gene promoter. Nevertheless, our finding of a direct link through forming a complex among c-Myc oncogene product, p73 tumor suppressor, and MM1 should give a new insight into better understanding of molecular and cellular mechanism of cell cycle control and apoptosis.MM1 has bound to p73α at the extreme COOH-terminal region, which regulates its transactivation activity and DNA-binding ability. Like p53, p73-mediated transcription and apoptosis are reported to be markedly enhanced by binding to p300/CBP (9.Zeng X. Li X. Miller A. Yuan Z. Yuan W. Kwok R.P. Goodman R. Lu H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1299-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), or the COOH-terminal deletions (8.Ueda Y. Hijikata M. Takagi S. Chiba T. Shimotohno K. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4993-4998Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 25.Lee C.-W. La Thangue N.B. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4171-4181Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 40.Ozaki T. Naka M. Takada N. Tada M. Sakiyama S. Nakagawara A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5902-5907PubMed Google Scholar). The importance of the COOH-terminal region of p53 has so far been insisted. The extreme COOH-terminal region of p53 is closely involved in its pro-apoptotic function by protein·protein interactions (48.Wang X.W. Vermeulen W. Coursen J.D. Gibson M. Lupold S.E. Forrester K. Xu G. Elmore L. Yeh H. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Harris C.C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1219-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The physical interaction of the NH2-terminal region of p53 with the components of RNA polymerase II transcriptional machinery or with the transcriptional coactivators such as p300/CBP enhanced its transcriptional activity (49.Thut C.J. Chen J.L. Klemin R. Tjian R. Science. 1995; 267: 100-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 50.Lu H. Levine A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 1997; 89: 1175-1184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). Similarly, the structural modifications within the COOH-terminal region of p53 significantly facilitated its sequence-specific DNA binding (32.Hupp T.R. Meek D.W. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Cell. 1992; 71: 875-886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar, 33.Shaw P. Freeman J. Bovey R. Iggo R. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 921-930PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Gu W. Roeder R.G.

Genet. 1998; 19: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). In relation to these observations on p53, the importance of the COOH-terminal extension of p73α has also been implicated. There exist various functional motifs, including a PPPPY motif (amino acid residues 482–488) and a SAM domain (amino acid residues 484–549) within that region. The SAM domain seems to be a protein·protein interaction module found in a variety of proteins involved in developmental regulation (52.Chi S.-M. Ayed A. Arrowsmith C.H. EMBO J. 1999; 16: 4438-4445Crossref Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that Yes-associated protein is associated with p73α via its PPPPY motif and enhances the transcriptional activity of p73α (53.Strano S. Munarriz E. Rossi M. Castagnoli L. Shaul Y. Sacchi A. Oren M. Sudol M. Cesareni G. Blandino G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15164-15173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). In addition, Minty et al. (54.Minty A. Dumont X. Kaghad M. Caput D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36316-36323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) have found that p73α but not p73β bound to SUMO-1, and the extreme COOH-terminal Lys residue of p73α (at position 627) is the major site for SUMO-1 modification. SUMO-1 modification alters the subcellular distribution of p73, although it did not affect the transcriptional activity of p73. Furthermore, the extreme COOH-terminal region of p73α is suggested to act as a negative regulator of its own function (8.Ueda Y. Hijikata M. Takagi S. Chiba T. Shimotohno K. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4993-4998Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 40.Ozaki T. Naka M. Takada N. Tada M. Sakiyama S. Nakagawara A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5902-5907PubMed Google Scholar). In conjunction with those observations reported, our data suggest that the interaction of MM1 with the extreme COOH-terminal region allows p73α to take the conformation competent to express its activity, although the precise mechanism remains to be clarified.Our present data have shown that the ability of p73α to drive the transcription from the Bax and the PG13 promoter is enhanced by overexpression of MM1. However, the effect of MM1 on the p73α-mediated transcription from the MDM2 andp21 waf1 promoter is barely detectable. The similar pattern of target gene induction is also observed in some other cases. Mts1, which is associated with the extreme COOH-terminal region of p53, differentially regulates the transactivation function of p53 (55.Grigorian M. Andresen S. Tulchinsky E. Kriajevska M. Carlberg C. Kruse C. Cohn M. Ambartsumian N. Christensen A. Selivanova G. Lukanidin E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22699-22708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Mts1 significantly inhibited the p53-dependent transcription from the p21 waf1 promoter as measured in transient reporter assays, whereas its effect on the Bax promoter was negligible. Similarly, WT1 exhibited an inhibitory effect on the p53-regulated activation of the MDM2 promoter, whereas the repression of the Bax promoter by WT1 was not significant (56.Scharnhorst V. Dekker P. van der Eb A.J. Jochemsen A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10202-10211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Recently, Thornborrow and Manfredi (57.Thornborrow E.C. Manfredi J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15598-15608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) have reported that there exists an Sp1-binding site immediately adjacent to the p53-responsive element of the Bax promoter, and p53 may require the cooperation of Sp1 to activate the Bax promoter. In contrast, the p53·Sp1 complex may function in an antagonistic manner for other promoters (58.Wang Q. Beck W.T. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5762-5769PubMed Google Scholar). These findings suggest that MM1-mediated differential regulation of the p53/p73-responsive promoters is due to a requirement for additional cofactors specific to each promoter, although this requires further elucidation.Recently, Ceballos et al. (45.Ceballos E. Delgado M.D. Gutierrez P. Richard C. Muller D. Eilers M. Ehinger M. Gullberg U. Leon J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2194-2204Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) have found that c-Myc significantly inhibits the transactivation and pro-apoptotic function of p53. Consistent with their report, our data have shown that co-expression of p53 with c-Myc results in a remarkable reduction of the p53-mediated transcriptional activation of the Bax andp21 waf1 promoter. Using the immunoprecipitation and the luciferase reporter assays, we have demonstrated that c-Myc physically interacts with p73α and thereby inhibits its transactivation function. In contrast, N-Myc, the other member of myc family, is unable to affect the p73α- or p53-dependent transcriptional activation. As reported previously, targeted homozygous disruption of the c-myc or N-myc gene resulted in embryonic lethality (59.Stanton B.R. Perkins A.S. Tessarollo L. Sassoon D.A. Parada L.F.

PACAP38 prevented anisomycin-induced cell death in the neuroblastic layer (NBL) of retinal explants, and complete inhibition of induced cell death was obtained with 1 nm. A similar protective effect was observed with PACAP27 and with the specific PAC1 receptor agonist maxadilan but not with glucagon. Photoreceptor cell death induced by thapsigargin was also prevented by PACAP38. The neuroprotective effect of PACAP38 upon the NBL could be reverted by the competitive PACAP receptor antagonist PACAP6–38 and by the specific PAC1 receptor antagonist Maxd.4. Molecular and immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated PAC1 receptors, and treatment with PACAP38 induced phospho-cAMP-response element-binding protein immunoreactivity in the anisomycin-sensitive undifferentiated postmitotic cells within the NBL. PACAP38 produced an increase in cAMP but not inositol triphosphate, and treatment with the cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitorRp-cAMPS blocked the protective effect of PACAP38. The results indicate that activation of PAC1 receptors by PACAP38 modulates cell death in the developing retina through the intracellular cAMP/cAMP-dependent protein kinase pathway. Multiple neuroactive substances are secreted by neurons and/or glial cells and modulate the sensitivity to cell death.

Identification of neuroprotective molecules is relevant both for embryogenesis as well as for studies of neurodegenerative diseases because the modes of cell death and many upstream control pathways appear to be conserved among both normal and pathological conditions (1Lockshin R.A. Zakeri Z.F. J. Gerontol. 1990; 45: B135-B140Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Classically, neuroprotection is attributed to neurotrophic proteins such as the neurotrophin family of growth factors (for a review, see Refs. 2Hefti F. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 239-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar and 3Gu P. Casaccia-Bonnefil C. Chao M.V. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1999; 468: 275-282Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but many lines of evidence support the involvement of both classical neurotransmitters and neuropeptides in the control of cell death (4Kater S.B. Lipton A.S. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 71-72Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 5Journot L. Villalba M. Bockaert J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 865: 100-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The retina of newborn rats is composed of two cellular strata separated by the inner plexiform layer. The innermost cellular stratum is the ganglion cell layer, the long axons of which form the optic nerve. On the opposite side of the inner plexiform layer, the outer cellular stratum contains a few rows of early developing amacrine cells in the inner nuclear layer. The remainder of the outer stratum constitutes the neuroblastic layer (NBL),1 which corresponds to the ventricular zone, in which high proliferative activity persists postnatally (6Alexiades M.R. Cepko C.L. Development. 1997; 124: 1119-1131PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the proliferating neuroblasts, the NBL in newborn rats contains undifferentiated postmitotic cells that are migrating toward their final destinations across the depth of the retinal tissue as well as a row of regularly spaced, early differentiating horizontal cells. At about 4 days after birth, the outer plexiform layer separates the neuroblastic layer from an outer nuclear layer, which progressively concentrates at the outermost retinal tier the cell bodies of the photoreceptors (7Craft J.L. Fulton A.B. Silver J. Albert D.M. Curr. Eye Res. 1982; 2: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). More than 95% of the latter are of the rhodopsin-containing rod type. Evolution into the multilayered structure of the mature retina is accompanied by a wave of naturally occurring cell death that shapes the final cell populations, similar to other areas of the central nervous system. The period of naturally occurring cell death is closely associated with both neuronal differentiation and the encounter of both target and afferent partners and tends to precede the establishment of the mature morphology of synaptic connections. Reproducible timing and a close relation with the stage of maturation of the various cell populations imply tight regulation of sensitivity to programmed cell death. Indeed, a host of extracellular molecules that affect programmed cell death were identified in experimental models of chemically or otherwise induced cell death in the developing retina (8Arauéjo E.G. Linden R. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1993; 5: 1181-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 9Rocha M. Martins R.A.P. Linden R.

Harvey A.R. Neuroreport. 2000; 11: 3921-3924Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Among those, we showed that dopamine protects the postmitotic undifferentiated retinal cells from degeneration induced by inhibition of protein synthesis through an increase in intracellular cAMP (13De Varella M.H. Mello F.G. Linden R. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 485-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The pituitary adenylyl cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) is a neuroactive peptide of the secretin/glucagon/vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) superfamily. PACAP was first isolated for its ability to induce the production of cAMP in the anterior pituitary of rats (14Miyata A. Arimura A. Dahl R.R. Minamino N. Uehara A. Culler M.D. Jiang L. Coy D.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 164: 567-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar). The PACAP precursor molecule is post-translationally processed into two biologically active products, PACAP38 and PACAP27 (14Miyata A. Arimura A. Dahl R.R. Minamino N. Uehara A. Culler M.D. Jiang L. Coy D.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 164: 567-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar, 15Miyata A. Jiang L. Dahl R.R. Kitada C. Kubo K. Fujino M. Minamino N. Arimura A. Biochem.

In the nervous system, PACAP has been associated with proliferation (16Lu N. Zhou R. DiCicco-Bloom E. J. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 53: 651-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), differentiation (17Lu N. DiCicco-Bloom E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Both PACAP and VIP act on receptors described pharmacologically as either type I (PACAP-specific) or type II (non-discriminative) (23Ishihara T. Shigemoto R. Mori K. Takahashi K. Nagata S. Neuron. 1992; 8: 811-819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar, 24Spengler D. Waeber C. Pantaloni C. Holsber F. Bockaert J. Seeburg P.H. Journot L.

Molecular cloning revealed three distinct receptors: PAC1, VPAC1, and VPAC2, of which the PAC1 receptor is selective for PACAP. The present study was designed to examine the effects of PACAP on induced cell death in the developing retina and the mechanisms that mediate its effects on retinal cell survival. Culture medium, fetal calf serum, and Trizol were from Invitrogen. Anisomycin was from Sigma. PACAP38 was from Peninsula Laboratories, San Carlos, CA. U73122, verapamil, nifedipine, and Rp-cAMPS were from Calbiochem. First-strand cDNA kit was from Amersham Biosciences. Maxadilan and Maxd.4 were kindly provided by Dr. Ethan Lerner from Harvard Medical School. Apoptag Tunel kit was from Intergen, Purchase, NY, and the antibody CM1 for activated caspase-3 was kindly provided by Dr. Anu Srinivasan (Idun Pharmaceuticals). All experimental procedures with animals were approved by the Committee on Animal Experimentation of the Institute of Biophysics Carlos Chagas Filho, based on the currently accepted international rules. Retinae were excised from the eyes of either 2-day-old or 6-day-old Lister hooded rat pups killed by instantaneous decapitation, and explants of ∼1 mm2 were maintained in an orbital shaker at 70–90 rpm in basal medium of Eagle supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum and 20 mm HEPES at pH 7.4 for 22 h except when noted. At the end of each experiment, the explants were fixed by immersion in 4% paraformaldehyde in sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, for 2 h and then cryoprotected in 30% sucrose in phosphate buffer. Transverse 10-μm-thick sections through the retinal tissue were cut at −20 °C in a cryostat and stained either with neutral red (postnatal day 2 (P2) explants) or with a monoclonal antibody to the rod photoreceptor pigment rhodopsin (P6). Although there is a clear centro-peripheral gradient of development in the rat retina, previous work showed that responses to the induction of cell death upon either a given cell type or cells at a given stage of differentiation (i.e. either proliferating or postmitotic) are the same in both central and peripheral locations (26Rehen S.K. Neves D.D.C. Fragel-Madeira L. Britto L.R.G. Linden R. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 4349-4356Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In the current experiments, usually eight explants were cut from each retina, and explants from at least six distinct retinae were pooled irrespective of retinal location in each experimental group. Dead cells were recognized by their condensed homogeneously and deeply stained chromatin among normal neighboring cells when explant sections were stained with neutral red (27Rehen S.K. Varella M.H. Freitas F.G. Moraes M.O. Linden R. Development. 1996; 122: 1439-1448PubMed Google Scholar). Counts of pyknotic profiles were made at ×1000 magnification under oil immersion in three random fields of 0.0148 mm2 within the neuroblastic layer, and at least three randomly selected explants were analyzed for each group in each experiment. Photoreceptor cell death was identified by the round and condensed morphology of rhodopsin-positive profiles within the outer nuclear layer, wherein normal photoreceptors present an elongated shape at that age (33Chiarini L.B. Freitas F.G. Petrs-Silva H. Linden R. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 272-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Counts were made at ×1000 magnification under oil immersion in three random fields of 0.0074 mm2 within the outer nuclear layer. At least three randomly selected explants were analyzed for each group in each of two independent experiments. Analysis of variance followed by planned comparisons using Duncan’s multiple range test were done with an SPSSPC statistical package. The apoptotic form of cell death was selectively examined in some experiments by staining dead cell profiles with either the TUNEL technique using an Apoptag kit or the antibody CM1, which recognizes the activated form of caspase-3 (28Namura S. Zhu J. Fink K. Endres M. Srinivasan A. Tomaselli K.J. Yvan J. Moskowitz M.A. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 3659-3688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA was prepared from the retinas of rat pups at postnatal day 2 (P2) using Trizol (Invitrogen), and cDNA was synthesized and amplified using primers (5′-CACAGTATTCGCCTTCTCTCC-3′, 5′-GCCTATCCCTATCTCTCTCTT-3′) that recognize a region from the carboxyl-terminal intracellular domain common to all PAC1 receptor isoforms (29Braas K.M. May V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27702-27710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Newborn rats (postnatal day 1) were anesthetized by hypothermia and received a series of three 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) injections (60 mg/kg of body weight at 0, 5, and 19 h) to label all proliferating cells, and experiments were performed 1 h after the last injection (26Rehen S.K. Neves D.D.C. Fragel-Madeira L. Britto L.R.G. Linden R. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 4349-4356Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To locate the PAC1 receptor within retinal tissue, sections through the eye were immunostained using an affinity-purified rabbit anti-PAC1 antibody kindly provided by Dr. Victor May (University of Vermont, Vermont, ME) (29Braas K.M. May V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27702-27710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). For phospho-CREB immunohistochemistry, retinal explants from rats injected with BrdUrd were maintained in vitro for various intervals either with or without PACAP38, and sections were processed with a rabbit anti-phospho-CREB antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Beverly, MA) and a monoclonal antibody for BrdUrd (Amersham Biosciences). Photoreceptors were stained with monoclonal antibody rho4D2, kindly provided by Dr. Robert S. Molday, at 37 °C overnight at 1:50. PAC1 and rho4D2 immunoreactivity were developed with the appropriate rabbit or mouse horseradish peroxidase-ABC kits, respectively (Vector, Burlingame, CA) with diaminobenzidine as chromogen. Both BrdUrd and phospho-CREB immunoreactivity were developed with Alexa Fluor conjugate fluorescent antibodies from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR) and analyzed in a Zeiss LSM310 confocal microscope. Cyclic AMP was quantitated according to the competitive binding assay of Gilman (30Gilman A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1970; 67: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (3358) Google Scholar) as described previously (13De Varella M.H. Mello F.G. Linden R. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 485-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Briefly, retinas from P2 rats were preincubated for 10 min at 37 °C in basal medium Eagle’s buffered at pH 7.4, containing 0.5 mm isobutylmethylxanthine and 100 μm ascorbic acid, and stimulated for 15 min with either PACAP38 or 6-Cl-PB ([±]-6-chloro-7, 8-dihydroxy-1-phenyl-2, 3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepine), a D1-like agonist that increases intracellular cAMP used as a positive control. The reaction was stopped with trichloroacetic acid, and after centrifugation, the supernatant was passed through an ion-exchange resin column (Dowex 50) to remove trichloroacetic acid and other nucleotides. The sample obtained was then used in a competition assay with the regulatory subunit of PKA with the addition of a fixed, trace amount of [3H]cAMP. Inositol triphosphate was assayed according to a modification (31Reis R.A.M. De Kubrusly R.C.C. Mello M.C.F. De Mello F.G. Neurochem. Int. 1995; 26: 375-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) of the method described by Berridge et al. (32Berridge M.J. Dawson R.M.C. Downes P. Heslop J.P. Irvine R.F. Biochem. J. 1983; 212: 473-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (1541) Google Scholar). Retinal explants from P2 rats were preincubated for 8 h in inositol-free defined medium containing [3H]myoinositol. The cultures were then treated with either 10 nm PACAP38 or 500 μmkainate as a positive control for 15 min in 10 mm LiCl. The reaction was stopped by the addition of trichloroacetic acid, and following ether extraction, the supernatants were separated by ion-exchange chromatography (Dowex AG1-X8 resin, formate form; Bio-Rad). Inositol triphosphate (IP3) was quantified in a liquid scintillation analyzer. We have shown previously that inhibition of protein synthesis by anisomycin induces cell death within the NBL of retinal explants from newborn rats (27Rehen S.K. Varella M.H. Freitas F.G. Moraes M.O. Linden R. Development. 1996; 122: 1439-1448PubMed Google Scholar). The sensitive cells could be rescued by the increase of intracellular cAMP levels (27Rehen S.K. Varella M.H. Freitas F.G. Moraes M.O. Linden R. Development. 1996; 122: 1439-1448PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether PACAP38, a potent cAMP inducer, affected retinal cell survival. PACAP38 protected cells from death induced by anisomycin with maximum effect at 1 nm (Fig.1, A–C). Retinal tissue treated with PACAP38 showed a very low density of pyknotic profiles, approximately the same as the density of control explants; part of these results, at least, are likely to be caused by slight mechanical damage to the tissue when preparing the explants. Protection against anisomycin-induced cell death was also observed with PACAP27 (data not shown). In contrast, glucagon, a peptide that belongs to the same family as PACAP, had no effect at a similar concentration range (Fig. 1C, inset). We specifically tested whether apoptosis could be prevented by PACAP38. Adjacent sections from the same explants were stained with neutral red (as in Fig. 1B), with the TUNEL procedure (Fig.1D), or with an antibody that detects the activated form of caspase-3 (Fig. 1E). Treatment with PACAP38 led to a reduction in the number of degenerating profiles identified with all three methods (Fig. 1F). The lower number of degenerating profiles detected with either TUNEL or the CM1 antibody may reflect the simultaneous occurrence of other forms of cell death besides apoptosis. Nevertheless, the data show that PACAP38 is effective against the caspase-3-dependent, apoptotic form of cell death. Previous work from our laboratory showed that thapsigargin selectively kills photoreceptors in the outer nuclear layer of retinal explants from 1-week-old rats (33Chiarini L.B. Freitas F.G. Petrs-Silva H. Linden R. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 272-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The degeneration of rhodopsin-containing photoreceptors was also prevented by PACAP38 (Fig.2). Therefore, the protective effect of PACAP is not restricted to anisomycin-induced cell death. To test whether the neuroprotective effect was mediated by interaction of PACAP38 with its receptors, we used the competitive PACAP receptor antagonist PACAP6–38. Increasing amounts of PACAP6–38 prevented, in a dose-dependent fashion, the action of PACAP38 upon anisomycin-induced cell death (Fig.3A). The maximum inhibitory effect of PACAP6–38 was observed at 1 μm. To further characterize PACAP receptors involved in neuroprotection, we used the specific PAC1 receptor antagonist Maxd.4, which was developed based on the sequence of the PAC1 receptor-specific agonist maxadilan, originally cloned from sandfly salivary glands (34Moro O. Lerner E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 966-970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 35Moro O. Wakita K. Ohnuma M. Denda S. Lerner E. Tajima M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23103-23110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 36Lerner E.A. Ribeiro J.M.C. Nelson R.J. Lerner M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11234-11236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment with increasing concentrations of Maxd.4 also prevented neuroprotection by PACAP38 (Fig. 3B) within a similar concentration range as that observed with PACAP6–38. In agreement with these results, 1 nm maxadilan also prevented anisomycin-induced cell death, and this protective effect was blocked by Maxd.4 (data not shown). The results obtained with both Maxd.4 and maxadilan suggested a major role for the PAC1 receptor on the neuroprotective effect of PACAP38 upon retinal cells. The presence of this receptor was then investigated both by reverse transcription-PCR and by immunohistochemistry with an anti-PAC1 antibody (Fig.4). Using primers for the carboxyl-terminal intracellular domain of the PAC1 receptor (29Braas K.M. May V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27702-27710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), we amplified a product of the expected 449-bp size (Fig. 4A). Consistent with the latter result, immunoreactivity for the PAC1 receptor was found in all layers of the retina in P2 rat eyes, including the NBL (Fig. 4, B and C). We examined whether cells from the NBL responded to PACAP38 by testing for the induction of CREB phosphorylation. CREB is a transcriptional factor that may be activated by multiple stimuli, including intracellular cAMP (for a review, see Ref. 37Mayr B. Montminy M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 599-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2061) Google Scholar). Retinal explants were maintained for 2 h without stimulus, and then either PACAP38 or vehicle was added for 5, 20, or 60 min. Nuclei labeled for phospho-CREB were already detected at 5 min of treatment with PACAP38 in the neuroblastic layer (data not shown), but labeling was more intense after 20 min of incubation (Fig.5A, red), consistent with the detection of the PAC1 receptor (Fig. 4). In contrast, sections from explants maintained in control medium showed almost no detectable labeling for phospho-CREB within the NBL (Fig.5C). Phospho-CREB labeling of cells located in the outer half of the NBL was particularly strong. Cells within the NBL that degenerate following treatment with anisomycin are mainly located in the outer half of the neuroblastic layer and were identified as undifferentiated postmitotic cells because they neither incorporate BrdUrd following serial injections designed as to label the maximum possible number of proliferating neuroblasts nor can they be stained with various antibodies to retinal cell differentiation markers (26Rehen S.K. Neves D.D.C. Fragel-Madeira L. Britto L.R.G. Linden R. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 4349-4356Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We tested whether postmitotic cells were phospho-CREB-positive by prelabeling proliferating cells with BrdUrd injections identical to those used in our previous study (26Rehen S.K. Neves D.D.C. Fragel-Madeira L. Britto L.R.G. Linden R. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 4349-4356Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Confocal microscopic examination of sections from explants treated with PACAP38 (Fig. 5) showed that a large number of cells unlabeled for BrdUrd within the NBL (ingreen) were strongly labeled with phospho-CREB (inred). These data suggest that PACAP38 may affect directly the cells that are sensitive to cell death induced by the blockade of protein synthesis. The various PAC1 receptor isoforms can trigger several signal transduction mechanisms, including the activation of phospholipase C, adenylyl cyclase, or the modulation of voltage-dependent L-type Ca2+ channels. We tested whether one or more of these pathways were associated with the neuroprotective effect of PACAP38. No IP3 production was found in PACAP38-stimulated retinal explants (Fig. 6A). The PLC inhibitor, U73122, also failed to prevent the neuroprotective effect of PACAP38 upon anisomycin-induced cell death (Fig. 6B). At the concentration range tested, U73122 had no effect by itself (data not shown). The selective L-type Ca2+ channel inhibitors verapamil (30 μm) and nifedipine (10 μm) also did not prevent the neuroprotective effect of PACAP (data not shown). In contrast, PACAP38 at 1 and 10 nm induced a 2.5-fold and 6-fold increase in cAMP levels, respectively (Fig.7A), similar to the dopamine D1-like receptor agonist 6-Cl-PB, which was used as a positive control (13De Varella M.H. Mello F.G. Linden R. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 485-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Moreover, the PKA inhibitor, Rp-cAMPS, completely reverted the neuroprotective effect of PACAP38 (Fig.7B). These results clearly show a requirement of the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway for PACAP38-induced neuroprotection.Figure 7The cAMP/PKA pathway is required for modulation of anisomycin-induced cell death by PACAP38. A, relative levels of cAMP in retinal explants treated with either 1 or 10 nm PACAP38. The levels in control conditions were set to 1, and the dopamine D1-like receptor agonist 6-Cl-PB (100 μm) was used as a positive control. The data represent the mean ± S.E. of four experiments with at least two replicas per group. B, effect of the PKA inhibitorRp-cAMPS (100 μm) in explants treated with 1 μg/ml anisomycin plus 1 nm PACAP38.

Activation of PAC1 receptors expressed in the NBL of the neonatal rat retina resulted in production of cAMP and consequent activation of PKA, whereas a PKA inhibitor prevented the neuroprotective effect. PACAP38 also led to phosphorylation of CREB in the retinal tissue. In addition, PACAP38 counteracted photoreceptor cell death induced by thapsigargin. The detection of PACAP-induced effects upon both recent postmitotic cells of the neuroblastic layer as well as upon rhodopsin-containing photoreceptors suggest that both undifferentiated and differentiated cells may be subject to neuroprotection by PACAP. Both PACAP and VIP act on the same receptors, which were pharmacologically classified as types I and II by their relative affinity for the peptides. Subsequent molecular characterization showed three genes that encoded G-protein-coupled receptors responsive to these peptides with great functional heterogeneity (23Ishihara T. Shigemoto R. Mori K.

The PAC1 receptor is considered a PACAP-specific receptor and may present splicing variants that differ in the intracellular signaling pathways activated, which include adenylyl cyclase, phospholipase C, or modulation of L-type calcium channels (24Spengler D.

In contrast with other regions of the central and peripheral nervous system, functional studies of PACAP peptides and their receptors in the developing retina are rare (42Shoge K. Mishima H.K.

Both PACAP as well as the mRNA and immunoreactivity for the PACAP receptor have been described in the retina of adult rats (43Seki T. Shioda S. Nakai Y. Arimura A. Koide R. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Production of cAMP following activation of PACAP receptors was also described in the retinae of some mammalian species (47Onali P. Olianas M.C.

In the present study, the PAC1 receptor was located in the developing retina and shown to be functional as well as participating in a neuroprotective signaling pathway. This is supported by the experiments showing that the specific antagonist Maxd.4 (35Moro O. Wakita K. Ohnuma M. Denda S. Lerner E. Tajima M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23103-23110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) reverted (Fig. 3B), whereas the specific agonist maxadilan (34Moro O. Lerner E.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1991; 266: 11234-11236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reproduced the neuroprotective effect of PACAP. Nonetheless, a contribution of VPAC1 and VPAC2 receptors cannot be discarded. Previous work in our laboratory has taken advantage of retinal explants in culture to study the sensitivity of developing nervous tissue to cell death (for a review, see Refs. 40Linden R. Rehen S.K. Chiarini L.B. Prog. in Retinal and Eye Res. 1999; 18: 133-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar and 41Linden R. Brain Res. Rev. 2000; 32: 146-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). It was established that treatment of retinal explants with inhibitors of protein synthesis induces cell death in undifferentiated postmitotic cells (26Rehen S.K. Neves D.D.C. Fragel-Madeira L. Britto L.R.G. Linden R. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 4349-4356Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 27Rehen S.K. Varella M.H. Freitas F.G. Moraes M.O. Linden R. Development. 1996; 122: 1439-1448PubMed Google Scholar) and that an increase in intracellular cAMP levels, as well as dopamine-induced activation of a D1-like receptor (13De Varella M.H. Mello F.G. Linden R. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 485-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), protected the neuroblastic layer from anisomycin-induced cell death. We tested the roles of PACAP signaling pathways in the neuroprotective effect. Activation of phospholipase C does not appear to be involved because neither was IP3 production detected following incubation of retinal tissue with PACAP at a maximally effective concentration (Fig. 6A) nor did treatment with the PLC inhibitor, U73122, prevent the effect (Fig. 6B). A role of L-type calcium channels (39Chaterjee T.K. Sharma R.V. Fisher R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32226-32232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) was also ruled out in the present conditions. On the other hand, the PACAP-induced activation of PKA was required for neuroprotection (Fig. 7). We cannot discard the possibility that PACAP acts indirectly to promote neuroprotection, for example, inducing the secretion of neurotrophic factors or other intervening neuroactive substances. Indeed, previous work from our laboratory demonstrated paracrine neuroprotective effects of nitric oxide released from amacrine cells upon the neuroblastic layer (10Ary-Pires R. Nakatani M. Rehen S.K. Linden R. Int. J. Dev. Neurosci. 1997; 15: 239-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, our data showed that CREB phosphorylation was also induced in postmitotic cells within the undifferentiated neuroblastic layer by PACAP38, which is consistent with a direct action of PKA upon the cells sensitive to anisomycin-induced degeneration. In conclusion, the overall data demonstrate that PACAP-induced activation of the cAMP/PKA pathway through the PAC1 receptor lowers the sensitivity of retinal cells to induced cell death. The results add PACAP to a growing list of intrinsic modulators of sensitivity to cell death within the developing central nervous system. Studies of the kinetics of neurodegenerative cell loss suggested that cell death in inherited neurodegenerations, rather than being caused by cumulative damage, may be due to single catastrophic events imposed on an altered homeostatic state (20Clarke G. Collins R.A. Leavitt B.R. Andrews D.F. Hayden M.R. Lumsden C.J. McInnes R.R. Nature. 2000; 406: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The present data suggest that neuropeptides such as PACAP help to maintain retinal cells in a steady state removed from apoptosis execution pathways and may therefore be relevant for the control of inherited retinal dystrophies.

IEX-1gene expression is regulated by a variety of factors such as x-irradiation, ultraviolet radiation, steroids, growth factors, and inflammatory stimuli. By systematic examination of theIEX-1 promoter, we show that IEX-1 gene expression is controlled by multiple conserved gene regulatory elements and that IEX-1 is a downstream target of the p53 tumor suppressor and Sp1. In addition, p300, Sox, nuclear factor-κB, and AP4 appear to be modulators of IEX-1 gene expression to a lesser degree. We found that there is at least one Sp1 element that functions as an activator and contributes to high basal transcriptional levels of the IEX-1 gene. We demonstrate the presence of a p53 response element that represses IEX-1 promoter activity in HaCaT keratinocytes, indicating that Sp1 and p53 have opposite effects on IEX-1 gene expression. We conclude thatIEX-1 expression in cells is regulated by the p53 tumor suppressor and Sp1, thus providing a direct mechanism for control of cell proliferation.

Expression of immediate-early genes is rapidly and transiently induced in response to growth factors and other extracellular signals. Genes unregulated during growth factor stimulation include nuclear proteins (e.g. c-Fos, c-Jun, c-Myc, zinc finger proteins, and nuclear hormone receptors), secretory molecules (e.g. cytokine-related factors), and components of the cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix. Nuclear factors encoded by immediate-early genes regulate expression of other genes that are required for cell cycle progression toward the G1/S phase transition (1.Bravo R. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1990; 1: 37-46PubMed Google Scholar). IEX-1(immediate-early response factor X) represents a recently characterized member of the immediate-early gene family that may be critical for control of cell proliferation in several cell types. IEX-1 (also known as Dif-1 and PRG1), the human ortholog of murine gly96, was first identified in human squamous carcinoma cells as a radiation-inducible immediate-early gene (2.Charles C.H.

The IEX-1 gene encodes a 17-kDa, 156-amino acid protein that undergoes post-translational modification by glycosylation to yield a product of 27–29 kDa (5.Kondratyev A.D. Chung K. Jung M.O. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1498-1502PubMed Google Scholar). Apart from the induction ofIEX-1 in x-irradiated human tumor cells (5.Kondratyev A.D. Chung K. Jung M.O. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1498-1502PubMed Google Scholar), this gene is known to be regulated at the mRNA level by ultraviolet B radiation (6.Kumar R. Kobayashi T. Warner G.M. Wu Y. Salisbury J.L.

Kumar R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 868-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and inflammatory stimuli such as lipopolysaccharide and ceramide (8.Pietzsch A. Buchler C.

Pancreas. 1999; 18: 378-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) suggest that IEX-1 plays a critical role in the control of keratinocyte cell growth and apoptosis. Consistent with this concept, IEX-1 is a nuclear protein whose cellular location is altered by steroid hormones such as α1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (7.Kobayashi T. Pittelkow M.R. Warner G.M. Squillace K.A. Kumar R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 868-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) that influence cell growth and differentiation. Recent reports have shown that disruption ofIEX-1 expression by hammerhead ribozymes specifically reduces growth rate and influences cell cycle progression in 293 cells (10.Grobe O. Arlt A. Ungefroren H. Krupp G. Rolsch U.R. Schmidt W.E. Schafer H. FEBS Lett. 2001; 494: 196-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In addition, 293 cells stably transfected with hammerhead concatameric ribozyme expression constructs are much less sensitive to Fas/CDE95-mediated apoptosis or the anticancer drugs etoposide and doxorubicin. Hence, IEX-1 may promote cell proliferation when growth factor conditions are favorable and facilitate apoptosis through death receptor activation under unfavorable conditions (10.Grobe O. Arlt A. Ungefroren H. Krupp G. Rolsch U.R. Schmidt W.E. Schafer H. FEBS Lett. 2001; 494: 196-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Comparable results have been obtained in our laboratory using a keratinocyte cell system (11.Schilling D. Pittelkow M.R. Kumar R. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7992-7997Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Forced expression of IEX-1significantly increases the growth rate of keratinocytes under basal conditions and increases the rate of apoptosis when cells are subjected to stress (11.Schilling D. Pittelkow M.R. Kumar R. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7992-7997Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Because IEX-1 plays an important role in cell growth and apoptosis, the molecular mechanisms by which the IEX-1 gene is regulated require further investigation.

Oncogene. 2001; 20: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) have been identified. The tumor suppressor p53 is a crucial regulator of cell cycle progression, apoptosis in DNA-damaged cells, and maintenance of genomic stability (15.Baker S.J. Markowitz S. Fearon E.R. Willson J.K. Vogelstein B. Science. 1990; 249: 912-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (1610) Google Scholar, 16.Mercer W.E. Shields M.T. Amin M. Sauve G.J. Appella E. Romano J.W. Ullrich S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6166-6170Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). The development of a wide range of malignant tumors is mediated by the mutational inactivation of p53 (17.Hollstein M. Sidransky D. Vogelstein B. Harris C.C. Science. 1991; 253: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (7479) Google Scholar). Similar to the p21Waf1 gene (18.El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1995; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (7957) Google Scholar), which is a well characterized p53 target gene that is directly involved in p53-dependent G1 cell cycle arrest (19.El-Deiry W.S. Harper J.W. O'Connor P.M. Velculescu V.E. Canman C.E. Jackman J. Pietenpol J.A. Burrell M. Hill D.E. Wang Y. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 1169-1174PubMed Google Scholar), there is a p53-binding site in the human IEX-1promoter. Schafer et al. (13.Schafer H. Trauzold A. Sebens T. Deppert W. Folsch U.R. Schmidt W.E. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2479-2487Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the p53-binding site in the p22 (IEX-1/Dif-2) promoter mediates transcriptional activation of p22 in a fashion similar to that observed for the p21Waf1 gene in HeLa and Hep3B cells. In this study, we have systematically examined the transcriptional elements that regulate IEX-1 gene expression in HaCaT keratinocytes. We demonstrate that the p53-binding site modulates the promoter activity of the IEX-1 gene in keratinocytes, but our evidence indicates that p53 functions as a transcriptional repressor rather than an activator of IEX-1. We also found that transcription factor Sp1, but not Sp3, is a transcriptional activator of the IEX-1 gene. We propose that p53 suppresses Sp1-dependent activation of IEX-1gene expression in keratinocytes. nuclear factor-κB glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase Human primary keratinocytes were isolated from neonatal foreskin specimens, and cell cultures were maintained in an undifferentiated replicative state by growth and passage at subconfluence in complete serum-free MCDB153 medium as previously described (20.Poumay Y. Pittelkow M.R. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 104: 271-276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Complete MCDB153 medium contains 0.1 mm calcium supplemented with 0.2% (v/v) bovine pituitary extract, 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, and 5 μg/ml insulin. Standard MCDB153 medium was prepared by excluding bovine pituitary extract, epidermal growth factor, and insulin from the culture medium. Cultures of autonomously growing human keratinocytes were prepared by washing cells propagated in complete medium with standard medium and refeeding subconfluent cell cultures with standard medium. HaCaT cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum as described (21.Boukamp P. Petrussevska R.T. Breitkreutz D. Hornung J. Markham A. Fusenig N.E. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 761-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (3493) Google Scholar). For transfection, cells were plated 24 h prior to transfection at a density of 1 × 106 cells/plate in six-well plates and transiently transfected with 1 μg ofIEX-1 promoter/firefly luciferase reporter gene constructs using 6 μl of FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The Renilla luciferase construct pRL-TK (100 ng; Promega) was included as an internal control for transfection efficiency. Cells were harvested 24 h post-transfection, and luciferase activity was assayed by the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system using a luminometer (Turner Designs, Sunnyvale, CA) following the accompanying instructions. All transfection experiments were repeated four or more times in duplicate, utilizing plasmids that were independently prepared at least twice. The IEX-1promoter construct −1419pIEX-1 fused into the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase report gene was kindly provided by Dr. Mira O. Jung (Georgetown University Medical Center, Washington, D. C.). The −1419pIEX-1 DNA fragment was fused into the firefly luciferase reporter gene plasmid (pGL3-Basic) at theKpnI and NheI restriction enzyme sites. For deletion mutagenesis, −575pIEX-1, −279pIEX-1, −200pIEX-1, −150pIEX-1, −110pIEX-1, and −70pIEX-1 PCR products were generated with sense and antisense primers containing appropriate restriction enzyme sites and template −1419pIEX-1 DNA. These PCR products were cloned into the pCR2.1-TOPO cloning vector using the TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen), followed by subcloning into the promoterless pGL3-Basic plasmid at the KpnI andNheI restriction enzyme sites. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). In brief, sense- and antisense-oriented primers complementary to each other and bearing SalI enzyme restriction sites were mixed with the template plasmid for generation of PCR products. This was followed by DpnI restriction enzyme digestion (37 °C for 3 h) to remove the template plasmid. The unmethylated PCR product was transformed intoEscherichia coli XL1-Blue competent cells (Stratagene) and selected on ampicillin (100 μg/ml)-agar plates. The DNA sequences of all constructs were verified by KpnI/NheI (IEX-1 promoter deletion constructs) or SalI (site-directed mutagenesis) restriction enzyme digestion, followed by dideoxy DNA sequencing using an automated sequencer and the dideoxy sequencing method of Sanger et al.

Reverse transcription-PCR for the construction of Sox18 (Sry-like HMG box-containing transcription factor) cDNA was performed using the ThermoScript reverse transcription-PCR system (Invitrogen) as described by the manufacturer. The Sox18 cDNA obtained by reverse transcription-PCR was gel-purified and cloned into the pCR2.1-TOPO cloning vector using the TOPO TA cloning kit following the instructions provided by the manufacturer. The coding sequence in the pCR2.1-TOPO cloning vector was separated from the vector DNA byEcoRI restriction enzyme digestion, followed by agarose gel purification of the cDNA fragment. The purified cDNA was subcloned into the EcoRI restriction enzyme site of the pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen). The resulting mammalian expression plasmid was verified by restriction enzyme digestion, and the orientation of the insert was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The primer set used for Sox18 reverse transcription-PCR is as follows: Sox18-f, 5′-CAT CAG ACC TCC GTA CTT GGC TTT GCA GTG-3′; and Sox18-r, 5′-TTA GCT TCT TCA CCA CCA ATC CTG GCA GAG-3′.

Other expression vectors for p53 and IκBα, a dominant-negative inhibitor of NF-κB, were purchased from CLONTECH. Poly(A)+ RNA isolation, Northern blotting, and hybridization were carried out using established methods as previously described (23.Im H.-J. Smirnov D. Yuhi T. Raghavan S. Olsson J.E. Muscat G.E.

To understand the cell growth regulatory mechanisms that control expression of the IEX-1 gene, we initiated studies to define the basal promoter, cis-acting elements, and cognate factors mediating IEX-1 gene transcription. A genomic DNA segment spanning ∼1.4 kb of the 5′-upstream region of the human IEX-1 promoter has previously been cloned (5.Kondratyev A.D. Chung K. Jung M.O. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1498-1502PubMed Google Scholar). The 5′-region of the human IEX-1 gene contains multiple putative recognition motifs for distinct classes of transcription factors and a TATA box sequence located 25 bp upstream from the transcription initiation site (Fig. 1). The multiplicity of consensus elements in the IEX-1 promoter may provide many combinatorial control to regulate IEX-1gene transcription. To address the contribution of distinct promoter segments toIEX-1 gene transcription, we transfected a series ofIEX-1 promoter deletion constructs fused to the firefly luciferase reporter gene into HaCaT and primary keratinocyte cells. Our results show that deletion of the promoter to bp −279 did not significantly affect transcriptional levels (Fig. 2). Subsequent deletion of the segment between bp −279 and −200 increased promoter activity by 2–3-fold in HaCaT cells, and this level of promoter activity was 50–200-fold higher than that of a promoterless reporter gene construct, pGL3-Basic. A relatively high basal level of transcription was retained with the −150 promoter deletion construct. Deletion of promoter sequences between bp −150 and −110 strongly reduced transcription by 3-fold. Further deletion of the promoter from bp −110 to −70 further reduced transcriptional activity, which remained severalfold higher than the background promoter activity observed with the promoterless luciferase construct (Fig. 2). Therefore, we conclude that the 5′-region of theIEX-1 gene contains a potent basal promoter region (bp −279 to +1) that encompasses a repressor element between bp −279 and −200. In addition, at least one strong activator region is noted between bp −150 and −110, and some modest transcriptional activity is conferred by a proximal region (bp −110 to +1). Similar results were obtained when the IEX-1 promoter deletion constructs were transiently transfected into human primary keratinocyte cells. To assess whether consensus elements for distinct classes of gene regulatory factors are capable of modulating IEX-1 gene expression, we used site-directed mutagenesis to incorporate a systematic series of point mutations into reporter gene constructs driven by the minimal functional IEX-1 promoter (bp −279 to +1). Site-directed mutagenesis of regulatory response elements of the IEX-1promoter was performed by replacing the core response element sequences with SalI restriction enzyme sites (see “Experimental Procedures”). We performed transient transfection analyses with this panel of mutant promoter/reporter gene constructs in HaCaT cells. One of the most striking results is that mutation of a putative recognition motif for the p53 tumor suppressor protein located in the −256/−237 region increased transcription by 3-fold (Fig. 3). This result suggests that the putative p53 motif represents a bona fide cis-acting element that apparently plays an important role as a transcriptional repressor. On the other hand, mutation of the Sp1/GC box consensus motif located in the −63/−55 region decreased basal promoter activity by at least 4-fold as shown in mutant constructs mSp1/−575, mSp1/−279, and mSp1/−150 (Fig. 3). Slight modifications of transcriptional effects were observed by mutating putative elements for p300 (mp300/−200;i.e. ∼40% reduction), Sox (mSox/−200; i.e.30% reduction), NF-κB (mNF-kB/−200 and mNF-kB/−150;i.e. 30% reduction), and AP4 (mAP4/−200; i.e.10∼15% reduction) (Fig. 3). However, forced expression of p300, various Sox proteins (Sox5, Sox6, Sox9, and Sox18), and the NF-κB dominant-negative inhibitor IκBα showed no significant increase in promoter activity (data not shown). These data indicate that there are at least two distinct negative and positive cis-acting elements in the human IEX-1 promoter, which coincide with consensus recognition motifs for p53 and Sp1, respectively. Expression of the human IEX-1 gene appears to be regulated by these two regulators. In addition, although individual mutation of the putative elements in the IEX-1 promoter region was not sufficient to show dramatic modification of promoter activity, promoter deletion analysis indicated that the combination of these putative elements may exert their effect on overall IEX-1 transcriptional activity. Apart from these findings, which indicate a role for p53 and Sp1 in the transcriptional control of the human IEX-1 gene, we also mutated a putative helix-loop-helix/E box located in the −185/−175 region (mE-box/−279). We observed that this mutation up-regulated IEX-1 promoter activity by at least 3-fold, thus raising the possibility of a role for this inhibitory protein in the regulation of IEX-1 gene expression (Fig. 3). Interestingly, however, deletion of the entire E box region (from bp −200 to −150) appeared to be quantitatively neutral for promoter activity (Fig. 2). This finding suggests that a compensatory positively acting factor, which is distinct from the HLH/E box protein, may functionally interact with the −200/−150 segment of theIEX-1 promoter region. In the remainder of our studies, we focused our investigation on the characterization of p53- and Sp1-related regulatory mechanisms. The −110 promoter deletion construct retains significant promoter activity and contains a perfect Sp1 consensus motif. To determine the specific role of Sp1 in the transcriptional regulation of IEX-1 gene expression, we cotransfected Sp1 or Sp3 expression vectors with IEX-1promoter plasmids and then analyzed the effect on IEX-1promoter activity. We found that Sp1, but not Sp3, selectively enhanced reporter gene expression (Fig. 4 A) and that coexpression of Sp3 and Sp1 did not decrease Sp1-dependent enhancement. The enhancement of IEX-1 promoter activity by Sp1 was observed even in the −110pIEX-1 deletion construct, in which most of the putative elements have been deleted, except for the AP4 and Sp1 motifs. Coexpression of Sp3 and Sp1 also did not show synergistic effects. These results indicate that Sp3 does not function as a dominant-negative inhibitor of Sp1 function, as a cofactor, or as a synergistic enhancer as has been observed for other genes such as the cell growth-regulated dihydrofolate reductase and opioid receptor genes (24.Birnbaum M.J. van Wijnen A.J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 27678-27685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Our results show that Sp1 stimulated IEX-1promoter activity in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 4 B), and this transcriptional enhancement was detected with the −279, −200, and −150 promoter deletion constructs. On the other hand, increased amounts of the pcDNA3.1 vector, which contains a cytomegalovirus promoter, failed to enhance the promoter activity of these deletion constructs (data not shown). We conclude that Sp1 is a rate-limiting element for IEX-1 promoter activity and functions via a site from bp −63 to −55 in the IEX-1promoter region. Sp1 site-directed mutation experiments demonstrated that this Sp1 mutation not only decreased promoter activity (Fig. 3), but also abolished Sp1-dependent activation ofIEX-1 promoter activity (Fig. 4 C). The results in Fig. 4 indicate that Sp1 is an important transactivator ofIEX-1 gene transcription. The inherent inhibitory function of the −279/−200 region, which contains a putative p53 recognition motif, is indicated by transient transfection analyses demonstrating that both deletion of this 79-bp DNA segment (Fig. 2) and mutation of the p53 consensus motif (Fig. 3) significantly up-regulatedIEX-1 promoter activity. To test the direct role of p53 in repression of IEX-1 gene transcription, we performed cotransfection experiments with a series of IEX-1 promoter deletion constructs and a wild-type p53 expression vector. We found that the −1419, −575, and −279 promoter deletion constructs were all responsive to forced expression of p53, as reflected by a 2-fold decrease in transcriptional activity (Fig. 5). In contrast, the −200, −150, −110, and −70 promoter deletion constructs, which lack the p53 motif, were not responsive (Fig. 5). Furthermore, the p53 site-directed mutant, which exhibited increased basal promoter activity, was not repressed by forced expression of p53. Taken together, these data establish that p53 inhibits IEX-1 promoter activity via a functional p53 response element located in the −279/−200 promoter region of theIEX-1 gene. Based on our findings that the IEX-1 gene contains transcriptional elements for both Sp1 and p53, we examined the possibility that these factors may controlIEX-1 gene transcription by molecular cross-talk involving direct protein/protein interactions. We performed transient coexpression experiments with p53 and Sp1 and assessed the effects onIEX-1 promoter activity (reporter construct −279pIEX-1). As shown in Fig. 6, Sp1 enhancement of basalIEX-1 promoter activity was significantly reduced when the cellular levels of p53 were elevated by forced expression. This result is reflected by a 5-fold activation of reporter gene expression by Sp1 in the absence of p53 expression and negligible activation by Sp1 in the presence of p53 expression (Fig. 6). Mutation of the proximal Sp1-binding site (bp −63 to −55) near the TATA box, which reduced basal promoter activity by 70% (Figs. 3 and 4), abolished Sp1-dependent activation; no p53-mediated suppression of Sp1 activity was evident. Mutation of the p53-binding site, which increased the basal promoter activity of the −279pIEX-1construct, abolished"
https://openalex.org/W2094315134,"RasGAP, a regulator of Ras GTPase family members, is cleaved at low levels of caspase activity into an N-terminal fragment (fragment N) that generates potent anti-apoptotic signals. At higher levels of caspase activity, fragment N is further cleaved into two fragments that strongly potentiate apoptosis. RasGAP could thus function as a sensor of caspase activity to determine whether a cell should survive or not. Here we show that fragment N protects cells by activating the Ras-PI3K-Akt pathway. Surprisingly, even though nuclear factor κB (NFκB) can be activated by Akt, it plays no role in the anti-apoptotic functions of fragment N. This indicates that Akt effectors are differentially regulated when fragment N is generated.

This indicates that Akt effectors are differentially regulated when fragment N is generated. Most, if not all, apoptotic responses rely on the activation of caspases, a family of cysteine-proteases that selectively cleave their substrates after aspartic residues (1.Nicholson D.W. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1028-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar, 2.Hengartner M.O. Nature. 2000; 407: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (6229) Google Scholar). The execution phase of apoptosis is triggered when the caspase substrates in a cell are cleaved. Dozens of caspase substrates have been identified and the list is growing steadily (3.Utz P.J. Anderson P. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 589-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 4.Earnshaw W.C. Martins L.M. Kaufmann S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 383-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (2438) Google Scholar). Once cleaved, caspase substrates mediate the biochemical and morphological events observed during apoptosis such as amplification of the activation of caspases, DNA fragmentation, nuclear breakdown, etc. In some cases, however, caspase activation does not result in cell death but may in fact participate in other cellular responses such as the regulation of cell differentiation (5.De Maria R. Zeuner A. Eramo A. Domenichelli C. Bonci D. Grignani F. Srinivasula S.M. Alnemri E.S. Testa U. Peschle C. Nature. 1999; 401: 489-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 6.Alam A. Cohen L.Y.

Widmann C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5346-5358Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). At low levels of caspase activity, RasGAP is cleaved at position 455, generating an N-terminal fragment (fragment N) and a C-terminal fragment (fragment C). Fragment C alone can induce apoptosis, but this response is completely inhibited by fragment N. Fragment N appears to be a general blocker of apoptosis downstream of caspase activation because it inhibits caspase 9-induced cell death. How fragment N mediates its protective effects is unknown. At higher levels of caspase activity, the ability of fragment N to counteract apoptosis is suppressed when it is cleaved at position 157. This latter cleavage event generates two fragments that, in contrast to fragment N, potently sensitize cells toward apoptosis. RasGAP could thus be viewed as an apoptostat in the sense that it can allow the cell to determine when caspases have been mildly activated to fulfill functions other than apoptosis or when caspases are strongly activated to mediate apoptosis.

GFP-GAPC encodes a fusion protein between GFP and fragment C of RasGAP (amino acids 456–1047) bearing an HA tag at the C-terminal end. N-D157A.dn3 encodes the HA-tagged version (at the N terminus) of a caspase-resistant form of fragment N (RasGAP sequences 1–455). These plasmids have been described previously (8.Yang J.-Y.

IκBαΔN2 encodes a mutant of IκBα that cannot be phosphorylated by IκK proteins and degraded by the proteasome and therefore functions as an inhibitor of NFκB. IκK2.vsv encodes the wild-type IκK2 protein. Raf-RBD.pgx (also called pGEX 2T-RBD) encodes a fusion protein between GST and amino acids 51–131 of the Ras binding domain of Raf1. Apoptosis was determined by scoring transfected cells (as assessed by the expression of GFP) displaying pyknotic nuclei (visualized with Hoechst 33342), as described previously (8.Yang J.-Y. Widmann C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5346-5358Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were starved for 16 h and then lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.2, 500 mm NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 100 μm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 tablet per 50 ml of a complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche, catalog no. 1.697.498)). 500 μg of total protein were then incubated with a 1:100 dilution of an anti-PI3K antibody in the presence of 40 μl of a 1:1 slurry of protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences catalog no. 17-0974-01) with gentle rocking overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with kinase buffer A (1× Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl)), 1% Nonidet P-40, 100 μm Na3VO4), three times with kinase buffer B (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 500 mm LiCl2, 100 μmNa3VO4), and three times with kinase buffer C (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 100 μmNa3VO4). The beads were then resuspended in 50 μl of kinase buffer C without Na3VO4, 10 μl of 100 mm MgCl2, 10 μl of phosphatidylinositol (2 mg/ml in Tris-HCl, pH 7.5), and 1 mm EGTA together with 10 μl of 440 μm ATP containing 20 μCi of 32P-ATP. This mixture was then incubated for 10 min at room temperature. The reaction was terminated with the addition of 20 μl of 8 n HCl. The lipids were extracted by adding 160 μl of CHCl3/MeOH (1:1) and centrifuged for 10 min at 13,000 × g. Fifty μl of the lower organic phase were harvested and loaded onto a TLC plate (silica gel 60, glass support, 20 × 20 cm, Sigma catalog no. Z 29 2974) that had been pretreated with 1% potassium oxalate in H2O/MeOH (3:2). The plates were then developed in CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O/NH4OH (60:47:11.3:2) for 2 h and then visualized by autoradiography. HeLa cells were starved and lysed as described for the in vitro PI3K assay. Akt kinase activity was measured using a kit from Upstate Biotechnology (catalog no. 06–195) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were lysed in mono Q-c buffer as described previously (8.Yang J.-Y. Widmann C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5346-5358Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). For the Western blot analysis using anti-phospho Akt or anti-phospho-ERK antibodies, the cells were lysed in RIPA buffer. Western blotting was performed as described (11.Widmann C. Dolci W. Thorens B. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 203-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) using a homemade ECL reagent (8.Yang J.-Y. Widmann C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5346-5358Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). To improve the signal in some experiments, an enhanced ECL solution (SuperSignal® West Femto maximum sensitivity substrate from Pierce, catalog no. 34095) was mixed with the homemade reagent. The fusion protein encoding GST and amino acids 51–131 of c-Raf1 was isolated as described previously (12.de Rooij J. Bos J.L. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 623-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Briefly, Raf-RBD.pgx-transformed bacteria were incubated with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 2 h at 37 °C and sonicated on ice six times for 1 min in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 μm aprotinin, 1 μm leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 1% and, after gently stirring for 30 min at 4 °C, glycerol was added to a final concentration of 10%. The lysate was aliquoted and stored at −80 °C until used (but no more than 4 weeks). The desired amount of crude GST-Ras binding domain of Raf (RBD) was thawed and incubated with glutathione-agarose beads at room temperature for 30 min. The beads were isolated by centrifugation and washed three times with RIPA buffer. Cells from a 10-cm dish were lysed and scraped in 1 ml of RIPA buffer containing 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.1 μm aprotinin, 1 μm leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at 4 °C. Lysates were centrifuged for 8 min at 12,000 ×g in an Eppendorf centrifuge to remove nuclei. GST-RBD precoupled to glutathione-agarose beads in RIPA buffer was added to the lysates and incubated with gentle rocking at 4 °C for 60 min. Beads were collected by centrifugation, washed three times with RIPA buffer, and resuspended in sample buffer (10% glycerol, 60 mmTris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 300 mm β-mercaptoethanol). The protein samples were separated on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and subsequently transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane for Western blotting analysis using a Ras-specific monoclonal antibody. NFκB activity was measured using a luciferase reporting assay, as described previously (13.Bonvin C. Guillon A. van Bemmelen M.X. Gerwins P. Johnson G.L. Widmann C. Cell. Signal. 2002; 14: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The cleavage of RasGAP by caspases at position 455 occurs at very low caspase activity (8.Yang J.-Y. Widmann C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5346-5358Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The resulting N-terminal fragment generates potent anti-apoptotic signals. However, as caspase activity increases, fragment N is cleaved at position 157 (8.Yang J.-Y. Widmann C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5346-5358Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The fragments resulting from this cleavage event strongly sensitize cells toward apoptosis (8.Yang J.-Y. Widmann C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5346-5358Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Therefore, to specifically study the anti-apoptotic function of fragment N in the present study we have used a mutant of fragment N bearing an aspartate to alanine substitution at position 457 that cannot be further cleaved by caspases (8.Yang J.-Y. Widmann C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5346-5358Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Because RasGAP is a regulator of Ras and Rho (14.Campbell S.L. Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K.L. Clark G.J. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1395-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar), we assessed whether these small GTP-binding proteins are required for the protective effects mediated by fragment N. As shown in Fig. 1 A, a dominant negative mutant of Ras (N17Ras) but not a dominant negative mutant of Rho (N19Rho) totally blocked the ability of fragment N to inhibit fragment C-induced apoptosis. Rho has recently been shown to be required for the ability of V12Ras, a constitutively active form of Ras, to activate the ERK MAPK (15.Li W. Chong H. Guan K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34728-34737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis using phospho-ERK-specific antibodies on lysates from HeLa cells transfected with V12Ras in the presence or absence of N19Rho demonstrated that N19Rho prevented the ability of V12Ras to induce ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 1 B). This demonstrates that N19Rho functions as a specific Rho inhibitor in our experimental system. The data presented in Fig. 1, A andB indicate that blocking Ras, but not Rho, prevents fragment N from being anti-apoptotic. A pull-down assay employing the Ras binding domain of Raf fused to GST was used to determine whether fragment N can activate Ras. GST-RBD only binds to the active GTP-bound form of Ras and the amount of active Ras bound to GST-RBD can be measured by quantitative Western blot analysis using Ras-specific antibodies (12.de Rooij J. Bos J.L. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 623-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 C shows that fragment N activates Ras either in the presence or absence of fragment C (fragment C alone had no significant effect on Ras activity by itself). Together with the observation that an active form of Ras, V12Ras, can mimic fragment N-induced inhibition of apoptosis (8.Yang J.-Y. Widmann C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5346-5358Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), the results presented in Fig. 1 demonstrate that Ras activation is necessary and sufficient to mediate fragment N-induced protection. Several pathways are activated by Ras, some of them with known anti-apoptotic functions (16.Downward J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). To assess which Ras-dependent pathways could be involved in the protective effect mediated by fragment N, constitutively activated Ras mutants that preferentially activate a subset of the Ras effector pathways (G12V/T35S Ras for the ERK MAPK pathway, G12V/Y40C for PI3K-dependent pathways, and G12V/E37G for RalGDS-dependent pathways) (14.Campbell S.L. Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K.L. Clark G.J. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1395-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar, 17.Peyssonnaux C. Provot S. Felder-Schmittbuhl M.P. Calothy G. Eychene A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7068-7079Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) were tested for their ability to block fragment C-induced apoptosis. G12V/Y40C Ras was the only mutant that inhibited fragment C-induced apoptosis with the same potency as activated Ras (V12Ras) (Fig. 2). G12V/T35S partially blocked apoptosis but only in conditions leading to the highest expression levels. G12V/E37G Ras had no protective effect. These results suggest that the activation of PI3K-dependent pathways could mediate fragment N-induced anti-apoptotic functions. Fig. 3 A shows that fragment N induces PI3K activation in the absence or in the presence of fragment C. The SH2 domain of the p85 regulatory PI3K subunit, which functions as a dominant negative mutant, totally blocked the ability of fragment N to inhibit fragment C-induced apoptosis (Fig. 3 B). Moreover, a constitutively active form of PI3K, p110CAAX, mimicked the ability of fragment N to inhibit fragment C-induced apoptosis (Fig. 3 C). Activation of PI3K is thus necessary and sufficient to mediate fragment N-induced protection. The activation of Akt has been shown to promote cell survival in many systems (18.Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3711) Google Scholar). Because Akt can be activated by PI3K, we determined whether it could participate in the anti-apoptotic response induced by fragment N. Using an in vitro Akt kinase assay (Fig. 4 A) or a Western blot analysis using antibodies that recognize the activated form of Akt (Fig. 4 B), we observed that fragment N led to Akt activation whether or not fragment C was present. A kinase-dead Akt mutant inhibited, in a dose-dependent manner, the ability of fragment N to block fragment C-induced apoptosis (Fig. 4 C). The addition of the src myristoylation sequence to Akt renders it constitutively active (18.Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3711) Google Scholar). This Akt construct mimicked the protective function of fragment N (Fig. 4 D). Akt activation is thus necessary and sufficient to mediate fragment N-induced protection. Different mechanisms can be used by Akt to protect cells from apoptosis, including the activation of NFκB, the inhibition of caspase 9, the inhibition of Bad, and the inhibition of specific transcription factors (Forkhead, Nur77) (18.Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3711) Google Scholar, 19.Masuyama N. Oishi K. Mori Y. Ueno T. Takahama Y. Gotoh Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32799-32805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). We determined whether NFκB could be involved in the Akt-dependent protection mediated by fragment N. Fig. 5 A shows that fragment N weakly stimulated NFκB activity (about 3-fold over basal; in four other independent experiments fragment N stimulated NFκB by only 1.04–1.8-fold). In comparison, MEKK1, a potent activator of NFκB when overexpressed in cells (13.Bonvin C. Guillon A. van Bemmelen M.X. Gerwins P. Johnson G.L. Widmann C. Cell. Signal. 2002; 14: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 20.Hirano M. Osada S. Aoki T. Hirai S. Hosaka M. Inoue J. Ohno S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13234-13238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 21.Lee F.S. Hagler J. Chen Z.J. Maniatis T. Cell. 1997; 88: 213-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar), was about 10 times more effective than fragment N in stimulating NFκB (Fig. 5 A). To determine whether the weak activation of NFκB induced by fragment N is required for its ability to block fragment C-induced apoptosis, HeLa cells were transfected with fragment C and/or fragment N in the presence of increasing amounts of a plasmid encoding the NFκB inhibitor IκBαΔN2. As expected, IκBαΔN2 strongly reduced NFκB activity (Fig. 5 B, upper panel). However, the inhibitor did not affect the ability of fragment N to block fragment C-induced apoptosis (Fig. 5 B,lower panel). It could be argued that, in HeLa cells, the NFκB pathway is not able to induce protective signals. This is not the case, because blocking NFκB activity with IκBαΔN2 induces cell death in tumor necrosis factor α-treated HeLa cells (Fig. 5 C), and because activating NFκB by overexpression of IκK2 protected cells from fragment C-induced apoptosis (Fig. 5 D). This demonstrates that NFκB can protect HeLa cells from apoptosis, including the apoptotic response induced by fragment C (see also Ref. 22.Liu Z.-G. Hsu H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1779) Google Scholar). Therefore, despite a functional anti-apoptotic NFκB pathway in HeLa cells, the protection induced by fragment N, which is Akt-dependent, does not operate through the activation of NFκB. The observation that fragment N stimulates Akt without a concomitant NFκB activation suggests that fragment N is able to inhibit the ability of Akt to activate NFκB. To test this hypothesis, HeLa cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding a constitutively active form of Akt (myr-Akt) in the presence of increasing quantities of a fragment N-encoding plasmid. Fig. 6shows that fragment N was able to inhibit, in a dose-dependent manner, the activation of NFκB induced by Akt. This inhibitory effect was specific for Akt because the activation of NFκB mediated by MEKK1 was not decreased by fragment N. Western blot experiments showed that the levels of expression of myr-Akt or MEKK1 were unaffected by the increased expression of fragment N (data not shown). This result indicates therefore that fragment N does not have a broad NFκB inhibitory effect. Fig. 7 shows that dominant negative forms of Ras, PI3K, and Akt inhibited the ability of fragment N to block apoptosis induced by low doses of caspase 9. Therefore, fragment N inhibits apoptosis mediated by apoptotic inducers other than fragment C, and this also occurs via the Ras-PI3K-Akt pathway. The activation of caspases in a cell generally results in apoptosis. There are, however, exceptions to this rule. For example, caspases stimulated by activated death receptors participate in the negative regulation of erythropoiesis by cleaving GATA-1, a transcription factor required for the differentiation of mature erythroblasts, and this occurs in the apparent absence of any apoptotic response (5.De Maria R. Zeuner A. Eramo A. Domenichelli C. Bonci D. Grignani F. Srinivasula S.M. Alnemri E.S. Testa U. Peschle C. Nature. 1999; 401: 489-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). In peripheral blood lymphocytes, caspase 8 and caspase 3 are activated upon stimulation. Blocking caspase activity inhibits proliferation, major histocompatibility class II expression, and blastic transformation of these cells (6.Alam A. Cohen L.Y. Aouad S. Sekaly R.P. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1879-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Similarly, the activation of caspase 8 is required for CD3-induced proliferation and IL2 production by human T cells (7.Kennedy N.J. Kataoka T. Tschopp J. Budd R.C. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1891-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). These data indicate that caspase activation occurs in viable cells, and this appears to be involved in physiological responses different from apoptosis. A corollary to the above observations is that specific protective pathways must be activated in viable cells having activated their caspases to fulfill functions different than apoptosis. These protective pathways need now to be characterized. Caspase activation with no associated death response is not only observed in cells from the hematopoietic lineage. We have recently shown that in mild stress conditions HeLa cells displayed increased caspase 3-like activity. Despite this caspase activation, the cells did not undergo apoptosis. RasGAP is cleaved in these conditions, and this generates an N-terminal fragment (fragment N) with potent anti-apoptotic functions (8.Yang J.-Y. Widmann C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5346-5358Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). HeLa cells are protected from cell death as long as fragment N is not further cleaved, which abrogates its anti-apoptotic functions and generates two new pro-apoptotic RasGAP N-terminal peptides (fragments N1 and N2). The second cleavage of RasGAP only occurs at high levels of caspase activity (8.Yang J.-Y. Widmann C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5346-5358Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The first cleavage of RasGAP into fragment N could thus represent an important safeguard mechanism to protect cells from apoptosis resulting from caspase activation induced by mild stress or in physiological responses needing some kind of caspase activation. In the present study we have determined that the upstream anti-apoptotic pathway activated by fragment N employs the Ras, PI3K, and Akt proteins. These proteins are necessary and sufficient to mediate the protective function of fragment N because 1) the corresponding dominant negative mutants totally abrogated the anti-apoptotic abilities of fragment N; 2) constitutively activated mutants of Ras, PI3K, and Akt mimicked the protective effect of fragment N; and 3) fragment N induces the activation of Ras, PI3K, and Akt. How fragment N induces Ras activity is currently not understood. It is possible that the SH3 domain borne by fragment N is involved because a monoclonal antibody specific for the SH3 domain of RasGAP inhibits downstream signals initiated by oncogenic Ras. (23.Pomerance M. Thang M.N. Tocque B. Pierre M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3179-3186Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 24.Duchesne M. Schweighoffer F. Parker F. Clerc F. Frobert Y. Thang M.N. Tocque B. Science. 1993; 259: 525-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). However, because these studies used constitutively active forms of Ras, it does not provide any information on how the SH3 domain of RasGAP could activate Ras. Several proteins interact with the N-terminal domain of RasGAP such as the PDGF receptor, p190 RhoGAP, huntingtin, Dok proteins, and Src (and other tyrosine kinases) (25.Kazlauskas A. Ellis C.

Chem. 1995; 270: 14718-14724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). It is currently not known whether any of these is required for fragment N to stimulate Ras activity. A major anti-apoptotic factor activated by the Ras-PI3K-Akt pathway is NFκB (33.Beg A.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2931) Google Scholar, 34.Van Antwerp D.J. Martin S.J. Verma I.M. Green D.R. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 107-111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 35.Foo S.Y. Nolan G.P. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 229-235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, NFκB was not required for fragment N to protect cells despite the fact that the NFκB pathway can mediate anti-apoptotic responses in HeLa cells (e.g. upon TNFα stimulation). In fact, although Akt activity was stimulated by fragment N, this did not result in a significant transcription of NFκB-driven reporter genes. This is due to the fact that fragment N inhibits the ability of activated Akt to stimulate NFκB. Fragment N, however, is not a general blocker of NFκB activation because it did not hamper MEKK1 from activating NFκB. Fragment N seems thus to inhibit only a subset of the signaling pathways that activate NFκB. G3BP2, a close relative to the RasGAP SH3-binding protein G3BP1, sequesters IκBα/NFκB complexes in the cytoplasm, thereby preventing NFκB to exert its transcriptional activity in the nucleus (36.Prigent M. Barlat I. Langen H. Dargemont C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36441-36449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). An interesting hypothesis is that fragment N, which bears the SH3 domain of RasGAP, uses G3BP2 to prevent NFκB from reaching the nucleus even when Akt is activated. Because fragment N does not use NFκB to mediate its protective functions, it must use alternative mechanisms. These could include inactivation by phosphorylation of pro-apoptotic proteins such as caspase 9, forkhead proteins, or Bad (18.Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3711) Google Scholar). Indeed, fragment N seems to induce the phosphorylation of Bad on serine 136, 2J. -Y. Yang and C. Widmann, unpublished results. indicating that Bad inactivation is a potential mechanism by which fragment N blocks apoptosis. In summary, our findings indicate that fragment N utilizes the Ras-PI3K-Akt signaling pathway to protect cells from apoptosis. Despite stimulating Akt activity, fragment N does not allow the Akt effector NFκB to exert its transcriptional activity. This indicates that effector proteins of the Ras-PI3K-Akt pathway can be differently modulated in the presence or absence of RasGAP caspase cleavage fragments. Fragment N adds an additional level of complexity in the way the Ras-PI3K-Akt pathway is modulated.

However, slippage of the pump and lower coupling ratios are observed in steady state. Slippage depends on the presence of high Ca2+ in the lumen of SR vesicles and high nucleotide in the medium. Thereby, Ca2+and/or nucleotide-bound phosphoenzyme intermediates accumulate and undergo uncoupled cleavage, before vectorial translocation of bound Ca2+ in the forward direction of the cycle or before productive reversal to ATP synthesis. Transport efficiency and coupling ratios are improved by reduction of nucleotide concentration in the presence of ATP regenerating systems and/or complexation of luminal Ca2+ with phosphate or oxalate. Curcumin (1–5 μm) lowers the concentration of phosphate or oxalate required to reduce slippage of the Ca2+ pump. Thereby, under appropriate conditions, curcumin favors kinetic flow, completion of productive cycles, and improvement of coupling ratios. The findings obtained with isolated SR vesicles suggest that slippage is an important phenomenon under prevailing conditions of muscle fibersin situ. Ca2+ transport and its slippage can be improved by curcumin in cardiac as well as in skeletal SR, raising the possibility of pharmacological interventions to correct defective Ca2+ homeostasis.

Translocation of 2 Ca2+ per catalytic cycle occurs during the initial cycles following addition of substrate (1.Verjovski-Almeida S. Kurzmack M. Inesi G. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 5006-5013Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), consistent with the binding stoichiometry of 2 Ca2+per ATPase molecule (2.Inesi G. Kurzmack M. Coan C. Lewis D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3025-3031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the Ca2+/ATP coupling ratios are considerably lower in steady state, a phenomenon initially attributed to leakage of transported Ca2+. On the other hand, it was later demonstrated that the catalytic and transport cycle can undergo significant slippage through branched reactions, resulting in lower coupling ratios (3.Yu X. Inesi G.

We report here a series of experiments with vesicular fragments of skeletal SR, defining experimental conditions and catalytic intermediates that are involved in the occurrence of slippage. We characterize reduction of slippage and improvement of Ca2+transport by curcumin at low concentrations, as well as inhibition of overall ATPase and Ca2+ transport by curcumin at higher concentrations. Finally, we extend our experimentation to cardiac SR, exploring the possible relevance of transport slippage and its correction to Ca2+ homeostasis of muscle fibersin situ. sarcoplasmic reticulum 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid 2′-(or 3′)-O-(trinitrophenyl)adenosine-5′-monophosphate, sodium salt thapsigargin Vesicular fragments of longitudinal SR were obtained from rabbit skeletal muscle as described previously (8.Eletr S. Inesi G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 282: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). A similar preparation was obtained from adult rat hearts, subjecting 4.5 g of ventricular muscle to disruption in a Fisher Scientific PowerGen 700 tissue homogenizer, three times for 30 s. The homogenization medium (10 ml) was ice-cold and contained 20 mm MOPS, pH 7, 10% sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, with freshly added protease inhibitors (0.4 mm Pefabloc, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). The homogenate was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 20 min, the resulting supernatant centrifuged at 45,000 ×g for 30 min, and the final pellet resuspended in 20 mm MOPS, pH 7, 30% sucrose, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors as indicated above. [45Ca]Ca2+ transport was assayed by filtration at serial times following the addition of ATP (9.Inesi G. Asai H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1968; 126: 469-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). ATPase activity was followed either by colorimetric determination of Pi release (10.Lanzetta P.A. Alvarez L.J. Reinach P.S. Candia O.A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1819) Google Scholar) or by measuring release of [32P]Pi from [γ-32P]ATP (5.de Meis L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25078-25087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) or by an enzyme-coupled assay (3.Yu X. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4361-4367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Phosphoenzyme intermediate was determined by incorporation of [γ-32P]ATP terminal phosphate onto the ATPase protein, and the time course of its cleavage was observed following a chase with nonradioactive ATP (11.Sumbilla C. Cavagna M. Zhong L.L. Ma H.L. Lewis D. Farrance I. Inesi G. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: H2381-H2391PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphoenzyme intermediate was also obtained by incorporation of [32P]Pi in the absence of Ca2+, through the reverse direction of the ATPase reaction (12.Masuda H. de Meis L. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 4581-4585Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Rapid kinetic measurements of phosphoenzyme formation, Ca2+translocation, and Pi production were obtained by rapid mixing in a Froehlich-Berger chemical quench-flow apparatus, as described by Fernandez-Belda et al. (13.Fernandez-Belda F. Kurzmack M. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9687-9698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ATP-ADP exchange was determined by measuring incorporation of [3H]ADP into ATP (9.Inesi G. Asai H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1968; 126: 469-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Following incubation in the medium specified in the legend for Fig. 1B, the reaction was stopped by the addition of thapsigargin (1 μm), and the mixture was filtered through a Nalgene 0.2-μm filter. The filtered medium (0.8 ml) was loaded on a 25-cm Whatman Partisil-10 SAX column and the nucleotides eluted by high performance liquid chromatography with a gradient from 0.04 mKH2PO4, pH 2.8, to 0.5 mKH2PO4, 0.8 m KCl, pH 2.7. The nucleotide elution peaks were detected by light absorption and the radioactivity measured by scintillation counting. [γ-32P]ATP and [3H]ADP were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, curcumin from ICN Pharmaceuticals (Costa Mesa, CA), and all the other reagents from Sigma. Steady state kinetic calculations were based on controlled rate constants and concentrations of substrate, ligands, and products, as described previously (14.Inesi G. Kurzmack M. Lewis D. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 154-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Computations were performed on a PC microcomputer, using 14-digit precision MEGABASIC with BCD coding (American Planning Corp., Alexandria, VA). Copies of the computation programs can be obtained from M. Kurzmack ([email protected]). It is shown in Fig. 1A that, in the millisecond time scale, addition of ATP to SR vesicles preincubated with Ca2+ is followed by rapid enzyme phosphorylation, and internalization of bound Ca2+ (i.e. unavailable for exchange with medium Ca2+) with a stoichiometric ratio of two per phosphoenzyme molecule. Following a lag period, hydrolytic cleavage of Pi occurs, allowing further catalytic and transport cycles. This pre-steady state measurements confirm those reported previously (13.Fernandez-Belda F. Kurzmack M. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9687-9698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and are shown here as a term of comparison with measurements extended to a longer time scale. In fact, SR vesicles reach asymptotic levels of Ca2+ filling after 60–90 s of reaction. ATP consumption, however, does not cease in parallel with Ca2+ uptake, thereby resulting in unproductive ATP consumption (Fig. 1B). ATPase activity ceases only if the Ca2+ concentration in the medium is lowered below the activating level by the addition of EGTA (Fig. 1B) or the enzyme is inactivated by addition of the specific inhibitor thapsigargin (Fig. 1B). The experiments shown in Fig. 1 were performed in the absence of calcium sequestering anions (see below). Therefore, the maximal Ca2+ uptake level shown in Fig. 1B corresponds to a high (mm) concentration of free Ca2+ in the lumen of the vesicles. It should be noted that when the ATPase was inactivated by addition of TG, passive leakage of accumulated Ca2+ was minimal (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, upon addition of EGTA, the release of accumulated Ca2+ by reversal of the pump was quite slow, due to lack of ADP (Fig. 1B). Therefore, the observed Pi production, in excess of Ca2+ transport, was actually due to slippage of the pump, i.e. hydrolysis of ATP that is dissociated or uncoupled from Ca2+ transport. As observed in early studies (15.Makinose M. Hasselbach W. Biochem. Z. 1965; 343: 360-382PubMed Google Scholar), the efficiency (i.e.stoichiometric ratio of Ca2+ transport and ATP hydrolysis) of steady state Ca2+ transport is improved by the addition of phosphate or oxalate to the reaction mixture (Fig. 2, A and B). This is due to buffering of luminal Ca2+ by these anions, when the Ca2+ concentration in the lumen of the SR vesicles reaches their binding constants (and solubility products) following active transport. Thereby, the level of Ca2+ uptake is very much increased, and in the presence of optimal oxalate concentrations, a Ca2+/ATP coupling ratio of 2 can be observed for a longer time (i.e. minute time scale), before asymptotic levels of Ca2+ accumulation are reached. These experiments indicate that a rise of luminal Ca2+ is an important factor in determining slippage of the pump. Another important variable is the presence of ADP. It is shown in Fig. 3 that when ADP is added, net Ca2+ uptake is quite reduced (Fig. 3, A andB). In this case, the reduction of net Ca2+uptake is due, at least in part, to Ca2+ efflux by reversal of the pump rather than slippage (5.de Meis L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25078-25087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Interestingly, however, ATP hydrolysis (as indicated by release of [32P]Pi from ATP) remains approximately the same, indicating the occurrence of slippage. It is useful, at this point, to evaluate the effects of luminal Ca2+ and medium ADP in the light of the reaction sequence commonly used for the catalytic and transport cycle of the SR ATPase. In Scheme 1 the enzyme (E) is activated by binding of two medium (i.e. cytosolic) Ca2+, and then ATP is utilized to formE1∼PCa2. This intermediate undergoes isomerization toE2-P·Ca2+, allowing release of bound Ca2+ into the lumen of SR and hydrolytic cleavage ofE-P. The sequence shown by the solid lines in Scheme 1 implies that the Ca2+/ATP coupling ratio is 2 under all conditions. Slippage can then be intuitively attributed to Ca2+ and ADP-dependent accumulation and hydrolytic cleavage of the ADP·E1∼P·Ca2 intermediate. To demonstrate the presence, and evaluate the role of the ADP·E1∼P·Ca2 intermediate, we measured ADP/ATP exchange, which occurs by reversal of Reaction 3 in Scheme 1. We found that, when ADP is added (as required to perform the measurements), exchange occurs at a rate 3-fold higher than that of hydrolytic cleavage of Pi. Nearly identical results are obtained when luminal Ca2+ is raised by active transport and when net Ca2+ accumulation is prevented by addition of ionophore (Fig. 4). This indicates that the reverse rate constant for Reaction 3 is faster than the forward constant. For this reason, as well as for rapid forward isomerization, the steady state level of ADP·E1∼P·Ca2 is low in most cases. It does not seem likely, then, that this intermediate would be utilized significantly through futile cycles (dashed line in Scheme 1), as compared with productive (i.e. ATP synthesis) reversal of Reaction 3 (solid line). This issue will be considered again under “Discussion.” Another interesting finding is that, if accumulation of ADP is prevented with an ATP regenerating system at either high or low ATP, slippage is reduced and the efficiency of Ca2+ transport is improved when the ATP concentration is low (Fig. 5, A and B). Therefore, high concentrations of ATP (above the Kmrange) favor slippage. In fact, it was shown by fast kinetic measurements that a chase with mm ATP doubles the rate of hydrolytic cleavage of phosphoenzyme already made by utilization of μmol ATP (16.Verjovski-Almeida S. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 18-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pi ⇌ HOH exchange measurements indicate that this effect is due to increased access of the phosphoenzyme to medium water (17.McIntosh D.B. Boyer P.D. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 2867-2875Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). It is likely that this effect of secondary binding is also produced by ADP or pseudosubstrates such as TNP-AMP. It was reported by Logan-Smithet al. (7.Logan-Smith M.J. Lockyer P.J. East J.M. Lee A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46905-46911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) that Ca2+ transport is increased up to 20% by curcumin within the 1–10 μm concentration range and then is inhibited by higher curcumin concentrations. On the other hand, ATPase activity is slightly increased by 1–3 μm curcumin and then inhibited by higher curcumin concentrations. We confirmed these findings (Fig. 6) and then found that Ca2+transport enhancement by curcumin is very much dependent on the concentration of KH2PO4 or oxalate used to enhance transport (Fig. 7). The effect is maximal at low anion concentrations, while no effect is noted at saturating anion concentrations. In fact, a surprisingly large (4–5-fold) increase in Ca2+ transport is produced by 5 μm curcumin in the presence of 5 mmKH2PO4 or 0.5 mm oxalate (Fig. 7). Under the same conditions, the ATPase activity is only slightly affected, demonstrating an unexpectedly large reduction of slippage by curcumin (Fig. 8). It is then apparent that curcumin lowers the anion concentration required for improvement of Ca2+ transport, possibly facilitating transmembrane anion diffusion concomitant with Ca2+ transport.Figure 7Phosphate and oxalate concentration dependence of Ca2+ transport enhancement by curcumin.The reaction was started by the addition of 1 mm ATP to a reaction mixture as described for Fig. 1B, except for the presence of 5 μm curcumin when indicated.

Temperature: 25 °C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We found that this effect of curcumin is also produced on cardiac SR vesicles. In fact, Ca2+ transport in the presence of 10 mm KH2PO4 is increased by 5 μm curcumin (Fig. 9A), while curcumin is slightly inhibitory when the KH2PO4concentration is raised to its optimal level of 50 mm (Fig. 9B). We then proceeded to characterize the inhibition of both ATPase activity and transport, which is produced by higher curcumin concentrations (Fig. 6). We found that this effect is characterized by a strong reduction of phosphoenzyme formation, as revealed by direct measurement of phosphoenzyme (Fig. 10), and by a reduction of ADP/ATP exchange (not shown). The enzyme levels obtained in the presence of ATP and Ca2+ are reduced by 40 or 90% in the presence of 5 or 30 μm curcumin, respectively (Fig. 10). On the other hand, phosphoenzyme formed in the absence or in the presence of curcumin undergoes exponential decay at approximately the same rate (0.4–0.6 s−1, at 3 °C). In parallel experiments on formation of phosphoenzyme by utilization of Pi in the absence of Ca2+, we found 49 and 86% inhibition in the presence of 5 or 30 μm curcumin, respectively. Therefore, the overall inhibitory effect of curcumin involves both utilization of ATP in the presence of Ca2+and utilization of Pi in the absence of Ca2+. Experimental evidence obtained in our own (3.Yu X. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4361-4367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and other laboratories (4.Fortea M.I. Soler F. Fernandez-Belda F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12521-12529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 5.de Meis L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25078-25087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) indicates that slippage of the pump occurs when the concentration of luminal Ca2+ is high, thereby raising the steady state level phosphoenzyme intermediates undergoing unproductive cleavage (Scheme 1). We attempt here to distinguish various phosphoenzyme species that may undergo hydrolytic cleavage through an unproductive cycle, rather than completing productive cycles in the forward or reverse direction of the pump. It is shown in Scheme 2 that the enzyme (E) is activated through sequential and cooperative binding of 2 Ca2+ and a related conformational change (E toE′). Utilization of ATP then yields a phosphorylated intermediate, which produces lower affinity and vectorial dissociation of bound Ca2+, followed by hydrolytic cleavage of Pi. Note that isomerization of E′∼P toE-P denotes loss of phosphorylation potential, which is utilized to reduce the Ca2+ binding affinity. It also denotes transformation of a state favoring phosphoryl transfer to a state favoring hydrolytic cleavage of Pi. The sequence of reactions and their kinetic constants allow calculations of steady state levels of intermediates, in the presence of various concentrations of ligands (14.Inesi G. Kurzmack M. Lewis D. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 154-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). It is shown in Table I that theE′-PCa2, E′-PCa, and E-PCa rise when the luminal Ca2+ concentration is raised, and ADPE′-PCa2 rises when ADP is increased. Assuming that these intermediates can undergo hydrolysis, a rise of their levels will produce Pi cleavage without translocation of bound Ca2+. In fact, it was already shown (15.Makinose M. Hasselbach W. Biochem. Z. 1965; 343: 360-382PubMed Google Scholar) that binding of Ca2+ or/and ADP is followed by rapid decay of phosphoenzyme obtained by utilization of Pi in the absence of Ca2+ (i.e. E-P). Depending on the experimental conditions, a variable fraction of this phosphoenzyme yields ATP through productive reverse cycling and the remaining undergoes hydrolytic cleavage (18.de Meis L. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 1289-1294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is also known that enzyme phosphorylation by Pi is much increased when the concentration of luminal Ca2+ is high (19.Beil F.U. von Chak D. Hasselbach W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 81: 151-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), demonstrating the reversible cleavage and phosphorylation ofE-PCa2.Table ISteady state levels of enzyme intermediates during utilization of ATP by the Ca2+ ATPaseCa2+ADPEECaE′CaE′Ca2ATPE′Ca25010.110.390.0090.0041.02500010.040.160.0040.0020.45501000.110.370.0090.0051.5050001000.020.070.0020.0041.65Ca2+ADPADPE′∼P · Ca2ADPE′-P · Ca2E′∼P · Ca2E′-P Ca2E′-P Ca5010.120.301.310.140.29500010.050.151.650.890.49501000.210.740.370.050.1050001000.281.350.550.390.21Ca2+ADPE-P · CaE-PEPiEPV5010.170.950.183.28546.18500010.650.390.084.27018.82501000.060.330.062.62815.8350001000.280.170.033.2278.17The intermediates are those listed in Scheme 2. ΣEP is the total level of phosphorylated intermediate, and V is the velocity (nanomole/milligram/second) of Pi production coupled to transport (2 Ca2+/Pi). ATP is assumed to be 1 mm and medium Ca2+ is 50 μm. ADP and luminal Ca2+ are specified in the table. Total E is assumed to be 5 nmol/mg of protein (as observed experimentally in skeletal SR vesicles), and the intermediate levels are given in nanomole/milligram. Open table in a new tab The intermediates are those listed in Scheme 2. ΣEP is the total level of phosphorylated intermediate, and V is the velocity (nanomole/milligram/second) of Pi production coupled to transport (2 Ca2+/Pi). ATP is assumed to be 1 mm and medium Ca2+ is 50 μm. ADP and luminal Ca2+ are specified in the table. Total E is assumed to be 5 nmol/mg of protein (as observed experimentally in skeletal SR vesicles), and the intermediate levels are given in nanomole/milligram. Under steady state conditions, as the level of Ca2+- and/or ADP-bound phosphoenzyme rises, the level of E-P (i.e. unloaded phosphoenzyme) decreases, with consequent reduction of productive cleavage. In fact, the velocity of each reaction depends on its rate constant and the related intermediate level. Note that ADP/ATP exchange is dependent on ATPE′Ca2 and ADPE′∼PCa2. The levels of these two intermediates are increased by high ADP and Ca2+, and ATPE′Ca2 is always higher than ADPE′∼PCa2 due to the faster reverse constant. That means that the rate of exchange is higher than net Picleavage, as observed experimentally (Fig. 4). On the other hand, due to a slightly unfavorable equilibrium constant for the reverse transition of ADPE-PCa2 to ADPE∼PCa2, the steady state level of ADPE-PCa2 remains fairly high, and significant unproductive cleavage occurs in addition to ATP synthesis. It is noteworthy that a high concentration (mm) of ATP, exceeding the Km (μm), would allow secondary ATP binding to the ADP site, producing an effect similar to that of ADP in raising the concentrations of intermediate (ATPE-PCa2) that, in this case, would undergo entirely unproductive hydrolysis. This effect explains several reports on secondary activation of phosphoenzyme cleavage by mm ATP (16.Verjovski-Almeida S. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 18-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17.McIntosh D.B. Boyer P.D. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 2867-2875Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Considering that mm concentrations of ATP, ADP, and Pi are normally present in muscle fibers, it is apparent that slippage occurs to a significant extent in situ, concomitant with Ca2+ signaling waves, and may play an important physiological role for thermogenesis (5.de Meis L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25078-25087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The extent of slippage is dependent on how effectively cytosolic Ca2+ is lowered by the action of the pump, and ATP reformed from ADP following its utilization for cellular functions. Slippage will be significant if cytosolic Ca2+ remains high enough (μm) to activate the ATPase (Fig. 1) or the ADP concentration rises (Fig. 3). In fact, slippage is likely to be of pathological relevance in failing heart muscle, as expression of SR ATPase lags during the hypertrophic process, and cytosolic Ca2+ transients are thereby prolonged (20.Morgan J.P. Erny R.E. Allen P.D. Grossman W. Gwathmey J.K. Circulation. 1990; 81: III21-III32PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Hasenfuss G. Reinecke H. Studer R. Meyer M. Pieske B. Holtz J. Holubarsch C. Posival H.J. Drexler H. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 434-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). It is of interest that velocity and efficiency of Ca2+ transport are dependent on anion co-transport and that curcumin has a favorable effect on this dependence, within the physiological range of cytosolic Pi concentrations. Higher curcumin concentrations, however, have a direct inhibitory effect on the Ca2+ ATPase. Nevertheless, the observed control of slippage by phosphate and curcumin raises the possibility of improving Ca2+ transport and correcting Ca2+ homeostasis by pharmacological means."

Changes in 5-HT transport, 5-HT-induced current, and plasma membrane transporter density are associated with protein kinase C activation, SERT phosphorylation, and ligand occupancy (37.Ramamoorthy S. Blakely R.D. Science. 1999; 285: 763-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 38.Qian Y. Galli A. Ramamoorthy S. Risso S. DeFelice L.J. Blakely R.D. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 45-57Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transporter activity may also be sensitive to allosteric interactions between subunits of an oligomeric SERT complex (15.Kilic F. Rudnick G.

Here we measure 5-HT transport (Φ5-HT) and 5-HT-induced current (I (5-HT)) in Xenopus oocytes injected with cRNA encoding wild-type and mutant mammalian SERTs. We show that increasing the quantity of cRNA injected or co-injection with an inactive SERT mutant alters the balance of Φ5-HT toI (5-HT), which is reported by a change in the charge/transport ratio (ρ). Expression of biotinylated surface hSERT protein correlates linearly with I (5-HT) but not Φ5-HT. In oocytes with high levels of SERT expression, the apparent affinity of the transporter for substrates and inhibitors is decreased. The data suggest that SERT interacts with an endogenous factor that modulates channel-like and 5-HT transport activities and alters ligand potency. We propose a model for interpreting how SERT expression affects SERT function and pharmacology. The model explains discrepancies regarding variable stoichiometry and transporter-mediated channel activity for SERT and other GAT/NET transporters. The oocytes were isolated as described previously (23.Galli A. Petersen C.I. deBlaquiere M. Blakely R.D. DeFelice L.J. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 3401-3411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and incubated in frog Ringer's solution (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 0.6 mmCaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, at 23 °C, 195–205 mOsm). cDNA constructs encoding either the human serotonin transporter (hSERT) in pOTV (gift of M. Sonders, Vollum Institute, Portland, OR), rSERT in pBS II SK− (Stratagene, gift of R. Blakely Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN), or an rSERT point mutant, rSERT D98G in pBS II SK− (D98G; Ref. 41.Barker E.L. Moore K.R. Rakhshan F. Blakely R.D. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4705-4717Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were linearized by NotI digestion. cRNA was transcribed in vitro (T7 mMessage mMachine; Ambion), diluted to indicated concentrations with sterile water, and stored at −80 °C. The oocytes were injected (Nanoject, Drummond Scientific) with 41.4 nl of cRNA solution and incubated in culture medium (frog Ringer's solution supplemented 5% dialyzed horse serum (Hyclone Laboratories), 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 50 μg/ml tetracycline, 550 μg/ml sodium pyruvate (Sigma) for 2–18 days at either 18 or 24 °C, as indicated. All of the measurements were conducted in frog Ringer's solution supplemented with pargyline (100 μm) and ascorbic acid (100 μm). The assays were initiated by addition of [3H]5-HT (12–30 nm) in a final volume of 200 or 500 μl and proceeded for the indicated time at 24 °C. For 5-HT saturation studies, [3H]5-HT (30 nm) was supplemented with nonradiolabeled 5-HT to the indicated concentration. 5-HT, d-amphetamine, and cocaine were added 3 min prior and paroxetine was added 15 min prior to [3H]5-HT in drug competition studies. Nonspecific [3H]5-HT accumulation was defined in noninjected oocytes and was not significantly different from that measured in the presence of 10 μm citalopram or 10 μm cocaine. The reactions were terminated by three washes in 2 ml of ice-cold frog Ringer's solution. The oocytes were solubilized by shaking for 1 h with 1% SDS. Incorporated [3H] radioactivity was counted by liquid scintillation spectrometry (3.5 ml of Ecoscint H, National Diagnostics) in polypropylene vials and converted to [3H]DPM (1600 TS, Beckman Instruments). The oocytes were impaled with glass microelectrodes containing 3 m KCl (1–3 MΩ resistance), and whole cell two-microelectrode voltage clamp was achieved using a Geneclamp 500 amplifier (Axon Instruments). A Digidata 1200 A/D converter (Axon) interfaced to a PC computer running Clampex 7 software (Axon) was used to control membrane voltage and for data acquisition. The resting membrane potentials were between −20 mV and −60 mV, depending on incubation conditions and cRNA injected. Holding currents under voltage clamp at −80 mV were between −10 and −90 nA. 5-HT-induced current (I (5-HT)) was elicited by superfusion of frog Ringer's solution (∼2 ml/min) containing 5-HT (0.32–32 μm) at pH 7.6 or 5.0, as indicated. For some experiments conducted at pH 5.0, methanesulfonate (5 mm) was included in the Ringer's solution; H+ potentiation ofI (5-HT) was not different under these conditions. The data were low pass filtered at 0.5 kHz and digitized at 1 kHz; base-line currents are subtracted off line and digitally sampled at 10 Hz for graphical presentation. For voltage ramps, the oocytes were clamped at −40 mV and subjected to the indicated voltage protocol in the absence and presence of 5-HT (10 μm). The data were low pass filtered at 1 kHz, digitized at 2 kHz, subtracted off line, and digitally sampled at 100 Hz for presentation. All data analysis was performed using Origin 5.0 (Microcal). Voltage-clamped oocytes were superfused with Ringer's solution containing 5-HT (3.2 μm) and [3H]5-HT (30 nm) for 1 or 2 min as indicated, and incorporated [3H] radioactivity was determined as described for 5-HT transport.Q 5-HT was calculated from transport data assuming a valence of +1e for 5-HT. The currents were base line-subtracted and integrated off line to determine the total 5-HT-induced net charge movement (Q (5-HT)), and ρ was calculated by dividing Q 5-HT byQ (5-HT) within the same oocyte. Specific 5-HT transport and charge movements were defined by subtracting responses seen in noninjected oocytes of the same batch from those in SERT cRNA-injected oocytes. Equal numbers of oocytes from each cRNA injection (typically 20–30) were washed with ice-cold frog Ringer's solution and incubated with 1.0 mg/ml EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-biotin (Pierce) in with ice-cold frog Ringer's solution with gentle agitation for 60 min. The oocytes were incubated for 60 min in ice-cold frog Ringer's solution containing 100 mm glycine, washed twice, and stored at −80 °C until further use (<1 month). After thawing on ice, the oocytes were solubilized as described (42.Ni Y.G. Chen J.G. Androutsellis-Theotokis A. Huang C.J. Moczydlowski E. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30942-30947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Briefly, the oocytes were incubated with lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, at 24 °C, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 μg/ml aprotionin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin, and 250 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μl/oocyte) for 10 min on ice. The extracts were triturated with a pipette until smooth, incubated for 15 min on ice, and centrifuged (15,000 × g for 15 min) to pellet insoluble yolk material. The supernatant was removed, and an aliquot was saved for determination of total protein using the BCA Reagent (Pierce). Immunopure immobilized Streptavidin beads (Pierce) were washed by centrifugation with lysis buffer (3 × 0.5 ml), and the final bead pellet was resuspended to ∼2× bead volume with lysis buffer. The oocyte extracts were incubated with 50 μl of streptavidin bead slurry for 60 min at 24 °C with rocking and then centrifuged for 10 min at 15,000 × g at 4 °C. The supernatant (intracellular fraction) is saved, and the pellet (surface fraction) was washed twice with 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer. Streptavidin beads were incubated with 40 μl of 4× loading buffer (62.5 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.0, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.05% 2-mercaptoethanol) for 30 min at 24 °C to elute biotinylated proteins, and the entire sample was loaded in a single lane for SDS-PAGE in 10% acrylamide slab gels. For intracellular fractions, we loaded 25 μg of total protein/lane (representing 5% of the total extract). The proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore) overnight (4 °C) and washed three times with PBS-T (phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20, 0.5 g/ml nonfat dry milk powder) for 15 min at 24 °C. The blots were incubated for 60 min at 24 °C with anti-hSERT mouse monoclonal antibody ST51–2 (MAb Technologies) diluted 1:2,000 in PBS-T and then washed three times with PBS-T (15 min) before incubation with a peroxidase-conjugated AffiniPure goat anti-mouse antibody (Jackson ImmunoReasearch) diluted 1:20,000 in PBS-T for 60 min at 24 °C. Immunoreactive proteins were detected using the Renaissance Western blot Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and Hyperfilm XL (Amersham Biosciences) per the manufacturer's instructions. Exposed film was scanned with on a Duoscan T1200 (Agfa) and quantified using Quantity One densitometry software (Bio-Rad). Multiple blot exposures of varying duration indicated that film responses are approximately linear and do not saturate in the range used to calculate SERT density. Reported values represent means ± S.E. unless otherwise indicated. Statistical significance was determined using Student's nonpaired t test (Microcal Origin, Northampton, MA). Significant differences are indicated by one asterisk for p < 0.05 and two asterisks forp < 0.01. For curve fits, parameter values represent the means ± 95% confidence interval using the Levenberg-Marquardt nonlinear least squares algorithm (Origin). Parameter values are fixed where confidence intervals are not given. Xenopus oocytes were injected with increasing amounts of SERT cRNA and assayed after a 2-day incubation (24 °C). Fig. 1 A shows a representative Western blot of biotinylated oocyte extracts probed with the hSERT-specific monoclonal antibody ST 51–2. hSERT immunoreactivity was absent in noninjected oocytes (lane 1 and 2) and depends on the amount of cRNA injected (lanes 3–8), indicating that ST 51–2 detects authentic hSERT protein. Several forms of hSERT were distinguished: a small band (∼60 kDa) that is present only in the intracellular fraction, a broad band (70–100 kDa) that is typical of mature hSERT (43.Qian Y. Melikian H.E. Rye D.B. Levey A.I. Blakely R.D. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 1261-1274Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and a larger band (∼220 kDa) in both surface and intracellular fractions that may represent an SDS-resistant SERT protein complex. Despite the fact that surface (biotin +) lanes represent the entire biotinylated fraction and intracellular (biotin −) lanes are loaded with only 5% of the total extract, band densities were comparable (Fig. 1 A,lanes 5–8). Therefore, ∼5% of SERT protein resided on the oocyte surface. We observed similar results in blots from two different oocyte batches. The relative densities of the mature surface hSERT (70–100 kDa) bands were averaged and plotted against the amount of cRNA in Fig. 1 B. To correlate hSERT surface expression with hSERT function, we measured 5-HT transport (Φ5-HT) and 5-HT-induced current (I (5-HT)) in the same batches of oocytes under conditions that are commonly used to study neurotransmitter transporters. Here Φ5-HT assays were conducted in low substrate concentration (30 nm [3H]5-HT) over a short time (2.5 min) without voltage clamp, andI (5-HT) was elicited by rapid superfusion (10–15 s) of high substrate concentration (3.2 or 10 μm5-HT) at −80 mV (Fig. 2 compares Φ5-HT and I (5-HT) under identical conditions). 5-HT-induced currents in noninjected oocytes were typically less than −5 nA (10 μm 5-HT, −80 mV). To discriminate 5-HT-induced current from current carried by 5-HT itself (labeled I5-HT by Galli et al. (23.Galli A. Petersen C.I. deBlaquiere M. Blakely R.D. DeFelice L.J. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 3401-3411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)), we employed the following nomenclature for the current induced by 5-HT:I (5-HT) = [I (10μm 5-HT)] − [I (Control)]. Φ5-HT increased sigmoidally with the amount of hSERT cRNA injected, saturated above 5 ng/oocyte (Fig. 1 B), and was well fit to the Hill equation (Fig. 1 B, EC50 cRNA = 0.13 ± 0.03 ng/oocyte,n H = 1.0). Increasing cRNA also increasedI (5-HT), but the cRNA dependence ofI (5-HT) was shifted rightward with respect to Φ5-HT. Surprisingly, mature surface hSERT protein correlated linearly with I (5-HT) (R2= 0.90), but not Φ5-HT, indicating that plasma membrane expression of SERT is selectively reported by current. Because rSERT cRNA yielded smaller currents than hSERT, we cultured rSERT-injected oocytes for longer times at 18 °C to boost signal strength. At 18 °C, expression of both Φ5-HT andI (5-HT) was delayed compared with oocytes cultured at room temperature (22–24 °C), but oocytes survived longer after cRNA injection (data not shown). We also increased uptake incubation time (60 min) in rSERT-injected oocytes cultured at 18 °C. Under these conditions, titration of rSERT cRNA yielded qualitatively similar results to Fig. 1 B: cRNA more potently effected Φ5-HT than I (5-HT) (Hill fits: Φ5-HT, EC50 cRNA = 0.59 ± 0.02 ng/oocyte; I (5-HT), EC50 cRNA = 20.0 ± 4.8 ng/oocyte; n = 4–6 oocytes from the same batch; data not shown). In the same batch of rSERT-injected oocytes, both I (5-HT) pH5.0 and peak transient current correlated linearly with I (5-HT) at pH 7.6 (R 2 = 0.99 versus I (5-HT) pH5.0 and R 2 = 0.77 versus the transient current; data not shown). Thus, the differential cRNA dependence of Φ5-HT andI (5-HT) was not unique to the particular SERT clone, its plasmid vector, or culture conditions (44.Cao Y. Mager S. Lester H.A. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2257-2266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether the differential cRNA dependence of Φ5-HTand I (5-HT) depends on voltage, we measured Φ5-HT and I (5-HT) simultaneously under voltage clamp at −80 mV in oocytes injected with increasing quantities of rSERT cRNA. To accurately measure currents in oocytes injected with low cRNA, we recorded I (5-HT) at pH 5.0. Fig. 2 A shows that the charge/transport ratio ρ increased 4.3-fold as cRNA increased from 1.4 to 33.6 ng (ρ = 6.7 ± 1.6 and 28.6 ± 3.1, respectively). In contrast, the ratio of I (5-HT) at pH 5.0 toI (5-HT) at pH 7.6 was constant over the same range of cRNA (average I (5-HT) pH5.0/ I (5-HT) pH7.6 = 8.8 ± 0.4 for oocytes injected with 1.4–33.6 ng/oocyte; Fig. 2 B). From these data we calculated that under physiological conditions (−80 mV, pH 7.6), ρ varies between ∼1 and ∼4 over the range of cRNA tested. The validity of this calculation was reinforced by the observation that ρ = 4.4 when measured at pH 7.6 in a separate batch of oocytes injected with 8.3 ng/oocyte rSERT cRNA (see Fig. 5 A). Thus, even when measured simultaneously under voltage clamp and in equal 5-HT concentrations, Φ5-HT andI (5-HT) were differentially dependent on SERT expression level. The unexpected expression level differences in 5-HT transport and current suggested that other properties of SERT might be sensitive to cRNA injection. We therefore examined 5-HT saturation kinetics in Φ5-HT assays. As expected, Φ5-HT increased rapidly with increasing 5-HT concentration at all cRNA levels (Fig. 3 A). Surprisingly, EC50 cRNA for Φ5-HT decreased as 5-HT concentration increased (Fig. 3 A). 5-HT exhibits higher potency at lower hSERT expression (Hill fits: 0.42 ng/oocyte, EC50 = 1.7 ± 0.5 μm; 21 ng/oocyte, EC50 = 8.0 ± 4.0 μm;n H = 1.0 for all fits and n = 3–6 oocytes/batch from three separate oocyte batches, data not shown). Thus, 5-HT potency was inversely correlated with SERT expression. Substrate potency also shifted with expression level in competition assays, where both nontransported inhibitors and substrates inhibited transport of [3H]5-HT (Fig. 4, A and B). 5-HT potency for inhibition of Φ5-HT was higher in oocytes injected with 0.42 ng of hSERT cRNA than with 21 ng of hSERT cRNA (Fig. 4 A). Cocaine potency was also sensitive to cRNA injection, and the magnitude of the shift was larger than for 5-HT (Fig. 4 B). The substrate d-amphetamine shared sensitivity with 5-HT (0.42 ng/oocyte, IC50 = 40 ± 5.7 μm; 21 ng/oocyte, IC50 = 170 ± 30 μm, data not shown), and the nontransported antidepressant paroxetine (IC50 = 7.9 ± 1.3 nm; 21 ng/oocyte, IC50 = 55.2 ± 9.6 nm; data not shown) shifted similarly to cocaine. In contrast, I (5-HT) was insensitive to hSERT expression (Fig. 4 C). At either low or high hSERT expression (0.42 ng/oocyte or 21 ng/oocyte), 5-HT potency forI (5-HT) was similar to Φ5-HT at low expression. Fig. 4 D summarizes changes in ligand potency at low and high SERT expression. Inhibitory potency decreased 4–5-fold for 5-HT and 10-fold for cocaine when cRNA was increased from 0.42 to 21 ng/oocyte. Substrate and inhibitor recognition was therefore sensitive to SERT expression level when 5-HT transport was assayed but not when 5-HT-induced current was measured. That transport and current are differentially sensitive to SERT expression suggested that SERT may interact with a protein or cellular factor that modulates its function. One possibility is that ρ is sensitive to intersubunit interactions in an oligomeric complex (11.Schmid J.A. Scholze P. Kudlacek O. Freissmuth M. Singer E.A. Sitte H.H. J. Biol.

Baker A.H. Padua R.A. Leuk. Res. 1998; 22: 365-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the same point mutation has been detected in a number of hematological disorders. The C-terminal mutation has also been observed in children suffering from secondary acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) or myelodysplasia (16.Ridge S.A. Worwood M. Oscier D. Jacobs A. Padua R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1377-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 17.Baker A.H. Ball S. McGynn H. Whittaker J.A. Burnett A.K. Padua R.A. Leukemia. 1995; 9: 155-158PubMed Google Scholar). However, the role of the C-terminal at the molecular level was poorly understood. To elucidate the molecular principles underlying the up-regulation of oncogenic potency via mutation of the C-terminal tail, we employed a yeast two-hybrid screening protocol based on the tyrosine-phosphorylated cytoplasmic domain of c-Fms and v-Fms as baits. We identified c-Cbl as a binding partner of c-Fms. c-Cbl binds to c-Fms specifically at tyrosine 977, which is absent in v-Fms. Using cells expressing a chimera receptor of v-Fms and c-Fms, we show that the overexpression of c-Cbl suppressed the transforming potential of chimera Fms by the enhancement of the receptor ubiquitination but not that of v-Fms. Furthermore, the replacement of tyrosine residue 977 into phenylalanine avoided the quick ubiquitination of Fms molecules. These data indicate that the observed negative regulatory function of the C-terminal tail is mediated by a Cbl binding site. The construction of LexA fusion genes encoding the cytoplasmic domains of c-Fms, v-Fms, and vc-Fms downstream of LexA using BTM116 vector, the expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain YRN974, and the qualitative and quantitative evaluations of various two-hybrid protein/protein interactions were described previously (3.Mancini A.

GST-Cbl-(amino acids 1–350) and Fms-fusion proteins were generated in the pGex system (Amersham Biosciences). For expression in mammalian cells, the felinec-fms, v-fms, and its chimeravc-fms-cDNA were cloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). NIH3T3 and HEK293 cells expressing thev-fms, c-fms, or vc-fms genes were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. CSF-1 (Sigma) was added at a concentration of 2000 units/ml. Rat sera against feline c-Fms and v-Fms were used as described previously (22.Tamura T. Simon E. Niemann H. Snoek G.T. Bauer H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 4745-4748Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies against phosphotyrosine (4G10) and against c-Cbl, ubiquitin, Grb2, and PI 3-kinase were from Upstate Biotechnology Incorporated (Lake Placid, NY) or from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Rabbit antibodies against ubiquitin and Fms were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and Erk1/2 and phospho-Erk1/2 antibodies were from Promega (Madison, WI). For tyrosine kinase assays, Fms-specific immune complexes were incubated for 20 min at room temperature with 3 μCi of γ-[32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) in the presence of 10 mm MnCl2, and were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. For co-immunoprecipitation studies, 5 × 106cells were lysed with the lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1% trasylol, 100 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 200 μm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and 100 mm sodium fluoride). For identification by immunoblotting, proteins were transferred onto Polablot polyvinylidene difluoride membrane or nitrocellulose membrane (Macherey-Nagel) by a semi-dry blotting technique. Bound antibody was visualized by incubation of blots in 3 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, containing 137 mm NaCl and 2 μCi of 125I-labeled anti-species-specific immunoglobulin G (Amersham Biosciences) or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated immunoglobulin G (Santa Cruz) followed by applying with BM chemiluminescence detection kit (Roche Diagnostics). Bound radioactivity was quantified using a model BAS1500 bioimaging analyzer (Fuji Photo Film Co., Kanagawa, Japan). Strain TKX-1 (TKX, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used for the isolation of phosphorylated GST-Fms fusion proteins. Phosphorylated GST fusion proteins were produced as recommended by the manufacturer. The corresponding nonphosphorylated molecular species were isolated from E. coli strain DH5α. Purified GST fusion proteins were bound for 1 h at 4 °C to glutathione-agarose beads (40 μl of slurry; Amersham Biosciences) suspended in the lysis buffer. Precharged beads were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 32P-labeled Fms, as generated byin vitro autophosphorylation or obtained from Fms-expressing HEK293 cell lysates in a total volume of 2 ml of binding buffer. Beads were washed five times with binding buffer, and pellets were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Using a yeast two-hybrid technique, we have isolated cDNA encoding several signaling proteins such as PI 3-kinase, Grb2, Grb10, phospholipase C-γ, c-Src, c-Abl, Crk, Fms-interacting protein, and c-Cbl, which specifically interact with the cytoplasmic domain of c-Fms (10.Tamura T. Mancini A. Joos H. Koch A. Hakim C. Dumanski J. Weidner K.M. Niemann H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6488-6495Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To determine whether one of these associates with c-Fms or v-Fms specifically, we again employed the yeast two-hybrid system using green fluorescent protein as a reporter gene product (3.Mancini A. Niedenthal R. Joos H. Koch A. Trouliaris S. Niemann H. Tamura T. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1565-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). All of the proteins bound to both v-Fms and c-Fms equally well except the PTB domain of c-Cbl (amino acid residues 1–350). c-Cbl bound to c-Fms but not to v-Fms in this assay system (Fig. 1 A). Since the major difference of the cytoplasmic domains of v-Fms and c-Fms is the C-terminal tail, we replaced the last 14 amino acids of v-Fms by 50 amino acids derived from the C-terminal tail of c-Fms (vc-Fms) (Fig. 1 B). As shown in Fig. 1, the resultant vc-Fms was indeed able to bind to c-Cbl. As expected, the kinase-negative vc-Fms mutant (vc-FmsK613M) did not associate with c-Cbl, indicating this association is tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent. Furthermore, mutation of tyrosine 720, which was previously suggested as a direct or indirect binding site of c-Cbl (18.Ota J. Sato K. Kimura F. Wakimoto N. Nakamura Y. Nagata N. Suzu S. Yamada M. Shimamura S. Motoyoshi K. FEBS Letters. 2000; 466: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), did not influence the Fms interaction with c-Cbl in this assay system, indicating that Tyr-720 is not a direct binding site for c-Cbl. To demonstrate the protein/protein interaction between c-Cbl and c-Fms in different systems, we first performed a Cbl-specific co-immunoprecipitation study. v-Fms, c-Fms, and vc-Fms were expressed in HEK293 cells, and cell extracts were supplied for an in vitro kinase reaction of Fms-specific immune complexes. Autophosphorylated v-Fms, c-Fms, and vc-Fms polypeptides were liberated from these complexes by a low pH shock treatment (Fig. 2 A). The same counts of radiolabeled individual Fms molecules were incubated with HEK293 cell lysates, and were immunoprecipitated with anti Cbl antibody. In this assay, all three, v-, c-, and vc-Fms, were co-immunoprecipitated with c-Cbl molecules (Fig. 2 B). In addition, c-Cbl was co-precipitated by anti-Fms antibody with all three autophosphorylated Fms polypeptides. After incubation of autophosphorylated Fms molecules with alkaline phosphatase, the interaction of c-Cbl with Fms was completely abolished (Fig. 2 B). Thus, in the presence of cellular proteins, both c- and v-Fms associate with c-Cbl. This is not surprising because it has been well documented that CSF-1 stimulation induces the formation of a multiprotein complex including c-Fms, c-Cbl, CrkII, PI 3-kinase, and Grb2 (19.Husson H. Mograbi B. Schmid-Antomarchi H. Fischer S. Rossi B. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2331-2338Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Here, both Grb2 and PI 3-kinase bind to v-Fms as well. In addition, c-Cbl forms a stable complex via its proline-rich sequence with the SH3 domain of PI 3-kinase and Grb2 (20.Sattler M. Salgia R. Okuda K. Uemura N. Durstin M.A. Pisick E. Xu G. Li J.L. Prasad K.V. Griffin J.D. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 839-846PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Odai H. Sasaki K. Iwamatsu A. Hanazono Y. Tanaka T. Mitani K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10800-10805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Therefore, we utilized the GST fusion protein binding assay using GST-Cbl (amino acid residues 1–350), which is lacking the proline-rich domain. In agreement with data obtained from the yeast two-hybrid assay, both32P-labeled autophosphorylated c-Fms and vc-Fms bound to the GST-Cbl, but v-Fms did not (Fig. 3), suggesting that c-Cbl associates directly with the C-terminal of the c-Fms molecule. However, in addition, c-Cbl binds to v-Fms indirectly through multiprotein complex formation.Figure 3c-Cbl interacts with c-Fms and chimera vc-Fms, but not v-Fms in the GST-Cbl-binding assay. GST-Cbl-PTB (amino acids 1–350) or GST alone, were produced in bacterial strains DH5α. v-Fms, c-Fms, and vc-Fms genes were expressed in HEK293 cells, and cell extracts were supplied for in vitro kinase reaction in the presence of γ-[32P]ATP. GST-fusion protein or GST (5 μg each) were bound to GT-agarose beads and incubated with 32P-labeled v-Fms, c-Fms, and vc-Fms. Binding materials were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. As a control, aliquots were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To study whether the c-Cbl/c-Fms interaction relied on the presence of particular phosphotyrosine residues of Fms, we employed a set of GST-Fms fusion proteins including GST-CT-v-Fms (amino acids 904–944), and GST-CT-c-Fms (amino acids 904–980) (Fig. 4 A). The recombinant tyrosine-phosphorylated GST-Fms polypeptides were isolated fromE. coli strain TKX that expresses an active Elk tyrosine kinase (11.Joos H. Trouliaris S. Helftenbein G. Niemann H. Tamura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24476-24481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). As demonstrated by Western blotting using anti-phosphotyrosine, these proteins were indeed phosphorylated on tyrosine (Fig. 4 B, anti-Try (anti-pY)). GST Fms fusion proteins were incubated with HEK293 cell extracts, and bound proteins were analyzed by c-Cbl- and Grb2-specific immunoblotting. In agreement with previous data (3.Mancini A. Niedenthal R. Joos H. Koch A. Trouliaris S. Niemann H. Tamura T. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1565-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), Grb2 bound to both GST-CT-c-Fms and GST-CT-v-Fms that contain the Grb2 binding site, phosphotyrosine 921, while c-Cbl bound to GST-CT-c-Fms exclusively. GST-CT-c-Fms contains two tyrosine residues, tyrosine 921 and tyrosine 977, while GST-CT-v-Fms contains only phosphotyrosine 921 (Fig. 4 A). Therefore, we have replaced the unique tyrosine residue in c-Fms, tyrosine 977, by phenylalanine (GST-CT-c-Fms977F). This GST fusion protein was still able to bind to Grb2; however, c-Cbl was almost undetectable (Fig. 4 B). Furthermore, no binding of c-Cbl and Grb2 to unphosphorylated GST fusion proteins were observed (Fig. 4). These data indicate that phosphotyrosine 977 indeed provides the binding site for c-Cbl. One important characteristic which distinguishes normal cells from transformed cells is the ability of the latter to form colonies in soft agar. To determine whether the replacement of the C-terminal tail influences the transforming potency of v-Fms, 5 × 105 NIH3T3 cells were transfected with 10 μg of pcDNA3 containing feline c-Fms, v-Fms, and chimera vc-Fms. Fig. 5 shows that v-Fms transfectants formed colonies in 0.5% soft agar, but c-Fms transfectants were not able to form colonies. In agreement with previous data (12.Woolford J. McAuliffe A. Rohrschneider L.R. Cell. 1988; 55: 965-977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), vc-Fms transfectants formed colonies; however, sizes of colonies were drastically reduced. To determine whether the observed reduction of v-Fms-transforming potency by the C-terminal replacement is due to a direct interaction with c-Cbl, we introduced the exogenous c-Cbl at different concentrations into vc-Fms- and v-Fms-transformed cells. For this experiment, we further established cell lines that express vc-Fms or v-Fms. Established cell lines were transfected with 1 and 9 μg of pcDNA3 containing c-Cbl cDNA and tested again for formation of colonies in soft agar. In the absence of exogenous c-Cbl, v-Fms-transformed cells formed colonies with an average size of 60 μm in diameter, while vc-Fms-transformed cells formed colonies with an average size of 35 μm in diameter within 6 days (Fig. 6). Sizes of colonies of vc-Fms expressing cells were drastically reduced by overexpression of exogenous c-Cbl after transfection even with 1 μg of pcDNA3 containing c-Cbl cDNA. In contrast, c-Cbl expression (Fig. 6 A, 1 μg) did not change, if rather enhanced, the size of colonies after the same treatment of v-Fms-transformed cells. These results indicate that the direct interaction with c-Cbl to the Fms molecule may down-modulate the Fms signal. In addition, although wild-type v-Fms interacts with c-Cbl indirectly via other signaling molecules such as PI 3-kinase and Grb2, c-Cbl did not affect transforming potency of v-Fms, suggesting an indirect association of c-Cbl via a multimeric complex that induced a different signaling pathway from the pathway induced by c-Cbl direct interaction. Since it has been well documented that c-Cbl plays a role in protein ubiquitination, the question arises as to whether the reduced transforming potency of vc-Fms is a result of enhanced ubiquitination. Therefore, we compared first the ubiquitination of v-Fms and vc-Fms upon stimulation with CSF-1. Sister cultures of 1 × 106 cells each derived from v- or vc-Fms-transformed 3T3 cell lines were labeled with [3H]leucin for 16 h and were stimulated with CSF-1 for 3, 10, or 30 min. Cell extracts from each preparation were supplied for Fms-specific immunoprecipitation. In agreement with previous data (22.Tamura T. Simon E. Niemann H. Snoek G.T. Bauer H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 4745-4748Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), about 10% of v-Fms molecules were detected as a mature glycoprotein, gp140v-Fms that is expressed at the cell surface. Although similar amounts of immature glycoprotein gp120v-Fms and gp130vc-Fms were detected from both cell lines, less of the mature glycoprotein of vc-Fms, gp150vc-Fms, was detected than gp140v-Fms (Fig. 7 A). The same aliquots of Fms-specific immunoprecipitates were analyzed by ubiquitin-specific immunoblot. vc-Fms was ubiquitinated about 2-fold more than v-Fms; however, no significant difference was observed in the presence or absence of CSF-1. It is noteworthy that vc-Fms was dimerized and activated constitutively without CSF-1 via mutations in the extracellular domain (12.Woolford J. McAuliffe A. Rohrschneider L.R. Cell. 1988; 55: 965-977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 13.Roussel M.F. Downing J.R. Rettenmier C.W. Sherr C.J. Cell. 1988; 55: 979-988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) and might be ubiquitinated constantly to some extent. As control, cell extracts from the same preparation were analyzed by Western blot using anti-Erk and activated Erk antibodies. In both cell lines, Erk1/2was activated slightly without ligand; however, CSF-1 stimulation induced an activation of Erk within 3 min in both cell lines, whereby the level of phosphorylation decreased within 10 min. To determine whether c-Cbl molecules indeed influenced ubiquitination via phospho-Tyr-977, we generated the mutant vc-Fms whose tyrosine 977 was replaced by phenylalanine (vc-Y977F-Fms). Five μg of each vc-Fms and vc-Y977F-Fms cDNA were transfected into 2 × 105 HEK293 cells with and without c-Cbl cDNA. After serum starvation for 16 h, cells were stimulated with CSF-1 for 3 or 30 min at 37 °C. Aliquots of cell extracts were immunoprecipitated by Fms-specific antibodies and were analyzed by Fms- or ubiquitin-specific immunoblotting. The following results were obtained. Firstly, c-Cbl over-expression down-modulated Erk activation induced by CSF-1 in vc-Fms-transformed cells. Secondly, c-Cbl over-expression up-regulated the vc-Fms ubiquitination. Thirdly, the mutation of tyrosine 977 in vc-Fms enhanced the CSF-1-mediated Erk activation. Fourthly, over-expression of c-Cbl in vc-Y977F-Fms cells has a lesser effect on the activation of Erk than in vc-Fms cells, and no effect on vc-Y977F-Fms ubiquitination. We then examined the c-Cbl-dependent ubiquitination of their cellular counterpart, the feline c-Fms, the kinase of which is inactive in the absence of CSF-1. Furthermore, we replaced tyrosine 977 in feline c-Fms by phenylalanine (c-Y977F-Fms). Five μg of c-Fms and c-Y977F-Fms cDNA were transfected into HEK293 cells with and without c-Cbl cDNA. After serum starvation for 16 h, cells were stimulated with CSF-1 for 3 or 30 min for 37 °C, and cell extracts were then immunoprecipitated using a Fms-specific antibody. In agreement with the previous data using the mouse c-Fms-expressing cells (23.Lee P.S.W. Wang Y. Dominguez M.G. Yeung Y-G. Murphy M.A. Bowtell D.D. Stanley E.R. EMBO J. 1999; 13: 3616-3628Crossref Scopus (253) Google Scholar), the feline c-Fms was ubiquitinated in the presence of the exogenous c-Cbl (Fig. 8); however, this ubiquitination is drastically reduced by replacement of tyrosine 977 into phenylalanine in feline c-Fms molecules, indicating that tyrosine 977, our newly found c-Cbl binding site, plays a key role for the c-Cbl-mediated ubiquitination.Figure 8The replacement of tyrosine residue 977 by phenylalanine in the feline c-Fms reduced the ubiquitination. Five μg of pcDNA3 containing c-Fms or c-Y977F-Fms cDNA were transfected into 2 × 105 of HEK293 together with or without 5 μg of c-Cbl cDNA. After 36 h of transfection, cells were serum-starved for 16 h and were then stimulated with CSF-1 for 3 or 30 min at 37 °C. Cell extracts were divided into two aliquots and precipitated by anti-Fms rat antibody (IP:Fms) followed by ubiquitin (WB:anti-Ub) or Fms-specific immunoblot (WB:anti-Fms), or cell lysates (WCL) were analyzed by c-Cbl, phosphoErk, or Erk-specific immunoblot (WB).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Employing a yeast two-hybrid technique, we detected c-Cbl as a direct interacting partner of c-Fms tyrosine kinase. We show here c-Cbl binds to phosphotyrosine 977 at the C-terminal tail of feline c-Fms, which is absent in the v-Fms molecule. Oncogenic v-Fms, which was reconstituted the Cbl binding site, did not transform cells in the presence of the high level of c-Cbl, indicating that the direct binding of c-Cbl plays a key role in Fms tyrosine kinase-mediated cell transformation. Furthermore, the exogenous c-Cbl expression in vc-Y977F-Fms cells did not influence Fms ubiquitination of and Erk activation mediated by CSF-1. Interestingly, v-Fms formed a complex with c-Cbl indirectly; however, expression of c-Cbl did not alter transforming potency of v-Fms, indicating that c-Cbl may mediate two different signaling pathways dependent upon distinct multimeric complexes. The protooncogne c-cbl product is the 120-kDa protein containing an unconventional PTB domain, a ring finger, a proline rich-domain, and a leucine zipper-like domain. This molecule was originally identified as a retroviral oncogene product, v-Cbl (24.Blake T.J. Shapiro M. Moese III H.C. Langdon W.Y. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 653-657PubMed Google Scholar), that contains only the PTB domain of c-Cbl. Recently, it was demonstrated that the protooncogene product c-Cbl acts as a ubiquitin ligase, E3 ubiquitin conjugate enzyme, (25.Joazeiro C.A. Wing S.S. Huang H. Leverson J.D. Hunter T. Liu Y.-C.

Chem. 1999; 274: 16619-16628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). We show here for the first time that c-Fms binds to c-Cbl directly via phosphotyrosine 977. It has been suggested that Cbl is associated with phosphotyrosine 723 in human c-Fms (corresponding to the tyrosine residue 720 in v-Fms and feline c-Fms). Since this tyrosine residue was identified as a PI 3-kinase binding site, this interaction may be via PI 3-kinase (18.Ota J. Sato K. Kimura F. Wakimoto N. Nakamura Y. Nagata N. Suzu S. Yamada M. Shimamura S. Motoyoshi K. FEBS Letters. 2000; 466: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The authors showed that c-Cbl molecules were less immunoprecipitated by a mutant human c-Fms in which tyrosine 723 was changed to phenylalanine. In agreement with this work, we observed that the phosphorylated v-Fms formed a complex with c-Cbl in the presence of other signaling molecules, indicating that c-Cbl binds also indirectly via a multiprotein complex. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that PI 3-kinse or Grb2 forms a complex with c-Cbl upon stimulation with CSF-1 (30.Wang Y. Yeung Y.-G. Stanley E.R. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 72: 119-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Taken together these data suggest that the Fms/c-Cbl interaction may mediate two different signaling pathways dependent upon distinct multimeric complexes; direct c-Cbl/Fms association leads to the down-modulation of receptor signaling, whereas the indirect association via a multiprotein complex leads instead to the up-regulation of receptor signaling. Along these same lines, Grishinet al. (31.Grishin A. Sinha S. Roginskaya V. Boyer M.J. Gomez-Cambronero J. Zup S. Kurosaki T. Romero G. Corey S.J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) reported that the mutation of the PI 3-kinase binding site, tyrosine 731, in the Cbl molecule down-regulated Lyn tyrosine kinase-mediated thymidine incorporation, suggesting that the association of Cbl with PI 3-kinase plays a key role in proliferative signaling pathways. It has also been shown that the interaction of PI 3-kinase with c-Cbl enhanced PI 3-kinase activity (32.Ueno H. Sasaki K. Honda H. Nakamoto T. Yamagata T. Miyagiwa K. Mitani K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Blood. 1998; 91: 46-53Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that c-Cbl may act as positive regulator for signaling by the activation of receptor tyrosine kinase. In addition, c-Cbl also up-regulates Fc receptor-mediated platelet activation (33.Saci A. Pain S. Rendu F. Bachelot-Loza C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1898-1904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) or CD16-mediated signaling (34.Cerboni C. Gismondi A. Palmieri G. Piccoli M. Frati L. Santoni A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 1005-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) via distinct multiprotein complexes. On the other hand, it is clear that the direct binding of c-Cbl to phosphotyrosine 977 of Fms leads to the down-modulation of Fms and its downstream signal cascades. Interestingly, the ubiquitination of platelet-derived growth factor β receptor, which is closely related to Fms tyrosine kinase, was drastically reduced via deletion of 98 amino acids at the C-terminal end or replacement of tyrosine residues 1009 and 1021 by phenylalanine at the C-terminal domain. Furthermore, the ubiquitination-deficient receptors possessed an amplified mitogenic activity (35.Mori S. Heldin C-H. Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 577-583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The C-terminal tail of Neu receptor tyrosine kinase is also required for c-Cbl-mediated ubiquitination (36.Levkowitz G. Oved S.

Chem. 2000; 275: 35532-35539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and mutations that impair the property of c-Cbl to induce the ubiquitination of the epidermal growth factor receptor has oncogenic properties (25.Joazeiro C.A.

These data also reveal that receptor ubiquitination is one of the important control mechanisms for anti-cell transformation. Interestingly, impairing the function of TSG101/Vsp23, a protein that contains an inactive E2 ubiquitin-conjugase domain, perturbs endosomal trafficking and induces cell transformation (37.Babst M. Odorizzi G. Estepa E.J. Emr S.D. Traffic. 2000; 1: 248-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). In addition to the Cbl binding site, the C-terminal tail of c-Fms contains a PEST-like domain of 33 amino acids (amino acid residues 925–957 of feline c-Fms) with 18 serine residues, five glutamate residues, two proline residues, and one threonine residue. Hence, Oberg et al. (38.Oberg C. Li J. Pauley A. Wolf E. Gurney M. Lendahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35847-35853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) reported that Notch 1 is ubiquitinated by mSel-10 and that ubiquitination requires the presence of the Notch 1 C-terminal domain, including the PEST domain. The role of this PEST-like domain of c-Fms, however, still remains to be studied. It is noteworthy that mutation of the human c-fms gene at codon 969 (corresponding to the feline 977 tyrosine residue) has been detected in a number of hematological disorders, AML, B-cell lymphoma and children suffering from secondary AML or myelodysplasia (16.Ridge S.A.

While TR4 shares the structural features of nuclear receptors, no ligand has yet been identified, and it is therefore considered an orphan receptor. TR4 is highly expressed in the testes and prostate, as well as being widely expressed in the brain, particularly in the granule cells of the hippocampus and cerebellum (4.Chang C. Da Silva S.L.

The differential spacings between the core elements cause TR4 to adopt different conformations and alter the ability of TR4 to interact with coregulators (8.Lee Y.F. Young W.J. Lin W.J. Shyr C.R. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16198-16205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Consistent with its neuronal localization, TR4 also induces the transcription of a cytokine receptor, which is the ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor (9.Young W.J. Smith S.M. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3109-3116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).In addition to direct transcriptional regulation, TR4 can also modulate other nuclear receptors' transactivation. Previous studies have indicated that TR4 can compete for binding to the hormone response elements of retinoic acid receptor (RAR), retinoid X receptor (RXR) (6.Lee Y.F. Young W.J. Burbach J.P. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13437-13443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and vitamin D receptor (VDR) (8.Lee Y.F. Young W.J. Lin W.J. Shyr C.R. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16198-16205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) to suppress RAR/RXR- or VDR-mediated transcription. TR4 may also inhibit peroxisome proliferator activated receptor α (PPARα)-induced transactivation by competitive binding to PPAR response elements and through competition for coactivators such as RIP140 (10.Yan Z.H.

Recently, TR4 has been found to interact with the androgen receptor (AR). The AR-TR4 interaction could then result in the mutual suppression of AR- or TR4-mediated transcription (11.Lee Y.F.

These studies suggest that TR4 could function as a master to modulate many signal pathways mediated by various nuclear receptors.Estrogen receptors (ER) that play many essential roles for the growth in female reproductive tissues are encoded by two distinct genes, ERα and ERβ (12.Kuiper G.G.

It has been demonstrated that ERα and ERβ can form heterodimers (13.Cowley S.M. Hoare S. Mosselman S. Parker M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19858-19862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar), and ERα was able to directly bind to TR, RAR, RXR (14.Lee S.K. Choi H.S. Song M.R. Lee M.O. Lee J.W.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3505-3512Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). ERα-TR and ERα-RXR heterocomplexes moderately enhance ER-mediated transcription in transient transfection experiments with CV-1 cells. In contrast, RAR repressed ER-mediated transactivation (14.Lee S.K. Choi H.S. Song M.R. Lee M.O. Lee J.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1184-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The SHP inhibits ER transcriptional activity by preventing coactivator binding to ER (16.Johansson L. Thomsen J.S. Damdimopoulos A.E. Spyrou G. Gustafsson J.A. Treuter E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 345-353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), and ERβcx inhibits ER transactivation by preventing ER binding to DNA (17.Ogawa S. Inoue S. Watanabe T. Orimo A. Hosoi T. Ouchi Y. Muramatsu M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3505-3512Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that TR4 also inhibits ER transcriptional activity in lung cancer H1299 cells and in breast cancer MCF-7 cells. Further studies indicate that TR4 can suppress ER function via protein-protein interaction that results in the interruption of ER-ER homodimerization and in preventing ER binding to its estrogen response element (ERE).DISCUSSIONEarly studies in nuclear receptors suggested that TR, RAR, SHP, and chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcriptional factor may be able to interact with ER and modulate ER transactivation (14.Lee S.K. Choi H.S. Song M.R. Lee M.O. Lee J.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1184-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 15.Seol W. Hanstein B. Brown M. Moore D.D. Mol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 31465-31474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). As these receptors, together with their ligands such as triiodothyronine or retinoids, may play important roles in the ER-mediated cell growth (27.Fontana J.A. Exp. Cell Biol. 1987; 55: 136-144PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Fontana J.A. Miranda D. Mezu A.B. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 1977-1982PubMed Google Scholar), we expect to see the pleiotropic effect of estrogen may require the cooperation of ER with a large network of nuclear receptors. The identification of TR4 as one of the ER-interacting proteins to modulate ER functions further strengthens this hypothesis. The in vivo effect of an individual receptor's influence on the ER function, however, may depend on the availability of whole ER interaction proteins in any single cell. For this reason, we may expect to see differential TR4 suppression effects on ER transactivation in a variety of cells, depending on the relative amount of TR4 compared with other proteins that were also able to bind and modulate ER functions.The analysis of ERαKO mice indicated that ERα may play importantin vivo functions, such as the growth of the adult female reproductive tract and mammary gland, the regulation of gonadotropin gene transcription, mammary neoplasia induction, and sexual behaviors. Surprisingly, ERα also plays important roles in spermatogenesis and sperm function (see review, see Ref. 29.Couse J.F. Korach K.S. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 358-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). However, the detailed mechanism for ERα to control these pathways remains unclear. Previous reports have linked TR4 function to neurogenesis (9.Young W.J. Smith S.M. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3109-3116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and spermatogenesis (30.Lee C.H. Chinpaisal C. Wei L.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25209-25215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), but the real physiological roles of TR4 are still unknown. Here, we provide the evidence to support the hypothesis that the complexity of ER function could be achieved partly by the coordination with other nuclear receptors such as TR4, which further strengthens our early hypothesis that TR4 may play important physiological roles.TR4 has been demonstrated to suppress many other receptors' transactivation, such as VDR, RAR, RXR, and PPAR (6.Lee Y.F. Young W.J. Burbach J.P. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13437-13443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 8.Lee Y.F. Young W.J. Lin W.J. Shyr C.R. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16198-16205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 10.Yan Z.H. Karam W.G. Staudinger J.L. Medvedev A. Ghanayem B.I. Jetten A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10948-10957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The suppression mechanism for these receptors' transactivation has been demonstrated through the competition of TR4 with those receptors' ability to bind their hormone response elements. This competition mechanism is, therefore, different from the TR4 suppression of ER transactivation, which is through protein-protein interaction (Fig. 2). The fact that there is no extra band in the EMSA when we added TR4 alone or along with ER and incubated with 32P-labeled ERE (Fig. 4 A), clearly suggests that TR4 will not bind to32P-labeled ERE. Instead, the TR4 will reduce ER-32P-labeled ERE binding through heterodimer formation with ER, which therefore titrates out the free ER. In addition to the interruption of binding between ERE and ER, our data also demonstrated that TR4 could inhibit ER-ER homodimerization (Fig. 4 B). Fig. 3 further demonstrates that TR4 may interact with ERα via its LBD. Early reports suggest that ERα is also able to form homodimers or heterodimers with other receptors through a common dimerization surface within the LBD, which is located in a conserved hydrophobic region at the N terminus of helix 10/11 (13.Cowley S.M. Hoare S. Mosselman S. Parker M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19858-19862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar, 31.Tanenbaum D.M. Wang Y. Williams S.P. Sigler P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5998-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). Together, these studies suggest that both ER and TR4 can use their LBDs to interact with other receptors. Early reports also demonstrated that other receptors might bind to ER via LBD to modulate ER functions. For example, truncated estrogen receptor product-1 (TERP-1), which only contains the C-terminal region of the full-length ER, forms heterodimers with ER and inhibits ER binding to EREs (32.Resnick E.M. Schreihofer D.A. Periasamy A. Shupnik M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7158-7166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). SHP interacts with and inhibits ER transactivation by the competition for coactivators, like RIP140 (16.Johansson L. Thomsen J.S. Damdimopoulos A.E. Spyrou G. Gustafsson J.A. Treuter E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 345-353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In contrast to the above suppression mechanism, our data show that TR4 did not influence the binding between RIP140 and ER. Instead, TR4 modulates ER functions via interruption of ER homodimerization and ER binding to EREs. Therefore, TR4 may represent a new category of negative coregulators of ER.Furthermore, our TR4 stably transfected MCF-7 cells clearly demonstrate that TR4 could inhibit the expression of estrogen-induced pS2 mRNAs (22.Brown A.M. Jeltsch J.M. Roberts M. Chambon P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 6344-6348Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), which is specifically and directly induced by estrogens through ER at the transcriptional level in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 5 C). Since the expression of the pS2 gene has been widely used as a marker to monitor the effect of estrogens, this result suggests that TR4 could suppress ER function not only occurring in cell line transient transfection experiments (Fig. 1, A and B), but also in ER target gene expression. TR4 is also able to suppress estrogen-induced cell proliferation in MCF-7 cells stably transfected with TR4 induced by Dox (Fig. 5 A). This result extends ourin vitro results and demonstrates that the consequence of the protein-protein inhibition can result in the suppression of E2/ER-induced cell growth. Lazennec et al. reported that estrogen-stimulated gene expression and proliferation of MCF-7 breast cancer cells could be blocked by adding a dominant-negative ER (S554-frameshifted) (33.Lazennec G. Alcorn J.L. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 969-980Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The possible suppression mechanism, however, is different from TR4 suppression of ER functions and may involve the formation of inactive heterodimers between the dominant-negative ER and wild-type ER (34.Schodin D.J. Zhuang Y. Shapiro D.J. Katzenellenbogen B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31163-31171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).Estrogen-induced breast cancer cell proliferation has been linked well to the modulation of cyclin D1 that plays important roles in the cell cycle control to stimulate the G1-S phase progression (25.Prall O.W. Rogan E.M. Sutherland R.L. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 65: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar,35.Baldin V. Lukas J. Marcote M.J. Pagano M. Draetta G. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 812-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (1423) Google Scholar). Results from Fig. 6 B also demonstrate that TR4 could suppress E2/ER-regulated cyclin D1 gene expression. This Dox-inducible cell model system to control expression of TR4 and the function of ER may therefore provide a nice system for studying the physiological roles of TR4 in ER target organs, such as breast and testis.The potential impacts of this new finding could be significant, and it may allow us to modulate ER function via interrupting the binding between ER and TR4. Any compounds or small peptide(s) that mimic the interaction domain between TR4 and ER could be developed for future therapeutic uses. These compounds or peptide(s) may have minimal side effects due to unique abilities to specifically block the ER-TR4 interaction. Our preliminary data from TR4 KO mice suggest that TR4 may play an important role in the growth and reproductive systems, 2L. Collins and C. Chang, unpublished data. and it has been well documented that ER also plays an important role in these areas. It is possible that normal growth and reproductive development and function may require the balance and coordination between these two receptors.Tissue distribution studies indicated that ERα is expressed well in testes and epididymis (36.Couse J.F. Lindzey J. Grandien K. Gustafsson J.A. Korach K.S. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4613-4621Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). ERαKO mice are infertile and produce lower numbers of epididymal sperm, compared with wild-type mice at 12 weeks. Furthermore, the sperm produced in the ERαKO mice have obvious defects and are unable to fertilize wild-type oocytes (37.Eddy E.M. Washburn T.F. Bunch D.O. Goulding E.H. Gladen B.C. Lubahn D.B. Korach K.S. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4796-4805Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). These studies indicated that ERα plays important roles in the testes function and spermatogenesis. Interestingly, our early studies of tissue distribution studies not only showed that TR4 is highly expressed in testes, but that it is also strongly linked to the defective spermatogenesis found in rhesus monkey in either surgery-induced cryptorchid testis (38.Mu X. Liu Y. Collins L.L. Kim E. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23877-23883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) or testis injected with high dose testosterone. 3X. Mu and C. Chang, manuscript in preparation. In addition, we recently also found that the sperm number and motility were decreased in our TR4KO male mice, which are similar to ERαKO mice.2 Whether suppression of ER by TR4 plays any major roles in the spermatogenesis and other testis functions, therefore, remains an interesting topic for future study.In conclusion, the discovery that the E2/ER signaling pathway can be interrupted by TR4 through protein-protein interaction represents a unique TR4 function. Future studies may further expand the roles of TR4 on the E2/ER function in the reproductive system. The orphan receptors belong to the nuclear receptor superfamily which mediates extracellular hormonal signals to transcriptional response. The roles of orphan receptors have been linked to development, homeostasis, and diseases (1.Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M.

Consistent with its neuronal localization, TR4 also induces the transcription of a cytokine receptor, which is the ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor (9.Young W.J. Smith S.M. Chang C. J. Biol.

In addition to direct transcriptional regulation, TR4 can also modulate other nuclear receptors' transactivation. Previous studies have indicated that TR4 can compete for binding to the hormone response elements of retinoic acid receptor (RAR), retinoid X receptor (RXR) (6.Lee Y.F. Young W.J. Burbach J.P.

TR4 may also inhibit peroxisome proliferator activated receptor α (PPARα)-induced transactivation by competitive binding to PPAR response elements and through competition for coactivators such as RIP140 (10.Yan Z.H.

Recently, TR4 has been found to interact with the androgen receptor (AR). The AR-TR4 interaction could then result in the mutual suppression of AR- or TR4-mediated transcription (11.Lee Y.F.

The (−)-end (pointed end) of actin filaments, does not bind profilin-actin (5Tilney L.G. Bonder E.M. Coluccio L.M. Mooseker M.S. J.

This behavior of the complex is explained by the orientation of the actin protomers in the actin filament giving it polarity (12Huxley H.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1963; 7: 281-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar), by the location of the profilin binding site on actin (13Schutt C.E. Myslik J.C. Rozycki M.D. Goonesekere N.C. Lindberg U. Nature. 1993; 365: 810-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar), and the strength of the profilin-actin interaction (6Pollard T.D. Cooper J.A.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9274-9283Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Profilin binds to the (+)-end of the actin monomer leaving the (−)-end free to interact with the (+)-end of actin nuclei or filaments. Consequently, in the presence of (+)-end capping agents like members of the gelsolin family, profilin efficiently sequesters actin monomers and causes depolymerization of actin filaments.Profilin greatly lowers the affinity for both ATP and divalent cation on actin, thereby increasing their exchange rates (14Mockrin S.C. Korn E.D. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 5359-5362Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 15Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Machesky L.M. Doberstein S.K. Pollard T.D. J.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2769-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that this effect of profilin on actin might be importantin vivo during conditions of rapid filament turnover, when the exchange of ADP for ATP otherwise might be rate-limiting (16Selden L.A. Kinosian H.J. Estes J.E. Gershman L.C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2769-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar).To learn more about the nature of the profilin-actin complex and its significance in the actin polymerization process, a covalently cross-linked profilin-β/γ-actin complex (PxA)1 was produced. The value of PxA as a tool for in vivo studies of the profilin-actin complex was illustrated in a recent report describing the effects on the organization of the microfilament system of cultured cells by microinjected PxA (17Hajkova L. Nyman T. Lindberg U. Karlsson R. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 112-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).The present study describes the preparation of PxA, the evaluation of its structural characteristics, and its use in studies of actin filament formation from profilin-actin in vitro. The PxA complex retained the capacities of wild type profilin-actin (PA) to bind DNase I and poly(l-proline) (PLP), and to bind and exchange nucleotide with kinetics close to that of PA. This indicates that the surface structure of PA was conserved all through the cross-linking reaction. The PxA complex did not hydrolyze ATP even under actin-polymerizing conditions (1 mmMgCl2, 100 mm KCl), and it could neither polymerize nor participate in filament formation from unmodified actin. It did, however, interfere with the formation of actin filaments, indicating that it retained the capacity to interact with the (+)-end of growing filaments. These results are discussed in comparison with a differently cross-linked profilin-actin complex (18Gutsche-Perelroizen I. Lepault J. Ott A. Carlier M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6234-6243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Crystallographic analysis showed PxA to be closely similar to unmodified profilin-actin.DISCUSSIONAs shown here, the structure and biochemical characteristics of PxA are closely similar to those of unmodified PA with the exception that it does not polymerize.Intrinsic ATPase ActivityActin binds ATP tightly in complex with a divalent cation (38Valentin-Ranc C.

Nature. 1990; 347: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (1522) Google Scholar). Under nonpolymerizing conditions, the ATP is slowly hydrolyzed, an activity that appears to be intrinsic to the actin monomer and not dependent on dimer formation (40Brenner S.L. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 841-844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Schüler H. The Molecular Dynamics of Actin.Ph.D. thesis. Stockholm University, Stockholm2000Google Scholar). Replacing Ca2+ by Mg2+ at the high affinity divalent cation binding site lowers the rate of nucleotide exchange and enhances the intrinsic ATPase activity (25Kinosian H.J. Selden L.A. Estes J.E. Gershman L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8683-8691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Kinosian H.J. Selden L.A. Gershman L.C. Estes J.E.

Chem. 1995; 270: 11415-11423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This may be related to the observation that Mg2+ induces a structural change, probably the closing of the interdomain cleft, that protects the region around Lys-68 in the interdomain cleft from proteolytic attack (44Strzelecka-Golaszewska H. Moraczewska J. Khaitlina S.Y. Mossakowska M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 731-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar).The binding of profilin to actin counteracts this Mg2+effect in that it greatly lowers the affinity for the nucleotide on actin, increasing its rate of exchange (14Mockrin S.C. Korn E.D. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 5359-5362Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 15Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Machesky L.M. Doberstein S.K. Pollard T.D. J.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2769-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The explanation for this is found in the flexibility of actin in the interdomain region that allows opening and closing of the nucleotide-binding cleft (13Schutt C.E. Myslik J.C. Rozycki M.D. Goonesekere N.C. Lindberg U. Nature. 1993; 365: 810-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar,28Chik J.K. Lindberg U. Schutt C.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 607-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Shear motions involving the interdomain Gln-137–Ser-145 helix connecting subdomains 1 and 3 bring about a 2.8° rotation of subdomain 1 that results in an outward shift of the Asn-12–Cys-17 loop, exposing the ATP phosphate tail to solution (28Chik J.K. Lindberg U. Schutt C.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 607-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 45Page R. Lindberg U. Schutt C.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 463-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Importantly, the tight-to-open state transition disrupts divalent cation coordination with amino acid residues in the cleft: Asp-11 and Asp-154 in subdomains 1 and 3, respectively; and Gln-137 in the shearing helix. The profilin binding site on actin spans these subdomains on the (+)-end of the monomer, on the opposite side of the interdomain helix relative to the nucleotide binding cleft. This explains how the binding of ATP to actin depends on the divalent cation (25Kinosian H.J. Selden L.A. Estes J.E. Gershman L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8683-8691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46West J.J. Nagy B. Gergely J. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 1140-1145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and how profilin might enhance nucleotide dissociation by disrupting cation coordination (42Kinosian H.J. Selden L.A. Gershman L.C. Estes J.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13176-13188Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The findings that profilin inhibits ATP hydrolysis on the actin monomer, under nonpolymerizing conditions (37Tobacman L.S. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4166-4170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as well as under polymerizing conditions as shown here, supports the view that profilin-actin is in an open state conformation under physiological salt concentrations, even in the presence of Mg2+.Filament Formation from PA and the Structure of F-actinEarlier studies suggested the possibility that PA might interact directly with the (+)-end during filament formation (5Tilney L.G. Bonder E.M. Coluccio L.M. Mooseker M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 112-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 6Pollard T.D. Cooper J.A.

Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This view was supported by determination of free unpolymerized actin under steady state polymerizing conditions in the presence of mutant profilins with varying affinity for actin (9Korenbaum E. Nordberg P. Björkegren-Sjögren C. Schutt C.E. Lindberg U. Karlsson R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9274-9283Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The present investigation demonstrates that PxA interferes with both nucleation and elongation phases of the polymerization reaction of actin in the presence of non-cross-linked material. This indicates that the PA complex can bind to the (+)-end of actin nuclei and filaments, and, unless profilin dissociates so as to allow the final annealing of its ferried actin monomer, the incorporation is aborted and the complex dissociates from the growing filament.Because profilin inhibits ATP hydrolysis on actin, profilin release during polymer formation from PA must occur prior to ATP hydrolysis. This implies that the initial binding of native PA to the (+)-end of actin filaments induces a conformational change in actin that promotes the dissociation of profilin. In this model, the ensuing ATP hydrolysis and Pi release are coupled to further structural changes during which the actin subunit adopts its final F-actin conformation.Recently, a covalently cross-linked complex comprising profilin and rabbit α-actin, denoted PAcov, was described (18Gutsche-Perelroizen I. Lepault J. Ott A. Carlier M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6234-6243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This complex was obtained by activating actin with the EDC/NHS reagent prior to the addition of profilin. Based on an earlier report on the covalent coupling of Acanthamoeba profilin and actin, shown to involve Lys-115 of profilin and Glu-364 of actin (30Vandekerckhove J.S. Kaiser D.A. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), the cross-link of PAcov was assumed to engage Lys-125 of profilin (corresponding to K115 in the amoeba profilin) and Glu-364 of actin. The alternative protocol used here linked Glu-82 of profilin to Lys-113 of actin. The two complexes, PAcov and PxA, behave differently in that PAcov can form filaments by itself, or together with uncomplexed actin, whereas PxA cannot. It was argued (18Gutsche-Perelroizen I. Lepault J. Ott A. Carlier M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6234-6243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) that the formation of helical filaments from PAcov is not predicted by the Holmes/Lorenz F-actin model (48Holmes K.C. Popp D. Gebhard W. Kabsch W. Nature. 1990; 347: 44-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar, 49Lorenz M. Popp D. Holmes K.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 826-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar) because PAcov would not only interfere with the formation of the long-pitch helix, but should cap actin filaments at their (+)-end. Alternatively, if the actin ribbon structure found in the profilin-actin crystals is an assembly intermediate in the formation of F-actin (13Schutt C.E. Myslik J.C. Rozycki M.D. Goonesekere N.C. Lindberg U. Nature. 1993; 365: 810-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar), converting to an F-actin helix upon release of profilin (50Cedergren-Zeppezauer E.S. Goonesekere N.C. Rozycki M.D. Myslik J.C. Dauter Z. Lindberg U. Schutt C.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 240: 459-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), then PAcov should form nonhelical profilin-actin ribbons, according to these authors (18Gutsche-Perelroizen I. Lepault J. Ott A. Carlier M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6234-6243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Instead, it was found that PAcov formed filaments with the same helical periodicity as native F-actin.However, it should be noted that actin amino acid residue, Glu-364, involved in the PAcov cross-link is located in a turn near the actin C terminus at the outer “edge” of subdomain 1, in a region known to be flexible and particularly sensitive to polymerization conditions (Fig. 8). During incorporation of PAcov, at the (+)-end of an actin filament, it is conceivable that the tethered profilin detaches from its interfacial contact with actin and swings out to the side of the filament. This movement exposes the (+)-end of the filament for interaction with an incoming PAcov heterodimer. Thus, the Holmes/Lorenz model of F-actin and also profilin-actin ribbon-based models are compatible with the observation that PAcov can form normally appearing F-actin filaments.The difference between PAcov and PxA in the ability to form filaments most likely arises from differences in the freedom of profilin to shift in position relative to actin during the interaction with actin nuclei or polymers. As discussed above, in the case of PAcov, such shifts might enable normal polymerization reactions, involving the release of profilin from (+)-end assembly intermediates. In the case of PxA, the cross-linked residue, Lys-113, protrudes from the center of subdomain 1, a region not expected to be unusually flexible. Thus, for PxA, in contrast to PAcov,the position of the cross-link apparently prevents the dislocation of profilin and subsequent incorporation of the actin subunit into the filament, aborting the assembly at the intermediate stage.The observation that PAcov forms helical filaments with the same periodicity as native F-actin is most interesting, because it would seem to provide an opportunity to determine the orientation of the actin monomer in F-actin. This is important, because the monomer orientation in the Holmes/Lorenz model of F-actin differs from that in the actin ribbon found in the profilin-actin crystals. Reconstructions of PAcov filaments from electron micrographs may reveal the location of Glu-364 of actin relative to the filament axis accurately enough to discriminate between the two cases. Profilin, originally isolated as a 1:1 complex with β-actin (1Carlsson L. Nyström L.E. Lindberg U. Kannan K.K. Cid-Dresdner H. Lövgren S. J. Mol.

The (−)-end (pointed end) of actin filaments, does not bind profilin-actin (5Tilney L.G. Bonder E.M. Coluccio L.M. Mooseker M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 112-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 6Pollard T.D. Cooper J.A. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 6631-6641Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 11Markey F. Larsson H. Weber K. Lindberg U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 704: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This behavior of the complex is explained by the orientation of the actin protomers in the actin filament giving it polarity (12Huxley H.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1963; 7: 281-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar), by the location of the profilin binding site on actin (13Schutt C.E. Myslik J.C. Rozycki M.D. Goonesekere N.C. Lindberg U. Nature. 1993; 365: 810-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar), and the strength of the profilin-actin interaction (6Pollard T.D. Cooper J.A. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 6631-6641Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 9Korenbaum E. Nordberg P. Björkegren-Sjögren C. Schutt C.E. Lindberg U. Karlsson R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9274-9283Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Profilin binds to the (+)-end of the actin monomer leaving the (−)-end free to interact with the (+)-end of actin nuclei or filaments. Consequently, in the presence of (+)-end capping agents like members of the gelsolin family, profilin efficiently sequesters actin monomers and causes depolymerization of actin filaments. Profilin greatly lowers the affinity for both ATP and divalent cation on actin, thereby increasing their exchange rates (14Mockrin S.C. Korn E.D. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 5359-5362Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 15Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Machesky L.M. Doberstein S.K. Pollard T.D. J.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2769-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that this effect of profilin on actin might be importantin vivo during conditions of rapid filament turnover, when the exchange of ADP for ATP otherwise might be rate-limiting (16Selden L.A. Kinosian H.J. Estes J.E. Gershman L.C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2769-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). To learn more about the nature of the profilin-actin complex and its significance in the actin polymerization process, a covalently cross-linked profilin-β/γ-actin complex (PxA)1 was produced. The value of PxA as a tool for in vivo studies of the profilin-actin complex was illustrated in a recent report describing the effects on the organization of the microfilament system of cultured cells by microinjected PxA (17Hajkova L. Nyman T. Lindberg U. Karlsson R. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 112-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The present study describes the preparation of PxA, the evaluation of its structural characteristics, and its use in studies of actin filament formation from profilin-actin in vitro. The PxA complex retained the capacities of wild type profilin-actin (PA) to bind DNase I and poly(l-proline) (PLP), and to bind and exchange nucleotide with kinetics close to that of PA. This indicates that the surface structure of PA was conserved all through the cross-linking reaction. The PxA complex did not hydrolyze ATP even under actin-polymerizing conditions (1 mmMgCl2, 100 mm KCl), and it could neither polymerize nor participate in filament formation from unmodified actin. It did, however, interfere with the formation of actin filaments, indicating that it retained the capacity to interact with the (+)-end of growing filaments. These results are discussed in comparison with a differently cross-linked profilin-actin complex (18Gutsche-Perelroizen I. Lepault J. Ott A. Carlier M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6234-6243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Crystallographic analysis showed PxA to be closely similar to unmodified profilin-actin. DISCUSSIONAs shown here, the structure and biochemical characteristics of PxA are closely similar to those of unmodified PA with the exception that it does not polymerize.Intrinsic ATPase ActivityActin binds ATP tightly in complex with a divalent cation (38Valentin-Ranc C. Carlier M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20871-20880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Kabsch W. Mannherz H.G. Suck D. Pai E.F. Holmes K.C. Nature. 1990; 347: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (1522) Google Scholar). Under nonpolymerizing conditions, the ATP is slowly hydrolyzed, an activity that appears to be intrinsic to the actin monomer and not dependent on dimer formation (40Brenner S.L. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 841-844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Schüler H. The Molecular Dynamics of Actin.Ph.D. thesis. Stockholm University, Stockholm2000Google Scholar). Replacing Ca2+ by Mg2+ at the high affinity divalent cation binding site lowers the rate of nucleotide exchange and enhances the intrinsic ATPase activity (25Kinosian H.J. Selden L.A. Estes J.E. Gershman L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8683-8691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Kinosian H.J. Selden L.A. Gershman L.C. Estes J.E.

Chem. 1995; 270: 11415-11423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This may be related to the observation that Mg2+ induces a structural change, probably the closing of the interdomain cleft, that protects the region around Lys-68 in the interdomain cleft from proteolytic attack (44Strzelecka-Golaszewska H. Moraczewska J. Khaitlina S.Y. Mossakowska M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 731-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar).The binding of profilin to actin counteracts this Mg2+effect in that it greatly lowers the affinity for the nucleotide on actin, increasing its rate of exchange (14Mockrin S.C. Korn E.D. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 5359-5362Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 15Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Machesky L.M. Doberstein S.K. Pollard T.D. J.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2769-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The explanation for this is found in the flexibility of actin in the interdomain region that allows opening and closing of the nucleotide-binding cleft (13Schutt C.E. Myslik J.C. Rozycki M.D. Goonesekere N.C. Lindberg U. Nature. 1993; 365: 810-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar,28Chik J.K. Lindberg U. Schutt C.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 607-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Shear motions involving the interdomain Gln-137–Ser-145 helix connecting subdomains 1 and 3 bring about a 2.8° rotation of subdomain 1 that results in an outward shift of the Asn-12–Cys-17 loop, exposing the ATP phosphate tail to solution (28Chik J.K. Lindberg U. Schutt C.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 607-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 45Page R. Lindberg U. Schutt C.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 463-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Importantly, the tight-to-open state transition disrupts divalent cation coordination with amino acid residues in the cleft: Asp-11 and Asp-154 in subdomains 1 and 3, respectively; and Gln-137 in the shearing helix. The profilin binding site on actin spans these subdomains on the (+)-end of the monomer, on the opposite side of the interdomain helix relative to the nucleotide binding cleft. This explains how the binding of ATP to actin depends on the divalent cation (25Kinosian H.J. Selden L.A. Estes J.E. Gershman L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8683-8691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46West J.J. Nagy B. Gergely J. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 1140-1145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and how profilin might enhance nucleotide dissociation by disrupting cation coordination (42Kinosian H.J. Selden L.A. Gershman L.C. Estes J.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13176-13188Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The findings"

Despite the physiological importance of the complex, we have only a patchy view of the C4BP-binding site in protein S. Based on phage display experiments, protein S residues 447–460 were suggested to form part of the binding site. Several experimental approaches were now used to further elucidate the structural requirements for protein S binding to C4BP. Peptides comprising residues 447–460, 451–460, or 453–460 of protein S were found to inhibit the protein S-C4BP interaction, whereas deletion of residues 459–460 from the peptide caused complete loss of inhibition. In recombinant protein S, each of residues 447–460 was mutated to Ala, and the protein S variants were tested for binding to C4BP. The Y456A mutation reduced binding to C4BP ∼10-fold, and a peptide corresponding to residues 447–460 of this mutant was less inhibitory than the parent peptide. A further decrease in binding was observed using a recombinant variant in which a site for N-linked glycosylation was moved from position 458 to 456 (Y456N/N458T). A monoclonal antibody (HPSf) selective for free protein S reacted poorly with the Y456A variant but reacted efficiently with the other variants. A second antibody, HPS 34, which partially inhibited the protein S-C4BP interaction, reacted poorly with several of the Ala mutants, suggesting that its epitope was located in the 451–460 region. Phage display analysis of the HPS 34 antibody further identified this region as its epitope. Taken together, our results suggest that residues 453–460 of protein S form part of a more complex binding site for C4BP.

Protein S and APC form a complex on the surface of negatively charged phospholipid membranes, and protein S is involved in localizing and orienting the active site of APC toward its substrates (7.Walker F.J.

The physiological importance of the anticoagulant function of protein S is supported by the association between heterozygous protein S deficiency and an increased risk of thrombosis (17.Aiach M. Borgel D. Gaussem P. Emmerich J. Alhenc Gelas M. Gandrille S. Semin. Hematol. 1997; 34: 205-216PubMed Google Scholar). Upon binding to C4BP, protein S loses its APC cofactor activity, whereas the functions of C4BP are not perturbed (18.Dahlbäck B. J. Biol.

C4b-binding protein activated protein C γ-carboxyglutamic acid sex hormone-binding globulin horseradish peroxidase laminin globular complement control protein enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay wild-type C4BP and protein S are multidomain proteins. Protein S contains a γ-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) domain, a thrombin-sensitive loop (thrombin-sensitive region), four epidermal growth factor-like domains, and a COOH-terminal region that is homologous to sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG). The SHBG-like region comprises two laminin globular (LG) domains (LG1 and LG2), a fold present in the COOH-terminal part of the laminin α chain, and many other extracellular matrix proteins (21.Joseph D.R.

C4BP is an approximately 570-kDa glycoprotein composed of 6–8 polypeptide chains connected at their COOH-terminal ends by disulfide bridges, giving the oligomer a spider-like shape, as revealed by high resolution electron microscopy (29.Dahlbäck B.

The major isoform of C4BP comprises seven α chains and a β chain, whereas the minor isoform has no β chain and does not interact with protein S (30.Hillarp A. Hessing M. Dahlbäck B. FEBS Lett. 1989; 259: 53-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Although C4BP is an acute phase protein, it is primarily the form lacking the β chain that increases during the acute phase inflammatory response so that levels of free protein S remain stable (31.Garcı́a de Frutos P.

The α and β chains are composed of repeating domains of about 60 amino acids denoted complement control protein (CCP) domains. The binding site for protein S is contained in CCP1-CCP2 of the β chain (33.Härdig Y. Dahlbäck B. J. Biol.

Using a molecular model of the β chain in combination with recombinant β chain expression and site-directed mutagenesis, it has been shown that a solvent-exposed hydrophobic patch in CCP1 lined by a positively charged area on an otherwise negatively charged surface forms the key binding site for protein S (35.Webb J.H.

Several studies have demonstrated that the C4BP-binding site in protein S is fully contained in the two LG domains (2.He X. Shen L. Malmborg A.C. Smith K.J. Dahlbäck B. Linse S.

Recombinant truncated protein S variants lacking the COOH-terminal 28–58 residues demonstrated very low affinity for C4BP (4.Nelson R.M. Long G.L.

In addition, specific substitutions of amino acids Lys423, Lys427, and Lys429 with polar amino acids resulted in a 5–10-fold reduction in the affinities (43.Fernandez J.A. Griffin J.H. Chang G.T.

In the present study, we have continued characterizing the binding site in protein S for C4BP, focusing on the region encompassing residues 447–460, which, based on phage display experimentation, was suggested to be involved in C4BP binding (39.Linse S.

Using Ala scanning mutagenesis, peptide inhibition assays, surface plasmon resonance, and monoclonal epitope mapping, the involvement of this region in C4BP binding was elucidated. To gain better insight into the characteristics of the C4BP-binding site, the now presented experimental data and those on record were evaluated on a recently created three-dimensional model for the SHBG-like region of protein S (44.Villoutreix B.O.

HRP was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. 1,2-Phenylene diamine tablets and HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG were obtained from DAKO. N-Glycosidase F was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Five peptides (Table I) with acetylated NH2 termini and amidated COOH termini were synthesized on a MilliGen 9050 Plus synthesizer and purified by high pressure liquid chromatography, as described previously (39.Linse S.

Garcia de Frutos P. Yamazaki T. Villoutreix B.O. Dahlbäck B. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 1627-1633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A total of 13 cDNAs were produced, encoding variants designated S447A, G448A, I449A, Q451A, F452A, H453A, I454A, D455A, Y456A, N457A, N458A, V459A, and S460A. In a fourteenth variant, a new glycosylation consensus sequence was created around position 456 through the substitutions Y456N and N458T. The double mutant (Y456N/N458T) lacked the wild-type carbohydrate side chain at position 458. The mutations were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis using an ABIprism Taqpolymerase-based sequencing kit with fluorescent dye terminators (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Vectors encoding wild-type protein S, the various Ala variants, and the Y456N/N458T double variant were used to transfect monkey kidney COS-1 cells by the DEAE-dextran method (51.Giri T.K. Garcia de Frutos P. Yamazaki T. Villoutreix B.O. Dahlbäck B. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 1627-1633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression levels were determined with an ELISA essentially as described previously (46.Giri T.K. Hillarp A. Härdig Y. Zöller B. Dahlbäck B. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1998; 79: 767-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), except that the wells were coated with PK-anti-hPS, and samples were incubated overnight. The expression levels from confluent 10-cm Petri dishes with 10 ml of added Optimem were found to vary between 35 and 150 ng/ml/24 h. Most mutant expression levels were comparable to those seen for wild-type protein S. Exceptions were F452A (50% of wild type; p = 0.02), I454A (76% of wild type; p = 0.07), Y456A (35% of wild type; p = 0.009), and S460A (75% of wild type;p = 0.04), which demonstrated lower expression. The reported values are the mean of three independent experiments and were compared with the expression of wild-type protein S using a paired Student's t test. Conditioned media containing recombinant proteins were concentrated in Centricon concentrators (Amicon) and stored at −20 °C until further analysis. SDS-PAGE and Western blotting were performed following standard procedures. To deglycosylate the recombinant proteins, 5–10 μl of the concentrated culture medium containing ∼1 μg/ml protein S were treated withN-glycosidase F (0.5 unit/sample) under reducing and denaturing conditions and then analyzed by Western blotting using a polyclonal protein S antiserum The cDNAs encoding wt protein S and the D455A and Y456A protein S variants were used to transfect human embryonic kidney 293 cells using the Lipofectin method, and stable cell lines resistant to G418 were established, as described previously (51.Giri T.K.

The expression level was determined with the ELISA; wt protein S and the D455A mutant were present in ∼2–3 mg/liter, whereas the expression of the Y456A variant was 10–20-fold less. The purified proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using polyclonal protein S antibodies or the M3B monoclonal antibody recognizing Gla residues (50.Brown M.A. Stenberg L.M. Persson U. Stenflo J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19795-19802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The concentration of the proteins was determined by amino acid analysis after acid hydrolysis in 6 m HCl, and the Gla content was measured after base hydrolysis using methods outlined previously (26.He X. Dahlbäck B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 857-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Surface plasmon resonance experiments were carried out using a BIAcore 1000 system. Immobilization was performed using 10 mm Hepes, 0.15m NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, and 0.005% Tween 20, pH 7.4, as flow buffer and a flow rate of 5 μl/min. Equal volumes of 0.1m N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide and 0.4m 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide were mixed, and 40 μl of this solution were injected to activate the carboxymethylated dextran. Then 40 μl of either 25 μg/ml monoclonal antibody against HPS 34 in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.75, or 60 μg/ml C4BP in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5, were injected. Unreacted N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide-ester groups were deactivated by injecting a 20-μl pulse of 1 methanolamine hydrochloride, pH 8.5, and uncoupled protein was removed with 20 μl of 0.1 m HCl. Flow rates of 5–20 μl/min yielded identical results for the binding reactions. Surface plasmon resonance data were fitted as described previously (2.He X. Shen L. Malmborg A.C. Smith K.J.

Binding of protein S to HPS 34 was performed using 10 mmHepes, 0.15 m NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, and 0.005% Tween 20, pH 7.4, as flow buffer. Wild-type recombinant protein S was injected at 12.5, 25, 50, 100, and 200 nmconcentrations. In addition, 50 nm of a 1:1 complex between protein S and C4BP was injected. The association phase was monitored for 12 min, and the dissociation into pure buffer was followed for 4 h. The remaining bound protein S was then removed by washing with 25 μl of 0.1 m HCl. Flow rates of 5–30 μl/min were tested and gave identical results. Binding experiments were also performed using the F452A, I454A, and Y456A mutants. The data were fitted as described previously (2.He X. Shen L. Malmborg A.C. Smith K.J. Dahlbäck B. Linse S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3745-3754Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Binding of protein S to C4BP was performed in a flow buffer comprising 10 mm Hepes, 0.15 m NaCl, 2 mmCaCl2, and 0.005% Tween 20, pH 7.4. Wild-type protein S and variants were injected at concentrations of 1–20 nm. The association phase was monitored for 15 min, and the dissociation into pure buffer was followed for 300 min. Bound protein S was then removed by washing with 25 μl of 0.1 m HCl. Flow rates of 5–30 μl/min were tested and gave identical results. Peptide inhibition of protein S binding to C4BP was performed using 10 mm Hepes, 0.15 m NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, and 0.005% Tween 20, pH 7.4, as flow buffer. Each peptide was injected at concentrations ranging from 1 to 400 μm together with 60 nm protein S. The association phase was monitored for 15 min, and bound protein S or peptide was then removed by washing with 25 μl of 0.1 m HCl. Flow rates of 5–30 μl/min were tested and gave identical results. Conditioned medium containing each recombinant protein S variant was tested for direct binding to immobilized C4BP using the enzyme-linked ligandsorbent assay method, as described previously (46.Giri T.K. Hillarp A. Härdig Y. Zöller B. Dahlbäck B. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1998; 79: 767-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), except that an overnight incubation step was used. The concentration of protein S in each sample was standardized before performing the assays. In brief, wells were coated with purified C4BP (10 μg/ml), blocked with bovine serum albumin, and washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, and 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.5. Conditioned medium containing wild-type protein S or the variants (serially diluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.5) was added, and the plates were incubated overnight at 4 °C. The wells were washed, and HRP-labeled antibody HPS 54 directed against the epidermal growth factor 1-like module of protein S (45.Dahlbäck B. Hildebrand B. Malm J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8127-8135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used for detection of bound protein S. The apparent dissociation constant, KDapp, for the interaction was calculated by fitting the absorbance data to the formulaA n = A/(1 + ( KDapp/C)), whereA n is the observed absorbance, A is the maximum absorbance obtained with wild-type protein S, and Cis the concentration of protein S. It was assumed that the amount of protein S bound was negligible compared with the total concentration of protein S, such that C reflects free protein S. Conditioned medium containing wild-type protein S or the variant proteins was tested for binding to immobilized HPS 34 by ELISA. Bound protein S was detected with the antibody HPS 54 as described previously (46.Giri T.K. Hillarp A. Härdig Y. Zöller B. Dahlbäck B. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1998; 79: 767-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Apparent dissociation constants were calculated as described above. The ability of HPS 34 to inhibit the binding of human protein S to immobilized C4BP was tested using the enzyme-linked ligandsorbent assay method (46.Giri T.K. Hillarp A. Härdig Y. Zöller B. Dahlbäck B. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1998; 79: 767-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In brief, aliquots of 5 nm plasma-purified protein S were preincubated with various concentrations of HPS 34 (up to a 500-fold molar excess) for 30 min at room temperature, and then the samples were added to C4BP-coated wells and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, HRP-labeled HPS 54 was used as the detecting antibody. Phage display experiments using immobilized HPS 34 as a target and random linear 15-mer peptides displayed on the bacteriophage surface were performed as described previously (39.Linse S. Hardig Y. Schultz D.A. Dahlbäck B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14658-14665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The selected peptides were aligned against the protein S sequence using the HOMOFILE and AVEHOM programs (39.Linse S. Hardig Y. Schultz D.A. Dahlbäck B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14658-14665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Five peptides (Table I) were tested for their ability to compete with protein S for binding to C4BP using surface plasmon resonance analysis. Peptides corresponding to residues 447–460, 451–460, and 453–460 of protein S were found to inhibit protein S binding to C4BP (Fig. 1) at concentrations comparable to those observed previously for peptides 439–460 and 447–468 (39.Linse S. Hardig Y. Schultz D.A. Dahlbäck B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14658-14665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The 447–460/Y456A peptide required an ∼3-fold higher concentration to give half-maximum inhibition, and the 447–458 peptide showed no inhibition at the concentrations tested. Thirteen recombinant protein S variants were generated by replacing each amino acid in the 447–460 region of protein S (Fig. 2 A) with Ala. The transiently expressed mutants were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and detected by Western blotting using a polyclonal antibody (PK-anti-hPS) (Fig. 2 B). All migrated as single bands. The N458A and S460A variants exhibited an increased mobility, consistent with loss of the carbohydrate moiety present at residue Asn458 in wild-type protein S (52.Lu D. Xie R. Rydzewski A. Long G. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 77: 1156-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). After deglycosylation, the different recombinant proteins demonstrated migration rates similar to that of deglycosylated wild-type protein S, suggesting that all recombinant proteins were glycosylated to the expected degree. Furthermore, the Western blotting patterns of the deglycosylated recombinant proteins were identical to that of deglycosylated plasma-derived protein S (data not shown). Recombinant protein S was tested in Western blotting and ELISA techniques with a panel of carefully characterized monoclonal antibodies that reacted with conformation-dependent epitopes in different domains to investigate the structural integrity of the proteins and their correct folding. The antibodies tested were HPS 21 (reacting with a calcium-dependent epitope in the Gla domain), HPS 67 (reacting with a calcium-dependent epitope in thrombin-sensitive region), and HPS 54 (reacting with a calcium-dependent epitope in epidermal growth f"
https://openalex.org/W1966438105,"The first report of slow-tight inhibition of xylanase by a bifunctional inhibitor alkalo-thermophilic <i>Bacillus</i> inhibitor (ATBI), from an extremophilic <i>Bacillus</i> sp. is described. ATBI inhibits aspartic protease (Dash, C., and Rao, M. (2001) <i>J. Biol. Chem.</i>, 276, 2487–2493) and xylanase (Xyl I) from a <i>Thermomonospora</i> sp. The steady-state kinetics revealed time-dependent competitive inhibition of Xyl I by ATBI, consistent with two-step inhibition mechanism. The inhibition followed a rapid equilibrium step to form a reversible enzyme-inhibitor complex (<i>E</i>I), which isomerizes to the second enzyme-inhibitor complex (<i>E</i>I*), which dissociated at a very slow rate. The rate constants determined for the isomerization of <i>E</i>I to <i>E</i>I*, and the dissociation of <i>E</i>I* were 13 ± 1 × 10<sup>−6</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> and 5 ± 0.5 × 10<sup>−8</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>, respectively. The <i>K</i><sub>i</sub> value for the formation of <i>E</i>I complex was 2.5 ± 0.5 μm, whereas the overall inhibition constant <i>K</i><sub>i</sub>* was 7 ± 1 nm. The conformational changes induced in Xyl I by ATBI were monitored by fluorescence spectroscopy and the rate constants derived were in agreement with the kinetic data. Thus, the conformational alterations were correlated to the isomerization of <i>E</i>I to <i>E</i>I*. ATBI binds to the active site of the enzyme and disturbs the native interaction between the histidine and lysine, as demonstrated by the abolished isoindole fluorescence of <i>o</i>-phthalaldehyde (OPTA)-labeled Xyl I. Our results revealed that the inactivation of Xyl I is due to the disruption of the hydrogen-bonding network between the essential histidine and other residues involved in catalysis and a model depicting the probable interaction between ATBI or OPTA with Xyl I has been proposed."
https://openalex.org/W2066396651,"The lymphocyte-specific protein-tyrosine kinase Lck plays a critical role in T cell activation. In response to T cell antigen receptor binding Lck undergoes phosphorylation on serine residues that include serines 59 and 194. Serine 59 is phosphorylated by ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase. Recently, we showed that in mitotic T cells Lck becomes hyper-phosphorylated on serine residues. In this report, using one-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping analysis, we identify serine 59 as a site of <i>in vivo</i> mitotic phosphorylation in Lck. The mitotic phosphorylation of serine 59 did not require either the catalytic activity or functional SH2 or SH3 domains of Lck. In addition, the presence of ZAP-70 also was dispensable for the phosphorylation of serine 59. Although previous studies demonstrated that serine 59 is a substrate for the ERK MAPK pathway, inhibitors of this pathway did not block the mitotic phosphorylation of serine 59. These results identify serine 59 as a site of mitotic phosphorylation in Lck and suggest that a pathway distinct from that induced by antigen receptor signaling is responsible for its phosphorylation. Thus, the phosphorylation of serine 59 is the result of two distinct signaling pathways, differentially activated in response to the physiological state of the T cell."

AsS reversibly catalyzes the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent condensation of a citrulline with an aspartate (Scheme FS1).The ureido oxygen atom of a citrulline attacks the α-P atom of the triphosphate in ATP to produce a citrullyl-AMP intermediate and a pyrophosphate as a leaving group. The AMP moiety of the activated citrullyl-AMP intermediate is displaced by an aspartate, thus producing an argininosuccinate (1Rochovansky O. Ratner S. J. Biol.

In the structures of the GMP and NAD+ synthetases (3Tesmer J.J. Klem T.J. Deras M.L. Davisson V.J. Smith J.L. Nat. Struct.

Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 806-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), the P-loop specifically interacts with the β- and γ-phosphates of ATP.AsS from Thermus thermophilus HB8 (tAsS), which has been overexpressed in Escherichia coli, has 400 residues per subunit, with a subunit molecular weight of 44,815. The sequence alignment of tAsS with other AsSs by the program CLUSTAL W (9Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55203) Google Scholar) showed that the sequence identities of tAsS with respect to human AsS, yeast AsS, and E. coli AsS are 52.7, 46.5, and 29.3%, respectively. Therefore, it can be assumed that these enzymes have the same folding topology with similar three-dimensional structures, and the structure of tAsS can be used as a reliable molecular model of eukaryotic AsS. The 15.3% amino acid sequence identities were observed among these enzymes with the consensus sequence of Tyr/Phe-Ser-Gly-Gly-Leu-Asp-Thr-Ser (P-loop) specific for the pyrophosphate of ATP (4Bork P. Koonin E.V. Proteins. 1994; 20: 347-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar).Quite recently, the structures of E. coli AsS and its complex with citrulline and aspartate have been solved (10Lemke C.T. Howell P.L. Structure (Lond.). 2001; 9: 1153-1164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The folding of the nucleotide binding domain of the enzyme was shown to be similar to that of the N-type ATP pyrophosphatases, and the binding mode of the substrates (citrulline and aspartate) was clearly determined. ATP was modeled into the active site of E. coliAsS by taking advantage of the GMP and NAD+ synthetase structures, in which the P-loop interacts with the pyrophosphate (β- and γ-phosphates) of ATP. On the basis of this model, the relative orientation of ATP and the substrates in the active site and the conformational change of the enzyme during the catalysis were suggested.We have determined the structure of the native tAsS, tAsS in the complex with intact ATP, and tAsS in the complex with adenylyl imidodiphosphate (ATP analogue, AMP-PNP), arginine (analogue of citrulline), and succinate (analogue of aspartate). Only the γ-phosphate of ATP or AMP-PNP interacts with the P-loop allowing the β-phosphate to be free from interactions with the P-loop and indicating that the location of triphosphate of AMP-PNP is different from that of ATP in the proposed model of E. coli AsS (10Lemke C.T. Howell P.L. Structure (Lond.). 2001; 9: 1153-1164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The loop of tAsS does not show the same specificity for the pyrophosphate that was observed in GMP and NAD+ synthetase structures, but shows a specificity for γ-phosphate (monophosphate). ATP, arginine, and succinate bind to the active site in such a way that the putative reaction sites of these analogues are brought into positions favorable to the catalytic action. This result implies that the enzyme does not require the proposed conformational change of the enzyme for the catalytic process. We now report the x-ray crystallographic study of the following three forms of tAsS: the native form at 2.3-Å resolution, the complex form with ATP at 2.3-Å resolution, and the complex form with AMP-PNP, arginine, and succinate at 1.95-Å resolution. Argininosuccinate synthetase (AsS)1 catalyzes the second step of the urea cycle where a citrulline, the product of the first step catalyzed by ornithine transcarbamoylase, reacts with an aspartate to give an argininosuccinate, which is cleaved into an arginine and a fumarate by argininosuccinase. AsS reversibly catalyzes the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent condensation of a citrulline with an aspartate (Scheme FS1). The ureido oxygen atom of a citrulline attacks the α-P atom of the triphosphate in ATP to produce a citrullyl-AMP intermediate and a pyrophosphate as a leaving group. The AMP moiety of the activated citrullyl-AMP intermediate is displaced by an aspartate, thus producing an argininosuccinate (1Rochovansky O. Ratner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 2254-2260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Rochovansky O. Ratner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 3839-3849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Support for the existence of the citrullyl-AMP intermediate comes from experiments using18O-labeled citrulline (Scheme FS1). Based on the structure of the ATP pyrophosphatase domain of the GMP synthetase (3Tesmer J.J. Klem T.J. Deras M.L. Davisson V.J. Smith J.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 74-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) and the modified version of the P-loop of H-Ser-Gly-Gly-X-Asp-Ser/Thr-Ser/Thr (where H is any hydrophobic amino acid and X is any one) observed in GMP synthetase, NAD+ synthetase, asparagine synthetase, and AsS (4Bork P. Koonin E.V. Proteins. 1994; 20: 347-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), these four distinct enzymes, which show ATP pyrophosphate activity, were proposed to have a common fold specific for nucleotide binding and belong to a new family of “N-type” ATP pyrophosphatases (3Tesmer J.J.

Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16146-16157Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) have been proved to be folded into an open α/β structure with a topology similar to that of the ATP pyrophosphate domain of GMP synthetase. In the structures of the GMP and NAD+ synthetases (3Tesmer J.J. Klem T.J. Deras M.L. Davisson V.J. Smith J.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 74-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 8Devedjiev Y. Symersky J. Singh R. Jedrzejas M. Brouillette C. Brouillette W. Muccio D. Chattopadhyay D. DeLucas L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 806-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), the P-loop specifically interacts with the β- and γ-phosphates of ATP. AsS from Thermus thermophilus HB8 (tAsS), which has been overexpressed in Escherichia coli, has 400 residues per subunit, with a subunit molecular weight of 44,815. The sequence alignment of tAsS with other AsSs by the program CLUSTAL W (9Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55203) Google Scholar) showed that the sequence identities of tAsS with respect to human AsS, yeast AsS, and E. coli AsS are 52.7, 46.5, and 29.3%, respectively. Therefore, it can be assumed that these enzymes have the same folding topology with similar three-dimensional structures, and the structure of tAsS can be used as a reliable molecular model of eukaryotic AsS. The 15.3% amino acid sequence identities were observed among these enzymes with the consensus sequence of Tyr/Phe-Ser-Gly-Gly-Leu-Asp-Thr-Ser (P-loop) specific for the pyrophosphate of ATP (4Bork P. Koonin E.V. Proteins. 1994; 20: 347-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Quite recently, the structures of E. coli AsS and its complex with citrulline and aspartate have been solved (10Lemke C.T. Howell P.L. Structure (Lond.). 2001; 9: 1153-1164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The folding of the nucleotide binding domain of the enzyme was shown to be similar to that of the N-type ATP pyrophosphatases, and the binding mode of the substrates (citrulline and aspartate) was clearly determined. ATP was modeled into the active site of E. coliAsS by taking advantage of the GMP and NAD+ synthetase structures, in which the P-loop interacts with the pyrophosphate (β- and γ-phosphates) of ATP. On the basis of this model, the relative orientation of ATP and the substrates in the active site and the conformational change of the enzyme during the catalysis were suggested. We have determined the structure of the native tAsS, tAsS in the complex with intact ATP, and tAsS in the complex with adenylyl imidodiphosphate (ATP analogue, AMP-PNP), arginine (analogue of citrulline), and succinate (analogue of aspartate). Only the γ-phosphate of ATP or AMP-PNP interacts with the P-loop allowing the β-phosphate to be free from interactions with the P-loop and indicating that the location of triphosphate of AMP-PNP is different from that of ATP in the proposed model of E. coli AsS (10Lemke C.T. Howell P.L. Structure (Lond.). 2001; 9: 1153-1164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The loop of tAsS does not show the same specificity for the pyrophosphate that was observed in GMP and NAD+ synthetase structures, but shows a specificity for γ-phosphate (monophosphate). ATP, arginine, and succinate bind to the active site in such a way that the putative reaction sites of these analogues are brought into positions favorable to the catalytic action. This result implies that the enzyme does not require the proposed conformational change of the enzyme for the catalytic process. We now report the x-ray crystallographic study of the following three forms of tAsS: the native form at 2.3-Å resolution, the complex form with ATP at 2.3-Å resolution, and the complex form with AMP-PNP, arginine, and succinate at 1.95-Å resolution."

These studies highlight the extensive diversification of cyclophilins in an important human parasite and a closely related model organism. Cyclophilins belong to a large family of proteins that have been found in most organisms including parasites. It is thought that cyclophilins play an important role in protein folding because of their peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) 1The abbreviations used are: PPIasepeptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomeraseCypAhuman cyclophilin ACsAcyclosporin AMBPmaltose-binding proteinGFPgreen fluorescent protein activity, which can be measured in vivo (1.Stamnes M.A. Shieh B.H.

Most cyclophilins bind the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A (CsA), resulting in specific inhibition of their PPIase activity (5.Handschumacher R.E. Harding M.W. Rice J. Drugge R.J. Speicher D.W. Science. 1984; 226: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (1457) Google Scholar, 6.Fischer G. Wittmann-Liebold B. Lang K. Kiefhaber T. Schmid F.X. Nature. 1989; 337: 476-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar). Therefore, CsA may interfere with the correct folding of proline-containing proteins that are the natural substrates for cyclophilins. It remains to be determined whether this is the mechanism by which CsA and its nonimmunosuppressive derivatives exert lethal structural damage on a number of important parasites. For example, subimmunosuppressive levels of CsA cause gross herniation in the gut and blistering of the tegumental surface of Schistosoma mansoni (7.Munro G.H. McLaren D.J. Parasitology. 1990; 100, Pt 1: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In the case of Litomosoides cariniimicrofilariae, the drug causes shrinkage of the parasite and stiffening of the surrounding sheath (8.Zahner H. Schultheiss K. J.

Thus far, only CypA homologs have been found in parasites, with the exception of the filarial worms. In addition to this highly conserved form, designated CYP-2 in filarial parasites, Brugia malayi, Onchocerca volvulus, and Dirofilaria immitis express two divergent cyclophilins that are more related to human nuclear-specific cyclophilin (CYP-3/4) and natural killer cell cyclophilin (CYP-1). These cyclophilins are considerably larger than human CypA, prefer other synthetic substrates, and display a reduced sensitivity to CsA (19.Page A.P. Landry D. Wilson G.G. Carlow C.K.

We report here the cloning, expression, and characterization of a new class of cyclophilin from the important human parasite O. volvulus (OvCYP-16) and the model organismCaenorhabditis elegans (CeCYP-16). These cyclophilins are distinct from the other cyclophilins present in the data base from C. elegans (designated CeCYP-1 through CeCYP-15, and CeCYP-17) orO. volvulus (designated OvCYP-1,OvCYP-2, OvCYP-4, OvCYP-5, andOvCYP-10). The CYP-16 cyclophilins represent novel, highly diversified cyclophilins with respect to the composition of the drug-binding site and are particularly interesting because, unlike other parasite cyclophilins described thus far, they are apparently not found in mammals. We present molecular and biochemical studies on these new enzymes and use transgenic methodologies in C. elegansto analyze developmental and spatial expression of CeCYP-16 to gain insight into the potential natural substrate(s) for these enzymes. All reagents, kits, and bacterial strains used in cloning, expression, and sequencing (described below) were obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA) and used as described by the manufacturer, unless otherwise specified. A partial cDNA clone (552 bp) encoding a putative cyclophilin was isolated from an O. volvulus L3 stage Lambda Uni-ZAP XR cDNA library kindly provided by Dr. Steven Williams. The library was screened by hybridization (22.Grandea A.G.d. Tuyen L.K. Asikin N. Davis T.B. Philipp M. Cohen C. McReynolds L.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1989; 35: 31-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) with a 1300-bp genomic fragment ofO. volvulus furin (a gift from Dr. Jingmin Jin). The fragment was radiolabeled with [α-32P]dATP by oligonucleotide random priming using the NEBlot kit. Plaque lifts (23.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) were hybridized in 6× SSC at 60 °C overnight with the32P-labeled probe (1 × 106 cpm/ml hybridization solution). After hybridization, the plaque lifts were washed twice at room temperature and once at 60 °C for 30 min each in 2× SSC containing 0.1% SDS. After plaque purification of nine clones, the Bluescript phagemids were excised from Lambda ZAP (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). After sequencing, the phagemid clone with the smallest insert (552 bp; fragment B) was identified as a fragment of a putative O. volvulus cyclophilin (OvCYP-16) by using the National Center for Biotechnology Information BLAST program. This clone was isolated due to significant homology in a short stretch of sequence (39 nucleotides) encoding part of the catalytic domain of each enzyme (data not shown). To obtain a full-length cDNA of OvCYP-16, two primers, 5′-gcgagtggacattcctttgacc-3′ (antisense) and 5′-ccattcaatgatattgttcc-3′ (sense), were designed using the sequence derived from the 5′ and 3′ ends of the partial cDNA. Two PCR products, designated fragment A (241 bp) and fragment C (322 bp), were obtained by performing thermal cycling on the O. volvulus L3 cDNA library with the following primer pairs: antisense primer/T3 primer, 5′-aattaaccctcactaaaggg-3′; and sense primer/T7 primer, 5′-gtaatacgctcactatagggc-3′. Typical PCR reactions contained 2 μl ofO. volvulus L3 cDNA library stock boiled for 10 min before use, 2 units of Vent polymerase, 1× thermal polymerase buffer, 6 mm MgSO4, 0.2 mm deoxynucleotide triphosphate, and 250 nm of each primer. The reactions were heated at 95 °C for 5 min, followed by 20 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min. PCR products were purified with the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) and then subcloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega, Madison, WI) for DNA sequence analysis. Fragments A and C were digested separately withEcoRI/ClaI and BtgI/Xhol, respectively. The 459-bp partial OvCYP-16 cDNA (fragment B) was released from the Bluescript phagemid with ClaI andBtgI. These three fragments (fragments A, B, and C) were ligated into pUC19 digested with EcoRI and SalI. The ligation was performed at 16 °C overnight. Deduced amino acid sequences were aligned and compared using the Clustal method (24.Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56002) Google Scholar), and searches for homologies to other cyclophilins were performed using the National Center for Biotechnology Information BLAST program. A genomic DNA sequence encoding the putative homolog ofOvCYP-16 was identified in the C. elegans cosmid Y17G7B using the C. elegans BLAST program (Sanger Institute, Cambridge, United Kingdom). This genomic DNA sequence was used to search the C. elegansexpressed sequence tag data base, and a clone (yk648d4) was found that likely represented a full-length cDNA (CeCYP-16) homolog of OvCYP-16. Thermal cycling primers were designed to enable cloning of OvCYP-16 into plasmid pMAL-c2X to generate a fusion with maltose-binding protein (MBP). The forward primer corresponded to the open reading frame of OvCYP-16 and had the sequence 5′-atgtcaaacgttattatcgaattcggc-3′, generating a 5′ blunt end. The reverse primer, 5′-cccaagcttctattcaactttattgaagaccgc-3′, corresponded to the 3′ end of the gene including a downstream termination codon and a HindIII recognition site. 50-μl PCR reactions were carried out using 0.1 μg of the pUC19-OvCYP-16 construct as template, 2 units of Vent DNA polymerase, 5 μl of 10× thermal polymerase buffer, 5 mmMgSO4, 0.2 mm deoxynucleotide triphosphate, and 250 nm of each primer. The thermal cycling conditions used were 95 °C for 5 min, followed by 25 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min. The reaction product was purified and digested with HindIII before ligation into pMAL-c2X digested with XmnI and HindIII. Plasmid DNA was isolated, and the insert was sequenced in both directions using the CircumVent thermal cycle dideoxy DNA sequencing kit. Production and purification of the MBP fusion protein were as described by the manufacturer. The cDNA clone yk648d4 (GenBank™ accession numberAV195981) was obtained from Dr. Yuji Kohara, and two thermal cycling primers were designed to subclone CeCYP-16 into pMAL-c2X for protein expression. The forward primer (5′-atgagtaatcaatatatcaacgagccg-3′) corresponded to the open reading frame of CeCYP-16 preceded by an ATG codon. The reverse primer (5′-cccaagcttctaaaccttattaaaaacggcc-3′) corresponded to the 3′ end of the gene and included a downstream termination codon and aHindIII recognition site. PCR reactions (50 μl) were performed as described above using 3 μl of yk648d4 Lambda DNA stock as template. PCR products were purified and digested withHindIII before ligation into pMAL-c2X digested withXmnI and HindIII. The recombinant plasmid DNA was isolated, and the insert was sequenced in both directions to ensure authenticity. Production and purification of the MBP fusion protein were as described by the manufacturer. Site-directed mutagenesis of the PPIase domain of the previously described B. malayi BmCYP-1 (19.Page A.P. Landry D. Wilson G.G. Carlow C.K. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11545-11550Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) was accomplished by the method of Kunkel (25.Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4903) Google Scholar). The histidine residue (132) ofBmCYP-1 was substituted with aspartic acid using the following mutagenic primer: 5′-attactacaacacctgcgccagatctcaatatatccatgtggtatttgg-3′. The bases encoding the mutated amino acid are underlined. Mutagenesis of BmCYP-1 was verified using the CircumVent thermal cycle dideoxy DNA sequencing kit. The protocol used for the production and purification of BmCYP-1 (H132D) was as described previously (26.Ma D. Carlow C.K. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 92: 361-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The various filarial PPIases were prepared and purified as described previously (19.Page A.P. Landry D. Wilson G.G. Carlow C.K.

Pairwise identity comparisons of OvCYP-16 and CeCYP-16 to other cyclophilins were performed using the program GAP. Alignment of the derived amino acid sequence of the enzyme domains ofOvCYP-16, CeCYP-16, and other cyclophilins was made using the program PILEUP (gap weight = 3.0, gap length weight = 0.1). Phylogenetic tree analysis was performed using the Clustal method (24.Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56002) Google Scholar) with the PAM250 residue weight table in the Magalign program in DNA star. The PPIase activity of OvCYP-16 and CeCYP-16 fusion proteins was determined by measuring thecis-trans conversion of 13 available synthetic peptide substrates of the general structureN-succinyl-Ala-Xaa-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide (Bachem), where Xaa is any of the 12 amino acids listed in Table I.

To determine inhibition of enzyme activity by CsA (Sigma), recombinant enzyme (30 nm to 10 μm) was preincubated for 1 h at 4 °C with CsA (1 nm to 5 μm), and the assay was performed as described above. Data were fitted into the following equation: k obs =k obs*/(1 + [CsA]/IC50), wherek obs* is k obs in the absence of CsA (19.Page A.P. Landry D. Wilson G.G. Carlow C.K. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11545-11550Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Wild-type C. elegans were obtained from the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center (St. Paul, MN). Worms were maintained on nematode growth medium agar plates withEscherichia coli (OP50) as a food source (28.Brenner S. Genetics. 1974; 77: 71-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A CYP-16::GFP expression construct (pIP10) was generated as follows: A 1213-bp region upstream of the CYP-16 start site was PCR-amplified from C. elegans genomic DNA using the following primers: 5′-aaggcgtctagacgccggctgaaatattcac-3′ and 5′-cagtcgccaagcttctcctgaaatagtcgtttcg-3′. Amplification products were subcloned using the TOPO TA® Dual Promotor Cloning Kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Restriction sites near the 5′ ends of the primers (XbaI and HindIII) were then used to excise the insert and clone it into a multicloning site upstream of GFP in the pPD95.75 vector (29.Fire A. Harrison S.W. Dixon D. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 93: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). 50–75 ng/μl pIP10 was microinjected into the gonad of adult wild-type worms along with 100 ng/μl pRF-4 plasmid containing the dominant marker, rol-6 (su1006). Two independent worm lines demonstrating the rolling marker phenotype were isolated and designated IP102: nbEx3[rol-6(su1006)CYP-16::GFP] and IP103: nbEx4[rol-6(su1006)CYP-16::GFP]. Rolling worms of all stages were observed by fluorescence microscopy to determine where GFP was expressed. The complete cDNA of OvCYP-16 encoding an O. volvuluscyclophilin is 823-bp long and possesses an open reading frame of 669 bp, with a putative initiation codon at position 41 (GenBank™ accession number AF017738). The conserved nematode-specific 22-nucleotide spliced leader sequence (30.Takacs A.M. Denker J.A. Perrine K.G. Maroney P.A. Nilsen T.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The 3′-untranslated region is 114-bp long with a putative polyadenylation signal (AATAAA) at position 784. The translated protein (223 amino acids) has a predicted molecular mass of 25.2 kDa with a pI of 6.75 and contains a PPIase domain (Figs. 1 and3).Figure 3Alignment of the deduced amino acid sequences of various cyclophilins.

C-terminal asterisks indicate translational terminations. In the CYP-1 and CYP-3 sequences, the additional C-terminal residues of CYP-1 and the additional N- and C-terminal residues of CYP-3 are not shown. Dashes indicate residues identical to the corresponding residue in OvCYP-16.Dots denote gaps. The residues important in CsA binding (33.Pflugl G. Kallen J. Schirmer T. Jansonius J.N. Zurini M.G.

The derived amino acid sequence (Figs. 1 and 3) and phylogenetic tree analyses (Fig. 2) indicate thatOvCYP-16 and CeCYP-16 are novel cyclophilins and homologs. The proteins are the same size (223 amino acids), possess a short tail that is KR-rich, and share 75% similarity and 64% identity. OvCYP-16 possesses only 48%, 43%, and 46% similarity, respectively, to the previously described cyclophilinsOvCYP-1 (20.Hong X. Ma D. Page A.P. Kumar S. Carlow C.K. Exp. Parasitol. 1998; 88: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), OvCYP-2 (27.Ma D. Hong X. Raghavan N. Scott A.L. McCarthy J.S. Nutman T.B. Williams S.A. Carlow C.K. Mol. Biochem.

Parasitol. 1998; 95: 215-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) from O. volvulus. CeCYP-16 is a novel C. elegans cyclophilin and shares 35–56% similarity to the 17 documented cyclophilins in the C. elegans genome. It does not belong to any of the previously characterized groups defined by Page et al. (32.Page A.P. MacNiven K. Hengartner M.O. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). A data base search revealed an absence of mammalian homologs of theOvCYP-16 and CeCYP-16 cyclophilins (Figs. 2 and3). In contrast, homologs of the filarial CYP-1, CYP-2, and CYP-3/4 proteins are present in humans (Figs. 2 and3). There are 13 residues that constitute the CsA-binding site of human cyclophilin A (33.Pflugl G. Kallen J. Schirmer T. Jansonius J.N. Zurini M.G. Walkinshaw M.D. Nature. 1993; 361: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3, #), and one of these residues (tryptophan 121) is essential for drug binding (34.Liu J. Chen C.M. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2306-2310Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In the OvCYP-16 andCeCYP-16 cyclophilins, 9 and 11, respectively, of the 13 residues are conserved. However, unlike any other cyclophilins described to date, the tryptophan residue is substituted with a Glu124 (C. elegans) or Asp123(O. volvulus) amino acid (Fig. 3). The characteristics of recombinant OvCYP-16- andCeCYP-16-MBP fusion proteins were examined using 13 different synthetic peptides of the general structureN-succinyl-Ala-Xaa-cis-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide, where Xaa is any of the 12 amino acids listed in Table I. The tripeptide substrate Suc-Phe-Pro-Phe-pNA was also evaluated. MutantBmCYP-1 (H132D) and the previously characterized filarial cyclophilins BmCYP-1, BmCYP-2, andDiCYP-3 were included for comparison as MBP fusion proteins.BmCYP-1, BmCYP-2, and DiCYP-3 are active PPIases, both as a MBP fusion protein and in a purified (minus MBP) form (19.Page A.P. Landry D. Wilson G.G. Carlow C.K. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11545-11550Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 21.Hong X. Ma D. Carlow C.K.S. Mol. Biochem.

Parasitol. 1996; 79: 235-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The catalytic efficiency (k cat/K m) of the substrates varied, and a distinct profile was obtained for each filarial andC. elegans cyclophilin (Table I). Both OvCYP-16 and CeCYP-16 proteins were found to possess a low level of PPIase activity that was only detectable using relatively large amounts of protein (namely, 9.7 μm OvCYP-16 and 4 μm CeCYP-16, respectively) in the presence of specific substrates (Fig. 4). The highest level of PPIase activity (k cat/K m) forOvCYP-16 and CeCYP-16 was 5.2 × 102 (Ala-Leu-Pro-Phe or Ala-Nle-Pro-Phe) and 2 × 103 (Ala-Val-Pro-Phe), respectively. The profile observed for the mutant PPIase (5 μm BmCYP-1, H132D) was more similar to OvCYP-16 and CeCYP-16 and was dramatically reduced (2.7 × 103 Ala-Leu-Pro-Phe) compared with wild-type (6.9 × 105) (Table I). To determine the sensitivity of OvCYP-16,CeCYP-16, and mutant BmCYP-1 (H132D) PPIases to CsA, recombinant enzyme (10 μm) was preincubated with varying concentrations of CsA (10 nm to 5 μm) at 4 °C for 1 h before the assays were performed as described above. The previously characterized filarial PPIases,BmCYP-1, BmCYP-2, and DiCYP-3, were included for comparison. Appropriate synthetic substrates were used in the assays, namely,N-succinyl-Ala-Leu-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide forOvCYP-16 and CeCYP-16 andN-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide forBmCYP-1, BmCYP-1 (H132D), BmCYP-2, andDiCYP-3, respectively. No inhibition of the PPIase activities of DiCYP-3, OvCYP-16, CeCYP-16, or mutant BmCYP-1 (H132D) was observed, even at CsA concentrations as high as 5 μm (Fig. 5). In contrast, nanomolar concentrations of CsA are sufficient to inhibit 50% of the activities ofBmCYP-1 and BmCYP-2. Transgenic lines IP102 and IP103 were obtained after coinjection of pIP10 and pRF-4 into the gonad of adult worms. Consistent GFP expression patterns were observed in these lines throughout the intestine, with particularly strong fluorescence in the anterior and posterior ends, in all the larval stages and adults (Fig. 6). An exception was found in the dauer stage, where fluorescence was observed in both the cell bodies and processes of the ventral chord motor neurons but was absent from the intestine (Fig. 6). Cyclophilins appear to have undergone proliferation and extensive diversification in filarial worms. In contrast to other parasites that appear to only express homologs of human CypA, the filariae possess, in addition, highly distinctive cyclophilins. The three filarial PPIases (CYP-1, CYP-2, and CYP-3) analyzed in detail thus far differ in size and display unique substrate preferences and a range of sensitivity to inhibition with CsA (21.Hong X.

However, the signaling pathways that modulate the effects of Ras on acquisition of the various features of cardiac hypertrophy are not known. We identified the Ral guanine nucleotide exchange factor-like factor (Rlf) in a yeast two-hybrid screen of human heart cDNA library using Ras as bait, suggesting that Ras signaling in the heart may involve Rlf. We demonstrate here that Rlf is expressed in human heart. Expression of wild type Rlf or Rlf-CAAX, a membrane-targeted mutant of Rlf, transactivated ANF and myosin light chain-2 promoters but did not activate canonical cAMP responsive elements or phorbol ester responsive elements, suggesting that Rlf expression does not lead to a generalized increase in transcription. Transfection of mutant ANF promoter-reporter gene constructs demonstrated that the proximal serum response element is both necessary and sufficient for Rlf-inducible ANF expression. Rlf-induced ANF promoter activation required Ral and Cdc42 but not RhoA, Rac1, ERK, or p38 kinase activation. In addition, Rlf potentiated α1-adrenergic receptor (α1-AR)-induced ANF expression. Prolonged activation of the α1-AR increases RalGTP levels in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes, further emphasizing a role for Ral guanine nucleotide exchange factors in α1-AR signaling. Overall, this study supports the concept that Rlf and Ral are important previously unrecognized signaling components that regulate transcriptional responses in myocardial cells.

In response to hormones and mechanical stretch, ventricular myocytes exhibit a hypertrophic response characterized by induction of cardiac-specific genes (such as atrial natriuretic factor (ANF)1 and myosin light chain (MLC-2)) and increased myocardial cell size (1Chien K.R.

Further studies conducted in NRVM indicate that transcriptional and morphological features of myocardial cell hypertrophy mediated by α1-adrenergic (α1-AR) and M1muscarinic cholinergic receptors require Ras activation (2Thorburn A.

These observations imply an important role for Ras activation in development of cardiac hypertrophy; however, the role of specific Ras signaling pathways in cardiac hypertrophy has not been defined.The best characterized effectors of Ras are serine/threonine kinases of the Raf family. Raf kinases regulate the activity of a kinase cascade that includes mitogen-activated/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) (6Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2243) Google Scholar). The relative importance of the Ras-ERK pathway in cardiac hypertrophy is controversial. Some studies have shown that inhibition of ERK activation blocks α1-AR-induced ANF expression in cultured cells (7Thorburn J. Frost J.A. Thorburn A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1565-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 8Glennon P.E. Kaddoura S. Sale E.M. Sale G.J. Fuller S.J. Sugden P.H. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 954-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Other studies using either transfection of dominant negative forms of Raf and ERK or pharmacological blockade of ERK indicate that Raf and ERK are not required for α1-AR-induced increases in cell size (7Thorburn J. Frost J.A. Thorburn A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1565-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) or ANF expression (9Post G.R. Goldstein D. Thuerauf D.J. Glembotski C.C. Brown J.H. J. Biol.

Furthermore, whereas V12Ras induces myofilament disarray, cardiac fibrosis, and diastolic dysfunction in transgenic mice (3Hunter J.J. Tanaka N. Rockman H.A. Ross Jr., J. Chien K.R. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6341-6350Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). The difference in cardiac phenotype between V12Ras and MEK transgenic mice may reflect the ability of V12Ras to activate additional signaling pathways that lead to impaired cardiac function (13Wang Y. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2001; 1: 134-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).In addition to Raf, Ras directly activates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) and Ral guanine nucleotide exchange factors (RalGEFs), which activate the Ral. Several other putative Ras effectors have been described, including a GTPase-activating protein for Ras (RasGAP) (14Yatani A. Okabe K. Polakis P. Halenbeck R. McCormick F. Brown A.M.

This screen identified the human homologue of a protein previously shown to associate with the GTP-bound form of Ras and its close relative Rap1 (26Peterson S.N. Trabalzini L. Brtva T.R. Fischer T.

The murine homologue, termed Rlf for Ral guanine nucleotide dissociation stimulator (RalGDS)-like factor, is a specific activator of Ral (28Murai H. Ikeda M. Kishida S. Ishida O. Okazaki-Kishida M. Matsuura Y. Kikuchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10483-10490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In addition to interacting in the yeast two-hybrid system, Ras and Rlf interact as recombinant proteins in in vitro binding assays (29Mochizuki N. Murakami T. Sawa H. Post G.R. Makita N. Circulation. 1997; 96: I-556Google Scholar). In fibroblasts Rlf mediates Ras-induced transcriptional activation of the c-fos promoter through a pathway independent of Raf-MEK-ERK (30Wolthuis R.M. de Ruiter N.D. Cool R.H. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6748-6761Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The role of Rlf in cardiac hypertrophy has not been explored.The aim of this study was to investigate the role of Rlf in transcriptional responses in NRVMs. We report that expression of either wild type or a membrane-targeted form of Rlf induces transcriptional activation of genes that are markers of cardiac hypertrophy but do not elicit a global effect on transcription. Rlf-mediated activation of the ANF promoter requires the proximal serum response element (SRE), Ral, and Cdc42 but not Rho, Rac, ERK, or p38 kinase activation. Consistent with a role for Ral guanine nucleotide exchange factors in hypertrophic signaling, Rlf potentiates the transcriptional response to α1-AR activation. In addition Ral is activated following prolonged stimulation of the α1-AR in NRVMs. These findings suggest that Rlf is an important previously unrecognized signaling component in myocardial cell growth responses.DISCUSSIONDespite numerous studies in NRVMs and transgenic mouse models of cardiac hypertrophy, the signaling cascade linking G protein-coupled receptors to activation of Ras and the role of Ras effectors in induction of genetic and morphologic changes characteristic of cardiac hypertrophy remains uncertain. Although α1-AR-induced cardiac gene expression and changes in morphology require Ras activity (2Thorburn A. Thorburn J. Chen S.Y. Powers S. Shubeita H.E. Feramisco J.R. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2244-2249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), earlier studies suggested that activation of the Raf-ERK kinase cascade is not sufficient to induce cardiac gene expression in ventricular myocytes or Ras transgenic mice (9Post G.R.

Hunter J.J. Chien K.R. Brown J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14057-14061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that activation of additional Ras effectors is necessary for the characteristic changes in gene expression that occur in response to hypertrophic agonists or Ras. In agreement Fuller et al.(19Fuller S.J. Finn S.G. Downward J. Sugden P.H. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) demonstrated that effector domain mutants of Ras that preferentially activate Raf and RalGEFs but not PI 3-kinase induce genes associated with the hypertrophic response in NRVMs (19Fuller S.J. Finn S.G. Downward J. Sugden P.H. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), suggesting that RalGEF family members and their signaling pathways are important regulators of Ras-induced cardiac hypertrophy.To identify potentially novel effector molecules of Ras in the heart, we screened a human heart cDNA library by the yeast two-hybrid system using Ras, and we identified the human homologue of Rlf as a Ras-interacting protein in vitro (27Wolthuis R.M. Bauer B. van't Veer L.J. de Vries-Smits A.M. Cool R.H. Spaargaren M. Wittinghofer A. Burgering B.M. Bos J.L. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 353-362PubMed Google Scholar, 29Mochizuki N. Murakami T. Sawa H. Post G.R. Makita N. Circulation. 1997; 96: I-556Google Scholar). Rlf is a member of the family of Ras-binding proteins that function as RalGEFs (27Wolthuis R.M. Bauer B. van't Veer L.J. de Vries-Smits A.M. Cool R.H. Spaargaren M. Wittinghofer A. Burgering B.M. Bos J.L. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 353-362PubMed Google Scholar). Other members of this family include RalGDS (42Hofer F. Fields S. Schneider C. Martin G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11089-11093Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), Rgl (43Kikuchi A. Ye S.D. Demo Z.H. Chen Y.W. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell.

Oncogene. 2001; 20: 188-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The biological role of RalGEFs in gene expression and cell growth is just beginning to be elucidated. When transfected into fibroblasts, Rlf mediates Ras-induced c-fos gene induction through a signaling pathway distinct from the Raf-MEK-ERK pathway (27Wolthuis R.M. Bauer B. van't Veer L.J. de Vries-Smits A.M. Cool R.H. Spaargaren M. Wittinghofer A. Burgering B.M. Bos J.L. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 353-362PubMed Google Scholar, 30Wolthuis R.M. de Ruiter N.D. Cool R.H. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6748-6761Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Similarly, expression of RalGDS complements the activities of Raf and PI 3-kinase on cell growth and transformation in NIH3T3 fibroblasts (46White M.A. Vale T. Camonis J.H. Schaefer E. Wigler M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16439-16442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). However, in PC12 cells expression of RalGDS opposes the action of Raf and PI 3-kinase and inhibits neurite outgrowth (47Gob T. Rusanescu G. Urano T. Feig L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1731-1741Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Expression of RalGDS also inhibits expression of muscle-specific reporter genes and differentiation of C3H10T1/2 mouse fibroblasts to skeletal muscle (48Ramocki M.B. White M.A. Konieczny S.F. Taparowsky E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17696-17701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We show that Rlf is expressed in the heart (Fig. 1), induces the expression of genes associated with cardiac hypertrophy (Fig. 2), and potentiates the transcriptional response to PE (Fig. 7). Therefore, Rlf may play a role in regulating hypertrophic growth signals in terminally differentiated cardiac myocytes.Induction of ANF is one of the most conserved features of the hypertrophic response. The promoter of the ANF gene contains several regulatory sequence elements that bind a variety of transcription factors. Using a series of truncated and chimeric ANF promoter-reporter gene constructs, we found that Rlf does not transactivate promoters containing canonical CREs and TREs. Furthermore, deletion of these regulatory motifs in the ANF promoter does not affect Rlf-mediated transcriptional activity. In contrast, the proximal SRE is both necessary and sufficient for Rlf-mediated transactivation of the ANF promoter (Fig. 3). This region of the promoter is a target for multiple intracellular signaling pathways in myocardial cells, including p38 kinase (34Thuerauf D.J. Arnold N.D. Zechner D. Hanford D.S. DeMartin K.M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 24046-24053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), RhoA, and the protein kinase C (PKC)-related kinase PKN (52Morissette M.R. Sah V.P. Glembotski C.C. Brown J.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: H1769-H1774Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We found that Rlf-induced transcriptional activation of the ANF promoter requires Ral and Cdc42 but not Rho, Rac, ERK, or p38 kinase activation. An earlier study using transfection of dominant inhibitory and activated RhoA and Ras suggests that RhoA transactivates the ANF promoter through a pathway that is parallel and complementary to Ras (53Sah V.P. Hoshijima M. Chien K.R. Brown J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31185-31190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The interrelationship between Ras, Ral, Rac, and Cdc42 with respect to hypertrophic growth responses in myocardial cells has not been established. However, our data are consistent with a model that places Rlf on a pathway parallel to both RhoA and Rac.An important function of Rho-related G proteins is control of actin polymerization and the assembly of integrin complexes. In addition to its impact on cellular morphology and movement, actin polymerization and/or stabilization induce the expression of SRE target genes (54Sotiropoulos A. Gineitis D. Copeland J. Treisman R. Cell. 1999; 98: 159-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). A recent study has shown that RhoA-mediated organization of the actin cytoskeleton facilitates hypertrophic gene induction (55Wei L. Wang L. Carson J.A. Agan J.E. Imanaka-Yoshida K. Schwartz R.J. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 785-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Like the Rho family of G proteins, Ral has been linked to changes in cellular morphology. For example, expression of a dominant-interfering mutant of Ral blocks developmental shape changes in Drosophila melanogaster (56Sawamoto K. Yamada C. Kishida S. Hirota Y. Taguchi A. Kikuchi A. Okano H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1967-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) whereas activated Ral induces filopodial outgrowth in fibroblasts (57Ohta Y. Suzuki N. Nakamura S. Hartwig J.H. Stossel T.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2122-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). A link between Rlf and the actin cytoskeleton is formed through Ral and an effector protein of Ral, Ral-binding protein 1 (RalBP1). RalBP1 binds to Cdc42 and Rac through a GTPase domain (58Feig L.A. Urano T. Cantor S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 438-441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Together Rlf signaling to the SRE may involve Ral and/or Cdc42-induced regulation of actin polymerization, an area of investigation that we are actively pursuing.The regulation of RalGEF activity is just beginning to be elucidated. Several G protein-coupled receptors and receptor tyrosine kinases induce rapid and transient activation of Ral (37Wolthuis R.M. Franke B. van Triest M. Bauer B. Cool R.H. Camonis J.H. Akkerman J.W. Bos J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2486-2491Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 59Hofer F. Berdeaux R. Martin G.S. Curr.

Biol. 1998; 8: 471-474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Studies have demonstrated that insulin and EGF-induced Ral activation in fibroblasts is blocked by dominant negative Ras, providing evidence that the RalGEF-Ral pathway is downstream of Ras (60Wolthuis R.M. Zwartkruis F. Moen T.C. Bos J.L. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 471-474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Ral can also be activated through Ras-independent pathways involving calcium (37Wolthuis R.M. Franke B. van Triest M. Bauer B. Cool R.H. Camonis J.H. Akkerman J.W. Bos J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2486-2491Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 59Hofer F. Berdeaux R. Martin G.S. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 839-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the activity of RalGDS can be negatively regulated by phorbol esters (61Rusanescu G. Gotoh T. Tian X. Feig L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2650-2658Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We show here for the first time that α1-ARs are coupled to signaling pathways that increase the levels of GTP-bound Ral. Although serum-induced Ral activation peaks at 5 min, PE-induced Ral activation occurs only following prolonged PE exposure (24 h). This contrasts with the kinetics of PE-induced ERK activation, which peaks at 5–20 min, returns to basal levels at 1 h, and remains low for 24 h (9Post G.R. Goldstein D. Thuerauf D.J. Glembotski C.C. Brown J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8452-8457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In a similar fashion, nerve growth factor-induced PKC activation enhanced ERK signaling and prevented Ras-mediated activation of RalGEF (61Rusanescu G. Gotoh T. Tian X. Feig L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2650-2658Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Whether PKC mediates α1-AR-induced activation of ERK and/or Ral in NRVMs is not known. However, our findings are consistent with a model whereby prolonged exposure to PE (24 h) down-regulates a pathway that inhibits RalGEF activation (such as PKC or RalGAP) or up-regulates an activator of Ral (possibly Rlf). In support of the latter mechanism, we found that Rlf overexpression enhances PE-induced ANF promoter activity (Fig. 7). The significance of Rlf expression and delayed Ral activation on myocardial cell hypertrophy is currently under investigation.In summary, we identified the human homologue of Rlf as a Ras-interacting protein in the heart using the yeast two-hybrid system and demonstrated its expression in human heart. Expression of wild type and membrane-targeted Rlf is sufficient to activate the promoters of genes that are markers of cardiac hypertrophy but does not lead to generalized increases in gene expression in myocardial cells. Our studies show that Rlf-mediated transcriptional regulation of the ANF promoter requires Ral, Cdc42, and the proximal SRE but not ERK, p38 kinase, Rac1, or RhoA. Co-expression of Rlf and treatment of myocardial cells with PE enhances ANF promoter activity. We also show that PE increases RalGTP levels, further emphasizing a role for Rlf and Ral in α1-AR signal transduction. Overall, these findings also suggest that Rlf and Ral signaling may be an important determinant in the development of myocardial hypertrophy. In response to hormones and mechanical stretch, ventricular myocytes exhibit a hypertrophic response characterized by induction of cardiac-specific genes (such as atrial natriuretic factor (ANF)1 and myosin light chain (MLC-2)) and increased myocardial cell size (1Chien K.R. Knowlton K.U. Zhu H. Chien S. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3037-3046Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). Expression of activated Ras (V12Ras) induces cellular hypertrophy and ANF expression in cultured neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs) (2Thorburn A. Thorburn J. Chen S.Y. Powers S. Shubeita H.E. Feramisco J.R. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2244-2249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cardiac-targeted (MLC-2v-driven) expression of V12Ras induces cardiac hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction in transgenic mice (3Hunter J.J. Tanaka N. Rockman H.A. Ross Jr., J. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23173-23178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Further studies conducted in NRVM indicate that transcriptional and morphological features of myocardial cell hypertrophy mediated by α1-adrenergic (α1-AR) and M1muscarinic cholinergic receptors require Ras activation (2Thorburn A.

Life Sci. 1997; 60: 1077-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). These observations imply an important role for Ras activation in development of cardiac hypertrophy; however, the role of specific Ras signaling pathways in cardiac hypertrophy has not been defined. The best characterized effectors of Ras are serine/threonine kinases of the Raf family. Raf kinases regulate the activity of a kinase cascade that includes mitogen-activated/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) (6Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2243) Google Scholar). The relative importance of the Ras-ERK pathway in cardiac hypertrophy is controversial. Some studies have shown that inhibition of ERK activation blocks α1-AR-induced ANF expression in cultured cells (7Thorburn J. Frost J.A. Th"
