https://openalex.org/W2803499747,"Organoids derived from human pluripotent stem cells are a potentially powerful tool for high-throughput screening (HTS), but the complexity of organoid cultures poses a significant challenge for miniaturization and automation. Here, we present a fully automated, HTS-compatible platform for enhanced differentiation and phenotyping of human kidney organoids. The entire 21-day protocol, from plating to differentiation to analysis, can be performed automatically by liquid-handling robots, or alternatively by manual pipetting. High-content imaging analysis reveals both dose-dependent and threshold effects during organoid differentiation. Immunofluorescence and single-cell RNA sequencing identify previously undetected parietal, interstitial, and partially differentiated compartments within organoids and define conditions that greatly expand the vascular endothelium. Chemical modulation of toxicity and disease phenotypes can be quantified for safety and efficacy prediction. Screening in gene-edited organoids in this system reveals an unexpected role for myosin in polycystic kidney disease. Organoids in HTS formats thus establish an attractive platform for multidimensional phenotypic screening."
https://openalex.org/W2804636914,"Many naturalistic behaviors are built from modular components that are expressed sequentially. Although striatal circuits have been implicated in action selection and implementation, the neural mechanisms that compose behavior in unrestrained animals are not well understood. Here, we record bulk and cellular neural activity in the direct and indirect pathways of dorsolateral striatum (DLS) as mice spontaneously express action sequences. These experiments reveal that DLS neurons systematically encode information about the identity and ordering of sub-second 3D behavioral motifs; this encoding is facilitated by fast-timescale decorrelations between the direct and indirect pathways. Furthermore, lesioning the DLS prevents appropriate sequence assembly during exploratory or odor-evoked behaviors. By characterizing naturalistic behavior at neural timescales, these experiments identify a code for elemental 3D pose dynamics built from complementary pathway dynamics, support a role for DLS in constructing meaningful behavioral sequences, and suggest models for how actions are sculpted over time."
https://openalex.org/W2804562206,"Chronic social isolation causes severe psychological effects in humans, but their neural bases remain poorly understood. 2 weeks (but not 24 hr) of social isolation stress (SIS) caused multiple behavioral changes in mice and induced brain-wide upregulation of the neuropeptide tachykinin 2 (Tac2)/neurokinin B (NkB). Systemic administration of an Nk3R antagonist prevented virtually all of the behavioral effects of chronic SIS. Conversely, enhancing NkB expression and release phenocopied SIS in group-housed mice, promoting aggression and converting stimulus-locked defensive behaviors to persistent responses. Multiplexed analysis of Tac2/NkB function in multiple brain areas revealed dissociable, region-specific requirements for both the peptide and its receptor in different SIS-induced behavioral changes. Thus, Tac2 coordinates a pleiotropic brain state caused by SIS via a distributed mode of action. These data reveal the profound effects of prolonged social isolation on brain chemistry and function and suggest potential new therapeutic applications for Nk3R antagonists."
https://openalex.org/W2803596769,"When 3D electron microscopy and calcium imaging are used to investigate the structure and function of neural circuits, the resulting datasets pose new challenges of visualization and interpretation. Here, we present a new kind of digital resource that encompasses almost 400 ganglion cells from a single patch of mouse retina. An online ""museum"" provides a 3D interactive view of each cell's anatomy, as well as graphs of its visual responses. The resource reveals two aspects of the retina's inner plexiform layer: an arbor segregation principle governing structure along the light axis and a density conservation principle governing structure in the tangential plane. Structure is related to visual function; ganglion cells with arbors near the layer of ganglion cell somas are more sustained in their visual responses on average. Our methods are potentially applicable to dense maps of neuronal anatomy and physiology in other parts of the nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2805030993,"Degrons are minimal elements that mediate the interaction of proteins with degradation machineries to promote proteolysis. Despite their central role in proteostasis, the number of known degrons remains small, and a facile technology to characterize them is lacking. Using a strategy combining global protein stability (GPS) profiling with a synthetic human peptidome, we identify thousands of peptides containing degron activity. Employing CRISPR screening, we establish that the stability of many proteins is regulated through degrons located at their C terminus. We characterize eight Cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase (CRL) complex adaptors that regulate C-terminal degrons, including six CRL2 and two CRL4 complexes, and computationally implicate multiple non-CRLs in end recognition. Proteome analysis revealed that the C termini of eukaryotic proteins are depleted for C-terminal degrons, suggesting an E3-ligase-dependent modulation of proteome composition. Thus, we propose that a series of ""C-end rules"" operate to govern protein stability and shape the eukaryotic proteome."

D-serine is a necessary co-agonist of synaptic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), but the physiological factors regulating its impact on memory processes are scantly known. We show that astroglial CB1 receptors are key determinants of object recognition memory by determining the availability of D-serine at hippocampal synapses. Mutant mice lacking CB1 receptors from astroglial cells (GFAP-CB1-KO) displayed impaired object recognition memory and decreased in vivo and in vitro long-term potentiation (LTP) at CA3-CA1 hippocampal synapses. Activation of CB1 receptors increased intracellular astroglial Ca2+ levels and extracellular levels of D-serine in hippocampal slices. Accordingly, GFAP-CB1-KO displayed lower occupancy of the co-agonist binding site of synaptic hippocampal NMDARs. Finally, elevation of D-serine levels fully rescued LTP and memory impairments of GFAP-CB1-KO mice.

The endocannabinoid system is an important modulator of physiological functions. It is composed of cannabinoid receptors, their endogenous ligands (i.e., endocannabinoids, eCB), and the enzymatic machinery responsible for their synthesis and degradation (Busquets-Garcia et al., 2018Busquets-Garcia A.

The molecular logic of endocannabinoid signalling.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 873-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (1613) Google Scholar). The presence of type-1 cannabinoid receptors (CB1) and the activity-dependent mobilization of endocannabinoids in different brain regions, including the hippocampus, are particularly involved in the modulation of several types of memory and associated cellular processes (Kano et al., 2009Kano M.

Moreover, brain CB1 receptors are expressed in different neuronal types, including inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic and excitatory glutamatergic neurons, where their stimulation negatively regulates the release of neurotransmitters (Kano et al., 2009Kano M.

CB1 receptors are also expressed in glial cells, particularly astrocytes (Andrade-Talavera et al., 2016Andrade-Talavera Y. Duque-Feria P. Paulsen O. Rodríguez-Moreno A.

For more than a century, astrocytes were thought to play an important supportive and nutritive role for neurons without actively participating in brain information processing (Allaman et al., 2011Allaman I.

However, it is now known that peri-synaptic astroglial processes surrounding pre- and postsynaptic neuronal elements form the so-called “tripartite synapse,” where astrocytes actively contribute to information processing (Araque et al., 2014Araque A.

In vivo and in vitro studies showed that astroglial CB1 receptor signaling indirectly modulates glutamatergic transmission onto hippocampal pyramidal neurons (Han et al., 2012Han J. Kesner P.

For instance, the disruptive effect of exogenous cannabinoids on short-term spatial working memory is mediated by astroglial CB1 receptors through an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-dependent mechanism in the hippocampus (Han et al., 2012Han J.

Yet, the role of astroglial CB1 receptors in physiological long-term memory processes and the precise mechanisms involved are still unknown (Metna-Laurent and Marsicano, 2015Metna-Laurent M.

D-serine is the co-agonist of synaptic NMDARs and its action is required to induce different forms of synaptic plasticity (Henneberger et al., 2010Henneberger C. Papouin T. Oliet S.H. Rusakov D.A.

However, whether astroglial CB1 receptors control the synaptic availability of D-serine during memory processing is not known. Using genetic, behavioral, electrophysiological, imaging, and biochemical experimental approaches, in this study we asked whether the physiological activity of astroglial CB1 receptors is involved in long-term object recognition memory and whether the mechanisms involved imply the regulation of glial-neuronal interactions. The results show that physiological activation of astroglial CB1 receptors in the hippocampus is necessary for long-term object recognition memory consolidation via a mechanism involving the supply of D-serine to synaptic NMDARs and, consequently, the regulation of hippocampal synaptic plasticity. Thus, astroglial CB1 receptors contribute to the time- and space-specific synaptic actions of astrocytes to promote memory formation. To study the physiological role of astroglial CB1 receptors in memory, we tested conditional mutant mice lacking CB1 receptors in glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive cells (GFAP-CB1-KO mice) (Han et al., 2012Han J.

GFAP-CB1-KO mice displayed a significant memory deficit as compared to their control littermates (Figure 1A; see also Figure S1A), with no alteration in total object exploration time (Figure S1B). Hippocampal NMDAR-dependent transmission is involved in many forms of memory (Kandel et al., 2002Kandel E.R. Schwartz J.H. Jessel T.M. Siegelbaum S.A. Hudspeth A.J.

Investigations into the involvement of NMDA mechanisms in recognition memory.Neuropharmacology. 2013; 74: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), yet the involvement of hippocampal NMDARs on NOR memory is still under debate, as it seems to depend on specific experimental conditions (Balderas et al., 2015Balderas I. Rodriguez-Ortiz C.J. Bermudez-Rattoni F. Consolidation and reconsolidation of object recognition memory.Behav. Brain Res. 2015; 285: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, Warburton and Brown, 2015Warburton E.C. Brown M.W. Neural circuitry for rat recognition memory.Behav. Brain Res. 2015; 285: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). To clarify this issue, we set to investigate where these receptors are required for NOR memory formation in our behavioral paradigm. Intra-hippocampal administration of the NMDARs antagonist D-AP5 (15 μg/side; Figure S1C) fully abolished memory performance in wild-type (WT) mice when injected immediately after acquisition (Figure 1B; see also Figure S1D), but not 6 hr later (Figures S1F–S1H), with no alteration in total exploration time (Figure S1E). Thus, consolidation of long-term object recognition memory in the NOR task specifically requires astroglial CB1 receptors and hippocampal NMDARs signaling. Activity-dependent plastic changes of synaptic strength, such as NMDAR-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP), are considered cellular correlates of memory formation (Kandel et al., 2002Kandel E.R. Schwartz J.H. Jessel T.M. Siegelbaum S.A. Hudspeth A.J. Principles of Neural Science.Fifth Edition. McGraw-Hill Professional, 2002Google Scholar, Whitlock et al., 2006Whitlock J.R. Heynen A.J. Shuler M.G. Bear M.F. Learning induces long-term potentiation in the hippocampus.Science. 2006; 313: 1093-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (1437) Google Scholar). To study astroglial CB1 receptor involvement in LTP, we recorded in vivo evoked field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) in the hippocampal CA3-CA1 pathway of anesthetized WT and mutant mice. High-frequency stimulation (HFS) induced LTP in C57BL/6N mice (Figures 1C and 1D). The systemic administration of the NMDAR antagonist MK-801 (3 mg/kg, i.p.), which did not alter basal evoked fEPSPs (Figures S1I–S1K), fully blocked the induction of LTP (Figures 1C and 1D; Figures S1I–S1K), confirming its NMDAR dependency. Notably, this form of plasticity was abolished in GFAP-CB1-KO mice as compared to their WT littermates (Figures 1E and 1F), showing that CB1 receptors expressed in GFAP-positive cells are necessary for in vivo hippocampal NMDAR-dependent LTP induction. Altogether, these data demonstrate that astroglial CB1 receptors are essential for hippocampal NMDAR-dependent object recognition memory and LTP. Increase of astroglial intracellular Ca2+ modulates synaptic glutamatergic activity and plasticity via the release of gliotransmitters, whose identity likely depend on the brain region and the type of plasticity involved (Araque et al., 2014Araque A.

Local pressure application of the CB1 receptor agonist WIN55,212-2 (WIN) induced a reliable increase of Ca2+ levels in somas and principal processes of hippocampal astrocytes in slices from GFAP-CB1-WT mice (Figures 2A–2E).

Notably, WIN had no effect in slices from GFAP-CB1-KO littermates (Figures 2B–2E), clearly indicating the direct impact of astroglial CB1 receptor activation on intracellular Ca2+ levels. Via Ca2+-dependent mechanisms, astrocytes can promote the synaptic release of several signaling molecules known as gliotransmitters (Araque et al., 2014Araque A. Carmignoto G. Haydon P.G. Oliet S.H. Robitaille R. Volterra A. Gliotransmitters travel in time and space.Neuron. 2014; 81: 728-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). One of them is D-serine, which plays a key role in NMDAR signaling (Araque et al., 2014Araque A. Carmignoto G. Haydon P.G. Oliet S.H. Robitaille R. Volterra A. Gliotransmitters travel in time and space.Neuron. 2014; 81: 728-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). Therefore, we asked whether activation of CB1 receptors might modulate the release of this amino acid. Application of WIN (5 μM) to hippocampal slices did not alter the tissue levels of several amino acids (Figures S2A–S2D). However, the same treatment slightly but specifically increased the extracellular levels of D-serine (Figures 2F–2I), indicating that activation of astroglial CB1 receptors can control the release of this signaling amino acid, a process that depends on intracellular Ca2+ signaling (Bohmbach et al., 2018Bohmbach K. Schwarz M.K. Schoch S. Henneberger C. The structural and functional evidence for vesicular release from astrocytes in situ.Brain Res. Bull. 2018; 136: 65-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, Henneberger et al., 2010Henneberger C. Papouin T. Oliet S.H. Rusakov D.A. Long-term potentiation depends on release of D-serine from astrocytes.Nature. 2010; 463: 232-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar). D-serine is the co-agonist of hippocampal synaptic NMDARs and its presence is necessary for LTP induction (Bohmbach et al., 2018Bohmbach K. Schwarz M.K. Schoch S. Henneberger C. The structural and functional evidence for vesicular release from astrocytes in situ.Brain Res. Bull. 2018; 136: 65-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, Henneberger et al., 2010Henneberger C. Papouin T. Oliet S.H. Rusakov D.A.

Synaptic and extrasynaptic NMDA receptors are gated by different endogenous coagonists.Cell. 2012; 150: 633-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Thus, astroglial CB1 receptors might control the activity of NMDARs and hippocampal LTP by regulating the synaptic levels of D-serine. Measurements of bulk extracellular amino acids as performed in Figures 2F–2I do not specifically address whether D-serine levels impact synaptic function. A direct way to evaluate the levels and functions of synaptic D-serine is to perform electrophysiological measurements to assess the occupancy of the NMDAR co-agonist binding site at CA3-CA1 synapses (Papouin et al., 2012Papouin T. Ladépêche L. Ruel J. Sacchi S. Labasque M. Hanini M. Groc L. Pollegioni L. Mothet J.P. Oliet S.H. Synaptic and extrasynaptic NMDA receptors are gated by different endogenous coagonists.Cell. 2012; 150: 633-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Thus, we measured the impact of exogenous applications of the D-serine on NMDAR-mediated fEPSPs at CA3-CA1 synapses in acute hippocampal slices (Papouin et al., 2012Papouin T. Ladépêche L. Ruel J. Sacchi S. Labasque M. Hanini M. Groc L. Pollegioni L. Mothet J.P. Oliet S.H. Synaptic and extrasynaptic NMDA receptors are gated by different endogenous coagonists.Cell. 2012; 150: 633-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Bath application of D-serine (50 μM) increased NMDAR-dependent synaptic responses in both GFAP-CB1-WT and GFAP-CB1-KO mice (Figures 3A and 3B ). Strikingly, the effect of D-serine was twice more pronounced in the absence of astroglial CB1 receptors (Figures 3A and 3B), indicating that these receptors are necessary to maintain appropriate concentrations of D-serine within the synaptic cleft and consequently ensuring a proper level of occupancy of the NMDAR co-agonist binding site. Next, we asked whether astroglial CB1 receptor-dependent release of D-serine controls synaptic plasticity by regulating NMDAR activity. First, in vitro electrophysiological recordings of fEPSPs at CA3-CA1 synapses in hippocampal slices revealed that GFAP-CB1-WT and GFAP-CB1-KO have comparable input-output relationships (Figure S3A), indicating that the deletion of astroglial CB1 receptors did not alter basal glutamatergic synaptic transmission. HFS is known to induce endocannabinoid mobilization through the activation of mGluR1/5 receptors, eventually leading to long-term depression of inhibitory transmission (I-LTD) in the hippocampus (Castillo et al., 2012Castillo P.E.

Endocannabinoid signaling and synaptic function.Neuron. 2012; 76: 70-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar, Chevaleyre and Castillo, 2003Chevaleyre V. Castillo P.E. Heterosynaptic LTD of hippocampal GABAergic synapses: a novel role of endocannabinoids in regulating excitability.Neuron. 2003; 38: 461-472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). Therefore, we asked whether mGluR1/5 receptors could be involved in HFS-induced LTP. Application of the mGluR1/5 antagonists LY367385 and MTEP, respectively, did not alter LTP (Figures S3B and S3C), suggesting that mGluR1/5 receptors are not involved in this process. Similarly to in vivo electrophysiological results, HFS-induced LTP was significantly reduced in GFAP-CB1-KO mice as compared to GFAP-CB1-WT (Figure 3C). Whereas the exogenous application of D-serine (50 μM) had no effect in slices from GFAP-CB1-WT mice, it fully rescued in vitro LTP in GFAP-CB1-KO littermates (Figures 3D and 3E). Importantly, the lack of in vivo LTP observed in GFAP-CB1-KO was fully restored by the systemic administration of D-serine (50 mg/kg, i.p.; Figures 3F–3H). Considering that activation of astroglial CB1 receptors increases Ca2+ in astrocytes, we asked whether this subpopulation of cannabinoid receptors is involved in the HFS-induced regulation of astroglial Ca2+ dynamics (Perea and Araque, 2005Perea G.

The discovery that many cells die during embryogenesis in a programmed manner was astounding when first noted and led to a large number of studies examining this phenomenon (reviewed in Glucksmann, 1951Glucksmann A. Cell deaths in normal vertebrate ontogeny.Biol. Rev. Camb. Philos. Soc. 1951; 26: 59-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar, Jacobson et al., 1997Jacobson M.D. Weil M. Raff M.C.

Cell death in development.Cell. 1999; 96: 245-254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar). The morphological changes distinguishing developmentally programmed cell death from accidental forms of cell death were described, and the term apoptosis was coined (Kerr et al., 1972Kerr J.F. Wyllie A.H. Currie A.R. Apoptosis: a basic biological phenomenon with wide-ranging implications in tissue kinetics.Br. J. Cancer. 1972; 26: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (12826) Google Scholar). Many molecular determinants of apoptosis were first identified through genetic screens in C. elegans (reviewed in Ellis et al., 1991Ellis R.E. Yuan J.Y. Horvitz H.R. Mechanisms and functions of cell death.Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 663-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (1945) Google Scholar), and early reports hypothesized several important roles for developmental apoptosis, including (1) tissue sculpting, (2) deleting unneeded structures, (3) controlling cell numbers, (4) eliminating abnormal cells, and (5) producing differentiated cells without organelles (Jacobson et al., 1997Jacobson M.D. Weil M. Raff M.C. Programmed cell death in animal development.Cell. 1997; 88: 347-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2403) Google Scholar). Specifically, apoptosis was proposed to be important for elimination of redundant cells in the inner cell masses of blastocysts (Pierce et al., 1989Pierce G.B. Lewellyn A.L. Parchment R.E. Mechanism of programmed cell death in the blastocyst.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1989; 86: 3654-3658Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), shaping of the epiblast (Poelmann, 1980Poelmann R.E.

Morphol. 1980; 55: 33-51PubMed Google Scholar), pro-amniotic cavity formation (Coucouvanis and Martin, 1995Coucouvanis E. Martin G.R. Signals for death and survival: a two-step mechanism for cavitation in the vertebrate embryo.Cell. 1995; 83: 279-287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar), vesicle (e.g., lens) or tube (e.g., neural tube, intestine) formation by invagination and detachment from epithelial sheets, fusion of epithelial sheets (e.g., midline body wall and palate fusion) (Glucksmann, 1951Glucksmann A. Cell deaths in normal vertebrate ontogeny.Biol. Rev. Camb. Philos. Soc. 1951; 26: 59-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar), and digit separation by removing interdigital tissue (Jacobsen et al., 1996Jacobsen M.D. Weil M. Raff M.C. Role of Ced-3/ICE-family proteases in staurosporine-induced programmed cell death.J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1041-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Apoptosis was also proposed as the basic mechanism underlying the shaping of epithelia (Monier et al., 2015Monier B. Gettings M. Gay G. Mangeat T. Schott S. Guarner A. Suzanne M. Apico-basal forces exerted by apoptotic cells drive epithelium folding.Nature. 2015; 518: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), removal of vestigial tissues (e.g., pro-nephros and parts of meso- and meta-nephros and notochord), and the Müllerian duct in males and Wollfian duct in females (Glucksmann, 1951Glucksmann A. Cell deaths in normal vertebrate ontogeny.Biol. Rev. Camb. Philos. Soc. 1951; 26: 59-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). Two distinct but ultimately converging apoptotic pathways that culminate in caspase activation have been identified, namely the death receptor (also called extrinsic) and the intrinsic (also called BCL-2 regulated, mitochondrial, or stress-induced) pathways of apoptosis (Czabotar et al., 2014Czabotar P.E. Lessene G. Strasser A. Adams J.M. Control of apoptosis by the BCL-2 protein family: implications for physiology and therapy.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2014; 15: 49-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (2141) Google Scholar, Green and Kroemer, 2004Green D.R. Kroemer G. The pathophysiology of mitochondrial cell death.Science. 2004; 305: 626-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (2811) Google Scholar). The former is triggered by the ligation of death receptors, which are members of the TNFR family with an intra-cellular death domain (e.g., FAS, TNFR1). The latter is induced by developmental cues, growth factor withdrawal, and diverse cytotoxic insults. Intrinsic apoptosis is regulated by the BCL-2 family of proteins, which exhibit pro-survival (e.g., BCL-2, BCL-XL, MCL-1) or pro-apoptotic functions (Czabotar et al., 2014Czabotar P.E. Lessene G. Strasser A. Adams J.M. Control of apoptosis by the BCL-2 protein family: implications for physiology and therapy.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2014; 15: 49-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (2141) Google Scholar). The pro-apoptotic members are further divided into two sub-groups based on their number of BCL-2 homology (BH) domains: the multi-BH domain-containing proteins (BAX, BAK, BOK) and the BH3-only proteins (e.g., BIM, PUMA, BID, BAD). In response to cytotoxic stimuli, different BH3-only proteins are induced transcriptionally or post-transcriptionally. They then bind to the pro-survival BCL-2 proteins, thereby unleashing BAX/BAK, but some can also activate BAX/BAK directly (Czabotar et al., 2014Czabotar P.E. Lessene G. Strasser A. Adams J.M.

The pathophysiology of mitochondrial cell death.Science. 2004; 305: 626-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (2811) Google Scholar). The absence of BAK or BAX (Knudson et al., 1995Knudson C.M. Tung K.S.K. Tourtellotte W.G. Brown G.A.J. Korsmeyer S.J. Bax-deficient mice with lymphoid hyperplasia and male germ cell death.Science. 1995; 270: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1308) Google Scholar) alone caused mild anomalies, but compound deletion of both proteins had profound consequences on murine development and cell survival (Lindsten et al., 2000Lindsten T. Ross A.J. King A. Zong W.X. Rathmell J.C. Shiels H.A. Ulrich E. Waymire K.G. Mahar P. Frauwirth K. et al.The combined functions of proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members bak and bax are essential for normal development of multiple tissues.Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1389-1399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1191) Google Scholar). Less than 10% of Bax−/−Bak−/−-deficient mice survived to weaning, and these animals displayed several abnormalities such as interdigital webbing, an imperforate vaginal canal in females, excess cells in the brain, and dramatic splenomegaly (Lindsten et al., 2000Lindsten T. Ross A.J. King A. Zong W.X. Rathmell J.C. Shiels H.A. Ulrich E. Waymire K.G. Mahar P.

Cell. 2000; 6: 1389-1399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1191) Google Scholar), but the reason for their perinatal lethality is still unclear. These studies indicate that (1) BAX and BAK are functionally highly redundant, (2) that the intrinsic apoptotic pathway is critical for embryonic development, and surprisingly, (3) based on the attainment of a few DKO survivors, that the combined loss of BAX and BAK is insufficient to abrogate all developmental cell death processes. This implied that other pro-apoptotic members of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, or perhaps separate cell death pathways, may play roles in embryonic development. BOK is a ubiquitously expressed, highly conserved protein that shows extensive amino acid sequence homology to BAX and BAK (73% or 87%, respectively), but its physiological function remains unclear (Hsu and Hsueh, 1998Hsu S.Y. Hsueh A.J.W. A splicing variant of the Bcl-2 member Bok with a truncated BH3 domain induces apoptosis but does not dimerize with antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins in vitro.J. Biol.

Not surprisingly, BOK has been hypothesized to exert a BAX/BAK-like pro-death function. This is supported by in vitro experiment using inducible expression or transient transfection systems in various cell lines (Ha et al., 2001Ha S.H. Lee S.R. Lee T.H. Kim Y.M. Baik M.G. Choi Y.J.

Intracellular localization of the BCL-2 family member BOK and functional implications.Cell Death Differ. 2013; 20: 785-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), while another investigation reported that BOK is regulated differently to BAX and BAK; i.e., it does not require activation by BH3-only proteins and does not appear to be kept in check by pro-survival BCL-2 family members (Llambi et al., 2016Llambi F. Wang Y.M. Victor B. Yang M. Schneider D.M. Gingras S. Parsons M.J. Zheng J.H. Brown S.A.

However, Bok−/− mice are normal in appearance and produced at the expected Mendelian frequency (Ke et al., 2012Ke F. Voss A. Kerr J.B. O’Reilly L.A. Tai L. Echeverry N. Bouillet P. Strasser A. Kaufmann T. BCL-2 family member BOK is widely expressed but its loss has only minimal impact in mice.Cell Death Differ. 2012; 19: 915-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and even Bok−/−Bax−/− and Bok−/−Bak−/− compound mutant mice are largely normal (Ke et al., 2013Ke F. Bouillet P. Kaufmann T. Strasser A. Kerr J. Voss A.K. Consequences of the combined loss of BOK and BAK or BOK and BAX.Cell Death Dis. 2013; 4: e650Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Based on these findings, we hypothesized that BOK may have overlapping functions with both BAX and BAK, including during embryonic development. We report here that Bok−/−Bax−/−Bak−/− triple-knockout (from hereon referred to as TKO) mice exhibit more severe developmental defects and die earlier than Bax−/−Bak−/− double-knockout (from hereon referred to as DKO) mice, demonstrating that BOK has overlapping roles with BAX and BAK during embryogenesis. We show that TKO mice lack developmental apoptosis and that other forms of cell death such as necroptosis, pyroptosis, or autophagy did not substitute for the lack of this process. We defined the areas of mammalian development that genuinely require apoptosis, including midline body wall and palate fusion, fusion of the lower parts of the bilateral Müllerian ducts, as well as in the removal of interdigital webs. Surprisingly, many organs of TKO fetuses developed normally in the absence of apoptosis, and in exceptional cases, these animals even reached adulthood. In contrast to what current perceptions dictate, apoptosis was not essential in early mouse development (inner cell mass, epiblast, and pro-amniotic cavity formation) as well as vesicle (lens) and tube formation (intestine, other endoderm-derived organs, and most parts of the neural tube). A prerequisite of functional redundancy is an overlapping expression pattern. We therefore examined the expression of Bok, Bax, and Bak mRNA by whole-mount in situ hybridization (WMISH) on wild-type (WT) embryos at E9.5 and E10.5 of development. At E9.5, Bak (Figure 1B) and Bax (Figure 1C) mRNA are present in forebrain structures, including the telencephalon, diencephalon, and optic vesicle and the pharyngeal arches and pouches, while Bok mRNA was detected mainly in the forebrain and neural tube along the length of the body (Figures 1D and 1E). At E10.5, a ubiquitous low-level staining for Bak, Bax, and Bok mRNA was observed throughout the embryo (Figures 1G–1I). Bak (Figure 1G) and Bax (Figure 1H) mRNA levels were present at higher levels in the brain, limb buds, the maxillary and mandibular portions of the first pharyngeal arch, the epithelium of the pharyngeal pouches, and the heart. This largely concurring mRNA-expression pattern between all three multi-BH-domain pro-apoptotic proteins is consistent with the possibility that BOK exerts overlapping functions with BAX and BAK. An additional indicator of functional redundancy is a similar protein structure. After attempts to crystallize human and mouse BOK failed, we instead crystallized and solved the structure of Gallus gallus BOK, which lacked the C-terminal membrane anchor helix and a predicted region of disorder at the N terminus (Figure 2; see Table S1 for crystallographic statistics). Gallus gallus BOK has 81% amino acid sequence identity to human BOK (Figure S1).Figure S1Structural Analysis of BOK, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Sequence alignment of BOK from different species, generated using MultAlin (http://multalin.toulouse.inra.fr/multalin/) (Corpet, 1988Corpet F.

Gallus gallus BOK adopted the canonical BCL-2 helical bundle fold (Figure 2A), which is characteristic of both BAX and BAK, as well as pro-survival BCL-2 family members (Czabotar et al., 2014Czabotar P.E.

Cell Biol. 2014; 15: 49-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (2141) Google Scholar). The overall fold of BOK is similar to human BAK (PDB: 2IMT) (Moldoveanu et al., 2006Moldoveanu T. Liu Q. Tocilj A. Watson M. Shore G. Gehring K. The X-ray structure of a BAK homodimer reveals an inhibitory zinc binding site.Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 677-688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) (Figure 2A). There were two molecules of BOK present in the asymmetric unit of the crystal that differed around the junction of α helices 2 and 3 and in the α3 helix itself (Figure 2B). While chain B (sky blue) had a recognizable α3 helix (Figures 2B and 2D), chain A (light green) displayed a convoluted loop separating two helical turns (Figures 2B, 2C, and electron density shown in Figure S1J). Consequently, the canonical hydrophobic groove is occluded by residues Q92 and Q113 in chain B but adopts a more open conformation in chain A (Figures S1E and S1F). The rigidity of α3 in chain B also results in kinking at the C-terminal end of α2, deforming the region to a point where a hole through the protein is formed bounded by helices α2, α3. and α5, which is absent in chain A (Figures S1G and S1H, respectively). It should be noted that in both molecules of BOK, the conformation of α3 may be influenced by crystal contacts (Figure S1I). Nevertheless, in order to access these conformations, the protein is likely dynamic and flexible in this region, as supported by higher B-factors (Figures 2C and 2D). To test whether Gallus gallus BOK recapitulates constitutive activity as reported for human BOK in vitro, we performed liposome dye release assays. Compared to a human BAK control, chicken BOK permeabilized mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM)-mimicking liposomes in the absence of an activating BH3 peptide (human BID-BH3) (Figure 2E). Moreover, the presence of the BH3 peptide did not enhance BOK-induced dye release, consistent with recently published data for human BOK (Fernández-Marrero et al., 2017Fernández-Marrero Y.

These results reveal that BOK exhibits features of a multi-BH domain pro-apoptotic BCL-2 protein, although uniquely, BOK appears to be auto-active. To obtain TKO and DKO mice, Bok−/−Bax+/−Bak−/− intercrosses and Bax+/−Bak−/− intercrosses were set up, respectively. Genotyping results revealed that at weaning, DKO mice were present at only 4.5% of the total number of newborn pups (10 of 223 offspring, 59 litters). Notably, fewer than 2% TKO animals survived to weaning (7 of 385 offspring, 99 litters; Figure 3A). DKO and TKO pups were subsequently harvested at embryonic day 18.5 (E18.5) to determine whether they were present at the expected numbers just before birth. While the frequency of DKO fetuses did not differ significantly from the expected Mendelian ratio, TKO embryos were significantly underrepresented at this stage (16.8% versus the expected 25%). This reveals that the additional loss"

https://openalex.org/W2803607507,"Sunlight exposure is known to affect mood, learning, and cognition. However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we show that moderate UV exposure elevated blood urocanic acid (UCA), which then crossed the blood-brain barrier. Single-cell mass spectrometry and isotopic labeling revealed a novel intra-neuronal metabolic pathway converting UCA to glutamate (GLU) after UV exposure. This UV-triggered GLU synthesis promoted its packaging into synaptic vesicles and its release at glutamatergic terminals in the motor cortex and hippocampus. Related behaviors, like rotarod learning and object recognition memory, were enhanced after UV exposure. All UV-induced metabolic, electrophysiological, and behavioral effects could be reproduced by the intravenous injection of UCA and diminished by the application of inhibitor or short hairpin RNA (shRNA) against urocanase, an enzyme critical for the conversion of UCA to GLU. These findings reveal a new GLU biosynthetic pathway, which could contribute to some of the sunlight-induced neurobehavioral changes."
https://openalex.org/W2804079254,"We investigated the means and timing by which mutations become fixed in the human colonic epithelium by visualizing somatic clones and mathematical inference. Fixation requires two sequential steps. First, one of approximately seven active stem cells residing within each colonic crypt has to be mutated. Second, the mutated stem cell has to replace neighbors to populate the entire crypt in a process that takes several years. Subsequent clonal expansion due to crypt fission is infrequent for neutral mutations (around 0.7% of all crypts undergo fission in a single year). Pro-oncogenic mutations subvert both stem cell replacement to accelerate fixation and clonal expansion by crypt fission to achieve high mutant allele frequencies with age. The benchmarking of these behaviors allows the advantage associated with different gene-specific mutations to be compared irrespective of the cellular mechanisms by which they are conferred."

These peculiar fluid properties proved necessary to adjust to the geometry of capillaries upon bacterial proliferation. Intermittent attractive forces thus generate a fluidized phase that allows for efficient colonization of the blood capillary network during infection. Mechanisms and principles driving bacterial aggregation are highly diverse, because they depend on the specific properties of the bacterial species involved and the conditions they live in. Bacterial aggregates in the context of biofilms, for instance, are the focus of intense study because of their clinical importance as a mechanism of antibiotic resistance. Their mechanical properties are largely defined by the self-produced matrix comprising DNA, polysaccharides, and proteins, which behave as a hydrated polymeric meshwork. Such structures display viscoelastic properties, combining both viscous fluid and elastic behavior (Persat et al., 2015Persat A. Nadell C.D. Kim M.K. Ingremeau F. Siryaporn A. Drescher K. Wingreen N.S. Bassler B.L. Gitai Z. Stone H.A. The mechanical world of bacteria.Cell. 2015; 161: 988-997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). A second type of bacterial aggregates relies on bacterial motility. In particular, Escherichia coli or Salmonella typhimurium are able to form clusters of different shapes and sizes that depend on flagella-based motility and chemotactic cues (Budrene and Berg, 1991Budrene E.O. Berg H.C. Complex patterns formed by motile cells of Escherichia coli.Nature. 1991; 349: 630-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Another example of motility-driven aggregation is that of Neisseria gonorrheae. In this case, the retractile properties of their long filamentous organelles, known as type IV pili (T4P), allow them to move on surfaces, a process known as twitching motility. Combined with interactions between pili this motility promotes bacterial clustering (Taktikos et al., 2015Taktikos J. Lin Y.T. Stark H. Biais N. Zaburdaev V. Pili-induced clustering of N. gonorrhoeae Bacteria.PLoS ONE. 2015; 10: e0137661Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, Oldewurtel et al., 2015Oldewurtel E.R. Kouzel N. Dewenter L. Henseler K. Maier B. Differential interaction forces govern bacterial sorting in early biofilms.eLife. 2015; 4: 4Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In addition to Neisseria gonorrhoeae, T4P are expressed by a large number of Gram-negative bacteria including human pathogens, such as Vibrio cholerae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, or Neisseria meningitidis, and Gram-positive bacteria, such as Streptococcus sanguinis. T4P are several microns long semi-flexible fibers extending out of the bacterial body. In Neisseria spp., pili are highly dynamic as they grow and retract at speeds in the order of 1 μm/s. As they retract through an ATP-dependent process, individual pili can generate very high forces, reaching up to 100 pN for single pili and 10-fold this value for bundles of pili (Biais et al., 2008Biais N. Ladoux B. Higashi D. So M. Sheetz M. Cooperative retraction of bundled type IV pili enables nanonewton force generation.PLoS Biol. 2008; 6: e87Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, Maier et al., 2002Maier B. Potter L. So M.

Pilus-pilus interaction is thought to promote auto-aggregation. In Neisseria meningitidis, T4P are central virulence factors required for bacterial adhesion along the endothelium and subsequent formation of intravascular aggregates. This vascular colonization process is a prerequisite for vascular damage observed during infection (Melican et al., 2013Melican K. Michea Veloso P. Martin T. Bruneval P. Duménil G. Adhesion of Neisseria meningitidis to dermal vessels leads to local vascular damage and purpura in a humanized mouse model.PLoS Pathog. 2013; 9: e1003139Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In vitro studies have shown that aggregates formed by N. meningitidis also depend on type IV pili, but the biophysical properties of these clusters and their impact on the infection process have not been characterized. Once bacteria adhere to capillary endothelial cells, they proliferate and progressively occlude the vessel lumen. Growth in the tubular and sometimes tortuous geometry found in capillaries imposes important mechanical constraints that require specific adaptation. This interdisciplinary work explores how the biophysical properties of N. meningitidis aggregates determine human disease progression. During meningococcal infection, bacterial aggregates can be found in the lumen of capillaries located in most organs, including the brain, but the impact of aggregation on disease progression is unknown (Mairey et al., 2006Mairey E. Genovesio A. Donnadieu E. Bernard C. Jaubert F. Pinard E. Seylaz J. Olivo-Marin J.C. Nassif X. Duménil G. Cerebral microcirculation shear stress levels determine Neisseria meningitidis attachment sites along the blood-brain barrier.J. Exp. Med. 2006; 203: 1939-1950Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Such aggregates also form in human capillaries of a humanized mouse model based on human skin xenograft, which reproduces the key histological features of N. meningitidis infection (Melican et al., 2013Melican K. Michea Veloso P. Martin T. Bruneval P. Duménil G. Adhesion of Neisseria meningitidis to dermal vessels leads to local vascular damage and purpura in a humanized mouse model.PLoS Pathog. 2013; 9: e1003139Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In such a model, 6 hr post-infection aggregates filled the vessel lumen along tens to hundreds of micrometers of tortuous and sometimes anastomosed capillary networks (Figure 1A). To assess the role of aggregation, we exploited a naturally occurring variant of the major pilin termed PilESA (Nassif et al., 1993Nassif X. Lowy J. Stenberg P. O’Gaora P. Ganji A. So M. Antigenic variation of pilin regulates adhesion of Neisseria meningitidis to human epithelial cells.Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 719-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). This variant occurred spontaneously through a genetic recombination system present in Neisseria species (Rotman and Seifert, 2014Rotman E. Seifert H.S. The genetics of Neisseria species.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2014; 48: 405-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In contrast with the frequently occurring PilESB variant that promotes both adhesion and aggregation, the PilESA variant selectively promotes adhesion but not aggregation (Figure S1A). At the initial stage of interaction with host cells, individual bacteria from a strain expressing the SA and SB pilin variants had the same ability to adhere to endothelial cells in the presence of flow and proliferated at the same speed (Figures S1B and S1C). However, at later stages in vitro, single adhering bacteria of the PilESB variant formed 3D, densely packed microcolonies on the cellular surface upon proliferation, whereas the PilESA variant led to more dispersed, 2D microcolonies formed by a single bacterial monolayer and thus containing less bacteria (Figures S1D and S1E). In vivo, the aggregative capacity of bacteria did not affect survival in the blood of infected animals (Figure 1B). At the initial time points of infection (6 hr), aggregation had little effect on the ability of the bacteria to accumulate along vessels, but after 24 hr the non-aggregative strain showed a 60-fold decrease in bacteria number in the human skin compared to the aggregative one (Figure 1C). These results show that bacterial auto-aggregation is important for efficient late colonization of the endothelium and disease progression, underlining the ability of aggregates to highly deform in order to adapt to the complex geometry of the microcirculation.Figure S1In Vitro Characterization of the Pilin Variants PilESA and PilESB, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Representative pictures of the GFP-expressing pilin variants PilESB and PilESA (OD600 = 0.3) at time t = 0 and 50 min after vortexing.

The above results raised the question of the physical mechanisms governing the formation and dynamics of N. meningitidis aggregates. Interestingly, several properties of aggregates formed in vitro were reminiscent of the behavior of liquid droplets. In liquid suspension, N. meningitidis cells spontaneously formed quasi-spherical, dynamic aggregates that tended to sediment to the bottom of the wells without adhering to the surface (Figures 2A and S2A; Video S1). In addition, when two aggregates came in close proximity, they rapidly fused and relaxed to a larger, spherical aggregate within a few minutes (Figures 2B and S2B–S2E; Video S1), suggesting that they can be described as a liquid phase endowed with an effective surface tension. This viscous liquid behavior was also corroborated by wetting experiments in which progressive aggregate spreading on an adhesive surface could be observed by total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy (Figures S2F–S2I). To quantify the mechanical properties of this phase, we adapted a micropipette aspiration protocol to our system (Guevorkian et al., 2010Guevorkian K. Colbert M.J. Durth M. Dufour S. Brochard-Wyart F. Aspiration of biological viscoelastic drops.Phys. Rev. Lett. 2010; 104: 218101Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, Guevorkian et al., 2011Guevorkian K. Gonzalez-Rodriguez D.

Interestingly, in the range of applied pressures (10–100 Pa), the length of the tongue linearly increased over time, indicating a purely viscous liquid behavior (Figure 2E). By analyzing the dynamics of the aggregates and further applying the Laplace law, we could obtain estimations of the aggregate viscosity (9 Pa.s) and surface tension at rest (0.1 mN/m) (Figures 2F and 2G). Thus, aggregates of N. meningitidis exhibit a liquid-like behavior with no elastic component even at short timescales. As a comparison, values of viscosity and surface tension for common viscous liquids can be found in Table S1. The viscosity of N. meningitidis aggregates is close to that of honey (2–10 Pa.s); however, its surface tension is much lower than that of honey (50–60 mN/m).Figure S2In Vitro Characterization of N. meningitidis WT Aggregates, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) On the left, WT iRFP aggregates formed inside a plastic bottom channel (Ibidi) were submitted to low intensity flow for 1 min.

To gain insights into the interactions driving this viscous behavior, we then moved to a smaller scale and characterized the motion of single fluorescently labeled wild-type (WT) bacteria inside aggregates, 30–40 μm in diameter, using spinning disk confocal imaging at high spatiotemporal resolution (Figures 3A, S3A, and S3B; Video S3). We characterized the movement of individual bacteria by an effective 2D diffusion coefficient, calculated based on the analysis of mean square displacements of single bacterial tracks over different time intervals, and consequent linear fit. This value integrates both phases of free diffusion and active pulling and provides a general characterization of bacterial motility within the aggregate. These results showed that diffusion coefficient was small for bacteria close to the aggregate center of mass (CM), and progressively increased with the distance from the center (dCM) reaching maximal values at the aggregate periphery. The relationship between bacterial diffusion coefficient and distance to the center was confirmed over multiple aggregates (N = 20) after normalization for aggregate size (Figure 3B). The values of diffusion coefficients corresponding to a ∼10-μm-thick outer layer (0.3–0.5 μm2/s) exceeded the diffusion coefficient of single freely diffusing bacteria (Figures 3B and 3C). Diffusion of individual diplococci in suspension in liquid medium was determined experimentally to be 0.25 μm2/s and was not affected by piliation as a non-piliated strain (pilD) exhibited the same motility, consistently with the passive diffusive motion of a 1-μm-diameter particle in water. This feature stands in contrast to ordinary liquids at equilibrium, where attractive intermolecular forces ensure cohesion and slow down particle motion compared to the gas phase. In the case of N. meningitidis bacterial aggregates, we found on the contrary that individual bacteria within the aggregate (liquid phase) exhibit an apparent diffusion coefficient higher than non-interacting single bacteria outside of the aggregate (dispersed or gas-like phase). Pursuing the analogy with the movement of particles of a classical fluid in a liquid or dispersed phase, we concluded that this active system displays an anomalously fluidized phase, the origin of which deserves further clarification.Figure S3In Vitro and In Silico Quantification of Single Bacterial Motility within Aggregates and in Isolation, Related to Figures 3–6Show full caption(A) Mean square displacement of individual bacteria inside an aggregate.

To elucidate the origin of the unusual properties of N. meningitidis aggregates, we focused on the likely elementary building block of bacterial aggregation, i.e., the interactions between two cells. To this aim, we performed time-lapse microscopy of 2–10 isolated WT bacteria confined in quasi-2D circular microfabricated (width = 50 μm; height = 10 μm) agar chambers (Figure 4A). Bacteria were prevented from interacting with the glass substrate by passivation with a hydrophobic molecule (PLL-PEG), and no evidence of twitching motility could be observed in these conditions (Figures S3C and S3D). Bacteria diffused freely in the chambers, until two of them rapidly moved toward each other and got in close contact (Figure 4B; Vide"

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a complex disorder that evolves from the interactions between poorly understood environmental factors and a host’s genetic framework that together define susceptibility to and severity of disease. Pathology is influenced by specific host elements that include the autochthonous commensal microbiota, which is acquired at birth, the intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) barrier, and subjacent immune cells within the intestinal mucosa (Kaser et al., 2010Kaser A. Zeissig S. Blumberg R.S. Inflammatory bowel disease.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2010; 28: 573-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1482) Google Scholar). One of the great challenges of understanding IBD pathogenesis stems from efforts to elucidate the molecular details surrounding the environmental basis for these disorders. This is increasingly important, since epidemiologic studies have revealed a rapid global expansion of these diseases that includes geographic regions, which have heretofore been unaffected (Molodecky and Kaplan, 2010Molodecky N.A. Kaplan G.G. Environmental risk factors for inflammatory bowel disease.Gastroenterol. Hepatol. (N. Y.). 2010; 6: 339-346PubMed Google Scholar). A potential opportunity to investigate this question has emerged from recent studies on the role of CD1d and natural killer T (NKT) cells (NKT) in mucosal biology. CD1d is a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-related molecule that presents cell-associated and microbial lipid antigens to NKT cells (Brennan et al., 2013Brennan P.J. Brigl M. Brenner M.B. Invariant natural killer T cells: an innate activation scheme linked to diverse effector functions.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2013; 13: 101-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). In the intestines, CD1d is expressed by IECs and hematopoietic cells and presents endogenous (self) or exogenous lipid antigens to NKT cells expressing an invariant T cell receptor (TCR) α chain (iNKT cells) or a semi-diverse (d) set of TCR-α chains (dNKT), which are present in human and mouse intestines (Rossjohn et al., 2012Rossjohn J. Pellicci D.G. Patel O. Gapin L. Godfrey D.I. Recognition of CD1d-restricted antigens by natural killer T cells.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2012; 12: 845-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Experimental models using chemical induction of colitis using a classic hapten, oxazolone (Wirtz et al., 2007Wirtz S. Neufert C. Weigmann B. Neurath M.F. Chemically induced mouse models of intestinal inflammation.Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 541-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1157) Google Scholar), implicate a role for NKT cells in the pathogenesis of IBD and have been corroborated in some patient studies (Fuss et al., 2004Fuss I.J. Heller F. Boirivant M. Leon F. Yoshida M. Fichtner-Feigl S. Yang Z. Exley M. Kitani A. Blumberg R.S. et al.Nonclassical CD1d-restricted NK T cells that produce IL-13 characterize an atypical Th2 response in ulcerative colitis.J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 113: 1490-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). Boirevant and colleagues first demonstrated that administration of oxazolone directly to the colon in ethanol of SJL/J mice, or in later studies indirectly after skin painting and sensitization, suggesting a model of haptenization, resulted in a severe acute, superficial inflammation due to the production of interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13 that was counterbalanced by tumor growth factor β, which delimited the inflammation to the distal colon (Boirivant et al., 1998Boirivant M. Fuss I.J. Chu A. Strober W. Oxazolone colitis: A murine model of T helper cell type 2 colitis treatable with antibodies to interleukin 4.J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1929-1939Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). This restriction to type 2 cytokines was eventually recognized to be genetically based as similar studies in C57BL/6 mice revealed inflammation in association with oxazolone that was due to type 1 cytokines (namely interferon γ, IFN-γ) derived from hematopoietic cells (Iijima et al., 2004Iijima H. Neurath M.F. Nagaishi T. Glickman J.N. Nieuwenhuis E.E. Nakajima A. Chen D. Fuss I.J. Utku N. Lewicki D.N. et al.Specific regulation of T helper cell 1-mediated murine colitis by CEACAM1.J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 471-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In later groundbreaking studies by Heller and colleagues, it was recognized that oxazolone-induced colitis was dependent upon CD1d and iNKT cells, as an inflammatory response to oxazolone was abrogated by the deletion of Cd1d or Jα18, encoding the invariant TCR-α chain (Heller et al., 2002Heller F. Fuss I.J. Nieuwenhuis E.E. Blumberg R.S. Strober W.

Sotlar K. et al.Protective mucosal immunity mediated by epithelial CD1d and IL-10.Nature. 2014; 509: 497-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In contrast, CD1d-expressing IECs were shown to secrete anti-inflammatory IL-10 in response to iNKT cells in a CD1d-dependent manner, which serves to restrain oxazolone-induced inflammation derived from the hematopoietic system (Colgan et al., 1999Colgan S.P. Hershberg R.M. Furuta G.T. Blumberg R.S. Ligation of intestinal epithelial CD1d induces bioactive IL-10: critical role of the cytoplasmic tail in autocrine signaling.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Thus, when CD1d-restricted pathways in the IEC are specifically eliminated by conditional genetic deletion of Cd1d, microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (Mttp), an endoplasmic reticulum resident protein that serves to regulate CD1d lipidation and its ability to function, or Il10, oxazolone-induced colitis is unrestrained and severe (Dougan et al., 2005Dougan S.K.

Human studies have further identified a potential role for dNKT cells in IBD by showing elevated IL-13 production by lamina propria mononuclear cells in response to sulfatide, a CD1d-restricted self-antigen that can activate iNKT and dNKT cells (Fuss et al., 2004Fuss I.J. Heller F. Boirivant M. Leon F. Yoshida M. Fichtner-Feigl S. Yang Z. Exley M. Kitani A.

Further, TCR transgenic mice expressing a non-invariant CD1d-restricted TCR develop colitis (Wang et al., 2018Wang Y. Sedimbi S. Löfbom L. Singh A.K. Porcelli S.A. Cardell S.L. Unique invariant natural killer T cells promote intestinal polyps by suppressing TH1 immunity and promoting regulatory T cells.Mucosal Immunol. 2018; 11: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), though their exact role during the pathogenesis of IBD remains unknown (Grose et al., 2007Grose R.H. Thompson F.M. Baxter A.G. Pellicci D.G. Cummins A.G. Deficiency of invariant NK T cells in Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis.Dig. Dis.

Immunol. 2001; 100: 144-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Importantly, host inflammatory responses to oxazolone occur even in animals raised under germ-free (GF) conditions, indicating that NKT-cell-mediated response to self (rather than microbial)-lipid antigens presented by CD1d on professional and/or non-professional APCs is sufficient for pathogenesis (Olszak et al., 2012Olszak T.

Microbial exposure during early life has persistent effects on natural killer T cell function.Science. 2012; 336: 489-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (1188) Google Scholar). Instead, commensal bacteria themselves can modulate the magnitude of NKT cell responses either by directly altering the CD1d-restricted lipid antigen reservoir (An et al., 2014An D. Oh S.F. Olszak T.

Microbial exposure during early life has persistent effects on natural killer T cell function.Science. 2012; 336: 489-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (1188) Google Scholar). Conversely, CD1d itself plays a critical role in regulating the composition and extent of colonization by both commensal and pathogenic microbial species potentially through disruption of the antimicrobial activity of Paneth cells (Nieuwenhuis et al., 2002Nieuwenhuis E.E. Matsumoto T. Exley M. Schleipman R.A. Glickman J. Bailey D.T. Corazza N. Colgan S.P. Onderdonk A.B. Blumberg R.S. CD1d-dependent macrophage-mediated clearance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa from lung.Nat.

The similarities between these biological observations in mouse models and current hypotheses for IBD pathogenesis lead us to hypothesize that oxazolone may be an example of a much larger collection of environmental chemical moieties capable of triggering CD1d-restricted iNKT cell responses. Consistent with this, we have identified environmental mimetics of oxazolone that are derived from dietary, industrial, or microbial sources that are characterized by the presence of a five-membered oxazole ring and capable of driving CD1d-dependent inflammation through activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) pathway within IECs of the colon. As efforts to define and evaluate natural and synthetic chemicals involved in homeostasis or disease have generally been elusive, these results have broad implications for understanding the environmental basis of mucosal diseases, such as IBD. 4-ethoxymethylene-2-phenyl-2-oxazol-5-one (referred to as oxazolone; Figure 1A) has been widely utilized in models of contact hypersensitivity and, when applied to the mucosa, has been proposed to cause colitis through its properties as a hapten (Gorbachev and Fairchild, 2001Gorbachev A.V. Fairchild R.L. Induction and regulation of T-cell priming for contact hypersensitivity.Crit. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 21: 451-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, to date, there is limited evidence for hapten-specific antibody production or responses following topical oxazolone sensitization or hapten-modified autologous proteins or luminal antigens identified at mucosal sites (Singleton et al., 2016Singleton H.

Interestingly, upon analysis of previously published microarray studies derived from epithelial-enriched colon fractions following intra-rectal oxazolone challenge (Olszak et al., 2014Olszak T. Neves J.F. Dowds C.M. Baker K. Glickman J. Davidson N.O. Lin C.S. Jobin C. Brand S. Sotlar K. et al.Protective mucosal immunity mediated by epithelial CD1d and IL-10.Nature. 2014; 509: 497-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), we observed decreased expression of Mttp/MTP and increased expression for elements associated with AhR signaling, including P450 enzymes (cyp1a1) and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (Ido1). We therefore asked whether oxazolone could affect the expression of these transcripts in the intestinal epithelium in a cell-intrinsic manner by directly stimulating an immortalized IECs derived from mouse small intestine, MODE-K, with oxazolone. We observed downregulation of Mttp and induction of metabolic genes cyp1a1 and Ido1 (Figures 1B and S1A).Figure S1A Minimal Oxazole Structure Modulates Intestinal Epithelial Transcriptional and Antigen Presentation Capacity to Invariant and Non-variant NKT Cells, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Relative transcript abundance in MODE-K cells conditioned with the indicated compounds, normalized to β-actin. ∗∗p < 0.01 (Student’s t test).(B and C) CD1d-restricted Interleukin 10 production in the absence of exogenous lipid supplementation in MODE-K cells conditioned with the indicated compounds followed by co-culture with (B) invariant NKT (24.8) or (C) non-invariant NKT (14S.6) hybridomas. ∗∗∗p < 0.001 (Student’s t test).(D) Interferon γ production in bone marrow derived dendritic cells conditioned with the indicated compounds followed by loading with α-galactosyl ceramide and co-cultured with 24.7 iNKT hybridoma.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) (A) Relative transcript abundance in MODE-K cells conditioned with the indicated compounds, normalized to β-actin. ∗∗p < 0.01 (Student’s t test).

MTP is a critical regulator of mucosal homeostasis that promotes epithelial barrier activity by controlling CD1d-restricted IL-10 production by epithelial cells (Colgan et al., 1999Colgan S.P.

Thus, IEC-specific deletion of Mttp results in decreased CD1d-stimulated IL-10 production by the IEC, leading to the exaggerated inflammatory activity of hematopoietic cells in response to oxazolone challenge, resulting in increased colitis (Olszak et al., 2014Olszak T. Neves J.F. Dowds C.M. Baker K. Glickman J. Davidson N.O. Lin C.S. Jobin C. Brand S. Sotlar K. et al.Protective mucosal immunity mediated by epithelial CD1d and IL-10.Nature. 2014; 509: 497-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). We modeled interactions between NKT cells and IECs using MODE-K cells and CD1d-restricted T cell hybridomas in a previously established CD1d-dependent co-culture system (van de Wal et al., 2003van de Wal Y. Corazza N. Allez M. Mayer L.F. Iijima H. Ryan M. Cornwall S. Kaiserlian D. Hershberg R.

These studies have shown that loading of CD1d with α-galactosyl ceramide (GC), a cognate lipid antigen, in this co-culture system leads to MTP-dependent, CD1d-restricted IL-10 production that is primarily derived from the IEC (Colgan et al., 1999Colgan S.P.

Sotlar K. et al.Protective mucosal immunity mediated by epithelial CD1d and IL-10.Nature. 2014; 509: 497-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Here, we found that MODE-K cells pre-conditioned with oxazolone exhibited attenuated IL-10 production in response to α-GC when placed in co-culture with an iNKT cell hybridoma (24.7), which specifically reacts to α-GC presented on CD1d (Figure 1C). Interestingly, epithelial-derived IL-10 was also suppressed when IECs stimulated with oxazolone were co-cultured with an autoreactive iNKT cell hybridoma (24.8) or an autoreactive non-invariant dNKT cell hybridoma (14S.6) in the absence of exogenously administered α-GC (Figures S1B and S1C). These effects were specific to the IEC, as co-culture of bone-marrow-derived dendritic cells with the 24.7 iNKT cell hybridoma and α-GC lead to production of IFN-γ (Figure S1D), but not IL-10 (data not shown), which was not affected by oxazolone or any of the oxazolone-related compounds described below. In light of the decreased MTP expression observed in oxazolone-treated IECs (Figure 1B) and given that MTP loss alters the ability of CD1d to acquire exogenous antigens, such as α-GC, and CD1d-elicited IL-10 responses by epithelial cells (Dougan et al., 2005Dougan S.K.

IECs stimulated with oxazolone did not display altered CD1d protein expression or distribution between intracellular and cell surface pools (Figures S2A and S2B) but instead exhibited decreased loading of α-GC on CD1d at the cell surface (Figures 1D and 1E). These results were consistent with the decreased CD1d-restricted IL-10 protein production we observed in MODE-K:iNKT cell co-cultures (Figures 1C, S1B, and S1C) and suggest that oxazolone-induced alterations in MTP expression were associated with decreased CD1d function, affecting IL-10 production in response to iNKT cells. Oxazolone is administered in experimental models of colitis and contact sensitivity but is also widely used in industry and pharmaceuticals as a pharmacophore for the generation of synthetic compounds, suggesting it may act as a potential environmental trigger of inflammation in sensitive hosts (Turchi, 2008Turchi I.J. Chemistry of Heterocyclic Compounds. John Wiley & Sons, 2008Google Scholar). We therefore sought to identify a library of structural mimetics of oxazolone and test whether these molecules behaved in a similar manner. We performed a two-part in silico screen against three chemical databases of naturally occurring compounds (the Human Metabolome Database, the Super Natural II database, Dictionary of Natural Products) (Banerjee et al., 2015Banerjee P. Erehman J. Gohlke B.-O. Wilhelm T. Preissner R. Dunkel M.

Natural compounds were queried in the standard simplified molecular input line entry system (SMILES) format, and Tanimoto similarities between oxazolone and test compounds were computed with the ChemMine Similarity Workbench, which calculated maximum common substructure (MCS) similarities with the Tanimoto coefficient. Further, Euclidean distance scores were calculated using a non-continuous atom-matching structural similarity function (NAMS) (Cao et al., 2008Cao Y. Jiang T. Girke T. A maximum common substructure-based algorithm for searching and predicting drug-like compounds.Bioinformatics. 2008; 24: i366-i374Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, Teixeira and Falcao, 2013Teixeira A.L. Falcao A.O. Noncontiguous atom matching structural similarity function.J. Chem. Inf. Model. 2013; 53: 2511-2524Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). An initial screen identified 33 compounds with MCS > 0.5 and Euclidean distance scores cutoff of 0.9 (Table S1). Oxazolone consists of four major functional moieties: a five-membered oxazole ring, a 2′ phenylgroup, a 4’ ethoxymethylene substituent, and the 5′-carbonyl lactone. Our computational screen revealed the oxazole ring to be a distinctive and shared chemical substructure between the 33 compounds identified, all of which derived from dietary, microbial, and/or industrial sources. We then employed a second screen using the same parameters but instead substituting a minimal oxazole ring as our template structure. The analysis led to the identification of 63 naturally occurring oxazole-containing compounds (OxCs; including the 33 described above). Of particular interest, we noticed that many of these compounds derived from two major sources: diet and microbes. This led us to ask whether oxazolone is a molecular prototype for a broader class of environmental stimuli that feature an oxazole substructure capable of modulating epithelial CD1d-restricted responses in a cell-intrinsic manner. To test this, we devised a systematic in vitro system to assess transcriptional and CD1d-restricted responses in IECs in response to stimulation with dietary OxC structures, including 2,4,5-trimethyl-2,5-dihydro-1,3-oxazole (referred to as TMO; Figure 1A)—found in coffee, peanuts, and meats—that lacks the 2-phenyl ring, 5-ketone, and 4-ethoxymethylene present in oxazolone (Maga, 1978Maga J.A. Oxazoles and oxazolines in foods.J. Agric. Food Chem. 1978; 26: 1049-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Like oxazolone, TMO suppressed Mttp and induced cyp1a1 and Ido1 transcripts in IECs (Figures 1B and S1A). In contrast, two structurally related non-OxC heterocyclic aromatic compounds—1,2,4-trimethylcyclopentane (TMC; MCS = 0.5) and 2-methyl-1-pyrroline (1-MP; MCS = 0.83)—that substitute carbons at the 1’-oxygen and/or 3′-nitrogen did not elicit any transcriptional changes in the target genes assessed (Figure 1B). Moreover, IECs conditioned with oxazolone or TMO, but not with TMC or 1-MP, lead to decreased loading of α-GC on CD1d at the cell surface, thereby limiting CD1d-restricted IL-10 production in co-cultures with an iNKT hybridoma (24.7) (Figures 1C–1E). Overall, five of seven commercially available naturally occurring dietary OxCs, as well as vinclozolin (Figure 1A and Table S1), an OxC fungicide used in agriculture, phenocopied the transcriptional and CD1d-restricted epithelial responses obser"

https://openalex.org/W2803588403,"One hallmark of adult neurogenesis is its adaptability to environmental influences. Here, we uncovered the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) as a key regulator of adult neurogenesis as its deletion in neural stem cells (NSCs) and their progeny in the murine subependymal zone (SEZ) strongly impairs their proliferation and neurogenic output in the olfactory bulb. Importantly, alteration of fluid flow promotes proliferation of SEZ cells in an ENaC-dependent manner, eliciting sodium and calcium signals that regulate proliferation via calcium-release-activated channels and phosphorylation of ERK. Flow-induced calcium signals are restricted to NSCs in contact with the ventricular fluid, thereby providing a highly specific mechanism to regulate NSC behavior at this special interface with the cerebrospinal fluid. Thus, ENaC plays a central role in regulating adult neurogenesis, and among multiple modes of ENaC function, flow-induced changes in sodium signals are critical for NSC biology."

Apoptosis plays a vital role in tissue remodeling during development, removal of damaged cells, pathogen immune defense, cancer surveillance, and the effectiveness of cancer therapy. Apoptosis is a physiological program of cell suicide that eliminates cells without inflammation. Classical apoptosis is triggered by BCL-2 family-mediated mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) and activation of caspase proteases. Apoptosis can be triggered by cell death receptor ligands, such as FasL and TRAIL, which activate caspases-8 and -10 (extrinsic pathway), or by internal stresses (intrinsic pathway), which activate caspase-2, or by cytotoxic lymphocyte granzymes (Gzm) that cleave Bid to truncated t-Bid to activate MOMP (Taylor et al., 2008Taylor R.C. Cullen S.P. Martin S.J. Apoptosis: controlled demolition at the cellular level.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (1913) Google Scholar). Mitochondria play a central role in apoptosis. The BCL-2 family is divided into 3 classes: multidomain anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Mcl-1), proapoptotic BH3-only proteins (Bid, Bad), and proapoptotic multidomain proteins (Bax, Bak). The BH3-only proteins activate Bax or Bak in the mitochondrial outer membrane to form pores that release apoptogenic factors, including cytochrome c, from the mitochondrial intermembrane space (IMS) to the cytosol (Green and Kroemer, 2004Green D.R. Kroemer G. The pathophysiology of mitochondrial cell death.Science. 2004; 305: 626-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (2815) Google Scholar, Youle and Strasser, 2008Youle R.J. Strasser A. The BCL-2 protein family: opposing activities that mediate cell death.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 47-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (3553) Google Scholar). Released cytochrome c drives apoptosome assembly to activate caspase-9. Any initiator caspases (-2, -8, -9, and -10), which are activated by dimerization and autoproteolysis, can cleave and activate the effector caspases (-3, -6, and -7), which then cleave hundreds of cellular proteins in an accelerating cascade to orchestrate programmed cell death. The effector caspases also cleave Bid, further amplifying apoptosis by increasing MOMP. In type I cells, death does not require MOMP, while in type II cells, death requires MOMP. Apoptosis research has mostly focused on protein degradation by the caspases, MOMP and DNA fragmentation. Although much is known about protein changes during cell death, little is known about the fate of RNA (Thomas and Lieberman, 2013Thomas M.P. Lieberman J. Live or let die: posttranscriptional gene regulation in cell stress and cell death.Immunol. Rev. 2013; 253: 237-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, profound changes to RNAs and RNA biogenesis during programmed cell death strongly promote cell death. Nuclear export of newly synthesized RNAs and mRNA splicing are disrupted during both classical caspase-dependent apoptosis and caspase-independent programmed cell death, activated by the Gzms (Rajani et al., 2012Rajani D.K. Walch M. Martinvalet D. Thomas M.P. Lieberman J. Alterations in RNA processing during immune-mediated programmed cell death.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109: 8688-8693Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Moreover, disruption of mRNA splicing significantly promotes cell death. Recently, we found that preexisting mRNAs, but not some noncoding (nc)RNAs, are rapidly and markedly degraded during apoptosis (Thomas et al., 2015Thomas M.P. Liu X. Whangbo J. McCrossan G. Sanborn K.B. Basar E. Walch M. Lieberman J. Apoptosis triggers specific, rapid, and global mRNA decay with 3′ uridylated intermediates degraded by DIS3L2.Cell Rep. 2015; 11: 1079-1089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). mRNA decay occurs early after apoptosis triggered by diverse classical apoptotic stimuli (cytotoxic attack, death receptor ligation, staurosporine [STS], etoposide, tunicamycin, and thapsigargin), before membrane lipid scrambling, DNA fragmentation, and inactivation of translation initiation factors. Widespread mRNA decay occurs only in classical apoptosis, but not during oxidative stress or caspase-independent programmed cell death. Moreover, mRNA decay is largely responsible for apoptotic translational arrest—other stress-induced events, such as eIF2α phosphorylation, occur after translation is already halted. Apoptosis-related mRNA decay depends on MOMP—it does not occur when MOMP is blocked in BCL2-overexpressing or BAX−/−BAK−/− cells (Thomas et al., 2015Thomas M.P. Liu X. Whangbo J. McCrossan G. Sanborn K.B. Basar E. Walch M. Lieberman J. Apoptosis triggers specific, rapid, and global mRNA decay with 3′ uridylated intermediates degraded by DIS3L2.Cell Rep. 2015; 11: 1079-1089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Caspase inhibition only partly attenuates it. During apoptosis, mRNA decay intermediates with nontemplated 3′-oligouridylate additions near the stop codon are generated by 3′ terminal uridylyl transferases (TUTase), TUT4 and TUT7. The uridylated intermediates are further degraded by the 3′-5′ exoribonuclease DIS3L2, which preferentially recognizes oligouridylated 3′ ends. Knockdown of TUT4/7 or DIS3L2 inhibits apoptotic mRNA decay, caspase activation, and cell death by ∼2-fold and promotes cell survival by colony-forming assay, suggesting that mRNA decay is important for making sure the death program passes the “point of no return.” Conversely, DIS3L2 overexpression and transcription inhibitors enhance apoptosis. In nonapoptotic cells, the TUTases and DIS3L2 act in quality control pathways to regulate mRNAs and non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) (Pirouz et al., 2016Pirouz M. Du P. Munafò M. Gregory R.I. Dis3l2-mediated decay is a quality control pathway for noncoding RNAs.Cell Rep. 2016; 16: 1861-1873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, Ustianenko et al., 2016Ustianenko D.

Although the TUTases and DIS3L2 participate in apoptotic mRNA decay, how MOMP triggers apoptotic decay is unknown. Here, we show that MOMP-dependent RNA decay is independent of translation, and both mRNAs and poly(A) ncRNAs are decayed. Moreover, the trigger of global apoptotic RNA decay is the mitochondrial IMS exoribonuclease, PNPT1. PNPT1 evolved from bacterial polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase), an enzyme that adds adenylates to the 3′ end of bacterial RNAs and is a 3′-5′ exoribonuclease (Arraiano et al., 2010Arraiano C.M.

Polynucleotide phosphorylase: an evolutionary conserved gene with an expanding repertoire of functions.Pharmacol. Ther. 2006; 112: 243-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). PNPase regulates bacterial mRNA half-lives and preferentially binds to 3′-adenines. Surprisingly mammalian PNPT1 localizes to the IMS, a region not known to contain RNA (Chen et al., 2006Chen H.W. Rainey R.N. Balatoni C.E. Dawson D.W. Troke J.J. Wasiak S. Hong J.S. McBride H.M. Koehler C.M. Teitell M.A. French S.W. Mammalian polynucleotide phosphorylase is an intermembrane space RNase that maintains mitochondrial homeostasis.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 8475-8487Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). PNPT1 imports chromosomally encoded RNAs that are essential for mitochondrial respiration into the mitochondrial matrix (Wang et al., 2010Wang G. Chen H.W. Oktay Y. Zhang J. Allen E.L. Smith G.M. Fan K.C. Hong J.S. French S.W. McCaffery J.M. et al.PNPASE regulates RNA import into mitochondria.Cell. 2010; 142: 456-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). PNPT1 may also process polycistronic mitochondrial transcripts and tRNAs. PNPT1 mutation that impairs mitochondrial import causes early embryonic lethality. Here, we show that MOMP releases PNPT1 from the IMS. The releasate from t-Bid-treated mitochondria and recombinant PNPT1 cause in vitro mRNA decay. Depleting PNPT1 from the apoptotic mitochondrial releasate blocks in vitro RNA decay. PNPT1 causes selective in vitro decay of poly(A) RNAs and of synthetic RNAs lacking 3′ structures. Our data suggest that the target selectivity of PNPT1 is due, at least in part, to 3′ end secondary structures, such as stem-loops, present on many ncRNAs. PNPT1 knockdown inhibits apoptotic mRNA decay, translation arrest, caspase-3 activation, and cell death, which is restored by ectopic expression of enzymatically active, but not RNase-defective, PNPT1. Moreover, PNPT1 overexpression enhances apoptosis, and overexpression of mislocalized PNPT1 in the cytosol causes apoptosis on its own. Thus, PNPT1 initiates apoptotic RNA decay, revealing a new pro-apoptotic role of MOMP. Previously (Thomas et al., 2015Thomas M.P. Liu X. Whangbo J. McCrossan G. Sanborn K.B. Basar E. Walch M. Lieberman J. Apoptosis triggers specific, rapid, and global mRNA decay with 3′ uridylated intermediates degraded by DIS3L2.Cell Rep. 2015; 11: 1079-1089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), we showed that even abundant poly(A) RNAs rapidly decay in apoptotic cells in a MOMP-dependent manner. mRNAs decline rapidly in STS-treated HeLa cells, but not in HeLa cells overexpressing BCL2 or deficient in BAX and BAK, which undergo MOMP-independent apoptosis. We first examined whether MOMP is required for mRNA decay in another apoptosis model—TRAIL-treated HCT116 cells in which Bax is essential for cell death (LeBlanc et al., 2002LeBlanc H. Lawrence D. Varfolomeev E. Totpal K. Morlan J. Schow P. Fong S. Schwall R. Sinicropi D. Ashkenazi A. Tumor-cell resistance to death receptor--induced apoptosis through mutational inactivation of the proapoptotic Bcl-2 homolog Bax.Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 274-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). If mRNA decay depends on MOMP, it should occur after MOMP. We therefore examined mRNA decay kinetics in HCT116 cells. MOMP, assessed by mitochondrial release of cytochrome c by immunoblot of fractionated cells, and mitochondrial depolarization by DiIC1(5) staining, were first detected 65 min after adding TRAIL (Figures 1A–1C). mRNA decay of 4 housekeeping genes was first detected 85 min after TRAIL, indicating that MOMP precedes mRNA decay (Figure 1D). Although a small number of annexin V+ cells were detected 85 min after adding TRAIL, most cells only became annexin V+ after 125 min (Figure 1E). Similar kinetics were observed in Jurkat cells treated with anti-Fas (data not shown). Thus, mRNA decay occurs early in apoptosis, but after MOMP. To verify that mRNA decay also requires MOMP in this system, we used qRT-PCR to compare the levels of four housekeeping mRNAs in TRAIL-treated HCT116 cells that overexpressed BCL2 or were transfected with a control vector. Consistent with our previous observation, BCL2 overexpression completely blocked housekeeping gene mRNA decay and inhibited apoptosis (Figure 1F). Thus, mRNA decay depended on MOMP. To examine which RNAs decay, we sequenced ribosomal RNA-depleted RNA from untreated and TRAIL-treated HCT116 cells, harvested when several housekeeping mRNAs had declined to approximately a third of their baseline levels (Figures 2A–2D). The proportion of mRNAs that declined after TRAIL treatment was significantly higher than the proportion of ncRNAs that decreased (p = 1.9e−99, chi-square test). Compared to untreated samples, 5,045 mRNAs, 44% of all expressed mRNAs, significantly decreased (false discovery rate [FDR] ≤0.1) in TRAIL-treated cells. Only 2.6% of mRNAs and 5.5% of ncRNAs were significantly upregulated by TRAIL. Many more mRNAs were downregulated than upregulated (p = 3.0e−101, multinomial test). In contrast, only 153 (12%) of expressed ncRNAs significantly declined after TRAIL treatment. Nonetheless, the proportion of significantly downregulated expressed ncRNAs was significantly more than the proportion that were upregulated (p = 5.3e−8, multinomial test), suggesting that some ncRNAs may be decayed during apoptosis. Figure 2C shows gene browser images of the RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data for 3 mRNAs (row 1), 3 poly(A) ncRNAs (row 2), and 6 non-poly(A) ncRNAs (row 3 and 4, transcribed by Pol II and III, respectively). Of note, the poly(A) ncRNAs (PKI55, RAET1K, NORAD) decayed, while the 6 non-poly(A) ncRNAs (RN7SL1, RN7SK, RNU1-3, RNU4-1, RMRP, MALAT1) did not. In many cases, decay was more pronounced at the 3′ end. Because mRNAs preferentially decayed, we wanted to know whether apoptotic RNA decay depends on translation. We compared mRNA levels by qRT-PCR for a few housekeeping genes in HCT116 cells, pretreated for 1 hr with cycloheximide, puromycin, or medium and then with TRAIL for 3 hr. The combination of TRAIL and puromycin, which causes premature chain termination, was too toxic to evaluate RNA decay, but cycloheximide pretreatment, which blocks protein translation elongation, did not inhibit TRAIL-mediated mRNA decay (Figure 2E). Pretreatment of HeLa cells with cycloheximide or puromycin also did not inhibit mRNA decay (Figure S1A). Thus, translation is not required for mRNA decay during apoptosis. We also confirmed by qRT-PCR that 4 ncRNAs whose abundance was significantly reduced in the RNA-seq experiment were degraded to a similar extent as SDHA in TRAIL-treated HCT116 cells (Figure 2F). The 5 ncRNAs that we experimentally validated that decayed during apoptosis (SNHG11, PA2G4P4, RAET1K, RP9P, SNHG1), but not the 3 ncRNAs that did not decay (28S, RPPH1, U1), in Figures 2E, 2F, and S1A were poly(A), suggesting that poly(A) ncRNAs might be decayed like mRNAs. To confirm that poly(A) RNAs decay in apoptosis, we also examined by qRT-PCR 1 mRNA, 2 poly(A) ncRNAs (SNHG11, HOTAIR) and 1 non-poly(A) ncRNA (RPPH1) in HCT116 cells treated with the killer lymphocyte cytotoxic proteins, perforin (PFN) and GzmB, which cause t-Bid-dependent MOMP and apoptosis (Sutton et al., 2000Sutton V.R. Davis J.E. Cancilla M. Johnstone R.W. Ruefli A.A. Sedelies K. Browne K.A. Trapani J.A. Initiation of apoptosis by granzyme B requires direct cleavage of bid, but not direct granzyme B-mediated caspase activation.J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1403-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) (Figure S1B). Poly(A) RNAs, but not non-poly(A) ncRNAs, decayed significantly in response to this other MOMP inducer. Because many ncRNAs are in the nucleus, we looked at whether subcellular localization affects apoptotic RNA decay in TRAIL-treated HCT116 cells. Three of four nuclear-retained poly(A) ncRNAs tested (HOTAIR, H19, LincRNA-p21, LincRNA-PINT) were not degraded, the exception being HOTAIR that also decayed after GzmB treatment (Figures S1B and S1C). We also compared the nuclear and cytoplasmic decay of 4 poly(A) ncRNAs (NORAD, DANCR, OIP5-As1, PANDAR) found in both compartments. The cytoplasmic ncRNAs declined dramatically after TRAIL, but their nuclear levels did not change significantly (Figure S1D). Thus, cytosolic poly(A) ncRNAs and mRNAs decay after MOMP, but nuclear poly(A) ncRNAs mostly do not. Moreover, translation does not determine which RNAs decay. To examine which RNA end is first digested, we compared the relative sequencing coverage of each coding and ncRNA. In both mRNAs and ncRNAs considered separately, the relative abundance of 5′ end sequences increased, while the abundance of 3′ end sequences decreased after TRAIL (Figure 2G, p = 2.7e−77 and p = 7.6e−15, respectively, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). The loss in 3′ end ncRNA coverage, although significant, was modest compared to mRNAs, presumably because poly(A) ncRNAs are a minority of the total pool. When we restricted our analysis to reads in the 3′-most exon or the last ¼ of intron-less gene transcripts, the proportion of mRNAs and ncRNAs that had significantly lower levels increased, compared to the number of reads across the entire gene body—from 44% to 51% of mRNAs and from 12% to 20% of ncRNAs. The fold change of mapped reads of all coding genes significantly decreased in the 5′-UTR, CDS, and 3′UTR, but the strongest decrease in gene body coverage with TRAIL occurred in the 3′UTR (p < e−307), followed by the CDS (p < e−263) and 5′-UTR (p < e−30), (Figure 2H, paired t test between regions, p < e−200). These data confirm our previous cRACE cloning and sequencing data (Thomas et al., 2015Thomas M.P. Liu X. Whangbo J. McCrossan G. Sanborn K.B. Basar E. Walch M. Lieberman J. Apoptosis triggers specific, rapid, and global mRNA decay with 3′ uridylated intermediates degraded by DIS3L2.Cell Rep. 2015; 11: 1079-1089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) that mRNA decay begins at the 3′ end. To investigate whether polyadenylation distinguishes the ncRNAs that decayed from the ncRNAs that did not, we separated ncRNAs based on whether or not they are poly(A), using data from a previous study of HeLa cells that measured the proportion of transcripts for each gene that contain a poly(A) tail (Yang et al., 2011Yang L. Duff M.O. Graveley B.R. Carmichael G.G. Chen L.L. Genomewide characterization of non-polyadenylated RNAs.Genome Biol. 2011; 12: R16Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), and compared the sequencing profile of ncRNAs that were mostly poly(A) (poly(A)/non-poly(A) ratio ≥2) with those that were mostly not poly(A) (poly(A)/non-poly(A) ratio ≤0.5). Focusing on decay at the 3′ end, we analyzed changes after TRAIL in coverage of the 3′-most exon or the 3′-most quarter of unspliced genes for each ncRNA (Figure 2I; Table S1). The non-poly(A) ncRNA transcripts showed little change after TRAIL, while most poly(A)-tailed ncRNAs decreased. The fold-change distributions were significantly different with respective median fold changes of 0.95 (non-poly(A) ncRNAs) and 0.64 (poly(A) ncRNAs) (Mann-Whitney U test, p = 1.7e−05). To confirm that decay was specific for poly(A) RNAs, we examined the effect of TRAIL on a Pol II-driven EGFP reporter RNA terminated by a poly(A) tail or a self-cleaving hammerhead ribozyme (HR) in HCT116 cells. Only the reporter with a poly(A) tail declined in TRAIL-treated cells (Figure 2J). Thus, TRAIL causes selective decay of mRNAs and poly(A) ncRNAs, beginning at the 3′ end. We hypothesized that MOMP initiates RNA decay by releasing a mitochondrial IMS factor. To identify such a factor, we developed an in vitro assay to test putative RNA decay triggers. First, we incubated the S100 cytosolic fraction from HCT116 cells, treated or not with TRAIL for 65 min (first detection of MOMP) or 85 min, for 30 min with in vitro transcribed and uniformly radiolabeled 5′-capped and 3′-poly(A) ACTB mRNA and control 7SL ncRNA (RN7SL1), and visualized the remaining radiolabeled RNAs on polyacrylamide gels. Cytosolic extracts from TRAIL-treated cells selectively degraded ACTB mRNA, but not 7SL, but only if cold poly(A) RNA was added (Figures 3A–3C). ACTB mRNA decay was significant at both time points, but increased with the later S100 fraction, when cytochrome c release and MOMP were greater (Figures 1A–1C and 3B). Thus, cytosol from cells undergoing MOMP selectively degrades an mRNA in vitro. Moreover, because addition of cold poly(A) RNA was needed, it is likely that a cytosolic poly(A) binding protein (PABP) inhibits mRNA decay. In fact, immunodepletion of the dominant cytosolic PABP (PABPC1) from the S100 fraction of TRAIL-treated cells caused in vitro ACTB mRNA decay in the absence of cold poly(A) RNA (Figure 3D). MOMP releases cytochrome c and dATP, which activate caspase-9. As cytochrome c is the mitochondrial factor released during MOMP most strongly known to promote apoptosis, we first tested whether cytochrome c (±dATP) might initiate apoptotic RNA decay. Although adding cytochrome c and dATP to the S100 fraction of untreated non-apoptotic HCT116 cells activated caspase-9 (Figure 3E), they did not alter RNA levels even when cold poly(A) was added (Figure 3F). To examine whether an unknown mitochondrial factor released during MOMP triggers in vitro mRNA decay, supernatants were collected from isolated HCT116 cell mitochondria treated with recombinant t-Bid (Figure 3G). As expected, the releasate from t-bid-treated mitochondria contained cytochrome c, but not VDAC (mitochondrial outer membrane) or COX IV (mitochondrial inner membrane). When the releasate was added to radiolabeled ACTB mRNA and 7SL ncRNA, only the mRNA was degraded, and decay did not require S100 or cold poly(A) RNA (Figure 3H). In fact, mRNA cleavage by the mitochondrial releasate was reduced in the presence of the nonapoptotic S100 fraction, confirming that a cytosolic protein (possibly PABPC1) inhibits mRNA decay. ACTB mRNA began to decline in vitro within 10 min of adding mitochondrial releasate (Figures 3I and 3J). These results suggest that mitochondria release an active RNase during MOMP. To begin to characterize the released RNase, we tested whether the mitochondrial releasate degraded circularized ACTB mRNA, but found it was not degraded, suggesting that the apoptotic mitochondrial RNase is an exonuclease (Figure 3K). Releasate exposure to heat, proteinase K, or phenol all blocked in vitro mRNA decay, indicating that the mitochondrial RNase is a protein (Figure 3L). The requirement for adding cold poly(A) RNA to the apoptotic S100 fraction, which was eliminated by depleting PABPC1, suggested that PABPC1 inhibits mRNA decay. This possibility led us to investigate changes in PABPC1 and mRNA polyadenylation during apoptotic decay. However, there was no gross TRAIL-induced change in the level, apparent molecular weight, isoelectric point, or cytosolic localization of PABPC1 (Figures S2A and S2B), suggesting that PABPC1 was not post-translationally modified. Next, we looked at the effect of TRAIL on loss of the poly(A) tail of 3 mRNAs and 2 poly(A) ncRNAs by comparing their PCR amplification using random hexameric 3′ primers or an oligo(dT) 3′ primer (Figure S2C). No significant change in amplification was observed for all 5 genes with either primer set until 85 min, when we first detected changes in RNA abundance. However, the binding of these transcripts to PABPC1 was significantly reduced beginning at 65 min, coincident with our first detection of MOMP (Figure S2D). By 85 min, the amount of PABPC1-bound mRNA was reduced by >80% compared to baseline values before TRAIL treatment at a time when the overall level of the transcript had only declined by ∼50% and the amount of poly(A) transcript was reduced by 60%–70%. These data suggest that mRNAs dissociate from PABPC1, perhaps providing access to the MOMP-induced 3′-exoribonuclease, before deadenylation. However, PABPC1 does not appear to be post-translationally modified, degraded, or relocalized from the cytoplasm, making it unlikely that a direct alteration of PABPC1 is responsible for reducing PABPC1 binding to RNAs about to be degraded. The IMS proteome has been defined using a peroxidase targeted to the IMS to tag its constituents (Hung et al., 2014Hung V. Zou P. Rhee H.W. Udeshi N.D. Cracan V. Svinkina T. Carr S.A. Mootha V.K.

Cell. 2014; 55: 332-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Of 127 candidate IMS proteins, only one is known to act on RNA, PNPT1, the mitochondrial polynucleotide nucleotidyltransferase, which is a 3′-5′ exoribonuclease. PNPT1 is an obvious candidate for the apoptotic RNase. We first confirmed that PNPT1 localizes to mitochondria and found that PNPT1 is released from t-bid-treated isolated mitochondria by immunoblot (Figure 4A). Antibody depletion of PNPT1, but not cytochrome c, from the t-bid-treated mitochondrial releasate blocked in vitro ACTB mRNA decay (Figure 4B), which was restored by adding excess PNPT1 (Figure 4C). PNPT1 imports chromosomally encoded RNAs needed for mitochondrial metabolism to the mitochondrial matrix (Wang et al., 2010Wang G. Chen H.W. Oktay Y. Zhang J. Allen E.L. Smith G.M. Fan K.C. Hong J.S. French S.W. McCaffery J.M. et al.PNPASE regulates RNA import into mitochondria.Cell. 2010; 142: 456-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The mitochondrial import and RNase functions of PNPT1 can be disrupted by distinct mutations. The S484A mutant lacks poly(A) polymerase and RNase activities, but functions normally in import. To determine whether PNPT1 on its own triggers mRNA decay, we added nanomolar concentrations of recombinant wild-type (WT) and RNase-defective S484A PNPT1 to the in vitro decay assay (Figures 4D and 4E). WT, but not mutant, PNPT1 degraded ACTB mRNA, but not 7SL. The kinetics of in vitro mRNA decay by recombinant PNPT1 (Figures 4F and 4G) and t-bid treated mitochondrial releasate (Figures 3I and 3J) were similar. These data suggest that MOMP-released PNPT1 initiates RNA decay. PNPT1’s IMS localization (Chen et al., 2006Chen H.W. Rainey R.N. Balatoni C.E. Dawson D.W. Troke J.J. Wasiak S. Hong J.S. McBride H.M.

Cell. 2014; 55: 332-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) is surprising because the IMS is not known to contain RNA. We first verified the mitochondrial localization of endogenous (Figure 5A) and ectopically expressed (Figure 5B) PNPT1 by visualizing PNPT1 with MitoTracker in HeLa cells by immunofluorescence microscopy. Ectopically expressed PNPT1 without its N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence (PNPT1-dSP) localized to the cytosol (Figure 5B). After STS treatment, PNPT1 translocated to the cytosol and possibly, to a lesser degree, to the nucleus (Figure 5C). Similarly, cytochrome c or PNPT1 were not detected by immunoblot in the cytosol of fractionated HCT116 cells that were untreated or exposed to TRAIL for 45 min, but both proteins were detected in the cytosol beginning 65 min after adding TRAIL and progressively increased in the cytosol over the next 40 min. (Figure 5D). To determine whether any PNPT1 traffics to the nucleus after TRAIL treatment, we separated nuclear and post-nuclear fractions of untreated and TRAIL-treated HCT116 cells and analyzed PNPT1 localization by immunoblot (Figure 5E). No PNPT1 was detected in the nucleus of untreated cells, but a faint band"

To identify targets for modification of the ECM aiming to improve drug response and overcome resistance, we analyzed expression data sets from pre-treatment patient cohorts. Cross-evaluation identified a subset of chemoresistant tumors characterized by increased expression of collagens and collagen-stabilizing enzymes. We demonstrate that strong collagen expression and stabilization sets off a vicious circle of self-propagating hypoxia, malignant signaling, and aberrant angiogenesis that can be broken by an appropriate auxiliary intervention: Interfering with collagen stabilization by inhibition of lysyl oxidases significantly enhanced response to chemotherapy in various tumor models, even in metastatic disease. Inhibition of collagen stabilization by itself can reduce or enhance tumor growth depending on the tumor type. The mechanistical basis for this behavior is the dependence of the individual tumor on nutritional supply on one hand and on high tissue stiffness for FAK signaling on the other."

https://openalex.org/W2803102992,"Biologic aging results in a chronic inflammatory condition, termed inflammaging, which establishes a risk for such age-related diseases as neurocardiovascular diseases; therefore, it is of great importance to develop rejuvenation strategies that are able to attenuate inflammaging as a means of intervention for age-related diseases. A promising rejuvenation factor that is present in young blood has been found that can make aged neurons younger; however, the component in the young blood and its mechanism of action are poorly elucidated. We assessed rejuvenation in naturally aged mice with extracellular vesicles (EVs) or exosomes extracted from young murine serum on the basis of different spectrums of microRNAs in these vesicles from young and old sera. We found that EVs extracted from young donor mouse serum, rather than EVs extracted from old donor mouse serum or non-EV supernatant extracted from young donor mouse serum, were able to attenuate inflammaging in old mice. Inflammaging is attributed to multiple factors, one of which is thymic aging-released self-reactive T cell-induced pathology. We found that the attenuation of inflammaging after treatment with EVs from young serum partially contributed to the rejuvenation of thymic aging, which is characterized by partially reversed thymic involution, enhancement of negative selection signals, and reduced autoreactions in the periphery. Our results provide evidence for understanding of the potential rejuvenation factor in the young donor serum, which holds great promise for the development of novel therapeutics to reduce morbidity and mortality caused by age-related inflammatory diseases.-Wang, W., Wang, L., Ruan, L., Oh, J., Dong, X., Zhuge, Q., Su, D.-M.

Concerningly, riverine benthic algal assemblages can become dominated by toxic cyanobacteria, threatening water quality and public health. In the Eel River in Northern California, over a dozen dog deaths have been attributed to cyanotoxin poisonings since 2000. During the summers of 2013-2015, we documented spatial and temporal patterns of cyanotoxin concentrations in the watershed, showing widespread distribution of anatoxin-a in benthic cyanobacterial mats. Solid phase adsorption toxin tracking (SPATT) samplers were deployed weekly to record dissolved microcystin and anatoxin-a levels at 10 sites throughout the watershed, and 187 Anabaena-dominated or Phormidium-dominated cyanobacterial mat samples were collected from 27 locations to measure intracellular anatoxin-a (ATX) and microcystins (MCY). Anatoxin-a levels were higher than microcystin for both SPATT (mean MCY = 0.8 and ATX = 4.8 ng g resin-1 day-1) and cyanobacterial mat samples (mean MCY = 0.074 and ATX = 1.89 μg g-1 DW). Of the benthic mats sampled, 58.9% had detectable anatoxin-a (max = 70.93 μg g-1 DW), while 37.6% had detectable microcystins (max = 2.29 μg g-1 DW). SPATT cyanotoxin levels peaked in mid-summer in warm mainstem reaches of the watershed. This is one of the first documentations of widespread anatoxin-a occurrence in benthic cyanobacterial mats in a North American watershed."

The register data comprised 962 405 singleton live and stillbirths, 898 333 (93.3%) pregnancies in mothers with neither confirmed asthma nor use of asthma medication (controls), and 26 674 (2.8%) pregnancies with confirmed maternal asthma. 71% of mothers with asthma used asthma medication. The diagnosis of asthma was based on the mothers' right for subsidised medication which is carefully evaluated by strict criteria including pulmonary function testing. Odds ratio was used in comparison. Premature birth (PB), low birth weight, small for gestational age (SGA), neonatal death were the main outcome measures.Maternal asthma was associated with adjusted odds ratios (aORs) for perinatal mortality 1.24 (95% CI 1.05 to 1.46), preterm birth 1.18 (1.11 to 1.25), low birth weight 1.29 (1.21 to 1.37), fetal growth restriction (SGA) 1.32, (1.24 to 1.40), and asphyxia 1.09 (1.02 to 1.17). Asthma treatment reduced the increased risk of preterm birth aOR 0.85 (95% CI 0.76 to 0.96) but mothers with treated asthma had higher risks of fetal growth restriction (SGA) aOR 1.26 (1.10 to 1.45), and asphyxia aOR 1.37 (1.17 to 1.61) than mothers with untreated asthma.Asthma is associated with increased risks of perinatal mortality, preterm birth, low birth weight, fetal growth restriction (SGA), and asphyxia.

The biological reason for such sequence diversity remains a topic of vigorous enquiry. Here, we demonstrate that it may be a key feature of tubulin's role in regulation of the permeability of the mitochondrial outer membrane voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC). Using recombinant yeast α/β-tubulin constructs with α-CTTs, β-CTTs, or both from various human tubulin isotypes, we probed their interactions with VDAC reconstituted into planar lipid bilayers. A comparative study of the blockage kinetics revealed that either α-CTTs or β-CTTs block the VDAC pore and that the efficiency of blockage by individual CTTs spans 2 orders of magnitude, depending on the CTT isotype. β-Tubulin constructs, notably β3, blocked VDAC most effectively. We quantitatively described these experimental results using a physical model that accounted only for the number and distribution of charges in the CTT, and not for the interactions between specific residues on the CTT and VDAC pore. Based on these results, we speculate that the effectiveness of VDAC regulation by tubulin depends on the predominant tubulin isotype in a cell.

https://openalex.org/W2804854974,"The Na/K-ATPase is an important membrane ion transporter and a signaling receptor that is essential for maintaining normal cell function. The current study examined the role of Na/K-ATPase signaling in regulating miR-29b-3p, an anti-fibrotic microRNA, in a mouse chronic kidney disease (CKD) model (5/6th partial nephrectomy or PNx). The results showed that CKD induced significant reduction of miR-29b-3p expression in the heart tissue by activation of Src and NFκB signaling in these animals. To demonstrate the role of Na/K-ATPase signaling, we also performed the PNx surgery on Na/K-ATPase α1 heterozygous (α1+/-) mice, which expresses ~40% less Na/K-ATPase α1 compared to their wild type littermates (WT) and exhibits deficiency in Na/K-ATPase signaling. We found that CKD did not significantly change the miR-29b-3p expression in heart tissue from the α1+/- animals. We also found that CKD failed to activate Src and NFκB signaling in these animals. Using isolated cardiac fibroblasts from α1+/- mice and their WT littermates, we showed that ouabain, a specific Na/K-ATPase ligand, induces decreased miR-29b-3p expression in fibroblasts isolated from WT mice, but had no effect in cells from α1+/- mice. Inhibition of NFκB by Bay11-7082 prevented ouabain-induced miR-29b-3p reduction in WT fibroblasts. To further confirm the in vivo effect of Na/K-ATPase signaling in regulation of miR-29b-3p and cardiac fibrosis in CKD animals, we used pNaKtide, a Src inhibiting peptide derived from the sequence of Na/K-ATPase, to block the activation of Na/K-ATPase signaling. The result showed that pNaKtide injection significantly increased miR-29b-3p expression and mitigated the CKD-induced cardiac fibrosis in these animals. These results clearly demonstrated that Na/K-ATPase signaling is an important mediator in CKD that regulates miR-29b-3p expression and cardiac fibrosis, which provides a novel target for regulation of miR-29b-3p in CKD. We also demonstrate that antagonizing Na/K-ATPase signaling by pNaKtide can reduce organ fibrosis through the stimulation of tissue miR-29b-3p expression."
https://openalex.org/W2804099050,"Anaemia is a condition in which the haemoglobin concentration falls below an established cut-off value due to a decrease in the number and size of red blood cells. The current study aimed (i) to assess the spatial pattern and (ii) to identify determinants related to anaemia using the third Ethiopian demographic health survey. To achieve these objectives, this study took into account the sampling weight and the clustered nature of the data. As a result, multilevel modeling has been used in the statistical analysis. The analysis included complete cases from 15,909 females, and 13,903 males. Among all subjects who agreed for hemeoglobin test, 5.22% males, and 16.60% females were anemic. In both binary and ordinal outcome modeling approaches, educational level, age, wealth index, BMI and HIV status were found to be significant predictors of anaemia prevalence. Furthermore, this study applied spatial methods to generate maps at regional level which could be useful for policy makers where great efforts should be concentrated to reduce the prevalence of anaemia. As revealed by Moran’s I test, significant spatial autocorrelation were noted across clusters. The risk of anaemia was found to vary across different regions, and higher prevalences were observed in Somali and Affar regions."
https://openalex.org/W2805012231,"Previous studies investigating to what extent students in elementary schools defend their victimized classmates typically treated defending as an individual characteristic. Defending should, however, be seen as a directed dyadic relationship between a victim and a defender, who are embedded multiple positive and negative relationships with each other and their classmates. Accordingly, in the present study defending was investigated using social network analysis. More specifically, it was investigated to what extent defending relationships co-occurred with friendship and dislike relationships involving not only the victim and the defender but also other classmates. Bivariate Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs) were used to analyze the defending-friendship and defending-dislike relationships in seven grade-three classrooms. As hypothesized, the results indicated that victimized students were likely to be defended by students who they perceive as friends or who perceive them as friends. Moreover, defending was likely to occur when the victim and (potential) defender had the same friends. Victimized students were unlikely to be defended by classmates whom they disliked or who had indicated to dislike them. Finally, defending was likely to occur between students who disliked the same classmates."

To better understand the role of thrombin–Par1 signaling in atherosclerosis, here we have studied their effects on cellular cholesterol efflux in mice. We found that by activating Par1 and cullin 3–mediated ubiquitination and degradation of ABC subfamily A member 1 (ABCA1), thrombin inhibits cholesterol efflux in both murine macrophages and smooth muscle cells. Moreover, disruption of the Par1 gene rescued ABCA1 from Western diet–induced ubiquitination and degradation and restored cholesterol efflux in apolipoprotein E–deficient (ApoE−/−) mice. Similarly, the Par1 deletion diminished diet-induced atherosclerotic lesions in the ApoE−/− mice. These observations for the first time indicate a role for thrombin–Par1 signaling in the pathogenesis of diet-induced atherosclerosis. We identify cullin 3 as a cullin-RING ubiquitin E3 ligase that mediates ABCA1 ubiquitination and degradation and thereby inhibits cholesterol efflux. Furthermore, compared with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from ApoE−/− mice, the PBMCs from ApoE−/−:Par1−/− mice exhibited decreased trafficking to inflamed arteries of Western diet–fed ApoE−/− mice. This finding suggested that besides inhibiting cholesterol efflux, thrombin–Par1 signaling also plays a role in the recruitment of leukocytes during diet-induced atherogenesis. Based on these findings, we conclude that thrombin–Par1 signaling appears to contribute to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis by impairing cholesterol efflux from cells and by recruiting leukocytes to arteries.

https://openalex.org/W2803317247,"Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) activity regulates multiple signal transduction pathways and is also a key component of the network responsible for maintaining stem cell pluripotency. Genetic deletion of Gsk-3α and Gsk-3β or inhibition of GSK-3 activity via small molecules promotes stem cell pluripotency, yet the mechanism underlying the role for GSK-3 in this process remains ambiguous. Another cellular process that has been shown to affect stem cell pluripotency is mRNA methylation (m6A). Here, we describe an intersection between these components, the regulation of m6A by GSK-3. We find that protein levels for the RNA demethylase, FTO (fat mass and obesity–associated protein), are elevated in Gsk-3α;Gsk-3β-deficient mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). FTO is normally phosphorylated by GSK-3, and MS identified the sites on FTO that are phosphorylated in a GSK-3–dependent fashion. GSK-3 phosphorylation of FTO leads to polyubiquitination, but in Gsk-3 knockout ESCs, that process is impaired, resulting in elevated levels of FTO protein. As a consequence of altered FTO protein levels, mRNAs in Gsk-3 knockout ESCs have 50% less m6A than WT ESCs, and m6A-Seq analysis reveals the specific mRNAs that have reduced m6A modifications. Taken together, we provide the first evidence for how m6A demethylation is regulated in mammalian cells and identify a putative novel mechanism by which GSK-3 activity regulates stem cell pluripotency.

One explanation that has been proposed for how m6A levels affect stem cell pluripotency is that mRNAs for several components of the core pluripotency circuitry in mouse ESCs have reduced m6A, thereby increasing the half-life of these factors (36Batista P.J. Molinie B. Wang J. Qu K. Zhang J. Li L. Bouley D.M. Lujan E. Haddad B. Daneshvar K. Carter A.C. Flynn R.A. Zhou C. Lim K.S. Dedon P. et al.m(6)A RNA modification controls cell fate transition in mammalian embryonic stem cells.Cell Stem Cell. 2014; 15 (25456834): 707-71910.1016/j.stem.2014.09.019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). Here we describe the regulation of m6A mRNA by GSK-3 in mouse ESCs. We find that FTO (fat mass and obesity–associated) protein levels are elevated in Gsk-3 DKO ESCs compared with WT ESCs, resulting in a concomitant decrease in m6A levels. The mechanism underlying this effect is shown to be the phosphorylation of FTO by GSK-3 and subsequent ubiquitination, a process that is impaired in Gsk-3 DKO ESCs. Reduced GSK-3 activity and decreased levels of m6A are both associated with promotion of pluripotency. We therefore investigated whether there was a direct connection between GSK-3 and m6A. Because stem cell pluripotency is enhanced by reduced m6A mRNA levels, an increase in FTO protein would be one route to achieving decreased m6A mRNA levels. Because the stereotypical role for GSK-3 is to negatively regulate target substrates, our hypothesis was that FTO protein levels are kept low by GSK-3 activity, and consequently, we should observe an increase in FTO protein levels in Gsk-3 DKO ESCs. We initiated our study by examining the levels of FTO protein in WT and Gsk-3 DKO ESCs grown under standard conditions (supplemented with LIF). We observed no difference in FTO protein between these cells (Fig. 1A). We then realized that, by using culture conditions containing LIF, both WT and Gsk-3 DKO ESCs would be pluripotent. Thus, adding LIF would not help us to understand how loss of GSK-3 was promoting pluripotency. It had been shown previously that Gsk-3 DKO ESCs would remain pluripotent when grown in the absence of LIF for as long as 14 days (12Doble B.W. Patel S. Wood G.A. Kockeritz L.K. Woodgett J.R. Functional redundancy of GSK-3α and GSK-3β in Wnt/β-catenin signaling shown by using an allelic series of embryonic stem cell lines.Dev. Cell. 2007; 12 (17543867): 957-97110.1016/j.devcel.2007.04.001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Under these same conditions, WT ESCs progressively differentiate. By growing ESCs without LIF, we were able to obtain conditions in which we could now assess how loss of GSK-3 promotes pluripotency. Persistence of pluripotency in Gsk-3 DKO ESCs in the absence of LIF was verified by examining mRNA levels of the pluripotency-associated genes Nanog and estrogen receptor-β (Esrrb) by qPCR. As seen in Fig. 1B, relative levels of Nanog and Esrrb mRNA remain elevated in Gsk-3 DKO ESCs compared with WT ESCs, demonstrating that even without supplementation with LIF, Gsk-3 DKO ESCs remain pluripotent. We then isolated proteins from WT and Gsk-3 DKO ESCs, separated by SDS-PAGE, and examined FTO protein levels by Western blotting. We observed substantially higher FTO protein levels in Gsk-3 DKO ESCs (Fig. 1C). We then asked whether higher FTO protein levels was due to increased levels of mRNA. qPCR analysis of FTO mRNA revealed no increase in Gsk-3 DKO ESCs, and in fact, the mRNA levels were decreased (Fig. 1D). These data suggest that the elevated levels of FTO protein seen in Gsk-3 DKO ESCs are probably due to post-transcriptional effects of GSK-3. Given that FTO is an RNA demethylase and FTO protein is elevated in Gsk-3 DKO ESCs relative to WT ESCs, we sought to quantitatively measure the amounts of m6A mRNA in ESCs by UHPLC-MS. Total RNA was isolated from WT and Gsk-3 DKO ESCs grown in the absence of LIF for 14 days. We then enriched for mRNA, which was then digested into single nucleotides. Targeted UHPLC-MS detection of individual nucleotides allowed us to calculate the relative amount of m6A, which was normalized against the total adenosine pool to correct for any differences in the amount of RNA analyzed in each experiment. Analysis revealed a 49% reduction in m6A nucleotides in Gsk-3 DKO ESCs compared with WT ESCs (Fig. 1E), consistent with the higher levels of FTO protein observed in Gsk-3 DKO ESCs. The elevation of FTO protein was not limited to Gsk-3 DKO ESCs. We extended our initial observation to WT ESCs treated with small-molecule inhibitors of GSK-3. WT ESCs were grown in the absence of LIF for 14 days and then treated with increasing doses of the GSK-3 inhibitors SB-415,286 or lithium chloride for 48 h. Examination of FTO protein by Western blotting revealed a dose-dependent increase in FTO protein (Fig. 2, A and B). These results strongly support the notion that GSK-3 inhibition, even for a short time, is sufficient to result in elevated levels of FTO protein in ESCs. Because FTO protein levels are modulated by GSK-3 activity, we hypothesized that FTO is phosphorylated by GSK-3, and a repeated GSK-3 consensus motif was found within mouse FTO (amino acids 245–257) (Fig. 3A). To test whether FTO phosphorylation occurs in mouse ESCs, we overexpressed murine V5-tagged FTO in both WT and Gsk-3 DKO ESCs. Phosphorylated proteins were enriched using a Pro-Q Diamond kit, and proteins were analyzed by Western blotting for the presence of FTO. Examination of total protein lysates revealed that FTO-V5 was expressed in both WT and Gsk-3 DKO ESCs, indicating successful transfection of cells. Analysis of phospho-enriched proteins revealed FTO-V5 in WT ESCs, but not in Gsk-3 DKO ESCs (Fig. 3B). From this experiment, we conclude that FTO is normally phosphorylated in WT ESCs, and this phosphorylation is impaired in Gsk-3 DKO ESCs. We next sought to identify the precise amino acids within FTO that are phosphorylated in WT ESCs and not in Gsk-3 DKO ESCs. ESCs were transfected with murine FLAG-tagged FTO and then immunoprecipitated, trypsinized, and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. These results definitively showed the presence of phosphorylation in the region of FTO containing the GSK-3 consensus sequences, specifically on Ser-249 and Ser-253. Collision-induced dissociation of the singly phosphorylated peptide and carbamidomethylated (M + 3H)3+ ion (1380.2174 m/z, sequence SAVAVYSYSCEGSEDESEDESSFEGRDPDTWHVGFK) generates fragment ions that suggest a mixed population of isobaric peptides that harbor phosphorylated species on at least two residues (Fig. 3C). The observed fragment ions primarily suggest a mix of phosphorylation sites on both serine residues found in the sequence ∦ EG(SEDES)ED ∦ (where the parentheses denote the amino acid motif that was found to be phosphorylated, where both serines were phosphorylated).

The same standard and scrutiny is rarely employed for the editors of the journals although COI may affect editorial decisions. Methods We conducted a retrospective observational study to determine the prevalence and magnitude of financial relationships among editors of 60 influential US medical journals (10 each for internal medicine and five subspecialties: cardiology, gastroenterology, neurology, dermatology and allergy & immunology). Open Payments database was reviewed to determine the percentage of physician editors receiving payments and the nature and amount of these payments. Findings 703 unique physician editors were included in our analysis. 320/703 (46%) received 8659 general payments totaling $8,120,562. The median number of payments per editor was 9 (IQR 3–26) and the median amount per payment was $91 (IQR $21–441). The median total payment received by each editor in one year was $4,364 (IQR $319–23,143). 152 (48%) editors received payments more than $5,000 in a year, a threshold considered significant by the National Institutes of Health. COI policies for editors were available for 34/60 (57%) journals but only 7/34 (21%) publicly reported the disclosures and only 2 (3.%) reported the dollar amount received. Interpretation A significant number of editors of internal medicine and subspecialty medical journals have financial COI and very few are publicly disclosed. Specialty journal editors have more COI compared to general medicine journal editors. Current policies for disclosing COI for editors are inconsistent and do not comply with the recommended standards."
https://openalex.org/W2804163969,"One of the most promising approaches to improve recovery after spinal cord injury (SCI) is the augmentation of spontaneously occurring plasticity in uninjured neural pathways. Acute intermittent hypoxia (AIH, brief exposures to reduced O2 levels alternating with normal O2 levels) initiates plasticity in respiratory systems and has been shown to improve recovery in respiratory and non-respiratory spinal systems after SCI in experimental animals and humans. Although the mechanism by which AIH elicits its effects after SCI are not well understood, AIH is known to alter protein expression in spinal neurons in uninjured animals. Here, we examine hypoxia- and plasticity-related protein expression using immunofluorescence in spinal neurons in SCI rats that were treated with AIH combined with motor training, a protocol which has been demonstrated to improve recovery of forelimb function in this lesion model. Specifically, we assessed protein expression in spinal neurons from animals with incomplete cervical SCI which were exposed to AIH treatment + motor training either for 1 or 7 days. AIH treatment consisted of 10 episodes of AIH: (5 min 11% O2: 5 min 21% O2) for 7 days beginning at 4 weeks post-SCI. Both 1 or 7 days of AIH treatment + motor training resulted in significantly increased expression of the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) relative to normoxia-treated controls, in neurons both proximal (cervical) and remote (lumbar) to the SCI. All other markers examined were significantly elevated in the 7 day AIH + motor training group only, at both cervical and lumbar levels. These markers included vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms of the BDNF receptor tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB). In summary, AIH induces plasticity at the cellular level after SCI by altering the expression of major plasticity- and hypoxia-related proteins at spinal regions proximal and remote to the SCI. These changes occur under the same AIH protocol which resulted in recovery of limb function in this animal model. Thus AIH, which induces plasticity in spinal circuitry, could also be an effective therapy to restore motor function after nervous system injury."
https://openalex.org/W2803154108,"Purpose The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of exercise training with modest or greater weight loss (≥3%) or not (<3%) on insulin sensitivity, lipoprotein concentrations, and lipoprotein particle size in overweight and obese participants. Methods Adults (N = 163, body mass index: 25–37 [kg/m2]) participated in 8 months of exercise training. Insulin sensitivity, lipid concentrations, lipid particle size and other cardiometabolic variables were measured at baseline and follow-up. Participants were categorized by whether they achieved at least modest weight loss (≥ 3%) or not (<3%) following the intervention. Results A greater improvement in insulin sensitivity was observed in adults performing exercise training with at least modest weight loss (2.2 mU·l-1 ·min -1, CI: 1.5 to 2.8) compared to those who did not (0.8 mU·l-1 ·min -1, CI: 0.5 to 1.2). Similar results were observed for acute insulin response, triglycerides, non-HDL cholesterol concentration, low density lipoprotein (LDL) particle size and high density lipoprotein (HDL) particle size (p<0.05), when all exercise groups were combined. No significant results across weight loss categories were observed for LDL, HDL, glucose, or insulin levels. Conclusion The present study suggests that aerobic exercise combined with at least modest weight loss leads to greater improvements in insulin sensitivity, triglycerides as well as other non-traditional lipid risk factors (non-HDL cholesterol, HDL/LDL particle size). Clinicians should advocate patients who are overweight/obese to exercise and obtain modest weight loss for improved cardiovascular benefits."

For the first time, we detected in this study the active transport of cytoophidia, taking advantage of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe as an excellent model for studying membraneless organelles. We demonstrated that actin filaments, not microtubules, are responsible for this transport. Furthermore, we determined that Myo52, a type of myosin V, is required for the active transport of cytoophidia.

The objective of this study was to examine how poverty, gender, and health system factors interact to influence women’s participation in PMTCT services. We used qualitative research, literature, and hypothesized variable connections to diagram causes and effects in causal loop models. We found that many factors, including antiretroviral therapy (ART) use, service design and quality, stigma, disclosure, spouse/partner influence, decision-making autonomy, and knowledge about PMTCT, influence psychosocial health, which in turn affects women’s participation in PMTCT services. Thus, interventions to improve psychosocial health need to address many factors to be successful. We also found that the design of PMTCT services, a modifiable factor, is important because it affects several other factors. We identified 66 feedback loops that may contribute to policy resistance—that is, a policy’s failure to have its intended effect. Our findings point to the need for a multipronged intervention to encourage women’s continued participation in PMTCT services and for longitudinal research to quantify and test our causal loop model."

Hcy-thiolactone causes protein damage, cellular toxicity, and proatherogenic changes in gene expression in human cells and tissues. A polymorphic cardio-protective enzyme, paraoxonase 1 (PON1), hydrolyzes Hcy-thiolactone in vitro. However, whether Hcy- thiolactone hydrolysis is a physiologic function of the PON1 protein and whether polymorphisms in the PON1 gene affect Hcy-thiolactone levels in humans was unknown. Here we show that the PON1–192 genotype, which affects the enzymatic activity of the PON1 protein, also affected urinary Hcy-thiolactone levels, normalized to creatinine. Carriers of the PON1–192R allele had significantly lowerHcy-thiolactone/creatinine levels than individuals carrying the PON1–192Q allele. Individuals with low serum PON1 paraoxonase activity had significantly higher Hcy- thiolactone/creatinine levels compared with individuals with high paraoxonase activity. In contrast, Hcy- thiolactone/creatinine levels were unaffected by serum PON1 arylesterase activity or by PON1 protein levels. Taken together, these findings suggest that PON1 hydrolyzes Hcy-thiolactone in humans and that the in terindividual variations in PON1 genotype/activity can modulate the pathology of hyperhomocysteinemia.—Perla-Kaján, J., Borowczyk, K., Glowacki, R., Nygard, O., Jakubowski, H.

We found decreased hepatic NAD+ concentration and downregulated biosynthesis in Bcs1lpS78G knock-in mice with respiratory chain complex III deficiency and mito chondrial hepatopathy. Aiming at ameliorating disease progression via NAD+ repletion and improved mitochon drial function, we fed these mice nicotinamide riboside (NR), a NAD+ precursor. A targeted metabolomics verified successful administration and suggested enhanced NAD+ biosynthesis in the treated mice, although hepatic NAD+ concentration was unchanged at the end point. In contrast to our expectations, NR did not improve the hepatopathy, hepatic mitochondrial respiration, or survival of Bcs1lpS78G mice. We linked this lack of therapeutic effect to NAD+-independent activation of SIRT-1 and -3 via AMPK and cAMP signaling related to the starvation-like metabolic state of Bcs1lp.S78G mice. In summary, we describe an unusual metabolic state with NAD+ depletion accompanied by energy deprivation signals, uncompromised SIRT function, and upregulated oxidative me tabolism.

In South Africa, incredibly high rates of crime and violence are noted. The country also has a very large youth population whose health, survival and development are key to economic growth. Among other efforts to encourage healthy youth development and the promotion of social activities such as sports, youth groups, choirs and so forth. This study examines the relationship between perceived community safety and the uptake of social activities among youth in South Africa.This paper uses data from the National Youth Lifestyle Survey (2008) with an unweighted sample of 4,391 youth (age12-22 years old). Using chi-square and logistic regression analysis the association between perceived community safety and social activity participation are tested.The results indicate that youth participation in social activities in South Africa is high (55% of males and 45% of females). Among males, the most prominent activity is sports (51.8%), while for females there is high participation in choir and singing groups (55.68%). More than 50% of males perceive their communities as risky while less than half of females feel the same. Male youth are more likely to participate in social activities if they perceive their communities as risky (OR = 1.04). Females (OR = 0.83), youth have a negative view of their future (OR = 0.43) are less likely to participate in social activities.There exists an association between youth's perception of community safety and their participation in social activities. Whether sports and groups are protective or enabling environments for youth from unsafe communities is moot. More in-depth research is needed on why youth participate in these clubs and groups to truly understand the role of social activities in South African societies."
https://openalex.org/W2803893193,"Intermittent water supplies (IWS) deliver piped water to one billion people; this water is often microbially contaminated. Contaminants that accumulate while IWS are depressurized are flushed into customers' homes when these systems become pressurized. In addition, during the steady-state phase of IWS, contaminants from higher-pressure sources (e.g., sewers) may continue to intrude where pipe pressure is low. To guide the operation and improvement of IWS, this paper proposes an analytic model relating supply pressure, supply duration, leakage, and the volume of intruded, potentially-contaminated, fluids present during flushing and steady-state. The proposed model suggests that increasing the supply duration may improve water quality during the flushing phase, but decrease the subsequent steady-state water quality. As such, regulators and academics should take more care in reporting if water quality samples are taken during flushing or steady-state operational conditions. Pipe leakage increases with increased supply pressure and/or duration. We propose using an equivalent orifice area (EOA) to quantify pipe quality. This provides a more stable metric for regulators and utilities tracking pipe repairs. Finally, we show that the volume of intruded fluid decreases in proportion to reductions in EOA. The proposed relationships are applied to self-reported performance indicators for IWS serving 108 million people described in the IBNET database and in the Benchmarking and Data Book of Water Utilities in India. This application shows that current high-pressure, continuous water supply targets will require extensive EOA reductions. For example, in order to achieve national targets, utilities in India will need to reduce their EOA by a median of at least 90%."

In an effort to develop a universally efficacious therapeutic strategy with limited potential for the emergence of resistance, this study was performed to investigate the effect of combinatorial RNA interference (RNAi) on inhibiting the replication of diverse influenza A virus subtypes and strains. Candidate genes were selected for targeting based on the results of multiple previous independent genome-wide studies. The effect of single and combinatorial RNAi on the replication of 12 diverse influenza A viruses, including three strains isolated from birds and one strain isolated from seals, was then evaluated in primary normal human bronchial epithelial cells. After excluding overly toxic siRNA, two siRNA combinations were identified that reduced mean viral replication by greater than 79 percent in all mammalian strains, and greater than 68 percent in all avian strains. Host-directed combinatorial RNAi effectively prevents growth of a broad range of influenza virus strains in vitro, and is a potential therapeutic candidate for further development and future in vivo studies."

Midazolam inhibited VEGF-induced elevation of intracellular Ca2+, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and transglutaminase activation in HRECs; these effects were reversed by the GABA, type A (GABAA) receptor antagonist flumazenil but not by the translocator protein antagonist PK11195. Midazolam also prevented VEGF-induced disassembly of adherens junctions and in vitro permeability. Intravitreal injection of midazolam prevented hyperglycemia-induced ROS generation, transglutaminase activa tion, and subsequent vascular leakage in the retinas of diabetic mice, and those effects were reversed by flumazenil. The roles of flumazenil were further supported by identifying GABAA receptors in mouse retinas. Thus, midazolam prevents hyperglycemia-induced vascular leakage by inhibiting VEGF-induced intracellular events in the retinas of diabetic mice.—Lee, Y.-J., Kim, M., Lee, J.-Y., Jung, S.-H., Jeon, H.-Y., Lee, S.

https://openalex.org/W2803998907,"Cancer and factor V Leiden mutation are both risk factors for venous thromboembolism (VTE). Cancer critically increases the thrombotic risk whereas Factor V Leiden is the most common pro-thrombotic mutation. The impact of the factor V Leiden on the risk of VTE in cancer patients remains uncertain.To assess the impact of factor V Leiden mutation in cancer-associated thrombosis.The EDITH hospital-based case-control study enrolled 182 patients with cancer and VTE as well as 182 control patients with cancer, matched for gender, age and cancer location, between 2000 and 2012, in the University Hospital of Brest. All cases and controls were genotyped for the factor V Leiden mutation and interviewed with a standardized questionnaire.Twenty one of 182 (11.5%) patients with cancer-associated thrombosis carried the factor V Leiden mutation and 4 of 182 (2.2%) controls with cancer but no venous thrombosis. In multivariate analysis including cancer stage and family history of VTE, cancer patients with factor V Leiden mutation had a seven-fold increased risk of venous thromboembolism (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 7.04; 95% CI, 2.01-24.63).The pro-thrombotic Factor V Leiden mutation was found to be an independent additional risk factor for venous thromboembolism in cancer patients and might therefore be considered in the individual thrombotic risk assessment."
https://openalex.org/W2803141743,"Pigeon racing is a popular sport worldwide. Pigeons are under continuous selection to improve speed, spatial orientation, and endurance during long flights. However, numerous genetic and non-genetic factors affect survivability and homing ability, making such traits difficult for breeders to control. Polymorphisms in the lactate dehydrogenase A gene (LDHA) likely affects pigeon racing and homing abilities, due to its role in physical and mental performance. Additionally, the adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide 1 gene (ADCYAP1) has been associated with physiological and behavioral shifts that occur during avian migration. In this study, we examined the association between LDHA and ADCYAP1 genotypes with pigeon survivability during racing competitions. Survivability was evaluated through the estimated breeding value (EBV) of each individual’s total race distances during its athletic life. ADCYAP1 was not polymorphic among our samples, while LDHA genotypes were significantly associated with deviated EBV values of longer total race distance; individuals carrying the S+ genotype had higher EBV (i.e., greater survivability). Thus, the LDHA locus might be useful for marker-assisted selection, empowering breeders and trainers to maximize pigeon quality. Moreover, data obtained from breeding will also improve our understanding of the genetic mechanism underlying navigation and flight for wild migrating bird species."
https://openalex.org/W2804304345,"It is common in practicing orthognathic surgery to evaluate faces with retruded or protruded chins (dysgnathic faces) using photographs. Because motion may alter how the face is perceived, we investigated the perception of faces presented via photographs and videos. Two hundred naïve raters (lay persons, without maxillo facial surgery background) evaluated 12 subjects with varying chin anatomy [so-called skeletal Class I (normal chin), Class II (retruded chin), and Class III (protruded chin)]. Starting from eight traits, with Factor analysis we found a two-Factor solution, i.e. an ""aesthetics associated traits cluster"" and a Factor ""personality traits cluster"" which appeared to be uncorrelated. Internal consistency of the Factors found for photographs and videos was excellent. Generally, female raters delivered better ratings than males, but the effect sizes were small. We analyzed differences and the respective effect magnitude between photograph and video perception. For each skeletal class the aesthetics associated dimensions were rated similarly between photographs and video clips. In contrast, specific personality traits were rated differently. Differences in the class-specific personality traits seen on photographs were ""smoothed"" in the assessment of videos, which implies that photos enhance stereotypes commonly attributed to a retruded or protruded chin."
https://openalex.org/W2804928707,"The behaviour of most animals has evolved in a communication network environment, in which signals produced by senders are perceived by many intended and unintended receivers. In this study, we tested whether the corncrake (Crex crex), a nocturnal rail species with innate (non-learned) calls, is able to eavesdrop on the interactions of conspecific males and how this eavesdropping affects subsequent responses by the eavesdropper to territorial intrusion. In the first step, simulated aggressive or neutral interactions between male dyads were presented to a focal male. In the second step, the calls of winning, losing or neutral males from the first step were played within the territory of the focal male. We measured behavioural and vocal responses of focal males. We found that corncrakes eavesdropped on signal exchange between rivals. Males often began responding to distant aggressive interactions during the eavesdropping phase, and they responded strongly during the intrusion phase of the experiments. The response was significantly weaker to playback of males from neutral interactions than to those involved in aggressive interactions, and we found no differences between the responses to Winners and Losers entering a focal male territory."
https://openalex.org/W2804422364,"Global cooperation is urgently needed to prevent risks of world-wide extreme events and disasters for sustainable development. In human societies, however, there exists bias toward interacting with partners with similar characteristics, but not contributing globally. We study how complex interactive behaviors evolve under risks through proposing a threshold public goods game model. In the model, individuals either play games with participants who own the same phenotype, or contribute to the collective target of global public goods. We further introduce an insurance compensation mechanism into the model to probe the evolution of global cooperation. It is found that the introduction of the insurance remarkably promotes the emergence of global cooperative behavior and inhibits the tendency to play games only with individuals of the same phenotype. Besides, contrary to models without insurance, global cooperation is strengthened with the increase of imitation intensities. In addition, high risk and high threshold are in favor of global cooperation."
https://openalex.org/W2951201692,"Pseudomonas syringae Lz4W RecBCD enzyme, RecBCDPs, is a trimeric protein complex comprised of RecC, RecB, and RecD subunits. RecBCD enzyme is essential for P. syringae growth at low temperature, and it protects cells from low temperature induced replication arrest. In this study, we show that the RecBCDPs enzyme displays distinct biochemical behaviors. Unlike E. coli RecBCD enzyme, the RecD subunit is indispensable for RecBCDPs function. The RecD motor activity is essential for the Chi-like fragments production in P. syringae, highlighting a distinct role for P. syringae RecD subunit in DNA repair and recombination process. Here, we demonstrate that the RecBCDPs enzyme recognizes a unique octameric DNA sequence, 5'-GCTGGCGC-3' (ChiPs) that attenuates nuclease activity of the enzyme when it enters dsDNA from the 3'-end. We propose that the reduced translocation activities manifested by motor-defective mutants cause cold sensitivity in P. syrinage; emphasizing the importance of DNA processing and recombination functions in rescuing low temperature induced replication fork arrest."

https://openalex.org/W2803837920,"“I think, therefore I am,” a famous dictum attributed to the 17th century philosopher René Descartes, is deceptively simple, yet the biology at the heart of it is so overwhelmingly complex that it boggles the mind. Cognitive thought is a fundamental aspect of human existence, and the neural underpinnings of this fascinating ability have captivated inquisitive minds for centuries. In this exciting age of modern neuroscience, great progress is being made in understanding the neurobiology of thought from cellular, molecular, developmental, evolutionary, and systems neuroscience perspectives. The brain is often considered the most complex organ. Within the brain, the cerebral cortex is the region responsible for higher thought processes. The building of the cerebral cortex is an intricate process requiring a beautifully orchestrated program where billions of neurons are generated and assembled into complex circuits at the right time and place and with the right functional specializations. While much has been learned about mammalian neurogenesis and cortex development from rodent models, there are fundamental differences between mice and humans that have made understanding uniquely human cognitive abilities challenging. The human cerebral cortex is characterized by two unique features: its unusual size relative not only to the rest of the brain, but also to overall body size, as well as its level of gyrification, or cortical folding, which is thought to increase surface area. Both of these aspects are thought to be important for higher human cognitive abilities. These limitations have prompted researchers to look beyond the mouse to understand the mechanisms at play allowing for expanded cerebral cortex size. In the past few years, our cellular and molecular understanding of human cerebral cortical neuron diversity and development has blossomed. With advances in single-cell analysis and the use of cerebral organoids, the ability to study this tissue type has become less of a barrier. A recent study from Xiaoqun Wang and colleagues utilized single-cell RNA sequencing of the developing prefrontal cortex to paint a picture of the action during early human brain development (Zhong et al., 2018Zhong S. Zhang S. Fan X. Wu Q. Yan L. Dong J. Zhang H. Li L. Sun L. Pan N. et al.A single-cell RNA-seq survey of the developmental landscape of the human prefrontal cortex.Nature. 2018; 555: 524-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). By sequencing over 2,300 cells across gestational ages 8 to 26 weeks, Zhong and colleagues not only identified numerous cell subtypes, but also tracked their developmental trajectories. Such information can serve as an important reference for understanding this critical window of neurogenesis in an area of the brain that is centrally involved in complex cognitive functions, such as personality, decision making, social behavior, and planning. Single-cell gene expression analysis from fetal cortical tissues focused on the ventricular zone and subventricular zone has also provided insights into the neural stem cell niches that give rise to the neocortex and suggest how the niche supports the expansion of the human neocortex (Pollen et al., 2015Pollen A.A. Nowakowski T.J. Chen J. Retallack H. Sandoval-Espinosa C. Nicholas C.R. Shuga J. Liu S.J. Oldham M.C. Diaz A. et al.Molecular identity of human outer radial glia during cortical development.Cell. 2015; 163: 55-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). In a study published earlier this year, Geschwind and colleagues took on mapping the gene regulatory elements involved in human cortex development (de la Torre-Ubieta et al., 2018de la Torre-Ubieta L. Stein J.L. Won H. Opland C.K. Liang D. Lu D. Geschwind D.H. The Dynamic Landscape of Open Chromatin during Human Cortical Neurogenesis.Cell. 2018; 172: 289-304.e18Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Integrating chromatin accessibility, chromatin interactions, and gene expression, they identified distal regulatory regions and found that human-gained enhancers preferentially exert control over genes expressed in outer radial glia, neural stem cells that are expanded in humans and are of particular interest in the context of neocortex expansion. By further integrating their findings with genome-wide association studies, de la Torre-Ubieta et al. connect common genetic variants associated with a number of psychiatric disorders and cognitive function with their set of cortical neurogenesis regulatory elements. While advances have been made in mining incredible amounts of molecular information from rare and precious human embryonic samples, the use of human cerebral organoids as models for cortical development is paving a path for researchers to probe human-specific neurodevelopmental questions (Lancaster et al., 2013Lancaster M.A. Renner M.

Kinney J.P. et al.Cell diversity and network dynamics in photosensitive human brain organoids.Nature. 2017; 545: 48-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar) and also to study specific diseases such as Miller-Dieker syndrome, a severe form of lissencephaly (Bershteyn et al., 2017Bershteyn M. Nowakowski T.J. Pollen A.A. Di Lullo E. Nene A. Wynshaw-Boris A. Kriegstein A.R.

An Organoid-Based Model of Cortical Development Identifies Non-Cell-Autonomous Defects in Wnt Signaling Contributing to Miller-Dieker Syndrome.Cell Rep. 2017; 19: 50-59Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). While mice may fall short in terms of modeling certain features of human cortical development, ferrets are proving to provide an attractive alternative. Because ferrets not only have cortical surface morphologies more similar to humans, but also a larger cortex and a higher diversity of neural progenitors, studies of gene function during neurogenesis in ferrets seem to more accurately reflect their potential functions in humans. An interesting example of this comes from a new study from Walsh, Bae, and colleagues (Johnson et al., 2018Johnson M.B. Sun X. Kodani A. Borges-Monroy R. Girskis K.M. Ryu S.C. Wang P.P. Patel K. Gonzalez D.M. Woo Y.M. et al.Aspm knockout ferret reveals an evolutionary mechanism governing cerebral cortical size.Nature. 2018; 556: 370-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). By disrupting in ferrets a gene called ASPM—a very common recessive microcephaly gene whose disruption in mice has little consequence—they not only recapitulated the severe microcephaly seen in humans, but could also pinpoint the neurodevelopmental dysfunction to a premature movement of a population of neural progenitor cells that are absent in mice. Moving forward, it will be thought provoking to see how clever applications of these technologies not only push forward our understanding of human cognitive abilities, but also illuminate the etiology behind a whole host of neurodevelopment disorders."
