https://openalex.org/W1589413892,"The autoxidation of oxyhemoglobin to methemoglobin, at pH 6.8, causes the co-oxidation of epinephrine to adrenochrome. Part of this co-oxidation was due to a hemoglobincatalyzed peroxidation of epinephrine and could be inhibited by catalase. The remainder of the co-oxidation of epinephrine was inhibited by superoxide dismutase. This indicates that the autoxidation of oxyhemoglobin results in the generation of superoxide radicals."
https://openalex.org/W1499391102,"Abstract The gel-liquid crystal transitions in lipid bilayers formed from synthetic dimyristoyl, dipalmitoyl and distearoyl l-α-lecithins have been studied by high sensitivity differential scanning calorimetry in dilute aqueous suspensions ranging in concentration from 0.4 to 6.6 mg ml-1. Each lipid shows two endothermic transitions, an extremely sharp main transition and a broader transition accompanied by a smaller heat absorption at a temperature 5–10° below the main transition. The enthalpy increases in the main transition are respectively 6.3, 9.7, and 10.8 kcal per mole of monomeric lipid. The main transition widths, which are not very reproducible, reach a minimum in the case of dimyristoyl lecithin of as little as 0.2° for 10% to 90% conversion, suggesting that these transitions would be truly isothermal with completely pure lipids. The apparent heat capacities of the lipids in the liquid crystal state are, with the possible exception of dipalmitoyl lecithin, no more than 5 cal deg-1 (mole of lipid)-1 larger than in the gel state, indicating that the hydrocarbon chains have much less mobility in the liquid crystalline state than in the corresponding liquid normal paraffins. This conclusion was also reached by Phillips et al. (Phillips, M. C., Williams, R. M., and Chapman, D. (1969) Chem Phys. Lipids 3, 234) on the basis of entropy comparisons."
https://openalex.org/W1483258064,"Abstract The applicability of affinity chromatography for the purification of UDP-galactose: N-acetylglucosamine galactosyltransferase has been evaluated. Three different types of specific adsorbents have been synthesized by reaction of a ligand structurally related to portions of the substrates of the transferase with cyanogen bromide-treated agarose. The synthesis of the ligands, P1-(6-amino-1-hexyl)-P2-(5'-uridine)-pyrophosphate, 6-amino-1-hexyl-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-β-d-glucopyranoside and P1-(6-amino-1-hexyl)-P2-(β-d-galactopyranosyl)pyrophosphate is described. The galactosyltransferase from bovine milk has been found to bind to two of the adsorbents and some of the parameters influencing the binding have been evaluated. The affinity of the transferase for the UDP-hexanolamine-agarose adsorbent was enhanced by manganous ions whereas the affinity was decreased by EDTA, urea, borate, or magnesium ions. The affinity of the enzyme for N-acetylglucosamine hexanolamine-agarose was enhanced considerably by UDP or UMP and was decreased by borate, urea or N-acetylglucosamine. N-Acetylglucosamine-agarose also served as an acceptor substrate for the transferase. The galactosyl pyrophosphate-agarose was found to have a low capacity and specificity of binding for the galactosyltransferase. On the basis of the properties of the adsorbents, it has been possible to purify the galactosyltransferase from bovine milk to constant specific activity soley by affinity chromatography. The enzyme from the whey of bovine milk was first adsorbed on UDP-agarose and the eluate from this adsorbent then chromatographed on either N-acetylglucosamine-agarose or α-lactalbumin-agarose. The properties of the transferase are very similar to those reported earlier although at least three species of enzyme differing slightly in molecular weight have been found. The three species are glycoproteins and their amino acid compositions are very similar. The UDP-agarose adsorbent may be useful for purification of other UDP-glycosyltransferases as shown in preliminary studies with rabbit muscle glycogen synthetase. It is also possible that other nucleotide-agarose or glycosyl-agarose adsorbents may be used together for the purification of many nucleotide-sugar transferases."
https://openalex.org/W1495146887,"Abstract Amino acid oxidation was studied in perfused hearts and incubated hemidiaphragms of rats fed ad libitum. Hearts were perfused with Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate buffer containing glucose and 0.1 mm amino acids. The addition of 1 mm octanoate to the medium markedly stimulated 14CO2 production from [1-14C]leucine, isoleucine, and valine; inhibited 14CO2 production from [1-14C]alanine, pyruvate, and α-ketoglutarate, and did not affect 14CO2 production from [14C]histidine, threonine, glutamate, ornithine, and phenylalanine. Hemidiaphragms incubated with 1 mm hexanoate or 0.1 to 1.0 mm octanoate increased the oxidation of the branched chain amino acids by 80 to 200% and decreased 14CO2 production from and pyruvate. Octanoate stimulated the oxidation of isoleucine by hemidiaphragms at isoleucine concentrations between 0.01 to 1.0 mm; when isoleucine exceeded 2 mm, octanoate became inhibitory. Octanoate stimulated the oxidation of the branched chain amino acids in the presence or absence of glucose and in the presence or absence of insulin from the medium, in diaphragms and hearts. Bovine serum albumin did not affect branched chain amino acid oxidation in the absence of added fatty acids; it inhibited the stimulatory effect of the latter. The inhibition was proportional to the albumin concentration. Palmitate and oleate (1 mm) added to albumin (15 mg per ml) stimulated branched chain amino acid oxidation by hemidiaphragms; the effect was smaller than that observed with equimolar octanoate and albumin. In hearts, no effect of 1 mm palmitate was observed. Butyrate (2 mm) did not affect branched chain amino acid oxidation by hemidiaphragms; 4 mm dl-β-OH butyrate and 4 mm acetate were inhibitory. In hearts and diaphragms, the omission of glucose from the incubation medium stimulated the oxidation of the branched chain amino acids. Pyruvate added to media containing glucose caused further inhibition of branched chain amino acid oxidation. Insulin stimulated 14CO2 production from [14C]leucine in hearts obtained from rats fasted for 48 hours and perfused without glucose. In hearts perfused with [14C]leucine, the addition of octanoate to the perfusate did not affect the tissue concentration of free leucine nor the labeling of the leucine pool. Octanoate stimulated 14CO2 production from leucine by hemidiaphragms which were preloaded with [14C]leucine, indicating stimulation of leucine oxidation beyond the transport of leucine into muscle cells. The apparent inverse relationship between the oxidation of pyruvate and that of the branched chain amino acids suggests that regulation of the latter may occur at the oxidative decarboxylation of the branched chain α-keto acids in muscles. It is suggested that regulation of branched chain amino acid catabolism in muscles may compliment the alanine cycle, and may play a role in homeostasis under conditions of limited availability of glucose (e.g. fasting) or increased utilization (e.g. exercise)."

https://openalex.org/W2057481524,"A sliding filament mechanism appears to provide the most satisfactory basis for a simple feedback mechanism for the control of bend propagation and bend initiation by flagella, and is supported by strong experimental evidence. A computer simulation of the movements of a flagellar model based on the sliding filament mechanism demonstrates that this mechanism offers a sufficient explanation for the automatic generation of flagellar bending waves. Further computer simulation studies may provide insight into questions such as the applicability of the sliding filament mechanism to the generation of the more complicated asymmetrical bending patterns of cilia, and the control of the bending pattern by interaction between several sliding filament systems within a flagellum."
https://openalex.org/W1507208022,"Abstract Lactate oxidase from Mycobacterium smegmatis forms a spectrally detectable intermediate during reaction with each of the substrates, l-lactate, β-phenyl l-lactate, l-α-hydroxy-β-methylvalerate and l-α-hydroxyisovalerate. This intermediate, while present in greater amounts during anaerobic reactions, is also seen in the course of aerobic catalysis. The intermediate formed from each substrate has a molar extinction coefficient at 540 nm of about 800 m-1 cm-1 and its rate of formation, k2, and rate of reaction with oxygen, k4, are fast enough to account for turnover. A spectrally identical intermediate can be made by mixing reduced enzyme with an excess of the corresponding keto acid. The intermediate produced by mixing reduced enzyme and pyruvate, on letting in air, forms the normal catalytic product, acetate. Free hydrogen peroxide does not react with free pyruvate at the concentrations and in the short time interval in which the enzymatic reaction occurs, thus eliminating the possibility that the pathway for acetate production includes the nonenzymatic reaction of these two substances. We conclude that the intermediate is a charge transfer complex of reduced enzyme and keto acid and that it participates in catalysis. A mechanism and rate equation are presented in which product dissociation is the rate-determining step. All experiments were performed in 0.01 m imidazole-HCl buffer, pH 7.0, because anions such as phosphate are inhibitors which distort all spectral and kinetic studies."
https://openalex.org/W2167041650,"Abstract Aldehydes, structurally related to the acyl portion of substrates, are extremely potent competitive inhibitors of papain. At pH 5.5 and 25°, approximately 1 mole of acetyl-l-phenylalanylaminoacetaldehyde is bound per mole of papain, with Ki = 4.6 x 10-8 m. Aldehydes protect the enzyme against inactivation by N-ethylmaleimide, and are presumed to form unusually stable thiohemiacetals which resemble tetrahedral intermediates in substrate hydrolysis."
https://openalex.org/W1511097185,"Abstract The purification of a lipase from skim milk is described. The enzyme had the characteristics of a lipoprotein lipase, i.e. its activity against emulsified long chain triglyceride was stimulated more than 20-fold by addition of suitable amounts of serum to the assay system and the activity was almost completely inhibited by 1 m NaCl. After an initial fractionation of the skim milk, the main purification was obtained by affinity chromatography on Sepharose 4B with covalently linked heparin. The preparation obtained was purified 5,000- to 7,000-fold. Gel electrophoresis of this preparation in urea or in sodium dodecyl sulfate revealed one major component which stained for protein and for carbohydrate and which comprised more than 80% of the total protein. The apparent minimum molecular weight of this component was 62,000 to 66,000 as determined by electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate."

https://openalex.org/W1491697070,"Abstract The proteins located on the exterior of the membrane of influenza virus can be preferentially labeled by incorporation of tritium. This incorporation is achieved by sodium borotritide reduction of the Schiff's base formed between pyridoxal phosphate and protein amino groups of purified virions. The preferential labeling is due to the inability of phosphate esters, such as pyridoxal phosphate, to penetrate cell membranes. Labeled virions remain fully infectious and retain hemagglutinating activity."

https://openalex.org/W1516876795,"Abstract The molecular size and conformation of chloroplast (ct-) DNA has been studied by renaturation kinetics and electron microscopy. Ct-DNA of buoyant density 1.698 ± 0.001 g per cm3 showed a Tm of 84° and a homogeneous melting pattern. Denatured and sheared ct-DNA renatured as a single kinetic class with no suggestion of repeating sequences. Ct-DNA is found to have a molecular weight of 95 x 106 by renaturation rate, assuming a value of 106 x 106 for T4 DNA. The lysed chloroplasts are shown to contain 37% of the total DNA in circular molecules of 37 to 42 µ. The remaining DNA is found to be in linear form ranging from 1 to 30 µ. Ct-DNA has been isolated by deproteinization and shown to contain 25% of the DNA in circular form. Supercoiled molecules constitute 30% of the circular molecules. Three per cent of the circular DNA is found in circles of dimer lengths. φX174 RF II DNA and circularized phage λ DNA have been used as internal standards, and the molecular weight of ct-DNA is calculated to be 91 x 106."
https://openalex.org/W1527612610,"Abstract Using analytical data and the results of degradation of glucose, lactate, and glutamate produced from [2-14C]pyruvate or lactate, we have estimated the pathways of carbon flow during active gluconeogenesis in the kidney cortex. This approach involves a steady state model and solution with the aid of a digital computer. By the isotopic method one can estimate the rates of pyruvate carboxylase, pyruvate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, and fumarase exchange and these are compared with rates of gluconeogenesis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. The cycle involving variations on the scheme [pyruvate → oxalacetate → phosphoenol-pyruvate → pyruvate] was measured and found to be similar to the rate of glucose synthesis, indicating that net flux through pyruvate carboxylase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase may be nearly twice the net rate of glucose formation. The rate of fumarase exchange was about four times the net rate of the tricarboxylic acid cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1536583807,"Abstract Amino acid analysis and tryptic peptide mapping indicate that the α chains of the three major hemoglobin components are significantly different, whereas either no or very slight differences were found among the β chains. The amino acid sequence of the first 28 residues of the β chain of Component I indicates that the A helix is probably the same length in both carp and human β chains. The oxygen equilibria of the isolated components, I, II and III, appear to be indistinguishable from one another. ATP enhances the normal alkaline Bohr effect of carp hemoglobin, and CO2 depresses the Bohr effect between pH 7 and 8. Cooperativity as measured by n in Hill's equation is maximal at about pH 6.5 in 0.05 m bis-(2-hydroxyethyl)-imino-tris-(hydroxymethyl)methane, 0.1 m NaCl but shifts to pH 7.5 in the presence of saturating ATP. A simple model suggests that cooperativity in carp hemoglobin may require the presence of a particular set of protonated species, the concentration of which is maximal at about pH 6.5. The model suggests that the alkaline shift in the position of this maximum in the presence of ATP may result from the preferential binding of ATP at low pH."
https://openalex.org/W2046474373,"A significant increase in shock-induced aggression occurs in the rat 4 days after an intraventricular injection of 90 micrograms of 6-hydroxydopa. Both fluorescent histology and biochemical assay demonstrate that brain norepinephrine is reduced by 90 micrograms of 6-hydroxydopa, while brain dopamine remains unaltered. This suggests that one form of aggressive behavior (shock-induced aggression) is modulated through a central noradrenergic system."
https://openalex.org/W1622861916,"Abstract Calf thymus nuclei contain a histone-binding protein which specifically deacetylates histone Fractions F2A1 and F3 by a hydrolytic cleavage of e-N-acetyllysyl residues. The protein has been purified over 500-fold by a combination of exclusion chromatography and isoelectric focusing techniques. It is acidic, as judged by its amino acid composition, and by its isoelectric point (pH 4.5). The protein contains tryptophan and is phosphorylated. Its molecular weight is estimated at 150,000 to 160,000. Histone-binding studies show that the isolated acidic protein selectively precipitates Histones F2A1 and F3, both of which are substrates for the deacetylase activity. The isolated phosphoprotein attaches to chromatin fractions in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1526675219,"Evidence is presented that four sulfhydryl residues play a critical role in the activity of pyruvate kinase. Modification of the four most reactive sulfhydryl groups by 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoate) leads to a disulfide interchange reaction in which a chemically modified but catalytically active enzyme is produced. This form, which contains 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoate in disulfide linkage to cysteine residues, is stable at low pH or in the presence of phosphoenolpyruvate and metal ions. At neutral pH and in the absence of these compounds, the thionitrobenzoate-enzyme undergoes an intramolecular disulfide interchange involving four additional but essential sulfhydryl residues to liberate thionitrobenzoate with the formation of cystine residues. The resulting form of pyruvate kinase is catalytically inactive."
https://openalex.org/W1551307101,"Abstract Trout testis maturation is characterized by the complete replacement of the histones by the protamines. During this process, the protamines are extensively modified by enzymatic phosphorylation of their seryl residues. In addition, a methionyl residue is transiently incorporated at the NH2 terminus of newly synthesized protamine. However, these modifying groups are removed by the time that spermatid maturation is complete. To study the kinetics of these transformations, trout testis cells were incubated with [3H]arginine, inorganic [32P]phosphate, and [35S]methionine for varying times and the labeled protamines were separated by starch gel electrophoresis. At least six modified bands (one methionyl-(P0M), three phosphoryl-(P1, P2, P3), and two phospho methionyl-(P1M, P2M) derivatives of unmodified protamine (P0)) were observed. Analysis of radioactivity showed that within 5 to 10 min, newly synthesized protamine (P0M) is phosphorylated to P1M and P2M. Methionine is then removed to form P1 and P2. Phosphorylation of P1 and P2 continues, and labeled arginine is found in P3 after 5 to 10 hours. Very little arginine label was seen in unmodified protamine (P0) in these in vitro studies. However, 5 to 10 days after injection of [3H]arginine, label was found in unsubstituted protamine (P0) derived from the sequential dephosphorylation of P3. These data suggest that pools of each modified species of protamine exist; molecules within a given pool are modified at random by the appropriate enzyme and become part of another pool. The phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of protamine appears to be unidirectional. The long lapse (5 to 10 days) between appearances of [3H]arginine in newly synthesized protamine (P0M) and in fully mature, unmodified protamine may be a consequence of the label having to pass through the various pools of protamine. The controlled phosphorylation of protamine may be important in the correct binding of protamine to DNA, while the dephosphorylation of protamine is related to the controlled condensation of the spermatid chromatin."

https://openalex.org/W1529264350,"Abstract The molecular weights of transcarboxylase and its constituent subunits have been determined by sedimentation equilibrium and by gel electrophoresis and the organization of the subunits has been deduced from electron micrographs. The intact enzyme (molecular weight ∼ 792,000, s20,w ∼ 18 S) presents a profile with a large central subunit to which are attached on one side three smaller peripheral subunits. The isolated central subunit (s20,w ∼ 12 S, molecular weight ∼ 360,000) presents two profiles in the electron microscope, one circular (100 A) with a central hole, the other rectangular (70 x 100 A). It dissociates further at pH 9 to give three subunits (s20,w ∼ 6 S, molecular weight ∼ 120,000) with roughly square profiles (70 x 70 A). In sodium dodecyl sulfate, it gives peptide chains of molecular weight 60,000; therefore, it is proposed that the central subunit is a trimer (symmetry C3) of the 6 S subunits each containing two peptide chains. The three smaller peripheral structures (s20,w ∼ 6 S, molecular weight ∼ 144,000) show 55 x 90 A profiles. Each consists of two metal-containing (cobalt, zinc) peptides of 60,000 molecular weight as well as two carboxyl carrier proteins (s20,w ∼ 1.3 S, molecular weight ∼ 12,000) containing biotin. Thus, transcarboxylase is made up of 18 peptides, 6 metals, and 6 biotins. The three peripheral subunits appear to be attached to the central subunit by an extended peptide chain of about 10 to 15 residues, most likely provided by the carboxyl carrier protein. The flexibility of the structure and the lability of the linkage account for the large variety of profiles observed in the electron microscope. Under mild conditions the enzyme dissociates to a modified enzyme of s20,w ∼ 16 S by loss of one of the peripheral subunits. This 16 S component resembles the silhouette of the head of Mickey Mouse in the electron microscope. The intact transcarboxylase rarely shows 3-fold symmetry but this symmetry is seen in complexes of avidin with transcarboxylase in which the central subunit is surrounded by 3 molecules of avidin alternating with the 3 peripheral subunits. The location of the avidin molecules at the ends of the long axis of the peripheral subunit suggests that the carboxyl carrier proteins are also in these positions and extend to one surface of the central subunit. Reconstitution of the transcarboxylase from the isolated central subunit and the peripheral subunit gives active enzyme with typical profiles of transcarboxylase. However, when the enzyme is dissociated in the absence of glycerol and is then reconstituted at pH 5, a new enzymatically active product (s20,w ∼ 24 S) is formed which has two sets of peripheral subunits on the opposite faces of the central subunit, suggesting that by this treatment, additional binding sites for the peripheral subunit have been exposed on the central subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1538508041,"The heats of reaction of trypsin with soybean (Kunitz), ovomucoid, and lima bean inhibitors have been measured at pH 5.0 and 10° and 25°. All the reactions were endothermic, with ΔH ranging from 8.6 Cal per mole for the lima bean inhibitor to 15.3 Cal per mole for the soybean inhibitor. Equilibrium constants for the association were calculated from the dependence of residual tryptic activity upon added inhibitor. Free energy changes ranged from -9.8 to -12.7 Cal per mole, and ΔS varied from 48 to 79 cal per mole degree. The change in heat capacity, calculated from (ΔH298 - ΔH283)/15, varied from -263 to -442 cal per mole degree. The reactions are in general characterized by large negative ΔG°, moderate positive ΔH, large positive ΔS, and moderately large -ΔCp. The thermodynamic quantities for conversion of native soybean inhibitor to its state in which the arg 64-ile 65 peptide bond is cleaved were calculated as ΔG°298 = -1400 cal per mole, ΔH298 = -4040 cal per mole, ΔS298 = -8.8 cal per mole degree, and ΔCp = -55 cal per mole degree. The results for complex formation and for conversion of native soybean inhibitor to its hydrolyzed form are thought to indicate that interactions other than those directly involved in changes in covalent bonding are thermodynamically significant."
https://openalex.org/W1624691190,"Abstract A 5'-deoxyadenosylcobalamin-agarose adsorbent has been prepared for the purification by affinity chromatography of enzymes which require 5'-deoxyadenosylcobalamin as a coenzyme. The synthesis involved the covalent attachment of cyanocobalamin to agarose through a 12 carbon chain. This hydrocarbon chain was attached to the corrin nucleus by reacting diaminododecane with cyanocobalamin e-carboxylic acid in the presence of water-soluble carbodiimide. The substituted cobalamin was then coupled to agarose activated by cyanogen bromide. The complex was reduced with chromous chloride and reacted with 5'-O-p-tolylsulfonyl-adenosine to yield the desired adsorbent. This adsorbent has been successfully used in the purification of ribonucleotide reductase from Lactobacillus leichmannii, which requires 5'-deoxyadenosylcobalamin as a coenzyme. Ribonucleotide reductase is retained by the adsorbent if it is applied in the presence of a dithiol and an allosteric effector. The enzyme is readily eluted with a solution containing only buffer and dithiol."

https://openalex.org/W2002960881,"There has been a wide and increasing defection of Roman Catholic women from the traditional teaching of their Church on the subject of birth control over the past two decades and a resulting convergence of Catholic and non-Catholic contraceptive practices. By 1970, two-thirds of all Catholic women were using methods disapproved by their Church; this figure reached three-quarters for women under age 30. Considering the fact that most of the one-quarter of young Catholic women conforming to Church teaching had never used any method, the percentage of those deviating may well reach 90 as these women grow older and the problems of fertility control become more important. Much of this increasing deviation has been among the more educated Catholics, who were formerly the most faithful adherents to Church teaching. The change between 1965 and 1970 was especially striking for Catholic women who had attended college. Perhaps the most significant finding is that the defection has been most pronounced among the women who receive Communion at least once a month. Even among this group, the majority now deviates from Church teaching on birth control; among the younger women in this group, the proportion not conforming reaches two-thirds. It seems abundantly clear that U.S. Catholics have rejected the 1968 papal encyclical's statement on birth control and that there exists a wide gulf between the behavior of most Catholic women, on the one hand, and the position of the more conservative clergy and the official stand of the Church itself, on the other. That many Catholics can continue in their other religious practices and simultaneously deviate on the issue of birth control is an interesting commentary on the process of social change. Ultimately this crisis of authority will probably be resolved by a change in official teaching, since it seems doubtful that such a major discrepancy can continue indefinitely without other repercussions. At a minimum, the cost to the Roman Catholic Church will be a loss of authority in a major area of life: that of sex and reproduction."
https://openalex.org/W2168715280,"Abstract l-Tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenases (EC 1.13.1.12), purified to homogeneity from Pseudomonas acidovorans and from rat liver, have been shown to contain as bound cofactors, 2 g atoms copper and 2 moles of heme per mole of tetrameric enzyme. Kinetic and spectral studies, utilizing the metal complexing agents diethyldithiocarbamate (Cu2+ specific), bathocuproinesulfonate (Cu+ specific), and bathophenanthrolinesulfonate (Cu+ and Fe2+ chelator), have established that copper, as well as heme, is essential for the catalytic activity of both hepatic and bacterial tryptophan oxygenases. Diethyldithiocarbamate does not inhibit the ongoing catalytic reaction but does prevent reductive activation by sodium ascorbate of aerobically aged, oxidatively inactivated tryptophan oxygenase, indicating the presence of chelatable Cu2+ only in inactive enzyme molecules. Bathocuproinesulfonate and bathophenanthrolinesulfonate inhibit the ongoing catalytic reaction, indicating the presence of chelatable Cu+ in functioning molecules of tryptophan oxygenase. Oxidatively inactivated tryptophan oxygenase contains (Cu2+)2 (ferriheme)2, and fully active tryptophan oxygenase contains (Cu+)2 (ferriheme)2. Bathocuproinesulfonate inhibits pseudomonad tryptophan oxygenase competitively with respect to l-tryptophan (Ki = 31 µm) and noncompetitively with respect to O2. Difference spectra of the bathocuproinesulfonate-pseudomonad enzyme complex versus the pseudomonad enzyme alone are indistinguishable from a bathocuproinesulfonate-Cu+ complex in solution. The bathocuproinesulfonate difference spectrum disappears in parallel with reductant independent catalytic activity as pseudomonad tryptophan oxygenase is aerobically aged in the absence of l-tryptophan. This supports the view that the catalytically active form of tryptophan oxygenase contains Cu+ and that as the enzyme develops a requirement for an exogenous reductant, such as ascorbate, the (Cu+)/(Cu+ + Cu2+) ratio decreases. Based upon these findings, a tentative catalytic mechanism is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1532250505,"Abstract Proinsulin connecting peptides (C-peptides) were isolated from the pancreas of the rat and the horse. The primary structures of the two rat peptides and the single horse peptide were determined by sequential Edman degradation. The amino acid compositions of the rat C-peptides agree with those recently reported by Sundby and Markussen ((1972) Eur. J. Biochem. 25, 147–152, 153–162), although an error was identified in the published sequences. The order of amino acid residues 19 and 20 was found to be Gly-Asp in both peptides. We have confirmed, however, the differences between the two peptides at position 8 (proline or alanine) and at position 17 (glutamic acid or glycine). The horse C-peptide differs from other C-peptides sequenced so far in lacking an acidic residue at the fifth position from the COOH-terminal end of the molecule. Although the proinsulin connecting peptides show considerable interspecies variability, several features of their primary structures appear to have been conserved."

A progesterone receptor, which has a sedimentation coefficient of about 7.6 S, was found in the cytosols but not in plasma. The receptor was dependent on in vivo estrogen. The intrinsic association constant, estimated from Scatchard plots, was about 5 x 108 m -1 when the concentration of cytosol protein was 5 mg per ml, and about 2 x 109 m -1 when the concentration was 2 mg per ml. Scatchard plots showed a maximum value of B/F at low ligand concentrations, indicating “cooperativity,” similar to that seen in plots of the estrogen receptor. Exposure of the receptor to 0.3 m KCl resulted in inactivation of binding sites rather than dissociation into 3.5 to 5.0 S subunits. There is evidence for the existence of a 5.5 to 6.0 S receptor after exposure to 0.3 m KCl which may have been derived from the 7.6 S receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2073655864,Mice given cycloheximide or saline were trained with a single trial. Electroconvulsive shock was administered to both groups at various times after training. Cycloheximide led to memory that decayed with time. Cycloheximide plus electroconvulsive shock produced complete amnesia at times when neither treatment alone produced amnesia. Only two types of processes appear to support memory storage in our study.

https://openalex.org/W1553301261,"Abstract Tentative assignment for each carbon resonance in the natural abundance high resolution carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance Fourier transform spectrum at 25.2 MHz of the biologically active cyclic octapeptides, synthetic oxytocin (43 carbons) and lysine-vasopressin (46 carbons) and the cyclic dodecapeptide bacitracin (66 carbons) has been made using a number of different techniques. The 13C assignments of the constituent amino acids were used to investigate the conformation of these cyclic peptides in aqueous solution. The chemical shift nonequivalence found for the end chain and β-substituted methyl carbons of the 3 isoleucyl residues in bacitracin may result from different chemical environments imposed by the conformation of this peptide. Furthermore, the small differences (less than 2 ppm) in chemical shifts of the cyclic peptide 13C resonances relative to the amino acids (correcting for internal peptide bond, N- and C-terminal, and pH effects) and linear peptides may also reflect the extent that 13C shifts are affected by different conformations."
https://openalex.org/W172443765,"Abstract The deoxygenation rate of hemoglobin solutions partially saturated with carbon monoxide, in the presence and absence of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) at 23° and pH 7.0 and 8.0 have been measured. When the rate is calculated over the initial 30% of the reaction, solutions containing 98% HbO2 show an increase in the rate as hemoglobin deoxygenates both at neutral and alkaline pH. Partial saturation with CO severely compromises this variation at both pH values. Indeed, for a solution containing about 15% HbO2, no variation in the rate over the initial 30% of the reaction or thereafter, is observed. These results for the initial portion of the reaction are in agreement with the earlier studies of Gibson and Roughton ((1955) Proc. Roy. Soc. London B Biol. Sci. 143, 310). The values of the deoxygenation rate constant calculated between 85 and 40% saturation (k in s-1) at pH 8.0, in the absence of 2,3-DPG, are 19.5 ± 1.0 s-1 for the 98% HbO2 condition and 14.2 ± 0.7 s-1 for the 85% HbCO-15% HbO2 case. 2,3-DPG has no significant effect on k at pH 8.0. At pH 7.0, with no 2,3-DPG, the value of k for the 98% condition is 36.0 ± 1.8 s-1, and for the 85% HbCO-15% HbO2 case, it is 17.9 ± 0.9 s-1. In the presence of a 10:1 molar ratio of 2,3-DPG to hemoglobin tetramer, the effect of partial saturation with CO is even more pronounced as evidenced by a value of 52.4 ± 2.0 s-1 for 98% HbO2 and 18.0 ± 0.8 s-1 for 85% HbCO-15% HbO2. Thus solutions containing Hb4O2(CO)3 as a major initial species show no effect of 2,3-DPG at pH 7.0. The effect of this organic phosphate on k becomes significant as the concentration of the species Hb4O4(CO)2 increases. These results support the view that there is no effect of 2,3-DPG on the release of the first oxygen from the fully liganded conformation. They also suggest that 2,3-DPG exerts its influence on the rate of removal of the second and subsequent oxygen molecules. This kinetic result is consistent with the findings of MacQuarrie and Gibson ((1971) J. Biol. Chem. 246, 5832), that a 2,3-DPG analogue dissociates from its combination with hemoglobin after the binding of the third heme ligand. Since 2,3-DPG binding is thought to be dependent on the quaternary structure of hemoglobin, these results taken together would indicate that the transition from the oxy to the deoxy quaternary structure, at pH 7.0, occurs very early in the deoxygenation process, probably with the loss of the first heme ligand from fully liganded hemoglobin."
https://openalex.org/W1514944595,"Abstract Extracts of Staphylococcus aureus contain a deoxycytidylate deaminase which is activated by deoxycytidine triphosphate and inhibited by deoxythymidine triphosphate. The rate of product formation is dependent on the square of the protein concentration, and chromatography on Sephadex columns suggests that the molecular weight of the enzyme depends on the effectors. In the presence of effectors the enzyme may tentatively be assigned a molecular weight of 60,000, whereas in their absence the molecular weight approximates 29,000. These properties suggest that 2 inactive subunits are converted to a dimer whose activity depends on the relative concentrations of the two effectors. As far as we are aware, this is the first example of an enzyme which has such readily demonstrable concentration dependent activation under assay conditions suggesting that monomer-dimer interconversions regulate its activity."
https://openalex.org/W2171203675,"Abstract The rates of O2 dissociation from hybrid-heme hemoglobin, in which one chain contains protoheme and the other chain meso- or deuteroheme, were measured at each heme site independently of changes at the partner chain site taking advantage of the differences in spectra between the two hemes in tetramers. The rates of O2 dissociation from hemoglobins and isolated chains containing unnatural hemes were also determined. The reaction corresponded to a first order process. The tetrameric hemoglobins dissociated O2 more rapidly than isolated chains containing the corresponding heme, and the O2 dissociation rates for isolated α chains were always greater than those for the corresponding β chains. In hybrid-heme tetramers, however, dissociation rate constants for α chains were equal to or smaller than those for β chains. In the hybrid α-proto:β-meso, protochains in their isolated state having O2 dissociation rate constants more than twice as great as those of the isolated mesochains, the velocity constants for O2 dissociation from both hemes were approximately equal, and in the α-meso: β-proto hybrid β-protoheme dissociated O2 more rapidly than α-mesoheme. These results suggest that as a consequence of subunit interactions β chains in a tetramer dissociate O2 more rapidly than in the isolated state and also more rapidly than the α chains in the same molecule, and each type of chain in a tetramer dissociates O2 independently following a simple first order process with its own rate constant."
https://openalex.org/W1494739438,"Abstract A protected linear polypeptide of 74 amino acids with the sequence of Escherichia coli 1 to 74 apo-acyl carrier protein (ACP) was synthesized by the automated solid phase method. The polypeptide was removed from the solid support and partially deprotected by treatment of the peptide-resin with hydrogen bromide and trifluoroacetic acid, and the product was purified by gel filtration. The removal of protecting groups was completed by hydrogenation, and the prosthetic group, 4'-phosphopantetheine, was introduced enzymatically with holo-ACP synthetase. Ion exchange chromatography of the product yielded a preparation in which 55% of the protein in the purified fraction contained the prosthetic group. This synthetic 1 to 74 holo-ACP was as active as native holo-ACP in the malonyl pantetheine-CO2 exchange reaction which is dependent upon malonyl-coenzyme A-ACP transacylase and β-ketoacyl-ACP synthetase. The purified synthetic 1 to 74 holo-ACP preparation was found to be homogeneous and similar to native 1 to 74 holo-ACP as judged by co-chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and Sephadex G-50 and by sodium dodecyl sulfate disc gel electrophoresis. In addition the synthetic and native proteins were similar with respect to their ultraviolet spectra, amino acid compositions, and their immunological activity with antiserum prepared against native ACP."

The reduced enzyme can be selectively alkylated with iodo[14C2]acetate. A single radioactive peptide is found in the tryptic digest of this material, with the following amino acid composition: Cys(Cm), 1; Asp, 2; Glu, 1; Gly, 2; Ala, 1; Leu, 2; Ile, 1; Ser, 2; Thr, 1; Pro, 1; His, 2; and Arg, 1. Four moles of the peptide are recovered per mole of tetrameric enzyme (molecular weight 215,000). This result suggests that the tetrameric enzyme is composed of four very similar or identical polypeptide chains."

https://openalex.org/W1588027155,"Abstract The affinity constant (Ka) and stoichiometry of binding of 4-pyridoxic acid 5'-phosphate (4-pyridoxic-5'-P) complexed to the protein bovine serum albumin and aspartate aminotransferase were investigated by fluorometric methods. Whereas bovine serum albumin binds 1 mole of 4-pyridoxic-5'-P per mole of protein with a Ka = 4.6 x 105 m-1, the enzyme, aspartate aminotransferase, binds 2 moles of 4-pyridoxic-5'-P per mole of protein with a Ka = 1.3 x 106 m-1 at neutral pH. The spectroscopic properties (absorption and fluorescence spectra) of the complexes were examined over a wide range of pH values. At neutral pH, the formation of the 4-pyridoxic-5'-P bovine serum albumin complex causes the following spectroscopic changes in the ligand: (a) a red shift of 15 nm in the band position of the emission spectrum, (b) an increase in the degree of polarization of fluorescence (P = 0.32), (c) an enhancement of the fluorescence lifetime (τ = 12 ns), and (d) a small blue shift of approximately 2 nm in the band position of the absorption spectrum. In contrast to the protein bovine serum albumin, the apotransaminase causes a blue shift of approximately 10 nm in the band position of the emission spectrum and a concurrent decrease in the fluorescence quantum yield of the ligand (q = 0.05). No change in the band position of the absorption spectrum of the complexed ligand was detected. The fluorescence changes observed in 4-pyridoxic-5'-P bound to the aminotransferase can be correlated with the deprotonation of the pyridine nitrogen atom as a result of its interaction with an amino acid residue at the binding site."
https://openalex.org/W1544122490,"Abstract A cell-free enzyme preparation has been obtained from the endosperm of germinating seeds of Pinus pinea which is capable of converting mevalonate to 24-methylenecycloartanol. The intermediates, squalene and cycloartenol, were also identified, but lanosterol, its 24-methylene analog, 4-monomethyl, and 4-desmethyl sterols were not formed. Since the enzymatic apparatus for opening the 9, 19-cyclo grouping and for demethylation at C-4 were absent, an experimental block following cyclization and introduction of the methylene group was provided. The absence of Δ8 compounds thus implies that the endosperm does not contain a squalene oxide to lanosterol cyclase. From this information we tentatively conclude that endosperm tissue, which is not functionally photosynthetic, biosynthesizes sterols through cycloartenol rather than lanosterol. This suggests in turn that the entirety of a photosynthetic organism, rather than just photosynthetic tissue, operates the steroid pathway through the cycloartenol route."

The protrusion enlarged as the gamont cytoplasm and nucleus moved into the protruded area. During movement, macrogamonts had an elongate shape. The body of the gamont was constricted as it moved through the cell cytoplasm or from one cell to an adjacent one. After movement had ceased, the gamont resumed its ovoid or spheroidal shape."

The incorporation of the 14C into the total crude nonsaponifiable residue was of the order of 0.05% of the administered 14C. In all experiments the 3H:14C ratio of the cholesterol was 3 to 4 times higher than that of the 5α-cholest-7-en-3β-ol isolated from the same animals. An enrichment of tritium in the cholesterol isolated from normal animals was noted. Thus, while the cholesterol isolated from tumor-bearing animals had a 3H:14C ratio similar to that of the administered methionine, the 3H:14C ratio of the cholesterol from normal rats was about 50% higher."

Tryptic digests of these products, labeled with a mixture of 15 l-U-14C-amino acids, and authentic α- or β-globin were fingerprinted together. Comparison of authentic marker peptides, located by ninhydrin, and those directed by the mouse globin mRNA, located by autoradiography, demonstrates that most, if not all, of the tryptic peptides are synthesized, the NH2-terminal peptides lack methionine and the COOH-terminal peptides are terminated correctly. Thus, mouse reticulocyte 9 S RNA contains α- and β-globin mRNAs which are translated by both mammalian and avian cell lysates with a high degree of fidelity."
