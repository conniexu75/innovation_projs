https://openalex.org/W2300762239,"LC3s (MAP1-LC3A, B and C) are structural proteins of autophagosomal membranes, widely used as biomarkers of autophagy. Whether these three LC3 proteins have a similar biological role in autophagy remains obscure. We examine in parallel the subcellular expression patterns of the three LC3 proteins in a panel of human cancer cell lines, as well as in normal MRC5 fibroblasts and HUVEC, using confocal microscopy and western blot analysis of cell fractions. In the cytoplasm, there was a minimal co-localization between LC3A, B and C staining, suggesting that the relevant autophagosomes are formed by only one out of the three LC3 proteins. LC3A showed a perinuclear and nuclear localization, while LC3B was equally distributed throughout the cytoplasm and localized in the nucleolar regions. LC3C was located in the cytoplasm and strongly in the nuclei (excluding nucleoli), where it extensively co-localized with the LC3A and the Beclin-1 autophagy initiating protein. Beclin 1 is known to contain a nuclear trafficking signal. Blocking nuclear export function by Leptomycin B resulted in nuclear accumulation of all LC3 and Beclin-1 proteins, while Ivermectin that blocks nuclear import showed reduction of accumulation, but not in all cell lines. Since endogenous LC3 proteins are used as major markers of autophagy in clinical studies and cell lines, it is essential to check the specificity of the antibodies used, as the kinetics of these molecules are not identical and may have distinct biological roles. The distinct subcellular expression patterns of LC3s provide a basis for further studies."

Important roles for autophagy have been elucidated for cell survival during nutrient insufficiency, eradication of intracellular pathogens, and counteracting aging through clearance of senescent proteins and mitochondria. Autophagic vesicles become decorated with LC3, a protein that mediates their fusion with lysosomes. LC3 is a substrate of the cysteine protease ATG4B (Autophagin-1), where cleavage generates a C-terminal glycine required for LC3 conjugation to lipids in autophagosomes. ATG4B both cleaves pro-LC3 and also hydrolyzes lipids from cleaved LC3. We show here that phosphorylation of ATG4B at Ser-383 and Ser-392 increases its hydrolyase activity as measured using LC3 as a substrate. Reconstituting atg4b−/− cells with phosphorylation-deficient ATG4B showed a role of ATG4B phosphorylation in LC3 delipidation and autophagic flux, thus demonstrating that the cellular activity of ATG4B is modulated by phosphorylation. Proteolytic conversion of pro-LC3 to LC3-I was not significantly impacted by ATG4B phosphorylation in cells. Phosphorylation-deficient ATG4B also showed reduced interactions with the lipid-conjugated LC3 but not unconjugated LC3. Taken together, these findings demonstrate a role for Ser-383 and Ser-392 phosphorylation of ATG4B in control of autophagy.

Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved catabolic pathway within all eukaryotic cells that plays a critical housekeeping function to remove senescent or damaged proteins and organelles through lysosome-mediated degradation. Autophagy also plays roles in generating substrates for maintaining cellular energy during times of nutrient insufficiency and hypoxia and in host defenses against intracellular pathogens (1Levine B. Klionsky D.J. Development by self-digestion: molecular mechanisms and biological functions of autophagy.Dev. Cell. 2004; 6: 463-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3189) Google Scholar). The hallmark of autophagy is the generation of cytoplasmic double-membrane vesicles, termed autophagosomes, which emerge from intracellular membranes (probably the endoplasmic reticulum), engulf cytoplasmic macromolecules, and then fuse with lysosomes to achieve degradation of the contents. Genetic studies of yeast have identified more than 30 autophagy-related (ATG) 3The abbreviations used are: ATGautophaginCIPcalf intestinal alkaline phosphatasePSphosphatase inhibitorPEphosphatidylethanolamineARHaplasia Ras homolog. genes that are required for this process (2Yang Z. Klionsky D.J. Eaten alive: a history of macroautophagy.Nature Cell Biol. 2010; 12: 814-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (1636) Google Scholar). Among the core autophagy machinery of yeast is an ubiquitin-like conjugation network called the Atg8 system that is essential for autophagosome formation (3Ichimura Y. Kirisako T. Takao T. Satomi Y. Shimonishi Y. Ishihara N. Mizushima N. Tanida I. Kominami E. Ohsumi M. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. A ubiquitin-like system mediates protein lipidation.Nature. 2000; 408: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1504) Google Scholar). The Atg8 protein is synthesized as a cytoplasmic precursor that is cleaved near its C terminus by the cysteine proteinase Atg4 to generate an exposed C-terminal glycine, which becomes conjugated to membrane-bound phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), an event that is important for completion of the autophagosome (3Ichimura Y.

Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 263-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). This reaction is catalyzed by the sequential actions of Atg7 (E1-like activating enzyme), Atg3 (E2-like conjugation enzyme) and the Atg12—Atg5-Atg16 complex (E3-like ligase) (3Ichimura Y. Kirisako T.

Importantly, Atg8-PE is also deconjugated by the protease Atg4, facilitating the release and recycling of Atg8 from membranes. This deconjugation process is also essential for normal autophagy (4Kirisako T. Ichimura Y. Okada H. Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Yoshimori T. Ohsumi M. Takao T. Noda T. Ohsumi Y.

Thus, Atg4 plays dual roles in the progression of autophagy through the irreversible (proteolytic cleavage) and reversible (lipid deconjugation) modification of Atg8. autophagin calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase phosphatase inhibitor phosphatidylethanolamine aplasia Ras homolog. The Atg8 modification system is well conserved in higher eukaryotes. In mammals, at least 6 orthologs of yeast Atg8 have been identified, belonging to two subfamilies known as the light chain 3 (LC3) and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-receptor-associated protein (GABARAP) proteins, all of which have been shown to participate in autophagy (7Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Yamamoto A. Oshitani-Okamoto S. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. LC3, GABARAP and GATE16 localize to autophagosomal membrane depending on form-II formation.J.

LC3 and GATE-16/GABARAP subfamilies are both essential yet act differently in autophagosome biogenesis.EMBO J. 2010; 29: 1792-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Similar to the Atg8 system in yeast, the C-terminal peptide of LC3 is cleaved by mammalian Atg4 homologues (9Hemelaar J. Lelyveld V.S. Kessler B.M. Ploegh H.L. A single protease, Apg4B, is specific for the autophagy-related ubiquitin-like proteins GATE-16, MAP1-LC3, GABARAP, and Apg8L.J. Biol.

The proteolytically processed form, called LC3-I, has a glycine residue at its C terminus and resides in the cytosol. LC3-I is further modified to LC3-II, which is analogous to the PE-conjugated form in the Atg8 system (7Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Yamamoto A. Oshitani-Okamoto S. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T.

LC3, a mammalian homologue of yeast Apg8p, is localized in autophagosome membranes after processing.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5720-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (5433) Google Scholar). To date, four human homologues of yeast Atg4 have been identified: ATG4A, ATG4B, ATG4C, and ATG4D (12Mariño G. Uría J.A. Puente X.S. Quesada V. Bordallo J. López-Otin C. Human autophagins, a family of cysteine proteinases potentially implicated in cell degradation by autophagy.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3671-3678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), also known as autophagins-1, -2, -3, and -4. Among them, ATG4B (autophagin-1) has broad specificity for almost all of the mammalian Atg8 homologues and is the sole enzyme reported to efficiently cleave LC3 precursors and to deconjugate lipid from LC3-PE (7Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Yamamoto A. Oshitani-Okamoto S. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. LC3, GABARAP and GATE16 localize to autophagosomal membrane depending on form-II formation.J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2805-2812Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar). Of the four autophagins identified, ATG4B (autophagin-1) shows the highest catalytic efficiency for cleaving the C terminus of LC3B (13Li M. Hou Y. Wang J. Chen X. Shao Z.M. Yin X.M. Kinetics comparisons of mammalian Atg4 homologues indicate selective preferences toward diverse Atg8 substrates.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 7327-7338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Moreover, atg4b−/− mice showed a clear reduction in basal- and starvation-induced autophagy in all tissues, associated with impaired proteolytic cleavage of LC3 orthologs (14Mariño G. Fernández A.F. Cabrera S. Lundberg Y.W. Cabanillas R. Rodríguez F. Salvador-Montoliu N. Vega J.A. Germanà A. Fueyo A. Freije J.M. López-Otin C. Autophagy is essential for mouse sense of balance.J. Clin. Invest. 2010; 120: 2331-2344Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). ATG4B is regulated in a manner that has concomitant effects on LC3 processing. Forced expression of ATG4B has been shown to reduce the amount of cellular lipidated LC3 (LC3-II), and co-expression of ATG4B with LC3 under nutrient depletion conditions reduces the punctate localization pattern of LC3, consistent with removal from autophagic vesicles (7Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Yamamoto A. Oshitani-Okamoto S. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. LC3, GABARAP and GATE16 localize to autophagosomal membrane depending on form-II formation.J.

However, increased LC3-II does not translate to increased autophagic flux (15Tanida I. Sou Y.S. Ezaki J. Minematsu-Ikeguchi N. Ueno T. Kominami E.

Autophagy proteins regulate ERK phosphorylation.Nature Commun. 2013; 42799Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), because ATG4B deficiency also inhibits proteolytic processing of LC3 paralogues and thereby hampers autophagy (14Mariño G. Fernández A.F. Cabrera S. Lundberg Y.W. Cabanillas R. Rodríguez F. Salvador-Montoliu N. Vega J.A. Germanà A. Fueyo A. Freije J.M. López-Otin C. Autophagy is essential for mouse sense of balance.J.

Noda T. Yoshimori T. Atg4B(C74A) hampers autophagosome closure: a useful protein for inhibiting autophagy.Autophagy. 2009; 5: 88-89Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In embryonic stem cells, ATG4B overexpression resulted in an increase of LC3-I, which was attributed to LC3-II deconjugation (7Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Yamamoto A. Oshitani-Okamoto S. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. LC3, GABARAP and GATE16 localize to autophagosomal membrane depending on form-II formation.J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2805-2812Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar), whereas up-regulating ATG4B by aplasia Ras homolog member I (ARH1) or stabilizing ATG4B protein levels by inactivation of the E3 ligase RNF5 was associated with increased LC3 processing (19Lu Z.

Regulation of ATG4B stability by RNF5 limits basal levels of autophagy and influences susceptibility to bacterial infection.PLoS genetics. 2012; 8e1003007Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Collectively, these observations indicate a convoluted and critical role for ATG4B in the mechanisms that control autophagy. Little is known about the molecular events that govern ATG4B activity in cells. Several studies have highlighted the complex regulation of ATG4B activity at the level of transcription as well as post-translational modifications. For example, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPβ) specifically promotes autophagy through transactivation of the expression of ATG4B (21Guo L. Huang J.X. Liu Y. Li X. Zhou S.R. Qian S.W. Liu Y. Zhu H. Huang H.Y. Dang Y.J. Tang Q.Q. Transactivation of Atg4b by C/EBPbeta promotes autophagy to facilitate adipogenesis.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2013; 33: 3180-3190Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In addition, the oxidation of cysteine residues of ATG4B reduces its deconjugating activity toward LC3-PE, and this mechanism has been proposed as a signaling switch for ATG4B inactivation (22Scherz-Shouval R. Shvets E. Fass E. Shorer H. Gil L. Elazar Z. Reactive oxygen species are essential for autophagy and specifically regulate the activity of Atg4.EMBO J. 2007; 26: 1749-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (1648) Google Scholar). Moreover, several large-scale phosphoproteomics studies have suggested that ATG4B is phosphorylated at Ser-34 (23Dai J. Jin W.H. Sheng Q.H. Shieh C.H. Wu J.R. Zeng R. Protein phosphorylation and expression profiling by Yin-yang multidimensional liquid chromatography (Yin-yang MDLC) mass spectrometry.J. Proteome Res. 2007; 6: 250-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), Ser-383, and Ser-392 (24Olsen J.V. Blagoev B. Gnad F. Macek B. Kumar C. Mortensen P. Mann M.

PHOSIDA (phosphorylation site database): management, structural and evolutionary investigation, and prediction of phosphosites.Genome Biol. 2007; 8: R250Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). However, to date, no evidence has clearly shown the functional significance of ATG4B phosphorylation. Here, we investigated ATG4B phosphorylation and its effect on the relationship between ATG4B activity and LC3 processing. Our studies demonstrate that phosphorylation of ATG4B is required for optimal LC3-directed protease activity and that ATG4B phosphorylation correlates with autophagy induction. We identified two conserved serine residues, Ser-383 and Ser-392, essential for ATG4B phosphoregulation. Moreover, further analyses revealed that phosphorylation of ATG4B regulates LC3 lipidation in cells, and thereby modulates autophagic flux. The plasmids pcDNA3 expressing Flag-ATG4B WT and Flag-ATG4B C74A mutant were previously reported (27Shu C.W. Drag M. Bekes M. Zhai D. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. Synthetic substrates for measuring activity of autophagy proteases: autophagins (Atg4).Autophagy. 2010; 6: 936-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The cDNAs encoding WT ATG4B and C74A mutant were further subcloned into pNTAP-B (Stratagene, 240103) to fuse the TAP tag. Flag-ATG4B WT and Flag-ATG4B C74A were also subcloned into pCDH (System Biosciences, CD520A-1). To create ATG4B mutants, site-directed mutagenesis was performed following Stratagene QuickChange kit instructions and specificity of mutagenesis was confirmed by direct sequencing. The plasmids encoding substrate reporters of intracellular proteolysis based on non-conventional secretion of Gaussia luciferase actin-dNGLUC and actin-LC3B-dNGLUC in a pLKO vector were a gift from Dr. Brian Seed (Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA). Firefly luciferase (LUC2) was cloned into a pcDNA3 vector. The plasmids pEGFP-LC3 and HA-p62 were described previously (11Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Ueno T. Yamamoto A. Kirisako T. Noda T. Kominami E.

The EGFP-LC3 plasmid was also subcloned into pWZL Hygro (Addgene, plasmid 18750). Lentivirus-based shRNAs of ATG4B were purchased from Sigma validated MISSION shRNA. Primary ATG4B knock-out MEFs were generated from matings of ATG4B heterozygous mice generously provided by Dr. Carlos López-Otín (14Mariño G. Fernández A.F. Cabrera S. Lundberg Y.W. Cabanillas R.

The atg4b+/+ and atg4b−/− MEFs were stably infected with either pCDH-GFP control, pCDH-Flag-ATG4B WT, deletion or phosphorylation mutants in the pLKO.1 lentiviral background. Lentiviral particles were produced by cotransfection with psPAX2 and pMD2.G plasmids into HEK293T cells. Viral supernatants were collected from 48 to 60 h and cleared through a 0.45-μm filter and applied every 12 h on target cells for three rounds. Polybrene (4 μg/ml; Sigma) was supplemented into viral supernatants. After final infection, stable populations were obtained by selection with 2 μg/ml puromycin (Invitrogen). The atg4b+/+ and atg4b−/− MEFs stably expressing various Flag-ATG4B constructs or control were then infected with retroviral particles expressing GFP-LC3 generated by transfection of pWZL-EGFP-LC3 into Phoenix packaging cell lines. Following the same infection procedure described above for lentiviral particles, cells were then selected with 2 μg/ml puromycin and 250 μg/ml hygromycin (Invitrogen). Polyclonal populations were screened to identify WT and mutant lines with similar levels of ATG4B and GFP-LC3 expression. Immortalized MEFs were cultured in high-glucose DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS (Hyclone), 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 IU penicillin, 55 μm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1 mm non-essential amino acids. Hanks' Balanced Salt Solutions (HBSS) was purchased from Gibco (Life Technologies). HEK293T, HeLa, and MCF7 cells were grown in similar media omitting the β-mercaptoethanol. Medium was replenished the night before starvation experiments. Rabbit polyclonal anti-ATG4B, -LC3B, and anti-Flag M2 antibodies were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP and anti-p62 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Protein A/G affinity, anti-Flag M2 gels, and 3×Flag peptides were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. 2-(6-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino) hexanoyl-1-hexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (NBD-C6-HPC) was purchased from Invitrogen. Plasmid expressing LC3-PLA2 was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3, Invitrogen, C6010-03). The proteins were induced and purified as previously described (27Shu C.W. Drag M. Bekes M. Zhai D. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. Synthetic substrates for measuring activity of autophagy proteases: autophagins (Atg4).Autophagy. 2010; 6: 936-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). For TAP-tagged ATG4B protein purification, HEK-293T cells transiently expressing human Atg4B with N-terminal affinity tags, including Streptavidin and Calmodulin binding peptide, were pelleted by centrifugation at 3000 × g and TAP-tagged ATG4B protein was purified using the manufacturer's protocol (InterPlay Mammalian TAP System by Agilent Technologies). For Flag-tagged ATG4B protein purification, HEK293T cells (∼107) transfected with expression plasmids (pcDNA3-FLAG ATG4B WT or catalytic mutant C74A) were harvested and washed with PBS once, then resuspended in 500 μl of lysis buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MgCl, 5% Glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm PMSF, and 1 mm DTT on ice followed by sonication 2 × 2 s to fracture cells. Lysates were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 15 min and 250 μg of supernatant proteins were used for immunoprecipitation using anti-Flag M2 gel following the manufacturer's protocol. After washing with PBS 3∼4 times, Flag-tagged Atg4B was eluted using 25 μg of 3×Flag peptides. Purified TAP-tagged or Flag-tagged ATG4B proteins were treated with alkaline phosphatase (CIP, 0.5 units, New England Biolabs) with or without phosphatase inhibitor mixture (PhosSTOP, Roche Applied Bioscience) at 37 °C for 1 h, followed by in vitro ATG4B protease assay or immunoblotting. Atg4B activity was measured with 890 nm LC3B-PLA2 fusion protein in 20 μl of PLA2 reaction buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 20 μm NBD-C6-HPC (Invitrogen). Fluorescence intensity was measured within 80 min using an AnalystTM HT (Molecular Devices Corp) at room temperature with excitation and emission wavelength of 485 and 530, respectively (27Shu C.W.

Synthetic substrates for measuring activity of autophagy proteases: autophagins (Atg4).Autophagy. 2010; 6: 936-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Cellular ATG4B activity was assayed by measuring the cellular release of an N-terminally deleted form of Gaussia luciferase (dNGLUC) as described by Ketteler et al. (29Ketteler R. Sun Z. Kovacs K.F. He W.W. Seed B. A pathway sensor for genome-wide screens of intracellular proteolytic cleavage.Genome Biol. 2008; 9: R64Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Briefly, MEFs were seeded in 24-well plates and co-transfected with 200 ng of plasmid expressing the appropriate actin-LC3B-dNGLUC (or actin-dNGLUC control) and 50 ng of plasmid expressing Firefly luciferase (LUC2, as normalization control). Transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the standard protocol. After 48 h, the Renilla luciferase and Firefly luciferase assays were carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions for the dual luciferase reporter assay system and the Firefly luciferase assay system, respectively (Promega). For co-immunoprecipitation studies, cell lysates were prepared in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MgCl, 5% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm PMSF, and 1 mm DTT) containing protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Bioscience) and phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Cellular debris were removed and the supernatants were incubated with antibody for 2 h and then incubated with protein A/G affinity gels for either 2 h or overnight at 4 °C. Beads were washed three times with lysis buffer and the captured proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE. For evaluation of cellular proteins, cell lysates were prepared using RIPA buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate 0.1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA) containing protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Bioscience) and phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Equal amounts of lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Blots were probed using the indicated primary antibodies. The band intensities were quantified by Image J (National Institutes of Health). Calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (CIP, New England Biolabs) with or without phosphatase stop (PS) were added to beads and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, followed by heat inactivation for 30 min and analyzed by immunoblotting. For Phos-tag experiments, we followed the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 10% SDS-PAGE gels were prepared using Phos-tag acrylamide (50 μm) and an equal volume of 10 mm MnCl2. After electrophoresis, the samples were transferred to PVDF membranes and washed with 10 mm EDTA, followed by immunoblotting analysis. To determine whether the cysteine protease ATG4B is phosphorylated in cells, we expressed functional ATG4B tagged with Flag peptide in HEK293T cells. The Flag-ATG4B protein was recovered from cells by anti-Flag antibody immunoprecipitation and its mobility was assessed using both conventional and Phos-tag SDS-PAGE by immunoblotting with anti-ATG4B antibody. By Phos-tag analysis, we observed two distinct bands corresponding to Flag-ATG4B (Fig. 1, A and B). Phosphatase treatment of transfected HEK293T cell lysates abolished the upper band, leaving a single band that was cross-reactive with both anti-ATG4B and anti-Flag epitope tag antibodies (Fig. 1, A and B). Moreover, co-treatment with phosphatase and chemical phosphatase inhibitor prevented the loss of the upper band (Fig. 1B). These results indicate that ATG4B protein is present in both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms in mammalian cells under normal culture conditions. We sought to determine whether phosphorylation of ATG4B modulates its protease activity. To assess ATG4B catalytic activity we turned to a novel and quantitative assay developed previously in our laboratory, involving a synthetic substrate comprised of LC3B fused to the N terminus of phospholipase A2 (LC3B-PLA2). Upon cleavage by ATG4B, active PLA2 is released for fluorogenic assay (27Shu C.W. Drag M. Bekes M. Zhai D. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. Synthetic substrates for measuring activity of autophagy proteases: autophagins (Atg4).Autophagy. 2010; 6: 936-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We overexpressed TAP-tagged ATG4B (either wild-type or a catalytic site cysteine→alanine mutant) under the control of the constitutive CMV promoter in HEK293T cells. The purified fraction from calmodulin-Sepharose affinity chromatography containing both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms of TAP-tagged ATG4B was assessed using the LC3B-PLA2 assay. Wild-type ATG4B protein showed a robust ATG4B protease activity (Fig. 1C). In contrast, vector alone or the catalytic ATG4B mutant of protein, C74A, showed essentially no activity using the LC3B-PLA2 substrate for assessing protease activity. Upon phosphatase treatment, wild-type ATG4B showed a dramatic reduction in the protease activity toward LC3B-PLA2 (Fig. 1C). The concurrent immunoblot probed with an anti-phosphoserine antibody showed reduced phosphorylation of the ATG4B protein after phosphatase treatment (Fig. 1C). These data suggest that ATG4B activity correlates with the level of ATG4B phosphorylation. To exclude the possibility that phosphorylation of ATG4B was caused by the TAP tag of the protein, we overexpressed functional Flag-ATG4B under the control of constitutive CMV promoter in HEK293T cells. Immunoprecipitated Flag-ATG4B proteins were eluted with 3×Flag peptides, followed by treatment with phosphatase e"
https://openalex.org/W2211545310,"The functional crosstalk between angiotensin II (Ang II) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α has been shown to cause adverse left ventricular remodeling and hypertrophy in hypertension. Previous studies from our lab showed that mice lacking TNF-α (TNF-α-/-) have attenuated hypertensive response to Ang II; however, the signaling mechanisms involved are not known. In this study, we investigated the signaling pathways involved in the Ang II and TNF-α interaction. Chronic Ang II infusion (1μg/kg/min, 14 days) significantly increased cardiac collagen I, collagen III, CTGF and TGF-β mRNA and protein expression in wild-type (WT) mice, whereas these changes were decreased in TNF-α-/- mice. TNF-α-/- mice with Ang II infusion showed reduced myocardial perivascular and interstitial fibrosis compared to WT mice with Ang II infusion. In WT mice, Ang II infusion increased reactive oxygen species formation and the expression of NADPH oxidase subunits, indicating increased oxidative stress, but not in TNF-α-/- mice. In addition, treatment with etanercept (8 mg/kg, every 3 days) for two weeks blunted the Ang II-induced hypertension (133±4 vs 154±3 mmHg, p<0.05) and cardiac hypertrophy (heart weight to body weight ratio, 4.8±0.2 vs 5.6±0.3, p<0.05) in WT mice. Furthermore, Ang II-induced activation of NF-κB, p38 MAPK, and JNK were reduced in both TNF-α-/- mice and mice treated with etanercept. Together, these findings indicate that TNF-α contributes to Ang II-induced hypertension and adverse cardiac remodeling, and that these effects are associated with changes in the oxidative stress dependent MAPK/TGF-β/NF-κB pathway. These results may provide new insight into the mechanisms of Ang II and TNF-α interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2208268954,"Breeding for a subjective goal such as flavor is challenging, as many blueberry cultivars are grown worldwide, and identifying breeding targets relating to blueberry flavor biochemistry that have a high degree of genetic control and low environmental variability are priorities. A variety of biochemical compounds and physical characters induce the sensory responses of taste, olfaction, and somatosensation, all of which interact to create what is perceived flavor. The goal of this study was to identify the flavor compounds with a larger genetic versus environmental component regulating their expression over an array of cultivars, locations, and years. Over the course of three years, consumer panelists rated overall liking, texture, sweetness, sourness, and flavor intensity of 19 southern highbush blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum hybrids) genotypes in 30 sensory panels. Significant positive correlations to overall liking of blueberry fruit (P<0.001) were found with sweetness (R2 = 0.70), texture (R2 = 0.68), and flavor (R2 = 0.63). Sourness had a significantly negative relationship with overall liking (R2 = 0.55). The relationship between flavor and texture liking was also linear (R2 = 0.73, P<0.0001) demonstrating interaction between olfaction and somatosensation. Partial least squares analysis was used to identify sugars, acids, and volatile compounds contributing to liking and sensory intensities, and revealed strong effects of fructose, pH, and several volatile compounds upon all sensory parameters measured. To assess the feasibility of breeding for flavor components, a three year study was conducted to compare genetic and environmental influences on flavor biochemistry. Panelists could discern genotypic variation in blueberry sensory components, and many of the compounds affecting consumer favor of blueberries, such as fructose, pH, β-caryophyllene oxide and 2-heptanone, were sufficiently genetically controlled that allocating resources for their breeding is worthwhile."
https://openalex.org/W1733347003,"Worldwide, coral reefs are challenged by multiple stressors due to growing urbanization, industrialization and coastal development. Coral reefs along the Thousand Islands off Jakarta, one of the largest megacities worldwide, have degraded dramatically over recent decades. The shift and decline in coral cover and composition has been extensively studied with a focus on large-scale gradients (i.e. regional drivers), however special focus on local drivers in shaping spatial community composition is still lacking. Here, the spatial impact of anthropogenic stressors on local and regional scales on coral reefs north of Jakarta was investigated. Results indicate that the direct impact of Jakarta is mainly restricted to inshore reefs, separating reefs in Jakarta Bay from reefs along the Thousand Islands further north. A spatial patchwork of differentially degraded reefs is present along the islands as a result of localized anthropogenic effects rather than regional gradients. Pollution is the main anthropogenic stressor, with over 80% of variation in benthic community composition driven by sedimentation rate, NO2, PO4 and Chlorophyll a. Thus, the spatial structure of reefs is directly related to intense anthropogenic pressure from local as well as regional sources. Therefore, improved spatial management that accounts for both local and regional stressors is needed for effective marine conservation."
https://openalex.org/W2204454685,"Preferential attachment is a stochastic process that has been proposed to explain certain topological features characteristic of complex networks from diverse domains. The systematic investigation of preferential attachment is an important area of research in network science, not only for the theoretical matter of verifying whether this hypothesized process is operative in real-world networks, but also for the practical insights that follow from knowledge of its functional form. Here we describe a maximum likelihood based estimation method for the measurement of preferential attachment in temporal complex networks. We call the method PAFit, and implement it in an R package of the same name. PAFit constitutes an advance over previous methods primarily because we based it on a nonparametric statistical framework that enables attachment kernel estimation free of any assumptions about its functional form. We show this results in PAFit outperforming the popular methods of Jeong and Newman in Monte Carlo simulations. What is more, we found that the application of PAFit to a publically available Flickr social network dataset yielded clear evidence for a deviation of the attachment kernel from the popularly assumed log-linear form. Independent of our main work, we provide a correction to a consequential error in Newman's original method which had evidently gone unnoticed since its publication over a decade ago."
https://openalex.org/W2172688798,"Purpose This randomized controlled, clinical prospective interventional trial was aimed at exploring the effect of patient empowerment on short- and long-term outcomes after major oncologic surgery in elderly cancer patients. Methods This trial was performed from February 2011 to January 2014 at two tertiary medical centers in Germany. The study included patients aged 65 years and older undergoing elective surgery for gastro-intestinal, genitourinary, and thoracic cancer. The patients were randomly assigned to the intervention group, i.e. patient empowerment through information booklet and diary keeping, or to the control group, which received standard care. Randomization was done by block randomization in blocks of four in order of enrollment. The primary outcome were 1,postoperative length of hospital stay (LOS) and 2. long-term global health-related quality of life (HRQoL) one year postoperatively. HRQoL was assessed using the EORTC QLQ C30 questionnaire. Secondary outcomes encompassed postoperative stress and complications. Further objectives were the identification of predictors of LOS, and HRQoL at 12 months. Results Overall 652 patients were included. The mean age was 72 ± 4.9 years, and the majority of patients were male (68.6%, n = 447). The ^median of postoperative length of stay was 9 days (IQR 7–14 day). There were no significant differences between the intervention and the control groups in postoperative LOS (p = 0.99) or global HRQoL after one year (women: p = 0.54, men: p = 0.94). While overall complications and major complications occurred in 74% and 24% of the cases, respectively, frequency and severity of complications did not differ significantly between the groups. Patients in the intervention group reported significantly less postoperative pain (p = 0.03) than the control group. Independent predictors for LOS were identified as severity of surgery, length of anesthesia, major postoperative complications, nutritional state, and pre-operative physical functional capacity measured by the Timed Up and Go-test by multiple robust regressions. Conclusion Patient empowerment through information booklet and diary keeping did not shorten the postoperative LOS in elderly onco-surgical patients, but improved quality of care regarding postoperative pain. Postoperative length of stay is influenced by pre-operative nutritional state, pre-operative functional impairment, severity of surgery, and length of anesthesia.

The present subgroup analyses evaluated whether or not outcomes were affected by parity, age (18-25 vs 26-35 years), or body mass index (BMI, <30 vs ≥30 kg/m2).Nulliparous and parous women aged 18‒35 years with regular menstrual cycles (21‒35 days) requesting contraception were randomized to 3 years of LNG-IUS 8 or LNG-IUS 13 use.In the LNG-IUS 8 and LNG-IUS 13 groups, 1432 and 1452 women, respectively, had a placement attempted and were included in the full analysis set; 39.2%, 39.2% and 17.1% were 18-25 years old, nulliparous and had a BMI ≥30 kg/m2, respectively. Both systems were similarly effective regardless of age, parity or BMI; the subgroup Pearl Indices had widely overlapping 95% confidence intervals. Placement of LNG-IUS 8 and LNG-IUS 13 was easier (p < 0.0001) and less painful (p < 0.0001) in women who had delivered vaginally than in women who had not.

Of them, SEMA7A has been reported to have a chemotactic activity in neurogenesis and to be an immunomodulator; however, little is known about the relevance of SEMA7A in the behaviors of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC).We evaluated SEMA7A expression in OSCC-derived cell lines and primary OSCC samples using quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, immunoblotting, and semiquantitative immunohistochemistry (sq-IHC). In addition, SEMA7A knockdown cells (shSEMA7A cells) were used for functional experiments, including cellular proliferation, invasiveness, and migration assays. We also analyzed the clinical correlation between SEMA7A status and clinical behaviors in patients with OSCC.SEMA7A mRNA and protein were up-regulated significantly (P<0.05) in OSCC-derived cell lines compared with human normal oral keratinocytes. The shSEMA7A cells showed decreased cellular growth by cell-cycle arrest at the G1 phase, resulting from up-regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (p21Cip1 and p27Kip1) and down-regulation of cyclins (cyclin D1, cyclin E) and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6); and decreased invasiveness and migration activities by reduced secretion of matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) (MMP-2, proMMP-2, pro-MMP-9), and expression of membrane type 1- MMP (MT1-MMP). We also found inactivation of the extracellular regulated kinase 1/2 and AKT pathways, an upstream molecule of cell-cycle arrest at the G1 phase, and reduced secretion of MMPs in shSEMA7A cells. sq-IHC showed that SEMA7A expression in the primary OSCCs was significantly (P = 0.001) greater than that in normal counterparts and was correlated with primary tumoral size (P = 0.0254) and regional lymph node metastasis (P = 0.0002).Our data provide evidence for an essential role of SEMA7A in tumoral growth and metastasis in OSCC and indicated that SEMA7A may play a potential diagnostic/therapeutic target for use in patients with OSCC."
https://openalex.org/W2212092913,"Introduction Imbalance of the human gut microbiota in early childhood is suggested as a risk factor for immune-mediated disorders such as allergies. With the objective to modulate the intestinal microbiota, probiotic supplementation during infancy has been used for prevention of allergic diseases in infants, with variable success. However, not much is known about the long-term consequences of neonatal use of probiotics on the microbiota composition. The aim of this study was to assess the composition and microbial diversity in stool samples of infants at high-risk for atopic disease, from birth onwards to six years of age, who were treated with probiotics or placebo during the first year of life. Methods In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, a probiotic mixture consisting of B. bifidum W23, B. lactis W52 and Lc. Lactis W58 (Ecologic® Panda) was administered to pregnant women during the last 6 weeks of pregnancy and to their offspring during the first year of life. During follow-up, faecal samples were collected from 99 children over a 6-year period with the following time points: first week, second week, first month, three months, first year, eighteen months, two years and six years. Bacterial profiling was performed by IS-pro. Differences in bacterial abundance and diversity were assessed by conventional statistics. Results The presence of the supplemented probiotic strains in faecal samples was confirmed, and the probiotic strains had a higher abundance and prevalence in the probiotic group during supplementation. Only minor and short term differences in composition of microbiota were found between the probiotic and placebo group and between children with or without atopy. The diversity of Bacteroidetes was significantly higher after two weeks in the placebo group, and at the age of two years atopic children had a significantly higher Proteobacteria diversity (p < 0.05). Gut microbiota development continued between two and six years, whereby microbiota composition at phylum level evolved more and more towards an adult-like configuration. Conclusion Perinatal supplementation with Ecologic® Panda, to children at high-risk for atopic disease, had minor effects on gut microbiota composition during the supplementation period. No long lasting differences were identified. Regardless of intervention or atopic disease status, children had a shared microbiota development over time determined by age that continued to develop between two and six years."

https://openalex.org/W2256370112,"Healthy young adults display a leftward asymmetry of spatial attention (""pseudoneglect"") that has been measured with a wide range of different tasks. Yet at present there is a lack of systematic evidence that the tasks commonly used in research today are i) stable measures over time and ii) provide similar measures of spatial bias. Fifty right-handed young adults were tested on five tasks (manual line bisection, landmark, greyscales, gratingscales and lateralised visual detection) on two different days. All five tasks were found to be stable measures of bias over the two testing sessions, indicating that each is a reliable measure in itself. Surprisingly, no strongly significant inter-task correlations were found. However, principal component analysis revealed left-right asymmetries to be subdivided in 4 main components, namely asymmetries in size judgements (manual line bisection and landmark), luminance judgements (greyscales), stimulus detection (lateralised visual detection) and judgements of global/local features (manual line bisection and grating scales). The results align with recent research on hemispatial neglect which conceptualises the condition as multi-component rather than a single pathological deficit of spatial attention. We conclude that spatial biases in judgment of visual stimulus features in healthy adults (e.g., pseudoneglect) is also a multi-component phenomenon that may be captured by variations in task demands which engage task-dependent patterns of activation within the attention network."
https://openalex.org/W2200765636,"Natural populations harbor considerable genetic variation for lifespan. While evolutionary theory provides general explanations for the existence of this variation, our knowledge of the genes harboring naturally occurring polymorphisms affecting lifespan is limited. Here, we assessed the genetic divergence between five Drosophila melanogaster lines selected for postponed senescence for over 170 generations (O lines) and five lines from the same base population maintained at a two week generation interval for over 850 generations (B lines). On average, O lines live 70% longer than B lines, are more productive at all ages, and have delayed senescence for other traits than reproduction. We performed population sequencing of pools of individuals from all B and O lines and identified 6,394 genetically divergent variants in or near 1,928 genes at a false discovery rate of 0.068. A 2.6 Mb region at the tip of the X chromosome contained many variants fixed for alternative alleles in the two populations, suggestive of a hard selective sweep. We also assessed genome wide gene expression of O and B lines at one and five weeks of age using RNA sequencing and identified genes with significant (false discovery rate < 0.05) effects on gene expression with age, population and the age by population interaction, separately for each sex. We identified transcripts that exhibited the transcriptional signature of postponed senescence and integrated the gene expression and genetic divergence data to identify 98 (175) top candidate genes in females (males) affecting postponed senescence and increased lifespan. While several of these genes have been previously associated with Drosophila lifespan, most are novel and constitute a rich resource for future functional validation."
https://openalex.org/W2217729497,"Background Gliadin, the immunogenic component within gluten and trigger of celiac disease, is known to induce the production of Interleukin-8, a potent neutrophil-activating and chemoattractant chemokine. We sought to study the involvement of neutrophils in the early immunological changes following gliadin exposure. Methods Utilizing immunofluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry, the redistribution of major tight junction protein, Zonula occludens (ZO)-1, and neutrophil recruitment were assessed in duodenal tissues of gliadin-gavaged C57BL/6 wild-type and Lys-GFP reporter mice, respectively. Intravital microscopy with Lys-GFP mice allowed monitoring of neutrophil recruitment in response to luminal gliadin exposure in real time. In vitro chemotaxis assays were used to study murine and human neutrophil chemotaxis to gliadin, synthetic alpha-gliadin peptides and the neutrophil chemoattractant, fMet-Leu-Phe, in the presence or absence of a specific inhibitor of the fMet-Leu-Phe receptor-1 (FPR1), cyclosporine H. An irrelevant protein, zein, served as a control. Results Redistribution of ZO-1 and an influx of CD11b+Lys6G+ cells in the lamina propria of the small intestine were observed upon oral gavage of gliadin. In vivo intravital microscopy revealed a slowing down of GFP+ cells within the vessels and influx in the mucosal tissue within 2 hours after challenge. In vitro chemotaxis assays showed that gliadin strongly induced neutrophil migration, similar to fMet-Leu-Phe. We identified thirteen synthetic gliadin peptide motifs that induced cell migration. Blocking of FPR1 completely abrogated the fMet-Leu-Phe-, gliadin- and synthetic peptide-induced migration. Conclusions Gliadin possesses neutrophil chemoattractant properties similar to the classical neutrophil chemoattractant, fMet-Leu-Phe, and likewise uses FPR1 in the process."

Sphaerulina musiva is able to cause infection on leaves, resulting in defoliation and canker formation on stems. To gain a greater understanding of the different responses of poplar species to infection caused by the naturally co-evolved Sphaerulina species, RNA-seq was conducted on leaves of Populus deltoides, P. balsamifera and P. tremuloides infected with S. musiva, S. populicola and a new undescribed species, Ston1, respectively. The experiment was designed to contain the pathogen in a laboratory environment, while replicating disease development in commercial plantations. Following inoculation, trees were monitored for disease symptoms, pathogen growth and host responses. Genes involved in phenylpropanoid, terpenoid and flavonoid biosynthesis were generally upregulated in P. balsamifera and P. tremuloides, while cell wall modification appears to play an important role in the defense of P. deltoides. Poplar defensive genes were expressed early in P. balsamifera and P. tremuloides, but their expression was delayed in P. deltoides, which correlated with the rate of disease symptoms development. Also, severe infection in P. balsamifera led to leaf abscission. This data gives an insight into the large differences in timing and expression of genes between poplar species being attacked by their associated Sphaerulina pathogen."
https://openalex.org/W2340030450,"There is increasing evidence that individual differences in tendency to overeat relate to impulsivity, possibly by increasing reactivity to food-related cues in the environment. This study tested whether acute exposure to food cues enhanced impulsive and risky responses in women classified on tendency to overeat, indexed by scores on the three factor eating questionnaire disinhibition (TFEQ-D), restraint (TFEQ-R) and hunger scales. Ninety six healthy women completed two measures of impulsive responding (delayed discounting, DDT and a Go No-Go, GNG, task) and a measure of risky decision making (the balloon analogue risk task, BART) as well as questionnaire measures of impulsive behaviour either after looking at a series of pictures of food or visually matched controls. Impulsivity (DDT) and risk-taking (BART) were both positively associated with TFEQ-D scores, but in both cases this effect was exacerbated by prior exposure to food cues. No effects of restraint were found. TFEQ-D scores were also related to more commission errors on the GNG, while restrained women were slower on the GNG, but neither effect was modified by cue exposure. Overall these data suggest that exposure to food cues act to enhance general impulsive responding in women at risk of overeating and tentatively suggest an important interaction between tendency for impulsive decision making and food cues that may help explain a key underlying risk factor for overeating."
https://openalex.org/W2218399603,"Objectives This study investigated the effect restricted sleep has on wildland firefighters’ acute cytokine levels during 3 days and 2 nights of simulated physical wildfire suppression work. Methods Firefighters completed multiple days of physical firefighting work separated by either an 8-h (Control condition; n = 18) or 4-h (Sleep restriction condition; n = 17) sleep opportunity each night. Blood samples were collected 4 times a day (i.e., 06:15, 11:30, 18:15, 21:30) from which plasma cytokine levels (IL-6, IL-8, IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-4, IL-10) were measured. Results The primary findings for cytokine levels revealed a fixed effect for condition that showed higher IL-8 levels among firefighters who received an 8-h sleep each night. An interaction effect demonstrated differing increases in IL-6 over successive days of work for the SR and CON conditions. Fixed effects for time indicated that IL-6 and IL-4 levels increased, while IL-1β, TNF-α and IL-8 levels decreased. There were no significant effects for IL-10 observed. Conclusion Findings demonstrate increased IL-8 levels among firefighters who received an 8-h sleep when compared to those who had a restricted 4-h sleep. Firefighters’ IL-6 levels increased in both conditions which may indicate that a 4-h sleep restriction duration and/or period (i.e., 2 nights) was not a significant enough stressor to affect this cytokine. Considering the immunomodulatory properties of IL-6 and IL-4 that inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokines, the rise in IL-6 and IL-4, independent of increases in IL-1β and TNF-α, could indicate a non-damaging response to the stress of simulated physical firefighting work. However, given the link between chronically elevated cytokine levels and several diseases, further research is needed to determine if firefighters’ IL-8 and IL-6 levels are elevated following repeated firefighting deployments across a fire season and over multiple fire seasons."
https://openalex.org/W1945087081,"Equine herpesvirus type 1 (EHV-1) causes respiratory disorders and abortion in equids while EHV-1 regularly causes equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy (EHM), a stroke-like syndrome following endothelial cell infection in horses. Both EHV-1 and EHV-9 infections of non-definitive hosts often result in neuronal infection and high case fatality rates. Hence, EHV-1 and EHV-9 are somewhat unusual herpesviruses and lack strict host specificity, and the true extent of their host ranges have remained unclear. In order to determine the seroprevalence of EHV-1 and EHV-9, a sensitive and specific peptide-based ELISA was developed and applied to 428 sera from captive and wild animals representing 30 species in 12 families and five orders. Members of the Equidae, Rhinocerotidae and Bovidae were serologically positive for EHV-1 and EHV-9. The prevalence of EHV-1 in the sampled wild zebra populations was significantly higher than in zoos suggesting captivity may reduce exposure to EHV-1. Furthermore, the seroprevalence for EHV-1 was significantly higher than for EHV-9 in zebras. In contrast, EHV-9 antibody prevalence was high in captive and wild African rhinoceros species suggesting that they may serve as a reservoir or natural host for EHV-9. Thus, EHV-1 and EHV-9 have a broad host range favoring African herbivores and may have acquired novel natural hosts in ecosystems where wild equids are common and are in close contact with other perissodactyls."
https://openalex.org/W2271074088,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a lethal genetic defect that is associated with the absence of dystrophin protein. Lack of dystrophin protein completely abolishes muscular nitric-oxide synthase (NOS) function as a regulator of blood flow during muscle contraction. In normal muscles, nNOS function is ensured by its localization at the sarcolemma through an interaction of its PDZ domain with dystrophin spectrin-like repeats R16 and R17. Early studies suggested that repeat R17 is the primary site of interaction but ignored the involved nNOS residues, and the R17 binding site has not been described at an atomic level. In this study, we characterized the specific amino acids involved in the binding site of nNOS-PDZ with dystrophin R16–17 using combined experimental biochemical and structural in silico approaches. First, 32 alanine-scanning mutagenesis variants of dystrophin R16–17 indicated the regions where mutagenesis modified the affinity of the dystrophin interaction with the nNOS-PDZ. Second, using small angle x-ray scattering-based models of dystrophin R16–17 and molecular docking methods, we generated atomic models of the dystrophin R16–17·nNOS-PDZ complex that correlated well with the alanine scanning identified regions of dystrophin. The structural regions constituting the dystrophin interaction surface involve the A/B loop and the N-terminal end of helix B of repeat R16 and the N-terminal end of helix A′ and a small fraction of helix B′ and a large part of the helix C′ of repeat R17. The interaction surface of nNOS-PDZ involves its main β-sheet and its specific C-terminal β-finger. Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a lethal genetic defect that is associated with the absence of dystrophin protein. Lack of dystrophin protein completely abolishes muscular nitric-oxide synthase (NOS) function as a regulator of blood flow during muscle contraction. In normal muscles, nNOS function is ensured by its localization at the sarcolemma through an interaction of its PDZ domain with dystrophin spectrin-like repeats R16 and R17. Early studies suggested that repeat R17 is the primary site of interaction but ignored the involved nNOS residues, and the R17 binding site has not been described at an atomic level. In this study, we characterized the specific amino acids involved in the binding site of nNOS-PDZ with dystrophin R16–17 using combined experimental biochemical and structural in silico approaches. First, 32 alanine-scanning mutagenesis variants of dystrophin R16–17 indicated the regions where mutagenesis modified the affinity of the dystrophin interaction with the nNOS-PDZ. Second, using small angle x-ray scattering-based models of dystrophin R16–17 and molecular docking methods, we generated atomic models of the dystrophin R16–17·nNOS-PDZ complex that correlated well with the alanine scanning identified regions of dystrophin. The structural regions constituting the dystrophin interaction surface involve the A/B loop and the N-terminal end of helix B of repeat R16 and the N-terminal end of helix A′ and a small fraction of helix B′ and a large part of the helix C′ of repeat R17. The interaction surface of nNOS-PDZ involves its main β-sheet and its specific C-terminal β-finger."
https://openalex.org/W2196975927,"Oxidative stress is a major contributor to kidney injury following ischemia reperfusion. Ferritin, a highly conserved iron-binding protein, is a key protein in the maintenance of cellular iron homeostasis and protection from oxidative stress. Ferritin mitigates oxidant stress by sequestering iron and preventing its participation in reactions that generate reactive oxygen species. Ferritin is composed of two subunit types, ferritin H and ferritin L. Using an in vivo model that enables conditional tissue-specific doxycycline-inducible expression of ferritin H in the mouse kidney, we tested the hypothesis that an increased level of H-rich ferritin is renoprotective in ischemic acute renal failure. Prior to induction of ischemia, doxycycline increased ferritin H in the kidneys of the transgenic mice nearly 6.5-fold. Following reperfusion for 24 hours, induction of neutrophil gelatinous-associated lipocalin (NGAL, a urine marker of renal dysfunction) was reduced in the ferritin H overexpressers compared to controls. Histopathologic examination following ischemia reperfusion revealed that ferritin H overexpression increased intact nuclei in renal tubules, reduced the frequency of tubular profiles with luminal cast materials, and reduced activated caspase-3 in the kidney. In addition, generation of 4-hydroxy 2-nonenal protein adducts, a measurement of oxidant stress, was decreased in ischemia-reperfused kidneys of ferritin H overexpressers. These studies demonstrate that ferritin H can inhibit apoptotic cell death, enhance tubular epithelial viability, and preserve renal function by limiting oxidative stress following ischemia reperfusion injury."
https://openalex.org/W2208453812,"Recently two novel enzymes were identified in the outer mitochondrial membrane, mARC1 and mARC2. These molybdenum containing enzymes can reduce a variety of N-hydroxylated compounds, such as N-hydroxy-guanidines and sulfohydroxamic acids, as well as convert nitrite into nitric oxide (NO). However, their endogenous functions remain unknown. Here we demonstrate a specific developmental pattern of expression of these enzymes. mARC1, but not mARC2, was found to be expressed in fetal human liver, whereas both, in particular mARC2, are abundant in adult liver and also expressed in omental and subcutaneous fat. Caloric diet restriction of obese patients caused a decreased expression of mARC2 in liver, similar to that seen in the livers of starved rats. Knock down of mARC2 expression by siRNA in murine adipocytes had statistically significant effect on the level of diglycerides and on the fatty acid composition of some triglycerides, concomitantly a clear trend toward the reduced formation of most of triglyceride and phospholipid species was observed. The involvement of mARC2 in the metabolism of the hepatotoxic drug ximelagatran was evaluated in hepatocytes and adipocytes. Ximelagatran was shown to cause oxidative stress and knock down of mARC2 in adipocytes prevented ximelagatran induced inhibition of mitochondrial respiration. In conclusion, our data indicate that mARC1 and mARC2 have different developmental expression profiles, and that mARC2 is involved in lipogenesis, is regulated by nutritional status and responsible for activation of ximelagatran into a mitotoxic metabolite(s)."
https://openalex.org/W2336892138,"Alginates are a class of biopolymers with known iron binding properties which are routinely used in the fabrication of iron-oxide nanoparticles. In addition, alginates have been implicated in influencing human iron absorption. However, the synthesis of iron oxide nanoparticles employs non-physiological pH conditions and whether nanoparticle formation in vivo is responsible for influencing cellular iron metabolism is unclear. Thus the aims of this study were to determine how alginate and iron interact at gastric-comparable pH conditions and how this influences iron metabolism. Employing a range of spectroscopic techniques under physiological conditions alginate-iron complexation was confirmed and, in conjunction with aberration corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy, nanoparticles were observed. The results infer a nucleation-type model of iron binding whereby alginate is templating the condensation of iron-hydroxide complexes to form iron oxide centred nanoparticles. The interaction of alginate and iron at a cellular level was found to decrease cellular iron acquisition by 37% (p < 0.05) and in combination with confocal microscopy the alginate inhibits cellular iron transport through extracellular iron chelation with the resulting complexes not internalised. These results infer alginate as being useful in the chelation of excess iron, especially in the context of inflammatory bowel disease and colorectal cancer where excess unabsorbed luminal iron is thought to be a driver of disease."
https://openalex.org/W1645761776,"Chronic muscle pain is a significant health problem leading to disability[1]. Muscle fatigue can exacerbate muscle pain. Metabolites, including ATP, lactate, and protons, are released during fatiguing exercise and produce pain in humans. These substances directly activate purinergic (P2X) and acid sensing ion channels (ASICs) on muscle nociceptors, and when combined, produce a greater increase in neuron firing than when given alone. Whether the enhanced effect of combining protons, lactate, and ATP is the sum of individual effects (additive) or more than the sum of individual effects (synergistic) is unknown. Using a rat model of muscle nociceptive behavior, we tested each of these compounds individually over a range of physiologic and supra-physiologic concentrations. Further, we combined all three compounds in a series of dilutions and tested their effect on muscle nociceptive behavior. We also tested a non-hydrolyzable form of ATP (α,β-meATP) alone and in combination with lactate and acidic pH. Surprisingly, we found no dose-dependent effect on muscle nociceptive behavior for protons, lactate, or ATP when given alone. We similarly found no effect after application of each two-metabolite combination. Only pH 4 saline and α,β-meATP produced hyperalgesia when given alone. When all 3 substances were combined, however, ATP (2.4μm), lactate (10mM), and acidic pH (pH 6.0) produced an enhanced effect greater than the sum of the effects of the individual components, i.e. synergism. α,β me ATP (3nmol), on the other hand, showed no enhanced effects when combined with lactate (10mM) or acidic pH (pH 6.0), i.e. additive. These data suggest that combining fatigue metabolites in muscle produces a synergistic effect on muscle nociception."
https://openalex.org/W2205963623,"The serralysin family of bacterial metalloproteases is associated with virulence in multiple modes of infection. These extracellular proteases are members of the Repeats-in-ToXin (RTX) family of toxins and virulence factors, which mediated virulence in E. coli, B. pertussis, and P. aeruginosa, as well as other animal and plant pathogens. The serralysin proteases are structurally dynamic and their folding is regulated by calcium binding to a C-terminal domain that defines the RTX family of proteins. Previous studies have suggested that interactions between N-terminal sequences and this C-terminal domain are important for the high thermal and chemical stabilities of the RTX proteases. Extending from this, stabilization of these interactions in the native structure may lead to hyperstabilization of the folded protein. To test this hypothesis, cysteine pairs were introduced into the N-terminal helix and the RTX domain and protease folding and activity were assessed. Under stringent pH and temperature conditions, the disulfide-bonded mutant showed increased protease activity and stability. This activity was dependent on the redox environment of the refolding reaction and could be blocked by selective modification of the cysteine residues before protease refolding. These data demonstrate that the thermal and chemical stability of these proteases is, in part, mediated by binding between the RTX domain and the N-terminal helix and demonstrate that stabilization of this interaction can further stabilize the active protease, leading to additional pH and thermal tolerance."
https://openalex.org/W2213808769,"Network structures created by hydroxycinnamate cross-links within the cell wall architecture of gramineous plants make the cell wall resistant to the gravitational force of the earth. In this study, the effects of microgravity on the formation of cell wall-bound hydroxycinnamates were examined using etiolated rice shoots simultaneously grown under artificial 1 g and microgravity conditions in the Cell Biology Experiment Facility on the International Space Station. Measurement of the mechanical properties of cell walls showed that shoot cell walls became stiff during the growth period and that microgravity suppressed this stiffening. Amounts of cell wall polysaccharides, cell wall-bound phenolic acids, and lignin in rice shoots increased as the shoot grew. Microgravity did not influence changes in the amounts of cell wall polysaccharides or phenolic acid monomers such as ferulic acid (FA) and p-coumaric acid, but it suppressed increases in diferulic acid (DFA) isomers and lignin. Activities of the enzymes phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) and cell wall-bound peroxidase (CW-PRX) in shoots also increased as the shoot grew. PAL activity in microgravity-grown shoots was almost comparable to that in artificial 1 g-grown shoots, while CW-PRX activity increased less in microgravity-grown shoots than in artificial 1 g-grown shoots. Furthermore, the increases in expression levels of some class III peroxidase genes were reduced under microgravity conditions. These results suggest that a microgravity environment modifies the expression levels of certain class III peroxidase genes in rice shoots, that the resultant reduction of CW-PRX activity may be involved in suppressing DFA formation and lignin polymerization, and that this suppression may cause a decrease in cross-linkages within the cell wall architecture. The reduction in intra-network structures may contribute to keeping the cell wall loose under microgravity conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2222726938,"The present studies were designed to examine the effects of ClC-2 ablation on cellular morphology, parietal cell abundance, H/K ATPase expression, parietal cell ultrastructure and acid secretion using WT and ClC-2-/- mouse stomachs. Cellular histology, morphology and proteins were examined using imaging techniques, electron microscopy and western blot. The effect of histamine on the pH of gastric contents was measured. Acid secretion was also measured using methods and secretagogues previously established to give maximal acid secretion and morphological change. Compared to WT, ClC-2-/- gastric mucosal histological organization appeared disrupted, including dilation of gastric glands, shortening of the gastric gland region and disorganization of all cell layers. Parietal cell numbers and H/K ATPase expression were significantly reduced by 34% (P<0.05) and 53% (P<0.001) respectively and cytoplasmic tubulovesicles appeared markedly reduced on electron microscopic evaluation without evidence of canalicular expansion. In WT parietal cells, ClC-2 was apparent in a similar cellular location as the H/K ATPase by immunofluorescence and appeared associated with tubulovesicles by immunogold electron microscopy. Histamine-stimulated [H+] of the gastric contents was significantly (P<0.025) lower by 9.4 fold (89%) in the ClC-2-/- mouse compared to WT. Histamine/carbachol stimulated gastric acid secretion was significantly reduced (range 84–95%, P<0.005) in ClC-2-/- compared to WT, while pepsinogen secretion was unaffected. Genetic ablation of ClC-2 resulted in reduced gastric gland region, reduced parietal cell number, reduced H/K ATPase, reduced tubulovesicles and reduced stimulated acid secretion."
https://openalex.org/W2299290608,"Alexander disease is a fatal neurodegenerative disease caused by mutations in the astrocyte intermediate filament glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). The disease is characterized by elevated levels of GFAP and the formation of protein aggregates, known as Rosenthal fibers, within astrocytes. Lithium has previously been shown to decrease protein aggregates by increasing the autophagy pathway for protein degradation. In addition, lithium has also been reported to decrease activation of the transcription factor STAT3, which is a regulator of GFAP transcription and astrogliogenesis. Here we tested whether lithium treatment would decrease levels of GFAP in a mouse model of Alexander disease. Mice with the Gfap-R236H point mutation were fed lithium food pellets for 4 to 8 weeks. Four weeks of treatment with LiCl at 0.5% in food pellets decreased GFAP protein and transcripts in several brain regions, although with mild side effects and some mortality. Extending the duration of treatment to 8 weeks resulted in higher mortality, and again with a decrease in GFAP in the surviving animals. Indicators of autophagy, such as LC3, were not increased, suggesting that lithium may decrease levels of GFAP through other pathways. Lithium reduced the levels of phosphorylated STAT3, suggesting this as one pathway mediating the effects on GFAP. In conclusion, lithium has the potential to decrease GFAP levels in Alexander disease, but with a narrow therapeutic window separating efficacy and toxicity."
https://openalex.org/W2336805506,"While the prevalence of mental illness or cognitive disability is higher among homeless people than the general population in Western countries, few studies have investigated its prevalence in Japan or other Asian countries. The present study conducted a survey to comprehensively assess prevalence of mental illness, cognitive disability, and their overlap among homeless individuals living in Nagoya, Japan.Participants were 114 homeless individuals. Mental illness was diagnosed based on semi-structured interviews conducted by psychiatrists. The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III (WAIS-III, simplified version) was used to diagnose intellectual/ cognitive disability.Among all participants, 42.1% (95% CI 33.4-51.3%) were diagnosed with a mental illness: 4.4% (95% CI 1.9-9.9%) with schizophrenia or other psychotic disorder, 17.5% (95% CI 11.6-25.6%) with a mood disorder, 2.6% (95% CI 0.9-7.5%) with an anxiety disorder, 14.0% (95% CI 8.8-21.6%) with a substance-related disorder, and 3.5% (95% CI 1.4-8.8%) with a personality disorder. Additionally, 34.2% (95% CI 26.1-43.3%) demonstrated cognitive disability: 20.2% (95% CI 13.8-28.5%) had mild and 14.0% (95% CI 8.8-21.6%) had moderate or severe disability. The percent overlap between mental illness and cognitive disability was 15.8% (95% CI 10.2-23.6%). Only 39.5% (95% CI 26.1-43.3%) of the participants were considered to have no psychological or cognitive dysfunction. Participants were divided into four groups based on the presence or absence of mental illness and/or cognitive disability. Only individuals with a cognitive disability reported a significant tendency toward not wanting to leave their homeless life.This is the first report showing that the prevalence of mental illness and/or cognitive disability among homeless individuals is much higher than in the general Japanese population. Appropriate support strategies should be devised and executed based on the specificities of an individual's psychological and cognitive condition."
https://openalex.org/W2182291606,"Integration of mitochondria with cytosolic ATP-consuming/ATP-sensing and substrate supply processes is critical for muscle bioenergetics and electrical activity. Whether age-dependent muscle weakness and increased electrical instability depends on perturbations in cellular energetic circuits is unknown. To define energetic remodeling of aged atrial myocardium we tracked dynamics of ATP synthesis-utilization, substrate supply, and phosphotransfer circuits through adenylate kinase (AK), creatine kinase (CK), and glycolytic/glycogenolytic pathways using 18O stable isotope-based phosphometabolomic technology. Samples of intact atrial myocardium from adult and aged rats were subjected to 18O-labeling procedure at resting basal state, and analyzed using the 18O-assisted HPLC-GC/MS technique. Characteristics for aging atria were lower inorganic phosphate Pi[18O], γ-ATP[18O], β-ADP[18O], and creatine phosphate CrP[18O] 18O-labeling rates indicating diminished ATP utilization-synthesis and AK and CK phosphotransfer fluxes. Shift in dynamics of glycolytic phosphotransfer was reflected in the diminished G6P[18O] turnover with relatively constant glycogenolytic flux or G1P[18O] 18O-labeling. Labeling of G3P[18O], an indicator of G3P-shuttle activity and substrate supply to mitochondria, was depressed in aged myocardium. Aged atrial myocardium displayed reduced incorporation of 18O into second (18O2), third (18O3), and fourth (18O4) positions of Pi[18O] and a lower Pi[18O]/γ-ATP[18 O]-labeling ratio, indicating delayed energetic communication and ATP cycling between mitochondria and cellular ATPases. Adrenergic stress alleviated diminished CK flux, AK catalyzed β-ATP turnover and energetic communication in aging atria. Thus, 18O-assisted phosphometabolomics uncovered simultaneous phosphotransfer through AK, CK, and glycolytic pathways and G3P substrate shuttle deficits hindering energetic communication and ATP cycling, which may underlie energetic vulnerability of aging atrial myocardium."
https://openalex.org/W2222493247,"ACE inhibitors and ARBs (angiotensin receptor blockers) have been shown to attenuate radiation injuries in animal models of lethal gamma irradiation. These two classes of drug act by curtailing the actions of angiotensin II-linked inflammatory pathways that are up-regulated during gamma radiation in organ systems such as the brain, lung, kidney, and bone marrow. ACE inhibitors inhibit ACE and attenuate the formation of angiotensin II from angiotensin I; ARBs block the angiotensin AT1 receptor and attenuate the actions of angiotensin II that are elicited through the receptor. DAA-I (des-aspartate-angiotensin I), an orally active angiotensin peptide, also attenuates the deleterious actions of angiotensin II. It acts as an agonist on the angiotensin AT1 receptor and elicits responses that oppose those of angiotensn II. Thus, DAA-I was investigated for its anticipated radioprotection in gamma irradiated mice. DAA-I administered orally at 800 nmole/kg/day for 30 days post exposure (6.4 Gy) attenuated the death of mice during the 30-day period. The attenuation was blocked by losartan (50 nmole/kg/day, i.p.) that was administered sequential to DAA-I administration. This shows that the radioprotection was mediated via the angiotensin AT1 receptor. Furthermore, the radioprotection correlated to an increase in circulating PGE2 of surviving animals, and this suggests that PGE2 is involved in the radioprotection in DAA-I-treated mice. At the hematopoietic level, DAA-I significantly improved two syndromes of myelosuppression (leucopenia and lymphocytopenia), and mice pre-treated with DAA-I prior to gamma irradiation showed significant improvement in the four myelodysplastic syndromes that were investigated, namely leucopenia, lymphocytopenia, monocytopenia and thrombocytopenia. Based on the known ability of PGE2 to attenuate the loss of functional hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells in radiation injury, we hypothesize that PGE2 mediated the action of DAA-I. DAA-I completely attenuated the increase in circulating level of two inflammatory cytokines, TNFα and IL-6, in irradiated mice; and this shows that DAA-I exerted additional anti-inflammatory actions, which could also have contributed to its radioprotection. These findings show that DAA-I acts via a novel mechanism of action on the angiotensin AT1 receptor to specifically release PGE2, which mediates radioprotection in the gamma irradiated mice."

During chromosome alignment, kinetochore-bound microtubules undergo dynamic cycles between growth and shrinkage, leading to an oscillatory movement of chromosomes along the spindle axis. Although kinetochore protein CENP-H serves as a molecular control of kinetochore-microtubule dynamics, the mechanistic link between CENP-H and kinetochore microtubules (kMT) has remained less characterized. Here, we show that CSPP1 is a kinetochore protein essential for accurate chromosome movements in mitosis. CSPP1 binds to CENP-H in vitro and in vivo. Suppression of CSPP1 perturbs proper mitotic progression and compromises the satisfaction of spindle assembly checkpoint. In addition, chromosome oscillation is greatly attenuated in CSPP1-depleted cells, similar to what was observed in the CENP-H-depleted cells. Importantly, CSPP1 depletion enhances velocity of kinetochore movement, and overexpression of CSPP1 decreases the speed, suggesting that CSPP1 promotes kMT stability during cell division. Specific perturbation of CENP-H/CSPP1 interaction using a membrane-permeable competing peptide resulted in a transient mitotic arrest and chromosome segregation defect.

Previously, we reported that dystrophin 71d and dystrophin 71f are present in nuclei from cultured neurons. In the present work, we performed a detailed analysis of the intranuclear distribution of dystrophin 71 isoforms (Dp71d and Dp71f), during the temporal course of 7-day postnatal rats hippocampal neurons culture for 1h, 2, 4, 10, 15 and 21 days in vitro (DIV). By immunofluorescence assays, we detected the highest level of nuclear expression of both dystrophin Dp71 isoforms at 10 DIV, during the temporal course of primary culture. Dp71d and Dp71f were detected mainly in bipolar GABAergic (≥60%) and multipolar Glutamatergic (≤40%) neurons, respectively. We also characterized the existence of two nuclear dystrophin-associated protein complexes (DAPC): dystrophin 71d or dystrophin 71f bound to β-dystroglycan, α1-, β-, α2-dystrobrevins, α-syntrophin, and syntrophin-associated protein nNOS (Dp71d-DAPC or Dp71f-DAPC, respectively), in the hippocampal neurons. Furthermore, both complexes were localized in interchromatin granule cluster structures (nuclear speckles) of neuronal nucleoskeleton preparations. The present study evinces that each Dp71’s complexes differ slightly in dystrobrevins composition. The results demonstrated that Dp71d-DAPC was mainly localized in bipolar GABAergic and Dp71f-DAPC in multipolar Glutamatergic hippocampal neurons. Taken together, our results show that dystrophin 71d, dystrophin 71f and DAP integrate protein complexes, and both complexes were associated to nuclear speckles structures."
https://openalex.org/W2276303977,"Advanced liver cirrhosis is associated with systemic hemodynamic derangement leading to the development of severe complications associated with increased mortality. Copeptin is a stable cleavage product of the precursor of arginine vasopressin, a key-regulator in hemodynamic homeostasis. Copeptin is currently considered a reliable prognostic marker in a wide variety of diseases other than cirrhosis. The present study aimed to assess copeptin, both experimentally and clinically, as a potential biomarker of hemodynamic derangement and to evaluate its prognostic significance in cirrhosis.Two studies were executed: 1) in 18 thioacetamide-induced cirrhotic rats and 5 control rats, plasma copeptin and hemodynamic measurements were performed, 2) in 61 cirrhotic patients, serum copeptin concentration was measured in samples collected at time of registration at the waiting list for liver transplantation. In 46 patients, also a second copeptin measurement was performed during follow-up while registered at the waiting list for liver transplantation. To determine the association of serum copeptin and clinical data with outcome, Cox proportional hazard regression analysis and Kaplan Meier analysis were performed.Plasma copeptin concentration was significantly higher in cirrhotic rats than in controls (1.6 ± 0.5 vs. 0.9 ± 0.1 pmol/L, p< 0.01) and was negatively correlated to the mean arterial blood pressure (r = -0.574, p = 0.013). In cirrhotic patients, serum copeptin concentration was high [11.0 (5.2-24.0) pmol/L] and increased significantly during the time of registration at the waiting list for liver transplantation. MELD and MELD-sodium score were significantly correlated to serum copeptin [MELD: (r = 0.33, p = 0.01), MELD-sodium: (r = 0.29, p = 0.02)], also at time of the second copeptin measurement [MELD and MELD-sodium: r = 0.39, p< 0.01]. In cirrhotic humans, serum copeptin concentration was significantly associated with outcome, independently of the MELD and MELD-sodium score. Patients with a low serum copeptin concentration at time of registration at the liver transplant waiting list had significantly better transplant-free survival rates at 3, 6 and 12 months of follow-up as compared to those with a high serum copeptin concentration (Log-rank: p< 0.01, p< 0.01 and p = 0.02 respectively).Circulating copeptin levels are elevated in rats and humans with cirrhosis. Copeptin is independently associated with outcome in cirrhotic patients awaiting liver transplantation."
https://openalex.org/W2341300319,"Adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) are clinically important in regenerative medicine as they are relatively easy to obtain, are characterized by low morbidity, and can differentiate into myogenic progenitor cells. Although studies have elucidated the principal markers, PAX7, Desmin, MyoD, and MHC, the underlying mechanisms are not completely understood. This motivates the application of computational methods to facilitate greater understanding of such processes. In the following, we present a multi-stage kinetic model comprising a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). We sought to model ASC differentiation using data from a static culture, where no strain is applied, and a dynamic culture, where 10% strain is applied. The coefficients of the equations have been modulated by those experimental data points. To correctly represent the trajectories, various switches and a feedback factor based on total cell number have been introduced to better represent the biology of ASC differentiation. Furthermore, the model has then been applied to predict ASC fate for strains different from those used in the experimental conditions and for times longer than the duration of the experiment. Analysis of the results reveals unique characteristics of ASC myogenesis under dynamic conditions of the applied strain."
https://openalex.org/W2199737063,"Background and Objectives In order to provide a good match between donor and recipient in liver transplantation, four scoring systems [the product of donor age and Model for End-stage Liver Disease score (D-MELD), the score to predict survival outcomes following liver transplantation (SOFT), the balance of risk score (BAR), and the transplant risk index (TRI)] based on both donor and recipient parameters were designed. This study was conducted to evaluate the performance of the four scores in living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) and compare them with the MELD score. Patients and Methods The clinical data of 249 adult patients undergoing LDLT in our center were retrospectively evaluated. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) of each score were calculated and compared at 1-, 3-, 6-month and 1-year after LDLT. Results The BAR at 1-, 3-, 6-month and 1-year after LDLT and the D-MELD and TRI at 1-, 3- and 6-month after LDLT showed acceptable performances in the prediction of survival (AUC>0.6), while the SOFT showed poor discrimination at 6-month after LDLT (AUC = 0.569). In addition, the D-MELD and BAR displayed positive correlations with the length of ICU stay (D-MELD, p = 0.025; BAR, p = 0.022). The SOFT was correlated with the time of mechanical ventilation (p = 0.022). Conclusion The D-MELD, BAR and TRI provided acceptable performance in predicting survival after LDLT. However, even though these scoring systems were based on both donor and recipient parameters, only the BAR provided better performance than the MELD in predicting 1-year survival after LDLT."

The objective of this study was to describe overall transfusion patterns in the ICU, and specifically in patients who die in hospital. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of adult patients admitted to the ICU of a university-affiliated hospital, who were discharged or died between November 1, 2006 and June 30, 2012. During the study period, 10,642 patients were admitted at least once to the ICU. Of these patients, 4079 (38.3%) received red blood cells (RBCs), plasma or platelets in the ICU. The ICU mortality rate was 28.1% and in-hospital mortality rate was 32.3%. Among 39,591 blood product units transfused over the course of the study in the ICU (18,144 RBC units, 16,920 plasma units and 4527 platelet units), 46.2% were administered to patients who later died within the same hospitalization (41.2% of RBCs, 50.4% of plasma and 50.8% of platelets). Of all blood product units (RBCs, plasma and platelets) administered in the ICU over the study period, 11% were given within the last 24 hours before death. A large proportion of blood products used in the ICU are administered to patients who ultimately succumb to their illness in hospital, and many of these blood units are given in close proximity to death."

We have previously shown that Gcggfp/gfp show improved glucose tolerance with enhanced insulin secretion. Here, we studied glucose and energy metabolism in Gcggfp/gfp mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD). Male Gcggfp/gfp and Gcggfp/+ mice were fed either a normal chow diet (NCD) or an HFD for 15-20 weeks. Regardless of the genotype, mice on an HFD showed glucose intolerance, and Gcggfp/gfp mice on HFD exhibited impaired insulin secretion whereas Gcggfp/+ mice on HFD exhibited increased insulin secretion. A compensatory increase in β-cell mass was observed in Gcggfp/+mice on HFD, but not in Gcggfp/gfp mice on the same diet. Weight gain was significantly lower in Gcggfp/gfp mice than in Gcggfp/+mice. Oxygen consumption was enhanced in Gcggfp/gfp mice compared to Gcggfp/+ mice on an HFD. HFD feeding significantly increased uncoupling protein 1 mRNA expression in brown adipose and inguinal white adipose tissues of Gcggfp/gfp mice, but not of Gcggfp/+mice. Treatment with the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist liraglutide (200 mg/kg) improved glucose tolerance in Gcggfp/gfp mice and insulin content in Gcggfp/gfp and Gcggfp/+ mice was similar after liraglutide treatment. Our findings demonstrate that Gcggfp/gfp mice develop diabetes upon HFD-feeding in the absence of proglucagon-derived peptides, although they are resistant to diet-induced obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2204253940,"Background Cancer health disparities research depends on access to biospecimens from diverse racial/ethnic populations. This multimethodological study, using mixed methods for quantitative and qualitative analysis of survey results, assessed barriers, concerns, and practices for sharing biospecimens/data among researchers working with biospecimens from minority populations in a 5 state region of the United States (Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas). The ultimate goals of this research were to understand data sharing barriers among biomedical researchers; guide strategies to increase participation in biospecimen research; and strengthen collaborative opportunities among researchers. Methods and Population Email invitations to anonymous participants (n = 605 individuals identified by the NIH RePORT database), resulted in 112 responses. The survey assessed demographics, specimen collection data, and attitudes about virtual biorepositories. Respondents were primarily principal investigators at PhD granting institutions (91.1%) conducting basic (62.3%) research; most were non-Hispanic White (63.4%) and men (60.6%). The low response rate limited the statistical power of the analyses, further the number of respondents for each survey question was variable. Results Findings from this study identified barriers to biospecimen research, including lack of access to sufficient biospecimens, and limited availability of diverse tissue samples. Many of these barriers can be attributed to poor annotation of biospecimens, and researchers’ unwillingness to share existing collections. Addressing these barriers to accessing biospecimens is essential to combating cancer in general and cancer health disparities in particular. This study confirmed researchers’ willingness to participate in a virtual biorepository (n = 50 respondents agreed). However, researchers in this region listed clear specifications for establishing and using such a biorepository: specifications related to standardized procedures, funding, and protections of human subjects and intellectual property. The results help guide strategies to increase data sharing behaviors and to increase participation of researchers with multiethnic biospecimen collections in collaborative research endeavors Conclusions Data sharing by researchers is essential to leveraging knowledge and resources needed for the advancement of research on cancer health disparities. Although U.S. funding entities have guidelines for data and resource sharing, future efforts should address researcher preferences in order to promote collaboration to address cancer health disparities."
https://openalex.org/W2220023677,"3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), also known as ""Ecstasy"", is a common recreational drug of abuse. Several previous studies have attributed the central serotonergic neurotoxicity of MDMA to distal axotomy, since only fine serotonergic axons ascending from the raphe nucleus are lost without apparent damage to their cell bodies. However, this axotomy has never been visualized directly in vivo. The present study examined the axonal integrity of the efferent projections from the midbrain raphe nucleus after MDMA exposure using in vivo manganese-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MEMRI). Rats were injected subcutaneously six times with MDMA (5 mg/kg) or saline once daily. Eight days after the last injection, manganese ions (Mn2+) were injected stereotactically into the raphe nucleus, and a series of MEMRI images was acquired over a period of 38 h to monitor the evolution of Mn2+-induced signal enhancement across the ventral tegmental area, the medial forebrain bundle (MFB), and the striatum. The MDMA-induced loss of serotonin transporters was clearly evidenced by immunohistological staining consistent with the Mn2+-induced signal enhancement observed across the MFB and striatum. MEMRI successfully revealed the disruption of the serotonergic raphe-striatal projections and the variable effect of MDMA on the kinetics of Mn2+ accumulation in the MFB and striatum."
https://openalex.org/W2246525135,"Lignin, a rigid biopolymer in plant cell walls, is derived from the oxidative polymerization of three monolignols. The composition of monolignol monomers dictates the degree of lignin condensation, reactivity, and thus the degradability of plant cell walls. Guaiacyl lignin is regarded as the condensed structural unit. Polymerization of lignin is initiated through the deprotonation of the para-hydroxyl group of monolignols. Therefore, preferentially modifying the para-hydroxyl of a specific monolignol to deprive its dehydrogenation propensity would disturb the formation of particular lignin subunits. Here, we test the hypothesis that specific remodeling the active site of a monolignol 4-O-methyltransferase would create an enzyme that specifically methylates the condensed guaiacyl lignin precursor coniferyl alcohol. Combining crystal structural information with combinatorial active site saturation mutagenesis and starting with the engineered promiscuous enzyme, MOMT5 (T133L/E165I/F175I/F166W/H169F), we incrementally remodeled its substrate binding pocket by the addition of four substitutions, i.e. M26H, S30R, V33S, and T319M, yielding a mutant enzyme capable of discriminately etherifying the para-hydroxyl of coniferyl alcohol even in the presence of excess sinapyl alcohol. The engineered enzyme variant has a substantially reduced substrate binding pocket that imposes a clear steric hindrance thereby excluding bulkier lignin precursors. The resulting enzyme variant represents an excellent candidate for modulating lignin composition and/or structure in planta."
https://openalex.org/W1949517675,"Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a surface polymer of Gram-negative bacteria, helps bacteria survive in different environments and acts as a virulence determinant of host infection. The O-antigen (Oag) component of LPS exhibits a modal chain-length distribution that is controlled by polysaccharide co-polymerases (PCPs). The molecular basis of the regulation of Oag chain-lengths remains unclear, despite extensive mutagenesis and structural studies of PCPs from Escherichia coli and Shigella. Here, we identified a single mutation (A107P) of the Shigella flexneri WzzBSF, by a random mutagenesis approach, that causes a shortened Oag chain-length distribution in bacteria. We determined the crystal structures of the periplasmic domains of wild-type WzzBSF and the A107P mutant. Both structures form a highly similar open trimeric assembly in the crystals, and show a similar tendency to self-associate in solution. Binding studies by bio-layer interferometry reveal cooperative binding of very short (VS)-core-plus-O-antigen polysaccharide (COPS) to the periplasmic domains of both proteins, but with decreased affinity for the A107P mutant. Our studies reveal that subtle and localized structural differences in PCPs can have dramatic effects on LPS chain-length distribution in bacteria, for example by altering the affinity for the substrate, which supports the role of the structure of the growing Oag polymer in this process."
https://openalex.org/W2189500539,"Loss of the chromosomal region 8p21 negatively effects survival in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) that undergo autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). In this study, we aimed to identify the immunological and molecular consequences of del(8)(p21) with regards to treatment response and bortezomib resistance. In patients receiving bortezomib as a single first line agent without any high-dose therapy, we have observed that patients with del(8)(p21) responded poorly to bortezomib with 50% showing no response while patients without the deletion had a response rate of 90%. In vitro analysis revealed a higher resistance to bortezomib possibly due to an altered gene expression profile caused by del(8)(p21) including genes such as TRAIL-R4, CCDC25, RHOBTB2, PTK2B, SCARA3, MYC, BCL2 and TP53. Furthermore, while bortezomib sensitized MM cells without del(8)(p21) to TRAIL/APO2L mediated apoptosis, in cells with del(8)(p21) bortezomib failed to upregulate the pro-apoptotic death receptors TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2 which are located on the 8p21 region. Also expressing higher levels of the decoy death receptor TRAIL-R4, these cells were largely resistant to TRAIL/APO2L mediated apoptosis. Corroborating the clinical outcome of the patients, our data provides a potential explanation regarding the poor response of MM patients with del(8)(p21) to bortezomib treatment. Furthermore, our clinical analysis suggests that including immunomodulatory agents such as Lenalidomide in the treatment regimen may help to overcome this negative effect, providing an alternative consideration in treatment planning of MM patients with del(8)(p21)."
https://openalex.org/W2340364485,"The growth of myeloma cells depends on bone marrow (BM) stroma consisting of stromal cells, secreted cytokines and the extracellular matrix (ECM). Decorin, a small leucine-rich proteoglycan in the ECM, is a signaling ligand and native anti-tumor agent. However, the role of decorin in patients with myeloma is not clear. We evaluated the correlation between the decorin levels measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in BM plasma from 121 patients with newly diagnosed myeloma based on their clinical features and treatment response. The median decorin levels in the patients and the normal control group were 12.31 ng/mL [standard deviation (SD), 7.50 ng/mL; range, 2.45 to 44.46 ng/mL] and 10.31 ng/mL (SD, 2.42 ng/mL; range, 4.85–15.14 ng/mL), respectively (P < 0.001). Using 15.15 ng/mL as a cut-off, 46 patients (38%) exhibited higher decorin levels (H-DCN), whereas the other patients exhibited normal to lower decorin levels (NL-DCN). Except for the median age, which was significantly younger in the H-DCN than in the NL-DCN group (60.6±14.0 vs. 65.8±12.2 years, respectively; P = 0.034), there were no differences between the two groups. However, in 79 patients who had received novel agent-based induction, the overall response rate was significantly better in the H-DCN than in the NL-DCN (97 vs. 63%, respectively; P < 0.001), as was the depth of responses (P = 0.008), which were not observed in those who had received chemotherapeutic agents alone. Progression-free survival (PFS) was significantly longer in H-DCN than NL-DCN (not reached vs. 19.5 mo, respectively; P = 0.0003). Multivariate analyses indicated that H-DCN, as a significantly independent factor, was associated with better treatment response (odds ratio, 20.014; 95% CI, 2.187–183.150; P = 0.008) and longer PFS (hazard ratio, 0.135; 95% CI, 0.051–0.361; P < 0.001). These findings disclose the potential role of decorin in myeloma and provide a basis for further study on possible synergistic anti-myeloma effects between decorin and the novel agents that target BM stroma."
https://openalex.org/W2274821518,"Early diagnosis of Toxoplasma gondii infection before the formation of tissue cysts is vital for treatment, as drugs available for toxoplasmosis cannot kill bradyzoites contained in the cysts. However, current methods, such as antibody-based ELISA, are ineffective for detection of early infection. Here, we developed an interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA), measuring the IFN-γ released by T lymphocytes stimulated by Toxoplasma antigen peptides in vitro, for the detection of T. gondii infection in mice. Splenocytes isolated from infected mice were stimulated by peptides derived from dense granule proteins GRA4 and GRA6 and rhoptry protein ROP7, and released IFN-γ was measured by ELISA. Results showed that both acute and chronic infection could be detected by IGRA. More importantly, IGRA detected infection as early as the third day post infection; while serum IgM and IgG were detected 9 days and 13 days post infection, respectively. Our findings demonstrated that an IGRA-positive and ELISA-negative sample revealed an early infection, indicating the combination of IGRA and ELISA can be employed for the early diagnosis of T. gondii infection in human beings, cats and livestock."
https://openalex.org/W2153436404,"Sugar chain binding antibodies have gained substantial attention as biomarkers due to their crucial roles in various disorders. In this study, we developed simple and quick detection method of anti-sugar chain antibodies in sera using our previously developed sugar chain-immobilized fluorescent nanoparticles (SFNPs) for the point-of-care diagnostics. Sugar chain structure on SFNPs was modified with the sugar moieties of the GM1 ganglioside via our original linker molecule to detect anti-GM1 antibodies. The structures and densities of the sugar moieties immobilized on the nanoparticles were evaluated in detail using lectins and sera containing anti-GM1 antibodies from patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome, a neurological disorder, as an example of disease involving anti-sugar chain antibodies. When optimized SFNPs were added to sera from patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome, fluorescent aggregates were able to visually detect under UV light in three hours. The sensitivity of the detection method was equivalent to that of the current ELISA method used for the diagnosis of Guillain-Barré syndrome. These results suggest that our method using SFNPs is suitable for the point-of-care diagnostics of diseases involving anti-sugar chain antibodies."
https://openalex.org/W2336557270,"Laminin isoforms laminin-511 and -521 are expressed by human embryonic stem cells (hESC) and can be used as a growth matrix to culture these cells under pluripotent conditions. However, the expression of these laminins during the induction of hESC differentiation has not been studied in detail. Furthermore, the data regarding the expression pattern of laminin chains in differentiating hESC is scarce. In the current study we aimed to fill this gap and investigated the potential changes in laminin expression during early hESC differentiation induced by retinoic acid (RA). We found that laminin-511 but not -521 accumulates in the committed cells during early steps of hESC differentiation. We also performed a comprehensive analysis of the laminin chain repertoire and found that pluripotent hESC express a more diverse range of laminin chains than shown previously. In particular, we provide the evidence that in addition to α1, α5, β1, β2 and γ1 chains, hESC express α2, α3, β3, γ2 and γ3 chain proteins and mRNA. Additionally, we found that a variant of laminin α3 chain-145 kDa-accumulated in RA-treated hESC showing that these cells produce prevalently specifically modified version of α3 chain in early phase of differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1956378613,"The systematic relationships and phylogeography of Cerion incanum, the only species of Cerion native to the Florida Keys, are reviewed based on partial sequences of the mitochondrial COI and 16S genes derived from 18 populations spanning the range of this species and including the type localities of all four described subspecies. Our samples included specimens of Cerion casablancae, a species introduced to Indian Key in 1912, and a population of C. incanum x C. casablancae hybrids descended from a population of C. casablancae introduced onto Bahia Honda Key in the same year. Molecular data did not support the partition of C. incanum into subspecies, nor could populations be apportioned reliably into subspecies based on morphological features used to define the subspecies. Phylogenetic analyses affirmed the derived relationship of C. incanum relative to other cerionids, and indicated a Bahamian origin for the Cerion fauna of southern Florida. Relationships among the populations throughout the Keys indicate that the northernmost populations, closest to the Tomeu paleoislands that had been inhabited by Cerion petuchi during the Calabrian Pleistocene, are the oldest. The range of Cerion incanum expanded as the archipelago that is the Florida Keys was formed since the lower Tarantian Pleistocene by extension from the northeast to the southwest, with new islands populated as they were formed. The faunas of the High Coral Keys in the northeast and the Oölite Keys in the southwest, both with large islands that host multiple discontinuous populations of Cerion, are each composed of well supported clades that are characterized by distinctive haplotypes. In contrast, the fauna of the intervening Low Coral Keys consist of a heterogeneous series of populations, some with haplotypes derived from the High Coral Keys, others from the Oölite Keys. Individuals from the C. incanum x C. casablancae hybrid population inhabiting the southeastern coast of Bahia Honda Key were readily segregated based on their mitogenome lineage, grouping either with C. incanum or with C. casablancae from Indian Key. Hybrids with C. casablancae mitogenomes had haplotypes that were more divergent from their parent mitogenome than were hybrids with C. incanum mitogenomes."
