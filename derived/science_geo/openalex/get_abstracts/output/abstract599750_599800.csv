https://openalex.org/W2345112163,"The prefrontal cortex supports the expression and inhibition of fear- and reward-related behaviors. These dualities are attributable to discrete functional domains making up this brain region, which allow it to stimulate or inhibit behavior depending on an organism's experiences. The authors review evidence that supports, or refutes, this “go/stop” function. The rodent dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (PFC), specifically the prelimbic cortex (PL), regulates the expression of conditioned fear and behaviors interpreted as reward seeking. Meanwhile, the ventral medial PFC, namely the infralimbic cortex (IL), is essential to extinction conditioning in both appetitive and aversive domains. Here we review evidence that supports, or refutes, this “PL-go/IL-stop” dichotomy. We focus on the extinction of conditioned fear and the extinction and reinstatement of cocaine- or heroin-reinforced responding following abstinence. We then synthesize evidence that the PL is essential for developing goal-directed response strategies, while the IL supports habit behavior. Finally, we propose that some functions of the orbital PFC parallel those of the medial PFC in the regulation of response selection. Integration of these discoveries may provide points of intervention for inhibiting untethered drug seeking in drug use disorders, extinction failures in post-traumatic stress disorder, or co-morbidities between the two."

Correlation requires synthesis of lithostratigraphic, biostratigraphic and geochronologic data, and must be periodically updated to accord with advances in dating techniques, changing standards for radiometric dates, new stratigraphic concepts, hypotheses, fossil specimens, and field data. Outdated or incorrect correlation exposes geological and paleontological analyses to potential error. The current work presents a high-resolution stratigraphic chart for terrestrial Late Cretaceous units of North America, combining published chronostratigraphic, lithostratigraphic, and biostratigraphic data. 40Ar / 39Ar radiometric dates are newly recalibrated to both current standard and decay constant pairings. Revisions to the stratigraphic placement of most units are slight, but important changes are made to the proposed correlations of the Aguja and Javelina formations, Texas, and recalibration corrections in particular affect the relative age positions of the Belly River Group, Alberta; Judith River Formation, Montana; Kaiparowits Formation, Utah; and Fruitland and Kirtland formations, New Mexico. The stratigraphic ranges of selected clades of dinosaur species are plotted on the chronostratigraphic framework, with some clades comprising short-duration species that do not overlap stratigraphically with preceding or succeeding forms. This is the expected pattern that is produced by an anagenetic mode of evolution, suggesting that true branching (speciation) events were rare and may have geographic significance. The recent hypothesis of intracontinental latitudinal provinciality of dinosaurs is shown to be affected by previous stratigraphic miscorrelation. Rapid stepwise acquisition of display characters in many dinosaur clades, in particular chasmosaurine ceratopsids, suggests that they may be useful for high resolution biostratigraphy."

In this study, we present a machine learning-based strategy for early detection of exacerbations and subsequent triage. Our application uses physician opinion in a statistically and clinically comprehensive set of patient cases to train a supervised prediction algorithm. The accuracy of the model is assessed against a panel of physicians each triaging identical cases in a representative patient validation set. Our results show that algorithm accuracy and safety indicators surpass all individual pulmonologists in both identifying exacerbations and predicting the consensus triage in a 101 case validation set. The algorithm is also the top performer in sensitivity, specificity, and ppv when predicting a patient's need for emergency care."
https://openalex.org/W2770898502,"Macrophages are a main component of atherosclerotic plaques. Recent studies suggest that pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages are pro-atherogenic while M2 macrophages promote plaque stability. Moreover, toll-like receptor signalling pathways are implicated in atherosclerotic plaque formation, evolution and regression. We propose microRNAs as key regulators of these processes. In this context, our goal is to promote inflammation resolution using miR-195 to reduce M1-like macrophage polarization and to evaluate the molecular mechanisms underlying such effect, as well as to explore the functional consequences for smooth muscle cell recruitment. Human primary macrophages were differentiated from peripheral blood monocytes and stimulated with LPS or IL-10 to promote M1 or M2c polarization, respectively. miR-195 levels were upregulated in M2c macrophages compared with M1 macrophages. In THP-1 macrophages stimulated with LPS and IFN-γ, results show that TLR2 levels were reduced by miR-195 overexpression compared with scrambled control. In addition, phosphorylated forms of p54 JNK, p46 JNK and p38 MAPK were decreased by miR-195 in macrophages following M1 stimulation. Moreover, miR-195 significantly decreased levels of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α pro-inflammatory cytokines in the supernatants of M1-stimulated macrophage cultures. At the functional level, results from smooth muscle cell recruitment and migration models showed that miR-195 impairs the capacity of M1 macrophages to promote smooth muscle cells migration. In conclusion, miR-195 is involved in macrophage polarization and inhibits TLR2 inflammatory pathway mediators. Moreover, miR-195 impairs the effect of macrophages on smooth muscle cells recruitment capacity and migration profile. Thus, miR-195 might be used as a new potential tool to promote inflammation resolution in cardiovascular research."
https://openalex.org/W2768359849,"There is increasing clinical evidence that the eye is not only affected by intraocular pressure (IOP), but also by intracranial pressure (ICP). Both pressures meet at the optic nerve head of the eye, specifically the lamina cribrosa (LC). The LC is a collagenous meshwork through which all retinal ganglion cell axons pass on their way to the brain. Distortion of the LC causes a biological cascade leading to neuropathy and impaired vision in situations such as glaucoma and idiopathic intracranial hypertension. While the effect of IOP on the LC has been studied extensively, the coupled effects of IOP and ICP on the LC remain poorly understood. We investigated in-vivo the effects of IOP and ICP, controlled via cannulation of the eye and lateral ventricle in the brain, on the LC microstructure of anesthetized rhesus monkeys eyes using the Bioptigen spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) device (Research Triangle, NC). The animals were imaged with their head upright and the rest of their body lying prone on a surgical table. The LC was imaged at a variety of IOP/ICP combinations, and microstructural parameters, such as the thickness of the LC collagenous beams and diameter of the pores were analyzed. LC microstructure was confirmed by histology. We determined that LC microstructure deformed in response to both IOP and ICP changes, with significant interaction between the two. These findings emphasize the importance of considering both IOP and ICP when assessing optic nerve health."
https://openalex.org/W2768617299,"An altered intestinal microbiota composition has been implicated in the pathogenesis of metabolic disease including obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Low grade inflammation, potentially initiated by the intestinal microbiota, has been suggested to be a driving force in the development of insulin resistance in obesity. Here, we report that bacterial DNA is present in mesenteric adipose tissue of obese but otherwise healthy human subjects. Pyrosequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA genes revealed that DNA from the Gram-negative species Ralstonia was most prevalent. Interestingly, fecal abundance of Ralstonia pickettii was increased in obese subjects with pre-diabetes and T2DM. To assess if R. pickettii was causally involved in development of obesity and T2DM, we performed a proof-of-concept study in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice. Compared to vehicle-treated control mice, R. pickettii-treated DIO mice had reduced glucose tolerance. In addition, circulating levels of endotoxin were increased in R. pickettii-treated mice. In conclusion, this study suggests that intestinal Ralstonia is increased in obese human subjects with T2DM and reciprocally worsens glucose tolerance in DIO mice."
https://openalex.org/W2768776000,"Cardiac mitochondrial phospholipid acyl chains regulate respiratory enzymatic activity. In several diseases, the rodent cardiac phospholipidome is extensively rearranged; however, whether specific acyl chains impair respiratory enzyme function is unknown. One unique remodeling event in the myocardium of obese and diabetic rodents is an increase in docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) levels. Here, we first confirmed that cardiac DHA levels are elevated in diabetic humans relative to controls. We then used dietary supplementation of a Western diet with DHA as a tool to promote cardiac acyl chain remodeling and to study its influence on respiratory enzyme function. DHA extensively remodeled the acyl chains of cardiolipin (CL), monolyso-CL, phosphatidylcholine, and phosphatidylethanolamine. Moreover, DHA lowered enzyme activities of respiratory complexes I, IV, V, and I + III. Mechanistically, the reduction in enzymatic activities was not driven by a dramatic reduction in the abundance of supercomplexes. Instead, replacement of tetralinoleoyl-CL with tetradocosahexaenoyl-CL in biomimetic membranes prevented formation of phospholipid domains that regulate enzyme activity. Tetradocosahexaenoyl-CL inhibited domain organization due to favorable Gibbs free energy of phospholipid mixing. Furthermore, in vitro substitution of tetralinoleoyl-CL with tetradocosahexaenoyl-CL blocked complex IV binding. Finally, reintroduction of linoleic acid, via fusion of phospholipid vesicles to mitochondria isolated from DHA-fed mice, rescued the major losses in the mitochondrial phospholipidome and complexes I, IV, and V activities. Altogether, our results show that replacing linoleic acid with DHA lowers select cardiac enzyme activities by potentially targeting domain organization and phospholipid–protein binding, which has implications for the ongoing debate about polyunsaturated fatty acids and cardiac health.

https://openalex.org/W2769487706,"Background Regular consumption of sugar sweetened beverages (SSBs) is associated with weight gain, type 2 diabetes, and dental caries. The UK will introduce a levy on the manufacturers of SSBs in 2018. Details will be negotiated over the next two years. How the UK public views SSB taxes is likely to be an important determinant of the content and success of the final policy. We aimed to capture the views, ideas and concerns of commenters on major UK news websites on SSB taxes. Methods and findings We conducted a qualitative analysis of reader comments to online news coverage of one proposal for an SSB tax in the UK. 1645 comments on four articles were included. Three underpinning themes influenced support or opposition to the tax: the balance between individual responsibility and autonomy, and population need; mistrust of the intention of the proposed tax and those promoting it; and variations in the perceived complexity of unhealthy diets and obesity associated with variations in what are considered appropriate interventions. Arguments under each theme were used to justify both support and opposition in different cases. Conclusions As the final form of the UK SSB tax is negotiated, effort should be made to address the concerns we identified. Our results suggest these efforts could usefully focus on emphasising the social and environmental determinants of diet and obesity, reinforcing the benefits of the tax to the NHS, and pitching the tax as playing into a variety of different conceptualisations of obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2771032751,"Symbiotic relationships between hosts and bacteria are common in nature, and these may be responsible for the evolutionary success of various groups of animals. Among ants, these associations have been well studied in some genera of the Camponotini, but several questions remain regarding the generality of the previous findings across all the members of this ant tribe and if bacterial communities change across development in these hosts. This study is the first to characterize the bacterial community associated with a colony of the recently recognized genus Colobopsis and three colonies of Camponotus (two distinct species) and show how different the composition of the bacterial community is when compared across the different genera. Our data reveal that Colobopsis (species: Co. riehlii) and Camponotus (species: Ca. floridanus and Ca. planatus) have distinct microbiota, and we were able to verify that the identity of the species contributes more to the bacterial diversity. We also demonstrated that there were no significant differences between colonies of the same species (Camponotus planatus), and between stages of development from different colonies. We did find that some developmental stages have distinct bacteria, confirming that each stage of development could have a specific microbiota. Our results show species are one of the factors that shape the bacterial community in these Camponotini ants. Additional studies of the intra-colonial microbiome of other hosts and across development may reveal additional clues about the function and importance of bacteria in colony recognition, individual and colony health, and nutritional upgrading."
https://openalex.org/W2769684631,"Ungulate mortality profiles are commonly used to study Neanderthal subsistence strategies. To assess the hunting strategies used by Neanderthals, we studied the ages at death of the cervids and equids found in levels E, H, I, Ja, Jb, K, L and M of the Abric Romaní sequence. These levels date between 43.2 ± 1.1 ka BP (14C AMS) and 54.5 ± 1.7 ka BP (U-series). The degree of eruption and development of the teeth and their wear stages were used to determine the ages of these animals at death, and mortality profiles were constructed using these data. The equids display prime dominated profiles in all of the analyzed levels, whereas the cervids display variable profiles. These results suggest that the Neanderthals of Abric Romaní employed both selective and non-selective hunting strategies. The selective strategy focused on the hunting of prime adults and generated prime dominated profiles. On the other hand, non-selective strategies, involved the consumption of animals of variable ages, resulting in catastrophic profiles. It is likely that in the selective hunting events were conducted using selective ambushes in which it was possible to select specific prey animals. On the other hand, encounter hunting or non-selective ambush hunting may have also been used at times, based on the abundances of prey animals and encounter rates. Specific hunting strategies would have been developed accordance with the taxa and the age of the individual to be hunted. The hunting groups most likely employed cooperative hunting techniques, especially in the capture of large animals. Thus, it is not possible to uniquely associate a single mortality profile with the predation tactics of Neanderthals at Abric Romaní."
https://openalex.org/W2768561243,"Distal metastasis of luminal breast cancer is frequent and incurable, yet the metastasis mechanisms are poorly understood. Estrogen, even at postmenopausal concentrations, suppresses invasiveness of luminal breast cancer cells through the estrogen receptor (ER). Invasive tumors overexpress the short progesterone receptor A (PR-A) isoform. Even at postmenopausal concentrations, progesterone activates PR-A, inducing invasiveness by counteracting estrogen’s effects, particularly when cells are hypersensitized to progesterone by PR-A overexpression. To interrogate the role of this cross-talk in metastasis, we investigated selective cross-talk mechanisms of PR-A with ER. We developed a quantitative PCR-based lymph node infiltration assay to address the slowness of metastasis of tumor xenografts. We found that 15 microRNAs (miRNAs) are regulated by progesterone via PR-A, but not the longer PR-B isoform, with increased progesterone sensitivity when PR-A was overexpressed. Two of these miRNAs whose induction (miR-92a-3p) or repression (miR-26b-5p) by estrogen was suppressed by progesterone plus PR-A were critical for the PR-A–ER cross-talk causing a gene-regulatory pattern of invasiveness and metastasis and complete rescue of invasiveness in vitro. Constitutive expression of miR-92a-3p or inhibition of miR-26b-5p profoundly suppressed metastasis. Finally, in primary breast tumors, PR-A expression was correlated negatively with miR-92a-3p expression and positively with miR-26b-5p expression. Therefore, hormonal cross-talk of PR-A with ER is probably a fundamental mechanism that enables metastasis of luminal breast cancer. Moreover, miRNA biomarkers of hyperactive PR-A may help predict metastatic potential of luminal breast tumors. Further, miR-92a-3p and miR-26b-5p may reveal target pathways for selective intervention to suppress hormone-regulated metastasis, both pre- and postmenopause.

https://openalex.org/W2769396075,"As a sensitive signaling system, the mitotic checkpoint ensures faithful chromosome segregation by delaying anaphase onset even when a single kinetochore is unattached to mitotic spindle microtubules. The key signal amplification reaction for the checkpoint is the conformational conversion of open mitotic arrest deficient 2 (O-MAD2) into closed MAD2 (C-MAD2). The reaction has been suggested to be catalyzed by an unusual catalyst, a MAD1:C-MAD2 tetramer, but how the catalysis is executed and regulated remains elusive. Here, we report that in addition to the well-characterized middle region of MAD1 containing the MAD2-interaction motif (MIM), both N- and C-terminal domains (NTD and CTD) of MAD1 also contribute to mitotic checkpoint signaling. Unlike the MIM, which stably associated only with C-MAD2, the NTD and CTD in MAD1 surprisingly bound both O- and C-MAD2, suggesting that these two domains interact with both substrates and products of the O-to-C conversion. MAD1NTD and MAD1CTD also interacted with each other and with the MPS1 protein kinase, which phosphorylated both NTD and CTD. This phosphorylation decreased the NTD:CTD interaction and also CTD's interaction with MPS1. Of note, mutating the phosphorylation sites in the MAD1CTD, including Thr-716, compromised MAD2 binding and the checkpoint responses. We further noted that Ser-610 and Tyr-634 also contribute to the mitotic checkpoint signaling. Our results have uncovered that the MAD1NTD and MAD1CTD directly interact with each other and with MAD2 conformers and are regulated by MPS1 kinase, providing critical insights into mitotic checkpoint signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2769883458,"The chromate efflux pump encoding gene chrASO was identified on the chromosome of Shewanella oneidensis MR1. Although chrASO is expressed without chromate, its expression level increases when Cr(VI) is added. When deleted, the resulting mutant ΔchrASO exhibits a chromate sensitive phenotype compared to that of the wild-type strain. Interestingly, heterologous expression of chrASO in E. coli confers resistance to high chromate concentration. Moreover, expression of chrASO in S. oneidensis and E. coli significantly improves Cr(VI) reduction. This effect could result either from extracytoplasmic chromate reduction or from a better cell survival leading to enhanced Cr(VI) reduction."
https://openalex.org/W2768353368,"Background and aim Relapse and diabetes mellitus (DM) are major problems for the prognosis of autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP). We examined the prognosis of type 1 AIP after corticosteroid therapy (CST)-induced remission in terms of relapse and DM. Methods The study enrolled 82 patients diagnosed with type 1 AIP who achieved remission with CST. We retrospectively evaluated the relapse rate in terms of the administration period of CST, clinical factors associated with relapse, and the temporal change in glucose tolerance. Results During follow-up, 32 patients (39.0%) experienced relapse. There was no significant clinical factor that could predict relapse before beginning CST. AIP patients who ceased CST within 2 or 3 years experienced significantly earlier relapse than those who had the continuance of CST (p = 0.050 or p = 0.020). Of the 37 DM patients, 15 patients (40.5%) had pre-existing DM, 17 (45.9%) showed new-onset DM, and 5 (13.5%) developed CST-induced DM. Patients with new-onset DM were significantly more likely to show improvement (p = 0.008) than those with pre-existing DM. Conclusions It was difficult to predict relapse of AIP based on clinical parameters before beginning CST. Relapse was likely to occur within 3 years after the beginning of CST and maintenance of CST for at least 3 years reduced the risk of relapse. The early initiation of CST for AIP with impaired glucose tolerance is desirable because pre-existing DM is refractory to CST."
https://openalex.org/W2769564806,"Dividing attention across two tasks performed simultaneously usually results in impaired performance on one or both tasks. Most studies have found no difference in the dual-task cost of dividing attention in rested and sleep-deprived states. We hypothesized that, for a divided attention task that is highly cognitively-demanding, performance would show greater impairment during exposure to sleep deprivation. A group of 30 healthy males aged 21-30 years was exposed to 40 h of continuous wakefulness in a laboratory setting. Every 2 h, subjects completed a divided attention task comprising 3 blocks in which an auditory Go/No-Go task was 1) performed alone (single task); 2) performed simultaneously with a visual Go/No-Go task (dual task); and 3) performed simultaneously with both a visual Go/No-Go task and a visually-guided motor tracking task (triple task). Performance on all tasks showed substantial deterioration during exposure to sleep deprivation. A significant interaction was observed between task load and time since wake on auditory Go/No-Go task performance, with greater impairment in response times and accuracy during extended wakefulness. Our results suggest that the ability to divide attention between multiple tasks is impaired during exposure to sleep deprivation. These findings have potential implications for occupations that require multi-tasking combined with long work hours and exposure to sleep loss."
https://openalex.org/W2768376248,"Phosphotyrosine (pTyr)-dependent signaling is critical for many cellular processes. It is highly dynamic, as signal output depends not only on phosphorylation and dephosphorylation rates but also on the rates of binding and dissociation of effectors containing phosphotyrosine-dependent binding modules such as Src homology 2 (SH2) and phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domains. Previous in vitro studies suggested that binding of SH2 and PTB domains can enhance protein phosphorylation by protecting the sites bound by these domains from phosphatase-mediated dephosphorylation. To test whether this occurs in vivo, we used the binding of growth factor receptor bound 2 (GRB2) to phosphorylated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) as a model system. We analyzed the effects of SH2 domain overexpression on protein tyrosine phosphorylation by quantitative Western and far-Western blotting, mass spectrometry, and computational modeling. We found that SH2 overexpression results in a significant, dose-dependent increase in EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation, particularly of sites corresponding to the binding specificity of the overexpressed SH2 domain. Computational models using experimentally determined EGFR phosphorylation and dephosphorylation rates, and pTyr–EGFR and GRB2 concentrations, recapitulated the experimental findings. Surprisingly, both modeling and biochemical analyses suggested that SH2 domain overexpression does not result in a major decrease in the number of unbound phosphorylated SH2 domain–binding sites. Our results suggest that signaling via SH2 domain binding is buffered over a relatively wide range of effector concentrations and that SH2 domain proteins with overlapping binding specificities are unlikely to compete with one another for phosphosites in vivo."

Although these mutations lead to modulation of their chaperone activity in vitro, the in vivo functions of αB-crystallin in the maintenance of both lens transparency and muscle integrity remain unclear. This lack of information has hindered a mechanistic understanding of these diseases. To better define the functional roles of αB-crystallin, we generated loss-of-function zebrafish mutant lines by utilizing the CRISPR/Cas9 system to specifically disrupt the two αB-crystallin genes, αBa and αBb. We observed lens abnormalities in the mutant lines of both genes, and the penetrance of the lens phenotype was higher in αBa than αBb mutants. This finding is in contrast with the lack of a phenotype previously reported in αB-crystallin knock-out mice and suggests that the elevated chaperone activity of the two zebrafish orthologs is critical for lens development. Besides its key role in the lens, we uncovered another critical role for αB-crystallin in providing stress tolerance to the heart. The αB-crystallin mutants exhibited hypersusceptibility to develop pericardial edema when challenged by crowding stress or exposed to elevated cortisol stress, both of which activate glucocorticoid receptor signaling.

https://openalex.org/W2768218877,"Background and objective Adequate iodine status and normal thyroid hormone synthesis are important for optimal child development. In this study, we explored whether young children’s developmental status is associated with thyroid dysfunction in an area of chronic excessive iodine exposure. Methods We included 298 children between 18 and 48 months of age residing in Algerian refugee camps. Early child development was measured using the Ages and Stages Questionnaires, third edition (ASQ-3), consisting of five domains: Communication, Gross Motor, Fine Motor, Problem Solving and Personal-Social. Due to poor discriminatory ability in the Gross Motor domain, the total ASQ-3 scores were calculated both including and excluding this domain. Urinary iodine concentration (UIC), thyroid hormones (TSH, FT3 and FT4), thyroid antibodies and serum thyroglobulin (Tg) were measured. Results The median UIC was 451.6 μg/L, and approximately 72% of the children had a UIC above 300 μg/L. Furthermore, 14% had thyroid disturbances, of whom 10% had TSH outside the reference range. Children with thyroid disturbances and TSH outside the reference ranges had lower odds of being among the 66% highest total ASQ scores, with adjusted odds ratios (95% CI) of 0.46 (0.23, 0.93) and 0.42 (0.19, 0.94), respectively. Conclusion We found an association between thyroid dysfunction and poorer developmental status among children with excessive iodine intake. The high iodine intake may have caused the thyroid dysfunction and hence the delayed developmental status; however, other influential factors cannot be excluded. Optimal child development is important for a sustainable future. With iodine excess being an increasing problem globally, this subject should be further explored."
https://openalex.org/W2770260091,"The acetylcholine-activated inward rectifier potassium current (IKACh) is constitutively active in persistent atrial fibrillation (AF). We tested the hypothesis that the blocking of IKACh with the small molecule chloroquine terminates persistent AF. We used a sheep model of tachypacing-induced, persistent AF, molecular modeling, electrophysiology, and structural biology approaches. The 50% inhibition/inhibitory concentration of IKACh block with chloroquine, measured by patch clamp, was 1 µM. In optical mapping of sheep hearts with persistent AF, 1 µM chloroquine restored sinus rhythm. Molecular modeling suggested that chloroquine blocked the passage of a hydrated potassium ion through the intracellular domain of Kir3.1 (a molecular correlate of IKACh) by interacting with residues D260 and F255, in proximity to I228, Q227, and L299. 1H 15N heteronuclear single-quantum correlation of purified Kir3.1 intracellular domain confirmed the modeling results. F255, I228, Q227, and L299 underwent significant chemical-shift perturbations upon drug binding. We then crystallized and solved a 2.5 Å X-ray structure of Kir3.1 with F255A mutation. Modeling of chloroquine binding to the mutant channel suggested that the drug's binding to the pore becomes off centered, reducing its ability to block a hydrated potassium ion. Patch clamp validated the structural and modeling data, where the F255A and D260A mutations significantly reduced IKACh block by chloroquine. With the use of numerical and structural biology approaches, we elucidated the details of how a small molecule could block an ion channel and exert antiarrhythmic effects. Chloroquine binds the IKACh channel at a site formed by specific amino acids in the ion-permeation pathway, leading to decreased IKACh and the subsequent termination of AF.— Takemoto, Y., Slough, D.

Findings Twenty-eight (29%) of 98 women who took part in a large study of trafficking survivors reported one or more pregnancies while trafficked, whose data are reported here. Twelve (42.8%) of these women reported at least one termination of pregnancy while in the trafficking situation and 25 (89.3%) experienced some form of mental health disorder. Nineteen (67.9%) women experienced pre-trafficking physical abuse and 9 (32.%) sexual abuse. A quarter of women were trafficked for sexual exploitation, six for domestic servitude and two for manual labour. Survivors and clinicians described service challenges, including restrictions placed on women’s movements by traffickers, poor knowledge on how to access maternity care, poor understanding of healthcare entitlements and concerns about confidentiality. Maternity care clinicians recognised potential indicators of trafficking, but considered training would help them identify and respond to victims. Main limitations include that findings reflect women who had exited the trafficking situation, however as some had only recently exited the trafficking situation, difficulties with recall were likely to be low. Conclusions More than one in four women became pregnant while trafficked, indicating that maternity services offer an important contact point for identification and care. Given the prevalence of sexual exploitation and abuse among trafficking survivors, clinicians should ensure antenatal care and screening for sexually transmitted infections can be readily accessed by women. Clinicians require specialised training alongside designated pathways and protocols with clear referral options to ensure confidential maternity care tailored to each woman’s needs."
https://openalex.org/W2770258072,"Myelin abnormalities are increasingly being recognized as an important component of a number of neurologic developmental disorders. The integration of many signaling pathways and cell types are critical for correct myelinogenesis. The PI3-K and mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathways have been found to play key roles. mTOR is found within two distinct complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2. mTORC1 activity has been shown to play a major role during myelination, while the role of mTORC2 is not yet well understood. To determine the role of mTORC2 signaling in myelinogenesis, we generated a mouse lacking the critical mTORC2 component Rictor in oligodendrocyte precursors (OPCs). Targeted deletion of Rictor in these cells decreases and delays the expression of myelin related proteins and reduces the size of cerebral white matter tracts. This is developmentally manifest as a transient reduction in myelinated axon density and g-ratio. OPC cell number is reduced at birth without detectable change in proliferation with proportional reductions in mature oligodendrocyte number at P15. The total number of oligodendrocytes as well as extent of myelination, does improve over time. Adult conditional knock-out (CKO) animals do not demonstrate a behavioral phenotype likely due in part to preserved axonal conduction velocities. These data support and extend prior studies demonstrating an important but transient contribution of mTORC2 signaling to myelin development."
https://openalex.org/W2769665170,"Lentil is a major cool-season grain legume grown in South Asia, West Asia, and North Africa. Populations in developing countries of these regions have micronutrient deficiencies; therefore, breeding programs should focus more on improving the micronutrient content of food. In the present study, a set of 96 diverse germplasm lines were evaluated at three different locations in India to examine the variation in iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn) concentration and identify simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers that associate with the genetic variation. The genetic variation among genotypes of the association mapping (AM) panel was characterized using a genetic distance-based and a general model-based clustering method. The model-based analysis identified six subpopulations, which satisfactorily explained the genetic structure of the AM panel. AM analysis identified three SSRs (PBALC 13, PBALC 206, and GLLC 563) associated with grain Fe concentration explaining 9% to 11% of phenotypic variation and four SSRs (PBALC 353, SSR 317–1, PLC 62, and PBALC 217) were associated with grain Zn concentration explaining 14%, to 21% of phenotypic variation. These identified SSRs exhibited consistent performance across locations. These candidate SSRs can be used in marker-assisted genetic improvement for developing Fe and Zn fortified lentil varieties. Favorable alleles and promising genotypes identified in this study can be utilized for lentil biofortification."
https://openalex.org/W2770743626,"Background Unbalanced dietary intake and insufficient physical activity (PA) have been recognized as risk factors for metabolic syndrome (MetS). We aimed to examine the independent and combined effects of fruit and vegetables (FV) intake and PA on MetS. Methods and findings A cross-sectional survey was conducted among residents of China in 2009, with fasting blood samples collected. Participants were divided into sufficient/insufficient FV intake and adequate/ inadequate PA groups according to self-reported questionnaires. MetS was defined using the NCEP-ATPIII criteria. The difference of individual MetS components was compared across different PA or FV groups. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess association between FV/PA and the risk of MetS. A total of 7424 adults were included in the current study. MetS was prevalent in 28.7% of participants, with 24.7% and 32.9% in male and female, respectively. Compared with those with inadequate PA and insufficient FV intake, participants with the combination of adequate PA and sufficient FV intake had the lowest risk of MetS (OR = 0.69,95%CI: 0.59–0.82), following by the group with adequate PA time but insufficient FV intake (OR = 0.74, 95%CI:0.65–0.83). Conclusion Findings of the current study show that the combination of sufficient FV intake and adequate PA was significantly associated with reduced MetS risk among adult residents of China."
https://openalex.org/W2768859792,"Objectives Post-traumatic intramedullary myelopathies and cavitations are well described lesions following spinal cord injury (SCI) in humans and have been described in histopathological evaluations in dogs. Human intramedullary myelopathies/cavitations are associated with severe initial SCI and deterioration of clinical signs. Canine intervertebral disc extrusions share similarities with SCI in humans. In this descriptive study, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in spinal cords of dogs suffering from chronic post-traumatic myelopathies, including cavitations, are elucidated. An additional aim of the study was to compare diagnostic imaging and histopathological findings and identify similarities between human and canine chronic post-traumatic spinal cord lesions. Methods Thirty-seven dogs with thoracolumbar SCI and one or more 3Tesla MRI investigations more than 3 weeks after SCI were included. Extent of intramedullary lesions and particularly cavitations were evaluated and measured in sagittal and transverse MRI planes. These data were compared with clinical data. Results A total of 91.9% of study patients developed chronic intramedullary lesions, and 86.5% developed intramedullary cavitations. Paraplegia without deep pain perception at initial examination was significantly associated with longer chronic myelopathies/cavitations (P = 0.002/P = 0.008), and with larger maximal cross-sectional area (mCSA) of the lesions (P = 0.041/0.005). In addition, a non-ambulatory status after decompressive surgery was also associated with the development of longer intramedullary lesions/cavitations (P<0.001) and larger lesion mCSA (P<0.001/P = 0.012). All dogs with negative outcome developed myelopathies/cavitations. In the group of 21 dogs with positive outcome, 3 did not develop any myelopathies, and 5 did not develop cavitations. Conclusions Development of chronic intramedullary lesions/cavitations are common findings in canine SCI. Extensive chronic intramedullary lesions/cavitations reflect a severe initial SCI and negative clinical outcome. This supports the hypothesis that chronic spinal cord changes following SCI in humans share similarities with canine chronic spinal cord changes after spontaneous intervertebral disc extrusion."
https://openalex.org/W2768285034,"Cardiogenesis is a tightly controlled biological process required for formation of a functional heart. The transcription factor Foxc1 not only plays a crucial role in outflow tract development in mice, but is also involved in cardiac structure formation and normal function in humans. However, the molecular mechanisms by which Foxc1 controls cardiac development remain poorly understood. Previously, we reported that zebrafish embryos deficient in foxc1a, an ortholog of mammalian Foxc1, display pericardial edemas and die 9–10 days postfertilization. To further investigate Foxc1a's role in zebrafish cardiogenesis and identify its downstream target genes during early heart development, we comprehensively analyzed the cardiovascular phenotype of foxc1a-null zebrafish embryos. Our results confirmed that foxc1a-null mutants exhibit disrupted cardiac morphology, structure, and function. Performing transcriptome analysis on the foxc1a mutants, we found that the expression of the cardiac progenitor marker gene nkx2.5 was significantly decreased, but the expression of germ layer–patterning genes was unaffected. Dual-fluorescence in situ hybridization assays revealed that foxc1a and nkx2.5 are co-expressed in the anterior lateral plate mesoderm at the somite stage. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and promoter truncation assays disclosed that Foxc1a regulates nkx2.5 expression via direct binding to two noncanonical binding sites in the proximal nkx2.5 promoter. Moreover, functional rescue experiments revealed that developmental stage–specific nkx2.5 overexpression partially rescues the cardiac defects of the foxc1a-null embryos. Taken together, our results indicate that during zebrafish cardiogenesis, Foxc1a is active directly upstream of nkx2.5."

Found to be crucial in this mass determination was the cell position along the length of the cantilever. Moreover, calculations including cells positions on the cantilever provide a threefold better degree of accuracy than those which assume uniform mass distribution. We have also examined the influence of storage time on the single cell mass. Our results show that after 6 months there is an increase in the average mass of a single yeast cell."
https://openalex.org/W2769630530,"The Early Pleistocene archaeological evidence from the fluvio-lacustrine sequence of the Nihewan Basin (North China) offers an excellent opportunity to explore early human evolution and behavior in a temperate setting in East Asia, following the earliest ‘Out of Africa’. Here we present the first comprehensive study of the Feiliang (FL) site, with emphasis on the archaeological sequence, site integrity, and stone artifact assemblages. Magnetostratigraphic dating results show that early humans occupied the site ca. 1.2 Ma. Archaeological deposits were buried rapidly in primary context within shallow lake margin deposits, with only minor post-depositional disturbance from relatively low energy hydraulic forces. The FL lithic assemblage is characterized by a core and flake, Oldowan-like or Mode 1 technology, with a low degree of standardization, expedient knapping techniques, and casually retouched flakes. The bone assemblage suggests that hominin occupation of the FL site was in an open habitat of temperate grassland with areas of steppe and water. The main features of the FL assemblage are discussed in the context of the early Pleistocene archaeology of Nihewan, for which an assessment of current and future research is also presented."
https://openalex.org/W2769196890,"Caribbean seagrass habitats provide food and protection for reef-associated juvenile fish. The invasive seagrass Halophila stipulacea is rapidly altering these seascapes. Since its arrival in the Caribbean in 2002, H. stipulacea has colonized and displaced native seagrasses, but the function of this invasive seagrass as a juvenile fish habitat remains unknown. To compare diversity, community structure, and abundance of juvenile fish between H. stipulacea and native seagrass beds, fish traps were deployed in four nearshore bays around St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands. Traps were deployed in Frenchman, Lindbergh, and Sprat Bays for 24 h intervals in patches of bare sand, patches of H. stipulacea and patches of the native Caribbean seagrasses Thalassia testudinum and Syringodium filiforme. Traps were then deployed in Brewers Bay for 12 h intervals in stands of H. stipulacea and S. filiforme. Relative and total abundances of juvenile fish, identified at least to family, were compared across treatment habitats for each trap deployment period. The catch from H. stipulacea, compared to native seagrasses, comprised a greater abundance of nocturnal carnivores Lutjanus synagris (family Lutjanidae) and Haemulon flavolineatum (family Haemulidae). Additionally, the herbivore species Sparisoma aurofrenatum (family Labridae) and Acanthurus bahianus (family Acanthuridae) and the diurnal carnivore species Pseudopeneus maculatus (family Mullidae) were relatively scarce in H. stipulacea. The catch from sand was much smaller, compared to vegetated habitats, and comprised only L. synagris, H. flavolineatum, and H. aurolineatum. These results provide evidence of reduced family diversity and altered juvenile fish assemblages in H. stipulacea, driven by an abundance of some nocturnal carnivores and scarcity of herbivores and diurnal carnivores. The findings from the present work underpin the need for further investigation and mitigation of this invasion, particularly where H. stipulacea is driving seascape-alterations of key juvenile fish habitats."
https://openalex.org/W2769692994,"After a large-scale natural disaster, demand for social welfare services increases, and the mental health of local social welfare workers becomes a matter of great concern because of their dual role as support providers and disaster survivors. We examined whether work-related social stressors, including criticism by community people and poor workplace communication, were associated with increased risk of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, or psychological distress 20–22 months after the Great East Japan Earthquake (GEJE; March 11, 2011) in local social welfare workers. Demographic characteristics, disaster-related risk factors (near-death experience, dead/missing family members, loss of housing), and work-related social risk factors (criticism, lack of communication) were obtained 20–22 months after the GEJE from 822 local workers. Questionnaires measured PTSD, depression, and psychological stress. Bivariate and multivariate regression analyses were applied. More local social welfare workers suffered from mental health problems than would be expected. Criticism by community people was significantly associated with probable PTSD and high psychological distress (adjusted odds ratio = 2.31 and 2.55, respectively). Furthermore, lack of workplace communication was associated with probable PTSD, depression, and high psychological distress (adjusted odds ratio = 3.97, 4.27, and 4.65, respectively). Almost 2 years after the disaster, local relief workers still suffered from mental health problems. Because post-disaster work-related social stressors constitute risk factors for these mental health problems, measures to improve working conditions and prevent and treat mental disorders should be a priority."
https://openalex.org/W2770037689,"Although the cancer stem cell (CSC) hypothesis has been around for many years, the reliability of cell-surface markers to classify CSCs has remained debatable. The finding that cancerous cells are significantly more deformable than healthy ones has provided motivation to consider mechanical properties as a possible biomarker for stemness. In this study, using the micropipette aspiration technique, mechanical properties of multiple breast cancer cell lines were investigated and correlated with breast cancer stem cell (BCSC) marker, CD44+/CD24-/ALDH1+. The results indicated that Hs578T and MDA-MB-231 cell lines with CD44+/CD24-/ALDH1+ phenotype were significantly more deformable than the MDA-MB-468 cell line, which did not express the BCSC marker. The BT-20 cell line with intermediate deformability did not express any CD44+/CD24- phenotype, but it expressed aldehyde dehydrogenase-1 activity. In addition, more-deformable cell lines were found to roll with shear-independent velocities on E-selectin-coated substrates in a parallel-plate flow chamber, which might be a mediating factor for firm adhesion of CSCs to endothelium during metastasis. Our results indicate that rheological properties can be considered as a biomechanical marker in addition to, or as a complement of, surface markers to find more-definitive evidence of CSC characteristics within tumors.-Mohammadalipour, A., Burdick, M.

https://openalex.org/W2770652316,"Lactate and ethanol (EtOH) were determined in cell culture medium (CCM) of immortalized hippocampal neurons (HN9.10e cell line) before and after incubation with Thallium (Tl). This cell line is a reliable, in vitro model of one of the most vulnerable regions of central nervous system. Cells were incubated for 48 h with three different single Tl doses: 1, 10, 100 μg/L (corresponding to 4.9, 49 and 490 nM, respectively). After 48 h, neurons were “reperfused” with fresh CCM every 24/48 h until 7 days after the treatment and the removed CCM was collected and analysed. Confocal microscopy was employed to observe morphological changes. EtOH was determined by head space—solid phase microextraction -gas chromatography -mass spectrometry (HS-SPME-GCMS), lactate by RP-HPLC with UV detection. Tl exposure had significant effects on neuronal growth rate and morphology. The damage degree was dose-dependent. In not exposed cells, EtOH concentration was 0.18 ± 0.013 mM, which represents about 5% of lactate concentration (3.4 ± 0.10 mM). After Tl exposure lactate and EtOH increased. In CCM of 100 and 10 μg/L Tl-treated cells, lactate increased 24 h after reperfusion up to 2 and 3.3 times the control value, respectively. In CCM of 10 and 100 μg/L Tl-treated cells 24 h after reperfusion, EtOH increased up to 0.3 and 0.58 mmol/L. respectively. These results are consistent with significant alterations in energy metabolism, despite the low doses of Tl employed and the relatively short incubation time."
https://openalex.org/W2769940739,"DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are less frequent than single-strand breaks but have more harmful consequences on cell survival and physiology. Homologous recombination (HR) and nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) are the two main pathways that are responsible for DSB repair in eukaryotic cells, but their importance for the preservation of genome stability in totipotent blastomeres of early developing embryos has not been determined. In this study, we observed that the chemical inhibition of HR or both pathways, but not NHEJ alone, increased the number of DSBs, reduced embryo development to the blastocyst stage, and resulted in embryos with higher proportions of apoptotic cells. Targeted knockdown of ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) and ATR (ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related; HR regulators) and DNA-dependent protein kinase (NHEJ regulator) mRNAs revealed that the attenuation of HR or both HR and NHEJ regulators severely impaired blastocyst formation and quality. Attenuation of ATM alone resulted in a higher incidence of DSBs, lower development and embryo quality, and increased mRNA abundance of genes that are involved in either repair pathway. These findings indicate that HR is the main pathway responsible for the promotion of DSB repair in early developing embryos, and that ATM seems to be more important than ATR in the regulation of the HR pathway in mammalian embryos.-Bohrer, R. C., Dicks, N., Gutierrez, K., Duggavathi, R., Bordignon, V. Double-strand DNA breaks are mainly repaired by the homologous recombination pathway in early developing swine embryos."
https://openalex.org/W2770341144,"Non-commercial forests represent important habitats for the maintenance of biodiversity and ecosystem function in China, yet no studies have explored the patterns and determinants of plant biodiversity in these human dominated landscapes. Here we test the influence of (1) forest type (pine, mixed, and broad-leaved), (2) disturbance history, and (3) environmental factors, on tree species richness and composition in 600 study plots in eastern China. In total, we found 143 species in 53 families of woody plants, with a number of species rare and endemic in the study region. Species richness in mixed forest and broad-leaved forest was higher than that in pine forest, and was higher in forests with less disturbance. Species composition was influenced by environment factors in different ways in different forest types, with important variables including elevation, soil depth and aspect. Surprisingly, we found little effect of forest age after disturbance on species composition. Most non-commercial forests in this region are dominated by species poor pine forests and mixed young forests. As such, our results highlight the importance of broad-leaved forests for regional plant biodiversity conservation. To increase the representation of broad-leaved non-commercial forests, specific management practices such as thinning of pine trees could be undertaken."
https://openalex.org/W2769079269,"Previous cohort studies have demonstrated a positive association between diabetes mellitus (DM) and colorectal cancer (CRC). However, there are few comparisons between DM groups categorized by fasting glucose level. This study examined associations between diabetes as defined by fasting glucose level and self-reported history of DM and CRC risk among Korean adults. Data from the Korean Multi-center Cancer Cohort between 1993 and 2005 were analyzed. The study population comprised 14,570 participants aged 20 years or older. Participants were followed until December 31, 2012 (median follow-up: 11.9 years). Among participants with high fasting glucose (≥126mg/dL), the risk of developing CRC was significantly higher (HR: 1.51 [1.02-2.25]) than among participants with low fasting glucose (<126mg/dL). Risk was not significantly higher among participants with self-reported history of DM (HR: 1.34 [0.78-2.31]). When both fasting glucose and history of DM were considered together, the risk of CRC among participants with both high fasting glucose and history of DM was 54% (HR: 1.54 [0.97-2.43]), and the risk of CRC among participants with high fasting glucose and no history of DM was 50% (HR: 1.50 [0.73-3.05]). When the first 5 years of follow-up were excluded, among participants with high fasting glucose, the risk of developing CRC was significantly higher (HR: 1.61 [1.02-2.56]) than among participants with low fasting glucose. Risk of CRC was also significantly higher among participants with high fasting glucose and no history of DM (HR: 1.69 [1.01-2.84]). High fasting glucose and self-reported history of DM were associated with increased risk of CRC in this Korean population."
https://openalex.org/W2769947127,"A comparative metabolomic analysis was conducted on recombinant Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain producing β-carotene and the parent strain cultivated with glucose as carbon source using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) based approach. The results showed that most of the central intermediates associated with amino acids, carbohydrates, glycolysis and TCA cycle intermediates (acetic acid, glycerol, citric acid, pyruvic acid and succinic acid), fatty acids, ergosterol and energy metabolites were produced in a lower amount in recombinant strain, as compared to the parent strain. To increase β-carotene production in recombinant strain, a strategy that exogenous addition of acetate (10 g/l) in exponential phase was developed, which could enhance most intracellular metabolites levels and result in 39.3% and 14.2% improvement of β-carotene concentration and production, respectively, which was accompanied by the enhancement of acetyl-CoA, fatty acids, ergosterol and ATP contents in cells. These results indicated that the amounts of intracellular metabolites in engineered strain are largely consumed by carotenoid formation. Therefore, maintaining intracellular metabolites pool at normal levels is essential for carotenoid biosynthesis. To relieve this limitation, rational supplementation of acetate could be a potential way because it can partially restore the levels of intracellular metabolites and improve the production of carotenoid compounds in recombinant S. cerevisiae."
https://openalex.org/W2770346493,"Background Recently, it was shown that interleukin-17A (IL-17A) is involved in the pathophysiology of reperfusion injury and associated with infarct size (IS) in experimental models of myocardial infarction. Our aim was to evaluate whether the IL-17A serum level and the IL-17A active fraction was correlated with IS in humans. Methods 101 patients presenting with a ST-elevated Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) referred for primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) and 10 healthy controls were included. For each participant, blood samples at admission (H0) and 4 hours after admission (H4) were collected. IL-17A serum levels were assessed using ELISA and the active fraction was assessed with a functional test. IS was determined by peak troponin and peak CK levels for every patient and by contrast-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance (ce-CMR) for 20 patients. Results The IL-17A serum level was significantly increased in STEMI patients compared to healthy controls, (0.9 pg/mL IQR [0.0–3.2] at H0 and 1.0 pg/mL IQR [0.2–2.8] at H4 versus 0.2 pg/mL IQR [0.0–0.7] for healthy controls; p<0.005). At either time points, IL-17A levels did not correlate with IS as measured by peak troponin, peak CK pr ce-CMR. Also, no correlation was found between the active fraction of IL-17A and IS. Conclusion Serum IL-17A level is significantly increased in patients at the early phase of acute MI compared to healthy controls. However, the level of IL-17A in the early hours after reperfusion does not correlate with IS."
https://openalex.org/W2769383319,"Humic substances (HS) are the largest constituent of soil organic matter and are considered as a key component of the terrestrial ecosystem. HS may facilitate the transport of organic and inorganic molecules, as well as the sorption interactions with environmentally relevant proteins such as prions. Prions enter the environment through shedding from live hosts, facilitating a sustained incidence of animal prion diseases such as Chronic Wasting Disease and scrapie in cervid and ovine populations, respectively. Changes in prion structure upon environmental exposure may be significant as they can affect prion infectivity and disease pathology. Despite its relevance, the mechanisms of prion interaction with HS are still not completely understood. The goal of this work is to advance a structural-level picture of the encapsulation of recombinant, non-infectious, prion protein (PrP) into different natural HS. We observed that PrP precipitation upon addition of HS is mainly driven by a mechanism of “salting-out” whereby PrP molecules are rapidly removed from the solution and aggregate in insoluble adducts with humic molecules. Importantly, this process does not alter the protein folding since insoluble PrP retains its α-helical content when in complex with HS. The observed ability of HS to promote PrP insolubilization without altering its secondary structure may have potential relevance in the context of “prion ecology”. These results suggest that soil organic matter interacts with prions possibly without altering the protein structures. This may facilitate prions preservation from biotic and abiotic degradation leading to their accumulation in the environment."
https://openalex.org/W2770004495,"Four species of Devario are recorded from Bangladesh: D. aequipinnatus, D. anomalus, D. coxi, new species, and D. devario. Devario aequipinnatus has a wide distribution in northern India and Bangladesh. Devario coxi, from southeastern Bangladesh near Cox’s Bazar, differs from D. aequipinnatus in mtDNA (COI, p-distance 1.8%), colouration, proportional measurements, and meristics. The minor morphological differences and low frequency of overlapping meristics suggest relatively recent separation of D. coxi from other D. aequipinnatus. Devario anomalus occurs only in southeastern Bangladesh and is here reported from localities in addition to the type locality. It differs from the similar D. xyrops in adjacent Myanmar by slender body shape and by 2.3% p-distance in the COI gene. Specimens of D. anomalus from the Sangu River were found to have the mitochondrial genome of D. aequipinnatus from Bangladesh, but agree with other D. anomalus in the nuclear RAG1 gene. Devario devario has a wide distribution on the Indian Peninsula and border regions; in Bangladesh it is restricted in distribution to the Ganga, Brahmaputra, and Meghna drainages. Reports of D. assamensis and D. malabaricus from Bangladesh are misidentifications. Perilampus ostreographus M’Clelland, 1839, is tentatively synonymized with D. aequipinnatus. Phylogenetic analysis of 14 species of striped devarios based on the COI gene results in a polytomy with four unresolved clades. Devario deruptotalea from the Chindwin basin is the sister group of D. aequipinnatus+D. coxi. Devario devario is the sistergroup of D. xyrops+D. anomalus."
https://openalex.org/W2768262450,"QuantiFERON®-TB Gold in-tube (QFT-GIT) supernatants may be important samples for use in assessment of anti-tuberculosis (TB) antibodies when only limited volumes of blood can be collected and when a combination of antibody and cytokine measurements are required. These analytes, when used together, may also have the potential to differentiate active pulmonary TB (APTB) from latent TB infection (LTBI). However, few studies have explored the use of QFT-GIT supernatants for investigations of antibody responses. This study determined the correlation and agreement between anti-CFP-10 and anti-ESAT-6 antibody concentrations in QFT-GIT nil supernatant and serum pairs from 68 TB household contacts. We also explored the ability of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) specific antibodies, or ratios of antibody to interferon gamma (IFN-γ) in QFT-GIT supernatants, to differentiate 97 APTB cases from 58 individuals with LTBI. Sputum smear microscopy was used to define APTB, whereas the QFT-GIT and tuberculin skin test were used to define LTBI. There were strong and statistically significant correlations between anti-CFP-10 and anti-ESAT-6 antibodies in unstimulated QFT-GIT supernatants and sera (r = 0.89; p<0.0001 for both), and no significant differences in antibody concentration between them. Anti-CFP-10 & anti-ESAT-6 antibodies differentiated APTB from LTBI with sensitivities of 88.7% & 71.1% and specificities of 41.4% & 51.7% respectively. Anti-CFP-10 antibody/M.tb specific IFN-γ and anti-ESAT-6 antibody/M.tb specific IFN-γ ratios had sensitivities of 48.5% & 54.6% and specificities of 89.7% and 75.9% respectively. We conclude that QFT-GIT nil supernatants may be used in the place of sera when measuring antibody responses, reducing blood volumes needed for such investigations. Antibodies in QFT-GIT nil supernatants on their own discriminate APTB from LTBI with high sensitivity but have poor specificity, whereas the reverse is true when antibodies are used in combination with M.tb specific cytokines. Further antibody and antibody/cytokine combinations need to be explored to achieve better diagnostic accuracy."
https://openalex.org/W2769093901,"MF6p/FhHDM-1 is a small cationic heme-binding protein which is recognized by the monoclonal antibody (mAb) MF6, and abundantly present in parenchymal cells and secreted antigens of Fasciola hepatica. Orthologs of this protein (MF6p/HDMs) also exist in other causal agents of important foodborne trematodiasis, such as Clonorchis sinensis, Opisthorchis viverrini and Paragonimus westermani. Considering that MF6p/FhHDM-1 is relevant for heme homeostasis in Fasciola and was reported to have immunomodulatory properties, this protein is expected to be a useful target for vaccination. Thus, in this study we mapped the epitope recognized by mAb MF6 and evaluated its antigenicity in sheep. The sequence of the MF6p/FhHDM-1 ortholog from F. gigantica (MF6p/FgHDM-1) was also reported. By means of ELISA inhibitions with overlapping synthetic peptides, we determined that the epitope recognized by mAb MF6 is located within the C-terminal moiety of MF6p/FhHDM-1, which is the most conserved region of MF6p/HDMs. By immunoblotting analysis of parasite extracts and ELISA inhibitions with synthetic peptides we also determined that mAb MF6 reacted with the same intensity with F. hepatica and F. gigantica, and in decreasing order of intensity with C. sinensis, O.viverrini and P. westermani orthologs. On the contrary, mAb MF6 showed no reactivity against Dicrocoelium dendriticum and Schistosoma mansoni. The study of the recognition of peptides covering different regions of MF6p/FhHDM-1 by sera from immunized sheep revealed that the C-terminal moiety is the most antigenic, thus being of potential interest for vaccination. We also demonstrated that the production of antibodies to MF6p/FhHDM-1 in sheep infected by F. hepatica occurs relatively early and follows the same pattern as those produced against L-cathepsins."
https://openalex.org/W2769300106,"A growing number of babies are born with perinatal risk factors that may impair later development. These children are often assessed at 2 years to help predict outcome and direct support services. Executive function is an important predictor of academic achievement and behavior, but there are limited assessments of executive function in 2-year-olds and few have been tested in at-risk populations. Therefore, we developed a battery of four age-appropriate tasks to assess executive function in 2-year-olds. At 24 months’ corrected age 368 children completed tasks assessing attention, inhibition, working memory and cognitive flexibility. Scores on different tasks were weakly correlated, suggesting that they measured separate aspects of executive function, with combined scores for this cohort approximating a normal distribution. Significantly more boys (67%) than girls (57%) were unable to inhibit their behavior on the Snack Delay Task and girls (M = 3.24, SD = 2.4) had higher mean scores than boys (M = 2.7, SD = 2.7) on the Ducks and Buckets Reverse Categorization Task of working memory. Performance was significantly affected by family socioeconomic status. Mean scores were lower on all four individual tasks and on the global score of overall performance in children from a low household income (<$40,000) compared to those from medium ($40,001-$70,000) and high income households (>$70,001). Maternal education was only associated with scores on the working memory task and the global score; and a measure of neighborhood deprivation was only associated with scores on the two inhibitory tasks and the global score. Our findings confirm the feasibility of assessing executive function in 2-year-olds, and its ability to discriminate effects of socioeconomic status, a common confounder in child development research. Further development and standardization of this test battery comparing at-risk children with a normative population would provide a much-needed measure of executive function in early childhood."
https://openalex.org/W2770487820,"Correct detection of membrane currents under whole-cell patch–clamp conditions is limited by the transfer function of a recording system. The low-pass output filter of a recording amplifier alters the time course of membrane current and causes errors in relevant descriptors. To solve these problems, we developed a practical procedure for reconstruction of the time course of membrane currents based on deconvolution of recorded currents in frequency domain. The procedure was tested on membrane capacitance estimates from current responses to step voltage pulses. The reconstructed current responses, in contrast to original current records, could be described exactly by an adequate impedance model of a recorded cell. The reconstruction allowed to increase the accuracy and reliability of membrane capacitance measurements in wide range of cell sizes and to suppress the cross-talk errors well below the noise. Moreover, it allowed resolving the instabilities in recording conditions arising from parasitic capacitance and seal resistance variation. Complex tests on hardware models, on simulated data sets, and on living cells confirmed robustness and reliability of the deconvolution procedure. The aptitude of the method was demonstrated in isolated rat cardiac myocytes by recording of spontaneous vesicular events, by discerning the formation of a fusion pore, and by revealing artefacts due to unstable seal resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2770499285,"Skeletal myogenesis is a regulated process in which mononucleated cells, the myoblasts, undergo proliferation and differentiation. Upon differentiation, the cells align with each other, and subsequently fuse to form terminally differentiated multinucleated myotubes. Previous reports have identified the protein osteoglycin (Ogn) as an important component of the skeletal muscle secretome, which is expressed differentially during muscle development. However, the posttranscriptional regulation of Ogn by microRNAs during myogenesis is unknown. Bioinformatic analysis showed that miR-155 potentially targeted the Ogn transcript at the 3´-untranslated region (3´ UTR). In this study, we tested the hypothesis that miR-155 inhibits the expression of the Ogn to regulate skeletal myogenesis. C2C12 myoblast cells were cultured and miR-155 overexpression or Ogn knockdown was induced by transfection with miR-155 mimic, siRNA-Ogn, and negative controls with lipofectamine for 15 hours. Near confluence (80–90%), myoblasts were induced to differentiate myotubes in a differentiation medium. Luciferase assay was used to confirm the interaction between miR-155 and Ogn 3’UTR. RT-qPCR and Western blot analyses were used to confirm that the differential expression of miR-155 correlates with the differential expression of myogenic molecular markers (Myh2, MyoD, and MyoG) and inhibits Ogn protein and gene expression in myoblasts and myotubes. Myoblast migration and proliferation were assessed using Wound Healing and MTT assays. Our results show that miR-155 interacts with the 3’UTR Ogn region and decrease the levels of Ogn in myotubes. The overexpression of miR-155 increased MyoG expression, decreased myoblasts wound closure rate, and decreased Myh2 expression in myotubes. Moreover, Ogn knockdown reduced the expression levels of MyoD, MyoG, and Myh2 in myotubes. These results reveal a novel pathway in which miR-155 inhibits Ogn expression to regulate proliferation and differentiation of C2C12 myoblast cells."
https://openalex.org/W2769584436,"Podocyte malfunction is central to glomerular diseases and is marked by defective podocyte intercellular junctions and actin cytoskeletal dynamics. Podocytes share many morphologic features with neurons, so that similar sets of proteins appear to regulate cell process formation. One such protein is the tropomyosin-related kinase C (TrkC). TrkC deficiency in mice leads to proteinuria as a surrogate of defective kidney filter function. Activation of endogenous TrkC by its ligand neurotrophin-3 resulted in increased podocyte migration—a surrogate of podocyte actin dynamics in vivo. Employing a mutagenesis approach, we found that the Src homologous and collagen-like (Shc) binding site Tyr516 within the TrkC cytoplasmic domain was necessary for TrkC-induced migration of podocytes. TrkC activation led to a mobility shift of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome family verprolin-homologous protein (WAVE)-2 which is known to orchestrate Arp2/3 activation and actin polymerization. Chemical inactivation of Erk or mutagenesis of 2 of 4 known Erk target sites within WAVE2, Thr346 and Ser351, abolished the TrkC-induced WAVE2 mobility shift. Knockdown of WAVE2 by shRNA abolished TrkC-induced podocyte migration. In sum-mary, TrkC signals to the podocyte actin cytoskeleton to induce migration by phosphorylating WAVE2 Erk de-pendently. This signaling mechanism may be important for TrkC-mediated cytoskeletal dynamics in podocyte disease.—Gromnitza, S., Lepa, C., Weide, T., Schwab, A., Pavenst ädt, H., George, B.

https://openalex.org/W2769803622,"To determine if a high-fat diet (HF) from weaning would result in a pro-inflammatory state and affect joint cartilage, we fed male rats either HF or Chow diet post-weaning, and voluntary wheel exercise (EX) or cage only activity (SED) after 9 weeks of age. At 17 weeks body composition, plasma biomarkers and histomorphology scores of femoro-tibial cartilages of HF-SED, HF-EX, Chow-SED and Chow-EX groups were compared. Food intake and activity were not significantly different between groups. HF diet resulted in significantly higher weight gain, %fat, fat:lean ratio, and plasma leptin, insulin and TNFα concentrations, with significant interactions between diet and exercise. No abnormal features were detected in the hyaline articular cartilage or in the metaphyseal growth plate in all four groups. However, collagen type X- positive regions of retained epiphyseal growth cartilage (EGC) was present in all HF-fed animals and significantly greater than that observed in Chow-fed sedentary rats. Most lesions were located in the lateral posterior aspect of the tibia and/or femur. The severity of lesions was greater in HF-fed animals. Although exercise had a significantly greater effect in reducing adiposity and associated systemic inflammation in HF-fed rats, it had no effect on lesion incidence or severity. Lesion incidence was also significantly associated with indices of obesity and plasma markers of chronic inflammation. Clinically, EGC lesions induced by HF feeding in rats from very early in life, and possibly by insufficient activity, is typical of osteochondrosis in animals. Such lesions may be the precursor of juvenile osteochondritis dissecans requiring surgery in children/adolescents, conservative management of which could benefit from improved understanding of early changes in cellular and gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2768183243,"The present study aimed to investigate the reciprocal relations between experiential avoidance, stressor, and psychological stress response (which consist of anger, depression, anxiety, helplessness, and physical complaints). In this study, 688 Japanese junior high school students (353 boys, 334 girls, 1 unidentified; mean age 13.28 years) completed three waves of questionnaires on experiential avoidance, stressor, and psychological stress response, with one-week intervals between measurement waves. Results from cross-lagged panel analyses showed that experiential avoidance predicted subsequent stressor and psychological stress response. Furthermore, the stressor and psychological stress response influenced by prior experiential avoidance affected subsequent occurrence of experiential avoidance. The findings suggest that reciprocal relations exist among the variables, and that the interaction between experiential avoidance and psychological stress was possible in adolescents."
https://openalex.org/W2769333957,"Studies over the past three decades have shown that learning difficulties are not only determined by neurological disorders, but also by motivational and/or socio-cognitive factors Among these factors, implicit theories of intelligence (also referred to as conceptions, mindsets or beliefs about intelligence) are key elements. The belief that intelligence is fixed (entity theory), as opposed to malleable (incremental theory), is generally associated with negative teaching practices and poorer student outcomes, yet beliefs about the intelligence of individuals with intellectual disabilities have not received much attention. We propose the first study on conceptions of intelligence of persons with intellectual disabilities, here people with Down syndrome. Participants were 55 professionally qualified people working with individuals with intellectual disabilities and 81 adults from the community. We compared what both groups of participants believe about intelligence of typical people and what they believe about the intelligence of individuals with Down syndrome. We also investigated implicit theories of intelligence as predictors of explicit judgments about intelligence and implicit attitudes toward people with Down syndrome. Whatever the work experience in the field of intellectual disability, implicit theories of intelligence were found to be less incremental when considering people with Down syndrome than when considering typical people; and the stronger the belief in entity theory, the more negative (and less positive) the judgments expressed explicitly. Implicit theories of intelligence were also found to be predictors of negative implicit attitude but only in adults from the community. These findings offer prospects for improving practices by people working in the field of intellectual disability. They might interest a wide range of people caring for people with intellectual disabilities, such as teachers, but also other professional caregivers, and other scientists focusing on intellectual disabilities or social cognition."
https://openalex.org/W2770204525,"An integrated molecular surveillance for tuberculosis (TB) improves the understanding of ongoing TB transmission by combining molecular typing and epidemiological data. However, the implementation of an integrated molecular surveillance for TB is complex and requires thoughtful consideration of feasibility, demand, public health benefits and legal issues. We aimed to pilot the integration of molecular typing results between 2008 and 2010 in the German Federal State of Baden-Württemberg (population 10.88 Million) as preparation for a nationwide implementation. Culture positive TB cases were typed by IS6110 DNA fingerprinting and results were integrated into routine notification data. Demographic and clinical characteristics of cases and clusters were described and new epidemiological links detected after integrating typing data were calculated. Furthermore, a cross-sectional survey was performed among local public health offices to evaluate their perception and experiences. Overall, typing results were available for 83% of notified culture positive TB cases, out of which 25% were clustered. Age <15 years (OR = 4.96, 95% CI: 1.69-14.55) and being born in Germany (OR = 2.01, 95% CI: 1.44-2.80) were associated with clustering. At cluster level, molecular typing information allowed the identification of previously unknown epidemiological links in 11% of the clusters. In 59% of the clusters it was not possible to identify any epidemiological link. Clusters extending over different counties were less likely to have epidemiological links identified among their cases (OR = 11.53, 95% CI: 3.48-98.23). The majority of local public health offices found molecular typing useful for their work. Our study illustrates the feasibility of integrating typing data into the German TB notification system and depicts its added public health value as complementary strategy in TB surveillance, especially to uncover transmission events among geographically separated TB patients. It also emphasizes that special efforts are required to strengthen the communication between local public health offices in different counties to enhance TB control."
https://openalex.org/W2770701796,"Our visual brain makes use of recent experience to interact with the visual world, and efficiently select relevant information. This is exemplified by speeded search when target- and distractor features repeat across trials versus when they switch, a phenomenon referred to as intertrial priming. Here, we present fAIM, a computational model that demonstrates how priming can be explained by a simple feature-weighting mechanism integrated into an established model of bottom-up vision. In fAIM, such modulations in feature gains are widespread and not just restricted to one or a few features. Consequentially, priming effects result from the overall tuning of visual features to the task at hand. Such tuning allows the model to reproduce priming for different types of stimuli, including for typical stimulus dimensions such as ‘color’ and for less obvious dimensions such as ‘spikiness’ of shapes. Moreover, the model explains some puzzling findings from the literature: it shows how priming can be found for target-distractor stimulus relations rather than for their absolute stimulus values per se, without an explicit representation of relations. Similarly, it simulates effects that have been taken to reflect a modulation of priming by an observers’ goals—without any representation of goals in the model. We conclude that priming is best considered as a consequence of a general adaptation of the brain to visual input, and not as a peculiarity of visual search."
