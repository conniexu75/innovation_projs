https://openalex.org/W2074591493,"Pilocytic astrocytomas (PAs), WHO malignancy grade I, are the most frequently occurring central nervous system tumour in 5- to 19-year-olds. Recent reports have highlighted the importance of MAPK pathway activation in PAs, particularly through a tandem duplication leading to an oncogenic BRAF fusion gene. Here, we report two alternative mechanisms resulting in MAPK activation in PAs. Firstly, in striking similarity to the common BRAF fusion, tandem duplication at 3p25 was observed, which produces an in-frame oncogenic fusion between SRGAP3 and RAF1. This fusion includes the Raf1 kinase domain, and shows elevated kinase activity when compared with wild-type Raf1. Secondly, a novel 3 bp insertion at codon 598 in BRAF mimics the hotspot V600E mutation to produce a transforming, constitutively active BRaf kinase. Although these two alterations are not common, they bring the number of cases with an identified 'hit' on the Ras/Raf-signalling pathway to 36 from our series of 44 (82%), confirming its central importance to the development of pilocytic astrocytomas."
https://openalex.org/W2012073509,"Although systems that are involved in attentional selection have been studied extensively, much less is known about nonselective systems. To study these preparatory mechanisms, we compared activity in auditory cortex that was elicited by sounds while rats performed an auditory task ('engaged') with activity that was elicited by identical stimuli while subjects were awake but not performing a task ('passive'). We found that engagement suppressed responses, an effect that was opposite in sign to that elicited by selective attention. In the auditory thalamus, however, engagement enhanced spontaneous firing rates but did not affect evoked responses. These results indicate that neural activity in auditory cortex cannot be viewed simply as a limited resource that is allocated in greater measure as the state of the animal passes from somnolent to passively listening to engaged and attentive. Instead, the engaged condition possesses a characteristic and distinct neural signature in which sound-evoked responses are paradoxically suppressed."
https://openalex.org/W2146066778,"The identity of store-operated calcium (Ca2+) entry (SOCE) channels in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) remains a highly contentious issue. Whereas previous studies have suggested that SOCE in VSMCs is mediated by the nonselective transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC) 1 protein, the identification of STIM1 and Orail as essential components of ICRAC, a highly Ca2+-selective SOCE current in leukocytes, has challenged that view. Here we show that cultured proliferative migratory VSMCs isolated from rat aorta (called “synthetic”) display SOCE with classic features, namely inhibition by 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate, ML-9, and low concentrations of lanthanides. On store depletion, synthetic VSMCs and A7r5 cells display currents with characteristics of ICRAC. Protein knockdown of either STIM1 or Orail in synthetic VSMCs greatly reduced SOCE, whereas Orai2, Orai3, TRPC1, TRPC4, and TRPC6 knockdown had no effect. Orail knockdown reduced ICRAC in synthetic VSMCs and A7r5 cells. Synthetic VSMCs showed up-regulated STIM1/Orai1 proteins and SOCE compared with quiescent freshly isolated VSMC. Knockdown of STIM1 and Orai1 inhibited synthetic VSMC proliferation and migration, whereas STIM2, Orai2, and Orai3 knockdown had no effect. To our knowledge, these results are the first to show ICRAC in VSMCs and resolve a long-standing controversy by identifying CRAC as the elusive VSMC SOCE channel important for proliferation and migration.— Potier, M., Gonzalez, J. C., Motiani, R. K., Abdullaev, I. F., Bisaillon, J. M., Singer, H. A., Trebak, M.

https://openalex.org/W2075850006,"There is an apparent overlap between areas in the USA where the herbicide, atrazine (ATZ), is heavily used and obesity-prevalence maps of people with a BMI over 30. Given that herbicides act on photosystem II of the thylakoid membrane of chloroplasts, which have a functional structure similar to mitochondria, we investigated whether chronic exposure to low concentrations of ATZ might cause obesity or insulin resistance by damaging mitochondrial function. Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 48) were treated for 5 months with low concentrations (30 or 300 µg kg−1 day−1) of ATZ provided in drinking water. One group of animals was fed a regular diet for the entire period, and another group of animals was fed a high-fat diet (40% fat) for 2 months after 3 months of regular diet. Various parameters of insulin resistance were measured. Morphology and functional activities of mitochondria were evaluated in tissues of ATZ-exposed animals and in isolated mitochondria. Chronic administration of ATZ decreased basal metabolic rate, and increased body weight, intra-abdominal fat and insulin resistance without changing food intake or physical activity level. A high-fat diet further exacerbated insulin resistance and obesity. Mitochondria in skeletal muscle and liver of ATZ-treated rats were swollen with disrupted cristae. ATZ blocked the activities of oxidative phosphorylation complexes I and III, resulting in decreased oxygen consumption. It also suppressed the insulin-mediated phosphorylation of Akt. These results suggest that long-term exposure to the herbicide ATZ might contribute to the development of insulin resistance and obesity, particularly where a high-fat diet is prevalent."
https://openalex.org/W1980224636,"Cell migration is a dynamic process that requires temporal and spatial regulation of integrin activation and focal adhesion assembly/disassembly. Talin, an actin and beta-integrin tail-binding protein, is essential for integrin activation and focal adhesion formation. Calpain-mediated cleavage of talin has a key role in focal adhesion turnover; however, the talin head domain, one of the two cleavage products, stimulates integrin activation, localizes to focal adhesions and maintains cell edge protrusions, suggesting that other steps, downstream of talin proteolysis, are required for focal adhesion disassembly. Here we show that talin head binds Smurf1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in cell polarity and migration, more tightly than full-length talin does and that this interaction leads to talin head ubiquitylation and degradation. We found that talin head is a substrate for Cdk5, a cyclin-dependent protein kinase that is essential for cell migration, synaptic transmission and cancer metastasis. Cdk5 phosphorylated talin head at Ser 425, inhibiting its binding to Smurf1, thus preventing talin head ubiquitylation and degradation. Expression of the mutant tal(S425A), which resists Cdk5 phosphorylation thereby increasing its susceptibility to Smurf1-mediated ubiqitylation, resulted in extensive focal adhesion turnover and inhibited cell migration. Thus, talin head produced by calpain-induced cleavage of talin is degraded through Smurf1-mediated ubiquitylation; moreover, phosphorylation by Cdk5 regulates the binding of Smurf1 to talin head, controlling talin head turnover, adhesion stability and ultimately, cell migration."
https://openalex.org/W1971394915,"It has previously been shown that highly invasive MDA-MB231 human breast cancer cells express vacuolar proton-translocating ATPase (V-ATPases) at the cell surface, whereas the poorly invasive MCF7 cell line does not. Bafilomycin, a specific V-ATPase inhibitor, reduces the in vitro invasion of MB231 cells but not MCF7 cells. Targeting of V-ATPases to different cellular membranes is controlled by isoforms of subunit a. mRNA levels for a subunit isoforms were measured in MB231 and MCF7 cells using quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. The results show that although all four isoforms are detectable in both cell types, levels of a3 and a4 are much higher in MB231 than in MCF7 cells. Isoform-specific small interfering RNAs (siRNA) were employed to selectively reduce mRNA levels for each isoform in MB231 cells. V-ATPase function was assessed using the fluorescent indicators SNARF-1 and pyranine to monitor the pH of the cytosol and endosomal/lysosomal compartments, respectively. Cytosolic pH was decreased only on knockdown of a3, whereas endosome/lysosome pH was increased on knockdown of a1, a2, and a3. Treatment of cells with siRNA to a4 did not affect either cytosolic or endosome/lysosome pH. Measurement of invasion using an in vitro transwell assay revealed that siRNAs to both a3 and a4 significantly inhibited invasion of MB231 cells. Immunofluorescence staining of MB231 cells for V-ATPase distribution revealed extensive intracellular staining, with plasma membrane staining observed in approximately 18% of cells. Knockdown of a4 had the greatest effect on plasma membrane staining, leading to a 32% reduction. These results suggest that the a4 isoform may be responsible for targeting V-ATPases to the plasma membrane of MB231 cells and that cell surface V-ATPases play a significant role in invasion. However, other V-ATPases affecting the pH of the cytosol and intracellular compartments, particularly those containing a3, are also involved in invasion."
https://openalex.org/W2103644842,"Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) decreases serum insulin growth factor-1 (IGF-1) levels. IGF-1 is an epigenetically regulated gene that has two promoters, alternative exon 5 splicing, and multiple termination sites. The regulation of gene expression involves the whole gene, as evidenced by the aforementioned IGF-1 paradigm. We hypothesized that IUGR in the rat would affect hepatic IGF-1 expression and alter the epigenetic characteristics of the IGF-1 gene along its length. IUGR was induced through a bilateral uterine artery ligation of the pregnant rat, a well-characterized model of IUGR. Pups from anesthesia and sham-operated dams were used as controls. Real-time RT-PCR and ELISA was used to measure expression at day of life (DOL) 0 and 21. Bisulfite sequencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) quantified IGF-1 epigenetic characteristics. A nontranscribed intergenic control was used for ChIP studies. IUGR decreased hepatic and serum IGF-1. Concurrently, IUGR modified epigenetic characteristics, particularly the histone code, along the length of the hepatic IGF-1 gene. Many changes persisted postnatally, and the postnatal effect of IUGR on the histone code was gender-specific. We conclude that IUGR modifies epigenetic characteristics of the rat hepatic IGF-1 gene along the length of the whole gene."
https://openalex.org/W1978116811,"Voltage-gated channels influence processing of synaptic potentials in dendrites. George et al. report the hyperpolarization-activated cation current (Ih) exerts both direct depolarizing and net inhibitory hyperpolarizing effects on subthreshold excitatory postsynaptic potentials, as a function of synaptic strength. Interaction of Ih with an M-type potassium current (Im) underlies the inhibition. The processing of synaptic potentials by neuronal dendrites depends on both their passive cable properties and active voltage-gated channels, which can generate complex effects as a result of their nonlinear properties. We characterized the actions of HCN (hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated cation) channels on dendritic processing of subthreshold excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) in mouse CA1 hippocampal neurons. The HCN channels generated an excitatory inward current (Ih) that exerted a direct depolarizing effect on the peak voltage of weak EPSPs, but produced a paradoxical hyperpolarizing effect on the peak voltage of stronger, but still subthreshold, EPSPs. Using a combined modeling and experimental approach, we found that the inhibitory action of Ih was caused by its interaction with the delayed-rectifier M-type K+ current. In this manner, Ih can enhance spike firing in response to an EPSP when spike threshold is low and can inhibit firing when spike threshold is high."
https://openalex.org/W1999695024,"Background While human auditory cortex is known to contain tonotopically organized auditory cortical fields (ACFs), little is known about how processing in these fields is modulated by other acoustic features or by attention. Methodology/Principal Findings We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and population-based cortical surface analysis to characterize the tonotopic organization of human auditory cortex and analyze the influence of tone intensity, ear of delivery, scanner background noise, and intermodal selective attention on auditory cortex activations. Medial auditory cortex surrounding Heschl's gyrus showed large sensory (unattended) activations with two mirror-symmetric tonotopic fields similar to those observed in non-human primates. Sensory responses in medial regions had symmetrical distributions with respect to the left and right hemispheres, were enlarged for tones of increased intensity, and were enhanced when sparse image acquisition reduced scanner acoustic noise. Spatial distribution analysis suggested that changes in tone intensity shifted activation within isofrequency bands. Activations to monaural tones were enhanced over the hemisphere contralateral to stimulation, where they produced activations similar to those produced by binaural sounds. Lateral regions of auditory cortex showed small sensory responses that were larger in the right than left hemisphere, lacked tonotopic organization, and were uninfluenced by acoustic parameters. Sensory responses in both medial and lateral auditory cortex decreased in magnitude throughout stimulus blocks. Attention-related modulations (ARMs) were larger in lateral than medial regions of auditory cortex and appeared to arise primarily in belt and parabelt auditory fields. ARMs lacked tonotopic organization, were unaffected by acoustic parameters, and had distributions that were distinct from those of sensory responses. Unlike the gradual adaptation seen for sensory responses, ARMs increased in amplitude throughout stimulus blocks. Conclusions/Significance The results are consistent with the view that medial regions of human auditory cortex contain tonotopically organized core and belt fields that map the basic acoustic features of sounds while surrounding higher-order parabelt regions are tuned to more abstract stimulus attributes. Intermodal selective attention enhances processing in neuronal populations that are partially distinct from those activated by unattended stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W2029883898,"The transcriptional activity of the tumour suppressor, p53, requires direct binding between its transactivation domain (TAD, 1–57) and the transcriptional coactivator, p300. We systematically assessed the role of TAD phosphorylation on binding of the p300 domains CH3, Taz1, Kix and IBiD. Thr18 phosphorylation increased the affinity up to sevenfold for CH3 and Taz1, with smaller increases from phosphorylation of Ser20, Ser15, Ser37, Ser33, Ser46 and Thr55. Binding of Kix and IBiD was less sensitive to phosphorylation. Strikingly, hepta-phosphorylation of all Ser and Thr residues increased binding 40- and 80-fold with CH3 and Taz1, respectively, but not with Kix or IBiD. Substitution of all phospho-sites with aspartates partially mimicked the effects of hepta-phosphorylation. Mdm2, the main negative regulator of p53, competes with p300 for binding to TAD. Binding of Mdm2 to TAD was reduced significantly only on phosphorylation of Thr18 (sevenfold) or by hepta-phosphorylation (24-fold). The relative affinities of Mdm2 and p300 for p53 TAD can thus be changed by up to three orders of magnitude by phosphorylation. Accordingly, phosphorylation of Thr18 and hepta-phosphorylation dramatically shifts the balance towards favouring the binding of p300 with p53, and is thus likely to be an important factor in its regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2048614750,"The 'somatic growth axis' involving IGF-1 and growth hormone is implicated in longevity. Persistent transcription-blocking DNA damage attenuates growth hormone and IGF-1 receptor expression and precipitates other ageing associated transcriptional changes, as well as inhibiting somatic growth. The accumulation of stochastic DNA damage throughout an organism's lifespan is thought to contribute to ageing. Conversely, ageing seems to be phenotypically reproducible and regulated through genetic pathways such as the insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and growth hormone (GH) receptors, which are central mediators of the somatic growth axis. Here we report that persistent DNA damage in primary cells from mice elicits changes in global gene expression similar to those occurring in various organs of naturally aged animals. We show that, as in ageing animals, the expression of IGF-1 receptor and GH receptor is attenuated, resulting in cellular resistance to IGF-1. This cell-autonomous attenuation is specifically induced by persistent lesions leading to stalling of RNA polymerase II in proliferating, quiescent and terminally differentiated cells; it is exacerbated and prolonged in cells from progeroid mice and confers resistance to oxidative stress. Our findings suggest that the accumulation of DNA damage in transcribed genes in most if not all tissues contributes to the ageing-associated shift from growth to somatic maintenance that triggers stress resistance and is thought to promote longevity."
https://openalex.org/W2076060169,"Successfully transferring the findings of expensive and tightly controlled programmes of intensive lifestyle modification to the primary care setting is necessary if such knowledge is to be of clinical utility. The objective of this study was to test whether intensive lifestyle modification, shown previously in tightly-controlled clinical trials to be efficacious for diabetes risk-reduction among high-risk individuals, can reduce cardiovascular risk factor levels in the primary care setting.The Swedish Björknäs study was a randomized controlled trial conducted from 2003 to 2006 with follow-up on cardiovascular risk factors at 3, 12, 24 and 36 months. A total of 151 middle-aged men and women at moderate- to high-risk of cardiovascular disease from northern Sweden were randomly assigned to either an intensive lifestyle intervention (n = 75) or control (n = 76) group. The intervention was based broadly on the protocol of the Diabetes Prevention Program. The three-month intervention period was administered in the primary care setting and consisted of supervised exercise sessions and diet counselling, followed by regular group meetings during three years. The control group was given general advice about diet and exercise and received standard clinical care. Outcomes were changes in anthropometrics, aerobic fitness, self-reported physical activity, blood pressure, and metabolic traits. At 36 months post-randomisation, intensive lifestyle modification reduced waist circumference (-2.2 cm: p = 0.001), waist-hip ratio (-0.02: p<0.0001), systolic blood pressure (-4.9 mmHg: p = 0.036), and diastolic blood pressure (-1.6 mmHg: p = 0.005), and improved aerobic fitness (5%; p = 0.038). Changes in lipid or glucose values did not differ statistically between groups. At 36 months, self-reported time spent exercising and total physical activity had increased more in the intervention group than in the control group (p<0.001).A program of intensive lifestyle modification undertaken in the primary health care setting can favourably influence cardiovascular risk-factor profiles in high-risk individuals.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00486941."
https://openalex.org/W2062550680,"Current methods of protein detection are insensitive to detecting subtle changes in oncoprotein activation that underlie key cancer signaling processes. The requirement for large numbers of cells precludes serial tumor sampling for assessing a response to therapeutics. Therefore, we have developed a nanofluidic proteomic immunoassay (NIA) to quantify total and low-abundance protein isoforms in nanoliter volumes. Our method can quantify amounts of MYC oncoprotein and B cell lymphoma protein-2 (BCL2) in Burkitt's and follicular lymphoma; identify changes in activation of extracellular signal-related kinases-1 (ERK1) and ERK2, mitogen-activated kinase-1 (MEK), signal transducer and activator of transcription protein-3 (STAT3) and STAT5, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and caspase-3 in imatinib-treated chronic myelogeneous leukemia (CML) cells; measure an unanticipated change in the phosphorylation of an ERK2 isomer in individuals with CML who responded to imatinib; and detect a decrease in STAT3 and STAT5 phosphorylation in individuals with lymphoma who were treated with atorvastatin. Therefore, we have described a new and highly sensitive method for determining oncoprotein expression and phosphorylation in clinical specimens for the development of new therapeutics for cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2155880350,"Although paediatric high grade gliomas resemble their adult counterparts in many ways, there appear to be distinct clinical and biological differences. One important factor hampering the development of new targeted therapies is the relative lack of cell lines derived from childhood glioma patients, as it is unclear whether the well-established adult lines commonly used are representative of the underlying molecular genetics of childhood tumours. We have carried out a detailed molecular and phenotypic characterisation of a series of paediatric high grade glioma cell lines in comparison to routinely used adult lines.All lines proliferate as adherent monolayers and express glial markers. Copy number profiling revealed complex genomes including amplification and deletions of genes known to be pivotal in core glioblastoma signalling pathways. Expression profiling identified 93 differentially expressed genes which were able to distinguish between the adult and paediatric high grade cell lines, including a number of kinases and co-ordinated sets of genes associated with DNA integrity and the immune response.These data demonstrate that glioma cell lines derived from paediatric patients show key molecular differences to those from adults, some of which are well known, whilst others may provide novel targets for evaluation in primary tumours. We thus provide the rationale and demonstrate the practicability of using paediatric glioma cell lines for preclinical and mechanistic studies."
https://openalex.org/W1983686907,"Microglial-related factors have been implicated in the signaling cascades that contribute to neuronal cell death in various neurodegenerative disorders. Thus, strategies that reduce microglial activation and associated neurotoxicity may have therapeutic benefit. Group II and III metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) are expressed in microglia and can modulate microglial activity in primary cell cultures. We demonstrate that the group I receptor member mGluR5 is highly expressed in primary microglial cultures and the BV2 microglial cell line. Activation of mGluR5 using the selective agonist (RS)-2-chloro-5-hydroxyphenylglycine (CHPG) significantly attenuates microglial activation in response to lipopolysaccharide and interferon-gamma, as indicated by a reduction in the expression of inducible nitric-oxide synthase, production of nitric oxide and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and intracellular generation of reactive oxygen species. In addition, microglial-induced neurotoxicity is also markedly reduced by CHPG treatment. The anti-inflammatory effects of CHPG are mediated by the mGluR5 receptor, because either a selective mGluR5 antagonist or small interference RNA knockdown attenuated the actions of this drug. CHPG blocked the lipopolysaccharide-induced increase in expression and enzymatic activity of NADPH oxidase. Moreover, the protective effects of CHPG were significantly reduced when the NADPH oxidase subunits p22(phox) or gp91(phox) were knocked down by small interference RNA. These data suggest that mGluR5 represents a novel target for modulating microglial-dependent neuroinflammation, and may have therapeutic relevance for neurological disorders that exhibit microglial-mediated neurodegeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2057671045,"Activation of Hedgehog (Hh) signaling requires the transmembrane protein Smoothened (Smo), a member of the G-protein coupled receptor superfamily. In mammals, Smo translocates to the primary cilium upon binding of Hh ligands to their receptor, Patched (Ptch1), but it is unclear if ciliary trafficking of Smo is sufficient for pathway activation. Here, we demonstrate that cyclopamine and jervine, two structurally related inhibitors of Smo, force ciliary translocation of Smo. Treatment with SANT-1, an unrelated Smo antagonist, abrogates cyclopamine- and jervine-mediated Smo translocation. Further, activation of protein kinase A, either directly or through activation of Gαs, causes Smo to translocate to a proximal region of the primary cilium. We propose that Smo adopts multiple inactive and active conformations, which influence its localization and trafficking on the primary cilium."
https://openalex.org/W2063941640,"The molecular progression of endometrial cancer is poorly understood, and both genetic and epigenetic factors play a role. Survivin is a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) gene family and contains a canonical CpG island that has been described as epigenetically regulated. As survivin is overexpressed in endometrial tumors, we hypothesized that hypomethylation could explain this expression pattern. Surprisingly, methylation-specific PCR and pyrosequencing showed that survivin was hypermethylated in endometrial tumors and correlated with increased survivin expression. We speculated that methylation could inhibit the binding of p53, a repressor of survivin expression. Our data indicates that demethylation of the survivin promoter by decitabine results in p53-dependent survivin repression and that p53 binding can be inhibited by DNA methylation. We are the first to report survivin de-repression by DNA methylation. We also present microarray data, which suggest that de-repression by methylation is a general mechanism of p53 regulation. Demethylation induced by decitabine is traditionally thought to be active in tumors by allowing the re-expression of tumor suppressor genes. However, our results indicate that an additional important mechanism is to decrease the expression of oncogenes."
https://openalex.org/W1998758780,"Telomerase-negative cancer cells maintain their telomeres through the alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) pathway. Although a growing body of evidence demonstrates that the ALT mechanism is a post-replicative telomere recombination process, molecular details of this pathway are largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that MUS81, a DNA structure specific recombination endonuclease, has a key role in the maintenance of telomeres in human ALT cells. We find that MUS81 specifically localizes to ALT-associated promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) nuclear bodies (APBs) and associates with telomeric DNA in ALT cells, which is enriched during the G2 phase of the cell cycle. Depletion of MUS81 results in the reduction of ALT-specific telomere recombination and leads to proliferation arrest of ALT cells. In addition, the endonuclease activity of MUS81 is required for recombination-based ALT cell survival, and the interaction of MUS81 with the telomeric repeat-binding factor TRF2 regulates this enzymatic activity, thereby maintaining telomere recombination. Thus, our results suggest that MUS81 is involved in the maintenance of ALT cell survival at least in part by homologous recombination of telomeres."
https://openalex.org/W1998968974,"Background The pre-erythrocytic malaria vaccine RTS,S/AS02A has shown to confer protection against clinical malaria for at least 21 months in a trial in Mozambican children. Efficacy varied between different endpoints, such as parasitaemia or clinical malaria; however the underlying mechanisms that determine efficacy and its duration remain unknown. We performed a new, exploratory analysis to explore differences in the duration of protection among participants to better understand the protection afforded by RTS,S. Methodology/Principal Findings The study was a Phase IIb double-blind, randomized controlled trial in 2022 children aged 1 to 4 years. The trial was designed with two cohorts to estimate vaccine efficacy against two different endpoints: clinical malaria (cohort 1) and infection (cohort 2). Participants were randomly allocated to receive three doses of RTS,S/AS02A or control vaccines. We did a retrospective, unplanned sub-analysis of cohort 2 data using information collected for safety through the health facility-based passive case detection system. Vaccine efficacy against clinical malaria was estimated over the first six-month surveillance period (double-blind phase) and over the following 12 months (single-blind phase), and analysis was per-protocol. Adjusted vaccine efficacy against first clinical malaria episodes in cohort 2 was of 35.4% (95% CI 4.5–56.3; p = 0.029) over the double-blind phase and of 9.0% (−30.6–36.6; p = 0.609) during the single-blind phase. Conclusions/Significance Contrary to observations in cohort 1, where efficacy against clinical malaria did not wane over time, in cohort 2 the efficacy decreases with time. We hypothesize that this reduced duration of protection is a result of the early diagnosis and treatment of infections in cohort 2 participants, preventing sufficient exposure to asexual-stage antigens. On the other hand, the long-term protection against clinical disease observed in cohort 1 may be a consequence of a prolonged exposure to low-dose blood-stage asexual parasitaemia.

https://openalex.org/W2094931500,"Schistosomes are parasitic platyhelminths that constitute an important public health problem globally. Infection is characterized by the presence of adult worms within the vasculature of their hosts, where they can reside for many years. The worms are covered by an unusual dual lipid bilayer through which they import nutrients. How the parasites import other vital molecules, such as water, is not known. Recent proteomic analysis of the schistosome tegumental membranes revealed the presence of an aquaporin homologue at the host-interactive surface whose cDNA we have cloned and characterized. The cDNA encodes a predicted 304-aa protein (SmAQP) that is found largely in the parasite tegument by immunolocalization and is most highly expressed in the intravascular life stages. Treatment of parasites with short interfering RNAs targeting the SmAQP gene results in potent (>90%) suppression. These suppressed parasites resist swelling when placed in hypotonic medium, unlike their control counterparts, which rapidly double in volume. In addition, SmAQP-suppressed parasites, unlike controls, resist shrinkage when incubated in hyperosmotic solution. While suppressed parasites exhibit lower viability in culture relative to controls and exhibit a stunted appearance following prolonged suppression, they are nonetheless more resistant to killing by the drug potassium antimonyl tartrate (PAT). This is likely because SmAQP acts as a conduit for this drug, as is the case for aquaporins in other systems. These experiments reveal a heretofore unrecognized role of the schistosome tegument in controlling water and drug movement into the parasites and highlight the importance of the tegument in parasite osmoregulation and drug uptake."
https://openalex.org/W2107226097,"In the mammalian retina, A17 amacrine cells provide reciprocal inhibitory feedback to rod bipolar cells, thereby shaping the time course of visual signaling in vivo. Previous results have indicated that A17 feedback can be triggered by Ca(2+) influx through Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA receptors and can occur independently of voltage-gated Ca(2+) (Ca(v)) channels, whose presence and functional role in A17 dendrites have not yet been explored. We combined electrophysiology, calcium imaging and immunohistochemistry and found that L-type Ca(v) channels in rat A17 amacrine cells were located at the sites of reciprocal synaptic feedback and that their contribution to GABA release was diminished by large-conductance Ca(2+)-activated potassium (BK) channels, which suppress postsynaptic depolarization in A17s and limit Ca(v) channel activation. We also found that BK channels, by limiting GABA release from A17s, regulate the flow of excitatory synaptic transmission through the rod pathway."

In order to widen biotechnological applications of protein trans-splicing, it is highly desirable to have split inteins with shorter C-terminal fragments, which can be chemically synthesized.We report the identification of new functional split sites in DnaE inteins from Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 and from Nostoc punctiforme. One of the newly engineered split intein bearing C-terminal 15 residues showed more robust protein trans-splicing activity than naturally occurring split DnaE inteins in a foreign context. During the course of our experiments, we found that protein ligation by protein trans-splicing depended not only on the splicing junction sequences, but also on the foreign extein sequences. Furthermore, we could classify the protein trans-splicing reactions in foreign contexts with a simple kinetic model into three groups according to their kinetic parameters in the presence of various reducing agents.The shorter C-intein of the newly engineered split intein could be a useful tool for biotechnological applications including protein modification, incorporation of chemical probes, and segmental isotopic labelling. Based on kinetic analysis of the protein splicing reactions, we propose a general strategy to improve ligation yields by protein trans-splicing, which could significantly enhance the applications of protein ligation by protein trans-splicing."
https://openalex.org/W2093464694,"Background The amyloidoses are protein misfolding diseases characterized by the deposition of amyloid that leads to cell death and tissue degeneration. In immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis (AL), each patient has a unique monoclonal immunoglobulin light chain (LC) that forms amyloid deposits. Somatic mutations in AL LCs make these proteins less thermodynamically stable than their non-amyloidogenic counterparts, leading to misfolding and ultimately the formation of amyloid fibrils. We hypothesize that location rather than number of non-conservative mutations determines the amyloidogenicity of light chains. Methodology/Principal Findings We performed sequence alignments on the variable domain of 50 κ and 91 λ AL light chains and calculated the number of non-conservative mutations over total number of patients for each secondary structure element in order to identify regions that accumulate non-conservative mutations. Among patients with AL, the levels of circulating immunoglobulin free light chain varies greatly, but even patients with very low levels can have very advanced amyloid deposition. Conclusions Our results show that in specific secondary structure elements, there are significant differences in the number of non-conservative mutations between normal and AL sequences. AL sequences from patients with different levels of secreted light chain have distinct differences in the location of non-conservative mutations, suggesting that for patients with very low levels of light chains and advanced amyloid deposition, the location of non-conservative mutations rather than the amount of free light chain in circulation may determine the amyloidogenic propensity of light chains."

Identification of androgen-regulated genes in prostate cancer cells is therefore of considerable importance for defining the mechanisms of prostate-cancer development and progression. Although several studies have used microarrays to identify AR-regulated genes in prostate cancer cell lines and in prostate tumours, we present here the results of gene expression microarray profiling of the androgen-responsive LNCaP prostate-cancer cell line treated with R1881 for the identification of androgen-regulated genes. We show that the expression of 319 genes is stimulated by 24 h after R1881 addition, with a similar number (300) of genes being significantly repressed. Expression of the upregulated genes, as well as of 60 of the most robustly downregulated genes, was carried out using quantitative RT–PCR (Q-RT–PCR) over a time-course of R1881 treatment from 0 to 72 h. Q-RT–PCR was also carried out following treatment with other AR agonists (dihydrotestosterone, estradiol and medroxyprogesterone) and antagonists (cyproterone acetate, hydroxyflutamide and bicalutamide). This study provides a comprehensive analysis of androgen-regulated gene expression in the LNCaP prostate cancer cell line, and identifies a number of androgen-regulated genes, not described previously, as candidates for mediating androgen responses in prostate cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W1998641915,"Expression of Trk receptors is an important prognostic factor in neuroblastoma (NB) and other cancers. TrkB and its ligand brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) are preferentially expressed in NB with poor prognosis, conferring invasive and metastatic potential to the tumor cells as well as enhancing therapy resistance. Galectin-1 (Gal-1) has emerged as an interesting cancer target, as it is involved in modulating cell proliferation, cell death and cell migration, all of which are linked to cancer initiation and progression. We previously identified Gal-1 mRNA to be upregulated in patients with aggressive, relapsing NB and found that Gal-1 protein was upregulated in human SY5Y NB cells on activation of ectopically expressed TrkB (SY5Y-TrkB), but not TrkA (SY5Y-TrkA). Here, we report that Gal-1 mRNA levels positively correlated with TrkB expression and anticorrelated with TrkA expression in a cohort of 102 primary NB. Immunohistochemical analyses of 92 primary NB specimens revealed high Gal-1 expression in stromal septae and in neuroblasts. BDNF-mediated activation of TrkB enhanced invasiveness and migration in vitro, which could be impaired by transient transfection using Gal-1-specific siRNA or a neutralizing antibody directed against Gal-1. The addition of recombinant Gal-1 (rGal-1) in the absence of BDNF partially restored migration and invasive capacity. Using the Trk inhibitor K252a, we could show that the upregulation of Gal-1 protein strictly depended on activated TrkB. Our data suggest that targeting Gal-1 might be a promising strategy for the treatment of aggressive NB."
https://openalex.org/W2060514775,"G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) kinases (GRKs) phosphorylate activated GPCRs and initiate their desensitization. Many prior studies suggest that activated GPCRs dock to an allosteric site on the GRKs and thereby stimulate kinase activity. The extreme N-terminal region of GRKs is clearly involved in this process, but its role is not understood. Using our recent structure of bovine GRK1 as a guide, we generated mutants of solvent-exposed residues in the GRK1 kinase domain that are conserved among GRKs but not in the extended protein kinase A, G, and C family and evaluated their catalytic activity. Mutation of select residues in strands β1 and β3 of the kinase small lobe, αD of the kinase large lobe, and the protein kinase A, G, and C kinase C-tail greatly impaired receptor phosphorylation. The most dramatic effect was observed for mutation of an invariant arginine on the β1-strand (∼1000-fold decrease in kcat/Km). These residues form a continuous surface that is uniquely available in GRKs for protein-protein interactions. Surprisingly, these mutants, as well as a 19-amino acid N-terminal truncation of GRK1, also show decreased catalytic efficiency for peptide substrates, although to a lesser extent than for receptor phosphorylation. Our data suggest that the N-terminal region and the newly identified surface interact and stabilize the closed, active conformation of the kinase domain.

Benovic J.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 387-391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Receptor phosphorylation facilitates the binding of arrestin, which uncouples heterotrimeric G proteins, promotes receptor internalization, and activates arrestin-dependent signaling pathways (2Pitcher J.A.

Toxicol. 1998; 38: 289-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). Although playing a beneficial role in receptor desensitization, GRKs are implicated in a range of human diseases, including retinal degeneration, hypertension, heart failure, rheumatoid arthritis, opiate addiction, and various cancers (2Pitcher J.A.

Signal. 2005; 17: 917-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Seven GRKs have been identified in mammals. They can be divided into the following three subgroups based on their sequence homology: GRK1 (GRK1 and GRK7), GRK2 (GRK2 and GRK3), and GRK4 (GRK4, GRK5, and GRK6). The primary structures of the three GRK subgroups are similar, consisting of tandem regulator of G protein signaling homology (RH) and kinase domains. Less conserved sequences involved in phospholipid membrane attachment are found at their C termini (Fig. 1A).

All eukaryotic protein kinases, including GRKs, contain a core catalytic domain of ∼250 amino acids that can be divided into two subdomains, called the small (or N) and large (or C) lobes. The small lobe consists of a five-stranded β-sheet (β1–5) and a conserved helix, αC, whereas the large lobe is mostly α-helical. The active site is located at their interface, with the nucleotide-binding pocket formed primarily by the small lobe and the phosphoacceptor-binding site primarily by the large lobe. In their active conformation, kinases position the hydroxyl group of the phosphoacceptor substrate in the proper orientation with respect to the γ-phosphate of ATP via a network of interactions formed by conserved structural elements from both lobes. Control of this network often underlies the molecular basis for allosteric regulation of protein kinase activity (5Nolen B. Taylor S. Ghosh G. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 661-675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar, 6Huse M. Kuriyan J.

In GRKs, this allosteric regulation appears to be mediated by interactions with activated GPCRs. Steady-state kinetics indicate that the Km values of receptor substrates are in the micromolar range, whereas those of peptide substrates, even those derived from receptors, are in the millimolar range (10Onorato J.J.

Moreover, the catalytic efficiency for peptide phosphorylation by GRKs is much lower than that for receptor phosphorylation, and it can be enhanced in the presence of activated receptors (11Palczewski K. Buczyłko J. Kaplan M.W. Polans A.S. Crabb J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12949-12955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Chen C.Y. Dion S.B. Kim C.M. Benovic J.L. J. Biol.

Thus, in addition to the peptide phosphoacceptor-binding site of the large lobe, an additional allosteric receptor-docking site appears to be required to promote catalytic activity in GRKs. The molecular basis for how GRKs interact with activated GPCRs is poorly understood. In vitro, GRKs show little specificity among GPCRs, requiring only that the receptor be in an activated conformation. For example, although GRK1 is the predominant kinase expressed in rod outer segments, GRK1, GRK2, and GRK5 all phosphorylate bovine rhodopsin in a light-dependent manner with comparable catalytic efficiencies (15Palczewski K. McDowell J.H. Hargrave P.A. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2306-2313Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 16Kim C.M. Dion S.B. Onorato J.J. Benovic J.L.

Therefore, it seems likely that GRKs have a common molecular mechanism for the recognition of activated GPCRs. The region of GRKs most strongly linked to efficient receptor phosphorylation is the highly conserved N-terminal region, which is unique to the GRK subfamily and predicted to form an α-helix (Fig. 1B). Deletion of this region in GRK1, -2, or -5 abolishes receptor phosphorylation (18Palczewski K. Buczyłko J. Lebioda L. Crabb J.W. Polans A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6004-6013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Yu Q.M. Cheng Z.J. Gan X.Q. Bao G.B. Li L. Pei G. J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 18060-18066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) to the GRK1 N-terminal region inhibits receptor phosphorylation. In GRK5, it has also been suggested that the N terminus plays a role in phospholipid interactions (20Noble B. Kallal L.A. Pausch M.H. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47466-47476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Another region that is likely involved in the allosteric regulation of GRKs is the AGC kinase C-terminal tail (C-tail), which is an extension of the kinase core domain and often plays a regulatory role in AGC kinases (22Kannan N.

The central segment of the C-tail, termed the active site tether (AST), contributes residues to the active site and is only well ordered in kinase domain structures that are in conformations resembling the active state. To date, crystal structures representing each GRK subgroup have been reported, i.e. bovine GRK1 (bGRK1), bovine GRK2 (bGRK2), and human GRK6 (hGRK6) (25Lodowski D.T. Barnhill J.F. Pyskadlo R.M.

Although most of these structures were co-crystallized in the presence of ATP or nucleotide analogs, none adopted the closed, active conformation exhibited by nucleotide-bound PKA (30Madhusudan Akamine P. Xuong N.H. Taylor S.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 273-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), and the AST region of their AGC kinase C-tails were either partially or totally disordered. Similarly, the N-terminal region important for receptor phosphorylation was only observed in one crystal structure, namely that of one chain of the bGRK1·ATP complex. Thus, the regions believed to be most important for receptor interaction were largely disordered in these structures, leaving the molecular basis for how GPCRs interact with GRKs unclear. Because the kinase domains in these structures appear to be otherwise competent for catalysis, it is expected that activated GPCRs bind in a manner that promotes full kinase domain closure. Interactions with negatively charged lipids in the cell membrane are also expected to play a role in this transition (20Noble B. Kallal L.A. Pausch M.H. Benovic J.L. J. Biol.

In this study, we used recently determined structures of bGRK1 as a template to identify surface residues of the kinase domain that are conserved in GRKs but not in the extended AGC family. Biochemical characterization of site-directed mutants of these residues in bGRK1 identified a continuous surface on the small lobe and the AGC kinase C-tail that is critical for GRK activation by GPCRs. The residue whose mutation showed the largest effect on receptor phosphorylation is nearly as important as the N-terminal region, and the analogous residue is also critical in the other two GRK subgroups, represented by bGRK2 and hGRK6. Comparison with other AGC kinases reveals that this surface is uniquely available for protein-protein interactions in the GRK subfamily. A model for activation that involves cooperative interactions between the N-terminal region and the kinase domain is presented. [γ-32P]ATP was purchased from MP Biomedicals and GE Healthcare. Peptide substrates DDEASTTVSKTETSQVARRR (peptide C) and RRREEEEESAAA (RESA) were synthesized by solid-phase synthesis, and their concentrations in solution were determined by quantitative amino acid analysis at the Protein Structure Facility, University of Michigan Medical Center, Ann Arbor. Dark-adapted bovine retinas were purchased from W. L. Lawson Co., Lincoln, NE. A pcDNA3.1 vector bearing the coding sequence for human β2-adrenergic receptor (hβ2AR) with an N-terminal influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag was a gift from Drs. Marc Caron and Larry Barak (Duke University). A pcDNA3 vector bearing the coding sequence for bGRK2 was a gift from Dr. Jeffrey Benovic (Thomas Jefferson University). Anti-GRK2 monoclonal antibodies C5/1 and R11E1 were gifts from Dr. Martin Oppermann (Georg-August-University, Germany). Structure figures were prepared using PyMOL. The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to introduce mutations into a construct that expresses bGRK1 C-terminally truncated at residue 535 and hexahistidine (H6)-tagged (bGRK1535-H6) (29Singh P. Wang B. Maeda T. Palczewski K. Tesmer J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 14053-14062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). An N-terminal deletion mutant (ΔN19) of bGRK1 was generated by cloning the cDNA sequence corresponding to amino acids 20–535 between the BamHI and SalI sites of pFastBacDualH6. All mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. Mutants were expressed in High Five insect cells using the Bac-to-Bac system (Invitrogen) and purified as described previously (29Singh P. Wang B. Maeda T. Palczewski K. Tesmer J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 14053-14062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Briefly, a metal-chelating affinity chromatography (nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid, Qiagen) was followed by cation exchange chromatography (Source 15S, GE Healthcare). Some mutants were further purified by size-exclusion chromatography (Superdex 200, GE Healthcare). The purity of each bGRK1535-H6 variant was >90% as judged by SDS-PAGE. Full-length bGRK2 and residues 1–531 of hGRK6, whose C-terminal end is analogous to the last visible residue in the crystal structure of bovine GRK1, were cloned into the pFastBacDualH6 vector between the BamHI and SalI sites to create vectors that express bGRK2FL-H6 and hGRK6531-H6, respectively. The bGRK2FL-H6 (R195A) and hGRK6531-H6 (R190A) mutants were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Proteins were purified in the same manner as bGRK1535-H6. All GRK proteins were stored in small aliquots at −80 °C, and their concentrations were determined by absorbance at 280 nm using estimated molar extinction coefficients of 63,830 m−1 cm−1 for bGRK1535-H6, 71,280 m−1 cm−1 for bGRK2FL-H6, and 59,820 m−1 cm−1 for hGRK6531-H6. Urea-washed bovine rod outer segments (bROS) were purified as described previously (33Papermaster D.S. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 81: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Steady-state kinetics were conducted at saturating (0.5–2 mm) [γ-32P]ATP, 0–80 μm urea-washed bROS, and 0.03–0.2 μm GRK variants in 100 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm EDTA (Buffer A). The reaction was initiated by addition of ATP and then incubated at room temperature (22–26 °C). Small aliquots (3–5 μl) of the reaction mixture were removed at 4–5 time points within the first 5 min of the reaction where a linear relationship holds, and less than 10% of substrate was consumed. The reactions were quenched with SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Dried gels were exposed to a storage phosphor screen, and phosphorylated rhodopsin was quantified using a Typhoon 9410 imager (GE Healthcare). Initial rates were calculated from the slope of phosphorylated rhodopsin production at various time points and fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation to obtain kcat and Km (bROS) using Prism version 4.0a. bGRK2-R195A and N-terminal deletion (bGRK2-ΔN16) were generated in the pcDNA3-bGRK2 vector, and the hβ2AR-Y326A mutant was generated in the pcDNA3.1-hβ2AR vector. HEK293T cells (6-cm dish, ∼50% confluent) were transiently co-transfected with 1 μg of HA-hβ2AR-Y326A pcDNA3.1 and 1 μg of pcDNA3 of bGRK2-WT, -R195A, -ΔN16, or empty vector using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). After ∼44 h of transfection, cells were treated ±1 μm isoproterenol for 20 min at 37 °C. After being washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were immediately lysed in 200 μl of RIPA lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium cholate, 0.1% SDS, 10 mm NaF, and protease inhibitor mixture (1836145001, Roche Applied Science) and phosphatase inhibitor mixtures (sc-45045 and sc-45065, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at the manufacturers' recommended concentrations on ice. The lysate was then spun down at 16,000 × g for 15 min. 5 or 10 μl of the soluble fraction was analyzed by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and then probed with mouse anti-GRK2 monoclonal antibody (C5/1) (10 μg/ml) and rabbit anti-actin polyclonal antibodies (Cytoskeleton AAN01) (1:1000 dilution). The rest of the soluble fraction was incubated with 1 μg of anti-HA monoclonal antibody 16B12 (Covance MMS-101P) and ∼10 μl of protein A-Sepharose (16-156, Upstate) at 4 °C overnight. The beads were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline three times and then resuspended in a total of ∼40 μl of SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer. ∼10 μl was then analyzed by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and probed with either mouse anti-β2AR monoclonal antibody R11E1 (5–10 μg/ml) or rabbit anti-Ser(P)-355,356-β2AR polyclonal antibodies (1:500 dilution) (sc-16719-R, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Horseradish peroxide (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies were used, and the Western blots were visualized by film after being exposed for 5–30 min. The dissociation constant of the WT bGRK1535-H6·ADP complex was measured on a MicroCal PC-isothermal titration calorimeter. 10 μm bGRK1535-H6-WT was placed in the sample cell and titrated by 15 injections of 20 μl of 100 μm ADP in 20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, and 5 mm MgCl2 (Buffer B) at 25 °C. The data were analyzed using Origin software to obtain KA, ΔH, and ΔS values. The dissociation constants for bGRK1535-H6·ADP variant complexes were measured using a competition fluorescence polarization assay. The dissociation constant of BODIPY® TR ADP (Invitrogen) was first determined using 0.02 μm BODIPY® TR ADP and 0–6.4 μm bGRK1535-H6 variants in Buffer B at λex = 575 nm and λem = 620 nm. Samples were incubated in the dark at room temperature for 5–10 min before the millipolarization (mP) was recorded. For background subtraction, 20 mm EDTA was then added to the wells, and the mP was recorded again after 5–10 min of incubation in the dark. Data were fitted to Equation 1, mP=mPmax×[P]tKD+[P]t(Eq. 1) where mPmax is the maximal mP, [P]t is the total protein concentration, and KD is the dissociation constant. Competition assays were conducted using 0.02 μm BODIPY® TR ADP, 1 μm of each bGRK1535-H6 protein, and 0–10 μm ADP in Buffer B at room temperature. The data were fitted to a competition model accounting for ligand depletion as shown in Equations 2 and 3, mP=mPmax(1+KD1/[P]free)+mPmin(Eq. 2) [P]free=[P]t−b−b2−4×[P]t×[L2]t2(Eq. 3) where [L2]t is the total ADP concentration; KD1 is the dissociation constant of BODIPY® TR ADP; [P]free is the free protein concentration; mPmin is the minimal mP; and b = [P]t + [L2]t + KD2, where KD2 is the dissociation constant of ADP. The activity of GRKs for peptide substrates was measured by filter binding assays using either peptide C, which corresponds to the C terminus of bovine rhodopsin and contains its nascent phosphorylation sites (11Palczewski K. Buczyłko J. Kaplan M.W. Polans A.S. Crabb J.W. J. Biol.

Three Arg residues located at the ends of these peptides facilitate their binding to phosphocellulose paper. The reactions contained 1–10 μm GRK variant, 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP, and 0–16 mm peptide in Buffer A. Reactions were incubated at room temperature for 30–270 min, and small aliquots (∼5 μl) were quenched by addition of 15–30 μl of 15% trichloroacetic acid at various time points. Samples were pelleted in a microcentrifuge at 13,000 rpm for 10 min, and their supernatants were applied to P-81 paper (2.5-cm circles; Whatman) and washed with 2 ml of 75 mm H3PO4 at least 10–15 times (total ∼20–30 ml). Filters were then air-dried, and their radioactivity was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Initial rates were calculated from the slope of phosphorylated peptide production and fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation to obtain apparent kcat (kcat,app) and Km (Km,app) values using Prism. These values are only apparent because the reactions were not performed under steady-state conditions, in that the total product concentration was less than the total enzyme concentration. The most complete atomic model for a GRK is the structure of the bGRK1·ATP complex (PDB accession number 3C4W), in which we were able to trace structural elements that were unresolved in prior structures of bGRK2 and hGRK6 (29Singh P. Wang B. Maeda T. Palczewski K. Tesmer J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 14053-14062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Presumably due to the relatively closed conformation of the GRK1 kinase domain and to the presence of well ordered ATP in the active site, portions of the AST region of the AGC kinase C-tail were ordered. The best ordered portion was the “AST loop” (residues 472–477 of the AST region, colored in cyan in Fig. 1C), which adopts a loop conformation very similar to that observed in other AGC kinase domains (30Madhusudan Akamine P. Xuong N.H. Taylor S.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 273-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 34Yang J. Cron P. Good V.M. Thompson V. Hemmings B.A. Barford D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 940-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). The interactions at the base of the AST loop in this bGRK1 structure are almost identical to those in the structure of the PKB·AMP-PNP complex (34Yang J. Cron P. Good V.M. Thompson V. Hemmings B.A. Barford D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 940-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). A hydrogen bond is formed between a tyrosine hydroxyl and a backbone amide nitrogen located at the beginning of the loop, and an aromatic side chain from αD in the large lobe stacks against the peptide bond that immediately follows the AST loop (Fig. 1, C and D). The AST loop, however, is four residues shorter in GRK1 than in PKB, and as a result a region of the GRK small lobe adjacent to the hinge is more solvent-exposed than in structures of either PKA or PKB (Fig. 1D). In the sole GRK structure wherein the N terminus was observed, residues 11–20 form a helix that packs adjacent to this exposed surface of the small lobe (Fig. 1, C and D). Given the location of this surface near the hinge of the kinase domain and to the observed N terminus, we hypothesized that it could be either directly or indirectly involved in docking with receptors (29Singh P. Wang B. Maeda T. Palczewski K. Tesmer J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 14053-14062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We also anticipated that if there were residues on the surface of the GRK kinase domain that were important for GPCR docking, then they should be conserved in GRKs but not in the broader AGC family. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed unique sequences from 44 GRKs and 542 AGC kinases, including GRKs (on-line Protein Kinase Resource) (35Smith C.M. Shindyalov I.N. Veretnik S. Gribskov M. Taylor S.S. Ten Eyck L.F. Bourne P.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 444-446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Both ClustalW (36Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55766) Google Scholar) and MUSCLE (37Edgar R.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 1792-1797Crossref PubMed Scopus (30532) Google Scholar) were used to create alignments. Only the core kinase domain spanning from β1 of the small lobe to αI of the large lobe (bGRK1 residues 187–445) (Fig. 1C) was used for comparisons between the GRK subfamily and the AGC family. The AGC kinase C-tail was not included because the low sequence homology of this region made alignments unreliable. Outputs from ClustalW and MUSCLE were then analyzed using ConSurf to calculate the conservation score for each residue (38Landau M. Mayrose I. Rosenberg Y. Glaser F. Martz E. Pupko T. Ben-Tal N. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: W299-W302Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar, 39Armon A. Graur D. Ben-Tal N. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 447-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). The results were then mapped onto a composite model of the bGRK1 structure (Fig. 1D). Several selection criteria were applied to identify the residues of most interest. First, an amino acid position had to have a negative normalized score (conserved) in the GRK subfamily and a positive normalized score (variable) in the broader AGC kinase family. Second, the absolute difference of these scores had to be greater than 0.5. Finally, these criteria had to be met in both ClustalW and MUSCLE alignments. A total of 24 residues met all of these criteria, including Phe190, Arg191, Arg195, Gln205, Ala208, Thr209, Gly210, Lys211, Leu212, Lys221, Arg222, Lys224, Arg225, Arg226, Met233, Ser249, Ala251, Lys257, Asn268, Asn278, Gly393, Glu400, Val410, and Phe416 (bGRK1 numbering). Seven residues, Val192, His275, Tyr277, Gly285, Glu394, Glu397, and Arg404, met both criteria in only one alignment and one criterion in the other. Interestingly, most of these residues cluster at one of two sites on the small lobe (Fig. 1, B and D). The first is on a continuous surface formed by the β1–β3-strands (site 1) and the other as a cluster of positively charged residues primarily from the αB-helix (site 2). Site 1 was of most interest with regards to receptor coupling, as it corresponded to the same surface of the small lobe left ex"

Insufficient degradation due to altered protein structure or proteasome inhibition may trigger cell death. This study examined the proteasome response to HAMLET, a partially unfolded protein-lipid complex, which is internalized by tumor cells and triggers cell death.HAMLET bound directly to isolated 20S proteasomes in vitro and in tumor cells significant co-localization of HAMLET and 20S proteasomes was detected by confocal microscopy. This interaction was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation from extracts of HAMLET-treated tumor cells. HAMLET resisted in vitro degradation by proteasomal enzymes and degradation by intact 20S proteasomes was slow compared to fatty acid-free, partially unfolded alpha-lactalbumin. After a brief activation, HAMLET inhibited proteasome activity in vitro and in parallel a change in proteasome structure occurred, with modifications of catalytic (beta1 and beta5) and structural subunits (alpha2, alpha3, alpha6 and beta3). Proteasome inhibition was confirmed in extracts from HAMLET-treated cells and there were indications of proteasome fragmentation in HAMLET-treated cells.The results suggest that internalized HAMLET is targeted to 20S proteasomes, that the complex resists degradation, inhibits proteasome activity and perturbs proteasome structure. We speculate that perturbations of proteasome structure might contribute to the cytotoxic effects of unfolded protein complexes that invade host cells."
https://openalex.org/W2074101263,"We explored the molecular mechanisms of morphological transformations of vertebrate paired fin/limb evolution by comparative gene expression profiling and functional analyses. In this study, we focused on the temporal differences of the onset of Sonic hedgehog (Shh) expression in paired appendages among different vertebrates. In limb buds of chick and mouse, Shh expression is activated as soon as there is a morphological bud, concomitant with Hoxd10 expression. In dogfish (Scyliorhinus canicula), however, we found that Shh was transcribed late in fin development, concomitant with Hoxd13 expression. We utilized zebrafish as a model to determine whether quantitative changes in hox expression alter the timing of shh expression in pectoral fins of zebrafish embryos. We found that the temporal shift of Shh activity altered the size of endoskeletal elements in paired fins of zebrafish and dogfish. Thus, a threshold level of hox expression determines the onset of shh expression, and the subsequent heterochronic shift of Shh activity can affect the size of the fin endoskeleton. This process may have facilitated major morphological changes in paired appendages during vertebrate limb evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2016025377,"Background In recent years, the impact of antituberculous treatment on interferon (IFN)-γ response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens has been widely investigated, but the results have been controversial. The objective of the present study was: i) to evaluate longitudinal changes of IFN-γ response to M. tuberculosis-specific antigens in TB patients during antituberculous treatment by using the QuantiFERON-TB Gold (QFT-G) assay; ii) to compare the differences in T-cell response after a short or prolonged period of stimulation with mycobacterial antigens; iii) to assess the CD4+ and CD8+ T cells with effector/memory and central/memory phenotype; iv) to investigate the direct in vitro effects of antituberculous drugs on the secretion of IFN-γ. Principal Findings 38 TB patients was evaluated at baseline and at month 2 and 4 of treatment and at month 6 (treatment completion). 27 (71%) patients had a QFT-G reversion (positive to negative) at the end of therapy, while 11 (29%) TB patients remained QFT-G positive at the end of therapy. Among the 11 patients with persistent positive QFT-G results, six had a complete response to the treatment, while the remaining 5 patients did not have a resolution of the disease. All 27 patients who became QFT-G negative had a complete clinical and microbiological recovery of the TB disease. In these patients the release of IFN-γ is absent even after a prolonged 6-day incubation with both ESAT-6 and CFP-10 antigens and the percentage of effector/memory T-cells phenotype was markedly lower than subjects with persistent positive QFT-G results. The in vitro study showed that antituberculous drugs did not exert any inhibitory effect on IFN-γ production within the range of therapeutically achievable concentrations. Conclusions The present study suggests that the decrease in the M. tuberculosis-specific T cells responses following successful anti-TB therapy may have a clinical value as a supplemental tool for the monitoring of the efficacy of pharmacologic intervention for active TB. In addition, the antituberculous drugs do not have any direct down-regulatory effect on the specific IFN-γ response."
https://openalex.org/W2172266317,"Identifying the molecular mechanisms activated in compensatory hypertrophy and absent during decompensation will provide molecular targets for prevention of heart failure. We have previously shown enhanced ubiquitination (Ub) during the early growth period of pressure overload (PO) hypertrophy near intercalated discs of cardiomyocytes, where integrins are important for mechanotransduction. In this study, we tested the role of integrins upstream of Ub, whether enhanced Ub contributes to survival signaling in early PO, and if loss of this mechanism could lead to decreased ventricular function. The study used a beta(3) integrin (-/-) mouse and a wild-type mouse as a control for in vivo PO by transverse aortic constriction (TAC) and for cultured cardiomyocytes in vitro, stimulated with the integrin-activating peptide RGD. We demonstrate beta(3) integrin mediates transient Ub of targeted proteins during PO hypertrophy, which is necessary for cardiomyocyte survival and to maintain ventricular function. Prosurvival signaling proceeds by initiation of NF-kappaB transcription of the E3 ligase, cIAP1. In PO beta(3)(-/-) mice, absence of this mechanism correlates with increased TUNEL staining and decreased ventricular mass and function by 4 wk. This is the first study to show that a beta(3) integrin/Ub/NF-kappaB pathway contributes to compensatory hypertrophic growth."
https://openalex.org/W2143112229,"Background Trypanosoma congolense are extracellular protozoan parasites of the blood stream of artiodactyls and are one of the main constraints on cattle production in Africa. In cattle, anaemia is the key feature of disease and persists after parasitaemia has declined to low or undetectable levels, but treatment to clear the parasites usually resolves the anaemia. Methodology/Principal Findings The progress of anaemia after Trypanosoma congolense infection was followed in three mouse strains. Anaemia developed rapidly in all three strains until the peak of the first wave of parasitaemia. This was followed by a second phase, characterized by slower progress to severe anaemia in C57BL/6, by slow recovery in surviving A/J and a rapid recovery in BALB/c. There was no association between parasitaemia and severity of anaemia. Furthermore, functional T lymphocytes are not required for the induction of anaemia, since suppression of T cell activity with Cyclosporin A had neither an effect on the course of infection nor on anaemia. Expression of genes involved in erythropoiesis and iron metabolism was followed in spleen, liver and kidney tissues in the three strains of mice using microarrays. There was no evidence for a response to erythropoietin, consistent with anaemia of chronic disease, which is erythropoietin insensitive. However, the expression of transcription factors and genes involved in erythropoiesis and haemolysis did correlate with the expression of the inflammatory cytokines Il6 and Ifng. Conclusions/Significance The innate immune response appears to be the major contributor to the inflammation associated with anaemia since suppression of T cells with CsA had no observable effect. Several transcription factors regulating haematopoiesis, Tal1, Gata1, Zfpm1 and Klf1 were expressed at consistently lower levels in C57BL/6 mice suggesting that these mice have a lower haematopoietic capacity and therefore less ability to recover from haemolysis induced anaemia after infection."
https://openalex.org/W2028407638,"Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) is an enzyme that plays a key role in the modulation of catechol-dependent functions such as cognition, cardiovascular function, and pain processing. Three common haplotypes of the human COMT gene, divergent in two synonymous and one nonsynonymous (val158met) position, designated as low (LPS), average (APS), and high pain sensitive (HPS), are associated with experimental pain sensitivity and risk of developing chronic musculoskeletal pain conditions. APS and HPS haplotypes produce significant functional effects, coding for 3- and 20-fold reductions in COMT enzymatic activity, respectively. In the present study, we investigated whether additional minor single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), accruing in 1 to 5% of the population, situated in the COMT transcript region contribute to haplotype-dependent enzymatic activity. Computer analysis of COMT ESTs showed that one synonymous minor SNP (rs769224) is linked to the APS haplotype and three minor SNPs (two synonymous: rs6267, rs740602 and one nonsynonymous: rs8192488) are linked to the HPS haplotype. Results from in silico and in vitro experiments revealed that inclusion of allelic variants of these minor SNPs in APS or HPS haplotypes did not modify COMT function at the level of mRNA folding, RNA transcription, protein translation, or enzymatic activity. These data suggest that neutral variants are carried with APS and HPS haplotypes, while the high activity LPS haplotype displays less linked variation. Thus, both minor synonymous and nonsynonymous SNPs in the coding region are markers of functional APS and HPS haplotypes rather than independent contributors to COMT activity."
https://openalex.org/W2049564766,"Background The vast amounts of clinical data collected in electronic health records (EHR) is analogous to the data explosion from the “-omics” revolution. In the EHR clinicians often maintain patient-specific problem summary lists which are used to provide a concise overview of significant medical diagnoses. We hypothesized that by tapping into the collective wisdom generated by hundreds of physicians entering problems into the EHR we could detect significant associations among diagnoses that are not described in the literature. Methodology/Principal Findings We employed an analytic approach original developed for detecting associations between sets of gene expression data, called Molecular Concept Map (MCM), to find significant associations among the 1.5 million clinical problem summary list entries in 327,000 patients from our institution's EHR. An odds ratio (OR) and p-value was calculated for each association. A subset of the 750,000 associations found were explored using the MCM tool. Expected associations were confirmed and recently reported but poorly known associations were uncovered. Novel associations which may warrant further exploration were also found. Examples of expected associations included non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and various diagnoses such as retinopathy, hypertension, and coronary artery disease. A recently reported association included irritable bowel and vulvodynia (OR 2.9, p = 5.6×10−4). Associations that are currently unknown or very poorly known included those between granuloma annulare and osteoarthritis (OR 4.3, p = 1.1×10−4) and pyloric stenosis and ventricular septal defect (OR 12.1, p = 2.0×10−3). Conclusions/Significance Computer programs developed for analyses of “-omic” data can be successfully applied to the area of clinical medicine. The results of the analysis may be useful for hypothesis generation as well as supporting clinical care by reminding clinicians of likely problems associated with a patient's existing problems."

The ASL contains water, ions, and macromolecules. It is believed that ASL volume and composition are tightly regulated to maintain a nonviscous fluid layer for mucociliary clearance by underlying epithelial cells and to support the intrinsic antimicrobial function of defensins and other macromolecules (1.Verkman A.S.

A concern with older measurements of ASL composition involving fluid collection by filter paper or microcapillaries is perturbation of the airway surface and the sampling, by capillary forces, of more fluid than contained in the very thin (tens of microns) ASL layer. Studies using ion-sensitive microelectrodes, although technically demanding and requiring direct contact with the ASL, provided evidence for a nearly isotonic ASL (5.Knowles M.R. Robinson J.M.

Our laboratory developed ratioable fluorescent dyes to measure ASL [Na+] and [Cl−], in which the ASL was fluorescently stained for determination of ion concentrations by ratio imaging microscopy (7.Jayaraman S. Song Y. Vetrivel L. Shankar L. Verkman A.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). ASL salt concentration ([Na+] and [Cl−]) was found to be approximately isotonic in airway epithelial cell cultures, mouse trachea and small airways, and ex vivo human airways, without differences in CFTR deficiency (7.Jayaraman S. Song Y. Vetrivel L. Shankar L. Verkman A.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 8.Song Y. Thiagarajah J. Verkman A.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 122: 511-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We also found the ASL to be approximately isosmolar with serum using fluorescent, osmotically sensitive liposomes (9.Jayaraman S. Song Y. Verkman A.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117: 423-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Relatively little is known about ASL potassium concentration ([K+]) or its regulation. As diagrammed in Fig. 1A, transcellular transport of K+ is believed to involve the coordinated activities of a Na+/K+ pump, Na+/K+/2Cl− cotransporter, and K+ channel(s) at the basolateral membrane and a H+/K+ pump and K+ channel(s) at the apical membrane. The airway epithelium also has significant paracellular ion permeability. There is evidence for functional expression of several types of K+ channels in cell lines derived from airways/lung, including Ca2+-activated, cAMP-activated, and voltage-activated K+ channels (10.Clarke L.L.

Steady state [K+] in a stationary ASL (without fluid convection) should depend on the activities of cell membrane K+ pumps and ion transporters, as well as non-K+ ion channels, such as CFTR and ENaC, which are involved in establishing membrane potentials and thus the electrochemical driving forces for K+ transport. The purpose of this study was to develop a noninvasive fluorescence method to measure [K+] in the ASL and to establish the major determinants of [K+] regulation. Following several years of synthetic chemistry, we developed a series of water-soluble K+ sensors, the first being TAC-Red, in which K+ binding to a triazacryptand (TAC) K+ ionophore results in fluorescence enhancement of a conjugated xanthylium chromophore by a charge transfer quenching mechanism (14.Padmawar P. Yao X. Bloch O. Manley G.T. Verkman A.S. Nat. Methods. 2005; 2: 825-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). TAC-Red was used to follow K+ waves in the extracellular space in brain in a neuroexcitation model of cortical spreading depression. Second generation K+ sensors of different colors, TAC-Crimson (15.Magzoub M. Padmawar P. Dix J.A. Verkman A.S. J. Phys. Chem.

Soc. 2008; 130: 7794-7795Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), work by a similar K+-sensing mechanism but utilize different chromophores. These indicators are selective for K+ under physiological conditions and respond to changes in [K+] in milliseconds or less (15.Magzoub M. Padmawar P. Dix J.A. Verkman A.S. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2006; 110: 21216-21221Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). For the measurements here, we synthesized a dextran conjugate containing TAC-Lime, which has K+-sensitive green fluorescence, and tetramethylrhodamine, a reference chromophore with K+-insensitive red fluorescence. The indicator allowed technically straightforward determination of ASL [K+] in cell culture and in vivo models by fluorescence ratio imaging. The four-step synthesis of the disuccinimidyl ester of TAC-Lime (TAC-Lime-DiSE; Fig. 2A) from TAC-aldehyde was reported previously (16.Namkung W. Padmawar P. Mills A.D. Verkman A.S. J. Am Chem. Soc. 2008; 130: 7794-7795Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Synthesis of the K+-binding TAC-aldehyde involves 17 steps (17.He H. Mortellaro M.A. Leiner M.J. Fraatz R.J. Tusa J.K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 1468-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Conjugation of TAC-Lime-DiSE with amino dextran (10 kDa; Molecular Probes, 4 mol free amine/mol dextran) was accomplished by reacting for 12 h three molar equivalents of TAC-Lime-DiSE with 1 molar equivalent amino dextran in an aqueous solution buffered at pH 7.4. Purification was accomplished by repetitive precipitation in methanol. Subsequent reaction with 1 molar equivalent of tetramethylrhodamine-succinimidyl ester (TMR-SE) was accomplished using the same conditions to yield TLT-dex. A stainless steel perfusion chamber was constructed to accommodate 12-mm-diameter cell culture inserts (Fig. 1B). The chamber was held in a PDMI-2 microincubator (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA) maintained at 37 °C. The perfusates were heated by in-line heater and delivered at 1 ml/min by gravity to accomplish solution exchange in under 20 s. The chamber was surrounded by an enclosure containing air or air/5% CO2, which was humidified using a Fisher-Milligan gas washer (Fisher). A second perfusion chamber was constructed for pig trachea, in which fragments were impaled with four small pins and covered with a stainless steel plate having a central, 10-mm circular opening to visualize the fluorescently stained ASL. Human airway bronchial epithelial cells (non-CF and CF) were cultured at an air-liquid interface at 37 °C in 5% CO2, 95% air as described previously (18.Yamaya M. Finkbeiner W.E. Chun S.Y. Widdicombe J.H. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell Mol. Physiol. 1992; 262: L713-L724Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were dissociated by enzymatic digestion and suspended in a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 medium containing 5% fetal calf serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), gentamicin (50 μg/ml), penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (1 mg/ml), and fungizone (2.5 μg/ml) and seeded at a density of 106 cells/cm2 onto 12-mm Transwell polycarbonate inserts (0.4-μm pore size; Costar, Corning, NY) overlaid with a thin coat (15 μg/cm2) of human placental collagen (Sigma-Aldrich). The next day the cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, and the medium was replaced with ALI medium (19.Fulcher M.L. Gabriel S. Burns K.A. Yankaskas J.R. Randell S.H. Methods Mol. Med. 2005; 107: 183-206PubMed Google Scholar) containing gentamicin, penicillin, and streptomycin at the concentrations given above. The medium was changed every 3 days. Transepithelial resistance was measured using an epithelial volt ohmmeter (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL). The cultures were used 21 days after plating, at which time full mucociliary differentiation was confirmed by histology, resistance was 1008 ± 35 and 976 ± 85 Ω·cm2 in normal and CF cultures, respectively, and a thin ASL film was seen. The range of amiloride-sensitive currents was 2–20 μA/cm2, and CFTR (forskolin)- and CaCC (ATP)-dependent currents were 15–50 μA/cm2. Small quantities of finely ground TLT-dex or rhodamine B-dextran (10 kDa; Molecular Probes) were applied to the ASL as dry powders or after dispersion by probe sonication in low boiling point perfluorocarbon (compound FC-72; boiling point, 56 °C; 3M Company, St. Paul, MN) as described (7.Jayaraman S. Song Y. Vetrivel L. Shankar L. Verkman A.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). TLT-dex was fully dissolved in ASL after 1 h of incubation at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. The concentration of TLT-dex in the ASL was ∼50 μm based on comparative intensity measurements using solution standards. Control fluorescence measurements showed that added TLT-dex could be fully washed off, indicting little endocytosis or surface adhesion. Fluorescence was measured using a Nikon SMZ stereo-zoom epifluorescence microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a P-HR Plan Apo 1.6× objective lens (working distance, 24 mm), Hamamatsu ORCA-ER CCD camera, and custom filter sets for TAC-Lime and TMR (Chroma, Rockingham, VT). Green/red image pairs, each 1-s acquisitions, were obtained from three to five different spots/filter at each time point. The illumination light was shuttered off between image acquisitions. There was less than 1% dye photobleaching after 30 image acquisitions. The fluorescence signal was generally 10-fold greater than background, with <15% variation in ratios in different fields of a cell culture. Mice (25–35 g of body weight) were anesthetized with avertin (200 mg/kg), and body temperature was maintained at 37–38 °C using a heating pad and rectal temperature probe. Following a midline neck incision, a 1–1.5-cm length of trachea was bluntly isolated for direct visualization. As done previously for other dyes (7.Jayaraman S. Song Y. Vetrivel L. Shankar L. Verkman A.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), the ASL was stained by direct disposition of TLT-dex onto the trachea using a microcatheter inserted via the mouth. The mice breathed room air spontaneously. The trachea was stabilized for imaging. Fluorescence images of the trachea were obtained using the Nikon SMZ microscope as described above, where the brightly dye-stained ASL was visualized through the translucent tracheal wall. The images for background subtraction were obtained prior to dye instillation. The mice were sacrificed by pentobarbital overdose at the completion of the measurements. Mouse protocols were approved by the University of California, San Francisco, Committee on Animal Research. ASL thickness was measured using a laser scanning confocal microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan), equipped with a water immersion objective lens (60×; numerical aperture, 1.2; working distance, 270 μm). For these measurements the ASL was covered with high boiling point perfluorocarbon FC70 (3M Company) to prevent evaporation and to allow immersion of the objective lens (refractive index of FC70 is 1.303, similar to that of water 1.3). A stack of 100 images (1 μm apart) was acquired over 40–60 s for reconstruction of x-z and y-z images to determine ASL thickness. To measure ASL thickness in cell cultures, fine solid particles of TLT-dex were deposited onto the ASL. z scanning was done 2 h after ASL staining, with FC-70 covering the cells/ASL. For measurements in pig trachea, pig tracheas were obtained from Pork Power Farms (Turlock, CA) and were generally delivered to the lab on ice within 12 h after animal sacrifice. Small fragments of tracheal mucosa was rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and mounted in the perfusion chamber. The fragment in the perfusion chamber was incubated for 5 h at 37 °C in the CO2 incubator and then stained with dye as done for the cell cultures. ASL images were obtained 1 h after staining. The accuracy of ASL thickness determination was confirmed by measurements of known fluid layers of 5–50 μm between two cover glasses (with objective immersed in FC70 on top of the cover glass). Reported ASL thicknesses are an average from three samples, with at least five different areas averaged for each sample. Human airway bronchial epithelial cells grown on permeable supports (Snapwell; 1.12-cm2 surface area) were mounted in Ussing chambers (Physiologic Instruments, San Diego, CA). The cells were bathed for a 30-min stabilization period in HCO3−-buffered solution and aerated with 95% O2, 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Transepithilial potential difference (PD) and short circuit current (Isc) were measured using EVC4000 multi-channel V/I clamp (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL) and recorded using PowerLab/8sp (AD Instruments Pty Ltd., Castle Hill, Australia). For measurement of PD, electrode zero offset was determined before and after each recording. PD and Isc were recorded continuously with agonists/inhibitors added at specified times. For Isc measurement of apical K+ conductance, the basolateral membrane was permeabilized with amphotericin B (20 μm), valinomycin (10 μm), and nigericin (10 μm), and a K+ gradient was applied; the apical solution contained 140 mm sodium gluconate, 5 mm potassium gluconate, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm CaSO4, 10 mm d-glucose, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) and in the basolateral solution 140 mm sodium gluconate was replaced by potassium gluconate. Apical ENaC was inhibited by 10 μm amiloride. To measure basolateral K+ conductance, the apical membrane was permeabilized with 10 μm amphotericin B, and a K+ gradient was applied. Transepithelial resistance was calculated using Ohm's law from current changes in response to 10-mV pulses. Expression of messenger RNA (mRNA) encoding KCNQ1–5, KCNE1–4, KCNN1–4, and ATP1AL1 was determined by RT-PCR in primary cultured and freshly isolated human bronchial epithelial cells. Total RNA was extracted by using a TRIzol solution (Invitrogen) and was reverse-transcribed by using random hexamer primers and a ribonuclease H− reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The complementary DNA was amplified with specific primers and Taq polymerase (Invitrogen). The primer sequences are provided in Table 1.Table 1PCR primers Immunostaining of human airway epithelial monolayers was performed using antibodies against the KCNQ1 (sc-20816; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), KCNQ3 (AB5597; Chemicon), KCNQ5 (AB5599; Chemicon), and Na+/K+-ATPase α (sc-58628; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Briefly, the monolayers were fixed and permeabilized by incubation in cold methanol for 10 min at −20 °C. Nonspecific binding was reduced by 1 h of incubation with 0.1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% goat serum, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% gelatin at room temperature. After blocking, the monolayers were stained with anti-KCNQ1, KCNQ3, or KCNQ5 antibodies and then treated with Alexa Fluor 594-labeled secondary antibody (Invitrogen). After the first staining, the monolayers were stained with anti-Na+/K+-ATPase antibodies and then with Alexa Fluor 488-labeled secondary antibody. The images were collected using a laser scanning confocal microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) with serial z sections as described above. HBE cells were lysed with cell lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm glycerol phosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). The cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and proteins in the supernatant were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotted using standard procedures (transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, 1 h of blocking in 5% nonfat dry milk, primary/secondary antibody incubations, enhanced chemiluminescence detection). Amiloride, bumetanide, ouabain, tetraethylammonium (TEA), omeprazole, ATP, forskolin, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, (R)-(+)-[(dihydroindenyl)oxy]alkanoic acid (DIOA), clotrimazole, and other chemicals, unless otherwise indicated, were purchased from Sigma. XE991, chromanol 293B, and 1-ethyl-2-benzimidazolinone was purchased from Tocris Bioscience (Ellisville, MO). Bafilomycin A1 was purchased from Calbiochem. CFTRinh-172 and CaCCinh-A01 were synthesized as described (20.Ma T. Thiagarajah J.R. Yang H. Sonawane N.D. Folli C. Galietta L.J. Verkman A.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 1651-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar, 21.De La Fuente R. Namkung W. Mills A. Verkman A.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2008; 73: 758-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The standard HEPES-buffered solution contained 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm d-glucose, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). The HCO3−-buffered solution contained 120 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm d-glucose, 5 mm HEPES, and 25 mm NaHCO3 (pH 7.4). Most of the ASL K+ measurements reported here were done on well differentiated primary cultures of airway epithelial cells from normal (non-CF) humans. Fig. 1A shows the principle plasma membrane transporters expressed on these cells. The cell cultures used for measurements formed a tight epithelium with transepithelial resistance 1008 ± 35 Ω.cm2 (S.E., n = 12) and contained little apical surface fluid. The perfusion chamber used for K+ measurements is shown schematically in Fig. 1B. The insert containing the cultured airway cells was placed in the chamber with the bottom surface perfused continuously and the top (apical) surface exposed for fluorescent dye staining and imaging. The temperature was maintained at 37 °C for most measurements, and the cells were bathed in a humidified atmosphere. The cell cultures expressed ENaC Na+ channels and CFTR Cl− channels, with electrophysiological responses similar to those reported previously (22.Devor D.C. Pilewski J.M. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 1999; 276: C827-C837Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Devor D.C. Bridges R.J. Pilewski J.M. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2000; 279: C461-C479Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 1C shows a representative short circuit current measurement in which ENaC inhibition by amiloride reduced current by 2.7 ± 0.5 μA/cm2 (n = 9). CFTR activation by forskolin increased short circuit current, which was inhibited by the thiazolidinone CFTR inhibitor CFTRinh-172 (20.Ma T. Thiagarajah J.R. Yang H. Sonawane N.D. Folli C. Galietta L.J. Verkman A.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 1651-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). The addition of ATP, which transiently elevates cytoplasmic Ca2+, produced a transient increase in short circuit current caused by activation of Ca2+-dependent Cl− and K+ channels. This current was inhibited by CaCCinh-A01, an inhibitor of calcium-activated Cl− channels (21.De La Fuente R. Namkung W. Mills A. Verkman A.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2008; 73: 758-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Open circuit measurements of transepithelial PD were also done on these cells to evaluate electrochemical driving forces for analysis of ASL [K+] data. Fig. 1D shows a base-line PD of −6.7 ± 0.5 mV (apical side negative, n = 9), which was relatively insensitive to omeprazole and amiloride but sensitive to modulation of CFTR and calcium-activated Cl− channels. As expected, ouabain, an inhibitor of the Na+/K+-ATPase, abolished most of the PD. Measurements of [K+] were done by ratio imaging using a dextran conjugate containing TAC-Lime, whose green fluorescence is K+-sensitive, and TMR, whose red fluorescence is K+-insensitive. Fig. 2A shows the route for synthesis of the dual wavelength K+ indicator TAC-Lime-TMR-dextran (TLT-dex). TAC-Lime-SE, synthesized in four steps from TAC-aldehyde as reported previously (16.Namkung W. Padmawar P. Mills A.D. Verkman A.S. J. Am Chem. Soc. 2008; 130: 7794-7795Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), was conjugated to a 10-kDa amino dextran, together with TMR. Fig. 2B shows fluorescence emission spectra of TLT-dex in solutions containing different [K+]. Fluorescence was excited at a single wavelength of 490 nm. In these studies, [Na+] + [K+] was kept constant; as found previously, the trizazcryptand chromophore is highly selective for K+ versus Na+ (14.Padmawar P. Yao X. Bloch O. Manley G.T. Verkman A.S. Nat. Methods. 2005; 2: 825-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). TLT-dex fluorescence (maximum at 533 nm) increased with increasing [K+], whereas TMR fluorescence (maximum at 582 nm) was not sensitive to [K+], although the tail of the TAC-Lime green fluorescence produced a small K+-dependent fluorescence increase at 584 nm. Fig. 2B (inset) shows that TLT-dex green-to-red fluorescence ratio (Fgreen/Fred) is not sensitive to pH in the range 4.5–8.5. Also, Fgreen/Fred was not sensitive to Ca2+, Cl−, or albumin but was sensitive to the nonphysiological cation Rb+, which is of similar size/charge to K+ (not shown). Fig. 2C shows a curvilinear relationship between Fgreen/Fred and [K+] as measured using the fluorescence microscope, with good sensitivity over a wide concentration range appropriate for measurements of [K+] in extracellular space compartments such as the ASL. For [K+] measurements, the ASL was stained with TLT-dex without the addition of aqueous volume. Image pairs of green and red fluorescence were obtained at three to five different spots on a filter for each time point. Fig. 3A shows fluorescence images of the TLT-dextran-stained ASL in HBE cells together with a pseudocolored ratio image. The ratio image shows similar Fgreen/Fred ratios throughout the stained ASL, with variance of <10%. Fig. 3B shows Fgreen/Fred and deduced [K+] in control and ouabain-treated cell cultures. Fgreen/Fred in untreated perfused cell cultures was generally stable over >60 min. Average Fgreen/Fred for measurements on human bronchial epithelial cell cultures was 0.318 ± 0.002 (S.E., n = 45), corresponding to [K+] of 20.8 ± 0.3 mm, substantially greater than perfusate [K+] of ∼5 mm. Fgreen/Fred ratios were quite reproducible in different regions of each filter. Inhibition of the Na+/K+ pump by ouabain, which largely dissipates cellular electrochemical driving forces, produced a slow decline in Fgreen/Fred to ∼0.18 at 2 h, corresponding to [K+] of ∼7 mm. Fig. 3C shows an in situ calibration where Fgreen/Fred was measured following changes in perfusate [K+] in the presence of K+ ionophores (valinomycin and nigericin) and ouabain, which should approximately equalize ASL and perfusate [K+]. Fgreen/Fred was sensitive to perfusate [K+] in the presence of ionophores/ouabain, with similar Fgreen/Fred versus [K+] as measured in calibration solutions. To investigate whether ASL [K+] resists large changes in perfusate [K+], Fgreen/Fred was measured in untreated cells following changes in perfusate [K+]. ASL [K+] was changed from 13 to 20.6 mm following changes in perfusate [K+] from 2 to 8 mm (Fig. 3D), suggesting active regulation of ASL [K+] involving cell membrane ion transporters. The determinants of ASL [K+] were investigated using a series of modulators of membrane transporters. Fig. 4A shows representative time courses of Fgreen/Fred and deduced [K+] for cultures treated with ATP, TEA (a nonspecific K+ channel blocker), forskolin, and CFTRinh-172. ATP, TEA, and CFTRinh-172 produced significant reductions in ASL [K+], whereas forskolin produced an increase in ASL [K+]. As supported by further studies, below, the reduced ASL [K+] with CFTR inhibition (by CFTRinh-172) and the increased ASL [K+] with CFTR activation (forskolin) are anticipated con"
https://openalex.org/W2068336476,"Background Homeobox genes are essential for embryonic patterning and cell fate determination. They are regulated mostly at the transcriptional level. In particular, Prep1 regulates Hox transcription in association with Pbx proteins. Despite its nuclear role as a transcription factor, Prep1 is located in the cytosol of mouse oocytes from primary to antral follicles. The homeodomain factor Bicoid (Bcd) has been shown to interact with 4EHP (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E homolog protein) to repress translation of Caudal mRNA and to drive Drosophila embryo development. Interestingly, Prep1 contains a putative binding motif for 4EHP, which may reflect a novel unknown function. Methodology/Principal Findings In this paper we show by confocal microscopy and deconvolution analysis that Prep1 and 4EHP co-localize in the cytosol of growing mouse oocytes, demonstrating their interaction by co-immunoprecipitation and pull-down experiments. A functional 4EHP-binding motif present in Prep1 has been also identified by mutagenesis analysis. Moreover, Prep1 inhibits (>95%) the in vitro translation of a luciferase reporter mRNA fused to the Hoxb4 3′UTR, in the presence of 4EHP. RNA electrophoretic mobility shift assay was used to demonstrate that Prep1 binds the Hoxb4 3′UTR. Furthermore, conventional histology and immunohistochemistry has shown a dramatic oocyte growth failure in hypomorphic mouse Prep1i/i females, accompanied by an increased production of Hoxb4. Finally, Hoxb4 overexpression in mouse zygotes showed a slow in vitro development effect. Conclusions Prep1 has a novel cytoplasmic, 4EHP-dependent, function in the regulation of translation. Mechanistically, the Prep1-4EHP interaction might bridge the 3′UTR of Hoxb4 mRNA to the 5′ cap structure. This is the first demonstration that a mammalian homeodomain transcription factor regulates translation, and that this function can be possibly essential for the development of female germ cells and involved in mammalian zygote development."
https://openalex.org/W2079609256,"The nucleocapsid (N) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus plays important roles in both viral replication and modulation of host cell processes. New ligands that target the N protein may thus provide tools to track the protein inside cells, detect interaction hot spots on the protein surface, and discover sites that could be used to develop new anti-SARS therapies. Using mRNA display selection and directed evolution, we designed novel antibody-like protein affinity reagents that target SARS N protein with high affinity and selectivity. Our libraries were based on an 88-residue variant of the 10th fibronectin type III domain from human fibronectin (10Fn3). This selection resulted in eight independent 10Fn3 intrabodies, two that require the N-terminal domain for binding and six that recognize the C terminus, one with Kd=1.7 nM. 10Fn3 intrabodies are well expressed in mammalian cells and are relocalized by N in SARS-infected cells. Seven of the selected intrabodies tested do not perturb cellular function when expressed singly in vivo and inhibit virus replication from 11- to 5900-fold when expressed in cells prior to infection. Targeting two sites on SARS-N simultaneously using two distinct 10Fn3s results in synergistic inhibition of virus replication."
https://openalex.org/W2166760771,"Carbon dioxide (CO2) is among the most important gases for all organisms. Its reversible interconversion to bicarbonate (HCO3−) reaches equilibrium spontaneously, but slowly, and can be accelerated by a ubiquitous group of enzymes called carbonic anhydrases (CAs). These enzymes are grouped by their distinct structural features into α-, β-, γ-, δ- and ζ-classes. While physiological functions of mammalian, prokaryotic, plant and algal CAs have been extensively studied over the past years, the role of β-CAs in yeasts and the human pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans has been elucidated only recently, and the function of CAs in multicellular filamentous ascomycetes is mostly unknown. To assess the role of CAs in the development of filamentous ascomycetes, the function of three genes, cas1, cas2 and cas3 (carbonic anhydrase of Sordaria) encoding β-class carbonic anhydrases was characterized in the filamentous ascomycetous fungus Sordaria macrospora. Fluorescence microscopy was used to determine the localization of GFP- and DsRED-tagged CAs. While CAS1 and CAS3 are cytoplasmic enzymes, CAS2 is localized to the mitochondria. To assess the function of the three isoenzymes, we generated knock-out strains for all three cas genes (Δcas1, Δcas2, and Δcas3) as well as all combinations of double mutants. No effect on vegetative growth, fruiting-body and ascospore development was seen in the single mutant strains lacking cas1 or cas3, while single mutant Δcas2 was affected in vegetative growth, fruiting-body development and ascospore germination, and the double mutant strain Δcas1/2 was completely sterile. Defects caused by the lack of cas2 could be partially complemented by elevated CO2 levels or overexpression of cas1, cas3, or a non-mitochondrial cas2 variant. The results suggest that CAs are required for sexual reproduction in filamentous ascomycetes and that the multiplicity of isoforms results in redundancy of specific and non-specific functions."
https://openalex.org/W1978964143,"Background Retroviral LTRs, paired or single, influence the transcription of both retroviral and non-retroviral genomic sequences. Vertebrate genomes contain many thousand endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) and their LTRs. Single LTRs are difficult to detect from genomic sequences without recourse to repetitiveness or presence in a proviral structure. Understanding of LTR structure increases understanding of LTR function, and of functional genomics. Here we develop models of orthoretroviral LTRs useful for detection in genomes and for structural analysis. Principal Findings Although mutated, ERV LTRs are more numerous and diverse than exogenous retroviral (XRV) LTRs. Hidden Markov models (HMMs), and alignments based on them, were created for HML- (human MMTV-like), general-beta-, gamma- and lentiretroviruslike LTRs, plus a general-vertebrate LTR model. Training sets were XRV LTRs and RepBase LTR consensuses. The HML HMM was most sensitive and detected 87% of the HML LTRs in human chromosome 19 at 96% specificity. By combining all HMMs with a low cutoff, for screening, 71% of all LTRs found by RepeatMasker in chromosome 19 were found. HMM consensus sequences had a conserved modular LTR structure. Target site duplications (TG-CA), TATA (occasionally absent), an AATAAA box and a T-rich region were prominent features. Most of the conservation was located in, or adjacent to, R and U5, with evidence for stem loops. Several of the long HML LTRs contained long ORFs inserted after the second A rich module. HMM consensus alignment allowed comparison of functional features like transcriptional start sites (sense and antisense) between XRVs and ERVs. Conclusion The modular conserved and redundant orthoretroviral LTR structure with three A-rich regions is reminiscent of structurally relaxed Giardia promoters. The five HMMs provided a novel broad range, repeat-independent, ab initio LTR detection, with prospects for greater generalisation, and insight into LTR structure, which may aid development of LTR-targeted pharmaceuticals."
https://openalex.org/W2065992040,"p73 encodes multiple functionally distinct isoforms. Proapoptotic TAp73 isoforms contain a transactivation (TA) domain, and like p53, have tumor suppressor properties and are activated by chemotherapies to induce cell death. In contrast, antiapoptotic ΔNp73 isoforms lack the TA domain and are dominant-negative inhibitors of p53 and TAp73. ΔNp73 proteins are overexpressed in a variety of tumors including neuroblastoma. Thus, identification of drugs that upregulate TAp73 and/or downregulate ΔNp73 represents a potential therapeutic strategy. Here, we report that cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors induce apoptosis independent of p53, and differentially modulate endogenous p73 isoforms in neuroblastoma and other tumors. COX inhibitor-mediated apoptosis is associated with the induction of TAp73β and its target genes. COX inhibitors also downregulate the alternative-spliced ΔNp73AS isoforms, Δexon2 and Δexon2/3. Furthermore, forced expression of ΔNp73AS results in diminished apoptosis in response to the selective COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib. Celecoxib-mediated downregulation of ΔNp73AS is associated with decreased E2F1 levels and diminished E2F1 activation of the p73 promoter. These results provide the first evidence that COX inhibitors differentially modulate p73 isoforms leading to enhanced apoptosis, and support the potential use of COX inhibitors as novel regulators of p73 to enhance chemosensitivity in tumors with deregulated E2F1 and in those with wild-type (wt) or mutant p53."
https://openalex.org/W2088278672,"The commitment of multi-potent cortical progenitors to a neuronal fate depends on the transient induction of the basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family of transcription factors including Neurogenin 1 (Neurog1). Previous studies have focused on mechanisms that control the expression of these proteins while little is known about whether their pro-neural activities can be regulated by kinase signaling pathways. Using primary cultures and ex vivo slice cultures, here we report that both the transcriptional and pro-neural activities of Neurog1 are regulated by extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 5 signaling in cortical progenitors. Activation of ERK5 potentiated, while blocking ERK5 inhibited Neurog1-induced neurogenesis. Furthermore, endogenous ERK5 activity was required for Neurog1-initiated transcription. Interestingly, ERK5 activation was sufficient to induce Neurog1 phosphorylation and ERK5 directly phosphorylated Neurog1 in vitro. We identified S179/S208 as putative ERK5 phosphorylation sites in Neurog1. Mutations of S179/S208 to alanines inhibited the transcriptional and pro-neural activities of Neurog1. Our data identify ERK5 phosphorylation of Neurog1 as a novel mechanism regulating neuronal fate commitment of cortical progenitors."
https://openalex.org/W2007506979,"Salt-sensitive yeast mutants were deployed to characterize a gene encoding a C2H2 zinc finger protein (CaZF) that is differentially expressed in a drought-tolerant variety of chickpea (Cicer arietinum) and provides salinity-tolerance in transgenic tobacco. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae most of the cellular responses to hyper-osmotic stress is regulated by two interconnected pathways involving high osmolarity glycerol mitogen-activated protein kinase (Hog1p) and Calcineurin (CAN), a Ca2+/calmodulin-regulated protein phosphatase 2B. In this study, we report that heterologous expression of CaZF provides osmotolerance in S. cerevisiae through Hog1p and Calcineurin dependent as well as independent pathways. CaZF partially suppresses salt-hypersensitive phenotypes of hog1, can and hog1can mutants and in conjunction, stimulates HOG and CAN pathway genes with subsequent accumulation of glycerol in absence of Hog1p and CAN. CaZF directly binds to stress response element (STRE) to activate STRE-containing promoter in yeast. Transactivation and salt tolerance assays of CaZF deletion mutants showed that other than the transactivation domain a C-terminal domain composed of acidic and basic amino acids is also required for its function. Altogether, results from this study suggests that CaZF is a potential plant salt-tolerance determinant and also provide evidence that in budding yeast expression of HOG and CAN pathway genes can be stimulated in absence of their regulatory enzymes to provide osmotolerance."
https://openalex.org/W2136364680,"The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying fibromyalgia are still unknown, although some evidence points to endogenous opioid dysfunction. We examined how endogenous opioid antagonism affects pain and mood for women with and without fibromyalgia. Ten women with fibromyalgia and ten age- and gender-matched, healthy controls each attended two laboratory sessions. Each participant received naltrexone (50mg) at one session, and placebo at the other session, in a randomized and double-blind fashion. Participants were tested for changes in sensitivity to heat, cold, and mechanical pain. Additionally, we collected measures of mood and opioid withdrawal symptoms during the laboratory sessions and at home the night following each session. At baseline, the fibromyalgia group exhibited more somatic complaints, greater sensory sensitivity, more opioid withdrawal somatic symptoms, and lower mechanical and cold pain-tolerance than did the healthy control group. Neither group experienced changes in pain sensitivity due to naltrexone administration. Naltrexone did not differentially affect self-reported withdrawal symptoms, or mood, in the fibromyalgia and control groups. Consistent with prior research, there was no evidence found for abnormal endogenous opioid activity in women with fibromyalgia."
https://openalex.org/W2009850334,"Background After IR stress, DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) occur and repair proteins (RPs) bind to them, generating DSB-RP complexes (DSBCs), which results in repaired DSBs (RDSBs). In recent experimental studies, it is suggested that the ATM proteins detect these DNA lesions depending on the autophosphorylation of ATM which exists as a dimer before phosphorylation. Interestingly, the ATM proteins can work as a sensor for a small number of DSBs (approximately 18 DSBs in a cell after exposure to IR). Thus the ATM proteins amplify the small input signals based on the phosphorylation of the ATM dimer proteins. The true DSB-detection mechanism depending on ATM autophosphorylation has yet to be clarified. Methodology/Principal Findings We propose a mathematical model for the detection mechanism of DSBs by ATM. Our model includes both a DSB-repair mechanism and an ATM-phosphorylation mechanism. We model the former mechanism as a stochastic process, and obtain theoretical mean values of DSBs and DSBCs. In the latter mechanism, it is known that ATM autophosphorylates itself, and we find that the autophosphorylation induces bifurcation of the phosphorylated ATM (ATM*). The bifurcation diagram depends on the total concentration of ATM, which makes three types of steady state diagrams of ATM*: monostable, reversible bistable, and irreversible bistable. Bistability exists depending on the Hill coefficient in the equation of ATM autophosphorylation, and it emerges as the total concentration of ATM increases. Combining these two mechanisms, we find that ATM* exhibits switch-like behaviour in the presence of bistability, and the detection time after DNA damage decreases when the total concentration of ATM increases. Conclusions/Significance This work provides a mathematical model that explains the DSB-detection mechanism depending on ATM autophosphorylation. These results indicate that positive auto-regulation works both as a sensor and amplifier of small input signals."
https://openalex.org/W2068311918,"In human Niemann-Pick Type C (NPC) disease, endosomal trafficking defects lead to an accumulation of free cholesterol and other lipids in late endosome/lysosome (LE/LY) compartments, a subsequent block in cholesterol esterification and significantly reduced cholesterol efflux out of the cell. Here we report that nucleotide cycling or cellular knockdown of the small GTP-binding protein, ARF6, markedly impacts cholesterol homeostasis. Unregulated ARF6 activation attenuates the NPC phenotype at least in part by decreasing cholesterol accumulation and restoring normal sphingolipid trafficking. These effects depend on ARF6-stimulated cholesterol efflux out of the endosomal recycling compartment, a major cell repository for free cholesterol. We also show that fibroblasts derived from different NPC patients displayed varying levels of ARF6 that is GTP-bound, which correlate with their response to sustained ARF6 activation. These studies support emerging evidence that early endocytic defects impact NPC disease and suggest that such heterogeneity in NPC disease could result in diverse responses to therapeutic interventions aimed at modulating the trafficking of lipids."
https://openalex.org/W2025380209,"Kinetochores are considered to be the key structures that physically connect spindle microtubules to the chromosomes and play an important role in chromosome segregation during mitosis. Due to different mechanisms of spindle assembly between centrosome-containing mitotic cells and acentrosomal meiotic oocytes, it is unclear how a meiotic spindle generates the poleward forces to drive two rounds of meiotic chromosome segregation to achieve genome haploidization. We took advantage of the fact that DNA beads are able to induce bipolar spindle formation without kinetochores and studied the behavior of DNA beads in the induced spindle in mouse eggs during meiosis II. Interestingly, DNA beads underwent poleward movements that were similar in timing and speed to the meiotic chromosomes, although all the beads moved together to the same spindle pole. Disruption of dynein function abolished the poleward movements of DNA beads but not of the meiotic chromosomes, suggesting the existence of different dynein-dependent and dynein-independent force generation mechanisms for the chromosome poleward movement, and the latter may be dependent on the presence of kinetochores. Consistent with the observed DNA bead poleward movement, sperm haploid chromatin (which also induced bipolar spindle formation after injection to a metaphase egg without forming detectable kinetochore structures) also underwent similar poleward movement at anaphase as DNA beads. The results suggest that in the chromatin-induced meiotic spindles, kinetochore attachments to spindle microtubules are not absolutely required for chromatin poleward movements at anaphase."
https://openalex.org/W1993532354,"Background Ectromelia virus (ECTV) is the causative agent of mousepox, a lethal disease of mice with similarities to human smallpox. Mousepox progression involves replication at the initial site of infection, usually the skin, followed by a rapid spread to the secondary replicative organs, spleen and liver, and finally a dissemination to the skin, where the typical rash associated with this and other orthopoxviral induced diseases appears. Case fatality rate is genetically determined and reaches up to 100% in susceptible mice strains. Like other poxviruses, ECTV encodes a number of proteins with immunomodulatory potential, whose role in mousepox progression remains largely undescribed. Amongst these is a secreted homologue of the cellular tumour necrosis factor receptor superfamily member CD30 which has been proposed to modulate a Th1 immune response in vivo. Methodology/Principal Findings To evaluate the contribution of viral CD30 (vCD30) to virus pathogenesis in the infected host, we have adapted a novel transient dominant method for the selection of recombinant ECTVs. Using this method, we have generated an ECTV vCD30 deletion mutant, its corresponding revertant control virus as well as a virus encoding the extracellular domain of murine CD30. These viruses contain no exogenous marker DNA sequences in their genomes, as opposed to other ECTVs reported up to date. Conclusions/Significance We show that the vCD30 is expressed as a secreted disulfide linked trimer and that the absence of vCD30 does not impair mousepox induced fatality in vivo. Replacement of vCD30 by a secreted version of mouse CD30 caused limited attenuation of ECTV. The recombinant viruses generated may be of use in the study of the role of the cellular CD30-CD30L interaction in the development of the immune response. The method developed might be useful for the construction of ECTV mutants for the study of additional genes."
https://openalex.org/W1983834407,"Background When we move along in time with a piece of music, we synchronise the downward phase of our gesture with the beat. While it is easy to demonstrate this tendency, there is considerable debate as to its neural origins. It may have a structural basis, whereby the gravitational field acts as an orientation reference that biases the formulation of motor commands. Alternatively, it may be functional, and related to the economy with which motion assisted by gravity can be generated by the motor system. Methodology/Principal Findings We used a robotic system to generate a mathematical model of the gravitational forces acting upon the hand, and then to reverse the effect of gravity, and invert the weight of the limb. In these circumstances, patterns of coordination in which the upward phase of rhythmic hand movements coincided with the beat of a metronome were more stable than those in which downward movements were made on the beat. When a normal gravitational force was present, movements made down-on-the-beat were more stable than those made up-on-the-beat. Conclusions/Significance The ubiquitous tendency to make a downward movement on a musical beat arises not from the perception of gravity, but as a result of the economy of action that derives from its exploitation."
