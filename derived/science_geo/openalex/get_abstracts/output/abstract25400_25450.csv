https://openalex.org/W1994425461,"Although many combinations of alpha beta T cell receptors are available to the T cells in any given organism, far fewer are actually used by mature T cells. The combinations used are limited by two selective processes, positive selection of T cells bearing receptors that will be useful to the host, and clonal elimination or inactivation of T cells bearing receptors that will be damaging to the host. The ways in which these two apparently contradictory processes occur, and the hypotheses that have been suggested to reconcile them, are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1966388921,"The ability to discriminate between self and nonself antigens is vital to the functioning of the immune system as a specific defense against invading microorganisms. Failure of the immune system to ""tolerate"" self tissues can result in pathological autoimmune states leading to debilitating illness and sometimes death. The induction of autoimmunity involves genetic and environmental factors that have focused the attention of researchers on the trimolecular complex formed by major histocompatibility complex molecules, antigen, and T cell receptors. Detailed molecular characterization of these components points to potential strategies for disease intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2081990092,"Human hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis of the Dutch type (HCHWA-D), an autosomal dominant form of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), is characterized by extensive amyloid deposition in the small leptomeningeal arteries and cortical arterioles, which lead to an early death of those afflicted in their fifth or sixth decade. Immunohistochemical and biochemical studies have indicated that the amyloid subunit in HCHWA-D is antigenically related to and homologous in sequence with the amyloid beta protein isolated from brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease and Down syndrome. The amyloid beta protein is encoded by the amyloid beta protein precursor (APP) gene located on chromosome 21. Restriction fragment length polymorphisms detected by the APP gene were used to examine whether this gene is a candidate for the genetic defect in HCHWA-D. The data indicate that the APP gene is tightly linked to HCHWA-D and therefore, in contrast to familial Alzheimer's disease, cannot be excluded as the site of mutation in HCHWA-D."
https://openalex.org/W2162559297,"Regulated expression of bacterial genes allows a pathogen to adapt to new environmental conditions within the host. The synthesis of over 30 Salmonella proteins is selectively induced during infection of macrophages. Two proteins induced by Salmonella are the heat shock proteins GroEL and DnaK. Two avirulent, macrophage-sensitive mutants of Salmonella synthesize GroEL and DnaK but fail to synthesize different subsets of proteins normally induced within the macrophage. Enhanced expression of selected Salmonella proteins contributes to bacterial survival within macrophages and may also contribute to the apparent immunodominance of heat shock proteins."

https://openalex.org/W2019522474,"During development in the thymus, T cells are rendered tolerant to self antigens. It is now apparent that thymocytes bearing self-reactive T cell receptors can be tolerized by processes that result in physical elimination (clonal deletion) or functional inactivation (clonal anergy). As these mechanisms have important clinical implications for transplantation and autoimmunity, current investigations are focused on understanding the cellular and molecular interactions that generate these forms of tolerance."
https://openalex.org/W1568329054,"The egg yolk of immunized chicken is a rich and inexpensive source of specific polyclonal antibodies. In this paper we show that 20-30 micrograms of a highly conserved mammalian protein, as exemplified by proliferating cell nuclear antigen, are sufficient to induce an immune response. Immunoblot analysis revealed that specific antibodies appeared 20 days after immunization, reached a plateau after 30 days, and remained high until at least day 81. A total amount of 4 g immunoglobulin was extracted from 62 eggs of one immunized hen, yielding approximately 130 mg of specific antibodies."
https://openalex.org/W1963526989,"To understand the function of murine homeobox genes, a genetic analysis is mandatory. We generated gain-of-function mutants by introducing genomic sequences of the Hox-1.1 gene under the control of a chicken β-actin promoter into mice. Our previous data had shown that these transgenic mice are nonviable after birth and are born with craniofacial abnormalities. In a subsequent detailed analysis of severely affected animals, malformations of the basioccipital bone, the atlas, and the axis were observed. Manifestation of an additional vertebra, a proatlas, occurred at the craniocervical transition. The dominant interference of the Hox-1.1 transgene with developmental programs seems to occur around day 9 of gestation, the time of neural crest migration and somite differentiation. We discuss the resulting phenotype with respect to a developmental control function of Hox-1.1."
https://openalex.org/W2005855139,"The alpha beta T cell receptor (TCR) recognizes antigens that are presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-encoded cell surface molecules by binding to both the antigen and the MHC molecules. Discrimination of self from nonself antigens and MHC molecules is achieved by negative and positive selection of T cells in the thymus: potentially harmful T cells with receptors that bind to self antigens plus self MHC molecules are deleted before they can mount immune responses. In contrast, the maturation of useful T cells with receptors that bind foreign antigens plus self MHC molecules requires the binding of their receptor to MHC molecules on thymic epithelium in the absence of foreign antigen. The binding of the TCR to either class I or class II MHC molecules directs differentiation of the selected cells into either CD4-8+ (killer) or CD4+8- (helper) T cells, respectively."

https://openalex.org/W2105695958,"We have characterized the fetal totipotent hematopoietic stem cell using a novel strategy that integrates physical analysis of cell properties and genetic analysis of in vivo developmental behavior. This approach allows the simultaneous isolation and in vivo characterization of any stem cell population. Using this procedure we demonstrate that a cell surface marker, recognized by monoclonal antibody AA4.1, defines 0.5%-1.0% of fetal liver tissue that contains the entire hierarchy of primitive hematopoietic cells. The AA4.1+ subpopulation includes multipotential in vitro progenitors, CFU-S cells, and lymphoid-myeloid stem cells that function to yield permanent and oligoclonal blood systems. Further fractionation of these cells by analysis of density, fibronectin binding, and surface antigen distribution has defined 0.1%-0.2% of fetal liver that contains the totipotent stem cell."

https://openalex.org/W2058896674,"The v-erbA oncogene, one of the two oncogenes of the avian erythroblastosis virus, efficiently blocks erythroid differentiation and suppresses erythrocyte-specific gene transcription. Here we show that the overex-pressed thyroid hormone receptor c-erbA effectively modulates erythroid differentiation and erythrocyte-specific gene expression in a T3-dependent fashion, when introduced into erythroid cells via a retrovirus. In contrast, the endogenous thyroid hormone receptor does not detectably affect erythroid differentiation. The analysis of a series of chimeric v-/c-erbA proteins suggests that the v-erbA oncoprotein has lost one type of thyroid hormone receptor function (regulating erythrocyte gene transcription in response to T3), but constitutively displays another function: it represses transcription in the absence of T3. The region responsible for the loss of hormone-dependent regulator activity of v-erbA has been mapped to the very C-terminus of c-erbA, encompassing a cluster of highly conserved amino acid residues with the potential to form an amphipathic α-helix."

https://openalex.org/W1481699366,"Development of multidrug resistance due to overexpression of P-glycoprotein (Pgp), a cell membrane drug efflux pump, occurs commonly during in vitro selections with adriamycin (Adr). Pgp-mediated drug resistance can be overcome by the calcium channel blocker verapamil (Vp), which acts as a competitive inhibitor of drug binding and efflux. In order to identify other mechanisms of Adr resistance, we isolated an Adr-resistant subline by selecting the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 with incremental increases of Adr in the presence of 10 microgram/ml verapamil. The resultant MCF-7/AdrVp subline is 900-fold resistant to Adr, does not overexpress Pgp, and does not exhibit a decrease in Adr accumulation. It exhibits a unique cross-resistance pattern: high cross-resistance to the potent Adr analogue 3'-deamino-3'-(3-cyano-4-morpholinyl)doxorubicin, lower cross-resistance to the alkylating agent melphalan, and a sensitivity similar to the parental cell line to vinblastine. The levels of glutathione and glutathione S-transferase are similar in the parental line and the Adr-resistant subline. Topoisomerase II-DNA complexes measured by the potassium-sodium dodecyl sulfate precipitation method shows a 2-3 fold decrease in the resistant subline. The MCF-7/AdrVp cells overexpress a novel membrane protein with an apparent molecular mass of 95 kDa. Polyclonal antibodies raised against the P-95 protein demonstrate a correaltion between the level of expression and Adr resistance. Removal of Adr but not verapamil from the selection media results in a decline in P-95 protein levels that parallels a restoration of sensitivity to Adr. Immunohistochemistry demonstrates localization of the P-95 protein on the cell surface. The demonstration of high levels of the protein in clinical samples obtained from patients refractory to Adr suggests that this protein may play a role in clinical drug resistance."
https://openalex.org/W1496152087,"Studies were undertaken to identify the protein kinase(s) responsible for P-glycoprotein phosphorylation in multidrug-resistant (KB-V1) human carcinoma cells and to elucidate the functional role of phosphorylation. P-glycoprotein migrated on sodium dodecyl sulfate gels with apparent Mr 150,000 and is termed P150. When KB-V1 membrane vesicles were incubated with [gamma-32P] ATP, P150 was phosphorylated by an endogenous kinase that exhibited properties of membrane-inserted protein kinase C (PKC). Both membrane-bound P150 and purified P150 served as effective substrates for highly purified rat brain PKC which incorporated approximately 0.6 mol of phosphate/mol of P150. Enzyme assays showed that KB-V1 cells exhibit 4-fold higher PKC activity compared with the drug-sensitive KB-3 cell line. The basal phosphorylation of P150 observed in 32P-labeled cells was increased 2-fold by phorbol ester (PMA) treatment and reduced 30% by treatment with the isoquinolinsulfonamide H-7. Phosphopeptide maps of partially digested P150, phosphorylated either in vitro with PKC or in intact 32P-labeled control or PMA-stimulated cells, were indistinguishable from one another. Drug accumulation assays revealed that PMA treatment of KB-V1 cells significantly reduced [3H]vinblastine accumulation induced by verapamil or by tetrandrine. The results suggest that PKC is primarily responsible for P150 phosphorylation in KB-V1 cells and that phosphorylation may play a modulatory role in the drug transport process."
https://openalex.org/W1985001613,"The modulation of Ca2+ currents by the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate and its analogs was investigated in hippocampal neurons in culture. In the presence of glutamate receptor-gated ion channel antagonists, all of the analogs tested caused either a small reversible depression or had no effect on the Ca2+ current. However, in neurons dialyzed with GTPyS, quisqualate and glutamate but not NMDA, kainate, AMPA, or l-APB caused marked and irreversible depressions of the Ca2+ current. This inhibition was only observed if Ca2+ was present in either the internal or external medium. Intracellular H-7, staurosporine, IP3, cAMP, cGMP, or calmodulin inhibitors failed to prevent the quisqualate-induced Ca2+ current inhibition. These observations are consistent with an interaction between a G protein-coupled glutamate receptor and Ca2+ channels."
https://openalex.org/W1965117722,"We report the developmental effects of expressing an Ultrabithorax (Ubx) product under the hsp70 promoter. Heat induction gives rise to a high, ubiquitous expression of Ubx product that lasts for several hours. We find that whether or not the overexpression of Ubx has a developmental effect on a particular body region of the larva depends on the interactions with the resident homeotic genes. In head and thorax the Ubx product overrides Sex combs reduced, Antennapedia, and probably other homeotic genes and dictates its own developmental program. In abdominal segments A1-A8 the overexpressed Ubx product establishes a normal pattern, alone (A1) or in combination with abdominal-A (A2-A4) and Abdominal-B (A5-A8), indicating that the excess of product is irrelevant. In segment A9 the highly expressed Ubx product is phenotypically suppressed by the r product of Abdominal-B. The presence of high levels of Ubx protein is also irrelevant in the telson."

https://openalex.org/W1972336344,"Tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT) gene expression is liver specific and inducible by glucocorticoids and via the cAMP signaling pathway. In fibroblasts and other nonliver cells the gene is subject to negative control by the trans-dominant tissue-specific extinguisher locus Tse-1. We identified a hepatocyte-specific enhancer that is repressed by Tse-1. Two distinct sequence motifs are absolutely essential for function of this enhancer: a cAMP response element (CRE), which is the target for repression by Tse-1, and a hepatocyte-specific element. The specificity of the enhancer is generated by the combination of these two essential elements, which are fully interdependent. In vivo footprinting indicates that Tse-1 acts by affecting protein binding at the CRE. A direct antagonism between Tse-1 and the cAMP signaling pathway suggests that Tse-1 plays a role in control of developmental activation of the TAT gene."

https://openalex.org/W55514778,"P-glycoprotein is an integral membrane protein that is overproduced in multidrug-resistant cells. It is likely to function as an energy-dependent drug efflux pump to maintain intracellular drug concentrations below cytotoxic levels. Individually isolated multidrug-resistant murine cell lines, J7.V1-1 and J7.V3-1, overproduce P-glycoproteins encoded by the mdr1b and mdr1a genes, respectively. The transport properties of these cell lines and the drug binding characteristics of their P-glycoproteins have been compared. It is concluded that 1) the mdr1a gene product is a more efficient efflux pump than the mdr1b gene product, and 2) whereas a single class of vinblastine binding sites is present in J7.V1-1 membrane vesicles, there appears to be two classes of such sites in J7.V3-1 membrane vesicles. The effects of verapamil and progesterone, two compounds that are known to interact with P-glycoprotein, have been analyzed in the two cell lines. Progesterone inhibited drug binding and efflux and increased drug sensitivity to vinblastine with more potency in J7.V1-1 cells than in J7.V3-1 cells. It is concluded that progesterone, but not verapamil, can be used to differentiate the two mdr gene products in the mouse."
https://openalex.org/W2091132263,"Clinical transplantation is often complicated by rejection episodes, in which the immune system of the recipient reacts to the foreign transplantation (HLA) antigens on the graft. This immune response includes humoral and cellular components. In the first, B lymphocytes form antibodies to the HLA alloantigens. In the second, CD8+ T lymphocytes recognize and react to HLA class I antigens, and CD4+ T cells react to HLA class II antigens. The frequency and severity of these rejection episodes can be diminished by immunosuppressive drugs, HLA matching between donor and recipient, and immune modulation by blood transfusion. Effective HLA matching between donor and recipient is not always possible and often not necessary. Insight into the factors that influence the T and B cell repertoire after blood transfusion might lead to new approaches to improve graft survival."
https://openalex.org/W1486614317,"This study examines the effect of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) on the expression of Type I and II transglutaminase in normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEK cells). Treatment of undifferentiated NHEK cells with 100 pM TGF-beta 1 caused a 10- to 15-fold increase in the activity of a soluble transglutaminase. Based on its cellular distribution and immunoreactivity this transglutaminase was identified as Type II (tissue) transglutaminase. TGF-beta 1 did not enhance the levels of the membrane-bound Type I (epidermal) transglutaminase activity which is induced during squamous cell differentiation and did not increase Type II transglutaminase activity in differentiated NHEK cells. Several SV40 large T antigen-immortalized NHEK cell lines also exhibited a dramatic increase in transglutaminase Type II activity after TGF-beta 1 treatment; however, TGF-beta 1 did not induce any significant change in transglutaminase activity in the carcinoma-derived cell lines SCC-13, SCC-15, and SQCC/Y1. Half-maximal stimulation of transglutaminase Type II activity in NHEK cells occurred at a dose of 15 pM TGF-beta 1. TGF-beta 2 was about equally effective. This enhancement in transglutaminase activity was related to an increase in the amount of transglutaminase Type II protein as indicated by immunoblot analysis. Northern blot analyses using a specific cDNA probe for Type II transglutaminase showed that exposure of NHEK cells to TGF-beta 1 caused a marked increase in the mRNA levels of this enzyme which could be observed as early as 4 h after the addition of TGF-beta 1. Maximal induction of transglutaminase Type II mRNA occurred between 18 and 24 h. The increase in Type II transglutaminase mRNA levels was blocked by the presence of cycloheximide, suggesting that this increase in mRNA by TGF-beta 1 is dependent on protein synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2076590795,Fushi tarazu and engrailed are two of the genes required for proper segmentation of the Drosophila embryo. Their protein products Fushi tarazu and Engrailed (Ftz and En) each contain a homeodomain and have been shown to act as transcriptional regulators in transient expression experiments in a Drosophila cell culture system. We used an in vitro transcription system to test whether the effects of Ftz and En on transcription were direct or indirect. Purified Ftz directly activates in vitro transcription by binding to homeodomain binding sites inserted upstream of the TATA box of the Drosophila hsp70 promoter. Equimolar amounts of purified En repress this activation by competition with Ftz for binding to these sites. These results indicate that Ftz and En act directly as transcription factors and suggest that such homeodomain proteins regulate development by combinatorial transcriptional control.
https://openalex.org/W1560414009,"The cDNA of human medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCADH) was modified by in vitro mutagenesis, and the sequence encoding the mature form of MCADH was introduced into an inducible expression plasmid. We observed synthesis of the protein in Escherichia coli cells transformed with this plasmid with measurable MCADH enzyme activity in cell extracts. Glutamic acid 376, which has been proposed by Powell and Thorpe (Powell, P. J., and Thorpe, J. (1988) Biochemistry 27, 8022-8028) as an essential residue and the proton-abstracting base at the active site of the enzyme, was mutated to glutamine. After expression in bacteria of this plasmid, the corresponding extracts show no detectable MCADH activity, although mutant MCADH-protein production was detected by protein immunoblots. The mature enzyme and the Gln376 mutant were purified to apparent homogeneity. The wild-type enzyme is a yellow protein due to the content of stoichiometric FAD and had a specific activity which is 50% of MCADH purified from pig kidney. The Gln376 mutant is devoid of activity (less than 0.02% that of wild type, expressed enzyme) and is green because of bound CoA persulfide. Properties of the mutant enzyme suggest that the Glu376----Gln change specifically affects substrate binding. These results prove that Glu376 plays an important role in the initial step of dehydrogenation catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W2075068097,"Using neurotoxicity and inositol phosphate release as criteria for receptor expression, we report the differential expression of excitatory amino acid receptor subtypes in cerebellar granule cells grown in serum-free media containing either high (25 mM) or low (5 mM) KCl. NMDA receptors are expressed in neurons grown in high, but not low, KCl. In contrast, ionotropic quisqualate receptors are expressed in neurons grown in low KCl, but not in those grown in high KCl. Addition of NMDA to cultures containing low KCl appears to mimic high KCl conditions: NMDA receptors are expressed, but ionotropic quisqualate receptors are not. Glutamate and kainate are toxic to cells grown in either condition."
https://openalex.org/W2167930952,"The stereochemical course of the reaction catalyzed by guanylate cyclase from bovine retinal rod outer segments was investigated using phosphorothioate analogs of GTP as chiral probes. (Sp)-Guanosine 5'-O-(1-thiotriphosphate) (Sp-GTP alpha S) is a substrate, whereas (Rp)-GTP alpha S is a competitive inhibitor (K1 = 0.1 mM), but not a substrate. (Sp)-GTP alpha S is converted into (Rp)-guanosine 3':5'-monophosphorothioate, showing that the reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration at the alpha-phosphorus atom. Km and Vmax for (Sp)-GTP alpha S (at low [Ca2+], 20 nM) are 3.7 mM and 1.1 nmol/min/mg of rhodopsin, respectively, compared with 1.1 mM and 23.1 nmol/min/mg of rhodopsin for GTP. Vmax for the cyclization of (Sp)-GTP alpha S, as for GTP, increases 10-20-fold when the calcium level is lowered. This activity change is centered at approximately 90 nM and has a Hill coefficient of 4.8. The configuration of the metal-substrate complex was determined by measuring the effectiveness of the Sp and Rp isomers of GTP alpha S and guanosine 5'-O-(2-thiotriphosphate) (GTP beta S) in the presence of Mg2+ or Mn2+. (Sp)-GTP alpha S is a substrate with either Mg2+ or Mn2+, whereas (Rp)-GTP beta S is a substrate with only Mn2+. These findings suggest that the substrate is a metal-beta, gamma-bidentate complex with delta screwsense. We also found that the cyclization reaction catalyzed by the membrane-bound guanylate cyclase from sea urchin sperm proceeds with inversion of configuration at the alpha-phosphorus atom. The stereochemical course of the reactions catalyzed by all prokaryotic and eukaryotic adenylate cyclases and guanylate cyclases studied thus far is the same."
https://openalex.org/W1607893811,"Prolidase (peptidase D) catalyzes hydrolysis of the di- and tripeptide with carboxyl-terminal proline and plays an important role in recycling proline in various cells and tissues. By using human prolidase cDNA as a probe, a chromosomal gene related to prolidase was isolated from human gene libraries. The human prolidase gene is over 130 kilobases long and is split into 15 exons. All of the splice donor and acceptor sites conform to the GT/AG rule. The transcription initiation site was determined by nuclease S1 mapping and primer extension and was located 131 bases upstream from the initiation codon. A CAAT box-like sequence was present 67 bases upstream from the cap site, but there was no TATA box-like sequence. There were seven sets of sequences resembling the transcription factor Sp1 binding sites. Four were upstream from the cap site, and three were downstream. We also analyzed findings in patients with prolidase deficiency with respect to major gene re-arrangement. Several hundred base deletions, including the 14th exon, were identified. Knowledge of the gene structure of human prolidase will facilitate further studies on the expression and regulation of this gene and provide necessary information for analyses of mutations in patients with this deficiency."
https://openalex.org/W2094949124,"Leukocyte adhesion deficiency (LAD) is an inherited disorder of leukocyte function caused by derangements in CD18 expression. The genetic and functional abnormalities in a lymphocyte cell line from a patient with LAD have been corrected by retrovirus-mediated transduction of a functional CD18 gene. Lymphocytes from patients with LAD were exposed to CD18-expressing retrovirus and enriched for cells that express CD11a and CD18 (LFA-1) on the cell surface. Molecular and functional analyses of these cells revealed (i) one copy of proviral sequence per cell, (ii) viral-directed CD18 RNA that exceeded normal endogenous levels, (iii) normal quantities of CD11a and CD18 protein on the cell surface, and (iv) reconstitution of LFA-1-dependent adhesive function."
https://openalex.org/W1496040669,"The trp repressor of Escherichia coli binds to the operators of three operons concerned with tryptophan biosynthesis and regulates their expression. trp superrepressors can repress expression of the trp operon in vivo at lower tryptophan concentrations than those required by the wild-type repressor. The five known superrepressors have been purified and characterized using a modified filter binding assay. In four of the five superrepressors, EK13, EK18, DN46 and EK49, negatively charged wild-type residues located on the surface of the repressor that faces the operator are replaced by positively charged or neutral residues. Each of these proteins has higher affinity for the trp operator than wild-type repressor. Decreased rates of dissociation of the repressor-operator complex were found to be responsible for the higher affinities. The fifth superrepressor, AV77, has an amino acid substitution in the turn of the helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif. This superrepressor was indistinguishable from wild-type repressor in our filter binding assay. We conclude that rapid dissociation of repressor from operator is important for trp repressor function in vivo. The negatively charged wild-type residues that are replaced in superrepressors are probably responsible for the characteristic rapid dissociation of the trp repressor from the trp operator."
https://openalex.org/W1557863639,"Acetyl-CoA hydrolase, catalyzing the hydrolysis of acetyl-CoA, is presumably involved in regulating the intracellular acetyl-CoA pool. Recently, a yeast acetyl-CoA hydrolase was purified to homogeneity from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and partially characterized (Lee, F.-J. S., Lin, L.-W., and Smith, J. A. (1989) Eur. J. Biochem. 184, 21-28). In order to study the biological function and regulation of the acetyl-CoA hydrolase, we cloned and sequenced the full length cDNA encoding yeast acetyl-CoA hydrolase. RNA blot analysis indicates that acetyl-CoA hydrolase is encoded by a 2.5-kilobase mRNA. DNA blot analyses of genomic and chromosomal DNA reveal that the gene (so-called ACH1, acetyl-CoA hydrolase) is present as a single copy located on chromosome II. Acetyl-CoA hydrolase is established to be a mannose-containing glycoprotein, which binds concanavalin A. By measuring the levels of ACH1 mRNA and acetyl-CoA hydrolase activity in different growth phases and by examining the effects of various carbon sources, we have demonstrated that ACH1 expression is repressed by glucose."
https://openalex.org/W1582640211,"The formation of glutaminyl-tRNA (Gln-tRNA) in Bacilli, chloroplasts, and mitochondria occurs in a two-step reaction. This involves misacylation of tRNA(Gln) with glutamate by glutamyl-tRNA synthetase and subsequent amidation of Glu-tRNA(Gln) to the correctly acylated Gln-tRNA(Gln) by a specific amidotransferase (Schon, A., Kannangara, C. G., Gough, S., and Soll, D. (1988) Nature 331, 187-190). Here we demonstrate the existence of this pathway in green algae and describe the purification of the Glu-tRNA(Gln) amidotransferase from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The purified enzyme showed an Mr of approximately 120,000 when analyzed by glycerol gradient sedimentation and gel filtration. An apparent Mr of 63,000 of the denatured protein was demonstrated by electrophoresis on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. This indicates that the enzyme possesses an alpha 2 structure. The substrate for the purified enzyme is Glu-tRNA(Gln) but not Glu-tRNA(Glu). The enzyme requires ATP, Mg2+, and an amide donor for the conversion. Acceptable amide donors are glutamine, asparagine, and ammonia. Blocking of the glutamine-dependent reaction by alkylation of the protein with 6-diazo-5-oxonorleucine did not inhibit the ammonia-dependent reaction, suggesting that the enzyme has separate glutamine and ammonia binding sites. As suggested by Wilcox (Wilcox, M. (1969) Eur. J. Biochem. 11, 405-412) the amidation reaction may involve glutamyl-phosphate formation, since ATP is cleaved to ADP when the enzyme is incubated with Glu-tRNA(Gln) and ATP. In common with other glutamine amidotransferases, the enzyme also possesses low glutaminase activity. The purified Glu-tRNA(Gln) amidotransferase forms a stable complex with Glu-tRNA(Gln) in the presence of ATP and Mg2+ but in the absence of the amide donor as determined by gradient centrifugation."
https://openalex.org/W1555214742,"The T-lymphocyte transmembrane glycoprotein CD2 plays an important physiological role in facilitating adhesion between T-lymphocytes and their cognate cellular partners. This interaction is mediated by binding of CD2 to the broadly distributed surface polypeptide LFA-3 and augments the recognition function of the CD3-Ti antigen-major histocompatibility complex receptor via stabilization of conjugate formation between cells. To define better the structural components of the CD2 extracellular region which are important in contact-mediated cellular adhesion, a single-domain CD2 immunoadhesion protein has been prepared from papain digestion of a soluble two-domain CD2 molecule. This amino-terminal domain fragment binds to LFA-3 on human B-cells with a dissociation constant of 0.4 microM, possesses functional immunoadhesion epitopes as defined by the binding of monoclonal antibodies raised to native CD2, and retains the ability to inhibit sheep erythrocyte rosette formation with human T-cells. Thus, all of the immunoadhesion functions ascribed to CD2 reside within the amino-terminal domain. Circular dichroism analysis of the isolated CD2 adhesion domain suggests the presence of substantial alpha-helical character (22%), consistent with earlier computer modeling analyses that predicted a pattern of alternating alpha-helices and beta-sheets within the extracellular region of CD2. Despite the existence of short stretches of sequence homology between CD2 and immunoglobulin superfamily members, the circular dichroism data provide supporting biophysical evidence for classification of CD2 in an alpha-beta (either alpha/beta or alpha + beta) protein folding class."
https://openalex.org/W1540200437,"The interaction of Factor XIII with cultured fibroblasts was examined using 125I-labeled protein and immunofluorescence. Platelet or plasma Factor XIII bound to confluent cell layers. Binding reached an apparent steady state after 8 h. Activation with thrombin increased the binding of both the platelet and plasma forms of the enzyme. After a 1-2 h lag, a chloroquine-inhibitable increase in trichloroacetic acid-soluble radioactivity was detected in the medium. Gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate indicated that approximately 16-fold more a subunit (catalytic) of 125I-plasma Factor XIII bound to the cell layer than b subunit (carrier) and that some large complexes containing Factor XIII were formed with the cell layer. Factor XIII binding increased linearly with concentrations of Factor XIII up to 230 micrograms/ml, whereas a component of the degradation of Factor XIII was saturable at about 20 micrograms/ml. Factor XIII associated with cell layers was catalytically active since it could cross-link fibronectin. By immunofluorescence the a subunit of Factor XIII was localized to fibronectin-containing extracellular fibrils and, in the presence of chloroquine, to intracellular granules. These results indicate that the a subunit of Factor XIII binds to the fibroblast extracellular matrix and matrix assembly sites, where it remains active, and to a putative cell-surface receptor which mediates its internalization and degradation."
https://openalex.org/W1485579887,"Frozen rat liver microsomes and rough endoplasmic reticulum were irradiated with high energy electrons. The surviving enzymatic activity of acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase and activity for esterification of 25-hydroxycholesterol decreased as a simple exponential function of radiation exposure, leading to a target size of 170-180 kDa. The loss of acyl-CoA hydrolase activity with a radiation dose was complex and resolved as a 45-kDa enzyme associated with a large inhibitor. It is interpreted that acyl-CoA hydrolase is the acyl-CoA-binding component and the inhibitor is the cholesterol-binding component of acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase."
https://openalex.org/W1527708500,"S49 mouse lymphoma cells contain a beta-adrenergic receptor coupled to Gs that stimulates adenylyl cyclase and a somatostatin receptor coupled to Gi that inhibits adenylyl cyclase. Membranes from these cells were used to compare the inhibitory effects of somatostatin and G protein beta gamma complex to determine under what conditions beta gamma is likely to be a mediator of somatostatin action. Somatostatin was equally effective at inhibiting basal adenylyl cyclase activity in the presence of GTP, forskolin-stimulated activity, and hormone-stimulated activity. G protein beta gamma was more effective at inhibiting basal activity than was somatostatin, and these effects were partially additive. In the presence of forskolin, the two inhibitors were equally effective and not additive. In the presence of isoproterenol, beta gamma was much less effective than somatostatin, and the two inhibitors did not have additive or synergistic effects. At very high concentrations beta gamma did inhibit isoproterenol stimulation of adenylyl cyclase, although its effects were not saturating even at 100 micrograms/ml. Under conditions where beta gamma did inhibit hormone stimulation, beta gamma was a mixed inhibitor of isoproterenol stimulation, proportionally decreasing the maximum effect of the hormone and increasing the half-maximally effective concentration. Somatostatin, on the other hand, was a simple noncompetitive inhibitor of isoproterenol stimulation. These results indicate that beta gamma and somatostatin inhibit adenylyl cyclase by different mechanisms, at least in the presence of hormones that stimulate the enzyme. It is proposed that alpha i is the primary mediator of hormone inhibition of adenylyl cyclase when Gs is activated by a hormone, but that beta gamma may have a role as a mediator of inhibition of basal activity."
https://openalex.org/W1523054244,"The regulatory role of Arg283 in the autoinhibitory domain of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II was investigated using substituted inhibitory synthetic peptides and site-directed mutation of the expressed kinase. In the synthetic peptide corresponding to the autoinhibitory domain (residues 281-309) of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, substitution of Arg283 by other residues increased the IC50 values of the peptides in the following order: Arg much less than Lys much less than Gln much less than Glu. Site-directed mutations of Arg283 to glutamic acid and glutamine in the kinase alpha subunit cDNA were transcribed and translated in vitro. The expressed enzymes had the same total kinase activities, determined in the presence of Ca2+/CaM, but the Glu283 mutant had a slightly higher Ca2(+)-independent kinase activity (5.46 +/- 0.88%) compared to the wild-type Arg283 (1.86 +/- 0.71%) and the Gln283 mutant (2.15 +/- 0.60%). When the expressed kinases were subjected to limited autophosphorylation on ice to monitor generation of the Ca2(+)-independent activity, the Arg283 kinase attained maximal Ca2(+)-independent activity (about 20%) within 30 s, whereas the Gln283 and Glu283 mutants attained maximal Ca2(+)-independence only after about 40 min of autophosphorylation. The results indicate that Arg283 is a very important determinant for the regulatory autophosphorylation of Thr286 that generates the Ca2(+)-independent activity but is not essential for the other multiple autophosphorylations within Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, and that Arg283 is only one of several important residues for the inhibitory potency of the autoinhibitory domain."
https://openalex.org/W1872366187,"The receptors on neuronal membranes for N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), an analog of L-glutamic acid, are the focus of intensive study because of their importance in many neurophysiological and neuropathological states. Since there is very little knowledge of the molecular characteristics of the NMDA receptors, we undertook the development of methods for the solubilization and purification of proteins that form the receptor complex. Optimal conditions for solubilization of NMDA receptors from isolated synaptic plasma membranes involved the use of the zwitterionic detergent 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propane-sulfonate (CHAPS) together with NH4SCN, 10% glycerol, and the nonionic detergent polyoxyethylene 10 tridecyl ether. The presence of NMDA receptors was monitored as the binding activity for the specific NMDA receptor ligand 3-((+-)-2-carboxypiperazine-4-yl)-[1,2-3H]propyl-1-phosphonic acid ([3H]CPP). Approximately 50% of membrane proteins were solubilized, and an equal quantitative recovery of [3H]CPP-binding proteins was achieved. The selectivity of [3H] CPP-binding proteins for excitatory amino acid agonists and aminophosphonocarboxylic acid antagonists remained essentially unchanged following solubilization. The effect of the NMDA receptor modulator, glycine, and of the ion channel-blocking cation Mg2+ on [3H]CPP-binding proteins was drastically altered by solubilization. Both became activators of [3H]CPP-binding sites. The NMDA receptor agonist ibotenic acid was used to develop an affinity matrix for the isolation of the NMDA receptor complex. The [3H]CPP-binding proteins were selectively eluted by the introduction of 2 mM Mg2+ in the elution buffers. This fraction was highly enriched in CPP-binding entities and in a protein of 58-60-kDa molecular size. The CPP binding activity of the proteins in this fraction was enriched by a factor of approximately 20,000 over that of brain homogenate. There was no L-[3H]glutamate binding activity associated with this fraction. Proteins interacting with glutamate, NMDA, and ibotenate were recovered in the 1 M KCl-eluted fraction. We propose that the 58-60-kDa protein is the aminophosphonocarboxylic acid antagonist-binding subunit of the NMDA receptor complex."
https://openalex.org/W1480241482,"The neu proto-oncogene product has been found to exist in two interconvertible forms in G8/DHFR mouse fibroblasts. The 185-kilodalton form (p185) present in growing cells is replaced by a 175-kilodalton form (p175) under conditions of serum starvation. This low molecular weight form accounts almost exclusively for the phosphotyrosine content of the receptor and is associated with increased tyrosine kinase activity. Addition of serum, platelet-derived growth factor or tumor promoter induces conversion of p175 to p185 within minutes, and this increase in molecular weight is associated with phosphorylation of serine and threonine; removal of serum growth factors is followed by replacement of p185 with p175 over several hours. Unlike G8/DHFR cells, the human breast cancer cell line SK-Br-3 expresses a high molecular weight neu/HER2 receptor with unchanged phosphotyrosine content in both serum-starved and serum-stimulated cultures. These findings indicate that activation of the neu proto-oncogene product in G8/DHFR cells may be regulated in part by protein kinase C-mediated receptor transmodulation rather than by ligand availability alone."
https://openalex.org/W1545948206,"The mechanism of glucocorticoid resistance was studied in a rat hepatoma cell variant (6.10.2) which contains low levels of glucocorticoid receptor. These cells seem to have lost glucocorticoid-induced transcriptional responses as measured by the induction of expression of stably integrated mouse mammary tumor virus gene and the endogenous tyrosine aminotransferase gene, as well as the transcriptional suppression of glucocorticoid receptor gene expression. However, characterization of the glucocorticoid resistance in 6.10.2 cells revealed that the receptor is indistinguishable from the wild-type receptor with respect to hormone binding and affinity for both nonspecific and specific DNA sequences. The levels of the receptor mRNA and the total immunoreactive protein found in 6.10.2 cells were about 20% of those found in wild-type cells. Further analysis of 6.10.2 cells demonstrated that the receptor was indeed biologically functional. First, treatment of 6.10.2 cells with 8-bromo-cAMP elevated the endogenous glucocorticoid receptor levels 2-fold and restored responsiveness to glucocorticoids. Second, pretreatment of the cells with cycloheximide also led to acquisition of cellular responsiveness to glucocorticoids. We propose that there exists a level of glucocorticoid receptor which is required for responsiveness and that under normal culture conditions, the level of glucocorticoid receptor in 6.10.2 cells is below this threshold. However, glucocorticoid responsiveness can be restored by raising the glucocorticoid receptor level above the threshold with 8-bromo-cAMP or, alternatively, by removing the threshold barrier with cycloheximide."
https://openalex.org/W1553767783,"Poly(A)+ RNA (mRNA)extracted from rat liver was injected into Xenopus laevis oocytes and the expression of sulfate transport was determined by measuring [35S] sulfate uptake. Compared to water-injected oocytes, which exhibited virtually no sulfate uptake, injection of rat liver mRNA resulted in a time- and dose-dependent increase in uptake of sulfate. Depending on the method used for the isolation of the mRNA, sulfate uptake was stimulated after injection (40 ng after 6 days) between 8- and 72-fold compared to water-injected oocytes. Sulfate uptake of oocytes injected with mRNA was found to be sensitive to 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (IC50 less than 20 microM) and could also be inhibited by thiosulfate. Sulfate uptake of injected oocytes showed Michaelis-Menten kinetics (apparent Km, 0.31 mM) which is similar to the Km of the sulfate/bicarbonate antiporter of rat liver canalicular plasma membranes. After fractionation by a sucrose density gradient, the mRNA encoding for the expressed rat liver sulfate carrier was found in fractions containing messages of 3.5-4.0 kilobases in length."
https://openalex.org/W1600786880,"The interaction of ribonuclease T1 with tetraprotonated spermine (SPM4+), Mg2+, phosphate and other ionic ligands at pH 6.0 was investigated in binding experiments at 25 degrees C and/or by their effects on the midpoint temperature for thermal unfolding of the enzyme. SPM4+ binding with the native protein at 25 degrees C was characterized by an association constant of approximately 2 x 10(4) M-1. This ligand also binds to the unfolded protein but with a approximately 35-fold lower affinity. Phosphate binds at the active site whereas Mg2+ and SPM4+ cations compete for binding at a polyanionic locus that probably involves residues Glu-28, Asp-29, and Glu-31 at the C-terminal end of the alpha-helix. Steady-state kinetic studies using minimal RNA substrates demonstrated that SPM4+ binding with the enzyme does not affect its catalytic activity. SPM4+ also preferentially binds with the folded form of the disulfide-reduced enzyme which has the same or slightly enhanced catalytic properties compared with native ribonuclease T1. The unfolding rate for the native protein in 8 M urea was approximately 8-fold lower in the presence of 0.05 M SPM4+. SPM4+ appears to increase the amplitude of an unobserved fast phase(s) for refolding of the native enzyme. A single kinetic phase characterized refolding of the reduced enzyme which was slightly faster than the slowest refolding phase for the native form."
