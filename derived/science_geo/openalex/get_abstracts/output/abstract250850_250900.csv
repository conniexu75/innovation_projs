In myeloid cells IFNα/β activates signal transducers and activators of transcription STAT1, STAT2, and STAT3. STAT1 and STAT2 mediate the antiviral and inflammatory effects of IFNα/β, but the function of IFNα/β-activated STAT3 is not known. We investigated the role of STAT3 in type I IFN signaling in myeloid cells by modulating STAT3 expression and the intensity of STAT3 activation using overexpression and RNA interference and determining the effects on downstream signaling and gene expression. IFNα-activated STAT3 inhibited STAT1-dependent gene activation, thereby down-regulating IFNα-mediated induction of inflammatory mediators such as the chemokines CXCL9 (Mig) and CXCL10 (IP-10). At the same time, IFNα-activated STAT3 supported ISGF-3-dependent induction of antiviral genes. STAT3 did not suppress STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation or nuclear translocation but instead sequestered STAT1 and suppressed the formation of DNA-binding STAT1 homodimers. These results identify a regulatory function for STAT3 in attenuating the inflammatory properties of type I IFNs and provide a mechanism of suppression of STAT1 function that differs from previously described suppression of tyrosine phosphorylation. The results suggest that changes in the relative expression and activation of STAT1 and STAT3 that occur during immune responses determine the nature of cellular responses to type I IFNs."
https://openalex.org/W2127302126,"Regulation of cell volume in response to changes in osmolarity is critical for cell function and survival. However, the molecular basis of osmosensation and regulation of cell volume are not clearly understood. We have examined the mechanism of regulatory volume decrease (RVD) in salivary gland cells and report a novel association between osmosensing TRPV4 (transient receptor potential vanalloid 4) and AQP5 (aquaporin 5), which is required for regulating water permeability and cell volume. Exposure of salivary gland cells and acini to hypotonicity elicited an increase in cell volume and activation of RVD. Hypotonicity also activated Ca2+ entry, which was required for subsequent RVD. Ca2+ entry was associated with a distinct nonselective cation current that was activated by 4αPDD and inhibited by ruthenium red, suggesting involvement of TRPV4. Consistent with this, endogenous TRPV4 was detected in cells and in the apical region of acini along AQP5. Importantly, acinar cells from mice lacking either TRPV4 or AQP5 displayed greatly reduced Ca2+ entry and loss of RVD in response to hypotonicity, although the extent of cell swelling was similar. Expression of N terminus-deleted AQP5 suppressed TRPV4 activation and RVD but not cell swelling. Furthermore, hypotonicity increased the association and surface expression of AQP5 and TRPV4. Both these effects and RVD were reduced by actin depolymerization. These data demonstrate that (i) activation of TRPV4 by hypotonicity depends on AQP5, not on cell swelling per se, and (ii) TRPV4 and AQP5 concertedly control regulatory volume decrease. These data suggest a potentially important role for TRPV4 in salivary gland function. Regulation of cell volume in response to changes in osmolarity is critical for cell function and survival.

These data suggest a potentially important role for TRPV4 in salivary gland function. The ability of cells to regulate their volume is essential for maintenance of cellular homeostasis under anisotonic environmental conditions (1Okada Y. Maeno E. Biochem. Physiol. A Mol. Integr.

Changes in osmolarity of the extracellular medium induce water fluxes that result in swelling or shrinkage of cells, depending on the osmotic gradient. Most cells respond to changes in tonicity and cell volume by initiating mechanisms that allow them to recover their original volume in the continued presence of the osmotic stress. Such regulatory volume changes depend on the activation of cation and anion permeabilties that reverse the osmotic gradient and direction of water flow (1Okada Y. Maeno E. Biochem. Physiol. A Mol. Integr. Physiol. 2001; 130: 377-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 2Jakab M. Fuerst J. Gschwentner M. Bottà G. Garavaglia M.L. Bazzini C. Rodighiero S. Meyer G. Eichmueller S.

Emerging studies demonstrate that regulatory volume changes are critical for cell survival and also for regulation of cellular processes such as gene transcription and proliferation (1Okada Y. Maeno E. Biochem. Physiol. A Mol. Integr. Physiol. 2001; 130: 377-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In addition, a variety of cells, such as exocrine gland cells, utilize the mechanism of regulatory volume change to drive fluid secretion (5Melvin J.E. Yule D. Shuttleworth T. Begenisich T. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2005; 67: 445-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Several monovalent cation and anion channels as well as intracellular Ca2+ changes contribute to cell volume regulation. For example, hypo-osmolarity-induced cell swelling has been associated with a rise in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in different cell types, which is due to hypotonicity-activated Ca2+ entry pathways. It has also been clearly demonstrated that this Ca2+ entry is critical for regulating the ion fluxes that drive volume decrease (1Okada Y. Maeno E. Biochem. Physiol. A Mol. Integr. Physiol. 2001; 130: 377-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 2Jakab M. Fuerst J. Gschwentner M. Bottà G. Garavaglia M.L. Bazzini C. Rodighiero S. Meyer G. Eichmueller S. Woell E.S.

However, the underlying mechanism(s) that senses the change in osmolarity and/or cell volume to initiate volume regulation is poorly understood (5Melvin J.E. Yule D. Shuttleworth T. Begenisich T. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2005; 67: 445-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar).Regulation of transepithelial osmotic forces as well as cell volume critically impacts salivary gland fluid secretion induced by neurotransmitter stimulation of the gland (5Melvin J.E. Yule D. Shuttleworth T. Begenisich T. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2005; 67: 445-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). The water channel, AQP5 (aquaporin 5) provides a regulated water permeability across the apical membrane of salivary gland acinar cells that is important not only for fluid secretion but also for regulatory volume changes (5Melvin J.E. Yule D. Shuttleworth T. Begenisich T. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2005; 67: 445-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 6King L.S. Kozono D. Agre P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 2001; 276: 23413-23420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Aqp5–/– mouse salivary glands show decreased salivary secretion in response to muscarinic receptor stimulation. Additionally, dispersed salivary gland acini from these mice have reduced ability to control volume changes in response to hyper- or hyposmotic solutions (7Krane C.M. Melvin J.E. Nguyen H.V. Richardson L. Towne J.E. Doetschman T. Menon A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23413-23420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Thus, fluid secretion and cell volume regulation converge at the level of AQP5, which mediates the final step in both processes (i.e. water efflux). However, it is not clear how cells sense the change in osmolarity and how this signal is transduced to achieve volume regulation.As discussed above, hypotonic and hypertonic conditions induce [Ca2+]i increases in different cell types, and Ca2+ entry has been reported to be critical for the volume recovery process (1Okada Y. Maeno E. Biochem. Physiol. A Mol. Integr. Physiol. 2001; 130: 377-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 2Jakab M. Fuerst J. Gschwentner M. Bottà G. Garavaglia M.L. Bazzini C. Rodighiero S.

Neurotransmitter-stimulated Ca2+ mobilization events, including intracellular Ca2+ release and Ca2+ entry as well as Ca2+-dependent activation of cation and anion channels, have been quite extensively studied in salivary and other exocrine gland cells (5Melvin J.E. Yule D. Shuttleworth T. Begenisich T. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2005; 67: 445-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 8Ambudkar I.S. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 2000; 11: 4-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Further, increases in cytosolic Ca2+ due to Ca2+ entry have been correlated with ion channel activation and fluid secretion. However, the Ca2+ entry mechanism(s) involved in the cellular response to anisosmotic conditions has not yet been identified (5Melvin J.E. Yule D. Shuttleworth T. Begenisich T. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2005; 67: 445-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). TRPV4 (transient receptor potential vanilloid 4), a member of the TRP superfamily of cation channels (9Montell C. Sci. STKE 2005. 2005; : RE3Google Scholar) has been shown to be activated by hypotonicity and a variety of other stimuli (10Liedtke W.

This channel is expressed in several cell types and has been reported to be involved in RVD 2The abbreviations used are: RVD, regulatory volume decrease; HTS, hypotonic solution; NMDG, N-methyl-d-glucamine, 4αPDD, 4α-phorbol-12,13-didecanoate; IP, immunoprecipitation; cyt-D, cytochalasin D; RuR, ruthenium red.2The abbreviations used are: RVD, regulatory volume decrease; HTS, hypotonic solution; NMDG, N-methyl-d-glucamine, 4αPDD, 4α-phorbol-12,13-didecanoate; IP, immunoprecipitation; cyt-D, cytochalasin D; RuR, ruthenium red. in airway epithelial and keratinocyte cell lines (16Arniges M.

The molecular mechanism by which tonicity changes regulate TRPV4 has also not yet been established (11Liedtke W. J. Physiol. 2005; 567: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 12Nilius B.

A. 2003; 100: 13698-13703Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar).This study was directed toward defining the molecular basis of RVD. Toward this end, we have measured the response of salivary gland cell lines, primary cultures, and dispersed salivary gland acini to hypotonicity. These cells have been previously shown to display robust volume changes as well as efficient volume recovery in response to anisosmotic conditions (5Melvin J.E. Yule D. Shuttleworth T. Begenisich T. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2005; 67: 445-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 7Krane C.M. Melvin J.E. Nguyen H.V. Richardson L. Towne J.E. Doetschman T. Menon A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23413-23420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The exact molecular events involved in these responses are not yet known. The data presented here demonstrate a novel association between TRPV4 and AQP5, which controls RVD in salivary gland cells. We show that AQP5 is required for the activation of TRPV4 by hypotonicity. Further, AQP5 and TRPV4 are concertedly involved in regulating recovery of cell volume.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Transfection—Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (rat basophilic leukemia cells; RBL-2H3), Earle's minimal essential medium (human submandibular gland (HSG) and human parotid gland (HSY) cells) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2. HSG cells were transiently transfected with 1 μg of required plasmids and 0.2 μg of green fluorescent protein-encoding plasmid or only with green fluorescent protein plasmid using Lipofectamine reagent 2000 (Invitrogen).Dispersed Cell Preparation from Mouse Parotid and Submandibular Gland Cells—All mice were maintained according to guidelines approved by the NIDCR, National Institutes of Health, Animal Care and Use Committee. Submandibular glands were removed, cleaned, minced, and digested in standard external solution containing 145 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm Hepes, 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4 (NaOH), with 0.02% soybean trypsin inhibitor and 0.1% bovine serum albumin containing collagenase P (2.5 mg/8 ml) (7Krane C.M.

After a 15–20-min incubation at 37 °C, the digest was washed twice with the normal external solution and resuspended in external solution.Electrophysiological Recording—The patch pipette had resistances between 3 and 5 megaohms after filling with the standard intracellular solution that contained 145 mm cesium methane-sulfonate, 8 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm EGTA, pH 7.2 (CsOH). External solutions were composed as follows: 145 mm NaCl, 5 mm CsCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4 (NaOH) (Ca2+ and Na+ solution); 170 mm NMDG, 5 mm CsCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4 (HCl) (NMDG solution). Osmolarity for all solutions was adjusted with d-mannitol to 305 ± 5 mmol/kg using a vapor pressure osmometer (Wescor). For measuring swelling-activated currents, an isotonic solution containing 75 mm NaCl, 6 mm CsCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Hepes, 150 mmd-mannitol, and 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4, with NaOH (305 ± 5 mmol/kg) was used. Cell swelling was induced by omitting mannitol from this solution to reach proper osmolarity. In some experiments, the reduction of osmolarity was achieved by reduction of NaCl from normal external solution where indicated.Patch clamp experiments were performed in the tight seal whole-cell configuration at room temperature (22–25 °C) using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments) as described earlier (19Liu X. Groschner K. Ambudkar I.S. J. Membr. Biol. 2004; 200: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 20Liu X. Singh B.B. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 2005; 280: 21600-21606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Voltage ramps ranging from –90 to 90 mV over a period of 1 s were imposed every 4 s from a holding potential of 0 mV and digitized at a rate of 1 kHz. A liquid-junction potential of less than 8 mV was not corrected, and capacitative currents and series resistance were determined and minimized. For analysis, the first ramp was used for leak subtraction for the subsequent current records. There was no significant increase in the current under these conditions unless cells were exposed to hypotonic external solution (HTS).Measurement of Intracellular Ca2+ Concentration—Freshly isolated salivary gland cells were loaded with fura-2 for 45–60 min at 30 °C and allowed to attach to a glass bottom dish (Matek Corp.). Ducts and acinar cells were morphologically identified (7Krane C.M. Melvin J.E. Nguyen H.V. Richardson L. Towne J.E. Doetschman T. Menon A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23413-23420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Other cells were cultured overnight in Matek dishes. Fluorescence measurements were made using a Till Photonics-Polychrome IV spectrofluorimeter attached to a Olympus X51 microscope and Metafluor imaging system (Universal Imaging Corp.) (21Liu X. Bandyopadhyay B.C. Singh B.B. Groschner K. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21600-21606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Fluorescence traces shown represent [Ca2+]i (values are averages from >50 cells and representative of results obtained in at least 3–5 individual experiments).Measurement of Cell Volume—Cells were loaded with the fluoroprobe calcein (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) and excited at 490 nm. Emitted fluorescence was measured at 510 nm. In situ calibration of the dye was performed. The relationship between dye fluorescence and the volume change was linear over a volume range from +35 to –35%. In some experiments, cell volume was estimated using an Olympus X51 microscope interfaced with Universal Imaging MetaMorph software. Data are presented as mean ± S.E. Origin 7.5 (OriginLab, Northampton, MA) was used for data analysis and display. Significant difference between individual groups was tested by using analysis of variance.Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Immunoprecipitation was done using solubilized crude membranes or from cell lysates as previously described (21Liu X. Bandyopadhyay B.C. Singh B.B. Groschner K. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21600-21606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Precleared lysates were incubated with the required antibody (1:200 dilution of anti-TRPV4 or anti-AQP5). Interacting proteins bound to Sepharose beads were separated, released with SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and detected by Western blotting as described previously using anti-TRPV4 (1:500 dilution) or anti-AQP5 antibody (1:1000 dilution).Immunocytochemistry—Parotid glands were excised from the animals and fixed in 10% formalin solution, embedded in paraffin, and used to prepare 5–10-μm sections (American Histolabs, Gaithersburg, MD). Sections were dewaxed, rehydrated, and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton in PBS, pH 7.5. Streptavidin-peroxidase reactions using the DAB Histostain kit (Zymed Laboratories, San Francisco, CA) were used to detect specific proteins (anti-TRPV4 at 1:70 and anti-AQP5 at 1:100 dilutions). In control sections, rabbit IgG was used instead of primary antibody.Surface Biotinylation—Cells were treated as required and incubated with 0.5 mg/ml Sulfo-NHS-Biotin (Pierce) on ice (21Liu X. Bandyopadhyay B.C. Singh B.B. Groschner K. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21600-21606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), washed with buffer containing 0.1 m glycine, and solubilized with 2 ml of cell lysis buffer containing Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, and proteolytic inhibitors. Biotinylated proteins were pulled down with Neutr-Avidin-linked beads (Pierce). The bound fraction was washed and released with SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed by Western blotting.RESULTSHypotonicity Stimulates Changes in Cell Volume and Ca2+ Entry via a TRPV4-like Channel in Salivary Gland Cells—Fig. 1A shows that HTS induced a sustained increase in [Ca2+]i in HSG (human submandibular gland cell line) cells, which was dependent on the osmolarity. Average data representing peak increase in fluorescence from these experiments are shown in Fig. 1B (significant increases above resting [Ca2+]i are indicated). Primary cultures of human submandibular gland cells (22Tran S.D. Wang J. Bandyopadhyay B.C. Redman R.S. Dutra A. Pak E. Swaim W.D. Gerstenhaber J.A. Bryant J.M. Zheng C. Goldsmith C.M. Kok M.R. Wellner R.B. Baum B.J. Tissue Eng. 2005; 11: 172-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) but not rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells displayed a similar response to HTS (Fig. 1C; 150 mmol/kg solution was used here and in subsequent experiments). The sustained [Ca2+]i increase in HSG cells was blocked by 100 μm but not 1 μm Gd3+ (Fig. 1D), indicating that HTS-stimulated Ca2+ entry is unlike store-operated Ca2+ entry, which is blocked by 1 μm Gd3+ in these cells (19Liu X. Groschner K. Ambudkar I.S. J. Membr. Biol. 2004; 200: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This was further confirmed by whole cell current recordings. HTS increased HSG cell membrane conductance with a 25–40 s delay (Fig. 1E) and generated a weakly outwardly rectifying current that reversed at +6 ± 3 mV (Fig. 1F; HTS-stimulated [Ca2+]i increase, and cation currents were seen in 91% (20 of 22) of cells). With NMDG as the cation in the external solution (Fig. 1, G and H), inward current was greatly reduced, outward current remained relatively unchanged, and reversal potential showed a left shift (this effect was seen in all of the cells that displayed a response to HTS). Together, these data demonstrate that HTS stimulates a nonselective Ca2+-permeable cation conductance that is distinct from the relatively inwardly rectifying store-operated Ca2+ current ISOC previously described in HSG cells (19Liu X. Groschner K. Ambudkar I.S. J. Membr. Biol. 2004; 200: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 20Liu X. Singh B.B. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11337-11343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). However, the characteristics of the HTS-stimulated cation current in HSG cells are similar to those of HTS-activated TRPV4 currents in other cell types (14Vriens J. Watanabe H. Janssens A.

Although the current decayed relatively fast under the control conditions (see Fig. 1E), the decay was faster when RuR was added to cells after the current developed (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, washout of RuR induced a significant (p < 0.05) recovery (41 ± 6%, n = 4) of the current to a value not significantly different from the current in control cells. This inhibitory effect of RuR can be more clearly seen in the I-V curves shown in Fig. 2B (inhibition of inward (>90%) and outward (50–60%) currents, p < 0.05, n = 4). Although the outward current in RuR-treated cells was also decreased compared with that in the untreated cells, at membrane potentials >+70 mV, there was a relative increase in the current (Fig. 2B). Thus, the outward current appears to be less sensitive to RuR. There was larger current at the positive membrane potentials relative to that at more negative potentials, consistent with the RuR block being voltage-dependent (23Chung M.-K. Lee H. Caterina M. J.

Hepatotoxins, therefore, act by an unknown mechanism to convert the cellular outcome emanating from TNF stimulation from one of proliferation to one of cell death. The sequential steps of the TNF-induced death receptor pathway have been well characterized. Binding of TNF to TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) results in receptor trimerization and the recruitment of a series of intracellular proteins (14Wajant H. Pfizenmaier K. Scheurich P.

The inherent resistance of hepatocytes to TNF-induced cytotoxicity results from up-regulation of a protective factor(s). This conclusion is based on findings that inhibition of RNA or protein synthesis sensitizes hepatocytes to death from TNF (10Leist M. Gantner F. Bohlinger I. Germann P.G. Tiegs G. Wendel A. J.

Their respective gene products, JNK1 and JNK2, both consist of two alternative splicing forms, p54 and p46 JNK (25Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3646) Google Scholar). The p54 JNK isoform is predominantly expressed by jnk2, and p46 JNK is primarily a jnk1 product (26Dong C. Yang D.D. Wysk M. Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Flavell R.A.

Recent studies, however, have demonstrated that the products of jnk1 and jnk2 may have distinct functions (29Conze D. Krahl T. Kennedy N. Weiss L. Lumsden J. Hess P. Flavell R.A. Le Gros G.

One possible reason for the two gene products to have differential functions is the in vitro finding that JNK1 accounts for classical JNK activity as measured by c-Jun phosphorylation, whereas JNK2 lacks this kinase activity and may even act to decrease overall JNK activity (33Liu J. Minemoto Y. Lin A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 10844-10856Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 34Sabapathy K. Hochedlinger K. Nam S.Y. Bauer A. Karin M. Wagner E.F. Mol.

Whether JNK1 and JNK2 perform differential functions in TNF-mediated cell death is uncertain, with prior in vitro studies in mouse embryonic fibroblasts demonstrating the promotion of cell death specifically by JNK1 or JNK2 (33Liu J.

An established mouse model of TNF-dependent liver injury was utilized to investigate JNK function in the TNF death pathway in vivo. It was hypothesized that similar to the effect of in vitro NF-κB inhibition, hepatotoxins sensitize the liver to injury from TNF by inducing over-activation of JNK. This hypothesis was tested in the murine model of TNF-dependent hepatotoxicity resulting from the combined administration of galactosamine (GalN) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (36Leist M. Gantner F. Bohlinger I. Tiegs G. Germann P.G. Wendel A. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 146: 1220-1234PubMed Google Scholar, 37Nowak M. Gaines G.C. Rosenberg J. Minter R. Bahjat F.R. Rectenwald J. MacKay S.L. Edwards III, C.K. Moldawer L.L. Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. 2000; 278: 1202-1209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The toxin GalN converted the transient induction of JNK signaling by LPS into a sustained activation. JNK activation promoted hepatocellular injury as jnk2 null mice had significantly reduced liver damage and lethality from GalN/LPS. The effect was specific for jnk2 and involved the requirement of JNK2 for caspase-8 activation, Bid cleavage, and induction of the mitochondrial death pathway. These effects were unrelated to changes in classic c-Jun kinase activity, indicating a novel effect of JNK2 in the promotion of the TNF apoptotic death pathway in vivo.

Six-week-old mice were given intraperitoneal injections of 100 μg/kg of LPS (Escherichia coli 0111:B4; Sigma) alone or together with 700 mg/kg of d-galactosamine (Sigma) dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline. Alternatively, mice were pretreated with GalN for 1 h and then administered 20 μg/kg of mouse recombinant TNF (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) intraperitoneally. At various intervals after injection, serum was obtained by retro-orbital bleed, and the mice were sacrificed for the removal of liver tissue. All studies were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine and followed the National Institutes of Health guidelines for animal care. Protein Isolation and Western Blotting—For total protein isolation, portions of liver were sonicated in homogenization buffer containing 1 mm sodium bicarbonate, 0.5 mm calcium chloride, and protease and phosphatase inhibitors as previously described (38Schattenberg J.M. Wang Y. Rigoli R.M. Koop D.R. Czaja M.J. Hepatology. 2004; 39: 444-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Western blotting was performed by denaturing 50 μg of protein at 100 °C for 5 min in Laemmli sample buffer containing 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 25% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue, and 5% β-mercaptoethanol.

Membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 500 mm sodium chloride, and 0.5% Tween 20 (TBS-T) for 1 h. Membranes were incubated for 18 h at 4 °C with the following primary antibodies at 1:1000 to 1:2000 dilutions in 5% bovine serum albumin or nonfat milk: rabbit anti-JNK, rabbit anti-poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), mouse anti-Bax, rabbit anti-Bcl-XL, rabbit anti-cIAP1, rabbit anti-cIAP2, rabbit anti-TNFR1, rabbit anti-TRAF2, and rabbit anti-c-FLIP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), rabbit anti-phospho-JNK, rabbit anti-caspase-3, rabbit anti-caspase-7, rabbit anti-Bad, and mouse anti-phospho-Bad (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), rat anti-caspase-8 (Axxora Life Sciences, San Diego, CA), rabbit anti-Bim (EMD Biosciences, San Diego, CA), and rabbit anti-Bid (kind gift of Xiao-Ming Yin, University of Pittsburgh, PA). Membranes were exposed to goat anti-rabbit, anti-mouse (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD) or anti-rat (SouthernBiotech, Birmingham, AL) secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase at a dilution of 1:10,000 in 5% nonfat milk in TBS-T for 1 h at room temperature. Signals were detected with a chemiluminescence detection system (Western Lightning Chemiluminescence Plus, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and exposure to x-ray film. To ensure that equivalent amounts of protein were loaded among samples, membranes were stripped and immunoblotted with a mouse antibody for β-actin (Abcam, Cambridge, MA). Mitochondrial and cytosolic protein fractions were obtained by homogenization of liver tissue in buffer A (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) with a Dounce homogenizer and centrifugation of the homogenate at 4 °C for 10 min at 600 × g. The resultant supernatant was centrifuged a second time under the same conditions. This supernatant was centrifuged at 4 °C for 15 min at 10,000 × g. The pellet was redissolved in buffer A and formed the mitochondrial fraction. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min at 10,000 × g. This last supernatant comprised the cytosolic protein fraction. Western blotting was performed as above with mouse anti-cytochrome c (Pharmingen), and mouse anti-cytochrome oxidase (MitoSciences, Eugene, OR) antibodies in addition to the antibodies described above. JNK Activity Assay—JNK activity was measured in portions of liver tissue using a JNK in vitro kinase activity assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Cell Signaling). JNK was immunoprecipitated from 200 μg of total protein with a c-Jun fusion protein. After washing, kinase reactions were performed in the presence of 10 mm ATP using c-Jun as substrate. Samples were resolved in 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and immunoblotting was performed as previously described. The relative amounts of the phosphorylated c-Jun fusion protein were detected with a phospho-c-Jun antibody. To control for the loading of equivalent amounts of protein among samples, membranes were stripped and immunoblotted with an antibody for total c-Jun (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) Assay—Serum ALT was measured by commercial kit (TECO Diagnostics, Anaheim, CA). Histological Analysis—Liver specimens were fixed in 10% neutral formalin, and 6-μm sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Tissue sections were examined in a blinded fashion by a single pathologist and graded for the degree of liver injury and inflammation. The approximate percentage of hepatic parenchyma involved by apoptosis/necrosis or inflammation was semiquantitatively graded on a sliding scale of 0 (absent), 0.5 (minimal), 1 (mild), 1.5 (mild to moderate), 2 (moderate), 2.5 (moderate to marked), and 3 (marked). Terminal Deoxynucleotide Transferase-mediated Deoxyuridine Triphosphate Nick End-labeling (TUNEL) Assay—TUNEL-positive cells in liver sections were detected with a commercial kit (Promega, Madison, WI). Tissue sections were deparaffinized in xylene and gradually rehydrated in decreasing concentrations of ethanol, and the TUNEL assay was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Under light microscopy, the numbers of TUNEL-positive cells in 10 randomly selected high power fields (400× magnification) were counted per liver section. TNF Levels—Serum TNF levels were measured by ELISA using a commercial kit (BD Biosciences). Real-time Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—Hepatic total RNA was isolated by cesium chloride gradient centrifugation, as previously described (39Liu H. Lo C.R. Jones B.E. Pradhan Z. Srinivasan A. Valentino K.L. Stockert R.J. Czaja M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40155-40162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Real-time RT-PCR for TNF, interferon γ, interleukin-6, and β-actin was performed with Qiagen QuantiProbes and primers (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) in an ABI PRISM 7000 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). One-step RT-PCR was carried out in triplicate with 250 ng of total RNA using the QuantiTect Probe™ RT-PCR kit (Qiagen). The cycling parameters were reverse transcription at 50 °C for 30 min, HotStar Taq DNA polymerase (Qiagen) activation at 95 °C for 15 min, extension at 76 °C for 30 s, denaturation at 94 °C for 15 s, and annealing/detection at 56 °C for 30 s (for 45 cycles). Data analysis was performed using the 2–ΔΔCT method for relative quantification (40Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (124899) Google Scholar). All samples were normalized initially to β-actin, which served as an endogenous control, and then to a control sample. Caspase-8 Activity—Total liver lysates were prepared as previously described by Zender et al. (41Zender L. Hutker S. Liedtke C. Tillmann H.L. Zender S. Mundt B. Waltemathe M. Gosling T. Flemming P. Malek N.P. Trautwein C. Manns M.P. Kuhnel F. Kubicka S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7797-7802Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Briefly, liver tissue was homogenized in buffer containing 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% CHAPS, 0.5 mm Pefabloc (Roche Applied Science), 0.1 mg/ml leupeptin, and 0.1 mg/ml pepstatin. The homogenates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and 50 μg of protein from the supernatant were assayed for caspase-8 activity. Activity was measured with the BD ApoAlert™ caspase-8 colorimetric assay kit (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Statistical Analysis—All numerical results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. and represent data from a minimum of three independent experiments. Calculations were made with Sigma Plot 2000 (SPSS Science, Chicago, IL). GalN/LPS-induced Liver Injury Is Associated with Prolonged JNK Activation—The GalN/LPS model of toxin-induced liver injury was examined for the effect of the hepatotoxin GalN on JNK activation. GalN/LPS induces liver injury that is primarily apoptotic and mediated by the effects of secreted TNF on TNFR1 (36Leist M. Gantner F. Bohlinger I. Tiegs G. Germann P.G. Wendel A. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 146: 1220-1234PubMed Google Scholar, 37Nowak M. Gaines G.C. Rosenberg J. Minter R. Bahjat F.R. Rectenwald J. MacKay S.L. Edwards III, C.K. Moldawer L.L. Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. 2000; 278: 1202-1209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An advantage of this model is that insight into the mechanism by which the toxin GalN sensitizes to liver injury from TNF can be obtained by contrasting cell signals induced by the nontoxic dose of LPS to those that occur with the hepatotoxic GalN/LPS combination. Hepatic JNK activation induced by LPS alone or the combination of GalN and LPS was compared by Western blot analysis of levels of active, phosphorylated p54 and p46 JNK. LPS alone induced a transient increase in phosphorylated p54 and p46 JNK within 1 h, but levels returned to base line within 2 h of LPS administration (Fig. 1A). In contrast, levels of phosphorylated JNK remained markedly elevated in GalN/LPS-treated mice even at 6 h (Fig. 1A). Levels of total JNK were unchanged with either treatment (Fig. 1A). JNK over-activation preceded the onset of significant hepatocyte apoptosis that occurred at 6 h as indicated by decreased procaspase levels and appearance of the cleaved forms for the effector caspases-3 and -7 at this time point (Fig. 1A). As additional confirmation of the effect of GalN on JNK activation, hepatic JNK activity was assayed by an in vitro kinase assay employing c-Jun as substrate. Identical to the Western blot findings, the transient 1-h increase in JNK activity induced by LPS was converted into sustained JNK activation by GalN co-administration (Fig. 1B). TNF-dependent, GalN-induced liver injury is, therefore, associated with prolonged activation of the JNK signaling pathway similar to the JNK over-activation that occurs in cultured hepatocytes sensitized to TNF toxicity by NF-κB inhibition. Ablation of jnk1 Does Not Reduce Liver Injury from GalN/LPS—To assess whether JNK activation has a functional role in GalN/LPS liver injury, the effect of jnk1 ablation on liver injury was examined. JNK1 was examined because in vitro studies in nonhepatic cells have suggested that only the JNK1 and not the JNK2 isoforms are important in mediating JNK kinase activity (33Liu J. Minemoto Y. Lin A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 10844-10856Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 34Sabapathy K. Hochedlinger K. Nam S.Y. Bauer A. Karin M. Wagner E.F. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 713-725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Additionally, in cultured hepatocytes, JNK1 but not JNK2 was shown to mediate hepatocyte injury from bile acids (32Qiao L. Han S.I. Fang Y. Park J.S. Gupta S. Gilfor D. Amorino G. Valerie K. Sealy L. Engelhardt J.F. Grant S. Hylemon P.B. Dent P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3052-3066Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). To determine the function of JNK1, the degree of liver injury was examined in wild-type C57BL/6 and jnk1–/– mice after GalN/LPS administration. Consistent with findings in other organs in jnk1–/– mice (26Dong C. Yang D.D. Wysk M. Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Flavell R.A. Science. 1998; 282: 2092-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar), the absence of jnk1 expression markedly decreased hepatic levels of p46 JNK, whereas p54 JNK was minimally affected (Fig. 2A). After GalN/LPS treatment, levels of both p54 and p46 phospho-JNK increased significantly in jnk1 null mice, but the levels of both isoforms were decreased relative to those in wild-type mouse livers (Fig. 2A). The effect of jnk1 ablation on liver injury from GalN/LPS was assessed by ALT levels, liver histology, and TUNEL staining. Serum levels of ALT, a marker of hepatocellular injury, were equivalent in wild-type and jnk1–/– mice after GalN/LPS administration with mild elevations at the 4-h onset of injury and marked increases at the 6-h peak of liver injury (Fig. 2B). Histological evidence of significant liver injury was present in both types of mice at 6 h and included hepatocyte apoptosis, inflammation, and vascular congestion (Fig. 3, A and B). Blinded grading of the liver histology confirmed an equivalent degree of apoptosis and inflammation in both groups of mice (Fig. 2C). As a final measure of liver injury, the numbers of apoptotic cells were identified by TUNEL staining. Equivalent numbers of TUNEL-positive cells were present in wild-type and jnk1–/– mice at 4 and 6 h (Figs. 2D and 3, panels d and e). Thus,"

In mammalian cells LDs contain a class of proteins in their surface layers that share a homologous sequence called the PAT domain, including perilipin, adipose differentiation-related protein (ADRP), a tail-interacting protein of 47 kDa (TIP47), and S3-12, which are distributed tissue- or cell type-selectively. Expression in some cases is regulated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). In this study we identified a new PAT family member named MLDP (myocardial LD protein) in a murine cDNA data base and showed the mRNA and protein to be highly enriched in the heart and also expressed at lower levels in the liver and adrenals. Upon subcellular fractionation, a substantial amount of MLDP was detected in the top fraction enriched with LDs. Furthermore, overexpressed MLDP tagged with green fluorescent protein accumulated at the surfaces of LDs and co-localized with perilipin and ADRP. Deletion analysis demonstrated the N-terminal region containing a PAT-1 domain and the following 33-mer domain to be required for targeting of MLDP to LDs. MLDP was found to be up-regulated at both mRNA and protein levels in the heart and liver by a selective ligand for PPARα, Wy14,643, but not in PPARα knock-out mice. MLDP expression was also increased upon fasting in parallel with ADRP. These results indicate that MLDP is a bona fide new PAT family member localized in LDs. Its expression depends on the physiological conditions and the action of PPARα.

They are involved in multiple intracellular processes including lipid metabolism, vesicle traffic, and cell signaling through interactions with other organelles so that important roles in lipid homeostasis are likely (3Murphy D.J. Prog. Lipid Res. 2001; 40: 325-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar, 4Brown D.A. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 446-449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 5Liu P.

Although LDs exist in most, or perhaps all types of cells, their sizes and characteristic features considerably differ among tissues. For example, mature adipocytes, typical lipid-storing cells, contain massive LDs that occupy nearly the entire cell volume. Hepatocytes and macrophages have LDs that are highly inducible by the environmental burden. Steroidogenic cells also have numerous small LDs containing cholesterol esters used for steroid hormone synthesis. In contrast, cardiac and skeletal muscle cells with very high rates of lipolytic turnover normally contain minute LDs, which enlarge in response to disease or diet (3Murphy D.J. Prog. Lipid Res. 2001; 40: 325-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). A question thus arises; what is the major determinant of diverse features of LDs among tissues? It is to be expected that protein components associated with their surfaces would contribute to the specific functions of LDs. Indeed, recent progress of proteomics and microscopic analysis have clarified that there are many proteins on the surfaces of LDs (5Liu P. Ying Y. Zhao Y. Mundy D.I. Zhu M. Anderson R.G. J. Biol.

Lipid Res. 2005; 46: 1331-1338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), and the protein composition varies with the cell type and the physiological condition. Particularly, mammalian LDs contain a specific set of proteins called the PAT domain family that include perilipin, adipose differentiation-related protein (ADRP, also called adipophilin), a tail-interacting protein of 47 kDa (TIP47), and S3-12, sharing regions of conserved sequences, named PAT domains, mainly at their N termini (14Miura S.

Perilipin is a phosphoprotein involved in the hormone-stimulated lipolysis whose expression is highly restricted to adipocytes and steroidogenic cells (15Greenberg A.S. Egan J.J. Wek S.A.

In adipocytes, perilipin protects the LDs from lipases under basal conditions. In response to hormonal stimulation, perilipin is multiphosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase A and recruits hormone-sensitive lipase and other lipases to the LDs, thereby promoting lipolysis (17Sztalryd C.

S3-12 exhibits a similar tissue distribution but is localized in a separate pool of LDs lacking perilipin, possibly participating in the early events of LD formation in adipocytes (19Wolins N.E.

Because its expression level is highly dependent on the total fat cell mass, ADRP serves as a marker for lipid storage and disease states of fat-accumulating cells (25Heid H.W. Moll R. Schwetlick I. Rackwitz H.R. Keenan T.W. Cell Tissue Res. 1998; 294: 309-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 26Buechler C. Ritter M. Duong C.Q. Orso E. Kapinsky M. Schmitz G. Biochim. Biophys.

TIP47 was first identified as a binding partner of the mannose 6-phosphate receptor and may be involved in membrane traffic from the trans-Golgi network (27Diaz E. Pfeffer S.R.

However, recent work employing proteomics and microscopic analysis has provided evidence that TIP47 is also an LD protein (7Umlauf E. Csaszar E. Moertelmaier M. Schuetz G.J. Parton R.G. Prohaska R.

Another common feature of PAT family proteins is that expression of the corresponding genes is regulated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), ligand-activated transcription factors belonging to the nuclear receptor superfamily. Through heterodimerization with retinoid X receptors, they regulate gene transcription by binding to specific response elements (peroxisome proliferator response elements) (28Desvergne B. Wahli W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 649-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (2735) Google Scholar). The PPAR family comprises three closely related members, α, γ, and δ, each distributing tissue selectively; PPARα and -γ are predominant in the liver and adipocytes, respectively, whereas PPARδ is ubiquitously expressed (28Desvergne B. Wahli W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 649-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (2735) Google Scholar).

PPARs overall regulate various genes involved in lipid metabolism and are key players in body energy homeostasis. The available data, thus, support the notion that PAT proteins share involvement in lipid metabolism within LDs and that their diversity reflects multiple features of LDs in mammalian tissues. In line with this conclusion, we report here a novel member of the PAT family named MLDP (myocardial LD protein), also located on the surfaces of LDs and regulated by PPARα. In contrast to the previously described PAT proteins, MLDP is abundant in tissues containing minute LDs such as the heart rather than typical lipid storage organs like adipose tissue. Plasmids and Reagents—A cDNA of MLDP was obtained from total RNA of MLTC-1 cells by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and subcloned into the pCMV5 vector. The entire open reading frame and a series of truncation mutants of MLDP, created by PCR or digestion at appropriate restriction sites, were also inserted into a GFP expression vector, phGFP (105) (41Yamaguchi T. Omatsu N. Matsushita S. Osumi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30490-30497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). PPAR ligands, Wy14,643, rosiglitazone, and GW501,516, were purchased from Cayman Chemicals, Alexis, and Calbiochem, respectively. Real-time RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was prepared from various rat tissues using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol, and 25-ng aliquots were applied for reactions in MicroAmp 96-well plates. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed in an ABI Prism 7700 sequence detection system using TaqMan probes with One-step RT-PCR mix reagent (ABI), as recommended by the manufacturer. The forward and reverse primers were aggatgtccggtgatcagaca and ctgagttgtaggcaccagacaca for MLDP, ctgagcacatcgagtcacatactct and ggagcgtctggcatgtagtgt for ADRP, ccagttcacagctgctaatgagtt and ggtattgaagagccgggatctt for perilipin, and cattgaaatcctgagcgatgtg and tgtcaaacacctgctggatga for 36B4. Data were normalized based on the results of the parallel assay on 36B4. Cell Culture and DNA Transfection—MLTC-1 mouse Leydig cells were maintained in RPMI1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C under 5% CO2. For expression of GFP-MLDPs, MLTC-1 cells grown on coverslips were transfected with the expression vectors encoding the GFP-fused full-length or truncation mutants of MLDP. Transfection was performed using Lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen) according to the supplier's manual, and after 24 h the cells were processed for fluorescence microscopy. 3T3-L1 cells were maintained as described previously (42Tominaga S. Morikawa M. Osumi T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 132: 881-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). For adipogenic differentiation, confluent 3T3-L1 cells (day 0) were treated with a hormone mixture containing 1 μm dexamethasone, 0.5 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, and 5 μg/ml insulin in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum. After 48 h (day 2) the mixture was removed, and cells were maintained in the same medium supplemented with 5 μg/ml insulin. L6 rat skeletal muscle cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Myoblasts were differentiated into myotubes in the same medium containing 2% fetal bovine serum. Antibodies—A polyclonal antibody against MLDP was raised against a synthetic peptide (C-terminal 18 residues of mouse MLDP) conjugated with keyhole limpet hemocyanin. The antibody was affinity-purified using a resin coupled with the peptide. Guinea pig polyclonal anti-ADRP and anti-perilipin antibodies were purchased from Progen. RT-PCR—Total RNA was prepared as described above. cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA in a reaction mixture containing Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) using a downstream primer mixture (2 pmol of each) in a total volume of 20 μl. PCR was performed with 2 μl of the RT product as a template and 10 pmol each of the upstream and downstream primers and rTaq DNA polymerase (Takara). The reaction products were separated in 2% agarose gels and detected with a fluorescence imaging analyzer FLA3000 (Fuji). Intensities of the bands were quantified by densitometry with software installed in FLA3000. Northern Blotting—RNA (20 μg) was separated on 1.2% agarose/formaldehyde/MOPS gels and blotted to GeneScreen Plus Nylon membranes (DuPont). After prehybridization for 2 h at 42 °C in hybridization buffer (10% dextran sulfate, 1 m NaCl, 1% SDS, 50% formamide), membranes were hybridized for 16 h at 42 °C in the same buffer with a radiolabeled probe (32P-labeled cDNA fragment for murine MLDP or rat 36B4, 3 × 105 cpm/ml) and then washed with 2× standard saline citrate (SSC (1× SSC = 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate)), 1% SDS 3 times at 65 °C for 20 min each followed by 2 washes with 0.2× SSC at room temperature for 10 min each. Hybridization signals were identified with the FLA3000 imaging analyzer. Subcellular Fractionation—Fractionation of MLTC-1 cells was carried out according to a previous report (21Brasaemle D.L. Barber T. Wolins N.E. Serrero G. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Londos C. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 2249-2263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Cells (three 150-mm dishes) were washed with PBS, collected by centrifugation, resuspended in a hypotonic medium (10 mm HEPES/NaOH (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm sodium fluoride, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)) and incubated for 10 min on ice followed by 20 strokes with a Teflon/glass homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C to obtain post-nuclear supernatant (PNS). For gradient centrifugation PNS was adjusted to 30% sucrose and layered beneath a 0-30% sucrose gradient. Centrifugation was carried out at 100,000 × g for 6 h at 4°C. Twelve fractions were collected from the top, and proteins were sedimented from each fraction with trichloroacetic acid. An equal aliquot (10% for mouse heart or 15% for MLTC-1 cells) of each fraction was analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. For the subcellular fractionation of heart, one mouse heart was minced in a tissue disintegrator and homogenized with a Teflon/glass homogenizer. PNS was obtained by centrifugation at 800 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Gradient centrifugation was performed as described above. Western Blotting—For immunodetection of MLDP, mouse tissues were homogenized in 0.25 m sucrose containing 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a proteinase inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Cultured cells were washed with PBS and directly dissolved in heated SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Aliquots of the extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Proteins were probed with the affinity-purified anti-MLDP antibody and detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) (Amersham Biosciences). Fluorescence Microscopy—Transfected MLTC-1 cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature and counterstained with 100 ng/ml Nile-Red in PBS for 10 min. After washing with PBS, cells were mounted and observed under a confocal microscope (LSM510, Carl Zeiss). For detection of ADRP and perilipin, cells expressing GFP-MLDP were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, PBS. Fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.01% digitonin, PBS for ADRP or 0.2% Triton X-100, PBS for perilipin and blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS. Cells were then incubated with primary polyclonal antibody against ADRP or perilipin for 1 h, washed with PBS, and incubated with Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 1 h. Washed cells were observed under a fluorescence microscope (Biozero, KEYENCE). Animal Study—Experiments were performed using groups of control C57BL/6J and PPARα null mice (43Lee S.S. Pineau T. Drago J. Lee E.J. Owens J.W. Kroetz D.L. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Westphal H. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3012-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1501) Google Scholar) maintained on a chow diet with a 12:12-h dark-light cycle. For PPARα activation, mice were fed diet with or without 0.05% Wy14,643 supplementation for 5 days. For the fasting experiment, diet was withdrawn from the mice for 24 h. The tissues were harvested, rinsed with PBS, and homogenized in QIAzol Lysis regent (Qiagen) for RNA extraction or treated with 0.25 m sucrose containing 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a proteinase inhibitor mixture (Sigma) for protein extraction. The study protocol was approved by the Animal Experiment Committee of Graduate School of Life Science, University of Hyogo. MLDP Is a Novel Member of the PAT Family—PAT family proteins have been identified as proteins mainly associated with LDs and are present in diverse species such as vertebrates, Drosophila, and Dictyostelium but not yeast. In mammalian cells four representative proteins of this family, perilipin, ADRP, TIP47, and S3-12, have hitherto been described and are considered to be primarily involved in intracellular lipid metabolism. In the PAT domain two subdomains have been defined; PAT-1 at the N terminus with ∼100 amino acids having high identity (Fig. 1A, PAT-1), and PAT-2, which is less similar at the C terminus, including the 33-mer motif also found in S3-12 (Fig. 1A, 33m). Despite the sequence similarities, individual PAT proteins are likely to have diverse roles in LDs (44Londos C. Sztalryd C. Tansey J.T. Kimmel A.R. Biochimie (Paris). 2005; 87: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Here, we identified a novel murine protein that contains a PAT domain by NCBI BLAST search. This sequence (gi:27754108, Riken cDNA 2310076L09) has previously been reported with the name PAT1 (14Miura S. Gan J.W. Brzostowski J. Parisi M.J. Schultz C.J. Londos C. Oliver B. Kimmel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32253-32257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), but the protein was not characterized. Because “PAT1” might easily be confused with the PAT-1 subdomain, we term this protein MLDP (myocardial LD protein, for the reasons described below) to distinguish them. MLDP shares sequence similarity along its entire length with perilipin, ADRP, and TIP47, especially in the PAT-1 domain (Fig. 1, A and B) and the 33-mer motif (Fig. 1A). We also searched for homologous cDNA species in databases and found a putative rat cDNA (gi:62718060) and a human partial cDNA similar to mouse MLDP (gi:61966858), implicating conservation of this sequence in mammals. Tissue-selective Expression of MLDP—To characterize MLDP, we first examined the relative mRNA levels in various rat tissues by TaqMan RT-PCR, in comparison with those of perilipin and ADRP (Fig. 2A). The MLDP transcript was found in the heart at the highest level followed by skeletal muscle and the adrenals (Fig. 2A, asterisk), with relatively low levels in the liver and adipose tissues. Little or no expression was detected in other tissues. Expression patterns of perilipin and ADRP transcripts were largely consistent with previous reports (15Greenberg A.S. Egan J.J. Wek S.A. Moos Jr., M.C. Londos C. Kimmel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 12035-12039Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 21Brasaemle D.L. Barber T. Wolins N.E. Serrero G. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Londos C. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 2249-2263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), supporting the fidelity of the results; that is, perilipin expression was highly restricted to adipose tissue and detected to a much lower extent in the adrenal, which contains steroidogenic cells. ADRP expression was nearly ubiquitous but was relatively enriched in the adrenal, liver, and ovary (Fig. 2A). The tissue distribution of MLDP was confirmed by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 2B). The cDNA probe identified two species of transcript, a major one of 2.2 kb corresponding to the cDNA found in data base, and a minor one of 1.4 kb. Similar to the results in Fig. 2A, MLDP was particularly abundant in the heart, adrenal, muscle, and adipose tissue, whereas few or no MLDP transcripts were detected in other tissues. The 36B4, a ribosomal protein gene used as a control, showed a nearly constant expression level across tissues. Expression of MLDP mRNA was also examined in cultured cells. L6 and 3T3-L1 cells were used as models for muscle and adipocytes, respectively. In L6 myoblasts, MLDP mRNA was expressed at a low level, but on differentiation to myotubes up-regulation was apparent. Perilipin was not expressed, and ADRP mRNA was observed at similar levels irrespective of the differentiation (Fig. 2C). In 3T3-L1 cells, as expected, perilipin and ADRP were up-regulated upon adipocyte differentiation. In 3T3-L1 cells, however, MLDP transcripts were not detected despite the considerable expression in rat adipose tissue (Figs. 2, A and B). This might be due to difference in the natures of adipose tissue and 3T3-L1 cells. In MTLC-1 cells, derived from mouse steroidogenic cells that contain LDs storing cholesterol ester, all PAT members including MLDP were expressed (Fig. 2C). Identification of Endogenous MLDP in LDs—To characterize endogenous MLDP, we raised a polyclonal antibody against a synthetic peptide for the MLDP C terminus for application in an immunoblot analysis of total protein samples from various mouse tissues. As shown in Fig. 3A, the antibody bound to several bands, prominently at the positions of 54 kDa (Fig. 3A, arrow) and 59 kDa (Fig. 3A, asterisk). The lower band corresponded to endogenous MLDP with a calibrated molecular mass of 49 kDa. This was confirmed by electrophoresis of recombinant MLDP protein produced in HeLa cells in parallel (data not shown). Consistent with the mRNA distribution, the most prominent band was observed for the heart. After short exposure times, MLDP was detected only in the heart, but longer exposure uncovered lower levels of expression in the adrenals and liver. Despite the mRNA expression in muscle and adipose tissue, we could not detect MLDP protein in these tissues (Fig. 3A). To address the intracellular location of MLDP, we next performed subcellular fractionation of mouse heart. PNS was subjected to flotation centrifugation through a 0-30% sucrose density gradient, and fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting for MLDP or other PAT family members. A significant amount of endogenous MLDP was recovered in the top fraction (Fig. 3B, top) and co-fractionated with ADRP but not with PMP70, a peroxisomal marker. We also performed subcellular fractionation using MLTC-1 cells. Again, MLDP was found in the top fraction and co-fractionated with ADRP and perilipin, the latter presenting as multiple bands corresponding to alternatively spliced forms (16Servetnick D.A.

We speculate that loss of DKK expression plays a role in development or progression of malignant melanoma. Thus, we evaluated melanoma cell lines and tissue samples of malignant melanoma for loss of DKK, especially DKK-3 transcription. We found that DKK-1, -2 and -3 were downregulated or lost in all cell lines and in most of the tumor samples analysed. Reduced DKK-3 expression occurred as early as in primary tumors detected by both immunohistochemical and reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction RT–PCR analysis. Functional assays with stable DKK-3 transfected cell lines revealed that DKK-3 expression increased cell-cell adhesion and decreased cell migration. Further, downregulation of fibronectin, snail-1 and re-expression of E-cadherin was found in the DKK-3 expressing cell clones supporting a role of DKK-3 in tumor progression. Our studies thus indicate that loss of DKK-3 expression may contribute to melanoma progression."
https://openalex.org/W2129787742,"Gamma-secretase is a multimeric membrane protein complex composed of presenilin (PS), nicastrin, Aph-1 and, Pen-2 that is responsible for the intramembrane proteolysis of various type I transmembrane proteins, including amyloid beta-precursor protein and Notch. The direct labeling of PS polypeptides by transition-state analogue gamma-secretase inhibitors suggested that PS represents the catalytic center of gamma-secretase. Here we show that one of the major gamma-secretase inhibitors of dipeptidic type, N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl)-l-alanyl]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester (DAPT), targets the C-terminal fragment of PS, especially the transmembrane domain 7 or more C-terminal region, by designing and synthesizing DAP-BpB (N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl)-l-alanyl]-(S)-phenylglycine-4-(4-(8-biotinamido)octylamino)benzoyl)benzyl)methylamide), a photoactivable DAPT derivative. We also found that DAP-BpB selectively binds to the high molecular weight gamma-secretase complex in an activity-dependent manner. Photolabeling of PS by DAP-BpB is completely blocked by DAPT or its structural relatives (e.g. Compound E) as well as by arylsulfonamides. In contrast, transition-state analogue inhibitor L-685,458 or alpha-helical peptidic inhibitor attenuated the photolabeling of PS1 only at higher concentrations. These data illustrate the DAPT binding site as a novel functional domain within the PS C-terminal fragment that is distinct from the catalytic site or the substrate binding site."
https://openalex.org/W2071917878,"Interactions among Bcl-2 family proteins mediated by Bcl-2 homology (BH) regions transform apoptosis signals into actions. The interactions between BH3 region-only proteins and multi-BH region proteins such as Bax and Bcl-2 have been proposed to be the dominant interactions required for initiating apoptosis. Experimental evidence also suggests that both homo- and hetero-interactions are mediated primarily by the BH3 regions in all Bcl-2 family proteins and contribute to commitment to or inhibition of apoptosis. We found that a peptide containing the BH3 helix of Bax was not sufficient to activate recombinant Bax to permeabilize mitochondria. However, an extended peptide containing the BH3 helix and additional downstream sequences activated Bax to permeabilize mitochondria and liposomes. Bcl-2 inhibited the membrane-permeabilizing activity of peptide-activated Bax. This activity of Bcl-2 was inhibited by the extended but not the BH3-only peptide despite both peptides binding to Bcl-2 with similar affinity. Further, membrane-bound Bax activation intermediates directly activated soluble Bax further permeabilizing the membrane. Bcl-2 inhibited Bax auto-activation. We therefore propose that Bax auto-activation amplifies the initial death signal produced by BH3-only proteins and that Bcl-2 functions as an inhibitor of Bax auto-activation.

The dominant form of programmed cell death, apoptosis, plays an essential role in embryogenesis and tissue homeostasis of multicellular organisms by removing unwanted or damaged cells. Impaired regulation of apoptosis is implicated in a variety of diseases including cancer and stroke. Two kinds of signals can trigger apoptosis, death signals received by death receptors on cell surface, and stress signals such as structural and genotypic damage. The latter apoptotic signals mainly route through mitochondria to provoke activation of caspases and nucleases that cleave critical proteins and DNAs thereby dismantling the cell (1Danial N.N.

After receiving certain apoptotic stimuli, pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins induce the release of cytochrome c and other pro-apoptotic proteins from mitochondria by triggering permeabilization of the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM) by the multi-BH domain proteins Bax and Bak (3Wei M.C.

There is insufficient sequence similarity in BH3 region sequences to permit unambiguous identification from sequence alone. It appears that BH3 region proteins act as sensors within the cell, reporting on a variety of subcellular defects. BH3 proteins are thought therefore to function to integrate signals from disparate cell signaling pathways and subcellular locations. Typically BH3-only proteins are classified as either a “sensitizer” that binds to and inhibits anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins including Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bcl-w, Mcl-1, and A1 (8Yang E. Zha J.

Furthermore it appears that some functional interactions between BH3-only proteins and other Bcl-2 family proteins may be transient.To map the various interactions and begin to deduce their relative importance in different apoptotic pathways several groups have measured the affinity of BH3 peptides derived from BH3-only proteins for binding to a variety of Bcl-2 family proteins (10Letai A. Bassik M.C. Walensky L.D. Sorcinelli M.D. Weiler S. Korsmeyer S.J. Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 183-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar, 12Chen L. Willis S.N. Wei A.

The common theme from these measurements is that most BH3 peptides bind preferentially to certain type of Bcl-2-like proteins, suggesting that selectivity exists between most BH3-only proteins and Bcl-2-like proteins. Two different views, however, have emerged from these studies mainly because the behavior of a few BH3 peptides derived from the “activators” Bid and Bim. The Bid and Bim BH3 peptides are more potent than other BH3 peptides in permeabilizing the MOM and inducing apoptosis. One view, based on the evidence that these peptides can directly activate Bax and Bak, is that MOM permeabilzation and cell demise require activation of pro-death Bax-like proteins. The other view, derived from the observation that these peptides can bind to most known pro-survival Bcl-2-like proteins, is that cell death will proceed only when most, if not all, pro-survival proteins are neutralized by Bid or Bim or by combinations of their more specialized BH3-only cousins.In support of the above neutralization model, stable complexes or direct binding has been observed between various BH3 peptides and Bcl-2-like proteins (27Petros A.M. Nettesheim D.G. Wang Y. Olejnicizak E.T. Meadows R.P. Mack J. Swift K. Matayoshi E.D. Zhang H. Thompson C.B. Fesik S.W.

Immunity. 2003; 19: 341-352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Evidence for direct binding of Bax and/or Bak by BH3-only proteins to activate Bax and Bak directly is scarce (9Cheng E.H. Wei M.C. Weiler S. Flavell J.K. Mak T.W. Lindsten T. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol.

A. 2004; 101: 15313-15317Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). A kiss and run model has been proposed to reconcile the data (17Perez D. White E. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 53-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Thus, the BH3-only proteins only transiently touch (kiss) the Bax and Bak proteins. Once the latter are activated, the former will leave (run) so the latter can homo-oligomerize in MOM. According to this model one BH3 protein can activate many multidomain pro-apoptotic proteins through a series of transient interactions. Bcl-2-like proteins may disrupt the kiss by binding the BH3-only protein thereby inhibiting activation of Bax and Bak.Understandably the above studies focused on the effects of peptides from BH3-only proteins, neglecting the potentially important contributions of homo-interactions in regulating commitment to apoptosis. It is well documented that both Bcl-2-like proteins and Bax-like proteins can form homo-oligomers in vitro and in vivo. Though much less work has been done on the homo-association of Bcl-2-like proteins (26Zhang Z. Lapolla S.M. Annis M.G. Truscott M. Roberts G.J. Miao Y. Shao Y. Tan C. Peng J. Johnson A.E. Zhang X.C.

Chem. 2001; 276: 18361-18374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). However, most of these studies are focused on the effect of oligomerization on MOM permeability. Much less is known about the role of homo-interaction between Bax-like proteins in activating more Bax-like proteins, though the obvious fact is that the Bax BH3 region sequence and structure are not much different from that of BH3-only proteins. However in a recent study, Ruffolo and Shore (25Ruffolo S. Shore G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25039-25045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) demonstrated that Bak, activated by a BH3-only protein, can activate other Bak proteins via homo-interactions, thereby amplifying the signal from the BH3-only activator. This represents a third view about the apoptosis commitment step. Thus, after the initial activation events mediated by BH3-only activators, the activated Bax and Bak proteins may themselves function as sensitizers or activators or both.To determine whether Bax auto-activation contributes to homo-oligomerization and to address the function(s) of Bax in the process leading toward MOM permeabilization, we studied various Bax peptides, Bax and Bcl-2 proteins in cell, mitochondrion, liposome, and solution-based systems. We found that the Bax BH3 peptide is not sufficient to activate Bax. Instead an extended peptide including both BH3 helix (helix 2) and a downstream helix (helix 3) (designated H2-H3 peptide) is required. Moreover, we demonstrated that while the extended peptide can interact with Bcl-2 and inhibit its function in solution, the primary target of the peptide in both mitochondrion and liposome-based systems is Bax, suggesting that the primary target of active Bax may be inactive Bax molecules. Auto-activation of Bax may also be related to the oligomerization of Bax proteins in the MOM that accompanies MOM permeabilization.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—The following peptides containing helix 2 (H2) and/or 3 (H3) sequence of human Bax were synthesized by Global Peptide Services (Fort Collins, CO). Their Mr was verified by mass spectrometry, and purity was determined by analytical reverse phase HPLC to be >90%. H2, 52QDASTKKLSECLKRIGDELDS72; and CF-H2, H2 with a carboxyfluorescein (CF) labeled at the N terminus; H2-H3, 53DASTKKLSECLKRIGDELDSNMELQRMIAAVDTD86; CF-H2-H3, H2-H3 with a CF labeled at the N terminus, and H2-H3 G67R with the underlined G (Gly) changed to R (Arg); and H3, 71DSNMELQRMIAAVDTD86. The numbers are the sequence numbers of the first and last residues in Bax protein sequence. Expression and purification of full-length human Bax and Bcl-2ΔTM proteins were as described (26Zhang Z.

Cascade Blue (CB) or tetramethylrhodamine-labeled dextrans and an anti-CB antibody were from Molecular Probes.Microinjection—Rat-1MycERTAM cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 16–24 h prior to injection. The injection solution contains 500 μm peptide and 1 mg/ml tetramethylrhodamine-labeled dextran (as injection marker) in microinjection buffer (70 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm NaPO4, pH 7.2). Injections were done using an Eppendorf semiautomatic microinjection system (1× Injectman NI2 micromanipulator, 1× microscope adapter, and 1× Femtojet) with the pressure set at 100 Pa. Cells were filmed for 4 h post-injection with images captured every 5 min using a Hamamatsu Orca AG charge-cooled digital camera. Throughout the experiment, cells were maintained in Leibovitz's L15 media supplemented with 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.2) at 37 °C using a Bioptechs Delta T dish mounted in a Bioptechs heated stage apparatus. Images were processed with the Openlab suite of imaging software (Improvision, Inc., Lexington, MA) and imported into Photoshop (version 8.0) for generating figures.Assay of Cytochrome c Release from Mitochondria—Cell-free assays for cytochrome c release were performed as described (7Annis M.G. Soucie E.L. Dlugosz P.J. Cruz-Aguado J.A. Penn L.Z. Leber B. Andrews D.W. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2096-2103Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) except that tBid protein was replaced by various Bax peptides, and the mitochondria were isolated from Rat-1MycERTAM cells either expressing or not expressing human Bcl-2 (33Kim P.K. Annis M.G. Dlugosz P.J. Leber B. Andrews D.W. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 523-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar).Preparation of Liposomes—Liposomes were made by the extrusion method as described but with the following modifications (34Heuck A.P. Tweten R.K. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31218-31225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Lipids were mixed in chloroform with a composition similar to that of Xenopus oocyte MOM as described (19Kuwana T. Mackey M.R. Perkins G. Ellisman M.H. Latterich M. Schneiter R. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D. Cell. 2002; 111: 331-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1209) Google Scholar). The lipid mixture was dried by nitrogen and vacuum, and resuspended in 0.55 ml of buffer A (100 mm NaCl, 51 mm Na2HPO4, and 3.8 mm citric acid, pH 7.4) with 30 μm CB-labeled 3- or 10-kDa dextran. The total lipid concentration of this sample was 20 mm. In addition, trace of 14C-labeled phosphatidylcholine was added into the sample to determine the lipid concentration in final liposome fractions from gel filtration chromatography. After extrusion, free CB-dextrans were separated from the liposomes with entrapped CB-dextrans by a gel filtration chromatography using a 0.7 × 50 cm Sephadex CL-2B column.Assay of Dextran Release from Liposomes by Fluorescence Quenching—Purified Bax protein (50 nm) was incubated with the liposomes with 6.25 μm lipids and encapsulated CB-dextrans in buffer A at 37 °C. The anti-CB antibody (6 μg/ml) was presented outside the liposomes to monitor the release of CB-dextrans from liposomes since the binding of antibody to CB-dextran quenches CB fluorescence. The Bax protein did not induce any fluorescence quenching, thereby the fluorescence intensity of above sample was taken as the initial intensity (F0). The H2, H2-H3, or H2-H3 G67R peptide was then titrated into the sample and the intensity (F) was measured again when the intensity became stable, typically 1 h after each titration. Finally 0.1% of Triton X-100 was used to lysis the liposomes, releasing all CB-dextrans, and the final intensity (FT) was then measured. The extent of CB-dextran release caused by each addition of peptide is proportional to the extent of fluorescence quenching that is equal to (F0 – F)/(F0 – FT). Of note, all the peptides did not induce any CB-dextran release in the absence of Bax protein even at the maximal concentration tested. The CB fluorescence intensity was measured using the SLM-8100 spectrofluorometer with excitation and emission wavelengths set at 385 and 417 nm, respectively, and bandpass at 4 nm. All measurements were done in 4 × 4-mm quartz microcells at 37 °C.To assay the effect of Bcl-2ΔTM protein on the above Bax/peptide-induced CB-dextran release, 500 nm purified Bcl-2ΔTM protein was added, and the F0 was measured prior to the addition of any peptides. Otherwise the experiments were done similarly as described above. To assay the effect of peptides on relieving Bcl-2ΔTM-mediated inhibition of CB-dextran release, the extent of CB-dextran release was determined first with a sample containing 50 nm Bax protein, 500 nm Bcl-2ΔTM protein, and 10 μm H2-H3 peptide. The additional peptides were then titrated into the sample and their effect on the extent of CB-dextran release was determined as described above.To assay the effect of liposome-bound Bax on activating soluble Bax to induce further release of CB-dextrans from the liposome, 6.25 μm liposome with encapsulated CB-dextrans were first incubated with 50 nm Bax, 20 μm H2-H3 peptide, and/or 500 nm Bcl-2ΔTM at 37 °C for 40 min, and then subjected to sucrose step gradient float-up centrifugation as described (32Yethon J.A. Epand R.F. Leber B. Epand R.M. Andrews D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48935-48941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The resulting top fraction (250 μl) that contains proteoliposomes was incubated with anti-CB antibodies either in the absence or presence of freshly added 50 nm Bax, 20 μm H2-H3 peptide, and/or 500 nm Bcl-2ΔTM. The CB fluorescence quenching was then followed for 6 h.To determine if any H2-H3 peptides were carried over from the first incubation into the top fraction that was used for the second incubation, 40 nm CF-H2-H3 peptides were included in the first incubation. The CF emission intensity of the top fraction and other fractions was monitored as described below. The distribution of the peptide in the fractions was estimated based on the intensities of each fraction. The distribution of liposomes was determined by measuring 14C counts that were resulted from the trace of [14C]phosphatidylcholine incorporated into the liposomes.Assay of the Effect of Bax Peptides on Association of Bax and Bcl-2ΔTM Proteins in Solution—[35S]Methionine-labeled Bax protein was synthesized using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate-based in vitro translation system as described (26Zhang Z. Lapolla S.M. Annis M.G. Truscott M. Roberts G.J. Miao Y. Shao Y. Tan C. Peng J. Johnson A.E. Zhang X.C. Andrews D.W. Lin J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43920-43928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The resulted translation product (10 μl) was incubated with 2.5 μm purified His6-tagged Bcl-2ΔTM protein either in the absence or presence of various concentrations of H2 or H2-H3 peptide in buffer B (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm KOAc, 5 mm Mg(OAc)2, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.25% (v/v) Triton X-100, and 5 mm imidazole) with a total volume of 13 μl at 4°C for 1 h. Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (200 μl of 4% (v/v) suspension in buffer B) was added. After incubation at 4 °C for 2 h, proteins bound to the Ni2+-beads were isolated and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and phosphorimaging as described (26Zhang Z. Lapolla S.M. Annis M.G. Truscott M. Roberts G.J.

All measurements were done at 25 °C in buffer A using 1 × 1 cm (for tryptophan fluorescence) or 4 × 4 mm (for CF fluorescence) quartz cuvettes and a bandpass of 4 nm. The excitation and emission wavelengths are 295 and 348 or 490 and 520 nm for tryptophan or CF fluorescence, respectively.Steady-state anisotropy was measured in the L-format using Glan-Thompson prism polarizers in both the excitation and emission light passes. The emission intensity measured through a horizontal polarizer when a sample was excited by vertical plane-polarized light was designated as IVH. IHH, IHV, and IVV were defined analogously. The component intensities of a fluorophore-free sample (without protein or CF-peptide) were subtracted from the corresponding component intensities of the sample containing the protein or CF-peptide to obtain the net intensities that were then used to calculate the anisotropy using Equation 1, r=IVV−GIVHIVV+2GIVH (Eq. 1) where the G-factor G = IHV/IHH. To monitor the homo-association of Bcl-2ΔTM proteins, tryptophan anisotropy was measured after each titration of Bcl-2ΔTM protein (1 μl) into 2.5 ml of buffer A. To monitor the binding of a Bax peptide to Bcl-2ΔTM protein, CF anisotropy was measured after each titration of Bcl-2ΔTM protein (1 μl) into 250 μl of buffer A containing 10 nm CF-labeled H2 peptide in the absence or presence of 10 μm competitor, unlabeled corresponding Bax peptide. All measurements were done when equilibrium was reached, typically 30 min after each titration.Anisotropy Data Analysis—When Bcl-2ΔTM protein was titrated into the solution without any peptides, the following model binding equilibrium (Equation 2) was used to derive the quadratic equation (Equation 3) for data analysis, B+B↔B2 (Eq. 2) −b0fB2+(2b0+Kd2)fB=b0 (Eq. 3) where B represents the monomer, and B2 the dimer of Bcl-2ΔTM. Kd is the dissociation constant for the binding equilibrium, and b0 the concentration of total Bcl-2ΔTM in the sample after each titration. (See supplemental data for the derivation of these and other equations.) According to the additivity law for anisotropies and considering the intensity change upon the Bcl-2ΔTM dimerization (35Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 2nd. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York1999: 303-309Google Scholar), 4C. Tan and J. Lin, unpublished data. the fraction of Bcl-2ΔTM in the dimer form, fB, can be related to the measured tryptophan anisotropy (r) of the sample after each titration using Equation 4, fB=r−rM(r−rM)+R(rD−r) (Eq. 4) where R is the ratio of the intensity of dimer to that of monomer Bcl-2ΔTM, and rM and rD the anisotropies of the monomer and dimer Bcl-2ΔTM, respectively.When Bcl-2ΔTM protein was titrated into the sample containing CF-labeled H2 peptide, the above binding equilibrium (Equation 2) competes with the following binding equilibrium (Equation 5) resulting in the cubic equation (Equation 6) for data analysis, B+L↔BL (Eq. 5) l0fl3+(2Kl2Kd−Kl−2l0−b0)fl2+(Kl+l0+2b0)fl=b0 (Eq. 6) where L represents the labeled peptide, and BL the Bcl-2ΔTM·labeled peptide complex. Kl is the dissociation constant for the binding equilibrium, and l0 the concentration of total L in the sample after each titration. Similar to the fB above, the fraction of L in the bound form, fl, can be related to the measured CF anisotropy (r1) of the sample after each titration using Equation 7, fl=r1−rF(r1−rF)+R1(rB−r1) (Eq."
https://openalex.org/W1963685478,"Cellular metastasis is the most detrimental step in carcinoma disease progression, yet the mechanisms that regulate this process are poorly understood. CXCL12 and its receptor CXCR4 are co-expressed in several tissues and cell types throughout the body and play essential roles in development. Disruption of either gene causes embryonic lethality due to similar defects. Post-natally, CXCL12 signaling has a wide range of effects on CXCR4-expressing cells, including the directed migration of leukocytes, lymphocytes and hematopoietic stem cells. Recently, this signaling axis has also been described as an important regulator of directed carcinoma cell metastasis. We show herein that while CXCR4 expression remains consistent, constitutive colonic epithelial expression of CXCL12 is silenced by DNA hypermethylation in primary colorectal carcinomas as well as colorectal carcinoma-derived cell lines. Inhibition of DNA methyltransferase (Dnmt) enzymes with 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine or genetic ablation of both Dnmt1 and Dnmt3b prevented promoter methylation and restored CXCL12 expression. Re-expression of functional, endogenous CXCL12 in colorectal carcinoma cells dramatically reduced metastatic tumor formation in mice, as well as foci formation in soft agar. Decreased metastasis was correlated with increased caspase activity in cells re-expressing CXCL12. These data constitute the unique observation that silencing CXCL12 within colonic carcinoma cells greatly enhances their metastatic potential."
https://openalex.org/W2101375158,"In glaucoma the retinal ganglion cells of the retina die through the induction of apoptosis leading to excavation of the optic nerve and blindness. Mutations in the optineurin (optic neuropathy inducing) protein were found associated with an adult form of glaucoma. To date, the role of optineurin in the neurodegeneration process that occurs during glaucoma is still unknown. We now report that in response to an apoptotic stimulus, optineurin changes subcellular localization and translocates from the Golgi to the nucleus. This translocation is dependent on the GTPase activity of Rab8, an interactor of optineurin. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the overexpression of optineurin protects cells from H2O2-induced cell death and blocks cytochrome c release from the mitochondria. A mutated form of optineurin, E50K, identified in normal tension glaucoma patients loses its ability to translocate to the nucleus and when overexpressed compromises the mitochondrial membrane integrity resulting in cells that are less fit to survive under stress conditions. The correlation between optineurin function and cell survival will be key to begin to understand retinal ganglion cell biology and signaling and to design general ""survival"" strategies to treat a disease of such a complex etiology as glaucoma."

This includes microcephaly and immune deficiency, mostly characterized by a severely impaired development of B and T lymphocytes. Both conditions are caused by a faulty NHEJ, which translates into increased cellular sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents and the impaired capacity to join double-stranded DNA ends in vitro and in vivo. This parallel prompted us to hypothesize that Cernunnos may be acting at the same level as the XRCC4·DNA-ligase IV complex during DNA repair and may indeed incorporates into this complex.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAntibodies and Immunoprecipitation—The Cernunnos Orf, together with a C terminus V5 or myc epitope tag, was cloned into the pCDNA3.1 vector (7Buck D.

As shown in Fig. 1A, the immunoprecipitation of Cernunnos via the V5 tag co-precipitated DNA-ligase IV (lane 6, upper panel). Conversely, the immunoprecipitation of either endogenous DNA-ligase IV (lane 8) or XRCC4 (lane 10) co-precipitated the transfected Cernunnos protein (revealed by anti-V5 antibody, bottom panel) in both cases. The same co-immunoprecipitation results were obtained (Fig. 1B) using the myc epitope-tagged version of Cernunnos. This demonstrates that XRCC4, DNA-ligase IV, and Cernunnos are part of a same complex. While this manuscript was under review, Ahnesorg et al. (15Ahnesorg P. Smith P. Jackson S.P. Cell. 2006; 124: 301-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar) reported on the identification of XLF, a factor identical to Cernunnos, through its physical interaction with XRCC4.Cernunnos Is Homologous to XRCC4—To get further insight into the role of Cernunnos in NHEJ, we performed careful bioinformatics analysis of its protein sequence. Using HCA, a sensitive two-dimensional approach that is well suited to analyze the two-dimensional texture of proteins and compare their secondary structures (12Gaboriaud C. Bissery V. Benchetrit T. Mornon J.P. FEBS Lett. 1987; 224: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 13Callebaut I. Labesse G. Durand P. Poupon A. Canard L. Chomilier J. Henrissat B. Mornon J.P. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1997; 53: 621-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar), we first identified in the Cernunnos sequence a globular domain, ranging from amino acids 1–230. Using this sequence as query in PSI-BLAST (11Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59206) Google Scholar) searches with default parameters, we detected different homologs of Cernunnos at convergence by iteration 4. A few of these sequences are shown in Fig. 2A (yellow box). A marginal similarity with a putative DNA double strand break repair protein from Arabidopsis thaliana was observed just above the threshold E-value (E-value = 0.28; 16% of identity over 108 amino acids). This protein turned out to be the plant XRCC4 homolog (white box in Fig. 2A), sharing with the human protein 24% sequence identity over the head and stalk regions. The similarity reported by PSI-BLAST between human Cernunnos and Arabidopsis XRCC4 encompasses the globular “head” domain of XRCC4 and the initial portion of the helical stalk, the overall region that promotes XRCC4 dimerization (16Junop M.S.

The similarity was supported at the two-dimensional level using HCA, revealing the conservation of the secondary structures forming the head domain, which contains a β-sandwich and two α-helices, as well as the helical stalk (Figs. 2A and 3A and data not shown). Most of the conserved features correspond to hydrophobicity (positions in which hydrophobicity is conserved are green in Fig. 2, with highly conserved aromatic residues in purple). These amino acids mainly participate in the head core structure or are involved in the contact with the initial portion of the stalk (e.g. Trp13 (W13) in Fig. 3A). Only a few surface-exposed residues are conserved, such as Phe117 and Trp119, which may be part of a potential interaction site (Fig. 3A). The finding of deleterious missense mutations (R57G and C123R in Fig. 3A) in the vicinity of these residues in patients (7Buck D. Malivert L. de Chasseval R. Barraud A. Fondanèche M.C. Sanal O.

Cell. 2006; 124: 287-299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar) further strengthens the likely functional significance of this region of Cernunnos. Other PSI-BLAST searches were performed using Cernunnos homologous sequences as queries, which highlighted marginal similarities with additional XRCC4 proteins (E-value = >0.001), also supported at the two-dimensional level (data not shown). This first finding thus reveals a novel family of structurally similar proteins, gathering XRCC4 and Cernunnos. When our manuscript was under review, a similar conclusion was drawn by Ahnesorg et al. (15Ahnesorg P. Smith P. Jackson S.P. Cell. 2006; 124: 301-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar), who used fold recognition methods to unravel the structural relationship between Cernunnos/XLF and XRCC4. However, these automatic methods proposed two different alignments of Cernunnos/XLF with the two available experimental structures of XRCC4, which yet share an almost identical sequence (99% identity; see Fig. 1 of supplemental data in Ref. 15Ahnesorg P. Smith P. Jackson S.P. Cell. 2006; 124: 301-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). Here, we propose a refined alignment of the two protein sequences, performed using the sensitive HCA methodology. This one benefited from the additional evolutionary information coming from the direct consideration of the whole Cernunnos and XRCC4 families. Accordingly, the alignment of the Cernunnos family sequences well conserved the structural invariants constituting the XRCC4 hydrophobic core (positions are shaded green and violet in Fig. 2A). These features were reinforced when considering the Nej1 sequences (see below).FIGURE 2Multiple sequence alignments of members of the Cernunnos/Nej1 family and XRCC4 proteins. A, the “head.” The alignment was constructed on the basis of PSI-BLAST results and manually refined using HCA. The D. hansenii protein has been significantly detected as a Cernunnos homolog as well as a Nej1 homolog (horizontal green box at the intersection of the yellow (Cernunnos) and blue (Nej1) boxes). It thus constitutes the intermediate protein, which allows revealing the relationship between Nej1 and Cernunnos. There is 15.8% sequence identity between the sequences of human Cernunnos and D. hansenii Cernunnos/Nej1 (119 aligned positions) and 10.3% between the sequences of D. hansenii Cernunnos/Nej1 and S. cerevisiae Nej1 (116 aligned positions).

XRCC4, but not Cernunnos, is found in plants (A. thaliana). The conserved sequences found in a similar location within the stalk in yeast Cernunnos/Nej1 proteins is not shown, as the corresponding profile poorly matches those of metazoan sequences.

Several combinatorial associations with Cernunnos (green) can be hypothesized.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Several reports, including structural studies, have proposed that XRCC4 forms dimers in association with DNA-ligase IV or tetramers, the DNA-ligase IV-interacting region, and the tetramer stabilization region overlapping in the helical tail of XRCC4 (Fig. 2B) (16Junop M.S.

Equilibrium sedimentation analysis associated with in vitro mutagenesis suggested that these two forms of the XRCC4 protein (dimers with DNA-ligase IV versus tetramers) are mutually exclusive (18Modesti M. Junop M.S. Ghirlando R. van de Rakt M. Gellert M. Yang W. Kanaar R. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 334: 215-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Although more difficult to align in the helical tail, Cernunnos and XRCC4 share similarities, especially in the DNA-ligase IV binding region of XRCC4 (Fig. 2B). Lys188 (Cernunnos Lys207), one of the residues involved in a salt bridge with the DNA-ligase IV BRCA1 C terminus domain linker, appears conserved in several sequences, as well as the F180IXXL cluster (Cernunnos F199LXXF), which makes hydrophobic contacts with DNA-ligase IV (20Sibanda B.L. Critchlow S.E. Begun J. Pei X.Y. Jackson S.P. Blundell T.L. Pellegrini L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 1015-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar).The finding that Cernunnos is related to XRCC4 on the one hand and the demonstration that Cernunnos interacts with the XRCC4·DNA-ligase IV complex on the other hand raises the interesting issue of the possible combinatorial associations of these two proteins within XRCC4/Cernunnos dimers and/or tetramers (Fig. 3B) and the possible functional consequences of these various combinations. As a first way to address this issue, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments following cotransfection of 293T cells with V5 epitope-tagged Cernunnos and myc epitope-tagged Cernunnos. As shown in Fig. 1C, immunoprecipitation with anti-V5 and anti-myc co-precipitated the Cernunnos-myc and Cernunnos-V5, respectively. This suggests that Cernunnos, as described for XRCC4, can form homoduplexes or at least that two Cernunnos molecules are part of the same complex as also demonstrated by Ahnesorg et al. (15Ahnesorg P. Smith P. Jackson S.P. Cell. 2006; 124: 301-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). Although the definite answers to these questions need further in vitro and in vivo investigations, one can already postulate that, given the embryonic lethality of XRCC4 mutant mice (21Gao Y. Sun Y. Frank K.M. Dikkes P. Fujiwara Y. Seidl K.J. Sekiguchi J.M. Rathbun G.A. Swat W. Wang J. Bronson R.T. Malynn B.A. Bryans M. Zhu C. Chaudhuri J. Davidson L. Ferrini R. Stamato T. Orkin S.H. Greenberg M.E. Alt F.W. Cell. 1998; 95: 891-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar) and the severe immunodeficiency and developmental anomalies of human Cernunnos-deficient patients (7Buck D. Malivert L. de Chasseval R. Barraud A. Fondanèche M.C. Sanal O. Plebani A. Stéphan J.L. Hufnagel M. Deist F. Le Fischer A. Durandy A. de Villartay J.P. Revy P. Cell. 2006; 124: 287-299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar), these two factors, although part of the same complex, are not redundant. Moreover, overexpression of XRCC4 in Cernunnos-deficient cells does not reverse the defective V(D)J recombination (supplemental Fig. S1) indicating that these two factors play specific parts during the NHEJ process.Cernunnos Is Homologous to Yeast Nej1—Several putative partners of XRCC4 and DNA-ligase IV have been identified in mammals and yeast. One of these, Nej1/Lif2p, has been identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae through its interaction with Lif1p, the yeast homolog of XRCC4, and by virtue of the fact that it is transcriptionally repressed/expressed in yeast diploid and haploid cells respectively (4Valencia M.

Science. 2001; 294: 2552-2556Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Nej1 thus appears as a critical regulator of NHEJ activity in yeast cells undergoing mating type switching. Moreover, ectopic expression of Nej1 restores NHEJ in MATa/MATα diploid cells to some extent (4Valencia M. Bentele M. Vaze M.B. Herrmann G. Kraus E. Lee S.E. Schar P. Haber J.E. Nature. 2001; 414: 666-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 5Frank-Vaillant M. Marcand S. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3005-3012Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 6Kegel A. Sjostrand J.O. Astrom S.U. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1611-1617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). To date no homolog of Nej1 has been identified in other organisms, including the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Given their interaction with the XRCC4·DNA-ligase IV complex and their similar molecular weight, we tackled the idea that Cernunnos may represent the genuine mammalian Nej1 homolog.Cernunnos was identified from human to several yeast species (S. pombe, Neurospora crassa, Gibberella zeae, Magnaporthe grisea, Aspergillus nidulans, Debaryomyces hansenii, Yarrowia lipolytica) by data base mining (Fig. 2A, yellow and green boxes, and data not shown) but intriguingly could not be found within the PSI-BLAST significant results in the S. cerevisiae species. No candidate could be found within the non-significant alignments either. Taking the opposite approach, using the S. cerevisiae Nej1 sequence as query in a PSI-BLAST search (same parameters as above) highlighted marginal similarities with two yeast sequences (Kluyveromyces lactis (E-value = 0.038) and Aphis gossypii (E-value = 0.14), Fig. 2A, blue box), which could be further supported at the two-dimensional level (data not shown). To further broaden the analysis, these loose similarities were quoted with significant E-values and extended to other yeast species in a reciprocal strategy. For example starting from the A. gossypii sequence, we highlighted significant similarities at convergence by iteration 4 with the S. cerevisiae Nej1 (E-value = 2 × 10–29) but also with two other yeast species (Candida albicans (E-value = 8 × 10–62) and D. hansenii (E-value = 9 × 10–76) (“Nej1” sequences in Fig. 2, blue and green boxes). Surprisingly, the D. hansenii Nej1 sequence highlighted here (GenBank™ identifier 49657009) was identical to the D. hansenii Cernunnos sequence identified above, making this yeast species the critical intermediate sequence that reveals the Nej1/Cernunnos relationship (green box in Fig. 2). Indeed, no significant, or marginal, similarities could be directly detected between Nej1 and the human Cernunnos sequence.Altogether this analysis indicated that Cernunnos is one homolog of Nej1 and that both proteins belong to an extended XRCC4 family. The great variability of the Cernunnos/Nej1 sequences among species is reminiscent of that of the XRCC4 sequences, and we show that they are structurally related. Indeed, the yeast XRCC4 homolog, Lif1, shares very low sequence similarity with human XRCC4, which cannot be detected using PSI-BLAST. Regarding this observation, one can hypothesize that the Cernunnos/XRCC4 couple has evolved jointly and has led to similarly highly divergent sequences in human and yeast. This concerted evolution, together with the more pronounced conservation of the dimerization regions (the “head” regions) might reflect the physical interaction of the two proteins, which has been demonstrated for Nej1/Lif1.Conclusion—We demonstrate here that the newly identified DNA repair factor, Cernunnos, interacts with the XRCC4·DNA-ligase IV complex, is the mammalian homolog of the yeast Nej1 factor, and that both belong to an extended XRCC4 family. These findings have several important implications. As we discussed above, the similarity between XRCC4 and Cernunnos raises the question of the true nature of the XRCC4·Cernunnos·DNA-ligase IV complex. Do both proteins always participate in the same complex? What are the rules governing their combinatorial association? What is the exact specific role that both factors play during the catalysis of DNA end joining? Analyzing mutations identified in patients is often of great help to describe an important region of a protein but sometimes can be misleading in case of hypomorphic mutations. Indeed, although the 2BN cells appear to harbor the more drastic mutation (a frameshift at the fifth amino acid) (15Ahnesorg P. Smith P. Jackson S.P. Cell. 2006; 124: 301-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar), the clinical presentation appears somehow less severe than the other described Cernunnos mutants (7Buck D. Malivert L. de Chasseval R. Barraud A. Fondanèche M.C. Sanal O. Plebani A. Stéphan J.L. Hufnagel M. Deist F. Le Fischer A. Durandy A. de Villartay J.P. Revy P.

Oettinger M.A. Jeggo P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2462-2467Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In particular, the 2BN patient did not present with microcephaly. This strongly suggests that 2BN harbors a hypomorphic Cernunnos mutation through the translation reinitiation on a downstream methionine as proposed (15Ahnesorg P. Smith P. Jackson S.P. Cell. 2006; 124: 301-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). A very similar situation has been described in the case of a particular mutation in the Rag1 gene, which in theory should lead to a T-B-SCID condition but, instead, appears as leaky, leading to the development of lymphocytes to some extent (24Noordzij J.G.

These levels are significantly higher than those currently observed for globular domains of proteins (26George R.A. Lin K. Heringa J.

Recent studies suggest that the beneficial effects of fish oil are due, in part, to the generation of various free radical-generated non-enzymatic bioactive oxidation products from ω-3 PUFAs, although the specific molecular species responsible for these effects have not been identified. Our research group has previously reported that pro-inflammatory prostaglandin F2-like compounds, termed F2-isoprostanes (IsoPs), are produced in vivo by the free radical-catalyzed peroxidation of arachidonic acid and represent one of the major products resulting from the oxidation of this PUFA. Based on these observations, we questioned whether F2-IsoP-like compounds (F3-IsoPs) are formed from the oxidation of EPA in vivo. Oxidation of EPA in vitro yielded a series of compounds that were structurally established to be F3-IsoPs using a number of chemical and mass spectrometric approaches. The amounts formed were extremely large (up to 8.7 + 1.0 μg/mg EPA) and greater than levels of F2-IsoPs generated from arachidonic acid. We then examined the formation of F3-IsoPs in vivo in mice. Levels of F3-IsoPs in tissues such as heart are virtually undetectable at baseline, but supplementation of animals with EPA markedly increases quantities up to 27.4 + 5.6 ng/g of heart. Interestingly, EPA supplementation also markedly reduced levels of pro-inflammatory arachidonate-derived F2-IsoPs by up to 64% (p < 0.05). Our studies provide the first evidence that identify F3-IsoPs as novel oxidation products of EPA that are generated in vivo. Further understanding of the biological consequences of F3-IsoP formation may provide valuable insights into the cardioprotective mechanism of EPA.

Formation of these compounds proceeds through the generation of bicyclic endoperoxide PGH2-like intermediates that are reduced to PGF2-like compounds termed F2-IsoPs (1Morrow J.D. Hill K.E. Burk R.F.

Unlike cyclooxygenase-derived PGs, IsoPs are formed in situ esterified to phospholipids and are subsequently released, presumably by the action of a phospholipase A2 (4Morrow J.D. Awad J.A. Boss H.J.

Quantification of F2-IsoPs has been shown to be one of the most reliable markers to assess oxidant stress status and lipid peroxidation in vivo (5Morrow J.D. Roberts II, L.J. Methods Mol.

Med. 2000; 28: 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). In addition, F2-IsoPs have been shown to exert potent vasoconstrictive activities in the vasculature (8Kromer B.M. Tippins J.R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 119: 1276-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 9Cracowski J.L. Stanke-Labesque F. Devillier P. Chavanon O. Hunt M. Souvignet C. Bessard G. Eur. J.

The other important PUFA in fish oil is docosahexaenoic acid (C22:6 ω-3; DHA). Studies in animals as well as human epidemiological studies, and more recently, clinical intervention trials, suggest that fish consumption or dietary fish oil supplementation reduces the incidence of important diseases including atherosclerosis and sudden death, neurodegeneration, and various inflammatory disorders (12Kris-Etherton P.M. Harris W.S. Appel L.J. Circulation. 2002; 106: 2747-2757Crossref PubMed Scopus (2918) Google Scholar, 13Ruxton C. Nurs. Stand. 2004; 18: 38-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The mechanism(s) by which these beneficial effects occurs is unknown, but it has been hypothesized that various enzymatically and non-enzymatically generated peroxidation products of EPA possess anti-inflammatory activities (14Hong S.

Previously, Änggård and colleagues (20Nourooz-Zadeh J. Halliwell B. Änggård E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 467-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) provided limited evidence that F-ring IsoP-like compounds (F3-IsoPs) can be formed from the oxidation of EPA in vitro. These compounds are termed F3-IsoPs because they are structurally analogous to F2-IsoPs yet contain three double bonds. We therefore considered the possibility that IsoP-like compounds could be formed by the free radical-induced peroxidation of EPA in vivo. The rationale for undertaking these studies, in part, was based on the hypothesis that F3-IsoPs contribute to the beneficial biological effects of EPA and fish oil supplementation in that they may exert biological activities that are anti-inflammatory as compared with F2-IsoPs. Indeed, one report states that the EPA-derived IsoP, 15-F3t-IsoP, possesses activity that is different from 15-F2t-IsoP in that it does not affect human platelet shape change or aggregation (21Pratico D. Smyth E.M. Violi F. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14916-14924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). 15-F2t-IsoP is a ligand for the thromboxane receptor and induces platelet shape change and also causes vasoconstriction (1Morrow J.D. Hill K.E. Burk R.F. Nammour T.M. Badr K.F. Roberts II, L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9383-9387Crossref PubMed Scopus (1723) Google Scholar, 22Morrow J.D. Minton T.A. Roberts I.I. Prostaglandins. 1992; 44: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The lack of activity of 15-F3t-IsoP is consistent with observations regarding EPA-derived PGs in that these latter compounds exert either weaker agonist effects or no effects in comparison with arachidonate-derived PGs (12Kris-Etherton P.M. Harris W.S. Appel L.J. Circulation. 2002; 106: 2747-2757Crossref PubMed Scopus (2918) Google Scholar, 23Balapure A.K. Rexroad J. Kawada K. Watt D.S. Fitz T.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1989; 38: 2375-2381Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 24Kulkarni P.S. Srinivasan B.D. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1985; 26: 1178-1182PubMed Google Scholar). Based on studies of arachidonic acid oxidation, the mechanism by which F3-IsoPs could be formed is outlined in Fig. 1. There are four bis-allylic positions in EPA at carbons 7, 10, 13, and 16 as opposed to three bis-allylic positions in arachidonate where hydrogen abstraction can occur. Depending on the position of hydrogen abstraction and oxygen insertion, eight hydroperoxides are formed. These eight hydroperoxides subsequently generate six F3-IsoP regioisomers. Each regioisomer is theoretically comprised of eight racemic diastereomers for a total of 96 compounds. A nomenclature system for the IsoPs has been established and approved by the Eicosanoid Nomenclature Committee in which the different regioisomer classes are designated by the carbon number on which the side chain hydroxyl is located with the carboxyl carbon designated as C-1 (25Taber D.F. Morrow J.D. Roberts II, L.J. Prostaglandins. 1997; 53: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Thus, in accordance with this nomenclature system, the F3-IsoP regioisomers are designated as 5-, 8-, 11-, 12-, 15-, and 18-series F3-IsoPs. Herein, we present evidence that F3-IsoPs are, in fact, formed in significant amounts in vitro and in vivo from the free radical-catalyzed peroxidation of EPA. Materials—Eicosapentaenoic acid and d4-15-F2t-IsoP (8-iso-PGF2α) were purchased from Cayman Chemical Co. (Ann Arbor, MI). Dimethylformamide and undecane were obtained from Aldrich. Pentafluorobenzyl bromide and diisopropylethylamine were from Sigma. 2,2′-Azobis(2-amidinopropane) hydrochloride (AAPH) was from Eastman Kodak Co. N,O-bis (trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide was from Supelco (Bellefonte, PA). [2H9]N,O-bis (trimethylsilyl) acetamide was from CDN Isotopes (Pointe-Claire, PQ). C-18 and silica Sep-Pak cartridges were from Waters Associates (Milford, MA). 60ALK6D TLC plates were from Whatman (Maidstone, UK). Oxidation of EPA—Five milligram of fresh EPA was dissolved in 100 μl of ethanol and added immediately to 4.9 ml of phosphate-buffered saline solution (pH 7.4) containing 10 mm AAPH. The EPA oxidation reaction mixture was incubated in a shaking water bath at 37 °C for varying amounts of time, after which it was placed immediately at –80 °C until further processing. Purification and Analysis of F3-IsoPs—Free and esterified F3-IsoPs were extracted using C-18 and Silica Sep-Pak cartridges, converted to a pentafluorobenzyl ester, purified by TLC, converted to a trimethylsilyl ether derivative, and quantified by stable isotope dilution gas chromatography (GC)/negative ion chemical ionization (NICI) mass spectrometry (MS) with d4-15-F2t-IsoP as an internal standard using a modification of the method described for the quantification of F2-IsoPs (26Morrow J.D. Roberts II, L.J. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 300: 3-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Instead of scraping 1 cm below to 1 cm above where PGF2α methyl ester migrates on TLC for analysis of F2-IsoPs, the scraped area was extended to 3.5 cm above where the PGF2α methyl ester migrates. This extended area of the TLC plate was determined to contain F3-IsoPs by analyzing small 5-mm cuts using approaches for their identification described below. The M−·CH2C6F5 ions were monitored for quantification (m/z 567 for F3-IsoPs and m/z 573 for d4-15-F2t-IsoP). Quantification of the total amount of F3-IsoPs was determined by integrating the peak area of material in the m/z 567 channel in comparison with the m/z 573 channel. GC/NICI/MS was carried out using an Agilent Technologies 6890N Network GC/MS system. Sample work using this method does not lead to the generation of F3-IsoPs during purification and derivatization. In some studies, F2-IsoPs were quantified as described previously (5Morrow J.D. Roberts II, L.J. Methods Mol. Biol. 2002; 186: 57-66PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of F3-IsoPs by Liquid Chromatography (LC)/Electrospray Ionization (ESI)/MS/MS—F3-IsoPs generated by the in vitro and in vivo oxidation of EPA were extracted by C-18 and Silica Sep-Pak cartridge as described above. The samples were then analyzed by negative ion ESI-MS coupled with reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography separation using a Supelco Discovery C18 column (15 cm × 2.1 mm, 5 μm) at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min with a linear gradient starting with 80% solvent A (2 mm ammonium acetate) to 65% in 20 min. Mobile phase B consisted of acetonitrile/methanol (95:5). The ESI source was fitted with a deactivated fused silica capillary (100 μm inner diameter). Nitrogen was used as both the sheath gas and the auxiliary gas, at 45 and 17 p.s.i., respectively. The capillary temperature was 280 °C. The spray voltage was 4.3 kV, and the tube lens voltage was 80 V. Collision-induced dissociation (CID) of the molecular ion of putative F3-IsoPs was performed from 20 to 30 eV under 1.5 millitorrs of argon. Spectra that are shown were obtained at 25 eV. Spectra were displayed by averaging scans across chromatographic peaks. Selective reaction monitoring (SRM) was performed according to characteristic fragmentation patterns of F2-IsoPs (27Waugh R.J. Morrow J.D. Roberts II, L.J. Murphy R.C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1997; 23: 943-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The collision energy for SRM was 30 eV. LC/MS was carried out using a ThermoFinnigan TSQ Quantum 1.0 SR 1 mass spectrometer. Data acquisition and analysis were performed using Xcaliber software, version 1.3. Preparation of F3-IsoPs from Rodent Tissue—Mice (strain C57BL/6J(B6)) were fed with a rodent AIN-93 diet supplemented with 0, 0.28, 0.56, or 0.84% EPA (by weight). In some studies, animals were administered CCl4 (1 ml/kg) intraperitoneally to induce an oxidant stress. After 8 weeks of feeding, the mice were sacrificed. Heart and other tissues were removed and immediately flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored in –80 °C. Analyzed tissue samples were homogenized in 5 ml of ice-cold chloroform:methanol (2:1, v/v) containing butylated hydroxytoluene (0.005%) to prevent ex vivo auto-oxidation. Esterified F3-IsoPs in phospholipids were hydrolyzed to liberate free F3-IsoPs. As noted previously (28Roberts II, L.J. Montine T.J. Markesbery W.R. Tapper A.R. Hardy P. Chemtob S. Dettbarn W.D. Morrow J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13605-13612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), the addition of various PUFAs including arachidonic acid, EPA, or DHA to tissues during workup does not increase the levels of isoprostane-like compounds in tissue extracts. F3-IsoPs in samples were then purified and analyzed as described above. F2-IsoPs were quantified as described previously (5Morrow J.D. Roberts II, L.J. Methods Mol. Biol. 2002; 186: 57-66PubMed Google Scholar). Fatty acid content in tissues was determined by GC (29Morrison W.R. Smith L.M. J. Lipid Res. 1964; 53: 600-608Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). For some studies, male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a rodent AIN-93 diet supplemented with 0.56% EPA. After 8 weeks of feeding, the rats were sacrificed. F3-IsoPs in liver tissues were analyzed by LC/ESI/MS/MS as described above. Formation of F3-IsoPs in Vitro—A representative selective ion monitoring chromatogram obtained from the AAPH-induced oxidation of EPA in vitro is shown in Fig. 2. The chromatographic peak in the lower m/z 573 ion current chromatogram represents the internal standard d4-15-F2t-IsoP. In the upper m/z 567 ion current chromatogram are a series of chromatographic peaks eluting over approximately a 1-min interval. These compounds possess a molecular mass predicted for F3-IsoPs. In addition, these compounds elute at later retention times than the deuterated 15-F2t-IsoP internal standard; it would be predicted that the retention time of F3-IsoPs on GC should be longer than that of F2-IsoPs because F3-IsoPs contain one more double bond. Furthermore, it should be noted that the retention times over which the F3-IsoPs elute may differ somewhat in the different figures because these analyses were performed on different days using different columns that vary somewhat in length. Additional experimental approaches were then performed to provide further evidence that the compounds represented by the chromatographic peaks in the m/z 567 ion current chromatogram are F3-IsoPs. The m/z 566 ion current chromatogram contained no chromatographic peaks, indicating that the peaks in the 567 chromatogram are not natural isotope peaks of compounds generating an ion of less than 567. Analysis of putative F3-IsoPs as [2H9]trimethylsilyl ether derivatives resulted in a shift of the m/z 567 chromatographic peaks up 27 Da to m/z 594, indicating the presence of three hydroxyl groups (Fig. 3). Analysis of the putative F3-IsoPs following catalytic hydrogenation is shown in Fig. 4. Prior to hydrogenation, there were no chromatographic peaks present 6 Da above m/z 567 in the m/z 573 ion current chromatogram (Fig. 4A). However, following hydrogenation, intense chromatographic peaks appeared at m/z 573 with the loss of the chromatographic peaks at m/z 567 (Fig. 4B), indicating the presence of three double bonds. Collectively, these data indicate that the compounds represented by the chromatographic peaks in the m/z 567 ion current chromatogram have the functional groups and the number of double bonds predicted for the F3-IsoPs.FIGURE 4Analysis of putative F3-IsoPs before and after catalytic hydrogenation. Compounds are analyzed as pentafluorobenzyl ester, trimethylsilyl ether derivatives. In the absence of hydrogenation, intense peaks are present in the m/z 567 ion current chromatogram (A) representing F3-IsoPs. There are no peaks present 6 atomic mass units higher at m/z 573. Following catalytic hydrogenation, intense peaks appear at m/z 573 (B), indicating that the m/z 567 compounds have three double bonds.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Analysis of F3-IsoPs by LC/ESI/MS/MS—To provide direct evidence that the compounds analyzed by selective ion monitoring MS were F3-IsoPs, LC/ESI/MS/MS in the negative ion mode was employed. The predicted [parent molecule, H]– ion, hereafter referred to as “M–,” for F3-IsoPs is at m/z 351. Direct structural characterization of F3-IsoP regioisomers was obtained utilizing CID. The selective ion monitoring chromatogram of the ion at m/z 351 from this analysis is shown in Fig. 5A. As is evident, multiple chromatographic peaks are present that presumably represent different F3-IsoP stereo-isomers. All of the chromatographic peaks in Fig. 5A were analyzed by CID, and fragmentation patterns were consistent with various F3-IsoP isomers. As a representative sample, the composite CID spectrums at three retention times, including RT 7.82, 11.90, and 16.22 min, are shown in Fig. 5, B–D. CID of the ion at m/z 351 resulted in the formation of a number of relevant daughter ions that would be predicted to be common to all of the F3-IsoP regioisomers, including m/z 315 [M − 2H2O]–, m/z 307 [M − CO2]–, m/z 289 [M − H2O − CO2]–, m/z 271 [M − 2H2O − CO2]–, and m/z 245 [M − H2O − 2CO2]–. Other prominent daughter ions were present that might result from fragmentation of specific F3-IsoP regioisomers. On the basis of our previous work and studies by other groups (27Waugh R.J. Morrow J.D. Roberts II, L.J. Murphy R.C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1997; 23: 943-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 30Kerwin J.L. Torvik J.J. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 237: 56-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 31Kerwin J.L. Wiens A.M. Ericsson L.H. J. Mass Spectrom. 1996; 31: 184-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), these ions can be potentially explained as follows. In Fig. 5B (RT 7.82 min), they include m/z 233 [M − CH2 = C(OH)CH2CH3 − CH3CH2OH]– and m/z 231 [M − CHO CH2CH3 − H2O − CO2]– (18-series), m/z 213 [M − CHOCH2CH = CHCH2CH = CHCH2CH3] and m/z 151 [M − CHOCH2CH = CHCH2CH = CHCH2CH3 − H2O − CO2]– (12-series), m/z 191 [M − CHOCH2CH = CHCH2CH3 − H2O − CO2]– (15-series), and m/z 167 CH3CH = CHCH2CH = CH(CH2)3COO– (11-series). These data suggest that the mass spectrum shown in Fig. 5B represents a mixture of a number of the F3-IsoP regioisomers (11-, 12-, 15-, and 18-series) that would be predicted to be formed. In Fig. 5C (RT 11.90 min), the prominent daughter ion is m/z 127, which is the characteristic fragment of 8-series −CH3CH = CH(CH2)3COO–. In Fig. 5D (RT 16.22 min), the major ion m/z 115 is the characteristic fragment of 5-series, which is CHO(CH2)3COO–. Taken together, these data provide direct evidence for the formation of a series of F3-IsoPs generated from the peroxidation of EPA. The above results utilizing CID were confirmed utilizing SRM. The major unique identifying fragments of EPA-derived F3-IsoP regioisomers predicted to be generated in SRM are shown in Fig. 6. They result primarily from cleavage either α to hydroxyl groups or across double bonds. The SRM chromatograms of putative F3-IsoP regioisomers resulting from the in vitro oxidation of EPA are shown in Fig. 7A. The peaks appearing from 7 to 20 min are putative F3-IsoPs. All six series of F3-IsoP regioisomeric characteristic fragments are detected, suggesting that all of these regioisomers are formed from in vitro oxidation of EPA. In addition, a number of F3-IsoP regioisomers, including 12-, 11-, 15-, and 18-series, elute at RT 7.8 min as denoted in the CID analysis above. However, the chromatographic peaks at RT 11.90 and 16.22 min are primarily comprised of 8- and 5-series regioisomers, respectively. Also of note, overall, the 5- and 18-series of F3-IsoP regioisomers are relatively more abundant than the other regioisomers.FIGURE 7SRM analysis of putative F3-IsoPs obtained from AAPH-induced oxidation of EPA. A, in vitro; B, from rat livers after 8 weeks of EPA supplementation (0.56%). Please refer to Fig. 6 for specific ions being monitored for different F3-IsoP regioisomers.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Time Course of Formation of F3-IsoP in Vitro—Having provided significant evidence for the formation of F3-IsoPs in vitro, we next examined the time course of their formation. For those studies, EPA was again oxidized using AAPH. The results are shown in Fig. 8. As is evident, levels of F3-IsoPs increased dramatically in a time-dependent manner to a maximum of 8722.7 ± 1010.5 ng/mg of EPA from baseline levels of 29.0 ± 3.7 ng/mg of EPA (n = 6). Levels of F3-IsoPs exceeded those of F2-IsoPs by up to an order of magnitude. Formation of F3-IsoPs in Vivo—We then undertook experiments to determine whether F3-IsoPs are formed in vivo. Levels of EPA in tissues from animals and humans are extremely low at baseline, and F3-IsoP levels are below limits of detection (<30 pg/g of tissue). Thus, to determine whether these compounds are generated in vivo, we supplemented rodents with diets containing EPA (0.84% by weight) for 8 weeks. Subsequently, animals were sacrificed, and tissue lipids were extracted and analyzed for F3-IsoPs. In one set of studies, levels of F3-IsoPs were quantified in hearts from mice supplemented with EPA. Heart tissue was examined because supplementation of animals and humans with fish oil markedly increases levels of EPA in this organ. In addition, fish oil supplementation is associated with a marked decrease in cardiovascular disease. A representative GC/MS ion current chromatogram obtained from one of these analyses is shown in Fig. 9. The chromatographic peak in the lower m/z 573 ion current chromatogram represents the internal standard d4-15-F2t-IsoP. In the upper m/z 567 ion current chromatogram are a series of chromatographic peaks that have a molecular mass and retention times expected for the F3-IsoPs. The pattern of peaks representing F3-IsoPs is very similar to that obtained from the oxidation of EPA in vitro. In addition, as predicted, these compounds were found to contain three hydroxyl groups and three double bonds. Analogous to LC/ESI/MS/MS studies performed in vitro, experiments were then carried out to obtain further evidence that the chromatographic peaks in the m/z 567 ion current chromatogram of Fig. 9 represent F3-IsoPs formed in vivo. For these studies, liver tissue from rats fed a diet supplemented with 0.56% EPA was utilized to obtain adequate amounts of F3-IsoPs for analysis by LC/MS. In CID experiments, all of daughter ions that would be predicted to be common to all of the F3-IsoP regioisomers, including m/z 333 [M − H2O]–, m/z 307 [M − CO2]–, m/z 289 [M − H2O − CO2]–, m/z 271 [M − 2H2O − CO2]–, and m/z 245 [M − H2O − 2CO2]–, were detected. In addition, all 6-series regioisomeric characteristic fragments were formed in both CID (data not shown) and SRM experiments (Fig. 7B). As is evident in Fig. 7B, the relative abundance of different regioisomers in vivo is similar to in vitro studies. Taken together, these experiments provide evidence that F3-IsoPs are formed in abundance in vivo and that the regioisomeric distribution is similar to that observed in vitro. We performed studies to examine the effect of different concentrations of EPA on the generation of F3-IsoPs in vivo. Mice were administered 0, 0.28, 0.56, or 0.84% EPA (by weight) in their diets for 8 weeks, and levels of EPA and F3-IsoPs were measured in heart tissue. As shown in Fig. 10, A and B, as the EPA concentration in heart tissues increases, levels of F3-IsoPs increase in a concentration-dependent manner. In addition, we also quantified the effect of EPA supplementation on arachidonate content and F2-IsoP levels in the same heart tissue. Interestingly, supplementation with EPA decreased arachidonate content (Fig. 10C). Importantly, in addition, levels of F2-IsoPs decreased dramatically by up to 64% (p < 0.05) (Fig. 10D), suggesting that EPA effectively decreases levels of proinflammatory F2-IsoPs formed from arachidonate. Finally, we also determined the effect of enhanced oxidant stress on endogenous F3-IsoPs in EPA-supplemented (0.56%) mice. Levels of these compounds increased from 86.27 ± 11.01 ng/g of tissue to 311.5 ± 60.79 ng/g of tissue in livers after administration of CCl4 to induce an oxidant stress. Our studies have elucidated a novel class of F2-IsoP-like compounds, F3-IsoPs, formed in vivo from the free radical-induced peroxidation of EPA. Previous studies byÄnggård and colleagues (20Nourooz-Zadeh J. Halliwell B. Änggård E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 467-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) have described the formation of F3-IsoPs in vitro, although little structural information was provided, and it was not determined whether these compounds could be generated in vivo (5Morrow J.D. Roberts II, L.J. Methods Mol. Biol. 2002; 186: 57-66PubMed Google Scholar). Levels of compounds generated significantly exceed those of F2-IsoPs derived from arachidonate, perhaps because EPA contains more double bonds and is more easily oxidized. The present studies describe the formation of F-type prostane ring-containing molecules. Free radical-induced peroxidation of arachidonate results not only in the formation of F-ring IsoPs but also E/D-ring IsoPs, A/J-ring IsoPs, and thromboxane-like molecules (isothromboxanes) (3Morrow J.D. Awad J.A. Wu A. Zackert W.E. Daniel V.C. Roberts II, L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23185-23190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 32Morrow J.D. Roberts L.J. Prog. Lipid Res. 1997; 36: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Thus, although it remains the subject of future studies, it is likely that analogous compounds, in addition to F3-IsoPs, are also formed of products of the non-enzymatic peroxidation of EPA. A major impetus for undertaking the present studies regarding EPA oxidation has been the fact that supplementation of humans with fish oil containing large amounts of EPA and DHA has been shown beneficial in the prevention of important human diseases such as atherosclerosis and sudden death, neurodegeneration, and various inflammatory disorders (12Kris-Etherton P.M. Harris W.S. Appel L.J. Circulation. 2002; 106: 2747-2757Crossref PubMed Scopus (2918) Google Scholar, 13Ruxton C. Nurs. Stand. 2004; 18: 38-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism(s) by which these beneficial effects occurs is unknown, a potentially important anti-atherogenic and anti-inflammatory mechanism of ω-3 PUFAs is their interference with the arachidonic acid cascade that generates pro-inflammatory eicosanoids (12Kris-Etherton P.M. Harris W.S. Appel L.J. Circulation. 2002; 106: 2747-2757Crossref PubMed Scopus (2918) Google Scholar, 33Uauy R. Mena P. Valenzuela A. Eur. J. Clin. Nutr. 1999; 53: S66-S77Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). EPA not only can replace arachidonic acid in phospholipid bilayers but is also a competitive inhibitor of cyclooxygenase, reducing the production of 2-series PGs and thromboxane, in addition to the 4-series leukotrienes. As noted, the 3- and 5-series eicosanoids (respectively) derived from EPA are either less biologically active or inactive as compared with the former products and are thus considered to exert effects that are less inflammatory (34Calder P.C. Lipids. 2001; 36: 1007-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar, 35Yang P. Chan D. Felix E. Cartwright C. Menter D.G. Madden T. Klein R.D. Fischer S.M. Newman R.A. J.

Med. 2002; 196: 1025-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar) have described a group of polyoxygenated DHA and EPA derivatives termed resolvins that are produced in various tissues. These compounds inhibit cytokine expression and other inflammatory responses in microglia, skin cells, and other cell types. Recently, there has been significant interest in the biological activities of non-enzymatic free radical-initiated peroxidation products of ω-3 PUFAs. Sethi et al. (18Sethi S. Eastman A.Y. Eaton J.W. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1996; 128: 27-38Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 19Sethi S. Redox. Rep. 2002; 7: 369-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) reported that EPA oxidized in the presence of Cu2+, but not native EPA, significantly inhibits human neutrophil and monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells, a process linked to the development of atherosclerosis and other inflammatory disorders. This effect was induced via inhibition of endothelial adhesion receptor expression and was modulated by the activation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α by EPA oxidation products. In addition, oxidized EPA markedly reduced leukocyte rolling and adhesion to venular endothelium of lipopolysaccharide-treated mice in vivo, and the effect was not observed in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α-deficient mice. These studies suggest that the beneficial effects of ω-3 fatty acids may be mediated, in part, by the anti-inflammatory effects of oxidized EPA. Similarly, Vallve et al. (36Vallve J.C. Uliaque K. Girona J. Cabre A. Ribalta J. Heras M. Masana L. Atherosclerosis. 2002; 164: 45-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) have shown that various non-enzymatically generated aldehyde oxidation products of EPA and DHA decrease the expression of the CD36 receptor in human macrophages. Up-regulation of this receptor has been linked to atherosclerosis. Additional recent reports have suggested that other related biological effects of EPA and DHA, such as modulation of endothelial inflammatory molecules, are related to their peroxidation products (18Sethi S. Eastman A.Y. Eaton J.W. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1996; 128: 27-38Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 37Das U.N. Prostaglandins Leukotrienes Essent. Fatty Acids. 1999; 61: 157-163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Arita et al. (38Arita K. Yamamoto Y. Takehara Y. Utsumi T. Kanno T. Miyaguchi C. Akiyama J. Yoshioka T. Utsumi K. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 35: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) have also shown that non-enzymatically oxidized EPA enhances apoptosis in HL-60 leukemia cells, supporting the contention that oxidized ω-3 PUFAs are both anti-proliferative and anti-inflammatory. Similar findings have been reported in HepG2 (human hepatoma) cells and AH109A (rat liver cancer) cells (39Kiserud C.E. Kierulf P. Hostmark A.T. Thromb. Res. 1995; 80: 75-83Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 40Kokura S. Nakagawa S. Hara T. Boku Y. Naito Y. Yoshida N. Yoshikawa T. Cancer Lett. 2002; 185: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In virtually none of these reports, however, have the specific peroxidation products responsible for these effects been structurally identified. Further studies to characterize these molecules are needed. Thus, a rationale for undertaking these studies was based on the hypothesis that F3-IsoPs are formed from the peroxidation of EPA and contribute to the beneficial biological effects of EPA and fish oil supplementation in that they exert biological activities that are anti-inflammatory. Studies assessing the biological activity of 15-F3t-IsoP could test this important hypothesis but will have to await the chemical synthesis of the molecule. The studies reported herein have begun to systematically define the oxidation of EPA in vivo and in vitro for the first time. F3-IsoPs were identified using a variety of complementary chemical and MS approaches, including LC/ESI/MS/MS. As expected, 6-series of F3-IsoP regioisomers were identified from both in vitro and in vivo sources. The fragmentation patterns of these regioisomers are similar to F2-IsoP regioisomers, and indeed, information that we have previously acquired with F2-IsoPs was extremely useful in the present studies (27Waugh R.J. Morrow J.D. Roberts II, L.J. Murphy R.C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1997; 23: 943-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Of note, the relative abundance of 5- and 18-series F3-IsoPs predominates over the other series. Such regioisomeric predominance has also been reported for F2-IsoP regioisomers in which 5- and 15-series compounds are formed in greater abundance than 8- and 12-series molecules (27Waugh R.J. Morrow J.D. Roberts II, L.J. Murphy R.C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1997; 23: 943-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). At least part of the reason for this is likely due to the fact that precursors of 8- and 12-series F2-IsoPs can undergo further oxidation and cyclization to yield a novel class of compounds termed dioxolane endoperoxides (41Yin H. Morrow J.D. Porter N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3766-3776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Although undetermined at present, it is likely that a similar mechanism may account for the predominance of 5- and 18-series F3-IsoPs. Another interesting finding from the above studies relates to the observation that EPA reduces the formation of F2-IsoPs in vivo. As mentioned, F2-IsoPs are generally considered to be pro-inflammatory molecules and have been implicated in the pathophysiological consequences of oxidative stress. It is thus intriguing to propose that part of the mechanism by which EPA prevents certain diseases associated with increased inflammation relates to its ability to decrease F2-IsoP generation. In summary, we report the discovery that F-ring IsoP-like compounds, termed F3-IsoPs, are formed in vivo in large amounts as products of the non-enzymatic free radical-catalyzed peroxidation of EPA, a major long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid in fish oil. Further understanding of the biological consequences of the formation of these novel compounds and factors influencing their formation and metabolism may provide valuable insights into the role of EPA in human physiology and pathophysiology."
https://openalex.org/W2005505016,"In the study we report here, we tested the hypothesis that insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 2 (IGFBP2) promotes cell mobility through its interaction with integrin α5. Our previous microarray studies showed that IGFBP2 activates the expression of integrin α5. In addition, IGFBP2 has an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) domain, which is a known integrin binding motif. We first confirmed our microarray results by showing that the expression of integrin α5 is indeed up-regulated at the protein level in IGFBP2-overexpressing SNB19 glioma cells. Using co-immunoprecipitation, we confirmed that IGFBP2 does interact with integrin α5. To confirm that IGFBP2 interacts directly with integrin α5 through the RGD domain, we created an RGD → RGE mutant (D306E) IGFBP2 and stably overexpressed the mutant IGFBP2 in the same cell line. Co-immunoprecipitation then showed that D306E-IGFBP2 had no detectable binding with integrin α5. We further observed that IGFBP2-overexpressing cells have extensive cell surface lamellipodia, whereas D306E-IGFBP2-overexpressing cells show abundant cell surface focal adhesions. Consistent with this, phenotype analysis then showed that IGFBP2-overexpressing cells have elevated migration rates compared with vector control; in contrast, the migration rates of the D306E-IGFBP2-overexpressing cells were not elevated and were comparable with that of vector control. Decreased expression of integrin α5 by small interference RNA in IGFBP2-overexpressing cells also reduced cell mobility. Therefore, we have concluded that one mechanism by which IGFBP2 activates IGFBP2-induced cell mobility is through its interaction with integrin α5 and this interaction is specifically mediated through the RGD domain on IGFBP2.

Therefore, we have concluded that one mechanism by which IGFBP2 activates IGFBP2-induced cell mobility is through its interaction with integrin α5 and this interaction is specifically mediated through the RGD domain on IGFBP2. Cell migration is a highly regulated biological process and is associated with normal tissue modeling during early development. In most adult tissues, cell mobility is normally decreased but becomes highly active in cases of pathologic neoplasms, especially in advanced stages. This plus the increased production of basement membrane digestive enzymes are two key aspects of cancer invasion. Both are necessary for a cancer cell to successfully invade outside its original confines. With respect to cell mobility, cell surface receptors, such as integrins, must interact with the extracellular matrix in order for a cell to move. Participation of integrins in cell invasion has been shown to be critical in a wide variety of cancers (1Zheng D.Q. Woodward A.S. Fornarno M. Tallini G. Languino L.R. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1655-1664PubMed Google Scholar, 2Chung J. Bachelder R.E. Lipscomb E.A. Shaw L.M. Mercurio A.M. J.

Oncol. 2003; 90: 248-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Once a signal is transmitted to the integrin receptor, a host of intracellular proteins are then activated and begin transmission of cascades of signals inside the cell. Aside from ligand binding, proteins are also able to interact with the integrin receptor inside the cell to modulate signaling and/or receptor affinity status, a process previously referred to as “inside-out” signaling (6O'Toole T.E. Katagiri Y. Faull R.J. Peter K. Tamura R. Quaranta V. Loftus J.C. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 1047-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). Eventually, certain intracellular protein signals are turned on (e.g. small molecule GTPases), enabling cells to increase their mobility. These proteins produce cytoskeletal rearrangements, such as stress fiber and membrane ruffle formation, that are conducive to cell movement. Here, we are specifically interested in IGFBP2-mediated mechanisms of cell mobility that contribute to invasiveness. Gliomas are the most common primary tumors of the central nervous system, accounting for 80% of adult primary brain tumors (7De Girolami U. Anthony D.C. Frosch M.P. Cotran R.S. Kumar V. Collins T. Robbins Pathologic Basis of Disease. Saunders, Philadelphia1999: 1293-1357Google Scholar). Patients with the most advanced stage of glioma, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), 2The abbreviations used are: GBM, glioblastoma multiforme; IGF, insulin-like growth factor; IGFBP2, IGF-binding protein 2; RGD, Arg-Gly-Asp domain; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; siRNA, small interference RNA; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate. face a very poor clinical outlook. By the time patients show clinical symptoms of GBM, they face a median survival of 8–10 months at the time of diagnosis. The characteristic that makes GBM so devastating and therapeutically intractable is its highly micro-invasive nature. Single-cell invasiveness typically renders GBM surgically incurable and results in significant neurological morbidity, with death being the outcome for most patients. Previous studies using cDNA microarray profiling, followed by tissue microarray validation, have identified insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 2 (IGFBP2) overexpression as one of the most frequent molecular events in GBM (8Fuller G.N.

Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 1652-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Subsequent functional studies showed that IGFBP2 promotes GBM invasion by activating the expression of a series of cell adhesion and cell mobility genes (13Wang H. Wang H. Shen W. Huang H. Hu L. Ramdas L. Zhou Y.H. Liao W.S. Fuller G.N. Zhang W. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 4315-4321PubMed Google Scholar). The specific signal transduction events through which IGFBP2 produces enhanced cell invasion remain unresolved. Although it is known that IGFBP2 activates the expression of matrix metalloprotease 2, which contributes to cell invasiveness by breaking down matrix, the mechanism by which IGFBP2 activates cell mobility remains unknown. Under normal physiological conditions, IGFBP2 is predominantly expressed in highly proliferative fetal tissues that exhibit extensive cell movement and tissue remodeling (14Green B.N. Jones S.B. Streck R.D. Wood T.L. Rotwein P. Pintar J.E. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 954-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Within the central nervous system, IGFBP2 is expressed in fetal glial cells, but after birth its expression significantly decreases (15Lee W.H. Michels K.M. Bondy C.A. Neuroscience. 1993; 53: 251-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). IGFBP2 is thus an important protein involved in cell movement during development. As is the case with many critical molecules in cancer biology, IGFBP2 has deviated from its normal role in the development of certain human cancers. In the present study, we seek to further elucidate the role of IGFBP2 in the context of cancer and also attempt to delineate a mechanism of IGFBP2 signal transduction that leads to glioma cell migration, a critical step in IGFBP2-induced cell invasion. We hypothesize that one mechanism by which IGFBP2 promotes cell mobility is through its interaction with integrins. We arrived at this hypothesis as a result of several observations. First, our previous microarray analyses of genes affected by IGFBP2 overexpression showed that IGFBP2 activates the expression of integrin α5. Second, a sequence analysis of the IGFBP2 protein revealed an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) domain (at codons 304–306), which is a well characterized integrin-binding domain (16Pierschnacher M.D. Ruoslahti E. Nature. 1984; 309: 30-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (2896) Google Scholar, 17Ruoslahti E. Pierschnacher M.D. Science. 1987; 238: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (3894) Google Scholar). Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 1 (IGFBP1) also contains an RGD domain in its protein sequence and has been shown to bind integrin (18Jones J.I. Gockerman A. Busby Jr., W.H. Wright G. Clemmons D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10553-10557Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). The IGFBP1-integrin interaction was further found to activate human trophoblast cell migration (19Gleeson L.M. Chakraborty C. McKinnon T. Lala P.K. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 86: 2484-2493Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Two groups have independently reported that IGFBP2 interacts with integrins in two different cell lines, breast (20Pereira J.J. Meyer T. Docherty S.E. Reid H.H. Marshall J. Thompson E.W. Rossjohn J. Price J.T. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 977-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and sarcoma (21Schutt B.S. Langkamp M. Rauschnabel U. Ranke M.B. Elmlinger M.W. Endocrinology. 2004; 32: 859-868Google Scholar); however, the effects of this interaction identified by the two groups were different. In breast cancer, it was found that IGFBP2 interacts with integrin αv and that this interaction reduced tumor cell migration (20Pereira J.J. Meyer T. Docherty S.E. Reid H.H. Marshall J. Thompson E.W. Rossjohn J. Price J.T. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 977-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In sarcoma, IGFBP2 was found to interact with integrin α5, and although no direct cell migration analysis was performed, the interaction promoted tumor cell de-adhesion (21Schutt B.S. Langkamp M. Rauschnabel U. Ranke M.B. Elmlinger M.W. Endocrinology. 2004; 32: 859-868Google Scholar), which is a characteristic consistent with increased cell mobility. Thus, IGFBP2 interacts with different integrin subunits in different cells and/or under different physiological conditions, affecting cell adhesion and mobility. In this study, we examined GBM cells, which are well recognized for overexpressing both IGFBP2 (2Chung J. Bachelder R.E. Lipscomb E.A. Shaw L.M. Mercurio A.M. J.

We show here that IGFBP2 interacts with integrin α5 through a specific binding domain on IGFBP2 and that this interaction is necessary for promoting IGFBP2-mediated cell motility. Cell Culture, Stable Transfection, and Mutagenesis—SNB19 human GBM cells overexpressing IGFBP2 had been previously transfected with a pcDNA3 expression vector encoding IGFBP2 cDNA and a neo-selectable marker using FuGENE6 reagent (Roche Diagnostics). A vector control cell line was also created by transfection of an empty pcDNA3 expression vector (13Wang H. Wang H. Shen W. Huang H. Hu L. Ramdas L. Zhou Y.H. Liao W.S. Fuller G.N. Zhang W. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 4315-4321PubMed Google Scholar). These cells have been maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. New SNB19 cells were transfected with a pcDNA3 expression vector encoding D306E-IGFBP2 cDNA and a neo-selectable marker using Nucleofector™ (Amaxa, Gaithersburg, MD) using Solution T and program T-20. Transfected cells were subsequently selected in the presence of G418 (1,750 μg/ml) to establish the IGFBP2-overexpressing stable clones. The expression levels of IGFBP2 in the SNB19 clones were determined by Western blot analyses of cell extracts using anti-IGFBP2 antibody (C-18; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). The mutation was introduced using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), with specifically designed mutagenic oligonucleotide primers used to generate the respective mutants. The primer sequence (5′-3′) used for the sense strand is as follows: Asp306 → Glu306 (RGE mutant) TGACACTCGGGTTCCCCCCGG. In addition to the protocol specified by Stratagene, we added dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) (3.5 μl of Me2SO/50-μl reaction) to the reaction mixture because of the high GC content of the IGFBP2 gene. Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Co-immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—For the co-immunoprecipitation done to check protein-protein interaction, briefly, cells were detached by manual scraping, collected by centrifugation, and lysed. Cell lysates underwent 1 h of preclearing incubation with agarose-conjugated goat immunoglobulin G (IgG AC; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4 °C. Precleared supernatants were then incubated with anti-IGFBP2 antibody and protein G-agarose at 4 °C overnight. Agarose beads were washed three times in cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), after which the precipitates were boiled for 5 min in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) loading buffer, loaded onto 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) gels, electroblotted, and immunoblotted with anti-integrin α5 antibody. Production of the IGFBP2 and D306E-IGFBP2 proteins was measured by Western blot. Briefly, cells were detached by manual scraping, collected by centrifugation, and lysed. Equal amounts of proteins were loaded, boiled for 5 min, resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, electroblotted onto Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences), blocked in 5% skim milk in PBS, and probed with the following primary antibodies: anti-IGFBP2 polyclonal antibody C-18 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-actin polyclonal antibody I-19 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-integrin α5 monoclonal antibody (BD Biosciences). Proteins were detected with an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) kit (Amersham Biosciences). GTPase Activity Assay—To confirm the presence of lamellipodia in IGFBP2-overexpressing cells, we performed a GTP molecule affinity pulldown assay to detect Rac1-GTP (active form of Rac1). In this experiment, cell lysates were incubated with PAK-1-agarose (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) for 1 h at 4 °C to pull down the GTP-bound molecules. Beads were spun down, collected, and washed three times with magnesium-containing lysis buffer provided by the manufacturer. Samples were boiled and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Rac1 was detected with an anti-Rac1 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology). To determine the total Rac1 input, a separate immunoblot was performed on identical lysate using the same anti-Rac antibody. Signals were quantified using image-analyzing software (Kodak 1D Image Analysis Software, Rochester, NY). The assay was performed three times. In Vitro Cell Migration and Wound-healing Assays—Cell migration rates were determined using a Boyden migration chamber, in this case 24-well Biocoat Control Insert chambers (BD Biosciences) with an 8-μm pore polycarbonate filter. The lower compartment contained either 0.5 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 medium with 2% fetal bovine serum as the chemoattractant or serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 medium as a control. In this assay, 2 × 104 cells/well were placed in triplicate wells in the upper compartments and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. After incubation, the cells that had passed through the filter into the lower wells were fixed, stained, and counted under a microscope. Assays were performed in triplicate. The differences in the cell migration rates between control and experimental cell lines were analyzed using a two-tailed Student's t-test. For the wound-healing assays (done to confirm the Boyden chamber findings), cells were grown in 6-well plates until they reached 100% confluence. A small linear scratch was introduced into the middle of the well using a small 10-μl pipette tip. Cells were allowed to continued growing at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. Cells were only removed from the incubator at designated time points (0, 6, 12, and 24 h) when pictures were taken under a microscope. Immunostaining—Cells were seeded onto fibronectin-coated glass slide chambers and incubated in the standard medium (as mentioned above) for 24 h. Cells were then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 10 min, permeabilized in 100% methanol for 30 min, incubated at –20 °C for 30 min, and blocked with blocking solution (PBS with 10% serum from the respective secondary antibody animal) for 1–4 h. Primary antibody (1:50) in blocking solution was added and the cells incubated overnight at 4 °C. After the cells were washed with PBS, secondary antibody (1:200) in blocking solution was added and the cells incubated at room temperature for 1 h. After the slides were washed with PBS, they were mounted with ProLong® Gold antifade reagent with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Molecular Probes) and covered with coverslips. The F-actin staining pattern was visualized with the phalloidin-TRITC stain, which indicates whether focal adhesion complexes, a feature of non-migrating cells, are present on the edges of the cell membrane. siRNA Knock Down of Integrin α5—Integrin α5 siRNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was transiently transfected into SNB19 cells using the siPORT NeoFX transfection agent from the Silencer® siRNA Transfection II kit (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX). An siRNA concentration of 60 nm was determined to be optimal, and a seeding cell count of 2.3 × 106 cells/transfection well was used. Controls used were glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate dehydrogenase siRNA to check for transfection success and a scrambled sequence siRNA as a negative control, both provided by Ambion. Cells were incubated in the transfection reagent at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 for 72 h. Cells were then harvested for protein expression changes (assayed via Western blotting) and phenotype analysis (cell migration assay). IGFBP2 Up-regulates Integrin Receptor Expression—Previously, our microarray data showed that integrin α5 mRNA was up-regulated in stable IGFBP2-overexpressing SNB19 cells (7De Girolami U. Anthony D.C. Frosch M.P. Cotran R.S. Kumar V. Collins T. Robbins Pathologic Basis of Disease. Saunders, Philadelphia1999: 1293-1357Google Scholar). We therefore sought to confirm this finding at the protein level by performing Western blot analyses in several SNB19 cell lines stably transfected with IGFBP2. Because the integrin α5 subunit only heterodimerizes with the integrin β1 subunit, we surmised that integrin β1 should also be up-regulated. Thus, we concurrently checked the expression level of integrin β1 as well. We found that both the α5 and β1 subunits were up-regulated at the protein level in IGFBP2-overexpressing cell lines, although the α5 subunit was induced to a higher level than was the β1 subunit (Fig. 1). Thus, the expression of the entire integrin receptor (integrin α5β1) is up-regulated when IGFBP2 is overexpressed, confirming our preliminary microarray data. IGFBP2 Interacts with Integrin α5—Because the IGFBP2 protein possesses an RGD domain, as shown by primary structure analysis, it is possible that IGFBP2 not only induces the expression of integrin α5 but also physically interacts with integrin α5 via the RGD domain. We tested this potential protein-protein interaction via co-immunoprecipitation studies. In IGFBP2-overexpressing cells, we co-immunoprecipitated IGFBP2 and then detected integrin α5 by immunoblot. In contrast, co-immunoprecipitation with control antibody did not bring down integrin α5 (Fig. 2). IGFBP2 Binds to Integrin α5 through the RGD Domain—We next studied whether the binding of IGFBP2 to integrin α5 occurs through the RGD sequence. Using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based mutagenesis, we generated an IGFBP2 expression vector with a point mutation in which Asp306 was switched to Glu306 (D306E), thus mutating the RGD domain to RGE (Fig. 3A). We then transfected the D306E-IGFBP2 mutant vector into SNB19 cells and created stable expressing clones. We chose several high expressing D306E-IGFBP2 clones for investigation. D306E-IGFBP2 clones were selected that expressed mutant IGFBP2 at levels comparable with the control clone expressing IGFBP2 (Fig. 3B) for use in further assays in this study. Co-immunoprecipitation was repeated with the D306E-IGFBP2 clones to measure the IGFBP2-integrin α5 binding changes. Cells expressing D306E-IGFBP2 showed no detectable amounts of co-immunoprecipitated integrin α5 (Fig. 3C) compared with cells expressing IGFBP2. Interestingly, D306E-IGFBP2-overexpressing clones and IGFBP2-overexpressing clones up-regulated integrin α5 protein expression to comparable levels (data not shown). Thus, the changes in the amount of D306E-IGFBP2/integrin α5 binding were due to the mutation and not due to a difference in the integrin α5 expression levels. Therefore, not only does IGFBP2 bind to integrin α5, but the interaction also appears to be mediated specifically through the integrin binding RGD motif on IGFBP2. Interaction of IGFBP2 with Integrin α5 Induces Changes in Cell Morphology—We observed marked changes in the cell shape that depended on whether the cells overexpressed IGFBP2 or D306E-IGFBP2. Specifically, on staining for F-actin, we clearly visualized numerous focal adhesion complexes on the edges of the cell membrane in parental, vector, and D306E-IGFBP2-overexpressing cells. In contrast, the IGFBP2-overexpressing cells were much larger, showing marked lamellipodia (Fig. 4). To confirm the presence of lamellipodia in IGFBP2-overexpressing cells, we assayed for the activity of the small GTPase, Rac1, a molecule contributing to lamellipodia formation. This showed that IGFBP2-overexpressing cells contained more Rac1-GTP than did D306E-IGFBP2-overexpressing cells. In particular, IGFBP2-overexpressing cells showed a >2-fold increase (over vector control cells) in the Rac1-GTP level (Fig. 5A). We then immunostained for Rac1, which showed Rac1 in the lamellipodia of IGFBP2-overexpressing cells (Fig. 5B). We also determined the fractions of cells with lamellipodia (among 100 cells for each line). We counted the cells showing observable lamellipodia and found that a significantly higher percentage of IGFBP2-overexpressing cells had lamellipodia than did vector control and D306E-IGFBP2-overexpressing cells (Fig. 5C). Thus, on the basis of our cell morphology data, it appears that D306E-IGFBP2-overexpressing cells should have a decreased migratory potential compared with IGFBP2-overexpressing cells, and this was assessed in the experiment described in the next section. Interaction of IGFBP2 with Integrin α5 Is Necessary for IGFBP2-induced Cell Migration—Because the ability of IGFBP2 to interact with integrin α5 induced the formation of lamellipodia, we next performed a Boyden chamber cell migration assay to determine whether these cell surface features are associated with cell mobility. This showed that SNB19 cells overexpressing IGFBP2 migrated significantly faster than did vector control cells. However, SNB19 cells overexpressing D306E-IGFBP2 did not migrate faster and, in fact, migrated at roughly the same rate as the parental SNB19 and vector control cells (Fig. 6A). Wound-healing assays confirmed the quantitative migration differences seen between cells overexpressing IGFBP2 and cells overexpressing D306E-IGFBP2. Specifically, SNB19 cells overexpressing IGFBP2 migrated into and covered the wound area in ∼24 h, whereas vector control and D306E-IGFBP2-overexpressing cells took significantly longer to migrate into the wound area (Fig. 6, B–D). Thus, the Boyden chamber assay and wound-healing assay both showed that D306E-IGFBP2-overexpressing cells and vector control cells had a comparably attenuated migration rate. Knock Down of Integrin α5 Attenuates IGFBP2-induced Cell Migration—To further confirm the necessity of the interaction between IGFBP2 and integrin α5 in IGFBP2-induced cell migration, we used siRNA to decrease the expression of integrin α5 and examined the effects of reducing integrin α5 in IGFBP2-overexpressing cells. Integrin α5 expression was dramatically reduced in the integrin α5 siRNA-transfected cells compared with the negative control siRNA-transfected cells, while IGFBP2 expression levels remained unchanged (Fig. 7A). The transfected cells were then analyzed for phenotypic changes. On cell migration assay we found that the knock down of integrin α5 significantly attenuated the cell migration rate of the IGFBP2-overexpressing cells (Fig. 7B). Hence, the reduction in cell migration rate here is correlated to the decreased levels of integrin α5. The enhanced expression of IGFBP2 was recently found to be one of the most frequent alterations in GBM (8Fuller G.N. Rhee C.H. Hess K.R. Caskey L.S. Wang R. Bruner J.M. Yung W.K. Zhang W.

Metab. 1997; 82: 2308-2313Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The fact that IGFBP2 is overexpressed only in advanced stages of these tumors suggests that IGFBP2 affects functional pathways critical in determining the phenotypes of these cancers, such as increased cell proliferation and invasion. In prostate cancer, IGFBP2 was shown to promote cell proliferation (28Chattergee S. Park E.S. Soloff M.S. Int. J. Urol. 2004; 11: 876-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 29Kiyama S. Morrison K. Zellweger T. Akbari M. Cox M. Yu D. Miyake H. Gleave M.E. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 3575-3584PubMed Google Scholar). In both brain and ovarian cancers, IGFBP2 has been found to enhance tumor cell invasion but not cell proliferation (13Wang H. Wang H. Shen W. Huang H. Hu L. Ramdas L. Zhou Y.H. Liao W.S. Fuller G.N. Zhang W. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 4315-4321PubMed Google Scholar, 30Lee E.J. Mircean C. Schmulevich I. Wang H. Liu J. Niemisto A. Kavanagh J.J. Lee J.H. Zhang W. Mol. Cancer. 2005; 4: 7Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Although IGFBP2 is a member of a group of proteins (IGFBP 1–6) known to modulate the bioavailability of insulin-like growth factors (IGFs), the naming scheme of these proteins is largely misleading. This is because several reported functions of IGFBPs also exist that are independent of IGFs. These include direct effects on cellular growth, adhesion, migration, and apoptosis independent of IGFs. In this study, we demonstrated that IGFBP2 enhances the migration of GBM cells through its interaction with integrin α5; this interaction is dependent on the IGFBP2 RGD domain. We used a GBM cell line (SNB19) with a low endogenous level of IGFBP2. Because overexpression of IGFBP2 is a common molecular change found in GBM (8Fuller G.N. Rhee C.H. Hess K.R. Caskey L.S. Wang R.

Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 1652-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), we decided to overexpress IGFBP2 in SNB19 cells since this cell line provided an optimal GBM model system that was not already overexpressing this gene. Further, integrin α5 is also expressed in low levels in SNB19 cells. In our transfected SNB19 cells, by overexpressing IGFBP2 (and resulting overexpression of integrin α5) we were able to observe the interaction between these two proteins (IGFBP2 and integrin α5). In parental SNB19 cells, the low endogenous IGFBP2 and integrin α5 perhaps also interact to play a role in base line cell mobility. We further found that, in gliomas, IGFBP2 participates in the decreased formation of focal adhesions, which are membrane-anchoring structures. Thus, the ability of IGFBP2 to engage integrin α5 contributes to the ability of the glioma cell to relinquish anchor points at the focal adhesions and adopt a more mobile morphology (i.e. lamellipodia). In SNB19 cells that overexpress IGFBP2, we observed increased formation of lamellipodia, little to no focal adhesions, and the ability of the cells to migrate significantly faster compared with vector control and D306E-IGFBP2-overexpressing cells. Consistently, Rac1, a GTPase molecule in the signal transduction pathway that leads to the formation of lamellipodia, is activated, and it localizes to the leading edge areas of IGFBP2-overexpressing cells. Conversely, in cells that overexpress D306E-IGFBP2, we saw focal adhesions but no appreciable lamellipodia and a considerably attenuated migration rate. Although activation of Rac1 (Rac1-GTP) was attenuated in cells overexpressing D306E-IGFBP2, we still observed more activated Rac1 in the D306E-IGFBP2 clones than in the vector control. This suggests that overexpression of IGFBP2 is able to activate Rac1 independent of whether IGFBP2 binds to integrin α5. However, the mechanism through which IGFBP2 activates Rac1 independent of integrin α5 remains to be investigated. During the course of our study, Pereira et al. (20Pereira J.J. Meyer T. Docherty S.E. Reid H.H. Marshall J. Thompson E.W. Rossjohn J. Price J.T. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 977-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and Schutt et al. (21Schutt B.S. Langkamp M. Rauschnabel U. Ranke M.B. Elmlinger M.W. Endocrinology. 2004; 32: 859-868Google Scholar) also independently showed that IGFBP2 bound to integrins and regulated cell movement. The effect and the specific integrin involved, however, differed to some extent depending on the particular neoplasm under study. In breast cancer, the interaction of IGFBP2 with integrin αv decreased cell migration (20Pereira J.J. Meyer T. Docherty S.E. Reid H.H. Marshall J. Thompson E.W. Rossjohn J. Price J.T. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 977-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In the glioma cells that we used for this study, integrin αv is detectable; however, IGFBP2 co-immunoprecipitation experiments did not co-precipitate integrin αv (data not shown). Thus, the interaction between IGFBP2 and integrin proteins is cell- and, perhaps, tissue-specific through a mechanism that is not presently known. In addition, the differing partnerships between IGFBP2 and the various integrin subunits may produce differing effects on cell migration. In sarcoma cells, IGFBP2 has been shown to interact with integrin α5 and results in increased cell de-adhesion and reduced cell proliferation (21Schutt B.S. Langkamp M. Rauschnabel U. Ranke M.B. Elmlinger M.W. Endocrinology. 2004; 32: 859-868Google Scholar); both of these features are characteristic of a cancer cell that is adopting a mobile phenotype. The same authors reported their findings to be IGF independent. In our study, we did not directly test whether the interaction between IGFBP2 and integrin α5 was modulated by IGF. Our findings here in glioma are supportive of what was found in sarcoma, although our study, using a site-directed mutation approach, provided mechanistic data demonstrating that the interaction between IGFBP2 and integrin α5 is specific and mediated through the RGD domain. In knocking down the expression of integrin α5, we noted that the migration rates of IGFBP2-overexpressing cells were decreased, supporting the notion that IGFBP2 needs to interact with integrin α5 to enhance cell migration. In the parental controls we also observed a slight decrease in parental cell migration rate when transfected with integrin α5 siRNA. Although the observed decrease here could be small, it does point to the possibility, as suggested earlier, that the small endogenous amount of IGFBP2 and integrin α5 expression in SNB19 cells are indeed interacting and contribute to base line cell mobility. In summary, the present study further characterizes the role of IGFBP2 in glioma pathology. Not only does IGFBP2 enhance cell invasion by increasing the extracellular matrix digestive process, it also promotes cell mobility through an integrin-mediated pathway, which is known to be activated in glioblastoma.

Kv channels control the flow of K+ through the cell membrane in response to changes in membrane potential. Opening of the channel causes membrane hyperpolarization that can curtail excessive membrane excitability or simply tone down normal membrane activity. Kvβ, found in plants, insects, and mammals, attaches to the cytosolic face of the Kv1 channels to form a macromolecular complex (Fig. 1A) (1Parcej D.N. Scott V.E. Dolly J.O.

Could Kvβ be the missing link between cellular redox chemistry and Kv channel activities? In this study, we address the questions of whether Kvβ is a functional AKR and whether the AKR function is coupled to channel functions.AKRs catalyze the reduction of an aldehyde to an alcohol by oxidizing an NADPH cofactor. Most AKRs have a broad substrate spectrum so that in addition to their native substrates, they also convert small molecule aldehydes such as benzaldehyde derivatives (18Jez J.M. Bennett M.J. Schlegel B.P. Lewis M. Penning T.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 625-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). The catalysis follows a kinetic mechanism shown in Scheme I. An AKR, E, binds sequentially an NADPH and an aldehyde substrate (19Askonas L.J. Ricigliano J.W. Penning T.M. Biochem. J. 1991; 278: 835-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) to form a ternary complex, E-NADPH-aldehyde. The redox reaction then occurs when the enzyme helps transfer a hydride from the cofactor to the aldehyde. The product, an alcohol, dissociates from the enzyme and is followed by the oxidized cofactor NADP+. Many AKRs show high specificity to NADPH over its close relative, NADH (18Jez J.M. Bennett M.J. Schlegel B.P. Lewis M. Penning T.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 625-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). The hydride transfer step is usually fast, and the nucleotide exchange steps, or the protein conformational changes associated with them, are slow and rate-limiting (20Grimshaw C.E. Shahbaz M.

For electrophysiological measurements, rat Kv1.4 (GenBank™ accession number: CAA34133) or Kvβ2 was cloned into a modified pBluescript vector for in vitro transcription. Mutations were made using the QuikChange (Strategene) kit and verified by sequencing through the entire coding region.Protein Expression and Purification—XL-1Blue cells were used to express protein. Cells were grown in Luria broth at 37 °C to an OD of ∼1.2 and induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (final concentration). Immediately after induction, the temperature was reduced to 20 °C, and cells were harvested 16 h after induction. Expressed protein was purified on a Talon Co2+ affinity column (BD Biosciences). Throughout the purification procedure, the following buffer was used: 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 300 mm KCl, 10% (v:v) glycerol, and 1mm β-mercaptoethanol. Non-specifically bound protein was washed using 20 mm imidazole added to the above solution, and Kvβ2 protein was eluted with 300 mm imidazole. Immediately after elution, the affinity tag was removed by a brief incubation with trypsin at a Kvβ2 to trypsin ratio of ∼150:1 (w:w). The protein was then loaded onto a Superdex 200 column (Amersham Biosciences) for final purification. The column was equilibrated with the reaction buffer: 150 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0. Protein concentration was determined using the BCA kit (Pierce).Enzyme Kinetics Measurement—To measure the steady-state multiple turnover reaction rate, the reaction mixture (100 μl) contains 0.2 mm NADPH, 30 μg Kvβ2 protein, and desired concentration of substrates in the reaction buffer. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C and NADPH (ε340 = 6.22 mm–1 cm–1) absorption was monitored at 340 nm using a PharmaSpec UV-1700 (Shimadzu) equipped with a temperature controlling unit (CPS-240A). The reaction was initiated by the addition of a substrate. The initial turnover rate constant was calculated from the linear part of the decrease in the absorbance. Blank controls with no protein were incorporated routinely, and the background NADPH consumption was subtracted.As a positive control, we obtained rat 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase protein (a gift from Dr. Trevor Penning, University of Pennsylvania) and measured its specific activity using the following conditions: 75 μm androsterone (dissolved in acetonitrile), 2.3 mm NAD+, 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, and 4% acetonitrile (total). We initiated the reaction by adding the enzyme and monitored the absorbance at 340 nm over time. We obtained a specific activity of 1.4 ± 0.1 μm (n = 5) of androsterone oxidized per minute per milligram of protein, similar to the value of 1.6 μm min–1 mg–1 obtained in Dr Penning's laboratory.To measure the single turnover hydride transfer reaction rate, Kvβ2 protein was concentrated to 3–10 mg/ml and mixed with proper concentrations of substrates, and the absorption at 363 nm was followed over time at 37 °C. The 23 nm red shift of the absorption peak for the bound NADPH is likely caused by interactions between the nicotinamide ring and the surrounding residues. Previous studies have demonstrated that the 363 nm peak is due to the bound NADPH (22Liu S.Q. Jin H. Zacarias A. Srivastava S. Bhatnagar A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11812-11820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The fraction of NADPH remaining on Kvβ was then plotted versus time, and the data points were fit with a single exponential function in Origin (Microcal Inc.). The inverse of the exponential time constant is defined as the hydride transfer rate constant. When higher than 5 mm 4-carboxybenzaldehyde (4-CB) was used in either the multiple or single turnover measurement, 40 mm Tris was used to maintain the solution pH at 8.0.Channel Expression and Electrophysiology—mRNA was prepared by in vitro transcription and purified using the Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). mRNAs were injected into Xenopus oocytes for channel expression. For co-expression, Kv1.4 and Kvβ2 mRNAs were injected at a ratio of 1:3 (w:w). The wild type Kv1.4 has a cysteine residue at position 13 that can be oxidized on inside-out patches to affect channel inactivation, and a C13S mutant or addition of dithiothreitol abolishes this effect (23Ruppersberg J.P. Stocker M. Pongs O. Heinemann S.H. Frank R. Koenen M. Nature. 1991; 352: 711-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). To eliminate concerns that the change in inactivation could be due to cysteine oxidation, we used the C13S Kv1.4 in this study. In parallel, we also tested 4-cyanobenzaldehyde (4-CY) and 4-CB on Kv1.4 wild type coexpressed with Kvβ2, in the presence of 5 mm dithiothreitol, and essentially the same results were obtained.We recorded patch clamp currents from oocytes 3–5 days after injection. Electrodes were drawn from patch glasses (G85150T-4, Warner Instruments) and polished (MP-803, Narishige Co.) to a resistance of 0.6–1 MΩ. The pipette solution contained (in mm): 130 KCl, 2 MgCl2, and 10 KH2PO4 at pH 7.4. The bath solution contained (in mm): 80 KCl, 5 EGTA, and 50 KH2PO4 at pH 7.4. pH was adjusted with KOH. The higher buffer content in the bath solution is necessary to maintain the pH at 7.4 for 5 mm or higher 4-CB. K+ currents were elicited by holding the patch at –100mV for at least 30 s and stepping to +60 mV for 500 ms. The volume of the recording chamber (Warner Instruments) is ∼120 μl, and complete exchange of solution was achieved by perfusing 1 ml of new solution by gravity flow with a flow rate of 2–3 ml/min.Inactivation of Kv1.4 with or without Kvβ2 has been studied extensively (24Castellino R.C.

Current inactivation can be fit by an exponential function with two components. The faster component, which is also the predominant one, is mainly contributed by the N-type inactivation (29Hoshi T. Zagotta W.N. Aldrich R.W. Science. 1990; 250: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (1270) Google Scholar), and the slower component is thought to be mainly due to the C-type inactivation (27Rasmusson R.L.

For Kv1.4 co-expressed with the wild type Kvβ2, both the slow and fast inactivation time constants were modulated by 4-CY (Table 1). Since the N- and C-type inactivations are tightly coupled, we do not know yet if the change in the slow component is due to a direct effect on the C-type inactivation or a result of change in the N-type inactivation. We focused on the fast component, and we defined the inverse of the smaller time constant as the rate constant of channel inactivation and used the rate constant as a measure for the effect of Kvβ substrates.TABLE 1Inactivation time constants for Kv1.4 channels paired with different Kvβ2sτ1f1τ2f2msmsKv1.428.2 ± 1.80.54 ± 0.06175.1 ± 2.70.46 ± 0.061Kv1.4 (after 4-CY)29.6 ± 2.40.61 ± 0.05476.8 ± 3.90.39 ± 0.054Kv1.4 + Kvβ212.3 ± 0.280.81 ± 0.01346.6 ± 2.20.19 ± 0.012Kv1.4 + Kvβ2 (after 4-CY)21.7 ± 0.680.74 ± 0.02186.4 ± 5.50.26 ± 0.021Kv1.4 + Kvβ2 D85N16.4 ± 1.10.80 ± 0.02357.5 ± 8.00.20 ± 0.023Kv1.4 + Kvβ2 D85N (after 4-CY)17.3 ± 1.20.80 ± 0.03157.8 ± 7.80.20 ± 0.030Kv1.4 + Kvβ2 K118M17.0 ± 0.680.64 ± 0.05462.9 ± 3.70.36 ± 0.054Kv1.4 + Kvβ2 K118 M (after 4-CY)17.5 ± 0.760.71 ± 0.05563.2 ± 7.90.29 ± 0.055 Open table in a new tab Chemical Reagents—All chemical reagents were purchased from Sigma, except for 4-oxononenal (Cayman Chemicals).

The final concentration of ethanol or dimethyl sulfoxide is less than 1% in electrophysiological measurements. NADPH was purchased as a tetrasodium salt. Since sodium ions block potassium channels from the intracellular side, we exchanged the sodium to potassium ions by fast protein liquid chromatography, and the stock solution was aliquoted and stored at –80 °C.RESULTSSingle Turnover Enzymatic Reactions—Freshly purified Kvβ2 protein contains the reduced form of the cofactor (NADPH), as indicated by a 363 nm peak in the UV absorption spectrum (Fig. 2A), and the occupancy of NADPH is more than 90% (10Gulbis J.M.

Chem. 2001; 276: 11812-11820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Since NADP+ has little absorption at the same wavelength, the NADPH-to-NADP+ conversion eliminates the 363 nm peak. Utilizing this as a readout, we screened small molecule aldehydes, which are common AKR substrates. We have identified several potential Kvβ substrates and two of the compounds, 4-CB and 4-CY (Fig. 2B, inset), were used here to study the enzymatic activity of Kvβ and substrate-induced channel modulations.FIGURE 2Enzymatic properties of Kvβ2.

The peak at 363 nm decreases over time, and the reduction of the peak reflects the oxidation of the Kvβ2-bound NADPH. Since no free NADPH was added, this is a single turnover reaction. When the fraction of NADPH remaining was plotted versus time (Fig. 2C), the data points were well fit by a single exponential function with a time constant of 8.4 ± 0.1 min (Fig. 2C), consistent with a single step hydride transfer reaction. Similar results were obtained when 5 mm 4-CY was used but with a smaller time constant of 2.3 ± 0.05 min (Fig. 2C), indicating that 4-CY at 5 mm concentration consumes the bound cofactor ∼3 fold faster than 4-CB.To support the conclusion that the observed NADPH consumption is due to an enzymatic reaction, three control experiments were done. First, free NADPH was mixed with 5 mm 4-CB in the absence of Kvβ2 protein, and the change in NADPH absorption was monitored over time. A very slight decrease of NADPH absorption was observed over a period of 1 h (Fig. 2D), indicating that the reaction is greatly facilitated when the cofactor binds to the Kvβ2 protein.Second, an active site residue, aspartate 85 (Fig. 1B), was mutated to an asparagine (Asn) and the D85N mutant protein was expressed and purified. Asp85 is highly conserved in all AKRs, and a Asp-to-Asn mutation reduces the rate of catalysis in other AKRs such as aldose reductase and 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3α-HSD) by ∼12- and 31-fold, respectively (31Tarle I.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3538-3548Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The purified D85N Kvβ2 protein has a bound NADPH cofactor, as indicated by an absorption peak near 360 nm. When the D85N mutant protein was mixed with 5 mm 4-CB, the absorption of the bound cofactor changed very slowly with a time constant of 330 ± 20 min (Fig. 2C; see also Fig. 3A). The time constant is ∼40-fold slower than that of the wild type Kvβ, indicating that the mutation slowed down the enzymatic reaction. This result supports the conclusion that Kvβ is a functional AKR.FIGURE 3Kinetic studies of Kvβ2.

To do this, we purified the oxidized Kvβ2, i.e. Kvβ2 protein after its bound NADPH was consumed by 4-CY, by passing the reaction mixture through a size exclusion column. Interestingly, we found that the elution does not contain a peak corresponding to NADP+, which should be easily detected (Fig. 2E). This indicates that the oxidized cofactor (NADP+) stays tightly bound to Kvβ2. Using the oxidized Kvβ2, we screened small molecule alcohols for their ability to reduce the bound cofactor, and we found potential substrates. The result from one of them, 4-methoxybenzalcohol (4-MOB), is shown in Fig. 2F. When 4-MOB (10 mm) was mixed with the oxidized Kvβ2, absorption at 363 nm gradually increased (Fig. 2F, inset) and recovers to approximately the same level as freshly purified protein. The time course of NADPH generation was well fit with a single exponential function with a time constant of 61 ± 1 min (Fig. 2F), consistent with a single step hydride transfer reaction. The consumption and the re-generation of the Kvβ2-bound NADPH by small molecule aldehydes and alcohols clearly demonstrated that Kvβ is a functional AKR.Single Versus Multiple Turnover Enzymatic Reactions—To further characterize the hydride transfer reaction, we measured the rate constant of the bound NADPH consumption, i.e. the single turnover reaction, at different 4-CY or 4-CB concentrations. We found that the rate constant increases with either 4-CB or 4-CY concentration and does not reach saturation even at 20 mm of a substrate (Fig. 3A, left panel). As a control, we used the D85N Kvβ2 protein and measured its hydride transfer rate at three different 4-CB concentrations (Fig. 3A, right panel). The rate is much slower than that of the wild type at all three substrate concentrations (2, 5, and 10 mm), supporting the conclusion that that Kvβ is a functional AKR.It is remarkable that the rate constant does not saturate with increasing substrate concentrations. This indicates that both substrates have low occupancies on the enzyme so that binding is not saturated, something that is expected because both compounds are not native substrates. More importantly, it indicates that Kvβ is capable of converting the bound NADPH at a rate equal to or faster than 1.9 ± 0.06 min–1 (20 mm 4-CY), a time scale that is physiologically relevant in terms of redox sensing in a cell (33Weir E.K. Lopez-Barneo J. Buckler K.J. Archer S.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 2005; 353: 2042-2055Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar).The hydride transfer step is only a half-reaction in the enzymatic reaction cycle, so we next measured the steady-state turnover rate constant for the cycle shown in Scheme I. The turnover rate constant was plotted versus 4-CB or 4-CY concentrations (Fig. 3B), and the data points were well fit by a Michaelis-Menten equation with a maximum turnover rate constant of 0.073 ± 0.0016 and 0.082 ± 0.0011/min and a Km of 3.2 ± 0.17 and 2.7 ± 0.12 mm, for 4-CB and 4-CY, respectively. When NADPH was substituted with NADH, no turnover was observed (data not shown), indicating that Kvβ has evolved to use specifically NADPH for catalysis. The steady-state turnover rate constant for both 4-CB and 4-CY is approximately the same but is much slower than the hydride transfer rate constant, especially for 4-CY. This is consistent with a reaction mechanism in which the cofactor exchange steps are rate-limiting. Since the cofactor exchange steps are not substrate-dependent, it suggests that the steady-state turnover rate constant is similar even when Kvβ catalyzes its native substrate(s). This property may have important physiological implications (see “Discussion”).As an additional control and to further support the conclusion that Kvβ is an AKR, we mutated another highly conserved catalytic site residue, Lys118 (Fig. 1B), to a methionine. A Lys-to-Met mutation in rat 3α-HSD reduces the multiple turnover rate by more than 1000-fold (32Schlegel B.P. Jez J.M. Penning T.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3538-3548Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). We expressed and purified the K118M mutant Kvβ2 and measured the multiple turnover rate constant at three different 4-CY concentrations (Fig. 3B). At 5 mm 4-CY, the turnover rate constant ((1.04 ± 0.21) × 10–4 min–1) was ∼500-fold slower than that of the wild type (0.053 ± 0.003 min–1). The rate is essentially indistinguishable from that of free NADPH oxidation without the presence of a Kvβ protein. This result indicates that the conserved lysine is important for catalysis, and reinforces the conclusion that Kvβ is a functional AKR.Channel Modulation by Kvβ Substrates—That Kvβ is a functional AKR naturally leads to the question of whether the redox reaction on Kvβ affects channel function. To address this question, we co-expressed Kv1.4 with Kvβ2 and monitored channel function on inside-out patches before and after applying a Kvβ substrate.Fig. 4A shows currents from a typical inside-out patch excised from an oocyte co-expressing Kv1.4 and Kvβ2. When 4-CY was perfused on the intracellular side of the membrane, channel inactivation rate decreased from 81 ± 1.9 s–1 to 46 ± 1.4 s–1 (Fig. 4, A and E, and Table 1; n = 31 patches from eight batches of oocytes), and both the peak current and the steady-state current levels increased significantly (Fig. 4A). 4-CB induced an almost identical response (data not shown). We have observed the substrate-induced change of channel current consistently on all the inside-out patches, and the change remained after the substrates were washed away.FIGURE 4Channel modulations by Kvβ substrates. A–D, current traces of Kv1.4 expressed with no Kvβ2(B), with the wild type Kvβ2(A), with the D85N Kvβ2(C), and with the K118M Kvβ2(D). In each case, current traces at two different time scales are shown. The black trace was recorded before 4-CY application. After incubating the patch for 10 min in the internal solution containing 5 mm 4-CY, the solution was exchanged to wash away 4-CY, and the red trace was recorded. E, channel inactivation rate before (black) and after (red) 4-CY application. The error bars are S.E. of 31 (for 1.4 + Kvβ2), 10 (for Kv1.4 alone), 9 (for Kv1.4 + D85N Kvβ2), and 6 (for Kv1.4 + K118M Kvβ2) independent measurements (patches). F, the same experiments shown in A and B. After recording the red trace, the bath solution was exchanged to the one containing 0.2 mm NADPH, and the blue trace was recorded 30 min after incubation.

In the purple nonsulfur bacteria, Rhodobacter capsulatus and Rhodobacter sphaeroides, all genes of the Mg-branch (bch genes) are clustered in several tightly linked operons called a photosynthesis gene cluster that spans a region (46 and 41 kb in length, respectively) of the chromosome together with other genes involved in photosynthesis (puc, puf, and crt genes; Refs. 2Bollivar D.W.

Res. 1999; 62: 121-139Crossref Google Scholar). Most of the steps in the Mg-branch of BChl a biosynthesis are similar if not identical to those of chlorophyll a (Chl a) biosynthesis in oxygenic photosynthetic organisms. These steps include: (i) the insertion of Mg2+ into protoporphyrin IX (bchI, bchD, bchH), (ii) the methylation of propinonate at the C-13 position (bchM), (iii) the formation of an isopentanone fifth ring (bchE), (iv) the reduction of a vinyl group at the C-8 position (bchJ), and (v) the formation of a chlorin ring by the D-ring reduction of protochlorophyllide (Pchlide; bchL, bchN, bchB). Most genes responsible for these reactions are conserved in cyanobacteria and plants (5Suzuki J.Y. Bollivar D.W. Bauer C.E. Annu. Rev.

Chlorophyllide a (Chlide a), the final product of these five reactions, has spectral properties identical to Chl a; that is, it absorbs red light with enough energy to perform oxygenic photosynthesis. These enzymes involved in BChl a biosynthesis, which are common to plants, have been biochemically studied as model enzymes for Chl a biosynthesis (13Willows R.D. Hansson M. Kadish K.M. Smith K.M.

Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York2003: 71-108Google Scholar). Compared with the enzymes common to Chl a biosynthesis, enzymes specific for BChls, such as BChls a, b, c, d, and e, are poorly understood, except for C-20 methyl transferase BchU, which operates in BChl c biosynthesis (17Maresca J.A.

In BChl a biosynthesis, two additional biosynthetic steps, the conversion of a chlorin ring to a bacteriochlorin ring by the B-ring reduction and modification of the C-3-vinyl group to an acetyl group, transform Chlide a to bacteriochlorophyllide a. These structural changes exert effects on the spectral properties of these compounds enabling them to absorb infrared light to perform anoxygenic photosynthesis. Directed mutagenesis and phenotypic analysis of the resultant mutants suggest that three genes, bchX, bchY, and bchZ, are involved in the B-ring reduction (19Burke D.H. Alberti M. Hearst J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2407-2413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20McGlynn P. Hunter C.N. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 236: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and that two genes, bchF and bchC, are required for the C-3 group modification (2Bollivar D.W. Suzuki J.Y. Beatty J.T. Dobrowolski J.M. Bauer C.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 237: 622-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 21Burke D.H. Alberti M. Hearst J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2414-2422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A similarity search of amino acid sequences of bch gene products has suggested that two nitrogenase-like enzymes are involved in BChl a biosynthesis (22Burke D.H. Hearst J.E. Sidow A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7134-7138Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The first nitrogenase-like enzyme is the dark-operative (light-independent) Pchlide reductase (DPOR) that catalyzes the stereo-specific reduction of the D-ring of Pchlide (Fig. 1; Ref. 23Fujita Y. Bauer C.E. Kadish K.M. Smith K.M. Guilard R. Porphyrin Handbook. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York2003: 109-156Google Scholar). The three subunits of DPOR, BchL, BchN, and BchB, show significant similarities to the three nitrogenase subunits NifH, NifD, and NifK, respectively. The nitrogenase-like features of DPOR have recently been exemplified by the reconstitution of the DPOR reaction by purified proteins and have confirmed that DPOR has properties common to nitrogenase (24Fujita Y. Bauer C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23583-23588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 25Nomata J. Swem L.R. Bauer C.E. Fujita Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1708: 229-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). DPOR consists of two separable components, an L-protein (BchL dimmer) and an NB-protein (BchN-BchB heterotetramer), which is similar to nitrogenase (Fe-protein and MoFe-protein), and DPOR catalysis depends on ATP and dithionite or reduced ferredoxin. The other nitrogenase-like enzyme involved in BChl a biosynthesis is Chlide a reductase (COR), which catalyzes the stereo-specific reduction of the B-ring of Chlide a (Fig. 1). The deduced amino acid sequences of BchX, BchY, and BchZ also show significant similarities to the amino acid sequences of the nitrogenase subunits NifH, NifD, and NifK, respectively. BchX from R. capsulatus is a protein of 333 amino acid residues and shows 31.5% identity to that of the NifH protein from Azotobacter vinelandii. The Fe-protein, a homodimer of NifH, functions as an ATP-dependent electron donor for the MoFe-protein of nitrogenase. To accomplish its functions, the Fe-protein carries a [4Fe-4S] cluster, bridged by two Cys residues from each NifH protomer, and the Walker motif A for ATP-binding, which is conserved in the amino-terminal region (26Igarashi R.Y. Seefeldt L.C. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2003; 38: 351-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). BchX has two completely conserved Cys residues (Cys130 and Cys165) for the Fe-S cluster chelation and the Walker motif A(Gly42-Ser49; Ref. 23Fujita Y. Bauer C.E. Kadish K.M. Smith K.M. Guilard R. Porphyrin Handbook. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York2003: 109-156Google Scholar). This sequence conservation suggests that BchX functions as an ATP-dependent reductase that is specific for the other catalytic component as well as the Fe-protein of nitrogenase. BchY and BchZ from R. capsulatus are proteins of 497 amino acid residues and 490 amino acid residues, respectively, and show lower yet apparent similarity to NifD and NifK of nitrogenase, respectively. The MoFe-protein contains novel metalloclusters, FeMo-cofactor (FeMo-co), and P-cluster (a [8Fe-7S] cluster) that occur as pairs. FeMo-co is a [1Mo-7Fe-9S-X-homocitrate] cluster held by His and Cys residues in NifD. Six Cys residues (three from NifD and three from NifK) are involved in the chelating of P-cluster (26Igarashi R.Y. Seefeldt L.C. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2003; 38: 351-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). His and Cys residues for FeMo-co chelation are not conserved in BchY. Instead, three Cys in BchY, and one Cys in BchZ, of the six Cys residues in NifD and NifK are conserved (23Fujita Y. Bauer C.E. Kadish K.M. Smith K.M. Guilard R. Porphyrin Handbook. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York2003: 109-156Google Scholar). These features of sequence conservation suggest that BchY and BchZ form a catalytic component as well as MoFe-protein with slightly different metallocluster(s). However, to our best knowledge, there is no biochemical evidence for the nitrogenase-like features of COR. Here, we first report the reconstitution of the COR reaction by the purified proteins, BchX and BchY-BchZ, from R. capsulatus, and the identification of the COR product as 3-vinyl bacteriochlorophyllide a (3VBChlide). These results demonstrate that the sequential actions of two nitrogenase-like enzymes, DPOR and COR, convert the cyclic tetrapyrrole ring structure from porphyrin (Pchlide) to bacteriochlorin in the BChl a biosynthetic pathway. Strains and Culture Conditions—The photosynthetically competent R. capsulatus mutant DB176 (ORF176::KmR; 25) was used as the host strain to overexpress Strep-tagged bchX and bchY genes. The transconjugants were grown heterotrophically in PY medium (27Young D.A. Bauer C.E. Williams J.C. Marrs B.L. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 218: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) overnight with vigorous shaking at 200 rpm in the dark at 34 °C. To prepare crude extract for protein purification, the transconjugants were grown photosynthetically in RCV medium (28Weaver P.F. Wall J.D. Gest H. Arch. Microbiol. 1975; 105: 207-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar) illuminated with incandescent lamps (90 watts; National, Osaka, Japan) for 4 days at 34 °C. PY and RCV media contained 5 μg ml-1 kanamycin and 10 μg ml-1 spectinomycin. Construction of Overexpression Plasmids—Two plasmids, pJN4X and pJN4YZ, were constructed to overexpress BchX and BchY as fusion proteins with an affinity tag (Strep-tagII) under the control of the puc promoter in R. capsulatus (Fig. 2). The Strep-tagII is a short peptide consisting of eight amino acid residues (WSHPQFEK) that binds specifically to an engineered streptavidin, Strep-Tactin. Two primers, bchXf2 (5′-AGTTCGAGAAGTCGGGGGTGACTGACGCACCCAACCTGAA-3′) and bchXr1 (5′-CAGGTACCTCAGACATCGTCGTAGATCAC-3′), were used to amplify the entire coding region for bchX by PCR (the sequences that anneal to the bchX coding region are underlined; Fig. 2, PCR1-1). Another two primers, bchYf2 (5′-AGTTCGAGAAGTCGGGGGTGACCGATCTTCCGCAAGCCGA-3′) and bchZr1 (5′-CAGGTACCTCAGTTCCCCCCCTTCCGATC-3′), were used to amplify the chromosomal region covering the entire coding regions of bchY and bchZ, which are located contiguously on the chromosome, by PCR (the sequences that anneals to the bchY and bchZ coding regions are underlined; Fig. 2, PCR1-2). PCR was performed with KOD polymerase (KOD-plus; Toyobo, Osaka, Japan) using genomic DNA of R. capsulatus as the template. A 2-kb fragment consisting of the spectinomycin omega cartridge and the puc promoter was amplified with two primers, pBBRT7f1 (5′-TCGGTACCGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGC-3′) and pPucStrepr2 (5′-CACCCCCGACTTCTCGAACTGCGGATGCGACCACGAGGCCATTGTCCCGAATCCTCCAA-3′; the sequence encoding the Strep-tag is double-underlined), using pJN3 as the template (Fig. 2, PCR1). pJN3 is a pBBR1MCS2 derivative containing the spectinomycin omega cartridge and the puc promoter. The second PCR reactions were followed by amplification with the primer pairs “pBBRT7f1” and “bchXr1” (Fig. 2, PCR2-1) or “pBBRT7f1” and “bchZr1” (Fig. 2, PCR2-2). The final amplified fragments consisting of the spectinomycin resistance gene, the puc promoter, the Strep-tag, and the entire coding regions for bchX or bchY-bchZ were digested with KpnI (indicated by italics in the sequences) and ligated into the KpnI site of pBBR1MCS2 (29Kovach M.E. Elzer P.H. Hill D.S. Robertson G.T. Farris M.A. Roop II R.M. Peterson K.M. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 166: 175-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (2749) Google Scholar), yielding the final overexpression plasmids, pJN4X and pJN4YZ. The amino-terminal sequence of Strep-tagged BchX and BchY is commonly MASWSHPQFEKSGV followed by the second amino acid residues of their native sequences. The nucleotide sequence encoding the Strep-tag (5′-ATGGCCTCGTGGTCGCATCCGCAGTTCGAGAAGTCGGGGGTG-3′) was designed to match the codon usage of R. capsulatus. Isolation of R. capsulatus Strains JNX and JNYZ—The plasmids pJN4X and pJN4YZ were transferred into R. capsulatus DB176 cells by triparental mating with Escherichia coli strain JM105 containing the relevant plasmids (30Taylor D.P. Cohen S.N. Clark W.G. Marrs B.L. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 154: 580-590Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transconjugants were selected on PY plates containing rifampicin (100 μg ml-1), kanamycin (5 μg ml-1), and spectinomycin (10 μgml-1). The resulting transconjugants expressing Strep-tagged BchX and BchY proteins under the control of the puc promoter were designated JNX and JNYZ, respectively. Purification of BchX and BchY—Crude extracts for protein purification were prepared as described previously (25Nomata J. Swem L.R. Bauer C.E. Fujita Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1708: 229-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Cultures at the optical density (OD660) of about 1.5 were collected in a 1-liter bottle and placed in an anaerobic chamber (model A; Coy Laboratory Products, Grass Lake, MI). Approximately 100 mg of sodium dithionite (Sigma) was added to the culture, and the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C (TA24BH rotor; Tomy, Tokyo, Japan). All subsequent procedures were carried out in an anaerobic chamber using solutions that had been degassed and stored in the chamber. Sodium dithionite (final concentration of 1.7 mm) was added just before use to remove residual oxygen. The collected cells were suspended in lysis buffer (24Fujita Y. Bauer C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23583-23588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and disrupted by sonication. The sonicate was then transferred to 30PC tubes (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) and centrifuged at 37,000 × g for 30 min (RP50-2; Hitachi) at 4 °C. Approximately 15 ml of the resulting supernatant was then loaded onto a Strep-Tactin-Sepharose column (2 ml of Strep-Tactin-Sepharose in a 1.5 × 1.2-cm column; IBA, Göttingen, Germany) that was equilibrated with wash buffer containing 100 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 12 μm sodium dithionite. The column was washed in 12 ml of wash buffer and Strep-tagged proteins were then eluted using wash buffer containing 2.5 mm desthiobiotin. Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA method (Protein Assay; Bio-Rad), with bovine serum albumin as the standard. SDS-PAGE and Amino-terminal Sequence Analysis—Purified proteins were electrophoresed on a 12% acrylamide gel that was stained with CBB (“CBB Stain One”; Nakarai, Osaka, Japan). For the aminoterminal sequence analysis, 300 ng of purified YZ-protein was loaded onto a 10% acrylamide gel of 1.5-mm thickness. After electrophoresis, the proteins were electrically transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P; Millipore, Billerica, MA) using a Mini Trans-Blot Electrophoretic Transfer Cell (Bio-Rad) according to the instructional manual. Each blot of the BchY and BchZ proteins was excised and washed in distilled water, then 50% methanol, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, methanol, and anhydrous acetonitrile, before being dried, and loaded onto protein sequencers PPSQ-23A (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) and Procise cLC 494cLC (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), respectively, to determine the amino-terminal sequences (Toray Research Center, Kamakura, Japan). Preparation of Chlide a—The R. capsulatus mutant CB1200 (ΔbchF, ΔbchZ; Ref. 2Bollivar D.W. Suzuki J.Y. Beatty J.T. Dobrowolski J.M. Bauer C.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 237: 622-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) was grown in RCV-2/3PY medium (80 ml in a 200-ml flask) containing 10 μg ml-1 spectinomycin at 34 °C in the dark with slow shaking at 130 rpm. The culture medium was collected by centrifugation. The Chlide a in the culture medium was then extracted in one-third volume of diethyl ether. The ether was then evaporated to dryness by a stream of nitrogen. The dried Chlide a was dissolved in Me2SO to a final concentration of 150 μm. The Chlide a concentration was determined in 80% acetone using the extinction coefficient at 663 nm (77.1 mm-1 cm-1) of Chl a (31Lichtenthaler H.K. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 148: 350-382Crossref Scopus (9417) Google Scholar). Chlide a Reductase Assay—COR assays were carried out in a 250-μl volume containing 100 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 8.0), 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm ATP, 20 mm creatine phosphate, 21 units μl-1 creatine phosphokinase, 0.7 mm sodium dithionite, 1-2 μm Chlide a, and 12.5 μl of purified protein(s). The assay mixtures were incubated in anaerobic conditions in the dark for 50 min at 34 °C. To stop the reactions, an aliquot (200 μl) of the assay mixture was mixed with acetone (final concentration 80%). After phase partitioning with 700 μl of hexane, absorption spectra of the lower acetone phase were recorded on a Jasco V550 spectrophotometer (Jasco, Hachioji, Japan). To monitor the change in absorption spectra of the COR reaction mixture, the assay mixture was prepared in a cuvette with an air-tight screw cap in the anaerobic chamber and the cuvette was set in the Jasco V550 spectrophotometer with a temperature control module (model ETC-477, set at 34 °C; Jasco). The absorption spectra were periodically recorded. The extinction coefficient of 3VBChlide, the COR reaction product, at 734 nm in 80% acetone (hexane-extracted) was experimentally determined to be 44.7 mm-1 cm-1 based on the extinction coefficient (82.5 mm-1 cm-1) of 3-vinyl bacteriochlorophyll a (3VBChl) in ether (32Struck A. Cmiel E. Katheder I. Schäfer W. Scheer H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1101: 321-328Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). LC/MS Analysis of COR Product—Extraction of the COR products from the above assay mixtures after 0- and 50-min incubations was performed as follows. Each aliquot of the assay mixtures was mixed with acetone. After washing with hexane, the lower acetone-phase was extracted with a mixture of petroleum ether, diethyl ether, and ethyl acetate (1:1:2 (v/v/v)). The upper phase containing the COR products was evaporated to dryness by a stream of nitrogen. The extract thus obtained was dissolved in methanol for LC/MS analysis. LC/MS was performed using a Shimadzu LCMS-2010EV system (Shimadzu) comprising a liquid chromatograph (SCL-10Avp system controller, LC-10ADvp pump, and SPD-M10Avp photodiode-array detector) and a quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray ionization probe. HPLC was performed using reverse-phase chromatography under the following conditions: column, Inertsil ODS-EP (3.0 × 150 mm; GL Sciences, Tokyo, Japan); eluent, methanol:75 mm ammonium acetate (pH 5.25), 75:25 (v/v); flow rate, 0.35 ml min-1; and detection wavelengths, 725 and 415 nm. MS conditions were as follows: capillary temperature, 250 °C; electrospray ionization voltage, 4.5 kV; sheath gas flow, 1.5 liters min-1; and drying gas pressure, 0.16 megapascals. The absorption spectrum of 3VBChlide was also recorded using a photodiode-array detector. Purification of BchX and BchY-BchZ—To facilitate purification of proteins, we set up a system to overexpress affinity tagged (Strep-tagII) BchX and BchY in R. capsulatus DB176 (Fig. 2, 25). Because of the structural similarity to nitrogenase, we carefully performed all procedures involving the characterization of COR, such as harvesting of cells, cell lysis, protein purification, and the activity assay under anaerobic conditions using an anaerobic chamber (24Fujita Y. Bauer C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23583-23588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 25Nomata J. Swem L.R. Bauer C.E. Fujita Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1708: 229-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The Strep-tagged BchX protein (Strep-BchX) was purified from crude JNX extract by Strep-Tactin-Sepharose. Fig. 3 shows the CBB-stained protein profiles of crude JNX extract and purified Strep-BchX protein on SDS-PAGE (lanes 1 and 2). Purified Strep-BchX protein showed an apparent molecular mass of 39 kDa, which is in good agreement with the calculated molecular mass of 37,015 Da. Unlike Strep-BchX, purified Strep-tagged BchY (Strep-BchY) showed a doublet with apparent molecular masses of 54 and 55 kDa, which were at almost equimolar amounts as judged by CBB staining (Fig. 3, lane 4). The amino-terminal sequence of the upper band was ASWS, which matched the Strep-tag sequence without the amino-terminal Met, indicating that the upper band was Strep-BchY. The amino-terminal sequence of the lower band was MFLLD, which is identical to that of BchZ as deduced from the nucleotide sequence (Z11165), indicating that BchZ was co-purified with Strep-BchY. The mobility of the two proteins on SDS-PAGE was consistent with the calculated molecular mass of Strep-BchY (54,060 Da) and BchZ (53,217 Da). Similar yields of amino-terminal residues (3.3 pmol of Ala for Strep-BchY and 3.5 pmol of Met for BchZ) indicated that the BchY-BchZ complex forms in equimolar ratios of BchY and BchZ. This result provides the first experimental evidence that the BchY and BchZ proteins form a complex. Reconstitution of COR Activity in Purified Proteins—The purified proteins were examined for COR activity (Fig. 4). We devised an in vitro assay system, which is similar to the assay for DPOR activity (24Fujita Y. Bauer C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23583-23588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 25Nomata J. Swem L.R. Bauer C.E. Fujita Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1708: 229-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Purified BchX (0.95 μg) and purified BchY-BchZ (1.0 μg) were added individually or together to assay mixtures, which contained ATP, an ATP-regeneration system, sodium dithionite, and Chlide a. The reactions were incubated under anaerobic conditions. As shown in Fig. 4, the absorption spectrum of the substrate, Chlide a, was unaltered in the assay mixtures, which contained only one of the purified proteins, BchX or BchY-BchZ (Fig. 4, traces a and b). However, when both purified proteins were added to the assay mixture, a new pigment with a peak at 734 nm appeared, concomitant with a decrease in the Chlide a peak at 665 nm (Fig. 4, trace c). This result suggested that Chlide a was converted to a new pigment (P734) with a Qy peak of longer wavelength that was dependent on both protein components. Assuming that P734 is the expected product of the B-ring-reduced Chlide a, 3VBChlide, the amount of P734 that was formed and the amount of Chlide a that was used during the incubation period (50 min) were estimated to be 264 pmol and 243 pmol, respectively, supporting the equimolar conversion of Chlide a to P734. We also assessed whether ATP, as well as a reductant (sodium dithionite), were required for P734 formation. As shown in Fig. 5, P734 was not formed when ATP was omitted from the reaction (traces b and d). However, P734 was produced in the reaction without an ATP-regeneration system in amounts similar to the complete reaction system (trace c), and dithionite was necessary for the reaction (traces e and f). These results indicate that the formation of P734 is dependent on ATP and dithionite; however, it is not dependent on the ATP-regeneration syst"
https://openalex.org/W2111412643,"The requirement for Notch signaling in vasculogenesis and angiogenesis is well documented. In a previous study, we showed that activation of the Notch pathway in endothelial cells induces differentiation-associated growth arrest; however, the underlying mechanism remains to be elucidated. Here, we show that activation of the Notch pathway by either stimulation of cell surface Notch receptors with crosslinked soluble delta-like 4 (sDll4)/Jagged1 (sJag1) or constitutive expression of the Notch1 intracellular domain (N(IC)) suppresses endothelial cell proliferation. This suppression is mediated by the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathways. Following Notch1 activation, both pathways were suppressed in endothelial cells, and alterations in MAPK or PI3K/Akt pathway activity reversed Notch1-induced growth inhibition. Furthermore, we found the effect of Notch1 on endothelial cells to require Mastermind-like (MAML). Overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant of MAML1 antagonized the effects of activated Notch1 on the MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways. Ectopic expression of Hairy/Enhancer of Split 1 (HES1) consistently reproduced the inhibitory effect of N(IC) on endothelial cell proliferation. Together, our data demonstrate that the Notch/MAML-HES signaling cascade can regulate both MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways, which suggests a molecular mechanism for the inhibitory effect of Notch signaling on endothelial cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2028311411,"DNA interstrand cross-links (ICLs) are the most cytotoxic lesions to eukaryotic genome and are repaired by both homologous recombination-dependent and -independent mechanisms. To better understand the role of lesion bypass polymerases in ICL repair, we investigated recombination-independent repair of ICLs in REV3 and REV1 deletion mutants constructed in avian DT40 cells and mouse embryonic fibroblast cells. Our results showed that Rev3 plays a major role in recombination-independent ICL repair, which may account for the extreme sensitivity of REV3 mutants to cross-linking agents. This result raised the possibility that the NER gap synthesis, when encountering an adducted base present in the ICL repair intermediate, can lead to recruitment of Rev3, analogous to the recruitment of polymerase η during replicative synthesis. Indeed, the monoubiquitination-defective Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) mutant exhibits impaired recombination-independent ICL repair as well as drastically reduced mutation rate, indicating that the PCNA switch is utilized to enable lesion bypass during DNA repair synthesis. Analyses of a REV1 deletion mutant also revealed a significant reduction in recombination-independent ICL repair, suggesting that Rev1 cooperates with Rev3 in recombination-independent ICL repair. Moreover, deletion of REV3 or REV1 significantly altered the spectrum of mutations resulting from ICL repair, further confirming their involvement in mutagenic repair of ICLs.

Because an ICL compromises both strands of the double helix, recombination with an undamaged homologous sequence is required for error-free repair. This has been shown in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems (1Sladek F.M. Melian A. Howard-Flanders P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3982-3986Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 2Nojima K. Hochegger H. Alifhsein Saberi A. Fukushima H. Kikuchi K. Yoshimura K. Orelli B.J. Bishop D.K. Hirano S. Ohzeki M.

Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 11704-11711Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). However, ICL repair also occurs in a recombination-independent fashion. Our investigations in mammalian cells have suggested an NER- and translesion synthesis-based errorprone mechanism of ICL repair in which the gap created by the NER dual incisions is resynthesized through participation of lesion bypass DNA polymerases (3Zheng H.

A similar mechanism has been demonstrated in budding yeast, suggesting that recombination-independent ICL repair may be a highly conserved mechanism in eukaryotes (5Greenberg R.B. Alberti M.

The budding yeast mutants REV3 and REV1 are characterized by their marked reduction in UV-induced mutability (7Lemontt J.F. Genetics. 1971; 68: 21-33Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and profound sensitivity to ICLs during G1 or stationary phases. REV3 encodes the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase ζ (Polζ), a member of the B-type lesion bypass polymerase (8Nelson J.R. Lawrence D.W. Hinkle D.C. Science. 1996; 272: 1646-1649Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from REV3–/– embryos and an avian REV3–/– mutant exhibited severe sensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents (2Nojima K. Hochegger H. Alifhsein Saberi A.

Prakash S. Prakash L. Nature. 2000; 406: 1015-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). In addition, the C terminus of Rev1 interacts with a number of other translesion synthesis (TLS) polymerases, including Polζ (15Guo C. Fischhaber P.L. Luk-Paszyc M.J. Masuda Y. Zhou J. Kamiya K. Kisker C. Friedberg E.C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6621-6630Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 16Murakumo Y. Ogura Y. Ishii H. Numata S. Ichihara M. Croce C.M. Fishel R. Takahashi M. J. Biol.

This C-terminal region is essential for effective DNA damage tolerance, suggesting that it may have an important role in coordinating TLS (22Ross A.-L. Simpson L.J. Sale J.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 1280-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Although it is clearly established that loss of Rev3 and Rev1 leads to profound cross-link sensitivity, it is not clear whether Rev3 functions in recombination-dependent or -independent or other yet-to-be defined repair pathway(s). To elucidate the mechanism of lesion bypass processes during recombination-independent ICL repair, we analyzed a series of mammalian and avian mutants defective in the TLS process. In this report, we show that Polζ is likely the predominant lesion bypass polymerase in recombination-independent ICL repair, with its involvement facilitated by the monoubiquitination of PCNA. Deletion of REV1 also resulted in a major defect in recombination-independent ICL repair and reduced mutation formation, suggesting that Rev3 and Rev1 acts as one functional module during ICL repair. Cell Lines and Tissue Culture Conditions—REV3 mutant and wild-type MEF cells were maintained in minimal essentail medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. DT40 wild-type cells, DT40 REV3–/– cells, and REV1–/– cells were all cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum and 3% chicken serum. PCNA–/– DT40 cells complemented with human PCNA or human PCNA with the K164R substitution 3L. J. Simpson, A. L. Ross, D. Szüts, C. E. Edmonds, C. A. Alviani, and J. E. Sale, submitted for publication. were similarly maintained. Western blot was performed using an anti-PCNA monoclonal antibody (PC10, Abcam) to verify the expression of wild-type and mutant human PCNA in DT40 cells with endogenous PCNA deletion. Preparation of DNA Substrate with Defined ICLs—Preparation of site-specific psoralen- or mitomycin C (MMC)-cross-linked plasmid substrates has been described previously (3Zheng H. Wang X. Warren A.J. Legerski R.J. Nairn R.S. Hamilton J.W. Li L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 754-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 4Wang X. Peterson C.A. Zheng H. Nairn R.S. Legerski R.J. Li L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 713-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Specific to this study, the 18-mer oligonucleotides for generating psoralen-cross-linked plasmids were 5′-ggggGCTAGCggggcaca-3′, and 5′-ccccGCTAGCcccccaca-3′. Uppercase letters indicates an NheI restriction site containing the single psoralen target site TpA. The MMC-cross-linked plasmids were prepared with the 19-mer oligonucleotides 5′-tagatatcATCGATatagt-3′ and 5′tagactatATCGATgatat3′, which contains only one single CpG motif (embedded in a BspDI recognition site (uppercase)) for the formation of a single MMC-cross-link. Denaturing PAGE analysis of the purified cross-linked oligonucleotide and cross-linked plasmid substrates used in this study is shown in supplemental Fig. S1. Luciferase Reporter Reactivation Assay—This assay was performed essentially as described previously (3Zheng H. Wang X. Warren A.J. Legerski R.J. Nairn R.S. Hamilton J.W. Li L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 754-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 4Wang X. Peterson C.A. Zheng H. Nairn R.S. Legerski R.J. Li L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 713-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). For DT40 cells, the cross-linked reporter substrates were introduced by electroporation (Amaxa Nucleofector). The FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Diagnostics) was used for transient transfections into MEF cells. A β-galactosidase reporter plasmid was included in each sample as an internal control. Each experiment was repeated at least three times and the standard deviation is provided for each data point in the form of error bars. The linear range of luciferase activity was individually determined for each cell line. Mutation Analysis—For identification of ICL-induced mutations, psoralen-cross-linked pCMV-Luc plasmid (250 ng) was transfected into 5 × 105 MEF cells on a 60-mm plate or into 6.0 × 106 DT40 cells, respectively. Cells were harvested 30 h after transfection. Plasmid DNA was recovered by a modified alkaline lysis procedure (Hirt's extraction) and subsequently electroporated into the Escherichia coli AB2480 (uvrA, recA) mutant cells. The resulting colonies were lysed and directly amplified by PCR to generate a 234-bp fragment flanking the cross-linked region. The PCR products were digested with NheI (psoralen) or BspDI (MMC) to identify mutated plasmids that were resistant to cleavage. Mutated plasmids were further analyzed by DNA sequencing to reveal the exact nature of their mutations. To study ICL repair in vivo, we generated plasmid reporter substrates with a site-specific ICL placed between the CMV promoter and the initiation ATG of a luciferase reporter (4Wang X. Peterson C.A. Zheng H. Nairn R.S. Legerski R.J. Li L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 713-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Therefore, removal of ICLs can be monitored by expression of the luciferase gene, as the presence of the ICL constitutes an absolute block to luciferase gene transcription. Since undamaged homologous sequences were not supplied in the assay, this system measures primarily recombination-independent ICL repair (3Zheng H. Wang X. Warren A.J. Legerski R.J. Nairn R.S. Hamilton J.W. Li L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 754-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). To determine whether repair-proficient mouse and avian cells were capable of removing the ICL lesion, the cross-linked pCMV-Luc substrate was introduced into cells via transient transfection. In parallel, pCMV-Luc plasmid containing the unmodified oligonucleotide was also introduced in identically seeded cells. We normalized the luciferase activity of cells transfected with cross-linked plasmid against the luciferase activity of cells transfected with unmodified plasmid. The resulting ratio (repair efficiency) effectively controls for variations in transfection efficiency, gene transcription, and reporter protein accumulation from different cell lineages. Examination of two Rev3+/+ MEF cell lines generated from a p53–/– background showed that cells transfected with psoralen-cross-linked pCMV-Luc substrate exhibited significant luciferase expression resulting from ICL removal (25.9 and 33.4% repair efficiency, respectively) (Fig. 1A). Similarly, when psoralen- or MMC-cross-linked pCMV-Luc DNA substrates were transfected into the wild-type DT40 cell line, the ICL repair efficiency were 48 and 28%, respectively (Fig. 1B). Together, these results indicate that the recombination-independent ICL repair mechanism, first identified in human cells (3Zheng H. Wang X. Warren A.J. Legerski R.J. Nairn R.S. Hamilton J.W. Li L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 754-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 4Wang X. Peterson C.A. Zheng H. Nairn R.S. Legerski R.J. Li L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 713-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), operates in both mouse and avian cells. When two independent REV3–/– MEF cell lines were tested, we found that the ICL repair efficiency was drastically decreased (1.9 and 3.0%, respectively) (Fig. 1A). This result suggested that REV3 is a critical component in recombination-independent ICL repair. To further validate this result, we analyzed a REV3–/– DT40 mutant constructed by replacement targeting. Again, REV3 deletion substantially decreased the level of recombination-independent ICL repair with both psoralen- and MMC-cross-linked plasmid substrates (Fig. 1B). Taken together, these results strongly suggest that polymerase ζ plays a major role in recombination-independent ICL repair. Next, we asked whether Rev1 is also involved in the recombination-independent ICL repair. We examined a REV1–/– DT40 deletion mutant with both psoralen- and MMC-cross-linked luciferase substrates. As shown in Fig. 1C, loss of Rev1 clearly decreased repair efficiency, suggesting that Rev1 also has an important role in recombination-independent ICL repair. Eukaryotic mutants lacking REV3 display severe cross-link sensitivity. Interestingly, however, cells appear to maintain an extremely low level of Rev3. To date, the Rev3 protein remains undetectable by immunological means. A restricted Rev3 level can serve as a rate-limiting step for recombination-independent ICL repair. Hence, heterozygous loss of REV3 may have the potential to give rise to a haploinsufficiency phenotype. In addressing this question, we tested two REV3 heterozygous MEF cell lines (Fig. 1D). ICL repair efficiency in two of the REV3+/– clones was ∼50% of that in the REV3 wild-type cells, indeed suggesting a haploinsufficiency of the REV3+/– cells in recombination-independent ICL repair. This result is consistent with the notion that the level of Polζ might be one of the limiting factors for restricting the contribution of recombination-independent repair in overall ICL removal. ICL repair utilizing the recombination-independent mechanism depends on the dual incisions introduced by the NER excinucleases to create a gapped intermediate, which leads to the uncoupling of the double helix (Fig. 3). Normally, gaps derived from monoadduct lesions would be resynthesized by Polδ or Polϵ. However, a gap intermediate derived from an ICL would have the excised oligonucleotide attached to the single-stranded region by the remaining cross-linking moiety. Because neither Polδ nor Polϵ possesses effective lesion bypass activity (17Zhang Y. Wu X. Guo D. Rechkoblit O. Wang Z. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2002; 1: 559-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), gap repair synthesis would most likely be stalled by the remaining lesion. Presumably, Rev3 and/or Rev1 are required to extend repair synthesis over the remaining cross-linked nucleotide residue. However, a mechanistic link allowing Rev3 to interface with stalled NER repair synthesis is missing. We reasoned that the recruitment of Rev3 could be mediated by PCNA ubiquitination as has been shown during replicative lesion bypass at stalled replication forks (18Hoege C. Pfander B. Moldovan G.L. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S. Nature. 2002; 419: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (1740) Google Scholar, 19Kannouche P.L. Wing J. Lehmann A.R. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 491-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). To address this hypothesis, we constructed two DT40 cell lines with deletion of the endogenous PCNA gene but complemented by cDNA expression of the wild-type human PCNA (DT40hPCNA) or the PCNA K164R mutant (DT40hPCNAK164R) (Fig. 2B), which abolishes its monoubiquitination. When these two cell lines were tested for their recombination-independent ICL repair activities, cells expressing the PCNA K164R mutant showed a marked reduction (5.0% versus 19.1%) compared with cells expressing wild type PCNA (Fig. 2A). We conclude from this result that the recruitment of Rev3 for lesion bypass step during recombination-independent ICL repair is likely mediated by the monoubiquitinated form of PCNA. Thus, the polymerase switching function of monoubiquitinated PCNA, as originally noticed in replicative DNA synthesis, can be now extended to DNA repair synthesis.FIGURE 2A, ICL repair in DT40 cells with endogenous PCNA deletion and complemented by wild-type human PCNA and mutant human PCNA K164R.

Chem. 2001; 276: 31551-31560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) have shown in both mammalian and yeast systems that recombination-independent ICL repair is an error-prone mechanism. To further confirm the roles of REV3, REV1, and PCNA monoubiquitination in ICL repair, we determined whether the mutation spectrum is altered by the status of these genes. In our cross-linked luciferase reporter, thymine residues attached to the psoralen cross-link were located within an NheI restriction sequence, while guanine residues forming the MMC cross-link were located within a BspDI restriction sequence. Any mutations at or adjacent to the cross-linked thymine residues would result in inactivation of the cleavage sites. This design allowed us to rapidly screen for mutated plasmids and to subsequently reveal the nature of each mutation via DNA sequencing. As shown in Table 1, analysis of plasmids recovered from REV3 wild-type MEF and DT40 cells yielded mutation frequencies of 8.75 and 5.88%, respectively. Of the seven mutations identified in REV3+/+ MEF cells, four were T·A → C·G transitions and three were T·A → A·T transversions, with 1 having an additional mutation (A → T) immediately downstream of the cross-linked thymine residue. Similarly, of the six mutations found in REV3+/+ DT40 cells, three were T·A → C·G transitions, two were T·A → A·T transversions, and one was a double mutation (GC → CA) immediately downstream of the central TpA motif. In contrast, no mutations were found in clones recovered from REV3–/– MEF or REV3–/– DT40 deletion mutants. Only one mutation (a T·A → C·G transition) was found in 86 clones recovered from the REV1–/– mutant. Therefore, participation of Rev3 and Rev1 appears to account for a significant proportion of the mutations derived from recombination-independent ICL repair.TABLE 1Effects of REV 3 deletion, REV1 deletion, and PCNA mutation on ICL repair-induced mutagenesisCell lines and genotypeNo. of clones analyzedNo. of mutations identifiedMutation frequency%MEF REV3+/+8078.75MEF REV3-/-5600DT40 REV3+/+10265.88DT40 Rev3-/-6800DT40 Rev1-/-8611.16DT40 hPCNA7956.33DT40 hPCNA K164R7300 Open table in a new tab The mutation rate and the nature of mutations from the DT40-hPCNA cells closely resembles that of the parental wild type DT40 cells (Table 1 and data not shown), despite a noticeable difference in their ICL repair efficiency (19.1% versus 29.7%) (Fig. 2A), presumably due to the ectopic expression of PCNA from an exogenous promotor. However, no mutated pCMV-LUC plasmid was recovered from 73 colonies derived from cells expressing PCNA-K164R. This result further strengthened the notion that monoubiquitination of PCNA at lysine 164 is important for the error-prone ICL repair. Collectively, these results offer additional support for an ICL repair model in which Rev3 and Rev1 act in concert in bypassing processed ICL repair intermediate, similar to the sequential mode of action found in the yeast system (14Johnson R.E. Washington M.T. Haracska L. Prakash S. Prakash L. Nature. 2000; 406: 1015-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar), and PCNA monoubiquitination enables recruitment of the TLS components. Our group and others have recently demonstrated the error-prone recombination-independent ICL repair in both yeast and mammals. While the principle steps of this pathway are established, the lesion bypass components and how they engage in the lesion bypass step were not clear. The results we described provide firm answers to these questions. First, we show that Rev3 and Rev1 are the principle lesion-bypass components of this pathway. Second, initiation of the lesion bypass is controlled by monoubiquitination of PCNA at lysine 164. The latter conclusion also broadened the PCNA switch model of TLS from replicative synthesis to repair synthesis bypass. Our result showed that cells expressing monoubiquitination-defective PCNA exhibited a markedly reduced ICL repair capacity. Monoubiquitination of PCNA at lysine 164 is induced by a wide-array of DNA damaging reagent, including cross-linking agents (18Hoege C. Pfander B. Moldovan G.L. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S. Nature. 2002; 419: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (1740) Google Scholar). However, its role in facilitating lesion bypass has been shown only in replicative DNA synthesis when replication forks are stalled by monoadduct lesions (19Kannouche P.L. Wing J. Lehmann A.R. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 491-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). Our present study suggests that ICL repair synthesis also relies on PCNA monoubiquitination. Given that NER polymerases δ and ϵ both depend on PCNA and RFC for their function in NER (20Shivji K.K. Kenny M.K. Wood R.D. Cell. 1992; 69: 367-374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar), the repair synthesis machinery thus partially resembles the DNA replicative elongation complex. Combined together, it appears that the presence of stalled DNA polymerase along with RFC and monoubiquitinated PCNA may be sufficient to trigger a switching to lesion bypass polymerases. This notion is further supported by the finding that DNA template, RFC, and a properly loaded PCNA clamp is sufficient to initiate PCNA monoubiquitination (21Garg P. Burgers P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 18361-18366Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Our previous study with a human mutant (XP30RO) suggested that Polη has a role in recombination-independent ICL repair (3Zheng H. Wang X. Warren A.J. Legerski R.J. Nairn R.S. Hamilton J.W. Li L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 754-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). However, when comparing the XPV and the Rev3 mutants (3.3-fold versus 10-fold reduction in repair efficiency), it is quite clear that Rev3 loss resulted in a more severe deficit in ICL repair, suggesting that Polζ is the principle lesion bypass polymerase, while Polη may play a secondary role in moue and avian cells. Rev1 and Rev3 perform lesion bypass in a cooperative manner (14Johnson R.E. Washington M.T. Haracska L. Prakash S. Prakash L. Nature. 2000; 406: 1015-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Although we have shown that PCNA monoubiquitination is critical in ICL repair, it remains to be determined whether a direct interaction between PCNA and Rev3 is required to allow its recruitment. The unavailability of a Rev3 antibody precludes the possibility of examining such an interaction in mammalian cells by immunological means. However, recent work suggests that Rev1 may be able to allocate the Rev1/Rev3 module to the stalled repair synthesis site. Rev1 was found to interact directly with PCNA (22Ross A.-L. Simpson L.J. Sale J.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 1280-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and to co-localize with PCNA upon DNA damage (23Murakumo Y. Mizutani S. Yamaguchi M. Ichihara M. Takahashi M. Genes Cells. 2006; 11: 193-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Monoubiquitinated PCNA was found to directly stimulate Rev1-dependent single base addition, a step that precedes the Rev3-dependent extension (21Garg P. Burgers P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 18361-18366Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). More recently, the Y-family polymerases were found to possess ubiqintin-binding motifs (24Bienko M. Green C.M. Crosetto N. Rudolf F. Zapart G. Coull B. Kannouche P. Wider G. Peter M. Lehmann A.R. Hofmann K. Dikic I. Science. 2005; 310: 1821-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). In Rev1, this motif localizes precisely at the region required for Rev1 interaction with PCNA (22Ross A.-L. Simpson L.J. Sale J.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 1280-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 24Bienko M. Green C.M. Crosetto N. Rudolf F. Zapart G. Coull B. Kannouche P. Wider G. Peter M. Lehmann A.R. Hofmann K. Dikic I. Science. 2005; 310: 1821-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Hence, Rev1 may function as a key mediator for monoubiquitinated PCNA to promote Rev1/Rev3-dependent TLS during ICL repair. Collectively, our results help to further complete a model (Fig. 3) of recombination-independent ICL repair in mammalian cells by revealing the critical role of Rev3/Rev1 in this process and by showing that monoubiquitinated PCNA is required for the switch to the key step of lesion bypass during repair synthesis. Further enhancing this assertion, the ICL-induced mutagenic spectrum shifted correspondingly in cells bearing Rev3, Rev1, and PCNA mutations. While this paper was at the final stage of preparation, similar findings have been reported in budding yeast system (25Sarkar S. Davies A.A. Ulrich H.D. McHugh P.J. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1285-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), indicating that the recombination-independent ICL repair is a well conserved mechanism in eukaryotes.

https://openalex.org/W1997481684,"The two-pore domain K+ channel, TRESK (TWIK-related spinal cord K+ channel) is activated in response to the calcium signal by the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase, calcineurin. In the present study we report that calcineurin also interacts with TRESK via an NFAT-like docking site, in addition to its enzymatic action. In its intracellular loop, mouse TRESK possesses the amino acid sequence, PQIVID, which is similar to the calcineurin binding consensus motif, PXIXIT (where X denotes any amino acids), necessary for NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells) activation and nuclear translocation. Mutations of the PQIVID sequence of TRESK to PQIVIA, PQIVAD, or PQAVAD increasingly deteriorated the calcium-dependent activation in the listed order and correspondingly reduced the benzocaine sensitivity (a property discriminating activated channels from resting ones), when it was measured after the calcium signal in Xenopus oocytes. Microinjection of VIVIT peptide, designed to inhibit the NFAT-calcineurin interaction specifically, also eliminated TRESK activation. The intracellular loop of TRESK, expressed as a GST fusion protein, bound constitutively active calcineurin in vitro. PQAVAD mutation as well as addition of VIVIT peptide to the reaction abrogated this calcineurin binding.

These results indicate that the PQIVID sequence is a docking site for calcineurin, and its occupancy is required for the calcium-dependent regulation of TRESK.

We have recently reported that TRESK, expressed heterologously in Xenopus oocytes, is activated about 10-fold by the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase, calcineurin (3Czirják G.

Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28063-28070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Single channel activity of TRESK has recently been demonstrated in dorsal root ganglion neurons (8Kang D. Kim D. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; (in press)Google Scholar). In the absence of specific antibodies and inhibitors, TRESK has neither been identified at the protein level nor has it been detected as an endogenous whole cell current. However, the robust activation of TRESK by the calcium signal implicates that it can influence substantially the function of the native cells expressing the channel. The calcineurin-mediated regulation suggests that TRESK activation is the target of the widely used immunosuppressive drugs, cyclosporine A and FK506, as it was, in fact, demonstrated in Xenopus oocytes (3Czirják G. Tóth Z.E. Enyedi P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18550-18558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). These drugs inhibit calcineurin (and consequently NFAT activation and interleukin-2 production of T lymphocytes) by forming inhibitory complexes with the ubiquitous immunophilin proteins (9Clipstone N.A. Fiorentino D.F. Crabtree G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26431-26437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Snyder S.H. Sabatini D.M. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 32-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). However, general inhibition of calcineurin also causes several undesired effects. Therefore, a novel direction of drug development focuses on the NFAT-docking site of calcineurin, which is considered to be a more specific target than the phosphatase activity (11Martinez-Martinez S. Redondo J.M. Curr. Med. Chem. 2004; 11: 997-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 12Roehrl M.H. Wang J.Y. Wagner G. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 16067-16075Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The binding of calcineurin to the PXIXIT consensus motif (where X denotes any amino acid) is required for NFAT activation. Apart from NFAT, the only known mammalian proteins possessing similar calcineurin binding sites are calcineurin inhibitors/modulators or anchoring proteins (13Liu J.O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 311: 1103-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 14Dodge K.L. Scott J.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 311: 1111-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In the present study we report for the first time that an ion channel, TRESK, has an NFAT-like calcineurin binding consensus sequence and the binding of the phosphatase to this docking site is indispensable for the regulation of the channel. Therefore the inhibitors, designed to block the calcineurin-NFAT interaction specifically, may also interfere with TRESK activation. Materials—VIVIT peptide (NFAT inhibitor) and calcineurin autoinhibitory peptide (ITSFEEAKGLDRINERMPPRRDAMP) were purchased from Calbiochem, bovine calcineurin and calmodulin from Sigma. Enzymes and kits of molecular biology applications and all other chemicals of analytical grade were obtained from the companies listed elsewhere (3Czirják G. Tóth Z.E. Enyedi P. J. Biol.

GST-TRESK Loop Fusion Proteins—To produce GST-TRESKloop protein, the cDNA encoding the intracellular loop of mouse TRESK (amino acids 164–292) was PCR-amplified from our pEXO-TRESK plasmid (3Czirják G.

The PCR product was ligated into the XhoI site of pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences, Little Chalfont, UK). To obtain the longer GST-TRESKloop-TAPtag protein, TRESK loop was amplified with Loop-s1 and Loop-a2 oligonucleotides. The PCR product was cloned into the pcDNA3-TAPtag plasmid (Séraphin Laboratory, EMBL, Heidelberg, Germany). The fused TRESKloop-TAPtag coding region was amplified with the Loop-s2/TAP-a primer combination and ligated into the SalI site of pGEX-6P-3 (Amersham Biosciences).

Bacteria were sonicated in buffer A, containing in mm: 50 NaCl, 50 KCl, 1 EDTA, 1 PMSF, 0.1 benzamidine, 1 dithiothreitol, 50 Tris-HCl (pH 7.6). The lysate was centrifuged and the GST fusion protein was affinity-purified from the supernatant by glutathione-agarose (Sigma). Recombinant, Constitutively Active Calcineurin—The hexahistidine-tagged constitutively active calcineurin was produced by a modification of the methods reported previously (15Mondragon A.

Bacteria were sonicated in buffer B, containing: 200 NaCl, 2 MgCl2, 1 EGTA, 5.5 β-mercaptoethanol, 30 phosphate (pH 7.8 with NaOH), supplemented with 1 PMSF, 0.2 benzamidine, 5 imidazole (in mm) and 30 soybean trypsin inhibitor (type IIS, Sigma), 16 leupeptin, 11 aprotinin (in μg/ml). The lysate was centrifuged, and the protein was purified from the supernatant by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen); after binding for 1 h the resin was washed six times with 14 ml of buffer B, containing 0, 20, and 50 mm imidazole, in the first, second, and third pair of washing steps, respectively. Calcineurin was eluted by 5 × 0.5 ml of 250 mm imidazole in buffer B and dialyzed against 140 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.3) and stored at –70 °C. GST Pulldown Assay—Ten μl of the 50% resin suspension of the appropriate GST fusion protein was incubated for 1 h with or without full-length bovine calcineurin (1.5 μg), recombinant constitutively active calcineurin (5–10 μg), calmodulin (2.5 μg), VIVIT peptide (200 μm), calcineurin autoinhibitory peptide (200 μm), CaCl2 (0.25 mm), in the presence of 1% Triton X-100. The final volume was adjusted with a buffer containing (in mm): 50 NaCl, 50 KCl and 50 Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) (plus 1 mm EDTA in the reactions containing recombinant calcineurin). The resin was washed twice with 150 μl of assay buffer, also containing 1% Triton X-100 in the first wash, and 0.3 mm CaCl2 if full-length calcineurin was used. The bound proteins were analyzed on 12% polyacrylamide gels stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue or silver, according to Heukeshoven and Dernick (19Heukeshoven J. Dernick R. Electrophoresis. 1988; 9: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). Handling of Xenopus laevis Oocytes and Two-electrode Voltage Clamp Measurements—The oocytes were prepared, the cRNA was synthesized, and microinjected and two-electrode voltage clamp measurements were performed as described previously (3Czirják G. Tóth Z.E. Enyedi P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18550-18558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The low [K+] solution contained (in mm): 95.4 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 5 HEPES (pH 7.5 with NaOH). The high [K+] solution contained 80 mm K+ (78 mm Na+ of the low [K+] solution was replaced with K+). The voltage protocol for measuring TRESK current and the calcium-activated chloride current simultaneously was as following: –100 mV for 300 ms, 0 mV for 250 ms, and +20 mV for 300 ms, applied every 3 s from a holding potential of 0 mV. TRESK current and the calcium-activated chloride current (ICl,Ca) were measured at the end of the voltage steps to –100 mV and +20 mV, respectively. As we reported previously (20Czirják G. Fischer T. Spät A. Lesage F. Enyedi P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 863-874PubMed Google Scholar, 21Czirják G. Petheö G.L. Spät A. Enyedi P. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C700-C708Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), ICl,Ca at –100 mV in 80 mm [K+] was negligible compared with the robust K+ current of expressed 2PK+ channels. Thus ICl,Ca was estimated by applying voltage steps to +20 mV, which is close to the K+ equilibrium potential. The initial ICl,Ca could be measured independently from the K+ current, since TRESK activation was delayed compared with the onset of ICl,Ca. All treatments of the animals were conducted in accordance with state laws and institutional regulations. The experiments were approved by the Animal Care and Ethics Committee of the Semmelweis University. Statistics and Calculations—Data are expressed as means ± S.E. Statistical significance was estimated by t test for dependent or independent samples, one-way ANOVA or two-way repeated measures ANOVA and Scheffe's test for pairwise post hoc comparisons using the Statistica 6.0 program package (StatSoft, Tulsa, OK). The difference was considered to be significant at p < 0.05. Free [Ca2+] was calculated with Chelator program (written by Theo J. M. Schoenmakers, University of Nijmegen, Nijmegen, The Netherlands). Some sequence operations (e.g. automatic design of silent mutations to QuikChange primers for selecting the mutant clones) were performed with the sequence-handling program “SeqHandler” developed in our laboratory. The Local Anesthetic Benzocaine Distinguishes Activated TRESK from the Resting Channels—Reduced stimulation of a mutant TRESK channel by the calcium signal may reflect the impaired mechanism of calcineurin-dependent activation. However, a constitutively active mutant channel, which is nearly maximally active even under basal conditions, is also expected to be unresponsive to the calcium signal. To discriminate between these two mutant types, we searched for a pharmacological tool, which affects distinctly the basal and the calcineurin-activated currents. TRESK current was measured in 80 mm extracellular K+ concentration at –100 mV with the two-electrode voltage clamp technique. The calcium signal evoked by ionomycin (0.5 μm) resulted in a 9.4 ± 1-fold activation of TRESK (n = 5). Benzocaine (1 mm) inhibited TRESK current significantly less before (13 ± 2%) than after the application of ionomycin (51 ± 1%, p < 0.001, Student's t test for dependent samples, Fig. 1). This indicates that benzocaine inhibits stimulated wild type TRESK preferentially and it can be applied to determine, whether a given macroscopic TRESK current is constituted by resting or activated channels. We also tested the effect of benzocaine on S276A mutant TRESK, which had been reported to be a constitutively active form of the channel, being unresponsive to the calcium signal (3Czirják G. Tóth Z.E. Enyedi P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18550-18558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The resting current of S276A TRESK was inhibited by benzocaine (51 ± 1%, n = 6, Fig. 1B) identically to the current of the activated wild type channel. The strong inhibition of S276A mutant verified that benzocaine could be used for differentiating the two types of mutant TRESK channels, both of which are characterized by apparent insensitivity to the calcium signal. The constitutively active TRESK mutants are expected to be inhibited more effectively by the local anesthetic than the mutants of really impaired activation. Mutations of the PQIVID Sequence of TRESK Prevent the Calcium-dependent Activation—In its intracellular loop, mouse TRESK possesses the PQIVID sequence (amino acids 210–215), which is highly similar to the calcineurin binding consensus motif (PXIXIT) of NFAT proteins. To examine the role of this motif in the calcium-dependent regulation, different mutants of TRESK channel were created by replacing distinct amino acid residues of the PQIVID sequence with alanines. Since the mutation of a proline residue often results in major structural changes and apart from the proline only the two isoleucines match directly to the PXIXIT consensus motif, we mutated one or both of these isoleucines (PQIVAD and PQAVAD mutants). In addition, we also examined the PQIVIA mutant to elucidate whether the aspartate residue, which does not correspond to the NFAT consensus motif, can substitute for the threonine and strengthen the binding to calcineurin. Expression of all the mutants yielded functional channels in Xenopus oocytes; however, their responses to the calcium signal, evoked by the calcium ionophore ionomycin, were affected (Fig. 2A). The response of the PQIVIA mutant was attenuated (4.1 ± 0.3-fold activation (n = 5) in contrast to the 7.5 ± 0.6-fold (n = 6) increase of the wild type), suggesting that the aspartate residue promoted the binding of calcineurin, and its mutation to alanine decreased the affinity to the phosphatase. Mutation of the second isoleucine of the motif (PQIVAD mutation) strongly reduced the ionomycin-evoked activation (only 1.6 ± 0.1-fold increase, n = 5). The mutation of both critical isoleucines (PQAVAD) had an even stronger effect; the calcium-dependent regulation was completely eliminated (1.1 ± 0.1-fold current after the stimulation, n = 5, Fig. 2A). The reduced response of the mutant channels to the calcium signal suggests that the PQIVID sequence of TRESK, similarly to the PXIXIT motifs of NFAT proteins, is a functionally important calcineurin docking site. In the same experiment, by applying our newly discovered pharmacological tool, benzocaine, we also demonstrated that the mutations of the PQIVID sequence really interfered with the process of activation and did not render TRESK constitutively active. The benzocaine sensitivity, measured after the ionomycin stimulation, was reduced in line with the smaller responsiveness to the calcium signal. Whereas the wild type TRESK current was inhibited by 57 ± 2% (n = 5), the sensitivity of the PQIVIA, PQIVAD, and PQAVAD mutants was attenuated (44 ± 1% inhibition, n = 5), strongly reduced (23 ± 1%, n = 5), and decreased nearly to the level characteristic for the resting channels (18 ± 1%, n = 5), respectively (Fig. 2A). These pharmacological data confirm the conclusion that the more severe is the perturbation of the binding motif, the more impaired is the interaction with calcineurin, and consequently, the higher fraction of the mutant channels remains in the resting state after the calcium signal. To verify that the different levels of activation of TRESK mutants were not due to the difference in the calcium signal, we measured the endogenous calcium-activated chloride current (ICl,Ca), reflecting the cytoplasmic [Ca2+] of the oocytes. The amplitude of ICl,Ca, measured at +20 mV in 80 mm extracellular [K+], 9–15 s after the administration of ionomycin, was not significantly different in the oocytes expressing the different TRESK mutants (data not shown). This indicates that the reduced activation of TRESK mutants was not the consequence of the altered Ca2+ homeostasis of the cell, but it was the inherent property of the mutant channels. The Activation of the PQIVID Mutants Is Reduced Irrespective of the Mechanism of the Calcium Signal—The levels of activation of the wild type and mutant TRESK channels were also compared, when the calcium signal was induced in a more physiological manner, by stimulation of M1 muscarinic ACh receptors, coexpressed with the channel. Whereas carbachol (1 μm) activated wild type TRESK efficiently, the response of the PQIVIA, PQIVAD, and PQAVAD mutants were attenuated, strongly reduced and eliminated, respectively (Fig. 2B), as in the case of stimulation with ionomycin. These results suggest that the receptor-mediated activation of TRESK also depends on the binding of calcineurin to the PQIVID motif. In Xenopus oocytes, ionomycin increases the cytoplasmic [Ca2+] mainly by releasing the ion from intracellular stores (22Yoshida S. Plant S. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1992; 458: 307-318Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and the stimulation of M1 receptor also results in calcium release. To activate TRESK independently from the calcium stores, the cytoplasmic [Ca2+] was controlled directly by microinjecting a saturated calcium buffer of high (50 mm Ca2+ plus 50 mm EGTA) concentration. The order of responsiveness of wild type TRESK and the PQIVID mutants to the microinjection was the same as those obtained with ionomycin and carbachol (Fig. 2C). This indicates that the activation of TRESK may generally rely on the intact PQIVID motif in the case of calcium signals of different source and kinetics. Microinjection of VIVIT Peptide Eliminates the Calcineurin-dependent Activation of TRESK—The sequence of VIVIT peptide (MAGPH-PVIVITGPHEE) was optimized for the highest affinity toward the NFAT binding site of calcineurin (23Aramburu J. Yaffe M.B. Lopez-Rodriguez C. Cantley L.C. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Science. 1999; 285: 2129-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). To provide a further in vivo evidence for TRESK-calcineurin interaction in addition to TRESK mutants, we also attempted to block the interaction by saturating the NFAT binding site of calcineurin with VIVIT peptide. Xenopus oocytes expressing wild type TRESK were microinjected with the peptide and subsequently challenged with ionomycin. These oocytes failed to respond with TRESK activation to the stimulation (Fig. 3A). The effective inhibition indicated that VIVIT peptide occupied the NFAT-docking site of calcineurin and thus prevented the binding of the intracellular loop of TRESK, which would have normally interacted with the same region of the phosphatase. The dependence of TRESK regulation on calcineurin raised the question whether the basal K+ current was also the result of the calcineurin activity in the resting cell. To suppress the resting calcineurin activity by reducing the cytoplasmic calcium concentration to subphysiological levels, EGTA was microinjected to the oocytes expressing TRESK, and the background K+ current was measured before and after the microinjection. It was reported previously (3Czirják G. Tóth Z.E. Enyedi P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18550-18558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) that the 50-nl injection of a high (50 mm) concentration of EGTA was sufficient (even after the estimated 10-fold dilution of the chelator in the cytoplasm) to eliminate the calcium-dependent TRESK activation. However, an identical EGTA injection failed to influence unstimulated TRESK (Fig. 3B), indicating that a calcium-dependent calcineurin activity did not contribute to the maintenance of the basal TRESK current. As an alternative approach to extinguish the possible basal calcineurin action on TRESK independently from calcium, the TRESK-interacting surface of calcineurin was blocked with VIVIT peptide. The microinjection of VIVIT peptide did not reduce the basal TRESK current (Fig. 3B), also confirming that calcineurin was not required for the resting TRESK activity. The PQIVID Motif of TRESK Binds Constitutively Active Calcineurin Permanently and Wild Type Calcineurin Calcium/Calmodulin-dependently—To demonstrate the direct binding of the PQIVID motif of TRESK to calcineurin, GST pulldown experiments were performed with a GST-TRESKloop-TAPtag fusion protein (see “Experimental Procedures”), immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads. The constitutively active form of calcineurin (A subunit lacking the autoinhibitory domain and the calmodulin binding site but complexed with B subunit) was incubated with this resin. The characteristic band of the truncated calcineurin A could be easily detected with Coomassie Blue staining (compare lanes 1 and 2 in Fig. 4A) if all proteins bound to the resin were analyzed on SDS-PAGE. To verify that calcineurin actually bound to the PQIVID sequence, the experiment was carried out with the PQAVAD mutant version of GST-TRESKloop-TAPtag under identical conditions. In good accordance with the results obtained in the oocyte experiments, the PQAVAD mutant GST-TRESKloop-TAPtag did not bind the constitutively active calcineurin at all (compare lanes 3 and 4 in Fig. 4A). Moreover, the addition of VIVIT peptide (200 μm) to the binding reaction of the “wild type” (PQIVID) GST-TRESKloop-TAPtag also eliminated the association with the constitutively active calcineurin (Fig. 4B). These experiments indicate unequivocally that calcineurin binds directly and specifically to the PQIVID motif of TRESK. To gain further insight into the regulation of TRESK-calcineurin interaction, we also examined the binding of the full-length version of the phosphatase to the PQIVID motif. Since the calcineurin purified from bovine brain has a larger molecular weight than its truncated recombinant counterpart, the smaller GST-TRESKloop protein could be used in this pull-down experiment. Apparently, full-length calcineurin bound to GST-TRESKloop more strongly in the presence of the calcium/calmodulin complex, and the specificity of this binding was also verified by the inhibitory effect of VIVIT peptide (Fig. 4C). Thus the affinity of wild type calcineurin to the PQIVID motif is enhanced by the activation of the phosphatase, and calcineurin may be recruited to TRESK during the physiological activation by the calcium/calmodulin complex. The Calcineurin Autoinhibitory Peptide Diminishes TRESK Activation but Does Not Interfere with the Binding of Calcineurin to the PQIVID Motif—As the binding of calcineurin to the PQIVID motif was indispensable for TRESK activation, the question emerged whether this binding was sufficient on its own or whether the phosphatase activity of calcineurin was also required for the regulation. To suppress the phosphatase activity without occluding the protein-protein interaction, a peptide corresponding to the autoinhibitory domain (467–491 amino acids) of calcineurin was microinjected. This microinjection inhibited the ionomycin-induced activation of wild type TRESK (Fig. 5A), suggesting that the phosphatase activity of endogenous calcineurin was required for TRESK activation. To demonstrate that the autoinhibitory peptide did not influence the binding of calcineurin to the PQIVID motif, recombinant constitutively active calcineurin was used. We reported previously that the coexpression of the truncated calcineurin A subunit (1–398 amino acids, devoid of the autoinhibitory domain) and full-length calcineurin B with TRESK resulted in permanent activation of the channel (3Czirják G. Tóth Z.E. Enyedi P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18550-18558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Inhibition of the phosphatase activity by the reintroduction of the autoinhibitory domain by peptide microinjection substantially reduced the otherwise permanently stimulated TRESK current (Fig. 5B). On the other hand, the autoinhibitory peptide, blocking only the active site of the phosphatase, did not influence the binding of the constitutively active calcineurin to the PQIVID motif in our GST pulldown experiments (compare lanes 3 and 4 in Fig. 5C). The reduction of TRESK current by the selective inhibition of the phosphatase activity supports the conclusion that dephosphorylation is also required for TRESK regulation in addition to the binding of calcineurin to the PQIVID motif. Several proteins are substrates of calcineurin (24Klee C.B. Ren H. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13367-13370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar); however, only a small subset of them interacts directly with the calcium/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase through an NFAT-like docking site (13Liu J.O.

Chem. 2003; 278: 15550-15557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Previously, we demonstrated unequivocally that the calcium-dependent regulation of the two-pore domain K+ channel, TRESK, is mediated by calcineurin (3Czirják G. Tóth Z.E. Enyedi P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18550-18558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Alanine scanning mutagenesis of all intracellular serine and threonine residues of TRESK indicated that Ser276, located in the intracellular loop, is a likely candidate for dephosphorylation, since the S276A mutation, mimicking the dephosphorylated state, rendered the channel constitutively active (3Czirják G. Tóth Z.E. Enyedi P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18550-18558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In the present study we report another aspect of TRESK-calcineurin interaction. In addition to the enzyme-substrate relation, calcineurin also binds to the NFAT-like PQIVID motif of mouse TRESK. This binding motif does not resemble the sites dephosphorylated by calcineurin at all and it has been shown in the case of NFAT proteins that a surface of the phosphatase, other than the substrate binding region, connects to PXIXIT motifs (28Li H. Rao A. Hogan P.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 342: 1659-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Interestingly, our GST pulldown experiments indicated that the regulation of calcineurin activity essentially influenced TRESK-calcineurin interaction. The constitutively active calcineurin devoid of the autoinhibitory domain bound to the PQIVID motif permanently. In contrast, the binding of the wild type enzyme required (or at least it was enhanced drastically by) the presence of calcium/calmodulin complex. This substantial change of affinity may result in the shuttling of calcineurin between the cytoplasm and the PQIVID site during the calcium signal. Beyond the in vitro results, we provided compelling evidence that the association of the two proteins is indispensable for the regulation of TRESK in Xenopus oocytes. The channel was activated efficiently by endogenous calcineurin, and the activation evolved even if TRESK was expressed by injecting only a trace amount of cRNA (data not shown). Thus TRESK-calcineurin interaction developed without the overexpression of the interacting partners. Identification of the well defined NFAT-like motif also made it very unlikely that TRESK and calcineurin interacted only by chance in our heterologous expression system. The intracellular loops of the human and mouse TRESK orthologues show only limited similarity. Still, the PQIVID motif aligns exceptionally well to the PQIIIS sequence of human TRESK, and the two channels are activated identically by the calcium signal, indicating that the binding mechanism of calcineurin is evolutionary conserved. In the present medical practice of organ transplantation, the phosphatase activity of calcineurin is inhibited for immunosuppression. To eliminate the side effects of these treatments, significant effort has been made to develop compounds, which inhibit NFAT activation but not the phosphatase activity of calcineurin in general. In addition to VIVIT peptide (23Aramburu J. Yaffe M.B. Lopez-Rodriguez C. Cantley L.C. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Science. 1999; 285: 2129-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar), a family of small molecule inhibitors blocking the NFAT binding site of calcineurin has also been discovered (12Roehrl M.H. Wang J.Y. Wagner G. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 16067-16075Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This novel class of inhibitors (and possibly future drugs) is also expected to prevent TRESK activation, in addition to the presently used immunosuppressive agents, since TRESK and NFAT are complexed with calcineurin by the same mechanism. Further research, elucidating the exact physiological role of TRESK, will be required to determine, whether this cross-reaction is advantageous or disadvantageous therapeutically. Elimination of TRESK regulation may cause undesired symptoms or it may have an auxiliary immunosuppressive effect, considering the reported expression of the channel in thymus and spleen.

The mechanism that accommodates this extended and variable promoter architecture is unknown, but one model suggests that RNAP II forms an open promoter complex near the TATA box and then scans the template DNA strand for start sites. Unlike most protein-coding genes, small nuclear RNA gene transcription starts predominantly at a single position. We identify a highly efficient initiator element as the primary start site determinant for the yeast U4 small nuclear RNA gene, SNR14. Consistent with the scanning model, transcription of an SNR14 allele with tandemly duplicated start sites initiates primarily from the upstream site, yet the downstream site is recognized with equivalent efficiency by the diminished population of RNAP II molecules that encounter it. A quantitative in vivo assay revealed that SNR14 initiator efficiency is nearly perfect (∼90%), which explains the precision of U4 RNA 5′ end formation. Initiator efficiency was reduced by cis-acting mutations at –8, –7, –1, and +1 and trans-acting substitutions in the TFIIB B-finger.

Eukaryotes rely on RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) 2The abbreviations used are: RNAP II, RNA polymerase II; snRNA, small nuclear RNA; snoRNA, small nucleolar RNA; PIC, pre-initiation complex; TF, transcription factor; RT, reverse transcription. 2The abbreviations used are: RNAP II, RNA polymerase II; snRNA, small nuclear RNA; snoRNA, small nucleolar RNA; PIC, pre-initiation complex; TF, transcription factor; RT, reverse transcription. to synthesize all messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and most of the small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) and small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) encoded within their nuclear genomes. Efficient and accurate transcription initiation is vital to ensure the proper expression and function of these RNAs. The recruitment of RNAP II to gene promoters is mediated through the assembly of a pre-initiation complex (PIC). RNAP II accessory proteins provide promoter specificity and the structural core for assembly of the PIC. These accessory proteins include the general transcription factors TFIID, TFIIB, TFIIF, TFIIE, and TFIIH (1Orphanides G. Lagrange T. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2657-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar, 2Hampsey M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 465-503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Hahn S. Nat. Struct. Mol.

Biochem. 2003; 72: 449-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar); one of the most fundamental interactions for PIC assembly is between the TATA-binding protein subunit of TFIID and the TATA box (5Buratowski S. Hahn S. Sharp P.A. Guarente L. Nature. 1988; 334: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 6Nakajima N. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4028-4040Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). In a stepwise model for PIC assembly, TATA-binding protein binding is followed by the addition of TFIIB, RNAP II-TFIIF, TFIIE, and TFIIH (7Buratowski S. Hahn S. Guarente L. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1989; 56: 549-561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar).In metazoans, the assembly of a PIC at the TATA box results in start site selection 25–30 bp downstream (4Smale S.T. Kadonaga J.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 449-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). The architecture of the PIC is such that the transcription start site is placed precisely within the active center of RNAP II (8Leuther K.K. Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1996; 85: 773-779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 9Bushnell D.A. Westover K.D. Davis R.E. Kornberg R.D. Science. 2004; 303: 983-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, RNAPII initiation typically occurs at multiple sites at variable distances from the TATA box, with most start sites ranging from 40 to 120 bp downstream of the TATA box (10Struhl K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 1051-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The initiation mechanism that accommodates this extended and variable promoter architecture is unknown, but it does not appear to be dependent on assembling the yeast PIC in a manner different from that of metazoans. Yeast promoter melting has been shown to begin at the same position as in metazoans, ∼20 bp downstream of the TATA box (11Giardina C. Lis J.T. Science. 1993; 261: 759-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In addition, the ∼30-bp distance between the TATA box and RNAP II active center has been confirmed through structural analysis of yeast PICs (8Leuther K.K. Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1996; 85: 773-779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 9Bushnell D.A. Westover K.D. Davis R.E. Kornberg R.D. Science. 2004; 303: 983-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). A scanning model for start site selection has been proposed for yeast (11Giardina C. Lis J.T. Science. 1993; 261: 759-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In this scanning model a PIC assembles at a TATA box, the DNA is melted, and RNAP II translocates downstream searching the template strand for acceptable start sites.The initial sequence comparisons and mutational analysis of a relatively small set of yeast mRNA genes helped define three related yeast start site consensus sequences, RRYRR, TCRA, and YA(A/T)R in the non-template strand, where the initiation site is underlined, Y is pyrimidine, and R is purine (12Hahn S. Hoar E.T. Guarente L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8562-8566Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 13Healy A.M. Helser T.L. Zitomer R.S. Mol. Cell.

Recently, an alignment of sequences flanking 4637 yeast transcription start sites has provided a more refined consensus sequence: A(Arich)5NYA(A/T)NN(Arich)6 (15Zhang Z. Dietrich F.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 2838-2851Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The DNA sequences encompassing yeast transcription start sites are sometimes termed initiator elements. In metazoans the initiator is defined as a core promoter element distinct from the TATA box that nucleates PIC assembly and is sufficient for accurate transcription (16Smale S.T. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 57: 103-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar). Although there is evidence to suggest that some yeast initiators may function in this way (17Sakurai H. Ohishi T. Fukasawa T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6819-6828Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 18Ohishi-Shofuda T. Suzuki Y. Yano K. Sakurai H. Fukasawa T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 255: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar), most appear to play a more limited role in transcriptional control and influence accuracy but not overall efficiency (2Hampsey M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 465-503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).It seems likely that the recognition and efficient utilization of yeast start sites involves a sequence-specific interaction between the yeast initiator element and either RNAP II, an accessory protein, or both. RNAP II and TFIIB have been shown to dictate the distance from TATA boxes to start sites in yeast (19Li Y. Flanagan P.M. Tschochner H. Kornberg R.D. Science. 1994; 263: 805-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). TFIIB substitutions that confer downstream shifts in yeast start site selection map to the “B-finger” domain, which encompasses residues 55–88 of the N-terminal region (9Bushnell D.A. Westover K.D. Davis R.E. Kornberg R.D. Science. 2004; 303: 983-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 20Pinto I. Ware D.E. Hampsey M.

Chem. 1998; 273: 17859-17864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The promoter sequence immediately upstream of yeast start sites can influence the severity with which TFIIB B-finger substitutions alter start site selection (23Faitar S.L. Brodie S.A. Ponticelli A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4427-4440Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). A yeast RNAP II-TFIIB crystal structure model shows the TFIIB B-finger inserted through the RNA exit pore into the polymerase active site, suggesting that start site selection may be mediated by a direct interaction between the B-finger and promoter DNA (9Bushnell D.A. Westover K.D. Davis R.E. Kornberg R.D. Science. 2004; 303: 983-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar).Here we report the characterization of cis- and trans-acting determinants of start site selection at the yeast U4 snRNA gene, SNR14. In contrast to the heterogeneous transcription start site selection exhibited at most mRNA genes, yeast snRNAs typically have one major start site, thus providing a model system for the study of accurate initiation. We identified a highly efficient initiator element within the SNR14 promoter, defined the positions most critical for its function in start site selection, and quantified its efficiency relative to other initiator sequences. Substitutions within the TFIIB B-finger genetically interact with SNR14 initiator mutations in a sequence-dependent manner. Quantitative analysis of the utilization of tandemly duplicated initiator elements strongly supports the proposed scanning model for yeast transcription start site selection and demonstrates that scanning by RNAP II is processive.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmid Construction—SNR14 (positions –224 to +701, relative to +1 transcription start site) was cloned by PCR amplification of a genomic DNA template isolated from yeast strain PJ43–2b and ligated into the BamHI site of pRS313 (CEN4, ARS1, HIS3). 5′ end truncation constructs were generated by the same method but using pRS313-SNR14 as the template. pRS313-SNR14-StDup was created by using QuikChange PCR mutagenesis (Stratagene) to insert 14 bp of DNA (–13 to +1 relative to SNR14 start site) between positions +1 and +2of pRS313-SNR14, creating an overlapping 20-bp duplication. pRS317 (LYS2)-SUA7 contains the entire SUA7 promoter and coding region (TFIIB gene) and was constructed by ligation of the ClaI/SacI fragment of pRS314 (TRP1)-yIIBN (kindly provided by A. Ponticelli, State University of New York at Buffalo) into pRS317 (LYS2). TFIIB expressed from these constructs contains an N-terminal hexahistidine tag. All mutations within pRS313-SNR14-StDup and pRS317-SUA7 were created using the QuikChange method (Stratagene). pRS316 (URA3)-SNR14, SUA7 was constructed by ligating a PCR-amplified region of SNR14 (–224 to + 701) into the SalI/XhoI sites of pRS316 (URA3)-yIIBN (kindly provided by A. Ponticelli, State University of New York at Buffalo). Oligonucleotide sequences are available upon request.Yeast Strains—Genomic DNA isolated from PJ43–2b (MATα trp1 ura3 can1 leu2 his3 ade2 met2 lys2; kindly provided by P. James and E. Craig, University of Wisconsin at Madison) was used for the cloning of full-length SNR14. YKS2 (MATa trp1 his3 ura3 ade2 lys2 snr14::TRP1 YCp50 (URA3)-SNR14; kindly provided by K. Shannon and C. Guthrie, University of California at San Franscisco) has been described previously (24Shannon K.W. Guthrie C. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 773-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). JNK1 (MATa trp1 his3 ura3 ade2 lys2 snr14::TRP1 sua7::KANMX4 pRS316 (URA3)-SNR14, SUA7) was derived from YKS2 by the following manipulations. YKS2 was transformed with pRS313-SNR14 and pRS317-SUA7 by the lithium acetate procedure (25Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Willems A.R. Woods R.A. Yeast. 1995; 11: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1679) Google Scholar). His+Lys+ clones were transformed with 5 μgof SUA7::KANMX4 and plated on yeast extract-peptone-dextrose plus 200 mg/liter G418 (Invitrogen). The SUA7::KANMX4 product was obtained by PCR using genomic DNA template from a diploid strain heterozygous for a KANMX4-disrupted allele of SUA7 (Invitrogen). Integrants were confirmed by PCR using genomic DNA isolated from KanR colonies. Integrant strains were transformed with pRS316 (URA3)-SNR14, SUA7 and grown on medium lacking uracil. Loss of pRS313-SNR14 and pRS317-SUA7 was confirmed by replica plating onto –his and –lys medium, thus creating JNK1. Plasmid-borne alleles of SNR14 and SUA7 in pRS313 and pRS317, respectively, were transformed into JNK1 by standard plasmid shuffle techniques (26Boeke J.D. Trueheart J. Natsoulis G. Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 164-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar). Loss of pRS316 (URA3)-SNR14, SUA7 was selected for on medium containing 0.75 mg/ml of 5-fluoroorotic acid.DNase I Chromatin Footprinting—Chromatin footprinting was performed as previously described (27Hull M.W. Thomas G. Huibregtse J.M. Engelke D.R. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 35: 383-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) using the yeast strain PJ43–2b. After digestion of lysed yeast cells or purified genomic DNA with DNase I (Invitrogen), cleavage sites on the non-template strand of the SNR14 promoter were mapped by primer extension using 32P-labeled oligo U4-14C, which is complementary to non-template strand residues +32 to +51. Sequencing ladders were generated by primer extension of genomic DNA using 32P-labeled oligo U4-14C and a dNTP mix containing dideoxy-ATP or -GTP.RNA Analysis—Total cellular RNA was isolated using the guanidinium thiocyanate method including a 65 °C phenol extraction (28Wise J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 405-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Reverse transcription for the determination of the Sec3 mRNA-processing sites was performed in a 50-μl reaction volume containing 5 μg of total RNA from strain PJ43–2b, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 8 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 11 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm dNTPs, 40 units of RNasin (Promega), 250 pmol of T16-EcoR1 oligo, and 37.5 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (United States Biochemical). cDNA synthesis proceeded at 42 °C for 1 h. Ten μl of the 50-μl RT reaction was used as a template for PCR in a 100-μl volume containing 20 mm (NH4)2SO4, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), 0.75 mm MgCl2, 50 pmol of T16-EcoR1 oligo, 100 pmol of SEC3-RT-PCR oligo, and 1 unit of MasterAmp™ Tfl DNA polymerase (Epicentre). Each PCR cycle consisted of a denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 42 °C for 30 s, and elongation at 72 °C for 1 min. A total of 30 cycles was performed with an additional extension at 72 °C for 5 min. RT-PCR products were gel-purified and ligated into the BamHI/EcoRI site of pRS316. Recovered plasmids were sequenced using an M13F oligo.RNA immunoprecipitations were done as described previously (29Kwan S. Gerlach V.L. Brow D.A. RNA. 2000; 6: 1859-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Each immunoprecipitation mixture contained 20 μl of swollen protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) that had previously been incubated with 5 μg of 2,2,7-trimethylguanosine Ab-1 antibody (Calbiochem), 50 units of RNasin (Promega), and 5 μg of total cellular RNA in a 200-μl volume. The precedent for Ab-1 recognition of both 7-methylguanosine and 2,2,7-trimethylguanosine caps came from Bochnig et al. (30Bochnig P. Reuter R. Bringmann P. Luhrmann R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 168: 461-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar).Primer extension analysis of 5 μg of total cellular RNA was carried out using 32P-labeled oligonucleotide U4–14B (complementary to nucleotides 140–159 of yeast U4 RNA) or SCR1 (complementary to nucleotides 75–92 of yeast scR1 RNA) (31Martin M.P. Gerlach V.L. Brow D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6429-6439Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Sequencing ladders were generated using the Sequitherm EXCEL II DNA sequencing kit (Epicentre). The cDNA products were electrophoresed on 6% polyacrylamide, 8.3 m urea gels. Gels were visualized with a Storm PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences), and data were quantitated with Amersham Biosciences ImageQuant software (Version 5.2).RESULTSConserved Sequence Elements Upstream of the Yeast U4 snRNA Gene, SNR14—To begin characterizing SNR14 promoter architecture, we used comparative sequence analysis to identify conserved elements upstream of the transcription start site and downstream of the 5′-adjacent gene, SEC3 (Fig. 1A). An alignment of sequences upstream of SNR14 in four different species of Saccharomyces (32Cliften P. Sudarsanam P. Desikan A. Fulton L. Fulton B. Majors J. Waterston R. Cohen B.A. Johnston M. Science. 2003; 301: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar) helped identify several conserved elements (Fig. 1B). The most strikingly conserved regions include the sequence immediately upstream of the transcription start site, a TATA box located 100 base pairs upstream of the start site, a T-stretch just upstream of the TATA box, and a region located 31–44 base pairs upstream of the TATA box. The most upstream conserved region may be an upstream activating sequence and in S. cerevisiae exactly matches the consensus binding site of the transcriptional activator Abf1 (33Mukherjee S. Berger M.F. Jona G. Wang X.S. Muzzey D. Snyder M. Young R.A. Bulyk M.L. Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 1331-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 34Beinoraviciute-Kellner R. Lipps G. Krauss G. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 4535-4540Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar).In addition to promoting SNR14 transcription, another likely function for conserved sequences in this intergenic region is to direct cleavage and polyadenylation of Sec3 mRNA. RT-PCR was used to identify the predominant Sec3 mRNA 3′-processing sites. The most efficiently recovered site, which appeared in 12 of 21 clones, mapped to the middle of the putative Abf1 binding site (Fig. 1B). Six other nearby sites were represented by 1–2 clones each. This result implies that the sites of SEC3 transcription termination and SNR14 PIC assembly overlap.DNase I chromatin footprinting was used to complement comparative sequence analysis in the search for potential SNR14 promoter elements. This procedure probed in vivo assembled chromatin by lysing yeast cells directly into a solution of DNase I. For comparison, purified genomic DNA was digested with DNase I. Cleavage sites were detected by primer extension (27Hull M.W. Thomas G. Huibregtse J.M. Engelke D.R. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 35: 383-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). No obvious DNase I footprint was observed between the SNR14 TATA box and start site (Fig. 1C) despite the fact that the gene is single-copy and highly transcribed. This finding suggests that there is no high occupancy protein binding site in the region of the promoter that separates the location of PIC recruitment from that of transcription initiation. Rather, the subtle changes in DNase I protection and enhancement suggest partial occupancy. In addition, some subtle changes in DNase I sensitivity were observed at the putative upstream activating sequence, TATA box, and initiator region, consistent with partial occupancy. We could not make any conclusions regarding the protein occupancy of the T-stretch given that it was not efficiently cleaved by DNase I. Because a scanning RNAP II complex is unlikely to provide sufficient promoter occupancy for detectable DNase I protection, the footprinting results obtained for the SNR14 promoter are consistent with this model for transcription initiation.The Conserved SNR14 TATA Box Is Not a Determinant of Start Site Position in Vivo—Functional upstream SNR14 promoter elements were roughly mapped using 5′-truncation analysis of a plasmid-borne allele (Fig. 2A). Inserts were tested in both orientations within the vector to control for effects of plasmid sequences. Primer extension of U4 RNA synthesized from its chromosomal locus showed the single major transcription start site designated as +1 (Fig. 2B, lane 1). Strains bearing SNR14 with 224 base pairs of upstream DNA on a plasmid yielded the same initiation pattern as the chromosomal locus (Fig. 2B, lanes 2 and 9). Deletion of the putative upstream activating sequence and T-stretch had no effect on transcription efficiency or accuracy in the context of the “forward” plasmid-borne allele but decreased efficiency 2-fold in the “reverse” orientation (Fig. 2B, lanes 3 and 10). The efficiency of SNR14 transcription was reduced an additional 4–11-fold upon deletion of the TATA box, but transcription start site selection was changed little (Fig. 2B, lanes 4 and 11). Upon further truncation to position –74 and beyond, transcription start site selection became increasingly aberrant, resulting in the appearance of additional U4 RNA 5′ ends (Fig. 2B, lanes 5-8 and 12-14). Except for the –3 reverse allele, all SNR14 truncation mutant strains are viable. Surprisingly, even strains bearing deletions of upstream DNA to position –3 expressed transcripts initiating from the +1 start site, albeit at a very low level (Fig. 2C). The effects of promoter truncations varied somewhat depending on the orientation of SNR14 alleles within the plasmid, with the reverse orientation yielding more severe effects on growth and U4 RNA synthesis. Because the differences appeared to be limited to transcription efficiency and not transcription start site selection, they are likely due to functional promoter elements in the vector sequences.FIGURE 2The conserved SNR14 TATA box is not a determinant of start site position in vivo. A, schematic diagram of SNR14 promoter deletion mutants. Conserved sequence elements (Fig. 1) are indicated. Deletion construct end points are indicated as base pairs remaining upstream of the +1 transcription start site. An arrow designates the annealing site for the primer extension probe. B, primer extension of U4 and scR1 (loading control) RNAs in total cellular RNA isolated from an untransformed strain with an intact SNR14 chromosomal locus (CHR) or from strains bearing a disrupted SNR14 chromosomal locus transformed with plasmid-borne SNR14 promoter deletion alleles. Orientation of the SNR14 allele within the plasmid is arbitrarily specified as forward (F) or reverse (R). The positions of U4 and scR1 cDNAs are indicated on the left. Arrows on the right denote additional U4 RNA 5′ ends resulting from promoter truncations. C, summary of SNR14 promoter truncation effects on growth phenotype and U4 RNA level. Orientation of the SNR14 allele within the plasmid is as specified in panel B. RNA levels were quantitated using only U4 transcripts initiated from the +1 start site and are relative to the full-length construct (–224) normalized to scR1 level, which was defined as 100. Growth phenotypes were determined qualitatively from serial dilution spot tests on solid synthetic complete medium containing 5-fluoroorotic acid.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To confirm that the additional U4 RNA 5′ ends observed upon truncation of the SNR14 promoter were due to misinitiation and not degradation, we tested for the presence of the methylguanosine 5′ cap that is added to nascent RNAP II transcripts (35Shuman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12758-12760Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Because the 7-methylguanosine cap attached co-transcriptionally to RNAP II transcripts is hypermethylated to trimethylguanosine on snRNAs, we used a monoclonal antibody that recognizes both cap structures. RNAs corresponding to all major U4-specific primer extension products were efficiently immunoprecipitated with an anti-cap antibody (Fig. 3A), confirming that they are primary transcripts. The scR1 RNA is synthesized by RNAP III and was not immunoprecipitated with anti-cap antibody, showing that immunoprecipitation is specific for capped transcripts. The major alternative start sites resulting from SNR14 promoter truncations were mapped to positions –35, –32, and –27, which are located within plasmid sequence, and +20, +32, +83, and +88 in the U4 coding region. Interestingly, all of the start sites mapped to a purine residue, and 5 of the 8 start sites (including the wild-type start site) immediately follow the dinucleotide CC (Fig. 3B).FIGURE 3Alternate 5′ ends resulting from SNR14 promoter truncations are due to aberrant transcription initiation and share similar start site sequences. A, total RNA was immunoprecipitated with an anti-2,2,7-trimethylguanosine (TMG) cap antibody. Primer extension of total RNA or pellet (P) and supernatant (S) fractions was done with 32P-labeled U4- and scR1-specific primers. The scR1 RNA served as a negative control since it was synthesized by RNAP III as an uncapped transcript. The positions of alternate start sites within upstream plasmid sequence and the U4 coding region were mapped to the nucleotide (data not shown) and are indicated on the right. No IP, no immunoprecipitation. B, sequence context of alternative SNR14 start sites, with non-template strand DNA aligned from –10 to +10 relative to the site of initiation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Thus, transcription initiation of SNR14 from the normal +1 start site is remarkably resistant to deletion of conserved upstream promoter elements. Much like what has been observed previously at mRNA genes, the SNR14 TATA box primarily affects the frequency of RNAP II transcription and not the position of initiation (10Struhl K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 1051-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Alternative SNR14 initiation sites minimally include a purine preceded by a pyrimidine and most often by two cytosines. These results suggest that start site selection at SNR14 is directed by an initiator-like element, potentially in combination with a downstream (intragenic) element.A Polar Effect on SNR14 Start Site Selection Supports a Unidirectional Scanning Model—A scanning model for yeast transcription start site selection posits that after melting DNA near the TATA box, RNAP II translocates along downstream DNA until a suitable initiation sequence is located (11Giardina C. Lis J.T. Science. 1993; 261: 759-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). We directly tested the validity of this model by constructing an SNR14 allele with tandemly duplicated start sites, SNR14-StDup (Fig. 4A, construct 2). The SNR14-StDup construct has a 14-base pair insertion that creates two start sites identical in sequence from positions –13 to +7, which should be indistinguishable to factors binding directly to these sequences, including RNAP II. Therefore, if start site selection is driven by a random collision of RNAP II or another initiator-binding protein with the DNA, we should detect roughly equal utilization of the two sites. If the start site is defined by its distance from factors bound upstream or by a polymerase scanning from the TATA box, we should detect primarily upstream starts. In contrast, if the start site is measured from factors bound to intragenic promoter elements, we should detect primarily downstream starts (36Gerlach V.L. Whitehall S.K. Geiduschek E.P. Brow D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1455-1466Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).FIGURE 4A polar effect on SNR14 start site selection supports a unidirectional scanning model. A, primer extension of U4 and scR1 RNAs in total cellular RNA isolated from strains containing wild-type SNR14, SNR14-StDup, or mutant SNR14-StDup alleles. The SNR14-StDup allele (construct 2) was made by insertion of 14 bp of DNA (boxed region) between positions +1 and +2 of wild-type SNR14 (construct 1), creating an overlapping 20-bp duplication (underlined).

CD40, a costimulatory molecule, is expressed in macrophages and microglia. The aberrant expression of CD40 is involved in human diseases including multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and Alzheimer's disease. CD40 expression is induced by a variety of stimuli, including IFN-gamma and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In this study, we describe the molecular basis by which IFN-beta, a cytokine with immunomodulatory properties, regulates CD40 gene expression. IFN-beta induces CD40 expression in macrophages and microglia at the transcriptional level, and GAS elements in the CD40 promoter are required for IFN-beta-induced CD40 promoter activity. The critical role of signal transducers and activators of transcription-1alpha (STAT-1alpha) in this response was confirmed by utilizing primary microglia from STAT-1alpha deficient mice. IFN-beta induces suppressor of cytokine signaling-1 (SOCS-1) gene expression, which inhibits cytokine signaling by inhibiting activation of STAT proteins. The ectopic expression of SOCS-1 abrogates IFN-beta-mediated STAT-1alpha activation and inhibits IFN-beta-induced CD40 expression. IFN-beta-induced recruitment of STAT-1alpha and RNA Pol II and permissive histone modifications on the CD40 promoter are also inhibited by SOCS-1 overexpression. These novel results indicate that IFN-beta-induced SOCS-1 plays an important role in the negative regulation of IFN-beta-induced CD40 gene expression."

We profiled the eicosanoid production during KA-induced seizure by a comprehensive lipidomics analysis using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Systemic KA administration caused production of large amounts of prostaglandin (PG) F2α and PGD2 in the hippocampus, with smaller amounts of other PGs and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids. The production was biphasic, which consisted of an initial burst in the first 30 min and a sustained late phase production. The initial phase was specific to the hippocampus and was blocked by intracerebroventricular administration of KA receptor antagonists. A selective cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitor, NS398, completely inhibited the initial phase productions, except for PGD2 and thromboxane B2, whose productions were also dependent on COX-1. These results suggest that KA signals directly stimulate the arachidonic acid cascade in the initial phase and that COX-1 and COX-2, both constitutively expressed at low levels, differentially contribute to PG productions. In the late phase, a sustained PG production in hippocampus appears due to the increased COX-2 levels even with a limited arachidonic acid supply. The present study demonstrates a dual phase regulatory mechanism of eicosanoid production during KA-induced seizure, providing a biochemical basis for understanding the biosynthesis and roles of eicosanoids in the brain.

When systemically administrated to rats, KA induces a rapid and recurrent epileptic seizure, followed by a neuronal degeneration in specific brain areas, including hippocampus (2Sperk G. Prog. Neurobiol. 1994; 42: 1-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). KA-induced seizure has been thus studied as one of the animal models of human temporal lobe epilepsy (3Ben-Ari Y. Neuroscience. 1985; 14: 375-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (1536) Google Scholar). Eicosanoids such as prostaglandins (PGs) and leukotrienes (LTs) are arachidonic acid-derived lipid mediators produced from membrane phospholipids, which exert diverse biological activities as intercellular signaling molecules through their cognate G protein-coupled receptors (4Pierce K.L.

In the present study, we profiled the eicosanoid production in the rat hippocampus during KA-induced seizure. Taking advantages of the simultaneous quantification method using liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS) (13Kita Y. Takahashi T. Uozumi N. Nallan L. Gelb M.H. Shimizu T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 330: 898-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 14Kita Y. Takahashi T. Uozumi N. Shimizu T. Anal. Biochem. 2005; 342: 134-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), we carried out a comprehensive analysis of lipid mediators in the rat hippocampal tissues. The time course of COX-2 up-regulation and the profile of lipid mediator production suggested a dual phase regulatory mechanism; a direct KA action may cause a transient burst PG production in the initial phase, whereas increased COX-2 levels mediate the late phase production under limited arachidonic acid supply. We also demonstrate a contribution of COX-1 in the production of PGD2 and TxB2 in the hippocampus, as well as a role of constitutively expressed COX-2, suggesting a diversity of PG production pathways in the brain. Animals—Three-week-old male Wistar rats, 3-day-old male rats, and embryonic day 18 rats (SLC, Hamamatsu, Japan) were used in the study. All animal studies were conducted in accordance with the Guidelines for Animal Research at the University of Tokyo and were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of the University of Tokyo. Reagents—Kainic acid, NS398, and indomethacin were purchased from Wako (Osaka, Japan). UBP296, UBP301, and 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX) were from Tocris (Bristol, UK). [α-32P]CTP was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Rabbit polyclonal anti-cytosolic phospholipase A2α (cPLA2α) antibody was from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA), and rabbit polyclonal anti-COX-2 antibody was from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG was from Amersham Biosciences. All eicosanoid primary standards and deuterium-labeled eicosanoid internal standards for quantification were purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). Drug Administration, Tissue Collection, and Lipid Extraction—Rats were euthanized at indicated periods after intraperitoneal KA administration (10 mg/kg, dissolved in saline). Hippocampi (70–80 mg) and cerebral cortex (70–100 mg) were dissected, immediately frozen under liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C until use. The tissues were crushed to powder with an SK-100 mill (Tokken, Chiba, Japan) without thawing, and lipids were extracted with 1 ml of ethanol with a mixture of deuterium-labeled internal standards of eicosanoids. The extracts were further cleaned up with Oasis HLB extraction cartridges (30 mg, Waters, Milford, MA) as described (14Kita Y. Takahashi T. Uozumi N. Shimizu T. Anal. Biochem. 2005; 342: 134-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). For the intracerebroventricular administration of KA receptor antagonists, CNQX, UBP296, and UBP301 were dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)/Me2SO (95:5, v/v) at a concentration of 10 mm (50 nmol in 5 μl). 5 μl of the solutions was injected into both of the lateral ventricles by a 10-μl Hamilton microsyringe fitted with a 27-gauge × 3/4-inch length needle with the following coordinates: anterior/posterior =–1 mm behind bregma, medial/lateral = 1 mm, and an injection depth of 3.5 mm. For COX inhibitor administration, indomethacin and NS398 were dissolved in Me2SO (5 mg/ml) and intraperitoneally injected at a dose of 10 mg/kg, 30 min before KA administration. Quantification of Eicosanoids—Eicosanoids in the brain were quantified as described (14Kita Y. Takahashi T. Uozumi N. Shimizu T. Anal. Biochem. 2005; 342: 134-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Briefly, a TSQ-7000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray ionization (ESI) ion source (Thermo Electron, Waltham, MA) was operated in negative-ESI and selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mode. A reversed phase high performance liquid chromatograph system, consisting of four Shimadzu (Kyoto, Japan) LC-10A pumps and a Shimadzu CTO-10 column oven, an electrically controlled 6-port switching valve (Valco, Houston, TX), and a 3033 HTS autosampler (Shiseido, Tokyo, Japan), was connected to the MS instrument and used for the rapid resolution of PGs with Shiseido Capcellpak C18 MGS3 (1 × 100 mm) column within 10 min. For the accurate quantification, an internal standard method was used. As internal standards, a mixture of deuterium-labeled eicosanoids was used. Automated peak detection, calibration, and calculation were carried out by the use of Xcalibur 1.2 software package (Thermo Electron). Reverse Transcription-PCR—For the preparation of first-strand cDNA templates from rat hippocampus, total RNA was isolated by Isogen reagent (Nippon Gene, Toyama, Japan), and mRNA was isolated by using a μMACS mRNA isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec, Gladbach, Germany). Oligo(dT)-primed reverse transcriptions were performed with Superscript II enzyme (Invitrogen). Following primers were used for PCR: cPLA2α (forward, 5′-TTTGGCGATATGCTGGACACTCCTG-3′; reverse, 5′-GAGGGAAACAGAGCAACGAGATGGG-3′), COX-1 (forward, 5′-GGAGTCTCTCGCTCCAGTTTCCCCT-3′; reverse, 5′-GGAGACATAGGGGCAGGTCTTGGTG-3′), COX-2 (forward, 5′-ATGCAGCAAATCCTTGCTGTTCCAA-3′; reverse, 5′-CACTTGCGTTGATGGTGGCTGTCTT-3′), microsomal PGE synthase-1 (mPGES-1, forward, 5′-TTCCCTGGGTTTGGTGATGGAGAAC-3′; reverse, 5′-ACAGGCGAACTGGGCCAGAACATAG-3′), lipocalin-type PGD synthase (forward, 5′-CTCTTGGGATTTCCACAGACCCCAG-3′; reverse, 5′-ACTTATCCGGTTGGGGCAGGAAAAC-3′), PGI synthase (forward, 5′-ATGCCGCCAGCTTCCTTACCAGGAT-3′; reverse, 5′-GGCTGCATCAGGCCAAAGCCATATC-3′), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (forward, 5′-GAAGGTCGGTGTGAACGGATTTGGC-3′; reverse, 5′-TTGTCATTGAGAGCAATGCCAGCCC-3′). Expected PCR product sizes were 2,088, 1,733, 1,701, 409, 511, 1,319, and 906 bp for cPLA2α, COX1, COX-2, mPGES-1, lipocalin-type PGD synthase, PGI synthase, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, respectively. PCR conditions were as follows: initial denaturation at 94 °C for 2 min, followed by 30 cycles of 96 °C for 15 s, 65 °C for 30 s, 68 °C for 2 min (for cPLA2α, COX-1, COX-2, and PGI synthase) or 1 min (for mPGES-1, lipocalin-type PGD synthase, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase), and final extension at 68 °C for 5 min. The amplified products were confirmed by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was separated in 1.2% agarose gel containing 55% formaldehyde. Total RNA samples were prepared from pooled tissues of at least 3 rats, 25 μg/lane (for cPLA2α), 50 μg/lane (for COX-1), and 20 μg/lane (for COX-2) of which were loaded onto the gels. The RNA was transferred onto Hybond-N+ membrane for 16 h and cross-linked with ultraviolet light. [α-32P]CTP-labeled riboprobes were used for hybridization. Antisense riboprobes (1.0 × 106 to 1.0 × 107 cpm/μg of RNA) were synthesized by transcription of cDNA fragments subcloned in a pGEM-3Zf(–) vector using T7 and SP6 RNA polymerases (Promega, Madison, WI). cDNA sequences used were, nucleotides 1254–1538 and 1539–2099 for cPLA2α, 201–796 for COX-1, and 660–1044 for COX-2 (nucleotide enumerations are based on sequences of GenBank™ accession numbers BC070940, RRU03388, and AF233596, respectively). All the probe sequences were selected within the open reading frames of respective cDNA sequences. Hybridizations with given labeled riboprobes were performed at 57 °C for 16 h using 1 × 107 cpm/ml of probes in a hybridization buffer containing 50% formamide, 5 × Denhardt's solution (Wako, Osaka, Japan), 10% dextran sulfate, 5 × SSPE (0.75 m NaCl, 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, 2.5 mm EDTA, pH 7.4), 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 0.01 mg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA, and 50 mm dithiothreitol. After several washes under stringent conditions, radioactive signals were visualized with a BAS-2000 imaging analyzer (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan). Western Blot Analysis—Hippocampi were homogenized in a lysis buffer (0.34 m sucrose, 150 mm NaCl, 80 mm potassium phosphate buffer, 10 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4) containing a Complete™ EDTA protease inhibitor mixture (1 tablet/20 ml, Calbiochem, San Diego, CA). 8 μg/lane of lysates was subjected to a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto an Immun-Blot polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). The membrane was blocked overnight at 4 °C with BlockACE (Yukijirushi, Sapporo Japan) and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with rabbit polyclonal antibody for cPLA2α or COX-2 diluted 1:1000 in 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS (T-PBS). After washing with T-PBS, the membrane was incubated with donkey anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase for 1 h. After washing, immunoreactive signals were visualized with an ECL Plus Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Statistical Analysis—Statistical analyses were carried out with GraphPad Prism 4.0.3 package (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA), and p values of <0.05 were considered statistically significant. Biphasic PG Production in the Rat Hippocampus after Systemic KA Administration—A comprehensive analysis of eicosanoids in the rat hippocampal tissue was carried out with a LC-ESI-MS/MS multiplex quantification system. Fig. 1 shows typical chromatograms for hippocampal tissues 1 h after intraperitoneal KA injection and those from saline-injected control rats. In our system, five major PGs, 6-keto-PGF1α (a stable metabolite of PGI2), TxB2 (a stable metabolite of TxA2), PGF2α, PGE2, and PGD2, were readily detected even in the untreated rats (Fig. 1A) and dramatically increased after KA administration (Fig. 1B). Three major LTs, LTB4, LTC4, and LTD4, were undetectable. Among hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HETE) isomers, two major peaks of 11-HETE and 12-HETE were observed, which increased after KA administration. Using deuterium-labeled internal standards, PGs were quantified up to 24 h after KA treatment. As shown in Fig. 2A, hippocampal tissue produced PGF2α and PGD2 as two major PGs, followed by PGE2, TxB2, and 6-keto-PGF1α in this order. The PG levels reached rapidly a peak within 30 min to 1 h after KA administration and then decreased to lower levels. The production levels remained higher than the basal levels at 3 h and sustained up to 24 h. All PG species monitored showed a similar time course (Fig. 2A). These results demonstrated that hippocampal PG production after systemic KA administration was biphasic; an initial burst was followed by a sustained late phase production. Interestingly, the initial response to KA within 30 min was not observed in the cerebral cortex, suggesting that PG production at this phase is specific to hippocampus (Fig. 2B). Primary eicosanoids produced in the hippocampal tissue can be further converted to biologically active or inactive metabolites. To evaluate this, metabolites were quantified for three major eicosanoids produced in the hippocampus, PGF2α, PGD2, and PGE2. As shown in Fig. 2 (C and D), considerable amounts of 13,14-dihydro-15-keto-PGF2α and 13,14-dihydro-15-keto-PGE2 were detected proportionally to respective precursors both in the initial phase and in the late phase, suggesting that PGF2α and PGE2 are readily metabolized to these inactive compounds by 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (PGDH). The levels of 13,14-dihydro-15-keto metabolite of PGD2 as compared with its precursor PGD2 were much smaller than those of PGF2α and PGE2, suggesting that PGD2 is rather stable against PGDH-mediated PG inactivation (Fig. 2, C and D). PGD2 can also be converted to PGJ2, Δ12,14-PGJ2, and/or 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-PGJ2, which are reportedly bioactive metabolites (15Scher J.U. Pillinger M.H. Clin.

A. 1985; 82: 6030-6034Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The amounts of these metabolites were almost undetectable or very small throughout the time course, suggesting they are not major metabolites of PGD2 in the rat hippocampus (data not shown). Inhibition of the Initial Phase PG Production by KA Receptor Antagonists—To examine if the initial phase hippocampal PG production was mediated by KA receptors in the hippocampus, rats were pretreated (intracerebroventricularly) with CNQX (a non-N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist), UBP296 (a selective antagonist for GluR5 subunit-containing KA receptors), or UBP301 (a selective antagonist for KA receptors) 30 min prior to the systemic KA administration (intraperitoneally). UBP296 and UBP301 have been reported as potent selective antagonists for KA receptors (reported Kd values of ∼1 μm and ∼6 μm, respectively; see Ref. 17More J.C. Nistico R. Dolman N.P. Clarke V.R. Alt A.J. Ogden A.M. Buelens F.P. Troop H.M. Kelland E.E. Pilato F. Bleakman D. Bortolotto Z.A. Collingridge G.L. Jane D.E. Neuropharmacology. 2004; 47: 46-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 (A–E), all of the PG productions were significantly suppressed by UBP296. CNQX and UBP301 were less potent than UBP296, because they inhibited only PGF2α production with statistical significance (Fig. 3, A–E). When much smaller amounts of KA (1 nmol/rat) were intracerebroventricularly administrated, the rats exhibited immediate epileptic response within several minutes, much earlier than those observed by systemic administration (45–60 min). PG profiles after intracerebroventricular KA administration were similar to those by systemic KA administration (data not shown). Collectively, these results suggest that immediate burst PG productions in the hippocampus were mediated by direct activation of KA receptors in the brain, probably by those expressed in the hippocampus. Changes of Enzyme Levels in the Hippocampus after Systemic KA Administration—To understand the mechanism of KA-induced PG productions, we measured the levels of enzymes involved in the arachidonic acid cascade at mRNA and protein levels. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis of hippocampal tissues after KA treatment demonstrated an increase in the COX-2 and mPGES-1 mRNAs after KA treatment (Fig. 4A). Northern blot analyses were performed for cPLA2α, COX-1, and COX-2 (Fig. 4B). COX-2 mRNA increased transiently, reaching a peak 3–6 h after KA treatment. By contrast, cPLA2α and COX-1 mRNAs did not show significant changes. Western blot analysis showed a low level expression of COX-2 protein in unstimulated control rats, and a significant increase was observed 3 h after KA administration, which lasted for 24 h (Fig. 4C). The amount of cPLA2α protein did not show significant changes (Fig. 4C). These results demonstrated that KA administration stimulates COX-2 up-regulation through KA receptors; however, the time course was delayed from the initial burst PG production (Fig. 2A). Rather, the COX-2 up-regulation was concomitant with the late phase PG production, suggesting a role of increased COX-2 in the late phase production. Effects of COX Inhibitors on the Initial Phase PG Production—To further analyze COX-isoform dependence of the initial phase PG production, effects of COX inhibitors were examined. As shown in Fig. 5, pretreatment of rats with a COX-2-selective inhibitor, NS398, effectively suppressed the initial phase PG production. NS398 inhibited the production of PGD2 and TxB2 only by 50–70%, whereas other PGs (PGF2α, PGE2, and 6-keto-PGF1α) were almost completely inhibited. Indomethacin, a non-selective COX inhibitor, inhibited all of the PG productions. These results demonstrate that COX-2 is constitutively present in the brain and plays a major role in PG productions, and that COX-1 contributes to some extent in the production of PGD2 and TxB2. In the present study, we profiled the eicosanoid production of rat hippocampal tissues during KA-induced seizure using the LC-ESI-MS/MS multiple quantification method (13Kita Y. Takahashi T. Uozumi N. Nallan L. Gelb M.H. Shimizu T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 330: 898-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 14Kita Y. Takahashi T. Uozumi N. Shimizu T. Anal. Biochem. 2005; 342: 134-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). One of the advantages of our strategy is that multiple eicosanoids can be measured simultaneously. From the method, a novel insight is now provided for PG production in KA-induced seizure model. Dual Phase Regulation of Eicosanoid Productions in the Hippocampus—Systemic KA administration caused biphasic PG production (Fig. 2). Initially, an immediate burst of PG production occurred within 30 min after KA administration. Subsequently, late phase PG production sustained to 24 h, with levels being lower than the initial phase but higher than the untreated basal levels. The prominent productions of PGF2α and PGD2 in the initial phase (Fig. 2) agree well with a previous report (6Baran H. Heldt R. Hertting G. Brain Res. 1987; 404: 107-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In addition, the lack of LT synthesis in our observation (Fig. 1) illustrates that the COX pathway is dominant in the hippocampus during this period. Kawaguchi et al. (12Kawaguchi K. Hickey R.W. Rose M.E. Zhu L. Chen J. Graham S.H. Brain Res. 2005; 1050: 130-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) reported an increased PGE2 production in the rat hippocampus 24 h after KA administration. Our results, however, demonstrate that PGF2α and PGD2 rather than PGE2 are major metabolites even 24 h after KA stimulation. Analysis of the metabolic fate of major PGs showed that PGF2α and PGE2 are converted to the 13,14-dihydro-15-keto form in the hippocampus, whereas PGD2 is rather resistant to this inactivation pathway (Fig. 2, C and D). This result agrees with the substrate specificity of NAD+-dependent 15-PGDH (18Ensor C.M. Tai H.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1208: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 19Tai H.H. Ensor C.M. Tong M. Zhou H. Yan F. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 2002; 68–69: 483-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 20Ensor C.M. Tai H.H. J. Lipid Mediat. Cell Signal. 1995; 12: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). It is not likely that PGD2 is converted to other metabolites such as PGJ2, Δ12,14-PGJ2, 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-PGJ2, and/or 11β-PGF2α, because they were hardly or very weakly detected in the hippocampal tissue (data not shown). The time course of the production of 13,14-dihydro-15-keto metabolites was similar to those of precursor PGs, which reached a peak at 30 min to 1 h after KA administration (data not shown). Thus, we suppose that both PGs and their metabolites can be removed from the hippocampal tissue, possibly by blood flow or diffusion. The biphasic profile of PG production can be explained by the mode of KA action and the enzyme levels of the arachidonic acid cascade (Fig. 6). In the initial phase, large amounts of PGs are produced rapidly without enzyme levels apparently changed (Figs. 2 and 4). In addition, this initial robust production was not observed in the cortex, suggesting that it is hippocampus-specific (Fig. 2B). Further, intracerebroventricular administration of KA receptor antagonists blocked the PG productions in the hippocampus. All these results suggest that this process is mediated by KA receptor in the hippocampus (Fig. 3), consistent with the high density distribution of KA receptors in the hippocampus (21Monaghan D.T. Cotman C.W. Brain Res. 1982; 252: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 22Tremblay E. Represa A. Ben-Ari Y. Brain Res. 1985; 343: 378-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The most probable mechanism is that activation of KA receptor increases intracellular [Ca2+] (23Ozawa S. Kamiya H. Tsuzuki K. Prog. Neurobiol. 1998; 54: 581-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar), causing translocation of cPLA2α to the membrane, as reported in various types of cells (24Glover S. de Carvalho M.S.

The mechanism of the late phase PG production may much differ from that of the initial phase. In the late phase, the COX-2 levels were increased by KA treatment (Fig. 4), as reported (7Chen J. Marsh T. Zhang J.S. Graham S.H. Neuroreport. 1995; 6: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 8Manev H. Uz T. Qu T. Exp.

Brain Res. 2005; 1050: 130-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The COX-2 up-regulation can result in an increased production of PGs, but the levels of late phase productions were much lower than the initial phase. This can be due to the limited supply of arachidonic acid: KA receptor signals might no longer stimulate arachidonic acid release as in the initial phase (Fig. 6C). The constitutive PG productions observed in the untreated rats (Figs. 1 and 2A) suggest that, in the hippocampus, there is a significant supply of arachidonic acid in the steady state. Thus, increased COX-2 levels with this limited arachidonic acid supply may illustrate the nature of the late phase production (Fig. 6C). In contrast to the initial phase PG production that was specific to the hippocampus, we observed the late phase PG production also in the cortex (data not shown). Since it has been reported that COX-2 up-regulation is seen in the cortex as well as hippocampus (7Chen J. Marsh T. Zhang J.S. Graham S.H. Neuroreport. 1995; 6: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 10Ciceri P. Zhang Y. Shaffer A.F. Leahy K.M. Woerner M.B. Smith W.G. Seibert K. Isakson P.C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 302: 846-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), the late phase PG production mechanism may be common in hippocampus and cortex. The mechanism of KA-induced COX-2 up-regulation may involve an increased transcription and/or a stabilization of COX-2 mRNA (27Brown J.R. DuBois R.N. J. Clin. Oncol. 2005; 23: 2840-2855Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). KA-induced intracellular signaling processes activate extracellular signal-regulated kinase (28Lee J.K. Choi S.S. Lee H.K.

Oncol. 2005; 23: 2840-2855Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Further investigations are required to elucidate the precise mechanism and physiological roles of COX-2 up-regulation by KA in the brain. Differential Involvement of COX-1 and COX-2 in the Initial Phase PG Productions—A critical and important finding from this study is that COX-1 and COX-2 differentially contribute to PG productions in the initial phase. Our results with a COX-2-selective inhibitor, NS398, showed that COX-1 might also contribute to productions of PGD2 and TxB2 during KA-induced seizure (Figs. 5 and 6B). The mechanism of the differential COX-1/COX-2 contribution can be explained by the coupling efficiency of terminal PG synthases to each COX isoform. A functional coupling of COX-2 to PGE synthase (36Murakami M. Naraba H. Tanioka T. Semmyo N. Nakatani Y. Kojima F. Ikeda T. Fueki M. Ueno A. Oh-ishi S. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32783-32792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar, 37Brock T.G. McNish R.W. Peters-Golden M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11660-11666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) as well as COX-1 to PGD and thromboxane synthases has been reported (38Murakami M. Matsumoto R. Austen K.F. Arm J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22269-22275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Naraba H. Murakami M. Matsumoto H. Shimbara S. Ueno A. Kudo I. Oh-ishi S. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2974-2982PubMed Google Scholar). However, PGD2 and TxB2 productions seem dependent also on COX-2 in the brain, because NS398 significantly reduced their production (Fig. 5). It is possible that platelets and immune cells also produce PGD2 and thromboxane via COX-1. In such cases, it is unlikely that KA directly stimulates these cell types, because KA effects are localized to hippocampus (Fig. 2B). Rather, KA may indirectly stimulate these cells through activating neurons or glial cells. In Vivo Significance of the Dual Phase PG Production—Although the present study was not aimed to directly address the function of eicosanoids in epileptic seizure or neuronal degeneration, our results provide an important concept on such studies, that there are distinct mechanisms of PG productions serially occurring, i.e. the initial phase and the late phase productions. There are controversial reports on the effect of COX inhibitors; in some COX inhibition was protective to KA-induced seizure (40Baran H. Vass K. Lassmann H. Hornykiewicz O. Brain Res. 1994; 646: 201-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and in others COX inhibition rather aggravated symptoms (41Baik E.J. Kim E.J. Lee S.H. Moon C. Brain Res. 1999; 843: 118-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 42Kunz T. Oliw E.H. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2001; 13: 569-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Most of the studies were performed by using pretreatment with inhibitors, which blocked the initial phase PG production. Because the effective periods of inhibition may vary depending on the inhibitor and the route of administration, it is difficult to evaluate the significance of the late phase production in KA-induced seizure by a single-dose pretreatment with inhibitors. To discriminate the initial phase and the late phase PG productions, administration method of inhibitors should be well designed. Such methods may include a post-treatment with inhibitors, which conserves the initial phase intact. A recent report by Gobbo et al. (43Gobbo O.L. O'Mara S.M. Neuroscience. 2004; 125: 317-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) demonstrated that post-treatment with COX-2-selective inhibitors enhanced the functional recovery from KA-induced neuronal degeneration, whereas pretreatment aggravated the seizure symptoms, suggesting the diversity of PG roles at the beginning and at the later periods. Similar experiments with detailed monitoring of PG amounts will help in understanding the causal relations of each phase of PG production and the outcomes. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated a dual phase regulatory mechanism of eicosanoid production in the rat hippocampus during KA-induced seizure. In addition to the temporal and spatial regulation, our results also revealed the diversity of PG-producing pathways to which COX-1 and COX-2 differentially contribute. A detailed understanding of the mechanism of lipid mediator production will provide a biochemical basis for understanding the roles of lipid mediators in seizure-related pathologies. Furthermore, recent studies reporting novel lipid mediators in the brain (44Chen C. Bazan N.G. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 2005; 77: 65-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 45Mukherjee P.K. Marcheselli V.L. Serhan C.N. Bazan N.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Science. 2002; 296: 678-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar) raise the possible involvement of non-eicosanoid lipid mediators in excitotoxic degeneration. Thus, our strategy using LC-ESI-MS/MS will serve as a universal tool for understanding the roles of lipid mediators in the brain. We thank Dr. T. Hirabayashi (University of Chiba, Japan) and M.

https://openalex.org/W1994866254,"Sam68 (Src associated in mitosis; 68 kDa) is an RNA-binding protein and substrate of Src family kinases. It is thought to play a role in cell cycle progression. Overexpression of Sam68 in fibroblasts was reported to have two separable functions dependent on its ability to bind RNA — cell cycle arrest or the induction of apoptosis. Post-translational modification with SUMO (small ubiquitin-like modifier) is common to many transcription factors and can regulate protein localization, stability and function. Here we show Sam68 to be modified by SUMO, and demonstrate that the SUMO E3 ligase (PIAS1) (protein inhibitor of activated STAT1) can enhance Sam68 sumoylation. Lysine 96, the first lysine in the amino-terminal region of Sam68, was found to be the major SUMO acceptor site. Mutation of the SUMO acceptor lysine to arginine enhanced the ability of Sam68 to induce apoptosis but inhibited its ability to act as a transcriptional inhibitor of cyclin D1 expression. A SUMO-1 Sam68 fusion protein, on the other hand, inhibited the ability of Sam68 to induce apoptosis but was a strong repressor of cyclin D1 expression. Thus, SUMO may be an important regulator of Sam68 function in cell cycle progression."

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 252-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) by activating the JNK pathway. Consistent with a required role in apoptotic death paradigms, both antisense RNA and small interfering RNA directed against POSH transcripts protect neuronal PC12 cells and sympathetic neurons from death caused by NGF withdrawal (10Xu Z. Kukekov N.V. Greene L.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 252-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Moreover, antisense directed to POSH interferes with the elevation of intracellular phospho-Jun levels in NGF-deprived cells, thus implicating endogenous POSH in activation of JNKs and consequent c-Jun phosphorylation. The in vivo importance of POSH in cell death and in the apoptotic JNK pathway was recently demonstrated by a study in which knockdown of POSH by infusion of antisense oligonucleotides lead to neuroprotection from cerebral ischemia as well as attenuated activation of the JNK signaling pathway (11Zhang Q.G. Wang R.M. Yin X.H. Pan J. Xu T.L. Zhang G.Y. J. Neurochem. 2005; 95: 784-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Although many individual components of the apoptotic JNK pathway have been uncovered, questions remain about the molecular means by which they are brought into contact in cells and by which they are directed toward induction of death. Here, we show that the major components of the pathway are assembled in a multiprotein complex anchored by two interacting molecular scaffolds, POSH and JIP (JNK-interacting protein), and that formation of this complex is required for JNK activation and induction of apoptosis.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 252-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) with 5′-ggattccggactcttgttgctctggg-3′ and 5′-gaattctcagatgttttccacaaagct-3′ into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of pGEX-KG. pCMS-EGFP-FLAG-ΔRing-POSH ΔSH3-3 was constructed by PCR amplification of ΔRing-POSH, using primer pairs 5′-catatgcggactcttgttggctct-3′ and 5′-catatgtacactgggacgagtctc-3′, or 5′-catatggtcacaagggcggtgacg-3′ and 5′-gaattctcagatgttttccacaaagct-3′, cut with NdeI and NdeI/EcoRI, respectively, and cloned into the NdeI/EcoRI site of pCMS-EGFP-FLAG-ΔRing-POSH. pCMS-EGFP-FLAG-ΔRing-POSH ΔSH3-3/4 was constructed by PCR amplification of pCMS-EGFP-FLAG-ΔRing-POSH ΔSH3-3, with primers 5′-catatgcggactcttgttggctct-3′ and 5′-gaattctcacctttcacaaacaacagg-3′, cut with NdeI/EcoRI, respectively, and cloned into the NdeI/EcoRI site of pCMS-EGFP-FLAG-ΔRing-POSH. pCMS-EGFP-FLAG-ΔRing-Δ61-136-POSH ΔSH3-3/4 was constructed by PCR amplification of pCMS-EGFP-FLAG-ΔRing-POSH ΔSH3-3/4, using primers 5′-catatgccgtgtgccaaagcatta-3′ and 5′-gaattctcacctttcacaaacaacagg-3′, cut with NdeI/EcoRI, and cloned into the NdeI/EcoRI site of pCMS-EGFP-FLAG-ΔRing-POSH. Protein Purifications, Immunoprecipitations, Pull-down Assays, Western Blotting, and Subcellular Fractionation—GST-JIP-1 and GST-POSH were purified as described (10Xu Z. Kukekov N.V. Greene L.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 252-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). JIP-1 protein was obtained by 3 h of thrombin cleavage of GST-JIP-1 bound to beads, followed by centrifugation and repeated dialysis against phosphate-buffered saline. 35S protein labeling, pull-down assays, immunoprecipitations, and Western blotting were performed as described previously (10Xu Z. Kukekov N.V. Greene L.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 252-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). For subcellular fractionation, cells were incubated on ice for 5 min in lysis buffer (1%Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5) and spun at low speed (2000 × g) to separate fractions. Cell Culture and Transfections—Culture and transfections of PC12 cells and 293 cells were as described previously (10Xu Z. Kukekov N.V. Greene L.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 252-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Immunoreagents—POSH antiserum was raised in rabbits using mouse POSH peptide AA253-363 as the immunizing antigen (Covance Inc.). JIP-1 antibodies were from Santa Cruz (sc-15353) and BD Biosciences (611891). Anti-phospho-JNK (9252), anti-lamin A (2032), and anti-phospho-MLK-3 (2811) were from Cell Signaling. Rac1 was from BD Biosciences (R56220), ERK and c-MYC were from Santa Cruz (sc-93 and sc-789-G, respectively), anti-FLAG (A2220) and anti-MYC (A7470) beads were from Sigma, as was antibody for FLAG (F7425). The secondary antibody was AlexaFluor 568 from Molecular Probes. Immunostaining—Cells were grown on a glass coverslips and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C for 10 min followed by treatment with 0.5% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min. For staining, antibodies were used as indicated in figure legends and text. Slides were visualized with a Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope. Studies designed to define the role of POSH in JNK signaling indicated that POSH directly interacts with MLKs and that it serves as a scaffold for MLK activation (10Xu Z. Kukekov N.V. Greene L.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 252-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). We also noted in reciprocal immunoprecipitation experiments that POSH interacts with additional downstream members of the JNK pathway including MKK-4, MKK-7, and JNKs (10Xu Z. Kukekov N.V. Greene L.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 252-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). This raised the possibility either that POSH alone may serve as a scaffold for the entire JNK activation cascade or that it couples to downstream components via one or more intermediates. To distinguish between these possibilities, we carried out in vitro pull-down assays with purified full-length GST-POSH and in vitro translated 35S-labeled MKK-4, MKK-7, JNK-1, JNK-2, and MLK-3 (a positive control). Although the predicted binding to MLK-3 was observed, there was no detectable binding to any of the other proteins (Fig. 1A). These observations thus suggested the existence of at least one intermediate component(s) between POSH and downstream pathway kinases. Members of the JIP (JNK-interacting protein) family have been identified as additional prominent participants in the JNK pathway that interact with MLKs, MKK-4, and JNKs (12Dickens M. Rogers J.S. Cavanagh J. Raitano A. Xia Z. Halpern J.R. Greenberg M.E. Sawyers C.L. Davis R.J. Science. 1997; 277: 693-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar, 13Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Tournier C. Yasuda J. Davis R.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1671-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar, 14Yasuda J. Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Sharma M. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7245-7254Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Like POSH, JIPs appear to play a key role in JNK-mediated death. For instance, neurons isolated from JIP-1 null mice do not show JNK activation or apoptotic death in response to stimuli such as excitotoxic and anoxic stresses (15Whitmarsh A.J. Kuan C.Y. Kennedy N.J. Kelkar N. Haydar T.F. Mordes J.P. Appel M. Rossini A.A. Jones S.N. Flavell R.A. Rakic P. Davis R.J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2421-2432Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). It was thus logical to hypothesize that JIPs may mediate the interaction of POSH with MKKs and JNKs. To address this, we performed a series of co-immunoprecipitations by transfecting 293 cells with Myc epitope-tagged POSH and FLAG-tagged JIP-1, JIP-2, or JIP-3. Cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Myc, and the immunocomplexes were probed for FLAG-tagged JIPs. All three JIPs were detected in the immunocomplexes of co-transfected cells and were absent from immunoprecipitates of cells transfected with JIPs in the absence of Myc-POSH (Fig. 1B, upper panel). Reciprocal co-immunoprecipitations revealed that Myc-POSH was present in complexes with all three FLAG-JIPs, but was not immunoprecipitated in the absence of co-transfected JIPs (Fig. 1B, lower panel). To further characterize the POSH-JIP interaction, we tested the ability of the GST-POSH fusion protein to pull down in vitro translated JIPs. All three JIPs (as well as the positive control MLK-3) bound to GST-POSH, but not to GST (Fig. 1C). Thus, the interaction between POSH and JIPs appears to be direct. We next assessed the hypothesis that JIPs mediate the indirect association of MKK-4/7 and JNKs with POSH. GST-POSH was immobilized on glutathione-coated beads and preincubated with or without purified JIP-1 protein. Unbound protein was removed by washing, and the beads were incubated with in vitro translated [35S]methionine-labeled MKK-4, MKK-7, or JNK-1. After further extensive washing, the bead-associated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. MKK-4, MKK-7, and JNK-1 were recovered from the beads only when they were preincubated with JIP-1 (Fig. 1D). No labeled protein was recovered from similarly treated beads without attached GST-POSH (data not shown). These findings strongly support the model that JIP-1 associates with POSH and bridges the interaction of POSH with MKK-4/7 and JNK-1. Finally, to determine the stoichiometry of POSH/JIP-1 interaction, 293 cells were co-transfected with a small amount of Flag-JIP-1 plasmid and an excess of Flag-POSH plasmid. Lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-JIP-1 antibody, resolved by Western blotting, and probed for both tagged proteins with anti-FLAG (Fig. 2A). This revealed a ratio of ∼1:1. Similar results were achieved when the plasmid concentrations were reversed and lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-POSH antibody (data not shown). The association of POSH with JIPs in vitro and under conditions of overexpression raised the questions of whether the endogenous proteins also interact in cells and, in particular, whether they do so in the presence of apoptotic stimuli. To address this, neuronal (NGF-treated) PC12 cells were exposed to the DNA-damaging agent camptothecin for various times, and immunoprecipitates of cell lysates obtained with anti-JIP-1 were analyzed for the presence of POSH. Previous studies have established that camptothecin evokes apoptotic death of neuronal PC12 cells and neurons by ∼16–24 h of treatment (16Morris E.J. Geller H.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 757-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 17Park D.S. Morris E.J. Stefanis L. Troy C.M. Shelanski M.L. Geller H.M. Greene L.A. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 830-840Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Rideout H.J. Zang E. Yeasmin M. Gordon R. Jabado O. Park D.S. Stefanis L. Neuroscience. 2001; 107: 339-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 19Stefanis L. Park D.S. Friedman W.J. Greene L.A. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6235-6247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As described elsewhere (20Xu Z. Kukekov N.V. Greene L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 9949-9959Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), the endogenous levels of POSH, MLK-3, and JIP-1 increase under apoptotic conditions. Significantly, endogenous POSH and MLK-3 co-immunoprecipitated with endogenous JIP-1. Such association was present both before and after camptothecin treatment with increasing levels of each component in the complex in approximate proportion to their increased total cellular levels of expression (Fig. 2B). There was no signal in any case when anti-JIP-1 was omitted from the immunoprecipitations (data not shown). We also detected increased levels of MKK-7 and JNK in immunocomplexes with JIP-1 after camptothecin exposure, although the total cellular levels of these kinases were unchanged under these conditions. This most likely reflects the enhanced levels of JIP-1 in camptothecin-treated cells, although we cannot rule out a change in binding constants between MKK-7 and JNKs and JIP-1. We also assessed the fractions of total cellular endogenous POSH, MLK-3, MKK-7, and JNK that associated with JIP-1 in immunoprecipitates after camptothecin exposure by comparing scanned Western blot signals from the immunoprecipitates and immunoprecipitate supernatant fractions (taking total volumes and gel loading into account). This indicated that essentially all cellular POSH associated with JIP-1. Moreover, the fractions of total cellular MLK-3, MKK-7, and JNK present in the immunocomplexes were ∼28, <10, and <12%, respectively. These finding thus indicate that considerable fractions of cellular POSH and MLK-3 are associated with JIP-1 in apoptotically stimulated neuronal PC12 cells and that, in contrast, only a subfraction of total cellular proportions of MKK-7 and JNKs associate with this complex. The relatively low total cellular proportions of MKK-7 and JNKs recovered in co-immunoprecipitates with JIP-1 could reflect either that these molecules are in molar excess to JIP-1 or that their binding constants favor dissociation under the conditions of our experiments. To determine whether endogenous POSH and JIP-1 interact in an alternative paradigm of cell death, neuronally differentiated PC12 cells were subjected to withdrawal of NGF, a condition that results in apoptosis within 18–24 h. In this case too, POSH co-precipitated with JIP-1, and there was an increase in levels of the complex by 4–6 h of NGF withdrawal that was in rough proportion to the increases in cellular levels of both proteins (Fig. 2C). Thus, it appears that POSH and JIP-1 interact both before and after apoptotic stimuli and that apoptotic stimuli increase the cellular levels of the complex by enhancing the cellular levels of both of its principal components. The association of POSH with JIPs coupled with the interactions of POSH with MLKs and of JIPs with MKK-4/7 and JNKs suggests the formation of a functional complex containing all the known kinase components of the JNK pathway. To evaluate this model, we investigated the domains of POSH that are responsible for its interaction with JIP-1. To do so, we employed a direct GST pull-down assay in which GST-JIP-1 was used as a bait to detect interaction with various POSH deletion mutants. Mutants with deletions of SH3 domains 1 and/or 2, the rac1 binding domain or the zinc Ring finger did not show impaired interaction with GST-JIP-1 (data not shown). In contrast, as shown in Fig. 3A, sequential deletion of the highly homologous C-terminal SH3 domains number 3 and number 4 of POSH greatly reduced interaction with GST-JIP-1. We observed in past that SH3 domains 3 and 4 are not required for interaction of POSH with MLKs nor for MLK phosphorylation and activation (10Xu Z. Kukekov N.V. Greene L.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 252-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Deletion of a small region of POSH between the zinc finger domain and first SH3 domain (corresponding to amino acids 61–136) also led to a significant decrease in association of POSH with GST-JIP-1 (Fig. 3A). Finally, deletion of all three regions of POSH (i.e. SH3 domains three, four, and amino acids 61–136) led to a substantial loss of the interaction with GST-JIP-1 (Fig. 3A). As shown below, despite its impaired interaction with JIP-1, this POSH mutant retains its capacity to activate MLK-3, thus indicating that the mutant protein has not undergone a wholesale change in conformation. If, as our data indicate, JNKs and MKKs interact with POSH via their association with JIP-1, then POSH mutants with impaired JIP-1 binding properties would display a weaker interaction with MKKs and JNKs in vivo. Because POSH is a zinc Ring finger containing putative E3 ligase and is rapidly degraded in cells via the proteasomal pathway (10Xu Z. Kukekov N.V. Greene L.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 252-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), we carried out our studies with POSH constructs (ΔRing-POSH) in which the zinc Ring finger was deleted. This assured that the various constructs were adequately and equally expressed. Fig. 3E provides an example of the approximately equal expression of such constructs after transfection into 293 cells. Near equal expression was also confirmed in neuronal PC12 cells (data not shown). The ΔRing-POSH retains its capacity to bind MLKs, activate the JNK pathway, and to promote cell death (10Xu Z. Kukekov N.V. Greene L.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 252-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). FLAG-tagged ΔRing-POSH and the ΔRing-ΔSH#3/4-POSH were co-transfected with MYC-tagged MKK-4/7 or JNK-1/2, and cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG, and the resulting Western immunoblots were probed with anti-MYC. Fig. 3B shows that ΔRing-ΔSH#3/4-POSH has a greatly reduced association with MKK-7 and JNK-1 when compared with its wild type counterpart. Comparable results were achieved with MKK-4 and JNK-2 (data not shown). The residual association that was detected most likely reflects the low degree of association that occurs between ΔSH#3/4-POSH and JIP-1 (Fig. 3A). Next, we assessed the functional consequences of interfering with the association of POSH with JIP-1. Past work has established that overexpression of full-length POSH or ΔRing-POSH is sufficient to promote cellular apoptosis (9Tapon N. Nagata K. Lamarche N. Hall A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1395-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 10Xu Z. Kukekov N.V. Greene L.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 252-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and that POSH knockdown is protective from death (10Xu Z. Kukekov N.V. Greene L.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 252-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). ΔRing-POSH and various ΔRing-POSH deletion mutants impaired for interaction with JIP-1 were transfected into neuronal PC12 cells, which were subsequently scored for survival. In contrast with full-length ΔRing-POSH, the mutants with highly impaired JIP-1 interaction (ΔRing-ΔSH3#3/4 and ΔRing-ΔAA61-136/ΔSH3#3/4) showed little if any significant killing, whereas the ΔRing-ΔSH3#3 mutant, which is somewhat more effective in binding JIP-1, evoked an intermediate level of death (Fig. 3C). We observed in past that there is a substantial synergism between MLKs and POSH in the induction of cell death, presumably because of the capacity of POSH to promote MLK activation (10Xu Z. Kukekov N.V. Greene L.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 252-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3D, MLK-2 was substantially less effective in promoting death of neuronal PC12 cells when co-transfected with ΔRing-POSH ΔAA61-136/ΔSH3#3/4 than when co-transfected with the full-length ΔRing construct. Similarly, MLK-2 failed to synergize with ΔRing-POSH ΔAA61-136/ΔSH3#3/4 in generation of phospho-JNK (Fig. 3D). Our findings suggest a model in which POSH and JIP complement one another in an apoptotic complex. In this model, POSH binds and promotes activation of MLKs, which then induce sequential phosphorylation/activation of MKK-4/7 and JNKs, which are brought to the complex via interaction with JIPs. If this is correct, then POSH forms that are defective for JIP interaction should be able to evoke MLK phosphorylation/activation, but should be impaired with respect to phosphorylation/activation of JNKs. To evaluate this, we transfected 293 cells with the above POSH constructs and 24 h later assessed the levels of phospho-MLK-3 and phospho-JNK (Fig. 3E). In consonance with our model, although each of the constructs induced similar levels of MLK-3 phosphorylation, ΔRing-POSH ΔSH3#3/4 and ΔRing-POSH ΔAA61-136/ΔSH3#3/4 showed greatly reduced capacity to induce phospho-JNK. As in the above JIP-1 binding and apoptotic assays, ΔRing-POSH ΔSH3#3 induced an intermediate level of JNK phosphorylation. Thus, POSH mutants that are defective for interaction with JIP-1 but that retain the capacity to bind and activate MLKs are greatly impaired in inducing cell death and JNK phosphorylation, both alone and in synergism with an MLK. An additional prediction of our model is that POSH mutants with impaired capacity to interact with JIPs should act as partial antagonists to endogenous POSH and should provide protection form apoptotic stimuli. To test this, neuronal PC12 cells were transfected with empty vector, wild type POSH, or POSH ΔSH3#3/4 and 18 h later were subjected to NGF withdrawal. As shown in Fig. 3F, POSH ΔSH3#3/4 provided a significant protection from death evoked by NGF deprivation. This contrasted with wild type POSH, which did not show protection and which elevated death in the first day after NGF withdrawal. It has been shown that JIP-1 localizes in the neurites and cytoplasm of cultured hippocampal neurons and translocates to the perinuclear compartment of such cells in response to oxygen-glucose deprivation (15Whitmarsh A.J. Kuan C.Y. Kennedy N.J. Kelkar N. Haydar T.F. Mordes J.P. Appel M. Rossini A.A. Jones S.N. Flavell R.A. Rakic P. Davis R.J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2421-2432Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Given the interaction of POSH and JIP-1, we therefore wished to determine the localization of POSH in cells affected by apoptotic stimuli. We first used immunostaining to localize endogenous POSH and JIP-1 in neuronal PC12 cells before and after exposure to apoptotic stimuli. Because the only suitable antisera available to us were prepared in rabbit, each antigen was separately localized. Consistent with the study cited above, JIP-1 immunostaining was at highest levels at punctate locations in neurites of control cells with a lower level of diffuse cytoplasmic expression (Fig. 4, i and iii); in response to camptothecin treatment, intense JIP-1 staining was lost from neurites, and the protein showed a more intense, largely perinuclear distribution (Fig. 4, ii and iv). In control cells, POSH exhibited a widespread punctate pattern in neurites and somatic cytoplasm (Fig. 4v). After camptothecin treatment, as in the case of JIP-1, the largest increase in immunostaining was observed in the perinuclear region (Fig. 4vi). A similar change in staining pattern was observed after NGF deprivation (data not shown). Thus, in response to apoptotic stimuli, both JIP-1 and POSH accumulate in the perinuclear region. To further examine whether its interaction with JIP plays a role in the redistribution of POSH that occurs in response to apoptotic stimuli, we turned to biochemical fractionation. Lysates of neuronal PC12 cells (treated with or without camptothecin for various times) were prepared with Triton X-100 and subsequently separated into “cytoplasmic” (Rac1-containing) and crude “nuclear-associated” (Lamin A-containing) fractions (see “Experimental Procedures”). An analysis of endogenous POSH revealed that it was present in both fractions in viable cells and that the largest increase occurred in the crude nuclear fraction after camptothecin exposure, particularly after 4 h (Fig. 5A). This suggests that the POSH seen in the perinuclear region by immunostaining largely associates with the crude nuclear fraction. We also determined the relative levels of JIP-1 in our fractions. As in the case of POSH, there was a large increase in JIP-1 within the crude nuclear fraction by 4–6 h of camptothecin treatment (Fig. 5A). Thus, based on both immunostaining and cell fractionation, both POSH and JIP-1 accumulate in the perinuclear area in response to an apoptotic stimulus. Next, we assessed the subcellular distribution of our various ΔRing POSH constructs after expression in 293 cells (Fig. 5B). Transfected ΔRing-POSH, which, like camptothecin, is an apoptotic stimulus, was mainly present in the nuclear-associated fraction. In contrast, ΔRing-POSH ΔSH3#3/4 and ΔRing-POSH ΔAA61-136/ΔSH3#3/4 were mainly expressed in the cytoplasmic fraction. ΔRing-POSH ΔSH3#3 exhibited an intermediate level of distribution between the two fractions. Thus, perinuclear translocation of POSH appears to require the capacity for association with JIP-1. In support of this, similar findings were obtained when POSH constructs were co-expressed with JIP-1. That is, under such circumstances, the majority of ΔRing-POSH was recovered from the nuclear fraction, whereas most of ΔRing-POSH ΔSH3#3/4 was present in the cytoplasmic fraction (Fig. 5B). Finally, we determined whether JIP-1 translocation is dependent on POSH and/or POSH interaction. In the absence of co-expressed POSH, transfected JIP-1 was observed entirely in the cytoplasmic fraction (Fig. 5C). However, in the presence of either ΔRing-POSH or ΔRing-POSH ΔSH3#3/4 a substantial level of JIP-1 was recovered from the nuclear fraction (Fig. 5C). Thus, ΔRing-POSH ΔSH3#3/4, which neither localizes to the nuclear fraction nor binds well to JIP-1, nevertheless promotes JIP-1 translocation. This suggests that JIP-1 translocation does not require direct interaction with POSH but rather that it may be dependent on a POSH-mediated action. Although many individual components of pathways that lead to activation of JNKs have been described, questions remain about how these are brought together and about how they are directed toward various JNK actions such as the promotion of apoptosis. In the present work, we have focused on one well described apoptotic pathway in which sequential activation of the kinases MLK and MKK-4/7 lead to activation of JNKs and consequent cell death. Collectively, our findings support a model (depicted in Fig. 6) in which propagation of this pathway depends on the cooperative interaction of two scaffold proteins, POSH and JIP. Within this multiprotein complex, for which we propose the name PJAC, POSH binds and activates MLKs, which leads in turn to sequential activation of MKK-4/7 and JNKs that are recruited to the complex by JIPs. Our data further indicate that the ratio of POSH to JIP in such complexes is 1:1. A number of observations support this model. We found that POSH and JIP complex with one another in vitro and that both the exogenously expressed and endogenous proteins interact with one another in living cells. Although POSH has been found to directly bind MLKs and to interact with MKK-4/7 and JNKs, our data reveal that the association with MKK-4/7 and JNK is indirect and requires the presence of JIPs. Moreover, mutant forms of POSH that retain the capacity to bind and activate MLKs, but that bind only poorly to JIPs, show a greatly reduced interaction with MKK-4/7 and JNK-1 and are deficient in promoting JNK phosphorylation/activation. Such findings support the model that POSH and JIP play complementary roles in PJAC with the former recruiting and activating MLKs and the latter delivering MKK-4/7 to the complex as a substrate for MLKs. Although our findings support a role for PJAC in cell death, they do not indicate that the complex is specifically formed in response to apoptotic stimuli. The complex was detectable in healthy cells but at relatively low levels. Our present and past data show that apoptotic stimuli lead to a considerable elevation of cellular levels of POSH, MLKs, and JIP-1 via protein stabilization (20Xu Z. Kukekov N.V. Greene L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 9949-9959Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and that this in turn is reflected by a large increase in cellular PJAC levels. Thus, it appears that cell death is driven by the increase in PJAC levels because of elevation of its components rather than to any major effect of apoptotic stimuli on formation of the complex per se. JIPs have been reported to directly bind MLK family members (12Dickens M. Rogers J.S. Cavanagh J. Raitano A. Xia Z. Halpern J.R. Greenberg M.E. Sawyers C.L. Davis R.J. Science. 1997; 277: 693-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). However, our past (10Xu Z. Kukekov N.V. Greene L.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 252-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 20Xu Z. Kukekov N.V. Greene L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 9949-9959Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and present findings indicate that the presence of POSH and its interaction with JIPs are required for efficient JNK activation. For example, overexpression of JIP alone does not drive JNK activation and only does so when co-expressed with the MLKs (5Xu Z. Maroney A.C. Dobrzanski P. Kukekov N.V. Greene L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4713-4724Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Of further relevance, we noted a large reduction in MLK-induced JNK phosphorylation in cells with knocked down POSH expression (20Xu Z. Kukekov N.V. Greene L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 9949-9959Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), seen in Fig. 6C. Finally, it appears that at least in the case of the MLK family member DLK, only the inactive form of the enzyme directly binds JIPs (21Nihalani D. Meyer D. Pajni S. Holzman L.B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3447-3458Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Past and present work also supports a role for PJAC in cell death as well as in JNK activation. Forced expression of POSH induces cell death via activation of MLKs, MKK-4/7, and JNKs, whereas knockdown of POSH expression is protective from death (10Xu Z. Kukekov N.V. Greene L.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 252-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Moreover, mutant POSH that retains MLK binding but that is impaired in interaction with JIP to form the PJAC complex is ineffective in promoting death on its own or in synergizing the proapoptotic activity of MLK-2. Several studies have also underscored the role of JIP-1 in cell death. Whitmarsh et al. (15Whitmarsh A.J. Kuan C.Y. Kennedy N.J. Kelkar N. Haydar T.F. Mordes J.P. Appel M. Rossini A.A. Jones S.N.

Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2421-2432Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) reported that neurons (both in vivo and in vitro) from animals null for JIP-1 expression showed marked reduction in JNK activation and death in response to excitotoxic stress and oxygen-glucose deprivation. In another study, the brains of JIP-1 null animals, in comparison with wild type controls, did not show sustained JNK activation and had much smaller infarct volumes in response to a transient focal ischemic insult. Our findings indicate that apoptotic stimuli promote several changes in the PJAC complex. For one, as discussed above, the total level of cellular PJAC increases because of stabilization and elevated expression of several of its components. Presumably, this change plays a role in promotion of JNK activation and of cell death. In addition, our observations indicate that both JIP-1 and POSH accumulate in the perinuclear region. Such a translocation has been previously described for JIP-1 (14Yasuda J. Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Sharma M. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7245-7254Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which this occurs is unclear, but past work indicates that JIPs bind to microtubule-associated motor proteins and that this regulates their intracellular distribution (22Verhey K.J. Meyer D. Deehan R. Blenis J. Schnapp B.J. Rapoport T.A. Margolis B. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 959-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). The increase in total cellular PJAC levels may also contribute to the enhanced perinuclear accumulation of the complex. Our data indicate that perinuclear accumulation of POSH requires its association with JIPs, but not vice versa. Thus, consistent with its known association with motor proteins, the JIP component of the complex appears to be responsible for the change in subcellular distribution. The functional role of this redistribution is presently unknown. One possibility is that the presence of JIPs and POSH, and presumably of PJAC, in the perinuclear region may facilitate the proapoptotic phosphorylation of c-Jun. Activation of MLKs and JNKs has been associated with a variety of cellular functions in addition to induction of death (1Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3570) Google Scholar). Our findings raise the possibility that scaffolds such as POSH and JIPs may modulate the functional activities of these enzymes by preferentially directing them to specific cellular targets or compartments. In case of PJAC, these activities appear to be associated with induction of cell death. We thank Dr. R. Davis (UMASS) for providing JIP constructs, R. Townley (Columbia University) for his help with generation of POSH peptide for production of antisera, and Drs. Carol M. Troy and Dmitry Goryunov (Columbia University) for their assistance with microscopy."
https://openalex.org/W2080647590,"Reactive oxygen species have been shown to play an important role in the regulation of distinct signaling cascades, many of which act upon the production of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP). Using a series of redox-engineered cell lines we have previously demonstrated that MMP-1 expression is sensitive to the alterations in the steady state production of H2O2 (Ranganathan, A. C., Nelson, K. K., Rodriguez, A. M., Kim, K. H., Tower, G. B., Rutter, J. L., Brinckerhoff, C. E., Epstein, C. J., Huang, T. T., Jeffrey, J. J., and Melendez, J. A. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 14264–14270). In the present study, we investigate the molecular mechanisms involved in the H2O2-mediated induction of MMP-1. Mutational analysis of an MMP-1 promoter indicates that both the single nucleotide polymorphism creating an Ets binding site at –1607 and a proximal AP-1 site at –1602 are required for maximal H2O2-dependent transcription. The redox-sensitive MMP-1 protein expression requires activation of both ERK1/2 and JNK pathways. Importantly, JNK signaling is largely responsible for the H2O2 sensitivity of the MMP-1 promoter, whereas ERK1/2 contributes to both its basal and H2O2 dependence. H2O2 control of Ets-1 expression was ERK1/2-dependent whereas that of c-Jun requires both ERK1/2 and JNK signaling. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays indicate that binding of the histone acetyltransferase, p300, and the transcription factors Ets-1 and c-Jun to the MMP-1 promoter is redox sensitive. The redox sensitivity of MMP-1 expression is also associated with an increase in the abundance of oxidatively inactivated protein-tyrosine phosphatases. Targeted cytosolic or mitochondrial scavenging of H2O2 prevented all of the aforementioned signals. These studies provide substantial insight into the mechanisms underlying the redox-dependent control of MMP-1 and may lead to the development of novel targeted antioxidant-based inhibitory therapies for controlling MMP-1 expression during degenerative disease processes.

Under normal physiological conditions MMPs are important for development and wound healing; however, their augmented expression is associated with numerous disease pathologies (2Stamenkovic I. J. Pathol. 2003; 200: 448-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). For example, MMPs are important at many stages of metastasis and the high level expression of the MMP family member, MMP-1, has been linked to poor prognosis in many types of cancers (3Gao C.Q.

Brinckerhoff C.E. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5321-5325PubMed Google Scholar) identified a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) guanine insertion at –1607 (1G → 2G) base pairs that enhances the basal rate of transcription by creation of an Ets binding domain. Ets transcription factors include a large family of helix-turn-helix proteins (11Sharrocks A.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 827-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar) that normally do not bind DNA alone, but preferentially form coactivator complexes with transcription factors, like activator protein-1 (AP-1) (12Westermarck J. Kahari V.M. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 781-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar). The proto-oncoproteins Fos and Jun, which comprise the AP-1 complex, can homo- or heterodimerize and bind its cognate consensus sequence (TGACTCA) in the regulatory domains of many genes including various MMP family members (13Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 589-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar). Both Ets and AP-1 play a critical role in regulating the expression of various MMP family members, particularly that of MMP-1 (14Westermarck J. Seth A. Kahari V.M. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2651-2660Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The MMP-1 SNP is associated with a higher risk of metastasis in patients with a variety of distinct cancers (15Wood G.A.

More striking is the finding that both Ets-1 and MMP-1 immunoreactivity is high in stromal tissue adjacent to the leading edge of several tumor types (12Westermarck J. Kahari V.M. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 781-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar). The two-electron reduction product of oxygen, H2O2 has emerged as a potent signaling molecule and can modulate MMP expression and activity (20Argiles J.M. Lopez-Soriano J. Busquets S. Lopez-Soriano F.J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 743-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). H2O2-sensitive signaling molecules ERK1/2 and JNK are important in regulating MMP-1 expression (12Westermarck J. Kahari V.M.

Furthermore, numerous reports indicate that transcription factors important for MMP-1 expression are also redox-sensitive (23Clerk A. Michael A. Sugden P.H. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 581-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 24Sanij E. Hatzistavrou T. Hertzog P. Kola I. Wolvetang E.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 287: 1003-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) phosphorylates and activates AP-1 members including c-Jun and JunB (25Reddy S.P. Mossman B.T. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell Mol. Physiol. 2002; 283: L1161-L1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) whereas c-Jun, c-Fos, FosB, Fra-1, and Ets family member, Ets-1, are sensitive to ERK activation (25Reddy S.P. Mossman B.T. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell Mol. Physiol. 2002; 283: L1161-L1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Because both AP-1 and Ets transcription factors are subject to regulation by JNK and/or ERK and are redox-regulated, we sought to determine the role these factors play in the H2O2 -dependent regulation of MMP-1. Using well characterized redox-engineered HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cell lines (26Rodriguez A.M. Carrico P.M. Mazurkiewicz J.E. Melendez J.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 801-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) this study demonstrates that the proximal Ets and AP-1 binding sites in the MMP-1 promoter are required for maximal H2O2-dependent expression. We also established that JNK confers redox sensitivity to the MMP-1 promoter whereas both ERK and/or JNK are required for maximal basal promoter activity and the expression of AP-1 and Ets-1. Lastly, both c-Jun and Ets-1 and the histone acetyltransferase, p300 are recruited to the region of the MMP-1 SNP in response to alterations in the steady state production of H2O2. Thus, H2O2 plays an important role in regulating chromatin remodeling events that lead to optimal MMP-1 transcriptional activity. These findings indicate that diseases which are associated with augmented MMP-1 production may be amenable to targeted antioxidant based therapeutic intervention. Cell Culture and Reagents—All indicated cell lines were maintained in 25-cm2 flasks in MEM containing 10% fetal calf serum, 1000 units/ml penicillin, 500 μg/ml streptomycin, and 1 mg/ml neomycin in a 37 °C incubator containing 5% CO2. Constructions of the recombinant Sod2 and catalase plasmids and transfections were previously described in detail (26Rodriguez A.M. Carrico P.M. Mazurkiewicz J.E. Melendez J.A. Free Radic. Biol.

Cells were treated with recombinant human tumor necrosis factor (TNF) (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), U0126, U0124, PD98059, SB203580 (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA), or SP600125 (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). Ebselen, N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC), Trolox (Oxis Int.), and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) were used at concentrations that have been reported to inhibit UVA-dependent MMP-1 expression (28Polte T. Tyrrell R.M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2004; 36: 1566-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The antioxidant porphyrin, was a kind gift of Dr. B. Kalayanaraman of the Medical College of Wisconsin. All reagents were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise indicated. Construction and Transient Transfection of MMP-1 Deletion Constructs—The full-length human MMP-1 promoter/luciferase reporter plasmids (1G and 2G) contained the firefly luciferase gene under the transcriptional control of the human MMP-1 promoter in a pGL3 basic reporter vector (Promega, Madison, WI) and were kindly provided by Dr. Constance Brinckerhoff (Dartmouth University). Transfection and analysis of MMP-1 promoter luciferase activity have been described in detail by Nelson et al. (29Nelson K.K. Ranganathan A.C. Mansouri J. Rodriguez A.M. Providence K.M. Rutter J.L. Pumiglia K. Bennett J.A. Melendez J.A. Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 424-432PubMed Google Scholar). Treatments with MAPK inhibitors, PD98059 (50 μm), SB203580 (20 μm), U0126 (50 μm), U0124 (50 μm), and SP600125 (10 μm) were performed 4-h post-transfection for 18 h following removal and addition of complete medium. Construction of Mutant AP-1, Sod2, and Scrambled 1G MMP-1 Promoter Constructs—An active site mutant form of human MnSOD (H26L) (abbreviated mutSod2) was generated by the Dr. Larry W. Oberley laboratory at the University of Iowa (Iowa City, IA), and shown to have ∼70% less activity compared with wild-type human MnSOD (30Kim A. Oberley L.W. Oberley T.D. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2005; 39: 1128-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The mutant 1G and AP-1 promoter constructs were prepared by changing the wild-type 1G from 5′-AAAGATATGACTTA-3′ to the form 5′-AAACTTATGACTTA-3′ (m1G) or to the mutant AP-1 and m1G form 5′-AAACTTAGTCATTA-3′ (m1G mAP). An AatII and EcoRV site located 5′ and 3′ to the mutation, respectively, allowed for digestion of flanking sequences and subsequent ligation into a previously digested pGL3-MMP-1 construct with ends compatible with the digested fragment. The respective sense and antisense primer pairs used for mutant construction are described below: AatII: sense, 5′-CAGTGTATGAGACTCTTCC-3′; EcoRV: antisense, 5′-CAGTGGAGAAACACTGGC-3′; 1G: scrambled, 5′-AATAATTAGAAACTTATGACTTAT-3′, 5′-ATAAGTCATAAGTTTCTAATTATT-3′; 1G and AP-1 double mutants, 5′-AATAATTAGAAACTTAGTCATTAT-3′, 5′-ATAATGACTAAGTTTCTAATTATT-3′. The corresponding products of these reactions were combined and used as the template for the AatII and the EcoRV primers to create the final fragment containing the appropriate mutant Ets or mutant Ets/mutant AP-1 sites. The native sites and mutations (bold) are as follows: 1GmAP-1, 5′-.... GATATGACTTATCT... -3′ 5′-... GATAGTCATTATCT... -3′, m1G 5′-.... TAGAAAGATATGA... -3′ 5′-... TAGAAACTTATGA... -3′, m1GmAP, 5′-.... TAGAAAGATATGACTTATCT... -3′ 5′-... TAGAAACTTAGTCATTATCT...-3′. All mutants were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Immunoblotting—Media from confluent cells were analyzed for MMP-1 by Western blotting. Complete media from the cells were normalized to cell count and incubated overnight at 4 °C with 50 μl of heparin-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). The beads were centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 5 min and boiled for 5 min in Hanks Buffer Salt Solution, followed by the addition of 5× loading dye containing 5% 2-mercaptoethanol. Eluates were then analyzed on a 10% SDS-PAGE followed by Western immunoblotting using monoclonal MMP-1 antibody (R&D Systems) at 1:400 in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% milk followed by incubation with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody at a 1:4000 dilution for 1 h at 25°C (Amersham Biosciences). Detection of the proteins was performed by the addition of Pierce SuperSignal Chemiluminescent Substrate for 5 min and exposure to Kodak MS radiographic film (Kodak, Rochester, NY). JNK immunoblotting was performed on cell lines grown to 90% confluence and washed three times with ice-cold 1× PBS. Nuclear preparation was performed for phosphospecific JNK, whereas whole cell lysates were used for total JNK Western blots. For total cell lysates, cells were resuspended in 1× PBS/EDTA and sonicated. Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA protein assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). 30 μg of protein was resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted as described above. Blots were incubated with a rabbit polyclonal phosphospecific JNK antibody (BIOSOURCE, Camarillo, CA) at 1:1000 in TTBS containing 5% milk followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Biosciences) at 1:100,000 for 1 h at room temperature. Immunoreactive JNK was visualized as described above. The immunoblots were stripped and reprobed using rabbit polyclonal antibody (BIOSOURCE) that recognizes JNK regardless of its phosphorylation state at a 1:1000 dilution overnight. The blot was washed and subsequently incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary anti-rabbit antibody (Amersham Biosciences) at 1:100,000, and immunoreactive protein was detected as described above. Fra-1, c-Jun, c-Fos, and Ets-1 were analyzed by Western blotting with either rabbit anti-human Fra-1, Ser63 c-Jun, Ser73 c-Jun, c-Jun, c-Fos monoclonal (broad or specific), or Ets-1 polyclonal antibodies, (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) at 1:1000 dilution. Blots were then incubated with the appropriate secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (1:5000) and developed as described above. Phospho-c-Jun blots were performed using nuclear lysates. In-gel Phosphatase Assay—In-gel phosphatase assays and phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitations were performed essentially as described by Meng et al. (31Meng T.C. Fukada T. Tonks N.K. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 387-399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—Confluent cells lines were treated with 37% formaldehyde to cross-link proteins to DNA for 10 min at 37 °C. 0.33 ml of 1.25 m glycine was added to the flasks to stop the reaction. The cells were washed twice with cold 1× PBS containing 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cells were scraped off in this buffer and pelleted at 2000 rpm for 4 min at 4 °C. 200 μl of warm SDS lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors was added and incubated for 10 min on ice. Cells were sonicated to generate ∼500-bp DNA fragments. Before adding antibody, 25 μl of lysate was saved as the input sample. Either 2 μl of Ets-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or c-Jun (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA) antibody was added to the lysate with cold 1× PBS containing protease inhibitors and rocked overnight at 4 °C. The following day, 40 μl of protein A-agarose beads per sample (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were washed three times with 1× PBS and twice with SDS lysis buffer, and beads were resuspended in lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors. 40 μl of beads was added to samples and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with gentle agitation. Beads were washed twice with lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors, once with lysis buffer and 500 mm NaCl, once with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 m LiCl, 0.5% IPEGAL, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA without protease inhibitors, and once with TE, pH 8.0. The precipitate was eluted from beads with 100 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS for 15 min at 65 °C. Beads were pelleted for a few seconds at 14,000 rpm, and supernatant was transferred to a new tube. The eluates and input samples were incubated at 65 °C overnight to reverse cross-links. The following day, 250 μl of TE, 5 μg of glycogen, and 100 μg of proteinase K were added and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. 55 μl of 4 m LiCl were added to each sample, and DNA was extracted using a standard phenol-chloroform method. The extracted DNA was kept in TE, pH 8.0 and subjected to PCR using MMP-1-specific primers to amplify the region between –1978 and –1523 of the MMP-1 promoter. Real Time ChIP PCR—One microliter of ChIP-derived DNA was used as template in a 20-μl reaction containing 10 μlof2× SYBR Green Master Mix (Bio-Rad). Real time thermal cycling was performed using a MyiQ Cycler thermal cycler (Bio-Rad), with continuous SYBR Green monitoring according to the manufacturer's recommendations, using iCycler software. All PCR reactions were performed in duplicate and included negative controls (no DNA). Pre-IP and post-IP DNA samples were amplified using previously described parameters. Ct values were obtained after completion of reaction, which is the cycle at which fluorescence rises above a baseline threshold. The DNA units in the samples were calculated as 2–(Ct IP–Ct Input) × 1000. Native Sod PAGE—PAGE was performed as described in detail by Rodriguez et al. (26Rodriguez A.M. Carrico P.M. Mazurkiewicz J.E. Melendez J.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 801-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—Analysis of variance with α = 0.05 was used for processing the data. Two sample Student's t test was used as the post test. Values are expressed as means ± S.E. of the respective test or control group. Data are representative of at least three independent experiments. Identification of Redox-responsive MMP-1 Promoter Elements—We have previously reported that H2O2 enhances the activity of MMP-1 promoter containing the 2G SNP (29Nelson K.K. Ranganathan A.C. Mansouri J. Rodriguez A.M. Providence K.M. Rutter J.L. Pumiglia K. Bennett J.A. Melendez J.A. Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 424-432PubMed Google Scholar, 32Ranganathan A.C. Nelson K.K. Rodriguez A.M. Kim K.H. Tower G.B. Rutter J.L. Brinckerhoff C.E. Epstein C.J. Huang T.T. Jeffrey J.J. Melendez J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14264-14270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Analysis of the full-length promoter containing the 2G polymorphism indicated that the region between –1702 and –1602 is required for optimal activation of the MMP-1 promoter by H2O2. Within this 100-bp region, there are many Ets and AP-1 binding sites including the Ets site created by the SNP at position –1607 and a very proximal AP-1 site at –1602 within the MMP-1 promoter. Given the importance of the 2G SNP in MMP-1 promoter activity and that of AP-1 in MMP-1 regulation, the impact of mutations of these sites was assessed. The activities of the full-length 1G and 2G MMP-1 promoter constructs were increased in response to the mitochondrial production of H2O2 in cells overexpressing Sod2 (Fig. 1A). Mutating the AP-1 site in the context of the 1G (1GmAP) or 2G (2GmAP) promoter decreased MMP-1 promoter activity. Mutation of the 1G region (m1G) or both the 1G and AP-1 sites (m1GmAP1) further decreased MMP-1 promoter activity (Fig. 1C). Thus, both the 1G region and the AP-1 binding sites are required for activation of the MMP-1 promoter both basally and in response to alterations in the steady state production of H2O2. H2O2 Regulates AP-1 and Ets-1 Expression—The levels of AP-1 factors play an important role in regulating the expression of AP-1 responsive genes. To define whether intracellular H2O2 affects the expression of transcription factors that control MMP-1 promoter activity we analyzed protein levels of both AP-1 and ETS-1 in the redox-engineered cell lines. Cultured media from the indicated cell lines were collected and examined for the level of secreted MMP-1 (Fig. 2, A and B). MMP-1 levels were increased in response to enforced expression of Sod2. In addition to the Sod2-overexpressing HT-1080 cells, catalase-overexpressing cell lines were developed to test the role of H2O2 on gene expression. We have directed catalase expression to both the cytosolic and mitochondrial compartments that are distinct from its normal peroxisomal location. In this fashion signaling components that are sensitive to either mitochondrial or cytosolic H2O2 can be defined. Coexpression of catalase in the Sod2-overexpressing cells did not completely attenuate the expression of immunoreactive MMP-1 (Fig. 2, A and B). Sod2 overexpression also increased the protein levels of many of the AP-1 family members including; c-Fos, phosphorylated Jun, and the Ets family member ets-1. The Sod2-dependent increase in the expression of both the AP-1 and Ets family members was reversed by coexpression of catalase in either the cytosolic or mitochondrial compartment (Fig. 2, A and C). However, the AP-1 family member fra-2 was insensitive to changes in the steady state production of H2O2 resulting from antioxidant enzyme overexpression. JNK historically has been studied as the primary kinase responsible for phosphorylating c-Jun (33Hsu T.C. Young M.R. Cmarik J. Colburn N.H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 1338-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Analysis of phosphorylated and total forms of JNK showed that its phosphorylation state and protein expression are also redox-dependent, and these increases may account for the increase expression of the phosphorylated forms of c-Jun in response to Sod2 expression (Fig. 2, A and B). These data establish that many of the factors that are involved in regulating MMP-1 expression are also under redox control. However, only a partial reduction in Sod2-driven MMP-1 expression was observed in response to catalase overexpression even when both Ets-1 and c-Fos were significantly attenuated. The Antioxidants N-Acetyl Cysteine, Ebselen, and Antioxidant Porphyrin Treatments Restrict Sod2-mediated MMP-1 Expression—The failure of catalase overexpression to completely reverse the Sod2-mediated increase in MMP-1 expression, prompted us to evaluate the impact of various antioxidants on the redox-dependent induction of MMP-1. Treatment of cells with the glutathione precursor, N-acetyl cysteine, or the glutathione peroxidase mimetic ebselen completely reversed the Sod2-mediated increase in MMP-1 expression, whereas the lipid hydroperoxide scavengers trolox and butylated hydroxy toluene had a limited effect on MMP-1 expression. Treatment of Sod2-overexpressing cell lines with the redox-active porphyrin, an efficient H2O2 scavenger (34Konorev E.A. Kotamraju S. Zhao H. Kalivendi S. Joseph J. Kalyanaraman B. Free Radic. Biol Med. 2002; 33: 988-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), also reversed the increase in MMP-1 expression in the Sod2-overexpressing cell lines. These findings indicate that efficient synthetic H2O2 scavengers can reverse the Sod2-dependent increases in MMP-1 expression. ERK1/2- and JNK-dependent Redox Regulation of MMP-1 and Transcription Factors—We have previously reported that ERK1/2 is critical for redox control of the MMP-1 promoter (32Ranganathan A.C. Nelson K.K. Rodriguez A.M. Kim K.H. Tower G.B. Rutter J.L. Brinckerhoff C.E. Epstein C.J. Huang T.T. Jeffrey J.J. Melendez J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14264-14270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). ERK1/2 can enhance the expression or the phosphorylation state of Ets-1, c-Fos (35Seidel J.J. Graves B.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 36McCarthy S.A. Chen D. Yang B.S. Ramirez J.J. Garcia Cherwinski H. Chen X.R. Klagsbrun M. Hauser C.A.

FASEB J. 1999; 13: 781-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar), and impact gene expression. Whether the redox state of the cell modulates the expression of these factors via ERK1/2 has not been established. Analysis of MMP-1 immunoreactive protein in control and Sod2-overexpressing cell lines indicates that the redox-dependent increase in its production is sensitive to inhibition by the pharmacologic inhibitors of ERK1/2, PD98059, and U0126 (Fig. 3, A and B). Furthermore, redox-dependent MMP production was not significantly altered by the inactive U0126 analog, U0124, or the P38 MAP kinase inhibitor, SB203580 (Fig. 3B). The H2O2-dependent induction of Ets-1 and c-Fos was also attenuated by inhibition of ERK1/2 but not the inactive analog U0124 (Fig. 3A). Overexpression of Sod2 also increased c-Jun levels and was reversed by the ERK1/2 inhibition (data not shown). These findings suggest that H2O2 regulates the levels of key determinants involved in regulating MMP-1 transcription through ERK1/2. Thus, the redox-dependent increase in the levels of c-Fos, c-Jun, and Ets-1 are paralleled by an increase the extracellular production of MMP-1 that is ERK1/2-sensitive. To evaluate the influence of JNK on the redox-dependent control of Jun the various redox-engineered cell lines were treated with the pharmacological JNK inhibitor, SP600125 and phosphospecific c-Jun analyzed. Phosphorylation of Jun at Ser63 and Ser73 was increased in response to Sod2 overexpression relative to control cells, which was attenuated by overexpression of mitochondrial catalase but not cytosolic catalase(Fig. 4A). The JNK inhibitor decreased the phosphorylation of both serine residues suggesting that alterations in the steady state production of H2O2 regulate Jun phosphorylation th"

The XYLT-II gene codes for a highly homologous protein, but its physiological function is not yet known. Here we present for the first time the construction of a vector encoding the full-length GFP-tagged human XT-I and the recombinant expression of the active enzyme in mammalian cells. We expressed XT-I-GFP and various GFP-tagged XT-I and XT-II mutants with C-terminal truncations and deletions in HEK-293 and SaOS-2 cells in order to investigate the intracellular localization of XT-I and XT-II. Immunofluorescence analysis showed a distinct perinuclear pattern of XT-I-GFP and XT-II-GFP similar to that of α-mannosidase II, which is a known enzyme of the Golgi cisternae. Furthermore, a co-localization of native human XT-I and α-mannosidase II could also be demonstrated in untransfected cells. Using brefeldin A, we could also show that both xylosyltransferases are resident in the early cisternae of the Golgi apparatus. For its complete Golgi retention, XT-I requires the N-terminal 214 amino acids.

Glycosylation enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of glycoproteins are localized in intracellular destinations in an ordered way to act sequentially on nascent oligosaccharide chains (1Roth J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 906: 405-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The mechanism for retention of the enzymes in the appropriate subcompartment as well as the domains of the enzymes that direct their localization are not fully understood; a common motif for retention of glycosyltransferases has not been found to date (2Colley K.J. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Two mechanisms of glycosyltransferase localization in the Golgi have been suggested: the kin recognition model (3Nilsson T. Slusarewicz P. Hoe M.H. Warren G. FEBS Lett. 1993; 330: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), where homo-/hetero-oligomerization of glycosyltransferases is responsible for Golgi retention, and the lipid bilayer model (4Munro S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4695-4704Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), which postulates that the length of the hydrophobic transmembrane domain of glycosyltransferases mediates Golgi retention. Furthermore, the involvement of the cytoplasmic domain for the retention of glycosyltransferases (5Milland J. Russell S.M. Dodson H.C. McKenzie I.F.C. Sandrin M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10374-10378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) is proposed. However, none of the discussed hypotheses explain the localization of glycosyltransferases to specific sites within the Golgi, suggesting that other alternative mechanisms might exist (2Colley K.J.

Houghton F. Gleeson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11836-11845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) for localization. Xylosyltransferase I (XT-I; EC 2.4.2.26) is the initiating enzyme in the biosynthesis of the common tetrasaccharide linkage region in glycosaminoglycan-containing proteoglycans (15Schwartz N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 6316-6321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Kearns A.E. Campbell S.C. Westley J. Schwartz N.B. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7477-7483Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). XT-I catalyzes the transfer of d-xylose from UDP-d-xylose to specific serine residues of the core protein (17Rodén L. Lennarz W.J. The Biochemistry of Glycoproteins and Proteoglycans. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1980: 269-314Google Scholar). We have shown that this enzyme is secreted to a great extent into the extracellular matrix, together with chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (18Götting C. Sollberg S. Kuhn J. Weilke C. Huerkamp C. Brinkmann T. Krieg T. Kleesiek K. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1999; 112: 919-924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Therefore, XT-I activity was proposed to be a diagnostic marker for the determination of alterations in the proteoglycan metabolism (19Weilke C. Brinkmann T. Kleesiek K. Clin. Chem. 1997; 43: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, the role of XT-I in the extracellular matrix is not yet known, and it has been speculated that proteolysis within the stem domain and release of the catalytic domain might be a mechanism of down-regulating cellular activity (20Grabenhorst E. Conradt H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36107-36116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). XT-I activities in synovial fluid were found to be significantly increased in chronic inflammatory joint diseases (21Kleesiek K. Reinards R. Okusi J. Wolf B. Greiling H. J. Clin. Chem. Clin. Biochem. 1987; 25: 473-481PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, we detected elevated levels of XT-I in the sera of patients with systemic sclerosis and in the seminal plasma of infertile men (18Götting C. Sollberg S. Kuhn J. Weilke C. Huerkamp C.

Acta. 2002; 317: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In previous studies, we could prove the existence of a gene encoding for XT-II in higher organisms. This gene codes for a protein with regions of more than 80% homology to XT-I (overall 55% identity) (24Götting C. Kuhn J. Zahn R. Brinkmann T. Kleesiek K. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 517-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). However, the catalytic and physiological functions of XT-II remain unknown. Both enzymes are type-II transmembrane proteins, but the precise localization of neither enzyme could be defined. Several studies tried to identify the intracellular compartment where xylosylation occurs; there are data available suggesting a Golgi localization (25Nuwayhid N. Glaser J.H. Johnson J.C. Conrad H.E.

Proc. 1985; 44: 369-372PubMed Google Scholar). None of these analyses used a tagged form of the protein, but they focused on the determination of enzyme activity after separation of the subcellular compartment by centrifugation. To date, only one partial human XT-I cDNA has been cloned, lacking the 5′-end with the translation initiation codon and the potential transmembrane domain (24Götting C. Kuhn J. Zahn R. Brinkmann T. Kleesiek K. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 517-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In the present study, we cloned and expressed for the first time the active form of the full-length human XT-I in mammalian cells. To investigate the intracellular localization and the retention signal, various green fluorescent protein GFP-tagged mutants of XT-I and XT-II were constructed and analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy. Parts of the stem regions of XT-I and XT-II were identified as those domains that are responsible for intracellular localization. The function of the stem region is supported by the cytoplasmic and the transmembrane domains. The catalytic domain of XT-I is not implicated in their localization, and the region responsible for Golgi targeting is not associated with the activity of the enzyme. This is the first report on gene cloning of the full-length human XT-I and the application of GFP-tagged XT-I and XT-II variants to identify the subcellular localization and the signals required for this. Cell Culture—HEK-293 cells (human, embryonic kidney) (ICN Biomedicals, Meckenheim) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (PAA Laboratories, Pasching, Austria) and SAOS-2 cells (human, osteosarcoma) (ATCC, Manassas, VA) in RPMI 1640 (Cambrex, Verviers, Belgium). Both media were supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Biowest, Nuaillé, France), l-glutamine (PAA Laboratories), and antibiotic-antimycotic (Biowest). The cells were cultured at 37 °C under an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air at 100% relative humidity. Generation and Cloning of Full-length GFP-tagged Human XYLT-I cDNA—The IMAGE clone 2116905 (GenBank™ accession number AI524006) contains the N-terminal part (nucleotides -85 to 724) of the human XYLT-I cDNA, lacking two nucleotides (CG, between positions 40 and 41). These nucleotides were inserted using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and the following oligonucleotides: 5′-CTGGCCCGGCGCTCGCACTCGGCGCTGCTC-3′ and 5′-GAGCAGCGCCGAGTGCGAGCGCCGGGCCAG-3′ (inserted nucleotides are in boldface type and underlined). The obtained plasmid pSS0 was proved by double-stranded DNA sequencing using an ABI 310 DNA sequencing system with the ABI Prism Big Dye Terminator cycle sequencing kit and the ABI Prism 310 genetic analyzer from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. We used the pCG255-1 vector for the C-terminal XYLT-I region. This vector included nucleotides 444-2877 in the pMIB/V5 vector (Invitrogen) and encodes for the catalytic active region (30Kuhn J. Müller S. Schnölzer M. Kempf T. Schön S. Brinkmann T. Schöttler M. Götting C. Kleesiek K. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

J. 2005; 386: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In order to prepare the full-length GFP-tagged XYLT-I cDNA, we amplified the XYLT-I parts from pSS0 and pCG255-1 with Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase High Fidelity (Invitrogen) and primers incorporating the required restriction sites. The resulting PCR products were cloned into pCR2.1 TOPO vector and transformed into chemically competent E. coli TOP10 cells using the TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen). Plasmid DNA was isolated with the QIAprep spin miniprep kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). For the connection of both XYLT-I fragments to each other and to the pcDNA3.1/CT-GFP-TOPO vector (Invitrogen), the plasmids and the vector were doubly restricted. The N-terminal part was cleaved with BstXI (MBI Fermentas, St. Leon-Rot, Germany) and HindIII (New England BioLabs, Frankfurt, Germany), the C-terminal XYLT-I region was digested with XbaI (New England BioLabs), and HindIII and the vector were restricted with BstXI and XbaI. The resulting DNA fragments were ligated using T4 ligase (Promega, Heidelberg, Germany) with a temperature gradient from 30 to 10 °C over 12 h. This construct was transformed into TOP10 cells. The obtained clones were analyzed by double restriction digestion and double-stranded DNA sequencing. The QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit and the primers 5′-GAACTCTGTCCCCAAAGACTTTGAGAATGTGGAC-3′ and 5′-GTCCACATTCTCAAAGTCTTTGGGGACAGAGTTC-3′ were used to remove the generated HindIII restriction site, which was necessary for the fusion of the N- and the C-terminal XYLT-I parts. Multiple clones were sequenced to compensate for misreading. Construction of Truncated and Deleted XYLT-I and XYLT-II Variants—The GFP-tagged C-terminal truncated XT mutants were generated by PCR using pSS0 for XT-I and genomic DNA for XT-II as templates and HotStarTaq DNA polymerase (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) for amplification. The obtained products were cloned into the pcDNA3.1/CT-GFP-TOPO vector and transformed into chemically competent E. coli TOP10 cells using the GFP Fusion TOPO TA expression kit (Invitrogen) (Fig. 1). The deletion mutants were generated from suitable vectors with the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis Kit. Proceeding with pSS4 (Fig. 1) using the primers 5′-CCGCGCTCCGAAGATGAGCAGCCTCGACTCCGG-3′ and 5′-CCGGAGTCGAGGCTGCTCATCTTCGGAGCGCGG-3′, we generated the XT-I mutant containing only the stem region, and with pSS8 and the primers 5′-GGCCGCGCTCCGAAGATGTCGCACTCGGCGCTGCTC-3′ and 5′-GAGCAGCGCCGAGTGCGACATCTTCGGAGCGCGGCC-3′, we constructed the XT-I T variant. The XT-II S mutant was generated from pSS12 with the oligonucleotides 5′-GGGCAGGAAGATGTGGAGCTTCAGCG-3′ and 5′-CGCTGAAGCTCCACATCTTCCTGCCC-3′ and XT-II variant with only the T region was built from pSS13 with 5′-GGGCAGGAAGATGCTGGCGATTGCCAC-3′ and 5′-GTGGCAATCGCCAGCATCTTCCTGCCC-3′. All variants were sequenced to confirm the deletions and to ensure that no additional changes were introduced. Schematics of all mutants are shown in Fig. 1. Transfection—Plasmids were purified from bacterial cultures using the GenElute (HP) Plasmid Midiprep kit (Sigma). HEK-293 and SAOS-2 cells were seeded onto 6-well plates containing sterile coverslips. After 24 h, when the cells reached 30-40% confluence, the cells were transiently transfected using Fugene6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) as recommended by the manufacturer. Cells were then incubated for 48-72 h before immunostaining. At least two vectors encoding each XYLT variant and three independent transfection experiments were performed to ensure reproducibility of the results. Immunostaining—Cells on coverslips were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed in -20 °C chilled methanol for 15 min and then rinsed again in PBS. Fixed cells were permeabilized with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma) for 15 min at room temperature. The cells were washed with 0.1% bovine serum albumin in PBS. The cells were incubated for 1 h with the rabbit polyclonal to mannosidase II-Golgi marker (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) diluted 1:200 in 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS. In a second approach, untransfected cells were incubated for 1 h with the polyclonal rabbit antiserum, which was raised against a synthetic peptide homologous to the human XT-I (33Kuhn J. Götting C. Schnölzer M. Kempf T. Brinkmann T. Kleesiek K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4940-4947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). To remove unbound primary antibody, the cells were washed several times for 30 min with PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. The samples were then incubated for 1 h with TRITC- or FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) diluted 1:1000 or 1:100 in PBS with 1% bovine serum albumin. After several washes with PBS, nuclear staining was performed using DAPI (1:1000 in PBS; Chemicon, Hampshire, UK) for 30 min. The cells were washed and mounted with Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, UK). The fluorescence pattern was analyzed using a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-S microscope (Nikon, Düsseldorf, Germany). Inhibitor Treatment—Cells were incubated with 100 μg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma) either for 120 min in culture medium at 37 °C or for 90 min and then treated with 5 μg/ml brefeldin A (BFA; Sigma) for 30 min in the presence of cycloheximide in the culture medium. Fixation and staining were performed as described above. Assay for XT-I Enzyme Activity—Cell lysates were prepared with Nonidet P-40 cell lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, pH 7.8) to analyze intracellular XT-I activity. The method for determination of XT-I activity is based on the incorporation of [14C]d-xylose into silk fibroin as an acceptor (19Weilke C. Brinkmann T. Kleesiek K. Clin. Chem. 1997; 43: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The standard reaction mixture (100 μl) for the assay contained 50 μl of cell culture supernatant or diluted cell lysate, 25 mm 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid (pH 6.5), 25 mm KCl, 5 mm KF, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2,1 μm UDP-[14C]d-xylose (9.88 kBq/nmol; DuPont), and 30 μl of solubilized silk fibroin (10 mg/ml). After incubation at 37 °C for 90 min, the reaction mixtures were placed on nitrocellulose discs (Sartorius, Göttingen, Germany). The dried discs were washed with 10% trichloroacetic acid for 10 min and three times with 1% trichloroacetic acid. Incorporated radioactivity was measured after the addition of 3.5 ml of scintillation mixture using a LS5000TD liquid scintillation counter (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). The enzyme activity was expressed in units (1 unit = 1 μmol of incorporated xylose/min). Construction and Recombinant Expression of Active Full-length GFP-tagged XT-I—The separately existing N- and C-terminal parts of human XT-I cDNA were connected using PCR, restrictions, ligation, and site-directed mutagenesis. The obtained plasmid pSS1 contained 79 nucleotides of the 5′-untranslated region, including the native translation initiation sequence and the coding region (nucleotides 1-2877) of XT-I in frame with cycle 3 GFP. HEK-293 and SAOS-2 cells were transfected with pSS1 and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy, and the enzymatic activity was determined. The appearance of fluorescence 24 h posttransfection confirmed that GFP was in frame with XT-I. The activity of recombinant full-length GFP-tagged human XT-I was analyzed in the culture medium and in the cell lysates 72 h after transfection in comparison with the native XT-I activity in cells transfected with the control plasmid. HEK-293 cells show a 50-fold increase, and SAOS-2 cells show a 17-fold increase in XT-I activity in the supernatant and the lysates in comparison with the controls (Fig. 2). The XT-I activity in the supernatant is higher than in the cell lysates: 3-fold in HEK-293 and 4-fold in SAOS-2 cells. However, the ratio of secreted and retained XT-I activity is not altered in pSS1-transfected cells and the controls. Intracellular Localization of the Native XT-I—We investigated the subcellular localization of native XT-I in untransfected HEK-293 and SAOS-2 cells. Fluorescence microscopy was used after immunostaining with the XT-I or the Golgi antibody. The observed perinuclear staining pattern of the FITC-marked native XT-I is typical for localization in the Golgi compartment. Comparison with nuclear DAPI staining and the anti-mannosidase antibody confirmed this localization (Fig. 3A). The staining patterns were always similar to that of α-mannosidase II, which is a known resident enzyme of the medial Golgi complex. Cells were further stained with the XT-I or the Golgi marker after treatment with cycloheximide alone or cycloheximide and BFA. Cycloheximide blocks the de novo synthesis of proteins, and the fungal metabolite BFA has been used to distinguish between proteins residing within the cis-/medial/trans-cisternae and the trans-Golgi network. BFA causes the collapse of the contents of the cis-, medial, and trans-cisternae back to the ER, whereas proteins residing within the trans-Golgi network traffic to the microtubule organizing center (34Wilson I.B.H. Cell Mol. Life. Sci. 2003; 61: 794-809Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 35Driouich A. Zhang G.F. Staehelin L.A. Plant Physiol. 1993; 101: 1363-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). This redistribution allows the straightforward assignment of localization either in the Golgi cisterna or trans-Golgi network. The incubation with cycloheximide did not result in any altered XT-I or mannosidase staining patterns (figures not shown), indicating that the observed fluorescence reflects the true location of the mature proteins and is not the result of nascent protein still in the process of trafficking within the Golgi compartment or of protein being merely secreted in the extracellular space. After cycloheximide and BFA treatment and staining with the anti XT-I or the anti-mannosidase antibody, the perinuclear staining pattern was altered to diffuse cytoplasmic staining indicative of a localization in the endoplasmic reticulum (36Reaves B. Bunting G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 85-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A). All fluorescence patterns were identical for both cell lines used in our study. Together, these results support the conclusion that native XT-I is a Golgi-resident enzyme that is localized in the Golgi-cisternae and not in the trans-Golgi network. Intracellular Localization of Recombinant Full-length GFP-tagged XT-I—The subcellular localization of the recombinant full-length GFP-tagged XT-I was investigated in HEK-293 and SAOS-2 cells after transfection with pSS1. A perinuclear staining pattern of the GFP-tagged recombinant XT-I was observed, indicating a Golgi localization of the enzyme; co-localization with the anti-mannosidase antibody confirmed this Golgi localization (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, an analysis of the subcellular distribution of XT-I-GFP and the Golgi markers after treatment with cycloheximide alone and a combined cycloheximide and BFA treatment was performed. Again, cycloheximide treatment induced no alterations of the fluorescence pattern, whereas cycloheximide and BFA treatment resulted in a diffuse cytoplasmic staining typical of the ER (Fig. 3B). The merged images reveal that the localization of XT-I-GFP and mannosidase is still identical after Golgi disruption by cycloheximide and BFA treatment. All stainings were identical for all cell lines used, and no differences were observed between the localization of recombinant full-length XT-I-GFP or the native XT-I. In conclusion, these findings confirm that the recombinant full-length XT-I-GFP is also retained in the cisternae of the Golgi apparatus. Role of C, T, and S domains in XYLT-I—In order to determine which domains of XT-I are responsible for targeting the enzyme to the Golgi apparatus, cDNA constructs encoding GFP-tagged C, T, CT, S, or CTS domains with various lengths of S were made (Fig. 1A). We used predictions for the lengths of the putative C and T region based on hydropathy plot analysis. The NH2-terminal C-tail comprises the amino acids 1-13, and the T domain is located at positions 14-35. The length of the S region is not known, but we could recently show that the N-terminal truncated XT-I (Δ1-148) is active in High Five insect cells (30Kuhn J. Müller S. Schnölzer M. Kempf T.

The PCR products of the C, CT, and CTS variants were cloned at the C-terminal end in frame with GFP, and the deletion mutants T and S were made from CT and CTS using site-directed mutagenesis. All constructs were transfected into HEK-293 and SAOS-2 cells, and 2-3 days posttransfection, immunostaining with the Golgi marker was performed with or without cycloheximide and BFA treatment. The different resulting staining patterns were studied by fluorescence microscopy. In all experiments, no differences between HEK-293 and SAOS-2 cells were observed. The GFP fusion protein consisting of the regions CTS (amino acids 1-214; pSS2) is the only truncated variant reaching full Golgi retention as indicated by the identical punctuated staining pattern, the co-localization with the Golgi marker, and the diffuse ER-like pattern after BFA treatment as shown for the full-length XT-I (figures not shown, but patterns were identical to pSS1-transfected cells; Fig. 3B). The deletion of 56 amino acids (pSS3) from the S region changed the microscopic picture, and we could observe only a partial Golgi retention indicated by the higher density of GFP fluorescence in the perinuclear region. After BFA treatment, the fluorescence patterns changed, since the GFP fusion proteins that were formerly located in the Golgi cisternae were now redistributed into the ER (Fig. 4A). A complete loss of Golgi localization was reached when the S region was truncated to 69 amino acids (pSS6). The fluorescence was irregularly distributed over the whole cell, leaving out the nucleus (Fig. 4B). Comparison with the Golgi marker showed no concordance with the localization of the GFP-XT-I mutant, and in addition, BFA treatment did not result in any redistribution of the GFP fusion protein (figures not shown). We also observed identical staining patterns when we expressed the CT- and T-variants in pSS8- and pSS10-transfected cells (figures not shown). Expression of the C- and the S-constructs in pSS9- and pSS11-transfected cells resulted in GFP fluorescence being homogeneously distributed all over the cell (Fig. 4C) identical to the pattern of the control vector, which codes for the cycle 3 GFP without any signal sequence (figure not shown). Intracellular Localization of XT-II and Function of C, T, and S Domains—Analogous to XT-I, we designed five GFP fusion proteins consisting of the CTS, CT, C, T, and S region for XT-II to analyze their subcellular localization and the signal sequence responsible for targeting this glycoyltransferase (Fig. 1B). The hydropathy analysis of XT-II revealed that the cytoplasmic tail is built by amino acids 1-15 and that the potential membrane-spanning region consists of 16 hydrophobic amino acid residues at positions 16-32 (24Götting C. Kuhn J. Zahn R. Brinkmann T. Kleesiek K. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 517-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). All GFP fusion proteins were expressed in HEK-293 and SAOS-2 cells. Identical to our co-localization experiments with the XT-I variants, the subcellular localization was investigated by immunofluorescence microscopy after staining with the mannosidase II Golgi marker with and without cycloheximide and cycloheximide/BFA treatment.

However, an influence of the most common oncogenic signalling pathways onto DNA methylation has not yet been investigated thoroughly. To address this issue, we identified genes suppressed in HRAS-transformed rat fibroblasts but upregulated after treatment with the demethylating agent 5-Aza-2-deoxycytidine and with the MEK1,2 inhibitor U0126. Analysis of gene expression by microarray and Northern blot analysis revealed the MEK/ERK target genes clusterin, matrix metalloproteinase 2 (Mmp2), peptidylpropyl isomerase C-associated protein, syndecan 4, Timp2 and Thbs1 to be repressed in the HRAS-transformed FE-8 cells in a MEK/ERK- and methylation-dependent manner. Hypermethylation of putative regulatory elements in HRAS-transformed cells as compared to immortalized fibroblasts was detected within a CpG island 14.5 kb upstream of clusterin, within the clusterin promoter and within a CpG island of the Mmp2 promoter by bisulphite sequencing. Furthermore, hypermethylation of the clusterin promoter was observed 10 days after induction of HRAS in immortalized rat fibroblasts and a clear correlation between reduced clusterin expression and hypermethlyation could also be observed in distinct rat tissues. These results suggest that silencing of individual genes by DNA methylation is controlled by oncogenic signalling pathways, yet the mechanisms responsible for initial target gene suppression are variable."

Specifically, PrP regions 159–174 and 224–230 were shown to be buried and were the most resistant to denaturation. The 132–156 segment of PrP was found to be cryptic under native conditions and solvent-exposed under partially denaturing conditions, whereas the region 95–105 was solvent-accessible regardless of the solvent conditions. Remarkably, a subfraction of fibrils showed immunoreactivity to PrPSc-specific antibodies designated as IgGs 89–112 and 136–158.

These diseases, including sporadic CJD, display substantial variations in clinical symptoms, in neuropathological profile, and in age at onset of disease (3Hill A.F. Joiner S. Wadsworth J.D.F.

The coincidence of multiple prion strains or subtypes in natural prion isolates demands the development of an assay that is able to assess the conformational heterogeneity in mixtures of abnormal PrP isoforms. Over the past decade, a variety of biochemical and immunological assays have been established that discriminate PrPSc from PrPC and distinguish different strains or subtypes of PrPSc. These assays recognize different conformers of PrPSc by the extent of PK resistance, the size of the PK-resistant core, thermodynamic stability, or epitope presentation (7Safar J. Wille H. Itri V.

All previously developed assays, however, assess bulk properties of PrP molecules averaged across the whole molecular population but not the conformation of individual fibrils or particles.

Similar to the high heterogeneity of PrPSc subtypes generated in sporadic CJD, spontaneous polymerization of PrP in vitro under single growth conditions produces a range of amyloid fibrillar types (20Anderson M.

The specific conformational differences between fibrillar types have not yet been determined. Elucidation of the physical properties and conformational heterogeneity of individual synthetic fibrils is very important, considering that only a very small subfraction of fibrils produced in vitro appear to be infectious (21Legname G.

Although the fibrillar form of recombinant PrP was shown to induce transmissible prion disease in animals (21Legname G. Baskakov I.V. Nguyen H.-O.B. Riesner D. Cohen F.E. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B.

To date, the solid state NMR studies have been restricted to relatively short polypeptides that produce conformationally homogeneous well defined fibrils. The large size of full-length PrP molecules in combination with the highly heterogeneous nature of PrP fibrils limits the number of physical techniques that can be used for assessing the conformation of aggregated states of PrP.

Using an array of specific antibodies recognizing different PrP epitopes and PrP conformations, we have developed a novel immunoconformational assay referred to as the dual color assay. In contrast to previously established techniques, the newly developed assay probes the conformation within a single fibril or particle of aggregated PrP. Using amyloid fibrils prepared from full-length recombinant PrP, we demonstrated the utility of this assay to define (i) the regions of PrP that are surface-exposed or buried in aggregated forms of the protein, (ii) the susceptibility of defined PrP regions to GdnHCl-induced denaturation, and (iii) the conformational heterogeneity of fibrils measured across either the whole fibrillar population or within individual fibrils. Protein Expression, Purification, and Conversion into Amyloid Fibril—Full-length mouse recombinant PrP encompassing residues 23–230 (rPrP) was expressed and purified as described earlier (30Bocharova O.V. Breydo L. Parfenov A.S. Salnikov V.V. Baskakov I.V. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 645-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The purified rPrP was confirmed by SDS-PAGE, analytical size exclusion chromatography, and electrospray mass spectrometry to be a single monomeric species with an intact disulfide bond. In vitro conversion of rPrP to amyloid fibrils was carried out under standard conditions (in 1 m GndHCl, 3 m urea in 20 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, at 37 °C) as previously described (30Bocharova O.V. Breydo L. Parfenov A.S. Salnikov V.V. Baskakov I.V. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 645-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). At the end point of conversion (typically 24 h of incubation) the reaction was stopped, and rPrP fibrils were dialyzed overnight in 10 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, and stored at +4 °C. Double Color Assay—Amiloid fibrils and β-oligomeric forms of rPrP (0.5 μg/ml) were incubated for 1 h in Permanox 8-well Lab-Teks chamber slide system (200 μl/well) in 10 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, at room temperature. Formaldehyde was then added to a final concentration of 4% and incubated for 15 min, and the samples were washed with Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 50 mm glycine, pH 7.5, to reduce the autofluorescence background of the aldehydes. In GdnHCl-induced denaturation experiments, samples were treated with 4 or 6 m GdnHCl, as indicated, in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, for 1 h and then washed with TBS prior to assaying. Pairs of anti-PrP antibodies were applied in two consecutive steps. First, samples were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with one of the following anti-PrP human Abs: D13 (1:6000), D18 (1:6000), 89–112 (1:6000), 136–158 (1:6000), or R1 (1:400). This was followed by incubation for 1 h at room temperature with a secondary Ab, goat anti-human IgG (1:700), labeled with Alexa-488 (Invitrogen/Molecular Probes). Second, the samples were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a reference Ab, mouse IgG AG4 (1:1000), that recognizes epitope 37–50 in PrP, followed by incubation with secondary Ab, goat anti-mouse IgG (1:700), labeled with Alexa-546 (Invitrogen/Molecular Probes). In another combination, anti-PrP mouse IgG AH6 (1:400) was applied first and then the secondary Ab, goat anti-mouse IgG (1:700), labeled with Alexa-488, followed by incubation with anti-PrP human Fab P (1:1000) that was used as a reference antibody and then with a secondary Ab to Fab, goat anti-human IgG (1:700)-labeled Alexa-546. Staining with the primary antibodies was in TBS containing 0.25% Triton X-100, 5% normal horse serum, and 1% bovine serum albumin, and staining with the secondary antibodies was done in TBS containing 0.25% Triton X-100 and 2% bovine serum albumin. All antibodies were centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 rpm prior to staining; 0.25% Triton X-100 was present throughout the whole staining procedure. Slides were mounted with antifade fluorescence mounting medium (DAKO, Denmark). Immunofluorescence Imaging and Data Analysis—Fluorescence microscopy was carried out on an inverted microscope (Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U) with an illumination system X-Cite 120 (EXFO Photonics Solutions Inc.) connected through fiber optics using a 1.3 aperture Plan Fluor ×100 numerical aperture and ×60 objectives. Digital images were acquired using a cooled 12-bit CoolSnap HQ CCD camera (Photometrics). The exposure time for AG4 was 700 ms; for D13, D18, 89–112, and 136–158 it was 1400 ms; for P it was 800 ms; and for R1 and AH6 it was 1600 ms. The excitation irradiance was reduced twice when images were collected with a ×60 objective. Images collected from the two channels were processed with WCIF ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health). Manders' Coefficients and Colocalization Threshold plugins were used to obtain two-dimensional fluorescence intensity scattering plots (2D-FIS). The colocalization threshold plugin was also used to calculate the values of linear regression slopes (LRS). S.D. of LRS values were calculated from the analysis of 3–5 images from the same experiment. Analysis of different subpopulations of fibrils observed after staining with Abs 89–112 or 136–158 was performed using the Colocalization Finder plugin, which allowed us to highlight and select the fibrils with a specified ratio of intensities measured in the “red” and “green” channels. Intensity profiles of single fibrils were built with the RGB profiler plugin. Design of the Dual Color Immunoconformational Assay—Our assay consisted of double staining using different pairings of PrP-specific antibodies, where the reference Ab was specific to the epitope that is solvent-accessible, but the second Ab was specific to the epitope for which we wanted to assess the conformation (Fig. 2a). Because in PrPSc and in the fibrillar form of rPrP, the N-terminal region encompassing residues 23 to ∼90 is proteinase K-sensitive and solvent-accessible (31Bocharova O.V. Breydo L. Salnikov V.V. Gill A.C. Baskakov I.V. Protein Sci. 2005; 14: 1222-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), we used AG4 antibody specific to the epitope 37–59 as a reference Ab (Fig. 1). AG4 was used in pairs with one of the following Abs: D13 (epitope 95–105), D18 (epitope 132–156), R1 (epitope 224–230), 89–112, or 136–158 (Fig. 1, Table 1). IgGs 89–112 and 136–158 were previously shown to bind specifically to PrPSc but not to PrPC (32Moroncini G. Kanu N. Solforosi L. Abalos G. Telling G.C. Head M. Ironside J. Brockes J.P. Burton D.R. Williamson R.A. Proc. Acad. Natl. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10404-10409Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). These Abs seem to recognize nonlinear epitopes, the locations of which are currently unknown (Fig. 1) (32Moroncini G. Kanu N. Solforosi L. Abalos G. Telling G.C. Head M. Ironside J. Brockes J.P. Burton D.R. Williamson R.A. Proc. Acad. Natl. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10404-10409Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The secondary Ab to AG4 was labeled with Alexa-546 (red), and the secondary Ab to the remaining PrP specific Abs was labeled with Alexa-488 (green) (Fig. 2, a and b). When fluorescence microscopy was used for imaging, the double staining and subsequent merge of images collected in the red and green channels provided information regarding the solvent accessibility of the epitope of interest within individual fibrils (Fig. 2, b and c). A predominantly red color in the merged images indicated that the epitope of interest was largely buried; predominantly green color meant that the epitope of interest was solvent-accessible; whereas different tints of yellow and orange reflect slight differences in the accessibility of epitopes to the solvent (Fig. 2, b and c, bottom panels).FIGURE 1A schematic representation of full-length rPrP 23–230. The known binding epitopes of Fabs D13, P, D18, R1, and Abs AH6 and AG4 are highlighted in light gray. When converted into fibrillar form, the PK-resistant cores consist of residues 138–230, 152–230, and 162–230, highlighted as dark gray boxes (31Bocharova O.V. Breydo L. Salnikov V.V. Gill A.C.

Fabs 89–112 and 136–158 were generated by grafting mouse PrP sequences that correspond to amino acid residues 88–111 and 135–157, respectively, to recipient Ab (32Moroncini G. Kanu N. Solforosi L.

Open table in a new tab In the Fibrillar Form, the Epitope 95–105 Was Solvent-accessible, whereas the Epitope 132–156 Was Buried—Double staining of amyloid fibrils with AG/D13 revealed that under native conditions the epitope 95–105 was solvent-accessible (Fig. 3a). To analyze the fluorescence intensities in more detail, the microscopy images were transformed into 2D-FIS plots, where red fluorescence intensities are plotted on the horizontal axis, and the green intensities are plotted on the vertical axis (see insets to Fig. 3). As evident from the 2D-FIS plots, the amyloid fibrils consisted of a single population, which was relatively homogeneous with respect to the accessibility of the D13 epitope. From the 2D-FIS plot, the LRS can be calculated, a parameter that we used to measure the intrinsic accessibility of a particular epitope to a solvent. The LRS value of 1.307 ± 0.073 indicates that the D13 epitope is solvent-exposed under native conditions (Fig. 3a). The reactivity of D18 to PrP amyloid fibrils was substantially lower than that of D13, as reflected by the predominantly red color in microscopy images and by the low value of the LRS (0.349 ± 0.037) calculated from the 2D-FIS plot (Fig. 3b). Taken together, these data show that the epitope 132–156 was predominantly buried under the native conditions, whereas the epitope 95–105 was solvent-accessible (Table 1). To determine whether partial denaturation alters the accessibility of 95–105 and 132–156 epitopes, the fibrils were exposed to 4 m GdnHCl for 1 h prior to the dual color assay. We previously showed that the C½ value for the GdnHCl-induced denaturation of amyloid fibrils produced in vitro was 4.2 m (31Bocharova O.V. Breydo L. Salnikov V.V. Gill A.C. Baskakov I.V. Protein Sci. 2005; 14: 1222-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar); therefore, at 4 m GdnHCl, the amyloid fibrils were expected to preserve most of the cross-β-sheet structure; however, some of the fibrillar regions could undergo local unfolding. Upon partial denaturation, the color distribution in samples stained with D18 shifted toward the “green” sector, as was evident from significant shift of the LRS value from 0.349 ± 0.037 to 0.845 ± 0.139 and from the broadening of the fluorescence intensity distribution in the 2D-FIS plot (Fig. 3d). These changes indicated that the D18 epitope that was cryptic under the native conditions became partially exposed to the solvent upon partial denaturation. In contrast to the D18 epitope, the accessibility of the noncryptic D13 epitope remained the same (LRS value unchanged) regardless of whether amyloid fibrils were preincubated with GdnHCl (Fig. 3, compare a and c, Table 1). Highly Denaturing Conditions Were Required to Expose Epitopes 159–174 and 224–230—Our former studies revealed that in the fibrillar form, the PK-resistant cores are constructed from the C-terminal regions that encompass residues 152–230 and 162–230 (31Bocharova O.V. Breydo L. Salnikov V.V. Gill A.C. Baskakov I.V. Protein Sci. 2005; 14: 1222-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). These C-terminal regions are believed to compose the most thermodynamically stable cross-β-sheet structures of fibrils. To test the accessibility of epitopes within the C-terminal region, we used IgG AH6 and Fab R1, which bind to the residues 159–174 and 224–230, respectively (Fig. 1). Here, to avoid unwanted cross-reactivity with the secondary Ab to IgG, IgG AG4 (red channel) was used as a reference in a pair with Fab R1 (green channel), and Fab P (epitope 95–105, red channel) was paired with IgG AH6 (green channel) (Table 1). When stained with either R1 or AH6, the amyloid fibrils showed no detectable immunoreactivity in the green channels in the absence of GdnHCl, suggesting that both epitopes were completely buried in the fibrillar interior (Fig. 4, a and b, left panels). After incubation with 4 m GdnHCl, a subfraction of fibrils displayed a dotted pattern of fluorescence in the green channels when stained with either R1 or AH6 (Fig. 4, a and b, middle panels). Such dotted patterns could be due to the local exposure of epitopes to R1 or AH6 occurring at the fibrillar edges, at the sites of occasional fibrillar bending or fragmentation, or at the junction of several fibrils. The dotted pattern observed with R1 or AH6 was in sharp contrast to the relatively smooth and uniform pattern of fluorescence observed in fibrils that were pretreated with 4 m GdnHCl and stained with D18 (Fig. 4c). After exposure to a more severe denaturing environment (6 m GdnHCl), the number of spots detectable in green channels and the fluorescence intensity of the spots increased in fibrils stained with either R1 or AH6 (Fig. 4, a and b, right panels, as indicated by the green arrows). These reactive spots were often seen at the fibrillar edges or at sites of fibrillar junctions or overlaps. The appearance of large amorphous spots was indicative of extensive denaturation and loss of fibrillar shape. Notable differences in patterns of staining observed between D18 and either R1 or AH6 suggest strikingly different roles that the regions 132–156 and 159–230 play in fibrillar structure. The epitope to D18 became solvent-accessible under conditions where fibrils still maintained fibrillar shape, whereas full denaturation and loss of fibrillar shape seem to be required for the R1 and AH6 epitopes to be solvent-accessible. PrPSc-specific Fabs Distinguished Two Subpopulations in Fibrils—To probe the extent to which the amyloid fibrils produced in vitro are similar to PrPSc, we used IgGs 89–112 and 136–158. Both IgGs 89–112 and 136–158 were previously shown to bind specifically to PrPSc but not to PrPC (32Moroncini G. Kanu N. Solforosi L. Abalos G. Telling G.C. Head M. Ironside J. Brockes J.P. Burton D.R. Williamson R.A. Proc. Acad. Natl. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10404-10409Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). These motif-grafted Abs were generated by replacing the complementarity-determining region 3 in heavy chains of recipient Ab with mouse PrP sequences that correspond to amino acid residues 88–111 and 135–157, respectively (32Moroncini G. Kanu N. Solforosi L. A"
https://openalex.org/W1977032113,"According to the ""indirect"" excitotoxicity hypothesis, mitochondrial defects increase Ca2+ entry into neurons by rendering NMDA-R hypersensitive to glutamate. We tested this hypothesis by investigating in the rat striatum and cultured striatal cells how partial mitochondrial complex II inhibition produced by 3-nitropropionic acid (3NP) modifies the toxicity of the NMDA-R agonist quinolinate (QA). We showed that nontoxic 3NP treatment, leading to partial inhibition of complex II activity, greatly exacerbated striatal degeneration produced by slightly toxic QA treatment through an ""all-or-nothing"" process. The potentiation of QA-induced cell death by 3NP was associated with increased calpain activity and massive calpain-mediated cleavage of several postsynaptic proteins, suggesting major neuronal Ca2+ deregulation in the striatum. However, Ca2+ anomalies probably do not result from NMDA-R hypersensitivity. Indeed, brain imaging experiments using [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose indirectly showed that 3NP did not increase QA-induced ionic perturbations at the striatal glutamatergic synapses in vivo. Consistent with this, the exacerbation of QA toxicity by 3NP was not related to an increase in the QA-induced entry of 45Ca2+ into striatal neurons. The present results demonstrate that the potentiation of NMDA-R-mediated excitotoxicity by mitochondrial defects involves primarily intracellular Ca2+ deregulation, in the absence of NMDA-R hypersensitivity."

In the present study, by using DNA affinity chromatography and mass spectrometry, we have identified nucleolin as an additional protein that binds to a palindromic response region in the KLF2 promoter. The presence of nucleolin on the KLF2 promoter in macrophages was verified by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Interestingly, in mouse and human endothelial cell lines, electrophoretic mobility shift assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses indicated that nucleolin binds the KLF2 promoter only upon application of fluid shear stress. Pretreatment of the endothelial cells with LY294002, a specific inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), blocked the shear stress-induced binding of nucleolin to the promoter, demonstrating its PI3K-dependent regulation. Additionally, nucleolin exhibited dynamic flow-specific, PI3K-dependent alterations in size. Anti-nucleolin antibodies interacted with a 110-kDa form in static endothelial cells and with several catalytic forms that changed in abundance after the application of shear stress. Immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that fluid flow induced the interaction of nucleolin with the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K. Finally, introduction of small interfering RNAs targeting the nucleolin genetic sequence selectively reduced nucleolin expression and was sufficient to block the induction of KLF2 by shear stress.

Since its discovery, KLF2 (Krüppel-like factor 2) (also known as lung Krüppel-like factor) has proven vital to developmental and cellular functions in several distinct tissue types. The gene is highly conserved between mouse and human homologues and is expressed in similar tissues (lung, heart, skeletal muscle, pancreas, and placenta) in both animals (1Wani M.A. Conkright M.D. Jeffries S. Hughes M.J. Lingrel J.B. Genomics. 1999; 60: 78-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The KLF2 protein is a C2/H2 zinc finger DNA-binding protein of 354 amino acids with an approximate molecular mass of 38 kDa. Studies have demonstrated that KLF2 plays critical functional roles in adipocytes, erythrocytes, and T lymphocytes. Consistent with the role of Krüppel-like factors in late stage differentiation, KLF2 prevents the differentiation of pre-adipocytes in mature adipocytes (2Banerjee S.S. Feinberg M.W. Watanabe M.

It is also required for primitive erythropoiesis through the regulation of embryonic β-like globin genes (4Basu P. Morris P.E. Haar J.L. Wani M.A. Lingrel J.B. Gaensler K.M. Lloyd J.A. Blood. 2005; 106: 2566-2571Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In T cells, KLF2 has been shown to be an antiapoptotic and antiproliferative factor capable of maintaining T cell quiescence (5Kuo C.T. Veselits M.L. Leiden J.M.

Several tissue-specific downstream target genes of KLF2 have been identified, including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ in adipocytes (2Banerjee S.S. Feinberg M.W. Watanabe M. Gray S.

Immunol. 2005; 175: 3060-3066Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).The function and regulation of KLF2 in the vasculature has recently been the subject of intense research. During development, KLF2 is involved in an endothelium-mediated transcriptional pathway necessary for vessel stabilization (8Kuo C.T. Veselits M.L. Barton K.P. Lu M.M. Clendenin C. Leiden J.M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2996-3006Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 9Wani M.A. Means Jr., R.T. Lingrel J.B. Transgenic Res. 1998; 7: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in vitro and in vivo experiments with vascular endothelial cells indicate that KLF2 exhibits sustained induction under laminar shear stress (10Dekker R.J. van Soest S. Fontijn R.D. Salamanca S. de Groot P.G. VanBavel E. Pannekoek H. Horrevoets A.J. Blood. 2002; 100: 1689-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). This is especially important in light of the fact that shear stress is protective against the development of certain vascular diseases, particularly atherosclerosis (11Ku D.N. Giddens D.P. Zarins C.K. Glagov S. Arteriosclerosis. 1985; 5: 293-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Traub O. Berk B.C. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

KLF2 expression is found throughout the aorta, except at areas of decreased shear stress (branches and bifurcations) (14Dekker R.J. van Thienen J.V. Rohlena J. de Jager S.C. Elderkamp Y.W. Seppen J. de Vries C.J. Biessen E.A. van Berkel T.J. Pannekoek H. Horrevoets A.J. Am. J.

This conclusion is supported by in vitro studies demonstrating that KLF2 increases endothelial nitric-oxide synthase expression (14Dekker R.J. van Thienen J.V. Rohlena J. de Jager S.C. Elderkamp Y.W.

The cumulative evidence indicates that the regulatory mechanisms of the KLF2 gene represent a potential therapeutic target for the prevention or treatment of atherosclerosis.The regulation of the KLF2 gene is complex. Several transacting factors, chromatin modifications, and three signaling pathways have been implicated to date. These processes are largely focused on a 30-bp region of the proximal promoter located between –138 and –111 nucleotides from the start site of transcription (23Schrick J.J. Hughes M.J. Anderson K.P. Croyle M.L. Lingrel J.B. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 236: 185-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This region, which is evolutionarily conserved between mouse and human promoters, is critical for KLF2 expression in every cell type tested thus far. In endothelial cells, it mediates the induction of KLF2 expression by fluid shear stress through the binding of flow-influenced nuclear factors (24Huddleson J.P. Srinivasan S. Ahmad N. Lingrel J.B. Biol. Chem. 2004; 385: 723-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We have recently demonstrated that p300/CREB-binding protein-associated factor (PCAF) 3The abbreviations used are: PCAF, p300/CREB-binding protein-associated factor; hnRNP-D, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein D; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; hnRNP-U, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U; EOMA, hemangioendothelioma; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cell; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; siRNA, small interfering RNA; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay; HA, hemagglutinin; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; MS, mass spectrometry.3The abbreviations used are: PCAF, p300/CREB-binding protein-associated factor; hnRNP-D, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein D; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; hnRNP-U, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U; EOMA, hemangioendothelioma; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cell; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; siRNA, small interfering RNA; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay; HA, hemagglutinin; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; MS, mass spectrometry. and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein D (hnRNP-D) bind this region specifically upon the application of fluid shear stress to a mouse endothelial cell line (18Huddleson J.P. Ahmad N. Srinivasan S. Lingrel J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23371-23379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The binding of these factors is dependent upon the activity of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway and is correlated with histone H3 and H4 acetylation to facilitate chromatin remodeling. Similarly, tumor necrosis factor-α has been found to repress KLF2 expression in endothelial cells by activating histone deacetylase 4, which blocks binding of the myocyte enhancement factor 2 transcription factor to this region (20Kumar A. Lin Z. SenBanerjee S. Jain M.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 5893-5903Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Myocyte enhancement factor 2 has also been found to bind the –138/–111 promoter region in T cells (25Sohn S.J. Li D. Lee L.K. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 8553-8566Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We have also demonstrated that this same region binds several other factors to induce KLF2 expression in macrophages, including hnRNP-D, hnRNP-U, PCAF, and p300 (26Ahmad N. Lingrel J.B. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 6276-6285Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The full complement of trans-acting factors is not known, however; nor is the complete mechanism of activation fully understood.In the present study, we identify nucleolin as an additional factor that binds to the –138/–111 region of the KLF2 promoter. Nucleolin is a multifunctional phosphoprotein with diverse roles in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Several studies have shown that nucleolin interacts with transcription factor complexes, including LR1 and E47 (27Dear T.N. Hainzl T. Follo M. Nehls M. Wilmore H. Matena K. Boehm T. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 891-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 28Hanakahi L.A. Dempsey L.A. Li M.J. Maizels N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3605-3610Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). It also possesses helicase and chromatin remodeling activities, which could facilitate transcription (29Erard M. Lakhdar-Ghazal F. Amalric F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 191: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 30Tuteja N. Phan T.N. Tuteja R. Ochem A. Falaschi A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 636-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate that nucleolin binds the KLF2 promoter in macrophages and endothelial cells. Additionally, we have found that the PI3K pathway is required for nucleolin binding in endothelial cells and that nucleolin is required for induction of the KLF2 gene by fluid shear stress.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture—The mouse macrophage cell line WR19M.1 and the mouse EOMA cell line were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA). The human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) line was purchased from Cambrex (Walkersville, MD). WR19M.1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 20% horse serum (Invitrogen) in 10% CO2. EOMA cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Mediatech, Herndon, VA) at 5% CO2. HUVECs were cultured in supplemented endothelial growth medium 2 (Cambrex) containing growth factors and 2% fetal bovine serum at 5% CO2.Preparation of Nuclear Extracts—Nuclear extracts were prepared as described (31Dignam J.D. Martin P.L. Shastry B.S. Roeder R.G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 582-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by BCA assay (Bio-Rad), and the extract was stored at –80 °C.DNA Affinity Chromatography and Mass Spectrometry—DNA affinity chromatography and mass spectrometry were performed as described previously (26Ahmad N. Lingrel J.B. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 6276-6285Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) with the exception that complimentary strands of the 62-bp region of the KLF2 promoter (nucleotides –157 to –95) were annealed and cross-linked to Sepharose beads. Following washing and incubation in DNA binding buffer, 10 mg of nuclear extract was incubated with the beads for 30 min on ice. The beads were washed 10 times with 10 ml of ice-cold binding buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted in a buffer consisting of 20 mm acetate buffer (pH 5.0), 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 2.5 m KCl, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The affinity-eluted fraction was analyzed by mass spectrometry without separation on polyacrylamide gels.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSAs) and Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assays (ChIPs)—EMSAs were performed as described previously (26Ahmad N. Lingrel J.B. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 6276-6285Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), except that KCl concentration was reduced to 75 mm. EMSA nucleolin supershifts with EOMA nuclear extract were standardized using antibody provided by France Carrier (Baltimore, MD). 5 μg of nuclear extract was used with the antibody. For EMSAs with HUVEC nuclear extract, 15 μg of extract was used, and supershifts were performed with mouse monoclonal anti-nucleolin antibody (clone 4i51; Abcam). ChIP assays were performed with anti-nucleolin polyclonal antibody (Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO) as follows. DNA/protein interactions in static or shear stress cells were fixed by formaldehyde cross-linking (1%) for 10 min with continuous stirring. The cross-linking reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.125 m glycine. The cells were collected by centrifugation, washed with ice-cold PBS (with protein inhibitor mixture), and placed in 5 ml of Buffer A (100 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 1 μm aprotinin, 1 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm leupeptin) for 10 min on ice. Next, the cells were lysed by glass pestle, the nuclei were collected by centrifugation, and the cross-linked chromatin was sonicated by four 15-s pulses with a 550 Sonic Dismembrator (setting of 3). The cross-linked soluble chromatin was collected by centrifugation and diluted in radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, and protein inhibitor mixture). Chromatin was blocked with 20 μl of salmon sperm DNA, bovine serum albumin, poly(dI-dC), and protein A/G-Sepharose beads for 4 h at 4°C. Immunoprecipitations were done with the specific antibody overnight at 4 °C. The DNA-antibody complexes were pulled-down with protein A/G beads (1 h at 4 °C). The beads were washed three times with 1.5 ml of binding buffer, followed by three washes each with low salt buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% deoxycholate) and high salt buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 250 mm LiCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.7% deoxycholate). Bound chromatin was eluted with 75 μl of elution buffer (50 mm sodium bicarbonate, 0.5% SDS; 15 min with continuous stirring). Cross-linking was reversed by heating at 65 °C for 4 h in the presence of 0.3 m NaCl. The mixture was treated with Proteinase K, and the DNA fragment was purified by Qiagen columns.The purified DNA was amplified by radioactive PCR using the following primer pairs to amplify a 139-bp segment encompassing the KLF2 promoter shear stress response region: forward, GGCTTGAGGAGCGCAGTCCGGGCTCCCGCA; reverse, CCGGGCTAGGAGGCGTCGACGGAAACGCGT.Fluid Shear Stress Experiments—A CELLMAX QUAD® artificial capillary cell culture system (Spectrum Laboratories, Rancho Dominguez, CA) was used as described previously (24Huddleson J.P. Srinivasan S. Ahmad N. Lingrel J.B. Biol. Chem. 2004; 385: 723-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). EOMA cells and HUVECs were exposed to shear stress at 19 dynes/cm2. For flow experiments with HUVECs, the artificial capillaries were coated in 10 μg/ml human fibronectin (Sigma) before introduction of cells. For experiments with the PI3K signal transduction inhibitor LY294002 (Calbiochem), the compound was dissolved in Me2SO4 and added to the flow system at a concentration of 40 μmol/liter, accounting for the total volume of liquid in the flow module. Cells treated with an equal volume of Me2SO4 were used as a negative control (vehicle alone). Immediately following the addition of LY294002, the medium was allowed to circulate over the cells at a shear stress level of <1 dyne/cm2 for 30 min before increasing the level of shear stress to 19 dynes/cm2.Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—For immunoprecipitation of HA-tagged nucleolin, HUVECs were transiently transfected with the expression vector (kindly provided by Leslyn Hanakahi (Baltimore, MD)) using Fugene 6 (Roche Applied Science). All cells were isolated in nonionic cells lysis buffer consisting of 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Cells were also sonicated three times for 5 s each. Immunoprecipitations were performed in cell lysis buffer with 250–500 μg of cell extract incubated for 4 h with rabbit anti-hnRNP-D (AUF1) antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), mouse anti-nucleolin monoclonal antibody (Clone 4E2; Stressgen Bioreagents, Victoria, Canada), rabbit anti-hemagglutinin probe (Y-11; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), or rabbit anti-p85 polyclonal antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Beverly, MA). Lysates were precleared with 50 μl of protein A/G-agarose beads prior to the addition of primary precipitating antibody. Antibody complexes were precipitated by the addition of protein A/G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 3 h to overnight. Precipitated complexes were washed for 5 min in high stringency buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% deoxycholate, 0.5% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 120 mm NaCl, 25 mm KCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol), followed by a 10-min wash in high salt wash buffer (high stringency buffer plus 1 m NaCl), followed by a 10-min wash in low salt wash buffer (2 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5 mm dithiothreitol). 40 μl of 1× Laemmli sample buffer was added to the pellet, followed by vortexing and heating to 100 °C for 5 min. Supernatant was collected and run on a 10% polyacrylamide gel for immunoblotting. The immunoblotting procedure has been described previously (18Huddleson J.P. Ahmad N. Srinivasan S. Lingrel J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23371-23379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). An additional mouse monoclonal anti-nucleolin antibody (clone 4i51; Abcam, Cambridge, UK) was used when indicated. GAPDH was used as a loading control by stripping and reprobing blots with mouse anti-GAPDH antibody (Advance ImmunoChemical, Long Beach, CA.).Small Interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated Gene Knockdown—A pool of four human siRNA duplexes targeting human nucleolin was purchased from Dharmacon, Inc. (Lafayette, CO). HUVECs at ∼70% confluence were transiently transfected with 100 nm siRNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Functional nontargeting siRNA-negative control and lamin A/C siRNA-positive control were also purchased from Dharmacon. Cells were exposed to fluid flow (12 h at 19 dynes/cm2) 24 h after transfection. The percentage reduction in nucleolin protein levels (compared with functional nontargeting siRNA-transfected controls) was determined by densitometric analyses of immunoblots (normalized to GAPDH levels) using ImageQuant 5.0. Anti-lamin A/C antibody for probing immunoblots for siRNA-positive control was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA).Reverse Transcription-PCR—2 μg of total RNA was used for reverse transcription with random hexamer primers utilizing Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The primer sequences for human KLF2 have been reported previously (10Dekker R.J. van Soest S. Fontijn R.D. Salamanca S. de Groot P.G. VanBavel E. Pannekoek H. Horrevoets A.J. Blood. 2002; 100: 1689-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). The primer sequences used for human nucleolin were as follows: sense, 5′-CCACTTGTCCGCTTCACAC-3′; antisense, 5′-ACCAGGAGTTGCTACCAATG-3′. GAPDH served as an internal control: sense, 5′-CACCCATGGCAAATTCCATG-3′; antisense, 5′-GCTTCACCACCTTCTTGATG-3′.RESULTSNucleolin Binds to the KLF2 Promoter—Our laboratory has previously characterized the cis-acting element and binding proteins of the KLF2 gene. To further define the mechanism by which the KLF2 gene is regulated, we used a DNA affinity chromatography procedure similar to that used previously (26Ahmad N. Lingrel J.B. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 6276-6285Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), except that a slightly larger region of the KLF2 promoter was cross-linked to the beads (62 bp between –157 and –95 nucleotides from the start site of transcription). This was done because our previous work had shown that, although trans-acting factors bind in the 30-nucleotide core element between –138 and –111 bp, a slightly larger region encompassing adjacent nucleotides is necessary for stabilization of the activating complex and full activation of the promoter (18Huddleson J.P. Ahmad N. Srinivasan S. Lingrel J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23371-23379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 24Huddleson J.P. Srinivasan S. Ahmad N. Lingrel J.B. Biol. Chem. 2004; 385: 723-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Nuclear extract from the mouse WR19M.1 macrophage cell line was incubated with the cross-linked beads, followed by extensive washing. The WR19M.1 cell line was used in these initial experiments, because it has a high level of KLF2 expression and is an excellent source for the purification of factors that bind the KLF2 promoter (26Ahmad N. Lingrel J.B. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 6276-6285Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). A high salt/detergent elution buffer was required to elute the bound protein factors.Washing fractions from the column were retained and used along with negative (no nuclear extract; lane 1) and positive (input nuclear extract; lane 2) controls in EMSAs to verify the retention of nucleotide binding in the eluted fraction (Fig. 1). No binding was present in the washes or in the fraction eluted with high salt buffer (2.5 m KCl; lanes 3–8). 0.5% Nonidet P-40 was added to the buffer to effectively elute the proteins from the column, which retained binding activity (lane 9). The fact that detergent was required suggested that the proteins bind the KLF2 promoter with high affinity. Furthermore, two separate DNA-binding complexes were eluted from the column (Bound 1 and Bound 2).Eluted fractions were subsequently pooled, dialyzed, and concentrated. The concentrated samples were subjected to mass spectrometry by liquid secondary ionization-MS-MS at the University of Cincinnati Mass Spectrometry core facility (available on the World Wide Web at www.chembus.uc.edu/massnew/maintbl.asp).Several proteins were detected based on these criteria, one of which was chosen for analysis in this study. The rest of the identified proteins are under investigation. One list of observed mass fingerprints (Table 1) fitted to the predicted mass fingerprint of nucleolin. To confirm that nucleolin is present in the KLF2 promoter trans-activating complex, EMSAs were performed with WR19M.1 nuclear extract, –138/–108 radiolabled probe, and anti-nucleolin polyclonal antibody (Fig. 2A). As noted in Fig. 1, the EMSA revealed two separate DNA-binding complexes (lane 2). Competition with unlabeled –138/–108 probe depleted binding of both complexes, demonstrating specific DNA-binding proteins within this region (lane 3). The addition of the anti-nucleolin antibody immunodepleted the binding complexes seen in the positive control, suggesting that the presence of nucleolin in both complexes is essential for the complex to bind (lane 4). Immunodepletion was also noted previously when EMSAs were conducted with anti-hnRNP-D antibody (18Huddleson J.P. Ahmad N. Srinivasan S. Lingrel J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23371-23379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 26Ahmad N. Lingrel J.B. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 6276-6285Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Rabbit IgG did not effect complex formation (lane 5). The binding of nucleolin in WR19M.1 macrophages was verified by ChIP assay using anti-nucleolin polyclonal antibody and primers to amplify across the –138/–108 KLF2 promoter region by polymerase chain reaction (data not shown).TABLE 1Mass spectrometry analysis of nucleolinPeptideObserved massPredicted massPosition in nucleolinDaDaKMAPPPK783.34783.4316-22KGAATSAK1279.811279.70125-132KEDSDEDEDEED4059.314059.47142-175FGYVDFESAEDL2473.252473.23351-372VFGNEIK805.43805.43373-379NLSFNITEDELK2641.152641.26401-422EVFEDAMEIRLV1965.051964.95413-429TGKTSTWSGESK1267.781267.60476-487EALNSCNKMEIE1592.921592.73539-552MEIEGR732.99733.34547-552TIRLELQGSNSR1372.831372.74553-564LELQGSNSRSQP1529.861529.78556-569ARIVTDR829.46829.48595-601IVTDRETGSSK1191.781191.61597-607GEGGFGGR735.46735.33647-653 Open table in a new tab FIGURE 2Nucleolin interacts with the tripartite palindrome motif of the KLF2 promoter in macrophages and endothelial cells.

https://openalex.org/W2013782126,"The major impediment to cure for many malignancies is the development of therapy resistance with resultant tumor progression. Genetic alterations leading to subversion of inherent apoptosis pathways are common themes in therapy resistance. Bcl-2 family proteins play a critical role in regulating mitochondrial apoptosis that governs chemotherapeutic effects, and defective engagement of these pathways contributes to treatment failure. We have studied the efficacy of BH3 peptidomimetics consisting of the minimal death, or BH3, domains of the proapoptotic BH3-only proteins Bid and Bad to induce apoptosis using neuroblastoma (NB) as a model system. We demonstrate that BH3 peptides, modified with an arginine homopolymer for membrane transduction (called r8-BidBH3 and r8-BadBH3, respectively), potently induce apoptosis in NB cells, including those with MYCN amplification. Cell death is caspase 9 dependent, consistent with a requirement for the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway. Substitutions at highly conserved residues within the r8-BidBH3 peptide abolish apoptotic efficacy supporting activity through specific BH domain interactions. Concomitant exposure to r8-BadBH3 and r8-BidBH3 at sublethal monotherapy doses revealed potent synergy consistent with a competitive displacement model, whereby BH3 peptides displace sequestered BH3 proteins to induce cell death. Further, BH3 peptides demonstrate antitumor efficacy in a xenograft model of NB in the absence of additional genotoxic or trophic stressors. These data provide proof of principle that targeted re-engagement of apoptosis pathways may be of therapeutic utility, and BH3-like compounds are attractive lead agents to re-establish therapy-induced apoptosis in refractory malignancies."
https://openalex.org/W2042166726,"The yeast prion Ure2p assembles in vitro into oligomers and fibrils retaining the α-helix content and binding properties of the soluble protein. Here we show that the different forms of Ure2p native-like assemblies (dimers, oligomers, and fibrils) are similarly toxic to murine H-END cells when added to the culture medium. Interestingly, the amyloid fibrils obtained by heat treatment of the toxic native-like fibrils appear harmless. Moreover, the Ure2p C-terminal domain, lacking the N-terminal segment necessary for aggregation but containing the glutathione binding site, is not cytotoxic. This finding strongly supports the idea that Ure2p toxicity depends on the structural properties of the flexible N-terminal prion domain and can therefore be considered as an inherent feature of the protein, unrelated to its aggregation state but rather associated with a basic toxic fold shared by all of the Ure2p native-like assemblies. Indeed, the latter are able to interact with the cell surface, leading to alteration of calcium homeostasis, membrane permeabilization, and oxidative stress, whereas the heat-treated amyloid fibrils do not. Our results support the idea of a general mechanism of toxicity of any protein/peptide aggregate endowed with structural features, making it able to interact with cell membranes and to destabilize them. This evidence extends the widely accepted view that the toxicity by protein aggregates is restricted to amyloid prefibrillar aggregates and provides new insights into the mechanism by which native-like oligomers compromise cell viability.

This evidence extends the widely accepted view that the toxicity by protein aggregates is restricted to amyloid prefibrillar aggregates and provides new insights into the mechanism by which native-like oligomers compromise cell viability. It is widely accepted that transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, a group of neurodegenerative diseases in mammals, are due to misfolding of the infectious prion protein (PrP) 3The abbreviations used are: PrP, prion protein; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; ROS, reactive oxygen species; CM-H2 DCFDA, 5-(and 6)-chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate, acetyl ester.; when altered, the protein is able to promote the conformational conversion of the normal cellular form PrPC into the misfolded form PrPSc (1Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5151) Google Scholar). Prion proteins are also present in yeast cells. Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains at least four prion-like proteins, including Ure2p, which is found aggregated intracellularly under certain conditions. However, unlike mammalian prions, which display cytotoxicity in their aggregated form, Ure2p appears substantially noncytotoxic when aggregated into yeast cells (2Wickner R.B. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 109-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), providing the molecular explanation for the change of phenotype given by the nonchromosomal genetic element [URE3] (3Masison D.C. Wickner R.B. Science. 1995; 270: 93-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 4Edskes H.K. Gray V.T. Wickner R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1498-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Such a change of phenotype could provide an evolutionary advantage to yeast cells by regulating nitrogen catabolism (5Magasanik B. Jones E.W. Pringle J.R. Broach J.R. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Vol. 12. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1992: 283-317Google Scholar). When sources rich in nitrogen, such as ammonia, are available, Ure2p is believed to down-regulate the expression of gene products involved in the use of nitrogen-poor sources by binding the transcription activator Gln3p and preventing its migration into the nucleus (6Blinder D. Coschigano P.W. Magasanik B. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4734-4736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In wild-type cells, Ure2p is dispersed in the cytoplasm, whereas the [URE3] phenotype is caused by the appearance of an altered, self-propagating form of Ure2p (Ure2p[URE3]) able to form in the cytoplasm large globular or elongated aggregates (4Edskes H.K. Gray V.T. Wickner R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1498-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). This variant of Ure2p is inactive, resulting in the apparent loss-of-function phenotype. Ure2p is a cytoplasmic homodimer, each monomer consisting of two domains: a highly flexible and poorly structured N-terminal domain (residues 1–93) rich in Gln and Asn (7Thual C. Bousset L. Komar A.A. Walter S. Buchner J. Cullin C. Melki R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1764-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 8Bousset L. Redeker V. Decottignies P. Dubois S. Le Marechal P. Melki R. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 5022-5032Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and a compactly folded C-terminal domain (residues 94–354) rich in α-helices (9Thual C. Komar A.A. Bousset L. Fernandez-Bellot E. Cullin C. Melki R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13666-13674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) whose crystal structure has been determined (10Bousset L. Belrhali H. Janin J. Melki R. Morera S.

A. 2001; 98: 1459-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain is the functional region, consisting of two subdomains and bearing similarity in sequence, fold, and substrate affinity to the glutathione S-transferase family proteins (12Board P.G. Coggan M. Chelvanayagam G. Easteal S. Jermiin L.S. Schulte G.K. Danley D.E. Hoth L.R. Griffor M.C. Kamath A.V. Rosner M.H. Chrunyk B.A. Perregaux D.E. Gabel C.A. Geoghegan K.F. Pandit J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24798-24806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). Indeed, the C-terminal domain binds GSH with high affinity in a cleft running along the domain interface similarly to the active site of glutathione S-transferases (13Bousset L. Belrhali H. Melki R. Morera S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13564-13573Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The structural organization of the highly flexible, largely unstructured Ure2p N-terminal domain displays overall similarity to the corresponding domains found in mammalian prions (14Wickner R.B. Taylor K.L. Edskes H.K. Maddelein M.L. Moriyama H. Roberts B.T. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 130: 310-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Since it has been shown that synthetic peptides encompassing the sequences of different regions of the N-terminal domain of PrP are able to aggregate into amyloid fibrils, it has been suggested that this region governs PrP fibrillization (15Mihara H. Takahashi Y. Ueno A. Biopolymers. 1998; 47: 83-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Similarly, the N-terminal domain of Ure2p is of fundamental importance for aggregation; actually, overexpression of either Ure2p or its 65 N-terminal residues in yeast cells is sufficient to increase the spontaneous rate of [URE3] appearance by 1000-fold (4Edskes H.K.

Under physiological conditions, Ure2p assembles in vitro into oligomers, eventually giving rise to fibrils similar to those observed in yeast cells carrying the [URE3] phenotype (7Thual C. Bousset L.

Cheng N. Williams R.W. Steven A.C. Wickner R.B. Science. 1999; 283: 1339-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). However, these fibrils lack the classical x-ray diffraction pattern characteristic of amyloids, and their constituent monomers maintain the native structure rich in α-helices, can bind GSH (16Bousset L.

Chem. 2004; 279: 50025-50030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Accordingly, these fibrils have been indicated as native-like. The presence of native-like monomers in these fibrils has led us to propose a model in which Ure2p assembly is driven by subtle conformational changes and nonnative inter- and/or intramolecular interactions (16Bousset L. Thomson N.H. Radford S.E. Melki R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2903-2911Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 18Bousset L. Briki F. Doucet J. Melki R. J. Struct. Biol. 2003; 141: 132-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Upon incubation at 60 °C for 1 h, the native-like fibrillar aggregates undergo structural modifications and evolve into fibrils similar in appearance to the native-like fibrils when observed by electron microscopy; however, they lose the ability of the native-like fibrils and the soluble protein to bind GSH and to nucleate assembly. Moreover, they display a significant increase in β-sheet content, and their x-ray diffraction pattern is characteristic of amyloid fibrils (18Bousset L. Briki F. Doucet J. Melki R. J. Struct. Biol. 2003; 141: 132-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). An alternative model has been proposed for Ure2p assembly under conditions slightly different from those leading to the appearance of native-like fibrils. Under these conditions, the first 80 residues of the prion domain of each monomer stack to form an amyloid core rich in β structure. The latter is connected by the remaining portion of the N-terminal domain to the C-terminal domain that maintains substantially its native fold and surrounds the amyloid core (20Baxa U. Taylor K.L.

Steven A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7885-7890Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In this case, inactivation of Ure2p upon fibril formation would be the consequence of a steric block of the native-like C-terminal domain (22Baxa U. Ross P.D. Wicknerand R.B. Steven A.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 339: 259-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Despite the wealth of studies on the morphological, physiological, and structural features of Ure2p and its aggregates, presently there is a substantial lack of information on the toxic effects of the latter on cultured cells. The availability of different conformational states (fibrillar, amyloid, fibrillar, native-like, oligomeric, native-like) of Ure2p prompted us to use such a protein as a model to investigate some molecular features of the toxicity of protein assemblies to cultured cells. Of course, our data cannot be directly extended to yeast cells, although they could be of importance for the cell biology of yeast prions. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate whether different types of Ure2p aggregates display cytotoxicity to mammalian cultured cells and to elucidate the biochemical features of cell injury (if any). Such an investigation was carried out using murine endothelioma H-END cells, previously shown to be highly affected by the exposure to prefibrillar amyloid aggregates of a disease-unrelated protein (23Bucciantini M. Rigacci S. Berti A. Pieri L. Cecchi C. Nosi D. Formigli L. Chiti F. Stefani M. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 437-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 24Cecchi C. Baglioni S. Fiorillo C. Pensalfini A.

The use of H-END cells allowed us to compare the cytotoxic effects of native-like Ure2p aggregates with those described on the same cell type exposed to prefibrillar and fibrillar amyloid aggregates (23Bucciantini M. Rigacci S. Berti A. Pieri L. Cecchi C. Nosi D. Formigli L. Chiti F. Stefani M. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 437-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 24Cecchi C. Baglioni S. Fiorillo C. Pensalfini A.

Assembly of Ure2p into Oligomers and Fibrils—Full-length Ure2p (Ure2p 1–354) and its C-terminal region (Ure2p 94–354) were expressed in Escherichia coli, purified as previously described (7Thual C. Bousset L. Komar A.A. Walter S. Buchner J. Cullin C. Melki R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1764-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 9Thual C. Komar A.A. Bousset L. Fernandez-Bellot E.

Chem. 1999; 274: 13666-13674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), and stored at –80 °C in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm KCl, 1.0 mm dithiothreitol, 1.0 mm EGTA). Full-length Ure2p assembly into fibrils was achieved by incubating the protein (50–100 μm) at 8 °C without shaking in buffer A for 48–96 h. Ure2p aggregates were examined by transmission electron microscopy, following negative staining with 1.0% uranyl acetate on carbon-coated grids (200-mesh) in a Philips EM 410 electron microscope. Ure2p oligomers were obtained soon after thawing the protein stored at –80 °C, whereas the heat-treated amyloid-like fibrils arose upon incubation of the native-like fibrils at 65 °C for 1 h. The covalent Ure2pC221 dimer was obtained by incubating the Ure2pC221 variant (50–100 μm) in buffer A without dithiothreitol in the presence of 3.0 mm H2O2. The excess of H2O2 was removed by dialysis against buffer A. Cell Culture and Cell Viability Assay—Murine endothelioma H-END cells were kindly provided by Prof. F. Bussolino (University of Turin, Italy) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 3.0 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. All materials used for cell culture were from Sigma. The toxicity of the different forms of Ure2p aggregates was assessed by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) reduction inhibition test (25Abe K. Kimura H. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 2074-2078Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), as previously reported for aggregates of a different protein (26Bucciantini M. Giannoni E. Chiti F. Baroni F. Formigli L. Zurdo J. Taddei N. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. Stefani M. Nature. 2002; 416: 507-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (2154) Google Scholar). In all of the experiments described in this paper, controls were performed by supplementing the cell cultures with identical volumes of buffer A for the same lengths of time. Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) Measurement—Intracellular ROS levels were determined using the fluorescent probe 5-(and-6)-chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate, acetyl ester (CM-H2 DCFDA) from Molecular Probes. Subconfluent H-END cells cultured on glass coverslips were incubated with 10.0 μm soluble Ure2p oligomers or native-like fibrils for either 1 or 5 h (aggregate concentrations are calculated as monomer protein concentration). After treatment, the cells were loaded with 5.0 μm CM-H2 DCFDA for 20 min at 37 °C and then fixed with 2.0% buffered paraformaldehyde. CM-H2 DCFDA fluorescence was detected at 488 nm using a confocal Bio-Rad MCR 1024 ES scanning microscope equipped with a krypton/argon laser source (15 milliwatts). The emitted fluorescence was collected with a Nikon Plan Apo ×60 oil immersion objective through a 510-nm-long wave pass filter. A series of at least 10 optical sections (512 × 512 pixels) was taken through the depth of the cells at 0.5-μm intervals and then projected as a single composite image by superimposition. Fluorescence quantification was performed by using National Institutes of Health ImageJ software (available on the World Wide Web at rsb.nih.gov/ij/). Intracellular Free Ca2+ Levels—The cytosolic levels of free Ca2+ were measured using the fluorescent probe Fluo-3-acetoxymethyl ester from Molecular Probes. Briefly, subconfluent H-END cells cultured on glass coverslips were incubated at 37 °C for 5 min with 5.0 μm Fluo-3-acetoxymethyl ester prior to Ure2p addition. Then the cells were washed with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without phenol red to remove the excess probe and mounted on the stage of the confocal microscope. Soluble Ure2p oligomers or native-like Ure2p fibrils (10.0 μm final concentration in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without phenol red) were added to the cells, and Fluo-3 fluorescence was monitored at 488 nm 5 min after Ure2p addition (this time was supposed to be necessary for Ure2p aggregates to sediment and to interact with cells) using the software Time Course Kinetic (Bio-Rad). The same field was imaged every 20 s for 30 min. Fluorescence quantification was performed by ImageJ software. Confocal Immunofluorescence—Cells grown on glass coverslips were treated for 4 h with the different forms of Ure2p aggregates (2.0 μm). After incubation, the cells were fixed in 2.0% buffered paraformaldehyde and counterstained with 50 μg/ml wheat germ agglutinin tetramethylrhodamine-conjugated (Molecular Probes) for 45 min at room temperature. Then the cells were permeabilized by treatment with acetone at –20 °C for 1 min and blocked with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 0.2% glycerol. The cells were incubated overnight with rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against full-length Ure2p diluted 1:2000 in the blocking solution. The immunoreaction was revealed with Alexa-488-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes) diluted 1:200 in phosphate-buffered saline. For inspection, the coverslips were mounted on the stage of the confocal microscope. The fluorescence was analyzed at 488- and 568-nm excitation for Alexa-488 and wheat germ agglutinin tetramethylrhodamine-conjugated, respectively. Observations were performed using a Nikon Plan Apo ×60 oil immersion objective. A series of at least 10 optical sections (512 × 512 pixels) was taken through the cells at intervals of 0.5 μm and projected as single composite image by superimposition. To eliminate out-of-focus light contribution, the images of Fig. 5 were deconvoluted using the three-dimensional deconvolution plugin (Biomedical Imaging Group, EPFL, Lausanne) of the Image J software. DNA Fragmentation—Quantification of apoptosis was performed by the colorimetric TiterTACS™ 96-well apoptosis detection kit (R&D Systems Inc.). H-END cells were plated on 96-well plates at a density of 3000 cells/well in 100 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. After 48 h, the culture medium was exchanged with fresh medium containing full-length soluble Ure2p oligomers, native-like fibrils, or soluble Ure2p 94–354 (10.0 μm final concentrations). After 24 h, the cells were fixed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 3.7% formaldehyde and 10% sucrose. Labeling of DNA strand breaks was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions and quantified by measuring sample extinction at 450 nm using an automatic plate reader (Bio-Rad). Caspase 3 Activity Assay—Cells treated for 24 h with full-length soluble Ure2p oligomers, native-like fibrils, or soluble Ure2p 94–354 (10.0 μm final concentrations) were lysed in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 250 mm NaCl, 2.0 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5.0 μg/ml aprotinin, 5.0 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 4.0 mm sodium vanadate, and 1.0 mm dithiothreitol. The total protein content was determined in the clarified lysates with the Bradford reagent. Caspase 3 activity was determined by incubating 50 μg of total proteins for 2 h at 37°C in the presence of 50 μm N-acetyl-DEVD-7-amino-4-trifluoromethyl coumarin fluorogenic substrate (Biomol Research Laboratories Inc.) in 50 mm HEPES-KOH buffer, pH 7.0, 10% glycerol, 0.1% 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)-dimethylammonium]-1-propane sulfonate, 2.0 mm EDTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol. The fluorescent aminofluorocoumarin formation was determined at 400-nm excitation and 505-nm emission. In order to determine nonspecific substrate degradation in the assay, total protein samples were preincubated for 15 min at 37 °C in the presence or in the absence of the specific caspase inhibitor (100 nm N-acetyl-DEVD-aldehyde) prior to substrate addition. As a positive control, cells were treated with 2.0 μm staurosporine for 5 h prior to lysis. Lactate Dehydrogenase Release Assay—Lactate dehydrogenase release was measured in the culture medium of cells exposed for 24 or 48 h to Ure2p aggregates by the Promega CytoTox-ONE™ homogeneous membrane integrity assay according to the manufacturer's instructions. Viability of Cells Exposed to Differing Ure2p Aggregates—Different forms of Ure2p aggregates were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Soluble Ure2p oligomers and native-like fibrils were characterized by transmission electron microscopy following negative staining at differing times of fibrillization and prior to the addition to the cell medium. Fig. 1A shows a transmission electron microscopy image of the soluble Ure2p oligomers formed at early aggregation times (0–1 h); these oligomers are represented by structured spherical particles with an outer diameter of 18 nm on average. Fig. 1B reports a magnification of one of these particles showing a ring-shaped appearance. Indeed, the particles appear to be made of globular units organized around a central hole with a diameter of about 3.0 nm. The insoluble form of Ure2p obtained by incubating the protein for 48–96 h at 8 °C in buffer A (see under “Experimental Procedures”) consists of 20-nm-wide fibrils displaying variable lengths (0.5–10 μm) (Fig. 1C). We investigated the toxicity to H-END cells of these different aggregates, together with that of the heat-treated amyloid fibrils (18Bousset L. Briki F. Doucet J. Melki R. J. Struct. Biol. 2003; 141: 132-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and of the Ure2p covalent dimer that oligomerizes but is unable to form fibrils (16Bousset L. Thomson N.H. Radford S.E. Melki R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2903-2911Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In addition, the Ure2p 94–354 fragment (functional domain) able to bind GSH was used throughout this study to distinguish its contribution to the putative toxicity from that of the flexible N-domain. The cytotoxicity of Ure2p aggregates was evaluated by the MTT assay. A toxic effect was made evident by exposing the cells for 24 h to increasing concentrations (0.1, 1.0, and 10.0 μm) of soluble Ure2p oligomers or native-like fibrils or of the Ure2pC221 covalent dimer (Fig. 1D). Instead, heat-treated amyloid-like fibrils did not exhibit evident cytotoxicity even at the highest concentration tested (10.0 μm) (Fig. 1D), in agreement with the large body of data indicating that mature amyloid fibrils are substantially noncytotoxic (reviewed in Ref. 27Stefani M. Dobson C.M. J. Mol. Med. 2003; 81: 678-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (1344) Google Scholar). The toxic effect of 10.0 μm Ure2p oligomers and native-like fibrils was detectable as early as 3 h following the addition of the aggregates to the culture medium (Fig. 2A). We did not investigate earlier times. Native-like Ure2p fibrils displayed the highest toxicity, since the latter was detected at the lowest concentration used (0.1 μm), where oligomeric Ure2p or Ure2pC221 covalent dimer apparently were not toxic. We also measured cell viability upon the addition of soluble Ure2p oligomers or native-like fibrils in the 0.01–0.1 μm concentration range, and we found that 0.03 μm native-like fibrils were still significantly toxic (20% inhibition of MTT reduction), whereas under these conditions, the soluble oligomers did not display a measurable toxicity (Fig. 2B). Native-like Ure2p oligomers and fibrils are toxic but still able to bind GSH, whereas the heat-treated fibrils are unable to bind GSH and are nontoxic. This prompted us to hypothesize that the oxidative stress (see below) resulting in cell injury by the toxic aggregates was merely a consequence of GSH depletion in exposed cells due to GSH binding by the aggregates rather than a direct effect of the aggregates themselves. To rule out this possibility, we investigated the toxicity of the functional C-terminal (residues 94–354) domain of Ure2p. The latter binds GSH and its analogues with an affinity identical to that of full-length Ure2p but is unable to form fibrils, since it lacks the prion domain needed for fibril assembly as well as for the propagation of the [URE3] phenotype in yeast cells. The data presented in Fig. 1D show that cells exposed to Ure2p 94–354 were only slightly impaired with respect to controls (25% inhibition of MTT reduction) at the highest concentration used (10.0 μm), and no significant toxicity was detected at lower concentrations. To confirm that Ure2p toxicity is not due to GSH binding and depletion, the GSH binding sites in the full-length Ure2p and in the Ure2p 94–354 were saturated with GSH upon incubation with equimolar amounts of the latter prior to the addition to the cell cultures. Under these conditions, no significant changes in the toxicity levels were observed (data not shown); we conclude from these observations that the strong toxicity associated with full-length Ure2p aggregates is not due to their GSH-binding properties. Overall, from these observations we conclude that Ure2p toxicity is intimately associated with a toxic fold present in the native fibrils as well as in the oligomers but not in the amyloid-like fibrils generated heating the native-like fibrils. We further conclude that the observed toxicity is not due to changes in the intracellular redox environment of the exposed cells induced by direct binding and sequestering of GSH by native-like Ure2p molecules. Redox Status and Intracellular Ca2+ Levels in Cells Exposed to Ure2p Aggregates—We have investigated the mechanism of cell damage in cells exposed to the toxic Ure2p aggregates by measuring the ROS and the intracellular free Ca2+ levels using the fluorescent probes CM-H2 DCFDA and Fluo-3-acetoxymethyl ester, respectively. Intracellular ROS levels arose as early as 1 h after supplementing the cell culture medium with the soluble oligomers and native-like fibrils of Ure2p, reaching a 2-fold increase within 5 h (Fig. 3); such an increase was concomitant with the reduced cell viability observed by the MTT assay (Fig. 2A). The extents of ROS increase in cells exposed for 5 h to Ure2p oligomers or native-like fibrils were comparable. However, ROS increase was significantly faster when cells were exposed to soluble Ure2p oligomers (Fig. 3C). This could arise from a more rapid interaction of the Ure2p oligomers with the cell membrane, possibly due to their higher diffusion rate in the culture medium or to their ability to penetrate into the cells (see below). A kinetic and quantitative analysis of the free Ca2+ levels in cells exposed to the Ure2p oligomers or native-like fibrils is shown in Fig. 4. The maximum fluorescence intensity (6-fold increase) was reached 9 min after supplementing the cell culture medium with soluble Ure2p oligomers. Fluorescence intensity decreased later but remained significantly higher than in control cells (Fig. 4, A and B). A similar, although less pronounced, increase in intr"
https://openalex.org/W1975792870,"We show here that the GTPase RhoG is involved in caveolar trafficking. Wild-type RhoG moves sequentially to the plasma membrane, intracellular vesicles, and the Golgi apparatus along markers of this endocytic pathway. Such translocation is associated with changes in RhoG GDP/GTP levels and is highly dependent on lipid raft integrity and on the function of the GTPase dynamin2. In addition, the constitutively active RhoGQ61L mutant is preferentially located in endocytic vesicles that can be decorated with markers of the caveola-derived endocytic pathway. RhoGQ61L, but not the analogous Rac1 mutant protein, affects caveola internalization and the subsequent delivery of endocytic vesicles to the Golgi apparatus. The expression of RhoG/Rac1 chimeric proteins and RhoGQ61L effector mutants in cells induces alterations in the internalization of caveolae and severe changes in vesicle structure, respectively. However, the knockdown of endogenous rhoG transcripts using small interfering RNAs does not affect significantly the trafficking of caveola-derived vesicles, suggesting that RhoG function is dispensable for this endocytic process or, alternatively, that its function is compensated by other molecules. Taken together, these observations assign a novel function to RhoG and suggest that caveolar trafficking, as previously shown for other endocytic routes, is modulated by GTPases of the Ras superfamily."

Both human patients and PiZ transgenic mice have similar symptoms of hepatic failure culminating in cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The involvement of molecular chaperones, as well as the relevance of oxidative stress in this disease is not characterized well yet. Here, we show that, in the PiZ transgenic mice, the 58-kDa protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), the most important oxidoreductase and chaperone of the endoplasmic reticulum, is in a complex with PiZ, which is accompanied by a decrease of protein disulfide reductase activity of the ER. PiZ transgenic mice have a shift toward a more reduced ER environment and an elevation of cytoplasmic chaperones and antioxidant enzymes. Our data suggest that lower availability of PDI and a decreased protein disulfide reductase activity of the ER along with a cytoplasmic stress may contribute to the toxic effects of PiZ aggregation."
https://openalex.org/W2105815011,"Natural killer dendritic cells (NKDC) are a unique class of murine immune cells that possess the characteristics of both natural killer (NK) cells and dendritic cells (DC). Because NKDC are able to secrete IFN-gamma, directly lyse tumor cells, and present antigen to naïve T cells, they have immunotherapeutic potential. The relative paucity of NKDC, however, impedes their detailed study. We have found that in vivo, overexpression of the hematopoietic cytokine Flt3 ligand (Flt3L) expands NKDC in various organs from 2-18 fold. Flt3L expanded splenic NKDC retain the ability to lyse tumor cells and become considerably more potent at activating naïve allogeneic and antigen-specific T cells. Compared to normal splenic NKDC, Flt3L-expanded splenic NKDC have a more mature phenotype, a slightly increased ability to capture and process antigen, and a similar cytokine profile. In vivo, we found that Flt3L-expanded splenic NKDC are more effective than normal splenic NKDC in stimulating antigen-specific CD8 T cells. Additionally, we show that NKDC are able to cross-present antigen in vivo. The ability to expand NKDC in vivo using Flt3L will facilitate further analysis of their unique biology. Moreover, Flt3L-expanded NKDC may have enhanced immunotherapeutic potential, given their increased ability to stimulate T cells."
https://openalex.org/W1969336596,"The AP1 (activator protein 1) transcription factor, c-Jun, is an important regulator of cell proliferation, differentiation, survival, and death. Its activity is regulated both at the level of transcription and post-translationally through phosphorylation, sumoylation, and targeted degradation. The degradation of c-Jun by the ubiquitin proteasome pathway has been well established. Here, we report that POH1, a subunit of the 19 S proteasome lid with a recently described deubiquitinase activity, is a regulator of c-Jun. Ectopic expression of POH1 in HEK293 cells decreased the level of c-Jun ubiquitination, leading to significant accumulation of the protein and a corresponding increase in AP1-mediated gene expression. The stabilization also correlated with a redistribution of c-Jun in the nucleus. These effects were reduced by mutation of a cysteine residue in the Mpr1 pad1 N-terminal plus motif of POH1 (Cys-120) and appeared to be selective for c-Jun, because POH1 had no effect on other proteasomal substrates. Our results identify a novel mechanism of c-Jun regulation in mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W2035293502,"Daxx, a human cell death-associated protein, was isolated as a Tcf4-interacting protein, using a yeast two-hybrid screen. Co-immunoprecipitation in HEK-293T cells and yeast two-hybrid screen in Y190 cells were performed to identify the interaction between Tcf4 with Daxx and to map the binding regions of Tcf4. In the nucleus, Daxx reduced DNA binding activity of Tcf4 and repressed Tcf4 transcriptional activity. Overexpression of Daxx altered the expression of genes downstream of Tcf4, including cyclin D1 and Hath-1, and induced G1 phase arrest in colon cancer cells. A reduction in Daxx protein expression was also observed in colon adenocarcinoma tissue when compared with normal colon tissue. This evidence suggests a possible physiological function of Daxx, via interaction with Tcf4, to regulate proliferation and differentiation of colon cells."
https://openalex.org/W2088419701,"In an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent process, the hSWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex functions to alter chromatin structure, thereby regulating transcription factor access to DNA. In addition to interactions with transcription factors and recognition of acetylated histone residues, the chromatin remodeling activity of hSWI/SNF has also been shown to respond to a variety of cell signaling pathways. Our results demonstrate a novel interaction between the serine/threonine kinase Akt and members of the hSWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex. Activation of Akt in HeLa cells resulted in its association with hSWI/SNF subunits: INI1, BAF155 and BAF170, as well as actin. BAF155 became preferentially recognized by an antibody that detects phosphorylated Akt substrates upon activation of Akt, suggesting that BAF155 may be an in vivo target for phosphorylation by Akt. Glutathione-S-transferase (GST) pulldown experiments demonstrated that INI1 and BAF155 were both capable of directly interacting with Akt. Finally, in vitro kinase assays provided additional evidence that BAF155 and potentially INI1 are substrates for Akt phosphorylation. These data provide the first evidence that Akt signaling may modulate function of the hSWI/SNF complex."
https://openalex.org/W2091181826,"The Saccharomyces cerevisiae vacuolar proton-translocating ATPase (V-ATPase) is composed of 14 subunits distributed between a peripheral V1 subcomplex and an integral membrane V0 subcomplex. Genome-wide screens have led to the identification of the newest yeast V-ATPase subunit, Vma9p. Vma9p (subunit e) is a small hydrophobic protein that is conserved from fungi to animals. We demonstrate that disruption of yeast VMA9 results in the failure of V1 and V0 V-ATPase subunits to assemble onto the vacuole and in decreased levels of the subunit a isoforms Vph1p and Stv1p. We also show that Vma9p is an integral membrane protein, synthesized and inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which then localizes to the limiting membrane of the vacuole. All V0 subunits and V-ATPase assembly factors are required for Vma9p to efficiently exit the ER. In the ER, Vma9p and the V0 subunits interact with the V-ATPase assembly factor Vma21p. Interestingly, the association of Vma9p with the V0-Vma21p assembly complex is disrupted with the loss of any single V0 subunit. Similarly, Vma9p is required for V0 subunits Vph1p and Vma6p to associate with the V0-Vma21p complex. In contrast, the proteolipids associate with Vma21p even in the absence of Vma9p. These results demonstrate that Vma9p is an integral membrane subunit of the yeast V-ATPase V0 subcomplex and suggest a model for the arrangement of polypeptides within the V0 subcomplex. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae vacuolar proton-translocating ATPase (V-ATPase) is composed of 14 subunits distributed between a peripheral V1 subcomplex and an integral membrane V0 subcomplex. Genome-wide screens have led to the identification of the newest yeast V-ATPase subunit, Vma9p. Vma9p (subunit e) is a small hydrophobic protein that is conserved from fungi to animals. We demonstrate that disruption of yeast VMA9 results in the failure of V1 and V0 V-ATPase subunits to assemble onto the vacuole and in decreased levels of the subunit a isoforms Vph1p and Stv1p. We also show that Vma9p is an integral membrane protein, synthesized and inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which then localizes to the limiting membrane of the vacuole. All V0 subunits and V-ATPase assembly factors are required for Vma9p to efficiently exit the ER. In the ER, Vma9p and the V0 subunits interact with the V-ATPase assembly factor Vma21p. Interestingly, the association of Vma9p with the V0-Vma21p assembly complex is disrupted with the loss of any single V0 subunit. Similarly, Vma9p is required for V0 subunits Vph1p and Vma6p to associate with the V0-Vma21p complex. In contrast, the proteolipids associate with Vma21p even in the absence of Vma9p. These results demonstrate that Vma9p is an integral membrane subunit of the yeast V-ATPase V0 subcomplex and suggest a model for the arrangement of polypeptides within the V0 subcomplex.

The V-ATPase is found on the intracellular organelles of all eukaryotes and also on the plasma membrane of specialized cell types. Hydrolysis of ATP by the V-ATPase drives the transport of protons into the lumen of organelles that this macromolecular complex decorates. Similar to the F-type ATPases, V-ATPase coupling of ATP hydrolysis and proton transport involves a rotary mechanism (4Hirata T. Iwamoto-Kihara A. Sun-Wada G.H. Okajima T. Wada Y. Futai M. J. Biol.

Yeast that lacks any VMA gene display characteristic Vma– phenotypes as follows: nonacidified vacuoles and the failure to grow on media buffered to pH 7.5 or containing elevated CaCl2. The V-ATPase can be divided into two subcomplexes designated V1 and V0. The V1 subcomplex is composed of eight hydrophilic subunits ranging in size from 13 to 69 kDa and contains the ATP binding and hydrolysis domains. The V0 subcomplex is hydrophobic, composed of six subunits ranging in size from 10 to 100 kDa, and is responsible for proton translocation. The V0 subcomplex can be subdivided into two parts that move relative to each other, the stator and the proton-translocating ring. The V0 portion of the stator is composed of the 100-kDa subunit a (Vph1p or Stv1p). The proton-translocating ring is composed of subunits Vma3p, Vma11p, and Vma16p (subunits c, c′, and c″ respectively; see Ref. 14Hirata R. Graham L.A. Takatsuki A. Stevens T.H. Anraku Y. J. Biol.

Vma3p, Vma11p, and Vma16p have multiple transmembrane domains and are termed proteolipids because of their very hydrophobic nature (15Flannery A.R. Graham L.A. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39856-39862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The 5th V0 subunit Vma6p, subunit d, is a hydrophilic peripheral membrane protein. Cross-linking studies with the Thermus thermophilus V-ATPase suggest that Vma6p interacts with the V0 subcomplex through the proteolipids (16Iwata M. Imamura H. Stambouli E. Ikeda C. Tamakoshi M.

A. 2004; 101: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar).In yeast there are three ER-localized proteins that function as V-ATPase assembly factors, which are required for the function of the V-ATPase but are not components of the final assembled complex (17Graham L.A. Powell B. Stevens T.H. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 61-70Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The V-ATPase assembly factors Vma12p, Vma21p, and Vma22p are found in the ER where they function to assemble the V0 subcomplex (18Graham L.A. Stevens T.H. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1999; 31: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Vma12p is a transmembrane protein that anchors the peripheral membrane protein Vma22p in the ER (19Graham L.A. Hill K.J. Stevens T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This Vma12p-Vma22p complex has been shown to interact with the V0 subunit a early in V0 biosynthesis. Vma21p is an integral membrane protein that has been found to associate with the V0 subcomplex in the ER and may escort it to the Golgi body (20Malkus P. Graham L.A. Stevens T.H. Schekman R. Mol.

Two different genome-wide yeast mutant screens identified the subunit e encoding gene VMA9 (previously CWH36), which when disrupted resulted in the full spectrum of Vma– phenotypes (23Davis-Kaplan S.R.

Subunit e is conserved from yeast to humans, and Caenorhabditis elegans fus-1 (subunit e) mutants show cellular hyperfusion (8Kontani K. Moskowitz I.P. Rothman J.H. Dev. Cell. 2005; 8: 787-794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Yeast Vma9p has been found to co-purify with the V-ATPase and is required for V-ATPase function (24Sambade M. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17361-17365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar).We also identified the VMA9 gene in a yeast genome-wide screen for proteins involved in V-ATPase function (3Graham L.A. Flannery A.R. Stevens T.H. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2003; 35: 301-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). We report here that cells lacking Vma9p do not assemble a V0 subcomplex, and that the subunit a isoform Vph1p is rapidly degraded. Biochemical and localization studies reveal that Vma9p is an integral membrane vacuolar protein that fails to be transported out of the ER in cells lacking any V0 subunit or V-ATPase assembly factor. Vma9p associates with the V0-Vma21p assembly complex in the ER, and Vma9p is required for the association of two other V0 subunits with the V0-Vma21p complex. These data indicate that Vma9p is a critical component of the V0 subcomplex, and based on the results we propose a model for the position of Vma9p relative to the proteolipid ring.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmid Construction—Enzymes utilized for DNA manipulations were purchased from New England Biolabs, Fermentas, and Stratagene; standard protocols for molecular biology with modifications were followed (26Sambrook J.

Plasmid pLG42 was created by HindIII/SacI digestion of VMA21::HA from pKH28 and ligation into pRS315 digested with the same restriction enzymes. To generate pMAC200, genomic DNA was prepared from the yeast genome deletion collection diploid strain cwh36Δ::kanr (renamed vma9Δ::kanr; Open Biosystems) as described previously (27Winzeler E.A.

The 500-bp flanking vma9Δ::kanr PCR product was ligated into the pCR4 Blunt-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) generating pMAC200. The same method utilized to create pMAC200 was also used to generate pLG128 (vma3Δ::kanr), pLG129 (vma11Δ::kanr), and pLG130 (vma16Δ::kanr) from the appropriate yeast genome deletion collection diploid strains.TABLE 1Plasmids utilized in this studyPlasmidDescriptionSource/Ref.pDJ74pRS306 integrating plasmid for STV1::3xHA (loop in/loop out)39Kawasaki-Nishi S.

To generate MACY10, PCR was performed with plasmid pMAC200 and inward-facing oligonucleotides that bind 500 bp 5′ of the VMA9 start codon and 500 bp 3′ of the stop codon. The resulting vma9Δ::kanr PCR product was transformed into SF838-1Dα yeast with a high efficiency lithium acetate protocol (29Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transformants were suspended in YEPD (yeast extract/peptone/dextrose), pH 5.0 (50 mm succinate/phosphate), and selected on YEPD plates containing 200 μg/ml geneticin sulfate (G418). Colonies from G418 selection plates were screened on YEPD + 100 mm CaCl2 plates to confirm a Vma– phenotype (lack of growth). Western blot analysis confirmed the lack of Vma9p in strain MACY10 (vma9Δ::kanr). The same method (see MACY10 above) was utilized with strain LGY70 and pMAC200 to generate MACY13, strain SF838-1Dα, and pLG128 to generate LGY113, strain SF838-1Dα and pLG129 to generate LGY114, and strain SF838-1Dα and pLG130 to generate LGY115. TASY006 was also constructed by a similar means with starting strain SF838-1Dα, but the initial vma21Δ::kanr PCR template was genomic DNA of the yeast genome deletion collection vma21Δ::kanrdiploid strain. The loop in/loop out method with EcoRI-digested pDJ74 was utilized to integrate STV1::3xHA generating strains LGY127, LGY128, LGY129, LGY135, and MACY11 starting with strains KHY31, LGY113, TASY006, MACY10, and CYY1, respectively. The VMA11::MYC integrated strain LGY70 was created by loop in/loop out with MscI-digested pLG40 transformed into SF838-1Dα yeast. The VMA3::MYC integrated strain DJY64 was created by transformation of SF838-1Dα yeast with XhoI/SacI-digested pRHA316.

https://openalex.org/W2132505160,"N-terminal methionine removal is an important cellular process required for proper biological activity, subcellular localization, and eventual degradation of many proteins. The enzymes that catalyze this reaction are called Methionine Aminopeptidases (MAPs). To date, only two MAP family members, MAP1A and MAP2, have been well characterized and studied in mammals. In our studies, we have cloned a full length MAP1D gene. Expression and purification of full length recombinant protein shows that the sequence encodes an enzyme with MAP activity. MAP1D is overexpressed in colon cancer cell lines and in colon tumors as compared to matched normal tissue samples. Downregulation of MAP1D expression by shRNA in HCT-116 colon carcinoma cells reduces anchorage-independant growth in soft agar. These data suggest that MAP1D is a potentially oncogenic, novel member of the MAP gene family that may play an important role in colon tumorigenesis."

In the case of diol dehydratase, X is a hydroxyl group on C2 of 1,2-propanediol.

The (αγ)2 complex and the β subunit correspond to components S and F, respectively, and the association of these components forming the (αβγ)2 complex is absolutely necessary for coenzyme binding and, thus, for catalytic activity (21Tobimatsu T.

The active site is located in the C-terminal side of a (β/α)8 barrel (so-called TIM barrel) of the α subunit above the corrin ring of cobalamin (17Shibata N. Masuda J. Tobimatsu T. Toraya T. Suto K. Morimoto Y. Yasuoka N. Structure. 1999; 7: 997-1008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The two hydroxyl groups of 1,2-propanediol are directly coordinated to the K+ ion that is located in the inner part of the active-site cavity and hydrogen-bonded to respective two-amino acid residues (Fig. 1C). This structure suggests that the K+ ion and/or the active-site residues might be involved in the transition state stabilization for the hydroxyl group migration from C2 to C1 (24Toraya T. Yoshizawa K. Eda M. Yamabe T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 126: 650-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Theoretical calculations suggested that the K+ ion is important for substrate binding but stabilizes the transition state rather slightly (25Toraya T. Eda M. Kamachi T. Yoshizawa K. J. Biochem. 2001; 130: 865-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 26Eda M. Kamachi T. Yoshizawa K. Toraya T. Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn. 2002; 75: 1469-1481Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The long distance between the cobalt atom and C1 (8.37 Å) and C2 (9.03 Å) of the substrate eliminated the possibility that Co(II) of cob(II)alamin is directly involved in the hydroxyl group migration through organocobalamin intermediates, such as “substratylcobalamin” and “productylcobalamin” (27Silverman R.B. Dolphin D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1976; 98: 4626-4633Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Model reactions also supported the direct rearrangement of the substrate radical to the product radical (12Golding B.T. Radom L. J. Am. Chem.

Soc. 2001; 123: 1664-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) proposed from the accurate theoretical calculation with a simple model of diol dehydratase that the barrier height for the hydroxyl group migration is lowered by a synergistic retro-push-pull catalysis assisted by partial protonation and partial deprotonation through the active-site imidazolium and carboxylate ions, respectively. In contrast, Kamachi et al. (30Kamachi T. Toraya T. Yoshizawa K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 16207-16216Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) recently predicted from the quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical calculation with a whole-enzyme model that Glu-α170 and unprotonated His-α143, rather than the protonated His-α143, are important for the diol dehydratase catalysis in that order (30Kamachi T. Toraya T. Yoshizawa K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 16207-16216Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, no experimental evidence for the catalytic functions of the active-site residues of diol dehydratase is available yet, although it is essential for our understanding of the action mechanism of this type of enzymes. In this paper catalytic amino acid residues were surveyed to help the understanding of the roles of the active-site residues as well as the pathway of the hydroxyl group migration in the diol dehydratase reaction. Seven mutant enzymes in which one of the active-site residues interacting with substrates and/or K+ was mutated to alanine were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified, and their enzymatic functions were examined. The result of so-called “alanine scan” is reported here. In addition, four mutants in which Glu-α170 or Asp-α335 was mutated to Asp, Gln, His, or Asn were also prepared to investigate their catalytic roles in further detail because Glu-α170 and Asp-α335 are hydrogen-bonded to the C1 and C2 hydroxyl groups of substrate, respectively. Glu-α170 is coordinated to K+ as well at the active site (17Shibata N. Masuda J. Tobimatsu T. Toraya T. Suto K. Morimoto Y. Yasuoka N.

It was confirmed by nucleotide sequencing that all the mutants do not have unintended mutations. Construction of Expression Plasmids—To avoid undesired mutations, some of mutant plasmids were constructed by substituting the appropriate region of pUC119(DD) with restriction fragments of the corresponding mutated DNAs.

A 0.22-kb DraIII-BsmI fragment from pUC(αD-Qα296A) and a 1.8-kb BsmI fragment from pUC119(DD) were ligated to the 4.1-kb DraIII-BsmI fragment of pUC119(DD) to obtain pUC119(DD-Qα296A). A 0.18-kb BsmI-AflIII fragment from pUC(αD-Dα335A) or pUC(αD-Sα362A) and a 1.6-kb AflIII-BsmI fragment from pUC119(DD) were inserted to the BsmI site of pUC119(DD) to obtain pUC119(DD-Dα335A) or pUC119(DD-Sα362A), respectively. A 3.1-kb BamHI-EcoRI fragment from each pUC(DD) mutant plasmid was finally ligated to the corresponding region of vector pUSI2ENd (32Tobimatsu T. Kawata M. Toraya T. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2005; 69: 455-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) to obtain an expression plasmid for a mutant enzyme. For the construction of pUSI2ENd(DD-Eα221A), a 0.08-kb SphI-DraIII fragment from pUC(αD-Eα221A) was ligated to the SphI-DraIII region of pUC119(DD). A 2.3-kb SphI-EcoRI fragment from the resulting plasmid and a 0.66-kb BamHI-SphI fragment from pUC119(DD) were ligated to the BamHI-EcoRI region of pUSI2ENd. Expression and Purification of Mutant Diol Dehydratases—All the mutants were expressed as described before (21Tobimatsu T. Sakai T. Hashida Y. Mizoguchi N. Miyoshi S. Toraya T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 347: 132-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The Qα141A, Hα143A, Qα296A, Eα170A, and Sα362A mutant enzymes were purified essentially as described previously for the recombinant wild-type enzyme (21Tobimatsu T. Sakai T. Hashida Y. Mizoguchi N. Miyoshi S. Toraya T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 347: 132-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The Eα170Q and Eα170H mutants were purified similarly but with the following modifications; the amount of buffer used for sonication and washing was decreased to 2 or 3 volumes of precipitate, and the precipitate was washed only twice with 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) containing 2% 1,2-propanediol and 0.2% Brij35, because the solubility of these mutants is higher than the wild-type enzyme. Furthermore, the DEAE-cellulose column chromatography was omitted, since the mutants extracted from crude membrane fractions with the same buffer but containing 1% Brij35 were found to be almost homogeneous. In some preparations of Eα170A mutant enzyme, (αβγ)2 and (αγ)2 complexes corresponding to the apoenzyme and component S, respectively (21Tobimatsu T. Sakai T. Hashida Y. Mizoguchi N. Miyoshi S. Toraya T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 347: 132-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), coexisted. The Eα170D, Eα221A, Dα335A, and Dα335N mutants were purified simply by washing the precipitate with 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) containing 2% 1,2-propanediol but without Brij35. Enzyme and Protein Assays—Diol dehydratase activity was determined by the 3-methyl-2-benzothiazolinone hydrazone method (33Toraya T. Ushio K. Fukui S. Hogenkamp H.P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 963-970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The standard reaction mixture contained an appropriate amount of apoenzyme, 15 μm AdoCbl, 0.1 m 1,2-propanediol, 50 mm KCl, and 35 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) in a total volume of 1.0 ml. After incubation at 37 °C for 10 min, reactions were terminated by adding 1 ml of 0.1 m potassium citrate buffer (pH 3.6). 3-Methyl-2-benzothiazolinone hydrazone HCl was then added to a final concentration of 0.9 mm, and the mixtures were incubated again at 37 °C for 15 min. The concentrations of aldehyde formed were determined by measuring the absorbance at 305 nm. One unit is defined as the amount of enzyme activity that catalyzes the formation of 1 μmol of propionaldehyde/min at 37 °C under the standard assay conditions. Time courses of diol dehydratase reaction were measured by the alcohol dehydrogenase-NADH-coupled method (34Toraya T. Krodel E. Mildvan A.S. Abeles R.H. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 417-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Protein concentration of purified enzyme was determined by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm. The molar absorption coefficient at 280 nm, calculated by the method of Gill and von Hippel (35Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5072) Google Scholar) from the deduced amino acid composition and subunit structure for this enzyme, is 120,500 m–1cm–1 (36Toraya T. Mori K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3372-3377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Kinetic Analysis of Mutant Diol Dehydratases—K+-free wild-type and mutant enzymes were obtained by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-25 (fine) column that had been previously equilibrated and eluted with 50 mm Tris·HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 0.1 m 1,2-propanediol and 1% Brij35. The wild-type enzyme, thus prepared, did not show any observable activity without added monovalent cation, such as K+, and was, therefore, assumed to be K+-free, although metal analysis was not made. Apparent Km values for K+ were determined by assaying the enzyme activity at fixed concentrations of 1,2-propanediol (100 mm) and AdoCbl (15 μm) with varying concentrations of KCl. Substrate-free apoenzyme used for the measurement of Km values for 1,2-propanediol was obtained by dialysis at 4 °C for 24–36 h against 100 volumes of 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) containing 1% Brij35 or 20 mm sucrose monocaprate with two buffer changes. The remaining concentrations of 1,2-propanediol in dialysates were less than 0.2 mm when determined by adding wild-type diol dehydratase and, thus, negligible when diluted more than 100-fold. Apparent Km values for 1,2-propanediol and AdoCbl were determined by Lineweaver-Burk plots at a fixed AdoCbl concentration of 15 μm and at a fixed 1,2-propanediol concentration of 100 mm. Other Analytical Procedures—PAGE analysis of mutant diol dehydratases was performed under non-denaturing conditions as described by Davis (37Davis B.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1964; 121: 404-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (15961) Google Scholar) in the presence of 0.1 m 1,2-propandiol or under denaturing conditions as described by Laemmli (38Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207523) Google Scholar). Protein staining was carried out with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Optical spectra were obtained on a Jasco V-560 recording spectrophotometer. Experimental details are described in the legends to Figs. 3 and 4. For the measurements under anaerobic conditions, the air in a system was replaced by argon (purity, 99.999%); that is, a AdoCbl solution and a reaction mixture without AdoCbl were degassed separately in a Thunberg tube-like quartz cell by repeating evacuation/argon-introduction 3 times, then mixed, and incubated.FIGURE 4Spectral changes upon anaerobic incubation of mutant holodiol dehydratases with substrate. Experimental conditions are identical with Fig. 3, except that incubation and spectral measurements were carried out under an argon atmosphere.

Spectra were taken at 3 min (thick solid lines) and 30 min (thin solid lines) of incubation with AdoCbl and after denaturation (broken lines) and photoillumination (dotted lines) and corrected for dilution.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) For EPR measurements, mutant apoenzymes purified by DEAE-cellulose column chromatography (21Tobimatsu T. Sakai T. Hashida Y. Mizoguchi N. Miyoshi S. Toraya T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 347: 132-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) were used. Substrate-free apoenzyme solution (∼1–2 mg of protein in 0.6 ml of 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) containing 20 mm sucrose monocaprate) was mixed at 0 °C with AdoCbl solution (50 nmol in 0.05 ml) in a quartz EPR tube (5 mm in diameter) stoppered with a rubber septum. After replacement of the air in the tube with nitrogen by repeating evacuation/nitrogen-introduction three times, holoenzymes were formed, and EPR spectra were taken as described in the legend to Fig. 5. The sample prepared was transferred to the EPR cavity and cooled with a cold N2 gas flow controlled by a JEOL JES-VT3A temperature controller. EPR spectra were measured as described previously (39Toraya T. Yamanishi M. Muguruma H. Ushio K. Yamauchi J. Kawamura T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1337: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 40Finlay T.H. Valinsky J. Mildvan A.S. Abeles R.H. J. Biol.

EPR microwave frequency, 9.170–9.179 GHz; modulation amplitude, 1 millitesla; modulation frequency, 100 kHz; microwave power, 10 milliwatt. Expression and Purification of Mutant Diol Dehydratases—Mutant enzymes in which one of the active-site residues was mutated to alanine or Glu-α170 or Asp-α335 was mutated to other residues were expressed in E. coli cells. As judged from SDS-PAGE analyses of the homogenates of E. coli cells harboring expression plasmids, all the mutants were highly expressed as the wild-type enzyme (to ∼10–20% of total cellular protein), and the levels of expression of the α, β, and γ subunits were not significantly affected by mutations (data not shown). The Qα141A, Hα143A, Eα170A, Qα296A, and Sα362A mutants were purified by the same procedure as that for the wild-type enzyme (21Tobimatsu T. Sakai T. Hashida Y. Mizoguchi N. Miyoshi S. Toraya T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 347: 132-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar); that is, by extraction from the crude membrane fractions with a buffer containing 1% Brij35. The purity of these mutants was more than 70–80% as judged by densitometric determination (Fig. 2, A and B). In contrast, the recovery of the Eα170A mutant was relatively low, presumably because its solubility is a little bit higher than that of the wild-type enzyme. A ratio of (αβγ)2 to (αγ)2 in a typical preparation of Eα170A was estimated to be ∼30–70% by PAGE analysis under non-denaturing conditions (Fig. 2, A and B). The Eα170Q and Eα170H mutants were purified by the same procedure except that the volume of washing buffer of the crude membrane fraction was decreased to 2 or 3 volumes of precipitate because of the higher solubility of these mutants. The Eα170D, Eα221A, Dα335A, and Dα335N mutants were purified simply by washing the precipitate with 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) containing 2% 1,2-propanediol but without the detergent. Among them, Dα335N existed mainly as the (αβγ)2 complex. Eα170Q existed as a mixture of (αβγ)2 and (αγ)2, whereas Eα170H, E221A, and Dα335A did not exist as the (αβγ)2 complexes, although the α, β, and γ subunits were present in their preparations. With Eα170D, the ratio of (αβγ)2 to (αγ)2 was high just after preparation, but it was significantly lowered after freezing and thawing. These results indicated that subunit contacts are disrupted completely by the Eα170H, Eα221A, and Dα335A mutations and partially by the Eα170D, Eα170A, and Eα170Q mutations. The effects of these mutations seem to be indirect, because Glu-α170, Glu-α221, and Asp-α335 do not exist in the subunit interface (17Shibata N. Masuda J. Tobimatsu T. Toraya T. Suto K. Morimoto Y. Yasuoka N. Structure. 1999; 7: 997-1008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Catalytic Activity of Mutant Diol Dehydratases—Activity of purified mutant enzymes was measured by the 3-methyl-2-benzothiazolinone hydrazone method (10-min assay) using 1,2-propanediol as the substrate. The Qα141A, Qα296A, and Sα362A mutants were partially active enzymes. Although the Ser-α362 residue coordinates to K+ by the main-chain amide oxygen (17Shibata N. Masuda J. Tobimatsu T. Toraya T. Suto K. Morimoto Y. Yasuoka N. Structure. 1999; 7: 997-1008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), its mutation to alanine decreased specific activity to approximately one-third. Specific activity of the Hα143A mutant was <0.04% that of the wild-type enzyme, and the Eα170A and Dα335N mutants were totally inactive (<0.01%), although they exist at least partly as (αβγ)2 complexes. These results indicated that Glu-α170, Asp-α335, and His-α143 are catalytic residues of diol dehydratase. The Eα170Q mutant was essentially inactive (specific activity, 0.02%). Eα170D showed 2.2 ± 0.3% of the activity of the wild-type enzyme, whereas Eα170H was totally inactive. Thus, it was suggested that the presence of COO– in the residues α170 and α335 and its distance from the substrate are essential for catalysis. No activity was detected with purified preparations of Eα221A and Dα335A mutants. These results are consistent with the fact that the (αβγ)2 complex was not formed with these mutants. Kinetic Properties of the Mutant Diol Dehydratases—Km values for 1,2-propanediol, K+, and AdoCbl were determined with the wild-type and catalytically active mutant enzymes (Table 1). The Qα296A mutation increased Km for substrate by a factor of 250. The Qα141A and Sα362A mutations also lowered the affinity for the substrate but to much lesser degr"
https://openalex.org/W2076695383,"The transacetylase (TA), reported to be identical to platelet-activating factor (PAF) acetylhydrolase (II), is a multifunctional enzyme with three catalytic activities: lysophospholipid transacetylase (TA(L)), sphingosine transacetylase (TA(S)), and acetylhydrolase (AH). We report that TA(L) activity participates in the control of PAF levels in monocytes and macrophages and that its regulation differs in these two types of cells. In monocytes, LPS or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) specifically increased the TA(L) activity. Western blot analysis and enzyme assays on immunoprecipitates revealed that the increased activity can be ascribed to PAF-AH (II) and that both translocation from cytosol to membranes and p38/ERKs-mediated phosphorylation regulate the enzyme activation. Instead, in macrophages differentiated in vitro from monocytes by incubation with FCS, an increase of both TA(L) and AH activities was observed. Moreover, activation of ERKs and p38 MAP kinase was not required for the up-regulation of PAF-AH (II) in differentiated macrophages. The differences observed in macrophages as compared to monocytes can be explained by 1) p38/ERKs-independent phosphorylation of PAF-AH (II) and 2) appearance of plasma PAF-AH in the course of macrophage differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2106484360,"Maxadilan, a 61-amino-acid vasodilatory peptide, was initially isolated from the salivary glands of the sand fly Lutzomyia longipalpis. Although its primary sequence has no homology to that of pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide, maxadilan is an agonist for the PAC1 receptor. A total of 58 substitution and deletion mutants was engineered in an effort to determine which residues were important for receptor activation. The mutants were characterized functionally using an assay based on pigment granule translocation in PAC1-expressing Xenopus laevis melanophores. Substitution of charged residues and proline 43 could alter (but not eliminate) the agonist activity of the mutants. In contrast, we found that several multiple substitution mutants of the predicted β-strand threonine residues became antagonists at the PAC1 receptor. The results suggest that these threonine residues are cooperatively involved in PAC1 activation.

Maxadilan is a potent vasodilatory peptide present in the salivary glands of the sand fly, the vector of leishmaniasis (1Lerner E.A. Ribeiro J.M. Nelson R.J. Lerner M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11234-11236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is likely that the peptide is responsible for an increase in local blood flow and thereby facilitates blood feeding by the arthropod. Furthermore, maxadilan has emerged as a possible link in the pathogenesis of leishmaniasis. It has immunomodulatory properties that may be responsible, at least in part, for the initial establishment of this parasitic infection (2Qureshi A.A. Asahina A. Ohnuma M. Tajima M. Granstein R.D. Lerner E.A. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1996; 54: 665-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Co-injection of maxadilan and leishmania promastigotes aggravated the infection in a mouse model, whereas vaccination against maxadilan had a protective effect (3Morris R.V. Shoemaker C.B. David J.R. Lanzaro G.C. Titus R.G. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 5226-5230Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The possibility of using this peptide in an anti-Leishmania vaccine is under evaluation (4Milleron R.S. Mutebi J.P. Valle S. Montoya A. Yin H. Soong L. Lanzaro G.C. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 2004; 70: 286-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Maxadilan specifically activates PAC1, the type I receptor for pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide (PACAP). 2The abbreviation used is: PACAP, pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide. Maxadilan does not activate the other two receptors for PACAP, VPAC1, and VPAC2 (5Moro O. Lerner E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 966-970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). PAC1 is a seven-transmembrane-domain G protein-coupled receptor first cloned from a pancreatic acinar carcinoma cell line (6Pisegna J.R. Wank S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6345-6349Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). It is expressed in the nervous system and in a wide variety of peripheral tissues (7Vaudry D. Gonzalez B.J. Basille M. Yon L. Fournier A. Vaudry H. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 269-324PubMed Google Scholar). Surprisingly, maxadilan and PACAP do not share significant sequence homology (Fig. 1) yet activate the same receptor. This finding led us to examine the structural basis of the maxadilan-PAC1 interaction. The structure of maxadilan, as predicted by the Chou and Fasman method (8Moro O. Wakita K. Ohnuma M. Denda S. Lerner E.A. Tajima M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23103-23110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), includes two α-helical motifs connected via a β-strand. In addition, there are cysteine residues at positions 1, 5, 14, and 51 that form disulfide bonds between 1–5 and 14–51. The ring from 1–5 is not needed for agonist activity, but alterations of the cysteines at 14 or 51 eliminate activity. This larger ring is presumably needed for the structural integrity of the peptide and possibly the interaction with the PAC1 receptor. Of note, deletion of the amino acids 25–41 of the β-strand generates a specific PAC1 receptor antagonist, M65, suggesting that this region is important for functional activation of the receptor. The importance of particular residues in receptor activation might be ascertained by substitution mutations in the absence of crystal or NMR structures for maxadilan. Some of this mutational analysis has been provided naturally, as sequence alterations in 21 of the 61 amino acid residues of maxadilan have been reported among field populations as well as among sibling species of sand flies. Maxadilan variants differed by as much as 23% in amino acid composition. All of these natural variants shared the same degree of vasodilatory activity and had similar predicted secondary structures and hydrophobicity plots. It has been suggested that this polymorphism is a form of antigenic variation to escape host immune responses (9Lanzaro G.C. Lopes A.H. Ribeiro J.M. Shoemaker C.B. Warburg A. Soares M. Titus R.G. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 8: 267-275Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). A subsequent study confirmed antigenic specificity to the C-terminal end of variant maxadilan peptides (4Milleron R.S. Mutebi J.P. Valle S. Montoya A. Yin H. Soong L. Lanzaro G.C. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 2004; 70: 286-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Because charged residues are often important to function, single or multiple point substitutions to the alanine of selected charged residues throughout the maxadilan molecule were generated. In addition to the polar residues, proline 43 was mutated to alanine, because proline residues can form turns in the polypeptide chain, with potential functional implications. Furthermore, as described above, the 25–41-amino-acid segment, deleted in M65, may be important in the functional activation of PAC1. This region contains six threonine residues, which are potentially involved in the formation of hydrogen bonds with PAC1 residues. To investigate this hypothesis, we engineered substitution mutations of these threonine residues to alanine (Fig. 1). Three deletion mutants were also designed to further evaluate amino acid regions involved in peptide-receptor interactions. To evaluate the interaction of these mutants with the PAC1 receptor, we used a functional assay based on pigment granule translocation in Xenopus laevis melanophores stably expressing PAC1 (10Pereira P. Reddy V.B. Kounga K. Bello Y. Lerner E. Pigm. Cell Res. 2002; 15: 461-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Activation of PAC1 in melanophores leads to an increase in intracellular levels of cAMP with subsequent melanosome dispersion. This phenomenon is readily quantified via changes in phototransmission (10Pereira P. Reddy V.B. Kounga K. Bello Y. Lerner E. Pigm. Cell Res. 2002; 15: 461-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Melanophore Cell Culture—Frog fibroblasts were cultured at room temperature for 3–4 days in 0.7× Lebowitz-15 medium, 20% fetal bovine serum, 1× glutamine, and 1× penicillin-streptomycin. This conditioned medium was used to maintain a stable line of melanophores expressing the rat PAC1 receptor (10Pereira P. Reddy V.B. Kounga K. Bello Y. Lerner E. Pigm. Cell Res. 2002; 15: 461-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Maxadilan Expression Vector—The cDNA (210 bp) of maxadilan (11Lerner E.A. Shoemaker C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1062-1066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was cloned as an NcoI-XhoI fragment into the pTWIN1 vector (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) with its N terminus fused to the chitin binding domain and a mini-intein from the Synechocytis sp. dnaB gene. This construct (pTWIN1max) allowed maxadilan to be expressed with intein as a 32.5-kDa fusion protein (7.5 + 25 kDa), which after binding to a chitin column, was cleaved at pH 7.0, releasing maxadilan as a 7.5-kDa peptide. Mutagenesis—All substitution and deletion mutants were made using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis method (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Complementary oligonucleotide primers 30–45 bases long were synthesized incorporating alanine codons (GC(T/G)C(C/G)C(A/G)CG) in the middle of the target sequence. As an example, the primers for the threonine mutant T33A are: 5′-CT TCT GTA CAA ACA GCT GCA ACA TTC ACA TC-3′ and 5′-GA TGT GAA TGT TGC AGC TGT TTG TAC AGA AG-3′. 200 ng of each of the primers and 40 ng of pTWIN1max as the template were combined in a 50-μl reaction mixture containing Pfu DNA polymerase. The mixture was subjected to the following PCR conditions: 95 °C for 60 s, 18 cycles each of 95 °C for 50 s, 60 °C for 50 s and 68 °C for 8 min, and a final extension at 68 °C for 7 min. The product was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with 1μl of DpnI restriction enzyme to digest methylated template plasmid DNA. 1 μl of the reaction was transformed into competent Escherichia coli ER2566 cells. The resulting colonies were verified by DNA sequencing. The newly generated mutants were used as templates to create multiple substitutions in the same mutant. Purification of Maxadilan—Purification of the maxadilan-intein fusion protein was based on the instructions provided by the manufacturer (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). The bacterial pellet was suspended in column buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 500 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Triton X-100 and lysed in a French press. The suspension was centrifuged at 31,000 × g. The supernatant containing the fusion protein was passed over a chitin column preequilibrated with column buffer. The column was washed with column buffer extensively to remove unbound material and flushed with three column volumes of cleavage buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 500 mm NaCl, and 0.1 mm EDTA. After incubating the column for 48 h, maxadilan was eluted with cleavage buffer and concentrated using Apollo 7 ultrafiltration concentrator devices (Orbital Biosciences, Topsfield, MA). Protein concentrations were measured by non-interfering protein assay (Geno Technology Inc., St. Louis, MO). Assay of Peptide Activity in Melanophores—The maxadilan peptides were assayed for functional activity by measuring pigment dispersion in melanophores stably expressing the rat PAC1 receptor. Briefly, PAC1-expressing melanophores were plated in 96-well plates at a density of ∼40,000 cells/well. Two hours prior to the addition of maxadilan or maxadilan mutants, the medium was changed and melanosomes were aggregated with 2 nm melatonin, which targets the endogenous Gi-linked melatonin receptor. Base-line readings were taken with a plate reader (Tecan, Maennedorf, Switzerland) at 620 nm to obtain the initial transmittance (Ti) values at time 0 before the addition of ligands. For the agonist assay, maxadilan and mutants were diluted from stock solutions and added to the wells in 10-fold dilutions in triplicate. The antagonist assay was performed by adding 10-fold dilutions of the mutants in the presence of 0.08 nm maxadilan. Final transmittance (Tf) readings were taken after 1 h. EC50 and IC50 values were generated as described previously (10Pereira P. Reddy V.B. Kounga K. Bello Y. Lerner E. Pigm. Cell Res. 2002; 15: 461-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The generation and functional investigation of 58 mutants of maxadilan were performed. Thirty-three substitution mutants affected selected charged residues and proline 43. Another nineteen mutants targeted the six threonine residues in the middle β-strand. Six other mutants are also described. All of the maxadilan mutants were produced as recombinant peptides in E. coli under similar conditions. The mutants were investigated for agonist activity by measuring the transmittance changes as a result of pigment granule translocation in a PAC1-expressing melanophore line. This assay has the advantage of allowing for rapid functional evaluation of ligand-G protein-coupled receptor interaction. The inactive mutants were subsequently tested for antagonist activity using the same assay. The mutant peptides affecting the charged residues and P43, compared with the wild-type maxadilan, have up to eight amino acid substitutions. All of these substitution mutants maintained agonist activity at the PAC1 receptor. The potency of the mutants is reported as a ratio between the EC50 of maxadilan and the EC50 of the mutants. The EC50 of maxadilan was ∼5pm in the melanophore assay (Tables 1 and 2).TABLE 1The potency of maxadilan single mutants affecting charged residues and proline 43Maxadilan mutantsEC50 maxadilan/EC50 mutantN45A2.6K49A2P43A2D38A2D12A1D13A1E50A1K53A1K55A1K56A0.8K57A0.8E58A0.8K60A0.8N22A0.5R8A0.1K9A0.1K16A0.1H19A0.1H20A0.1 Open table in a new tab TABLE 2The potency of maxadilan multiple mutants affecting charged residues and proline 43Maxadilan mutantsEC50 maxadilan/EC50 mutantR8A/K9A/D12A/D13A/H19A/H20A/N22A0.5R8A/K9A/D12A/D13A/K16A/H19A/H20A/N22A0.33D38A/N45A0.2R8A/D38A/P43A/N45A0.2K53A/K57A0.16H19A/H20A/N22A0.16D38A/P43A0.13K9A/D38A/P43A/N45A0.11K16A/D38A/P43A/N45A0.11K53A/K55A/K56A0.1K55A/K56A/K57A0.08K53A/K55A/K57A0.07D38A/P43A/N45A0.06K53A/K55A/K56A/K57A0.008 Open table in a new tab Alanine substitution mutants were engineered of threonines 26, 30, 31, 33, 35,and 39, individually and in a variety of combinations, including all six residues. The large number of possible combinations precluded generating all of the potential combinations of mutants. However, the mutants that were generated, although limited in number, allow some conclusions to be drawn regarding the importance of these maxadilan β-strand threonine residues in PAC1 activation. Each of the threonine → alanine mutations impaired the potency of the peptide. T33A was the least potent of the single substitution mutants (Table 3). Furthermore, seven multiple mutants lost their ability to activate PAC1. They were subsequently shown to be maxadilan antagonists with IC50 values ranging from 0.2 to 0.0028 relative to M65 (Table 4). These mutants were thus each less potent antagonists than M65, which in the melanophore assay, has an IC50 of 4 nm. A serine substitution mutant, replacing the threonines at positions 30, 31, 33, and 35 with the structurally similar amino acid serine, was found to have activity (EC50 = 60 pm) similar to wild-type maxadilan.TABLE 3The potencies of the maxadilan threonine → alanine mutants that maintained agonist activity at the PAC1 receptorMaxadilan mutantsEC50 maxadilan/EC50 mutantT39A0.5T35A0.5T26A0.25T31A0.25T30A0.16T33A0.06T35A/T39A0.025T31A/T39A0.016T30A/T39A0.016T33A/T39A0.014T30A/T31A0.008T30A/T35A0.0027 Open table in a new tab TABLE 4The IC50 of the maxadilan threonine → alanine mutants with antagonist activity at the PAC1 receptorAntagonist threonine mutantsIC50 M65/IC50 mutantT33A/T35A0.2T33A/T35A/T39A0.066T30A/T33A0.02T30A/T331A/T33A0.0088T26A/T30A/T31A/T33A/T35A/T39A0.004T31A/T33A0.0033T26A/T30A/T31A/T33A0.0028 Open table in a new tab Deletion mutants Maxdel2 and Maxdel3, retaining the threonine-rich region absent in the antagonist M65, were inactive (Fig. 2). However, the deletion mutant Maxdel4, lacking the C-terminal lysine-rich residues, had a reduced activity with an EC50 value of 40 nm. The polyalanine mutant MaxPolyala1, with 11 alanines filling the space in the deletion mutant Maxdel3, was found to be active with an EC50 value of 0.3 nm. A similar polyalanine construct, MaxPolyala2, with 15 alanine residues replacing the deleted region in Maxdel2, was an antagonist (IC50 = 20 nm). Of the 61 amino acids in maxadilan, natural variants in 21 residues have been reported. None of them affect activity as determined by relaxation of rabbit aortic rings. The four cysteine residues are conserved in all of these variants. Some amino acid variants are conservative, involving, for example, non-charged amino acids, such as serine and threonine at position 36. Other changes are not conservative, as in the case of valine or aspartic acid substitution at position 28. There is an overlap between several of the sites in the natural variants of maxadilan and the alanine substitutions reported here (Fig. 1). However, only two of the variants have naturally occurring alanines at these residues, at positions 50 and 56 (9Lanzaro G.C. Lopes A.H. Ribeiro J.M. Shoemaker C.B. Warburg A. Soares M. Titus R.G. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 8: 267-275Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Because of its small size, it is understood that alanine substitution does not typically cause significant structural changes that would interfere with the activity of the mutated peptides. Resulting functional changes in the mutants would likely be due to altered ligand-receptor interaction. All of the single and multiple alanine substitution mutants generated in this study by targeting the charged residues or proline 43 maintained agonist activity at the PAC1 receptor (Tables 1 and 2). The least active of these mutants was K53A/K55A/K56A/K57A. It is likely that these lysine residues are responsible at least, in part, for the binding to the receptor. However, in contrast to the threonine → alanine mutants, none of the mutants affecting charged residues or proline 43 lost their activation properties, which makes them less likely to be involved in receptor activation. Because deletion of the middle β-strand was previously shown to convert the molecule into an antagonist (8Moro O. Wakita K. Ohnuma M. Denda S. Lerner E.A. Tajima M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23103-23110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), we focused our investigation on this segment. We targeted, by alanine substitution, the six threonines in the 25–41 fragment of maxadilan, hypothesizing that these residues may be involved in hydrogen bonding to PAC1. All single mutants maintained agonist activity (Table 3). Targeting Thr-33 generated the least active single mutant (Fig. 3), which suggests that this residue may be the most important of the six threonines in receptor activation. Several double mutants maintained agonist properties (Table 3). They were less active than the corresponding single mutants, consistent with an additive effect of the mutations. Three double mutants lost their activation properties completely. This observation, combined with the knowledge that deletion of 25–41 resulted in an antagonist, led us to test these mutants for activity as antagonists, which indeed turned out to be the case. Fig. 4 shows the antagonist activity of T31A/T33A in comparison to M65. Interestingly, all multiple mutants affecting more than two threonine residues became antagonists (Table 4). All of the antagonist mutants had Thr-33 substituted with alanine, which indicates once again that threonine at position 33 may be playing a major role in receptor activation. Thus, similar to M65, these antagonist mutants lose receptor activation properties but maintain binding properties at the PAC1 receptor. None of the threonine mutants lost both the activation and the binding properties. These results provide additional evidence that supports the previous deletion studies. It is likely that the middle β-strand of maxadilan is involved in receptor activation. This report identifies for the first time key specific maxadilan β-strand residues responsible for PAC1 activation. The results shown here reveal that all six threonine residues in the 25–41 maxadilan segment, with emphasis on Thr-33, are cooperatively involved in the activation of the PAC1 receptor. The interaction between the PAC1 receptor and the hydroxyl groups in these threonines is further supported by the serine substitution mutant (T30S/T31S/T33S/T35S), which retains activity. The polyalanine mutant agonist MaxPolyala1 with 11 alanines filling the space of the deletion mutant Maxdel3 indicates that maxadilan activity also depends on the structural integrity of the region preceding the threonines. Activity appears to require a certain amount of space to be filled in the region between 15–25. In contrast, MaxPolyala2 was found to be an antagonist, perhaps because the missing Thr-26 and the neighboring residues are critical in this transition. Taken together, we suggest a model for the interaction between maxadilan and the PAC1 receptor. It is possible that the C-terminal lysine residues of maxadilan initiate a non-activating binding interaction with the receptor. This initial interaction induces a conformational change in the receptor. The threonine residues of maxadilan, held in place by the disulfide bond between residues 14 and 51, can now fit into the newly generated pocket in the PAC1 receptor, leading to receptor activation (Fig. 5). Based on the knowledge accumulated so far, maxadilan derivatives have the potential to be used as anti-hypertensives and immunomodulators. However, maxadilan is a peptide, limiting its usefulness as a therapeutic. There are no specific small molecular agonists at the PAC1 receptor. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of PAC1 activation may facilitate the future identification of such compounds. As a complement to these studies, it would be of interest to identify, via mutation analysis of the PAC1 receptor, which residues are involved in the interaction with maxadilan and whether or not those are the same residues that interact with PACAP.

https://openalex.org/W2016465570,"SLP65 represents a critical component in (pre-) B cell receptor signal transduction but is compromised in a subset of pre-B cell-derived acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Based on these findings, we investigated (i.) whether SLP65-deficiency also occurs in mature B cell-derived lymphoma and (ii.) whether SLP65-deficient B cell lymphoma cells use an alternative B cell receptor signaling pathway in the absence of SLP65. Indeed, expression of SLP65 protein was also missing in a fraction of B cell lymphoma cases. While SLP65 is essential for B cell receptor-induced Ca2+ mobilization in normal B cells, B cell receptor engagement in SLP65-deficient as compared to SLP65-reconstituted B cell lymphoma cells resulted in an accelerated yet shortlived Ca2+-signal. B cell receptor engagement of SLP65-deficient lymphoma cells involves SRC kinase activation, which is critical for B cell receptor-dependent Ca2+-mobilisation in the absence but not in the presence of SLP65. As shown by RNA interference, the SRC kinase LYN is required for B cell receptor-induced Ca2+ release in SLP65-deficient B cell lymphoma cells but dispensable after SLP65-reconstitution. B cell receptor engagement in SLP65-deficient B cell lymphoma cells also resulted in tyrosine-phosphorylation of the proliferation- and survival-related MAPK1 and STAT5 molecules, which was sensitive to silencing of the SRC kinase LYN. Inhibition of SRC kinase activity resulted in growth arrest and cell death specifically in SLP65-deficient lymphoma cells. These findings indicate that LYN can short-circuit conventional B cell receptor signaling in SLP65-deficient B cell lymphoma cells and thereby promote activation of survival and proliferation-related molecules."
