https://openalex.org/W1971403296,"An approach for genome analysis based on sequencing and assembly of unselected pieces of DNA from the whole chromosome has been applied to obtain the complete nucleotide sequence (1,830,137 base pairs) of the genome from the bacterium Haemophilus influenzae Rd. This approach eliminates the need for initial mapping efforts and is therefore applicable to the vast array of microbial species for which genome maps are unavailable. The H. influenzae Rd genome sequence (Genome Sequence DataBase accession number L42023) represents the only complete genome sequence from a free-living organism."
https://openalex.org/W2021874649,"Plasmodium falciparum-infected human erythrocytes evade host immunity by expression of a cell-surface variant antigen and receptors for adherence to endothelial cells. These properties have been ascribed to P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1), an antigenically diverse malarial protein of 200-350 kDa on the surface of parasitized erythrocytes (PEs). We describe the cloning of two related PfEMP1 genes from the Malayan Camp (MC) parasite strain. Antibodies generated against recombinant protein fragments of the genes were specific for MC strain PfEMP1 protein. These antibodies reacted only with the surface of MC strain PEs and blocked adherence of these cells to CD36 but without effect on adherence to thrombospondin. Multiple forms of the PfEMP1 gene are apparent in MC parasites. The molecular basis for antigenic variation in malaria and adherence of infected erythrocytes to host cells can now be pursued."
https://openalex.org/W2027679419,"It has long been the paradigm that T cells recognize peptide antigens presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. However, nonpeptide antigens can be presented to T cells by human CD1b molecules, which are not encoded by the MHC. A major class of microbial antigens associated with pathogenicity are lipoglycans. It is shown here that human CD1b presents the defined mycobacterial lipoglycan lipoarabinomannan (LAM) to alpha beta T cell receptor-bearing lymphocytes. Presentation of these lipoglycan antigens required internalization and endosomal acidification. The T cell recognition required mannosides with alpha(1-->2) linkages and a phosphotidylinositol unit. T cells activated by LAM produced interferon gamma and were cytolytic. Thus, an important class of microbial molecules, the lipoglycans, is a part of the universe of foreign antigens recognized by human T cells."

https://openalex.org/W2035938088,"Combinations of antiretroviral drugs that prevent or delay the appearance of drug-resistant human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (HIV-1) mutants are urgently required. Mutants resistant to 3'-azidothymidine (AZT, zidovudine) became phenotypically sensitive in vitro by mutation of residue 184 of viral reverse transcriptase to valine, which also induced resistance to (-)2'-deoxy-3'-thiacytidine (3TC). Furthermore, AZT-3TC coresistance was not observed during extensive in vitro selection with both drugs. In vivo AZT-3TC combination therapy resulted in a markedly greater decreased in serum HIV-1 RNA concentrations than treatment with AZT alone, even though valine-184 mutants rapidly emerged. Most samples assessed from the combination group remained AZT sensitive at 24 weeks of therapy, consistent with in vitro mutation studies."
https://openalex.org/W2043385322,"We studied the role of desensitization at inhibitory synapses by comparing nonequilibrium GABAA channel gating with inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs). Currents activated by brief pulses of 1-10 mM GABA to outside-out patches from cultured hippocampal neurons mimicked GABA-mediated IPSCs. Although the average open time of single GABAA channels following brief pulses was less than 10 ms, channels entered long (tau = 38-69 ms) closed states and subsequently reopened. Movement through these states resulted in paired-pulse desensitization. The time required for deactivation after removal of agonist also increased in proportion to the extent of desensitization. These results suggest that visits to desensitized states buffer the channel in bound conformations and underlie the expression of long-lasting components of the IPSC. Reopening after GABAA receptor desensitization may thus enhance inhibitory synaptic transmission by prolonging the response to a brief synaptic GABA transient."
https://openalex.org/W2024131238,"The specific recognition of anionic phospholipids in the outer leaflets of cell membranes and lipoproteins by cell surface receptors may play an important role in a variety of physiologic and pathophysiologic processes (e.g. recognition of damaged or senescent cells by the reticuloendothelial system or lipoprotein homeostasis). Several investigators have described anionic phospholipid binding to cells, and phosphatidylserine (PS) binding to a partially purified ~95-kDa membrane protein has recently been reported (Sambrano, G. R., and Steinberg, D.(1995) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 92, 1396-1400). Using both direct binding and ligand competition assays in transfected cells, we have found that two class B scavenger receptors, SR-BI and CD36, can tightly bind PS and phosphatidylinositol (PI)-containing liposomes (Kd for PS liposome binding to SR-BI is ~15 μg phospholipid/ml or 0.18 nM (mol PS liposomes/l)), but not phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, or sphingomyelin liposomes. PS and PI liposomes, but not the others, could effectively compete with PS liposomes and modified or native lipoproteins for binding to these receptors. Phosphatidic acid, another anionic phospholipid, could also compete, but was not as effective as PS or PI. Class B scavenger receptors are the first molecularly well-defined, specific cell surface receptors for anionic phospholipids to be described.

Phospholipids are key structural components of cell membranes and lipoproteins. Based on studies of the red blood cell's and other membranes (reviewed in 39Schroit A.J. Zwaal R.F.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1071: 313-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), it is generally assumed that there is an asymmetric distribution of phospholipids in the plasma membranes of eukaryotic cells ( 35Roelofsen B. Op den Kamp J.A.F. Hoekstra D. Current Topics in Membranes. Academic Press, San Diego1994: 7-46Google Scholar).

Breakdown of this asymmetry, especially the exposure of increased levels of PS on the outer cell surface, occurs in a variety of physiologic and pathologic states.

Several studies have suggested that scavenger receptors which bind modified lipoproteins, such as oxidized low density lipoprotein (OxLDL) or acetylated LDL (AcLDL), may in some cases function as anionic phospholipid receptors (29Nishikawa K.

The only receptor for anionic phospholipids to be identified to date is a partially purified ~95-kDa membrane protein from macrophages that was shown to directly bind PS and OxLDL using a ligand blotting assay (9de Rijke Y.B. van Berkel T.J.C.

The primary sequence of this protein has not been reported; thus, it is not known if it is a member of one of the three classes of scavenger receptors, A, B, and C, which have been previously defined based on their distinctive binding activities and primary sequences (3Acton S.L.

Two of these, class A and class C scavenger receptors (SR-A, SR-C), are expressed almost exclusively on mammalian and embryonic Drosophila melanogaster macrophages, respectively (27Naito M. Kodama T.

Rigotti, unpublished data. 2A. Pearson and A. Rigotti, unpublished data.) In the current study, we have examined the binding of phospholipids to class B scavenger receptors (SR-B). SR-Bs are members of the CD36 superfamily of proteins, including CD36 itself and SR-BI (3Acton S.L. Scherer P.E. Lodish H.F. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21003-21009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SR-Bs are expressed in a variety of cells and tissues, including macrophages and endothelial cells (1Abumrad N.A.

Although its physiologic functions are unknown, CD36 may serve as an adhesion molecule, a component in fatty acid transport (1Abumrad N.A. El-Maghrabi M.R. Amri E.-Z. Lopez E. Grimaldi P.A. J. Biol.

Today. 1993; 14: 131-136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar). A striking feature of SR-BI, not shared by CD36 or other well-defined scavenger receptors, is its ability to bind native LDL with high affinity (3Acton S.L. Scherer P.E. Lodish H.F. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21003-21009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, SR-BI may play an important role in lipid metabolism. Here, we show that SR-BI and CD-36 specifically bind anionic PS and PI liposomes with high affinity, and are, therefore, the first molecularly well-defined cell surface receptors for anionic phospholipids to be described. Reagents (and sources) were: acetic anhydride (Mallinckrodt, Inc., Paris, KY); egg phosphatidylcholine, egg phosphatidic acid, liver phosphatidylinositol, brain phosphatidylserine, egg phosphatidylethanolamine, and brain sphingomyelin (Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc., Alabaster, AL); polycarbonate membrane filters (Poretics Corp., Livermore, CA); sodium [125I]iodide and 1,2-dipalmitoyl-L-3-phosphatidyl[N-methyl-3H]choline ([3H]DPPC) (Amersham Corp.); DEAE-dextran (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.); Ham's F-12 medium, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, fetal bovine serum, and trypsin/EDTA (JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, KS); and penicillin/streptomycin, glutamine, and G418 sulfate (Life Technologies, Inc.). All other reagents and supplies were purchased from Sigma or were obtained as described previously (Krieger, 1983). Human LDL, AcLDL, 125I-labeled LDL, and 125I-labeled AcLDL (90-300 cpm/ng protein) were prepared essentially as described previously (15Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S.

Olson F. Heath T. Vail W. Mayhew E. Papahadjopoulos D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 601: 559-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Phospholipid liposomes were prepared containing the indicated phospholipid, phosphatidylcholine, and free cholesterol in a molar ratio of 1:1:1. The lipids were mixed in chloroform and dried by rotary evaporation for 30 min. For preparation of radiolabeled liposomes, 50-75 μCi of [3H]DPPC (62 Ci/mmol) were added to the lipid mixtures before drying. The dried lipids were resuspended in 150 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.5 (Buffer A). Once the samples were fully hydrated, they were extruded through 0.1-μm pore size polycarbonate membranes using a mini-extruder device (Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc., Alabaster, AL). After extrusion, liposomes were dialyzed against Buffer A and then stored under nitrogen at 4°C until use. Liposomes were used within 2 weeks of preparation. The final phospholipid concentration was determined by the method of 6Bartlett G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 466-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. The average diameters of unlabeled liposomes, which were determined from either two or three independent preparations using light scattering with a Coulter N4 plus light scatterer apparatus (Coulter Electronics Inc., Hialeah, FL), were: PS, 105; PC, 114; PA, 125; PE, 129; PI, 113; and SM, 131 nm. The number of phospholipid molecules/PS liposome was calculated as follows. Cross-sectional areas for cholesterol and phospholipid molecules in hydrated bilayers are assumed to be 0.35 nm2 and 0.47 nm2, respectively ( 26Levine Y.K. Wilkins M.H.F. Nature. 1971; 230: 69-72Crossref Scopus (331) Google Scholar); assuming an homogenous distribution of the components throughout the PS/PC/cholesterol (1:1:1) liposomes, 73% of the surface area (4πr2× 2 (bilayer) × 0.73 = 50477 nm2) was phospholipid, or 107,398 phospholipid molecules/liposome (50477 nm2/0.47 nm2). Based on an average phospholipid mass of 785 g/mol, a liposome concentration of 10 μg phospholipid/ml converts to 0.12 nM in liposome particles. CHO, ldlA (clone 7), ldlA[haSR-BI], and COS M6 cells were grown in culture as described previously (21Krieger M.

Transfected COS cells were prepared as described above. Binding assays were performed as described previously (3Acton S.L. Scherer P.E. Lodish H.F. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21003-21009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with the following minor modifications. Cells were prechilled on ice for 30 min, incubated with the indicated radiolabeled ligands (125I-LDL, 125I-AcLDL, or 3H-labeled liposomes) in ice-cold medium D (Ham's F-12 containing 0.5% (w/v) fatty acid free bovine serum albumin (FAF-BSA) and 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4), with or without unlabeled competitors, for 2 h at 4°C with gentle shaking. Cells were then washed twice with Tris wash buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 0.15 M NaCl, pH 7.4) containing 2 mg/ml FAF-BSA, followed by one rapid wash with Tris wash buffer without FAF-BSA. The cells were then solubilized with 0.1 N NaOH, and radioactivity and protein determinations were made as described previously (3Acton S.L. Scherer P.E. Lodish H.F. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21003-21009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The specific, high affinity ligand binding activities shown represent the differences between values obtained in the absence (total binding) and presence (nonspecific binding) of an excess of the indicated unlabeled ligands. Nonspecific binding of [3H]PS liposomes to cells was generally low. For example, for the experiment shown in Fig. 1, nonspecific binding ranged from 10% (at 2.5 μg phospholipid/ml) to 28% (at 100 μg phospholipid/ml) of the total binding. For [3H]PC liposomes, nonspecific binding ranged from 21% (at 2.5 μg phospholipid/ml) to 58% (at 100 μg phospholipid/ml) of the total binding. The binding values are expressed as nanograms of bound 125I-labeled protein or ng of total phospholipids from 3H-labeled liposomes/milligram of cell protein. To determine if phospholipids could bind to haSR-BI, we prepared 105 nm diameter PS liposomes (PS/phosphatidylcholine/cholesterol, ratio 1:1:1) radiolabeled with trace amounts of [3H]dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (62 Ci/mmol) and examined their binding at 4°C to untransfected cells (ldlA) and transfected cells which express haSR-BI (ldlA[haSR-BI]). Fig. 1 shows that there was substantial, high affinity (Kd~15 μg phospholipid/ml) and saturable binding to the transfected cells (filled circles), but relatively little binding to the untransfected cells (filled squares). Assuming that the phospholipid and cholesterol were uniformly distributed in homogenous liposomes containing approximately 107,400 molecules of phospholipid/liposome (see “Experimental Procedures”), we estimate the Kd (mol of PS liposomes/liter) to be ~0.18 nM. PS binding was apparently independent of divalent cations because it was not inhibited by EDTA (1-10 mM, data not shown). Binding depended on the phospholipid composition of the liposomes. In contrast to that of [3H]PS liposomes, the binding of radiolabeled PC liposomes (PC/cholesterol, 2:1, Fig. 1, open circles) was very low and similar to [3H]PS binding to untransfected ldlA cells. These results indicated that phospholipids can bind to haSR-BI and that this binding might depend on the charge of the phospholipid head group. The specificity of the binding was further assessed by determining the competition for [3H]PS binding by unlabeled liposomes of various compositions (indicated phospholipid/PC/cholesterol, ratio 1:1:1). Table I shows that the anionic phospholipids PS and PI were effective inhibitors while the zwitterionic PC and PE as well as SM were not. PA, another anionic phospholipid, was able to compete, but not as effectively as PS and PI.TABLE ISpecificity of [3H]PS and 125I-LDL binding to haSR-BI expressed in transfected ldlA cells Open table in a new tab We previously established that haSR-BI can bind both native LDL and AcLDL with high affinity (3Acton S.L. Scherer P.E. Lodish H.F. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21003-21009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 2A shows that PS and PI liposomes inhibited virtually all of the binding of 125I-AcLDL to haSR-BI in transiently transfected COS cells (>50% inhibition at concentrations >10 μg phospholipid/ml), while PC had virtually no effect at concentrations as high as 250 μg phospholipid/ml. We also observed that PS, but not PC, liposomes inhibited most of the binding of native 125I-LDL to haSR-BI in ldlA[haSR-BI] cells. Indeed, the specificity of liposome inhibition of 125I-LDL binding was almost identical to that for the inhibition of [3H]PS binding (). The extent of PS inhibition of 125I-LDL binding depended on the relative PS content of the liposomes. Fig. 3 shows that inhibition by 500 μg phospholipid/ml increased substantially as the amount of PS in PS/PC mixed liposomes increased from 0 to 50 mol % of total phospholipid, with greater than 50% inhibition occurring when the PS mol % was >10. These competition experiments suggest that anionic phospholipids bound to haSR-BI at a site close to or identical with the site(s) of native and modified LDL binding and that interaction of the liposomes with haSR-BI may involve polyvalent binding via multiple anionic phospholipid molecules.Figure 3:Effect of the phosphatidylserine/phosphatidylcholine molar ratio on liposome inhibition of 125I-LDL binding to haSR-BI at 4°C. On day 2 of cell growth, the binding of 125I-LDL (5 μg protein/ml, 278 cpm/ng protein) to ldlA[haSR-BI] cells was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures” in the presence of PS/PC/cholesterol liposomes (500 μg phospholipid/ml, total phospholipid/cholesterol ratio of 2:1) with the indicated composition of phosphatidylserine (expressed as mole percentage of total phospholipid). The binding values represent the means of duplicate determinations. The 100% control value was 560 ng 125I-LDL protein/mg cell protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) haSR-BI is a member of the CD36 superfamily of proteins (3Acton S.L. Scherer P.E. Lodish H.F. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21003-21009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both haSR-BI and human CD36 (huCD36, 32% amino acid sequence identity to haSR-BI) are class B scavenger receptors which can bind a variety of modified proteins (AcLDL, OxLDL, maleylated BSA); however, they cannot bind to many of the other polyanions which are ligands of the class A and C scavenger receptors (3Acton S.L. Scherer P.E. Lodish H.F. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21003-21009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 2B shows that, as was the case for haSR-BI, the binding of 125I-AcLDL to huCD36 expressed in COS cells was inhibited by PI and PS, but not by PC. PI was a significantly better inhibitor than PS. Thus, CD36, as well as haSR-BI, apparently can serve as a receptor for anionic phospholipids. Except for the apparent differences in the ability to recognize PE, the receptor activity reported by 14Fukasawa M. Hirota K. Adachi H. Mimura K. Murakami-Murofushi K. Tsujimoto M. Arai H. Inoue K.

Therefore, in addition to SR-BI and CD36 there may be other receptors for phospholipids. Establishing the structural and functional relationships of class B receptors to previously described anionic phospholipid receptor activities and determining the physiologic significance of anionic phospholipid binding by class B scavenger receptors, particularly with regard to the recognition of lipoproteins and damaged or senescent cells, will require additional studies. ldlA[haSR-BI] cells were plated on day 0. On day 2, the binding of [3H]PS liposomes (10 μg total phospholipid/ml, 28 cpm/ng total phospholipid) or 125I-LDL (5 μg protein/ml, 94 cpm/ng protein) at 4°C was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures” in the absence (“none”) or presence of the indicated phospholipid liposomes (150 μg total phospholipid/ml). The values represent the average of two determinations. The 100% of control values for the binding of [3H]PS liposomes (experiment 1) and 125I-LDL (experiment 2) were 410 and 139 ng/mg cell protein, respectively.

Based on these data, most (94% molar mass) of the outer third of CE structure consists of intra- and interchain cross-linked loricrin, admixed with SPR1 and SPR2 proteins as bridging cross-links between loricrin. Likewise, the middle third of CE structure consists largely of cross-linked loricrin and SPR proteins, but is mixed with the novel protein elafin which also forms cross-bridges between loricrin. In addition, cross-links involving loricrin and keratins 1, 2e, and 10 or filaggrin were recovered in both levels. The data establish for the first time that these several proteins are indeed cross-linked protein components of the CE structure. In addition, the data support a model for the intermediate to final stages of CE assembly: the proteins elafin, SPR1 and SPR2, and loricrin begin to be deposited on a preformed scaffold; later, elafin deposition decreases as loricrin and SPR accumulation continues to effect final assembly.

We show that the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-related protein (LRP) is responsible for the endocytosis of secreted APP. APPs770 degradation is inhibited by an LRP antagonist called the receptor-associated protein (RAP) and by LRP antibodies and is greatly diminished in fibroblasts genetically deficient in LRP. APPs695, which lacks the KPI domain, is a poor LRP ligand. Since LRP also binds apolipoprotein E (apoE)-enriched lipoproteins and inheritance of the epsilon 4 allele of the apoE gene is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), these data link in a single metabolic pathway two molecules strongly implicated in the pathophysiology of AD."
https://openalex.org/W2052249831,CD5 is a transmembrane protein that is expressed on the surface of T cells and a subset of B cells. The absence of CD5 rendered thymocytes hyperresponsive to stimulation through the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) in vitro. Selection of T cells expressing three distinct transgenic TCRs was also abnormal in CD5-deficient mice. These observations indicate that CD5 can influence the fate of developing thymocytes by acting as a negative regulator of TCR-mediated signal transduction.

Both recombinant proteins caused histamine release from the human basophils of a subpopulation of donors, and this release was dependent on IgE.

When axonin-1 or Nr-CAM interactions were perturbed, many commissural axons failed to cross the midline and turned instead along the ipsilateral floor plate border. In contrast, though perturbation of Ng-CAM produced a defasciculation of the commissural neurites, it did not affect their guidance across the floor plate."

Therefore, p35 likely inhibits a component of the death machinery that is both ubiquitous and highly conserved in evolution.

Additionally, p35 blocks TNF- and Fas-induced proteolytic cleavage of the death substrate poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase from its native 116-kDa form to the characteristic 85-kDa form.

Science. 1995; 267: 1449-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (3957) Google Scholar). Activation of the TNF receptor in virally infected host cells results in their elimination from the host organism. Similarly, cytotoxic T-cells have been shown to kill infected host cells by activating the Fas pathway(3Kagi D. Vignaux F. Ledermann B. Burki K. Depraetere V. Nagata S. Hengartner H. Golstein P. Science. 1994; 265: 528-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (1461) Google Scholar). Activated cytotoxic T-cells express the Fas ligand, which upon engaging and activating the Fas receptor on the surface of the virally infected cells, delivers a death signal. Both elimination events proceed through a process of active, programmed cell death termed apoptosis(4Vaux D.L. Haecker G. Strasser A. Cell. 1994; 76: 777-779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar), which results in the death of virus-bearing host cells in order to attenuate viral spread. Apoptosis is characterized by a series of orchestrated intracellular events that lead to the selective removal of target cells without an accompanying inflammatory response. Apoptotic events are morphologically distinguishable by cellular shrinkage, nuclear condensation, cytoplasmic vacuolization, and membrane blebbing. Biochemical events include the activation of specific proteases resulting in the cleavage of certain recently identified protein substrates(5Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Ottaviano Y. Davidson N.E. Poirier G.G. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3976-3985PubMed Google Scholar, 6Lazebnik Y.A. Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Poirier G.G. Earnshaw W.C.

This unusual class of cysteine proteases cleaves only following certain specific aspartic acid residues, and until of late, the only known substrate was prointerleukin-1β, which is converted to the active cytokine by ICE. Now, however, the 116-kDa DNA repair enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) has been shown to be proteolytically processed to a signature 85-kDa fragment by an aspartate-specific cleavage mediated by an ICE-like protease (termed prICE) that appears to be distinct from ICE itself(6Lazebnik Y.A.

Viral mutants lacking p35 induce premature death of the host cells with a resultant decline in viral yields. Surprisingly, p35 can inhibit not only virally induced apoptosis but also developmentally programmed cell death in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans(14Sugimoto A. Friesen P.D. Rothman J.H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2023-2028Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). p35 expression in transgenic worms, for example, can rescue embryonic lethality resulting from a mutation in ced-9, an endogenous suppressor of cell death. Additionally, p35 has been found to suppress developmental cell death in Drosophila(15Hay B.A. Wolff T. Rubin G.M. Development. 1994; 120: 2121-2129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ectopic targeted p35 expression to the eyes of transgenic flies eliminates all normally occurring cell death in this tissue and, furthermore, also inhibits x-irradiation-induced death. Remarkably, p35 can also inhibit apoptosis in mammalian neural cells deprived of neurotropic stimulation (1Smith C.A. Farrah T. Goodwin R.G. Cell. 1994; 76: 959-962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1829) Google Scholar, 17Rabizadeh S. LaCount D.J. Friesen P.D. Bredesen D.E. J.

We now show for the first time that p35 inhibits TNF- and Fas-induced apoptosis and, in addition, it blocks the cleavage of PARP, a death substrate in the apoptotic pathway. The TNF-sensitive MCF7 breast carcinoma cell line was provided by Dr. David R. Spriggs (University of Wisconsin). The Fas-sensitive MCF-Fas subclone was obtained by transfecting a Fas receptor expression construct into the MCF7 cells (18Jaattela M. Bennedict M. Tewari M. Shayman J.A. Dixit V.M.

The entire p35 open reading frame obtained as a 0.9-kilobase pair EcoRI/XbaI fragment was cloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). Transfection by electroporation of p35/pcDNA3 and pcDNA3 (vector alone) into MCF7 cells and selection of stable lines was carried out as described previously(20Tewari M. Dixit V.M. J. Biol.

For transient transfection of MCF-Fas lines, 105 cells were plated onto 6-well plates and incubated for 18 h. Transfections were by the Lipofectamine (Life Technologies, Inc.) procedure according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were exposed to agonist anti-Fas antibody (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) 28 h following transfection with the indicated plasmids. Transient transfection of BJAB cells was by electroporation, followed by anti-Fas exposure 48 h later. To quantitate TNF-induced apoptosis in stably transfected MCF7 lines, a previously described quantitative apoptosis assay using propidium iodide was used(20Tewari M. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3255-3260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). For measurement of TNF toxicity, 2 × 104 cells were plated in 24-well plates, incubated for 24 h, exposed to 20 ng/ml TNF (1.2 × 107 units/mg, Genentech) for 18 h, washed, and incubated for a further 48 h in TNF-free media. Wells were fixed and stained by adding 0.5% methylene blue in 50% ethanol for 30 min, and after washing, the incorporated methylene blue was solubilized in 1% Sarkosyl in phosphate buffered saline. The resulting color intensities were quantitated on a microplate reader (BioTek Instruments) at an absorbance of 630 nM. For the transient apoptosis assays, cells transfected with a β-galactosidase expression vector together with either a p35 expression construct or vector control were exposed to anti-Fas (250 ng/ml) for 16 h, fixed with 0.5% glutaraldehyde (EM Sciences) or methanol (for MCF-Fas and BJAB cells, respectively), and stained with 1 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl β-D-galactoside (Boehringer Mannheim) to detect β-galactosidase expression. The resulting β-galactosidase positive (green) cells were examined for apoptotic morphology including cellular shrinkage, nuclear condensation, and cytoplasmic blebbing, by phase contrast microscopy (MCF-Fas), or by propidium iodide staining and fluorescence microscopy (BJAB). Total RNA was isolated (21Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar) and enriched for the poly(A)+ fraction using a kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was transferred to nylon membranes and probed with a 32P-labeled 1-kilobase pair DNA fragment corresponding to the entire p35 open reading frame according to established procedures (22Sambrook J.

The peroxidase signal was visualized by chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Corp.). To determine if p35 expression was capable of blocking TNF-induced apoptosis, MCF7, a TNF-sensitive human breast carcinoma cell line(20Tewari M. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3255-3260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar), was stably transfected with a p35 expression construct, and clonal cell lines were derived. Fig. 1A shows that after an 18-h exposure to TNF (20 ng/ml), only 12% of a vector-transfected line (V-2) was not apoptotic as recognized by staining cellular DNA with propidium iodide and assessing nuclear fragmentation by fluorescence microscopy. However, in two p35-transfected lines, p35#4 and p35#5, approximately 90% of the cells were resistant to apoptosis. A third p35-expressing line, p35#2, had intermediate numbers of apoptotic cells. To confirm that assessing nuclear fragmentation by fluorescence microscopy corresponded to gross toxicity, cell survival following an 18-h TNF exposure was determined by incubating the cells for a further 48 h in TNF-free media. As shown in the inset to Fig. 1A, p35#4 and p35#5, and to a lesser extent, p35#2, displayed increased survival rates when compared with vector controls. The relative lower survival rates compared with that assessed by staining cellular DNA could either be due to reversible growth inhibition during the 18-h TNF incubation or the presence of additional apoptotic events even after the 18-h TNF exposure. Northern blots of poly(A)+-enriched RNA from these lines verified p35 expression in the p35 stable transfectants (Fig. 1B). The p35#2 line had considerably less transcript when compared with p35#4 and p35#5, which would explain the intermediate levels of protection observed in p35#2. Therefore, there exists a dose-response relationship between the level of p35 expression and the degree of protection conferred from TNF-induced cell death. It had previously been found that anti-Fas killing in the parental MCF7 line required the concomitant presence of cycloheximide, a protein synthesis inhibitor, to enhance Fas toxicity(20Tewari M. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3255-3260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). To allow a comparison of TNF- and Fas-induced killing in the same line without cycloheximide coincubation, thereby avoiding complications resulting from the toxicity of cycloheximide itself, the level of Fas expression was augmented by transfecting with a Fas expression construct and deriving a stable transfectant designated MCF-Fas(18Jaattela M. Bennedict M. Tewari M. Shayman J.A. Dixit V.M. Oncogene. 1995; 10 (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). This cell line was susceptible to Fas-induced death in the absence of a protein synthesis inhibitor. MCF-Fas cells were transiently cotransfected with a β-galactosidase reporter and a p35 expression or vector control construct followed by Fas activation by cross-linking with an agonistic antibody. Assessment of nuclear morphology of β-galactosidase-positive cells revealed that p35 markedly protected cells from Fas-induced apoptosis (Fig. 2A). Additional transient transfections performed in BJAB cells, a B cell line that is sensitive to Fas-induced apoptosis(20Tewari M. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3255-3260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar), also demonstrated that p35 protected cells from Fas-induced apoptosis (Fig. 2B). Analysis of the integrity of the death substrate PARP in the vector-transfected MCF7 line revealed complete cleavage of the native 116-kDa PARP to the signature 85-kDa proteolytic fragment within 16 h of exposure to TNF (Fig. 3A). However, in the p35#4 and p35#5 lines, only low levels of the 85-kDa proteolytic product were seen even after 24-48 h of TNF exposure. The underexpressing p35#2 line displayed a PARP cleavage rate that was only marginally slower than the vector-transfected control, V-2. Similar results were seen when MCF7 cells were treated with anti-Fas (Fig. 3B). While PARP cleavage was slower and not as complete as in TNF-treated cultures, p35 still significantly inhibited its cleavage in the p35#4 and p35#5 clones and to a lesser extent in the intermediate expressing p35#2 line. Therefore, as with TNF-induced killing, there exists a dose-response relationship between the level of p35 expression and the degree of inhibition of PARP cleavage. In summary, the baculovirus p35 protein was able to block not only Fas- and TNF-induced apoptosis but also Fas- and TNF-induced PARP cleavage. Given that p35 inhibits both TNF and Fas killing, along with previous reports of its ability to block developmental, viral, and x-irradiation-induced cell death, the present results indicate that TNF- and Fas-mediated apoptotic pathways must have components in common with these highly conserved death programs. Inhibition of cleavage of the death substrate PARP has also been observed with the anti-apoptotic cowpox virus CrmA gene product(9Tewari M. Quan L. O'Rourke K. Desnoyers S. Zeng Z. Beidler D.R. Poirier G.G. Salvesen G. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 801-809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2259) Google Scholar). However, CrmA is a serpin capable of inhibiting ICE family members whereas p35 possesses no homology to any protease inhibitor. This suggests that p35 must inhibit cleavage of the death substrate PARP and ultimately cell death at a site unique in the cell death pathway. Thus, p35 protein will be an invaluable tool in helping identify components of this highly conserved cell death pathway. We gratefully acknowledge Dr. David R. Spriggs for providing the MCF7 cell line, Dr. Fred Wang for providing the BJAB line, and Marja Jäättelä for producing the MCF-Fas line.

https://openalex.org/W2064326439,"Overexpression of the RHAMM gene by transfection into fibroblasts is transforming and causes spontaneous metastases in the lung. H-ras-transformed fibrosarcomas transfected with a dominant suppressor mutant of RHAMM exhibit a so-called revertant phenotype and are completely nontumorigenic and nonmetastatic. Conversely, fibroblasts stably expressing low levels of RHAMM as a result of antisense transfection are resistant to ras transformation. Collectively, these results indicate that RHAMM acts downstream of ras. The loss of functional RHAMM ablates signaling within focal adhesions, in particular changes in focal adhesion kinase phosphorylation, and as a result these focal adhesions are unable to turn over in response to hyaluronan. These results provide evidence of the oncogenic potential of a novel extracellular matrix receptor and establish a functional link between transformation by ras and signaling within focal adhesions that are required for transformation by this oncogene."
https://openalex.org/W2106340035,"Sensory transduction in vertebrate photoreceptors and olfactory sensory neurons is mediated by cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels that conduct mono- and divalent cations. Ca2+ entering the cell through CNG channels intimately controls signaling pathways by regulating several key enzymes. Cloned CNG channels from photoreceptors and olfactory sensory neurons profoundly differ in their relative Ca2+ permeability, their blockage by external divalent cations, and the fraction of current carried by Ca2+. In particular, CNG channels from cone photoreceptors conduct significantly more Ca2+ than those from rod photoreceptors. Furthermore, the current through the olfactory CNG channel is entirely carried by Ca2+ at approximately 3 mM extracellular Ca2+. These results suggest that a major function of CNG channels is to provide a pathway for Ca2+ entry."

NO is produced via the metabolism of one of the chemically equivalent guanidino nitrogens of L-arginine by the enzyme endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS)(1Moncada S. Palmer R.M.J. Higgs E.A.

Chem. 1994; 269: 13725-13728Google Scholar). eNOS is localized in membrane fractions (>90% of the total protein) of freshly isolated and serially passaged endothelial cells and of recombinant cells expressing the eNOS cDNA(3Sessa W.C.

A. 1991; 88: 10480-10484Google Scholar). eNOS is the only N-myristoylated protein in the NOS family, and N-myristoylation is necessary for the particulate localization of the enzyme as demonstrated by the inability of non-myristoylated mutants to efficiently bind to biological membranes(5Liu J. Sessa W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11691-11694Google Scholar, 6Sessa W.C. Barber C.M. Lynch K.R. Circ. Res. 1993; 72: 921-924Google Scholar). Moreover, N-myristoylation is necessary for palmitoylation of eNOS(7Robinson L.J. Busconi L. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 995-998Google Scholar); however, the site(s) of palmitoylation and the contribution of this post-translational modification to the membrane association are not known. Since the precise biological membrane(s) where eNOS resides and the functional significance of such localization are not well described(8Pollock J.S. Nakane M. Buttery L.D.K. Martinez A. Springall D.

J. 1994; 299: 247-252Google Scholar), we set out to examine the localization of eNOS in bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC).MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture and Immunofluorescent, Light, and Electron MicroscopyEndothelial cells were isolated from BAEC or HUVEC and were isolated and cultured as described previously(5Liu J. Sessa W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11691-11694Google Scholar, 10Gimbrone M.A. Spacet T.H. Progress in Hemostasis and Thrombosis. Grune & Stratton Inc., New York1976: 1-28Google Scholar). Cells were grown in plastic tissue culture flasks and used at passages 2-3.For immunofluorescence microscopy, BAEC or HUVEC were plated on Permanox 4-chamber slides. The cells were fixed in 1.5% formaldehyde, 0.1 M sodium phosphate (pH 7.4) for 10 min at 25°C and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS/0.1% BSA for 5 min. Cells were incubated with the appropriate primary antibodies for 2 h (eNOS mAb, H32, IgG2a isotype, 56 μg/ml tissue culture supernatant, 1:500 dilution(8Pollock J.S. Nakane M. Buttery L.D.K. Martinez A. Springall D. Polak J.M. Forstermann U. Murad F. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C1379-C1387Google Scholar), and mannosidase II polyclonal antisera, 1:500 dilution(11Moremen K.W. Touster O. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10945-10951Google Scholar)) followed by washing and incubation for 1 h with fluorescein isothiocyanate- and/or Texas Red-labeled second antibodies (Jackson Laboratories, 1:400 dilutions). After washing in PBS/BSA, slides were mounted with Slowfade (Molecular Probes) and observed with a Bio-Rad MRC 600 confocal inverted microscope. Controls using non-immune at equivalent dilutions as immune antibody or secondary antibody alone were negative. Identical perinuclear localization was detected with a commercially available eNOS mAb (1:300 dilution, Transduction Laboratories) and a rabbit polyclonal eNOS Ab directed against a glutathione S-transferase-eNOS fusion protein (amino acids 134-579 of bovine eNOS).For light microscopy, frozen sections (10 μm) of lymph nodes were air-dried, acetone-fixed for 10 min, and incubated overnight with tissue culture supernatant mAb H32 (56 μg/ml, 1:300) in PBS/0.1% BSA. Sections were washed and incubated with peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse antibody (Dako Corp.) for 45 min at room temperature and visualized with DAB reagent for 10 min. Controls with non-immune IgG2a and secondary antibody alone were negative.For electron microscopy, BAEC were grown as confluent monolayers onto tissue culture slides with chambers (Tissue-Tek) and fixed in situ at room temperature for 15 min in 3% paraformaldehyde/0.1% glutaraldehyde, buffered to pH 7.4 in 0.1 M phosphate buffer. Cells were washed with 0.1% BSA/phosphate-buffered saline (PBS-BSA, 30 min) and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS (5 min) and then washed again with PBS-BSA. Cells were then incubated overnight at 4°C with primary eNOS antibody (H32, protein A-purified ascites fluid, 910 μg/ml) at a dilution of 1:500. An irrelevant IgG2a (1 mg/ml), at the same dilution, served as a negative control. Sites of antibody binding were visualized by the avidin/biotin peroxidase technique (Vectastain ABC kit, Vector Laboratories). After the staining reaction with diaminobenzidine/hydrogen peroxide, the cells were refixed with half-strength Karnovsky's glutaraldehyde/paraformaldehyde fixative, followed by 1% OsO4. Cells were dehydrated in increasing concentrations of ethanol and embedded in epoxy resin. Ultrathin serial sections, cut parallel to the original surface, were left unstained or were double stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and viewed in a Zeiss 109 transmission electron microscope, operated at an accelerating voltage of 80 kV.Generation of Stable Cell Lines and Measurement of NO ReleaseWild-type and G2A mutant (in which glycine-2 has been mutated to alanine) eNOS cDNAs were constructed (6Sessa W.C. Barber C.M. Lynch K.R. Circ. Res. 1993; 72: 921-924Google Scholar) and subcloned into the mammalian expression vector, pcDNA3 (containing the neomycin-resistant gene). Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293, ATCC) were transfected with wild-type or G2A eNOS cDNAs in pcDNA3 (15 μg of plasmid DNA/1 × 106 cells in 100-mm dishes) according to the standard calcium phosphate precipitation method. Transfected cells were selected for growth in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing penicillin (100 IU/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (complete DMEM) in the presence of G418 (800 μg/ml). After 14 days, G418-resistant colonies were isolated and maintained in DMEM containing G418 (250 μg/ml). Lines WT.HEK5 and G2A.HEK6 were used for this study. Western blot analysis was performed as described previously(5Liu J. Sessa W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11691-11694Google Scholar).For measurement of NOx (NO2- and NO3-) release from stably transfected cells, HEK-293 cells were grown in 35-mm2 dishes. The medium was changed to Hanks' balanced salt solution supplemented with L-arginine (100 μM) and CaCl2 (1.3 mM), and cells were equilibrated for 30 min at 37°C. In some experiments cells were treated with NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (300 μM) in the absence or in the presence of additional L-arginine (2 mM). To stimulate NO release, ionomycin (3 μM) was added for 1 h, and the supernatant was collected for analysis of NOx by chemiluminescence. Samples (100 μl) containing NOx were refluxed in 0.1 M vanadium(III) chloride in 2 M HCl. Under these conditions, both NO2- and NO3- are quantitatively reduced to NO, which was quantified by a chemiluminescence detector after reaction with ozone. Cells were scraped and lysed with 1 N NaOH for total protein determination using the Lowry assay. Net NOx per mg of protein was calculated after subtracting unstimulated basal release from the control wells.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONLocalization of eNOS in BAEC and HUVEC by indirect immunofluorescence using an eNOS monoclonal antibody, H32, revealed specific, crescent-shaped, perinuclear staining and additional diffuse, peripheral staining of the antigen (Fig. 1, A and B). In both subconfluent and confluent EC monolayers, no significant plasma membrane staining was observed. Due to the difficulty in visualizing the spatial orientation of proteins in flat endothelial monolayers that line large blood vessels, we stained human lymph node microvessels from frozen biopsy samples that contain cuboidal shaped, high endothelial venules. As seen in Fig. 1, C and D, staining of lymphatic tissue demonstrated an intense, perinuclear peroxidase product in high endothelial venules, a pattern identical to that seen in cultured BAEC and HUVEC. More interestingly, the staining appeared to be polarized toward the vessel lumen. This polarized orientation suggests that activation of eNOS by shear forces and local factors (bradykinin, ATP) would favor NO to be released lumenally to influence lymphocyte trafficking or leukocyte-platelet adhesion to the vascular endothelium.Next, we colocalized eNOS in BAEC with various markers for cellular organelles by confocal microscopy. eNOS did not colocalize with dihydrotetramethylrosamine, a redox-sensitive dye for mitochondria, or with calnexin, a resident glycoprotein chaperone of the endoplasmic reticulum. Additionally, eNOS did not colocalize with iron-loaded transferrin, suggesting an association of eNOS with structures other than those associated with recycling plasmalemma-derived endocytic vesicles.2 2G. Garcia-Cardena and W. C. Sessa unpublished results. However, a majority of the eNOS staining did colocalize with mannosidase II (1:500 dilution of rabbit polyclonal antibody(11Moremen K.W. Touster O. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10945-10951Google Scholar), a lumenal Golgi protein (Fig. 2A). Immunoperoxidase labeling/electron microscopy shows high concentrations of eNOS at the cytoplasmic face of Golgi stacks (Fig. 2B) and some staining in adjacent vesicles. There was no obvious reaction product in endoplasmic reticulum or plasma membrane of various cells in multiple experiments.Figure 2:Colocalization of eNOS with mannosidase II, a Golgi marker, and electron microscopic localization of eNOS on Golgi membranes. In A, BAEC were double labeled by simultaneous incubations of cells with mannosidase II (Man II) and H32 eNOS mAb antibodies and processed as above.

G2A eNOS is not myristoylated or palmitoylated and is a soluble protein that behaves identically to membrane-associated, wild-type eNOS in direct measurements of NOS activity(6Sessa W.C. Barber C.M. Lynch K.R. Circ. Res. 1993; 72: 921-924Google Scholar, 7Robinson L.J. Busconi L. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 995-998Google Scholar). Immunolocalization of eNOS reveals a majority of the WT enzyme in a perinuclear crescent that colocalizes with mannosidase II, whereas the G2A enzyme exhibits a diffuse cytoplasmic stain that does not overlap with the Golgi marker (Fig. 3, middle and lower panels). Non-transfected HEK 293 cells do not stain for eNOS but stain for mannosidase II (Fig. 3, top panel). Measurements of eNOS specific activities (assessed by nitro-L-arginine-inhibitable conversion of 3H-labeled L-arginine to 3H-labeled L-citrulline) were similar in lysates from both cell lines (89 and 92 pmol/mg/min in WT and G2A eNOS-transfected HEK 293 cells, respectively) as were the amounts of immunoreactive NOS protein (Fig. 4A). Pulse-chase analysis of 35S-labeled eNOS demonstrated identical turnovers for both WT and G2A eNOS (18-20 h). These data suggest that myristoylation and/or palmitoylation of eNOS are necessary for Golgi targeting of the protein in a heterologous expression system.Figure 3:Wild-type eNOS colocalizes with mannosidase II in stably transfected HEK 293 cells, whereas G2A mutant eNOS does not.

L-NMMA, NG-monomethyl-L-arginine.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To examine the functional significance of eNOS localized to the Golgi, we then challenged both WT and G2A-transfected cells with the calcium-mobilizing ionophore, ionomycin, and measured NOx release (the sum of all nitrogen oxides). Agonist-dependent increases in cytoplasmic calcium facilitate calcium/calmodulin-dependent activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase and cause the subsequent release of NO(1Moncada S. Palmer R.M.J. Higgs E.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 109-142Google Scholar, 3Sessa W.C. J. Vasc. Res. 1994; 31: 131-143Google Scholar). Ionomycin (3 μM) induced the release of NOx from both WT and G2A-transfected HEK 293 cells; however, 3-4 times more NOx was released from WT eNOS cells (Fig. 4B). The release of NOx from both WT and G2A cells was L-arginine-dependent, attenuated by the NOS inhibitor, NG-monomethyl-L-arginine and partially reversed by L-arginine (L-Arg). These data suggest that compartmentalization of WT eNOS on the Golgi is necessary for the enzyme to respond to intracellular signals (calcium/calmodulin) and to efficiently utilize the cellular cofactors (O2, NADPH, FMN, FAD, and tetrahydrobiopterin) required for the stoichiometric conversion of L-arginine to NO.The mechanism of how eNOS or other fatty acylated membrane proteins get to their final destination is a subject of intense investigation in many laboratories(12Resh M.D. Cell. 1994; 76: 411-413Google Scholar). For myristoylated eNOS, there are two possible fates; either it can be targeted to the Golgi where it is palmitoylated by a Golgi membrane-associated palmitoyltransferase (13Schmidt J.W. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13713-13723Google Scholar, 14Gutierrez L. Magee A.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1078: 147-154Google Scholar) or it can be palmitoylated in the cytosol by a cytoplasmic palmitoyltransferase and then targeted to the Golgi. For plasma membrane proteins such as p21H-ras or Src-related proteins, palmitoylation is necessary for membrane binding and localization(15Hancock J.F. Paterson H. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1990; 63: 133-139Google Scholar, 16Koegl M. Zlatkine P. Ley S.C. Courtneidge S.A. Magee A.I. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 749-753Google Scholar). However, for the Golgi-associated enzyme, glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD 65), palmitoylation is not required for membrane association or localization(17Solimena M. Aggujaro D. Muntzel C. Dirkx R. Butler M. DeCamilli P.D. Hayday A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3073-3077Google Scholar, 18Shi Y. Veit B. Baekkeskov S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 927-934Google Scholar). Whether palmitoylation of eNOS is necessary for Golgi localization is not known and is presently being investigated.The presence of eNOS on the Golgi is functionally important for the activation of eNOS and the release of NO as demonstrated by the ability of cells expressing Golgi-localized eNOS to release more NOx than mutant cells. Presently, we cannot rule out the possibility that the diffuse cytoplasmic staining in endothelial cells represents eNOS in non-endosomal, post-Golgi vesicles destined for another cellular compartment. However, preliminary data demonstrate that stimulation of early passage BAEC with bradykinin or HUVECs with histamine does not influence the localization of eNOS, suggesting that the enzyme is a resident Golgi protein (data not shown). Quantitative imaging of intracellular calcium has shown high resting levels of calcium in the perinuclear and Golgi regions of cells(19Chandra S. Gross D. Ling Y. Morrison G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1870-1874Google Scholar, 20Chandra S. Kable E.P. Morrison G.H. Webb W.W. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 100: 747-752Google Scholar), and upon activation of surface receptors, calcium accumulation occurs primarily in these same regions(21Chandra S. Fewtrell C. Millard P.J. Sandison D.R. Webb W.W. Morrison G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15186-15194Google Scholar, 22Burnier M. Centeno G. Burki E. Brunner H.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C1118-C1127Google Scholar). In endothelial cells, laminar fluid shear stress, a stimulus for NO release, also increases perinuclear calcium accumulation(23Geiger R.V. Berk B.C. Alexander R.W. Nerem R.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C1411-C1417Google Scholar). The perinuclear, Golgi localization of eNOS would promote a productive interaction between calcium, calmodulin, and the enzyme. In addition to the optimal spatial orientation of the enzyme with its primary activator, calcium, the Golgi localization of eNOS suggests that NOx may exert a more generalized role in cellular processes such as the secretion, nitration, and ADP-ribosylation of proteins.

Screening random peptide phage display libraries with soluble empty mouse CD1 (mCD1) identified a peptide binding motif. It consists of three anchor positions occupied by aromatic or bulky hydrophobic amino acids. Equilibrium binding studies demonstrated that mCD1 binds peptides containing the appropriate motif with relatively high affinity. However, in contrast to classical MHC class I molecules, strong binding to mCD1 required relatively long peptides. Peptide-specific, mCD1-restricted T cell responses can be raised, which suggests that the findings are of immunological significance."

Analysis of single CFTR Cl- channels reconstituted into planar lipid bilayers revealed the presence of two open conductance states that are connected to each other and to the closed state by an asymmetric cycle of gating events. We show here that the transition between the two open conductance states is directly coupled to ATP hydrolysis by one of the consensus nucleotide-binding folds, designated NBF2. Moreover, the transition between the closed state and one of the open states is linked to the binding of ATP. This analysis permits real-time visualization of conformational changes associated with a single cycle of ATP hydrolysis by a single protein molecule and suggests a model describing a role for ATP in CFTR gating."

We show that transport of the TrkB ligands NT-4 and BDNF to peripheral neurons is dependent on the low affinity neurotrophin receptor (LNR). Pharmacological manipulation of LNR in vivo using either an anti-LNR antibody or a soluble recombinant LNR extracellular domain completely blocked retrograde transport of NT-4 and BDNF to sensory neurons, while having minimal effects on the transport of NGF in either sensory or sympathetic neurons. Furthermore, in mice with a null mutation of LNR, the transport of NT-4 and BDNF, but not NGF, was dramatically reduced.

In contrast to calcium-independent NOS type II that can be induced in many cell types by cytokines, NOS-III has been thought to be regulated mainly by changes in the intracellular concentrations of calcium (3-5). The importance of regulation of NOS-III expression as a means of regulation of endothelial synthesis of NO production has only recently emerged as a possibility. It has been shown that NOS-III mRNA levels in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells are reduced by tumor necrosis factor-β and that this is due to de-stabilization of NOS-III mRNA(6Yoshizumi M. Perrella M.A. Burnett Jr., J.C. Lee M.E. Circ. Res. 1993; 73: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). Several recent reports also indicated that NOS-III expression could be up-regulated. Increased levels of NOS-III mRNA levels have been reported in bovine endothelial cells subjected to shear stress(7Nishida K. Harrison D.G. Navas J.P. Fisher A.A. Dockery S.P. Uematsu M. Nerem R.M.

However, in no case mechanisms leading to the increase of NOS-III mRNA levels have been elucidated. Recent cloning of the human NOS-III gene revealed the presence in a putative promoter region of the NOS-III gene of several potentially cis-acting regulatory elements which in other genes have been demonstrated to regulate gene expression in response to cAMP, cholesterol, protein kinase C activation, transforming growth factor β, and shear stress(10Marsden P.A.

Our findings demonstrate that lyso-PC enhances NOS-III gene transcription in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Lyso-PC (1-palmitoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) was from Avanti Polar Lipids (Birmingham, AL). Unless otherwise indicated all the other reagents were from Sigma. HUVEC were cultured as described previously (29) in Medium 199 containing 20% bovine calf serum (Hyclone, Logon, UT), 12.5 μg/ml endothelium cell mitogen (Biomedical Technologies, Stoughton, MA), and 100 μg/ml heparin. Only second and third passage cells were used. Twelve hours before lyso-PC treatment cells were transferred to Medium 199 containing 5% fetal bovine serum and no other additives. Total RNA was isolated using Ultraspec (Biotecx Laboratories, Houston, TX). 15-25 μg of RNA was fractionated on 1% agarose and transferred to a positively charged nylon membrane. As NOS-III probe we used a 1.6-kilobase BglII/EcoRI restriction fragment of full-length human NOS-III cDNA cloned in our laboratory (30Chen P.F. Tsai A.L. Wu K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25062-25066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and subcloned into EcoRI sites of pcDNA-3 (Invitrogen). Probe labeling, hybridization, and chemiluminescent detection were performed using components of Genius system (Boehringer Mannheim). Hybridization conditions (5 × SSC, 0.02% SDS, 0.1% sarcosyl, 2% blocking reagent, 68°C, overnight) and high stringency washes (0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS, 60°C, 45 min) assured no cross-hybridization with any other HUVEC mRNA or NOS-II mRNA induced in cultured human aortic vascular smooth muscle cells by 12-h stimulation with human interleukin-1β (100 pg/ml) and γ-interferon (250 units/ml) (n = 2). Membranes were stripped by boiling in 0.1 × SSC containing 1% SDS for 15 min and re-hybridized to 5′-digoxigenin-labeled nucleotide, 5′-ACGGTATCTGATCGTCTTCGAACC-3′, complementary to human 18 S ribosomal RNA or/and to a digoxigenin-labeled glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA probe. Blots were quantified using the Bio Image system (MilliGene). Nuclear Run-Off-Experiments were performed according to an established laboratory procedure(31Greenberg M.E. Bender T.P. Ausubel F.M. Short Protocols in Molecular Biology. Green Publishing Associates and John Wiley and Sons, New York1992: 4-25-4-29Google Scholar). Nuclei (107), isolated from three to five T75 flasks of confluent HUVEC, were incubated in the presence of 0.25 mCi of [32P]GTP and other unlabeled nucleotides (1 mM) in a volume of 200 μl at 26°C for 25 min. Transcribed RNAs were isolated using Ultraspec and equal amounts (6-8 × 106 cpm) were hybridized to denatured plasmids (15 μg) containing cDNAs of NOS-III and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) (both in pcDNA-3) or hamster βtubulin cDNA in pAcUW51 (Pharmingen) immobilized on nitrocellulose membranes. Conditions for hybridization and washes were identical to those during Northern blotting. Densities of bands were quantified using the Bio Image system (MilliGene). To normalize the results, the intensities of β-tubulin bands were assigned an arbitrary densitometric unit of one. Intensities of other bands were expressed as a fraction of the density of β-tubulin bands. Following incubation with lyso-PC for the desired times, HUVEC were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5 mM EDTA and lysed in 300 μl of buffer containing 0.05 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1% Nonidet P-40, 60 mML-arginine HCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 100 μM tetrahydrobiopterin, and all components of Boehringer Mannheim Protease Inhibitors Set. Following centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 2 min, the protein concentrations in lysates were determined using Bio-Rad DC protein assay. Lysates (15 μg of protein) were analyzed by electrophoresis on 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were probed using monoclonal antibodies from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, Kentucky). Antibody N30020 is selective for NOS-III, and antibody N32020 binds to all isoforms of NOS. In some experiments, to confirm the specificities of antibodies, NOS-III standard (1 μg of lysate of stably transfected human kidney cell line 293 overexpressing bovine NOS-III) and NOS-II standard (4 μg of lysate of human aortic vascular smooth muscle cells stimulated with 100 pg/ml human interleukin-1β and 250 units/ml γ-interferon for 24 h) were also analyzed. Immunoreactive bands were visualized using ECL system (Amersham Corp.). NOS activity was assayed in the same lysates that were used for Western blotting. NOS activity was determined as L-NAME-inhibitable conversion of L-arginine to L-citrulline, as described previously(32Zembowicz A. Hatchett R.J. Radziszewski W. Gryglewski R.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1993; 267: 1112-1118PubMed Google Scholar). Incubations were carried out with or without L-NAME (300 μM) and in the presence of 150-200 μg of protein, 106 cpm [2,3-3H]L-arginine HCl, 60 μM unlabeled L-arginine HCl, 10 mM NADPH, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 100 nM calmodulin, 1 mM Ca2+, and 100 μM tetrahydrobiopterin for 30 min. Human washed platelets were prepared as described previously(33Radomski M.W. Moncada S. Thromb. Res. 1983; 30: 383-389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Anti-platelet properties of HUVEC were assayed using an adaptation of an established method of bioassay of NO (34). HUVEC were harvested using trypsin/EDTA into ice-cold Tyrode buffer composed of 8 g/liter NaCl, 0.2 g/liter KCl, 0.225 g/liter MgCl2× 6H2O, 0.05 g/liter NaH2PO4, 1 g/liter NaHCO3, 1.5 g/liter glucose. Typically, equal numbers of control and lyso-PC-treated cells were isolated and 70-80% of those excluded trypan blue. Platelet aggregation was studied using a light transmission aggregometer (Chronolog) in the volume of 500 μl. Incubations contained 2.5 × 108 platelets/ml suspended in Tyrode buffer containing 1 mM Ca2+. HUVEC suspensions or the corresponding volumes of Tyrode buffer (3-20 μl) were added to stirred platelets 2 min before thrombin. L-NAME was added 1 min before the addition of HUVEC. Lyso-PC (30-100 μM) caused a time- and concentrationdependent increase of NOS-III mRNA levels in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) (Fig. 1, A and B). NOS-III mRNA levels reached a maximum (11 ± 2-fold increase by densitometry, n = 7) 6 h after the stimulation with lyso-PC (100 μM). Phosphatidylcholine (100 μM) was without effect (n = 2, not shown). The long half-life of NOS-III mRNA in HUVEC (6Yoshizumi M. Perrella M.A. Burnett Jr., J.C. Lee M.E. Circ. Res. 1993; 73: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar) suggested that lyso-PC may enhance transcription of the NOS-III gene rather then stabilize its mRNA. Indeed, actinomycin D (5 μM) abolished lyso-PC-induced increases of NOS-III mRNA levels (n = 2, not shown). Consistently, in three separate nuclear run-off experiments, treatment of HUVEC with lyso-PC (100 μM) for 3 h enhanced the rate of NOS-III mRNA synthesis by isolated nuclei (Fig. 2, A and B). This provides direct evidence for transcriptional activation of the NOS-III gene by lyso-PC. The induction by lyso-PC of NOS-III mRNA in HUVEC was not inhibited by cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis (Fig. 2C). We investigated the possibility that the elevation of intracellular concentration of Ca2+ or activation of protein kinase C, known actions of lyso-PC in endothelial cells(35Inoue N. Hirata K. Yamada M. Hamamori Y. Matsuda Y. Akita H. Yokoyama M. Circ. Res. 1992; 71: 1410-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 36Ohgushi M. Kugiyama K. Fukunaga K. Murohara T. Sugiyama S. Miyamoto E. Yasue H. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1993; 13: 1525-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), mediates the induction of NOS-III. However, 2-12-h stimulation of HUVEC with calcium ionophore A23187 (3 μM), phorbol myristate acetate (0.3 μM), or their combination did not increase NOS-III mRNA levels (n = 3, not shown).Figure 2:Induction of NOS-III gene transcription in HUVEC by lyso-PC. A, nuclear run-off analysis of transcription rates of NOS-III and β-tubulin (β-Tub) genes in control HUVEC and HUVEC stimulated with lyso-PC (100 μM) for 3 h. Background hybridization to the CAT-pcDNA-3 plasmid is also shown. B, Densitometric analysis of the autoradiograph shown in A. Intensities of β-tubulin (β-Tub) bands were assigned an arbitrary densitometric unit of 1. This graph shows a 2.0-fold increase of NOS-III band intensity in the blot hybridized to RNA synthesized by nuclei isolated from lyso-PC-treated HUVEC. In two other experiments performed similar analysis revealed 2.0- and 2.15-fold increases. Intensities of NOS-III and pcDNA-3 bands in control were identical. This indicates that the basal transcription of the NOS-III gene was below the level of detection of the assay. This is not unexpected, considering low levels of NOS-III mRNA and its stability in HUVEC. Therefore, densitometric analysis may underestimate the actual level of induction of NOS-III gene transcription by lyso-PC. C, Northern blot analysis of 20 μg of total RNA isolated from control HUVEC (lane 1) and HUVEC incubated for 6 h with cycloheximide (CHEX, 10 μM; lane 2), lyso-PC (100 μM; lane 3), or their combination (LysoPC&CHEX; lane 4).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In agreement with changes of NOS-III mRNA levels, lyso-PC (100 μM) caused a time-dependent increase of NOS-III protein in HUVEC lysates (Fig. 3A). NOS-III levels reached a peak (5.5 ± 1.5 -fold increase by densitometry, n = 3) 12 h following stimulation with lyso-PC (100 μM). In the same lysates, lyso-PC induced a biphasic change in NOS activity (Fig. 3B). NOS activity decreased to 42 ± 6% of control (n = 4, p < 0.05) 3 h after stimulation with lyso-PC. At later time points NOS activity increased and reached a plateau after 12 h at the level 2-fold above that in control lysates (Fig. 3B). We found no evidence for NOS-II expression in HUVEC by immunoblotting (Fig. 3A). Our NOS-III antibody recognized only the NOS-III protein expressed in HUVEC and the NOS-III protein standard. The slight difference in electrophoretic mobility of NOS-III of HUVEC and that of NOS-III standard is due to species differences. The NOS-III standard contained bovine NOS-III. Consistently, NOS activity was abolished in the absence of Ca2+ (100% inhibition, n = 2), a property of NOS-III but not NOS-II. To determine whether induction of NOS-III by lyso-PC has the expected physiological consequences, we evaluated the effect of treatment with lyso-PC on the anti-platelet properties of HUVEC. We used a modification of the established method developed to bioassay the release of NO from endothelial cells. As predicted, treatment of HUVEC with lyso-PC (100 μM) for 24 h decreased the number of HUVEC required to inhibit thrombin-induced aggregation of human washed platelets (Fig. 4). The effect of lyso-PC was reversed by NOS inhibitor, L-NAME. The major finding of this paper is the identification of lyso-PC as a transcriptional inducer of constitutive endothelial NOS-III. Our results demonstrate that in cultured HUVEC, lyso-PC causes significant (11-fold) time- and concentration-dependent increase of NOS-III mRNA levels. Increases of NOS-III mRNA levels are accompanied by corresponding elevations (5.5-fold) of NOS-III protein levels. This results in a 2-fold increase of NOS-III activity in HUVEC lysates. At present, we do not know the basis of discrepancies between the levels and time courses of lyso-PC-induced changes of NOS-III mRNA and protein levels and those of NOS activity. These discrepancies suggest, however, that the regulation of NOS-III expression in HUVEC is complex and that it may also involve a lyso-PC-induced post-translational modification (e.g. phosphorylation) of NOS-III. Tetrahydrobiopterin has recently been demonstrated to have a structural role in NO synthases (37). Therefore, it is also possible that low levels of tetrahydrobiopterin present in cultured HUVEC (38Werner-Felmayer G. Werner E.R. Fuchs D. Hausen A. Reibnegger G. Schmidt K. Weiss G. Wachter H. J.

Invest. 1994; 93: 2236-2243Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) result in the inability of HUVEC to form active NOS-III in spite of increased synthesis of NOS-III peptide. Our nuclear run-off experiments and the inhibitory effect of actinomycin D demonstrate that the induction of NOS-III expression by lyso-PC is at least in part mediated by the transcriptional activation of the NOS-III gene. The major implication of these results is that the commonly held view of NOS-III as a “housekeeping gene” regulated mainly at the level of enzyme activity should be revised. Increased de novo synthesis of NOS-III via induction of gene expression may be an important mechanism that augments vasoprotective properties of endothelium in response to extracellular insults. To the best of our knowledge, lyso-PC is the first molecule to be shown to enhance the transcription of the NOS-III gene. Whether signals other then lyso-PC are also capable of transcriptional induction of NOS-III remains to be elucidated. However, recent studies showing the enhancement of NOS-III mRNA levels in cultured cells by shear stress (7) and in vivo by chronic exercise or estrogens(8Sessa W.C. Pritchard K. Seyedi N. Wang J.

A. 1994; 91: 5212-5216Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar) suggest that the regulation of NOS-III at the transcriptional level may be a more common phenomenon. Like the induction by lyso-PC of heparin-binding epidermal growth factor mRNA in human monocytes(26Nakano T. Raines E.W. Abraham J.A. Klagsbrun M. Ross R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1069-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), induction of NOS-III mRNA levels was independent of new protein synthesis. This indicates that the activation of the NOS-III gene by lyso-PC involves the activation of a pre-existing transcriptional factor or factors. We investigated the possibility that the elevation of intracellular concentration of Ca2+ or activation of protein kinase C, known actions of lyso-PC in endothelial cells(35Inoue N. Hirata K.

Miyamoto E. Yasue H. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1993; 13: 1525-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), mediates the induction of NOS-III. However, calcium ionophore A23187, phorbol myristate acetate, or their combination did not increase NOS-III mRNA levels. Lyso-PC has been shown to modify G-proteins (40Flavahan N.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: H722-H727PubMed Google Scholar) and activate adenylate cyclase(41Resnick R.J. Tomaska L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32336-32341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, we did not explore a possibility that any of these effects is involved in transduction pathway of the NOS-III gene activation by lyso-PC. Thus, as in the case of other lyso-PC-activated genes, the signal transduction pathway and transcriptional factors involved in activation of the NOS-III gene by lyso-PC remain to be established. It is also important to note that lyso-PC is the major product of action of cellular phospholipases A2 on phosphatidylcholine, the most abundant phospholipid(42Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13057-13060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to arachidonic acid, the other product of action of phospholipases A2, which is a substrate for enzymes involved in the synthesis of prostanoids and leukotrienes, a role of lyso-PC in signal transduction has only recently been suggested(43Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4232) Google Scholar). Therefore, a putative role of intracellularly generated lyso-PC in the regulation of NOS-III or other lyso-PC-inducible genes in response to extracellular signals might be an interesting area of investigation. We have also conducted experiments designed to determine whether the treatment of HUVEC with lyso-PC potentiates the ability of HUVEC to inhibit platelet aggregation, a key physiological function of endothelial cells. As predicted, the treatment of HUVEC with lyso-PC reduced the number of HUVEC required to inhibit aggregation of human washed platelets. The effect of lyso-PC was reversed by an inhibitor of NO synthase. These results demonstrate that lyso-PC augments the anti-platelet properties of HUVEC and, considered together with the evidence for the simultaneous induction of NOS-III expression, suggest the induction of NOS-III as a mechanism involved. However, whether this is the only mechanism remains to be established. Identification of lyso-PC as an inducer of the NOS-III gene raises several intriguing questions regarding the biological significance of lyso-PC-triggered induction of NOS-III. It is well established that both in experimental models of atherosclerosis (44Verbeuren T.J. Jordaens F.H. Zonnekeyn L.L. Van Hove C.E. Coene M.C. Herman A.G. Circ.

It has also been convincingly demonstrated by several laboratories that in vitro incubation of isolated blood vessels with oxidized LDL leads to the impairment of endothelium-dependent relaxation similar to that observed in atherosclerotic vessels(52Jacobs M. Plane F. Bruckdorfer K.R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1990; 100: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 53Tanner F.C. Noll G. Boulanger C.M. Luscher T.F.

Commun. 1990; 168: 301-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Lyso-PC has been identified as the critical diffusible component of oxidized LDL that is responsible for a rapid inhibition of endothelium-dependent relaxation by oxidized LDL(54Kugiyama K. Kerns S.A. Morrisett J.D. Roberts R. Henry P.D. Nature. 1990; 344: 160-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar, 55Yokoyama M. Hirata K. Miyake R. Akita H. Ishikawa Y. Fukuzaki H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 168: 301-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). It has also been recently reported that chemically oxidized LDLs reduce NOS-III mRNA levels in human endothelial cell via destabilization of NOS-III mRNA(56Liao J.K. Shin W.S. Lee W.Y. Clark S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 319-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Thus, in the context of the studies summarized above, augmentation of endothelial expression and activity of NOS-III by lyso-PC comes as a surprise and may at first appear to be contradictory. However, a careful analysis demonstrates that these results are not necessary conflicting. It should be emphasized that the reduction of endothelium-dependent relaxation in isolated vessel can be due to factors other then the reduction of endothelial capacity to synthesize NO. For instance, the impairment of endothelium-dependent relaxation could be caused by the reduction of the half-life of NO in atherosclerotic vessels. Indeed, oxidized LDLs have been demonstrated to reduce the half-life of NO in vitro(57Galle J. Mulsch A. Busse R. Bassenge E. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1991; 11: 198-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 58Chin J.H. Azhar S. Hoffman B.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 10-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar), and both hypercholesterolemia in experimental animals (59Ohara Y. Peterson T.E. Harrison D.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 2546-2551Crossref PubMed Scopus (1656) Google Scholar) and lyso-PC in isolated blood vessels (60Ohara Y. Peterson T.E. Zheng B. Kuo J.F. Harrison D.G. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 1007-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) reduce the half-life of NO via induction of superoxide anion generation. Importantly, intimal thickening, which is a typical characteristic of atherosclerotic vessels, can be expected to decrease the amount of endothelium-derived NO that reaches vascular smooth muscle. Thus, it is possible that the impairment of endothelium-dependent relaxation and the augmentation of endothelial synthesis of NO co-exist. In this context, it is of interest that the release of NO measured by a chemiluminescent technique is increased in aortas from hypercholesterolemic rabbits (61). Recently, enhancement of the release of NO from cultured rabbit endothelial cells by oxidized LDL has been reported(62Fries D.M. Penha R.G. D'Amico E.A. Abdalla D.S. Monteiro H.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 207: 231-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Moreover, intensive staining for NOS-III has been observed in atherosclerotic vessels(5Forstermann U. Closs E.I. Pollock J.S. Nakane M. Schwarz P. Gath I. Kleinert H. Hypertension. 1994; 23: 1121-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the same paper that demonstrated that chemically oxidized LDLs decrease NOS-III mRNA levels via reduction of NOS mRNA half-life (56Liao J.K. Shin W.S. Lee W.Y. Clark S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 319-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar) also showed data demonstrating that oxidized LDLs double the NOS-III transcription rate. In the same paper, although not discussed in detail by the authors, results were presented that showed that the incubation of native LDL with endothelial cells, which results in oxidative modification of LDL, evidenced by increased content of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, results in the enhancement of NOS-III mRNA levels. Thus, it is tempting to speculate that the increase of NOS-III mRNA levels by endothelial cell-oxidized LDL and the augmentation of the NOS-III transcription rate by chemically oxidized LDL may be due to lyso-PC-induced activation of the NOS-III gene. It is possible that chemically modified LDL has additional effects on endothelial cells that cause destabilization of NOS-III mRNA. As outlined in detail in the Introduction, lyso-PC causes induction of several potentially pro-atherogenic endothelial genes involved in leukocyte recruitment, mitogenesis, and inflammation(27Kume N. Cybulsky M.I. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1138-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar, 28Kume N. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 907-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Our findings add another inducible protein to this growing list. However, this may be an important addition, as in contrast to other genes showed to be induced by lyso-PC so far, the biological actions of endothelium derived NO suggest that NOS-III is a key vasoprotective gene. These findings are intriguing because they introduce a novel idea that a single molecule can induce both pro-atherogenic and vasoprotective mechanisms. The attractiveness of this hypothesis stems from the fact that it may help to rationalize several poorly understood issues concerning atherogenesis. Induction of both pro-atherogenic and vasoprotective mechanisms may explain a long time course of atherosclerotic lesions development. This may also explain the potential of early atherosclerotic lesions to regress after removing of initiating environmental factors. We acknowledge, however, that further work, beyond the limitations of the present study, is required to verify the significance of lyso-PC-induced activation of the NOS-III gene in the proper pathophysiological setting. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that lyso-PC enhances expression of NOS-III in HUVEC by a transcriptional mechanism. Induction of NOS-III by lyso-PC may be a protective response that limits the progress of the atherosclerotic lesion and promotes its regression. We thank D.

https://openalex.org/W2055734649,"In the developing nervous system, motor axons grow away from the ventral midline floor plate, suggesting that the latter might be a source of repulsive axonal guidance cues. In donor to host transplantation experiments, ectopic pieces of floor plate were positioned between chick hindbrain motor neurons and their exit points. Immunohistochemistry and retrograde axonal labeling techniques demonstrated that motor axons diverted from their normal pathways to avoid grafted floor plate, often traversing abnormally long circuitous trajectories to reach exit points. When ventral explants of rat hindbrain and spinal cord were cocultured at a distance from floor plate explants within collagen gel matrices, the outgrowth of motor axons was dramatically reduced from explant borders that faced the floor plate. Thus, the floor plate secretes diffusible repulsive cues in vitro that may exclude motor axons from the midline during development."

From an evolutionary viewpoint, evidence indicates that the NO transduction signaling pathway is operative only in higher eukaryotic organisms. The present studies provide the first demonstration that this pathway is also present in the lower eukaryotic organism Trypanosoma cruzi, the ethiological agent of the Chagas' disease. The existence of Ca2+-stimulated NO synthase, a nitroprusside-activated guanylyl cyclase, as well as NMDA receptors in epimastigote forms of the parasite is demonstrated. In addition, evidence indicating that L-arginine and NMDA increase NO production and cyclic GMP levels in epimastigote cells is also presented.

Amino acid analogs were purchased from Research Biochemicals Inc. Components of the T. cruzi growth medium were obtained from Difco, and AG50WX-8 resin was obtained from Bio-Rad. Other reagents were purchased from Sigma. T. cruzi epimastigote forms (Tulahuen 2 strain) were cultured 7 days at 28°C in a medium containing (per liter) Bacto Liver (35 g), tryptose (10 g), yeast extract (3 g), glucose (5 g), Na2HPO4 (8 g), NaCl (4 g), KCl (0.4 g), and hemine (20 mg)(15Wynne de Martini G.J. Abramo Orrego L. De Rissio A.M. Alvarez M. Mujicam L.P. Medicina (Buenos Aires). 1980; 40: 109-114PubMed Google Scholar). The pH was adjusted to 7.8. All the components of this medium were autoclaved 15 min at 118°C. Standing cultures were carried out 7 days at 28°C up to the late-exponential phase in 1-liter Erlenmeyer flasks containing 100 ml of medium. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 1000 × g, washed three times with 0.25 M sucrose containing 5 mM KCl, and homogenized in the same solution (10 ml g-1 of wet cells) with a Sorvall Ribi press operated at 34.5 megapascal (5000 lb/in-1) under a N2 atmosphere. After cell homogenization, the extract was centrifuged 15 min at 1000 × g. The membrane pellet was resuspended in 0.25 M sucrose containing 5 mM KCl and layered onto a discontinuous gradient containing 1.58, 1.90, and 2.20 M sucrose. After centrifugation in a Beckman SW-40 rotor for 60 min at 90,000 × g, membranes were recovered from the interface of 1.58 and 1.90 M sucrose and stored at −70°C. After homogenization, cell debris was discarded by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant fluid, adjusted to 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 25 units ml-1 aprotinin, 0.01% leupeptin (w:v), and 0.2 mg ml-1 soybean trypsin inhibitor, was further centrifuged 60 min at 105,000 × g. The supernatant fluid, referred to as “soluble crude extract,” was immediately processed to avoid proteolytic degradation. The soluble crude extract (25 ml) was loaded onto a DEAE-cellulose column (1 × 10 cm) equilibrated with 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 25 units ml-1 aprotinin (buffer A). The column was then washed with 50 ml of buffer A and eluted with 100 ml of a linear gradient of 0-400 mM NaCl in buffer A. Fractions of 2 ml were collected. The NO synthase activity peak (6 ml) was mixed with 1 ml of 2’5’-ADP-agarose slurry equilibrated with 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer containing 1 mM EDTA and 5 mM mercaptoethanol (buffer B). The mixture was shaken 12 h at 4°C. The slurry was then poured into a column assembled in a Pasteur pipette and washed with 25 ml of buffer B containing 0.5 M NaCl followed by 10 ml of buffer B. The column was then eluted with 3 ml of buffer B supplemented with 10 mM NADPH. Enzyme activity was measured by following the conversion of L-[3H]arginine to [3H]citrulline according to the procedure described by Bredt and Snyder(16Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9030-9033Crossref PubMed Scopus (1749) Google Scholar). Incubation mixtures contained 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, 1 μML-[3H]arginine (0.2 μCi per assay), 0.1 mM CaCl2, 10 μM tetrahydrobiopterin, 1 μM FAD, 1 μM NADPH, 1 mM dithiotreitol, and 10 μg/ml bovine brain calmodulin in a total volume of 0.1 ml. Incubations were performed 2 min at 25°C and stopped by the addition of 2 ml of ice-cold 20 mM Hepes buffer, pH 5.5, containing 1 mM EDTA. Samples were immediately applied to 2-ml columns of AG50WX-8 resin (Na+ form) and washed with 2 ml of water. Percolate plus wash from each column (4 ml) was mixed with 12.5 ml of Bray's scintillation mixture and counted for radioactivity. Enzyme activity was proportional to incubation time for the first 2 min, as well as to the amount of soluble crude extract protein up to 1 μg per assay. The authenticity of the radioactive citrulline formed during the reaction was ascertained by comigration with a citrulline standard on a silica gel 60 plate developed with CHCl3/MeOH/NH4OH/H2O (1:4:2:1; vol:vol) according to Iyengar et al.(17Iyengar R. Stuehr D.J. Marletta M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6369-6373Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, no other radioactive product was detected. T. cruzi epimastigotes were resuspended in Krebs-Henseleit medium, and aliquots (1 ml, about 107 cells) were incubated 45 min at 28°C in the presence of 1 μML-[3H]arginine (1 μCi per assay). After the addition of the indicated amino acid derivative, incubation was continued for 15 min. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 0.1 ml of ice-cold 70% trichloroacetic acid (w:v). After three cycles of freeze-thawing, mixtures were centrifuged 10 min at 1000 × g, and the supernatant solutions were extracted 4 times with 4 ml of diethyl ether to eliminate trichloroacetic acid. Aliquots (0.2 ml) of the aqueous phases were then mixed with 2 ml of 20 mM Hepes-NaOH buffer, pH 6.0, and purified by passage through AG50WX8 columns as described above. NO generation by epimastigote cultures was monitored by the formation of NO2¯ using the Griess reagent, as described by Bredt and Snyder(16Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9030-9033Crossref PubMed Scopus (1749) Google Scholar). In this case, concentration of L-arginine was 1 mM. Incubations of epimastigote cells were performed as described above for 3 min in the presence of the indicated excitatory amino acid. Reactions were then stopped and processed according to this procedure. After extraction with diethyl ether, samples were subjected to acetylation and assayed for cyclic GMP using a radioimmunoassay kit (DuPont NEN) following the instructions of the manufacturer. Enzyme activity was assayed following the conversion of [α-32P]GTP to 32P-labeled cyclic GMP. Incubation mixtures contained 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, 0.1 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 1 mM cyclic GMP, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM [α-32P]GTP (specific activity, 200 cpm/pmol), 2 mM phosphocreatine, 0.2 mg of creatine kinase, and appropriate volumes of the enzyme preparation. Assays were performed in the presence or absence of 0.1 mM sodium nitroprusside in a total volume of 0.1 ml. Incubations were performed 5 min at 30°C on triplicate samples. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 0.1 ml of a solution containing 10 mM3H-labeled cyclic GMP (1500 cpm/mmol) followed by boiling for 2 min. Cyclic GMP was purified and counted for radioactivity as described by Birnbaumer et al. (18Birnbaumer L. Torres H.N. Flawiá M.M. Fricke R.F. Anal.

Incubation mixtures for the binding assay contained 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, 10 nM to 100 μM3H-labeled ligand (MK-801 or CPP), and approximately 50 μg of membrane protein or 108 epimastigote cells in a final volume of 0.1 ml. Incubations were performed 90 min at room temperature. The bound peptide was separated by filtration through nitrocellulose disks (Schleicher & Schuell, BA-85). Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 0.1 mM unlabeled ligand. Binding constants were calculated according to Cuatrecasas and Hollenberg(19Cuatrecasas P. Hollenberg M.D. Adv. Protein Chem. 1976; 30: 251-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). A soluble NO synthase activity was purified and characterized from cell-free extracts of T. cruzi epimastigotes. The purification protocol, which included ion exchange chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and affinity chromatography on ADP-agarose, was similar to the one employed for the purification of the rat cerebellum enzyme (20Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (3123) Google Scholar). As a result of these steps, enzyme activity was purified about 2000-fold (Table I). NO synthase specific activity in epimastigote soluble extracts was in the same order of magnitude as that found for cerebral tissue(20Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (3123) Google Scholar).Table I:Purification of NO synthase from T. cruzi epimastigotesNO synthase activity was assayed in triplicate samples by following the conversion of L-[3H]arginine to [3H]citrulline as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab NO synthase activity was assayed in triplicate samples by following the conversion of L-[3H]arginine to [3H]citrulline as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Addition of protease inhibitors to the crude extracts is absolutely necessary to preserve NO synthase activity. The high proteolytic activity, which is characteristic of these extracts, might explain the 5-fold difference in total activity observed between the two first steps of purification (Table I). Under the assay conditions described by Bredt and Snyder (16Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9030-9033Crossref PubMed Scopus (1749) Google Scholar) for neural tissues, conversion of [3H]arginine to [3H]citrulline by the purified T. cruzi enzyme required NADPH and was blocked by EGTA. Reaction could be stimulated by calmodulin, tetrahydrobiopterin, flavin adenine dinucleotide, and flavin adenine mononucleotide (Table II). This NO synthase activity was also blocked by Nω-monomethyl-L-arginine; half-maximal inhibition was observed at about 40 μM of this amino acid derivative. Most of these properties are very similar to those of the neural synthase(20Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (3123) Google Scholar).Table II:Factors affecting T. cruzi NO synthase activityAssay conditions were as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Standard errors of the means are indicated. Student's t test was used to compare values corresponding to each group (addition or omission) versus to the control (none). p values were <0.01 versus control. Open table in a new tab Assay conditions were as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Standard errors of the means are indicated. Student's t test was used to compare values corresponding to each group (addition or omission) versus to the control (none). p values were <0.01 versus control. Table III shows that in epimastigote cells, conversion of L-[3H]arginine to [3H]citrulline is stimulated by L-glutamate and by NMDA. The stimulation was effectively blocked by EGTA and non-competitive NMDA antagonists such as MK-801 and ketamine(21Wong E.H.F. Kemp J.A. Priestley T. Knight A.R. Woodruff G.N. Iversen L.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 7104-7108Crossref PubMed Scopus (1678) Google Scholar). AP-5, which has been described as a competitive L-glutamate antagonist(22Olverman H.J. Jones A.W. Watkins J.C. Nature. 1984; 307: 460-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), slightly decreased the effects of this amino acid and NMDA. On the other hand, glycine, which has been reported to be a potentiator of L-glutamate responses at the level of the NMDA receptor(23Johnson J.W. Ascher P. Nature. 1987; 325: 529-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (2619) Google Scholar), enhanced the L-glutamate effect.Table III:Modulation by amino acid derivatives of the conversion of L-[3H]arginine to [3H]citrulline by T. cruzi epimastigote cellsAssays were performed in triplicate samples as described under “Experimental Procedures.” p < 0.01 for 0.1 or 1.0 mML-glutamate or 0.1 mM NMDA versus the control; p < 0.05 for glutamate plus MK-801 (or ketamine or AP5 or glycine) versus control; p < 0.05 for NMDA plus EGTA (or MK-801 or ketamine or AP-5) versus control. Open table in a new tab Assays were performed in triplicate samples as described under “Experimental Procedures.” p < 0.01 for 0.1 or 1.0 mML-glutamate or 0.1 mM NMDA versus the control; p < 0.05 for glutamate plus MK-801 (or ketamine or AP5 or glycine) versus control; p < 0.05 for NMDA plus EGTA (or MK-801 or ketamine or AP-5) versus control. The effect of excitatory amino acids was also studied by monitoring the concentration of NO in the incubation medium as accumulation of NO2¯. As shown in Table IV, 1 mML-arginine slightly stimulated NO production. Under such conditions, L-glutamate and NMDA efficiently increased NO2¯ accumulation.Table IV:Effects of L-arginine and excitatory amino acids on NO production by epimastigote cellsAssays were performed as in Table III, except that 1 mML-arginine was used instead of the labeled amino acid, and NO generation was measured by accumulation of NO2¯ in the medium. p < 0.01 for arginine versus control or for arginine plus glutamate (or NMDA) versus arginine. Open table in a new tab Assays were performed as in Table III, except that 1 mML-arginine was used instead of the labeled amino acid, and NO generation was measured by accumulation of NO2¯ in the medium. p < 0.01 for arginine versus control or for arginine plus glutamate (or NMDA) versus arginine. Guanylyl cyclase activity was detected in cell-free preparations from T. cruzi epimastigotes. Enzyme specific activity in the soluble crude extract was about 1-2 pmol/min/mg protein. Specific activity increased approximately 5-fold in the presence of 0.1 mM sodium nitroprusside, which acts as a NO donor. The effects of amino acids and sodium nitroprusside on cyclic GMP levels was studied in T. cruzi epimastigote cells. As shown in Table V, glutamate and NMDA were the most potent agents in increasing such levels. Sodium nitroprusside had a slightly smaller effect, while L-arginine alone was much less active.Table V:Influence of amino acids and sodium nitroprusside on cyclic GMP levels in T. cruzi epimastigotesAssays were performed in triplicates on duplicate samples as indicated under “Experimental Procedures.” p < 0.05 for 0.1 mM arginine versus control; p < 0.01 for 1.0 mM arginine or nitroprusside or NMDA or glutamate versus control. Open table in a new tab Assays were performed in triplicates on duplicate samples as indicated under “Experimental Procedures.” p < 0.05 for 0.1 mM arginine versus control; p < 0.01 for 1.0 mM arginine or nitroprusside or NMDA or glutamate versus control. [3H]MK-801 bound specifically to T. cruzi epimastigote cells and membranes. Binding could be displaced 95% by 0.1 mM unlabeled MK-801 or ketamide. Displacement studies of the labeled ligand by the unlabeled compound gave an estimated dissociation constant of 7 × 10-9M and about 104 receptors per cell. As shown in Table VI, [3H]MK-801 binding was strongly enhanced by glycine and L-serine and only slightly by L-glutamate.Table VI:Modulation of [3H]MK-801 binding in epimastigote membranes by amino acidsConditions were described under “Experimental Procedures.” p < 0.01 for glycine or serine (with or without glutamate) versus control. Open table in a new tab Conditions were described under “Experimental Procedures.” p < 0.01 for glycine or serine (with or without glutamate) versus control. The binding of [3H]CPP to epimastigote cells or membranes was also determined. The compound bound poorly and nonspecifically, making it impossible to determine any binding parameter. Results reported in this article show that T. cruzi epimastigotes have a NO synthase activity similar to that previously described for mammalian endothelium and nervous tissue(6Bredt D.S. Ferris C.D.

Enzymes from these tissues show Ca2+ and calmodulin dependence. Some of the excitatory amino acids, well known to affect the conversion of L-arginine to citrulline and NO in neural tissue, also influence the T. cruzi NO synthase in vivo. Remarkable stimulatory effects of L-glutamate and NMDA could be observed in epimastigote cells, suggesting that T. cruzi epimastigotes have L-glutamate (NMDA) receptors of the type described for nervous tissue(13Foster A.C. Fragg G.E. Brain Res. Rev. 1984; 7: 103-164Crossref Scopus (675) Google Scholar). As occurs in neural cells, T. cruzi NMDA receptors should be major entities controlling cytosolic Ca2+ levels. A well known feature of neural NMDA receptors is also found in T. cruzi epimastigote membrane receptors. This is the [3H]MK-801 binding capacity, strongly enhanced by glycine and L-serine. It has been postulated that [3H]MK-801 binds within the ion channel of the NMDA receptor(25Vincendeau P. Daulouede S. Veyret B. Darle M.L. Boutille B. Lemesre J.L. Exp. Parasitol. 1992; 75: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the failure to detect specific binding at the level of the L-glutamate-NMDA site in the receptor may be attributable to the usually very low affinity of this site for ligands such as L-glutamate, NMDA, CPP, or AP-5 (24Murphy D.E. Schneider J. Boehm C. Lehman J. Williams M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1987; 240: 778-784PubMed Google Scholar). The NO pathway, controlled through NMDA receptors in neural cells, possesses a heme-containing soluble guanylyl cyclase as its effector. This enzyme can be activated by sodium nitroprusside through the generation of NO(3Kimura H. Mittal C.K. Murad F. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 8016-8022Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Waldman S.A. Murad F. Pharmacol. Rev. 1987; 39: 163-196PubMed Google Scholar). This also seems to be the case of T. cruzi epimastigotes, since NMDA and excitatory amino acids such as L-glutamate, which activate NO synthase in vivo, also increase intracellular levels of cyclic GMP in epimastigote cells. It is known that NO generated by macrophages is cytostatic or cytotoxic for a variety of pathogens, including Trypanosoma brucei and T. cruzi.(25Vincendeau P. Daulouede S. Veyret B. Darle M.L. Boutille B. Lemesre J.L. Exp. Parasitol. 1992; 75: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 26Gazzinelli R.T. Oswald I.P. Hienry S. James S.L. Sher A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 2501-2506Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Moreover T. cruzi infection in mice increases the capacity of splenic cells to produce NO(27Vespa G.N.R. Cunha F.Q. Silva J.S. Infect. Immunol. 1994; 62: 5177-5182Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Obviously, the relationship between the two NO-generating systems in the parasite and the mammalian cell remains unknown. Finally, it is rather surprising that a neural control mechanism such as the long-term potentiation involved in memory (28Morris R.G.M. Anderson E. Lynch G. Baudry M. Nature. 1986; 319: 774-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (2775) Google Scholar) has in Trypanosomatidae such an old evolutionary precedent. Both cases involve NMDA receptors, a Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent NO synthase, and a nitroprusside-stimulated guanylyl cyclase. The effectors of such a pathway should be a cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase and unknown phosphate protein acceptors. The characteristics of these entities in T. cruzi and their cellular effects require further studies. We acknowledge Dr. Alberto R. Kornblihtt for helpful criticisms."

Antibodies specific for each subunit of the integrin alpha 8 beta 1 are used to demonstrate that alpha 8 beta 1 mediates neurite outgrowth of embryonic sensory and motor neurons on this extracellular matrix protein. In addition, expression of alpha 8 in K562 cells results in surface expression of alpha 8 beta 1 heterodimers that are shown to promote attachment of this cell line to tenascin. The major domain in tenascin that mediates neurite outgrowth is shown to be localized to fibronectin type III repeats 6-8."

These agents appear to alter the intracellular trafficking of certain protein toxins and facilitate their transport into the cytosol.

All-trans-retinoic acid was purchased from Calbiochem; brefeldin A was from Sigma; bovine seminal ribonuclease was purified from bull semen or seminal vesicles as reported(15Tamburrini M. Piccoli R.

Protein synthesis inhibition by RNases was determined as described previously(14Wu Y.N. Gadina M. Tao-Cheng J.H. Youle R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 743-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 18Wu Y. Mikulski S.M. Ardelt W. Rybak S.M. Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10686-10693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells in 100 εl were plated at concentrations of 2 × 105 cells/ml in 96-well microtiter plates overnight in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's complete medium. Retinoic acid (15 mM in dimethyl sulfoxide), monensin (2 mM in ethanol), and brefeldin A (BFA, 10 mg/ml in ethanol) stock solutions were diluted into leucine-free RPMI 1640 medium without fetal calf serum to the appropriate concentrations. The same amounts of dimethyl sulfoxide and/or ethanol were added in the control solutions. After removing the complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, cells were incubated in the above leucine-free RPMI 1640 medium containing increasing concentrations of ribonucleases with or without retinoic acid or monensin and/or BFA for 16 h followed by a 1-h pulse with 0.1 εCi of [14C]leucine. Cells were harvested onto glass fiber filters using a PHD cell harvester, washed with water, dried with ethanol, and counted. The results were expressed as the percentage of [14C]leucine incorporation in mock-treated control cells. 9L cells cultured in 96-well plates were incubated with increasing concentrations of BS-RNase in leucine-free RPMI 1640 medium with or without 10 εM retinoic acid for either 6 h or 16 h. Cells were then trypsinized by adding trypsin in each well without removing the incubation medium, resuspended, mixed with trypan blue, and counted. Cell viability was calculated as the percentage of trypan blue excluding cells with respect to the total cell counts. 9L cells (1 × 106 cells/ml) cultured in 75-cm2 flasks were treated with increasing concentrations of BS-RNase in leucine-free RPMI 1640 medium with or without 10 εM retinoic acid. After 6 h, cells were trypsinized, washed, and processed for total RNA isolation using the RNAzol™ method supplied by TEL-TEST, Inc. Briefly, cells were homogenized in RNAzol™ (2 ml of RNAzol™ per 1 × 107 cells), RNA was then extracted with 0.1 volume of chloroform, precipitated with 1 volume of isopropyl alcohol, and finally washed with 75% ethanol. Total RNA was analyzed either on a 1.4% agarose gel or a polyacrylamide gel containing 7.5 M urea as described(19Saxena S.K. Ackerman E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 265: 17106-17109Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The human RNase A gene was synthesized using an Escherichia coli codon bias(20Grantham R. Gaufier C. Gouy M. Jacobzone M. Mercier R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: r43Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Twelve oligonucleotides for assembling the synthetic human ribonuclease A gene were synthesized on a Cyclone™ Plus DNA Synthesizer. After being phosphorylated with T4 kinase, these oligonucleotides were ligated together with DNA ligase. The ligated product was used as the template for amplification with the polymerase chain reaction. The amplified polymerase chain reaction product was then cloned into the PET-11d plasmid using BamHI and XbaI restriction sites and sequenced. The final sequence (Fig. 1) was that desired to generate the human pancreatic RNase protein lacking the leader sequence with an additional Met-1 residue. Human RNase A was then expressed in BL21-DE3 E. coli cells with isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside as the inducing agent. The fraction of inclusion bodies that contains the expressed protein was isolated and treated as described(21Schultz D. Baldwin R.L. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 910-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The refolded ribonuclease was then purified by ion exchange chromatography on S-Sepharose followed by size exclusion chromatography on Sephacryl S-100. The S-Sepharose column was developed with a linear sodium chloride gradient (0.35-0.5 M) in 0.15 M sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0. The main peak was collected, concentrated by ultrafiltration, and run on a Sephacryl column in 0.075 M ammonium bicarbonate. The pooled peak fractions were lyophilized. The resulting preparation was homogeneous in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. Ribonuclease activity of the recombinant (Met-1) human RNase was about 90% relative to the specific activity of bovine pancreatic RNase A. The human angiogenin cDNA gene (22Saxena S.K. Rybak S.M. Davey Jr., R.T. Youle R.J. Ackerman E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21982-21986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was cloned into the PET-11d plasmid and expressed in BL21-DE3 E. coli by induction with isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside. The expressed protein was purified using the same method as described under the purification of human ribonuclease A and was homogeneous by Coomassie staining of SDS-polyacrylamide gels. When incubated with 9L glioma cells, BS-RNase inhibited cellular protein synthesis only 30% at 1 × 10−6M (Fig. 2A). In the presence of either retinoic acid or monensin, however, the inhibition of protein synthesis reached 98% at the same concentration of BS-RNase and reached 50% at about 1 × 10−8M. Thus, these drugs increase the cytotoxicity of BS-RNase over 100-fold. BS-RNase is a disulfide-linked dimer (17D'Alessio G. Malorni M.C. Parente A.

Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 1116-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The dimer form is much more potent than the monomer in a variety of biologic activities of this protein (2D'Alessio G. Trends Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 106-109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Alkylation with ethyleneimine results in a Cys-31, Cys-32-S-ethylamine derivative (MSSR), whereas alkylation with iodoacetamide leads to a Cys-31, Cys-32-carboxymethyl monomer of BS-RNase (MCM). Neither MSSR nor MCM were toxic to 9L glioma cells within the employed concentration range (Fig. 2, B and C, respectively). However, they both were quite potent in the presence of either retinoic acid or monensin. The respective values of IC50 were 5 × 10−8M for MSSR and 1 × 10−7M for MCM. The potency of the two monomers was within one order of magnitude of the dimer in the presence of either retinoic acid or monensin. Dimerization is not essential for BS-RNase toxicity in the presence of Golgi disrupting drugs. Fig. 3 shows the cell viability compared to protein synthesis inhibition after treatment of cells with BS-RNase in the presence or absence of 10 εM retinoic acid. Although protein synthesis was inhibited by 60% after a 6-h incubation with BS-RNase in the presence of 10 εM retinoic acid, the cells remained intact as measured by trypan blue exclusion (Fig. 3A). However, incubation of the cells with BS-RNase in the presence of retinoic acid for 16 h resulted in the complete inhibition of protein synthesis and cell lysis as shown in Fig. 3B. After 16 h of treatment, no cells were lysed by BS-RNase alone at 10−6M, whereas, in the presence of retinoic acid, 90% of the cells were lysed. Thus, the potentiation of RNase inhibition of protein synthesis seen with retinoic acid effects a large decrease in cell viability. Although protein synthesis was inhibited up to 60%, cells remained intact for at least 6 h after treatment with BS-RNase in the presence of retinoic acid (Fig. 3A). We examined the status of RNA in the cells treated with BS-RNase with or without retinoic acid for 6 h (Fig. 4). There was no detectable RNA degradation in cells treated with BS-RNase up to a 100 nM concentration. At a concentration of 1.0 εM BS-RNase, 28 S and 18 S rRNA began to be degraded, whereas there was no detectable degradation of 5.8 S, 5 S, or tRNA (Fig. 4). Thus, 28 S and 18 S rRNA are the more susceptible substrates for BS-RNase than 5.8 S, 5 S rRNA, and tRNA. However, in the presence of retinoic acid, the 28 S, 18 S, 5.8 S, 5 S rRNA, and tRNA were all degraded to some extent, even at BS-RNase concentrations as low as 10 nM (Fig. 4). In retinoic acid-treated cells, RNA is degraded at concentrations of BS-RNase 100 times lower than that needed for RNA degradation in cells not exposed to retinoic acid. However, the 28 S and 18 S rRNA seem to be more susceptible to BS-RNase than 5.8 S, 5 S, and tRNA both in the presence and absence of BS-RNase. These results indicate that BS-RNase gets into cytosol more efficiently in the presence than in the absence of retinoic acid. As rRNA degradation correlates with cytotoxicity, both in the presence and absence of retinoic acid, these results substantiate the model that rRNA degradation after cytosolic entry of BS-RNase is the mechanism of BS-RNase protein synthesis inhibition. A number of proteins discovered based on a variety of biologic activities have recently been found to be homologous to RNase A and to express RNase activity (reviewed in Refs. 1, 2, and 23). We compared the cytotoxicity of different RNases with and without Golgi apparatus selective drugs. In addition to BS-RNase and its monomers, retinoic acid potentiated the cytotoxicity of Onconase, angiogenin, and human RNase A as shown in Fig. 5. Onconase is a cytotoxic ribonuclease isolated from R. pipiens eggs and early embryos based upon its anti-cancer activity both in vitro and in vivo(10Ardelt W. Mikulski S.M. Shogen K. J. Biol.

Viera A. Ardelt W.J. Menduke H. Shogen K. Cell Tissue Kinet. 1990; 23: 237-246PubMed Google Scholar). Alone, Onconase has an IC50 of 10−6M and in the presence of retinoic acid cytotoxicity increased 100-fold to around 10−8M (Fig. 5A), quite close to that of BS-RNase. Angiogenin, a ribonuclease originally purified because of its angiogenesis activity(11Fett J.W. Strydom D.J. Lobb R.R. Alderman E.M. Bethune J.L. Riordan J.F. Vallee B.L. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 5480-5486Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar), is not detectably toxic alone, but, in the presence of retinoic acid, has an IC50 of 3 × 10−6M (Fig. 5B). Recombinant human pancreatic RNase A was also more toxic with retinoic acid (Fig. 5C), yet the potency was relatively low compared to the other RNases. Although all four members of the RNase A superfamily examined were more toxic in the presence of retinoic acid, their potency varied 10,000-fold from 2 × 10−9 to 2 × 10−5M. What molecular features account for these large differences remain unknown. As shown in Table 1, Onconase ribonuclease activity is essential for its cytotoxicity. Inactivation of Onconase ribonuclease activity by 98% with iodoacetic acid abolished its cytotoxicity. Recombinant Onconase which only contains 2% of the native Onconase ribonuclease activity also lost its cytotoxicity, although the crystal structure showed that recombinant Onconase has been properly folded.3 3S. C. Mosimann and M. N. G. James, unpublished data. Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab It has been demonstrated that retinoic acid disrupts the Golgi apparatus and potentiates the cytotoxicity of ricin A chain immunotoxins(14Wu Y.N. Gadina M. Tao-Cheng J.H. Youle R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 743-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To examine whether or not retinoic acid affects the routing of RNases through the Golgi apparatus, the effect of brefeldin A (BFA) on the retinoic acid potentiation of BS-RNase and Onconase was examined (Fig. 6). BFA, by inhibiting vesicular transport from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi, results in collapse of the cis-Golgi apparatus blocking the retrograde vesicular transport of vesicles from the Golgi to the ER (27Doms R.W. Russ G. Yewdell J.W. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 28Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yuan L.C. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1989; 56: 801-813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1315) Google Scholar). BFA was incubated with 9L cells in the presence of retinoic acid and BS-RNase or Onconase. Fig. 6 shows that BFA completely blocks the potentiation of toxicity of both BS-RNase and Onconase by retinoic acid. BFA, however, has no effect on the cytotoxicity caused by Onconase and BS-RNase themselves. This indicates that BS-RNase and Onconase route through the Golgi apparatus in the presence of retinoic acid. The results also indicate that Onconase routes to the cytosol through a BFA insensitive compartment in the absence of retinoic acid. Thus, Onconase likely routes to the cytosol normally without going through the Golgi apparatus, and addition of retinoic acid alters the intracellular routing through the Golgi where Onconase accesses the cytosol 100-fold more efficiently. BS-RNase is also routed more than 100 times more efficiently through the Golgi to the cytosol in the presence than in the absence of retinoic acid. To test whether the RNase affects cell death via some signaling pathway that can be enhanced by retinoic acid through transcriptional controls, cells were incubated with actinomycin D before exposure to retinoic acid and Onconase. Table 2 showed that pretreatment with actinomycin D did not prevent the potentiation of Onconase cytotoxicity by retinoic acid. Thus, the well established transcription activation activity of retinoic acid does not appear to be the mechanism by which retinoic acid increases cell sensitivity to RNases.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Ribonucleases have potential as therapeutic agents for a number of human disorders including cancer and HIV(1Youle R.J.

Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10686-10693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). How RNases kill cells is poorly understood. It has been proposed that the mechanism of cytotoxic RNases resembles that of plant and bacterial toxins to some degree whereby the RNases bind the mammalian cell surface, enter into the cell cytosol, and degrade RNA resulting in cell death(18Wu Y. Mikulski S.M. Ardelt W. Rybak S.M. Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10686-10693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).1 How the RNases cross the membrane and enter the cytosol remains unclear. It has been demonstrated recently that retinoic acid specifically disrupts the Golgi apparatus(14Wu Y.N. Gadina M. Tao-Cheng J.H. Youle R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 743-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Golgi-specific staining with mannosidase II (28Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yuan L.C. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D.

Chem. 1986; 261: 11399-11403Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) was reduced by treating cells with 10 εM retinoic acid; after removal of the retinoic acid, the Golgi apparatus staining rapidly reappeared as normal. By electron microscopy, the Golgi apparatus appeared swollen in the presence of retinoic acid and rapidly assumed normal morphology upon removal of retinoic acid. The morphology of the Golgi apparatus under electron microscopy in the presence of retinoic acid resembled that of monensin-treated cells in contrast to NBD-ceramide staining of cells where retinoic acid-treated cells were markedly different from monensin-treated cells. Retinoic acid and monensin increase the cytotoxicity of ricin A chain immunotoxins by increasing the intracellular routing of the toxins to the cytosol(14Wu Y.N. Gadina M. Tao-Cheng J.H. Youle R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 743-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). A variety of data suggest that ricin immunotoxins route through the Golgi apparatus on the way to the cytosol. We examined the effect of retinoic acid and monensin on the cytotoxicity of a series of homologous ribonucleases. Retinoic acid and monensin increased the cytotoxicity of all four members of the ribonuclease family examined. This indicates that ribonucleases reach the cytosol after endocytosis and do not cross directly across the plasma membrane. These results also indicate that ribonucleases can reach the cytosol more efficiently when routed through a disrupted Golgi apparatus, and that, normally, transmembrane transport of the ribonucleases is rate-limiting for cytotoxicity. The sensitization of cells to ribonucleases by retinoic acid is completely blocked by BFA. BFA blocks the vesicular transport from the ER to the cis-Golgi apparatus causing a collapse of the cis-Golgi and a termination of the retrograde vesicular transport from the cis-Golgi back to the ER(27Doms R.W. Russ G. Yewdell J.W. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 28Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yuan L.C. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1989; 56: 801-813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1315) Google Scholar). The block of the retinoic acid potentiation by BFA suggests that retinoic acid stimulates transport of the ribonucleases through the cis-Golgi, possibly to the ER, en route to the cytosol. BFA has also been shown to affect endosomes, lysosomes, and the trans-Golgi network(9Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yuan L. Tipper C. Amherdt M. Orci L. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1991; 67: 601-616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar, 31Pelham H.R.B. Cell. 1991; 67: 449-451Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), and we cannot ascertain at this time which of the cellular effects of BFA cause the blockage of ribonuclease potentiation by retinoic acid. BFA, however, does not block the cytotoxicity caused by Onconase itself, indicating that the pathway through which Onconase goes to the cytosol in the absence of retinoic acid is qualitatively different from that of the retinoic acid-induced intracellular routing of ribonucleases. Previous experiments indicate that cytotoxic RNases can enter cells and cause RNA degradation to effect cell cytotoxicity and death (18Wu Y. Mikulski S.M. Ardelt W. Rybak S.M. Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10686-10693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).1 The finding that retinoic acid potentiated BS-RNase toxicity orders of magnitude allowed a further test of this hypothesis. If intracellular RNA degradation was the lesion that caused cell death, then RNA degradation in retinoic acid-treated cells should occur at orders of magnitude lower RNase concentrations, correlating with protein synthesis inhibition. BS-RNase caused 28 S and 18 S rRNA degradation only at 1.0 εM in the absence of retinoic acid, without any detectable degradation of 5.8 S, 5 S rRNA, or tRNA. In retinoic acid-treated cells, all RNA species showed some degradation at a 10 nM concentration of BS-RNase, 100 times lower than the concentration of BS-RNase needed for cells not exposed to retinoic acid. This result indicates that BS-RNase gets into the cytosol more efficiently in the presence of retinoic acid. In both retinoic acid-treated and untreated cells, 28 S and 18 S rRNA are more readily degraded by BS-RNase than 5.8 S, 5 S rRNA, or tRNA. The correlation between the degradation of cytosolic RNA by BS-RNase and cytotoxicity indicates that retinoic acid increases delivery of BS-RNase to the cytosol. It has been shown that dimerization of the bovine seminal ribonuclease is necessary for its anti-cancer activity both in cell culture and in animal models(23D'Alessio G. Di Donato A. Parente A. Piccoli R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 104-106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). However, we found that two monomers of the bovine seminal ribonuclease showed similar cytotoxicity to 9L cells in the presence of retinoic acid compared with dimerized BS-RNase. This indicates that monomer forms of bovine seminal ribonuclease cannot efficiently get into the cytosol by themselves, but, once in the cytosol, they can be almost as toxic as the dimer. Perhaps the dimer form of BS-RNase functions to route the RNase through the Golgi to effect more efficient entry into the cytosol compared to the monomer. It is interesting that the human RNase A, another monomer form of RNase that is 73% identical in sequence with BS-RNase monomer, is 300 times less toxic in the presence of retinoic acid than are the BS-RNase monomers. The reason for the large biological difference resulting from the small sequence difference may be a key to further understanding the mechanism of cytotoxicity of ribonucleases. Onconase is in clinical trials for cancer therapy(3Mikulski S.M. Grossman A.M. Carter P.W. Shogen K. Costanzi J.J. Int J. Oncol. 1993; 3: 57-64PubMed Google Scholar), and BS-RNase has interesting anti-cancer activity in animal models(7Vescia S. Tramontano D. Augusti-Tocco G. D'Alessio G. Cancer Res. 1980; 40: 3740-3744PubMed Google Scholar, 8Lacceti P. Portella G. Mastronicola M.R. Russo A. Piccoli R. D'Alessio G. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 4582-4586PubMed Google Scholar). Retinoic acid is also in several experimental trials for cancer therapy. Retinoic acid caused potentiation of BS-RNase cytotoxicity results in greater protein synthesis inhibition and cell death than in the absence of retinoic acid. Combination of RNases and retinoic acid in vivo may improve the clinical utility of ribonucleases. After completion of this manuscript, an interesting study of BS-RNase toxicity was published (32Kim J.S. Souček J. Matoušek J. Raines R.T. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2015500962,"Transient phosphorylation of histidine characterizes the two-component systems in prokaryotes that control important physiological functions, but analogous events have not been implicated in signal transduction in mammalian cells. To explore histidine phosphorylation during activation of human cells, stimulated platelets were analyzed for the formation of protein phosphohistidine in a model system employing P-selectin. P-selectin, a leukocyte adhesion molecule, undergoes rapid phosphorylation and selective dephosphorylation of tyrosine, serine, and threonine. We now establish that phosphorylation following platelet activation with thrombin or collagen generates phosphohistidine at histidines on the cytoplasmic tail of P-selectin. With thrombin stimulation, the kinetics of phosphohistidine appearance and disappearance of P-selectin are very rapid. Platelets exhibit a novel ligand-induced signaling pathway to generate phosphohistidine. These results provide direct biochemical evidence for the induction of rapid and reversible histidine phosphorylation in mammalian cells upon cell activation and represent a novel paradigm for mammalian cell signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2043811492,"In neurons, tubulin is synthesized only in the cell body or dendrites, yet the growing axon requires a steady supply of this protein at the growth cone. Hence, some mechanism must exist to move tubulin from the cell body to the growth cone. Transport could conceivably occur by simple diffusion, translocation of polymer, or some form of monomer or oligomer transport. Evidence for all these has been presented in a variety of experimental systems. We have directly studied the movement of microtubules in 12 growing axons in live grasshopper Ti1 neurons in their natural environment by labeling the polymer with a caged fluorophore, biscaged fluorescein. No evidence of polymer transport was found. Hence, tubulin movement in these neurons must occur by movement of monomeric tubulin, either by transport or diffusion. To resolve these conflicting views, we discuss the conditions under which diffusion is feasible as a transport mechanism."

We showed that the whole surface of the plasma membranes from this highly water permeable FC is covered by a regular array of membrane particles, and that the major constituent of FC purified membranes is a 25,000-dalton hydrophobic polypeptide (P25) (17Hubert J.-F. Thomas D. Cavalier A. Gouranton J. Biol. Cell. 1989; 66: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Finally, we demonstrated that FC is highly enriched in mRNA species encoding water channel proteins when microinjected into Xenopus oocytes(18Guillam M.-T. Beuron F. Grandin N. Hubert J.-F. Boisseau C. Cavalier A. Couturier A. Gouranton J. Thomas D. Exp.

As a result of its extremely high representation in the plasma membranes, it appears very likely that P25 takes an important part in the constitution of the regular array within the native membranes and is involved in the water transport function of the FC epithelia. We hypothesized that it could be a water specialized channel and thus belongs to the MIP family as all other previously characterized water channels do. Beside functional studies of P25, we focused our work on cloning the cDNA encoding P25 associated with its structural determination. In the first part of this work we demonstrate that the polypeptide P25 is a member of the MIP family. It was therefore interesting to investigate the structural organization of P25 in order to compare our observations with data relative to the structure of two previously characterized MIP proteins: MIP26 and AQP1 (CHIP). Due to its abundance in the native membranes, P25 constitutes two-dimensional crystals. This unique distribution for a MIP family protein is very favorable for a structural investigation since native membranes can be used directly for negative staining or cryoelectron microscopy. We report, in the second part of this work, the native structural organization of P25. Insects, C. viridis, were harvested from wet meadows from summer to autumn. After dissection, freshly collected filter chambers were homogenized in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, 0.4 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Membranes were purified over a discontinuous sucrose gradient as described(17Hubert J.-F. Thomas D. Cavalier A. Gouranton J. Biol. Cell. 1989; 66: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The membrane fraction was then washed 18 h at 4°C in an alkaline buffer (5 mM glycine, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol) to eliminate the extrinsic proteins(19Marchesi S.I. Steers E. Marchesi V.T. Tillack T.W. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 50-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic analysis of membrane proteins were performed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels according to Laemmli(20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). Gels were stained with silver nitrate(21Sammons D.W. Adams L.D. Nishizama D.N. Electrophoresis. 1981; 2: 135Crossref Scopus (465) Google Scholar). For Western blotting studies, proteins were electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose, incubated with rabbit antisera, and revealed by peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG. Anti-P25 serum was used with a 1000-fold dilution and antipeptide serum was used with 40- and 100-fold dilutions. Purified P25 protein was also dotted on nitrocellulose in detergent solution and subsequently revealed as in Western blotting. Frozen C. viridis, stored at −70°C were embedded in historesine, and then plunged in liquid nitrogen-cooled isopentane. Cryostat sections of 16 μm were obtained at −25°C, they were then deposited on slides treated with 2% 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane in acetone. After 4 h, sections were fixed for 5 min with a solution of 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.05% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer then rinsed with the same buffer. For labeling, sections were treated for 30 min with PAS (0.02 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 0.03% saponin), then with 1% BSA in PAS. They were incubated for 2 h at 37°C in a solution of anti-P25 serum diluted 500-fold in BSA-PAS. Sections were then washed with PAS and incubated for 30 min at 37°C in a solution of GAR/IgG/fluorescein isothiocyanate diluted 20-fold in BSA-PAS. After washing in a solution of Evan's Blue-phosphate buffer, preparations were mounted in a solution of Evan's Blue glycerol phosphate buffer. Observations were carried out with a fluorescent light microscope. Filter chambers were fixed for 4 h in a solution of 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.01% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer saline (PBS). After rinsing, samples were dehydrated and embedded in Lowicryl according to Roth et al.(22Roth J. Bendayan M. Carlemalm E. Villiger W. Garavito M. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1981; 29: 663-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Ultrathin sections were picked up on collodion carbon-coated nickel grids then immediately deposited on a solution of 1% BSA in PBS and incubated overnight at 4°C. Sections were then incubated for 2 h at room temperature with primary antibody diluted 300-fold in PBS-BSA, rinsed 3 times with PBS-BSA, and incubated 1 h at room temperature with a 10-nm GAR-gold secondary antibody diluted 40-fold in PBS-BSA. After washing, grids were stained with 2% uranyl acetate. Alternatively, freshly isolated membranes were deposited on glow-discharged carbon-coated nickel grids and incubated in the same solutions as for sections, 1 h at room temperature. After rinsing, the grids were fixed on a drop of 2.5% glutaraldehyde for 5 min, then negatively stained with 2% uranyl acetate. A pair of degenerate primers (sense, 5′-ATC AAC CC(AGTC) GCC GT(AGCT) ACC-3′, and antisense, 5-′CAG (AGCT)GA (GCA)CG GGC (AGCT)GG GTT-3′) were designed according to the two highly conserved NPA boxes found in cloned MIP family proteins. Total RNA was isolated by tissue homogenization in a lithium chloride-urea solution (23Auffray C. Rougeon F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 107: 303-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (2084) Google Scholar) followed by phenol extraction and alcohol precipitation. RNA was reverse transcribed using random hexamers as primers (Life Technologies, Inc.). 100 ng of cDNA were used as template for PCR amplification (94°C, 1 min; 35°C, 1 min; 72°C, 1 min; 35 cycles) using 100 pmol of degenerated primers and 1.75 mM MgCl2. The PCR products were resolved on 1.8% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. The PCR products were cloned in pBluescript (Stratagene) vector and sequenced by the double-strand dideoxynucleotide termination method (Pharmacia kit). Digestive tracts of C. viridis were frozen in liquid nitrogen. 10-μm sections were realized with a cryostat and mounted onto coated glass slides. Sections were dried for 2 h at room temperature and treated for 5 min with saline buffer, 5 min with Tris-HCl (10 mM), EDTA (1 mM), pH 7.6, and 15 min in the same buffer with 1 μg/ml proteinase K at 37°C. Sections were then fixed for 5 min with a solution of 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.1% glutaraldehyde, rinsed with PBS, dehydrated with successive gradated alcohol baths, then dried under vacuum. Hybridization was performed for 16 h at 50°C. The hybridization medium was as following: 50% formamide, 4 × SSC, 10% dextran sulfate, 1 × Denhardt's solution, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mg/ml yeast tRNA, and 0.1 mg/ml salmon DNA. α-35S-UTP-labeled RNA probes were prepared after linearization by SmaI for antisense or by HindIII for sense, of the pBluescript vector containing the cic insert. Transcription by 2.5 units of T7 RNA polymerase for antisense probe or T3 for sense probe was performed in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.25, 6 mM MgCl2, 2 mM spermidine, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 40 units of RNasin, for 1 h at 37°C. Plasmid DNA was eliminated by a 15-min incubation in 1 unit of DNase I. Probes were precipitated and dissolved in hybridization buffer at 2 × 106 cpm/ml. Following hybridization, slides were rinsed for 1 h at room temperature with 2 × SSC, 50% formamide, then 1 h in 1 × SSC, 1 h at 37°C in 20 μg/ml RNase, 0.5 × SSC for 1 h and 45 min at 45°C, and then 0.5 × SSC for 15 min at room temperature. Slides were then dehydrated and covered with an autoradiographic emulsion. Exposure time was 14 days at 4°C. A peptide RVQGHSLYDESRPRC from the cic deduced amino acid sequence was synthesized. Rabbits were immunized by a first injection of the coupled peptide in complete Freund's adjuvant followed by 5 boosts at 3-week intervals in incomplete Freund's adjuvant. Preimmune or immune sera were assayed for reactivity with homogenates of whole filter chambers or with chromatographically purified P25 polypeptide. Membranes were incubated in 1% Triton X-100, 10 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4, for 12 h at 4°C or in 2% n-octyl-β-D-glucopyranoside (OG), 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, at room temperature for 2 h. Insoluble material was eliminated by a 105,000 × g centrifugation for 1 h at 4°C. Stokes radius of protein-detergent complexes were obtained by gel filtration. Aliquots of 20 μl, containing 1-2 μg of membrane proteins were chromatographed at room temperature on a AcA 34 UltroGel column (when OG was used) or on a Protein Pack SW300 HPLC column (with the Triton X-100) calibrated with protein markers of known Stokes radius. Elutions were performed in a 10 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4, containing either 1% Triton X-100 or 2% OG. Fractions were collected and their content analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Linear 2-20% (w/v) sucrose density gradients were prepared from 2 and 20% stock solution of sucrose in H2O or D2O (98%) containing 10 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100 or 2% OG. 100-μl samples were layered on top of gradients and ultracentrifugation to equilibrium was performed for 18 h at 4°C at 100,000 × g. Calibration curves for the determination of the apparent sedimentation coefficient were constructed using cytochrome c (s20,w = 1.17 S), bovine serum albumin (s20,w = 4.6 S), and IgG (s20,w = 9 S) as protein markers. After centrifugation, 20 fractions were collected from the bottom of each gradient. Protein content was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. All calculations were performed as described by Sadler et al.(24Sadler J.E. Rearick J. Paulson J. Hill R. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4434-4442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular weight of the protein detergent complexes were calculated using the following Mr = [6 · Π · n · n20,w/(1−υ · ρ20,w) ]S20,wRS(Eq. 1) Where n is Avogadro's number, η20,w is the viscosity of water at 20°C (0.01002 g/(cm•s)), and ρ20,w is the density of water at 20°C (0.99823 g/ml). Stokes radius (Rs) were deduced from the calibration of chromatography column and s20,w from the calibration of H2O sucrose gradient. v, the partial specific volume of detergent protein micelles was calculated from data obtained by H2O and D2O gradient sedimentation. Values of v = 0.940 and v = 0.801 cm3/g were used for Triton X-100 and OG, respectively (4Smith B.L. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6407-6415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Clarke S. J. Biol Chem. 1975; 250: 5459-5469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The partial specific volume of the peptide moiety was assumed to be 0.735 cm3/g(26Martin R. Ames B. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 1372-1379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Aliquots of membranes in buffer (5 μl) were applied to freshly glow-discharged 400-mesh collodion/carbon-coated grids and allowed to stand for 1 min. Grids were then quickly blotted, briefly rinsed with distilled water, and deposited on a 2% uranyl acetate drop. Excess stain was removed by blotting with filter paper and grids were then air-dried. Grids were observed with a Philips CM12 microscope operating at 80 kV. Approximately 10 μl of membrane suspension were placed on a copper grid coated with a holey carbon film freshly glow-discharged, blotted quickly with filter paper, and then plunged by a quick release mechanism into liquid ethane. The frozen grid was transferred to a Gatan cryoholder in a Philips CM12 microscope operating at 100 kV, the specimen was maintained below −160°C throughout the observations. On-line digital recording of pictures was carried out using a high resolution video camera CF 1500 ELCA (Sofretec, Bezons, France) linked to a microcomputer fitted with a digital acquisition card. Images of 512 × 512 pixels were integrated for 6 s on a 16 bit frame memory and saved as 256 gray levels image files. The image sampling was of 0.8 nm on the specimen scale and the electron dose was 25 e−/Å2. Corrections for dark current and uneven illumination were done by software(27Jericevic Z. Wiese B. Bryan J. Smith J.C. Methods Cell Biol. 1989; 30: 47-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Mass measurements were performed with the STEM at IGBMC in Strasbourg (France), using a Vacuum Generator HB5 microscope operating at 100 kV equipped with a cold-field emission gun and a dark-field annulus detector. All the observations were made at −130°C using a specially designed cold stage(28Homo J.-C. Electron Microsc. 1980; 1: 92Google Scholar). Dark-field images were recorded directly in digital form using the signal from the annular dark-field detector. Drops of membrane suspension were adsorbed to carbon film mounted on a microscope grid and allowed to stand for 2 min. Tobacco mosaic virus was added as an internal mass standard and the grid was washed 4 times with double distilled water. The grid was blotted to leave only a thin layer of fluid and immediately immersed in liquid N2. Freeze drying was carried out within the microscope for 2 h at −80°C. Processing of digitized images of the particle arrays of filter chambers membranes was achieved using the SPIDER software system(29Frank J. Shimkin B. Dowse H. Ultramicroscopy. 1981; 6: 343-358Crossref Google Scholar), running on SUN UNIX workstations. From a raw image, a suitable area was selected interactively on the image display and padded into a square field of 512 × 512 pixels. In order to calculate an initial reference image, the Fourier transform and power spectrum were calculated and the diffraction pattern indexed. The indexing was used to calculate a Fourier filter mask that was applied to the Fourier transform to produce a filtered image. A subarea of the filtered image was used as a reference in cross-correlation mapping of similar areas in the raw image. Areas centered on the peaks in the cross-correlation map were extracted from the raw image and averaged(30Saxton W.O. Baumeister W. Vigell W. Electron Microscopy at Molecular Dimensions. Springer, Berlin1980: 245-255Crossref Google Scholar, 31Frank J. Goldfarb W. Baumeister W. Vogell W. Electron Microscopy at Molecular Dimensions.

Rotational correlation coefficients were calculated for quantitative assessment of the symmetry and the resolution was estimated by calculating the radial correlation functions (32Saxton W.O. Baumeister W. J. Microsc. 1982; 127: 127-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar) and the phase residuals(33Unwin P.N.T. Klug A. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 87: 641-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 34Frank A. Verschoor A. Boublik A.M. Science. 1981; 214: 1353-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). STEM images of membranes vesicles were displayed on the television monitor and areas were enclosed within squared contours. Masses were determined by integrating the densities enclosed within each contour with appropriate background subtraction. Recognizing that the observed membranes are flattened vesicles and thus are very often double-sided, the corresponding densities were divided by two and combined to densities from single sided areas to obtain the mass per unit area. Each mass integral was calibrated relative to corresponding integrals for tobacco mosaic virus. 89 measurements were conducted on membrane areas having on average a size of 10,000 nm2. When purified membranes from C. viridis filter chamber were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the absence of β-mercaptoethanol, 80% of the protein in alkali-stripped membranes is P25. Only a second membrane polypeptide of apparent molecular mass 150 kDa (P150) corresponding to 10-20% of the protein content was detected (Fig. 1A). In order to demonstrate the tissue specificity of P25, we conducted an immunofluorescence study on cryosections over the whole insect. A strong immunofluorescence related to the labeling of P25 by the anti-P25 serum was exclusively observed over the filter chamber, and no immunoreactivity was detected over the remaining parts of the insect (Fig. 2A). Subcellular localization of P25 was carried out by immunoelectron microscopy on ultrathin sections of filter chambers, incubated with the anti-P25 serum (whose specificity is reported in Fig. 1B) and decorated with GAR-Gold. The epithelial cells exhibited a strong immunoreactivity over the apical microvilli and the basal membrane infoldings (Fig. 2B). Isolated membranes were strongly labeled mainly on one side, thus inferring that P25 might be asymmetrically inserted into the membranes (Fig. 2C). This is indeed supported by the morphology of isolated freeze-dried membranes observed in CTEM after shadowing (Fig. 10B). Thus the filter chamber of C. viridis appears, in both structure and composition, as constituted by very specialized epithelia where P25 prevails as the major intrinsic membrane polypeptide. We designed degenerate oligonucleotides from the highly conserved two NPA boxes characteristic of the MIP family proteins. A 360-base pair cDNA fragment was amplified in the filter chamber of C. viridis by PCR using these primers (Fig. 3). We called cic (from Cicadella) the cDNA fragment amplified and CIC the deduced amino acid sequence. The homologies between members of the MIP family and CIC are described in Fig. 4. Between the two NPA boxes, sequence identity was 38% for CIC-MIP26 and for CIC-AQP1 (human or rat), 34% for CIC-AQP2 (rat), 29% for CIC-bib (“big brain” of Drosophila), and 20% for CIC-γTIP (A. thaliana). Thus, the sequence of CIC is closely related to the sequence the MIP channel family.Figure 4:Amino acid sequence alignment of MIP26, AQP2, AQP1, γTIP with CIC. At each position, amino acid residues identical with those of CIC are shaded. Accession numbers in data libraries are P06624, D13906, M77829, M84344, and X77957, respectively. The underlined sequence corresponds to the synthetic peptide used for raising a rabbit antiserum.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Sense and antisense probes were prepared from cic and used for in situ hybridization experiments in order to localize these mRNA, on sections of the digestive tract of C. viridis. In all experiments performed, hybridization was strong in the filter chamber and absent from other parts of digestive tract such as initial or terminal midgut (Fig. 5). No significant signal was obtained after incubation of tissue slices with the sense probe. These results indicated a selective tissue distribution of mRNA encoding the CIC polypeptide. The hydrophobic conserved domains identified in the sequence of MIP26 and AQP1 could correspond to putative transmembrane segments. This could also be the case for CIC. If so, the hydrophilic sequence RVQGHSLYDESRPRC (Fig. 4) should correspond to the “C loop” in the two-dimensional model previously proposed for AQP1 by Preston et al.(35Preston G.M. Caroll T.P. Guggino W.B. Agre P. Science. 1992; 256: 385-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (1649) Google Scholar). As reported on Fig. 6B, a positive signal is visualized on nitrocellulose membranes blotted with increasing quantities of chromatographically purified P25, and incubated with the antipeptide serum. On Western blots of whole homogenate from filter chambers, this serum recognizes a single 25-kDa polypeptide, while no signal was detected with the preimmune serum (not shown). The immunoreactivity of P25 with an antibody directed against an hydrophilic amino acid sequence of a protein of the MIP family (CIC), associated to their specific tissue localization in the filter chamber, leads us to conclude to an identity of those two polypeptides. Further understanding of the organization of P25 in the membranes were deduced from biophysical analysis of P25, nondenaturing detergent micelles. We report in this section results obtained after extraction of P25 with two distinct nondenaturing detergents, subsequent gel filtration, and sucrose gradient sedimentation. Fig. 7 shows a typical elution profile of a column loaded with OG filter chamber membrane extracts. Following Triton X-100 or OG extractions of filter chamber membrane proteins, only P25 and P150 were detected by silver staining of polyacrylamide gels. As in Fig. 7, a polypeptide of apparent molecular mass of 75 kDa was sometimes observed; its appearance corresponds to the cleavage of P150 disulfide bridge. Silver staining of electrophoresed fractions content following gel filtration revealed that P25-OG micelles are eluted in a single peak where no other polypeptide is coeluted. Qualitatively identical results were obtained with Triton X-100 extracted proteins submitted to gel filtration; in all experiments maximal elution peaks of P25 and P150 were different. P25 is thus extracted as a single species in micelles in a monomeric or an homo-oligomeric form. The columns were calibrated with proteins of known stokes radius. The Kav determined experimentally for P25-detergent micelles permits extrapolation of their stokes radius from the calibration curves. P25-OG and P25-Triton X-100 micelles have stokes radii of 4.90 and 4.75 nm, respectively (Fig. 8, A and B). In some cases, protein extraction and gel filtration were carried out with 0.1% SDS. The average value thus obtained for Stokes radius of P25-SDS micelles was 2.90 nm. The differences observed for P25 stokes radii in denaturing and nondenaturing detergent suggest that if, as one can expect, the monomeric form of P25 is present in SDS, the nondenaturing detergent-extracted P25 is in an oligomeric form. The hydrodynamic properties of the P25-detergent solubilized complexes were further analyzed by sucrose gradient centrifugation to provide an estimate of their sedimentation coef"

One way to sort out the biological roles of each member of this complex system is by gene knockout technology in the mouse. However, the mouse chemokine system may differ fundamentally from the human system. For example, the human α chemokine interleukin-8 (IL-8) has no known counterpart in the mouse. Furthermore, only one mouse gene for an IL-8 receptor homologue has been found, whereas two closely related genes for functional human neutrophil IL-8 receptors have been cloned(12Cerretti D.P.

Mice lacking the IL-8 receptor homologue, created by gene knockout technology, exhibit expansion of neutrophils and B lymphocytes in the blood, bone marrow and lymphoid organs, and mobilize neutrophils poorly to sites of chemical irritation, suggesting a role for this receptor in both leukocyte differentiation and chemotaxis(14Cacalano G.

Here we report the cloning, RNA expression, ligand selectivity, and signal transduction properties of the first mouse β chemokine receptor gene, the MIP-1α receptor gene. In addition we have isolated two highly related genes for putative receptors whose ligands remain unknown. Restriction enzymes, T4 polynucleotide kinase, and T4 DNA ligase were obtained from New England Biolabs. [32P]dCTP was from Amersham Corp. A random primer labeling kit was from Boehringer Mannheim. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) reagents were from Perkin-Elmer Cetus. 125I-Labeled recombinant human MIP-1α, MIP-1β, RANTES, and MCP-1 (specific activity ∼2200 Ci/mmol) were purchased from DuPont NEN. Unlabeled recombinant human chemokines were purchased from Peprotech (Rocky Hill, NJ), except for mouse MIP-1α and MIP-1β and human MIP-1α, which were from R& Systems (Minneapolis, MN), and human I-309, Mig, and platelet factor 4, and mouse TCA3, which were generous gifts from M. Krangel, J. Farber, G. LaRosa, and M. Dorf, respectively. In control experiments, all chemokines used except platelet factor 4, I-309, MCP-2, and TCA3 were shown to potently induce transient elevations of [Ca2+]i using purified human leukocytes (not shown). Approximately 10 million plaques of a 129/SvJ mouse genomic DNA library constructed in the vector λ FIX (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) were hybridized with a full-length human MIP-1α/RANTES receptor cDNA labeled with [32P]dCTP using previously described methods(19Gao J.-L. Kuhns D.B. Tiffany H.L. McDermott D. Li X. Francke U. Murphy P.M. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1421-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Plaques that corresponded to duplicate hybridization signals after washing the membranes at 55°C in 5 × SSC for 30 min were purified, and the genomic inserts were mapped with restriction enzymes. Appropriate restriction fragments of the genomic inserts of clones M2, M3, and M7 that hybridized to the probe were isolated by agarose gel electrophoresis and subcloned into pBluescript SK II (Stratagene). The DNA sequences were determined on both strands. The ORFs were amplified from the corresponding subcloned genomic fragments by PCR using the sense oligonucleotides 5’-GCTCTAGACTGACCAGTTCCTCAGCAAAGGATGGAGAT for M2, 5’-GCTCTAGACTGTCCTGTAGAAGAGTTTACAATGGAGAT for M3, and 5’-GCTCTAGACATGGTTAATTGTTTCTTTGTTTATTTGT for M7; and the antisense oligonucleotides 5’-CGG GATCCCGTTGACACCTACGGTCTGAATCAGAAGCCA for M2, 5’-CGGAATTCAGGCCTTTGTTCTGTCCAGGGTCTGAATTA for M3, and 5’-CGAATTCCTTTCAGTCCATGGATAAGTGCAATTTTCTC for M7. To facilitate subcloning, all of the sense oligonucleotides contained added XbaI sites, and the antisense oligonucleotides contained added EcoRI sites in the case of M2 and M7, and BamHI in the case of M3 (underlined nucleotides). In addition to the ORF, the PCR products contained 20-60 base pairs of 5’- and 3’-flanking sequence. The amplification reaction was performed using 100 ng of plasmid DNA as a template. The PCR conditions were 94°C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 55°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 60 s, with a final extension at 72°C for 10 min. The PCR products were then digested with appropriate restriction enzymes, purified by agarose gel electrophoresis using the QIAEX system (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA), and subcloned into pBluescript. Expression plasmids were then constructed by transfer from Bluescript of XbaI/XhoI fragments containing the three cloned ORFs into the NheI and XhoI sites of the hygromycin-selectable, stable episomal vector pCEP4 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). The fidelity of the cloned expression plasmids was verified by DNA sequencing. Construction of an expression plasmid in pCEP4 for the human MIP-1α/RANTES receptor has been described previously(30Gao J.-L. Murphy P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28539-28542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Non-adherent K562 human erythroleukemia cells were grown in RPMI 1640-glutamine (Biofluids, Inc., Walkersville, MD) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (complete medium). K562 cells (107) in log phase were electroporated in the presence of 20 εg of plasmid DNA. Electroporation conditions were: 300 εl volume, 250 V, 960 microfarads, with a 0.4-cm gap electroporation cuvette. 48 h later, cells were seeded at 105 cells/ml in complete medium with 250 εg/ml hygromycin B and selected for 5 days. Subsequently, cells were maintained in complete medium with 150 εg/ml hygromycin B. Expression of specific RNA was established by Northern blot hybridization for each cell line. Neither RNA for the human MIP-1α/RANTES receptor nor specific binding of MIP-1α, MIP-1β, MCP-1, or RANTES at 4°C were detectable in untransfected K562 cells. 106 cells were incubated in duplicate with ∼0.1 nM125I-labeled recombinant human chemokines and varying concentrations of unlabeled recombinant chemokines. Binding reactions were in a total volume of 200 εl of RPMI 1640 with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4. After incubation for 2 h at 4°C, the cells were pelleted through a 10% sucrose/PBS cushion and γ emissions were counted. The data were curve-fitted with the computer program LIGAND (31Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7771) Google Scholar) to determine the dissociation constant and number of binding sites. Total leukocytes were isolated by dextran sedimentation from citrated peripheral blood obtained by cardiac puncture of BALB/c mice. Residual erythrocytes were lysed in hypotonic saline. The cells were isolated within 2 h after harvest. They were maintained in phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature and were studied immediately after purification. Cells (107/ml) were incubated in Hank's buffered saline solution with Ca2+ and Mg2+ supplemented with 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4 (HBSS+), containing 2.5 εM FURA-2 AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 30 min at 37°C in the dark. The cells were subsequently washed twice with HBSS+ and resuspended at 2 × 106 cells/ml. Two ml of the cell suspension were placed in a continuously stirred cuvette at 37°C in a fluorimeter (Photon Technology Inc., South Brunswick, NJ). Fluorescence was monitored at λex1 = 340 nm, λex2 = 380 nm, and λem = 510 nm, and the data presented as the relative ratio of fluorescence emitted upon sequential excitation at 340 and 380 nm. Data were collected every 200 ms. Total leukocytes from the peripheral blood of BALB/c mice were lysed in guanidinium isothiocyanate. Total RNA was purified by extraction with phenol and chloroform, followed by precipitation in ethanol. RNA was fractionated by size on a denaturing agarose gel and transferred to a nylon membrane as described previously (19Gao J.-L. Kuhns D.B. Tiffany H.L. McDermott D. Li X. Francke U. Murphy P.M. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1421-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). A Northern blot containing 5 εg/lane of poly(A)+ RNA from a panel of organs from a BALB/c mouse was purchased from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). Northern blots were hybridized to 32P-labeled full-length ORF probes, labeled to a similar specific activity with a random primer labeling kit (Boehringer Mannheim). DNA and protein sequences were compiled and analyzed using the software package from the University of Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group (32Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 389-395Crossref Scopus (11536) Google Scholar) on a Cray supercomputer maintained by the National Cancer Institute Advanced Scientific Computing Laboratory, Frederick Cancer Research Facility, Frederick, MD. We previously isolated the cDNA and gene for the human MIP-1α/RANTES receptor and reported that, like many other members of the seven-transmembrane-domain receptor superfamily, the ORF resides on a single exon(19Gao J.-L. Kuhns D.B. Tiffany H.L. McDermott D. Li X. Francke U. Murphy P.M. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1421-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Therefore, to find its mouse orthologue, we screened an 129/SvJ mouse genomic DNA library at low stringency with a full-length human receptor cDNA probe. Unexpectedly, 14 clones were isolated that could be assigned to three distinct groups based on common restriction enzyme cleavage patterns and hybridizing fragments. Clones M2, M3, and M7 were selected for further study, and 3.3-kb XbaI, 6.0-kb XbaI, and 4.2-kb SacI fragments, respectively, were subcloned and sequenced. Each ORF was similar in length and sequence to the human MIP-1α/RANTES receptor and appeared to lack introns. Based on sequence relationships and the functional analysis described below, we have adopted the following provisional nomenclature: M3, MIP-1α receptor (MIP-1αR); M2, MIP-1α receptor-like 1 (MIP-1αRL1); and M7, MIP-1α receptor-like 2 (MIP-1αRL2). The deduced sequences of MIP-1αR and the human MIP-1α/RANTES receptor are both 355 amino acids in length. MIP-1αRL1 and MIP-1αRL2 sequences are 1 and 4 residues longer, respectively. None of the mouse sequences has predicted sites for N-linked glycosylation, whereas the human receptor has one in the N-terminal domain (Fig. 1). The deduced protein sequence of MIP-1αR is slightly less divergent from that of the human MIP-1α/RANTES receptor (80% identity) than its DNA sequence (76% identity). In contrast, the sequences of MIP-1αRL1 and MIP-1αRL2 are less similar at the protein level (62 and 63% identity, respectively) than at the DNA level (72 and 71% identity, respectively) to the human MIP-1α/RANTES receptor, reflecting a relative increase in the content of non-synonymous substitutions. To determine whether their products are chemokine receptors, MIP-1αR, MIP-1αRL1, and MIP-1αRL2 ORFs were stably expressed in K562 cells, and ligand-stimulated calcium mobilization was measured. This response, characteristic of known leukocyte chemokine receptors, appears to be a consequence of signal transduction through a phospholipase C-coupled G protein and can be used to monitor receptor activation in real time. Neither untransfected K562 cells nor MIP-1αRL1 and MIP-1αRL2 transfectants responded to mouse MIP-1α, mouse MIP-1β, or mouse TCA3, or to any of the following human chemokines: MIP-1α, MIP-1β, RANTES, MCP-1, MCP-2, MCP-3, I-309, Mig, IP-10, IL-8, GROα, GROβ, NAP-2, platelet factor 4, and ENA-78, all tested at 100 nM (Fig. 2A and data not shown). In contrast, human MIP-1α and mouse MIP-1α both induced transient elevations of [Ca2+]i in MIP-1αR transfectants with an EC50 = 10 and 6 nM, respectively (Fig. 2, A and B). RANTES was a much less potent agonist than MIP-1α, having a threshold for calcium mobilization > 100 nM. None of the other chemokines listed above, including mouse MIP-1β, were agonists for calcium mobilization by MIP-1αR. After activation, most G protein-coupled receptors have altered sensitivity to repeated stimulation with the activating agonist and other agonists. This phenomenon, known as desensitization, has been described previously for the human MIP-1α/RANTES receptor and a viral β chemokine receptor encoded by ORF US28 of human cytomegalovirus(20Neote K. DiGregorio D. Mak J.Y. Horuk R. Schall T.J. Cell. 1993; 72: 415-425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar, 30Gao J.-L. Murphy P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28539-28542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When MIP-1αR transfectants were sequentially stimulated, 100 nM MIP-1α markedly attenuated responsiveness of the cells to repeat stimulation with the same concentration. In contrast, 100 nM RANTES, MIP-1β, or MCP-1 had no effect on the response to subsequent stimulation with 100 nM MIP-1α (Fig. 3). This further demonstrated the high selectivity of MIP-1αR for MIP-1α. To compare the functional properties of MIP-1αR to native receptors, leukocytes were isolated from the peripheral blood of BALB/c mice. As for the MIP-1αR transfectants, human MIP-1α potently induced a calcium flux response in mouse leukocytes (EC50 = 0.1 nM) whereas human RANTES was much less potent (100 nM < threshold < 500 nM) (Fig. 4). The desensitization patterns for MIP-1αR and mouse leukocytes were also concordant (Fig. 4A). After stimulation with MIP-1α, mouse leukocytes were refractory to repeat stimulation, but could still respond to the unrelated agonist N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP). In contrast, pretreatment with 100 nM RANTES had no effect on the response to 100 nM MIP-1α. While the kinetics of the calcium transient induced by human MIP-1α were similar for both MIP-1αR-transfected K562 cells and mouse leukocytes, it is important to note that the EC50 values were considerably different: 10 nMversus 0.1 nM, respectively. Additional work will be needed to determine the molecular basis for this difference. To directly test the ability of MIP-1αR, MIP-1αRL1, and MIP-1αRL2 to interact with chemokines, radioligand binding was performed. Neither untransfected K562 cells nor MIP-1αRL1 and MIP-1αRL2 transfectants specifically bound radiolabeled MIP-1α, MIP-1β, MCP-1, or RANTES at 4°C (Fig. 5A and data not shown). MIP-1αR transfectants were able to specifically bind 125I-human MIP-1α and 125I-human RANTES (Fig. 5 and 6). Scatchard transformation of computer-fitted competition binding curves with 125I-human MIP-1α as the radioligand revealed a single class of binding sites, with apparent Kd values of 20 and 10 nM for human MIP-1α and mouse MIP-1α, respectively (Fig. 5, B and C). When unlabeled human MIP-1α from a different supplier (R& Systems, Minneapolis, MN) was used, an apparent Kd of 0.41 nM was obtained (Fig. 6A). Peprotech is the source of the human MIP-1α protein that was iodinated and the competing unlabeled human MIP-1α used in Fig. 5B.Figure 6:Promiscuous binding of β chemokines to the mouse MIP-1α receptor. K562 cells stably transfected with MIP-1αR were incubated with 0.1 nM125I-human MIP-1α (A) or 0.15 nM125I-human RANTES (B), and total binding was measured in the presence of increasing concentrations of the unlabeled chemokines identified in the inset at the bottomleft of each panel. mu, mouse; hu, human. RANTES, MCP-1, and IL-8 were human forms. Average total binding was 4000 cpm (A) and 11,500 cpm (B). The average number of binding sites per cell estimated using LIGAND (31Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7771) Google Scholar) for 125I-human MIP-1α and unlabeled human MIP-1α data was 173,000. The results shown are from a single experiment representative of at least two independent experiments with both radioligands and all unlabeled chemokines. Total binding of 125I-human MCP-1 did not exceed background levels determined in similarly selected control cells. In parallel experiments with K562 cells stably transfected with MIP-1αRL1 and MIP-1αRL2 encoding plasmids, total binding did not exceed background levels with any of the four radiolabeled β chemokines.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Binding of 125I-human MIP-1α and 125I-human RANTES by MIP-1αR could be competed by all unlabeled β chemokines tested, but not by the α chemokine IL-8 (Fig. 6). The rank order and extent of competition differed depending on the identity of the radioligand. For 125I-human MIP-1α, the rank order was human MIP-1α (R&) > mouse MIP-1α∼ RANTES ∼ MIP-1β > MCP-1; for 125I-human RANTES, the rank order was human MIP-1α∼ RANTES > MIP-1β > MCP-1. The extent of competition by unlabeled MIP-1β and MCP-1 was consistently greater for the 125I-MIP-1α-labeled site than the 125I-RANTES-labeled site, whereas the extent of competition by MIP-1α was the same for both sites. The extent of competition by unlabeled RANTES was consistently less than unlabeled MIP-1α for both the 125I-MIP-1α- and 125I-RANTES-labeled sites. More severe problems with homologous RANTES competition binding assays have been reported previously for the human MIP-1α/RANTES receptor expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells(20Neote K. DiGregorio D. Mak J.Y. Horuk R. Schall T.J. Cell. 1993; 72: 415-425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). Because of these problems, accurate calculation of the Kd for RANTES binding was not possible. The weaker interaction of MCP-1 with MIP-1αR suggested by the heterologous competition binding experiments was supported by the lack of direct binding of 125I-MCP-1 to the MIP-1αR transfected cells (not shown). Low levels of 125I-MIP-1β bound specifically to the MIP-1αR transfectants (not shown). Graham et al.(28Graham G.J. Zhou L. Weatherbee J.A. Tsang M.L. Napolitano M. Leonard W.J. Pragnell I.B. Cell Growth & Diff. 1993; 4: 137-146PubMed Google Scholar) have reported that K562 cells specifically bind MIP-1α at 37°C and that binding can be competed by several β chemokines, but not by α chemokines. They did not report binding studies conducted at 4°C. We could detect specific 125I-MIP-1α, RANTES, and MCP-1 binding to untransfected K562 cells at 37°C, but the levels were very low compared to 125I-MIP-1α binding to MIP-1αR and human MIP-1α/RANTES receptor transfectants at 4 and 37°C (data not shown). Moreover, untransfected K562 cells reproducibly lacked specific binding sites for radiolabeled MIP-1α, RANTES, and MCP-1 at 4°C (n > 5), and reproducibly failed to exhibit a calcium flux by 16 different chemokines at 37°C (n > 10). Finally, we were unable to detect RNA for the human MIP-1α/RANTES receptor in untransfected K562 cells by Northern blot analysis. We have also shown that human embryonic kidney 293 cell lines, transiently or stably transfected with MIP-1αR or the human MIP-1α/RANTES receptor, exhibit calcium flux responses to β chemokines that are concordant with the corresponding K562 stable transfectants. 2J.-L. Gao and P. M. Murphy, unpublished observations. 2 Taken together, the data strongly indicate that the specific binding and calcium flux responses in the MIP-1αR transfected cells are mediated by the cloned mouse gene product. The relationship of β chemokine binding to K562 cells measured at 37°C to the cloned β chemokine receptors remains unknown. To determine the tissue distribution of MIP-1αR, MIP-1αRL1, and MIP-1αRL2 RNA, the corresponding radiolabeled complete ORF DNAs were used to probe identical Northern blots of total RNA from mouse leukocytes (Fig. 7A) and of poly(A)+ RNA from mouse solid organs (Fig. 7B) under high stringency conditions. The probes do not cross-hybridize under these conditions and do not cross-hybridize to other mouse genes (not shown). Although all three genes were expressed in"
https://openalex.org/W1965050416,"Binding of substrate-bound extracellular matrix proteins to cell surface integrins results in a variety of cellular responses including adhesion, cytoskeletal reorganization, and gene expression. We have previously shown that addition of soluble SC5b-9, the complement-vitronectin complex, resulted in an RGD-dependent increase in lung venular hydraulic conductivity (Ishikawa, S., Tsukada, H., and Bhattacharya, J. (1993) J. Clin. Invest. 91, 103-109). To identify specific integrin(s) and signal transduction pathways that are responsive to soluble vitronectin-containing ligands, we exposed confluent bovine pulmonary artery cells to purified soluble human mono- or multimeric vitronectin, or SC5b-9, and determined the extent of endothelial cell protein tyrosine phosphorylation. Monomeric vitronectin (Vn) did not induce enhanced protein tyrosine phosphorylation. However, multimeric Vn and SC5b-9 elicited time- and concentration-dependent increases in tyrosine phosphorylation of numerous proteins. Antiserum against vitronectin, RGD peptides, and monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies against the alpha v beta 3 integrin blocked the vitronectin- or SC5b-9-induced enhanced accumulation of tyrosine phosphoproteins, while antibodies against beta 1 integrins and the alpha v beta 5 integrin did not. Clustering of the alpha v beta 3 integrin using monoclonal antibody LM609 caused a pattern of enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation similar to that caused by multimeric Vn and SC5b-9, suggesting that aggregation of alpha v beta 3 was critical for signaling. Among the proteins that underwent enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation in response to vitronectin were the cytoskeletal proteins paxillin, cortactin, and ezrin, as well as the SH2 domain-containing protein Shc, and p125FAK. We conclude that ligation of the alpha v beta 3 integrin by soluble ligands promotes enhanced phosphorylation of several proteins implicated in tyrosine kinase signaling and suggest that this pathway may be important in inflammatory states which are accompanied by accumulation of SC5b-9."

After several freeze-thaw cycles, the peroxisomal membranes were separated from the matrix enzymes by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. The purity of the peroxisomal membranes was checked by measuring the activities of marker enzymes and by using antibodies. Lipid bilayer membrane experiments with the purified peroxisomal membranes, solubilized with a detergent, demonstrated that the membranes contain a channel-forming component, which may represent the major permeability pathway of these membranes. Control experiments with membranes of other cell organelles showed that the peroxisomal channel was not caused by the contamination of the peroxisomes with mitochondria or chloroplasts.The peroxisomal channel had a comparatively small single channel conductance of 350 pS in 1 M KCl as compared with channels from other cell organelles. The channel is slightly anion selective, which is in accordance with its physiological function. The single channel conductance was found to be only moderately dependent on the salt concentration in the aqueous phase. This may be explained by the presence of positive point net charges in or near the channel or by the presence of a saturable binding site inside the channel. The possible role of the channel in peroxisomal metabolism is discussed. Spinach leaf peroxisomes were purified by Percoll density gradient centrifugation.

The possible role of the channel in peroxisomal metabolism is discussed. Leaf peroxisomes belong to the microbodies, a group of small multipurpose cell organelles which are found in all, except some very primitive, eukaryotic cells(1Cavalier-Smith T. Nature. 1987; 326: 332-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). They are surrounded by a single membrane. Peroxisomes usually, although not always, contain H2O2 producing enzymes and catalase to eliminate the H2O2(2Borst P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1008: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). They all contain the enzymes for β-oxidation of fatty acids. Present evidence suggests that peroxisomes are not formed de novo but grow and divide like plastids and mitochondria, although they have no genome of their own. There are indications that all peroxisomes, e.g. from fungi, higher plants, and animals, have a common origin, possibly an endosymbiotic event(2Borst P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1008: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Leaf peroxisomes play a vital role in photosynthesis. They are involved in the recycling of glycolate formed as an unavoidable by-product of CO2 fixation due to oxygen reacting instead of CO2 with ribulose bisphosphate. In a leaf the ratio of oxigenation/carboxylation during photosynthesis is between 0.2 and 0.5, resulting in very high metabolic fluxes through the leaf peroxisomes. The peroxisomal reaction chains are strictly compartmentalized. When leaf peroxisomes were subjected to an “osmotic shock” the peroxisomal membrane was damaged extensively, but surprisingly the peroxisomal matrix did not disintegrate and its metabolic function, including the high compartmentation of metabolism, was unaltered(3Heupel R. Markgraf T. Robinson D.G. Heldt H.W. Plant. Physiol. 1991; 96: 971-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 4Reumann S. Heupel R. Heldt H.W. Planta. 1994; 193: 167-173Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The intermediates of the reaction chains did not leak out(5Heupel R. Heldt H.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 165-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). From these findings we concluded that the compartmentation of metabolism in leaf peroxisomes is not due to a boundary function of the peroxisomal membrane but is the result of the properties of the peroxisomal matrix which allow metabolite channelling(3Heupel R. Markgraf T. Robinson D.G. Heldt H.W. Plant. Physiol. 1991; 96: 971-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that specific translocators are not essential for the functional compartmentation of metabolism. Nonspecific pores seem sufficient for the metabolite transfer into and out of the leaf peroxisomes. General diffusion channels, called porins, exist in the outer membrane of Gram-negative eubacteria (for review, see (6Benz R. Ghuysen J.-R. Hakenbeck R. Bacterial Cell Wall. Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam1994: 397-423Google Scholar)), mitochondria(7Benz R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1197: 167-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar), and plastids(8Flügge U.I. Benz R. FEBS Lett. 1984; 169: 85-89Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 9Fischer K. Weber A. Brink S. Arbinger B. Schünemann D. Borchert S. Heldt H.W. Popp B. Benz R. Link T.A. Eckerskorn C. Flügge U.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25754-25760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bacterial porins occur as trimers of three identical subunits. Each subunit contains one diffusion channel for small molecules. They are formed entirely of amphipathic β-sheets arranged in a barrel-like structure(6Benz R. Ghuysen J.-R. Hakenbeck R. Bacterial Cell Wall. Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam1994: 397-423Google Scholar, 7Benz R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1197: 167-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). The results are conflicting as to whether other types of peroxisomes contain a pore-forming protein or specific translocators. Liver peroxisomes were found to be permeable to sucrose and nucleotides(10van Veldhoven P.P. Debeer L.J. Mannaerts G.P. Biochem. J. 1983; 210: 685-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Upon reconstitution experiments a channel forming activity was attributed to a 22-kDa membrane popypeptide(11van Veldhoven P. Just W.W. Mannaerts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4310-4318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but the subsequent analysis of the amino acid sequence did not show any similarity to known porin structures(12Kaldi K. Diestelkötter P. Stenbeck G. Auerbach S. Jäkle U. Mägert H.J. Wieland F.T. Just W.W. FEBS Lett. 1993; 315: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Other experiments incorporating membrane preparations of liver peroxisomes into liposomes, using the patch clamp technique(13Lemmens M. Verheyden K. van Veldhoven P. Vereecke J. Mannaerts G.P. Carmeliet E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 984: 351-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and into planar lipid bilayers (14Labarca P. Wolff D. Soto U. Necochea C. Leighton F. J. Membr. Biol. 1986; 94: 285-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) indicated that large cation-selective voltage-gated pores with an estimated diameter of 1.5-3.0 nm may be responsible for the high permeability of liver peroxisomes. In the yeast Hansenula polymorpha, a 31-kDa peroxisomal integral membrane protein, with a structure similar to the 31-kDa mitochondrial porin of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, was claimed to be responsible for the in vitro permeability of the peroxisomes(15Sulter G.J. Verheyden K. Mannaerts G. Harder W. Veenhuis M. Yeast. 1993; 9: 733-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Some results are not consistent with the presence of a free diffusion channel in peroxisomes. Yeast peroxisomal membranes contain a proton-translocating ATPase(16Douma A.C. Veenhuis M. Sulter G.J. Harder W. Arch. Microbiol. 1987; 147: 42-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and a proton gradient across the peroxisomal membrane has been observed(17Nicolay K. Veenhuis M. Douma A.C. Harder W. Arch. Microbiol. 1987; 147: 37-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). An ATPase activity was also found in the membranes of liver peroxisomes(18Kamijo K. Taketani S. Yokota S. Osumi T. Hashimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4534-4540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An integral membrane protein showing a high structural homology with mitochondrial anion translocators (19Jank B. Habermann B. Schweyen R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 427-428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) has been identified in the peroxisomal membrane of the yeast Candida boidinii. This suggests that these peroxisomes contain a specific metabolite translocator. The boundary function of the peroxisomal membrane is thus still a matter of debate. We set out to investigate whether leaf peroxisomal membranes contain channel forming activity. This report shows that leaf peroxisomal membranes contain channels allowing the passage of the metabolites of the photorespiratory metabolism and which are distinctly different from the porin channels of leaf mitochondria and chloroplasts. Peroxisomes, mitochondria, and chloroplasts were isolated from leaves of spinach (Spinacia oleracea L., U.S Hybrid 424; Ferry-Morse Seed Company, Mountain View, CA). The plants were grown and harvested as described(4Reumann S. Heupel R. Heldt H.W. Planta. 1994; 193: 167-173Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Peroxisomes were isolated by modifying to the method of Yu and Huang(20Yu C. Huang A.H.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 245: 125-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The scale was increased by a factor of five up to 350 g of leaves, and the homogenization procedure was intensified. The final peroxisomal pellet was resuspended and stored at −20°C. The yield of peroxisomes was about 6 mg of protein with a specific activity of hydroxypyruvate reductase of about 19 εmol•(min•mg)−1 (see Table 1). The intactness measured as latency of hydroxypyruvate reductase (3Heupel R. Markgraf T. Robinson D.G. Heldt H.W. Plant. Physiol. 1991; 96: 971-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) was about 95%.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab The highly aggregated structure of the matrix enzymes was destroyed by subjecting the organelles (12 mg of protein) to five freeze-thaw cycles (freezing in liquid nitrogen, thawing at room temperature) and intensive homogenization in a Potter homogenizer. The suspension was adjusted to 30% (w/w) sucrose, loaded on a linear sucrose gradient (35-60% (w/w) sucrose in 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.8 mM MgCl2), and centrifuged in a swing-out rotor (240,000 × g, 15 h, Sorvall AH 650). The gradient was fractionated from the top (12 fractions of 0.4 ml). The fractions were diluted to a sucrose content of 30% (w/w) and stored at −80°C. All the data of enzyme activities (Fig. 1), SDS-PAGE1 1The abbreviation used is: PAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. and Western blot analysis (Fig. 2), and porin activity (Fig. 6) were obtained with the same gradient and confirmed by additional experiments.Figure 2:Western blot analysis as control for membrane contamination of the peroxisomal membrane fractions and SDS-PAGE. Fractions of the sucrose gradient were subjected to SDS-PAGE (A) and immunoblotted with a polyclonal antibody against the 24-kDa protein of the outer envelope membrane of spinach chloroplasts (B) or with a polyclonal antibody against the 30-kDa porin of pea root plastids, showing strong cross-reactivity with the 30-kDa porin of the outer membrane of spinach mitochondria (C) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” For Western blot analysis in each lane, 20 εg of protein and for silver stain 3 εg of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE. Fractions 8+9 and 10+11 were pooled in a protein ratio of 1:1 because of their minor protein content.

Chloroplasts were isolated according to Heldt and Sauer (21Heldt H.W. Sauer F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 234: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) and chloroplast envelope membranes according to Douce et al.(22Douce R. Holtz R.B. Benson A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 7215-7222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mitochondria were purified according to the method of Neuburger et al.(23Neuburger M. Journet E.-P. Bligny R. Carde J.P. Douce R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 217: 312-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The mitochondria were disrupted osmotically by incubation for 30 min in distilled water on ice and sedimented afterward (160,000 × g, 45 min, Kontron TFT 65.13). If not stated otherwise, measurements of marker enzyme activities were carried out at 25°C in a final volume of 1 ml. Hydroxypyruvate reductase and catalase were measured as described previously(3Heupel R. Markgraf T. Robinson D.G. Heldt H.W. Plant. Physiol. 1991; 96: 971-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Acyl-CoA synthetase (ACS) was measured as described by Fischer et al.(9Fischer K. Weber A. Brink S. Arbinger B. Schünemann D.

The reaction was stopped after incubation for 10 min at 30°C. The measurement of NADH- ferricyanide reductase (700 εl)(24Douce R. Mannella C.A. Bonner Jr., W.D. Biochim. Biophys.

Plant Physiol. 1984; 75: 542-547Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was performed as described. Protein was determined according to Peterson (27Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7132) Google Scholar). Precipitation of protein fractions was carried out using chloroform-methanol(28Wessel D. Flügge U.-I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3169) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was performed on 12.5% gels according to Laemmli(29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207159) Google Scholar). Polypeptide bands were made visible by silver staining(30Blum H. Beier H. Gross H.J. Electrophoresis. 1987; 8: 93-99Crossref Scopus (3741) Google Scholar). In Western blot analysis the bound antibodies were made visible with a peroxidase-coupled second antibody using an ECL-kit (Amersham-Buchler, Braunschweig, Germany). The methods used for the bilayer experiments have been described in detail(31Benz R. Janko K. Boos W. Läuger P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 511: 305-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 32Schmid A. Krömer S. Heldt H.W. Benz R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1112: 174-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Peroxisomal membranes were solubilized in 0.5% Genapol X-80 (Fluka, Neu-Ulm) and added to the aqueous phases at one or both sides of the black membranes. From measurement of the activities of hydroxypyruvate reductase and catalase as marker enzymes for the peroxisomal matrix, the yield of the peroxisomes obtained from spinach leaves was evaluated as about 5 and 11% (Table 1). This low yield reflects the difficulties of peroxisomal isolation and is inherent to all published preparation procedures(20Yu C. Huang A.H.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 245: 125-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 33Schmitt M.R. Edwards G.E. Plant Physiol. 1983; 72: 728-734Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The contamination of the peroxisomal preparation with chloroplasts, mitochondria, and ER is quite low, as the recoveries of the corresponding marker enzyme activities were 0.05, 0.2, and 0.01% as compared to the starting homogenate (Table 1). From this the contamination of the peroxisomal fraction by mitochondria, chloroplasts, and ER can be evaluated as less than 1, 4, and 0.2%, respectively. The purity of the peroxisomal suspension has been checked earlier by electron microscopy(3Heupel R. Markgraf T. Robinson D.G. Heldt H.W. Plant. Physiol. 1991; 96: 971-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The most used method for the isolation of peroxisomal membranes of rat liver (11van Veldhoven P. Just W.W. Mannaerts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4310-4318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Fujiki Y. Fowler S. Shio H. Hubbard A.L. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) and glyoxysomes (35Chapman K.D. Trelease R.N. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 1992; 30: 1-10Google Scholar, 36Wolins N.E. Donaldson R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1149-1153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is treating the peroxisomes with 100 mM sodium carbonate at pH 11.5(37Fujiki Y. Hubbard A.L. Fowler S. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1382) Google Scholar). This method was unsuitable because our measurements indicated a destruction of the porin activity. After various attempts to solubilize the highly aggregated matrix enzymes, we found it best to disrupt the peroxisomes mechanically (see “Experimental Procedures”) and to separate the membranes by centrifugation in a sucrose density gradient. At present, unfortunately, there is no specific marker enzyme for the peroxisomal membrane of leaves. ACS, which has been shown to be closely associated with the membranes of leaf peroxisomes (38Gerhardt B. Physiol. Vég. 1986; 24: 397-410Google Scholar) and glyoxysomes (a differentiation form of plant peroxisomes), is present in the outer membrane of the chloroplast envelope (39Andrews J. Keegstra K. Plant Physiol. 1983; 72: 735-740Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Block M.A. Dorne A.J. Joyard J. Douce R. FEBS Lett. 1983; 153: 377-381Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 41Joyard J. Stumpf P.K. Plant Physiol. 1981; 67: 250-256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and also in the microsomal membranes(42Lessire R. Cassagne C. Plant Sci. Lett. 1979; 16: 31-39Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 43Sukumar V. Sastry P.S. Biochem. Int. 1987; 14: 719-726Google Scholar, 44Ichihara K. Nakagawa M. Tanaka K. Plant Cell Physiol. 1993; 34: 557-566Google Scholar). It is possible that the outer membranes of plant mitochondria also contain this enzyme(45Frentzen M. Neuburger M. Joyard J. Douce R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 187: 395-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The results of Table 1 show that only a minor portion of the cellular ACS activity is associated with the peroxisomes. Despite this, because of the very low contamination of the peroxisomal suspension by other ACS-containing membranes (Table 1) the ACS could be used as marker for the peroxisomal membrane. If 50% of the ACS activity were associated with the chloroplasts, the ACS activity from contaminating chloroplasts in the peroxisomal preparation would be less than 25% of the measured ACS activity. The same calculation with ER results in 1%. In the experiment shown in Fig. 1, the activities of marker enzymes for the various subcellular components have been measured in the different fractions of the sucrose density gradient. Most of the protein (about 80%) and the marker enzyme for the peroxisomal matrix catalase and hydroxypyruvate reductase are found in the upper part of the gradient. These fractions represent the peroxisomal matrix proteins. The ACS activity forms a distinct peak at a density of 1.21-1.23 g/ml. Control experiments by measuring specific marker enzymes and Western blot analysis of all fractions of the sucrose gradient excluded that this ACS peak resulted from nonperoxisomal sources. 1) One of the major constituents of the outer envelope membrane of spinach chloroplasts is a 24-kDa protein which function is unknown until now(46Fischer K. Weber A. Arbinger B. Brink S. Eckerskorn C. Flügge U.I. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 25: 167-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Using an antibody against this protein, we could localize the contaminating outer envelope membrane in the first fraction of the sucrose gradient (Fig. 2B) at its low equilibrium density concurring with earlier results(39Andrews J. Keegstra K. Plant Physiol. 1983; 72: 735-740Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 47Block M.A. Dorne A.J. Joyard J Douce R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 13273-13280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 24-kDa protein was not detectable in the fractions containing ACS activity indicating that the outer envelope membrane is absent in these fractions. 2) NADH-cytochrome c reductase, a marker enzyme for ER membranes(25Sauer A. Robinson D.G. Planta. 1985; 166: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), was found at low activities on the top of the gradient at a density of 1.15 g/ml as shown earlier(25Sauer A. Robinson D.G. Planta. 1985; 166: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). 3) The outer membrane of mitochondria was detected with the marker enzyme NADH-ferricyanide reductase (22Douce R. Holtz R.B. Benson A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 7215-7222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and in addition by using polyclonal antibodies against the 30-kDa porin of non-green pea root plastids(9Fischer K. Weber A. Brink S. Arbinger B. Schünemann D. Borchert S. Heldt H.W. Popp B. Benz R. Link T.A. Eckerskorn C. Flügge U.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25754-25760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As the porins of plant non-green plastids and mitochondria are relatively homologous proteins(9Fischer K. Weber A. Brink S. Arbinger B. Schünemann D. Borchert S. Heldt H.W. Popp B. Benz R. Link T.A. Eckerskorn C. Flügge U.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25754-25760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), these antibodies show cross-reaction with the mitochondrial 30-kDa porin of spinach (Fig. 2C) and are thus a useful marker for the detection of the outer membrane of spinach mitochondria. Using both methods we were able to show that the content of the outer mitochondrial membrane in that part of the gradient where the maximal ACS activity is localized is rather low. The cross-reaction with a polypeptide of 66 kDa in fractions 10-12 could be an nonspecific artifact. The activity of NADH-ferricyanide reductase in the upper part of the gradient (fractions 1-4) may be due to peroxisomal activity as potato tuber peroxisomes were shown to possess this enzyme(48Struglics A. Fredlund K.M. Rasmusson A.G.M.I.M. Physiologia Plantarum. 1993; 88: 19-28Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Thylakoid membranes were enriched at 1.17-1.18 g/ml (data not shown) as reported earlier(49Ludwig B. Kindl H. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1976; 357: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). As the ACS peak contained neither outer chloroplast envelope membranes, outer mitochondrial membranes, nor ER membranes to any detectable extent, it can be concluded that the ACS peak represents the peroxisomal membrane and that this membrane is not contaminated with outer membranes of chloroplasts or mitochondria to any appreciable amount. As the outer mitochondrial and outer chloroplast envelope membranes both contain porins, the absence of these membranes in the peroxisomal membrane fraction is essential. In gradients with incompletely disrupted peroxisomes, the peroxisomal membrane could be identified from the adhering activities of the peroxisomal enzymes catalase, hydroxypyruvate reductase, and malate dehydrogenase, forming a second smaller peak at 1.215 g/ml. Glyoxysomal membranes have been reported to equilibrate at this density(50Preisig-Müller R. Muster G. Kindl H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was performed with the fractions 1-12 of the same gradient (Fig. 2A). The dominant proteins of the peroxisomal membrane had a subunit molecular mass of about 50, 48, 45, 43, 39, 32, and 13 kDa. In further experiments we investigated whether peroxisomes contain any pore forming activity. The sedimented peroxisomes (protein concentration about 1 mg/ml) were treated with the detergent Genapol X-80 (final concentration 0.5%) to solubilize the peroxisomal membrane. The detergent extract was added to the aqueous phase, bathing a lipid bilayer, and the membrane current was measured. Fig. 3 demonstrates that there is indeed a pore forming activity in these detergent extracts. Each conductance step of Fig. 3 corresponds to the incorporation of one channel-forming unit into the membrane. The average single channel conductance of these channels is only 350 pS in 1 M KCl (see the histogram in Fig. 4). The occurrence of a single channel conductance of 600 pS probably indicates the incorporation of a dimer. The conductance of the peroxisomal channel is rather small as compared with those channels formed by mitochondrial or chloroplast porins under otherwise identical conditions (see also below).Figure 4:Histogram of the probability of the occurrence of certain conductivity units observed with membranes formed of diphytanoyl phosphatidylcholine/n-decane in the presence of 1 εg/ml detergent-solubilized spinach leaf peroxisomes. The aqueous phase contained 1 M KCl. The applied membrane potential was 10 mV; T = 25°C. The average single channel conductance was 350 pS for 344 single channel events. The data were collected from 10 different membranes. P(G), probability of the single channel conductance G.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The channel formed by the detergent extracts from whole peroxisomes had a completely different single channel conductance as compared with the porins from other plant cell membranes. To give further direct evidence that the origin of the novel channel-forming protein is the peroxisomal membrane, we investigated the channel forming activity of the various fractions of the sucrose gradient as follows: small quantities of the fractions were dissolved in Genapol X-80 and added to the aqueous phase on both sides of an artificial bilayer (final protein concentration in the aqueous phase 0.6 εg/ml). After a lag time of a few minutes, probably caused by slow aqueous diffusion of the protein, the conductance of the membrane, caused by the insertion of channels into the membrane, started to increase. The time course of the increase was similar to that described previously for porins of mitochondrial or bacterial origin(51Roos N. Benz R. Brdiczka D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 686: 204-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 52Benz R. Ishii J. Nakae T. J. Membr. Biol. 1980; 56: 19-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The number of inserted pores with a single channel conductance of less than 1 nS in a given time (20 min) was counted. The distribution of these conductance steps in a histogram (data not shown) was similar to that shown for whole peroxisomes (Fig. 4). The mean values of three measurements were taken as a semiquantitative measure for the peroxisomal channel forming activity of the sample. After the insertion of more than 30-50 pores in one black membrane, the single channel conductance could not be clearly identified (see Figure 3:, Figure 4:, Figure 5:). As the channel incorporation was so frequent for the fractions containing the peroxisomal membranes, several bilayers had to be painted during the measuring period. Control experiments showed that the addition of the detergent Genapol X-80 alone at a similar concentration to that used with the protein did not lead to any appreciable increase in the membrane conductance. We were able to identify three different types of channels in the protein samples taken from the sucrose density gradient. The light fractions contained (besides the 350 pS channel; see Fig. 5A) a channel with a giant single channel conductance of 7-9 nS in 1 M KCl. This channel was similar to that found in reconstitution experiments with the outer membrane of the chloroplast envelope (see Fig. 5C; 8). In other fractions (preferentially fractions 2-3), we sometimes observed an additional channel, which was indistinguishable from mitochondrial porin from plant and other sources (see Fig. 5B; 7). The most prominent channel, however, in all fractions was the 350 pS channel. Fig. 6 shows the distribution of this channel within the fraction of the sucrose density gradient. It is noteworthy that the peroxisomal porin activity measured as the number of channels (20 min after the protein addition) in a membrane with a surface area of 1 mm2 corresponded to the 350 pS channel only. When one of the other channels did happen to incorporate into the lipid bilayer membrane, the experiment was stopped and a new experiment was started. This was necessary because of the much higher single channel conductance of the mitochondrial and chloroplast porins. Fig. 6 shows also the specific activity of ACS, i.e. the content of peroxisomal membrane in the fractions of the sucrose density gradient. There is a correlation between the specific ACS activity and the pore forming activity showing that the 350 pS channel resides within the peroxisomal membrane. After the addition of whole peroxisomes or peroxisomal membranes, which had been solubilized with Genapol X-80, step increases in membrane conductance could be resolved (see Figure 3:, Figure 4:, Figure 5:). The average single channel conductance with 1 M KCl was 350 pS (see the histogram of Fig. 4). Figure 3:, Figure 4:, Figure 5: show also that most of the steps were directed upwards. Only a few downward steps were observed which means that the peroxisomal channels had a long lifetime. Even at higher transmembrane potentials of about 50 mV the closing events did not become more frequent. This demonstrates that the peroxisomal porin is not voltage-regulated at these potentials. The channel formed by peroxisomal porin was permeable for a variety of ions. Table 2 summarizes the single channel conductance for different salt solutions. The nature of the anions had a substantial influence on the single channel conductance, whereas the influence of the cations was rather small. Thus, the single channel conductance in 1 M KCl was approximately the same as in 1 M LiCl, but it was considerably smaller in 1 M potassium acetate (K+ and Cl− and Li+ and acetate have the same aqueous mobility)(53Castellan G.W. Physical Chemistry. Addison-Wesley, Reading MA1983: 769-780Google Scholar). This result suggests that the channel had a certain preference for anions. We found that a variety of organic anions, such as formiate, glycerate, and glycolate are permeating this channel. It is noteworthy, that the conductance of the channel was not a linear function of the bulk aqueous concentration, which may indicate that positive point net charges are localized in or near the channel mouth. On the other hand, it is also possible that the channel contains a binding site for organic anions, which facilitates the diffusion of these ions in a similar way as specific bacterial porins do for certain substrates such as sugars, nucleosides, and phosphate(6Benz R. Ghuysen J.-R. Hakenbeck R. Bacterial Cell Wall. Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam1994: 397-423Google Scholar).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab The single channel data suggested that the peroxisomal channel is anion-selective. We performed zero current membrane potential measurements to study its ion selectivity in more detail. Membranes were formed in 100 mM KCl, and detergent-solubilized peroxisomal membrane was added to the aqueous phase when the membranes were in the black state. After incorporation of 100-1000 channels into a membrane, salt gradients were established by addition of small amounts of 3 M KCl solution to one side of the membrane. Under these conditions, the more diluted side of the membrane became negative which indicated indeed preferential movement of chloride over potassium. However, the potential and the permeability ratio between potassium and chloride (as calculated from the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation; 54) differed considerably from experiment to experiment, which probably means that other channels such as mitochondrial porin or the chloroplast porin interfered with the measurements and led to irreproducible results. This is because the single channel conductance of the peroxisomal porin (350 pS) is about 6-12 times smaller than that of mitochondrial porin (2.4 or 4.0 nS) and about 23 times smaller than that of chloroplast porin (8 nS) under otherwise identical conditions (1 M KCl). The peroxisomal membrane of leaf peroxisomes contains a channel-forming protein that is different from those of other cell organelles. The channel shows a single channel conductance of 350 pS (1 M KCl) which is much lower than those formed by the porins of mitochondria and chloroplasts under otherwise identical conditions (see Table 3). Furthermore, the single channel conductance in salts containing organic anions is much smaller as expected from the mobility of these ions in the aqueous phase. Apparently the peroxisomal channel is not a wide, water-filled channel like the channels of the mitochondrial and the chloroplast porins. The single channel conductance is not a linear function of the bulk aqueous concentration, caused either by positive net charges in or near the channel mouth or by a binding site for anions. This is another indication that the peroxisomal channel has specialized channel properties. The size of the peroxisomal channel is somewhat difficult to obtain from the single channel measurements since only the size of wide, water-filled channels may be obtained from their conductance(6Benz R. Ghuysen J.-R. Hakenbeck R. Bacterial Cell Wall. Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam1994: 397-423Google Scholar, 7Benz R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1197: 167-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). As shown in Table 2 the K+ salts of formiate, acetate, glycerate, and glycolate are able to penetrate the channels, but the channel conductance with these ions is much smaller than with KCl. It appears from this result that the channels are just large enough to let these organic anions pass through. From the size of the permeating molecules, a channel diameter of about 1 nm may be estimated. The channel appears to be well suited to enable the transfer of metabolites in and out of the peroxisomes during photorespiratory metabolism.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Our data strongly suggest that plant peroxisomes contain an ion-permeable channel. The question arises whether pores are a common principle of the permeability properties of peroxisomal membranes. We mentioned in the Introduction that peroxisomes from yeast and liver may contain pores that have very similar properties to those in the outer membrane of the mitochondria(11van Veldhoven P. Just W.W. Mannaerts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4310-4318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Kaldi K. Diestelkötter P. Stenbeck G. Auerbach S. Jäkle U. Mägert H.J. Wieland F.T.

Yeast. 1993; 9: 733-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In particular, the channels reconstituted from liver peroxisomes show the same high voltage dependence, commencing at about 20-30 mV, as mitochondrial porins(7Benz R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1197: 167-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 11van Veldhoven P. Just W.W. Mannaerts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4310-4318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We did not observe any voltage dependence up to 70 mV, indicating that the channel from leaf peroxisomes described here is not voltage regulated within the physiological range of membrane potentials. Obviously the channels attributed to liver peroxisomes have completely different properties than the channel described in our study. It remains to be studied whether the relatively small peroxisomal pores characterized here to be completely different from mitochondrial and chloroplast pores are a special feature of leaf peroxisomes, or whether they are also present in peroxisomes from other cells. We thank Dr. S. Borchert for useful discussions and M. Raabe for her excellent help in preparation of peroxisomes. The antibodies were kindly provided by Prof. Dr. Flügge (Universität Köln)."

Monoclonal antibodies of CD14 such as 3C10 and MEM-18 are known to neutralize biological activity of CD14. Recently, it has been demonstrated that MEM-18 recognizes the LPS-binding site of CD14, between amino acids 57 and 64. It has also been shown that 3C10 recognizes a distinct epitope from that of MEM-18, indicating that 3C10 may yet define another functional domain of CD14. In order to identify the epitope for 3C10, we constructed a series of alanine substitution mutants of soluble CD14 (sCD14). BIAcore analyses showed that regions between amino acids 7 and 10 and between amino acids 11 and 14 are required for 3C10 binding. To assess the effect of altering the 3C10 epitope in CD14, we generated a stable cell line expressing a mutant sCD14 containing alanine substitutions in the region between amino acids 7 and 10, sCD14(7-10)A, and purified this protein to homogeneity. sCD14(7-10)A has impaired ability to mediate LPS-dependent IL-6 up-regulation in U373 cells, integrin activation in neutrophils, and NF-κB activation in U373 cells. Purified sCD14(7-10)A was, however, capable of forming a stable complex with LPS in an LPS binding protein-facilitated and LPS binding protein-independent fashion. The ability of sCD14(7-10)A to bind LPS was also demonstrated in assays in which excess sCD14(7-10)A inhibited LPS-mediated tumor necrosis factor-α production in whole blood and adhesion of polymorphonuclear leukocytes to fibrinogen. These data strongly suggest that a region recognized by neutralizing monoclonal antibody 3C10 contains a domain required for cellular signaling but not for LPS binding.

The instrument, CM5 sensor chips, and amine-coupling kit were purchased from Pharmacia Biosensor. Briefly, mAb 3C10 (200 μg/ml in 20 mM sodium acetate, pH 3.4) was immobilized to a CM5 sensor chip by amine coupling according to the manufacturer's specifications. The flow cell immobilized with 3C10 was then incubated in succession with solutions as detailed in the following steps: step 1, COS-7 CM for 2 min, and step 2, HBS buffer (10 mMN-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N′-2-ethanesulfonic acid, pH 7.5, 0.15 M NaCl, 3.4 mM EDTA, 0.005% (v/v) surfactant P20 (Pharmacia Biosensor)) for 2 min. For regeneration, 10 mM HCl solution was injected for 2 min. Injection was performed at a rate of 5 μl/min. To quantitate the binding of sCD14 mutants in COS-7 CM to immobilized 3C10, we calculated the relative response unit (RRU).

Briefly, PMNs were incubated for 10 min with LPS, rLBP, and sCD14(7-10)A or sCD141-348 and washed, and adhesion to fibrinogen-coated surfaces was measured as described(5Hailman E. Lichenstein H.S.

When smooth LPS is used in this protocol, adhesion is completely dependent on addition of sCD141-348(8Juan T.S.-C. Kelley M.J. Johnson D.A. Busse L.A. Hailman E. Wright S.D. Lichenstein H.S. J. Biol.

In this experiment, rough LPS (S. minnesota R60, 10 ng/ml) was incubated with rLBP (1 μg/ml) and the indicated concentrations of sCD14(7-10)A or sCD141-348 for 30 min at 37°C before the addition of PMNs. The adhesion of PMNs was measured as described above.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift AssaysWhole cell extracts from U373 cells were prepared to assess transcription factor NF-κB activation. Cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 1 million cells/well 1 day prior to stimulation. For stimulation, purified sCD141-348, sCD14Δ57-64(17Juan T.S.-C. Hailman E. Kelley M.J. Busse L.A.

Cells were washed twice with 1 × phosphate-buffered saline (Life Technologies, Inc.) and scraped in 200 μl of lysis buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 0.1 M KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM Pefabloc (Boehringer Mannheim), 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin) supplemented with 1% Triton X-100 (Sigma). Crude extracts were transferred to microfuge tubes, and debris was separated by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. Extracts were quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C. Protein concentration of the whole cell extracts was determined by Micro BCA assay and ranged between 1.5 and 2 μg/μl.For examining the NF-κB complexes, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Two oligonucleotides (5′-CATGGAGGGACTTTCCGCTGGGGACTTTCCAGC-3′ and 5′-CATGGCTGGAAAGTCCCCAGCGGAAAGTCCCTC-3′) were annealed to generate a double-stranded DNA containing the NF-κB binding site of human immunodeficient virus long terminal repeat promoter(18Nabel G. Baltimore D. Nature. 1987; 326: 711-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (1442) Google Scholar). This annealed DNA fragment was then filled in with Klenow fragment (Boehringer Mannheim) and [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Corp.) and used as probe at a concentration of 50,000 cpm/lane (about 25 fmol). For binding, 4 μl of whole cell extract was incubated with 4 μl of 5 × binding buffer (150 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 40 mM MgCl2, 5 mM dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol), 2.5 μg of (poly(dI•dC)):(poly(dI•dC)) (Pharmacia Biosensor), radioactively labeled DNA probe, and an adequate amount of lysis buffer so that the final volume was 20 μl/reaction. The reactions were incubated in a 30°C water bath for 30 min, and complexes were resolved in a native 4.5% polyacrylamide gel using 0.5 × TBE (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 45 mM boric acid, and 5 mM EDTA) at 30 mA for 2 h. The gel was then vacuum-dried at 80°C for 1 h and exposed to Kodak x-ray film for 20 h. In competition experiments, 100 × molar excess of unlabeled NF-κB probe was preincubated for 10 min before the addition of radioactive probe.Native PAGE AssaysTo directly assess LPS binding of purified sCD14 preparations, sCD141-348 or sCD14(7-10)A was incubated at various concentrations (0, 101, 303, and 909 nM) with 3 μg/ml of 3H-LPS prepared from E. coli K12 strain LCD25 (List Biological Laboratories) in the presence or absence of 16.7 nM rLBP. The reaction was incubated at 37°C for 30 min and then electrophoresed on native 4-20% polyacrylamide gels. Gels were prepared for fluorography as described previously(5Hailman E. Lichenstein H.S.

Rong G.-W. Bazil V. Silver J. Goyert S.M. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 5868-5876PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, various concentrations of bovine serum albumin (Miles, New Haven, CT), sCD141-348, or sCD14(7-10)A diluted in 50 μl of RPMI medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) were added to 250 μl of freshly drawn blood using heparin as an anti-coagulant. Smooth LPS (S. minnesota wild-type) was added to a final concentration of 0.25 ng/ml. The reaction was incubated at 37°C for 3 h, and supernatants were obtained by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 2 min. TNF-α concentrations in the supernatants were assayed using a Quantikine TNF-α enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) as suggested by the manufacturer.RESULTSAlanine Substitution at Amino Acids 7-10 or 11-14 Disrupts Binding of Neutralizing mAb 3C10 to CD143C10 is a mAb that recognizes the N-terminal 152 amino acids of CD14(8Juan T.S.-C.

Med. 1991; 173: 1281-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). To verify that neutralization of sCD14 activity was due to binding of epitopes within the N-terminal 152 amino acids, we demonstrated that 3C10 inhibited IL-6 production in U373 cells mediated by either sCD141-348 or sCD141-152 (data not shown).To map the epitope for mAb 3C10, a series of alanine substitution mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis (Table 1). Plasmids containing cDNA sequences encoding different sCD14 mutants were transfected into COS-7 cells, and CM from these cells were examined for the expression of mutant sCD14 proteins by Western blot (Table 1). With the exception of sCD14(18-21)A, all sCD14 mutants were expressed and secreted by COS-7 cells. BIAcore analysis (Fig. 1) was then used to examine the ability of CM containing mutant sCD14 to bind 3C10. CM containing sCD14(7-10)A or sCD14(11-14)A were found not to bind 3C10. These data suggest that the region between amino acids 7 and 14 is involved in recognizing 3C10.Purification and Characterization of sCD14(7-10)ASince neutralizing mAb 3C10 recognized amino acids 7-14, we reasoned that this region of CD14 could play an important role in the biological activity of CD14. To help understand the role of this region, we generated a stable Chinese hamster ovary cell line expressing sCD14(7-10)A and purified mutant protein from the serum-free CM of this cell line. Purified sCD14(7-10)A migrated with an apparent Mr of 55,000 when analyzed by reducing SDS-PAGE (data not shown). N-terminal sequencing indicated that the amino acids between 7 and 10 were replaced with alanine residues as expected.mAb 3C10 Does Not Recognize Purified sCD14(7-10)ABIAcore realtime analysis was again used to determine whether mAb 3C10 is able to bind purified sCD14(7-10)A. Fig. 2 shows that sCD141-348 recognized immobilized 3C10 and caused an increase of 1800 RU 2 min after the wash (compare RU of the sensorgram before HCl injection at t = 300 to that before injection of sCD141-348 at t = 0), confirming previous observations(8Juan T.S.-C.

However, purified sCD14(7-10)A failed to recognize 3C10 and caused only slight RU change (compare RU of the sensorgram after second wash at t = 750 to that before injection of sCD141-348 at t = 0) similar to that observed when an irrelevant protein such as bovine serum albumin was injected (data not shown), demonstrating that amino acids 7-10 are required for mAb 3C10 binding.Figure 2:mAb 3C10 does not recognize purified sCD14(7-10)A.

Circular dichroism spectra of fungal VDAC in detergents and liposomes are very similar to those of bacterial porins(41Shao L. Van Roey P. Kinnally K.W. Mannella C.A. Biophys.

While all models for the VDAC open state posit a β-barrel, there is considerable disagreement on the number of β-strands (from 12 to 19) and on the disposition of the amino-terminal segment, which may fold as an amphiphilic α-helix(17Kleene R.

Biol. 1995; 114: 41-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The current state of affairs, summarized by Mannella et al. (11), is that no structural model for VDAC successfully accounts for all the available data.To address this situation, a battery of polyclonal antibodies is being raised against peptides corresponding to various regions of the fungal VDAC polypeptide. These will be used to determine the accessibility of epitopes in these regions of the VDAC protein and to functionally map the protein. This report characterizes antibodies directed against four regions of fungal VDAC: residues 1-20 (the amino terminus), 195-210, 251-268, and 272-283 (the carboxyl terminus). Binding of the antibodies to fungal mitochondria is correlated with outer membrane intactness (to determine the side of the outer membrane on which epitopes are exposed) and with preincubation of lysed mitochondria with VDAC effectors.RESULTSBinding of the Antipeptide Antibodies to Peptides and to Fungal and Non-fungal VDAC-Peptides corresponding to four different regions in the fungal VDAC polypeptide (residues 1-20, 195-210, 251-268, 272-283) were conjugated to hemocyanin and used to immunize rabbits. For each peptide, antisera were obtained that reacted with the immunizing peptide, labeled a single strong band in Western blots of fungal mitochondria at the Mr expected for VDAC, and exhibited binding to immobilized lysed mitochondria that was specifically inhibited by the immunizing peptide (see “Experimental Procedures”). By these criteria, it was concluded that each antiserum is specific for the segment in the VDAC polypeptide corresponding to the respective immunizing peptide.Western blot experiments were used to check the reactivity of the antipeptide antibodies with VDAC from other species. The results of these experiments are summarized in. None of the antibodies reacted with proteins from rat-heart mitochondria or from yeast cells expressing human VDAC. In contrast, three of the four antipeptide antibodies labeled a protein at Mr 31,000 (presumably VDAC) in wild-type yeast. There appeared to be a general correlation between the intensity of labeling of the yeast VDAC band by an antipeptide antibody and the percent amino acid identity between the immunizing fungal VDAC peptide and the corresponding region in the nonfungal polypeptide. Cross-reactivity of the antibodies with nonfungal VDAC was detectable only when the amino acid identity between the fungal and nonfungal subsequences was above about 40%.Accessibility of Epitopes on the Mitochondrial Outer MembraneTo determine whether epitopes are exposed on the outer or inner face of the outer mitochondrial membrane, reactivities of antipeptide antibodies toward mitochondria with predominantly intact and lysed outer membranes were compared by both a back-titration ELISA and immunoelectron microscopy. For both kinds of experiments, relative intactness of outer membranes was determined by the cytochrome c accessibility assay described under “Experimental Procedures.”Varying concentrations of mitochondria (predominantly intact or lysed) were incubated with a constant dilution of antibody. Mitochondria were pelleted, and the supernatants were assayed for unbound antibody by an ELISA using plates coated with lysed mitochondria. The depletion of antibody from each antiserum as a function of mitochondrial protein concentration is shown in Fig. 3, typical of results obtained several times for each antibody. Three of the antibodies, anti(1-20), anti(195-210), and anti(272-283), are bound much more effectively by mitochondria after lysis of the outer membranes, i.e. depletion of antibody from the supernatant occurs at considerably lower mitochondrial protein concentrations. Furthermore, when the data for binding of these antibodies by non-lysed mitochondria are replotted after multiplying the mitochondrial protein concentration by the fraction of mitochondria with broken outer membranes, the data points fall on the curve for fully lysed mitochondria (Fig. 3, A, B, and D). This result strongly argues that binding of these three antibodies directly correlates with outer membrane lysis and not with some other possible effect of hypoosmotic treatment. The fourth antibody, anti(251-268), behaves differently; its depletion curves for lysed and non-lysed mitochondria (Fig. 3C) are approximately parallel and level off at low mitochondrial concentration. The simplest interpretation of these results is that the three antibodies whose binding at low mitochondrial concentrations increases markedly with outer membrane lysis are recognizing VDAC epitopes located predominantly on the inner membrane-facing surface of the outer membrane. The absence of a similar effect with anti(251-268) suggests that the majority of its epitopes are located on the external surface of the outer membrane.Indirect immunoelectron microscopy also was used to assess the disposition of the epitope(s) for one of the antibodies, anti(1-20). The results, summarized in Table III, agree well with the results described above for the back-titration ELISAs. When lysed and non-lysed fungal mitochondria are incubated sequentially with antibody and protein A gold, the lysed mitochondria are labeled with a significantly greater density of gold particles, suggesting increased accessibility of the epitope(s) of anti(1-20).Table III:Binding of antibodies against VDAC peptide (1-20) to Neurospora mitochondria as a function of outer membrane integrity in immuno-gold electron microscopy experiments Open table in a new tab Effect of Channel Modulators on Binding of Antipeptide AntibodiesSeveral agents have been identified that alter the voltage-gating characteristics of VDAC. Experiments were undertaken to determine whether incubation of fungal mitochondria (immobilized on microtiter plates after outer membrane lysis) with these effectors alters the binding of antipeptide antibodies. Two of the effectors used were aluminum (added as AlCl3), which inhibits voltage-dependent closure of VDAC(32Dill E.T. Holden M.J. Colombini M. J. Membr. Biol. 1987; 99: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and NADH, which increases the channel's voltage sensitivity(33Zizi M. Forte M. Blachly-Dyson E. Colombini M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1614-1616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When incubated with mitochondria at concentrations that affect VDAC gating, neither chemical was found to have a statistically significant effect on antibody binding (results not shown). Several large polyanions have been found to decrease VDAC gating potential(34Mangan P.S. Colombini M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4896-4900Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), one of which is a 10-kDa copolymer of maleate, styrene, and methacrylate that also inhibits mitochondrial uptake of adenine nucleotides(35Benz R. Wojtczak L. Bosch W. Brdiczka D. FEBS Lett. 1988; 231: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Micromolar levels of this modulator polyanion were found to inhibit binding of three of the four antipeptide antibodies to lysed fungal mitochondria in a concentration-dependent fashion, with greatest inhibition observed for anti(251-268) (Fig. 4).Figure 4:Effect of the modulator polyanion at concentrations of 1 μM (open bars) and 5 μM (solid bars) on binding of antibodies (diluted 1:1000) to lysed mitochondria.

Three of the four antibodies display a latency of binding to fungal mitochondria that correlates directly with outer membrane lysis, indicating that their epitopes are exposed at the interior surface of the outer membrane. One of these antibodies is anti(1-20), in apparent contradiction with a previous report (15De Pinto V. Prezioso G. Thinnes F. Link T.A. Palmieri F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10191-10200Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) that lysis of beef-heart mitochondria does not increase binding of an antibody against the amino-terminal of VDAC. There are at least two possible explanations for the discrepancy between the current and earlier studies. One is that the amino-terminal segment of VDAC might cross the outer membrane and that the antibodies used in the two studies recognize epitopes at opposite ends of the peptide. Another possibility is suggested by our observation that salt-containing buffers like those used in the previous study cause mitochondrial outer membranes to rupture over long periods of time (greater than 1 h). This loss of mitochondrial integrity was prevented in the back-titration experiments of Fig. 3 by including hyperosmotic concentrations of sucrose in the buffer. Since mitochondrial outer membrane integrity was not monitored in the earlier beef-heart study, it is possible that outer membranes of what were considered to be intact mitochondria lysed during the experiments, exposing internal epitopes to the antibodies.It is unknown which subregions of the VDAC peptides serve as epitopes for the respective antibodies. However, in the case of anti(1-20), clues about a likely recognition site are provided by cross-reactivity of the antibody with yeast and human VDAC (see Table II). This antibody reacts well with yeast VDAC, yet the immunizing peptide has significant homology with the yeast sequence only in the segment 14-20, making this 7-residue-long region a likely linear epitope. The sequence of human VDAC, which is not recognized by anti(1-20), agrees with fungal VDAC at only two residues in the same region. That segment 14-20 may be an epitope for anti(1-20) is consistent with the finding (43Koppel D. Masters P. Shao L. Mannella C.A. Biophys. J. 1995; 68 (abstr.): 145Google Scholar) that this antibody reacts with a yeast VDAC construct missing residues 1-8.Table II:Cross-reactivity of antipeptide antibodies with VDAC of human and yeast mitochondria Open table in a new tab As noted in the Introduction, existing structural models for VDAC are based on a β-barrel motif, although the postulated numbers and identities of the transmembrane β-strands vary considerably(12Forte M. Guy H.R. Mannella C.A. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1987; 19: 341-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 13Blachly-Dyson E. Peng S.Z. Colombini M. Forte M.

J. 1995; 68 (abstr.): 145Google Scholar). The ability of anti(272-283) to bind to mitochondria is unexpected, since its immunizing peptide almost coincides with a segment that is a consensus candidate for a transmembrane β-strand, 271-281 (Table IV), and so should be inaccessible. A similar situation exists with anti(251-268) since segment 253-263 is another consensus β-strand candidate, although residues 264-268 might comprise an accessible linear epitope at one membrane surface.Table IV:Summary of binding of antipeptide antibodies to mitochondrially bound VDAC Open table in a new tab The simplest interpretation of the reactivities of anti(272-283) and, to a lesser extent, of anti(251-268) with membrane-bound VDAC is that the models are wrong and these are not transmembrane β-strands. However, there is another possible explanation, namely that some β-strands may not always be in a transmembrane configuration. For example, electrophysiological studies on mutant yeast VDACs (36Peng S. Blachly-Dyson E. Forte M. Colombini M. Biophys. J. 1992; 62: 123-135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) suggest that several transmembrane β-strands in the carboxyl-terminal region may leave the lumen during partial closure of the channel. Thus, the ability of anti(272-283) and anti(251-268) to bind to isolated mitochondria could indicate that some or all of the VDAC channels are in the partially closed state. The free energy difference between the open and partially closed states of VDAC is so small (about one-third that of a hydrogen bond) that the states have been referred to as “quasi-degenerate”(37Colombini M. J. Membr. Biol. 1989; 111: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that VDAC in the mitochondrial outer membrane in vitro (and perhaps in vivo) is in dynamic equilibrium between two (or more) different functional states and that antibodies may react with epitopes that are transiently exposed in any of the states. Of course, the existence of a dynamic population of mixed channel conformers complicates the interpretation of experiments like those presented in this paper. For example, the two hypotheses for the location of the amino-terminal α-helix (i.e. forming part of the lumen or extending away from it) cannot be distinguished by the binding of anti(1-20) to mitochondria, since this part of VDAC (like the carboxyl-terminal region) also may leave the lumen wall upon closure(36Peng S. Blachly-Dyson E. Forte M. Colombini M. Biophys. J. 1992; 62: 123-135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This situation may be simplified experimentally by working with systems in which VDAC is “locked” in a particular conformation (e.g. two-dimensional crystals and voltage-clamped bilayers).The fact that aluminum and NADH do not change the extent of binding of any antibody to lysed mitochondria indicates that, under the conditions of these experiments, these channel effectors do not lock the channels into states with altered epitope accessibility. In contrast, the modulator polyanion selectively inhibits binding of several antibodies to lysed mitochondria. Since the polyanion favors the partially closed state of VDAC, this inhibition may reflect reduced epitope accessibility in this state. Alternatively, since the polyanion is large (Mr 10,000), its inhibition of antibody binding may be steric, reflecting proximity of its binding site(s) to the corresponding epitopes. A likely example of steric blocking of antibody binding to VDAC is observed in experiments with mitochondria preincubated with cytochrome c (results not shown)(45Stanley S. Immunological-Topographical Analysis of the Mitochondrial Voltage-dependent Anion-selective Channel, M.S. thesis, The University at Albany, SUNY. 1994; Google Scholar). Electron microscopic results indicate that this protein binds to two-dimensional crystals of VDAC in a region occupied by the amino-terminal α-helix(18Guo X.W. Smith P.R. Cognon B. D'Arcangelis D. Dolginova E. Mannella C.A. J. Struct. Biol. 1995; 114: 41-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 38Mannella C.A. Ribeiro A.J. Frank J. Biophys. J. 1987; 51: 221-226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Binding of anti(1-20) to mitochondria is inhibited about 50% by preincubation of mitochondria with 0.17 mM cytochrome c, while binding of anti(272-283) is unaffected. In the case of the modulator polyanion, the strongest inhibition occurs with anti(251-268), whose epitopes are exposed on the external surface of the outer membrane. Binding of the polyanion to the outer surface of mitochondria is consistent with this macromolecule's inhibition of adenine nucleotide uptake by intact mitochondria in vitro(35Benz R. Wojtczak L. Bosch W. Brdiczka D. FEBS Lett. 1988; 231: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar).Experiment 1 was done with antibody against glutaraldehyde-coupled peptide-hemocyanin conjugate, and experiments 2 and 3 were done with antibody against EDAC-coupled conjugate.

INTRODUCTIONThe mitochondrial outer membrane contains numerous copies of a polypeptide (Mr 31,000) that forms large conductance, voltage-gated ion channels when incorporated into phospholipid bilayers or liposomes(1Colombini M.

This voltage-dependent, anion-selective channel (VDAC)1 1The abbreviations used are: VDACvoltage-dependent anion-selective channelBSAbovine serum albuminELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. (5Schein S.J. Colombini M. Finkelstein A. J. Membr.

Circular dichroism spectra of fungal VDAC in detergents and liposomes are very similar to those of bacterial porins(41Shao L. Van Roey P. Kinnally K.W. Mannella C.A. Biophys. J. 1994; 66 (abstr.): 21Google Scholar, 42Shao L. Biophysical Studies of the Conformational and Functional States of the Mitochondrial Voltage-dependent Anion-selective Channel, Ph.D. thesis, The University at Albany, SUNY. 1994; Google Scholar), indicating that the two classes of large passive diffusion pores have similar secondary structure. Bacterial porins have been shown by electron (6Jap B.K. Downing K. Walian P.J. J. Struct. Biol. 1990; 103: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and x-ray crystallography (7Weiss M.S.

Electron microscopic images of fungal VDAC in frozen-hydrated, two-dimensional crystals are consistent with a β-barrel having a diameter of 3.8 nm at the Cα backbone(10Mannella C.A. Guo X.W. Cognon B. FEBS Lett. 1989; 253: 231-234Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar), somewhat wider than bacterial porin and in agreement with the known permeability properties of mitochondrial porin(4Colombini M.

Biomembr. 1992; 24: 7-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Several structural models have been proposed for VDAC based on results from electron microscopy, computer analyses of available sequences, accessibility of regions of the protein to either proteases or an antibody against the amino terminus, and electrical characteristics of site-directed mutants(12Forte M. Guy H.R. Mannella C.A. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1987; 19: 341-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 13Blachly-Dyson E. Peng S.Z. Colombini M. Forte M.

Commun. 1994; 200: 908-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). While all models for the VDAC open state posit a β-barrel, there is considerable disagreement on the number of β-strands (from 12 to 19) and on the disposition of the amino-terminal segment, which may fold as an amphiphilic α-helix(17Kleene R.

Mannella C.A. J. Struct. Biol. 1995; 114: 41-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). One model places the amino-terminal helix in the lumen wall(13Blachly-Dyson E. Peng S.Z. Colombini M. Forte M. Science. 1990; 247: 1233-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), while other models have the helix outside the lumen(14Mannella C.A. Experientia. 1990; 46: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 15De Pinto V. Prezioso G. Thinnes F. Link T.A. Palmieri F.

Biol. 1995; 114: 41-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The current state of affairs, summarized by Mannella et al. (11), is that no structural model for VDAC successfully accounts for all the available data.To address this situation, a battery of polyclonal antibodies is being raised against peptides corresponding to various regions of the fungal VDAC polypeptide. These will be used to determine the accessibility of epitopes in these regions of the VDAC protein and to functionally map the protein. This report characterizes antibodies directed against four regions of fungal VDAC: residues 1-20 (the amino terminus), 195-210, 251-268, and 272-283 (the carboxyl terminus). Binding of the antibodies to fungal mitochondria is correlated with outer membrane intactness (to determine the side of the outer membrane on which epitopes are exposed) and with preincubation of lysed mitochondria with VDAC effectors."
https://openalex.org/W2076176277,"The mechanism of cytoskeletal protein transport, especially the question of what kind of form the cytoskeletal proteins assume during transport in neurons in situ, has been an important, as yet unsettled issue. To clear up this matter, we adopted the embryonic zebrafish as a living animal model and applied the fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) method. The zebrafish embryo is appropriate for this kind of study because of its transparency during the early developmental stage, allowing the observation of neurons that incorporate the microinjected fluorescent tubulin directly under fluorescence microscopy. FRAP revealed no movement of the bleached zone proximodistally, where fluorescence recovered gradually (recovery half-time, 44.2 +/- 11.2 min; n = 36), suggesting that the polymers are stationary but dynamic and that the true moving form could be small oligomers or heterodimers."

Indeed, cells derived from AIDS-KS demonstrate increased levels of mRNAs encoding several growth promoting factors, including acidic and basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-1 and FGF-2, respectively), IL-1 (α and β), transforming growth factor-β, platelet-derived growth factor, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor(25Ensoli B. Nakamura S. Salahuddin S.Z. Biberfeld P. Larsson L. Beaver B. Wong-Staal F. Gallo R.C. Science. 1989; 243: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). In addition, immunoprecipitation studies have detected the appearance of biologically active IL-1α and FGF-2 in medium conditioned by AIDS-KS cells in vitro(25Ensoli B. Nakamura S. Salahuddin S.Z.

The extracellular appearance of FGF is particularly relevant since this family of polypeptides serves as potent mitogens for mesoderm-derived cells in vitro and functions as hormone inducers of angiogenesis in vivo(26Folkman J.

Interestingly, FGF-1 and FGF-2 are unusual in that, unlike the other seven FGF family members, they lack a classical signal sequence for secretion, a unique feature also shared by IL-1α and TAT(28Auron P.E.

Under normal physiologic conditions, intracellularly sequestered FGF may not be available to mediate its full biological potential.2 2J. T. Shin, S. R. Opalenik, J. N. Wehby, V. K. Mahesh, A. Jackson, F. Tarantini, T. Maciag, and J. A. Thompson, submitted for publication. Consequently, mechanisms whereby the cytosolic growth factors are released into the extracellular environmment become fundamental for understanding the regulation of FGF biology. In the absence of defined mechanisms regulating the release of FGF prototypes from intracellular stores, most studies have proposed that the extracellular appearance of FGF-1 and FGF-2 is the consequence of cell death/damage(44Mignatti P. Morimoto T. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 151: 81-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 45Galloway A.C. Pelletier R. D'Amore P.A.

However, previous results have determined that FGF-2 can be secreted from cytoplasmic stores by an exocytosis pathway independent of the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi apparatus(44Mignatti P. Morimoto T. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 151: 81-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). In addition, FGF-1 has been demonstrated to be released from NIH 3T3 cells in response to heat shock (47Jackson A. Friedman S. Zhan X. Engleka K.A. Forough R. Maciag T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10691-10695Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) by an endoplasmic reticulum-independent pathway as a latent complex, which requires activation by reducing agents(48Jackson A. Tarantini F. Gamble S. Friedman S. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33-36Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recent efforts2 have suggested that primary murine embryonic fibroblasts, transduced with the native human FGF-1 gene, are able to secrete this growth factor in response to an altered redox potential associated with serum starvation. Oxidative stress is recognized to be associated with most pathophysiological conditions, including HIV-1 infection(49Staal F.J.T. Ela S.W. Roederer M. Anderson M.T. Herzenberg L.A. Lancet. 1992; 339: 909-912Abstract PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). HeLa cells stably transfected with the TAT gene have demonstrated evidence of increased oxidative stress by suppressing expression of manganese superoxide dismutase(15Flores S.C. Marecki J.C. Harper K.P. Bose S.K. Nelson S.K. McCord J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Herzenberg L.A. Lancet. 1992; 339: 909-912Abstract PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Attenuation of manganese superoxide dismutase results in accumulation of reactive oxygen species, which has been demonstrated to induce cellular proliferation(15Flores S.C. Marecki J.C. Harper K.P.

Res. 1992; 70: 593-599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since oxidative stress, heat shock, and serum starvation responses overlap (51Jornot L. Mirault M.E. Junod A.F. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1991; 5: 265-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 52Wu B.J. Morimoto R.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6070-6074Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 53Sorger P.K.

Growth Factors. 1991; 4: 317-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), the role of TAT as a stress inducer for the secretion of FGF-1 was examined in vitro. Several lines of evidence provide a compelling argument that TAT-induced cellular growth may include not only increased synthesis of FGF-1 but also secretion of this polypeptide as a high molecular weight, noncovalent complex, an observation that may be relevant to the development and progression of AIDS-KS. To construct the plasmid pTAT (Fig. 1), the NarI/SalI fragment from pHIV/LTR-tat3, which contains the complete TAT coding sequence(5Vogel J. Hinrichs S.H. Reynolds R.K. Luciw P.A. Jay G. Nature. 1988; 335: 606-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar), was subcloned 3’ of the murine sarcoma virus LTR promoter and 5’ of the SV40 polyadenylation signal in the expression vector pMEXneo(55Martin-Zanca D. Oskam R. Mitra G. Copeland T. Barbacid M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 24-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). The pMEXneo plasmid (pMN) includes the neomycin phosphotransferase gene under control of the early SV40 promoter and served as a control for these experiments. To generate specific retroviral constructs (Fig. 1), the prokaryotic lacZ gene encoding β-galactosidase was cloned into pLNSX (56Bender M.A. Palmer T.D. Gelinas R.E. Miller A.D. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 1639-1646Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) following removal of the neomycin phosphotransferase gene, thereby generating the control vector, Bg. Construction of the synthetic human FGF-1 gene (amino acids 21-154) has been described and demonstrated to express active recombinant protein in prokaryotic systems(57Forough R. Engleka K. Thompson J.A. Jackson A. Imamura T. Maciag T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1090: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To construct the chimeric FGF-1 plasmid (Fig. 1), (hst/KS)FGF-1, two pairs of complementary, overlapping synthetic oligonucleotides were synthesized to generate an 89-bp linker that included sequences encoding the FGF-4 signal peptide(58Delli Bovi P. Curatola A.M. Kern F.G. Greco A. Ittmann M. Basilico C. Cell. 1987; 50: 729-737Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). The linker gatctttccgcagcagccgccaccATGTCGGGGCCGGGGACGGCGGCGTAGCGCTGCTCCCGGCCGTCCTGCTGGCCTTGCTGGCCCC contained squences for both an untranslated leader (lower case) and an open reading frame (upper case) coding for the hydrophobic signal peptide MSGPGTAAVALLPAVLLALLAP, which was fused in-frame to the NH2 termini (MANYKK …) of FGF-121-154. The untranslated leader sequence (lower case) of the linker included both potential ribosome binding (bold lettering) and Kozak (underlined) sequences for maximal eukaryotic translational efficiency(59Hagenbuchle O. Santer M. Steitz J.A. Mans R.J. Cell. 1978; 13: 551-563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 60Lawrence C.B. Jackson K.J. J. Mol.

Inclusion of these structural features, coupled with the truncated form of the growth factor, both prevented potential translation problems encountered previously in Escherichia coli(57Forough R. Engleka K. Thompson J.A. Jackson A. Imamura T. Maciag T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1090: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and permitted discrimination between the endogenous murine and the transduced human gene products. Accuracy of cloning was confirmed by restriction endonuclease mapping and/or DNA sequence analysis. Primary murine fibroblasts were isolated from day 12 C57BL/6 embryos (62Doetschman T.C. Eistetter H. Katz M. Schmidt W. Kemler R. J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1985; 87: 27-45PubMed Google Scholar) and established in culture using DMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated FBS (Hyclone Laboratories) and 100 units/100 εg penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Population doublings were monitored; only early, stabilized passages were used for these studies. Routine passage of isolated cells was performed at confluence following 0.05% trypsin, 0.5 M EDTA treatment and replating (1 × 104 cells/cm2). Primary cells (1 × 104/cm2) were transfected with 10 εg of either pMN or pTAT using calcium phosphate-mediated precipitation (63Wigler M. Sweet R. Sim G.K. Wold B. Pellicer A. Lacy E. Maniatis T. Silverstein S. Axel R. Cell. 1979; 16: 777-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar) followed by selection (21 days) in 800 εg/ml active Geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Transient transfection assays were performed in which 10 εg of an HIV-LTR-luciferase reporter plasmid (6Nabell L.M. Raja R.H. Sayeski P.P. Paterson A.J. Kudlow J.E. Cell Growth & Differ. 1994; 5: 87-93PubMed Google Scholar) was introduced into stable, expanded populations of either pMN or pTAT cells (1 × 106) using calcium phosphate-mediated precipitation. Cells were lysed 24 h post-transfection and reporter gene activity measured (Luciferase Assay System, Promega) using a Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory). The helper-free packaging cell line GP+envAm12 (64Markowitz D. Goff S. Bank A. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 1120-1124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was cotransfected with either Bg or (hst/KS)FGF-1 together with pCV108, a vector containing the early SV40 promoter directing neomycin phosphotransferase gene expression (10:1 molar ratio). Cells producing a high titer (106-107 colony-forming units/ml) of amphotrophic virus were isolated by β-galactosidase expression using FACS (65Nolan G.P. Fiering S. Nicholas J.F. Herzenberg L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2603-2607Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar) followed by selection (2-3 weeks) in 800 εg/ml active Geneticin. Viral titration was performed by determining the number of β-galactosidase-expressing colonies produced by transductions of 3T3 cells (56Bender M.A. Palmer T.D. Gelinas R.E. Miller A.D. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 1639-1646Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with serial dilutions of supernatant from the producer line. Expression of β-galactosidase was monitored (66Sanes J.R. Rubenstein J.L. Nicholas J.F. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 3133-3142Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar) with the chromogenic substrate Bluo-gal (Life Technologies, Inc.). Subconfluent (70-80%) primary murine fibroblasts were treated with retroviral particles (multiplicity of infection = 1-10) obtained from fresh (6 h) supernatant, conditioned by individual producer lines(67Anderson K.D. Thompson J.A. DiPietro J.M. Montgomery K.T. Reid L.M. Anderson W.F. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1989; 15: 215-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Transduced cells were isolated by FACS(65Nolan G.P. Fiering S. Nicholas J.F. Herzenberg L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2603-2607Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar), plated (5 × 103 cells/cm2), and expanded for subsequent analyses. Stably transfected and transduced cells (4 × 103/cm2) were seeded in fibronectin-coated (3 εg/cm2) 12-well plates (Corning) and grown in DMEM supplemented with either 10% or 0.5% FBS. Cells were washed (PBS) and fed every 3 days with fresh medium. Viable cells (trypan exclusion) for each transfectant/transductant were counted by hemacytometer at 3-day intervals, in duplicate, using five separate measurements/well. Lactate dehydrogenase release assays were used to evaluate cell death/damage according to the manufacturer's specifications (Promega). The simultaneous extraction of DNA and RNA was achieved as described(67Anderson K.D. Thompson J.A. DiPietro J.M. Montgomery K.T. Reid L.M. Anderson W.F. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1989; 15: 215-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Total RNA (1.0 εg) was converted to cDNA in a 50-εl reaction containing 2.5 εM oligo(dT)16, 0.5 mM dNTP, 1 mM DTT, 20 units of RNasin (Promega), and 400 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.), buffered with 75 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl2, and 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3. Following incubation (15 min, 40°C; 45 min, 37°C), samples were heated (5 min, 95°C) to inactivate reverse transcriptase. Either total genomic DNA (0.1 εg) or the reverse transcribed cDNA product (5 εl) was amplified (Perkin-Elmer 9600 Thermocycler) by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in a 50-εl reaction containing 0.75 εM sense and antisense primers, 0.5 mM dNTP, and 2.5 units Taq polymerase buffered with 50 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, and 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3. In each case the PCR mixture (50 εl) was aliquoted equally (25 εl) into two separate tubes and amplified for 28 and 35 cycles using the reaction conditions as follows: 94°C for 15 s, 56°C for 15 s, and 72°C for 2 min and 11 s. Synthetic DNA amplimers for the neomycin phosphotransferase gene were: sense, CAA GAT GGA TTG CAC GCA GG; antisense, CCC GCT CAG AAG AAC TCG TC. Synthetic DNA amplimers for TAT were: sense, GGC CTG GAT CTG GAG AGC AAG AAG AAA TGGACG C; antisense, CGG GCC TGT CGG GTC CCC TCG GGA CTG GGA GGC GGG. Synthetic DNA amplimers for β-galactosidase were: sense, GCG GTG CCG GAA AGC TGG CTG GAG TGC G; antisense, CCG CGA GGC GGT TTT CTC GGG CGC G. The sense amplimer for (hst/KS)FGF-1 contains the sequence GAT CTT TCC GCA GCA GCC GCC ACC, which is unique to the untranslated region of the transduced human gene, thereby discriminating from endogenous murine sequences. The sense amplimer specific for the full-length, endogenous murine FGF-11-154 contains the sequence ATG GCT GAA GGG GAA ATC AC (nucleotides 1-20). The antisense amplimer for both the endogenous murine FGF-11-154 and (hst/KS)FGF-1 genes contains the sequence GGC CAT AGT GAG TCC GAG GAC CGC G. Synthetic DNA amplimers for murine β-actin were: sense, GTG GGC CGC TCT AGG CAC CAA; antisense, CTC TTT GAT GTC ACG CAC GAT TTC. Both PCR and reverse transcriptase- PCR products were analyzed by 2% (w/v) agarose gel electrophoresis using amplification of specific expression vectors (Fig. 1) as positive controls. Accuracy of amplification was confirmed further by restriction endonuclease mapping of the PCR products. Nontransfected/transduced cellular DNA/RNA served as negative controls. In addition, reverse transcriptase-PCR performed in the absence of reverse transcriptase was used to determine the potential of contaminating genomic DNA in total RNA preparations. Following agarose gel electrophoresis, PCR products were stained with ethidium bromide and visualized with UV light. Photographs (Polaroid, type 55) of gels were digitized using a Xerox 7650 scanner and appropriate bands quantitated using NIH Image, version 1.58 (NIH, Bethesda, MD). Comparative analysis of specific reverse transcriptase-PCR products obtained from separate cell populations was achieved following standardization to levels of amplified β-actin mRNA from identical samples evaluated within the same gel.

https://openalex.org/W2005336461,"Abstract To investigate the function of the human Ras-related CDC42 GTP-binding protein (CDC42Hs) we studied its subcellular redistribution in platelets stimulated by thrombin-receptor activating peptide (TRAP) or ADP. In resting platelets CDC42Hs was detected exclusively in the membrane skeleton (9.6 ± 1.5% of total) and the detergent soluble fraction (90 ± 4%). When platelets were aggregated with TRAP or ADP, CDC42Hs (10% of total) appeared in the cytoskeleton and decreased in the membrane skeleton, whereas RhoGDI (guanine-nucleotide dissociation inhibitor) and CDC42HsGAP (GTPase-activating protein) remained exclusively in the detergent-soluble fraction. Upon prolonged platelet stimulation CDC42Hs disappeared from the cytoskeleton and reappeared in the membrane skeleton. Rac translocated to the cytoskeleton with a similar time course as CDC42Hs. When platelets were stimulated under conditions that precluded the activation of the αβ3 integrin and platelet aggregation, cytoskeletal association of CDC42Hs was abolished. Translocation of CDC42Hs to the cytoskeleton but not aggregation was also prevented by cytochalasins B or D or the protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein. Platelet secretion and thromboxane formation were not required but facilitated the cytoskeletal association of CDC42Hs. The results indicate that in platelets stimulated by TRAP or ADP, a fraction of CDC42Hs translocates from the membrane skeleton to the cytoskeleton. This process is reversible and is mediated by activation of the αβ3 integrin and subsequent actin polymerization and protein-tyrosine kinase stimulation. CDC42Hs might be a new component of a signaling complex containing specific cytoskeletal proteins and protein-tyrosine kinases that forms after activation of the αβ3 integrin in platelets."
https://openalex.org/W2077830713,"The amyloid β-protein (Aβ) is a major component of extracellular deposits that are characteristic features of Alzheimer's disease. Aβ is derived from the large transmembrane β-amyloid precursor protein (βAPP). In the rabbit optic nerve/optic tract (ON), βAPP is synthesized in vivo in retinal ganglion cell perikarya, rapidly transported into the ON axons in small transport vesicles and is subsequently transferred to the axonal plasma membrane as well as to the presynaptic nerve terminals (Morin, P. J., Abraham, C. R., Amaratunga, A., Johnson, R. J., Huber, G., Sandell, J. H., and Fine, R. E.(1993) J. Neurochem. 61, 464-473). Present results indicate that there is rapid processing of βAPP in the ON to generate a 14-kDa C-terminal membrane-associated fragment that contains the Aβ sequence. By using equilibrium sucrose density gradient fractionation, this fragment, as well as non-amyloidogenic C-terminal fragments and intact βAPP, are detected in at least two classes of transport vesicles destined for the plasma membrane and the presynaptic nerve terminal. The two classes of transported vesicles are distinguished by labeling kinetics as well as by density. In contrast to the ON, only non-amyloidogenic C-terminal fragments are generated in the retina, which contains the perikarya of retinal ganglion cells and glial (Muller) cells which also produce βAPP.

There are three major alternatively spliced transcripts of the βAPP gene that are 695, 751, and 770 amino acids long; the two larger forms contain a Kunitz-type protease inhibitor domain. A variety of post-translational modifications of βAPP have been characterized in cultured cells (reviewed in 33Selkoe D.J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 489-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar)). amyloid β-protein β-amyloid precursor protein optic nerve/optic tract phosphate-buffered saline N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. amyloid β-protein β-amyloid precursor protein optic nerve/optic tract phosphate-buffered saline N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. Mature βAPP can undergo proteolytic cleavage within the Aβ domain and this results in the secretion of soluble βAPP and a 9-12-kDa non-amyloidogenic fragment which remains membrane-bound (Selkoe et al., 1988; 29Schubert D.

Golde T.E. Ghiso J. Cheung T.T. Estus S. Shaffer L.M. Cai X.-D. McKay D.M. Tintner R. Frangione B. Younkin S.G. Science. 1992; 258: 126-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (1320) Google Scholar; 12Haass C.

Both neurons and astrocytes in cell culture also generate and secrete soluble Aβ (13Haass C. Schlossmacher M. Hung A. Vigo-Pelfrey C. Mellon A. Ostaszewski B. Lieberburg I. Koo E. Schenk D. Teplow D.

Anterograde axonal transport of neuronal βAPP in the central nervous system is likely to be a pathway by which Aβ is released to extracellular regions of brain, following its generation from βAPP. βAPP695 was shown to be the predominant form that is expressed in rat sensory ganglia and transported along the sciatic nerve (37Sisodia S.S. Koo E.H. Hoffman P.N. Perry G. Price D.L. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 3136-3142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; 37Sisodia S.S. Koo E.H. Hoffman P.N. Perry G. Price D.L. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 3136-3142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Employing a central nervous system neuron of rabbit, we demonstrated that βAPP695 as well as βAPP751/770 are synthesized in the retina; βAPP695 is rapidly transported in vivo into the optic nerve/optic tract (ON) in small vesicles and is subsequently transferred to a membrane fraction containing glucose transporters and other axonal plasma membrane markers, as well as to the presynaptic nerve terminals in the lateral geniculate (22Morin P.J. Abraham C.R. Amaratunga A. Johnson R.J. Huber G. Sandell J.H. Fine R.E. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 464-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Axonal transport of βAPP was also reported in the developing hamster ON where βAPP751/770 was the prominent form(s) detected in the lateral geniculate (23Moya K.L. Confaloni A. Allinquant B. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 1971-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Anterograde axonal transport of βAPP may occur via a kinesin based motor, as shown in cultured neurons (10Ferreira A. Caceres A. Kosik K.S. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 3112-3123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and in the ON in vivo (2Amaratunga A. Leeman S.E. Kosik K.S. Fine R.E. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 2374-2376Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Following transport to the plasma membrane, βAPP is degraded with a t of less than 5 h. Protease activity that can potentially generate amyloidogenic βAPP-derived peptides is also present in the same ON membrane fractions as βAPP (22Morin P.J. Abraham C.R. Amaratunga A. Johnson R.J. Huber G. Sandell J.H. Fine R.E. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 464-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In order to examine the generation of potentially amyloidogenic fragments of βAPP in the ON in vivo, we carried out a series of studies employing gel electrophoresis conditions capable of detecting small molecular weight fragments. In this report, we describe results indicating that there is rapid processing of βAPP695 in the ON to generate a C-terminal membrane-associated fragment that contains the Aβ sequence. This fragment, as well as non-amyloidogenic fragments and intact βAPP, are seen in regions of an equilibrium sucrose density gradient that contain axonal plasma membrane and at least two classes of transport vesicles, destined for the plasma membrane and axon terminal, respectively. This finding suggests that there is significant processing of βAPP to an amyloidogenic C-terminal-containing species before it reaches the axonal plasma membrane and the nerve terminal. We also report that in the retina, where βAPP751 and βAPP770 are also present, βAPP is processed differently from that which occurs in the ON, generating only non-amyloidogenic C-terminal fragments. Adult male albino rabbits (6 lb) were anesthetized with 1 ml of 5% sodium pentobarbital (intravenous), and two drops of 0.5% proparacaine HCL (topical). U-100 insulin syringes with 28-gauge needles are used to introduce 0.5 mCi (50 μl) of [35S]methionine/cysteine (DuPont NEN) into the vitreous chamber of each eye. All animal use procedures were in strict accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the local Animal Care Committee. Animals were sacrificed 3, 6, 9, or 12 h following radiolabel injection and retinas and ONs were dissected out. Tissues were homogenized in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (containing 30 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.5 μg/ml aprotinin) in a motor-driven Teflon glass homogenizer and centrifuged at 45,000 rpm for 1 h in a Ti 70 rotor. Pellets were resuspended in PBS and diluted 1:1 by adding 2 × immunomix (1.0% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.5% (v/v) deoxycholate, and 0.1% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) in PBS) for solubilization, followed by centrifuging at 25,000 rpm in a Ti 70 rotor for 10 min for clarification. The resulting solubilized membrane protein preparations were used for immune precipitations. Three- or 6-h post-35S-labeled ONs were dissected out (described above). Density gradient separations were carried out as described earlier (20Morin P.J. Liu N. Johnson R.J. Leeman S.E. Fine R.E. J. Neurochem. 1991; 56: 415-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 22Morin P.J. Abraham C.R. Amaratunga A. Johnson R.J. Huber G. Sandell J.H. Fine R.E. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 464-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Briefly, ONs were homogenized in 7 ml of ice-cold homogenization (H) buffer (1 mM triethanolamine, 320 mM sucrose), containing 30 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.5 μg/ml aprotinin). Homogenates were diluted to 40 ml with H buffer and centrifuged at 1,200 × g for 7 min. The resulting supernatant was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 2 ml of H buffer and loaded onto a discontinuous gradient consisting of 2 ml each of 20/26/31/37/45% sucrose (w/w) in H buffer. These gradients were centrifuged at 150,000 × g in a SW 40 rotor (Beckman) for 16 h. Twenty-four 0.5-ml fractions were collected from each gradient, and each fraction was assayed for protein and radioactivity to determine specific activity. Fractions containing the highest specific activities were pooled, diluted to 5 ml with PBS, and pelleted at 150,000 × g in an SW 50.1 rotor for 60 min. The pellets were resuspended in PBS, solubilized with immunomix and used for immune precipitations. Antibodies were added at appropriate dilutions to aliquots of equal volume and incubated overnight at 4°C (22Morin P.J. Abraham C.R. Amaratunga A. Johnson R.J. Huber G. Sandell J.H. Fine R.E. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 464-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Sepharose-linked anti-rabbit or anti-mouse immunoglobulin G beads (Organon Teknika) were then added to samples (15 μl of beads/1 μl of primary antibody) and incubated for 3 h at 4°C with agitation. Beads were separated in an Eppendorf centrifuge and washed five times using immunomix. Washed beads were suspended in SDS sample buffer and analyzed by 10-20% Tris-Tricine polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gels were incubated in an enhancing solution for 1 h, dried under vacuum for 2 h, and exposed to films. Rabbit sera made against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the C-terminal 20 amino acids of all isoforms of APP, C8 (31Selkoe D.J. Podlisny M.B. Joachim C.L. Vickers E.A. Lee G. Fritz L.C. Oltersdorf T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7341-7345Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar), and corresponding to 1-40 amino acids of Aβ, R1280 (39Tamaoka A. Kalaria R.N. Lieberburg I. Selkoe D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1345-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) (gifts of Dr. D. Selkoe), were used at dilutions of 1:1000 and 1:200, respectively. R1280 recognizes Aβ (4 kDa) peptide as well as a 3-kDa peptide starting at residue 16 of the Aβ near the secretory cleavage site of βAPP that ends near residue 40 (13Haass C. Schlossmacher M. Hung A. Vigo-Pelfrey C. Mellon A. Ostaszewski B. Lieberburg I. Koo E. Schenk D. Teplow D. Selkoe D. Nature. 1992; 359: 322-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (1757) Google Scholar). A monoclonal antibody specific to the N-terminal 17 amino acids of Aβ, 6E10 (18Kim K.S. Miller D.L. Sapienze V.J. Chang C.J. Grundke-Iqbal I. Currue J.R. Wisniewski H.M. Neurosci. Res. Commun. 1988; 2: 121-130Google Scholar), was used at a dilution of 1:300. Control experiments to determine nonspecific immune precipitations were carried out by using normal rabbit serum (Rockland Co.) and a monoclonal antibody against insulin-regulatable glucose transporter, 1F8, which is not found in brain (15James D.E. Lederman L. Pilch P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11817-11824Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Scanning of autoradiograms was performed by volume integration of protein bands using a densitometer (Molecular Dynamics). Direct determination of radioactive counts in dried gels was performed by using an instant imager (Packard). We have utilized the retinal ganglion cell/ON preparation combined with 10-20% Tris-Tricine gradient gels to detect Aβ containing βAPP-derived fragments in vivo of the [35S]methionine/cysteine-labeled ON. ON membranes were taken at various times after 35S injection, and aliquots were subjected to immune precipitation with either a C-terminal-recognizing antibody, C8, or with a polyclonal antibody against Aβ, R1280. As early as 3 h after 35S injection, a fragment with an apparent molecular mass of 14 kDa is specifically precipitated with both antibodies, whereas several other fragments are only detected with C8 (Fig. 1). The 14-kDa fragment precipitated by both antibodies is maximally labeled at 3 and 6 h following 35S injection and then disappears gradually at 9 and 12 h after injection. Of the C8-precipitated proteins, fragments of ∼12-16 kDa are detected at 3 h after 35S injection, and smaller fragments of ∼10-14 kDa are detected at 6 h, which also gradually disappear at later time points (Fig. 1). We also observe the full-length βAPP695 (molecular mass of ∼110 kDa) at all these times but a considerably lesser amount at 12 h. It is expected that the cleaved N-terminal fragments are present in the soluble fraction of our ON preparation and therefore should only be recognized by antibodies against the βAPP N terminus. Consistent with this expectation, we have not observed any C-terminal fragments released into the soluble fraction of ON by using C8 and R1280 (data not shown). We have previously demonstrated that in the rabbit ON in vivo, there are at least three types of anterograde rapidly transported vesicles, two types of synaptic vesicle precursors, one for classic transmitters (small, light vesicles) and one for peptides (large, dense vesicles), and a small, light vesicle that carries plasma membrane proteins to the axonal and presynaptic nerve terminal plasma membrane (20Morin P.J. Liu N. Johnson R.J. Leeman S.E. Fine R.E. J. Neurochem. 1991; 56: 415-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In the rabbit ON in vivo, βAPP695 was shown to be anterogradely axonally transported in small vesicles of the plasma membrane type (22Morin P.J. Abraham C.R. Amaratunga A. Johnson R.J. Huber G. Sandell J.H. Fine R.E. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 464-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We have subfractionated the 35S-labeled membranes into the three major membrane containing peaks as described earlier (20Morin P.J. Liu N. Johnson R.J. Leeman S.E. Fine R.E. J. Neurochem. 1991; 56: 415-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 1Amaratunga A. Morin P.J. Kosik K.S. Fine R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17427-17430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At 3-h post-injected ON, we detect 10-14-kDa fragments in peaks 1 (light fraction) and 2 (intermediate fraction) in the gradient, which correspond to the plasma membrane, and small transport vesicles destined for the plasma membrane and the nerve terminal, respectively (Fig. 2). According to previous results, peak 3 (dense fraction) shows delayed transport kinetics and contains substance P/K containing dense transport vesicles destined for the nerve terminal (21Morin P.J. Johnson R.J. Shachar I. Leeman S.E. Fine R.E. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1991; 632: 442-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 23Moya K.L. Confaloni A. Allinquant B. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 1971-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In 6-h post-injected ON, in addition to peaks 1 and 2, peak 3 also contains C-terminal fragments (Fig. 2). The full-length βAPP695 is present in all three peaks at 3 h as well as at 6 h. We also carried out immune precipitation of βAPP and its C-terminal fragments from the 35S-labeled retina. 35S-Labeled amino acids injected into the vitreous of the eye can be utilized by retinal ganglion cells as well as by Muller glial cells, which send their processes to the ganglion cell layer (23Moya K.L. Confaloni A. Allinquant B. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 1971-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Previous results indicate that the synthesis of βAPP695 (molecular mass, ∼110 kDa) as well as βAPP isoforms containing the Kunitz-type protease inhibitor domain occurs in the retina (23Moya K.L. Confaloni A. Allinquant B. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 1971-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). A sizable amount of a ∼12-kDa C-terminal fragment is produced in the membrane fraction of retina at 3 h (Fig. 3) and also at 6 h (data not shown) following 35S injection. This fragment does not appear to be amyloidogenic as indicated by the inability of R1280 to precipitate this component (Fig. 3). We examined the possibility that the recognition of C-terminal fragments by the antibody C8 may be due to the metabolism of APPLP2, a recently cloned βAPP-like protein. APPLP2 is highly homologous to βAPP at the C terminus, but does not contain the extracellular Aβ sequence (38Slunt H.H. Thinakaran G. Van Koch G. Lo A.C.Y. Tanzi R.E. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2637-2644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When a monoclonal antibody specific for the N-terminal 17 amino acids of Aβ, 6E10, was used in immune precipitations, a 14-kDa fragment was detected only in the ON and not in the retina (Fig. 4). This confirms that the 14-kDa fragment is derived from βAPP as well as containing the entire Aβ sequence. We compared the C8 and 6E10 immune-precipitated protein bands shown in Fig. 4 by quantitating radioactive counts in the gel of the 110-kDa band and by densitometric analysis of the 14-kDa band. With respect to the 110-kDa species, 6E10 immune-precipitated 86% of that precipitated by C8 (Fig. 4). Although at present no data are available on the expression of APPLP2 in the rabbit retinal ganglion cell, this result may suggest that βAPP is the predominant APP form that is axonally transported in the ON. With respect to the 14-kDa fragment, 6E10 precipitated 77% of that precipitated by C8 (Fig. 4), thereby indicating that this fragment is produced predominantly by the cleavage of βAPP to generate a fragment containing the entire Aβ sequence. The results presented have demonstrated that there is a rapid (<3 h) metabolism of the retinal ganglion cell produced βAPP in the ON to generate a C-terminal 14-kDa fragment containing the Aβ sequence. This fragment is a likely precursor to Aβ (7Dyrks T. Dyrks E. Monning U. Urmoneit B. Turner J. Beyreuther K. FEBS Lett. 1993; 335: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), although we have no evidence as yet that Aβ is produced in this system in vivo. It is possible that in this system the incorporation of 35S into Aβ, which has only one methionine residue and no cysteine, might be insufficient for detecting Aβ. The cell type which produces Aβ in the central nervous system is not known, and it is also possible that the retinal ganglion cells do not produce Aβ. However, the amyloidogenic fragment(s) is metabolized fairly rapidly, since it disappears by 12 h after labeling (Fig. 1). This is to be expected, since there is evidence that overproduction of a C-terminal Aβ-containing fragment in transfected cells can produce neurotoxicity when these cells are differentiated into neuron-like cells (17Kammesheidt A. Boyce F.M. Spanogannis A.F. Cummings B.J. Ortegon M. Cotman C. Vaught J.L. Neve R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10857-10861Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The 12-kDa C-terminal fragment recognized only by C8 may be produced by an α-secretase that cleaves within the Aβ sequence to generate a C-terminal fragment containing the transmembrane portion and cytoplasmic domain (31Selkoe D.J. Podlisny M.B. Joachim C.L. Vickers E.A. Lee G. Fritz L.C. Oltersdorf T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7341-7345Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). It is possible that in this system R1280 precipitates only the 14-kDa amyloidogenic C-terminal fragment. The nondetection of a 12-kDa fragment by R1280 may be due to the fact that R1280 appears to be a weak immune-precipitating antibody consistent with peptide antibodies against the Aβ region of βAPP (39Tamaoka A. Kalaria R.N. Lieberburg I. Selkoe D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1345-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), compared with C8 and 6E10. When simultaneously used in equal aliquots of an ON membrane preparation, R1280 precipitated only 14% of the 110-kDa species precipitated by C8 (Fig. 1). Since over 80% of the C8-precipitated 110-kDa species is βAPP (Fig. 4), this shows that R1280 precipitates only a minor fraction of intact βAPP. Therefore, it is possible that the detection of the 12-kDa fragment by R1280 was beyond the limit of sensitivity. We also simultaneously detect other C-terminal fragments that are not recognized by R1280 (Fig. 1) and 6E10 (Fig. 4). The cleavage of APPLP2 could generate these fragments, which are recognized by C8 (38Slunt H.H. Thinakaran G. Van Koch G. Lo A.C.Y. Tanzi R.E. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2637-2644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If it is assumed that both βAPP and APPLP2 are expressed in the rabbit retinal ganglion cell, then APPLP2 represents less than one-fifth of the total that is axonally transported (Fig. 4). Therefore, it is unlikely that the C-terminal fragments recognized exclusively by C8 are generated entirely from APPLP2. Using an equilibrium sucrose gradient, we were able to fractionate βAPP-derived C-terminal fragments in the ON into three separate membrane compartments (Fig. 2) (22Morin P.J. Abraham C.R. Amaratunga A. Johnson R.J. Huber G. Sandell J.H. Fine R.E. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 464-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). At 3 h following 35S injection, some βAPP has already reached the axonal plasma membrane (peak 1) and C-terminal fragments are also detected in this fraction (Fig. 2). The observation of C-terminal fragments (and βAPP) in peak 2 indicates that βAPP processing to generate C-terminal fragments occurs within transport vesicles bound for the axonal plasma membrane. The fact that protease activity specific for the generation of amyloidogenic fragments from βAPP has been co-localized in peak 2 vesicles (22Morin P.J. Abraham C.R. Amaratunga A. Johnson R.J. Huber G. Sandell J.H. Fine R.E. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 464-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) further supports this possibility. Also in PC12 cells, βAPP cleavage was shown to occur intracellularly following glycosylation and sulfation within the vesicles that transport proteins to the plasma membrane (27Sambamurti K. Shioi J. Anderson J.P. Pappolla M.A. Robakis N.K. J. Neurosci. Res. 1992; 33: 319-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). It is likely that βAPP-containing vesicles bound for the plasma membrane (peak 2) consist of a subpopulation of small, light vesicles, as was shown to be the case for glucose transporter-containing vesicles (Morin et al., 1991a). Also, immune staining experiments did not co-localize βAPP and synaptic vesicle markers in the same vesicles (Schubert et al., 1991; Ferreira et al., 1993; Caporaso et al., 1994) It is possible that fragments observed in peaks 1 and 2 of 3-h post-labeled ON (Fig. 2) could be derived from internalization of βAPP from the plasma membrane into an endosome-lysosome-like compartment (12Haass C. Koo E. Mellon A. Hung A. Selkoe D. Nature. 1992; 357: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar; 11Golde T.E. Estus S. Younkin L. Selkoe D. Younkin S. Science. 1992; 255: 728-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). This is supported by the fact that intact βAPP is detected in the plasma membrane fraction (peak 1) (Fig. 2). Immune staining in cultured neurons indicated βAPP to be associated with clathrin-coated vesicles and endosome-like vesicles, some of which may be involved in retrograde transport (10Ferreira A. Caceres A. Kosik K.S. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 3112-3123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; 6Caporaso G.L. Takei K. Gandy S.E. Matteoli M. Mundigl O. de Camilli P. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 3122-3128Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Also, βAPP has been localized within clathrin-coated vesicles in mammalian brain (28Sapirstein V.S. Durrie R. Berg M.J. Marks N. J. Neurosci. Res. 1994; 37: 348-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, clathrin-coated vesicles are much too dense to be present in this region of the 20-45% gradient used in these experiments. In cultured cells, amyloidogenic fragments as well as Aβ appear to be generated within an acidic compartment in the secretory pathway (35Shoji M. Golde T.E. Ghiso J. Cheung T.T. Estus S. Shaffer L.M.

Chem. 1993; 268: 3021-3024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Axonal endosomes appear not to be acidified until reaching the cell body, making it unlikely that proteolysis in endosomes occurs to any great extent in the axon (4Augenbraun E. Maxfield F.R. Robert S.J. Setlik W. Holtzman E. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 61: 34-43PubMed Google Scholar). It is, however, likely that the axonal secretory vesicles are acidified as are other secretory vesicles (3Anderson R. Pathak R.K. Cell. 1985; 40: 635-643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). In 6-h post-labeled ON, C-terminal fragments are detected in both peaks 2 and 3 (Fig. 2), thereby indicating intracellular βAPP processing in two classes of vesicles of different densities bound for the nerve terminal. The peak 2 fraction at 6 h contains transport vesicles carrying plasma membrane proteins as well as small synaptic vesicle precursors (22Morin P.J. Abraham C.R. Amaratunga A. Johnson R.J. Huber G. Sandell J.H. Fine R.E. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 464-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The peak 3 fraction at 6 h contains dense neuropeptide (substance P/K) containing vesicles (20Morin P.J. Liu N. Johnson R.J. Leeman S.E. Fine R.E. J. Neurochem. 1991; 56: 415-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 21Morin P.J. Johnson R.J. Shachar I. Leeman S.E. Fine R.E. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1991; 632: 442-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The possibility that βAPP and substance P/K are co-localized in these dense vesicles is suggested by immune localization results (30Schubert W. Prior R. Weidemann A. Dircksen H. Multhaup G. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Brain Res. 1991; 563: 184-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), in which case they would be bound for the nerve terminal. It is also possible that βAPP is localized in a separate class of dense vesicle which is bound for the plasma membrane. In conclusion with regard to βAPP processing in the transport vesicles, the data strongly support the possibility that axonally transported βAPP695 is processed intracellularly to generate C-terminal fragments in at least two classes of vesicle, which are distinguished by labeling kinetics as well as by density. These vesicles are bound for both axonal plasma membrane and nerve terminal. In contrast with the ON, in which both amyloidogenic and non- amyloidogenic C-terminal fragments are produced, we only detect the production of a non-amyloidogenic C-terminal fragment in the retina (Figure 3:, Figure 4:). The two cell types in the retina which produce βAPP are the retinal ganglion cells that produce βAPP695 (and rapidly axonally transport it) and the Muller glial cells that produce the Kunitz-type protease inhibitor-containing βAPP isoforms, βAPP751 and βAPP770, as well (22Morin P.J. Abraham C.R. Amaratunga A. Johnson R.J. Huber G. Sandell J.H. Fine R.E. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 464-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Also, cultured rabbit Muller cells synthesize 120- and 140-kDa species of βAPP, corresponding to βAPP751 and βAPP770, respectively.2 2A. Amaratunga, C. R. Abraham, R. B. Edwards, J. H. Sandell, B. M. Shreiber and R. E. Fine, submitted for publication. Because of the rapid clearance of neuronally produced βAPP into the ON (22Morin P.J. Abraham C.R. Amaratunga A. Johnson R.J. Huber G. Sandell J.H. Fine R.E. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 464-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), it is likely that the retinal non-amyloidogenic C-terminal metabolite is produced in the Muller cell. Therefore, this result may indicate differential processing of βAPP with respect to the central nervous system cell type and/or to the βAPP isoform. This result also suggests that in the normal central nervous system, only neurons are capable of generating amyloidogenic fragments. This is in contrast to the reported results that cultured astrocytes, which are similar in certain ways to Muller cells, produce more Aβ than cultured neurons (5Busciglio J. Gabuzda D.H. Matsudaira P. Yankner B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2092-2096Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). The above results may help to elucidate the normal processing of βAPP in vivo in a central nervous system neuron. In contrast to rat and mouse, the Aβ sequence of the rabbit is identical to that of human (16Johnstone E. Chuney M. Norris F. Pascual R. Little S. Mol. Brain. Res. 1991; 10: 299-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), making it a more appropriate system to study βAPP processing. We thank Dr. Peter Morin, Dr. Robin Johnson, and Hae Yung Pyun for their invaluable advice and assistance."

The specificity of six mAbs were investigated by antibody binding to native or recombinant forms (rML) of MMGL, flow cytometry, and immunoprecipitation using a macrophage cell line RAW264.7. Four of these mAbs strongly inhibited the binding of fluorescein 5-isothiocyanate-labeled galactosylated polylysine to immobilized rML, one inhibited moderately, and one did not inhibit binding. The competitive binding study revealed that the binding sites of these four blocking mAbs were closely related to each other but were different from the rest of these mAbs. A non-blocking mAb having a unique binding specificity (LOM-11) exhibited calcium-dependent binding to rML, suggesting that calcium-dependent epitope was not situated in the vicinity of the ligand binding site. Furthermore, pretreatment of rML with the mAb LOM-11 preserved ligand binding activity, especially in a low calcium environment. The four blocking mAbs mentioned above facilitated the binding of the mAb LOM-11 to rML. These results indicate that there is a positive cooperativity between the lectin's ligand binding site and its physically distinct calcium-dependent epitope.

Diverse structures of cell surface glycoconjugates on a variety of cell types have recently been postulated to be a biological basis for the specificity of cell to cell interactions. Evidence for this has been provided by investigations of selectins and their specific carbohydrate ligands(1Lowe J.B. Stoolman L.M. Nair R.P. Larsen R.D. Berhend T.L. Marks R.M.

Such interactions play an essential role in the process of leukocyte-vascular endothelial cell-adhesive interaction during inflammation and in other physiological mechanisms such as lymphocyte homing. In addition to the physiological standpoints, pathological studies revealed that certain carbohydrate determinants are recognized as tumor markers with prognostic and diagnostic values(8Springer G.F. Mol. Immunol. 1989; 26: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 9Itzkowitz S.H. Bloom E.J. Kokal W.A. Modin G. Hakomori S. Kim Y.S.

To understand the biological roles of the expression of diverse carbohydrate structures, the study of intrinsic carbohydrate recognition molecules (or animal lectins) is one of the most important subjects to elucidate. In mammals, two major categories of lectins have been recognized(11Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9557-9560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One such group is calcium-dependent (or calcium-type) lectins, which includes selectins and a variety of cell surface molecules found on macrophages (12-15) and NK cells(16Yokoyama W.M. Jacobs L.B. Kanagawa O. Shevach E.M. Cohen D.I. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 1379-1386PubMed Google Scholar, 17Giorda R. Rudert W.A. Vavassori C. Chambers W.H. Hiserodt J.C. Trucco M.

Some of the lectins on macrophages and NK cells have been reported to participate in recognition mechanisms involved in natural immunity such as immunosurveillance against tumor cells(19Oda S. Sato M. Toyoshima S. Osawa T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1989; 105: 1040-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 20Karlhofer F. Ribaudo R.K. Yokoyama W.E.

Cancer Res. 1994; 85: 744-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, the way in which the ability of calcium-type lectins to recognize specific carbohydrates relates to their biological roles on macrophages and NK cells has not been determined. Recent studies have revealed a considerable diversity of macrophages depending on their tissue location and differentiation stage. Clear evidence for such diversity has been provided by the development of a variety of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs)1( 1The abbreviations used are: mAbmonoclonal antibodyABTS2,2′azinobis-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonate)ELISAsolid phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assayFITC-Gal-PLLFITC-labeled galactosylated poly-L-lysineMMGLmouse macrophage galactose/N-acetylgalactosamine-specific calcium-type lectinrMLrecombinant MMGLMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acidBSAbovine serum albuminFITCfluorescein 5-isothiocyanatePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. )specific for certain tissue macrophages (reviewed in Ref. 22). In addition to the studies with mAbs, tissue type-selective expression of macrophage calcium-type lectins has also been recognized(23Haltiwanger R.S. Hill R.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1986; 261: 7433-7439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Among these molecules, a galactose/N-acetylgalactosamine-specific calcium-type lectin (termed MMGL) has been characterized from mouse and rat peritoneal exudate macrophages(13Ii M. Kurata H. Itoh N. Yamashina I. Kawasaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11295-11298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Sato M. Kawakami K. Osawa T. Toyoshima S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 111: 331-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This molecule has been suggested to be involved in tumor cell recognition by macrophages (19Oda S. Sato M. Toyoshima S.

To gain further insight into the biological functions of MMGL, it would be of great importance to produce mAbs whose binding sites are related to the carbohydrate binding activity of the calcium-type lectin. Toward this end, we have previously established a simple solid phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based method for quantitatively measuring lectin activity of MMGL (ligand binding assay) (25Imai Y. Irimura T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1994; 171: 23-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In the present report, we describe development of mAbs directed against MMGL and their characterization by means of the ligand binding assay, which represents a novel strategy for screening mAbs against calcium-type lectins. We also discovered a distinct calcium-dependent epitope on MMGL, physically separated from the carbohydrate binding site. The significance of this epitope in the regulation of the molecular function of this molecule was also investigated. MOPS, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pepstatin A, aprotinin, Triton X-100, polyethylene glycol (Hybrimax), oxaloacetate/pyruvate/bovine insulin-media supplement (OPI-Media supplement), biotinamidocaproate N-hydroxysuccinimide ester, N-hydroxysuccinimidobiotin, and biotin-conjugated monoclonal anti-rat κ and γ light chains were purchased from Sigma; EDTA, CHAPS, Tween 20, EGTA, HEPES, and GIT serum-free medium were from Wako Pure Chemical (Tokyo); recombinant protein G-Sepharose 4B (20 mg of human IgG/ml of beads capacity), peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG (H+L), Rat MonoAB ID/SP kit, and peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin were from Zymed Laboratories Inc.

(Burlingame, CA). Galactose-Sepharose 4B was prepared by coupling of lactose to amino-derivatized Sepharose 4B beads by reductive amination according to published methods(26Baues R.J. Gray G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 57-60Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Matsumoto I. Mizuno Y. Seno N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1979; 85: 1091-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). A soluble recombinant form of MMGL (rML) was purified from Escherichia coli transformed with cDNA containing extracellular domains of MMGL as described by Sato et al. (15Sato M. Kawakami K. Osawa T. Toyoshima S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 111: 331-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). A rabbit anti-rML polyclonal antiserum and FITC-labeled galactosylated polylysine (FITC-Gal-PLL) were produced as previously described(25Imai Y. Irimura T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1994; 171: 23-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). A penicillin-treated, lyophilized preparation of the Su-strain of Streptococcus pyogenes, OK-432, was kindly provided from Chugai Pharmaceuticals (Tokyo). A mouse macrophage cell line RAW264.7, a rat myeloma cell line Y3-Ag 1.2.3 (28Galfrè G. Milstein C. Wright B. Nature. 1979; 277: 131-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), and a hybridoma cell line M1/9.3.4.HL.2 (anti-CD45, or anti-leukocyte common antigen, IgG2a) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Nissui Pharmaceutical, Tokyo) containing 4.5 g/liter glucose, 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Bioproducts, Inc., Walkersville, MD), 100 units/ml benzylpenicillin potassium (Wako Pure Chemical, Tokyo), and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate (Sigma) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air at 37°C. Peritoneal exudate macrophages elicited by OK-432 were prepared from ICR mice (Charles River Japan Inc., Tokyo) as described(19Oda S. Sato M. Toyoshima S. Osawa T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1989; 105: 1040-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). RAW264.7 cells (109) were extracted with 30 ml of lysis buffer (20 mM MOPS (pH 7.0), 0.15 M NaCl, 20 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.02% NaN3, 1% Triton X-100, 0.3 μM aprotinin, 3 μM pepstatin A, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The extract, precleared with 20 ml of Bio-Gel P-100 (Bio-Rad), was added to a 20-ml galactose-Sepharose 4B beads equilibrated in buffer A (20 mM MOPS (pH 7.0), 0.5 M NaCl, 20 mM CaCl2, 0.02% NaN3) containing 0.1% Triton X-100 (buffer A-Triton), and the suspension was continuously mixed for 18 h at 4°C. The beads were washed in a column with 400 ml of buffer A-Triton, and the bound material was eluted in 100 ml of 20 mM MOPS (pH 7.0), 0.5 M NaCl, 10 mM EDTA (buffer B) containing 0.1% Triton X-100. After restoration of calcium (final concentration of 20 mM), the eluted fraction was subjected to a second cycle of affinity purification (10 ml of packed galactose-Sepharose 4B beads). The column was washed with 200 ml of buffer A-Triton and then with 50 ml of buffer A (containing 10 mM CHAPS) for buffer change. The bound material was eluted in 50 ml of buffer B containing 10 mM CHAPS and 0.02% NaN3. After calcium restoration, concentration (to 100 μl) and buffer change (to 20 mM MOPS, 0.15 M NaCl, 20 mM CaCl2, 10 mM CHAPS) of the eluates were carried out using the Centriprep-30 and Centricon-30 (Amicon, Beverly, MA). The concentrated preparation was divided into aliquots and stored at −80°C. 5 μl of the preparation (5 × 107 cell equivalents) were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE, 10% acrylamide) under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 1). F344/DuCrj (Fischer) rat (Charles River Japan Inc., Tokyo) was subcutaneously immunized with 2.4 μg of purified MMGL in complete Freund's adjuvant. 1 month later, a second immunization with 3.8 μg of purified MMGL in incomplete Freund's adjuvant was given to the same rat, followed by an intraperitoneal booster injection of 100 μg of rML 4 days before fusion. Splenocytes of the immunized rat were fused with rat myeloma cells (Y3-Ag 1.2.3) at a 2:1 cell ratio. Cell suspensions were distributed into wells of 96-well plates (8.7 × 104 spleen cell equivalents/well) in hypoxanthine aminopterin thymidine-containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum and OPI-Media supplement and were cultured for 8 days. Cells in wells of interest were subjected to limiting dilution for cloning in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum and OPI-Media supplement. The screening of hybridoma cells and clones was carried out based on four criteria used to evaluate the supernatant of each well: 1) its binding activity to immobilized native MMGL purified from RAW 264.7 cells, 2) its binding activity to immobilized rML, 3) its inhibitory activity against the binding of FITC-Gal-PLL (a synthetic multivalent ligand) to immobilized rML (ligand binding assay) as previously described(25Imai Y. Irimura T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1994; 171: 23-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and 4) flow-cytometric analyses of antibody binding to RAW264.7 cells. Native MMGL was adsorbed overnight at 4°C on wells of an ELISA plate (655061, Greiner, Germany) by adding 10 μl of purified MMGL (2.5 ng) dissolved in buffer C (20 mM MOPS (pH 7.0), 0.15 M NaCl, 20 mM CaCl2) containing 5 mM CHAPS to each well containing 90 μl of buffer C. Adsorption of rML onto ELISA plate wells was carried out by adding 100 μl of rML solution (2.5 μg/ml in buffer C containing 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol) to each well. After blocking of the wells using 3% BSA in buffer C (containing glutathione, 100 μM reduced, 10 μM oxidized) for 2 h at room temperature, hybridoma cell culture supernatants or purified mAbs diluted in buffer D (20 mM MOPS (pH 7.0), 0.15 M NaCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 0.1% Tween 20) containing glutathione and 1% BSA were added. In some experiments, rML-coated wells (coated and blocked in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (containing 0.91 mM CaCl2, 0.49 mM MgCl2) instead of buffer C) were preincubated with 50 μl of buffer D containing 1% BSA (buffer D-1% BSA) with or without 20 mM EGTA for 30 min at room temperature, and then 50 μl of buffer D-1% BSA containing varying concentrations of purified mAbs were added to each well. After incubation for 1 h at room temperature, the wells were washed in buffer D to remove unbound mAbs, and then 100 μl of peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG (H+L) (diluted 1/2000 in buffer D-1% BSA) were added to detect bound antibody. After 1 h of incubation at room temperature, the wells were washed in buffer D and then received substrate solution (100 μl of 1 mM ABTS dissolved in 0.1 M sodium citrate (pH 4.2) mixed with H2O2 (1/1000 final dilution of 34% stock solution) just before use). Absorbance readings were measured at 405 nm in a microplate reader (MTP-12, Corona Electric, Ibaragi, Japan). In the case of the ligand binding assay(25Imai Y. Irimura T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1994; 171: 23-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), rML-coated wells received 75 μl of a solution containing hybridoma cell culture supernatant or varying concentrations of purified mAbs diluted in buffer D-1% BSA containing glutathione (buffer D (+glutathione)-1% BSA). For an EGTA control, 75 μl of 10 mM EGTA in 20 mM MOPS (pH 7.0), 0.15 M NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20 (buffer E) containing glutathione and 1% BSA (buffer E (+glutathione)-1% BSA) were added to an ELISA plate well. After incubation for 30 min at 4°C, each well received 25 μl of FITC-Gal-PLL (2 μg/ml in buffer E with glutathione and 1% BSA) solution and was then incubated for 1 h at 4°C. The binding of FITC-Gal-PLL was detected by 1 h of incubation of ELISA plates at room temperature with 100 μl of peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-FITC (diluted 1/500 in buffer D-1% BSA) in each well. In some experiments, rML-coated wells received 100 μl of buffer D (+glutathione)-1% BSA with or without varying concentrations of purified mAb LOM-11 or LOM-14 and were incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The wells were washed three times in buffer D and then three times in an appropriate calcium-EDTA buffer modified from buffer E (specified in the legend for Fig. 7) or buffer D to remove unbound antibodies. Then, each well was incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 100 μl of varying concentrations of FITC-Gal-PLL in the corresponding calcium-EDTA buffer (+glutathione)-1% BSA to measure ligand binding or with calcium-EDTA buffer (+glutathione)-1% BSA or buffer D (+glutathione)-1% BSA alone to measure the effect of exposure to calcium-EDTA buffer on mAb binding. The wells were washed three times in the corresponding calcium-EDTA buffer or buffer D, followed by washing in buffer D three more times. The binding of ligands or mAbs was detected as described above. In the mAb competition experiments, rML-coated wells received 50 μl of varying concentrations of mAb (hybridoma culture supernatant) diluted in buffer D-1% BSA. After a 30-min incubation at room temperature, 50 μl of biotin-conjugated mAb LOM-8.7 (0.6 μg/ml) or biotin-conjugated mAb LOM-11 (1 μg/ml) in buffer D-1% BSA were added to each well. The binding of the biotinylated mAbs was detected by 1 h of incubation at room temperature with 100 μl of peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (1/500 dilution in buffer D-1% BSA). Subclass of mAbs was determined by a kit based on an ELISA method (Rat MonoAB ID/SP kit) following the manufacturer's instructions. RAW264.7 cells (106 cells) were stained on ice for 30 min in 100 μl of buffer F (Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% BSA and 0.1% NaN3) containing hybridoma cell culture supernatant (1/2 dilution) or purified mAb (10 μg/ml). RAW264.7 cells were subsequently stained with biotin-conjugated monoclonal anti-rat κ and γ light chains (1/200 dilution in buffer F), followed by staining with fluorescein-avidin DCS (1/100 dilution in buffer F), and then analyzed on a flow cytometer (Cyto ACE-150, Jasco Co., Tokyo). Culture supernatant was obtained in the form of GIT serum-free medium supplemented with 200 mML-glutamine, 0.1 mM minimal essential medium non-essential amino acids solution (Life Technologies, Inc.), 14.5 μg/ml L-cystein solution (NCTC-109, Life Technologies, Inc.) plus 100 units/ml benzylpenicillin potassium and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2, 95% air at 37°C. Antibodies were precipitated from supernatants by 60% saturation with ammonium sulfate and were dialyzed against Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline and then against 50 mM sodium-phosphate buffer (pH 7.2). The dialysate was applied to a column of recombinant protein-G Sepharose 4B in the same buffer. The mAbs were eluted with 200 mM acetic acid and immediately neutralized with 1 M Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.5). Aliquots of mAbs were biotinylated using biotinamidocaproate N-hydroxysuccinimide ester following a standard procedure(29Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: a Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). The molar ratio between biotinylation reagent and mAb was 3:1. Cell surface proteins were biotinylated according to a published procedure(30Miyake K. Weissman I.L. Greenberger J.S. Kincade P.W. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 173: 599-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Briefly, N-hydroxysuccinimidobiotin (100 μg/ml in ME2SO) was added to RAW264.7 cells (107 cells/ml) suspended in 100 mM HEPES (pH 8.0), 0.15 M NaCl. After 40 min of incubation at room temperature, cells were washed three times with 10 mM HEPES, 0.15 M NaCl, and 1 mM CaCl2 (pH 7.2) and extracted with the lysis buffer at a concentration of 5 × 107 cells/ml. The lysate (1.8 ml) was subjected to three cycles of preclearing with 50 μl each of recombinant protein G-Sepharose 4B beads adsorbed with normal rat serum (0.5 μl of serum to 250 μl of packed beads). Aliquots (215 μl) of the extract were incubated for 2 h at 4°C with 10 μl of recombinant protein G-Sepharose 4B beads that had been conjugated with a rat anti-MMGL mAb (1.4 ml of hybridoma culture supernatant), a rabbit anti-rML antiserum (2.8 μl of serum), or a rat anti-CD45 mAb (1.4 ml of supernatant). The beads were extensively washed with the lysis buffer, boiled in 20 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer (62.5 mM Tris (pH 6.8), 2% (w/v) SDS, 10% (v/v) glycerol), and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (10% acrylamide) under nonreducing conditions. Proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore Corp., Tokyo). Biotinylated proteins were stained with peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (1/1500 in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20) and detected with the ECL system (Amersham Int'l. Ltd., United Kingdom) according to the manufacturer's protocol. SDS-PAGE protein reference standards (phosphorylase b, BSA, aldolase, carbonic anhydrase) were obtained from Daiichi Pure Chemicals (Tokyo). Hybridomas were produced by fusion between Y3-Ag1.2.3 rat myeloma cells and fresh spleen cells from a rat immunized with native MMGL purified from a mouse macrophage cell line, RAW264.7. The purity of immunogen is demonstrated in Fig. 1. Hybridoma culture supernatants were screened for antibody production against native or recombinant forms of MMGL and for inhibitory activity against binding of FITC-Gal-PLL (ligand) to rML. Hybridomas of interest were subjected to cell cloning and subcloning by limiting dilution. Two blocking mAbs (LOM-4.9 and LOM-4.7) were derived from the same well of the initial culture, and two others (LOM-8.7 and LOM-8.2) were both obtained from an additional well of that culture. LOM denotes “lectin on macrophages.” Additional mAbs LOM-14 and LOM-11 were established as antibodies with weak blocking activity against ligand binding. Immunoglobulin heavy chain subclass of mAbs was determined as IgG2a except for LOM-14, which was IgG2b. To determine efficiency in binding as well as the specificity of mAbs, each mAb was tested for its ability to immunoprecipitate MMGL from crude extract of biotinylated RAW264.7 cells. Each mAb specifically immunoprecipitated an approximately 42-kDa component (Fig. 2). The 42-kDa component was also seen in the precipitate produced by a rabbit anti-rML polyclonal antiserum (lane 1). A negative control (anti-CD45) mAb did not immunoprecipitate a 42-kDa component, but it did precipitate a ~200-kDa component that corresponded to the CD45 molecule. A lane of crude lysate (lane 9) showed a contiguous smear of biotinylated proteins even though the amount of lysate applied in this lane was less than one-tenth of the amount used for immunoprecipitation in the other lanes. An additional faint band of ~80 kDa was seen in the precipitates with LOM-8.7 and LOM-8.2, whereas a single 42-kDa component was seen in the precipitates with four other mAbs. The ability of mAbs to bind cell surface MMGL was tested by immunofluorescence staining of RAW264.7 cells. As demonstrated in Fig. 3, each mAb stained RAW264.7 cells significantly, though the staining intensity was variable among mAbs. The other sublines LOM-4.9 and LOM-8.2 also stained (data not shown). Each mAb significantly stained peritoneal exudate macrophages elicited by OK-432 (data not shown). The inhibitory effects of purified mAbs against the binding of FITC-Gal-PLL (ligand) to immobilized rML were quantitatively tested with simultaneous measurement of mAb binding to rML. The ligand binding was inhibited by EGTA, which was consistent with the characteristics of calcium-type lectin binding (Fig. 4). With increasing concentration of LOM-4.9, binding of this mAb to rML and inhibition of ligand binding were in an inverse relationship (Fig. 4a). A complete inhibition of ligand binding was achieved at the saturation level of this mAb. mAbs LOM-4.7 (Fig. 4b) and LOM-8.7 (Fig. 4c) also showed a similar dose response curve. The inhibitory effect of LOM-8.2 was less prominent, but 80% inhibition was seen at a concentration of 100 μg/ml (Fig. 4d). LOM-14, originated from an initial hybridoma cell culture supernatant with slight inhibitory activity (less than 24% inhibition at 1/4 dilution), displayed significant but less effective inhibition (40% inhibition at 100 μg/ml) than four other blocking mAbs (Fig. 4f). On the other hand, LOM-11 did not show significant inhibition despite the fact that a similar dose response curve was seen in its binding to rML (Fig. 4e). To know whether certain epitopes or antibody binding sites could be responsible for the characteristics of ligand binding inhibition, we examined competition between these mAbs in binding to rML. As shown in Fig. 5a, the binding of biotinylated LOM-8.7 was inhibited not only by (unlabeled) LOM-8.7 itself but also by LOM-4.7, which produced a dose response pattern identical to that of LOM-8.7. LOM-4.9 and LOM-8.2 also inhibited the binding of biotinylated LOM-8.7, exhibiting patterns similar to that for LOM-8.7 (data not shown). Neither LOM-14 nor LOM-11 inhibited the binding of biotinylated LOM-8.7. Very similar patterns of inhibition were observed when biotinylated LOM-4.7 was used for the experiment in place of biotinylated LOM-8.7 (data not shown). On the other hand, the binding of biotinylated LOM-11 was inhibited only by LOM-11 itself, and none of the other mAbs was inhibitory (Fig. 5b). The binding of biotinylated LOM-11 was markedly enhanced by LOM-4.7 and LOM-8.7, which both showed very similar dose response patterns, whereas LOM-14 did not show such an effect. LOM-4.9 and LOM-8.2 also enhanced the binding of biotinylated LOM-11 in a manner similar to that of LOM-4.7 and LOM-8.7 (data not shown). These results demonstrated 1) that binding sites of LOM-4.7, LOM-4.9, LOM-8.2, and LOM-8.7 are closely related, 2) that LOM-11 has a unique binding site, and 3) that the binding site of LOM-14 is different from those of LOM-11 and LOM-4.7/LOM-8.7. Because MMGL is a calcium-dependent lectin, calcium might be required not only for direct interaction with ligand carbohydrates but also for maintenance of conformation. Unlike lectin-carbohydrate interactions, one can speculate that the presence of calcium has no effect on the antibody-lectin interaction. However, if calcium is involved in the maintenance of conformation of MMGL, a calcium-dependent conformation may be detected by an antibody. We tested this hypothesis by measuring antibody binding to rML with or without pretreatment in EGTA (pretreated at 20 mM and final concentration of 10 mM during incubation with mAbs).

Both the purified CHO-CFTR and Sf9-CFTR were able to interact specifically with the nucleotide photoanalogue 8-N3-[α-32P]ATP with half-maximal binding at 25 and 50 μM, respectively. These values compare well with those reported for 8-N3-[α-32P]ATP binding to CFTR in its native membrane form. Thus CFTR from either insect or CHO cells can be purified to high homogeneity with retention of many of the biochemical and electrophysiological characteristics of the protein associated in its native plasma membrane form.

The best characterized abnormality associated with CF cells is altered epithelial chloride permeability. In consequence following cloning of the gene encoding CFTR, it was initially suggested that CFTR was either a chloride (Cl-) channel or a regulator of a Cl- channel (Riordan et al., 1989Riordan J. Rommens J.M. Kerem B.-S. Alon N. Rozmahel R. Grzelczak Z. Zielenski J. Lok S. Plavsic N. Chou J.-L. Drumm M.L. Iannuzi M.C. Collins F.S. Tsui L.-C.

These results argued that CFTR was likely to be a phosphorylation-regulated Cl- channel. Direct and definitive evidence showing that CFTR could act independently, as a regulated Cl- channel came from studies by Bear et al.(1992) showing that CFTR highly purified from Sf9 cells when reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles and fused to a planar lipid bilayer exhibited cAMP-stimulated Cl- channel activity. The most common CF-associated mutation, a deletion of the residue phenylalanine at position 508 (ΔF508) prevents both the transport and maturation of the glycoprotein to its apical location (Cheng et al., 1990Cheng S.H.

Nature. 1992; 358: 761-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar). In consequence, these epithelial cells are unable to regulate normal ion transport, and this, it is proposed, is the basis for the disease. Several other CF-associated mutations have been identified (Tsui, 1992Tsui L.C. Hum. Mutat. 1992; 1: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), and some like the ΔF508 mutation result in synthesis of variants that fail to localize to the correct cellular location. Others result in the production of variants that are either unstable or exhibit diminished Cl- channel activity (for review, see Welsh and Smith, 1993Welsh M.J. Smith A.E. Cell. 1993; 73: 1251-1254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1231) Google Scholar). Therefore therapies based on reintroduction of a normal functioning CFTR into these affected cells could ameliorate the clinical symptoms associated with CF. This may be accomplished either by gene transfer or by protein replacement therapy. Development of a protein replacement therapeutic approach for CF requires that we develop 1) an abundant source of the membrane protein, 2) processes for purification of CFTR to homogeneity, and 3) a vehicle capable of mediating the delivery of the reconstituted and purified CFTR to the target cells. In this report, we describe procedures to purify functionally active CFTR from CHO cell lines capable of producing high levels of CFTR. The properties of the purified CHO-CFTR were studied and compared using a variety of biochemical and electrophysiological assays to CFTR purified from Sf9 cells using a modification of the procedure described by Bear et al. (1992). The ability to deliver CFTR to a target cell by membrane fusion has recently been demonstrated (Marshall et al., 1994Marshall J. Fang S. Ostedgaard L.S. O'Riordan C.R. Ferrara D. Amara J.F.

Transfer of the crude CFTR-containing membranes to the recipient cell was mediated by the influenza virus hemagglutinin fusion protein. The feasibility of this approach has now been extended to include the use of purified and reconstituted CFTR (generated using the processes described here) in either a proteoliposome or hybrid virosome.2 2R.

To generate stable mammalian cell lines expressing human CFTR, the 4.5-kilobase SalI fragment from the vector pMT-CFTR (Cheng et al., 1990Cheng S.H. Gregory R.J. Marshall J. Paul S. Souza D.W.

This vector also includes pML sequences and the gene for dihydrofolate reductase for selection and methotrexate-mediated amplification of the transfectants. pDHFR-CFTR was transfected into CHO cells (Urlaub and Chasin, 1980Urlaub G. Chasin L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A 4.5-kilobase SpeI-KpnI fragment containing the human CFTR cDNA together with a Xenopus laevis β-globin leader sequence at the 5′ terminus was cloned between the XbaI and KpnI sites of the transfer vector pVL1392 (Invitrogen) to generate pBac-CFTR1. Recombinant CFTR-expressing viruses were generated following co-transfection of Sf9 cells with pBac-CFTR1 and wild-type AcMNPV DNA essentially as described by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). All manipulations throughout purification were conducted at 0-4°C in the presence of protease inhibitors. The starting material was approximately 300 mg of crude CFTR-containing membranes prepared from 1 × 1010 CHO cells. The highest producing CHO cell line (designated CU1A), estimated to produce approximately 1 × 106 CFTR molecules/cell, was used for all purifications. Estimates of the quantity of CFTR expressed in CHO cells were made using Western blotting and quantitative densitometry. A standard curve of pure CFTR (concentration determined by ELISA) was used to determine the concentration of CFTR in cell lysates from CHO cells. Routinely CFTR could be purified to 30-40% homogeneity by immunoaffinity chromatography alone. A more pure preparation (60-70% homogeneity) of CFTR could be achieved using a combination of immunoaffinity chromatography and either gel filtration or ion-exchange chromatography. CFTR was quantified using an ELISA assay (see below). Cells grown on microcarriers in 8-liter spinners were harvested by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 5 min. The cell pellets were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended with approximately 500 ml of hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 2 mM MgCl2, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 10 mM benzamidine, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 20 μg/ml aprotinin) and allowed to swell on ice for 30 min. The suspension was then passed through a microfluidizer (Microfluidics) at 3,000 p.s.i. Unlysed cells and cell debris were removed by low speed centrifugation (1,000 × g), and the resulting supernatant was recentrifuged at 10,000 × g for 25 min. The supernatant was retained and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to yield a crude membrane pellet that was resuspended in 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, and 10% glycerol. To remove peripherally bound membrane proteins, the crude membrane fraction was diluted with 10 volumes of 10 mM EDTA, pH 11.0, and kept at 4°C for 2 min. The alkali-stripped membranes were collected by pelleting at 100,000 × g for 20 min, washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and then resuspended at 4 mg/ml in solubilization buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1.5%α-lysoPC). The following protease inhibitors were included: 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 mM benzamidine, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 130 μM bestatin, 50 mM α2-macroglobulin, 1 mM Pefabloc, and 250 μg/ml cystatin. The membrane suspension was agitated for 30 min, and the insoluble membrane fragments were pelleted by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The supernatant containing the solubilized CFTR was decanted and saved, and the pellet was discarded. Monoclonal antibodies mAb 13-1 (Gregory et al., 1990Gregory R.J. Cheng S.H. Rich D.P. Marshall J.

Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 551-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) were used to prepare immunoaffinity resins. The carbohydrate moiety of the antibodies was activated with sodium periodate and coupled to Hydrazide Avidgel™ (Unisyn Technologies) in 50 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.0. Immunoaffinity chromatography was performed routinely using either the mAb 13-1 or mAb 24-1 hydrazide resin. CHO membranes containing CFTR were solubilized as described above, and 25 ml (from approximately 100 mg of membranes) of the solubilized material was incubated batchwise with 15 ml of resin for at least 3 h at 4°C. After collection of the flow-through, the resin was rinsed with 100 ml of wash buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, and 1% sodium cholate) to remove nonspecifically bound proteins. Since the precise epitopes of the monoclonal antibodies have been determined (amino acids 729-736 for MAb 13-1 and 1477-1480 for MAb 24-1, Marshall et al.(1994)), CFTR was eluted from the resin using elution buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5% sodium cholate) containing 5 mg/ml of the appropriate peptide antigen. The peptide used for elution of CFTR from the 13-1 immunoaffinity hydrazide resin was SDEPLERRS-NH2, and that used for the 24-1 hydrazide resin was VQDTRL-NH2. Both peptides were synthesized by QCB (Hopkinton, MA) and were >85% pure by high performance liquid chromatography. Fractions containing CFTR were pooled (40-50 ml) and concentrated using a Centricell 20 (30,000 nominal molecular weight limit) to a final concentration of CFTR of 1 mg/ml (500 μl). The immunoaffinity resin was regenerated by washing with 10 volumes of 0.15 M NaOH, pH 11 (the pH of the stock NaOH solution (pH 13) was adjusted to 11 using HCl) and stored in 150 mM NaCl, 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 0.02% NaN3 at 4°C. The following protease inhibitors were added to all buffers immediately before use: 1 mM Pefabloc, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 mM benzamidine, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin. Gel filtration chromatography was performed on a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column pre-equilibrated with 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5% sodium cholate, pH 7.5, at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min. 200 μl of immunoaffinity-purified CFTR (1 mg/ml) were applied to the column at the same flow rate, and 0.5-ml fractions were collected. Fractions containing CFTR were detected by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining. These fractions were pooled and concentrated, and CFTR was quantitated by an ELISA. A 50-ml column of DEAE-Sepharose was packed and equilibrated with 10 mM K2HPO4, 10% glycerol, 0.05%α-lysoPC, pH 7.5 (conductivity, 3.2 mS/cm). Stripped membranes (100 mg) were solubilized in the above buffer containing 1.5%α-lysoPC, and the resulting 100,000 × g supernatant was applied to the column at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. CFTR bound to DEAE-Sepharose under these conditions. After extensive washing of the resin with equilibration buffer, a linear gradient of 10-150 mM K2HPO4 was applied at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. CFTR eluted from the column at approximately 60-85 mM K2HPO4. Insect Sf9 cells were infected with a recombinant baculovirus containing the complete human CFTR cDNA. CFTR was purified from infected insect cell membranes according to the method of Bear et al.(1992), with the following modifications. A small 2.6 × 6-cm (30 ml) ceramic hydroxyapatite column was used instead of the larger 2.6 × 20 cm (100 ml) Bio-Gel hydroxyapatite column. The ceramic hydroxyapatite allowed a faster flow rate (0.5 ml/min versus 0.2 ml/min), so the overall time for purification was decreased from 34 (for hydroxyapatite) to 15 h (for ceramic hydroxyapatite). Equilibration and elution buffers used on the ceramic hydroxyapatite column were as described previously by Bear et al.(1992). The ceramic hydroxyapatite column was equilibrated with 10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.4, containing 0.15% SDS and 5 mM dithiothreitol. After washing the resin with equilibration buffer, a linear gradient of (100-600 mM) of sodium phosphate containing 0.15% SDS and 5 mM dithiothreitol was applied. Elution of bound CFTR was achieved with additional washing with the high phosphate buffer. Additional modifications included replacing the Superose column in the original protocol with a Superdex column and performing the chromatography in 0.1% SDS rather than 0.25% lithium dodecyl sulfate. We found the separation on the Superdex resin to be more effective than that obtained with the Superose resin. Also the Superdex resin facilitated purification of larger quantities (mg) of insect CFTR. One-dimensional SDS-PAGE was performed using 4-20% gradient (Daiichi) gels. Proteins in the gel were detected by staining with either silver stain or Coomassie Blue. The purity of the CFTR preparations was assessed by densitometry of the Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gels using a LKB 2202 Ultroscan laser densitometer. For immunoblotting, polyvinylidine difluoride membranes (Novex) were prewetted with methanol and then soaked in 10 mM CAPS, pH 11, containing 10% methanol. Gels were equilibrated in this transfer buffer for 10 min and then blotted at 30 V for 3 h in a Novex blot module. After transfer, membranes were blocked with 1% dried milk in Tris-buffered saline (20 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5) for 1 h. After blocking, the membranes were probed with biotinylated antibody (mAb 13-1 or mAb 24-1) at 0.05 μg/ml in 20 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5, and 0.05% Tween 20 containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 2 h. The membranes were incubated with Streptavidin/horseradish peroxidase (1:25,000) for 20 min, and the immunoreactive bands were visualized by chemiluminesence using the ECL system (Amersham Corp.). CFTR was quantified using an ELISA assay. ELISA plates were coated with mAb 13-1 (Anti-R-domain antibody). Biotinylated mAb 24-1 (anti-C domain) and orthophenylene diamine (Engvall and Perlman, 1971Engvall E. Perlman P. Immunochemistry. 1971; 8: 871-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (2862) Google Scholar) were used as substrate to measure antigen specific antibody response. Absorbance was measured at 490-650 nm. 10-μg (25-50 μl) samples of purified CFTR (either in detergent or reconstituted in proteoliposomes) were equilibrated at room temperature for 15 min with 100 μM 8-N3-[α-32P]ATP (azido ATP, 2-10 Ci/mmol, ICN) in 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 5 mM MgSO4, 100 mM NaCl. Photolabeling was performed using a handheld UV lamp (model UVG-54 Mineralight from UVP, Inc.) at a distance of 4.5 cm for 2 × 30-s intervals. For competition experiments, the competing nucleotide, ATP, was pre-incubated with the purified samples of CFTR for 15 min on ice before the addition of 8-N3-[α-32P]ATP. Reactions were terminated by the addition of polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis loading buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 4-20% gel. The amount of 8-N3-[α-32P]ATP incorporated into the CFTR containing band was determined by densitometric scanning of the Coomassie-stained CFTR band followed by counting the equivalent area of the gel using a PhosphorImager (Betascope 603). The cAMP-stimulated chloride channel activity of CFTR in both insect and CHO cells was determined using the halide-sensitive fluorophore 6-methoxy-N-(3-sulfopropyl)-quinolinium (SPQ) as described previously (Illsley and Verkman, 1987Illsley N.P.

CHO cells were loaded by hypotonic shock for 4 min at room temperature while insect cells required a longer incubation time of 4 h for effective loading. SPQ fluorescence was initially quenched by incubating the cells for up to 30 min in a buffer containing 135 mM NaI, 2.4 mM K2HPO4, 1 mM CaSO4, 10 mM dextrose, 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.4. After measuring base-line fluorescence for 2 min, the 135 mM NaI solution was replaced with one containing 135 mM NaNO3, and fluorescence was measured for another 16 min. Forskolin (20 μM) and isobutylmethylxanthine (100 μM) were added 5 min after the anion substitution to increase intracellular cAMP. An increase in halide permeability is reflected by a more rapid increase in SPQ fluorescence. It is the rate of change rather than the absolute change in signal that is the important variable in evaluating anion permeability. Differences in absolute values reflect quantitative differences between groups in SPQ loading, size of cells, or number of cells studied. The data are presented as the mean ± S.E. of fluorescence at time t (Ft) minus the base-line fluorescence (Fo, the average fluorescence measured in the presence of I- for 2 min prior to ion substitution) and are representative of results obtained under each condition. Immunoaffinity-purified CFTR was concentrated as described above and reconstituted using a modification of the procedure described by Bear et al.(1992). An aliquot containing a known amount of CFTR (15-20 μg) was added to 100 μl of 15 mM Hepes, 0.5 mM EGTA, pH 7.4, containing 1 mg of a sonicated phospholipid mixture (phosphatidylethanolamine/phosphatidylserine/phosphatidylcholine/ergosterol, 5:2:1:2 (molar ratio)) and 1% sodium cholate. After a 40-min incubation on ice, the mixture was dialyzed at 4°C against 15 mM Hepes, 0.5 mM EGTA, pH 7.4, and 1.5% sodium cholate for 24 h. Dialysis was continued for an additional 3 days against 15 mM Hepes, 0.5 mM EGTA, pH 7.4, with daily changes of buffer. The sample was further dialyzed against 15 mM Hepes, 0.5 mM EGTA, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4, for 24 h. After dialysis, the resulting proteoliposomes were quickly frozen on liquid nitrogen, thawed, and sonicated for 5 s in a bath sonicator (Lab Supplies Co. Inc., Hicksville, NY). A lipid bilayer, of capacitance >200 picofarads, was formed by painting a 20 mg/ml solution of a phospholipid mixture (phosphatidylethanolamine/phosphatidylserine, 50:50) (Avanti Lipids) in n-decane over the aperture in a bilayer chamber. The solution in the cis compartment contained 300 mM KCl, 10 mM MOPS, 1 mM MgCl2, and 2 mM CaCl2, pH 7, and, in the trans compartment, the concentration of KCl was reduced to 50 mM KCl. Proteoliposomes (4 μl) were added to the cis compartment of the chamber followed by stirring to enhance adherence to the bilayer. Membrane potentials were referenced to the trans compartment, and Cl- current from cis to trans was designated as negative. Single channel activity of CFTR reconstituted into planar lipid bilayers was acquired via a current-voltage amplifier (constructed by M.

ADP evoked a release of [Ca2+]i and transiently activated a monovalent cation-selective channel, which, at negative potentials and under physiological conditions, would be expected to carry an inward Na+ current. The single channel conductance, estimated by noise analysis from whole cell currents at −50 to −60 mV was 9 picosiemens. Thapsigargin-induced [Ca2+]i increases failed to stimulate the monovalent cation current, suggesting that neither [Ca2+]i nor the depletion of internal Ca2+ stores were activators of this conductance. However, buffering of [Ca2+]i changes with 1,2-bis-(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N’,N’-tetraacetic acid showed that both activation and inactivation of the current were accelerated by a rise in [Ca2+]i. The monovalent cation conductance was activated by internal perfusion with inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, both in the presence and in the absence of a rise in [Ca2+]i. Internal perfusion with inositol 2,4,5-trisphosphate, the poorly metabolizable isomer of inositol trisphosphate, similarly activated the monovalent cation current, whereas 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate neither activated a current nor modified the ADP-induced monovalent current. Heparin, added to the pipette, blocked activation of the channel by ADP. The intracellular concentration of Na+, monitored by sodium-binding benzofuran isopthalate, increased by 10-20 mM in response to ADP under pseudophysiological conditions. We conclude the existence of a novel nonselective cation channel in the plasma membrane of rat megakaryocytes, which is activated by IP3 and can lead to increases in cytosolic Na+ after stimulation by ADP.

Megakaryocytes are large cells located in the bone marrow that are responsible for producing blood platelets, yet little is known of the cellular mechanisms underlying their function. Uneyama and co-workers (1Uneyama C. Uneyama H. Akaike N. J. Physiol. 1993; 470: 731-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 2Akaike N. Uneyama H. News Physiol. Sci. 1994; 9: 49-53Google Scholar) have shown that rat megakaryocytes possess a novel purinergic receptor, which recognizes the ionized forms of ATP and ADP. Stimulation of this receptor leads to sustained oscillations of intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i)1 1The abbreviations used are: [Ca2+]cytosolic Ca2+ concentrationSBFIsodium-binding benzofuran isopthalateIP3myo-inositol trisphosphate (with positional determinants of the phosphate groups as specified)IP4myo-inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphateBAPTA1,2-bis-(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N’,N’-tetraacetic acidNMDGn-methyl-D-glucamine[Na+]cytosolic Na+ concentrationI-Vcurrent-voltage. 1The abbreviations used are: [Ca2+]cytosolic Ca2+ concentrationSBFIsodium-binding benzofuran isopthalateIP3myo-inositol trisphosphate (with positional determinants of the phosphate groups as specified)IP4myo-inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphateBAPTA1,2-bis-(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N’,N’-tetraacetic acidNMDGn-methyl-D-glucamine[Na+]cytosolic Na+ concentrationI-Vcurrent-voltage. and activation of Ca2+-dependent K+ channels. We have recently found that ATP also activates Na+ and Ca2+-permeable channels in rat megakaryocytes via two distinct classes of purinergic receptor(3Somasundaram B. Mahaut-Smith M.P. J. Physiol. 1994; 480: 225-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). One receptor is activated by ATP but not noticeably by ADP and causes rapid, transient opening of a nonselective cation channel. A second purinoceptor is stimulated by ATP−4 and ADP−3 and activates both a monovalent cation-selective channel and a channel highly selective for Ca2+. Stimulation via this second receptor also causes a release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores and is most likely the same receptor as that responsible for the generation of Ca2+ oscillations in the experiments of Uneyama et al.(1Uneyama C. Uneyama H. Akaike N. J. Physiol. 1993; 470: 731-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The Ca2+-selective conductance is activated by depletion of internal Ca2+ stores via an as yet undetermined messenger and is indistinguishable from the store-regulated Ca2+ current found in other nonexcitable cell types(4Hoth M. Penner R. Nature. 1992; 355: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (1488) Google Scholar, 5Fasolato C. Innocenti B. Pozzan T. Trends Pharmacol.

The monovalent cation-selective current is also activated at the time of internal Ca2+ release via IP3 or another inositol lipid metabolite(3Somasundaram B. Mahaut-Smith M.P. J. Physiol. 1994; 480: 225-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This channel is particularly interesting because, at resting membrane potentials, the current will be mostly carried by Na+, and changes in [Na+]i have been proposed to play a role in the spreading reaction in megakaryocytes(7Leven R.M. Mullikin W.H. Nachmias V.T. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1234-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The spreading reaction may represent the physiological mechanism whereby megakaryocytes invade the bone sinusoids to reach the blood vessels and release platelets(8Penington D.G. Gordon L. Platelets in Biology and Pathology. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1981: 20-41Google Scholar). In the present study we have used a combination of patch clamp and fluorescent indicators of [Ca2+] and [Na+] to study the monovalent cation-selective current activated by ADP and inositol phosphates in the plasma membrane of rat megakaryocytes. cytosolic Ca2+ concentration sodium-binding benzofuran isopthalate myo-inositol trisphosphate (with positional determinants of the phosphate groups as specified) myo-inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate 1,2-bis-(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N’,N’-tetraacetic acid n-methyl-D-glucamine cytosolic Na+ concentration current-voltage. cytosolic Ca2+ concentration sodium-binding benzofuran isopthalate myo-inositol trisphosphate (with positional determinants of the phosphate groups as specified) myo-inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate 1,2-bis-(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N’,N’-tetraacetic acid n-methyl-D-glucamine cytosolic Na+ concentration current-voltage. Adult male Wistar rats weighing 200-300 g were killed by cervical dislocation. Bone marrow from the femoral and tibial bones was removed by gentle lavage using a standard external solution containing 20 mg ml−1 apyrase and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. After filtration through a fine cotton mesh, the suspension was spun and washed twice before storage in the same standard solution. Megakaryocytes were distinguished from other bone marrow cells by their distinctive size (30-60 μm) and multilobular nucleus. Recordings were made at room temperature (20-23°C) within 3-24 h of isolation. The standard external solution contained 140 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 2 mM CaCl2, 10 mM glucose, 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4 adjusted with Tris). K+-, Na+-, and Ca2+-free external media were obtained by replacing these ions with Cs+, NMDG+, and Mg2+, respectively. For low Cl− external solutions, all Cl−, except for that added with the divalent cation salts, was replaced by gluconate. In conventional whole cell patch recordings, Cs+ replaced K+ in order to block K+ currents and contained 140 mM cesium gluconate, 5 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 10 mM HEPES, 0.2 mM Na2GTP, 0.05 mM K5·fura-2, (pH 7.4 adjusted with Tris). 0.1 mM (NH4)4·SBFI replaced the K5·fura-2 in experiments where [Na+]i and membrane current were measured simultaneously. For internal dialysis of inositol phosphates, the pipette tip was dipped in inositol phosphate-free pipette solution and then backfilled with pipette solution containing 10 μM inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (1,4,5-IP3), 50 μM 2,4,5-IP3, or 20 μM inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (IP4). Highly calcium-buffered pipette solution was obtained by replacing 40 mM cesium gluconate with 10 mM Cs4·BAPTA. In nystatin-perforated patch recordings, the pipette contained 100 mM KCl, 40 mM K2SO4, 1 mM MgCl2, 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4 adjusted with Tris), 150 μg ml−1 nystatin. In these perforated patch experiments, cells were loaded with SBFI by incubation with 10 μM SBFI-acetoxymethyl ester with 0.04% pluronic acid for 60 min at room temperature. Fura-2, SBFI, Cs4·BAPTA and pluronic F-127 were from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). 1,4,5-IP3, 2,4,5-IP3, and IP4 were a gift of Dr. R. F. Irvine (Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council, Babraham Institute, Cambridge, UK). All other reagents were from Sigma. A pressure injector was used to administer agonists from a patch pipette placed 150 μm from the cell. The time delay for arrival of agonists at the cell was measured and subtracted. Patch clamp experiments were performed in conventional whole cell (9Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pfluegers Archiv. Eur. J. Physiol. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15138) Google Scholar) or nystatin-perforated patch (10Horn R. Marty A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1988; 92: 145-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (1457) Google Scholar) configurations by means of an Axopatch 200A patch clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments, Inc., Foster City, CA). Pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass tubing (Clark Electromedical Instruments) and had filled resistances of 2-3 megaohms. Series resistances were in the range of 7-30 megaohms, and 40-60% series resistance compensation was employed. Membrane currents during voltage ramps (0.6 mV/ms) were filtered at 2 kHz and sampled at 100 μs using Axon Instruments hardware (Digidata 1200) and software (pClamp). Where stated, voltage ramps prior to agonist application were used to subtract linear leak currents from ADP-evoked currents. A holding potential of −40 mV was used in many experiments because this was close to the membrane potential measured in perforated patch experiments under pseudophysiological conditions (see Fig. 6). A less negative potential permitted longer recordings, thus −20 mV was used in experiments where large currents were detected; however, holding potentials in the range of −70 to 40 mV were used in some experiments, depending upon the conditions, to check for measurable currents. For noise analysis, currents were filtered at 0.5 kHz and sampled at 2.5 kHz. Currents were also acquired at a rate of 60 Hz (filtered at approximately 30 Hz) by the Cairn spectrophotometer (see below) for simultaneous display alongside the fura-2 and SBFI fluoresence and signal-indicating agonist injection. Liquid junction potentials were measured by reference to a 3 M KCl agar bridge, and membrane potentials were adjusted accordingly in conventional but not nystatin whole cell recordings. Fura-2 and SBFI fluoresence measurements were made by single cell photometry using a Cairn spectrophotometer system (Cairn Research Ltd., Kent, UK) coupled to a Nikon Diaphot inverted microscope. Excitation light passed through a spinning filter wheel assembly containing four 340-nm and two 380-nm bandpass excitation filters. Emitted light (400-600 nm) was selected by two dichroic filters and further filtered by a 485-nm long pass filter. The combined output from all 340 and 380 nm excitation filters provided a 340/380 nm ratio for each revolution of the filter wheel. The signal was then averaged to obtain a ratio value every 67 ms. Background and cell autofluoresence was measured in the cell-attached recording mode and subtracted to give fura-2 or SBFI fluoresence. [Ca2+]i was calculated according to Grynkiewicz et al.(11Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) using a dissociation constant for fura-2 of 250 nM(12Williams D.A. Fay F.S. Cell Calcium. 1990; 11: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Under conditions where SBFI was introduced into the cell through the recording pipette, background-corrected 340/380 ratios were used to provide an indication of [Na+]i changes. In experiments where SBFI was loaded from its acetoxymethyl ester, [Na+]i was clamped at different levels by perfusing solutions of known extracellular Na+ concentrations in the presence of a mixture of sodium ionophores (5 μM each of gramicidin, nigericin, and monensin; Ref. 13Harootunian A.T. Kao J.P.Y. Eckert B.K. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19458-19467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The extracellular solutions were made from appropriate mixtures of high Na+ and K+ solutions. The former consisted of 110 mM sodium gluconate, 30 mM NaCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 10 mM Na-HEPES (pH 7.4). The high K+ solution was identical except for substitution of all Na+ for K+. A plot of SBFI 340/380 nm intensity ratio versus [Na+] was linear in the range of 0-40 mM. The experimental 340/380 ratio values fell within this linear range, and therefore [Na+]ivalues were directly obtained from the calibration curve. At negative potentials and under conditions that blocked K+ currents (see “Materials and Methods”), 5 μM ADP activated a transient inward current and a concurrent large increase in [Ca2+]i (Fig. 1A). The initial [Ca2+]i increase reached a peak of 0.5-1.5 μM within 1-2 s and then returned to basal levels (approximately 50-100 nM) in the continued presence of ADP or was followed by further smaller increases in [Ca2+]i that sometimes fused to give a plateau, as shown in the cell of Fig. 1. In the absence of external calcium, an inward current and [Ca2+]iincrease were still activated by ADP(3Somasundaram B. Mahaut-Smith M.P. J. Physiol. 1994; 480: 225-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This suggests that the rise in [Ca2+]i is at least partly due to the release of internal stores and that the current is not selective for Ca2+. However, variability between cells did not allow us to quantify the extent to which Ca2+ influx contributed to the response. To further examine the conductance changes in reponse to ADP, membrane currents were recorded during 0.6 mV/ms voltage ramps within the range of potentials −100 to 90 mV. A ramp applied prior to agonist application (Fig. 1B, trace a) was used to subtract background currents from ramp currents obtained during the ADP-evoked transient (Fig. 1B, trace b). Fig. 1C shows the difference current (b-a) representing the I-V relationship for the ADP-evoked conductance. In 140 mM Na+ external solution and 140 mM cesium gluconate internal solution, the I-V relationship reversed at about −5 mV, was reasonably linear over the voltage range −90 to 40 mV, and, in most cells, displayed a distinct increase in slope at more positive potentials. The I-V relationship obtained by ramps at different times during the ADP-evoked current differed only in amplitude and not in reversal potential, suggesting that the response was due to activation of a single ionic conductance. The ionic selectivity of the ADP-evoked conductance was investigated by substitution of internal and external ions. In Fig. 2, ADP-evoked I-V relationships are shown for each of four ionic conditions, with the membrane currents and Ca2+ responses at a single negative holding potential in the insets. These results were obtained from the first ADP-evoked response in four different cells and were confirmed in at least five cells for each condition. Replacement of the majority of the internal and external Cl− had little effect on the current and Ca2+ response at −40 mV or on the difference I-V relationship (Fig. 2A) compared with corresponding Cl−-containing salines (see for example Fig. 1C). Therefore, the ADP-evoked conductance does not appear to be significantly permeant to anions. On the other hand, replacement of all internal and external monovalent cations with the impermeant cation NMDG abolished all current at −40 mV, in the presence of an ADP-evoked Ca2+ response (Fig. 2B, inset). No significant current developed within the voltage range −80 to 80 mV, as shown by the overlapping ramp currents before and during the Ca2+ response in Fig. 2B, indicating that the ADP-evoked current is carried by monovalent cations. 2 mM Ca2+ and 1 mM Mg2+ were present in the external media throughout, which indicates little or no permeability to divalent cations at these physiological concentrations. Increasing external Ca2+ decreases the level of ADP3−(1Uneyama C. Uneyama H. Akaike N. J. Physiol. 1993; 470: 731-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and abolishes the ADP response(3Somasundaram B. Mahaut-Smith M.P. J. Physiol. 1994; 480: 225-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar); therefore we were unable to increase the external Ca2+ concentration to test for any underlying permeability to Ca2+. The absence of membrane current in the experiment of Fig. 2B was not due to direct block by NMDG+ or the requirement of permeant ion on both sides of the membrane, because current was activated by ADP unidirectionally when either the external or internal NMDG was replaced by Cs+ (Fig. 2, C and D). In the presence of symmetrical 140 mM Cs+, the ADP-evoked I-V relationship was similar to that observed in Na+/Cs+ salines and reversed at about −5 mV (not shown), indicating similar Na+ and Cs+ permeabilities. Clear single channel events could not be clearly resolved during the off-phase of the ADP-evoked whole cell current. This was due to the noise generated by the high capacitance of the megakaryocyte (20-100 picofarads), although it also indicates that the ADP-evoked events are of relatively short duration(14Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Neher E. Single Channel Recording. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1983: 107-122Google Scholar). We therefore turned to noise analysis to obtain an estimate of single channel conductance. When the number of channels opening is small, the variance (σ2) of the current is linearly related to the mean current with a slope equal to the single channel current(15Anderson C.R. Stevens C.F. J. Physiol. 1973; 235: 655-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar, 16Sigworth F.J. J. Physiol. 1980; 307: 97-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). For this analysis we used cells that displayed a small ADP-evoked current, as shown in Fig. 3A. This reduced response was most likely the result of receptor desensitization (e.g. by ADP and ATP from damaged cells during the cell preparation) rather than a low number of total channels. As expected, the variance of the mean of the whole cell current increased in response to ADP (Fig. 3A, lower record). A plot of variance against the mean current during the ADP response could be well fitted by a linear relationship with a slope of 0.49 pA. The holding potential was −60 mV, and the reversal potential under these conditions was −5 mV, giving a single channel conductance of approximately 9 picosiemens. Within the range of holding potentials −50 to −60 mV, the average conductance was 8.6 ± 0.4 picosiemens (n = 3). This analysis assumes the existence of a uniform single channel conductance and that all channels open independently. The estimate must be considered a lower estimate for the single channel conductance, and, in practice, direct measurements of channel conductance are higher(17Dart C. Standen N.B. J. Physiol. 1993; 471: 767-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The close association of the ADP-evoked current with the rise in [Ca2+]isuggested that this current may be modulated by Ca2+ or a Ca2+-dependent process. To test this, the current was activated by ADP when internal Ca2+ levels were strongly buffered by 10 mM BAPTA in the pipette saline. In order to eliminate the store-dependent inward current that is amplified under such conditions(3Somasundaram B. Mahaut-Smith M.P. J. Physiol. 1994; 480: 225-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), Ca2+ was omitted from the external saline. Fig. 4A compares the [Ca2+]i changes and membrane currents activated by a 30-s application of 5 μM ADP in normal (Fig. 4Ai) and enhanced (Fig. 4Aii) calcium buffering in nominally Ca2+-free salines. With low buffering, the current was activated 0.6 ± 0.3 s (n = 10) after ADP application, peaked within 1-3 s and inactivated to 10% of peak current after 3.5 ± 2 s (n = 10). In most cells tested the current was inactivated well before [Ca2+]i returned to basal levels (Fig. 4Ai). In the absence of any increase in [Ca2+]i, ADP could still activate an inward current, although its kinetics were very different (Fig. 4Aii). The current was activated more slowly, reaching a peak after 5-10 s, and was inactivated more slowly (time to 10% of peak current was 18.5 ± 6 s; n = 6) compared with the currents activated in the unbuffered cells. This implies that Ca2+ or a Ca2+-dependent process, although not required for activation of the ADP-evoked current, accelerates the rate of both activation and inactivation. In order to test if this current could be activated by a rise in [Ca2+]i alone, [Ca2+]i was continuously elevated to micromolar levels using the endoplasmic Ca-ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin (Fig. 4B). This agent results in a permanent loss of Ca2+ from IP3-sensitive stores and store-dependent (capacitative) calcium entry(18Thastrup O. Dawson A.P. Scharff O. Foder B. Cullen P.J. Drobak B.K. Bjerrum P.J. Christensen S.B. Hanley M.R. Agents Actions. 1989; 27: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 19Putney Jr., J.W. Cell Calcium. 1986; 7: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (2106) Google Scholar). The absence of any current in the megakaryocyte after thapsigargin treatment in Ca2+-free saline suggests that the ADP-evoked current cannot be triggered by an increase in [Ca2+]i alone; neither is this current activated as a result of depletion of internal Ca2+ stores. Repeated exposures to ADP could reactivate the monovalent cation current, provided there was an interval of 1-2 min between successive applications. Under conditions of high internal Ca2+ buffering, thus removing Ca2+-dependent inhibition of the current, both activation and inactivation of the current became progressively slower with repeated ADP additions, as shown in the experiment of Fig. 4C. This suggested that dialysis of the cytoplasm removes factors responsible for activation and inactivation of the current. These factors may, for example, generate and metabolize the second messenger involved in channel activation. Release of internal Ca2+ in nonexcitable cells appears to ubiquitously involve an increase in cytoplasmic IP3 levels and IP3-dependent Ca2+ stores(20Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6165) Google Scholar). IP3 is therefore a candidate for the second messenger involved in the activation of the monovalent cation channel in the rat megakaryocyte. A previous study provided preliminary evidence for a role for IP3, because dialysis with 1,4,5-IP3 activated a monovalent cation current with similar characteristics to that activated by ADP(3Somasundaram B. Mahaut-Smith M.P. J. Physiol. 1994; 480: 225-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, it was not shown whether IP3 was acting alone or in synergism with other second messengers. Fig. 5A compares the currents activated by dialysis of 1,4,5-IP3 with (5Ai) and without (5Aii) an increase in intracellular Ca2+ levels. For these dialysis experiments, 3 mM 4-aminopyridine was added to the external medium to accelerate the blockade of K+ currents. As shown by the current-voltage relationships acquired at three timepoints during each experiment, a current similar to that observed with ADP was activated by 1,4,5-IP3 and did not require an increase in [Ca2+]i. 1,4,5-IP3 is rapidly metabolized to other inositol lipid products, including IP4(20Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6165) Google Scholar). Its isomer, 2,4,5-IP3 is also active at IP3 receptors on the Ca2+ stores, although at higher concentrations(21Irvine R.F. Brown K.D. Berridge M.J. Biochem. J. 1984; 222: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), and is experimentally useful because it is a poor substrate for the 1,4,5-IP3-kinase. Therefore 2,4,5-IP3 can be used to stimulate IP3-dependent processes, whereas cytoplasmic levels of IP4 remain low. As shown in Fig. 5B (i, left panel), dialysis with 2,4,5-IP3 released internal Ca2+ and activated the monovalent cation current in a manner indistinguishable from that seen with 1,4,5-IP3. In the presence of high Ca2+ buffering power, 2,4,5-IP3 evoked the inward current as expected and application of ADP failed to activate further current (Fig. 5Bii). These results suggest that IP3 on its own is sufficient to activate the monovalent cation current without a need for other inositol lipid products such as IP4. Furthermore, following internal dialysis with 20 μM IP4, no inward current was observed and subsequent exposure to ADP produced a normal response (Fig. 5C). 1,4,5-IP3-activated channels located on the membrane of internal Ca2+ stores and those on the plasma membrane of olfactory receptor neurons are both blocked by heparin(22Supattapone S. Worley P.F. Barraban J.M. Snyder S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1530-1534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Fadool D.A. Ache B.W. Neuron. 1992; 9: 907-918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Fig. 5D shows that internal perfusion of megakaryocytes with 10 mg ml−1 heparin for 5 min virtually abolished both the [Ca2+]i and membrane current response to ADP. Cd2+ has also been shown to block the olfactory neuron IP3-dependent plasma membrane channel(24Okada Y. Teeter J.H. Restrepo D. J. Neurophys. 1994; 71: 595-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar); however, neither Cd2+ nor Zn2+, added to the bath at 1 mM, affected the monovalent cation currents activated by ADP, 1,4,5-IP3, or 2,4,5-IP3 (not shown). Tetrodotoxin, a blocker of voltage-dependent Na+ channels, was also ineffective at concentrations up to 5 μM added to the bath saline (data not shown). In physiological salines, given a normal negative resting potential, the IP3 and ADP-evoked current would be inward and carried mainly by Na+. To detect whether this conductance can result in significant changes in [Na+]i, the Na+-sensitive indicator, SBFI(25Minta A. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19449-19457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was added to the pipette saline in place of fura-2 and 1,4,5-IP3 dialyzed from the pipette (Fig. 6A). The inward current that developed at the holding potential of −40 mV, which we have shown above to be induced by 1,4,5-IP3, was associated with a gradual increase in [Na+]i. Depolarization to 0 or 20 mV prevented the [Na+]i increase, an effect that was fully reversible, although more negative potentials were required to produce similar rates of Na+ increase once a substantial increase in the 340/380 ratio signal had occurred. The above whole cell patch clamp experiments represent conditions that are far from physiological and dialyze important cytoplasmic factors. We therefore turned to the nystatin-perforated patch technique to further assess the magnitude of the ADP-evoked [Na+]i increase. In these experiments, represented by that in Fig. 6B, a K+-based pipette saline and current-clamp conditions were also used in an attempt to further mimic physiological conditions. SBFI was loaded prior to patch clamp by incubation with the acetoxymethyl ester (see “Materials and Methods”). Application of 5 μM ADP produced a regular oscillation in membrane potential from the resting level of −40 mV to −75 mV (approximately 6 times/min), known to result from oscillations of [Ca2+]i and activation of Ca2+-dependent K+ channels(1Uneyama C. Uneyama H. Akaike N. J. Physiol. 1993; 470: 731-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 2Akaike N. Uneyama H. News Physiol. Sci. 1994; 9: 49-53Google Scholar).

To begin an analysis of the biochemistry of gene expression in trypanosomes, we established an in vitro transcription system from cultured insect forms of Trypanosoma brucei. As a model we used the U2 snRNA gene which in vivo is transcribed by an RNA polymerase with characteristics of animal RNA polymerase III. To obtain maximum sensitivity in our assay, we adapted the so-called G-less cassette approach to the U2 snRNA gene promoter. Since an intragenic control region is required for accurate expression in vivo, we generated a series of mutations to substitute all guanosine residues in the intragenic control region. These mutants were shown to retain full transcriptional activity in vivo after transient expression in insect-form trypanosomes. In a cell-free extract, synthesis of the U2 G-less cassette RNA is correctly initiated, is mediated by RNA polymerase III as determined by RNA polymerase inhibitor studies, and is dependent on the integrity of the upstream B box element.

Studies of transcription in the protozoan family Trypanosomatidae have revealed unusual features such as polycistronic transcription units and RNA polymerase I-mediated transcription of protein-encoding genes. However, compared to what we know about the transcriptional machinery in a number of different organisms, including yeast and higher eukaryotes, our understanding of promoter structures and trans-acting factors in trypanosomatid protozoa is extremely limited. This is in large part due to the fact that only a few functional promoters have been identified and that no in vitro transcription system is available. To date, RNA polymerase I and III promoters have been characterized in detail in Trypanosoma brucei. RNA polymerase I transcription units include the genes encoding the large ribosomal rRNAs(1Brown S.D. Huang J. VanderPloeg L.H.T. Mol. Cell.

The analysis of RNA polymerase III-mediated transcription in T. brucei has led to a number of surprising findings. Based on RNA polymerase inhibitor studies with the drugs α-amanitin and tagetitoxin and on the architecture of the promoters, the U2, U4, and U-snRNA1 1The abbreviations used are: snRNAsmall nuclear RNAntnucleotide(s)3′-OMeGTP3′-O-methyl-GTP. 1The abbreviations used are: snRNAsmall nuclear RNAntnucleotide(s)3′-OMeGTP3′-O-methyl-GTP.

This is in contrast to most other eukaryotic organisms studied to date, where these RNAs are synthesized by RNA polymerase II(9Dahlberg J.E. Lund E. Birnstiel M.L. Structure and Function of Major and Minor Small Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein Particles. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1988: 38-70Crossref Google Scholar). The only exception being the plant U3 snRNA gene which is also transcribed by RNA polymerase III (10Kiss T. Marshallsay C. Filipowicz W. Cell. 1991; 65: 517-526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In particular, studies with tagetitoxin, a specific inhibitor for RNA polymerase III, showed that transcription inhibition of the T. brucei U2, U4, and U-snRNA B genes closely followed that of typical RNA polymerase III genes, namely 5S, 7SL, U6 snRNA, and tRNAs, but not that of RNA polymerase I or II genes(7Fantoni A.

The characterization of cis-acting elements required for expression of the U2 and U6 snRNA genes in T. brucei has been a major focus of our research. In vivo transcription of both genes is dependent upon the integrity of three regulatory elements (7Fantoni A. Dare A.O. Tschudi C. Mol. Cell.

Tschudi, manuscript in preparation. Two upstream elements coincide with divergently oriented A and B boxes, which in the case of the U6 snRNA gene locus, are part of a functional threonine tRNA gene. In addition, expression of the U2 and U6 snRNA genes requires intragenic elements close to the 5′ end of the coding region, which are most likely responsible for positioning the RNA polymerase at the correct transcription start site. Although the above studies have unraveled a novel promoter architecture for the U2 and U6 snRNA genes, the experiments reported thus far do not provide insight into the underlying mechanism. Therefore, as a first step toward a detailed biochemical understanding of the transcriptional apparatus assembling on these U-snRNA genes, we developed a T. brucei DNA-dependent in vitro transcription system. Using the G-less cassette approach (11Sawadogo M. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4394-4398Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar) and a modified Dignam extract(12Dignam D.L. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9149) Google Scholar), RNA polymerase III-mediated transcription was shown to initiate at position +1 of the U2 snRNA gene, and transcription activity was dependent on the upstream B box element. Plasmids pTbU2_GL-AAA, pTbU2_GL-AT-, pTbU2_GL-CAA, pTbU2_GL-CAT, pTbU2_GL-TAT, and pTbU2_GL-TCA were derived from construct pTU2Δ83 (7Fantoni A. Dare A.O. Tschudi C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2021-2028Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis of single-stranded template(13Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4894) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide used in this mutagenesis was U2-GL1, 5′-GCATATCTTCTC(ATC)(ATC)CTATTTA(ATC)CTAAGATC-3′ (parentheses indicate degenerate positions), containing the sequences of the U2 snRNA gene from nucleotides −2 to +28. The U2 G-less cassette has the following sequence (sequence of the nontranscribed strand, +1 indicates the U2 transcription start site): 5ι-CTCCACTAC ATATCTTCTC AACTATCTAA CTAAAATCAA ATTATTAAAC TATTCTTATC AAAATAACAC CTAATACAAA CCTTCAAATCTATCATCATT CACTTTTT-3ι(Eq. 1) The cassette was constructed by using two complementary oligonucleotides. Oligonucleotide U2-GL2 is 111 nt long and complementary to the G-less sequence listed above. It spans the whole cassette and has additional CG and CT dinucleotides at its 5′ and 3′ end, respectively. Oligonucleotide U2_GL3, 5′-CCACTACATATCTTCTCAAC-3′, was designed to generate an overhang characteristic for the restriction enzyme SalI at the 5′ end of the sequence shown above. The oligonucleotides were hybridized to each other, and double-stranded DNA was prepared by the Klenow-mediated fill-in reaction. The G-less cassette was cloned into the SalI and NruI restriction sites of plasmid pTbU2_BS-12/-2b thereby replacing the U2 snRNA coding region. pTbU2_BS-12/-2b is a derivative from mutant BS-12/-2 (7Fantoni A. Dare A.O. Tschudi C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2021-2028Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and was generated by removing a SalI site in the vector. Two U2 G-less cassette mutants were obtained. TbU2_GLa contains the G-less cassette sequence as shown above, whereas TbU2_GLb lacks three of the five 3′-terminal thymidine residues. Therefore, transcription of TbU2_GLb is expected to terminate 10 nt downstream at the putative endogenous termination signal. Standard transcription reactions were carried out with TbU2_GLb, because this template reproducibly gave rise to stronger transcription signals. The extra sequence in TbU2_GLb contains a guanosine residue. Thus, RNase T1 cleavage at this site will trim TBU2_GLb RNA to the same size as RNA obtained from TbU2_GLa (see Fig. 2B). Mutant pTbU2_GL-B52 is a derivative of pTbU2_GLb carrying six point mutations in the upstream B box element(7Fantoni A. Dare A.O. Tschudi C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2021-2028Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Transfections, RNA isolation, primer extension analysis, and Northern blot hybridizations were carried out as described(7Fantoni A. Dare A.O. Tschudi C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2021-2028Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 8Nakaar V. Dare A.O. Hong D. Ullu E. Tschudi C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6736-6742Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The following oligonucleotides were used in primer extension analysis and/or Northern blot hybridizations: U2k(14Günzl A. Cross M. Bindereif A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 468-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), complementary to nucleotides 128 to 148 of the U2 snRNA; GLESS_PE, 5′-GAGTGAATGATGATAGATTTG-3′, complementary to nucleotides +75 to +94 of the U2 G-less cassette gene. A 2-liter culture of the procyclic forms of T. brucei rhodesiense strain YTaT 1.1 was grown as described previously (15Tschudi C. Ullu E. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 455-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) to a density of 1 × 107 cells per ml. Cells were harvested at room temperature, yielding a packed cell volume of 2 to 2.5 ml. The pellet was rinsed twice with 10 ml of wash solution (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2) and once with 10 ml of ice-cold transcription buffer (150 mM sucrose, 20 mM potassium L-glutamate (Sigma), 10 mM Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin). The following steps were carried out at 4° C. Cells were finally resuspended in 1.5 times packed cell volume of transcription buffer, preincubated for 5 minutes, and broken in a 7-ml dounce with a type A pestle by applying rapid strokes continuously for about 10 min, until the vast majority of cells were broken. The resulting cell extract was spun in an Eppendorf centrifuge at 4,000 × g for 10 min, the supernatant was removed, and the pellet was subjected to another spin for 2 min at 16,000 × g. The final pellet was resuspended in an equal volume of transcription buffer. KCl was added to a final concentration of 400 mM, and the nuclear fraction was extracted by rotating the tube at 4° C for 30 min. The extract was spun in an Eppendorf centrifuge for 10 min at 16,000 × g, and the supernatant was desalted using a Centricon-10 concentrator (Amicon) until the KCl concentration was around 40 mM. Final extracts ranged in protein concentration from 3 to 6 mg/ml and were stored at −70° C. No correlation was detected between protein concentrations within this range and extract activity. A standard transcription reaction was carried out in a volume of 25 μl containing 10 μl of nuclear extract. The reaction further contained 1 μg of circular plasmid DNA (40 μg/ml final concentration), 20 mM potassium L-glutamate, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 2 mM ATP, 0.8 mM CTP, 0.8 mM 3′-O-methyl-GTP (3′-OMeGTP), 5 μM UTP, 0.26 μM [α-32P]UTP (20 μCi), 20 mM creatine phosphate, 0.48 mg/ml creatine kinase, 3% polyethylene glycol, 10 units of RNase T1 (Calbiochem), 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. Unless otherwise stated, the reaction was conducted at 28° C for 90 min and stopped by the addition of 400 μl of HES buffer (5 mM Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 5 mM EDTA, 0.5% SDS, 0.3 M NaAc, 5 μg/ml tRNA). The RNA products were extracted with an equal volume of buffered phenol/chloroform (1:1), precipitated from the aqueous phase with ethanol, and analyzed on 6% polyacrylamide/50% urea gels. Following electrophoresis, the gels were dried and transcription signals were visualized by autoradiography and quantitated by phosphorimaging (Molecular Dynamics). In transcription reactions without radioactive labeled UTP, the unlabeled UTP concentration was raised to 0.8 mM; in reactions without 3′-OMeGTP, GTP was added to a final concentration of 0.8 mM. For the time course experiments, the standard reaction was scaled up 10 times, and 25-μl aliquots were removed at specified time intervals. A standard transcription reaction in the absence of radiolabeled nucleotides was carried out, and the RNA products were purified and analyzed by primer extension with radiolabeled oligonucleotide GLESS_PE. With the same oligonucleotide chain-terminating cycle, sequencing of the plasmid pTBU2_GLb was conducted using the ΔTaq™ cycle sequencing kit (United States Biochemical Corp.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. In the past, we repeatedly attempted to prepare cell-free T. brucei extracts active in transcription and capable of supporting correct transcription initiation of tRNA and 5 S rRNA genes. One of the major problems we encountered was the abundance of nonspecific labeling activities in our extracts which made it impossible to detect specific transcription signals. As an alternative strategy, we decided to apply the G-less cassette approach (11Sawadogo M. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4394-4398Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar) to the RNA polymerase III-transcribed U2 snRNA gene, since this approach is very efficient in removing nonspecifically labeled RNAs and has been previously employed to establish an in vitro transcription system for the human U1 snRNA gene(11Sawadogo M. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4394-4398Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). A G-less cassette gene lacks cytosine residues in the transcribed strand and thus gives rise to guanosine-less (G-less) RNAs. Transcription reactions are supplemented with the RNA chain-terminating nucleotide 3′-OMeGTP to suppress nonspecific transcription either from cryptic promoters in the template DNA or from genomic DNA contamination present in the extract and with RNase T1 to further degrade nonspecific transcripts and to trim RNAs generated by readthrough transcription (see Fig. 2 for a more detailed description). Since the first 24 nucleotides of the U2 snRNA coding region are essential for in vivo expression(7Fantoni A. Dare A.O. Tschudi C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2021-2028Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), we first determined whether the three guanosine residues in this element could be replaced without affecting transcription efficiency. We therefore randomly substituted the guanosine residues at position +11, +12, and +20 relative to the transcription start site with adenosine, thymidine, and cytidine residues and analyzed the effect of these mutations in vivo by transient transfection of trypanosome cells. As shown in Fig. 1, this analysis revealed that the six different combinations of G replacements tested did not significantly reduce the transcription efficiency of the U2 snRNA gene. This result made it possible to construct the G-less U2 snRNA gene schematically outlined in Fig. 2A. In the U2 snRNA gene, all Gs were replaced by As from position +1 to +74 of the RNA sequence. In addition, to prevent possible premature termination by RNA polymerase III, we disrupted stretches of three Ts by one T to C transition. To the 3′ end of the coding region we attached a gene-specific tag which included five 3′-terminal thymidine residues for efficient transcription termination by RNA polymerase III. Finally, the guanosine residues immediately upstream of the transcription start site up to position −9 were replaced by adenosine residues, since we have previously shown that these sequences are not essential for U2 snRNA gene expression in vivo(7Fantoni A. Dare A.O. Tschudi C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2021-2028Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). These substitutions will allow us to distinguish between correct initiation at position +1, which should give rise to a transcript of 97 nt, and nonspecific readthrough transcription, which instead will produce a 106-nt-long transcript (Fig. 2A). The final U2 G-less cassette gene was then tested in vivo by transient DNA transfection. Northern blot analysis revealed that the transcript is indeed 97 nt long (Fig. 2C, lane U2_GLa). In the process of cloning the U2 G-less cassette, we isolated a second construct, TbU2_GLb, which differed only at the very 3′ end (Fig. 2B) and produced an approximately 8-nt longer transcript (Fig. 2C, lane 3), most likely terminating at a stretch of Ts at positions +157 to +160 of the U2 snRNA gene(16Tschudi C. Richards F.F. Ullu E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 8893-8903Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Primer extension with an oligonucleotide complementary to the tag resulted in a product whose size is consistent with transcription initiation at position +1 (Fig. 2D). Thus, both U2 G-less cassette genes are expressed in vivo and initiate at the correct site. Based on our experience with permeabilized trypanosome cells and on our previous attempts to prepare transcriptionally active extracts(17Ullu E. Tschudi C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3319-3326Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), 3 3A. Günzl, C. Tschudi, and E. Ullu, unpublished data. we introduced several modifications to the protocol of Dignam et al.(12Dignam D.L. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9149) Google Scholar). Most notably, we replaced glycerol in all our buffers by sucrose. Extracts containing glycerol were not able to maintain a stable ATP pool even in the presence of an ATP regenerating machinery. Next, we broke trypanosome cells by douncing in an isotonic solution. Douncing of T. brucei cells in hypotonic conditions results in substantial leakage of nuclear contents into the cytoplasmic fraction (16, data not shown). Finally, potassium chloride was substituted with potassium glutamate in all buffers, because transcription in permeabilized cells is not inhibited by a wide range of salt concentrations when the transcription buffer contained potassium glutamate (data not shown, see also (18Leirmo S. Harrison C. Cayley D.S. Burgess R.R. Record M.T. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 2095-2101Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar)). After varying extract preparation procedures, testing different extract fractions, and trying out different reaction conditions, we eventually were able to detect a weak signal of the correct size. In order to improve the transcription efficiency, we varied a number of components in the incubation mixture. Most dramatically was the addition of polyethylene glycol, a compound which reduces the reaction volume and, therefore, can increase transcription efficiencies. We found that polyethylene glycol at a final concentration of 3% resulted in an approximately 20-fold increase of the specific transcription signal (data not shown). In vitro transcription was sensitive to small changes of the magnesium chloride concentration, and maximal synthesis occurred at 2.5 mM MgCl2 (Fig. 3). Changing the potassium glutamate concentration from 10 to 75 mM did not significantly affect transcription of the U2 G-less cassette gene, whereas a further increase to 100 mM reduced the signal by 70%. However, in agreement with data obtained with the permeabilized cell system(17Ullu E. Tschudi C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3319-3326Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), KCl concentrations above 30 mM reduced the transcription signal by more than 80% (data not shown). Specific transcription was dependent upon addition of exogenous DNA, and the strongest signal was obtained at a concentration of 40 μg/ml (data not shown). Finally, we determined that adding 5 μM unlabeled UTP enhanced the transcription signal by about one-third (data not shown). Taken together, these optimizations increased the transcription reaction efficiency more than a 100-fold. Fig. 4 shows an array of reaction conditions that illustrate the effects of the addition of template, 3′-OMeGTP, and RNase T1. The control reaction lacking all three components gives rise to bands superimposed on a smear on the autoradiograph (lane 1). The generation of these RNA molecules may be due to end-labeling of RNAs or to endogenous transcription from chromatin present in the extract. Although the effect of template addition is hard to detect because of the high background, a faint band of 105 nt, which is not present in the control reaction, can be seen when TbU2_GLb was added (lane 2). RNase T1 removes the labeling background by degrading all but the G-less cassette RNAs (lane 3). The two remaining bands correspond to correctly initiated (97 nt) and readthrough transcripts (106 nt). The further addition of the chain terminator 3′-OMeGTP blocked nonspecific readthrough transcription and enhanced the specific product (lane 4). Finally, high magnesium concentrations prevent correct transcription initiation and enhance nonspecific readthrough transcription, so that the 106-nt product becomes detectable even in the presence of 3′-OMeGTP (lane 5). To determine the transcription start site, the in vitro transcription reaction was conducted in the absence of labeled UTP, and total RNA was subjected to primer extension analysis with an oligonucleotide complementary to the U2 G-less cassette tag. As shown in Fig. 5, this analysis gave rise to one major band corresponding to correct initiation at position +1(16Tschudi C. Richards F.F. Ullu E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 8893-8903Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Fig. 6 shows a time course of the in vitro transcription reaction. There is a distinct lag phase of about 10 min after which a faint signal can be detected on a long exposure. The lag phase most likely reflects the time needed to assemble transcription initiation complexes. A linear increase then occurs between 20 and 90 min, when a plateau is reached. Studies with permeabilized T. brucei cells showed that a concentration of 2 μg/ml α-amanitin had only a moderate effect on transcription of the U2 snRNA gene by RNA polymerase III, whereas 100 μg/ml α-amanitin inhibited U2 snRNA synthesis by more than 90%(7Fantoni A. Dare A.O. Tschudi C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2021-2028Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In the in vitro system, α-amanitin concentration of 2 μg/ml did not significantly affect transcription of the U2 G-less cassette gene (an average decrease of 13%), but a concentration of 100 μg/ml reduced transcription to undetectable levels (Fig. 7, lanes 2-4). To verify this result, we used the RNA polymerase III-specific inhibitor tagetitoxin(19Steinberg T.H. Mathews D.E. Durbin R.D. Burgess R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 499-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar to what was observed in permeabilized cells(7Fantoni A. Dare A.O. Tschudi C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2021-2028Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), tagetitoxin concentrations of 15 μM and 60 μM inhibited in vitro transcription of the U2 snRNA gene by 52% and 75%, respectively (Fig. 7, lanes 5-7). Hence, we conclude that in vitro transcription of the U2 G-less cassette gene is mediated by RNA polymerase III. To further test the validity of the in vitro system, we examined the effect of mutations in a known regulatory element of the U2 snRNA gene. Similar to what was observed in vivo(7Fantoni A. Dare A.O. Tschudi C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2021-2028Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), six point mutations within the upstream B box promoter element completely abolished U2 transcription in vitro (Fig. 7, lane 8), further indicating the close resemblance of the in vitro and in vivo systems. In this study we report the development of the first in vitro transcription system for the protozoan family Trypanosomatidae. This goal was achieved by adapting the G-less cassette approach to the RNA polymerase III-transcribed U2 snRNA gene of T. brucei. With this in vitro transcription system we are now in a position to identify and characterize transcription factors essential for U2 snRNA gene transcription."

Tumor-derived Py-4-1 cells were a source of murine endothelial cells, and they showed increased lymphocyte binding when incubated with TNFα. Py-4-1 cells stimulated with TNFα or LPS also had elevated levels of ICAM-l and VCAM RNAs, with maximum levels at 2 h. Developmental expression of adhesion receptors was assayed in murine yolk sacs and in cystic embryoid bodies (CEBs) that differentiate in vitro from murine embryonic stem cells. ICAM- l and VCAM RNAs were expressed in unstimulated yolk sacs and CEBs. Expression was inducible in CEBs by exposure to LPS at all developmental stages, beginning at day 6. The time course of RNA induction in CEBs was similar to that of the Py-4-l endothelial cell line. ICAM-l protein expression was localized to vascular and hematopoietic blood islands in the CEBs. These results show that embryonic cells respond to inflammatory mediators by up-regulating expression of vascular adhesion receptors, and they imply an early ontogeny for the endothelial cell signal transduction pathway necessary for leukocyte re-cruitment.—Heyward, S.

https://openalex.org/W2077847067,"The murine monoclonal antibody OPG2 is an excellent paradigm of natural RGD ligands and binds specifically to alpha IIb beta 3 integrin. A reactive Arg103-Tyr104-Asp105 (RYD) tripeptide is located in an extended loop, the third complementarity-determining region of the heavy chain (H3). When compared to other RGD ligands, the RYD tripeptide of OPG2 is unique, in that the side chains are fixed in a stable orientation that we have defined by x-ray crystallography. In this study, we express OPG2 H chain segments (Fd) and kappa chains as components of active, Fab heterodimers by coinfection of Spodoptera frugiperda cell lines with recombinant baculoviruses containing cDNA specific for each protein. Recombinant AP7 Fd segments are generated from the parent OPG2 Fd segments by replacement of Tyr104 with Gly, while recombinant AP7E Fd segments are produced from AP7 Fd segments, by exchange of Asp105 with Glu. Neither the free Fd segments nor the free kappa chains of OPG2 or AP7 can bind to alpha IIb beta 3. The AP7 Fab fragment, like the parent OPG2 Fab, binds strongly to purified alpha IIb beta 3 but weakly, if at all, to purified alpha V beta 3. The affinity of OPG2 and AP7 Fab fragments for gel-filtered platelets, whether nonstimulated or activated by 0.2 microM phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, is identical. As with other natural RGD ligands, the binding of recombinant OPG2 Fab or AP7 Fab fragments to purified alpha IIb beta 3 or to gel-filtered platelets is completely inhibited by the peptide RGDW or by addition of EDTA, AP7E Fab fragments do not bind at all to either purified alpha IIb beta 3 or platelets. Our results demonstrate, for the first time within a natural protein ligand, that the tripeptides RGD and RYD exhibit equivalent binding capacity and specificity for the integrin alpha IIb beta 3."
https://openalex.org/W2094647907,"Glutamine phosphoribosylpyrophosphate (PRPP) amidotransferase catalysis and regulation were studied using a new stable carbocyclic analog of PRPP, 1-αpyrophosphoryl-2-α,3-α-dihydroxy-4-β-cyclopentanemethanol-5-phosphate (cPRPP). Although cPRPP competes with PRPP for binding to the catalytic C site of the Escherichia coli enzyme, two lines of evidence demonstrate that cPRPP, unlike PRPP, does not promote an active enzyme conformation. First, cPRPP was not able to “activate” Cys1 for reaction with glutamine or a glutamine affinity analog. The ring oxygen of PRPP may thus be necessary for the conformation change that activates Cys1 for catalysis. Second, binding of cPRPP to the C site blocks binding of AMP and GMP, nucleotide end product inhibitors, to this site. However, the binding of nucleotide to the allosteric site was essentially unaffected by cPRPP in the C site. Since it is expected that nucleotide inhibitors would bind with low affinity to the active enzyme conformation, the nucleotide binding data support the conclusion that cPRPP does not activate the enzyme.

The glutamine PRPP amidotransferases from E. coli and B. subtilis are thus viewed as models for the enzyme from other organisms. The x-ray structure of the B. subtilis glutamine PRPP amidotransferase with bound nucleotide has been solved recently (32Zhou G. Smith J.L. Zalkin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6784-6789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme contains an NH2-terminal glutamine-binding domain (N-domain) that is joined to a COOH-terminal domain (C-domain) with sites for NH3-dependent synthesis of PRA and for end product inhibition by AMP and GMP. The N-domain has sequence and presumably structural similarity to the glutamine-binding N-domains of asparagine synthetase and glucosamine 6-phosphate synthase, enzymes that belong to a “purF” subfamily of amidotransferases (Zalkin, 1993). For this subfamily the N-domain contains an NH2-terminal active site cysteine residue that is essential for transfer of the glutamine amide to the second substrate.The C-domain contains two nucleotide sites, an allosteric A site in close proximity to a catalytic C site. The C site, which binds nucleotide in the crystal structure, is identified as a catalytic site by virtue of a PRPP-binding sequence motif (6Hershey H.V. Taylor M.W. Gene (Amst.). 1986; 43: 287-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar; 7Hove-Jensen B. Harlow K.W. King C.J. Switzer R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6765-6771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) which has also been identified as the active site in two other phosphoribosyltransferases (23Scapin G. Grubmeyer C. Sacchettini J.C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1287-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar; 4Eads J.C. Scapin G. Xu Y. Grubmeyer C. Sacchettini J.C. Cell. 1994; 78: 325-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Glutamine PRPP amidotransferase is not only a glutamine amidotransferase but is also a phosphoribosyltransferase. PRPP has been modeled into the glutamine PRPP amidotransferase C site in a position occupied by the ribose-5-phosphate moiety of AMP (32Zhou G. Smith J.L. Zalkin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6784-6789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The proximal A site, identified by bound nucleotide in the crystal structure, is between subunits of the enzyme tetramer. The proximity of the A and C sites is unusual and may contribute to the synergistic binding of AMP and GMP that is responsible for the synergistic end product inhibition (32Zhou G. Smith J.L. Zalkin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6784-6789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The mechanism of amide transfer from glutamine is unknown and it is an open question whether glutamine hydrolysis precedes, is concerted with, or occurs after attachment of the NH2 group to C-1 of PRPP. In the crystal structure of the inhibited B. subtilis glutamine PRPP amidotransferase containing bound AMP, the catalytic thiol of Cys1 in the N-domain and C-1 of PRPP modeled into the C-domain are separated by a 16-Å solvent-filled space (Fig. 1). There are thus at least two barriers to catalysis. First, the inhibited enzyme is in a conformation described as “open” in which the glutamine and PRPP sites are too far apart for catalysis. Second, although Cys1 is proximal to the interdomain boundary, its sulfhydryl group is sequestered in a cavity within the N-domain where it is inaccessible to glutamine. Given the very low rates of glutamine hydrolysis and reaction with glutamine affinity analogs in the absence of PRPP (Messenger and Zalkin, 1979), the latter substrate must somehow “activate” Cys1 for the initial steps of glutamine amide transfer.Due to chemical lability it has not been possible to investigate how binding of PRPP to the glutamine PRPP amidotransferase C site activates Cys1 for catalysis and what effect this interaction has on binding of nucleotides to the A and C sites. The present approach was to utilize a new stable PRPP analog, cPRPP, to further examine the geometry of the C site, the requirements for activation of Cys1 for amide transfer and the effect that a substrate analog has on nucleotide binding. The results demonstrate that cPRPP competes with PRPP for the C site and in addition can block binding of nucleotide to the C site. Yet, unlike PRPP, cPRPP does not activate Cys1 for catalysis. Furthermore, a mutation that reduces the affinity of nucleotide for the C site has no appreciable affect on PRPP or cPRPP binding, thus supporting the assignment of distinct ribose phosphate and purine base binding regions in the C site (32Zhou G. Smith J.L. Zalkin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6784-6789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESSynthesis of cPRPPThe PRPP analog cPRPP was synthesized as reported (21Parry R.J. Haridas K. Tetrahedron Lett. 1993; 34: 7013-7016Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In cPRPP a methylene carbon replaces the ring oxygen of PRPP. The compound was racemic because the starting materials employed in the synthesis were not asymmetric, and no resolutions were carried out. The compound used in these studies therefore consists of a mixture of equal parts of the two possible enantiomers, one of which corresponds in absolute configuration to the configuration of natural PRPP.Enzyme PurificationWild type E. coli glutamine PRPP amidotransferase and the P410W C site mutant enzyme were overproduced from plasmid pGZ14 and its mutant derivative, respectively, in E. coli strain TX358 (purF recA) as described (31Zhou G. Charbonneau H. Colman R.F. Zalkin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10471-10481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were harvested in late log phase from cultures grown in 2-liter flasks and were stored at −20°C prior to purification. The enzyme was purified (Mei and Zalkin, 1989) to approximately 95% homogeneity as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (12Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206048) Google Scholar). Enzyme at a concentration of approximately 20 mg/ml was stored at −20°C. Protein concentration was determined by A278 using the value 8.12 for a 1% solution (Messenger and 19Messenger L.J. Zalkin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3382-3392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Specific activity was typically 15-20 units/mg protein for the wild type enzyme and 7.5 units/mg protein for the P410W enzyme. A unit of activity is defined as the amount of enzyme needed to produce 1.0 μmol of glutamate/min.Enzyme AssayGlutamine-dependent activity was determined by measurement of the glutamate produced (Messenger and Zalkin, 1979). Reactions contained 0-0.5 mM PRPP (Sigma), 10 mM glutamine, 5 mM MgCl2, 0-1.0 mM cPRPP, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and approximately 40 ng of enzyme in a total volume of 0.1 ml. Incubation was at 37°C, usually for 10 min. Reactions were quenched in a boiling water bath for 30 s, and glutamate was determined by the glutamate dehydrogenase method (Messenger and Zalkin, 1979). Glutaminase activity in the absence of PRPP was determined by a similar procedure, but the enzyme concentration was increased 10-100-fold due to the low rate of reaction and samples were removed at timed intervals to accurately determine the rate of glutamate production. All assays were shown to be linear for at least 12 min, and rates were proportional to enzyme concentration over at least a 4-fold range.Inactivation by DONEnzyme (approximately 8 μg) was incubated at room temperature for 0-30 min in a mixture containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 50 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.5), 10 μM DON (Sigma) if present, 1.0 mM PRPP if present, and 1.0 mM cPRPP, if present, in a total volume of 0.1 ml. At specific times, 5-μl aliquots were removed and enzyme activity remaining was determined in the standard 0.5-ml assay for glutamate production (Messenger and Zalkin, 1979). The 100-fold dilution quenched the reaction of enzyme with DON.Nucleotide BindingNucleotide binding was determined by equilibrium dialysis (Zhou et al., 1994) using chambers of 100 μl. Chambers were separated by a 12,000-14,000 molecular weight cut off dialysis membrane (Spectrapore) that was stored in 200 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 20 mM MgCl2, and 0.01% sodium azide at 4°C. The membrane was blotted on filter paper before loading between the chambers. One chamber contained 200 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 20 mM MgCl2, 28 nM [2,8-3H] AMP, or 35 nM [8-3H]GMP (0.1 μCi), 0-4.6 mM unlabeled AMP or GMP, and 1.3 or 2.0 mM cPRPP, if present, in a total volume of 50 μl. The other chamber contained 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 200-300 μM enzyme subunit in a total volume of 50 μl. Radioactive purine nucleotides were purchased from Moravek Biochemicals, Inc. Dialysis was for 20 h at 4°C in a rotating apparatus. Samples of 40 μl were removed from each chamber and were counted for radioactivity.Data AnalysisData for substrate saturation by PRPP were fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation using Ultrafit software (Biosoft, Cambridge, United Kingdom). Ki was also calculated by the graphical method of Dixon (3Dixon M. Webb E.C. Enzymes. Longman Group, Ltd., London1979: 350-352Google Scholar) using Ultrafit. Equilibrium binding data were fitted to the Scatchard equation (24Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17759) Google Scholar) by non-linear regression using Ultrafit.RESULTSInhibition by cPRPPcPRPP was evaluated as a PRPP analog for glutamine PRPP amidotransferase. The data in Fig. 2 show that inhibition of the wild type enzyme by cPRPP was competitive with PRPP. The Km for PRPP of 53 ± 12 μM agrees with the value of 67 μM determined previously (Messenger and Zalkin, 1979). Inhibition data analyzed graphically by the method of Dixon (Dixon and Webb, 1979), shown in Fig. 3, yield a Ki of 116 ± 25 μM for cPRPP. Since the cPRPP preparation is a 1:1 racemic mixture (Parry and Haridas, 1993), the actual Ki for cPRPP is 58 ± 13 μM, a value that is similar to the Km for PRPP. We also examined the inhibition of a C site mutant enzyme by cPRPP. The P410W replacement in the C site decreases the binding affinity of AMP for the C site by 5-fold with a corresponding decrease in enzyme inhibition by AMP (Zhou et al., 1994). Inhibition of P410W by cPRPP was competitive with PRPP (data not shown). The Km of PRPP was 31 ± 5 μM and the Ki for cPRPP was 53 ± 5 μM, values not significantly different than those obtained for the wild type. Thus, cPRPP competes effectively with PRPP for the amidotransferase C site.Figure 2:Inhibition by cPRPP.

In contrast, some amidotransferases catalyze a glutaminase activity in which glutamine hydrolysis can be uncoupled from product formation (Zalkin, 1993). For example, glutamine hydrolysis in anthranilate synthase, a “trpG” subfamily amidotransferase, is dependent upon chorismate, the second substrate, and is assayed in the presence of EDTA which blocks synthesis of anthranilate (20Nagano H. Zalkin H. Henderson E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 3810-3820Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In cases where the rate of glutaminase activity is comparable to the overall rate of product formation, such as in the reaction catalyzed by anthranilate synthase, glutamine hydrolysis may reflect a step in the overall reaction. An active site cysteine is required for reaction of glutamine. For glutamine PRPP amidotransferase, the rate of PRPP-independent glutaminase activity was reported to be about 4% of the overall rate (Messenger and Zalkin, 1979). The limited capacity for glutamine hydrolysis in the absence of PRPP can now be explained by the finding of an inactive conformation for the nucleotide-inhibited enzyme (no PRPP in the C site) in which Cys1 is sequestered and is inaccessible to glutamine (26Smith J.L. Zaluzec E.J. Wery J-P. Niu L. Switzer R.L. Zalkin H. Satow Y. Science. 1994; 264: 1427-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). This information strongly implies that binding of PRPP to the C site is needed to “activate” Cys1. The effect of PRPP on glutaminase activity could not be determined previously since there was no way to uncouple glutamine hydrolysis from phosphoribosylamine production. We have therefore reinvestigated the glutaminase activity to determine whether cPRPP bound to the PRPP site can activate Cys1 for glutamine hydrolysis. Data summarized in Table 1 show a basal rate of PRPP-independent glutaminase that was 0.8% of the overall rate for reaction of glutamine with PRPP. This low rate of glutaminase was not stimulated by cPRPP. Ribose 5-P, on the other hand, stimulated the rate of glutaminase by 10-fold, as had been observed earlier (Messenger and Zalkin, 1979).TABLE I Open table in a new tab Affinity Labeling of Cys1Cys1 is an active site residue required for glutamine amide transfer. Affinity labeling of Cys1 with the glutamine analog DON is presumed to mimic the nucleophilic attack of Cys1 on the carboxamide of glutamine, resulting in release of ammonia and formation of a hypothetical γ-glutamyl-enzyme covalent intermediate (20Nagano H. Zalkin H. Henderson E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 3810-3820Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; 29Zalkin H. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1993; 66: 203-309PubMed Google Scholar). Nucleophilic attack of Cys1 on the δ-carbon of DON results in displacement of molecular dinitrogen and alkylation of Cys1. The data in Fig. 4 show, as reported previously (Messenger and Zalkin, 1979), that affinity labeling of Cys1 by DON was dependent upon PRPP. cPRPP did not support the reaction of DON with Cys1, confirming that cPRPP did not activate Cys1.Figure 4:Alkylation of Cys1 by DON. Enzyme was incubated with DON, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Reactions with PRPP are shown by (○), those with no PRPP, with cPRPP, or a control that did not contain DON, are all shown by (♦). Samples were removed from each incubation and were assayed for activity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Effect of cPRPP on Nucleotide BindingGlutamine PRPP amidotransferase is subject to allosteric end product inhibition by adenine and guanine nucleotides. AMP and GMP can each bind to two sites/subunit, the allosteric A site and catalytic C site (30Zhou G. Dixon J.E. Zalkin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21152-21159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Synergistic inhibition by AMP plus GMP results from synergistic binding of AMP to the C site and GMP to the A site. Availability of the stable competitive inhibitor cPRPP affords the opportunity to examine directly the expected competition between substrate analog and nucleotide for the C site and the consequences that cPRPP binding to the C site has on nucleotide binding to the A site. The lability of PRPP has precluded its use in equilibrium binding experiments. Equilibrium binding of GMP to the enzyme is shown in Fig. 5. GMP binding extrapolated to 1.7 eq nucleotide/subunit with a Kd of 220 μM (Table 2). In contrast to earlier experiments (1Brayton K.A. Chen Z. Zhou G. Nagy P. Gavalas A. Trent J.M. Deaven L.L. Dixon J.E. Zalkin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5313-5321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the Kd values of GMP for the A and C sites were not sufficiently different to be resolved. We infer that GMP was bound equally to the A and C sites (Table 2). In the presence of cPRPP the binding stoichiometry was reduced to 0.90 eq GMP/subunit. It is therefore reasonable to infer that binding of cPRPP to the C site blocked nucleotide binding to this site and marginally decreased the affinity of GMP for the A site. In a similar manner, cPRPP blocked binding of AMP to the C site (Table 2). In this case, however, perhaps as a result of an increased Kd, binding of AMP to the A site was not detected. Under the experimental conditions employed, binding of a ligand with a Kd > 1.0 mM would not be detected.Figure 5:Effect of cPRPP on GMP binding. Equilibrium dialysis was performed with 1.0 mM cPRPP (□) or without cPRPP (▪). Enzyme concentration was 84.25 μM (337 μM subunit).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)TABLE II Open table in a new tab To reduce the potential ambiguity of assigning bound nucleotide to A and C sites, we examined the effect of cPRPP on nucleotide binding to the P410W mutant. This C site replacement effectively decreases, below the limit of detection, the capacity of a single nucleotide to bind to the C site (1Brayton K.A. Chen Z. Zhou G. Nagy P. Gavalas A. Trent J.M. Deaven L.L. Dixon J.E. Zalkin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5313-5321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, approximately 1 eq of GMP could bind to the A site of this mutant and thus permitted synergistic binding of AMP to the mutant C site with a 5-fold increased Kd compared to the wild type. This suggests that the binding affinity for nucleotide to the mutant C site is reduced about 5-fold. Data in Table 2, line 5, show binding of 0.83 eq of GMP to the P410W mutant enzyme. The bound GMP is assigned to the A site by virtue of the preference of GMP for the A site (1Brayton K.A. Chen Z. Zhou G. Nagy P. Gavalas A. Trent J.M. Deaven L.L. Dixon J.E. Zalkin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5313-5321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the disabling mutation in the C site. Binding of GMP to the P410W A site was unperturbed by cPRPP (Table 2, line 6). Given the competitive inhibition and unchanged Ki for cPRPP, it is safe to infer saturation of the P410W C site by cPRPP. We next determined the capacity of GMP to bind to the A site under conditions that mimic saturation of the enzyme with the two substrates. For this purpose Cys1 was alkylated with the glutamine affinity analog DON until less than 3.2% of the glutamine-dependent activity remained. The enzyme was dialyzed to remove PRPP and residual unbound DON, and GMP binding was determined in the presence or absence of cPRPP. Data in Table 2, lines 7 and 8, show that the two substrate analogs had no significant effect on binding of GMP to the A site. The implications of this result on the capacity of these substrate analogs to promote an active enzyme conformation and influence nucleotide binding are discussed below.DISCUSSIONcPRPP is a stable substrate analog that competes with PRPP for the glutamine PRPP amidotransferase catalytic site. Interactions important for binding of PRPP to the C site can be inferred from the structural model of the homologous B. subtilis amidotransferase (32Zhou G. Smith J.L. Zalkin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6784-6789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All amino acids that interact with PRPP modeled into the C site are conserved in the E. coli enzyme and in all other glutamine PRPP amidotransferases for which sequences are available. These include interactions of Lys349 with the pyrophosphate β-phosphate, Arg371 with the 5-phosphate, and the 2- and 3-hydroxyls of PRPP with a Mg2+ ion. In addition, Thr304, Asp366, and Asp367, all numbered according to the E. coli sequence, and a water molecule contribute to the octahedral ligand field of the Mg2+. PRPP has been modeled into the C site with a C3-endo pucker to conform with the conformation of the ribose phosphate moiety of bound AMP (32Zhou G. Smith J.L. Zalkin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6784-6789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although it is not known whether the conformations of cPRPP and PRPP are identical, it is reasonable to expect the same groups to be involved in binding the substrate and substrate analog to the glutamine PRPP amidotransferase C site.The results of experiments reported here support the view that cPRPP competes with PRPP for the C site. First, enzyme inhibition was competitive with PRPP in the wild type and in a mutant with a partially disabled C site having a higher Kd for nucleotides. The Ki for cPRPP was not significantly different in the wild type and mutant enzymes, and these values were similar to the Km for PRPP in each case. Second, binding of cPRPP to the C site excluded binding of nucleotides to this site. Given these results we determined whether binding of cPRPP to the C site could promote formation of an active “closed” conformation of the enzyme. Two features are expected to distinguish closed and open conformations. (i) The ability of Cys1 to participate in glutamine hydrolysis and amide transfer will differ. In the feedback-inhibited inactive open conformation seen in the crystal structure, Cys1 is sequestered (32Zhou G. Smith J.L. Zalkin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6784-6789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is inaccessible to glutamine or DON, a glutamine affinity analog. Additionally, in this open conformation, the positions of Cys1 and bound PRPP are too far apart for N-transfer (32Zhou G. Smith J.L. Zalkin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6784-6789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our working hypothesis is that PRPP is required both to activate Cys1 for reaction with glutamine or DON by making it sterically accessible and to more favorably position the glutamine and PRPP sites for amide transfer. (ii) Nucleotide binding to closed and open enzyme conformations should differ. Based on the inaccessibility of Cys1 and its separation from the PRPP-binding site, it appears unlikely that substrates can bind with high affinity to the inhibited enzyme having nucleotides in the A and C sites (32Zhou G. Smith J.L. Zalkin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6784-6789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nucleotide bound to the allosteric A site which is between subunits of the tetrameric enzyme is likely responsible for the open conformation of the active site seen in the crystal structure of the inhibited enzyme. Likewise, nucleotides are expected to have a low binding affinity for the enzyme-substrate complex in the closed active conformation.By both criteria, cPRPP did not promote formation of the active conformation. First, binding of cPRPP to the C site did not activate Cys1 for reaction with glutamine or DON. Second, although binding of cPRPP to the C site excluded binding of AMP to this site in the wild type enzyme, binding of AMP or GMP to the A site was not perturbed in the wild type or in the P410W C site mutant, suggesting that the cPRPP♦enzyme complex was not in the active conformation. These results have implications for understanding catalysis and inhibition by nucleotides and are discussed below.There are at least three possibilities to account for the failure of cPRPP to activate Cys1 for reaction with glutamine and DON. First, cPRPP may assume a conformation different from that of PRPP, and consequently binding to the C site may not be identical for the substrate and substrate analog. This could result in different ligand-protein interactions that might account for t"
https://openalex.org/W2031494776,"Sodium-phosphate transport in the opossum kidney (OK) cell line was studied in an OK clonal cell line that was transfected with an episomal vector expressing high levels of rat calbindin (28 kDa). High level expression of calbindin buffered the influx of calcium induced by ionomycin by 53% and raised the basal intracellular calcium from 100 ± 6 to 150 ± 8 nM. The decrement in sodium phosphate uptake induced by parathyroid hormone or forskolin was identical in the two cell lines. However, phorbol esters (10-10-10-7M), which decreased sodium phosphate uptake in the parental OK line, increased it in the calbindin-expressing line. Similarly, the parental clone did not respond to phosphate deprivation, while the calbindin-expressing clone did increase phosphate uptake in response to phosphate deprivation. In the calbindin-expressing cells, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate or low phosphate medium, which increased phosphate transport, produced actin filament aggregation, dissociation of the myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate protein from sub-apical actin, and membrane-associated tyrosine phosphate staining. Agonists that reduced sodium phosphate uptake (cAMP, parathyroid hormone) did not affect these cellular features. The cytoskeletal rearrangement, redistribution of the myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate protein, and membrane tyrosine phosphorylation are suggested to be involved in the events by which phosphate transport is increased in this cell line."
