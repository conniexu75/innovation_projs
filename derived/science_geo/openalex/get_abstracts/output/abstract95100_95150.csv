https://openalex.org/W2093111935,"Infants 18 to 20 weeks old recognize the correspondence between auditorially and visually presented speech sounds, and the spectral information contained in the sounds is critical to the detection of these correspondences. Some infants imitated the sounds presented during the experiment. Both the ability to detect auditory-visual correspondences and the tendency to imitate may reflect the infant's knowledge of the relationship between audition and articulation."
https://openalex.org/W2023642970,"Localization of the anatomic substrate for anticonvulsant activity mediated by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) was examined using intracerebral injections of GABA agonists. Blockade of tonic hindlimb extension in the maximal electroshock test and blockade of tonic and clonic seizures produced by pentylenetetrazole and bicuculline were obtained by elevating GABA in the ventral midbrain tegmentum. Elevation of GABA in forebrain and hindbrain areas had no effect on convulsant activity. Blockade of tonic and clonic seizures was also obtained after microinjections of the direct GABA receptor agonist, muscimol, into the midbrain. The substantia nigra was identified as the critical midbrain site for GABA-mediated anticonvulsant activity. Local injection of GABA agonists into the midbrain provided seizure protection without a widespread augmentation of GABA-mediated activity throughout the brain and without impairing either alertness or motor function. Synapses in the substantia nigra appear to represent an important control mechanism for inhibiting the propagation of generalized convulsions."

Brain activity was recorded from the left and right frontal and parietal scalp regions. In two studies, infants showed greater activation of the left frontal than of the right frontal area in response to the happy segments. Parietal asymmetry failed to discriminate between the conditions. Differential lateralization of the hemispheres for affective processes seems to be established by 10 months of age."
https://openalex.org/W2003013739,"When Drosophila cells are shifted from 25 degrees C to 37 degrees C, the synthesis of a small group of proteins (the heat shock proteins or HSPs) is rapidly induced, while most preexisting synthesis is repressed. On return to normal growing temperatures, synthesis of HSPs is gradually repressed and normal synthesis is restored. We show that production of HSP 70 (the major heat-induced protein in these cells) is quantitatively correlated with the degree of stress. The level of synthesis is controlled both transcriptionally and posttranscriptionally through repression of HSP 70 mRNA synthesis and destabilization of HSP 70 transcripts. These regulatory mechanisms depend upon the accumulation of the HSPs themselves; when the production of functional HSPs is blocked, HS transcription continues and HS mRNAs are stable, accumulating in vast quantities; if the block is released, a specific quantity of functional HSP must accumulate before HS transcription is repressed and preexisting HS mRNAs are destabilized. Evidence is also presented that indicates that the same quantity of HSP 70 is required to release the block in normal protein synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2000092309,"We have attempted to determine whether any cellular genes are activated as a result of the action of the adenoviral E1A gene. The proteins synthesized in uninfected HeLa cells have been compared to those produced in early adenovirus infected cells. At least one protein, absent from uninfected HeLa cells, was synthesized in large amounts following adenovirus infection. This 70 kd protein was not synthesized in cells infected with the E1A mutant dl312, even when the multiplicity of infection with the mutant was such that the only viral gene not expressed was the E1A gene. Thus the induction of the 70 kd protein requires the expression of the viral E1A gene. The 70 kd protein was also induced by heat shock in uninfected cells. The same 70 kd protein is synthesized in 293 cells, a line of human embryonic kidney cells transformed by a fragment of adenovirus DNA. These cells constitutively express the E1A and E1B genes."
https://openalex.org/W2036648250,"The structural filament network of the nucleus is prepared while still connected to the cytoskeleton. The relatively gentle procedure removes about 98% of the DNA and at least 86% of the histones. The matrix is bounded by an outer nuclear lamina connected to the cytoskeletal framework, as well as the inner filaments. The filaments range in diameter from 3 to 22 nm, and are organized in a three-dimensional anastomosing network in which nucleoli are enmeshed. The nuclear matrix is separated from the cytoskeletal framework by a double detergent and then partitioned into a chromatin fraction and a matrix fraction by nuclease and high salt. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis shows that the proteins of the cytoskeleton, chromatin and nuclear matrix are very different. A major protein found in all fractions cofocuses with actin. Vimentin is largely associated with the nuclear matrix, probably as a corona external of filaments."
https://openalex.org/W2166256336,"We have studied the structure and transcription of a cloned human β-globin gene from a fetus diagnosed for β0 thalassemia. The sequence of the β0 gene differs from that of a normalβ-globin gene at positions 1 and 74 of the second intervening sequence (IVS2). The position 1 change alters the GT dinucleotide conserved at 5′ splice sites, while the position 74 change is a common sequence polymorphism. When the cloned β0 gene is introduced into HeLa cells by use of an SV40-derived plasmid vector, two abnormally spliced cytoplasmic β-globin RNAs are detected. The predominant RNA differs from normal β-globin mRNA by the insertion of the first 47 nucleotides of IVS2 between exons 2 and 3. The less abundant RNA comprises the normal first exon spliced directly to the third. Analysis of nuclear RNA suggests that the β0 transcript is inefficiently spliced and that the removal of the two intervening sequences is coupled."
https://openalex.org/W2001818020,"Negative superhelical coiling of covalently closed DNA plasmids facilitates the formation of left-handed Z-DNA segments. This was demonstrated by binding of antibodies specific for Z-DNA. Plasmid pBR322 and two derivatives from it, pLP32 and pLP014, carrying inserts of alternating CG sequences of 32 bp and 14 bp, respectively, were used. Longer inserts required less negative superhelical density to induce the B-Z transitions. Antibody binding to supercoiled plasmids was also visualized by electron microscopy. Cross-linking of the antibody to the negatively supercoiled plasmid and restriction of the DNA with restriction endonucleases demonstrated that the antibodies combine with the CG insert in pLP32. For pBR322, however, evidence suggests that the antibody combines with a section of DNA containing 14 bases with alternating purine and pyrimidine residues with one residue out of alternation: CACGGGTGCGCATG. These cross-linking studies provide evidence for the binding specificity of the anti-Z-DNA antibodies. On the basis of experimental findings, we have calculated the changes in free energy associated with B-Z transitions in superhelical plasmids."
https://openalex.org/W2069430618,"Cultured preadipose 3T3 cells are induced or enabled to undergo adipose conversion in the presence of an extract of pituitary gland. Adipogenic activity is found in standard growth hormone preparations derived from different species. Further purification of rat growth hormone by several methods does not remove its adipogenic activity. Human growth hormone synthesized in Escherichia coli is also effective. Adipogenic activity is not associated with other pituitary polypeptides. Since growth hormone acts on preadipose cells in the absence of any other cell type, a mechanism exists for the direct participation of the pituitary gland in the regulation of this form of mesenchymal differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2004776010,"Using synchronized cultures of V79-8 Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts, we either alternately labeled early- and late-replicating DNA, or substituted one of these with bromodeoxyuridine to separate them in CsCI density gradients or to identify the bromodeoxyuridine-containing chromosome bands by fluorescence microscopy. The Giemsa light R bands were shown to replicate in the first half of S phase, and the dark G bands were shown to replicate in the last half of S phase. S phase was bimodal, with a distinct pause in the rate of DNA synthesis that separated the period of R-band DNA synthesis from that of G-band DNA synthesis. G-band DNA was found to be 3.2% richer in AT than R-band DNA. Surprisingly, G- and R-band DNA appeared equally transcriptionally active in that alternate labels in chromatin were digested with the same kinetics by DNAase I, and in reassociation experiments, total poly(A)+ RNA drove nick-translated G- and R-band DNA probes similarly. G- and R-band DNA also reassociated with identical kinetics, demonstrating that they contain equal proportions of all kinetic-complexity classes of sequences."
https://openalex.org/W1963932700,"We have isolated a gene encoding one of the 19,000 dalton zein proteins from a maize genomic library constructed in Charon 4A. This gene occurs on a 7.7 kb Eco RI fragment, and based on Southern hybridization analysis, represents one of several homologous sequences present in the maize genome. The nucleotide sequence of the gene predicts a protein composed of 235 amino acids, including a signal peptide of 21 amino acids. There are no intervening sequences in the gene. By comparing the nucleotide sequence of this gene with that of a homologous cDNA clone, we have identified a basis for microheterogeneity within the gene family. The 5′ nucleotide sequences of the genomic and cDNA clones are identical, but they differ in the center of the protein, where repeated amino acid sequences occur. A nucleotide sequence encoding a conserved peptide of 20 amino acids is repeated nine times in the center of both of these clones."

https://openalex.org/W1992555811,"Quiescent Chinese hamster ovary cells, as well as three other types of quiescent cells, synthesize histone at a reduced but significant rate. The variant patterns of the histone synthesis in quiescent, S-phase and G1-phase and G2-phase cells ali differed from each other. H3.3 was the only H3 variant synthesized in quiescent and in G1 and G2 cells. All four H2A variants were synthesized in quiescent and S-phase cells, but only H2A.X and H2A.Z were synthesized in G1 and G2 cells. No part of G1 or the G1-S transition could be found with an H2A synthesis pattern like that in quiescent cells. These findings suggest that the quiescent state is not part of G1, but that it is a separate and discrete state."

Residues of DDE in addled eggs showed a significant inverse relation, confirming the effects of this toxicant on bald eagle reproduction at the population level and the effectiveness of the ban on DDT. The recovery from DDE contamination in bald eagles appears to be occurring much more rapidly than predicted."
https://openalex.org/W2026741378,"The ATP analog 5′-adenylyl imidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP) inhibits transcription of specific genes by the RNA polymerase II contained in whole cell extracts, not only with promoters that contain A as the first nucleotide of the transcript, but also with those that initiate transcripts with G or U. The analog AMP-PNP (a competitive inhibitor of ATP) probably acts at the level of initiation of transcription, but it can be used for elongation by RNA polymerase II in isolated nuclei or in the whole cell extract. AMPPNP and the other imidotriphosphates have little effect on purified HeLa cell RNA polymerase II initiation and elongation of transcription. Since RNA polymerase III in the crude system both initiates and elongates transcripts with AMP-PNP, we conclude that the availability of the β-γ bond of ATP is an indispensable requirement for faithful and specific in vitro initiation only by RNA polymerase II in the whole cell extract. Uncapped U- or G-initiated transcripts were obtained in the presence of UMPPNP or GMP-PNP, the respective imidodiphosphate analogs. The presence of the 5′-terminal imidotriphosphate at the same oligonucleotide as the cap for U-initiated precursors established that transcription initiation and capping occur at the same site. Capping is not required for transcription by RNA polymerase II in the in vitro system. Methylation of the 2′ ribose of the initiating nucleotide does not occur on the imidonucleotide containing 5′ ends of adenovirus EIV or murine leukemia virus long terminal repeat."
https://openalex.org/W2001831532,"Hybridization studies with viral oncogene probes indicate that c-myc, the cellular gene homologous to the transforming gene of avian myelocytomatosis virus, resides on mouse chromosome 15 and in many plasmacytomas is translocated to the antibody heavy chain gene locus on chromosome 12. The transcriptional orientation of the translocated c-myc sequence is opposite the orientation of the adjacent C alpha gene that codes for the heavy chain of immunoglobulin A. The translocated c-myc sequence is not the same oncogene detected in urine plasmacytomas by the NIH-3T3 cell transformation assay."
https://openalex.org/W1968560825,"The noncytopathic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus displays a tropism for the anterior lobe of the murine pituitary gland. Virus replicates in cells that make growth hormone. This results in a diminished synthesis of growth hormone with a concomitant clinical picture of retarded growth and hypoglycemia. However, there is no morphologic evidence of either cell necrosis or inflammation in the anterior lobe of the pituitary. Hence, during infection in vivo, a noncytopathic virus may turn off the ""differentiation"" or ""luxury"" function of a cell while not killing that cell (loss of vital function). This in turn can disrupt homeostasis and cause disease. This model illustrates a novel way whereby viruses may cause disease."
https://openalex.org/W2083568793,"We have analyzed the interactions of platelets and platelet-secreted proteins with proteins bound to glass substrata. Using a newly developed radioactive crosslinking reagent, N-succinimidyl-3-[(2-nitro-4-azidophenyl)-2-aminoethyldithio] propionate, we observed crosslinking between thrombospondin released from the platelets and surface-bound fibronectin or collagen. The crosslinking was selective and specific, since thrombospondin showed little crosslinking to substratum-bound bovine serum albumin or ovalbumin, even though it bound to these surfaces. Furthermore, although albumin and fibrinogen released by platelets bound to fibronectincoated substrata as well as did thrombospondin, these two proteins crosslinked at much lower levels than seen for thrombospondin. Interaction between fibronectin and thrombospondin was confirmed by affinity chromatography. These results suggest that thrombospondin and fibronectin may interact during platelet-substratum adhesion or during platelet-platelet aggregation, or both."
https://openalex.org/W1995691593,"Planktivorous sunfish of various sizes were studied to ascertain whether growth-related changes in the retina are related to the ability to capture small planktonic crustaceans. Behaviorally, the larger fish detected and captured crustaceans that subtended smaller visual angles. Histological examination of the retinas revealed that the distance between cones, measured in minutes of visual angle, decreased as the animals grew, suggesting that the larger retinas could resolve smaller objects. These correlated behavioral and anatomical results suggest that improved visual resolution contributes to improved predation. This finding provides a selective advantage for the continuous retinal growth noted in many fish."
https://openalex.org/W2071202800,"The transcription unit that encodes beta-globin (major) mRNA has been examined by analysis of nascent labeled RNA from the nuclei of mouse erythroleukemia cells treated with agents that induce beta-globin formation. More than 95% of the time, transcription appears to terminate within a region 1400 +/- 100 nucleotides downstream from the poly(A) site. The nuclei of mouse erythroleukemia cells treated with agents that induce beta-globin synthesis showed a 10 to 20 fold stimulation of transcription assayed by chain elongation of beta-globin RNA sequences, including sequences downstream from the poly(A) site. Associated with the increase in transcription was a generalized increase in sensitivity to DNAase treatment of globin genomic DNA in whole nuclei. A DNAase I-hypersensitive site in the vicinity of the cap site was also found to be prominent in induced cells."
https://openalex.org/W1985061091,"A series of uniflagellar mutants isolated following mutagenesis of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (strain 137c) with ICR-191 show a remarkable positional phenotype. The flagellum that fails to develop is cis to the eyespot in more than 95% of the cells examined. Both the positional and the uniflagellar phenotypes are transmitted stably through mitotic and meiotic divisions, and in backcrosses the meiotic segregation is two mutant to two wild-type progeny. Four of the mutants, uni1, uni2, uni3 and uni4, have been studied extensively. They appear to be alleles of a single gene locus or to be closely linked (less than or equal to 0.06 map units). The characteristic expression of the uniflagellar defect in cells under different growth conditions or in stable diploids indicates that the mutations alter the rate of development of the flagellum in the cis-eyespot flagellum. Electron microscopic studies suggest that the developmental defect resides in the basal body. Extensive recombination analysis to 33 nuclear markers representing the 16 linkage groups failed to establish linkage. The uni mutants, however, showed linkage to four unmapped mutant loci. Mutations for each of these loci also affect flagellar assembly."
https://openalex.org/W2101720727,"The A6S/2 tumor incited on tobacco by Agrobacterium tumefaciens harboring the octopine-type A6 Ti plasmid contains one insert of Ti-plasmid sequences (the T DNA). This 13 kb insert is derived from a colinear sequence in the Ti plasmid (the T region) and becomes attached to plant DNA in the nucleus of the host cell. We have determined the DNA sequence encompassing the left end of the T region of the A6 Ti plasmid and the corresponding portion of the A6S/2 T DNA. The two sequences are identical for at least 806 bp. To the left of the divergence point, the tumor contains five partially overlapping sequences that are direct or inverted repeats of sequences to the right of the divergence point. The Ti plasmid contains only the right member of each of these repeats. We have also performed heteroduplex studies that indicate that this T DNA has a 520 bp inverted repeat of an internal sequence at the right end near its junction with plant DNA. The repeated sequences near the ends of the T DNA resemble the repeats of adenovirus type 12 sequences found near its junction with host DNA. We discuss data suggesting that the 23 bp to the immediate right of the divergence point of the A6 left junction form a site important in some step in the transfer of T-region DNA from the bacteria to the plant."
https://openalex.org/W2075133700,"Recent studies of the esc+ gene suggest that its product acts principally in the initiation, but not the maintenance, of segmental determination. We have tested this hypothesis by examining when the esc+ gene product is required during embryogenesis, and whether the esc+ gene product is required for the stable determination of imaginal disc cells passaged in in vivo culture. We find that the esc+ gene product is required during a discrete period of embryogenesis. If the gene product is absent or inactive during this period, most segments develop like the eighth abdominal segment. In contrast, absence of active gene product before or after this period has relatively little effect on segmental development. These results support the hypothesis that the esc+ gene product has a discrete early function in the initiation of segmental determination."
https://openalex.org/W2142091439,"Reversion analysis of mutants of unc-22 IV, a gene affecting muscle structure and function in Caenorhabditis elegans, led to the isolation of six extragenic dominant suppressors of the “twitching” phenotype of unc-22 mutants. All six suppressors are new alleles of unc-54 I, the major body wall myosin heavy chain gene. Homozygous suppressor strains are slow, stiff and have normal muscle structure, whereas previously identified unc-54 alleles confer flaccid paralysis and drastic reduction in thick filament number and organization. Placement of the three suppressor mutations s74, s77 and s95 on the genetic fine structure map of unc-54 demonstrates that they are clustered near the right end of the map. Since this end of the gene corresponds to the 5′ end of the coding sequence, these suppressor mutations probably result in amino acid substitutions in the globular head of the myosin molecule, and should be of value in studies of myosin force generation."
https://openalex.org/W2148665498,"Transcriptional analysis of SV40 late promoter mutants indicates that the DNA sequence 5'-GGTACCTAACC-3' (map positions 294-304) is important in the control of SV40 late RNA expression. C to T base substitutions at map positions 298, 299 and 304 increased initiation of late RNA synthesis at map position 325 five to ten fold. G to A base substitutions at map positions 294 and 295 decreased RNA initiation by a factor of 2 to 3. Deletion of nucleotides 295-298 reduced RNA initiation by a factor of 4 to 5. S1 analysis of in vivo RNA, isolated 24-36 hr after infection, demonstrated that the four base deletion not only decreased RNA initiation at nucleotide 325, but also increased RNA initiation at three alternate sites located approximately 125 nucleotides upstream from the major late RNA initiation site."
https://openalex.org/W2061657917,"The assembly of hexon, the major capsid protein of adenovirus, was investigated with the use of conformation-specific monoclonal antibodies. The hexon capsomere is a trimer of three identical monomers folded into a highly conserved and stable structure. The unique nature of this structure is indicated by the lack of common antigenic determinants between the capsomere and either monomeric or denatured hexon. The assembly of the trimer requires the action of a nonvirion protein, the 100K protein. The virus-encoded 100K protein forms a tight complex with hexon polypeptides. This 100K-hexon complex can form on the polyribosomes while hexon is a nascent chain. Exclusion chromatography revealed that the complex has a molecular weight of 800,000. The complex contains only pretrimer hexon; no mature hexon capsomeres can be found bound to 100K. Kinetic analysis of hexon trimerization and hexon-100K binding indicated that trimerization and the release of hexon from the complex occur concomitantly."
https://openalex.org/W2043023902,"Detergent-extracted whole mount preparations of human neutrophilic polymorphonuclear leukocytes (neutrophils) were used to study centrosome position and microtubule organization during random, chemokinetic and chemotactic locomotion. Chemotaxing neutrophils have a polarized external and internal morphology, with centrosomes between the anterior lamellipod and the nucleus. In randomly locomoting cells centrosome position is highly variable with respect to these two cell organelles. Stimulation of randomly locomoting cells with a chemoattractant (chemokinesis) rapidly (within 1 min) induces pronounced spreading and ruffling and concomitantly initiates, in up to 55% of the cells, transient separation of the centrosome into two solitary centrioles, each surrounded by an aster of microtubules. In addition, about 10% of the cells with separated centrosomes have a third, centriolefree aster of microtubules radiating from an accumulation of dense material. Neutrophil activation also leads to an increase in the number of microtubules and an approximately twofold increase in polymer length. This unusual response of the centrosome supports a correlation between cell movement and microtubule organization."
https://openalex.org/W2000383489,Low-frequency resonance Raman spectra of transient hemoglobin species were observed within 10 nanoseconds of photolysis. The Raman frequencies of the iron-proximal histidine stretching mode for transient species having either the R or the T quaternary structure are higher than in the corresponding deoxy species. The observed frequency difference in the iron-histidine mode between the R- and T- state transients indicates that there are quaternary structure-dependent protein forces on the iron-histidine bond in the liganded hemoglobins. These differences are interpreted in terms of changes in the tilt of the histidine with respect to the heme plane.

https://openalex.org/W2024598523,"Accurate recordings of eye movements of children 4 and 5 years old show that their eye movements differed from those of adults. During maintained fixation, saccades were large (1 degree to 2 degrees) and smooth eye movement speeds were high (45 minutes of arc per second). Saccade latencies were highly variable during target step tracking. Smooth pursuit latencies were longer than those of adults. These hitherto unknown characteristics limit a child's ability to use eye movements to acquire visual information."
https://openalex.org/W2120033844,"Indirect immunofluorescent (IIF) techniques employing antitutulin and anticentrosome antibodies were modified for studies of migrating polymorphonuclear (PMNs) leukocytes exposed to gradients or uniform concentrations of chemotactic factor (CF). No significant changes in microtubule (MT) number per cell occurred with chemotactic activation. Significant increases in average MT length per cell occurred upon exposure to gradients or uniform concentrations of CFs. Elongation of MT parallel to the direction of cell migration occurred coincident with shortening of other sets of MTs perpendicular to the direction of cell migration. MT extended radially from a single microtubule organizing center (MTOC) in >99.9% of cells. Following chemotactic activation, the location of the MTOC was observed between nuclear lobes in 65% of fully polarized cells, “posterior” to the nucleus in ⋍34% and “anterior” in less than 1%. Thus alterations of MT array occur coincident with cell orientation or migration in response to chemotactic stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W1995394417,"The 14S messenger RNA (1300 to 1500 nucleotides) for the αA chain of α-crystallin of the mammalian lens is nearly three times larger than required to code for the polypeptide that contains 173 amino acids. As a means of accounting for this anomaly, a complementary DNA clone for the mouse αA-crystallin messenger RNA was constructed in pBR322 and sequenced. Derivation of the protein sequence from the nucleic acid sequence showed that mouse αA-crystallin is similar to that of other organisms. The messenger RNA contains 536 nucleotides located on the 3′ side of the coding region, excluding the polyadenylate stretch. This 3′ sequence does not encode any other crystallin and has multiple termination codons in the three possible reading frames."

https://openalex.org/W1969078402,"Naturally occurring t haplotypes suppress recombination over a region of mouse chromosome 17 that includes the H-2 complex. Each of these t haplotypes is associated with a specific set of H-2 alleles and can be placed into one of a limited number of complementation groups. Genetic studies have demonstrated the existence of a basic homology in genomic organization among all t haplotypes. We used an H-2 cDNA probe to investigate, at the molecular level, possible relationships among the H-2 regions of different t haplotypes. We identified a family of t haplotype-specific restriction fragments that carry DNA sequences homologous to the H-2-like genes. Surprisingly, the H-2-defined restriction patterns from all five complete t haplo-types analyzed are highly homologous, even though H-2 gene products expressed are antigenically distinct. These data lead to two major conclusions. First, all t haplotypes were derived from a small number of closely related ancestors. Second, the H-2 complex region associated with each primordial t chromosome has been maintained within at least the five present-day t haplotypes analyzed here. Hence the H-2 complex is an integral component of naturally occurring t haplotypes."

https://openalex.org/W1978212032,"As reticulocytes mature into erythrocytes, organelles and many enzymes are lost. Protein degradation during reticulocyte maturation was measured by monitoring the release of tyrosine from cell proteins. Proteolysis in rabbit red blood cells was directly proportional to the number of reticulocytes and was low in erythrocytes. This process was inhibited by blockers of cellular adenosine triphosphate production and by agents, such as o-phenanthroline, N-ethylmaleimide, and hemin, which inhibit the soluble adenosine triphosphate-dependent proteolytic system. The breakdown of endogenous proteins in reticulocyte extracts was also inhibited by these agents and required adenosine triphosphate. Inhibitors of lysosomal function, however, did not affect proteolysis. Thus, the proteolytic system that degrades abnormal proteins also catalyzes the elimination of proteins during red cell development."

https://openalex.org/W2057902721,"To analyze the mechanism of assembly of the fertilization membrane of the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, we inhibited the ovoperoxidase that catalyzes dityrosine formation to isolate an uncrosslinked, soft fertilization membrane (SFM). The SFM intermediates were stabilized by divalent cation-dependent interactions: in the absence of divalent cations, the SFM became amorphous and less refractile and released proteins into the surrounding medium. We term the remaining structures “wraiths.” The rate of this disaggregation was increased in solutions of low ionic strength, but 510 mM divalent cations (Ca2+, Mg2+, Mn2+ or Ba2+) prevented disaggregation. Wraiths could be reassembled into structures that resembled SFM by readdition of divalent cations. The SFM contained active ovoperoxidase and could be hardened in vitro by washing away the ovoperoxidase inhibitor and adding H2O2. After hardening, certain proteins of over 100 kd were excluded from SDS-polyacrylamide gels, suggesting that these proteins contain the substrates for crosslinking. We propose that the SFM is a divalent cation-dependent intermediate on the pathway of fertilization membrane assembly containing tyrosyl residues that are appropriately juxtaposed for crosslinking."

Both fractions, designated components A and B in the order of their elution from hydroxyapatite, were purified free of farnesyl pyrophosphate synthetase co-occurring in the same bacterium. They appeared to be proteins of molecular weights of approximately 20,000 (component A) and 60,000 (component B). Component A was more stable as compared with component B which was easily destroyed by relatively mild heat treatment. The hexaprenyl pyrophosphate synthetase reconstituted of these two components catalyzed the synthesis of all-trans-hexaprenyl pyrophosphate from isopentenyl pyrophosphate and all-trans-farnesyl or all-trans-geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, but it did not catalyze a reaction between isopentenyl pyrophosphate and either dimethylallyl or geranyl pyrophosphate."

https://openalex.org/W1966612791,"Spectral analysis of spontaneous fluctuations in human fetal movement revealed strong oscillations at frequencies between 0.24 and 0.90 cycle per minute, which are much higher than those of the cyclic alternation of quiet and active states in the fetus and neonate. Oscillations at frequencies up to 2.88 cycles per minute were also detected, but they were usually much weaker. The prominent peaks in the fetal movement spectra are in the frequency range of recently reported neonatal motor rhythms, and indicate the existence of a cyclic process controlling spontaneous motor output that oscillates near one cycle per minute and begins to function in utero."
https://openalex.org/W1903298430,"Abstract We have cloned via recombinant DNA technology the mRNA sequence of rat pancreatic ribonuclease, and have determined the entire nucleotide sequence of the mature message. Clones bearing RNase sequences within a double-stranded complementary DNA library of rat pancreatic mRNA were initially detected by hybridization with size-fractionated rat pancreatic polyadenylated RNA that included mRNA 0.85 to 1.0 kilobase in length. Recombinant plasmids bearing RNase mRNA sequences were conclusively identified by comparison of the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein with the known amino acid sequence of rat RNase. RNase mRNA is 783 nucleotides in length, plus a poly(a) tail with an average length of 140 nucleotides, and contains long 5' and 3' noncoding regions relative to other pancreatic mRNAs. It encodes a secretory preRNase of 152 amino acid residues including a signal peptide of 25 amino acids."
https://openalex.org/W1978174272,"Protein degradation within retinal ganglion cell axons in vitro is 50 to 110 percent faster than normal in mutant mice exhibiting deficiencies of myelin in the central nervous system. Proteolysis is increased proximally and distally within retinal ganglion cell axons of mice carrying the jumpy mutation or its allele, myelin synthesis deficiency, and is increased distally within those axons of quaking mice. The proteolytic defect is axon (neuron)-specific since the rate of protein degradation within glial cells is normal. Increased axonal proteolysis does not bear a simple relation to hypomyelination since shiverer, another mouse mutant deficient in central myelin, displayed normal rates of axonal protein degradation under the same conditions. These observations suggest an abnormal axon-glial interaction in mice with primary glial defects and raise the possibility that the functioning of histologically normal axons (neurons) may be altered in dysmyelinating diseases."

The immune response to trinitrophenol-Ficoll, a T-cell-independent type II antigen, has been analyzed at the B-cell level (Mongini et al., JEM 755, 884-902, 1982). Following hyperimmunization with trinitrophenol-Ficoll, B-cell clones were isolated by the splenic focus technique in irradiated nude mouse recipients. All B-cell clones expressed mu, and a significant fraction expressed one or more other isotypes. The statistical frequencies of isotypes expressed by in vitro-cultured B-cell clones were observed to follow the C,, gene order (that is, IgM > lgGs > IgG, > IgG*b > IgGn,). T cells were found to increase the amount of lgG2. antibody preferentially. It is difficult to be certain, however, that successive CH switches originate from a single B cell in this system. Moreover, myeloma and hybridoma cell lines have been shown to switch CH genes spontaneously at a low frequency. In the case of MPC-11 (a y2b-producing plasmacytoma), the expressed y2b gene of the parental cell is specifically deleted upon switching to the y2a gene (Eckhardt et al., PNAS 79,3006-3010, 1982). This deletion event encompasses the S,, Syab and C+b regions. The X63 hybridoma has been observed to undergo three forward switches spontaneously (yl + y2b + y2a) and an unexpected backswitch (y2a + yl) at lOO-fold higher frequency (-10e5 versus -10m7 per cell per generation) (Beyreuther et al., ICN-UCLA Symposia 20, 229-244, 1981). Forward switches are correlated with J,, and C, gene rearrangements and deletions (Beyreuther et al., op. cit.). Thus, if we assume that CH deletions are responsible for forward switches, transhomologous chromosome exchange has been invoked to explain the y2a+ yl switch revertant. This latter phenomenon could alsobe explained by tandemly duplicated pairs of C, genes in the X63 hybridoma. It remains to be demonstrated that the phenomena observed in tissueculture cell lines reflect normal B-cell switching events. The molecular requirements and mechanism or mechanisms of regulation of C&gene switching in normal B cells remain important problems. Different steps in class switching could be modulated directly or indirectly by T lymphocytes or their products. T helper factors, which appear to induce or select specific CH isotypes in populations of normal B cells (Isakson et al., JEM 755, 734-748, 1982) conceivably could be used to dissect dynamic steps of CHgene switching. Gene-transfer experiments with multiCH-gene substrates and normal B cells (which express multiple surface isotypes and/or display CH switching potential upon mitogenic stimulation) may also reveal hidden regulatory aspects of this complex biological phenomenon."
https://openalex.org/W1597266343,"A synthesis of a homologous series of highly radioactive photoreactive fatty acids has been developed. Oxidative cleavage of the cis double bonds of unsaturated fatty acids by NaIO4/OsO4 produced the omega-oxo fatty acids; subsequent reduction by [3H]NaBH4 afforded a series of highly radioactive [omega-3H]hydroxy fatty acids to which a variety of photoreactive probes can be readily attached. In this study, the m-diazirinophenoxy group was coupled to the omega-hydroxy groups of the fatty acids, yielding the omega-(m-diazirinophenoxy) derivatives of nonanoic, undecanoic, tridecanoic, and pentadecanoic acid. These photoreactive derivatives were incorporated by L-cells into their major phospholipids; in addition, a number of proteins were shown to be acylated by these fatty acids. The photoreactive group was shown to remain intact as indicated by the cross-linking of the resulting photoreactive phospholipids to other phospholipids as well as to a number of L-cell proteins upon photolysis. This procedure thus identifies integral membrane proteins and directly produces photoaffinity derivatives of those proteins normally acylated by fatty acids."
https://openalex.org/W1506947350,"Phosphoenol-3-bromopyruvate is an excellent competitive inhibitor (versus phosphoenolpyruvate) of maize phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (Ki = 30 microM), provided that preincubation of enzyme with inhibitor is avoided. If the enzyme is preincubated with inhibitor in the presence of Mn2+ and HCO3(-), complete inactivation occurs over the course of about 1 h. The inactivation is first order in enzyme and is saturable with respect to inhibitor, with an apparent Michaelis constant of 67.5 microM and a half-life at high inhibitor concentration of 13.4 min. The inactivation is inhibited by phospholactate and is much slower at low HCO3(-) concentration. Incubation of the enzyme with phosphoenol-3-bromopyruvate in the presence of H14CO3(-) and Mn2+ followed by treatment with NaBH4 leads to incorporation of 14C into the inactive enzyme. If treatment with NaBH4 is omitted, the enzyme is inactivated, but no 14C is incorporated into the inactive product. It appears that phosphoenol-3-bromopyruvate is a mechanism-based inactivator of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, probably because of enzyme-catalyzed conversion to 3-bromooxalacetate, which alkylates the enzyme."
