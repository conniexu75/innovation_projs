https://openalex.org/W1999429858,"Dense biological communities of large epifaunal taxa similar to those found along ridge crest vents at the East Pacific Rise were discovered in the abyssal Gulf of Mexico. These assemblages occur on a passive continental margin at the base of the Florida Escarpment, the interface between the relatively impermeable hemipelagic clays of the distal Mississippi Fan and the jointed Cretaceous limestone of the Florida Platform. The fauna apparently is nourished by sulfide rich hypersaline waters seeping out at near ambient temperatures onto the sea floor."
https://openalex.org/W2048116571,"Petrogenetic hypotheses involving fractional crystallization, assimilation, or mixing of magmas may be expressed and tested as problems in least-squares approximation. The calculation uses all of the data and yields a unique solution for each model, thus avoiding the ambiguity inherent in graphical or trial-and-error procedures. The compositional change in the 1960 lavas of Kilauea Volcano, Hawaii, is used to illustrate the method of calculation."
https://openalex.org/W2002123533,"Electronically excited molecules, being better electron donors and acceptors than their ground states, form charge-transfer complexes (exciplexes) which can lead to radical ions. Exciplex emission is widely used to probe polymers and organized media such as membranes and micelles. Exciplexes are also intermediates in photoreactions that lead to unique products. Photochemical electron-transfer processes, which are the basis of silver halide photography and electrophotography, are involved in many reactions of wide scope. Recent studies have led to the discovery of several electron-transfer photooxygenations with a diversity that will probably rival that of singlet oxygen. Both exciplex emission and photochemical electron transfer play important roles in organic photochemistry."
https://openalex.org/W2068417868,"Specimens from the meteorite fall at 1:05 a. m., on 8 February 1969 at Pueblito de Allende, Chihuahua, Mexico, have been recovered. The meteorite is a chondrite (C3 and C4) with both opaque and microcrystalline matrices. Specimens were brought to a low background gamma counter less than 4 (1/2) days after the fall, and gamma rays from short-lived isotopes have been observed."

But the sun did not produce the chemical elements which are found in the earth and in our bodies. The first two elements and their stable isotopes, hydrogen and helium, emerged from the first few minutes of the early high-temperature, high-density stage of the expanding Universe, the so-called big bang."
https://openalex.org/W2004369882,Field data on the nesting of the green sea turtle were used to construct a stochastic model. This model was simulated by use of a digital computer language simscript (Monte Carlo) to determine the relation between the percentage of nests destroyed and the size of the turtle population. Nest destruction is dependent on population density and provides a mechanism to regulate population size.

https://openalex.org/W1994460269,The reduction in the steady-state rate of evaporation of water by hexadecanol monolayers depends only on the air velocity above the surface and is independent of the absolute rate of evaporation up to air velocities of 40 centimeters per second. This indicates that the monolayer does not affect the vaporization step but increases the size of the diffusion boundary layer. The mechanism (the creation of a surface pressure gradient in the monolayer which reduces the net stress on the surface by the air) is discussed.
https://openalex.org/W2072597120,"Most of the small particles (50 to 100 micrometers in diameter) of microcrystalline beta-rhombohedral boron that quickly transit an argon plasma maintained within a radio-frequency induction-coupled torch emerge as better crystallized spheroids of the same crystalline form and nearly the same size as the starting material. A few crystals of each of four distinctive, well-faceted habits are formed along with the general product. Three of these types are monocrystals of the beta-rhombohedral polymorph, of the tetragonal-III modification, and of an unreported cubic form of boron. Specimens of the fourth type are polycrystals of another unreported form of boron, apparently consisting of many hexagonal platelets stacked in an imprecise fashion."

https://openalex.org/W2011496183,"Atmospheric methane over the past 27,000 years was measured by analyzing air trapped in glacial ice in Greenland and Antarctica. Atmospheric concentrations were stable over that period until about 200 years b.p. In the last 200 years they have more than doubled. This change in concentration is correlated with the increase in human population; the implications for climate modification are discussed. 1 figure, 3 references."
https://openalex.org/W1987454441,"The riddle of a dark night sky, now known as ""Olbers's paradox,"" can be traced back to Thomas Digges in 1576. Since the time of Edmund Halley (1721) the riddle of a dark night sky in an infinite universe uniformly populated with stars has been regarded as a paradox. Constant emphasis on the paradoxical aspect of the problem of darkness at night, however, leads to a one-sided interpretation of the riddle. Calling the phenomenon a ""paradox"" distorts the historical perspective, and consequently we incorrectly attribute the origin of the riddle to Edmund Halley. Also it distorts the cosmological perspective and quite probably has greatly delayed the solution of the riddle."

https://openalex.org/W2088959236,"Gold, silver, and silver iodide sols were prepared in mixed nitrate melts. Electron micographs of the gold and silver sols show particles smaller than 1 micron. The gold sols exhibit conventional absorption and scattering spectra. Both gold and silver sols show unusual stability."
