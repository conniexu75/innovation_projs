Intracranial injection of puromycin aminonucleoside, or of saline has no effect. Puromycin does not afject performance in naive or overtrained goldfish."

One variety will display consistently to its reflection in a mirror. Such display has a typical pattern and can sometimes be triggered by reflection of but one eye. A mirror display test has been designed for experimentation on the brain."
https://openalex.org/W2011504255,"Suspensions of normal spleen cells from nonimmune mice were treated in vitro with RNA extracted from spleen cells from donor mice immunized 4 days previously with sheep erythrocytes. Subsequent incubation of the RNA-treated cells in tissue culture medium at 37 degrees C for several days resulted in a marked increase in the number of localized zones of hemolysis (""antibody plaques"") in relation to the number of viable cells plated in agar containing sheep erythrocytes and complement. Nonimmune cells maintained in tisse, culture medium did not form plaques after incubation with either RNA from Immune mice or ribonuclease-treated RNA from immune mice, or with RNA from non-immune donor mice, or from donors immunized with chicken erythrocytes or bovine serum albumin."

https://openalex.org/W2022907283,"Injury to diapausing pupae of the cecropia silkworm moth stimulates the synthesis of RNA in all pupal tissues and the synthesis of several blood proteins; such injury also induces the precocious synthesis of a protein, termed ""injury protein,"" which normally appears in the blood during adult development. Actinomycin D, injected in concentrations of 2 micrograms per gram of body weight, blocks the injury-stimulated increase in blood protein synthesis and the injury-induced synthesis of injury protein. However, at concentrations of 0.5 micrograms per gram it prevents the induction of injury-protein synthesis but does not prevent the increased synthesis of other blood proteins. These results suggest that low concentrations of actinomycin may inhibit the synthesis of new kinds of messenger RNA but still permit the continued synthesis of messenger RNA's already in production at the time the actinomycin is injected."

https://openalex.org/W2090738981,"Cells of Escherichia coli grown on maltose can be induced by the addition of thiomethyl galactoside to produce beta-galactosidase. If cells are irradiated shortly after induction, the transcription of the DNA ceases, and the enzyme produced by the messenger RNA is observed to reach a maximum. From these data the calculated half-life of unstable messenger RNA is given over a temperature range from 8.1 minutes at 10 degrees C to 0.7 minute at 45 degrees C. The kinetics of cessation of transcription give information on both meassenger RNA decay and rate of transcription. Arrhenius graphs for both these rates are given, and the activation energies mtieasured are 11,000 calories per mole for decay and 22,000 calories per mole for transcription. This relation to temperature is characteristic of enzymatic behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2008142256,"Naturally occurring enzootic infections of Sendai virus have been detected by serologic monitoring and virus isolation in mouse breeder colonies from five states in the United States of America. Six of 21 colonies tested were found to be infected with Sendai virus, and the mean incidence of infection within infected colonies was 76 percent. Forty-one of 120 attempts to isolate the virus were successful."
https://openalex.org/W1987776256,"From a single white Coturnix chick hatched in August 1963, a white colony has been developed. The results of breeding experiments are consistent with the view that the albinism is sex-linked and recessive. It appears likely that the mutation occurred in the first white female hatched, or her sire."

https://openalex.org/W2020203480,"Isotonic saline extracts of both intact and necrotic skin of the rat were capable of releasing over 50 percent of the hydroxyproline content of soluble collagen as dialyzable, peptide-bound amino acid only after prior, limited proteolytic activation of trypsin. These ""activated"" extracts could also solubilize insoluble collagen to release dialyzable hydroxyproline containing peptides. This collagenolytic activity was maximal at pH 5.5 and was not inhibited by soybean trypsin inhibitor, ethyl-enediaminetetraacetic acid, or heavy metal salt. The ""activated"" extracts showed no general proteolytic activity toward denatured hemoglobin. The collagenolytic activity was destroyed both by heat and by extensive tryptic proteolysis."

Virus-like particles and associated granular bodies, also of possible viral nature, are commnonly found in the neoplastic epithelial cells of these tumors. Similar structures are not observed in normal epidermis."

All the doses of DDT fed to the bats, 40 milligrams or more per kilogram of body weight, were lethal. Within a few hours to 13 days after being dosed, the animals developed convulsions; some bats survived up to 3 days after the oniset of the symptoms of poisoning. Bats appear to be far more sensitive to DDT than any other mammal yet tested."

The synergism is expressed by a substantial increase in plasma lactate dehydrogenase, spleen enlargement, host anemia, and quantitative alteration of several blood elements."

https://openalex.org/W1996077695,Changes take place in the protein and isozyme patterns of tissue adjacent to cut surfaces of sweet potato roots infected by the fungus Ceratocystis fimbriata. Chromatography and gel electrophoresis of extracts from sections cut at known distances from a plane of infection showed that inoculation with a pathogenic or nonpathogenic isolate produced similar changes in several proteins and enzymes. Inoculation of a susceptible variety of sweet potato with the nonpathogenic isolate induced in a thin layer of tissue around the site of inoculation an acquired immunity to subsequent inoculation with the pathogen.
https://openalex.org/W2105645740,"THE digestive juices of several decapod Crustacea have been shown to possess a low surface tension and emulsifying properties indicating the presence of surface-active compounds1. Earlier claims2,3 of the presence of taurodeoxycholic acid in the gastric juice of the crab and the crayfish have not been supported by recent investigations4 which have demonstrated some differences in the properties of the emulsifiers and those of bile salts."

In laboratory animals, ‘AY–9944’ significantly depressed serum sterol-levels4. In view of its potential use as antihypercholesterolemic agent5, we have studied the effects of this agent on adrenal steroid metabolism. The inhibition of 11β-hydroxylase by ‘AY–9944’ in rat adrenal homogenates is reported herewith."

Since this reaction did not occur in the pithed animal, attempts were made to block the pressor effect at the autonomic ganglia. When hexamethonium failed to block the effects of C. parqui extracts it was decided to examine the effects of ganglion blocking agents per se in the rat."

By contrast, sensitized hamsters given cortisone became more susceptible to the challenging leukemic graft. Neither response was elicited by sensitization with cells of the guinea pig, Syrian hamster, rabbit, or human being."

However, recent examinations of normal cells have disclosed differences which should not be neglected, particularly when changes of the bone marrow due to pathological conditions are to be examined. The detailed results are being published in monograph form, with comprehensive colour illustrations of all the cell types1, and the following account summarizes the differences between (the cells of) sheep and man."
